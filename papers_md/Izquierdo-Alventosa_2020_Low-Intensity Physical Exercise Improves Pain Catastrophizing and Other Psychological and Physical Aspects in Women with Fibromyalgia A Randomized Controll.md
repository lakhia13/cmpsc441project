Abstract: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain and other
physical and psychological features. In this study, we aimed to analyze the eﬀect of a low-intensity
physical exercise (PE) program, combining endurance training and coordination, on psychological
aspects (i.e., pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, stress), pain perception (i.e., pain acceptance,
pressure pain threshold (PPT), and quality of life and physical conditioning (i.e., self-perceived
functional capacity, endurance and functional capacity, power and velocity) in women with FM.
For this purpose, a randomized controlled trial was carried out. Thirty-two women with FM were
randomly allocated to a PE group (PEG, n = 16), performing an eight-week low-intensity PE program
and a control group (CG, n = 16). Pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, stress, pain acceptance,
PPT, quality of life, self-perceived functional capacity, endurance and functional capacity, power, and
velocity were assessed before and after the intervention. We observed a signiﬁcant improvement
in all studied variables in the PEG after the intervention (p < 0.05). In contrast, the CG showed no
improvements in any variable, which further displayed poorer values for PPT (p < 0.05). In conclusion,
a low-intensity combined PE program, including endurance training and coordination, improves
psychological variables, pain perception, quality of life, and physical conditioning in women with FM.

1. Introduction

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain associated with other
physical symptoms, such as fatigue or decreased physical capacity, and psychological alterations [1].

One of the psychological alterations that has been associated with FM is pain catastrophizing, a
speciﬁc psychosocial construct of pain, which includes cognitive and emotional processing, sense
of helplessness, pessimism, and rumination about pain-related symptoms [2]. Pain catastrophizing
has been associated with pain severity and disability [3], which is being considered a risk factor
for pain chroniﬁcation [4]. Furthermore, this construct of pain has been shown to decrease pain
acceptance, which, in turn, may aggravate the symptomatology of FM [5]. Pain acceptance is lower in
FM patients [6], which has been linked to a higher degree of disability [7] and a lower quality of life [8].
In addition to pain catastrophizing, other psychological alterations that can aggravate the
symptomatology of FM are anxiety and depression. These alterations, together with high levels of
stress, have been proposed as precipitating and/or perpetuating factors of this condition [9] and are
inversely related to quality of life among FM patients [10]. In this regard, it has been suggested that
the higher the level of pain catastrophizing, anxiety, and depression in FM individuals, the greater
their sensitivity to non-painful stimuli and diﬃculty in coping with the painful process [11].

Interestingly, pain catastrophizing, has also been inversely related to muscular endurance [12].
This tendency has proven to have a negative impact on neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, and
neuroendocrine systems [13]. In turn, such an impact causes an alteration of functional capacity [4],
which can be assessed both objectively and subjectively. An objective decline in physical conditioning
has a detrimental eﬀect on the ability to perform activities of daily life, but also the subjectively
altered perception of functional capacity can lead to actual physical inactivity and a progressive
deconditioning [14]. Physical deconditioning may negatively impact the individual’s quality of life [15]
and his/her professional performance, which leads to absenteeism [16].

Since a direct relationship between health care costs and severity of FM symptoms has been
documented [17], implementing an eﬀective therapeutic approach remains a paramount challenge
for the medical community. Current FM management is usually based on pharmacological
treatment, which, despite being equally eﬀective as a non-pharmacological therapy, has greater
side eﬀects and lower acceptance by FM patients [18]. One of the most promising and cost-eﬀective
non-pharmacological approaches is physical exercise (PE). Thus, a number of protocols have been
proposed, such as aerobic [19–23] resistance [19,22,24–28], ﬂexibility [24,26,28], combined [20,29–34], or
other modalities [23,35,36], which have achieved improvements mainly in quality of life, pain, ﬁtness,
and depression. Overall, it has been suggested that a protocol including endurance and coordination
would be the treatment of choice [37] with progressive workloads adapted to the individual’s condition
to promote adherence [38].

In this regard, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has been carried out to analyze the
impact of a low-intensity exercise program, combining endurance training, i.e., aerobic and resistance
exercises aimed at improving endurance and coordination, and adapted to the symptomatology of
patients (i.e., individualized and progressive) on pain catastrophizing and other psychological variables
such as pain acceptance or self-perceived functional capacity in women with FM. Given the previously
mentioned deleterious eﬀects of the negative cognitions on FM symptoms, we hypothesized that a
low intensity PE program would improve catastrophism in women with FM, which results in an
improvement in other related psychological and physical variables. Thus, the aim of this study was to
determine the eﬀects of a low-intensity PE program, combining endurance training and coordination,
on pain catastrophism in women with FM. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the eﬀects of the proposed
protocol on other psychological aspects (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress), pain perception (i.e., pain
acceptance and pressure pain threshold), quality of life, and physical conditioning (i.e., self-perceived
functional capacity, endurance and functional capacity, power, and velocity) in women with FM.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Participants

Thirty-two women diagnosed with FM were recruited from several Fibromyalgia Associations
from February to May 2019 to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for the participants were:
(i) women between 30–70 years old, an age range in which FM becomes more prevalent [39], diagnoses
according to the 2016 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM [40], and having received
pharmacological treatment for more than three months with no clinical improvement. Exclusion criteria
were: (i) pregnancy or breast-feeding, (ii) any known advanced-stage pathology associated with the
locomotor system that contraindicates physical activity (arthritis, osteoarthritis, uric acid), (iii) epilepsy,
(iv) intake of drugs that reduce the seizure threshold, (v) history of intense headaches, (vi) neurological
disorder, (vii) peripheral neuropathy, (viii) known serious cardiovascular disease (i.e., endocranial
hypertension, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, heart failure, cardiac pacemaker), (ix) pneumothorax,
(x) neoplasia, (xi) surgery in the last four months, (xii) diagnosis of alcohol addiction, and (xiii) use of
psychoactive drugs or narcotics. Moreover, patients should not have been enrolled in any PE program
in the two months before the study began.

2.1.1. Study Design

A randomized controlled trial was performed (NCT03801109). The participants were randomly
allocated to two diﬀerent groups using the simple randomization method with the Random Allocation
Software [41] by an external assistant who was blinded to the study objectives: physical exercise
group (PEG) (n = 16) and control group (CG) (n = 16). To analyze the eﬀect of the interventions,
two assessments were performed: one at baseline (T0) and another following the intervention (T1).
The physical therapist performing the assessments was unaware of the group the patients had been
assigned to. To reduce bias, participants were instructed not to tell the assessor about the treatment
they received.

All enrolled participants provided informed written consent prior to entering the study.
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the principles of the World Medical Association’s
Declaration of Helsinki and the protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Universitat
de València.

2.1.2. Sample Size Calculation

Sample size was calculated by accounting for two study groups measured twice and with
reference to a previous study conducted by Koele et al. [42] in which pain catastrophizing was
measured. Accordingly, an eﬀect size of d = 0.72 was expected. Furthermore, a type I error of 5%
and a type II error of 20% were set. This calculation rendered 14 volunteers per group. Ultimately, 32
women were included to prevent loss of power derived from potential dropouts. G-Power
version 3.1
was used for sample size estimation (Institute for Experimental Psychology, University of Düsseldorf,
Düsseldorf, Germany).

2.1.3. Intervention Procedures

As reported, the participants were allocated to two groups (i.e., PEG and CG) whose interventions
are explained below. During each session, potential discomfort or adverse eﬀects, such as severe
muscle pain (i.e., ≥7.5) [43] and/or excessive fatigue (i.e., ≥5) [44], were recorded using a 10-point
Visual Analogue Scale and Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion, respectively.

2.1.4. Low-Intensity Physical Exercise

Participants of this group were enrolled in a low-intensity PE program combining endurance
training (i.e., aerobic and low-load resistance exercises aimed at improving endurance) and coordination,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3634

supervised by a physical therapist with expertise in therapeutic exercise. All training sessions were
carried out at the same time of day and in the same room. The administered protocol included 16
sessions, which were performed twice a week (60 min each) for eight weeks [29]. The sessions were
divided into two stages with the ﬁrst (i.e., sessions 1 to 4) being devoted to the participants’ adjustment
and familiarization with the exercise, and the second (i.e., sessions 5 to 16) aimed at personalized
strength and coordination training. In this regard, training intensity was adjusted by controlling the
individual’s self-perceived exertion using the Borg CR-10 scale [45] as explained below.

Each session was divided into three parts: warm-up, training, and cool-down. (i) Warm-up
consists of walking at a slow pace and moving the main joint structures (neck, shoulders, elbows,
wrists, hips, knees, and ankles) within the patient’s range of motion. (ii) Training is explained below.
(iii) Cool down consists of walking at a slow pace, overall trunk stretching, and breathing deeply, while
lying on the ﬂoor.

Training in the ﬁrst stage (sessions 1 to 4) consisted of walking at a comfortable speed for 15 min,
performing a 10-exercise circuit for 25 min, and cooling down for 20 min. Exercises were conducted
using 1-kg dumbbells and weights at a velocity determined by a metronome set at 60 beats per minute.
To ensure a weak or very weak perceived eﬀort (i.e., 1–2 categories on the CR-10 Borg) [44,45], the
perceived exertion was registered after each session and the work load was individually adjusted for
the next session.

In the second stage (5th to 16th session), after a 10-min warm-up, the participants had to perform
as many repetitions as possible in 1 min of the exercises of the 10-exercise circuit for 40 min, reporting,
in this case, a perceived eﬀort of 3–4 on the Borg scale, to ensure a moderate eﬀort [44,45]. After this,
they cooled down for 10 min.

Table 1 shows the 10-exercise circuit for both stages 1 and 2. The work load varied depending on
the participant since they were allowed to adapt the exercise according to their self-perceived pain or
exertion each day [1]. However, the number of repetitions always ranged between 15 and 25 according
to PE recommendations proposed by the 2014 Guide for the prescription of physical exercise of The
American College of Sports Medicine for improving muscle endurance [38]. The combined aerobic
and resistance training exercises aimed to work on endurance and coordination. Aerobic exercises
included walking and moving the main joint structures, as explained previously. Low-load resistance
training was oriented to the strengthening of the upper and lower limbs using dumbbells/weights with
loads ranging between 0.5 and 2 kg for the upper limbs, and between 1 and 3 kg for the lower limbs
based on the Borg scale scoring. A soft elastic band was also used for limb and trunk training and
coordination exercises, as described in Table 1. Coordination exercises included standing calf raises,
sitting down and standing up from a chair, stepping up and down, and throwing a ball into the air.

6. Dumbbell shoulder external and internal rotation while standing
7. Sitting down and standing up from a chair without using arms
8. Throwing a ball above the head and catching it
9. Standing calf raise
10. Low Step-ups

2.1.5. Control Group

The participants assigned to this group received no intervention and were asked to perform
their daily routines, while both groups continued to take their usual medication. To ensure that no
participant undertook intense physical activity and should, therefore, be excluded from the analysis, a

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3634

5 of 15

logbook was used to record the type of physical activity undertaken (domestic or recreational) and
the approximate number of hours per week. The time elapsed between the ﬁrst assessment and
reevaluation was eight weeks for both groups.

2.2. Assessments

As discussed above, assessments were conducted twice, once at baseline and another at nine

weeks following completion of the eight-week intervention. The following variables were assessed.

2.2.1. Pain Catastrophizing

Pain catastrophizing was measured with the validated Spanish version of the Pain Catastrophizing
Scale (PCS) for people with FM. This is a self-administered scale consisting of 13 items with a
score ranging from 0 “Not at all” to 4 “All the time.” It presents three dimensions: (i) rumination,
(ii) magniﬁcation; and (iii) helplessness. A total score is yielded (ranging from 0–52), whereby higher
scores are representative of greater pain catastrophizing. The reliability of the scale is excellent
(ICC = 0.94) [46].

2.2.2. Anxiety

Anxiety was measured with the validated Spanish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) especially with the anxiety subscale. This subscale consists of seven items with a score
ranging from 0 to 3. A total score of more than 10 points indicates anxiety. A score ranging from 8–10
represents a borderline case and a score of less than 8 points represents no signiﬁcant anxiety [47].
It has shown an excellent reliability (ICC = 0.85) [48].

2.2.3. Depression

Depression was evaluated by the validated Spanish version of

the Beck Depression
Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) [49], which is a widely used 21-item self-report inventory that has
been proven to be highly accurate for measuring the severity of depression in patients with chronic
pain [50,51] Each of the 21 items scores from 0 to 3 with a total score of 63 points. A score of 0–13
points means that there is minimal depression, 14 to 19 points means a mild depression, 20–28 points
indicate a moderate depression, and 29 or more points indicate severe depression [49]. It has shown
good reliability (ICC between 0.73 and 0.86) [52].

2.2.4. Stress

The Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), which was validated for the Spanish population and whose
reliability has been proven to be excellent (ICC = 0.82), was used for the stress assessment. It is a
self-report instrument with 10 items that evaluate the level of perceived stress during the last month
with a 5-point response scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very
often). Higher scores indicate a higher perceived stress [53].

2.2.5. Perception of Pain

The perception of pain was measured using two approaches, which include pain acceptance and

pressure pain threshold.

Pain acceptance was evaluated by the 15-item Spanish adapted version of the Chronic Pain
Acceptance Questionnaire in patients with FM [54] (CPAQ-FM), which is a 15-item self-administered
inventory measuring the acceptance of pain. The items are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (never
true) to 6 (always true). Higher scores indicate higher levels of acceptance. This tool has shown good
internal consistency or reliability (Cronbach’s α: 0.78).

The pressure pain threshold (PPT) was assessed using an algometer (WAGNER Force Dial TM
FDK 20/FDN 100 Series Push Pull Force Gage, Greenwich, CT, USA) at each of the 18 tender points used

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3634

6 of 15

to diagnose FM [55]. First, the presence and location of the tender points was conﬁrmed via palpation
and pen-marked by an experienced physiotherapist. The pressure threshold was then measured
◦
by applying the algometer directly to the tender point with the axis of the shaft maintained at 90
relative to the examining surface. The area of the algometer tip was 1 cm2 and the pressure values
were reported in kg/cm2. The subject was instructed to verbally inform when pain or discomfort was
initially felt. The procedure used has excellent intra-observer reliability [56]. The average of the PPT
measured was used for subsequent analyses [24].

2.2.6. Quality of Life

Quality of life was assessed with the Spanish validated version of the Revised Fibromyalgia
Impact Questionnaire (FIQR). This is a multidimensional self-administered questionnaire with 21 items
divided into three domains: (i) physical function, (ii) overall impact, and (iii) severity of symptoms.
Each item is evaluated on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the ‘worst.’
The summed score for physical function (range 0 to 90) is divided by 3, the summed score for overall
impact (range 0 to 20) is not modiﬁed, and the summed score for symptoms (ranging from 0 to 100) is
divided by 2. The total FIQR score is the sum of such three domain scores. It has an excellent reliability
(ICC = 0.82) [57].

2.2.7. Physical Conditioning

We assessed both the subjective and the objective physical conditioning. To assess the subjective
physical conditioning, we evaluated the self-perceived functional capacity. The objective physical
conditioning was determined by evaluating endurance and functional capacity, power, and velocity, as
described below.

3.

Self-perceived functional capacity was assessed based on the “Physical Function” subscale of
the FIQR (FIQR-PF). This subscale consists of nine items assessing the self-perceived abilities to
perform daily living activities (e.g., walk for 20 min, climb one ﬂight of stairs . . . ). The maximal
score is 30. The higher scores point to a poorer perception of physical function. It has shown a
good reliability (ICC = 0.73) [57].
Endurance and functional capacity were assessed by the six-minute walk test (6MWT). Participants
walked down a 15-m long hallway for a total of six minutes. Any contra-indications were checked
before the test started, so heart rate, oxygen level, and Borg Rate of Perceived fatigue were
recorded besides the main variable, i.e., the walked distance. Patients were allowed to take as
many standing rests as necessary, but the timer kept going. The instructions given to the patients
were: “Walk to the turnaround point at each end. I am going to use this counter to keep track
of the laps you complete. You may stand and rest, but you should walk as fast as you are able.
Remember that the aim is to walk as far as possible, but do not run.” This test has shown an
excellent reliability (ICC = 0.91) [58].
Power was evaluated by the ﬁve-repetition sit-to-stand test (5STST) consisting of sitting down
and standing up from an armless chair (43 cm high) ﬁve times as quickly as possible. Participants
with arms crossed over their chest were instructed to stand up completely and make ﬁrm
contact when sitting. Timing began at the command “ready-steady-go” and stopped when they
sat after the ﬁfth stand-up [59]. This test has shown an excellent reliability in adult women
(ICC = 0.92) [60].Velocity was assessed by the Four-Meter Gait Speed Test (4mGST). The 4mGST
consisted of walking a distance of 4 m at the usual pace. This test in addition to assessing the
walking speed allows us to estimate the risk of disability for a given individual [61]. Both the
test-retest and the inter-rater reliability have been shown to be excellent (ICC = 0.89 − 0.99 and
ICC = 0.97, respectively) [62].

2.3. Statistics

All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.24 (IBM SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Standard
statistical methods were used to obtain the mean and standard deviation (SD). Inferential analyses of
the data were performed using two-way mixed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with an
inter-subject factor called “group” having two categories (PEG and CG), and a within-subject factor
called “treatment” having two categories (T0 and T1). Post-hoc analysis was conducted using the
Bonferroni correction provided by the statistics package used, and the eﬀect size was calculated using
Cohen’s d. We also compared age, weight, height, and level of pain between groups using a one-way
ANOVA to ensure that the two groups were similar at baseline. The normality and homoscedasticity
assumptions were checked by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. Type I error was established
as < 5% (p < 0.05).

3. Results

3.1. Participants

Thirty-six subjects were assessed for eligibility. Two failed to meet inclusion criteria and two
declined to participate. Therefore, 32 participants were included and then randomized (16 in PEG
and 16 in CG) (Figure 1). The mean (SD) age for the participants was 53.06 (8.4) years for the PEG
and 55.13 (7.35) years for the CG, weight, 70.35 (18.02) kg for the PEG, and 72.29 (13.94) kg for the CG,
and height, 159.25 (6.2) cm for the PEG, and 160.38 (6.44) cm for the CG. There were no statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in age, weight, height, and level of pain between groups (p > 0.05, data not
shown). No incidents were reported at any point in time.

Data are expressed as mean (SD), d: Cohen’s d eﬀect size reported only when the diﬀerences between times were
signiﬁcant: *: p < 0.05.

As shown in Table 2, all the psychological constructs assessed (i.e., pain catastrophizing, anxiety,
stress, and depression) signiﬁcantly improved in the physical exercise group (PEG) after the intervention
with increases of 7.31, 1.87, 2.43, and 7.32 points, respectively. Statistically signiﬁcant improvements
were also observed in PEG for pain perception both in the pain acceptance with an increase of 4.94
points, and, in the average PPT, with a mean increase of 0.32 kg/cm2. Lastly, PEG also improved
signiﬁcantly by 9.98 points in quality of life. On the contrary, the CG failed to improve in any of the
analyzed variables, and further exhibited a signiﬁcantly poorer average PPT, with an average decrease
of 0.25 kg/cm2.

In terms of the eﬀect of the interventions on the individual’s physical conditioning, as noted in
Table 3, participants belonging to PEG experienced a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in their
physical conditioning after the intervention. They improved their self-perceived functional capacity, as
indicated by a 3.14-point increase in the FIQR-PF mean score. They also improved their endurance and
functional capacity by increasing the average distance walked in the 6MWT test by 32 m. Furthermore,
they improved their power and velocity, as observed by improved speed rates in both 5CRT and
4mGST of 6.85 and 0.49 s, respectively. Regarding the CG, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
observed in any of the previously mentioned variables.

4. Discussion

This study shows that a low impact PE protocol combining endurance training (i.e., aerobic
and resistance training aimed at improving endurance) and coordination is eﬀective for improving
psychological features (i.e., pain catastrophizing, anxiety, depression, stress), pain perception (i.e., pain

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3634

acceptance and pressure pain threshold ), quality of life, and physical conditioning (i.e., self-perceived
functional capacity, endurance and functional capacity, power, and velocity) in women with FM.

Pain catastrophizing refers to a set of exaggerated and ruminating negative cognitions and
emotions during perceived or actual painful stimulation [2] and has been linked with adverse
pain-related outcomes and FM-related disability [3]. PE has been posited as one of the most eﬀective
strategies to distract attention from pain [63] and reduce negative thoughts about pain, especially
rumination [64]. In this regard, we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in pain catastrophizing scores after
the PE intervention. In line with these results, previous studies using PE alone or in combination
with psychological/cognitive techniques, reported beneﬁcial eﬀects on pain catastrophizing in people
with FM or chronic pain, as disclosed by a number of studies. This includes those conducted by
Lazaridou et al. [35], in which a combined physical and psychological therapy (i.e., Yoga) was used,
and those completed by Casey et al. [65] who applied PE combined with Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy, or conducted by Seemts et al. [66] who combined aerobic exercise, mainly in water, with
cognitive-behavioral treatment. These results suggest that psychological or/and physical techniques,
either alone or in combination, may be beneﬁcial to improve catastrophism in patients with chronic
pain. However, the previously mentioned studies used standard PE programs without taking into
account a potential aggravation of symptoms experienced by women with FM (i.e., fatigue), which
has been posited as the main cause of low adherence to PE programs [38]. Our study reports that a
customized low impact PE program, adapted to the individual’s self-perception of fatigue, is eﬀective
in improving pain catastrophizing. Conversely, no signiﬁcant changes were observed in the CG.

This positive ﬁnding related to pain catastrophism was further conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcantly lower
perceived pain, as indicated by higher pain acceptance and PPT values. Regarding pain acceptance,
it has been associated with enhanced physical functioning in chronic pain patients. Likewise, the
improved PPT may be due to a better physical conditioning [67,68], which, in turn, may lead to better
pain acceptance [69]. Few authors have reported improvements in PPT after exercise programs [31,32]
while using long-term interventions (i.e., 12–24 weeks), aquatic exercise, or psychological therapy.
Therefore, their results are not entirely comparable. By contrast, CG subjects showed signiﬁcantly
poorer values for pain perception, as measured with an algometer, which may be due to the progressive
physical deconditioning of these patients [67,68].

With regard to the other psychological variables analyzed (anxiety, depression, and stress), all of
them signiﬁcantly improved in the PEG. Improvements in anxiety may be due to the well-documented
role of PE as a speciﬁc anxiety modulator [70]. In addition, anxiety has a direct relationship with pain
acceptance [71], which, as discussed above, also improved in PEG. Some authors have documented the
beneﬁcial eﬀects of PE on anxiety in people with FM [21,26,34]. The only study that analyzed the eﬀect
of a combined aerobic and resistance exercise protocol on anxiety reported a greater reduction than that
obtained in our study (i.e., 41% compared to our 15%), which may be due to the well-known relaxing
eﬀects of warm water [34]. With regard to depression, we found positive results following the PE
intervention with a similar [29,34] or even higher [20] reduction than that obtained in previous studies
using combined aerobic and resistance PE protocols. This may be due to the release of neurotrophins
triggered by PE, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as people with depression tend to
display lower levels of this biomarker than their healthy counterparts, while PE induces its increase [72].
Lastly, the lowered stress levels observed in the current study suggests that PE could be a helpful
approach to coping with stress, while also promoting stress resistance in women [64]. Previous studies
have also concluded that moderate aerobic exercise [73] can reduce stress levels in people with FM,
especially when working out in group settings, due to social interaction [74]. By contrast, we observed
no improvements in the CG in any of the analyzed psychological variables. Overall, these results
suggest that a combined low-intensity PE program, adapted to the individual’s symptoms, is eﬀective
in relieving anxiety, depression, and stress in women with FM.

As noted above, quality of life is impaired in people with FM [15]. Our PE protocol induced
improvements in all the analyzed psychological constructs as well as in pain perception, which may

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 3634

have contributed to improving quality of life [75]. Many studies have shown that PE improves quality
of life in the FM population, either through aerobic [20,23], resistance [19,26,37], and ﬂexibility [24,26]
exercises, protocols combining aerobic and resistance training [20], and speciﬁc modalities such as
Tai-Chi [23]. However, such authors failed to include coordination exercises, which have been shown
to challenge the sensory, cognitive, and musculoskeletal systems, and, thus, improve quality of life in
older adults [76]. Yet, it has never before been implemented in women with FM. Thus, our results
suggest that our PE protocol may be a useful tool to improve quality of life in women with ﬁbromyalgia.
In this regard, it would be interesting to apply the proposed exercise protocol on an ongoing basis, as it
has been shown that long-term physical exercise positively aﬀects quality of life in people with FM [77].
All variables related to subjective (i.e., self-perceived functional capacity) and objective (i.e.,
endurance and functional capacity, power, and velocity) physical conditioning improved signiﬁcantly
in the PEG, but not in the CG. This is of importance since both subjective and objective physical
functions have been shown to be markedly impaired in women with FM, the former to a greater
extent than the latter [14]. Our positive results on the subjective physical conditioning are noteworthy,
since people with ﬁbromyalgia who feel that they are unable to perform daily physical activities may
avoid performing such activities and participating in therapeutic PE programs, which, in turn, may
lead to objective physical deconditioning [14]. We, thus, evaluated objective physical conditioning
by means of 6MWT, which is an inexpensive, relatively quick, safe, and a well-tolerated technique
for the prediction of VO2 max [78], and may be considered an indirect measure of cardiorespiratory
or maximal aerobic power ﬁtness in this population. Furthermore, 5STST was chosen because not
only lower limb strength and power are required, but also good coordination and balance are required.
Therefore, it covers several important components of physical function [59,60]. Lastly, we assessed
the 4mGST, since low gait speed has shown to be one of the main factors contributing to sarcopenia
and, ultimately, to frailty [79]. Although the latter two variables have been mainly studied in older
adults, they were used in the present study because women with FM have been show to display
early aging and lower physical abilities compared to their age-matched healthy counterparts, which
resembles healthy senior adults [80]. Our improvements in objective physical conditioning are in line
with those reported by several authors following the implementation of diﬀerent types of exercises,
such as aerobic [22] or resistance exercises [22,25], or combined training (aerobic, resistance, ﬂexibility,
and patient education) [30].

Lastly, as pointed out before, lack of adherence seems to be typical in FM patients, which could be
due to post-exercise soreness. The average adherence in reference studies was 85%, whereas adherence
in our study was 100%. This may be due to the customized protocol we applied, which was duly
tailored to each patient’s symptoms. The authors of the present study strongly believe that therapies
aimed at FM patients should encourage participation by focusing on protocols with individualized
work-loads, rather than relying on standard protocols.

Limitations

The main limitation of the current study may be the small sample size. However, an a priori power
analysis indicated that our sample size was suﬃcient. Future studies should conﬁrm our ﬁndings in a
larger population. However, therapeutic PE interventions should always be implemented in small
groups in order to ensure proper performance of exercises, compliance with the protocol and, where
necessary, an individualized correction of errors. Another limitation may be the fact that women
were recruited from Fibromyalgia Associations, and, therefore, may present a diﬀerent behavior than
other FM patients. Regarding the protocol, a longer exercise program might have led to better results
(i.e., diﬀerences between groups), and we did not perform any follow-up measurements to verify if
the PE-induced beneﬁts lasted in time. Lastly, since most FM patients are women, the current study
was performed on women only, so this may bias the ﬁndings, which cannot be extrapolated to the
general population.

5. Conclusions

The results obtained from this study show that a combined low-intensity PE program, including
endurance training and coordination, improves pain catastrophizing in women with FM. Furthermore,
the proposed protocol improves other psychological variables (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress),
perceived pain, quality of life, and physical conditioning in women with FM.
