Abstract: Background: Schools are considered natural environments in which to enhance students’
social–emotional skills and mental health in general, but they can be especially important for stu-
dents with refugee and immigrant backgrounds. The current study tested the effectiveness of two
school-based interventions in enhancing the mental health and wellbeing of adolescents of native,
refugee, and immigrant backgrounds. It further analyzed the role of age, gender, daily stressors, and
discrimination in affecting the interventions’ effectiveness. Methods: A three-arm cluster RCT with
parallel assignment was applied among the 16 schools. Schools were randomized to three conditions
of two active interventions and a waiting-list control condition. Students (n = 1974) ﬁlled in an online
questionnaire at baseline before the interventions, after the interventions, and at follow-up an average
of 9 months after the interventions. The effectiveness criteria were internalizing and externalizing
problems, resilience, and prosocial behavior. Results: Interventions were generally not effective in
decreasing mental health problems and increasing psychosocial resources. The expected positive
intervention effects were dependent on students’ age and gender and exposure to socioeconomic
daily stressors. Conclusion: Interventions enhancing teacher awareness and peer relationships at
school should be carefully tailored according to the strengths and vulnerabilities of participating
students, especially their daily stress exposure, but also age and gender.

More diverse student populations and possibilities for intercultural understanding
have been issues of increasing interest in European schools in the last decade [1]. In Finland
too, forced and unforced migration has brought many new families and children into the
school system. Roughly, eight percent of the Finnish population has a foreign background
(either one or both parents born abroad) [2]. Multicultural understanding and new skills
among teachers are needed in schools to ensure successful integration, cooperation, and a
sense of belonging for adolescents with diverse backgrounds.

Due to social and neurophysiological developmental changes in adolescence [3],
young people are generally at heightened risk of certain mental disorders, such as

depression [4,5]. Students with immigrant backgrounds are especially vulnerable, and
many of them feel lonely and excluded in their peer relations when resettling in a new coun-
try [6]. Heightened levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression
are common in migrant and refugee children and adolescents [7–9]. These disorders are
even more pronounced among refugee adolescents, as they carry multiple burdens of
traumatic war and migration experiences [10].

There is thus an urgent need to provide support for native and immigrant adolescents
in their everyday school and community settings by emphasizing psychological wellbeing,
social afﬁliation, and cultural exchange [11]. Research has delineated effective school-
based interventions for traumatized immigrants and refugees, especially those involving
cognitive–behavioral and creative elements [11–13]. Yet, research is scarce on the role of
teacher training and peer group interventions in enhancing adolescents’ psychological
wellbeing and optimal social adjustment. The current study contributes to this research
gap by examining the effectiveness of two psychosocial interventions—a teacher training
and a peer group intervention—in improving mental health among native, immigrant, and
refugee backgrounds.

2. Immigrant Adolescents’ Social Adjustment and Mental Health

Research conﬁrms that immigrant young people (foreign-born adolescents in their new
country of residence), and especially refugee adolescents, show lower wellbeing and more
social and mental health problems than their native peers. Compared to native adolescents,
immigrants have reported more loneliness, anxiety, and lack of close friendships, and
poorer school belonging in Finland [14]. Similar results have been reported elsewhere. In
an Italian study [15], immigrant adolescents showed more psychosomatic symptoms and
were unhappier than their native peers. They also reported being less satisﬁed with their
health, or life in general. Other studies have found immigrant students to be more prone
both to being bullied [6,16] and to bullying others [17]. In a large-scale study including
28 European countries, the ﬁrst- and second-generation migrant adolescents reported
more dissatisfaction in life compared to their native peers [18]. Results on mental health
symptoms have been somewhat mixed: A review concluded that migrant children in
Europe showed more internalizing problems (i.e., depression, anxiety, or somatization),
but not more externalizing problems (i.e., aggression, hyperactivity, or antisocial behavior)
compared to native children [19]. Yet, according to a meta-analysis, both externalizing and
internalizing problems of immigrant adolescents exceeded those of native adolescents [20].
Some immigrants with refugee backgrounds suffer from trauma-related problems
while facing great challenges in attempting to start a new life and adjust in the host
country [21]. Yet, mental health consequences of trauma differ greatly: A systematic review
reported that 19–54% of refugee children and adolescents suffer from post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and 3–30% from depression [22]. Demographic and immigration factors
can partially explain the large differences in prevalence. Girls, older adolescents, and
refugees with African (and not Asian) backgrounds tended to show more depressive and
PTSD symptoms. Past traumatic events, especially separation from parents, and own injury,
were associated with high PTSD. Post-migration stress such as uncertain legal status, lack
of personal and institutional support, and discrimination were associated with both high
PTSD and depression.

Immigrants are likely to face acculturative stress in learning new customs, rules, and
expectations, and they may also experience prejudice and discrimination [23–25]. This may
cause a risk of mental health and psychosocial problems for immigrant adolescents [26].
For example, greater exposure to acculturative stress has been found to be associated with
a high level of internalizing symptoms among adolescent immigrants [25]. By contrast,
integration as an acculturation strategy is associated with low levels of mental health
problems and high life satisfaction and self-esteem [27]. On the other hand, multiple social
and cultural factors have been found to protect immigrant adolescents’ mental health

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

in their new home country [19,21,28]. These factors include social support, a stable and
multicultural living environment, and a sense of school safety.

3. Effectiveness of Psychosocial School Interventions

Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been conducted on interventions
focusing on improving students’ mental health and wellbeing in high-income countries.
Some have focused on native-born adolescents [29,30], and others on immigrant adolescents
and refugees [11,13,31,32]. The evidence concerning the reduction in PTSD, functional im-
pairment, and peer problems among adolescents participating in professionally conducted,
clinical treatments is promising. However, results are still ambiguous concerning universal
promotive and preventive whole-school or classroom-based interventions. Whole-school
interventions have struggled to show effectiveness because of challenges in engaging all
school staff, a lack of clear-cut intervention aims, and difﬁculties in data collection [29,33].
Teacher training and awareness raising are common whole-school intervention ap-
proaches. A review summarized the effects of teacher training programs that aimed to
increase teachers’ competence in addressing students’ mental health needs [34]. Most of
the reviewed studies were successful in increasing knowledge among teachers and some
also found improvement in teachers’ ability to intervene and refer students to appropriate
services. A review by Stratford et al. [35] reported that successful teacher training elements
included improved counseling and communication skills, increased knowledge and aware-
ness about traumatic experiences in learning, and more active parent engagement (the
criterion of success was effective support for trauma-exposed students).

It has been suggested that teachers’ motivation and cultural competence play an impor-
tant role in supporting the mental health of refugee and migrant students [36,37]. Teacher
self-efﬁcacy, i.e., the teachers’ own judgement of their capability in inducing desirable
student outcomes, has also been found to improve student academic performance [38] and
motivation through instructional support [39]. A systematic review analyzed the effective-
ness of teacher training in increasing pre -and in-service teachers’ cultural competence,
indicated by attitudes, knowledge, and practices of teaching multicultural classes [40]. Re-
sults showed that the most effective teacher trainings were characterized by group-guided
critical reﬂection, enactment, and embedded training in schoolwork. Another review did
not report empirical assessments of the effectiveness of whole-school approaches delivered
by non-clinical staff [35]. However, it emphasized the importance of teachers’ cultural
competence and community engagement in addressing the needs of trauma-exposed stu-
dents in schools. All reviewed studies focused on teachers’ professional development and
cultural competence, but they did not study students’ wellbeing or academic performance
as effectiveness outcomes. Finally, the review by Ohrt et al. [34] concluded that most of the
teacher training programs were successful in increasing knowledge about mental health
among teachers; some studies in the review also found improvement in teachers’ ability to
intervene and refer students to appropriate services.

We could not ﬁnd studies on the effectiveness of classroom-based interventions in
enhancing peer relations or social support among refugee or migrant youth, using men-
tal health or wellbeing as effectiveness criteria. According to a systematic review, peer-
facilitated community-based intervention trials in low- and middle-income countries have
shown mixed results [41]. Yet, there is some promising evidence to support the effective-
ness of working with peer facilitators to improve adolescent mental health. Fifteen out
of 20 studies in the review were conducted at schools or a college, and ﬁve in commu-
nity settings, which may indicate the importance of supportive peer work, especially in a
classroom context.

In sum, there is lack of research studying the effects of school-based interventions,
focusing either on teacher competence or peer relations, on adolescents’ wellbeing. This
is especially true concerning the samples with native and immigrant students. In this
study, we aim to ﬁnd out whether interventions that aim to improve teachers’ competence

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

and self-efﬁcacy or peer relations among students in diverse classrooms are effective in
supporting students’ mental health.

4. Study Aims

The ﬁrst aim of our study was to examine whether two school-based psychosocial
interventions are effective in improving the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of
adolescents. The interventions were: (a) In-service teacher training (INSETT) and (b) peer
integration and enhancement resource (PIER). Their effectiveness was evaluated separately
among Finnish-born students and immigrant students (with immigrant or refugee back-
grounds). The criteria for the interventions’ effectiveness were reduced mental health
problems, i.e., internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and increased resilience and
prosocial behavior (i.e., factors promoting psychosocial wellbeing). We hypothesized that
internalizing and externalizing problems would decrease statistically signiﬁcantly among
adolescents participating in INSETT and PIER interventions. Likewise, we hypothesized
that prosocial behavior and resilience would increase among adolescents participating
in INSETT and PIER interventions during the measurement period. Furthermore, we
expected that in the control group the levels of internalizing and externalizing problems,
prosocial behavior, and resilience would remain unchanged. The timeline was from base-
line (T1), through post-intervention at six months (T2), to follow-up at 12 months (T3). The
second aim was to explore whether the interventions had different impacts on immigrant
vs. Finnish-born students, and whether gender, age, socioeconomic daily stressors, or
discrimination experiences were associated with intervention effectiveness (i.e., affected
the decrease in problems and increase in resources from T1 through T2 to T3).

5. Materials and Methods
5.1. Study Setting and Data Collection

The study was a three-arm clustered parallel assignment, quasi-randomized, con-
trolled trial (RCT) comparing INSETT and PIER intervention groups to the waitlist control
group. The recruitment of intervention schools was based on three principles. First, schools
participated voluntarily—in other words, the schools (i.e., their headmasters and teachers)
expressed a self-deﬁned need for an intervention to improve the wellbeing of refugee and
immigrant students, to promote more positive interethnic peer relations, or to increase
teachers’ multicultural awareness. Second, schools had a considerable share of students
from refugee and immigrant backgrounds, estimated as 30–50 percent in each class. Third,
the schools accepted the possibility of serving as a waitlist control school until the next
school year when they would be provided the INSETT intervention in an electronic form.
The recruitment commenced by sending emails to Finnish secondary schools through
mailing lists and by advertising the study in a teachers’ vocational magazine. The ﬁrst
wave of recruitment was complemented with around 100 phone calls to headmasters of
schools residing in the metropolitan or other immigrant-dense areas in larger Finnish cities.
In the second wave of recruitment, schools that were located near asylum centers were
approached by phone calls and e-mail communications. The only exclusion criterion for
schools was having other similar psychosocial interventions running at the same time. The
schools that enrolled in the study were located across Finland, and they represent mainly
refugee- and immigrant-dense urban areas. One school was in the south (the metropolitan
area), two located in the west, three in the east, three in the north, and seven in the center
of Finland.

The 16 schools were randomized in a parallel-group condition with an allocation
ratio of 1:1:1. The voluntary schools were ﬁrst grouped based on whether they offered
an introductory class for newly arrived students or not. The schools in the two groups
were then randomly allocated to either intervention or control conditions using a random
number generator by StatsDirect [42]. The allocation aimed at equal numbers of schools in
each condition. Due to the low participation rate, recruitment of schools continued, which
resulted in three additional schools, all with introductory classes. The three additional

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

schools were thus randomized either into the INSETT or control group. Following the
randomization, eight schools were allocated into the INSETT intervention, three schools
were allocated to PIER, and ﬁve schools served as waiting-list controls.

Figure 1 presents the data collection time frame and numbers. Baseline data were
collected mainly before the implementation of the INSETT and PIER interventions between
August 2019 and January 2020. The post-intervention (T2) data collection took place from
February (9th grade) to May 2020 and the follow-up (T3) data from May (9th grade) to
October 2020. Adolescents responded online to the questionnaires in their mother tongue,
guided at baseline by researchers and teachers in classrooms. Due to the COVID-19 school
closures, the T2 and T3 data collections were guided online. To secure anonymity, a secure
online survey tool (Lime Survey GmbH) was used, and all identiﬁable information was
stored separately from the research data. To avoid attrition in the post-intervention (T2) and
follow-up (T3) surveys, students received a personal invitation and two reminder letters via
e-mail. For students, there were no exclusion criteria and all signing the informed consent
could participate. Online INSETT teacher training material was provided to waiting-list
control schools in January 2021.

5.2. Sample Characteristics

In recruitment, school authorities estimated the number of students and the proportion
of foreign-born students in all participating classes. Schools do not have information on
the migration backgrounds of students. Hence, the categorization is based on self-reported
reason for migration and country of origin. We invited all children in schools to participate.
The actual number of students that were invited to participate in the study was 3062,
with 19% being students with immigrant backgrounds. Yet, 1974 students, of whom 223
were foreign-born and 1770 Finnish-born secondary school students (aged 12–17 years),
answered the baseline (T1) questionnaire. While over two-thirds (71%) of the invited

Finnish-born students participated, refusal among immigrant students was considerable;
only four out of ten (39%) participated. It is noteworthy that a total of 1441 students were
invited from INSETT schools, but only 70% of them ﬁlled in the baseline questionnaires and
could therefore be analyzed in the effectiveness study. Additionally, a total of 374 students
were invited from PIER schools, but only 81% of them ﬁlled in the baseline questionnaires
and could therefore be analyzed in the effectiveness study.

The attrition from baseline to T2 was approximately 31% among Finnish-born and
52% among foreign-born students in INSETT, 20% among Finnish-born and 41% among
foreign-born students in PIER, and 43% among Finnish-born and 39% among foreign-born
students in the control group. A quarter (27%) of teachers who participated in the INSETT
seminars, and half (50%) of teachers who participated in the PIER training, also participated
in the questionnaires.

5.3. The Interventions

In-service teacher training (INSETT) was developed by Lutine de Wal Pastoor at the
Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and is designed for lower
and upper secondary school teachers and counselors in introductory, preparatory, and
ordinary classes [43]. INSETT aims to strengthen teachers’ competence and self-efﬁcacy
in three areas. First, promoting refugee/migrant students’ mental health and psychoso-
cial wellbeing. Second, encouraging positive interethnic relationships and strengthening
school belonging. Third, fostering supportive interrelationships with parents, caregivers,
and/or guardians to promote school involvement [43]. The INSETT intervention consists
of three interrelated course modules. It combines lectures, group work, and exchange of
participants’ experiences, views, and reﬂections in two whole-day seminars with individu-
ally completed online training “sandwiched” between the two seminars (an introductory
seminar and a follow-up seminar, respectively). The INSETT intervention manual working
paper [43] introduces and elaborates on the aims and content of the intervention, and
describes the content of the seminars. The online teacher training course used in INSETT,
Providing support to refugee youth, developed by the Augeo Foundation in the Netherlands
(Augeo Academy) was translated into Finnish. The INSETT manual working paper [43]
includes a full manuscript and a PowerPoint presentation for the lecture “Young refugees’
psychosocial challenges upon resettlement: the need for a refugee-competent school”. For
implementation in the RefugeesWellSchool project, additional PowerPoint presentations
were developed on two topics suggested in the INSETT manual working paper but for
which the manual does not include manuscripts, i.e., cultural competence and trauma
impact and stabilization.

Peer integration and enhancement resource (PIER) was designed by Charles Watters
and Emma Soye at the University of Sussex [44]. PIER aims at supporting safe and
positive peer interactions and social relationships in multiethnic schools. This is expected
to occur through group exercises that focus on strengthening belonging, empathy, and
role-taking; learning from each other; and giving and receiving more social support. The
manualized intervention consists of eight sessions ranging from 45 to 90 min. Sessions
include structured welcoming and ending rituals and multimodal group activities such as
cartoon drawing, role-play, movies, and drama. Sessions also include processes of reﬂection
on various identities, migration, and racism. The group facilitators were secondary school
teachers, and they delivered the PIER intervention in classes including both Finnish-born
and refugee and immigrant students. The PIER facilitators participated in a two-day
training. The ﬁrst day consisted of practicing each intervention session together and
familiarizing teachers with the resource material through lectures and discussion. The
second day involved sharing experiences and valuable ideas to improve the intervention
as well as participation in focus group interviews.

5.4. Intervention Dosage

In two schools, all teachers participated in both INSETT seminars, which were or-
ganized in the school facilities. In the remaining six schools, only interested teachers
participated in the INSETT seminars, which were organized in two towns in Finland. In
the PIER intervention schools, the teachers participated in the PIER training organized
collectively for all schools across Finland. The 16 schools that participated the study had
in total 452 teachers, of which 252 were in the INSETT schools, and 81 were in the PIER
schools. Altogether, 98 teachers participated in the ﬁrst INSETT seminar, and 82 in the
second. Only 12 teachers completed the Augeo online course. Regarding the PIER in-
tervention, 16 teachers participated in the training and nine of them participated in the
feedback session. Teachers facilitating the PIER intervention were asked to ﬁll in structured
intervention protocols and to keep a log of the tools and methods they had carried out
in the class. The protocols were used to monitor the implementation process. The PIER
intervention also included a logbook to measure implementation ﬁdelity. Unfortunately,
only one-third of the teachers returned the logbooks. Six teachers participated in the PIER
feedback session.

5.5. Ethical Considerations

The study was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN64245549) and the study protocol was
published before the data analysis [45]. The ﬁnal study reported in this article differs from
the research protocol in two ways: First, due to a very small sample size of third intervention
teaching recovery techniques (TRTs), we are not able to provide a quantitative analysis of
the intervention (including the outcome post-traumatic stress symptoms. Second, because
of the low response rate of teachers in the INSETT intervention and immigrant students
in the PIER intervention we are not able to analyze the mediators of these interventions.
The Ethics Committee for Human Sciences of Tampere University reviewed and approved
the study setting, recruitment, informed consents, and measurement (Code #9/3/2019) in
addition to the Horizon 2020 Ethical Review. The Horizon 2020 research team prepared
informed consent documents in 18 languages, which guaranteed that all students and
parents were informed about the project and their participation rights. Informed consent
was obtained from all study participants and the translations offered the participants the
possibility of signing the agreement in their mother tongue. The informed consent signed
at T1 also included an agreement for participation at T2 and T3. The project complies with
the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its
later amendments). In addition to the two Ethics Committee approvals, we requested and
obtained research permission for all participating schools from the municipality school
administration and the headmasters.

5.6. Measures

Mental health problems were measured with a self-report version of the Strengths and
Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ) for 11–17-year-olds [46]. The SDQ has ﬁve subscales, each
with ﬁve items. Problems scales are Emotional problems (e.g., “I am often unhappy, sad or
tearful”), Conduct problems (e.g., “I get very angry and often lose my temper”), Inattention–
hyperactivity (e.g., “I am constantly ﬁdgeting or squirming”), and Peer problems (e.g., “I
am usually on my own”). The ﬁfth scale is called Prosocial behavior, reﬂecting strengths
(e.g., “I usually share with others (food, games, pens, etc.)). Adolescents responded using a
3-point scale on the extent to which they found the claim to be true (“not true”, “somewhat”
or “certainly true”).

For the current study, we calculated sum scores for internalizing Emotional problems
and Peer problems and externalizing Conduct problems and Inattention–hyperactivity.
Their Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients in the baseline were α = 0.77 and α = 0.77 for Finnish-
born students, and α = 0.71 and α = 0.67 for immigrant students, respectively. The alphas
for the post-intervention (T2) were α = 0.76 and α = 0.76 for Finnish-born, and α = 0.77 and
α = 0.70 for immigrant students. For follow-up (T3), they were α = 0.79 and α = 0.77 for

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

8 of 20

Finnish-born, and α = 0.78 and α = 0.78 for immigrant students. The alpha for Prosocial
behavior was at baseline α = 0.66 for Finnish-born students, and α = 0.68 for immigrant
students. In T2, it was α = 0.68 for Finnish-born, and α = 0.78 for immigrant students.
Finally, in T3, it was α = 0.66 for Finnish-born students, and α = 0.72 for immigrant students.
Research shows satisfying psychometric properties of the SDQ total score among
children and adolescents in different western countries, including Finland [47]. Among
immigrants, some researchers have recommended using the total SDQ score. Others have
recommended using the SDQ with caution among children and adolescents of refugee
background [48,49].

Resilience was measured with the 12-item reduced Child and Youth Resilience Measure
(CYRM-12) [50]. Being similar to the original 28-item CYRM, it measures individual,
relational, communal, and cultural resources that may bolster resilience among youth
between 9 and 23 years of age. Adolescents evaluated on a 5-point scale how well the
items described them (1 = “not at all”, 2 = “a little”, 3 = “somewhat”, 4 = “quite a bit”, and
5 = “a lot”). A total score was a sum score of the items, with a Cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient
of α = 0.85 for Finnish-born and α = 0.84 for immigrant students, at the baseline. In the
post-intervention, it was α = 0.85 for Finnish-born and α = 0.86 for immigrant students.
Finally, in the follow-up, α = 0.86 for Finnish-born students and α = 0.77 for immigrant
students. Research shows some content validity of the CYRM-12 to merit its use as a
screener for adolescents’ resilience processes [50].

Discrimination was measured with ﬁve dichotomous items asking whether the re-
spondent has experienced discrimination due to speciﬁc attributes (e.g., the color of their
skin, or being a refugee or immigrant). If one or more items included the response “yes”,
the respondent had a value “1” on the variable, otherwise “0”.

Daily stressors were measured with the 6-item Daily Stressors Scale for Young Refugees
(DSSYR; unpublished) [51]. The questions start with a common sentence “How often does
this happen?” and relate to having enough food, clothing, money, a place to live, enough
medical care, and safety. The adolescents assessed how often they experienced these
conditions (1 = “never”, 2 = “sometimes”, 3 = “often”, 4 = “always”, and 5 = “I do not
know/I do not want to answer”). The options from 1 to 4 were calculated into a sum score
and reversed so that a higher value refers to more stressors. The validity or reliability of
DSSYR has not yet been evaluated.

For demographic information and immigrant background, adolescents reported their
gender (boy, girl, other) and age (open response). The immigrant background was measured
with the following questions: Whether the student was born in Finland or not (yes/no),
the country of birth (open response), and reasons for immigration (ﬂeeing war, danger, or
persecution, parents’ permanent/temporary work, family reuniﬁcation). For the current
study, adolescents were categorized as Finnish-born or immigrants. The students were
classiﬁed in these groups based on their reports on their home country and reasons for
migration. In instances where the participant did not report the reason for migration
(n = 91 at T1, 59 at T2, and 52 at T3), information about their home country and statistics from
Finnish Immigration Services between 2015 and 2021 on residence permits (international
protection) and safety classiﬁcation on countries was used for the allocation.

5.7. Analysis

Data were collected in Lime Survey in a long form, i.e., each participant’s response
was unique. Participants received an identity number which then was used to combine
responses from different assessment points. Identity numbers in a data ﬁle were checked
manually for errors so that the correct responses from the same respondent were brought
together. Each timepoint was then merged one by one so that we ended up with wide
format data of three timepoints.

Due to a small number of participating schools, analyses were conducted between
students. The results were analyzed separately in the INSETT and PIER intervention
groups as well as in Finnish-born and immigrant students. The immigrant students include

both refugees and other immigrant students. However, the sample sizes in these separate
groups were so small that the results ought to be interpreted with caution. The results from
the PIER intervention are reported as one group of students because the sample size of
foreign-born students was too small for parametric analysis.

Due to the substantial range in the response times in each timepoint, we used the
growth curve model (GCM) with individually varying timepoints of observation (so-
called unstructured GCM) which is available in Mplus 8.0 software [52]. Due to varying
timepoints of observation, the unstructured GCM has produced less biased results in
several simulation studies [53–55]. The unstructured GCM is a multilevel model and also
allows taking clustering into account. The response times were coded as weeks from the
start of the data collection.

In the traditional GCM, the observed outcome variables in each timepoint have ﬁxed
loadings on two latent variables, i.e., intercept and slope. On the intercept, all the loadings
are ﬁxed on 1. On the slope variable, baseline response is ﬁxed on 0, and timepoints 2
and 3 are ﬁxed on values 1 and 2, assuming linear change. In the unstructured GCM,
however, the response time impacts all loadings. For instance, the later the response is
given, the lower/higher the level is assumed to be. It follows that the variance of the
outcome variables changes as a function of response time values [56]. This means that
there is no constant model implied matrix Σ to test the model ﬁt. Therefore, the chi-
square statistic cannot be calculated, and thus the traditional ﬁt statistics are not available.
Nevertheless, the unstructured GCM could be compared with the traditional GCM using
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) indices. In
most of the models, and especially in the migrant group, the unstructured model showed a
better ﬁt than the traditional GCM. The latent growth parameters were estimated using a
robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR), which allows the use of missing data without
any separate imputations and non-normal continuous indicators to be reliably analyzed.

6. Results
6.1. Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 shows the numbers of participants at baseline. Altogether, 995 students
participated in research in the INSETT intervention schools. Of the students, 89% were
Finnish-born and of them 49% were boys. Of 106 immigrant student participants in
the INSETT schools, 55% were boys. The mean age of the INSETT participants was
13.9 years among Finnish-born students and 14.5 years among immigrant students. Out of
731 participants in the INSETT control schools, 85% were Finnish-born and of them 48%
were boys. Out of 59 immigrant participants in the INSETT control schools, 49% were
boys. The mean age of the INSETT control participants was 13.9 years among Finnish-born
students, and 14.6 years among immigrant students.

Out of 108 participants in the PIER intervention, 86% were born in Finland, and of those,
51% were boys. Out of 15 immigrant students participating in the PIER intervention, nine
were boys. The mean age of the PIER participants was 13.6 among Finnish-born students
and 14.3 among immigrant students. Out of 187 participants in the PIER control group, 87%
were born in Finland, and of those, 42% were boys. Out of 24 immigrant participants in the
PIER control group, seven were boys. The mean age of the PIER control participants was
13.9 among Finnish-born students and 14.2 among immigrant students. The estimates for
all independent variables are shown in Table 2. The estimates for all dependent variables at
T1, T2, and T3 are shown in Table 3.

6.2. Intervention Effects

Table 4 shows the results regarding the INSETT intervention on mental health and
psychosocial wellbeing for Finnish-born students and Table 5 shows immigrant students.
Contrary to our hypothesis, the non-signiﬁcant direct intervention effects indicate that
externalizing or internalizing problems did not decrease, nor did resilience and prosocial
behavior increase among Finnish-born or immigrant students in the INSETT intervention
group.

Note: The results are based on latent growth analyses, where POST: Latent slope, PRE: Latent intercept, ON:
Regressed on, with: Covariance, n: Sample size, variable * variable: Interaction, β: Unstandardized regression
coefﬁcient, SE: Standardized error, p: p-value (<0.050 considered signiﬁcant and bolded for interactions indicating
results from moderation analyses).

Concerning our second, explorative research aim (whether gender, age, socioeconomic
daily stressors, or discrimination experiences were associated with intervention effective-
ness), the results show signiﬁcant moderating interaction effects among both Finnish-born
and immigrant student groups. Of background variables, the students’ age, daily stressors,
and discrimination experiences were associated with the INSETT intervention’s effective-
ness (indicated by decrease in externalizing and internalizing problems and increase in
prosocial behavior and resilience). However, the moderating effects were different among

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

Finnish-born and immigrant students. Among older Finnish-born students, the internaliz-
ing problems decreased signiﬁcantly more in the intervention than in the control group
(β = −0.014, p < 0.000 for age * intervention interaction). Among Finnish-born students
exposed to a high level of daily stressors, internalizing problems increased (β = 0.016,
p < 0.05 for daily stressors * intervention interaction), and among immigrant students ex-
posed to high levels of daily stressors, externalizing problems increased (β = 0.048, p < 0.000
for daily stressors * intervention interaction). Meanwhile, the same negative change was not
found in the control group. In the INSETT intervention group, prosocial behavior increased
among immigrant students who had high levels of discrimination experiences (β = 0.027,
p < 0.001 for discrimination experiences * intervention interaction), while prosocial behavior
decreased (β = −0.016, p < 0.05 for discrimination experiences * intervention interaction)
among Finnish-born students with high levels of discrimination experiences. Yet, among
immigrant students with high levels of discrimination experiences, externalizing symptoms
increased (β = 0.015, p < 0.05 for discrimination experiences * intervention interaction) in
the INSETT intervention. The intervention effectiveness was not dependent on gender.

6.3. PIER

As explained in the analysis section, the results from the PIER intervention are com-
bined across Finnish-born and immigrant students, due to a low number of participants.
The results in Table 6 reveal that, contrary to our hypothesis, the non-signiﬁcant direct
effects indicate that internalizing and externalizing problems did not decrease, nor did
resilience and prosocial behavior increase in the PIER intervention group. As the non-
signiﬁcant immigrant status * intervention interaction effects indicate, the PIER interven-
tion’s effectiveness did not differ between Finnish-born and immigrant students.

Of the moderating background variables, only adolescents’ age and gender, but not
discrimination experiences or daily stressors, were associated with the PIER interven-
tion’s effectiveness. Gender emerged as important for intervention effects on external-
izing symptoms and resilience, showing that the PIER intervention was not effective
among girls. On the contrary, among girls, externalizing symptoms increased (β = 0.010,
p < 0.01) and resilience decreased (β = −0.084, p < 0.05) in the intervention group, but
not in the control group (see Table 6, concerning gender * intervention interaction ef-
fects). Concerning age, internalizing (β = −0.018, p < 0.000) and externalizing (β= −0.015,
p < 0.01) symptoms decreased and resilience increased (β = 0.025, p < 0.000) signiﬁcantly
more in the intervention than in the control among older students.

7. Discussion

We sought to study whether two school-based psychosocial interventions are effective
in improving the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of secondary school students,
and whether the interventions had a different impact on immigrant vs. Finnish-born stu-
dents. We also explored the role of students’ background and socioeconomic stressors in
the interventions’ effectiveness. The results showed, unexpectedly, that neither the INSETT
nor the PIER interventions were generally effective in decreasing mental health problems
or increasing psychosocial resources. The expected positive ﬁndings were dependent on
students’ gender and age. The results also suggested that students’ daily stressors and
discrimination experiences can have a decisive inﬂuence on the interventions’ effective-
ness. Unfortunately, due to teachers’ low participation rate in INSETT and students’ low
participation in the PIER interventions, we were not able to study the mediation effects
as planned. This means that we cannot analyze whether the observed effects follow the
hypothesized paths from interventions to the increased cultural competence of teachers and
interethnic friendships of students’ and further to the better mental health and wellbeing
of students. Our results should be considered as rough indicators of the effectiveness of
school-based interventions among Finnish-born and immigrant secondary school students.
The positive effects of the interventions include the possible protective effect of the
INSETT intervention against internalizing problems among older Finnish-born students
and increasing prosocial behavior among immigrant students who are discriminated
against. It is possible that the enhancement in teachers’ competence and self-efﬁcacy
encouraged them to pay more attention to their students’ psychosocial- and mental health-
related challenges. Interestingly, the effect of age was evident only among Finnish-born
students, and the INSETT intervention had positive effects in especially high-risk groups
of immigrant students, i.e., those suffering from discrimination. The ﬁndings are important
since they suggest that intervention themes concerning multicultural peer relationships
and trauma-informed pedagogy are relevant not only for the wellbeing of immigrant
and refugee students, but for the wellbeing of all students. Although the main aim of
the INSETT intervention was to promote psychosocial support and social cohesion for
immigrant and refugee adolescents through teachers’ education, there may have been a
more general change in teachers’ diversity competence in the school environment, which
had an effect on the wellbeing of older students and those with discrimination risks.

Some positive effects were also found concerning the PIER intervention, yet they
depended on students’ gender and age. Results show that internalizing and externalizing
problems decreased, and resilience increased in the intervention among older students
participating in the PIER intervention, but not in the control group. In other words, older
students and boys particularly beneﬁted from the PIER intervention, compared to girls
and younger students. Adolescence is a time of intensive changes in peer relationships,
worldview, and identity formation (4), and it is possible that the older students found it
easier to absorb the intervention material relating to safe and positive peer interactions.
Improved mental health in multiethnic schools may reﬂect the core aims of the PIER inter-
vention, which include a sense of belonging, empathy, curiosity to different experiences,
and providing social support to others. Due to a low number of participants, we were

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

unfortunately not able to examine the effects separately for Finnish-born and migrant
students.

Our results further showed that neither the INSETT nor the PIER interventions were
effective in improving mental health among adolescents who experienced severe daily
stressors, such as not having enough food, clothing, or safety. On the contrary, in the
INSETT intervention, externalizing symptoms increased among students with severe daily
stress more than in the control group. Similarly, prosocial behavior decreased in the
INSETT intervention among Finnish-born students who had discrimination experiences.
It is possible that teachers’ multicultural competence or self-efﬁcacy did not improve in
a way that would have helped highly stressed and discriminated against adolescents to
beneﬁt from their new methods in the classroom, but rather vice versa.

Like other intervention studies among war-affected adolescents [57], our results show
gender differences. The PIER intervention seems to be somewhat ineffective among girls, as
their externalizing problems increased and resilience decreased in the intervention but not
in the control group. We could not ﬁnd an earlier explanation for gender differences from
the literature, but a very preliminary interpretation could be that the “free” curriculum
activities and the concomitant possibility of losing behavioral boundaries as part of the
PIER intervention may not suit girls, causing externalizing symptoms in particular to
increase.

The limits of our study concur with the critics of earlier ﬁndings of psychosocial
school-based interventions. Both Paulus et al. [33] and Goldberg et al. [29] argued that
whole-school interventions struggle to show effectiveness partly because of the challenges
of intervention design and successful data collection. In our study too, the initial research
aims of searching the mediating mechanisms and analyzing all three levels of interventions
were not fulﬁlled. Cipriano et al. [58] suggested that educational interventions targeting
classroom processes should be enacted at the school level and assessed by both teachers
and students to capture the breadth of perceptions, and to optimize outcomes among
adolescents. Furthermore, only 39% of the immigrant students we contacted were willing
to participate in the study, which makes it difﬁcult to generalize the ﬁndings outside the
population in this trial. This sets clear standards for future research.

In our study, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic during the post-intervention
and follow-up assessments posed additional challenges for these endeavors. Teachers’
response rate to the baseline survey was dramatically low, and we could not analyze their
data. The absence of their data is unfortunate but not surprising according to previous

among teachers. We could not obtain satisfactory reports from all teachers of how the
interventions were implemented in the classroom. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this is
quite understandable since the teachers struggled with all kinds of extra demands in their
everyday schoolwork. Additionally, the percentage of immigrant students who participated
in the study should have been more in order to make strong implications on the differences
between the students with different backgrounds. Having more resources to ensure the
participation of immigrant students should be taken into consideration in future research.
Luckily we were able to report the qualitative results of TRT, and teachers’ and parents’
insight of the interventions for the whole RefugeeWellSchool program in the effectiveness
report [60]. We can only speculate on the other effects COVID-19 might have had on our
results. Finally, study designs can be further reﬁned in trials like this. In the current study,
blinding of participants, intervention providers, outcome assessors, or data analysts was
not possible due to the explicit nature of the interventions and the low number of research
staff.

8. Conclusions

The positive effects of interventions in this study were dependent on students’ charac-
teristics such as gender, age, exposure to daily stressors, and their discrimination experi-
ences. This means that tailored help is needed in order to support adolescents’ wellbeing

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3686

at schools. Future studies should continue to search for critical factors that affect the
suitability of the interventions for adolescents with different backgrounds. A multilay-
ered intervention study with voluntary participation can be difﬁcult to conduct with the
requirements of a randomized controlled trial. Our study shows that to some extent the
experimental setting is still achievable. We did not ﬁnd evidence for teacher- or peer-related
programs increasing students’ wellbeing at school. It is, however, possible that in some
circumstances and among some student groups these interventions might be effective,
indicated by gender- and age-speciﬁc effects, as well as the role of students’ daily stressors
and discrimination experiences in the interventions’ effectiveness.
