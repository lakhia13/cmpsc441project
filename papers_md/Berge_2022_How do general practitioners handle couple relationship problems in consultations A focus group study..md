Background: Couple relationship problems are common and associated with health problems. The aim of this study was to explore general 
practitioners’ (GPs’) experiences, expectations, and educational needs when dealing with couple relationship problems in consultations.

Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study by carrying out 3 semistructured focus group interviews with 18 GPs. We used sys-
tematic text condensation for the analyses.

Results: Participants shared their experiences of handling couple relationship problems in consultations. Three main themes emerged: (i) prag-
matic  case-finding:  golden  opportunities  to  reveal  patients’  couple  relationship  problems;  (ii)  conceptual  and  role  confusion;  (iii)  professional 
competence and personal experience. While issues in relationships could serve as an explanation for relevant clinical problems, some GPs ques-
tioned whether relationship issues are strictly medical. All participants had engaged in individual supportive therapy, but none saw themselves as 
therapists. The interviews revealed that an individual supportive focus might lead to a consolidation of 1 partner’s view, rather than challenging 
their position. Long-term doctor–patient relationships made it easier to talk about these issues.

Conclusions: This study revealed several paradoxes. GPs are confident in offering individual supportive therapy for couple relationship issues but 
should be aware of substantial pitfalls such as side-taking and constraining change. Despite dealing with relationship problems, GPs do not see 
themselves as therapists. They use professional and personal experience but would benefit from increasing their skills in cognitive restructuring 
promoting behavioural flexibility facing relationship problems.

Lay summary 
Couple relationship problems are common and often raised in general practitioner (GP) consultations as they are associated with health prob-
lems. We lack knowledge about what experiences, expectations, and educational needs GPs have when dealing with these problems. In 2020, 
we interviewed 18 GPs about how they handle couple relationship problems in their practice. Three main themes emerged: (i) Patients seldom 
present their relationship as the main problem. GPs conduct pragmatic case-finding to reveal relational problems that might be connected to, 
or be a risk factor for, health problems. (ii) GPs deal with couple relationship problems in several ways. Some think that they are not a medical 
problem, while others take a more holistic approach. In both cases, GPs lack the tools to assess couple relationship problems and to offer brief 
interventions. (iii) The most experienced doctors emphasized that their professional and personal experience qualified them to support their pa-
tients. Continuity in the doctor–patient relationship was also considered important. We revealed that taking a biopsychosocial approach can be 
challenged by searching for biomedical causes for problems. GPs should be aware of the pitfalls of individual supportive therapy in dealing with 
couple relationship issues, such as taking sides and impeding change.

Background
Couple  relationship  satisfaction  is  related  to  physical  and 
mental health and longevity,1 and is more important for life 
quality  than  job  satisfaction  and  friendships.2  Children’s 
physical and mental health are also affected by their parents’ 
relationship quality.3

Less  than  half  of  individuals  experiencing  divorce  seek 
marital  therapy  before  separation.4  Couples  therapy  and 
couple relationship education (CRE) are the main sources of 
help-seeking for couples. Their efficacy is well known but both 
reach  a  limited  and  resourceful  section  of  the  population.4 
Brief interventions (BIs) are instructions in daily interactions 
between the partners which are uncomplicated to implement. 
They are as effective as traditional CRE and easily accessible.5 

Daily gratitude or appreciation, doing activities together, and 
turning towards bids for connection are examples of BIs.5 A 
bid  for  connection  is  anything  you  or  your  partner  does  to 
connect with the other. Examples of bids are sending a text, 
giving a kiss, stopping what you do to greet your partner at 
the door, or sharing their day.

A  mental  health  problem  is  brought  up  in  1  of  4  general 
practitioner  (GP)  consultations.  This  includes  relationship 
problems in general, and couple relationship problems in par-
ticular.6 Family and partner conflicts are a significant propor-
tion of consultations with psychosocial themes.7

In a Norwegian survey, 1 in 4 patients had talked to their 
GP about couple relationship issues, one-third wanted to talk 
with  their  GP,  and  almost  half  of  the  patients  wanted  their

Key messages

 •  Couple relationship problems are often presented as health problems.
 •  GPs take a holistic approach in dealing with couple relationship problems.
 •  GPs face a dilemma between offering empathic support and challenging their patients.
 •  Doctors lack tools to assess couple relationships and offer counselling.
 •  Doctor–patient continuity gives GPs confidence in handling relationship problems.

GP to take an interest in their couple relationship.8 Another 
Norwegian study on expectations from patients and GPs re-
garding health care-seeking behaviour showed similar results. 
Almost one-third of patients thought that most patients would 
arrange to see their GP when having relationship problems.9
GPs  do  not  feel  competent  to  counsel  relationship  prob-
lems in general and need additional training regarding rela-
tionship  management.10  On  the  other  hand,  with  adequate 
training they could include couples counselling in their prac-
tice, particularly to identify couples in crisis, and to provide 
preventive  strategies  to  improve  marital  satisfaction.11  A 
study on marital satisfaction from American primary health 
care proposed that a 1-item question with a visual analogue 
scale (VAS) could be as useful as a 32-item screening tool in 
primary care.12

GPs’ experiences of dealing with couple relationship prob-
lems among their patients are largely unknown. Do they ex-
pect to have a role in handling such problems, and if so, do 
they feel competent to do it?

The aim of this study was to explore GPs’ experiences, ex-
pectations, and educational needs when dealing with couple 
relationship problems in consultations.

Methods
Study design and recruitment
We  carried  out  an  exploratory  qualitative  study  using  a 
sample of GPs from Norway. We used social media and our 
professional network to recruit participants. We sought max-
imum variation in terms of sex, age, urban and rural location, 
and years in practice. Twenty-six GPs were approached, and 
18 accepted the invitation to participate.

A  focus  group  design  was  chosen  to  produce  data  based 
on the interactions between the participants that would not 
be possible to get from individual interviews.13 The group dy-
namic often contributes to a wider range of perspectives and 
ideas. Experiences from other participants often inspire new 
associations leading to richer information from focus groups 
compared to the sum of individual interviews. Some studies 
have found that individual interviews produce more sensitive 
themes than focus groups, while others have found opposite.14

Data collection
We  conducted  3  semistructured  focus  group  interviews  be-
tween June and October 2020. The interviews were conducted 
and video-recorded by 2 researchers (SDB and TM) using the 
digital  platform  Zoom  because  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic. 
Each  interview  lasted  90  min.  SDB  facilitated  the  groups, 
while TM observed. Both researchers took field notes during 
the interviews and discussed their immediate impressions after 
each interview ended. We developed and used a semistructured 
and flexible interview guide as shown in Box 1.

Each group consisted of 6 GPs mainly with an established 
relation  to  each  other.  The  first  group  consisted  mostly  of 
GPs specializing in general practice and was well established 
with regularly meetings. In the second group, all participants 
were approved specialists with a long experience from general 
practice. The  last  group  consisted  of  5  experienced  GP  spe-
cialists and 1 in GP training.

Sample size should be guided by information power as de-
scribed by Malterud,15 and this is typically met by 2–5 focus 
groups.16

Data analysis
The  video  files  were  transcribed  verbatim  by  SDB  and  im-
ported  into  the  qualitative  analysis  software  NVIVO12. We 
used systematic text condensation for the analysis.17 The ana-
lysis was explorative and not based on any existing theoret-
ical  framework,  although  the  researchers  are  GPs  and  take 
a biopsychosocial approach in their respective practices. All 
4  authors  participated  in  the  analysis.  First,  we  established 
an overview of the data with an open mind to get a general 
impression. Then we agreed on preliminary themes for organ-
izing the data and identified meaning units sorted into code 
groups.  We  developed  codes  for  each  theme  in  an  iterative 
process until agreeing on the final themes for describing the 
data (Table 1). The third step of the analysis was to merge the 
meaning units and reduce the content of every subgroup into 
condensates. At last, we recontextualized the data and devel-
oped descriptions and concepts.

Results
Eighteen  GPs  from  16  different  practices  participated  in  3 
focus groups with 6 participants in each group. Characteristics 
of the participants are presented in Table 2.

All participants reported numerous experiences of handling 
couple  relationship  problems  in  their  practice.  None  of  the 
physicians had a special interest in couple relationship prob-
lems, nor were they trained in couples counselling techniques. 
Three  main  themes  emerged:  (i)  pragmatic  case-finding: 
golden  opportunities  to  reveal  patients’  couple  relationship 
problems; (ii) conceptual and role confusion; (iii) professional 
competence and personal experience.

Pragmatic case-finding: golden opportunities to 
reveal patients’ couple relationship problems
The participants rarely identified couple relationship problems as 
the reason for a patient encounter, but these problems emerged 
during a holistic approach to the patient. They highlighted that 
GPs should ask about their patients’ couple relationships more 
often, invite patients to talk about their relationship issues to re-
veal problems earlier, and be able to do preventive work. Golden 
opportunities  to  ask  about  patients’  relationships  as  a  way  of 
revealing couple relationship problems were mentioned.

The  patients’  presenting  problems  were,  according  to 
the  GPs,  often  pain  conditions,  tiredness,  or  troubled  sleep. 
There  are  different  approaches  to  such  conditions,  and  the 
GPs made a point of looking for underlying causes, and being 
open to biomedical, psychological, social, and existential ex-
planations,  including  couple  relationship  problems.  At  the 
same  time,  they  often  failed  to  address  this  issue  and  often 
focussed only on the presenting problem itself. The GPs had 
the impression that patients were often in need of a period of 
sick leave when going through a divorce.

Asking  about  social  networks  and  couple  relationships 
in patients with a chronic or severe illness was emphasized. 
Such  illnesses  included  psychiatric  problems,  unexplained 
symptoms, or sexually transmitted infections. Elderly patients 
were  especially  identified  as  vulnerable  to  couple  relation-
ship problems, because of well-known risk factors including 
chronic  disease  and  cognitive  impairment  which  are  more 
common in this group. The doctors reported elderly patients 
who  were  unsure  whether  it  was  appropriate  for  them  to 
start a new relationship when their spouse did not recognize 
them anymore. They also reported older people bringing up

couple  relationship  issues  such  as  domestic  violence,  sexual 
problems, and the experience of divorced patients being old 
and alone. Hence, routine check-ups for patients with chronic 
disease and/or elderly patients were seen as golden opportun-
ities to talk about the patients’ couple relationships.

Addressing sexual health issues with both genders and at 
any age was a part of couple relationship problems the par-
ticipants felt competent about. There was a tendency for fe-
male doctors to more frequently experience this issue being 
brought up by their female patients, while male participants 
more  often  heard  their  male  patients’  queries  about  sexual 
problems. Everyone considered this an obvious task for a GP 
and  a  golden  opportunity  to  ask  more  questions  about  the 
couple relationship.

For younger patients, the importance of being an advocate 
for the children in a family and promoting awareness of how 
the children might be feeling was highlighted. It was empha-
sized how parental conflicts affect children. Some had invited 
parents to reflect on how their children would be affected by 
their parents’ relationship problems and used the children as 
a pathway to talk about the patients’ relationships.

Pregnancy  check-ups  is  a  part  of  a  GPs  regular  work  in 
Norway.  Most  pregnant  women  are  seeing  their  GP  during 
pregnancy, and 6 weeks after giving birth. Hence, pregnancy 
check-ups were seen as a golden opportunity to ask about the 
patient’s couple relationship.

The  first  encounter  with  a  new  patient  is  often  utilized  to 
get to know him or her by asking about medical history and 
risk factors such as smoking and other lifestyle issues. This was 
highlighted as a golden opportunity to ask about marital status 
and 1 or more questions about the patient’s couple relationship.

Conceptual and role confusion
The  GPs  discussed  whether  couple  relationship  problems 
should be an issue of concern in consultations. We revealed 
an  uncertainty,  in  that  some  GPs  wondered  if  relationship 

problems were “medicine” or “just life,” as a way of asking 
if  this  kind  of  issues  are  something  a  GP  should  devote 
valuable  consultation  time  to.  Others  stated  that  all  rela-
tionships, especially couple relationships, were important to 
health.  These  informants  also  emphasized  the  importance 
of a holistic approach to their patients’ symptoms and life 
challenges.

Some of the less experienced doctors said that they would 
embrace this issue, in addition to all the other tasks in general 
practice, if research could convince them that relational prob-
lems  are  indeed  important  for  health.  During  the  interview, 
the less experienced GPs in general seemed to have a stronger 
biomedical  focus  and  less  holistic  perspectives  on  patients’ 
medical problems and health.

When GPs were behind schedule, it was common for them 
not to ask about couple relationship problems, despite their 
awareness of taking the recommended holistic approach. One 
way  to  deal  with  time  limitations  was  to  acknowledge  the 
problem  and  schedule  a  lengthier  consultation  towards  the 
end of a workday. The option of referring couples with prob-
lems to the Family Welfare Service were appreciated. Several 
participants called for tools to assess relationships and to help 
them offer counselling.

Everyone had experience of talking with patients individu-
ally about their couple relationship problems, but only a few 
had  talked  with  patients  as  a  couple. There  was  a  common 
opinion  that  GPs  should  not  act  as  psychotherapists  prac-
ticing couples therapy unless they were especially interested 
and qualified. However, all the GPs offered support to their 
patients,  and  most  of  them  pointed  out  that  this  is  an  im-
portant part of the GP’s holistic approach. Paradoxically, the 
GPs did not see this support as therapy.

The  GPs  had  the  impression  that  patients  expected  them 
to be supportive—and they were aware that this could be a 
problem  when  both  partners  in  a  couple  attended  the  same 
physician. Some reported difficulties in being impartial with 
both partners, to avoid the appearance of taking sides. An in-
dividual supportive focus could lead to the consolidation of 1 
partner’s point of view, rather than challenging their position 
and helping them to see their problems from a more neutral 
perspective.

Others saw it as an advantage to be both partners’ GP be-
cause it made it easier to see the whole picture and challenge 
their views on the situation. Some emphasized that in medical 
education doctors learn communication skills useful for indi-
vidual consultations, but not systemic counselling skills.

Professional competence and personal experience
The GPs in the focus groups had different amounts of training 
in psychotherapy. Several of the participants had competence 
in cognitive therapy techniques and restructuring. They used 
this  competence  mostly  in  individual  consultations,  but  a 
few  of  the  participants  had  tried  dyadic  consultations  with 
couples.  This  cognitive  approach  could  both  challenge  and 
equip  patients.  It  was  described  as  a  useful  tool  that  could 
contribute in a more constructive way dealing with relation-
ship problems.

A continuous doctor–patient relationship was described as 
important  in  enabling  patients  to  talk  with  their  GP  about 
couple  relationship  issues. The  participants  had  the  impres-
sion that frequent changes of GPs made patients feel less safe 
in opening up about vulnerable issues and feelings of shame

could become a hampering factor. Shame was brought up by 
the participants as both a hindrance and a facilitator, and they 
experienced  that  it  affected  whether  their  patients  chose  to 
talk with them about their couple relationships. Sometimes, 
according to the participating GPs, shame prevented patients 
from confiding in friends and encouraged them to open up to 
their GP instead.

The  experienced  doctors  felt  more  comfortable  talking 
about couple relationships compared to younger doctors. The 
most experienced emphasized that it was mainly their profes-
sional experience, but also, to a certain extent, their personal 
experience that qualified them to support patients with couple 
relationship  problems.  Patients  brought  the  subject  up  more 
often now than they could recall from earlier in their GP career.
One participant mentioned that negative personal experi-
ences could activate vulnerable emotions when talking with 
patients about couple relationship problems.

The GPs saw themselves as a medical facility easy to con-
tact and attend, and they wanted to be supportive and under-
standing. They often took on the role of being a moderator, 
a sparring partner, or, as one of the participants described it, 
a dumping ground for negative emotions. Others saw them-
selves as an impartial and independent third party who cre-
ated a safe zone for patients to talk.

The informants felt that patients expected them to take a 
holistic approach, and to be competent in talking about most 
topics.  One  of  the  GPs  stated  that  patients  do  not  expect  a 
solution, just someone impartial to talk to.

Discussion
Summary of key findings
The  participating  GPs  reported  numerous  experiences  of 
handling  couple  relationship  problems  in  their  practice. We 
identified  3  main  themes:  (i)  pragmatic  case-finding:  golden 
opportunities  to  reveal  patients’  couple  relationship  prob-
lems;  (ii)  conceptual  and  role  confusion;  (iii)  professional 
competence and personal experience.

Comparison with existing literature
Pragmatic  case-finding  is  a  well-known  strategy  in  general 
practice to reveal health problems among patients.18 A study 
on  how  GPs  talk  about  alcohol  found  that  the  duality  be-
tween shame and normality, time constraints and a need for 
structure were the most important barriers.19 This correlates 
with our findings regarding couple relationship issues: shame 
and  time  constraints  were  barriers,  while  routine  check-ups 
and pregnancy check-ups were seen as opportunities to bring 
up the topic.

The biopsychosocial model20 is understood as the leading 
framework  for  general  practice  in  recent  decades,21  but  it 
has  been  claimed  that  this  is  more  of  an  academic  model 
than  actually  fully  implemented  in  clinical  general  prac-
tice.22 Our study revealed that a dilemma still exists between 
being  a  doctor  who  is  responsible  for  finding  biomedical 
explanations for symptoms and being a doctor who experi-
ences  that  symptoms  frequently  need  to  be  explained  by 
the integration of relational and psychological factors. This 
is  in  line  with  knowledge  that  chronic  shame,  relational 
problems,  and  negative  emotions  cause  prolonged  stress 
in  the  body,  which  influences  physiological  systems,  such 
as  the  immune  and  cardiovascular  systems.1,23  There  was 

a  tendency  that  less  experienced  GPs  had  a  stronger  bio-
medical perspective than their more experienced colleagues. 
This might reflect that medical education still has a strong 
biomedical focus.

The GPs in our study were not comfortable with the label 
of therapist, as in psychotherapist or couples therapist, even 
though acting as a doctor in relationship with a patient is con-
sidered a therapeutic act.24 Is there a conflict between being 
a  GP  and  a  therapist? A  therapeutic  relationship  between  a 
physician and a patient is important.25 Many GPs, including 
some of our participants, are educated in cognitive therapy,26 
but they seldom talked with patients as couples, rather they 
had consultations with 1 patient at a time. Supportive therapy 
is widely used by GPs,27 and the most important element is the 
therapeutic alliance.28 It is possible that supportive therapy is 
so deeply integrated into the GPs’ professional skills that they 
are not aware that they offer therapy. By this conceptual con-
fusion,  a “blind  spot”  might  be  introduced  in  their  clinical 
practice. Supportive consultations are by many considered as 
therapy.28

Individual counselling for couple relationship problems is 
known to have several pitfalls, such as constraining change, 
therapist side-taking, and inaccurate assessments based on in-
dividual client reports.29 The GPs we interviewed were aware 
of  the  risk  of  taking  sides.  Applying  individual  supportive 
therapy on couple relationship problems generates a risk of 
reinforcing 1 patient’s negative emotions about their partner 
and could indirectly increase the risk of divorce.29 When en-
gaged in supportive therapy, it is important to challenge, ra-
ther than just please, the patient. Increasing skills in systemic 
approaches could be beneficial in this context.30 Nevertheless, 
the effect of such interventions depends on the GP’s ability to 
enhance function while empowering the patient, not consoli-
dating the patient’s problems, and making them pitiable.

With  the  international  campaign  of  overdiagnosis  named 
“Too much medicine”31 in mind, GPs should be aware of the 
risk  of  medicalization  of  normal  life  events  such  as  couple 
relationship  problems.  On  the  other  hand,  overdiagnosis  is 
defined as the diagnosis of a condition that, if unrecognized, 
would  not  cause  symptoms  or  harm  a  patient  during  their 
lifetime.31 It is well known that couple relationship problems 
can  cause  various  health  problems  and  are  an  independent 
risk factor for disease.

Our participants wanted tools to assess and engage in BIs. 
Assessing  tools  are  available  but  require  further  validation 
in general practice, such as 1 or a few questions to identify 
patients  with  couple  relationship  problems.12,32  GPs  could 
easily  teach  BIs.5 This  could  even  save  consultation  time  in 
a  long  term  because  patients  get  a  manageable  tool.  Giving 
psychoeducation  about  typical  relational  patterns  could  in-
crease the patient’s understanding of the problem. Challenging 
the patient to take his or her partner’s perspective could in-
crease the understanding of the situation even more.5,33

Continuity in clinical relationships is an important tool for 
the GP, is vital in person-centred care, and is recently shown to 
be significantly associated with reduced need for out-of-hours 
services, acute hospital admissions, and mortality in a dose-
dependent  way.34  Since  2001,  every  inhabitant  in  Norway 
can actively choose their own regular GP, and more than half 
state that it is important to keep a GP they already know.34 A 
continuous relationship between a regular GP and a patient 
will  most  often  be  of  good  quality  because  the  patients  ac-
tively choose their own regular GP. The experienced GPs with 

918

longer doctor–patient relationships more often talked about 
relational problems with their patients. The continuity of the 
GP–patient  relationship  is  nowadays  threatened  because  of 
the current crisis in general practice in several countries.35–37

To be a good doctor, academic and professional skills are 
important, but equally important are the doctor’s personal 
qualities.38  Our  informants  lacked  professional  training  in 
couples counselling but underlined the professional and per-
sonal experience they developed over time and saw this as 
a  useful  tool  in  their  toolbox  when  helping  patients  with 
couple  relationship  problems.  However,  our  data  revealed 
large  variations  in  doctors’  own  understanding  of  their 
role: from being a dumping ground to engaging in cognitive 
restructuring.

Strengths and limitations
The  internal  validity  was  strengthened  by  the  participants’ 
and  the  researchers’  common  background  as  GPs. This  en-
hanced the mutual understanding of which questions the dis-
cussion was going to answer and facilitated a safe place for 
the conversation because the participants shared common ex-
periences from being a GP.

The GPs felt secure enough to discuss topics that exposed 
their  own  vulnerabilities.  They  commented  on  each  other’s 
experiences  and  expressed  disagreements  during  the  inter-
views. The conversations flowed easily even though the inter-
views were conducted digitally. The interviewer did not have 
to  ask  several  questions,  because  the  participants  had  pro-
ductive conversations where 1 statement built upon another. 
The participants mostly knew each other. Only 1 GP did not 
know  the  other  group  members  but  did  still  engage  in  the 
conversation as much as the rest of the group members. The 
talking time was fairly equally split between the members in 
all  3  focus  groups,  and  the  interviewers  asked  questions  to 
clarify the participants’ statements to reveal different voices 
and different opinions in the focus groups. The interviewers 
were aware of the risk of peer pressure in a focus group, and 
intentionally ensured that all members of the group were al-
lowed to be honest and open about their own perspectives.

It  is  important  to  aim  for  reflexivity  and  to  be  aware  of 
the  researchers’  positions  and  experiences,  and  how  these 
could  affect  the  study.39  All  4  authors  are  experienced  GPs 
with a special interest in couple relationship issues. SDB and 
TM  who  accomplished  the  focus  group  interviews  perform 
CRE outside their GP practice. MB and EM are former ex-
perienced GPs and educated in systemic therapy. The authors’ 
background  as  GPs  is  a  strength  when  interviewing  other 
GPs,  since  it  is  easier  to  understand  their  working  context 
and which limitations they meet in everyday clinical practice. 
On the other hand, there is always a risk of missing out an 
outside perspective.

A  focus  group  design  is  well  suited  for  studying  experi-
ences and attitudes.13 The external validity was strengthened 
by a varied and adequate study sample with a heterogeneous 
group  of  participants  in  terms  of  gender,  age,  years  of  ex-
perience, and location of practices (urban/rural). A relevant 
and  strategic  selection  of  participants  are  important  for 
external  validity  and  strengthen  the  transferability  of  the 
findings.15 We used information power to decide the sample 
size. Information power can be divided into 5 items: narrow 
or broad study aim, dense or sparse sample specificity, ap-
plied  established  theory  or  not,  strong  or  weak  quality  of 

dialogue,  and  case  or  cross-case  analysis  strategy.15  Our 
study aim was to explore how GPs handle couple relation-
ship problems, which is narrower. The setting is familiar to 
most GPs, since 25% of the patients have talked about their 
couple  relationship  problems  with  their  GP.8  The  sample 
specificity  was  dense  because  the  participants  held  char-
acteristics  highly  specific  for  the  study  aim. The  quality  of 
the dialogues was strong with clear communication among  
the focus group members and between the participants and the  
researchers.  At  last  we  did  an  exploratory  cross-case  ana-
lysis which requires more participants than a case analysis 
focussing on in-depth analysis of narratives or details from 
a few selected participants.15

Implications of findings for research
GPs want to support their patients even though they are con-
strained by time. They would benefit from tools for pragmatic 
case-finding, to do assessments, and increasing their counsel-
ling competence. Further research should focus on testing and 
validating simple tools that could be useful in a busy practice. 
Such tools could be 1 or a few questions to identify patients 
with couple relationship problems, the implementation of BIs, 
providing psychoeducation, or challenge a patient to take his 
or her partner’s perspective on the problem.

It  would  also  be  useful  to  explore  patients’  experiences 
from talking to their doctors about their couple relationship 
before developing and implementing tools.

Conclusion
This study revealed several paradoxes. GPs are confident in 
offering individual supportive therapy for couple relationship 
issues but should be aware of substantial pitfalls such as side-
taking and constraining change. Despite dealing with relation-
ship problems, GPs do not see themselves as therapists. They 
use  professional  and  personal  experience  but  would  benefit 
from  increasing  their  skills  in  cognitive  restructuring  pro-
moting behavioural flexibility facing relationship problems.
