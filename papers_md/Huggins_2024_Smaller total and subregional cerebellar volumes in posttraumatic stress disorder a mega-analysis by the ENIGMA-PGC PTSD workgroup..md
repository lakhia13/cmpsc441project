Although the cerebellum contributes to higher-order cognitive and emotional functions relevant to posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), prior research on cerebellar volume in PTSD is scant, particularly when considering subregions that differentially map on to
motor, cognitive, and affective functions. In a sample of 4215 adults (PTSD n = 1642; Control n = 2573) across 40 sites from the
ENIGMA-PGC PTSD working group, we employed a new state-of-the-art deep-learning based approach for automatic cerebellar
parcellation to obtain volumetric estimates for the total cerebellum and 28 subregions. Linear mixed effects models controlling for
age, gender, intracranial volume, and site were used to compare cerebellum volumes in PTSD compared to healthy controls (88%
trauma-exposed). PTSD was associated with signiﬁcant grey and white matter reductions of the cerebellum. Compared to controls,
people with PTSD demonstrated smaller total cerebellum volume, as well as reduced volume in subregions primarily within the
posterior lobe (lobule VIIB, crus II), vermis (VI, VIII), ﬂocculonodular lobe (lobule X), and corpus medullare (all p-FDR < 0.05). Effects of
PTSD on volume were consistent, and generally more robust, when examining symptom severity rather than diagnostic status.
These ﬁndings implicate regionally speciﬁc cerebellar volumetric differences in the pathophysiology of PTSD. The cerebellum
appears to play an important role in higher-order cognitive and emotional processes, far beyond its historical association with
vestibulomotor function. Further examination of the cerebellum in trauma-related psychopathology will help to clarify how
cerebellar structure and function may disrupt cognitive and affective processes at the center of translational models for PTSD.

INTRODUCTION
Exposure to trauma is common, and nearly 10% of trauma
survivors develop chronic symptoms of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD [1]), a debilitating psychiatric condition character-
ized by a constellation of symptoms including intrusive memories,

avoidance, hypervigilance, and negative changes in mood and
cognition [2]. An extensive body of research has illuminated key
brain regions that differentiate PTSD patients from trauma-
exposed controls [3–5]. Notably, PTSD has been consistently
including the

[6–9], ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC
hippocampus
[10–12]), amygdala [13–15], insula [16–18], and anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC; [9, 19, 20]). These regions are part of a critical neural
circuit supporting diverse cognitive and affective functions that
are disrupted in PTSD,
including threat processing, emotion
regulation, and emotional memory [21, 22].

its central

A growing body of structural and functional magnetic resonance
imaging studies has begun to examine the role of the cerebellum
in PTSD [23]. Historically known for
role in the
vestibulomotor system [24], research emerging over the past three
decades demonstrates that the cerebellum contributes immensely
to higher-order cognition and emotion [25–27]. In fact, the human
cerebellum has rapidly (and disproportionately) evolved over time
[28–30]. Despite being approximately 10% of the brain’s overall
size [31], the cerebellum houses the vast majority of the brain’s
total neurons [32] and occupies nearly 80% of the neocortical
surface area [30]. The cerebellum shares rich anatomical connec-
tions with much of the brain, including with prefrontal and limbic
areas [28, 33–35], strongly suggesting that
it participates in
processes beyond motor coordination that may be highly relevant
to PTSD. Moreover, the cerebellum’s widespread connectivity with
stress-related regions (such as with the amygdala, hippocampus,
and periaqueductal gray) may make it especially vulnerable to
traumatic stress, potentially leading to the development of PTSD
symptoms by disrupting typical brain-mediated stress responses
via cerebro-cerebellar circuits [36, 37]. Recent studies have also
demonstrated that the cerebellum is involved in fear learning and
memory [23, 38–40]; considering PTSD is characterized by
aberrancies in threat detection and processing [41, 42],
this
accumulating evidence argues for incorporating the cerebellum
into well-established translational models of PTSD.

Indeed, PTSD has been linked to disrupted functional con-
nectivity between the cerebellum and key cognitive and affective
regions, including the amygdala [43]. Meta-analytic work has also
suggested cerebellar activation differentiates PTSD patients from
healthy controls [44–46]. At the structural level, smaller cerebellar
volume has been observed in both adult [47, 48] and pediatric
In one of the largest existing studies
[49, 50] PTSD samples.
(N = 84), PTSD patients had smaller left cerebellar hemisphere and
vermal volumes compared to trauma-exposed controls. Yet
structural studies have not consistently implicated the cerebellum
in PTSD [51–53], and limitations across studies have made it
challenging to reconcile these variable ﬁndings. First, a majority of
the studies in adults had small sample sizes ranging from 39 [48]
to 99 [53]; in fact, the three studies with null ﬁndings [51–53], had
a cumulative total of 82 PTSD patients. Studies have also varied
substantially in the structural metrics (volume [47], voxel-wise
morphology [48], cortical thickness [53]), and samples (combat
[52], violence exposed [47, 51], ﬁrst responders [53]) employed.

Prior research on cerebellar volume in PTSD has also been
limited by largely neglecting to consider important neuroanato-
mical subdivisions of the cerebellum that differentially map onto
motor, cognitive, and affective functions. Gross anatomy delineates
two major ﬁssures dividing the cerebellum into three anatomical
divisions: the anterior (lobules I–V), posterior (lobules VI-IX), and
ﬂocculonodular (lobule X) lobes [54]. The corpus medullare, the
white matter core of the cerebellum,
is a dense bundle of
myelinated ﬁbers with both afferent and efferent projections to
transmit neural signals to and from the cerebellum [55]. The
anterior lobe receives spinal afferents via spinocerebellar tracts and
shares reciprocal connections with motor cortices to help support
motor movements, gait, and equilibrium [56], while the ﬂocculo-
nodular lobe is remarkable for its role in receiving vestibular and
visual inputs and contributing to the regulation of balance, eye
movements, and reﬂexive responses [55]. By contrast, extensive
non-motor functions have been identiﬁed within the evolutionarily
newer posterior cerebellum [57], which lacks spinal cord inputs and
to higher-order
has connections with cortical areas integral

processes,
including the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus
[58, 59]. Activation within the posterior lobe has been observed
during language and verbal working memory (lobule VI, crus I),
spatial processing (lobule VI), and executive function (lobule VI and
VIIB, crus I) tasks [26, 57, 60]. Aversive stimulus processing, such as
noxious heat and unpleasant images, also appears to involve the
posterior cerebellum (lobules VI and VIIB and crus I), implicating
these regions in defensive responding [61]. The vermis—the
medial cortico-nuclear column connecting the left and right
cerebellar hemispheres–is considered an extension of the Papez
emotion circuit [62] and is activated during affective processing
[25, 27, 63]. Vermal lobules also interact with other regions critical
for emotional associative learning including the amygdala,
hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray [25, 64, 65]. Taken
together, these careful studies on functional topography have
identiﬁed three broad subdivisions of the cerebellum comprising
sensorimotor, cognitive, and limbic areas [26].

As a heterogenous disorder linked to dysfunction of multiple
cerebellum-supported processes, it is unclear whether structural
differences in the cerebellum in PTSD are global or may be
localized to speciﬁc subregions. Most studies, however, have taken
a fairly crude approach to examining the cerebellum in PTSD,
simply focusing only on the vermis [50, 52] and hemispheric total
volumes [47, 49]. While functional work has identiﬁed PTSD-
related activation differences distributed across the cerebellum,
including within the vermis [47, 50], crus [48, 66], and lobules VI
and VII [67–69], only one structural study [53] has taken a more
granular approach in parcellating the cerebellum to test
subregional speciﬁcity.
Importantly, better understanding the
relevance of cerebellar structure in the pathophysiology of PTSD
may help elucidate potential mechanisms that perpetuate chronic
symptoms of PTSD and aid in our ability to develop targeted,
effective interventions.

To this end, the present study employed a mega-analysis of
total and subregional cerebellar volumes in a large, multi-cohort
dataset
from the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through
Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)-Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)
PTSD workgroup. In contrast to a meta-analysis, a mega-analysis
centralizes and pools data from multiple sites and ﬁts statistical
models to the aggregated data while adjusting for site effects. We
used a novel, standardized ENIGMA cerebellum parcellation
protocol
[55, 70] to quantify cerebellar lobule volumes using
structural MRI data from 4215 adults with (n = 1642) and without
(n = 2573) PTSD. We examined the effects of PTSD on cerebellar
volumes, adjusting for age, gender, and total intracranial volume.
Based on prior work [47–50], we hypothesized that PTSD would be
associated with smaller total cerebellum volume. Considering
topography indicates the ‘limbic’ and ‘cognitive’
functional
cerebellum localize to the vermis and posterior lobes, respectively,
we hypothesized PTSD would be associated with smaller volumes
within these two anatomical divisions [25–27].

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Sample
Clinical, demographic, and neuroimaging data from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD
working group included in the current study are presented in Table 1. MRI
scans from 4215 subjects, including 1642 PTSD patients and 2573 healthy
controls (approximately 88% trauma-exposed and 12% trauma-naïve;
see Supplementary Material), were automatically segmented into cerebel-
lar subregions. All study procedures were approved by local institutional
review boards (IRB), and participants provided written informed consent.
The present analyses were granted exempt status by the Duke University
Health System IRB.

Image acquisition and processing
Whole-brain T1-weighted anatomical MR images were collected from each
participant. Acquisition parameters for each cohort are detailed in

Supplementary Table S2. Segmentation and quality control procedures
were performed at Duke University. A subset of the data (n = 1045) from
the Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain Injury Consortium-Chronic
Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (LIMBIC-CENC) [71] were processed at
University of Utah. Cerebellar parcellation was carried out using a deep-
learning algorithm, Automatic Cerebellum Anatomical Parcellation using
U-Net with Locally Constrained Optimization (ACAPULCO) [72].
Images
were corrected for intensity inhomogeneity using N4, blurred with a 3D
Gaussian kernel (SD = 3 mm), and transformed to MNI template space.
ACAPULCO then employed a cascade of
two convolutional neural
networks to ﬁrst deﬁne a 3D-bounding box around the cerebellum and
then divide it
regions. This ultimately

including the hemispheric anterior (lobules I-III,
subregions,
posterior (lobules VI, VIIB, VIIIA, VIIIB, IX, and crus I-II), and ﬂocculonodular
(lobule X) lobes, vermal
IX, and X, and the corpus
lobules VI, VII, VIII,
medullare (Fig. 1). ACAPULCO achieves results comparable to other
established cerebellum parcellation protocols (e.g., CERES2), but may
perform better for multi-site datasets [72].

Following segmentation, a two-step quality control procedure was
employed, consisting of (1) removal of statistical outliers ± 2.689 SD from
the site mean, and (2) visual inspection of cerebellar parcels. Each subject’s
segmentation was visually inspected and given a global score by a
minimum of two trained raters (AH, SL, MB, LB) on a scale from 1 (good) to
the
3 (poor/failed).
parcellation was examined by a third rater for consensus. Ratings were
performed using previously published quality control procedures [55].
Raters were trained using a graduated approach comprising didactic
instruction on neuronanatomical
landmarks of the cerebellum and its
surrounding anatomy (e.g., cerebellar ﬁssures, tentorium), and collabora-
tive rating or practice examples prior to independence. Segments were
considered individually;
(e.g.,
statistical outliers, circumscribed segmentation errors) for a participant
could be excluded, while the remainder of their segments were retained
for analysis if correct. Subjects receiving a global score of 3 were excluded
from all analyses. A breakdown of ratings by site is noted in Supplementary
Table S3.

Statistical analysis
To examine whether PTSD diagnosis was associated with volume
differences in the grey matter volumes of
the whole cerebellum,
hemispheric subregions, vermis, and cerebellar white matter, we
performed a series of linear mixed effects models. Statistical analyses
were conducted using the lmer package [73] in R v4.3.1. In each model,
age, gender, and total intracranial volume were treated as ﬁxed effects,
and site/scanner was treated as a random effect. We considered different
scanners within sites as separate sites, resulting in a total number of
49 sites coded separately in our analyses. Models were repeated

implementing PTSD severity–rather than diagnosis – as a continuous
predictor. Due to site measurement differences, PTSD severity was
quantiﬁed as a percentage of the total score possible (see Table 1). The
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [74] was used to adjust signiﬁcance values
to control the false discovery rate (p-FDR < 0.05; number of tests = 29).
These adjustments were done separately for PTSD diagnosis and PTSD
severity. Cohen’s d was calculated as a measure of effect size.

Given frequent co-occurrence of PTSD and likely independent effects on
cerebellum volume, secondary analyses were conducted to examine the
potential effects of depression [75, 76], alcohol use disorder [77, 78], and
childhood trauma [79, 80] on cerebellar volumes. For sites with available
covariate data (see Supplemental Material), an additional series of linear
mixed effects models was conducted, including ﬁxed effects of (1) major
depressive disorder diagnosis, (2) alcohol use disorder diagnosis, and (3)
total score on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ [81]);

RESULTS
Associations between PTSD diagnosis and cerebellum
volumes
The effects of PTSD diagnosis on cerebellum volumes are
presented in Table 2. Consistent with hypotheses, after adjusting
for age, gender, and total intracranial volume, PTSD diagnosis was
associated with signiﬁcantly smaller
total cerebellar volume,
b = −981.471, t = −2.793, p-FDR = 0.005. PTSD diagnosis was also
associated with smaller volume of
the corpus medullare,
b = −154.149, t = −2.188, p-unc = 0.026, but this did not survive
multiple comparisons corrections (p-FDR = 0.096).

Within the anterior cerebellum (lobules I-V), PTSD diagnosis was
associated with a smaller volume of right lobule V, b = −43.364,
t = −2.504, p-unc = 0.012, but
this did not survive multiple
comparisons corrections (p-FDR = 0.051).

Although these differences in cerebellar volumes between patients
with PTSD and healthy controls were signiﬁcant (p-FDR < 0.05), as
calculated with Cohen’s d, effects were generally quite small
(all d’s < −0.12). Figure 2 depicts a map of the effect sizes.

PTSD severity
When examining PTSD symptom severity (rather than diagnostic
status), results were similar, if generally more robust (see Table 3).
Speciﬁcally, PTSD symptom severity was associated with signiﬁ-
cantly smaller total cerebellum volume, b = −693.478, t = −3.719,
p-FDR = 0.002, and corpus medullare volumes, b = −109.441,
t = −2.915, p-FDR = 0.015. Effects were consistent across the
posterior cerebellum and vermis, with signiﬁcant effects of PTSD
left crus II, b = −67.120,
symptom severity on volumes of
t = −3.044, p-FDR = 0.012, left lobule VIIB, b = −73.912, t = −3.995,
p-FDR < 0.001, right lobule VIIB, b = −81.890, t = −4.085, p-FDR <
0.001, and vermal lobules VI, b = −13.931, t = −3.393, p-FDR
= 0.005,
and VIII, b = −17.270, t = −3.058, p-FDR = 0.012.

By contrast, the effect of PTSD on the volume of right lobule V
retained signiﬁcance when examining symptom severity instead
of diagnosis, b = −22.300, t = −2.412, p-FDR = 0.046. Additionally,
PTSD symptom severity was associated with a signiﬁcantly smaller
volume of the ﬂocculonodular cerebellum, with effects observed

Potential confounding variables
When including covariates assessing depression, alcohol use, and
childhood trauma, effects of PTSD on cerebellar volumes were
somewhat diminished (See Supplemental Material); however,
when using a more liberal approach to correct for multiple
comparisons, most signiﬁcant effects of PTSD were retained even
when accounting for depression and alcohol use disorders.
Notably, detecting signiﬁcant effects in these additional analyses
presented a challenge to statistical power. There was high
collinearity between PTSD and covariates, and—particularly in

depression, alcohol use, or childhood trauma predicted cerebellar

DISCUSSION
Leveraging an international, multisite dataset from ENIGMA-PGC
PTSD, we conducted a mega-analysis of total and subregional
cerebellar volumes in PTSD. Consistent with hypotheses based on
published work [47–50], PTSD was associated with smaller total
cerebellar volume. We found subregional speciﬁcity linking PTSD
to smaller volumes in the posterior cerebellum, vermis, and
ﬂocculonodular cerebellum. Effects of PTSD on cerebellum volume
were consistent (and generally more robust) when examining
symptom severity rather than diagnostic status. Overall, these
ﬁndings contribute to an emerging literature that underscores the
relevance of cerebellar structure in the pathophysiology of PTSD.
Although the appreciation of the cerebellum for its contributions
to cognitive and affective function is relatively recent, the current
results bolster a growing literature conﬁrming the cerebellum is
not exclusively devoted to motor function and may, in fact, have
including PTSD
unique relevance to psychiatric conditions
[23, 35, 82].

Multiple neuroimaging studies have suggested that altered
structure and function of the posterior cerebellum may be a
neural correlate of PTSD. For instance, structural differences in
lobules VIIB, VIIIA, and VIIIB were found in combat-exposed
veterans with PTSD [69]. Functionally, PTSD has been linked to
increased activation during attentional and emotional
tasks
[67, 68] and decreased resting-state amplitude of low-frequency
ﬂuctuation [83] in lobule VI. In a sample of sexual assault survivors,
PTSD severity was negatively associated with activation in lobules
VI, VIII, IX, and crus I during the performance of an emotional go/
no-go task, and positively associated with activation in left
cerebellar lobules VII-IX and crus I-II when retrieving positive
memory during a mental imagery task [84]. PTSD has also been
linked to decreased global connectivity within the posterior
cerebellum during symptom provocation [85]. As the most
phylogenetically recent part of the cerebellum [28], the posterior
lobe is intricately linked with paralimbic and association cortical
areas and plays an integral role in the integration of perception,
the posterior
emotion, and behavior

[26, 27]. Accordingly,

cerebellum contributes to the salience network (lobules VI and VII;
[25, 86]) and diverse cognitive-affective processes including
working memory, attentional allocation, and associative learning
[26, 87]. In the context of the current ﬁndings, smaller volume of
lobule VIIB and crus II may be implicated in the pathophysiology
of PTSD, perhaps mapping directly onto symptoms such as
hypervigilance and concentration difﬁculties.

In the present study, PTSD was also associated with smaller
volume of vermal

considered part of the ‘limbic’ cerebellum and appears to play a
key role in emotional processing,
learning, and memory
[25, 27, 63]. Prior work has demonstrated that PTSD is associated
with smaller volume [47, 50] and increased signal variability [88] of
the vermis. Importantly, structural abnormalities in the vermis may
provide increased spatial speciﬁcity within existing translational
models of PTSD, as converging evidence from both animals and

tests – including processing speed,

PTSD symptom severity was also curiously associated with
lobule X (which comprises the
reduced volume of bilateral
ﬂocculonodular lobe), but its association with PTSD diagnosis
was non-signiﬁcant. The ﬂocculonodular lobe is primarily impli-
cated in ocular tracking and regulation of the vestibular system
[102]. Yet, when depression diagnosis was added to the model,
there was a signiﬁcant negative effect of depression on right
lobule X, whereas effects of PTSD were non-signiﬁcant. Structural
differences in lobule X have previously been observed in major
depressive disorder
[103], and these differences have been
attributed to somatic complaints, such as dizziness, that are
frequently endorsed by patients with depression. PTSD and major
depressive disorder are highly comorbid [104, 105]. Therefore,
smaller lobule X volume may perhaps be unique to patients with
prominent depressive features and/or a more somatic symptom
proﬁle.

In general, PTSD severity was more robustly associated with
cerebellar volume differences than PTSD diagnosis. For instance,
although PTSD’s effects on corpus medullare volumes did not
survive correction when examining diagnosis,
there was a
signiﬁcant association for PTSD severity. The most parsimonious
explanation for this phenomenon is that continuous severity
scores provide a more powerful statistical test than diagnosis.
PTSD status can reﬂect a wide range of severity within both
patient and control groups, and therefore using diagnosis is, in
effect, disregarding valuable information that explains variance
associated with cerebellar volume. While diagnostic status
provides a clinically useful shorthand,
it also fails to capture
phenotypic variability within PTSD.

It is also possible the more robust results might be explained by
the control group containing a mix of trauma-exposed and
trauma-naïve participants. Few sites provided data for trauma-
naïve participants; as such, the majority of our control group
(~88%) was trauma-exposed. We chose to retain trauma-naïve
individuals within the control group to beneﬁt from increased
power associated with the larger sample size, but this may have
introduced additional noise (unaccounted variance) that dimin-
ished the signiﬁcance of diagnosis-related statistical tests. Our
severity analyses, however, excluded trauma-naïve participants, as
(having no index trauma) they did not complete assessments of
PTSD symptom severity. The small sample of
trauma-naïve
subjects precluded us from assessing whether there are cerebellar
volume differences related to trauma exposure (not just PTSD),
and future work to examine this question will be valuable.
Although exploratory analyses
suggested that most PTSD
symptom domains – including re-experiencing, avoidance, and
negative changes in cognition and mood – were consistently
associated with cerebellar volumes (See Supplement),

Overall, despite these signiﬁcant ﬁndings suggesting associa-

were small. As such, it is unlikely that structural cerebellar volumes

level prediction). That said, the large sample size and granular

small sample sizes are likely to overestimate effect sizes [106]. In

studies in a subset of the current sample have identiﬁed similarly

(d = −0.11), associated with PTSD [7]. Future work would beneﬁt
from a more systematic comparison amongst brain structures
implicated in PTSD to identify the most robust neural correlates of
the disorder. It is also possible that, in general, true effects are
slightly larger than typically estimated in consortium datasets,

impair-
ment, and staggering treatment costs. The insights from the
current study have revealed a novel treatment target that may be
leveraged to improve treatment outcomes for PTSD. In fact, prior
work has shown that the cerebellum is sensitive to external
modulation. For example, recent work has highlighted how non-
invasive brain stimulation of
the cerebellum can modulate
cognitive, emotional, and social processes commonly disrupted
in PTSD, including mood regulation and context-based prediction
[107, 108]. In other work in depression, electroconvulsive therapy
has been shown to increase volume of cerebellar
regions
including lobule VII, and these structural changes were associated
with symptom reductions [109]. Changes in cerebellum functional
connectivity are also linked to reductions in PTSD symptom
severity before and after cognitive processing therapy [110]. As
such, despite small effect sizes, prior work has shown that
cerebellum structure and function is modiﬁable, and these
localized cerebellum structural ﬁndings may provide useful and
more precise targets for neuromodulatory, pharmacological, and
integrating
even psychotherapeutic intervention. Ultimately,
neurobiologically-informed targets within treatment protocols
may help establish treatments with stronger and more long-
lasting therapeutic effects.

Limitations
This is the largest study of cerebellar volumetry in PTSD to date,
however,
there are several notable limitations. PTSD is a
heterogeneous disorder and is highly comorbid with other
psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, substance use disorders)
and environmental exposures (e.g., childhood trauma, traumatic
brain injury) that are also linked to alterations in cerebellar
structure [75, 80, 82]. Employing a mega-analysis in a large multi-
cohort consortium dataset enabled us to observe small effect sizes
of PTSD on cerebellar volume in our primary analyses, but many
sites did not provide diagnostic or item-level data for relevant
covariates. Consequently, we were unable to investigate effects of
relevant covariates at the same scale. Future studies would beneﬁt
from investigating unique and shared phenotypes of PTSD and
other common comorbid psychopathologies on the cerebellum to
disentangle potential dissociable effects and complex interactions

more elegantly. It is also critical for future work to examine how
the cerebellum may be uniquely implicated in the dissociative
subtype of PTSD. Dissociative symptoms in PTSD are linked to
alterations within the midbrain that facilitate passive, rather than
active, defensive responses [111, 112]; observed differences in
cerebellar functional activation and connectivity related to the
dissociative subtype of PTSD [66, 68, 113, 114] may be mediated
by the prominent neural pathways between the cerebellum and
midbrain. The current study was also focused solely on cerebellar
volumetric differences in PTSD. Multiple studies have observed
disrupted cerebellar activity both at rest [48, 66, 114] and during
trauma-relevant tasks [43, 68, 84, 115] in patients with PTSD.
Future work would beneﬁt from improved localization of both
functional and structural changes in the cerebellum that may be
present in PTSD. In addition, individual differences in education
may further explain cerebellar volume reductions and should be
explored in future studies. Lastly, the current study is cross-
sectional in nature; future longitudinal research will be imperative
to better understand whether cerebellum volume confers risk for
PTSD or changes as a function of the disorder.

CONCLUSION
In a sample of over 4000 adults from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD
Consortium, cerebellum volume was signiﬁcantly smaller
in
patients with PTSD compared to pooled groups of
trauma-
exposed and trauma-naïve controls. Speciﬁc subregional volume
reductions in the vermis and posterior cerebellum (crus II and
lobule VIIB) align with previous work demonstrating their
involvement in cognitive and affective functions relevant to PTSD,
such as fear learning and regulation. Overall, these ﬁndings argue
for a critical role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of
