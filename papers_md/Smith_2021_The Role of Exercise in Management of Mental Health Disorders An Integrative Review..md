Abstract

A large and growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity (PA) may hold therapeutic 
promise in the management of mental health disorders. Most evidence linking PA to mental health 
outcomes has focused on the effects of aerobic exercise training on depression, although a growing 
body of work supports the efficacy of both aerobic and resistance exercise paradigms in the 
treatment of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite abundant evidence linking PA and 
mental health, use of exercise training as a mental health treatment remains limited due to three 
important sources of uncertainty: (a) large individual differences in response to exercise treatment 
within multiple mental health domains; (b) the critical importance of sustained PA engagement, 
not always achieved, for therapeutic benefit; and (c) disagreement regarding the relative 
importance of putative therapeutic mechanisms. Our review of treatment data on exercise 
interventions and mental health outcomes focuses primarily on depression and anxiety within a 
health neuroscience framework. Within this conceptual framework, neurobiological and behavioral 
mechanisms may have additive or synergistic influences on key cognitive and behavioral processes 
that influence mental health outcomes. We therefore highlight sources of treatment heterogeneity 
by integrating the critical influences of (a) neurobiological mechanisms enhancing neuroplasticity 
and (b) behavioral learning of self-regulatory skills. Understanding the interrelationships between 
dynamic neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms may help inform personalized mental health 
treatments and clarify why, and for whom, exercise improves mental health outcomes. The review 
concludes with recommendations for future studies leveraging individual differences to refine 
treatment approaches to optimize mental health benefits.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE LINKING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND 

MENTAL HEALTH

Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that lower amounts of physical 
activity (PA) or greater amounts of time spent in sedentary behaviors are associated with 
greater risk of poor mental health. In a recent study of 1.2 million US adults, in which 
participants were matched across numerous background and demographic factors, 
individuals who exercised reported better mental health functioning compared to 
nonexercisers (1). Prospective studies focusing on specific mental health conditions have 
reported similar findings, suggesting that greater habitual PA may protect against the 
development of various mental health conditions. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 49 
prospective studies across nearly 267,000 individuals demonstrated that higher levels of PA 
associated with reduced odds of developing depression [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.79–0.88] across age groups (2). PA also prospectively associated 
with lower odds of developing elevated anxiety symptoms (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.99) 
and anxiety disorders (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.53–0.83) in a recent meta-analysis of more than 
80,000 individuals (3).

The concept of habitual PA serving a protective role against the development of mental 
health conditions is further bolstered by data suggesting that greater amounts of PA are 
associated with incrementally lower risk of mental health problems. Across various exercise 
modalities, there appears to be a dose-response association between greater PA and mental 
health functioning (4), even after accounting for numerous social, medical, and behavioral 
confounds, such as smoking (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.61–0.75) (5). Individuals with moderate 
or low levels of fitness exhibit a 23% and 47% greater risk of developing a mental health 
problem when compared to their highly fit counterparts, with additive benefits of aerobic 
and resistance exercise (6). Taken together, epidemiological evidence provides robust 
evidence that greater habitual PA associates with better mental health functioning. For the 
purposes of the present review, exercise is defined as planned or intentional training 
activities, whereas PA also includes leisure-time activities.

Exercise Training and Mental Health: Experimental Evidence

Results from randomized trials of exercise, while generally favorable, have been more mixed 
than observational findings (7–10). Multiple meta-analytic studies have examined the impact 
of exercise training, primarily aerobic but also resistance training (10), with varying degrees 
of efficacy depending on methodological considerations, including study quality, duration 
(11), and choice of comparator group (12). Most evidence suggests that exercise, particularly 
aerobic training, improves depression- and anxiety-related outcomes compared with 
attention control conditions, with treatment effect sizes paralleling those for conventional 
pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Aerobic exercise trials have generally reported moderate 
to large improvements compared with no intervention [effect size (ES) = 1.24] or 
conventional control conditions (ES = 0.68), with improvements comparable to standard 
psychological or pharmacological approaches. Importantly, the effects of exercise training 
tend to decline over time and are generally not significant at follow-up (ES = 0.22) (8), with

therapeutic benefits only sustained among individuals who continue to exercise following 
cessation of active treatment (13). Although fewer studies have examined resistance training 
paradigms, existing data suggest that resistance training also appears to improve depressive 
symptoms (ES = 0.66, 95% CI 0.48–0.83), albeit with significant heterogeneity across trials 
(10). Exercise training has also been examined as an add-on therapy, enhancing the efficacy 
of conventional outpatient treatment approaches over the course of 2–3 months (ES = −0.79, 
95% CI −1.01 − −0.57) (7).

Interestingly, evidence for dose-response effects of training is less robust than observational 
findings; relatively few studies link the degree of improvement with the intensity or duration 
of training (14). In addition, examination of sustained treatment response over time suggests 
that the most important factor associating with remission from various mental health 
conditions is the degree of exercise maintenance over time, regardless of initial intervention 
assignment, with continued exercise participation demonstrating a threshold of benefit 
corresponding closely to the American Heart Association’s recommended level of activity of 
150 min per week (13, 15). In summary, exercise training appears to have a potentially 
important impact on mental health functioning, comparable to conventional 
psychotherapeutic and pharmacological approaches; however, the effects of exercise training 
vary across patient populations and training modalities, and the long-term mental health 
benefits appear contingent upon sustained PA engagement. Understanding the mechanisms 
of treatment response and exercise maintenance is therefore of critical importance to the 
ultimate efficacy of exercise as a clinical treatment.

Transdiagnostic Mechanisms

Recent studies have begun to examine transdiagnostic mechanisms by which exercise may 
improve mental health outcomes (16), including integration of interrelated behavioral and 
neurobehavioral domains (17, 18). For example, recent literature syntheses have begun 
integrating affective and cognitive mechanisms of treatment across samples of patients with 
neurodegenerative disorders and depression, demonstrating that exercise improves 
depressive symptoms (ES = 0.78), with weak dose-response effects (standardized beta = 
0.007, p = 0.012). Improvements in depression were paralleled by improvements in 
behavioral markers of cognitive control (ES = 0.24), with a high degree of heterogeneity 
(16). While methodological variation is frequently and appropriately identified as a source of 
heterogeneity, the impact of exercise on mental health outcomes also appears to vary based 
on the presence and type of neurobehavioral impairment.

An illustrative example of diagnostic treatment heterogeneity is the use of exercise among 
individuals with late-life depression (LLD) (19, 20) and/or vascular depression (21). These 
individuals demonstrate substantially poorer treatment outcomes to conventional therapeutic 
approaches compared to younger individuals with depression or individuals with an earlier 
first depressive episode, despite ostensibly meeting the same diagnostic criteria. Individuals 
with LLD are more likely to have cardiovascular disease risk factors, white matter 
hyperintensities, and comorbid cognitive dysfunction typified by executive function 
impairments than individuals with an earlier onset of depression. Despite these patients’ 
lower treatment response, psychomotor activation appears to be an important protective

factor, predicting subsequent persistence of treatment benefits (22). The effects of exercise 
training in this population have been heterogeneous; some large, multisite trials have failed 
to find a benefit of exercise in LLD samples (23). Nevertheless, in a recent meta-analysis of 
nine trials and 1,308 participants, exercise training was found to be moderately effective in 
reducing depressive symptoms (ES = 0.64, 95% CI 0.27–1.01), with significant 
heterogeneity across studies (9). Follow-up analyses suggested that greater age, cognitive 
impairment, and severity of depressive symptoms all contributed to treatment response 
heterogeneity, despite evidence for favorable exercise effects both among older adults (24) 
and in selected trials among individuals with dementia. These analyses suggested that the 
observed lack of treatment response in some individuals may be due to a greater prevalence 
of impairments in reward system pathways in individuals with geriatric depression or LLD. 
Existing evidence linking exercise training to mental health outcomes suggests that exercise 
has beneficial effects with wide variation, but there is a lack of explanatory studies 
delineating for whom and why exercise is beneficial.

EXERCISE TRAINING AND MENTAL HEALTH: EXPLANATORY 

MECHANISMS

Examination of the literature linking exercise to mental health suggests that exercise training 
is beneficial for a broad array of mental health outcomes, although the strength of treatment 
benefit appears to vary across populations and training modalities. The present literature 
base could be characterized as having three overarching mechanistic hypotheses, which are 
useful in framing hypotheses regarding treatment improvements: (a) Mental health is 
improved in association with physical/hedonic effects of exercise, (b) exercise improves 
mental health via neurobiological mechanisms, or (c) exercise is a vehicle for cultivating 
behavioral mechanisms of change (e.g., self-regulatory skills and self-efficacy). We contend 
that exercise training likely improves mental health through synergistic influences of both 
neurobiological and behavioral learning mechanisms (Figure 1). Within this framework (25, 
26), training improves neurobiological systems critical for adaptive learning, as well as 
affective and cognitive control processes, resulting in synergistic improvements in the 
regulation of both cognitive and affective responses through a “virtuous circle” of 
reinforcement (27, 28).

Core Influence of Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity is increasingly characterized as a central mechanistic component of mental 
health improvements and is highly influenced by PA. The brain’s capacity for 
neurobiological remodeling within key neurocircuitry is a critical element of adaptive 
learning, is impaired across many heterogeneous mental health conditions, declines with 
age, and may be inhibited by several age-related systemic processes. Adaptive learning, in 
turn, is a critical element of mental health improvements following behavioral interventions. 
Increased neuroplastic capacity is one hypothesized mechanism underlying the mental 
health benefits of several widely used somatic psychiatric treatment modalities, including 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and transmagnetic stimulation. Exercise is one of the 
few behavioral processes that appears to increase neuroplasticity.

At the structural level, neuroplasticity has been used to refer to the growth of new neurons 
and glial cells (neurogenesis), as well as new connections between existing neural networks 
through dendritic remodeling, synaptic formation and pruning, and axonal augmentation 
(synaptogenesis). Additional, related changes include the growth of new microvascular 
pathways (angiogenesis) and potentiation of neurotransmitter systems (monoamines) that are 
important for reward sensitization. There is now a general consensus that in adult humans, 
neurogenesis occurs in two specific brain regions, both of which are critical for mental 
health disorders and treatments: (a) the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus (mesial 
temporal lobe) and (b) the subventricular zone adjacent to the caudate and striatum 
(subcortex-prefrontal cortex). The dentate gyrus is essential for the creation and 
consolidation of new memories and regulation of affect, primarily changing through new 
gray matter cell growth. The subventricular zone and caudate are critical to striatal dopamine 
function and subcortical white matter pathways (29). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that 
neuroplastic changes and enhanced learning ability as a behavioral corollary are crucial 
therapeutic substrates for successful treatment outcomes (Figure 2).

Neuroplasticity Facilitators

Several key systemic factors must be present to facilitate neuroplastic changes, all of which 
are modifiable through exercise training. Briefly, these include neurotrophins, intact cerebral 
metabolic function, low neuroinflammation, and sleep. Neurotrophic growth factors are 
enhanced by exercise and linked to neuroplasticity, including modulation of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin-like 
growth factor 1 (IGF-1). BDNF is increased following aerobic (30) and resistance exercise 
training (31) and is critical to neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. VEGF is more closely tied 
to cerebrovascular and microglial function, as well as angiogenesis. IGF-1 is more closely 
tied to cerebral and systemic metabolic changes, conferring structural adaptations similar to 
those seen with BDNF.

Neuroplasticity Inhibitors

Growth factors, particularly BDNF, also have systemic effects in regulating cellular 
bioenergetic function (32), which is disrupted in multiple mental health conditions (33), 
making it more difficult to facilitate affective control, cultivate flexible response patterns, or 
facilitate synaptic plasticity adaptations within supportive neurocircuitry (34). The 
bioenergetic system is also highly influenced by inflammation (35), sharing multiple 
molecular pathways with neurogenesis and depression (36). Elevated levels of inflammation 
appear to inhibit the effects of aerobic exercise on enhanced neurogenesis (37), partly 
through increasing kynurenine accumulation in the brain. Exercise may facilitate skeletal 
muscle clearance of kynurenine, suggesting that the comparable effects of exercise and 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on mental health outcomes may be due to their 
parallel, neuroprotective effects through kynurenine pathways (38).

EXERCISE TRAINING: BRAIN NETWORK ALTERATIONS

For the purposes of understanding the effects of exercise on critical brain neurocircuitry, 
existing evidence can be grouped into three categories. Changes are observed in three

functional neuroanatomical circuits characterized in the triple network model of large-scale 
brain networks (39). As shown in Table 1, these changes occur in the salience network (SN), 
the executive control network (ECN), and the default mode network (DMN). Both 
depression and anxiety are associated with lower volume within DMN (hippocampus) and 
SN (amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex) brain structures (40). Individuals with 
depression also demonstrate reduced connectivity between the ECN and DMN, whereas 
individuals with anxiety demonstrate reduced connectivity between the ECN and SN. 
Improvements following psychiatric treatments with disparate mechanisms also correlate 
with connectivity alterations between these key networks. For example, treatment-related 
improvements following emotion regulation (ER)–focused psychotherapy (41) associate 
with alterations in connectivity between the SN and DMN, with both networks 
demonstrating increased connectivity to the ECN following successful treatment. A similar 
pattern of improvements has been demonstrated following pharmacological treatment of 
depression with aberrant SN and DMN connectivity improving with treatment, as well as 
differential improvements across symptom clusters (emotional and somatic), type of 
antidepressant (noradrenergic and serotonergic), and pattern of altered connectivity (42). 
These findings have been interpreted as demonstrating that enhancing connectivity with the 
ECN associates with behavioral improvements in cognitive control (for SN connectivity) and 
reductions in overly self-referential processing (for DMN connectivity).

Volumetric changes following exercise training have been most consistently observed in the 
prefrontal cortex (PFC), subcortex, and mesial temporal brain structures (43), with the most 
consistent changes in the dentate gyrus (44, 45). The mesial temporal lobe (MTL) is 
particularly vulnerable to neurodegenerative disease processes, such as Alzheimer’s disease, 
although exercise appears to increase volume in this brain region across both middle-aged 
and older adult samples (46). Moderate-intensity training in older adults, for example, 
increases hippocampal volume with dose-response improvements from 6 to 12 months, 
offsetting normative neurodegenerative changes (1–2% annually), without volumetric 
increases in other brain regions (47). In one of the few exercise trials collecting 
neuroimaging data from participants with depression, depressive symptoms improved in 
parallel with increased MTL volume and improved verbal memory, despite a 30% dropout 
rate and lack of a significant treatment group benefit (48).

While most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have focused on MTL brain areas, white 
matter changes have also been reported, particularly in PFC and parietal lobe areas critical 
for SN and ECN function (43). In a one-year training intervention, Voss and colleagues (49) 
demonstrated improvements in microstructural parameters of white matter integrity in the 
PFC, paralleling improvements in MTL brain regions. Similarly, during a 10- to 12-year 
follow-up examination of participants in the LOOK-AHEAD diabetes trial, the lifestyle 
intervention group demonstrated an impressive 28% lower white matter hyperintensity 
volume, compared to only a 9% lower ventricle volume (50). We recently reported parallel 
results in a pilot study of adults with depression, in which aerobic exercise stabilized white 
matter hyperintensity progression following a 16-week treatment (51). Notably, preliminary 
evidence suggests similar improvements following resistance training, with participants 
exhibiting improvements in PFC white matter volume and executive functioning (52).

The effects of exercise training on connectivity changes extend studies of structural markers 
by elucidating their functional significance to underlying behavioral changes. Extant 
connectivity studies suggest critical influences impacting SN and ECN neurocircuitry, 
independent of volumetric changes in DMN brain structures. Acute exercise, for example, 
has been shown to enhance efficiency within the DMN and improve functional modulation 
between networks, as indicated by enhanced ability of SN and ECN brain regions to 
selectively and adaptively inhibit DMN functioning (53), with parallel improvements in 
behavioral markers of cognitive control (54). Several RCTs have suggested that exercise 
training may enhance connectivity in clinically important neurocircuitry (54–56), and some 
suggest that markers of brain connectivity hold central importance as translational 
biomarkers (55). Previous randomized trials of exercise training suggest that it may improve 
ECN and DMN markers of connectivity, with corresponding behavioral improvements. Voss 
and colleagues, for example, found that a 12-month aerobic exercise program among older 
adults enhanced ECN and DMN connectivity, with corresponding improvements in 
executive function (57). The DMN, in particular, has been extensively studied for its 
responsivity to exercise training (58), as well as being widely implicated in the pathogenesis 
of depression (59, 60), particularly LLD (59, 60). In addition, a growing body of work 
suggests that greater baseline evidence of disrupted connectivity is predictive of subsequent 
behavioral improvements in markers of cognitive control (55, 56). Similar findings have 
been reported for mood improvements (61), with altered connectivity in DMN and ECN 
associating with poorer treatment outcomes and greater cognitive dysfunction among adults 
with depression (62).

Observed changes in connectivity are also likely attributable to enhancements of 
neurotransmitter systems, particularly neuromodulatory pathways (dopamine, 
norepinephrine, and (serotonin).

This assertion is supported by large amounts of indirect evidence suggesting that 
neurobehavioral improvements following exercise are largest in executive functions (17, 18), 
which are preferentially impacted by dopaminergic disruption. In addition, parallel cognitive 
improvements are observed across heterogeneous populations with dysfunctional 
dopaminergic/norepinephrine functioning, including Parkinson’s disease (63), attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (64, 65), and bipolar disorder (66), with exercise-related 
increases in dopamine production (67). Modulation of the serotonin system is also widely 
hypothesized to play an important mechanistic role in the effects of acute exercise training 
on mood-related changes (68), with at least one prior trial demonstrating that higher 
intensity of aerobic training increased plasma 5-HT levels, which associated with improved 
response inhibition (69). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced production and 
synthesis of monoamines is a critical component of improved affect regulation and cognitive 
control, both of which enhance self-regulation.

EXERCISE TRAINING: BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS

In addition to direct modulation of cognitive and affective responses, exercise training may 
also facilitate learning of adaptive behavioral responses that improve mental health (Figure 
1), broadly formulated as self-regulatory capacities. While self-regulation is vast, it includes

ER and cognitive control, which are transdiagnostic mechanisms of change. Consistent with 
the Science of Behavior Change initiative (70), these mechanisms should be evaluable and 
coherent at different levels of analysis (i.e., changes in behavioral mechanisms should 
correspond to neurobiological changes) and, by extension, could be mutually facilitative, 
such that changes in one affect the other. Although prior research has examined regulation of 
both emotion and affect, affect regulation has traditionally been defined as the modulation of 
emotions or emotional expression in the service of self-regulation. Affect regulation has also 
traditionally been more closely associated with executive functioning in comparison with 
ER.

There are few examples that integrate psychological and neurocognitive mechanisms in a 
single model. One possible exception is self-systems theory (SST) (71–73). According to 
SST, many psychological disorders result from cumulative or catastrophic failures of goal 
pursuits (72). SST has most widely been used in depression, where it is superior to 
conventional therapeutic approaches among depressed adults with self-regulatory deficits 
(71). However, a critical conceptual element of SST, which parallels mechanistic studies on 
PA and mental health, is its integration of both psychological function and neurobiological 
inefficiencies as contributing to potential self-regulatory failures within an individual. 
Differential impact of exercise on mental health could arise from either source or from a lack 
of effective synergy between the two. This concept may be critical in understanding for 
whom interventions work and under what conditions, and in tailoring treatments.

Specific behavioral mechanisms linking exercise interventions to mental health include self-
regulatory skills specific to affect regulation (61, 74) (e.g., tolerating and modulating 
arousal) and cognition (75) (e.g., exerting cognitive control over behavior, sustaining 
attention, and flexibly shifting attention and behavioral responses to match environmental 
demands) (76), which could influence mental health directly and through increased self-
efficacy (77). Exercise may also potentiate reward salience through increased engagement in 
personally meaningful or rewarding activities and reward sensitization, or improved fitness 
(e.g., feeling more fit, improved body image). Behavioral mechanisms broadly correspond 
with neurological domains of changes, as summarized in Figure 3.

EMOTION REGULATION/EXPERIENTIAL AVOIDANCE

The impact of exercise on mood is one of the most widely studied mechanisms linking 
exercise to mental health, both through acutely enhancing mood and by improving ER 
during stressful life circumstances (78). Newer cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBTs), such 
as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (77) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy, target 
difficulties in ER as a key mechanism of change (79). ER is a multidimensional construct 
that includes awareness and clarity of feelings, as well as acceptance of emotions and the 
ability to modulate emotional responses. A significant literature indicates that difficulties in 
ER are associated with mental health problems and that improvements in ER correspond 
with better mental health. A smaller literature demonstrates improvements in these processes 
prospectively predicting outcomes. Experiential avoidance and avoidant coping with 
unwanted thoughts and feelings (i.e., efforts to avoid or suppress thoughts/feelings) are 
particularly detrimental, contributing to the development and maintenance of anxiety

disorders (including panic disorder), depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD), among others. Related issues of hypervigilance, reactive or impulsive 
responding to internal cues, and difficulty labeling emotions (alexithymia or poor 
interoceptive awareness) are also implicated in psychiatric disorders, most notably PTSD, 
borderline personality disorder, and eating disorders.

Exercise may improve individuals’ ability to tolerate negative affect or high levels of 
arousal. For example, high-intensity exercise elicits autonomic arousal that mimics anxiety. 
During exercise, individuals experience these sensations in a nonthreatening context, in 
which aversive interoceptive cues are not only expected but may be indicative of effective 
engagement. This may form new associations with anxiety and increase capacity to tolerate 
interoceptive sensations while inhibiting avoidance/escape responses. Participants may also 
learn skills to modulate arousal, such as through paced breathing. Exercise training, 
particularly high intensity interval training and resistance training, also causes temporary 
discomfort in pursuit of a more long-term goal (e.g., fitness). The ability to allow short-term 
discomfort in favor of long-term gain is essential for impulse control. Repeated exercise 
training over the course of weeks and gradual intensity titration might be particularly 
effective in helping participants gain mastery over potentially distressing internal 
experiences. Exercise may therefore incorporate gradual exposure with response prevention 
in the context of training, similar to conventional psychotherapy paradigms using 
desensitization techniques through gradual exposure (80–82). Studies with various clinical 
populations have suggested that aerobic training reduces anxiety and anxiety sensitivity. 
Indeed, most of the brain regions that have enhanced activation and function following 
exercise training are well known for their importance in affective reactivity within the DMN 
pathways, particularly the ventromedial PFC and its regulation of reactivity within 
subcortical and insular brain regions (83). Decreased affect reactivity would be expected to 
decrease the need for unhealthy avoidance or suppression of emotional responses.

A separate line of research has examined changes in affective reactivity to provocative 
stimuli following exercise training in the setting of intentional weight loss. This work 
suggests that behavioral training exercise may diminish participant SN reactivity to salient 
food cues, particularly within the ventral striatum and insula (84). In a similar study using a 
crossover design (85), 60 min of exercise among habitual exercisers reduced activation in the 
putamen and peri-insular brain regions to high-energy food cues. Similarly, Cornier and 
colleagues (84) found that reductions in weight were associated with reduced insular 
activation among overweight/obese adults following a 6-month exercise trial. Taken 
together, this work suggests that exercise might decrease affective reactivity/saliency of food 
cues, increasing ability to control impulses or regulate eating behavior. Increased modulation 
of food responses may also have broader implications for cultivating impulse control and 
self-regulatory capacity, which holds importance for reduced substance use risk, behavioral 
impulsivity, and overall improvements in mental health functioning.

COGNITIVE CONTROL/FLEXIBILITY

Exercise training programs often include behavior change strategies in the context of 
intervention delivery, particularly for home-based training paradigms. Behavior change

strategies include behavioral self-regulatory skills such as goal setting, activity planning 
(including behavioral activation), adaptive problem solving, the provision of feedback, and 
self-monitoring (86), all of which overlap with key elements of traditional CBT. When these 
strategies are utilized in behavioral trials among individuals with mental health conditions, 
they likely play an active therapeutic role and may partially explain treatment improvements 
(87). As detailed below, effective behavioral engagement and self-monitoring are frequently 
impaired in individuals with depression and anxiety. Interventions cultivating these skill sets 
may therefore offer opportunities for experiential practice of clinically relevant skill domains 
in the service of exercise titration and maintenance.

Conventional exercise training programs teach participants to identify and implement goals 
that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely (SMART goals), in order to 
optimize exercise participation and maintenance. Through the process of setting SMART 
goals, striving toward them, and evaluating iterative progress, participants cultivate realistic 
expectations for themselves and internalize a sense of behavioral control. Realistic goal 
setting and attainment also contribute to ER by increasing self-mastery, increasing agency, 
and establishing new, positive associations with self-concept. The process of self-monitoring 
(tracking behavior and its consequences) may also build a greater capacity to identify and 
repeat behaviors that are effective, as well as identifying maladaptive behavioral patterns.

Several mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety, are notable for 
impairments in cognitive flexibility and attentional control. Difficulties include poor set-
shifting abilities (i.e., difficulty switching between tasks or altering behavior in response to 
feedback) (88), selective attention, and distractibility. Sustained attention and vigilance are 
also impaired across many mental health conditions, particularly in depression, where 
patients have difficulties sustaining engagement toward goal-directed targets over prolonged 
periods of time. Competing cognitive processes, such as rumination or excessive worry, may 
divert attention away from effective task performance and increase emotional suffering.

Impairments in cognitive control domains, including cognitive flexibility and executive 
function, have been repeatedly tied to behavioral treatment outcomes (89–91). Similarly, 
behavioral treatments improving cognitive flexibility and executive function also tend to 
favorably impact depression and anxiety outcomes (89). For example, cognitive flexibility is 
a putative treatment mechanism of mindfulness-based stress reduction, which has been 
shown to increase resting-state connectivity within ECN brain areas following training (92). 
As noted above, exercise training appears to have preferentially favorable effects on 
executive functions (76) and connectivity within ECN brain areas (57). Notably, poorer 
cognitive control is also a robust predictor of inadequate PA maintenance (28, 93), 
suggesting that poorer cognitive control is likely to present barriers both for initial 
acquisition of self-regulatory skills for PA engagement and utilization of these skills for 
maintenance over time.

Several newer CBTs teach mindfulness to decrease engagement in unproductive mental 
activities and improve capacity to be in the present moment. Exercise training programs may 
increase the ability to direct and sustain attention to the present, particularly if exercises are 
sufficiently difficult. In this case, effective engagement in the activity requires full attention

to the task and awareness of a narrowed set of stimuli (e.g., one’s breathing and ability to 
pace breathing). These behavioral mechanisms may change in tandem with neurobiological-
mediated decreases in the saliency of some stimuli (described above) and potentiation of 
reward, as detailed below.

Self-efficacy

Individual self-regulatory behaviors are also important for mental health functioning through 
their overlapping influences on self-efficacy (73). Broadly defined, self-efficacy refers to an 
individual’s confidence in their ability to achieve specific, personally significant goals. 
Greater engagement in PA has been shown to increase exercise self-efficacy (73), associated 
with improved body image and physical quality of life, and increases the likelihood of 
sustained PA maintenance over time (94). In addition, many of the domains reviewed above 
align closely with key conceptual elements of improved self-efficacy, including monitoring 
of performance accomplishments, behavioral modeling, social persuasion, and adaptive 
interpretation of physiological states. Recent meta-analytic syntheses suggest that exercise 
interventions confer moderately large improvements in self-efficacy across adolescent and 
adult cohorts (ES = 0.59) (95). The total number of behavior change strategies demonstrates 
the strongest associations with improved PA, regardless of the specific strategy used (96).

Reinforcement/Reward

A poverty of reinforcement or adaptive reward may lead to increased negative affect (e.g., 
depression) or the development of maladaptive behavior patterns to increase positive 
feelings (e.g., substance abuse). There is an extensive literature on increasing reinforcers/
reward as a treatment mechanism of depression through behavioral activation (97). Newer 
CBTs, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, link behavioral activation specifically 
to personal values, which may function to augment its reinforcement value or function as an 
establishing operation, and/or help sustain activity engagement. Behavioral activation often 
includes exercise or other forms of PA and may therefore both increase opportunities for 
positive reinforcement and cultivate realistic expectations regarding loss and reward, both of 
which may improve mental health. In addition, individual differences in reward sensitivity 
likely explain part of the observed heterogeneity in intermediate, positive consequences of 
PA (e.g., improved mood or fitness), which have been associated with the self-reinforcing 
nature of habitual PA and maintenance (74).

Dysfunctional reward sensitivity is a core feature increasing the risk of depression and 
serves as a key barrier to implementation of many therapeutic interventions. Exercise 
training has been postulated to improve reward sensitivity by augmenting dopaminergic 
function. Focusing on goal-directed behaviors has been shown to enhance top-down 
activation within the ventromedial PFC and ventral striatum, as well as downregulating 
insular and amygdala activation during stressful activities (98). Individuals engaging in 
habitual PA demonstrate differential activation of the ventral striatum, a critical dopamine 
hub, compared to their sedentary counterparts following acute exercise training (99). 
Individuals accustomed to habitual PA also show improved reward system functioning 
compared to sedentary counterparts, a relationship that does not appear to differ based on 
physical fitness (100).

FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR TAILORED TREATMENTS

Clearly specifying both neurological and behavioral mechanisms that link exercise to mental 
health and how they might interact synergistically to produce outcomes may have 
implications for the design of exercise programs to potentiate training engagement and 
optimize outcomes for individuals or groups of individuals. Pre-existing neurobiological 
differences might explain the extent to which exercise interventions are effectively engaged 
and/or suggest indirect mechanisms of benefit in the context of exercise training. Repeated 
measurement and network analyses may be able to help disentangle the associations among 
elements that are probably mutually facilitative.

As reviewed above, both neurobiological markers of neuroplasticity and behavioral markers 
of self-regulatory function hold relevance in the development of future exercise training 
paradigms. Future studies should integrate phenotypic markers of neuroplasticity into 
intervention development in order to optimize intervention engagement. For example, 
individuals with blunted reward sensitivity may have difficulty with initial exercise 
engagement and therefore be less likely to adequately engage with or complete supervised 
training programs. These individuals may benefit from more gradual titration of activity, 
motivational priming prior to training sessions, or enhancement of reward reinforcement 
cues using external sources. Similarly, individuals with evidence of cognitive inflexibility 
and/or executive dysfunction may have difficulty with exercise maintenance and could 
benefit from receiving either greater external regulatory support (e.g., structured classes or 
exercise with a spouse) or additional self-management training to increase the likelihood of 
continued PA for optimal ER.

Future studies should also systematically assess and quantify individual differences in self-
regulatory skills across participants, both as a baseline predictor of treatment engagement 
and across time as a mechanism of treatment improvements. Specifying individual 
differences in self-regulatory skills at baseline might also allow for effective treatment 
matching (matching individuals to exercise programs that they are more likely to be 
successful with or to programs that are more likely to address skill deficits and improve 
overall health and well-being) or tailoring of existing interventions to optimize outcomes. 
For example, individuals with difficulty regulating affect may also tend to avoid emotional 
or interoceptive discomfort, and they may experience increased sensitivity to arousal due to 
either distressing past experiences or inaccurate beliefs that arousal is dangerous. 
Irrespective of its precise origin, this behavioral tendency would suggest the need for 
differential titration of activity, greater usage of distraction techniques, or self-monitoring for 
titration based on external biometric sources (e.g., heart rate) that are not overly dependent 
on self-referential attention to interoceptive cues. These participants could also be trained to 
gain mastery by resisting urges to avoid or escape aversive cues or to use strategies to 
modulate arousal such that it can be sustained during a window of tolerance, which may be 
gradually expanded over time.

In addition, future RCTs may benefit from the use of optimization designs to determine the 
relative importance of priming neuroplasticity in order to achieve better mental health 
outcomes. RCTs utilizing sequential randomization to treat depression, for example, could

re-randomize participants contingent upon connectivity or executive functioning changes, 
suggesting enhanced neuroplasticity as an intermediate marker of treatment responsivity. 
Similarly, trials examining exercise maintenance could benefit from provision of external 
support strategies among individuals with poorer self-regulatory capacity, including 
integration of social support or greater ease of access to exercise training equipment. 
Because these individuals will be less likely to self-initiate behavioral modifications or 
flexibly adapt their behavioral responses for exercise maintenance, additional environmental 
support is critical for outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, aerobic and resistance exercise training hold promise in the treatment and 
management of mental health conditions, particularly depression and anxiety. Emerging 
evidence suggests that changes in underlying neuroplasticity may be an important individual 
difference explaining heterogeneous treatment benefits. In addition, underlying individual 
differences in neuroplasticity, either at baseline or in intervention-related changes, likely 
have significant implications for individuals developing and sustaining behavioral self-
regulatory skills essential for mental health. These factors likely work in synergy, creating a 
“virtuous cycle” to predict long-term effects of exercise on mental health. By clearly 
specifying both neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms linking exercise to improved 
mental health, it may be possible to optimize treatment effects and personalize training 
approaches for maximal benefit.
