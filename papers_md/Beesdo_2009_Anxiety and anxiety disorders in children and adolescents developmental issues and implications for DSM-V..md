Abstract

This review summarizes findings on the epidemiology and etiology of anxiety disorders among
children and adolescents including separation anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia,
agoraphobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, also highlighting critical aspects of
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Childhood and adolescence is the core risk phase for the
development of anxiety symptoms and syndromes, ranging from transient mild symptoms to full-
blown anxiety disorders. This article critically reviews epidemiological evidence covering
prevalence, incidence, course, and risk factors. The core challenge in this age span is the
derivation of developmentally more sensitive assessment methods. Identification of characteristics
that could serve as solid predictors for onset, course, and outcome will require prospective designs
that assess a wide range of putative vulnerability and risk factors. This type of information is
important for improved early recognition and differential diagnosis as well as prevention and
treatment in this age span.

ANXIETYAND ANXIETY DISORDERS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS

AND ITS ASSESSMENT

Childhood and adolescence is the core risk phase for the development of symptoms and
syndromes of anxiety that may range from transient mild symptoms to full-blown anxiety
disorders. Challenges from a research perspective include its reliable and clinically valid
assessment to determine its prevalence and patterns of incidence, and the longitudinal
characterization of its natural course to better understand what characteristics are solid
predictors for more malignant courses as well as which are likely to be associated with
benign patterns of course and outcome. This type of information is particularly needed from
a clinical perspective to inform about improved early recognition and differential diagnosis
as well as preventions and treatment in this age span.

Anxiety refers to the brain response to danger, stimuli that an organism will actively attempt
to avoid. This brain response is a basic emotion already present in infancy and childhood,

with expressions falling on a continuum from mild to severe. Anxiety is not typically
pathological as it is adaptive in many scenarios when it facilitates avoidance of danger.
Strong cross-species parallels—both in organisms’ responses to danger and in the
underlying brain circuitry engaged by threats—likely reflect these adaptive aspects of
anxiety.1 One frequent and established conceptualization is that anxiety becomes
maladaptive when it interferes with functioning, for example when associated with
avoidance behavior, most likely to occur when anxiety becomes overly frequent, severe, and
persistent.2 Thus, pathological anxiety at any age can be characterized by persisting or
extensive degrees of anxiety and avoidance associated with subjective distress or
impairment. The differentiation between normal and pathological anxiety, however, can be
particularly difficult in children because children manifest many fears and anxieties as part
of typical development3,4 (Table 1). Although these phenomena might be acutely
distressing, they occur in most children and are typically transient. For example, separation
anxiety normatively occurs at 12 to 18 months, fears of thunder or lightning at 2 to 4 years,
and so forth. Thus, given that such anxiety occurs in most children and typically does not
persist, distress, in and of itself, represents an inadequate criterion for distinguishing among
normal and pathological anxiety states in children. This problem creates unique challenges
when trying to distinguish among normal, subclinical, and pathological anxiety states in
children. Other challenges in the assessment of childhood fears and anxiety are that children
at younger ages may have difficulties in communicating cognition, emotions, and avoidance,
as well as the associated distress and impairments, to the diagnostician5 because they might
lack the cognitive capabilities used to communicate information vital to the application of
the diagnostic classification system. Thus, developmental differences (eg, cognition,
language skills, emotional understanding) must be carefully considered when assessing
anxiety in young people to make a diagnostic decision.6

Anxiety disorders are described and classified in diagnostic systems such as the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, currently version IV-TR, American
Psychiatric Association)2 or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, currently
version 10, World Health Organization)7 (Table 2). Across these systems, many anxiety
disorders share common clinical features such as extensive anxiety, physiological anxiety
symptoms, behavioral disturbances such as extreme avoidance of feared objects, and
associated distress or impairment. Nonetheless, differences exist and it should be noted that
narrowly categorized anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, agoraphobia, and subtypes of
specific phobias also exhibit a substantial degree of phenotypical diversity or heterogeneity.

In the assessment of anxiety features in children one has to recognize that the core
diagnostic criteria might present differently in the young, requiring special assessment
strategies and the recognition of special features that are unique to or characteristic for this
age group. DSM-IV acknowledges this by adding for some disorders, though not
consistently, some of the features that might present differently in children and adolescents.
With the exception of separation anxiety disorder, all of the anxiety disorders in DSM-IV
are grouped together irrespective of the age at which the disorder manifests; separation
anxiety disorder, in contrast, is defined as manifesting before adulthood. Thus for most of
the anxiety disorders, differences between diagnostic criteria for children and adults, if any,
are provided within the same criteria set. Examples include duration commentaries,
differences in symptom type or count, or insights into the excessiveness/inadequacy of fear
(Table 2). More specifically, for example, the threshold in DSM-IV for diagnosing
generalized anxiety disorder is lower in children than adults (1 instead of 3 out of 6
symptoms); in phobias, children are not required to judge their anxiety as excessive or
unreasonable, yet duration must be at least 6 months among individuals under the age of 18
years. For ICD-10, in contrast to DSM-IV, children receive other diagnostic codings,
separate from adults, for anxiety disorders that reflect exaggerations of normal

developmental trends. The specific differences in diagnosis and diagnostic criteria between
children and adults for DSM-IV and ICD-10 are listed in Table 2.

It should be noted that it remains unspecified as to what age range the “child-specific”
diagnostic criteria refer. Given cognitive and language development, the increasing
importance of peer relationships, and the seeking of autonomy from parents, it is crucial to
specify similarities and differences in anxiety expressions for different ages (eg, childhood
up to 12 years, adolescence 13 to 17 years). This important issue is rarely acknowledged in
the current diagnostic criteria, and not even in the text portions of the DSM that generally
contain important additional information for diagnosticians and clinicians (see Table 2).

There is also little guidance in the diagnostic systems on developmentally appropriate
assessment of anxiety disorders to identify those in need of treatment. Although the
development of explicit descriptive diagnostic criteria has facilitated the development of
diagnostic instruments for the assessment of anxiety disorders, diagnosticians and clinicians
should be aware of their limitations, particularly related to developmental issues in obtaining
self-reports from children and adolescents.6,8,9

Table 3 provides a selection of the most commonly used diagnostic tools for assessment of
anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. In children,
applications of these tools to younger children might be more problematic than to older
children, as reflected in poorer psychometric data. This problem undoubtedly at least partly
reflects the difficulty young children face when trying to communicate information about
internally experienced affective states.5 Therefore, assessments in young children often
require solicitation of information from multiple sources beyond the child to reliably and
validly distinguish among normal anxiety, subclinical, and pathological anxiety syndromes
and disorders. This assessment includes parent or teacher reports. In older children and
adolescents, in contrast, diagnostic decisions can rely heavily on information provided
directly by the patient, although even in this age group parallel informants can also be
helpful.

Beyond these problems, unclear rules for applying diagnostic thresholds and variations in
the methods used to aggregate information from different sources may drastically influence
prevalence estimates (see later discussion) and might also impact findings from basic and
epidemiological research. Thus, anxiety disorders in children and adolescents cannot be
easily assessed with standard questionnaires or interviews that have been derived from adult
instruments. In fact, the use of structured and standardized interviews for children and
adolescents has much improved the reliability and validity of anxiety diagnoses in children
and adolescents in the last 2 decades. Such instruments also have an advantage over
symptom scales in that they allow a better delineation of transient subclinical manifestations
of anxiety from anxiety disorders that were shown to have predictive validity and even
concrete implications for prevention early intervention, and treatment.

The next section highlights developmental issues in anxiety, with focus on anxiety disorders
(1) by critically reviewing recent data on the prevalence, incidence, age of onset, natural
course, and longitudinal outcome of anxiety disorders, including comorbidity and
psychosocial impairments and disabilities, and (2) by addressing important correlates and
potential risk factors. The review focuses on the following categorically defined anxiety
disorders: separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, social phobia, agoraphobia, panic
disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Obsessive-compulsive disorder and
posttraumatic stress disorder are not covered in this article because of additional
complicating issues involved with these diagnoses, for example, controversy in regard to
their grouping with the other anxiety disorders.10 As an attempt is made to provide

years).

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ANXIETY DISORDERS IN CHILDHOOD AND

ADOLESCENCE

Prevalence and Onset

There is persuasive evidence from a range of studies that anxiety disorders are the most
frequent mental disorders in children and adolescents, and thus seem to be the earliest of all
forms of psychopathology. The onset of anxiety disorders (or symptoms/syndromes of
anxiety) has been assessed in youth and adult samples, in cross-sectional and longitudinal
surveys, most frequently by using the answers of the respondents to questions like “When
was the first time you experienced…” (Fig. 1). Of note, such reports may be subject to recall
bias,11 particularly in studies among older adults or in studies that retrospectively cover long
time periods. As a consequence, reports of mean ages of onset are likely to be heavily
influenced by the age range of the studied population (higher mean estimates in adult
studies). Thus, age of onset distribution curves that cumulate recently assessed new cases
across age (Fig. 2) are more informative and reliable with regard to actual onset patterns and
core incidence periods (ie, high-risk phases for first onset of disorders).

Findings suggest that onset of the first or any anxiety disorder is clearly in childhood (eg,
Refs.12,13,14). Yet, leaving aside that some anxiety disorders might be preceded in their
onset by other earlier comorbid anxiety disorders, there is some noteworthy heterogeneity
between the specific anxiety disorders that reveals a temporal sequence of core risk periods
for first onset of anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence. In terms of validation these
differences in age of onset provide one important indicator for separating different types of
anxiety disorders.15 The earliest age of onset has been consistently found for separation
anxiety disorder and some types of specific phobias (particularly the animal, blood injection
injury, and environmental type), with most cases emerging in childhood before the age of 12
years,12,16,17 followed by the onset of social phobia with incidences in late childhood and
throughout adolescence, with very few cases emerging after the age of 25.12,18,19 Panic
disorder, agoraphobia, and GAD, in contrast, have their core periods for first onset in later
adolescence with further first incidences in early adulthood,12,14,20 despite the fact that
some cases, especially with panic attacks, might occur as early as age 12 years or before.21
Particularly for GAD as defined by the 6-month duration criterion, new cases also emerge
throughout middle and late adulthood.12,20,22 It should be noted, however, that some doubts
have been expressed about whether the 6-month duration criterion for GAD is appropriate in
general23,24 and useful in children and adolescents in particular.25 Indirect evidence for
GAD of shorter duration comes from studies using the former diagnosis of overanxious
disorder (OAD), for which considerably earlier onsets and higher prevalence rates have been
found among children (Table 4). Although the lack of specific diagnostic continuity for
OAD into adulthood26 might speak against the definition of GAD by using a shorter
duration, an accordant change of diagnostic criteria of GAD for children in DSM-V is
currently under investigation.

Fig. 2 graphs for males and females the age of onset distribution of anxiety disorders
assessed in a prospective-longitudinal community study (Early Developmental Stages of
Psychopathology, EDSP) among adolescents and young adults up to age 34 years. No
remarkable gender differences in onset patterns occur with 2 exceptions: compared with
females, males exhibit a somewhat earlier onset of specific phobia of natural environmental
type, and a later onset of GAD.

Prevalence estimates in aggregated age groups (see Fig. 1) also give some convergent,
though crude indications for the early onset of a disorder. Prevalence estimates (Table 4)
tend to further increase with age among children and adolescents for GAD, social phobia,
panic disorder, and agoraphobia, which is not seen with the same magnitude in specific
phobia or separation anxiety disorder. Confirming retrospective age of onset information,
these data allow one to define “core periods of risk” for the first anxiety disorder onset in
childhood for the latter conditions and in adolescence for the former conditions. Similar
conclusions emerge from incidence estimates (proportions of new-onset cases between 2
assessment waves among those who were previously not affected) from prospective-
longitudinal studies.17,27

Frequency of Anxiety Disorders

Community prevalence estimates (see Table 4) vary slightly due to differences in the studied
age groups, assessment instruments (eg, Composite International Diagnostic Interview
[CIDI], Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for school-aged
children [K-SADS]), information source (eg, self-report, parent/teacher report), method of
data aggregation (from multiple information sources or multiple assessment waves), and the
diagnostic systems used (ie, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV, ICD-10). In addition, data aggregation
from various assessment waves in prospective-longitudinal studies, the number and type of
diagnoses included in summary categories (eg, “any” anxiety disorder), and the strictness of
application of criteria in generating diagnoses (eg, impairment required or not) are other
sources for variance. Differences in prevalence estimates from different countries are
unlikely reflective of true regional differences, although it should be noted that most
epidemiological studies examine prevalence in Western, industrialized countries that may
differ from developing countries or other cultures.

Despite notable variation in prevalence estimates that is likely due to method variance, the
lifetime prevalence of “any anxiety disorder” in studies with children or adolescents is about
15% to 20%. In particular, it is noteworthy that the period prevalence estimates, for example
1-year or 6-month rates, are not considerably lower than lifetime estimates. This fact
indirectly indicates that anxiety disorders exhibit a persisting course or that high rates of
forgetting occur for remitted disorders. The most frequent disorders among children and
adolescents are separation anxiety disorder (not included in Table 4), with estimates of 2.8%
and 8%,28,29,30 and specific and social phobias, with rates up to around 10% and 7%,
respectively. Agoraphobia and panic disorder are low-prevalence conditions in childhood
(1% or lower); higher prevalences are found in adolescence (2%–3% for panic and 3%–4%
for agoraphobia). Of note, considerable controversy surrounds the diagnosis of agoraphobia.
Whereas some epidemiological studies find high rates of agoraphobia without evidence of
panic attacks, some suggest that this finding reflects diagnostic inaccuracy in
epidemiological studies.31 This issue generally has not been addressed with the same level
of rigor in studies of children and adolescents, compared with studies in adults. However,
recent findings from the EDSP study among adolescents and young adults suggest that
agoraphobia exists as a clinically significant phobic condition independent of panic.21

As mentioned before, it is more difficult to provide precise prevalence estimates of GAD in
children and adolescents, because this diagnosis only has been applied to youth in DSM-IV,
published in 1994.2 Before 1994, children presenting with worries about multiple events,
who typically would receive the DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD, were given the diagnosis of
OAD but not GAD. When OAD was subsumed under the diagnosis of GAD in DSM-IV,
different criteria were applied to children with multiple worries in DSM-IV, relative to
earlier nosologies. This situation complicates attempts to compare earlier to later studies but
may explain the lower prevalence rates for GAD than for OAD. Thus, a proportion of
children and adolescents who were diagnosed with OAD in the past seem to remain

undiagnosed based on current GAD criteria. Similarly, GAD criteria may also identify some
children and adolescents who would not meet DSM-III-R criteria for OAD. Data from the
EDSP study revealed a cumulative incidence for GAD of 4.3% at age 34 years with
relatively few onsets observed in childhood, and the core incidence period being in
adolescence and young adulthood.14

In terms of sex differences, all anxiety disorders more frequently occur among females than
among males. Although sex differences may occur as early as childhood they increase with
age,32 reaching ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 in adolescence (eg, Refs.28,33). Fig. 3 depicts the
cumulative incidence for anxiety disorders among females and males as assessed in the
EDSP study. Unlike for panic attacks (compare Ref.21), the sex difference in panic disorder
is apparent in cases before the age of 14 but increases further between the ages of 14 and 25
years. The incidence curve for panic disorder reveals a very clear-cut period of increased
incidence in females between the ages of 13 and 26 years, whereas males display lower
estimates and the period of increased incidence is less pronounced. Agoraphobia revealed a
strong and steady incidence increase for females after the age of 6, whereas agoraphobia in
males was observed less frequently, with some indication of increased incidence between
the ages of 15 and 20 and a leveling off after the age of 25 years. In contrast, a clear sex
difference in prevalence was already seen in childhood in the specific phobia animal type
(ratio 3:1 by age 10 years).

The choice of appropriate categorical diagnostic thresholds remains a critical issue, giving
rise to the consideration of dimensional measures replacing the up to now problematic
diagnostic “cutoffs.”34 There is little doubt that the nature of psychopathology is more
appropriately conceptualized by dimensional measures and that there is no evidence for a
natural point of rarity for most disorders, including anxiety disorders and core anxiety
features. In this respect the DSM-IV clinical significance criterion—requiring distress or
impairment in social or role functioning—which was introduced to decrease the false-
positive problem in psychiatric diagnosis, is particularly problematic.35 Prevalence rates
would markedly increase when the clinical significance criterion threshold simply is lowered
or omitted (eg, Ref.36). In DSM, such subjects with “subclinical anxiety” would then be
classified under “Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention.” As for
adults, there is considerable evidence that children and adolescents not meeting the DSM
defined clinical significance threshold might still reveal a similar range of adverse correlates
as those meeting the threshold (eg, Ref.33). Critical questions therefore are “how can clinical
significance or dysfunction be ideally defined” and “what constitutes clinical significance in
children versus adolescents versus adults?” Another related concern is that any solution for
the distress or impairment criterion that would be applied to anxiety disorders should ideally
also be applied to other mental disorders for the reason of consistency.

Similarly, other critical issues relate to symptomatic thresholds required for diagnosis, ie,
symptom number, intensity, severity, and temporal thresholds such as duration, persistence,
and the clustering of symptoms and criteria in a given time frame.37 Despite given clinical
significance (ie, distress or impairment), such conditions would be classified under the
nonspecific residual category “Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.” With few
exceptions, criteria for children resemble those for adults. Particularly for diagnosis with
high symptomatic threshold criteria, it may be clinically relevant to lower the threshold for
children (eg, shorter duration requirement, fewer symptoms), to detect affected children
early and to provide adequate and focused interventions. Such critical issues have raised
significant concerns toward the DSM-V as to whether dimensional and developmental
aspects should be specified to provide more clinically relevant information to facilitate
diagnosis and treatment.34,35,37,38,39

A graphical presentation of the criteria threshold problem is shown in Fig. 4. For each of the
anxiety diagnoses, DSM-IV provides a specified diagnostic criteria set including symptom
count, time/persistence, and clinical significance requirements reflecting the threshold for
diagnosis. Falling short of just one criterion leads to nondiagnosis (or nonspecific
classification such as “Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified” or “Other Conditions
That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”) despite the presence of significant specific
anxiety Fig. 4A). Thus, the inclusion pathology ( of dimensional facets in diagnostic systems
may facilitate diagnosis and treatment, but it my also complicate the assessment (ie, by use
of rating scales or questionnaires, or by the need to develop such scales). Clinicians should
also keep in mind that the time point and time frame of assessment may be crucial for
diagnosis and diagnostic decisions; aspects also essential for interpreting the
epidemiological data adequately. Thus, a lifetime diagnostic approach that describes all
psychopathological phenomena in a person up to the age of assessment might yield very
different diagnostic data than a cross-sectional approach that covers, for example, a 4-week
or a 12-month time frame (compare Fig. 4B); for some diagnoses (like panic/agoraphobia
within the anxiety spectrum or bipolar disorders in the mood disorders) a lifetime approach
is essential. Variation in assessment might also affect the rates of “subclinical” or
“subsyndromal/subthreshold” conditions, simply because a cross-sectional subthreshold
condition may have been threshold at a previous point in time, thus more appropriately
labeled as partially remitted.

Natural Course and Longitudinal Outcome—Knowledge on the natural course of
anxiety disorders after their first onset is increasing, although several methodological
challenges exist. Biases of various sorts are inherent in studies based on clinical samples or
in studies using retrospective information on course. Such methods may lead to
overestimations of the degree to which anxiety disorders typically seem chronic. Hence,
longitudinal studies have clear advantages, particularly when they are based on
representative community samples assessed throughout the core high-risk period of first
onset and subsequent potential periods of chronic illness. As such, these types of studies
represent the method of first choice to study the natural course of anxiety disorders (Fig. 5).
Although such studies are costly and time consuming, several studies among youth have
become available (Table 5).

Anxiety disorders seem to take a chronic course based on findings from clinical adult
populations (eg, Refs.40,41) or retrospective studies (eg, Refs.42,43). Prospective
epidemiologic follow-up studies among youth from the community only partially support
these observations. Thus, on one hand, this work does show that individuals diagnosed with
an anxiety disorder, compared with those without, are at statistically increased risk to have
the same disorder (eg, Refs.26,28; compare Table 5) or signs and symptoms of the same
disorder25,44,45 at later points in time (“homotypic continuity”). Moreover, follow-back
analyses also reveal that those with anxiety disorders in adulthood frequently had the same
problems earlier in life (eg, Ref.46).

Nevertheless, despite significant longitudinal associations, stability rates (in the form of
proportions) of anxiety disorders among youth from the community are overall only low to
moderate. For example, in the 15-year prospective multiwave Zurich Cohort study47 a low
stability (4%) was found for pure anxiety disorder, defined as GAD or panic disorder. For
social phobia no individual met diagnostic criteria continuously at each follow-up
assessment, after the disorder had manifested.48 In the prospective-longitudinal EDSP study,
in adolescents aged 14 to 17 at baseline the probability of a positive outcome at 2-year
follow-up decreased as a function of severity of baseline anxiety diagnostic status.45
However, only 19.7% of threshold baseline anxiety cases met threshold anxiety criteria
again at follow-up. For the specific diagnoses, considerable variability in outcome was

revealed. Taking stable threshold and subthreshold diagnoses at baseline and at follow-up,
panic disorder (44%) and specific phobia (30.1%) were found to be most stable, but even
here more than 50% of cases were not completely stable. Other disorders showed higher
rates of instability, with agoraphobia (13.4%) and social phobia (15.8%) being particularly
unstable. Similar trends emerge from clinical studies with youth as well as in an additional
series of epidemiological studies (see for review Ref.49). For example, Last and
colleagues13,50 found among children and adolescents (aged 5–19 years) with anxiety
disorders that over the 3- to 4-year follow-up, 80% had remitted from the anxiety shown
initially. Thus overall, among children and adolescents with an anxiety disorder, there is a
considerable degree of fluctuation in diagnostic status of the specific anxiety disorder
examined; anxiety disorders have a strong tendency to naturally wax and wane over time,
particularly in young age groups.45 It is particularly remarkable that even in disorders that
are defined as being chronic, such as GAD, prospective stability rates are only moderate.51

Given the limited homotypic continuity observed in prospective-longitudinal community
studies among youth, the question arises as to whether children and adolescents whose
specific anxiety disorder seems to improve or remit are completely healthy in their further
course of life. The answer is that this is clearly not the case. For example, in the EDSP only
10% of children and adolescents with specific phobias at baseline had no mental disorder at
10-year follow-up (full diagnostic remission); 41% reported the same disorder (strict
homotypic continuity) and overall, 73% were diagnosed with any anxiety or depressive
disorder at subsequent assessments (heterotypic continuity).52 Similarly, only 13% of
baseline social phobia cases were free of any diagnosis during the 10-year follow-up; 35%
and 64% reported the same disorder and any anxiety/depression respectively. For GAD and
PTSD, even all baseline cases revealed either homotypic or heterotypic continuity. Similar
findings emerge from other multiwave, prospective-longitudinal studies.13,28,47,53 Thus,
even if for many anxiety cases strict homotypic continuity is moderate, there is a substantial
degree of continuity of psychopathology as indicated by the later presence of other anxiety
disorders (broad homotypic continuity) or other disorders (heterotypic continuity).

In children and adolescents, there is considerable interanxiety (homotypic) comorbidity with
significant association between virtually all specific anxiety disorders, including specific
phobia subtypes.54 The number of “pure” anxiety cases decreases with age in favor of
patterns with multiple anxiety disorders by late adolescence or early adulthood. The “load”
of anxiety seems to contribute to the development of secondary psychopathological
complications. For example, Woodward and Fergusson55 examined life course outcomes of
adolescents with anxiety disorders in a 21-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265
New Zealand children (CHDS). There were significant associations between the number of
anxiety disorders reported in adolescence and later risks of anxiety disorder, major
depression, substance dependence, and suicidal behavior. In this study, a higher number of
anxiety disorders was also associated with other adverse developmental outcomes such as
educational underachievement and early parenthood.

The development of secondary depression seems to be a particularly frequent and
concerning heterotypic outcome of anxiety disorders. Is this a characteristic of anxiety in
general rather than an issue of specific anxiety disorders or anxiety features (such as panic,
avoidance, accumulation of risk factors)? Or is this related to an overarching anxiety or
anxiety-depression liability, possibly through shared etiopathogenetic mechanisms (eg,
neurobiology)? Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examined the association between
anxiety disorders and depressive disorders14,55,56,57,58 and concluded that anxiety disorders
in general, and also specific types of anxiety disorders (such as phobias, GAD, panic
disorder, and so forth) consequently increase the risk for developing a secondary depressive
disorder. For example, prospective epidemiological studies found that children and

adolescents with specific fears and phobias (especially fear of darkness),59 social phobia,
18,60,61 or other types of anxiety disorders (agoraphobia, panic disorder, GAD)14,61 have an
increased risk of developing a subsequent depressive disorder. This increased risk for
secondary depression seems to be independent of age of onset of anxiety.18 It could further
be shown that certain clinical characteristics of anxiety disorders are associated with
secondary depression risk. Onset of depression is more likely in individuals with a higher
number of anxiety disorders, a more severe impairment of anxiety disorders, and when panic
attacks co-occur.18,61 Panic attacks among youth have also been shown to be a significant
predictor for a wide range of mental disorders and severe psychopathology, particularly as
indicated by the incidence of multiple anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.62

Besides depression, substance abuse or dependence (alcohol or drugs and medication) is a
frequently occurring heterotypic problem among subjects with anxiety disorders.57,63,64 It
has been suggested that substance use is motivated as a possibility to deal with anxiety
symptoms, leading to substance-related problems and disorders over the long term.65 The
onset of anxiety disorders precedes that of alcohol and drug disorders at nearly all levels of
severity of substance use disorders (use, problems, dependence). Anxiety disorders have
been shown to be significant predictors of the subsequent first onset of substance use
disorders in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.65,66,67 Although substance use
disorders are typically associated with so-called externalizing disorders, such as conduct
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or antisocial personality disorder (eg, Ref.
68), there is also a strong and significant association with “internalizing” disorders, including
anxiety disorders.69 This potentially important pathway has recently been overlooked.
Previous research suggests the existence of a second, though less frequent, pathway to
substance use disorders originating in early anxiety disorders.70

Higher-Order Psychopathological Factors and Metastructure—The frequent
observation of comorbidity even in community-based samples has prompted factor
analytical studies of higher-order structures of psychopathology. A 2- to 3-factor solution
has been repeatedly found when using a limited group of anxiety, depressive, substance use,
and antisocial behavior diagnoses.71,72,73,74,75,76 Anxiety and depressive disorders were
consistently loading on an “internalizing” factor that moderately correlates with an
“externalizing” factor reflecting substance use and antisocial disorders. The available adult
studies frequently revealed 2 additional subfactors for internalizing, namely “fear” (which
includes most anxiety disorders) and “anxious-misery” (which includes depressive
disorders, but also GAD and PTSD).71,72,73,74,75 Among youth, this 3-factor structure has
so far been replicated using only the EDSP sample.77

The finding that all types of anxiety disorders accompany depression is clinically somehow
counterintuitive, and therefore several critical concerns have been expressed (see article by
Wittchen and colleagues78 in this issue). Given the differences in incidence patterns of
specific anxiety and other mental disorders, and the heterogeneity in the phenomenology
within and across disorders, it is questionable whether the structure of psychopathology is
stable across development and invariant against the inclusion of more diagnoses. From a
developmental perspective it seems plausible that higher-order structure changes over time,
particularly among youth. Krueger and colleagues76 found a good model fit for the 2-factor
internalizing-externalizing solution in a young community sample at 2 time points which,
however, were only 3 years apart (at ages 18 and 21 years). A similar type of exploration
covering longer time frames and age groups is currently under way.79

Epidemiology clearly shows that anxiety disorders as early-onset conditions are risk factors
for the development of depressive and other disorders occurring later in life. Thus, if one
aims to derive a clinically more meaningful taxonomy of mental and anxiety disorders, the

need to explore other concepts might arise. For example, one approach, taken from somatic
illnesses, might be longitudinal “staging models.” Such models would allow one to describe
the progression of mental disorders over time from less severe, pure conditions to more
complex, severe comorbid stages and thus may have greater potential value for specifying
the complexity of developmental patterns of mental disorders.39 From a clinical perspective,
such a view might also facilitate the derivation of secondary prevention and staged
intervention.

CORRELATES AND RISK FACTORS FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS

Many variables are considered to be risk factors for anxiety disorders. Attempts to
definitively demonstrate that the many correlates of anxiety are, in reality, risk factors face
considerable methodological hurdles, because it must be demonstrated that the risk factor is
actually present before the onset of the anxiety disorder,80 and ideally that the probability of
onset of a disorder is related to the severity, frequency, or duration of the risk factor. Thus,
cross-sectional studies merely allow generation of initial hypotheses about potential risk
factors, based on demonstrations of associations between anxiety disorders and a range of
potential variables, such as demographic, neurobiologic, family-genetic, personality, or
environmental factors; prospective-longitudinal studies are necessary to show that a factor
increases the risk for the onset of an anxiety disorder. This problem, of course, does not
apply to factors that are present at birth, such as sex or genotype information. Therefore, in
the following sections the authors differentiate between evidence for correlates and risk
factors for anxiety disorders. Aspects of specificity of these factors for specific anxiety
disorders and for anxiety versus depressive disorders are also considered. The focus is
primarily on epidemiological studies among youth, as clinical samples may be subject to
various biases related to ascertainment;81 however, such studies are included if no other
evidence is available. Findings from epidemiological studies among adults are also included
if these allow for the assumption that the variables had an impact in childhood or
adolescence.

Demographic Variables

Sex: Female sex consistently emerges as a risk factor for the development of anxiety
disorders. Females are about twice as likely as males to develop each of the anxiety
disorders (eg, Refs.28,33,82). Sex differences in prevalence, if any, are small in childhood but
they increase with age.32

Education: Most epidemiological studies find higher rates of anxiety disorders among
subjects with lower education in comparison with subjects with a higher education (eg, Ref.
33). It remains unclear to which degree the lower educational performance is a predictor,
correlate, or consequence of anxiety. Two adult studies found associations for anxiety but
not for depressive disorders.83,84

Financial situation: With few exceptions,85,86 studies consistently find associations
between low household income or unsatisfactory financial situations and anxiety disorders
(eg, Ref.33). However, results from a quasi-experimental study suggest that these
associations may not emerge through a risk factor-disorder association; other more complex
relationships may explain the associations seen in cross-sectional research.87

Urbanization: Degree of urbanization (rural/urban) does not typically emerge as a correlate
of anxiety disorders.33,85,86

Pathophysiology

Family genetics: Two main approaches have been used to study the familial transmission of
anxiety disorders: family studies and twin studies. In family studies, including community
studies with linked assessments of familial psychopathology, the familial aggregation of
anxiety disorders has been shown to be substantial.88,89,90,91 Overall, children of parents
with at least one anxiety disorder have a substantially increased risk of also having an
anxiety disorder.92 A particular risk emerges for offspring when both parents are
affected88,91 or when the parents suffer from severely impairing, multiple, or early-onset
anxiety disorders.93 Because it is known that anxiety disorders are associated with an
increased risk of depression, it is not surprising that parental depression was also found to be
associated with offspring anxiety,94,95 and that higher rates of depression are also found
among offspring of parents with anxiety disorders.91,96 Such cross-disorder associations
have prompted investigations into the specificity of the familial transmission of anxiety and
other mental disorders. Although findings are mixed, there is some evidence for specificity.
For example, in the longitudinal Oregon study of youth, relatives of subjects with anxiety
disorder alone more frequently also had an anxiety disorder alone. The same applied to pure
depressive disorders. Relatives of adolescents with comorbid anxiety/depression were more
likely to show pure anxiety, pure depression, or comorbid anxiety/depression.97 Moffitt and
colleagues98 showed in the Dunedin birth cohort that familial depression liability was
associated with pure depression but not pure GAD among offspring. In the EDSP study,
Beesdo and colleagues14 showed that parental GAD was associated with anxiety disorders
alone and comorbid anxiety/depressive disorders among offspring, but not with depressive
disorders alone. Thus, a familial transmission of anxiety at least partly independent from
depression is suggested by these findings. Furthermore, some specificity seems to exist in
the familial transmission of specific anxiety disorders,14,99 consistent with findings from the
classic family studies. For example, Fyer and colleagues100 found moderate but specific
familial aggregation of simple phobia, social phobia, and panic disorder with agoraphobia in
families of subjects who had any of these disorders but no other lifetime anxiety disorder
comorbidity.

A meta-analyses of data by Hettema and colleagues90 from family and twin studies of panic
disorder, GAD, and phobias in adults showed that all anxiety disorders have a significant
familial aggregation. Twin studies can disentangle the genetic from the shared and
nonshared environmental contributions in the familial transmission of anxiety disorders.
Findings indicate that the estimated genetic heritabilities across the disorders are generally
no more than modest, falling in the range of 30% to 40%. The considerable remaining
variance in liability can be attributed primarily to individual (nonshared) environmental
factors.101 Regarding specificity, twin studies indicate that the genetic liability for specific
anxiety disorders overlaps partly.101,102 Furthermore, GAD in particular shares genetic
liability with major depression; both disorders, however, can be differentiated based on
environmental risk.103,104

Psychobiology

Anxiety disorders can be viewed as reflecting individual differences in neural function.
Various physiological systems have been examined in animals and humans to document
psychobiological substrates of anxiety. However, it is not clear as to what degree many
neurobiological factors relate to anxiety and anxiety processing in general, or whether they
are specific correlates of anxiety disorders.

Fear-conditioning experiments in animals have demonstrated that the amygdala is involved
in the neural circuit of learning to fear a previously neutral/harmless stimulus.105 Extinction
processes have been shown to require communication between the amygdala and the frontal

cortex. Other forms of fear develop without prior learning and are regulated by distinct but
related neural circuits. Animal research has impressively shown that function of the mature
fear circuit, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) regulation, also reflects
influences during childhood (eg, rearing or stress), but the nature of these influences is likely
to be highly complex.49

In humans, brain imaging procedures have been used to study brain function related to
anxiety. Besides some other brain structures such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex,
106,107 amygdala activity has been frequently examined in emotional face-viewing
paradigms. Findings are inconsistent, but some studies implicate amygdala hypersensitivity
in some forms of anxiety among youth. For example, Thomas and colleagues108 found
enhanced amygdala activation during the viewing of evocative face-emotion displays among
children with anxiety disorders. More specifically, McClure and colleagues107 found among
adolescents with GAD increased amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions,
particularly when they rated subjective degrees of internal fear. Thus, attention modulates
emotion processing and plays an important role in shaping the function of the adolescent
human fear circuit. A recent study examined commonalities and differences in amygdala
activity in anxious versus depressed adolescents.109 During fearful-face processing, patients
with anxiety and those with major depression both differed in amygdala responses from
healthy participants and from each other, but only during a passive viewing condition that
did not require a specific attention task. Focusing attention to rate subjectively experienced
degrees of fear while viewing fearful faces was associated with similar amygdala
hyperactivation in both anxious and depressed adolescents. These data support the view of
neural distinctions between depression and anxiety as complex and nuanced, but clearly
demonstrable. More work is needed to understand commonalities and differences in neural
circuits of the specific anxiety disorders.

Few data are available regarding the question as to whether functional abnormalities occur
as correlate of or vulnerability to anxiety disorders. One study compared amygdala activity
in adults classified as inhibited or not inhibited in childhood,110 and found enhanced
amygdala activity in the formerly inhibited individuals, implicating amygdala function in
risk for anxiety. Another study found that perturbations in amygdala function are evident in
adolescents temperamentally at risk for anxiety, and that attention state alters the underlying
pattern of neural processing, potentially mediating the observed behavioral patterns across
development.111 More such work is needed to understand to what degree findings of
functional neural abnormalities relate to altered processing of anxiety-related cues or reflect
the consequences of anxiety disorders, or whether these abnormalities pose a risk for a
subsequent anxiety disorder onset. Of particular clinical interest, however, is the finding that
brain function abnormalities decrease with successful pharmacological or cognitive-
behavioral treatment (eg, Ref.112).

Temperament and Personality—Temperamental and personality trait vulnerabilities
such as Eysenck’s neuroticism, Gray’s trait-anxiety, or Kagan’s behavioral inhibition, which
are likely to be overlapping constructs, are consistently viewed to play an important role in
anxiety disorders. In fact one might see these constructs as a precursor condition to the
occurrence of prototypical anxiety disorders. The tripartite model conceptualizes general
distress or negative affectivity as general higher-order vulnerability factor for anxiety and
depression, whereas low positive affectivity is specific to depression, and physiological
hyperarousal is specific to anxiety.113,114 Similarly, in a hierarchical model115 negative
affectivity is the higher-order factor relevant for anxiety and depression, but on a lower level
each anxiety disorder contains an additional specific component.

Several studies support the tripartite and the hierarchical models for anxiety and depression
symptoms (eg, Refs.116,117,118). Twin studies consistently show high correlations between
neuroticism and anxiety and depression, as well as their co-occurrence.119,120 It is estimated
that about 50% of the genetic correlations between these disorders derives from the genetic
factor for neuroticism. Epidemiological studies are generally in support of these findings,
with few indications of specificity between anxiety and depression outcomes.121,122

The temperamental concept of behavioral inhibition reflects the consistent tendency to
display fear and withdrawal in unfamiliar situations.123 Behavioral inhibition is at least
moderately stable, detectable early in life, and under some genetic control.124,125 Children
with behavioral inhibition are shy with strangers and fearful in unfamiliar situations.126
With few exceptions,127,128 behavioral inhibition was shown to be a risk factor for the
development of anxiety disorders (eg, Refs.126,129,130). There are also indications for
specificity in this association within the anxiety disorders (strong associations particularly to
social phobia)126,131,132 and in differentiation to depression.14,126

Environmental Factors

Parenting style: Despite the existence of several clinical studies, there are only a few
epidemiological studies examining the question as to whether parenting style is an important
risk factor for anxiety disorders (for an overview, see Ref.133). In the EDSP study among
adolescents, parental overprotection and parental rejection were significantly associated with
increased rates of social phobia in offspring.89,99 Other analyses from this study indicate
that overprotection increases the risk for anxiety disorders but not “pure” depressive
disorders, whereas depressive disorders show associations to rejection.14 Kendler and
colleagues134 examined 1033 female adult twin pairs, and measured 3 dimensions of
parenting (coldness, protectiveness, authoritarianism). High levels of coldness and
authoritarianism in parents were modestly associated with increased risk for nearly all
disorders. Nevertheless, the impact of protectiveness was more variable. Whereas phobia,
GAD, major depression, and panic disorder were significantly associated with
protectiveness, bulimia, drug abuse, and alcohol dependence showed no significant
associations with this particular parenting dimension. In a clinical sample, Merikangas and
colleagues88 did not find an association between family climate or rearing style and anxiety
disorders in offspring of parents with anxiety or substance use disorder. In a prospective-
longitudinal design, parent-adolescent disagreements were found to indirectly increase the
risk for the onset of anxiety and depressive disorders through their direct association with
high symptom levels.135 Considerable other work finds similar relationships, though using
somewhat different procedures.136,137

Social learning mechanisms,138 such as parental modeling of anxious or avoidance behavior,
or parental attitudes and actions139,140,141,142 are discussed as mediating mechanisms of
these relationships, reflecting the aspects of the environment in these family-environmental
factors. However, recent work suggests that such factors also reflect the influence of
genetics, through gene-environment interactions and correlations.143

Childhood adversities: Most epidemiological studies find associations between adverse
experiences in childhood (eg, loss of parents, parental divorce, physical and sexual abuse)
and almost all mental disorders, including anxiety disorders. Kessler and colleagues144
found associations between retrospectively reported childhood adversities, including loss
events (eg, parental divorce), parental psychopathologies (eg, maternal depression),
interpersonal traumas (eg, rape), and subsequent onset of DSM-III-R disorders in a large
United States community study of adults. These adversities were consistently associated
with the onset of anxiety disorders, mood disorders, addictive disorders, and acting out
disorders. Also, a history of neglect or abuse was a strong predictor of psychiatric morbidity

(ie, anxiety disorders, depression, substance use disorders) in the Netherlands Mental Health
Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS).145 In the New Zealand CHDS study, individuals
who reported childhood sexual abuse had higher rates of major depression, anxiety disorder,
conduct disorder, substance use disorder, and suicidal behavior than those not reporting
sexual abuse.146 Furthermore, there were consistent relationships between the extent of
childhood sexual abuse and the risk of mental disorders.

It remains an open question whether the nonspecificity of the findings mainly emerges
because of the frequent comorbidity among disorders. Moffitt and colleagues98 found in the
Dunedin birth cohort study that childhood maltreatment was associated with “pure” GAD
and “pure” major depression, indicating nonspecificity. In the EDSP, however, childhood
separation events were associated only with “pure” anxiety and comorbid anxiety/
depression, but not with “pure” depression.14

Further questions refer to gender differences. For example, several studies suggest that the
relationship between some psychiatric disorders and history of physical or sexual abuse
tends to be stronger for women than for men.147,148

Life events: Although more consistent findings emerge for depressive disorders,149,150
several studies showed associations between life events and anxiety disorders. For example,
in the EDSP study, preceding DSM-IV defined traumatic events predicted subsequent
anxiety and depressive disorders.151 It has been suggested that experience of threat events
tend to precede anxiety disorder, whereas loss events tend to precede depression.152 In a
study that examined the relationship between parental loss before age 17 years and adult
pathology in female same-sex twins from a population-based registry, Kendler and
colleagues153 reported that increased risk for GAD was associated with parental separation.
Increased risk for phobia was associated with parental death but not parental separation.
Moreover, death of persons within the social network were more strongly associated with
major depression than with GAD.154 Moderate specificity in the association between type of
life event and type of psychopathology also emerged in a direct comparison of groups with
pure major depression, pure GAD, and comorbid major depression and GAD.155 Loss and
humiliation events predicted the onset of pure depression, and the onset of comorbid
depression and GAD. Onset of pure GAD was associated with loss and danger events.

Summary of Correlates and Risk Factors—Table 6 summarizes the findings for
correlates and risk factors for anxiety disorders, as well as the indications for specificity
between the anxiety disorders and between anxiety and depression. Two aspects should be
noted. First, this list is not exhaustive; a range of further variables were also found to be of
relevance in the etiology/pathogenesis of anxiety disorders (eg, other mental disorders such
as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, depression, somatic conditions,
attributional and cognitive styles, neurotransmitter systems, HPA function). Second, beyond
the mere identification of risk factors that may increase the probability for the development
of anxiety disorders, it is of particular importance to also disentangle interactions between
risk factors in the promotion of anxiety disorder onset. For example, Knappe and
colleagues99 showed a combined effect of parental psychopathology and parental rearing on
the risk for offspring social phobia, based on prospective-longitudinal community data.
More work is needed to identify the core risk variables and to understand their interplay in
critical time periods.156,157,158 Furthermore, intervention studies are needed to elucidate the
causality status of risk factors.80

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Anxiety disorders are common and early emerging conditions associated with considerable
developmental, psychosocial, and psychopathological complications. Although early anxiety
syndromes may remit spontaneously, the vast majority of children and adolescents that have
developed a threshold anxiety disorder will be affected by the same condition or other
mental disorders (including other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, or substance use
disorders) over the further course of life. The secondary development of depressive
disorders is a particularly frequent complication across the range of anxiety disorders,
calling for further studies delineating the processes behind this increased depression risk
among individuals with anxiety disorders. The identification of early vulnerability and risk
factors for anxiety disorders is of crucial importance to facilitate research into the
development of targeted prevention or early interventions programs. Although several
variables have been identified as potential risk factors for anxiety disorders, such as parental
psychopathology, behaviorally inhibited temperament, or early life adversity, more work is
needed to identify the most powerful predictors, and to understand their complex biological
and psychological mechanisms and interactions in promoting the onset of anxiety disorders,
and further, the adverse long-term course, to identify those variables that might provide the
best guidance for early intervention. This task is challenging because substantial differences
seem to exist between specific anxiety disorders. Moreover, differences exist for different
developmental phases. Overall, developmental issues have been largely ignored by the
current diagnostic classification systems. The research reviewed in this article suggests
incorporation of a developmental perspective into the next revision of the DSM. Such a
perspective includes the necessity of explicit information on:

•

•

•

•

Differences in symptom presentation across age (children versus adolescents versus
adults): what constitutes a disorder given age and context?

Differences in symptom report as a function of information source (self-report,
parent report, teacher report) and guidance on optimal assessment as a function of
age and disorder type

Differences in course, persistence, and outcome as a function of age, age of onset,
and disorder type

Possibilities of dimensional assessments to differentiate degrees of symptom
expression in terms of duration, severity, and illness stages

Besides this clinical descriptive perspective, other issues are important, for example the
influence of genetic, neurobiologic, or temperamental factors.159 Developmentally more
differentiated information in the DSM would clearly facilitate recognition and diagnosis at
all ages, particularly in children in whom the border between normal and pathological
phenomena may be particularly narrow. Improved diagnosis also improves allocation of
treatment. Many children live with an unrecognized anxiety disorder and are in need of
treatment. Psychological and psychopharmacological treatment options are suitable and
available for youth; however, more research is needed to further test and improve these
interventions.49 Although considerable evidence has been accumulated on the effectiveness
of cognitive-behavior therapy for anxiety disorders among children and adolescents, the data
regarding pharmacological treatments such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among
youth are still scarce. One major concern with psychopharmacological interventions in
children regards the unknown long-term effects of such treatment on neurological

Fig. 1.
Assessing onset of anxiety disorders. The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be directly
assessed by asking “When was the first time you experienced….” The retrospectively
reported ages often reflect the syndrome, rather than disorder onset, and can be subject to
recall bias. This fact is indirectly reflected by observations from longitudinal studies
whereby different ages of onset are reported for the same condition at various assessment
waves. Other sources of information on age of onset are prevalence estimates for disorders
in aggregated age groups (mostly reported in cross-sectional studies). More reliably but also
more rare, incidence reports from longitudinal studies (ie, the proportion of new cases in a
defined time interval) provide insights into the disorder onset.

Fig. 4.
The threshold problem in diagnosing children and adolescent. Diagnostic criteria define
thresholds for diagnoses by specifying type and number of symptoms, the duration and
persistence that the symptoms need to be present, and the clinical significance (A). Due to
the current categorical classification system, being short of just one criterion (eg, only 2
instead of 3 symptoms, only 5 months’ instead of 6 months’ duration, only 3 instead of 4
days a week, all symptom criteria met but no distress or impairment reported) leads to non-
diagnosis (or nonspecific classification as “Anxiety Disorder Not Otherwise Specified” or
“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”). The variation of symptoms
over time and difficulties in retrospective assessment may negatively affect correct
diagnosis. Therefore it is also crucial to take a lifetime approach to diagnosis (B). Mere
cross-sectional assessment may lead to erroneous nondiagnosis based on transient
alleviation of symptoms.

Fig. 5.
Assessing the course of anxiety disorders. Several approaches exist to study the course of
anxiety disorders. Cross-sectional studies most frequently use retrospective age of onset and
age of recency reports to calculate the duration of a condition in years. This approach
assumes a continuous disorder course, and may thus overestimate the duration and
chronicity because symptom-free intervals are not taken into account. Another indirect
measure of disorder chronicity is the proportion of point to lifetime prevalence. The higher
the proportion, the higher the chronicity. Because only categorical diagnoses are considered
here (no symptomatic improvements below the diagnostic threshold), this may lead to
underestimation of chronicity. Overall, cross-sectional studies allow for only crude
estimations of course and chronicity of anxiety disorders. Longitudinal studies, in contrast,
allow for a more realistic description of the course of a disorder. Taking a prospective
approach, the proportion of individuals meeting or not meeting the criteria again at follow-
up is frequently used to describe stability and remission. Considering only the full DSM-IV
diagnostic level, higher remission rates are possible because improvements below the
diagnostic threshold are not taken into account. Thus, the most valid way to describe the
course of anxiety disorders is to consider also subthreshold or subsyndromal conditions.

evidence of the capacity for
age-appropriate social
relationships with familiar
people and the social anxiety
must occur in peer settings, not
just in interactions with adults

B In children, the anxiety may be
expressed by crying, tantrums,
freezing, shrinking from social
situations with unfamiliar
people

C In children, the C criterion
(recognizes that fear is
excessive/unreasonable) may
be absent.

F In individuals < 18 years,

duration is at least 6 months

Fears of being embarrassed in
social situations are common,
but usually the degree of
distress or impairment is
insufficient to warrant a
diagnosis Transient social
anxiety or avoidance is
especially common in
childhood and adolescence (eg,
an adolescent girl may avoid
eating in front of boys for a
short time, then resume usual
behavior). Unlike adults,
children may not have the
option of avoiding feared
situations altogether, and may
be unable to identify the nature
of their anxiety.

B In children, the anxiety may be
expressed by crying, tantrums,
freezing, or clinging

C In children, the C criterion
(recognizes that fear is
excessive/unreasonable) may
be absent

Information on childhood anxieties as

F In individuals < 18 years,

duration is at least 6 months

Fear of animals and other
objects in the natural
environment are particularly
common and are usually
transitory in childhood. A
diagnosis is not warranted
unless the fears lead to
clinically significant
impairment (eg, unwillingness
to got to school for fear of
encountering a dog on the
street)

C In children, 1 instead of 3 out
of 6 symptoms is required

In children and adolescents the
anxieties and worries often
concern the quality of their
performance or competence at
school or in sporting events,
even when their performance is
not being evaluated by others.
There may be excessive
concerns about punctuality.
They may also worry about
catastrophic events such as
earthquakes or nuclear war.
Children may be overly
conforming, perfectionist, and
unsure of themselves and tend
to redo tasks because of
excessive dissatisfaction with
less-than-perfect performance.
They are typically overzealous
in seeking approval and require
excessive reassurance about
their performance and their
worries. The disorder may be
overdiagnosed in children, thus
a thorough evaluation of
presence of other childhood
anxiety disorders should be
done to determine whether the
worries may be better
explained by one of these
disorders.

criterion does not apply
to children

Presentations in children
are generally similar to
those in adulthood.
Washing, checking, and
ordering rituals are
particularly common in
children. Children
generally do not request
help, and the symptoms
may not be ego-dystonic.
More often the problem
is identified by parents.
Gradual declines in
schoolwork secondary to
impaired ability to
concentrate have been
reported. Like adults,
children are more prone
to engage in rituals than
in front of peers,
teachers, or strangers.
For a small subset of
children, the disorder
may be associated with
Group A beta-hemolytic
streptococcal infection.
This form is
characterized by
prepubertal onset,
associated neurological
abnormalities, and an
abrupt onset of
symptoms or an episodic
course in which
exacerbations are
temporally related to the
streptococcal infections.

In children, the criterion
may be expressed by
disorganized or agitated
behavior

In young children,
repetitive play may occur in
which themes or aspects of
the trauma are expressed

In children, there may be
frightening dreams without
recognizable content

In young children, trauma-
specific reenactment may
occur

Because it may be difficult
for children to report
diminished interest in
significant activities and
constrictions of affect,
these symptoms should be
carefully evaluated with
reports from parents,
teachers, and other
observers. In children, the
sense of foreshortened
future may be evidenced by
the belief that life will be
too short to include
becoming an adult. There
may also be “omen
formation,” that is, belief in
an ability to foresee future
untoward events. Children
may also exhibit various
physical symptoms, such as
stomachaches and
headaches.
