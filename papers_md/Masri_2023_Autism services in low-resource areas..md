Objectives: To explore access to intervention services 
for children with autism spectrum disorder )ASD( in 
Jordan.

Methods: We used prospective cross sectional design 
and  survey  methodology  to  collect  information 
from  the  parents  of  a  convenient  sample  of 
children  with  ASD  aged  2.5-17  years  and  who 
attended  pediatric  neurology  clinics  in  3  different 
university  affiliated  hospitals  in  3  geographic  areas 
in  Jordan  from  February  to  December  2018. 

Results: We interviewed parents of 274 children with 
ASD. One hundred ninety-six )71.5%( received 

rehabilitation services. The average age at first session 
was  3.9  years.  The  most  common  services  received 
were  behavioral  therapy  )182;  66.4%(.  The  average 
weekly hours were highest for speech and behavioral 
therapy; 6.25 and 6.64 respectively. Private centers for 
developmental  disabilities  were  the  most  commonly 
used  followed  by  private  centers  for  ASD.  The 
most  common  barriers  were  costs  )138;  58%(  and 
transportation  )88;  37.5%(.  Most  parents  )198; 
72.3%( prefer to receive rehabilitation in a specialized 
center for autism, and most did not want to receive 
training to train their child themselves .

Conclusion: Most children with ASD in Jordan have 
limited access to recommended autism services. The 
development  of  future  interventions  must  consider 
the needs of those living in limited resource regions.

Autism  spectrum  disorder  )ASD(  is  a  lifelong 

characterized 
by  deficits  in  social  communication  and  restricted 
repetitive  behaviors.1  Recent  reports  from  the  United 
States  indicate  that  one  in  44  children  have  autism.2 
Accurate data of the prevalence of autism in Jordan are 
not available. The prevalence figures from other Middle 
Eastern  countries  range  from  1.14  per  100  to  29  per

10,000.3–6 This wide range may have resulted from the 
varying  methodologies  and  inclusion  criteria  used  in 
these studies.7

Healthcare  for  children  with  ASD  is  complex, 
and  requires  an  individualized  approach  and  the  use 
of  specialized  behavioral,  speech,  educational,  and 
medical therapies based on each child’s particular deficit 
profile.8 These interventions are costly, labor-intensive, 
and  require  lengthy  periods  of  provider  training.  The 
National Research Council recommends that children 
with  ASD  receive  “structured,  therapeutic  activities 
for  at  least  25  hours  per  week.”9  A  few  studies  have 
addressed the specifics of meeting this recommendation, 
and more information is needed on the uses of different 
therapies across a broad geographic range.10 

Specialized  interventions  for  children  with  ASD 
is  lacking  worldwide.  A  2020  review  of  barriers  to 
autism therapy access in the United States and Canada 
concluded that most individuals with ASD do not have 
access  to  the  services  needed  to  address  their  various 
needs.11 The review added that the common obstacles 
to access include inadequate screening and diagnostics, 
and unclear referral pathways. This may be due to the 
shortage of specialized providers, such as developmental 
behavioral  pediatricians,  and  child  and  adolescent 
psychiatrists as well as the lack of training and perceived 
competence of general pediatricians in diagnosing and 
managing ASD. 

Global  data  show  significant  disparities  in  the 
resources  available  for  addressing  behavioral  disorders 
in children and adolescents.12 In low-resource settings, 
several  access  barriers  to  these  resources  have  been 
identified.  These  include  an  insufficient  healthcare 
system capacity  and a lack of evidence base for cultural 
and  contextual  factors  affecting  diagnosis  and  help-
seeking  behaviors  pose  significant  challenges  to  the 
development of effective and accessible interventions.13,14

Reports 
)LMICs(  point

Some  studies  have  revealed  limitations  in  availability, 
including  the  lack  of  community-based  and  ASD-
specific interventions.16,17

In Jordan, care for children up to 6 years is provided 
free of charge through the government healthcare system. 

Disclosure. Authors have no conflict of interests, and the 
work was not supported or funded by any drug company.

Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  establishing 
services for people with disabilities. However, the gaps 
between the needs and care received for individuals with 
ASD in Jordan have rarely been studied before, thereby 
making  the  planning,  development,  and  provision  of 
these services challenging. Furthermore, there is neither 
any clear pathway for management and referral, nor any 
clear national guideline or regulation for these services.
This  study  aim  was  to  assess  access  to  quality  of 
intervention services for children with ASD in Jordan, 
types  of  services  available,  and  the  barriers  to  access 
and  unmet  needs  from  a  parental  point  of  view.  This 
information  is  required  to  guide  the  development 
of  programs  for  improving  the  care  and  functional 
outcomes of these children in future. A matched group 
of  children  with  global  developmental  delay  )GDD( 
was used to compare services for other developmental 
and behavioral conditions.

Methods.  We  used  prospective  cross-sectional 
research design and survey methodology to collect data 
from parents of children with ASD who received care at 
3 pediatric neurology clinics in Jordan from February 
to December 2018 )10 months(. The neurology clinics 
covered  3  geographic  regions  in  Jordan  and  served  as 
referral centers for surrounding rural areas in the north, 
central,  and  southern  parts  of  the  country.  In  Jordan 
and  many  other  LMICs,  child  neurologists  provide 
most  diagnostic  and  subsequent  neurodevelopmental 
management for children with ASD.

Parents  of  children  2  years  or  older  who  were 
diagnosed with ASD 6 months or more before to the 
beginning of the study were recruited to participate in 
the study. A control group was selected from children 
with other developmental delays or disability who also 
were diagnosed 6 months or more before the onset of 
the  study.  Children  accompanied  by  caregivers  other 
than their parents were excluded.

Research assistants who were trained in the conduct 
of  research  methods  interviewed  the  accompanying 
parents  at  the  time  of  presentation  to  the  clinic.  The 
survey consisted of 3 parts: The first part of the survey 
collected demographic data including age, educational 
level,  and  average  monthly  income.  In  the  second 
part,  information  was  collected  about  the  services 
the  child  had  received  including  their  age  at  the  first 
session, interval between their age when diagnosed, and 
their age at the first session, number of autism service 
facilities  tried,  whether  the  services  were  provided  by 
the  private  or  governmental  centers  or  at  home,  and 
whether  the  facilities  were  specialized  for  ASD.  The

third  part  explored  the  parental  preferences  regarding 
the location of services and any obstacles encountered 
in accessing them.

The services received were divided into 4 categories: 
physiotherapy,  speech  therapy,  occupational  therapy, 
and behavioral therapy. Each subcategory was assessed 
in terms of age at the first session, average number of 
hours per week, monthly cost, average distance between 
home and provider, and degree of parental satisfaction.
A five-point Likert scale was used to assess parents’ 

satisfaction with each service.

A  pilot  study  on  10  parents  was  conducted  before 
the  beginning  of  the  study  which  resulted  in  minor 
modifications to the survey.

We  conducted  a  Medline  database  search  using 
PubMed  to  identify  related  articles  that  have  been 
incorporated  the 
published  on  this  subject.  We 
information from these sources in the planning of the 
study as well as in the discussion and cited the articles 
in the reference section. 

Data  analysis  and  statistical  methods.  We  used 
Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences  )SPSS(  version 
17  )SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA(  to  analyse  our 
data.  Chi-square  test  was  used  to  test  for  statistically 
significant  differences,  when  applicable.  A  p-value< 
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

ASD -Autism spectrum disorder, GDD - global developmental delay

Ethical  approval.  This  study  was  approved  by  the 
Institutional  Review  Board  of  the  Jordan  University 
Hospital  and  the  University  of  Jordan  and  is  in 
accordance  with  the  ethical  standards  of  the  1964 
Helsinki  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  and  its  later 
amendments. Parents who agreed to participate in this 
research  signed  a  consent  form  indicating  voluntary 
participation  in  the  study  before  the  onset  of  data 
collection. 

Results.  A  total  of  274  parents  of  children  with 
autism were interviewed. Two hundred and fifty-seven 
parents  of  age  matched  children  with  developmental 
delays  and  disabilities  other  than  autism  were  also 
interviewed and served as a control group.

Demographic  characteristics.  As  shown  in  Table  1, 
the  average  age  of  parents  of  children  with  ASD  was 
36 for mothers and 41.25 for fathers. Monthly income 
in most families )197; 72%( ranged from 301 to 500 
JD  )423–700  USD(.  Most  parents  )89%  of  mothers, 
and  84%  of  fathers(  completed  high  school  or  higher 
education (Table 1).

Approximately  half  of  the  families  )132;  48.2%( 
owned a car, but only 41 mothers )15%( had a driving 
license.  Among  the  mothers  included  in  this  study, 
33  )12%(  reported  a  need  to  adjust  or  reduce  their 
working schedule or stop working to accommodate the 
care needs of their child diagnosed with autism, while 
23 fathers )8.4%( had to increase their work schedules 
to  manage  the  additional  expenses  related  to  autism 
services. 

The  age  range  of  the  children  with  autism  ranged 
from 2.5 to 17 years. Most patients )228; 83.2%( were 
aged <3 years. Male-to-female ratio of 2.8:1.

Healthcare services received by children with ASD. 
Of  the  274  children  studied,  196  )71.5  %(  received 
rehabilitation  services.  The  most  common  service  was 
behavioral  therapy  )182;  66.4%(,  whereas  the  least 
common  was  physiotherapy  )18;  6.6%(.  As  shown  in 
Table 2, The mean age at the first session was 3.9 years. 
Average  age  at  the  first  physiotherapy  session  was  3.8 
)range:  0.25  to  9  years(,  while  average  age  at  the  first 
speech  therapy  session  was  4  )range1.25  to  9  years(. 
The average interval between diagnosis and age at the 
first session varied according to the service type. Private 
centers were the most common types of facilities where 
children received services for developmental disabilities, 
followed  by  private  centers  specializing 
in  ASD 
treatment. The mean number of hours spent per week 
on services was the highest for the behavioral and speech 
therapies, at 6.64 and 6.25 hours/week respectively.

Parents often reported attendance at more than one 
facility, ranging from one to 6. A total of 103 )37.7%( 
parents  believed  that  therapy  would  eventually  allow 
their children to attend regular school (Table 2).

The  most  commonly  reported  barrier  to  service 
access  was  cost  )138,  58%(,  followed  by  distance  or 
issues  with  transportation  )88,  37.5%(.  Most  parents 
)198;  72.3%(  preferred  that  their  children  receive 
services at specialized centers for ASD (Table 2).

Approximately  half  of  the  parents  indicated  that 
they were satisfied or very satisfied with the services they 
received (Table 3).

Differences  between  the  ASD  and  GDD  groups.
Children  with  ASD  received  more  behavioral  and 
speech  therapies,  whereas  those  with  GDD  received 
more  physical  and  occupational  therapies.  Parents  of 
children with developmental delays other than autism 
reported higher satisfaction rates than those of children 
with ASD.  More parents in the former group believed 
that  rehabilitation  was  useful.  Although  both  groups 
identified  cost  and  distance  as  hindrance  to  access, 

more  parents  having  children  with  GDD  cited  these 
as obstacles. Parents in both groups preferred that their 
children  receive  therapy  at  specialized  facilities  rather 
than in hospitals, at home, or through Internet modules 
or online courses that would allow them to train their 
children themselves (Table 2).

Discussion.  In  this  study,  we  found  that  there 
were  substantial  barriers  to  access  to  autism  services 
in  Jordan.  While  our  study  showed  improvement  in 
early  detection  compared  to  our  2013  study,18  access 
remained  suboptimal,  with  approximately  a  third 
of  children  never  having  received  the  services  at  the 
time of study. Additionally, for those who received the 
services,  the  available  services  fell  markedly  short  of 
the recommended intensity in terms of the number of 
weekly hours dedicated.19

Large  gaps  in  access  to  autism  services,  especially 
interventions,  have  been  documented 
behavioral 
worldwide, 
in  high-income  countries, 
including 
such  as  the  United  States,  Canada,  and  the  United

Kingdom.20–24  Studies 
from  other  Arab  nations 
similarly  point  to  significant  disparities;  for  example, 
the mean age at first service access is 3.3 years in Saudi 
Arabia25compared to 2.2 years in the United States.26
Our  data  are  consistent  with  the  above  research  
and  indicate  that  services  are  rarely  delivered  by 
autism-specialized  centers.  This  may  explain  parental 
dissatisfaction and the perception that services were not 
helpful. This was why parents tried multiple sources or 
gave  up  when  the  perceived  cost-benefit  ratio  seemed 
unfavorable.  This  may  contribute  to  the  higher  rate 
of complementary and alternative medicine use in the 
families of children with ASD, as we found in a recent 
study of the same population.27

The study reports considerable financial burden on 
such families as the most common challenge, followed by 
transportation-related difficulties. The average monthly 
cost  of  therapy  sessions  is  reported  to  be  between  a 
quarter and a third of the total monthly family income. 
Additionally, the study shows that the caregivers often 
must  stop  working  or  reduce  their  working  hours,28 
thereby  compromising  the  family’s  financial  situation 
further.29  In  our  study,  12%  of  the  mothers  reported 
making changes to their work schedules; however, this 
may  simply  reflect  the  proportion  of  mothers  who 
worked outside the home, which is approximately 22% 
in Jordan.

Most parents preferred their children receive services 
at specialized centers rather than in hospitals, at home, 

or  through  online  training;  few  were  willing  to  be 
trained to deliver the services themselves. This finding 
should  be  considered  when  planning    strategies  for 
improving similar services.

Other studies have reported that parents in LMICs 
tend to have lower expectations and that this could be 
related  to  their  knowledge  and  beliefs  about  ASD  or 
mistrust in the available services.30-33

Finally,  parents  of  children  with  ASD  encounter 
challenges and difficulties similar to those encountered 
by parents of children with other developmental delays, 
necessitating  a  comprehensive  review  of  all  services 
currently provided to the children with developmental 
disorders.

In  anticipation  of  a  greater  demand  for  childhood 
developmental  services,  global  networking  to  help 
develop more user-friendly services must be considered. 
With 
intelligence, 
cooperation with experts in this field could help meet 
these challenges  and improve expected outcomes.

Limitations. This study was conducted at the child 
neurology  clinics  at  3  academic  hospitals.  This  may 
have limited the generalizability of the data. Children 
with  autism  who  live  in  rural  areas  outside  of  urban 
centers may have a more restricted access to diagnostic 
and treatment services, as has been documented in the 
studies from the United States and other countries.11

While we focused on the services for children with 
ASD, adolescents and adults with this disorder may face

greater obstacles to service access. Future studies should 
explore services for older individuals. 

Conclusion. Children with ASD in Jordan, an LMIC 
in  the  Middle  East,  experience  significant  challenges 
to  access  quality  autism  services,  similar  to  what  has 
been reported in high-income countries. Over the past 
2  to  3  decades,  the  prevalence  of  ASD  has  increased 
exponentially  worldwide;  however,  most  research  on 
the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  this  condition  come 
from  the  developed  countries  with  advanced  medical 
systems  and different patient demographics than their 
developing counterparts. Therefore, research on LMICs 
is critical to optimize the care of ASD patients in these 
countries.

This  study  examines  a  large  representative  sample 
from  across  Jordan  and  provide  valuable  information 
on the availability and types of autism services in low-
resource settings. 

In  the  absence  of  comprehensive  epidemiological 
data on ASD in LMICs, parents’ perceptions of gaps in 
access to services for and of their children’s unmet needs 
may  provide  the  only  available  information  necessary 
for planning future research and service programs.
