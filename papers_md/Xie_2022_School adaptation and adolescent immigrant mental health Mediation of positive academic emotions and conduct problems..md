Introduction: Immigrant adolescents must adapt their physical and mental
attitudes to attain healthy development due to dramatic changes in their living
and learning environments after relocation. From the perspective of positive
psychology, this study explored the speciﬁc inﬂuence of school adaptation
on mental health among immigrant adolescents, mainly focusing on the
mediating effects of positive academic emotions and conduct problems.

Methods: We selected primary and secondary school students from ﬁve
relocated resettlement schools in Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous
Prefecture, which has the largest population of relocated people in Guizhou
Province, China. Using cluster sampling, 550 relocated students in Grades
5–12 from the ﬁve schools were recruited to complete a battery of
questionnaires, including the Immigrant Adolescents’ School Adaptation Scale,
the General Health Scale, and the Positive Academic Emotions Questionnaire,
and the Adolescents’ Behavioral Tendency Questionnaire. In addition, this
study used the bias-corrected bootstrap method to explore the chain-
mediating effect of positive academic emotions and conduct problems
between school adaptation and mental health.

Results: The results showed that immigrant adolescents had signiﬁcant gender
differences only in conduct problems. However, signiﬁcant learning stage
differences existed in school adaptation, mental health, positive academic
emotions, and conduct problems. School adaptation, positive academic
emotions, and mental health were signiﬁcantly positively correlated.
In
contrast, conduct problems were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with
mental health. School adaptation inﬂuenced mental health through the
mediation effects of positive academic emotions and conduct problems.
These effects contained three paths: the separate mediation effects of positive
academic emotions and conduct problems and the chain mediation effect of
positive academic emotions and conduct problems.

Introduction

The term relocated migrants refers to individuals who move
from remote places in mountainous areas to live in cities and
towns. Migrants who have relocated have left their place of origin
to live, study, and work in a new environment. They experience
considerable changes in the environment after relocation. This
change inevitably has an impact on their physical and mental
health. Therefore, adapting to the new living and educational
environments after the relocation and developing in the process
of adaptation are practical issues that must be addressed. Due to
diﬀerent cultural inﬂuences, they do not adapt their behaviors
and living habits immediately. Relocated young people need
greater care and support in terms of academic psychology
and emotional adjustment. In this study, the term immigrant
adolescents referred to individuals aged 10–18 who have moved
from regions with poor living conditions to places more suitable
for survival and development (1). Academic maladjustment in
the new environment may lead to negative reactions such as
rebelliousness and dislike of school in young people who are
relocated. Other possible adverse reactions include rebellion and
academic weariness.

Empowerment theory proposes that unmet personal needs
and the emergence of problems stem from the experience
of exclusion and oppression of the environment. Therefore,
it is necessary to enhance the ability to combat pressure
from the surrounding environment and its adverse eﬀects

adolescents’ development and plays a proximal and long-lasting
role in adolescents’ mental health (5). Relocated adolescents are
school-aged and can be empowered through favorable school
resources and eﬀective human interaction. Current research
notes that the standards for school adaptation are not uniform.
Existing research about circumstances pertaining to relocation
has determined four aspects of relocated adolescents’ school
adaptation:
learning, teacher-student relationship, classmate
relationship, and environment. Learning adaptation refers to
young people’s adaptability in terms of learning attitudes and
learning emotions in the face of a new school environment
after relocation. Teacher-student relationship adaptation refers
to how relocated students get along with teachers in a new school
environment. Classmate-relational adaptation refers to peer
friendships with new classmates in a new school environment.
Home-learning environment adaptation refers to having an

can be used as elements of empowerment
for immigrant
adolescents to support adjustment to a new environment,
gradually increasing psychological well-being and maintaining
good long-term mental health.

Mental health has been described at diﬀerent perspectives.
From an adaptive perspective, it mainly includes an individual’s
anxiety, depression, social dysfunction, and loss of conﬁdence
(6). Studies have found that eﬀective life adaptation is the
foundation of maintaining mental health (7). In addition, it is
an essential criterion for measuring mental health. Therefore,
adaptability is a constituent element of mental health, and it
can be measured to estimate the mental health of individuals
or groups (7). A study of refugees found that the weakening
of social adaptation increased internalizing behavioral problems
(8). The degree of
internalization of problems indicates
mental health levels, and mental health outcomes of children
of diﬀerent ethnic cultures are inﬂuenced by acculturation.
This process is promoted by the interaction of individuals
with diﬀerent educational
levels. Cross-ethnic research has
investigated cultural adaptation as an avenue to predict mental
health adjustment. (9). A longitudinal study by Ratelle et al.
(10) found that cognitive adaptation enhances mental health.
Their study also provided indirect evidence that adaptation
aﬀects mental health. Some scholars have explored the mental
health problems, such as depression and anxiety, of ethnic
minorities. They found that overall ethnic minority mental
health levels were lower than those of the mainstream majority
population. In addition, their mental health problems were more
pronounced (11, 12). Researchers have identiﬁed a relationship
model connecting adaptation to mental health based on existing
ﬁndings (13, 14). One ﬁnding is that, for immigrant children,
maladaptation can easily lead to psychological problems due to
changes in their living and learning environments.

Academic emotions refer to the various emotions that
students experience after learning of academic success or failure,
in classroom learning, in the process of daily homework, and
during exams (15). Academic emotions can be either positive
or negative. Studies have shown that
improving students’
learning adaptability promotes positive emotional experiences
for students, and a signiﬁcant positive correlation exists between
learning adaptability and positive academic emotions (16, 17).
These positive emotions play a supportive role during crises
(18). Having been uprooted, for immigrant adolescents, the
experience of positive emotions is indeed a protective factor
shaping their mental health. Research has revealed that academic
emotions aﬀect students’ physical and mental health (19). In
addition, studies measuring emotional intelligence have found
that academic emotions may aﬀect students’ mental health (20).
Other studies have pointed out that anxiety aﬀects academic
stress (21). This stress is an indicator of mental health, so
academic emotions can signiﬁcantly predict mental health
directly and indirectly (22–24). This study proposed a research

hypothesis, positive academic emotions may play a mediating
role between school adaptation and mental health.

Families and adolescents have similar emotional and
behavioral problems (25). Emotional and behavioral problems
may increase as adolescents mature (26, 27). Speciﬁc studies
have shown that conduct problems are related to executive
function impairment (28). In addition, low self-esteem predicts
serious behavioral problems, and more conduct problems
indicate diminished mental health (29). However, eﬀective
parenting is an important protective factor against children’s
behavioral problems (30). At the same time, emotional and
behavioral problems accompany heavy psychological burdens
and lower levels of mental health in adolescents (31). Conduct
problems also may indicate the presence of anxiety and
depression (32). It had also been shown that boys have
a higher detection rate of behavior problems than girls
(33), while the relative involvement of boys in behavior
problems was higher than that of girls (34), and that gender
could inﬂuence adolescent behavior problems (35). Under the
adaptation mental health model, maladaptation may lead to
conduct problem behaviors. That is, adolescents’ adaptation
leads to adaptation diﬀerentiation in the behavioral domain
(36, 37). So, conduct problem behavior is the manifestation
of adaptation diﬀerentiation, which ultimately aﬀects mental
health. Therefore, conduct problem behavior may play a
mediating role between adaptation and mental health. This
study presented a research hypothesis, conduct and behavior
problems may play a mediating role between school adaptation
and mental health.

The role of emotion in child conduct problems had been
subject to growing attention in recent years (38). The emotion
dysregulation was found to be a stronger predictor for the
conduct problems (39). There were studies reported a negative
correlation between emotion regulation and externalizing
behavior problems and concluded that better emotion regulation
was associated with less externalizing behaviors (40). Under the
adaptive-health model, it was necessary to explore the chain-
mediated mediation of academic emotion and conduct and
behavior problems. Therefore, the research hypothesis was put
forward, the mediating eﬀect of academic emotions and conduct
and behavior problems in school adaptation and mental health.

Methods

Participants

Guizhou Province is the province of China with the largest
one of relocation scale and the largest overall population.
Moreover, Guizhou is a multi-ethnic province. Most of the
relocated population originally resided in autonomous ethnic
minority autonomous areas. This study used random sampling
to select primary and secondary students from ﬁve resettlement
schools in Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture,
which has
the largest poverty alleviation and relocation
population in Guizhou Province. The participants were students
ranging in age from the ﬁfth grade of primary school to the
third year of high school. A total of 600 questionnaires were
distributed, 600 questionnaires were returned, and the recovery
rate was 100%. Among them, 550 were valid questionnaires.
Therefore, the eﬀective rate of return was 91.7%. In this study,
all subjects participated completely voluntarily. The responses
of subjects were anonymous.

Among the participants, the ethnic representations were as
follows: 134 Buyi, 146 Miao, 2 Bai, 1 Hui, 28 Yi, 189 Han, and
50 individuals from other minorities. Two hundred thirty-one
were male, and 319 were female. The sample included 62 ﬁfth,
74 sixth, 90 seventh graders, and 95 eighth, and 86 ninth-grade
students. Forty-seven students were in the ﬁrst, 49 students were
in the second, and 47 students were in the third year of high
school. The age range of all subjects was 13.88 ± 2.16.

Measures

School adaptation scale for immigrant
adolescents

We used a 15-item scale that is based on the psychological
characteristics of immigrant adolescents. It uses a 5-point Likert
scale for scoring. In the exploratory factor analysis of all items,
the total variance explained rate was 66.771%, the KMO value
was 0.881, and the spherical test was signiﬁcant. Four factors
were obtained and designated as follows: academic adaptation
(including learning attitude, learning method, and others), four
factors items; teacher-student relationship adaptation (including
teachers’ attitudes and behaviors toward students and students’
four items; peer
attitudes and behaviors toward teachers),
relationship adaptation (including social skills and loneliness,
and others), four items; and new adaptation to family learning
environment (including the family learning environment after
relocation, parents’ attitude toward learning and others), three
items. The factor loading size ranged from 0.569 to 0.825.
Conﬁrmatory factor analysis was carried out on the ﬁnal four-
factor structure of the 15 items yielding χ2/df = 1.928, NFI =
0.887, IFI = 0.942, TLI = 0.926, CFI = 0.941, RMSEA = 0.058.
These results indicated that the model ﬁt well. The internal
consistency alpha coeﬃcient of the scale was 0.867, showing that
the school adaptation scale for immigrant adolescents had high
validity and reliability.

General health inventory (GHQ)

The scale was compiled by Mäkikangas et al. (6) and revised
by Zhang (46). It consists of 12 items, half of which are negative
and half of which are positive. The scale is one-dimensional,
using 4-point scoring. The higher the score attained, the more
robust the individual’s mental health. The internal consistency
alpha coeﬃcient of this scale for this study was 0.823.

Positive academic emotions questionnaire

The 30-item positive academic emotions subscale of the
Adolescent Academic Emotions Scale was compiled by Yan and
Guoliang (15). This subscale is divided into two dimensions:
positive-high and positive-low arousal academic emotion. The
subscale uses a 5-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating

a more positive academic attitude. Its internal consistency alpha
coeﬃcient for this study was 0.927.

Behavioral tendency questionnaire for
adolescent conduct problems

The questionnaire was compiled by Zhang et al. (47) and
has a total of 14 items. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert
scale. The questionnaire includes three dimensions: violation
tendencies (six items), addiction tendencies (four items), and
aggressive tendencies (four items). The higher the score, the
stronger the tendency to manifest behavior problems. The
internal consistency alpha coeﬃcient of this scale for this study
was 0.820.

Analyses

All data were managed and statistically analyzed by SPSS
and Amos (Versions 23.0). First, SPSS 23.0 was used to
calculate the study variable descriptive statistics and their
correlations. Next, we tested the mediating eﬀect of positive
academic emotions and conduct problems using PROCESS
(Model 6 justiﬁed by 5,000 bootstraps). Finally, we used
structural equation modeling (Amos 23.0) to investigate the
ﬁtness of
the chain-mediating eﬀect of positive academic
attitude and conduct problems between school adaptation
and mental health. The requirement of structural equation
model for ﬁtting exponent was χ2/df < 5, NFI > 0.8, IFI
> 0.8, TLI > 0.8, CFI > 0.8, RMSEA <0.08. Additionally,
we used the percentile bootstrap method for mediation
eﬀect analysis.

the chain mediation model was relatively high. Therefore, school

the relocated adolescent school adaptation scale are ideal. The
internal consistency coeﬃcient of the four dimensions of the
relocated adolescent school adaptation scale was above 0.569,
and the conﬁrmatory factor analysis showed that the ﬁtting
index indicators of the relocated adolescent school adaptation
scale were good. Speciﬁcally,
the scale had a total of 15
items, including four items for academic adaptation, four items
for teacher-student relationship adaptation, 4 items for peer
relationship adaptation, and three items for new adaptation
to family learning environment. However, test-retest reliability
analysis and criterion analysis were not carried out in this study,
and it was necessary to further explore the structure, reliability
and validity of the scale in other groups.

The relationship between school
adaptation and mental health

This study found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between
school adaptation and mental health. Social-ecological system
theory emphasizes that the developing individual is constantly
growing and interacting with the surrounding environment. The
impact of the environment on the development of children is
multi-dimensional and varies (53, 54). After relocation, school
and community culture aﬀected the youth’s growth. In addition,
social policies aﬀect the mental health of immigrant adolescents.
This study found that school adaptation directly predicted
mental health. This ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies
(55), so we concluded that school adaptation is an essential
factor aﬀecting mental health.

on mental health took three paths: the single mediating eﬀect
of positive academic emotions, the single mediating eﬀect of
conduct problems, and the chain mediating eﬀect of positive
academic emotions-conduct problems.

Discussion

This study found that male immigrant adolescents had
signiﬁcantly worse conduct problems than females, consistent
with previous studies (49–52). The three problematic behavior
tendencies of violation, addiction, and aggression are all external
manifestations. In educational practice, males typically exhibit
more conduct problems than females do. When adapting to a
familiar environment, people often see that females are better-
behaved, males are naughtier, and tend to annoy others more
frequently. It is normal for young male immigrant adolescents to
increase their nuisance behaviors and unexpected violations in
an unfamiliar environment to which they have not yet adapted.

social-emotional development, and research has indicated that
the adverse eﬀect of relative poverty is bigger when children
are older (57). The results of the current study show that
mental health is aﬀected by school adaptation, positive academic
emotions, and conduct problem behaviors in relative poverty.

First, this study found that positive academic emotions
played a mediating role between school adaptation and mental
health. This result suggests that good school adjustment in
adolescents has a positive impact on their mental health.
The PPCT model (“Person-Process-Environment-Time” model)
emphasizes that the systemic factors inﬂuencing individual
development interact to form a network of forces. These forces
blend to inﬂuence the individual’s psychological development
(53). Positive academic emotions in this study were a process
factor inﬂuenced by school adaptation. The PPCT model
proposes that positive emotions beneﬁt individual development.
Our results conﬁrm the impact of positive academic emotions on
mental health. Furthermore, they clarify the impact mechanism
of school adaptation on mental health.

Second, this study found that conduct problems played
a mediating role between school adjustment and mental
that adolescents with strong school
health. This
adaptation were more

relational, academic, and learning environments, were less
likely to have conduct problems and were more likely
to have better overall mental health. Conduct problems
are not conducive to students’ mental health. They are
important indicators of bad behavior in students’ development
process (58). School adaptation may enhance mental health
through the promotion of better behavior. Therefore, school
adaptation can aﬀect mental health indirectly by ﬁrst reducing
conduct problems.

Finally, this study found a chain-mediated mediating eﬀect
of positive academic emotions and conduct problems in school
adaptation and mental health. On the one hand, positive
academic emotions negatively predicted conduct problems. This
study deﬁned positive academic emotions as based on successful

academic experiences. These experiences partly reﬂect good
behavioral habits, which in turn improve conduct. Positive
academic emotions
facilitate a constructive psychological
response mode. This response then inﬂuences the individual’s
ability to think about
the environment, prompting young
people to have a positive understanding of their character and
enhancing mental health. Adolescents with adequate school
adaptation develop positive academic attitudes. This disposition
directly aﬀects the individual’s perception of adaptation and
promotes high-quality behaviors. On the other hand, mental
health is also a process in which adolescents interact with
their own individual, various processes, and situational systems.
Therefore, our research results showing that positive academic
emotions and conduct problems had a chain-mediating eﬀect
on school adaptation and mental health further reveal the
developmental mechanism of the psychological well-being of
adolescent immigrants.

Implications

It

immigrant

is necessary to strengthen inclusive mental health
education for
adolescents. When immigrant
adolescents are enrolled in schools, special psychological ﬁles
should be established for them. They should also be encouraged
to deepen their understanding of academics, emotions,
interpersonal relationships, and other areas through mental
health education courses. This curriculum should help them to
look at their learning constructively and form good study habits.
At the same time, parents and teachers should provide praise
and encouragement to promote the growth of their children.
Sincere care and equal and friendly communication can help
them reduce any sense of inferiority and alienation, and facilitate
the establishment of their self-esteem and self-conﬁdence, better
integrating them into the collective and society.

Data availability statement

The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will

be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.

Giving relocated youth ﬁsh is not as eﬀective as teaching
them how to ﬁsh. Home-school co-governance, targeting the
speciﬁc concerns of the school and the community, can be
managed by recruiting volunteers and allowing parents and
children to act as volunteers. These strategies will help to realize
a virtuous circle of self-management and development and
feelings of camaraderie and mutual assistance in many activities.

Ethics statement

The studies involving human participants were reviewed and
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the School of
Education Science, Xingyi Normal University for Nationalities.
Written informed consent to participate in this study was
