Abstract: Lithium has been used for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) for the last sixty or more
years, and recent studies with more reliable designs and updated guidelines have recommended
lithium to be the treatment of choice for acute manic, mixed and depressive episodes of BD, along with
long-term prophylaxis. Lithium’s speciﬁc mechanism of action in mood regulation is progressively
being clariﬁed, such as the direct inhibition on glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and its various effects on
neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, oxidative metabolism, apoptosis, second messenger systems,
and biological systems are also being revealed. Furthermore, lithium has been proposed to exert its
treatment effects through mechanisms associated with neuronal plasticity. In this review, we have
overviewed the clinical aspects of lithium use for BD, and have focused on the neuroprotective and
neurotrophic effects of lithium.

1. Introduction

Certainly an oldie, lithium was ﬁrst pharmacologically used in the nineteenth century, known
to have a prophylactic effect on recurrent depression [1]. After the anti-manic effects of lithium were
discovered, lithium has been used for the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD), in both the acute and
maintenance phases of depression and mania for the last sixty or more years [2]. In the process,
prescribing rates of lithium had declined at one point [3] due to the growing doubt on lithium’s
evidence-based efﬁcacy as earlier studies on lithium did not meet the more recent research standards [4],
along with concerns on the possible fatal toxicity and difﬁculty of use [5]. Furthermore, the changes in
BD diagnostic criteria throughout the years [6], and the appearance of newer agents such as valproate
and atypical antipsychotics, may also have inﬂuenced the use of lithium [7]. However recent studies
with designs considered to be more reliable, such as double-blind randomized controlled trials and
meta-analyses, and based on contemporary diagnostic criteria such as Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) and International Statistical Classiﬁcation of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), have reported lithium to be once again
effective in the treatment of BD [8]. Lithium is now considered the treatment of choice for long-term
prophylaxis of new episodes [9], regarded as the only substance that prevents both new depressive
and new manic episodes [2]. Also, lithium is the only drug with an established anti-suicidal efﬁcacy in
BD [10]. Despite such robust treatment effects of lithium, lithium’s speciﬁc mechanism of action in
mood regulation is still yet to be clariﬁed. Along with the direct inhibition on glycogen synthase kinase
3β (GSK3β), lithium’s various effects on neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, oxidative metabolism,
apoptosis, neuronal structures and glia, second messenger systems, and biological systems such as the
circadian rhythm and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, have all been suggested to underlie
lithium’s therapeutic effects [11]. Although the pathophysiology of BD has not been completely

elucidated, a large body of literature indicates BD to be associated with signiﬁcant neuroanatomical
alterations [12]. Such results of studies implicate, a compromised integrity of frontal–subcortical
and prefrontal–limbic brain regions, in the pathophysiology of BD [13]. Further evidence suggests
changes in the cellular level, including dysregulation of glial–neuronal interactions, to underlie such
neuroanatomical alterations [14]. Therefore, lithium has been proposed to exert its treatment effects
through mechanisms associated with neuronal plasticity [15]. In this review, we will overview the
clinical aspects of lithium use for BD, and focus on the neuroprotective and neurotrophic mechanisms
of action of lithium. Furthermore, we have mainly included literature emphasizing modern research
designs, and have concentrated on the efﬁcacy of lithium as monotherapy rather than in combination
with other agents.

Methods

We performed an extensive review of the major publications on the clinical aspects of lithium
use, lithium’s treatment effects in BD, lithium’s therapeutic mechanism of action, and neuroimaging
studies associated with lithium treatment in BD. A comprehensive literature search of peer-reviewed
publications was conducted using PubMed, and relevant articles were identiﬁed using the following
keywords: “lithium” and “bipolar disorder” and “clinical use’, “lithium” and “bipolar disorder” and
“treatment effects’, “lithium” and “therapeutic mechanism’, and “lithium” and “bipolar disorder”
and “neuroimaging” and “brain structure’. Relevant ﬁndings were then identiﬁed and synthesized
in combination with earlier and extant literature, and referenced articles were further examined to
additionally acquire relevant publications. Language was restricted to English, but no time restriction
was applied.

2. Guidelines to Initiating and Maintaining Lithium

It is well known that before initiating lithium treatment, a number of essential factors should
be considered. First, as lithium is excreted by the kidneys, renal functions must be checked, as
decreased kidney functions will lead to excess accumulation of lithium and ultimately toxicity [16].
Renal function test should then be maintained every 6 months during treatment, especially the
levels of urea and creatinine [17]. Second, thyroid function tests should be administered as lithium
has inﬂuence on thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, and triiodothyronine [18]. As a result,
the prevalence of both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism has been shown to be increased, with
circulating thyroid auto-antibodies frequently being found, and thyrotoxicosis also developing [19].
The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism has been reported to vary from 8% to 19% [20], with the
main risk factor being female [21]. Thyroid function tests are recommended to be administered at
6 months, and then annually [17]. Third, serum calcium levels should be checked as lithium is known
to cause hyperparathyroidism. The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism is estimated to be 7.5% higher
than the general population, and has been reported in patients treated with lithium for 15 or more
years [22]. Serum calcium level tests should be conducted at 6 months and then repeated annually [17].
Fourth, lithium treatment is often associated with weight gain, with signiﬁcant weight gain being
observed in patients receiving long term treatment [23]. Also, greater weight gain was observed in
patients who were already overweight [24]. Weight, along with waist circumference and body mass
index should be checked at 6 months and then annually [17]. Furthermore, electrocardiograms may
also be recommended as long-term lithium treatment has been associated with corrected QT (QTc)
interval prolongation [25]. Recommended medical examinations for safety monitoring with lithium
treatment are listed in Table 1.

In addition to the side effects mentioned above which can occur even when within therapeutic
lithium levels, such as reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism,
and weight gain [26], typical signs and symptoms of lithium intoxication should also be carefully
monitored. Lithium plasma levels greater than 1.2 mmol/L are potentially toxic, and in acute
intoxication, plasma levels that exceed 2.0 mmol/L can be fatal [27]. Lithium intoxication is

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

mainly presented as central nervous system, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular symptoms.
Central nervous system symptoms include a state of confusion, cerebellar signs such as tremor,
dysarthria, ataxia, and nystagmus, extrapyramidal and neuromuscular signs such as fasciculations,
ﬁbrillations, and myoclonia, and polyneuropathy. Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting
and diarrhea, and renal symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Cardiovascular signs include arrhythmia, low blood pressure and rarely shock. Adult respiratory
distress syndrome or thermoregulation disturbances may also occur [19]. Signs and symptoms of
lithium intoxication are summarized in Table 2.

Although the half-life of lithium in the brain is approximately 24 h, the half-life in plasma is
8 h [28]. A single daily dose of lithium may also be an acceptable option [29,30], but a majority of
therapeutic guidelines recommend divided daily doses of lithium, in order to maintain a steady plasma
level [31,32]. Two or more daily doses may be applied initially to achieve a standardized 12-h serum
lithium level [33], followed by a full daily dose which will aid to enhance compliance and decrease
the chance of increased urinary volume [34]. A therapeutic lithium plasma level for BD has been
recommended as 0.5–1.2 mmol/L [31], and when initiating treatment, lithium levels should be checked
at a steady state, which is at least ﬁve days after taking a certain dose, until two consecutive levels
within the therapeutic range are established for the same dosage [17]. Lithium has a relatively narrow
therapeutic index, and individual differences should be accounted for when initiating treatment
as lithium toxicity may occur if levels surpass 1.2 mmol/L. Therefore, lower plasma therapeutic
levels at initiation of treatment, such as 0.6–0.8 mmol/L have also been recommended, which can
be increased to 0.8–1.0 mmol/L when recurrence occurs [35]. As maintenance therapy, a therapeutic
level of 0.4–0.6 mmol/L [31] and up to 0.6–0.8 mmol/L [32] have been recommended. However, it
is suggested that plasma level titration is needed according to polarity and symptomatic proﬁle [36],
and different prophylactic levels have been recommended for depression-prone BD patients and
mania-prone patients, with the levels being 0.4–0.8 mmol/L and 0.6–1.0 mmol/L respectively [37].

Of note, two forms of acquired nonresponse to lithium that develop over the treatment course
in patients who have previously shown adequate response have been reported. The ﬁrst type of
nonresponse is discontinuation-induced refractoriness, is when patients who have showed good
long-term response to lithium then discontinue treatment, and after experiencing a major recurrence,
do not respond to lithium at previously effective doses [38]. The second type of nonresponse is the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

development of a pharmacodynamic tolerance to lithium, described as mild, brief, or infrequent
symptoms starting to occur then progressively increasing in severity, duration, or frequency, until the
original pattern of illness prior to treatment recurs, even while maintaining lithium treatment [39].
Physicians should be aware of the possibility of occurrence of the two phenomena while maintaining
treatment in patients with BD, and apply appropriate management of the conditions when necessary.

3. Lithium in the Treatment and Prophylaxis of Bipolar Disorder (BD)

Lithium has been reported by recent literature to be effective in treating manic and mixed
episodes compared to placebo, including numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [40–42] and
meta-analyses [43–45]. When compared to other mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics, lithium
was shown to have similar treatment efﬁcacies in acute manic and mixed episodes as valproate [46,47],
olanzapine [48], risperidone and haloperidol [49]. On the other hand, manic or mixed patients taking
lithium were shown to have less response but no signiﬁcantly different remission rates compared to
patients taking olanzapine [50]. Also, manic but not mixed or rapid cycling patients taking lithium
were reported to show less response and a lower remission rate compared to those who were on
quetiapine [51]. Lithium was also suggested to be more effective in manic patients compared to
valproate [52] and olanzapine [53]. One RCT reported an equal efﬁcacy of verapamil compared with
lithium in the treatment of mania [54]. Studies of adequate quality comparing the efﬁcacy of lithium
with other anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers such as oxcarbazepine, lurasidone, gabapentin and
tiagabine, have not yet been conducted [8]. Furthermore, no RCTs have yet investigated the treatment
effects of lithium in purely mixed or hypomanic patients, with a systematic review suggesting lithium
monotherapy to lack signiﬁcant prophylactic beneﬁts in mixed episodes [55]. Concerning onset of
action, lithium has been reported to have a slower onset of action compared to antipsychotics such as
haloperidol, olanzapine and risperidone, with lithium being 6~10 days [56] and antipsychotics being
2~6 days [57].

Although only a few RCTs have been conducted on the treatment effects of lithium in bipolar
depression, several treatment guidelines recommend lithium as a ﬁrst-line treatment agent for bipolar
I disorder (BD-I) depression [58]. Possibly considered a disadvantage, lithium has been shown to
have less efﬁcacy in treating bipolar depression compared to quetiapine and antidepressants such
as venlafaxine by previous studies. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of quetiapine and
lithium monotherapy in the acute phase of BD-I or bipolar II disorder (BD-II) major depression
reported quetiapine, but not lithium, to have signiﬁcant treatment efﬁcacy compared to placebo [59].
A subsequent open-label, randomized study on the treatment effects of quetiapine or lithium
monotherapy in patients with BD-I or II major depression reported both agents to reduce depressive
symptoms, but the remission rate to be higher with quetiapine [60]. A randomized, parallel group,
open-label trial on venlafaxine and lithium monotherapy in rapid and non-rapid cycling patients with
BD-II depression reported venlafaxine to have superior efﬁcacy compared to lithium independent of
cycling status, and to not result in a higher proportion of mood conversions [61]. On the other hand,
lithium has shown equal efﬁcacy compared to other medications such as lamotrigine, as a single blind
study of lithium and lamotrigine treatment for BD-II depression reported both agents to be effective
with similar response and remission rates [62]. Furthermore, considered as advantages of lithium
therapy, a protective effect against switching to mania when treating bipolar depression [63], and
a reduction in the risk of suicidal behavior which is often accompanied in bipolar depression [64],
have been suggested with lithium treatment. However, the antidepressant effect of lithium has been
reported to have a delayed onset of 6–8 weeks. Therefore, in clinical practice, a combination of lithium
with other agents which are considered to be effective in the treatment of bipolar depression, is more
likely to be administered, and despite the insufﬁcient evidence, lithium remains important in the
treatment of bipolar depression [65].

Lithium has been shown to be effective in the prophylaxis of both mania and bipolar
depression [66], hence the majority of treatment guidelines recommend lithium as a ﬁrst-line agent for

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

maintenance therapy. A RCT including patients with BD-I and a current or recent manic, depressive,
or mixed episode reported lithium to signiﬁcantly increase time to recurrence of both manic events
and depressive events compared with placebo [67]. A randomized open-label trial including patients
with BD-I and were not having an acute episode but were indicated for long-term therapy, reported
lithium monotherapy to be more likely to prevent relapse than valproate monotherapy [66]. Based on
previous evidence, lithium has been suggested to provide better prophylactic efﬁcacy against manic
episodes compared to depressive episodes [8].

As BD is often presented with psychotic features especially during manic episodes, the
efﬁcacy of
lithium treatment on bipolar psychosis has previously been investigated [68].
However, only a few studies have systematically evaluated lithium’s treatment effects on mania
with psychosis. Studies comparing lithium with ﬁrst and second-generation neuroleptics in mania
with psychosis reported chlorpromazine to be superior than lithium in treating psychotic features [69],
and aripiprazole but not lithium, to be more effective than placebo in treating psychotic symptoms [40].
On the other hand, lithium was shown to have similar efﬁcacy as quetiapine, and to be superior to
placebo in the treatment of psychosis in manic episodes [41]. Furthermore, lithium monotherapy
was shown to be signiﬁcantly better than placebo in improving mania in a psychotic subtype [70], to
produce early improvement of psychotic symptoms, and to have similar efﬁcacy in both psychosis and
non-psychosis mania [71]. Future research on lithium’s anti-psychotic properties in the treatment of
BD should be conducted.

The anti-suicidal effects of lithium in BD have previously been reported by numerous RCTs and
meta-analyses. A meta-analysis published in 2006 which included 31 studies and 33,340 subjects,
reported risks of completed and attempted suicide to be lower during lithium treatment in patients
with BD and major depression [72]. In a meta-analysis published in 2009, which included 6 studies
that directly compared patients with BD who were treated with either lithium or anticonvulsants
(carbamazepine, divalproex, lamotrigine), reported suicidal acts to be signiﬁcantly lower during
treatment with lithium [73]. A meta-analysis published in 2013 which included 48 RCTs, also reported
lithium to be more effective than placebo in reducing the number of suicides in patients with mood
disorders, although no clear beneﬁts were observed for lithium in preventing deliberate self-harm [64].
Not only considered a consequence of lithium’s mood stabilizing effects, the anti-suicidal effects of
lithium have also been associated with the reduction of impulsivity and aggressiveness, both of which
are associated with an increased risk of suicide [74], and are often present in bipolar depression or
mixed states [75]. Furthermore, lithium’s numerous mechanisms of action, including the inhibition of
GSK3β, have been suggested to contribute to lithium’s anti-suicidal properties [76]. The therapeutic
mechanisms of lithium are discussed in detail in the below section.

4. Therapeutic Mechanisms of Lithium

Although the speciﬁc therapeutic mechanisms of lithium in mood regulation has not been clariﬁed,
lithium is recently being suggested to exert its mood stabilizing effects by acting on cellular targets
and exerting neuroprotective effects [77]. The GSK-3 signaling pathway modulates apoptosis and
synaptic plasticity, with increased activity supporting apoptosis, and attenuated activity enhancing
neuroplasticity and cellular resilience [78]. Manipulation of the GSK-3 pathway has been shown
to produce both antimanic and antidepressant effects [79], and genes regulating GSK-3 have been
implicated in BD etiology [80,81]. Lithium is considered to inﬂuence numerous neuroprotective
pathways through increasing phosphorylated GSK3β and inhibiting its action, ameliorating the effects
of excitotoxicity [82]. Previous studies have reported treatment response to lithium to be predicted by
GSK3β gene expression and phosphorylation [83,84], and lithium induced increases in phosphorylated
GSK3β to be correlated with symptom improvement [82]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
is well known for its involvement in neuronal maturation, differentiation and survival, synaptic
plasticity, and long-term memory consolidation, and is highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and
hippocampus [85]. Numerous studies have reported decreased BDNF levels in patients with bipolar

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

6 of 17

depression and mania, along with low levels of BDNF to be correlated with severity of depression and
mania symptoms [86,87]. BDNF gene polymorphisms have also been associated with the risk for BD,
early onset of the disease, suicidality, propensity toward rapid cycling, and treatment response [88,89].
Lithium has been suggested to prevent cellular degeneration through BDNF upregulation, with chronic
lithium treatment shown to increase BDNF [90].

Mitochondrial function is known to be essential for regulating neuroplasticity, apoptosis, and
intracellular calcium levels. Changes in endocellular calcium have an essential role in modulating
intracellular signaling cascades and neurotransmitter release [91]. Defective mitochondrial function has
been associated with abnormal oxidative metabolism and damage to desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA),
which contributes to neuronal apoptosis [92,93]. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated
in BD, with hippocampal expression of genes related to mitochondrial proteins being reduced in
patients with BD [93]. Furthermore, accelerated telomere shortening observed in BD, has been
suggested to be greatly inﬂuenced by stress-related oxidative damage [94]. Lithium has been shown
to have anti-oxidative effects through various mechanisms such as increasing the antioxidants [95],
reducing the expression of stress proteins [96], reducing proinﬂammatory molecules and attenuating
immune responses to stress [97–100], and inﬂuencing the expression of genes involved in oxidative
cytoprotection [101]. Studies conducted on patients with BD have reported lithium to decrease lipid
peroxidation levels [102], and ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, which reverses the effects of
oxidative stress [103]. Previous studies have reported lithium to prevent apoptosis by modulating
GSK3β [104], tumor protein p53 [105] and B-cell lymphoma 2 [106], to increase neurons, glial cells and
astrocyte density in brain areas such as the hippocampus [107], stimulate re-myelination and repair
demyelinated pathways [108]. Furthermore, various other second messenger systems are thought
to be involved with the therapeutic effects of lithium, including the phosphoinositide cycle, protein
kinase C, and intracellular Ca2+ [109]. Lithium is considered to ameliorate inositol depletion-related
mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase 1 [110], to enhance reparative
neuronal plasticity by inhibiting protein kinase C through a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase
substrate pathway [111], to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis by downregulating the transient receptor
potential channel 3 [112], and to enhance cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB) dependent gene transcription [113].

Disturbances in various neurotransmitter systems have been reported in BD. Numerous studies
including meta-analyses have suggested glutamatergic dysregulation to underlie the pathophysiology
of BD, with elevated levels of glutamate-related metabolites being observed in prefrontal–limbic
brain areas [114], and such glutamatergic dysregulation suggested to reﬂect glial abnormalities [115].
Also, the expression of subunits of NMDA glutamate receptors in the hippocampus, has been
shown to be decreased in BD [116]. Dopaminergic dysfunction has also been implicated in BD,
with excessive dopaminergic activity in mania precipitating dopamine receptor down-regulation,
and inducing a transition to depression [117]. Previous studies have also reported abnormalities in
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission in BD, with alterations in GABA platelet uptake [118]
and GABA transmission [119], along with increases in GABA/creatinine ratio [120]. Lithium has been
shown to modulate such neurotransmitters including glutamate, dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine
and glycine [109]. For glutamate, lithium has been reported to act on presynaptic terminals and
inhibit excitatory postsynaptic currents [121], increase enhancers and promoters of genes associated
with glutamate neurotransmission [122], decrease phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor subunits post-synaptically [123], along with NMDA-induced cytoskeletal deterioration [124].
In patients with BD, lithium has been shown to have a bimodal action in hippocampal glutamate
concentration depending on the plasma levels [125]. For dopamine, lithium is considered to exert
a regulatory effect and has been shown to prevent excessive dopamine release [126]. For GABA,
lithium has been reported to inﬂuence its neurotransmission, but the effects being less, compared to
glutamate [121]. For acetylcholine and glycine, lithium was recently reported to have inﬂuence on

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

7 of 17

both neurotransmitters, by attenuating depressive behaviors through cholinergic pathways [127], and
differentiating the expression of glycine transporters on neural cell surfaces [128].

There has been an increase in ﬁndings on lithium’s effects on circadian rhythms and the HPA axis,
which are both considered to be associated with the pathophysiology of BD. A signiﬁcant amount of
evidence indicate an association between circadian dysregulation and BD. Alterations in sleep structure
such as increased REM sleep density, sleep pattern variability, sleep latency, sleep duration, number
of arousals, and fragmented sleep, along with decreased sleep efﬁciency have been implicated in
BD [129,130]. Alterations in endocrine and neurotransmitter diurnal rhythms have also been suggested
in BD, with changes in melatonin secretion [131] and diurnal glucocorticoid regulation being reported.
Associations between circadian genes such as TIMELESS, ARNTL1, PER3, NR1D1, CLOCK, and
GSK3β, and BD have also been suggested [130]. Lithium has been shown to resynchronize circadian
rhythms [132] by modulating clock gene expression [133], and the treatment effects of lithium have
been shown to be mediated by circadian components [134]. Alterations in HPA axis function in BD
include excess corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion,
which ultimately increase cortisol levels [135]. Furthermore, decreased sensitivity of glucocorticoid
receptors which leads to the disruption of the HPA axis feedback regulation, has also been implicated
in BD [136]. Lithium has been suggested to activate the HPA axis, as lithium’s inﬂuence on protein
kinase C can in turn inﬂuence the expression of corticotrophins in the adrenal glands [137].

5. Lithium and Brain Structure

The majority of changes in the cellular level, neurotransmitter and neurotrophic systems [138,139]
indicate alterations in neuroplasticity to underlie the pathophysiology of BD. In order to elucidate
the neuroanatomical phenotype of BD, numerous imaging studies have been conducted, although
the results have been frequently equivocal and non-replicable. However, certain brain regions have
constantly been implicated in BD. Increased lateral ventricle volume that correlates with number of
episodes, has been identiﬁed in patients with BD, which indicates BD to be progressively deleterious to
the brain [140,141]. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is connected to limbic structures, and is
involved in processing emotionally relevant information. Decreases in volume of the ventromedial PFC
have been shown in adolescent patients with BD, but equivocal ﬁndings have been reported in adult
patients [142]. The dorsolateral PFC, which is part of an executive–cognitive network that regulates
limbic structures, has been shown to be decreased in thickness in patients with BD [143]. The anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC) connects prefrontal cortical areas with subcortical limbic regions, and plays an
important role in cognitive–emotional integration. Volume reductions in the ACC have been reported in
patients with BD. Inconsistent ﬁndings regarding hippocampal volume exist, with increased, decreased
and no difference in volume being observed in patients with BD [144]. As amygdala volume has been
reported to differ according to age group in BD, with smaller volumes being observed in adolescent
patients, and larger volumes being observed in adult patients, it is suggested that structural changes of
the amygdala may reﬂect progression of the disease [145]. Alterations of volume of other subcortical
regions, including the nucleus accumbens, putamen and caudate have also been reported, but with
mixed results [142]. Alterations in white matter (WM) integrity have also been widely reported by
numerous diffusion tensor imaging studies in patients with BD. WM tracts connecting the ACC
with the amygdala and hippocampus, and the frontal lobe with the insula, amygdala, hippocampus,
occipital lobe, thalamus and cingulate gyrus, have all been observed [146,147]. Such compromised
integrity of frontal–subcortical and prefrontal–limbic brain regions, may support an organic basis for
the symptomatology of BD.

In order to investigate the putative neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects of lithium, numerous
imaging studies have been conducted for the last decade. Although previous studies have also
reported no effect of lithium on brain structure [148–150], numerous studies have reported positive
effects of lithium on gray matter (GM) volume and WM integrity. BD patients who were treated
with lithium showed signiﬁcantly greater GM density compared to healthy controls in diffuse

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2679

8 of 17

cortical regions, particularly in the cingulate and paralimbic cortices, with the neurotrophic effects
of lithium suggested as a possible etiology of such neuroanatomic differences [151]. Lithium was
also shown to attenuate the decrease in both GM and WM in BD patients [152]. Daily dosage of
lithium treatment was positively correlated with superior temporal gyrus volume in patients with
BD [153], and BD patients on lithium also showed increased GM in the subgenual anterior cingulate
gyrus, postcentral gyrus, hippocampus/amygdala complex and insula compared to patients on other
treatment agents [154]. Signiﬁcantly decreased thalamus volume in lithium-free BD patients was
reported compared to healthy controls, whereas lithium-treated BD patients showed no difference
to the healthy control group [155]. In patients with BD depression, long-term lithium treatment was
associated with increased GM volumes including the dorsolateral PFC, orbitofrontal cortex, ACC,
superior temporal cortex, parieto-occipital cortex, and basal ganglia [15]. BD patients with over two
years of lithium treatment showed hippocampal volumes comparable to controls, whereas patients
with limited lifetime lithium exposure showed signiﬁcantly lower hippocampal volumes compared
to controls [156], with the ﬁndings being replicated in a subsequent study [157]. Imaging genetics
studies have been conducted on the inﬂuence of lithium and GSK3β promoter rs334558 polymorphism
on brain structure in patients with BD. The less active GSK3β rs334558*C gene-promoter variant and
long-term administration of lithium, were associated with increased WM integrity in regions including
the corpus callosum, forceps major, cingulum, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior
fronto-occipital fasciculus, posterior thalamic radiation, superior and posterior corona radiata, and
corticospinal tract [158]. Lithium treatment and the GSK3β promoter rs334558 polymorphism was
also synergistically associated with increased GM volumes including the subgenual and orbitofrontal
cortex in patients with BD depression [159]. A recent meta-analysis on GM volume in BD patients with
and without lithium treatment reported global GM volume to be signiﬁcantly larger in lithium-treated
BD patients compared to lithium-free patients [160]. However, due to the lack of correlations between
alterations in certain GM and WM structures and improvement of BD symptoms, brain structural
changes associated with lithium treatment may not always be interpreted as direct results of the
therapeutic effects of lithium, and the ﬁndings from imaging studies should be interpreted with caution.

6. Conclusions

BD is a heterogeneous condition with a myriad of symptoms varying in manifestation, and
the dysregulation of numerous biochemical pathways have been suggested to be involved in the
pathogenesis of BD. As the complex therapeutic mechanisms of lithium are gradually becoming
unraveled, it is becoming more evident that the cellular mechanisms and biological systems modulated
by lithium, are deeply intertwined with the biological disruptions implicated in BD. Therefore, a deeper
and clearer understanding of the speciﬁc therapeutic mechanisms of lithium, will aid us to establish
a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BD. Although it
is undeniable that lithium is effective in the treatment and prophylaxis of BD, certain subtypes of
the disorder seem to respond less to lithium, and not all patients beneﬁt from its treatment effects.
The identiﬁcation of biologic predictors of lithium response remains an important step in the pursuit
of personalized medicine for the treatment of BD [161]. As current neuroimaging techniques enable
us to study the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of BD, along with the neuroprotective and
neurotrophic effects of lithium, future imaging studies are anticipated to facilitate the identiﬁcation
and investigation of biologic predictors of lithium response. The fact that lithium has withstood several
ordeals, such as the concerns on its possible fatal toxicity and difﬁculty of use, and has stayed strong
as the treatment of choice for BD for over six decades, proves lithium to be a goodie. Even Nirvana
made a song about it.
