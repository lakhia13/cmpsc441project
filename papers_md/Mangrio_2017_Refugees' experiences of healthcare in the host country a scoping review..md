Refugees’ experiences of healthcare in the
host country: a scoping review
Elisabeth Mangrio1,2* and Katarina Sjögren Forss1,2

Abstract

Background: During the last years, Europe experienced an increase in immigration due to a variety of worldwide
wars and conflicts, which in turn resulted in a greater number of physical and mental health issues present among
the refugees. These factors place high demands not only on the refugees, but also on healthcare professionals who
meet the refugees in different situations. Information about the refugees’ experiences of the healthcare systems in
their host countries is urgently needed to improve the quality of healthcare delivered, as well as to provide
opportunities for better access. The aim of this scoping review is to compile research about the experiences that
the refugees have with the healthcare systems in their host countries.
Methods: This study was conducted as a scoping review and the methodology is derived from Levac et al. and
with inspiration from the framework of Arksey & O’Malley. A systematic article search was done in Medline, Cinahl
and Psychinfo. A total of 619 articles were found in the search and finally 26 articles met the inclusion criteria and
were included.

Results: The results show that communication between healthcare professionals and refugees is important, however,
insufficient language knowledge acts as an effective communication barrier. There is a need for more information to
be given to the refugees about the reception country’s healthcare system in both oral and written formats, as well as
the right to healthcare. Support from healthcare professionals is also important for refugees to have a positive
experience with healthcare. In some of the studies included, refugees experienced discrimination due to low
proficiency in the language of the host country, and/or because of their race or accent, which shows that
culturally appropriate healthcare is needed for them.
Conclusions: Since refugees are suffering from poor mental and physical health and could therefore be at a
greater risk of morbidity and mortality in comparison to the rest of the population of the host country, there
is an urgent need for improvements in communication, interpretation, support, and deliverance of culturally
appropriate healthcare.

Keywords: Communication, Experiences, Healthcare, Refugees, Scoping review, Support

Background
Research suggest that understanding the refugees experi-
ence of and access to healthcare are important factors
for improving their health [1], as access has been found
to be a leading health indicator [2]. Health is an every-
day resource and one of the most fundamental condi-
tions for an individual’s potential for development to be
for an
fulfilled [3], as well as a key component

immigrant’s integration into the society and the labour
market. However,
from both Sweden and
Canada show a decline in health status among the refu-
gees after settling in their host country [4, 5].

findings

Numerous refugees and asylum seekers undergo both
physical and psychological stress in their country of ori-
gin, as well as during the transition to and upon arrival
in the host country, which can increase their risk of de-
veloping mental health problems [6]. Depression and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with
refugees, as it was found that they are more likely to suf-
fer from mental distress in comparison to non-refugees

[7]. In a qualitative study done with Iraqi refugee women
in the United States, the women expressed and com-
plained about poor physical health, anxiety, stomach
pain, psychological discomfort, thyroid disease, chronic
disease and other physical and psychological health is-
sues [8]. Another study, based on a survey among newly
arrived adult immigrants residing in the US, found that
among them chronic health conditions such as high
cholesterol, hypertension, overweight/obesity and dia-
betes were reported. Of the participants, 60% reported
to have at least one chronic condition, while 37% re-
ported to have at least two chronic conditions. The
prevalence of anxiety, depression and emotional stress
was approximately 50% among the participants, and 31%
were identified as having PTSD [9]. These findings are
in line with an Australian study that screened asylum
seekers for mental health status, which shows that 50%
of the designated population had mental
illness, with
around 25% screening positive for PTSD [10]. Various
other factors also play a role and may affect the refugees’
health status, including: country of birth, level of ability
to communicate in English, community capital, stage of
life, and each individual’s balance of protective and risk
factors [11].

However, even though they have a higher need for
healthcare in comparison to others, refugees face sub-
stantial barriers when it comes to healthcare access—
barriers [12] that can form as a result of language issues,
as well as from cultural and economic aspects [12, 13].
Another factor that also has been found acting as a bar-
rier to healthcare access for refugees is fear, both a fear
that visiting a healthcare centre or a General Practitioner
(GP) might lead to having their immigration status re-
ported to law enforcement authorities, and a fear that
care will be denied [14].

All these factors place high demands not only on the
refugees, but also on healthcare professionals who meet
the refugees in different situations. Healthcare profes-
sionals should understand both the culture of an individ-
ual’s country of birth and the immigration experience,
but are often unsure about the refugees’ entitlements to
healthcare [11], which is a factor that might also influ-
ence the refugees’ experience of healthcare. If the experi-
seeking care is negative—e.g.
ence of
feelings of
alienation and mistrust—this might prevent the refugees
from seeking care in the future [15]. Not seeking care
when needed might contribute to the growing health in-
equality between individuals from different countries of
origin that many countries in Europe are facing, as well
as the US [16, 17].

During the last years, Europe faced a sharp increase in
immigration [18]. The main factors contributing to this
increase are both natural and human-generated disas-
ters, including social, economic and political instability

[18]. The growing number of refugees presents an im-
mense challenge to the healthcare systems of the coun-
tries receiving them [11], and there is a general lack of
readiness to handle and understand the healthcare needs
of the refugees among healthcare professionals [19]. In-
formation about the refugees’ experiences of the health-
care systems of their host countries is urgently needed
to improve the quality of healthcare delivered as well as
to provide opportunities for better access [20]. To the
best of our knowledge, there has been no earlier study
conducted with the same scope. Thus, we undertook a
scoping review to compile research about the experi-
ences that refugees have with the healthcare system in
the host country.

Aim
The aim of this scoping review is to compile research
about the experiences that refugees have with the health-
care system in their host countries.

Method
This study was conducted as a scoping review and its
methodology is derived from Levac et al. [21]. The
intention of the review was to map the literature in the
field, rather than to specifically assess the quality of the
included studies [22]. We preferred a scoping review to
a systematic review since a scoping review can address a
broader research question and include a variety of study
designs, compared to a systematic review where the
focus is on a well-defined question with a limited variety
of study designs. This scoping study was inspired by the
framework of Arksey & O’Malley [22] and therefore
conducted using the following steps: 1. Identifying a re-
search question, 2. Identifying relevant studies, 3. Study
selection, 4. Charting the data, 5. Collating, summarizing
and reporting results.

Identifying the research question
How do refugees perceive the healthcare given to them
in the host
to leaving their
homeland?

subsequent

country

This includes mental healthcare, primary healthcare
and hospital care, with the focus being on the percep-
tions of the adult asylum seekers and refugees. If studies
were conducted with both service holders and refugees,
the perceptions of the refugees had to be clearly defined
in order for them to be considered.

Identifying relevant studies
Both authors developed the search strategy, as they have
previous experience in performing database searches.
Literature search was done in Pubmed, Cinahl and Psy-
chinfo, and the following search blocks were built: “refu-
gee”, “healthcare” and “experience”. A search strategy

Mangrio and Sjögren Forss BMC Health Services Research  (2017) 17:814 

Page 3 of 16

using Medical Subject Headings (MESH) and text words
was developed for each keyword and database. See all
search terms in Table 1. The literature searches were
conducted in March 2017. No limitation was placed on
the year of publication, while the language of the publi-
cations was limited to English.

Study selection
The total number of articles found using the search
terms in the three databases was 619 (Fig. 1). First, the
titles were screened and, if they were in line with the
aim, the abstract was read. Using this screening method-
ology the number of articles was narrowed down to 91.
Out of these 91 articles, 10 articles were found to be du-
plicates and 39 articles appeared to be relevant. These
were printed in full, and the authors reached consensus
regarding which of them should be included. In this
third phase, 13 articles were excluded after scientific ap-
praisal, as they did not address the aim of the study (see
Fig. 1). In the end, 26 papers were included and a sum-
mary of the eligible studies can be seen in Table 2.

Quality appraisal
The aim of this scoping review was to map the literature
about refugees’ experiences with healthcare in their host
country. As Arksey & O’Malley [22] suggest, a quality
appraisal of the included studies in a scoping review is
not required. To be included in a scoping review, the
only quality criterion a study should have is to be peer
reviewed.

Charting, collating, summarising and reporting the results
After reading the included articles, the data from the ar-
ticles were interpreted and synthesised.
In order to
understand the key concepts and sources of evidence
found in the literature, a thematic analysis of the mater-
ial was conducted. All the relevant data that addressed
the aim of this scoping review were charted and sorted
according to key issues and themes, by extracting find-
indicators. The two authors,
ings and key contextual
both independently and collaboratively, reviewed the
resulting findings. All relevant information about au-
thors, method, number of participants, country, aim and
results were divided per article and can be seen in
Table 2.

Results
The results are based on 26 studies from the following
countries: Canada (N = 3), United States (N = 5), United
Kingdom (N = 4), Australia (N = 7), Netherlands (N = 1),
Sweden (N = 2),
Iran (N = 1), Scotland (N = 2) and
Greece (N = 1). The following themes and headings
emerged from the analysis of the studies: communica-
tion and information in healthcare, understanding the
language,
satisfaction with healthcare, dissatisfaction
with healthcare, access to healthcare, continuity of care,
perceived discrimination, culturally appropriate care and
knowledge of healthcare and system.

Communication and information in healthcare
In a Canadian study by Ahmed [23], the majority of refu-
gee women felt that they could not discuss their feelings
of depression with their doctors, either because they were
too rushed, or because the doctors did not ask them about
possible emotional disturbances during the check-ups. For
many women, the post-natal delivery visit from a nurse
was the only encounter with a healthcare professional
where they could discuss possible feelings of depression.
Only one of the women discussed her depression with a
psychologist, but did not find it helpful. However, in a
study by Herrel [24], which aimed to understand how
Somali women experienced pregnancy and childbirth,
most of the women in the focus groups felt that they were
the key decision-makers during the birth of their child.

In a different Canadian study by Chen et al. [25], some
participants felt insufficient or impersonal communica-
tion. In an American study by Shannon [26], the authors
concluded that two-thirds of the participants were never
asked by a doctor about the political conflict in their
country, nor how this may have affected them. Many
participants did not feel comfortable starting a conversa-
tion about their war trauma, but would most likely have
responded if the doctor initiated the discussion. Language
was also reported to be a communication barrier. Accord-
ing to Wångdahl et al. [27], refugees with inadequate
health literacy, which could be described as lesser know-
ledge about health, experienced poor quality of communi-
cation during health examinations more often, and
consequently found the health examinations less useful.

According to several studies, more information needs
to be provided about the participants’ healthcare rights
as asylum seekers [28], about their disease [29] and
about the delivery room experience—e.g. pain medica-
tion, why prenatal visits are important, using interpret-
ation services at the hospital and what they can expect
from the hospital staff [24]. In a study by Murray [30],
the participants reported that they did not get any infor-
mation about the ultrasound. According to a Canadian
study by Donnelly et al. [31], there was a lack of infor-
mation about how to cope with mental illness and its

related problems. In a Scottish study by O’Donnell et al.
[32], the results showed that the asylum seekers were
supposed to receive written information from the health
board telling them how to register with a general practi-
tioner (GP), but some did not get this information. Ac-
cording to Owens [33], the informants felt that they
received all the necessary information about pregnancy
and that they could ask questions when necessary. Red-
man et al. [34], showed that only nine out of the 30 in-
formants had received information about
the free
National Health Service and that they wished for even
more information about this service. In the Swedish
study by Wångdahl et al. [27], the results showed that a
considerable portion of the informants felt that they re-
ceived little healthcare information during the examin-
ation, and that the quality of communication was low.
At least 30% of the informants did not understand what
they were being told. A higher portion were not in-
formed at all about their rights to healthcare, nor where
to go if mentally ill. Refugees with inadequate health lit-
they received
eracy had to a lower extent

that

felt

enough with healthcare information and experienced
not receiving any help with health problems.

Understanding the language
According to the study by Asgary [28], the informants
pointed out that there was a lack of interpretation, that
they experienced difficulties finding interpreters and were
having problems communicating with health profes-
sionals. The findings from Bhatia [35] confirm those from
Asgary [26], as the informants in this study also experi-
enced language barrier difficulties and difficulties in
obtaining a translator. Sometimes appointments with doc-
tors had to be rescheduled because no translator showed
up. It was only those refugees that were accompanied by a
friend, relative or refugee agency staff that could undergo
a trouble-free registration process. In the study by Chen
[25], some of the refugees experienced difficulties commu-
nicating because they lacked English and French language
skills. Cheng [36] found that it was difficult for refugees to
make appointments because of low proficiency in the
the language
English language, and that because of

experiences of immigrant
and refugee women by

regarding factors that

coping.

The majority of the women felt
that they could not discuss their
feelings of depression with their
doctors because they were too
rushed, or that the doctors didn’t
ask anything about their possible
emotional disturbances during the
check-ups. In contrast, many of the
women had perceived the nurses
visiting them after birth to be
more helpful and spent enough
time with them in order to feel
comfortable to raise emotional
issues.

The experiences varied between
the participants regarding the
health care in the US and the
asylum seekers had fear of
deportation, detention and loss of
legal status. They would have liked
more information about their
health care rights as asylum
seekers. They also expressed lack
of interpretation and having
problems communicating with
health professionals.

There were difficulties
encountered in many aspects of
the health care. Difficulties such as
locating practices and
experiencing language difficulties
and difficulties to get a translator.
Some respondents felt
discrimination and felt that it had
to be dealt with in the whole
country and not just in the health
care sectors.

They reported problem with
accessing and utilizing mental
health service and this aggravated
the stress they experienced and
discouraged them for further on
accessing support. They
experienced stigma and
discrimination since they
perceived health professionals
changing demeanors for example
putting on extra pair of gloves.
They lacked a sensitivity among
health professionals, when
handling information about their
HIV status. Some had experienced
difficulties communicating
because of deficiency in English
and French.

Refugees reported challenges in
the language, transport to the
practice and appointment waiting
times. It was difficult to make
appointments because of low
proficiency in the English
language. Also, they preferred
verbal reminders over written
reminders.

The participants reported that
they trusted Western biomedicine
and its effectiveness in treating
mental illness. However, many
were unfamiliar with the
healthcare system and avoided
to seek help as they were not
familiar with the ideas of mental
health and available treatments
for such illness. Limited skills in
English, lack of professional interpreters
disabled most of the participants from
getting access or benefits from mental
health counselling services.
Lack of information was and

where to find information was
also reported as well as the
need of having written
information. Many of the
participants had experienced
that their health care provider
did not spend enough time with
them and consequently they felt
disappointed and there was a
distrust to the health care system.

They reported problems with
waiting and that could prolong
the process of getting cure for
diseases. Another aspect of
complaints were lack of
knowledge of how to access
primary health care services.
They also mentioned short
consultations and that the
doctors were too hastened to
encourage full and honest
assessments and especially if an
interpreter were present. They also
mentioned communication
barriers for those that had a
deficiency in English.

Rudeness, anger and impatience
were part of several negative
episodes. Some of the patients
felt that they could not trust or
trust their general practitioner,
which were seen as an essential
element in the health care. Some
were very thankful for help given
during critical moments at the
hospital and others felt that the
referral to specialist were too
long of a wait.

Most women spoke highly about
the support they had got during
labor work, although some
women questioned the
competence of the nursing staff
at the wards. Some felt
discriminated on the basis of race
and felt less sensitive care from
the staff and others felt
discriminated because of not
speaking English. They also felt an
urgent need from the health care
staff to understand the cultural
differences of Somali Women.
The women would have liked
more information about the
delivery room experience, pain
medication, why prenatal visits
are important, interpretation
use at the hospital and how
they can expect the staff at
hospital to work.

They perceived to be
discriminated through not being
admitted in some hospitals,
higher costs and being ignored.
They also expressed feelings like
being alone and feeling isolated
since some Iranians disgusted
Afghans and were afraid that they
would spread infections. Some
participants expressed gratitude
for helping them with diagnosing
and curing their illnesses.

The women reported pre-booking
challenges and also their lack of
understanding their entitlement to
free health care. Some of the women
said that their midwife was a
source of support in different
ways, however it was also
reported that the midwifes did
not understand their immigrations
status. They also described that they
in different situations not were
asked or listened to by healthcare
personnel (midwifes, GPs, nurses).

Some differences in the
experiences of healthcare were
seen among the refugees
from Bosnia as compared to
those from former Soviet Union.
But overall, the participants
worried about adequate health
care insurance and did not like
the long waits for appointment
and in emergency room. The
health care system was found
confusing and the amount of
paperwork required for healthcare
was a source of distress.
Lack of interpreters was a major
problem and language barriers
i.e., resulted in misunderstanding
in directions for taking medications.
Health care professionals was seen
polite and very professional and the
respondents liked the clean and
well-equipped facilities.

The participants reported no or
a little knowledge about the
Australian health system and
their rights in relation to standard
treatment, hospital policies and
health education opportunities.
They also reported that they
were not understood. They did
not know that interpreters could
be available in the hospital, instead
they often used unofficial
interpreters. They reported that
they did not get any information
about ultrasound and they
experienced frustration over lack
of continuity of care. However,
most reported that the midwifes
were kind, supportive and helpful.

Confusion and lack of
knowledge/information regarding
Australian healthcare including
the public and private systems
emerged as a recurring theme.
The use of healthcare services
yielded significant associations
with country of birth groups, type
of visa, English language ability
and employment status. Gender
of the treating doctor and
communication were also found
as factors influencing the
experiences of healthcare. The
majority expressed a satisfaction
with the care provided, however
a number expressed concern with
perceived lack of their doctor, and
“unease” with the treatment
provided. There was also a
frustration at the length of time
and complicated procedure to be
referred to a specialist.

Results

They thought that the health care
was good compare to the home
country and the concept of free
health care for all was welcome.
They were used to quick access
to doctors visits but didn’t get that
every time here in Scotland and that
was disappointing for them. Some
perceived the GPs to not be
specialized and lacked confidence
in them. Some thought that
being examined by a GP meant
to be examined physically and
when that was not always done
that way, they felt confused with
misunderstanding and not
understanding the system of
health examination here in
the West.

The asylum seekers received
written information from health
board telling how to register with
a GP. But some didn’t get
information. Complaints were
given regarding long waiting for
appointment, not feeling that
the GP:s were specialized or lack
of continuity. In general the
interpretation service were
appeared to be well organized,
but some lacked interpreters at
key points in their hospital stay
and interpreters were less
common at the dental care
compared to the GP.

There was a lack expressed of
familiarity with the Australian
health care system and the
scarcity of Dari speaking
interpreters in Australia. Some
expressed feelings of
discrimination because of accent
or lack ofunderstanding. Others
expressed stereotyping relating
to religion and Islamic attire and
this were perceived to inhibit
access to health care. Complaints
existed about gender issues, costs
of travel, long waiting times and
lack of health related information
in Dari. Others were mentioning
lack of culturally appropriate
health promotion in order to
help with necessary
lifestyle changes.

The women appreciated the
service given them by the
midwifes and doctors at the
Health center and appreciated
flexible appointment times, but
that was not the case regarding
appointments at the hospitals.
Many of the women lacked
friends and family and could
see the midwives as friends and
they appreciated thecontinuity of
the same midwife. Interpreters
were available but some women
wanted to converse in English.
The women felt that they had
received all necessary information
about pregnancy and felt that
they could ask questions when
necessary.

To explore refugees’ perspectives regarding
the nature of communication barriers that
impede the exploration of symptoms of war
trauma in primary care.

The language barrier affected
significantly the participants’
attitudes to antenatal care and
also their access to maternity
services. Greek maternity services
lack interpreting services and written
information is in Greek. Language
barriers as well as financial barriers
were to main reasons for missing
appointments. The participants
also reported unfamiliarity with
the national health system.
There was a lack of psychological
support as social workers in public
hospitals only take care of
financial or bureaucratic issues
and not issues concerning health.
The time factor was also reported
to be a barrier that prevented
them from using the maternity
service as they wanted the staff
to have more time to listening to
their feelings, discussing different
perinatal issues as well as giving
advice.

Several participants appreciated
having the same physician but
some felt that they were sent
between different health
providers. Some felt that the
health care providers showed
interest in them as persons but
some felt routine medical
examinations were given without
commitment. Some informants
wished for more information about
their disease and treatment.

Only nine of the informants had
received information about the
free national health service and
they wished for more information
about this service. The majority of
the informants had received initial
health assessment andwere
positive about that.

An universally critical of the US
health care system was reported.
The participants described several
core issues: confusion about
insurance coverage, personalized
quality of care, access to primary
and speciality care; and a
perception of U.S health care as
bureaucratic.

Two-thirds of the participants had
never been asked by a doctor
about the political conflict in their
country or the ways they had
been affected by it. Many
participants did not feel
comfortable to start a
conversation about their war
trauma, but would most likely
respond if the doctor initiated a
discussion. A majority of the
participants reported interest in
learning more about the impact
of stress and trauma on their
health. Language was reported a
barrier to communication. Several
participants did not appear to
define or understand health care
as extending to mental health.

To investigate refugees experiences of
communication during their health
examination for asylum seekers and the
usefulness of the examination and whether
health literacy is associated with those
experiences

Some asylum seekers thought it
was difficult to be able to see a
doctor, since they couldn’t afford
the consultation fee and they
expressed negative experiences
of being billed anyway. Some
asylum seekers gained access to
doctors through charitable
services but reported that their
options were limited and long
waiting time. Many asylum
seekers felt their access to health
care was limited by lack of
information, particularly when
newly arrived.

Waiting lists, ineligibility criteria,
and continuity of care issues,
including referrals from service to
service were described as distressing.
Cultural responsiveness was very
important to participants, and evidently
often a challenge for practitioners.
Participants wanted practitioners to be
ready to learn about and accommodate
nuances in ethnic and religious identities.

A considerable proportion of the
participants experienced that they
received little health care information
during the examination and the
quality of the communication was low.
A higher proportion experienced
that they were not informed about
their rights to health care or where
to go if mentally ill. Many of the
participants experienced that they
did not receive any new knowledge
or help during the health examination.
Refugees with inadequate health
literacy, experienced more often
poor quality of communication
during health examinations and
experienced the health examination
less useful. They had also to a lower
extent felt that they received enough
with health care information.

problem they preferred verbal reminders over written re-
minders. In a study by Fang [37], language barriers for
those that had a deficiency in English were also men-
tioned, with many participants noting that interpreters
were either not available or, if they were, there was a prob-
lem with confidentiality. This issue arose from the fact
that the majority of the interpreters were from the same
community as the refugees themselves, and therefore they
were afraid of personal information being disclosed among
the community. According to Herrel [24], all of the
women had used interpreters during their delivery, but
many thought that the interpreters were not competent in
medical terminology and several suggested that sometimes
the patients had more knowledge of medical terms in
comparison to the interpreters. In a study by Lipson [38],
lack of interpreters presented a major problem, and lan-
guage barriers resulted in misunderstanding of instruc-
tions for proper usage of medications. In the study by
Murray [30], the participants also reported that they were
not understood. They did not know that interpreters
could be provided in the hospital; instead, they often

preters in Australia. In the study by Owens et al.
interpreters were available, but some women
[33],
wanted to converse in English. None of the women
with limited or no knowledge of English had an inter-
preter at birth, but
their husbands could speak
English. According to a study by Penagiota [40],
Greek maternity services

sons for missing appointments. In the Canadian study

experiences of healthcare

Satisfaction with healthcare
In the study by Ahmed et al. [23], many of the women
perceived the nurses visiting them after birth to be help-
ful. The nurses spent enough time with them in order
for the women to feel comfortable enough to raise emo-
tional issues. In the study by Murray [30], most women
also reported that the midwives were kind, supportive
and helpful. In the American study by Herrel et al. [24],
the findings showed that most women spoke highly
about the support they received during labour. Accord-
ing to a study by Lephard et al. [41], some of the women
said that their midwife was a source of support in differ-
ent ways and in the study by Owens et al. [33], the infor-
mants appreciated feeling understood by the midwife,
doctor and staff at
the health centre. Many lacked
friends and family, and could see the midwives as
friends. They saw the midwife as the only practical help
that they would get during pregnancy. According to
Lipson [38], healthcare professionals were seen as polite
and very professional, and the respondents liked the
clean and well-equipped facilities. According to a study
by Neale et al. [42], gender of the treating doctor and
communication were also factors influencing the refu-
gees’
and the majority
expressed satisfaction with the care provided. In the
Swedish study by Razavi et al. [29], some participants
felt that the healthcare providers showed interest in
them as persons by engaging into a small conversation
about daily life with them, for instance, and that was
seen as a sign of commitment, knowledge and skill and
according to Feldmann et al. [43], some were very grate-
ful for help provided during critical moments at the hos-
pital. In a Scottish study by O’Donnell CA et al. [44],
the results showed that the refugees thought health-
care was good when compared to the country of
origin, and that the concept of free healthcare for all
was welcome. Two issues appeared to build asylum
seekers confidence in the GP’s: 1) seeing the same
doctor each time they attended the surgery, and 2)
the feeling that the doctor respected them. For some
of the respondents it was important that the GP not
only listened to them medically, but also tried to
understand their situation as asylum seekers. And
similar results could be seen in the study by O’Donell
et al. [32], where most reported positive experiences
regarding the care provided by their GP’s and in the
study by Redman et al. [34], the majority of the infor-
mants received initial health assessments and were
positive about that. Heydari et al. [45] reported that
the
some participants expressed gratitude towards
healthcare personnel
for helping them diagnose and
cure their illnesses, for their honest work and impar-
tial care, and also for realising what their problems
were and cooperating with them.

Dissatisfaction with healthcare
According to the study by Panagiota et al. [40], there
was a lack of psychological support, as social workers in
public hospitals only take care of financial or bureau-
cratic issues and not issues concerning health. The time
factor was also reported to be a barrier that prevented
them from using the maternity service as they wanted
the staff to have more time to listening to their feelings,
discussing different perinatal issues as well as giving ad-
vice [40]. Another aspect that was mentioned was the at-
titude of the people staffing the service centres, where
some women felt very discouraged by the staff that did
not seem interested in them [23]. In the Canadian study
by Donnelly et al. [31], many of the participants had ex-
perienced that their health care provider did not spend
enough time with them and consequently they felt dis-
appointed and there was a distrust to the health care
system. In the American study by Asgary et al. [28], the
authors could see that experiences varied among the
participants regarding healthcare in the US, and that the
asylum seekers had a fear of deportation, detention and
loss of legal status. Some felt that the doctors did not
pay much attention to them, but thought that that was
because they did not have documents and could not
therefore complain. According to the study by Fang et
al. [37], the informants also mentioned short consulta-
tions with the doctors being too hasty to encourage full
and honest assessments, especially if an interpreter was
present. In a Dutch study by Feldmann et al. [43], the re-
sults showed that rudeness, anger and impatience were
part of several negative episodes. Anger about a request
to see a female practitioner for a gynaecological prob-
lem, impatience towards a young and worried mother
bringing her child in with a cold, and unfriendly remarks
about Dutch language skills towards a recently arrived
woman. Some of the informants felt that they could not
trust their GP, which is considered an essential element
of healthcare and others felt that the referral to a spe-
cialist was too long of a wait. It was also reported that
the midwives did not understand their immigration sta-
tus [41]. The informants also described that in various
different situations they were not asked nor listened to
by healthcare personnel (midwifes, GPs, nurses) [41].
According to O’Donnell et al. [32], the refugees were not
feeling that the GPs were specialized e.g. hoping for a re-
ferral to secondary care but instead receiving a prescrip-
tion or lack of continuity of care e.g. seeing a different
doctor each time they attended the surgery [32] or they
felt that the care had not met their expectations [32]. In
the study by Omeri et al. [39], complaints arose about
gender issues, costs of travel, long waiting times and lack
of health-related information in the Dari language. In an
American study by Searight [46], the authors found that
a universal criticism of the US healthcare system was

reported. The participants described several core issues:
1) confusion about insurance coverage, 2) personalized
quality of care, 3) access to primary and specialty care
and 4) a perception of US healthcare system as bureau-
cratic. In the study by Razavi [29], some participants felt
routine medical examinations were given without com-
mitment.
the participants
expressed lack of confidence in the GP’s [42, 44] and in
the nurses [24, 42].

In Several of

the studies,

Access to healthcare
According to the study by Asgary et al. [28], some par-
ticipants experienced difficulties with payments for the
doctor’s visits and were praying that they would not get
sick. In the Australian study by Spike et al. [47], the re-
sults showed that some asylum seekers thought it was
difficult to see a doctor, since they could not afford the
consultation fee, and they reported negative experiences
of being billed anyway. Some gained access to doctors
through charitable services, but reported that their op-
tions were limited and required long waiting times. This
resulted in physical suffering, stress, anxiety and,
in
some cases, serious health illnesses. In the American
study by Lipson [38], the authors noted differences in
the experiences of healthcare among the refugees from
Bosnia when compared to those from the former Soviet
Union. The differences in the experiences are based on
the historical circumstances of their refugee status and
economic factors in their home countries and health
care systems. Overall, however, the participants worried
equally about adequate healthcare insurance, and did
not like the long waiting times for appointments and in
the emergency room. In the study by Cheng et al. [36],
the refugees also reported challenges with appointment
waiting times and the transport to the clinic. Long wait-
ing times were also confirmed as an issue in the studies
by O’Donnell et al. [32] and Fang et al. [37], where the
authors concluded that the refugees’ problems with wait-
ing times could prolong the process of obtaining treat-
ment for their diseases [37]. Bhatia [35], also noted that
the participants had difficulties in locating clinics.

Lack of knowledge about how to access primary
healthcare services was another aspect that caused griev-
ance. In the study by Fang et al. [37], the informants also
lacked familiarity with the UK health system, and had
limited knowledge of the different health services that
were available, as well as of the processes and proce-
dures for accessing health services. According to the
study by Neale [42],
the use of healthcare services
yielded significant associations with country of birth
groups, visa types, English language ability and employ-
ment status. There was also a frustration among the par-
ticipants about
the time-consuming and complicated
nature of the specialist referral procedure. According to

O’Donnell et al. [44], the participants were used to hav-
ing quick access for doctors’ visits, but were disap-
pointed when they did not get it for every visit in
Scotland. In the study by Omeri et al. [39], some experi-
enced stereotyping related to religion and Islamic attire,
and this was perceived to inhibit access to healthcare. In
the Australian study by Owens et al. [33], the results
showed that the women appreciated the services pro-
vided to them by the midwives and doctors at the health
centre and the flexible appointment times, but that was
not the case with hospital appointments. In the Greek
study by Penagiota [40], the authors found that the lan-
guage barrier affected the participants’ attitudes to ante-
natal care significantly, as well as
to
maternity services.

their access

Many asylum seekers felt their access to healthcare
was limited due to a lack of information, particularly
upon first arrival. In an Australian study by Valibhoy et
al. [48], waiting lists,
ineligibility criteria and referrals
from service to service, were described as distressing. In
the Canadian study by Chen et al. [25], a problem with
accessing and utilizing mental health services was re-
ported, which aggravated the stress that the participants
experienced and discouraged them from accessing sup-
port later on.

Continuity of care
In the study by Chen et al. [25], some participants felt
that sometimes the health professionals failed to follow
up on them as promised. One woman mentioned that
she had to wait for 2 months for a counsellor appoint-
ment and described the waiting period as tiring and life-
threatening. In the study by Razavi [29], the results
showed that several participants appreciated having the
same physician, but others felt that they were sent back
and forth between different health providers. Therefore,
they felt that they did not have a permanent care pro-
vider in charge of them who would take on the overall
responsibility. This was confirmed in the study by Mur-
ray [30], where the refugees experienced frustration over
the lack of continuity of care, as well as in the study by
Bhatia [35], where some of the refugees wished for more
continuity with both the same GP and the same transla-
tor in order to develop trust. At the same time, in the
study by Owens [33], the refugees appreciated the con-
tinuity that having the same midwife during the entire
pregnancy provided. However in the Australian study by
Valibhoy et al. [48], the refugees felt stressed about the
lack of continuity of care within the mental health care.

Perceived discrimination
In the study by Chen et al. [25], the participants experienced
stigma and discrimination when they noticed that the health
professionals were changing demeanours—putting on an

extra pair of gloves, for example. They also noted a lack of
sensitivity among the health professionals when handling in-
formation about their HIV status, and felt confronted with
discrimination that stemmed from their HIV and immigra-
tion status merged together. In the study by Herrel et al.
[24], many of the women made negative comments about
the care that they received from the nursing staff at the
wards. Some felt discriminated against on the basis of race
and felt that the staff was less sensitive when providing care,
while others felt discriminated against due to not speaking
English. In the Iranian study by Heydari et al. [45], the results
showed that the participants perceived to be discriminated
against when they were not admitted to some hospitals, as
well as when they faced higher costs and were being ignored.
They also expressed that they felt alone and isolated, since
some Afghans were disgusted by Iranians and were afraid
that they would spread infections. This view on Afghan
people was not just concerning the ones recently arriving,
but also the ones that had been living in Iran for many years.
In the study by Omeri et al. [39], some participants expressed
feelings of discrimination due to having an accent or lack of
understanding. According to Bhatia [35], some respondents
experienced discrimination and felt that it had to be dealt
with in the whole country, not just within the healthcare sec-
tors, in order for the refugees to feel comfortable in the
healthcare system.

Culturally appropriate care
In the study by Fang et al. [37], the authors highlighted
that beyond addressing the language issue there was also
a need for a more culturally competent system, and that
there was a need to address cultural differences concern-
ing symptomologies, diagnoses and medical terminology.
In the study by Herrel [24], the authors also felt that
there was an urgent need for the healthcare staff to
understand the cultural differences of Somali women.
study also suggested that all members of a

healthcare team should receive cultural sensitivity train-
ing that includes topics such as Somali culture, tradi-
tions, values and Somali patient expectations. According
to O’Donnell et al. [44], some participants thought that

ally, so when that was not always the case they felt con-

al. [39], lack of culturally appropriate health promotion
to help with necessary lifestyle changes was mentioned.
It was suggested that more assistance should be given
through information in the Dari and Farsi
languages,
and they wanted the services given to reflect Islamic
teachings. In the study by Valibhoy et al. [48], cultural
responsiveness was very important to participants, and
evidently it often presented a challenge for practitioners.

Knowledge about healthcare and system
In the English study by Lephard & Haith Cooper [41],
the authors found that women reported pre-booking
challenges and also lacked understanding of their entitle-
to free healthcare. According to the study by
ment
Lipson [38], the healthcare system was confusing to
many, and the amount of paperwork required for health-
care purposes was a source of distress. In the Australian
study by Murray [30], the authors could see that the in-
formants reported little or no knowledge about
the
Australian health system and their rights in relation to
standard treatment, hospital policies and health educa-
tion opportunities. In two other studies from Australia
[39, 42], the authors noted that confusion and lack of
knowledge/information regarding Australian healthcare,
including the public and private systems, emerged as a
recurring theme. According to the study by Penagiota
[40], the informants also reported unfamiliarity with the
national health system.
In the Canadian study by
Donnelly et al. [31] many were unfamiliar with the
healthcare system and avoided to seek help as they were
not familiar with the ideas of mental health and available
treatments for such illness. In the study by Shannon
[26], a majority of the participants reported interest in
learning more about the impact of stress and trauma on
their health. Several participants, however, did not ap-
pear to define or understand healthcare as extending to
mental health. In the study by Razavi [29], some infor-
mants wished for more information about their disease
and treatment strategy, while patients expressed poor
understanding of the diagnosis and why a specific cat-
egory of care provider should be consulted. According
to Wångdahl [27], many of the participants did not re-
ceive any new information or help during the health ex-
aminations, and felt
they received new health
knowledge during the visits in low extent.

that

Discussion
The results of this scoping review show that communi-
cation between the health professionals and the refugees
is important, but that insufficient language knowledge
acts as a communication barrier. There is a need for the
refugees to be provided with more information about
the healthcare system, in both oral and written formats,
as well as with the right to healthcare in the reception
countries. Support given by the health professionals is of
great importance for a positive encounter with health-
care. Waiting times, economy and transportation are
perceived to be barriers to healthcare access, and con-
tinuity of care is also of importance. In some of the in-
cluded studies, a certain portion of refugees reports that

Mangrio and Sjögren Forss BMC Health Services Research  (2017) 17:814 

Page 14 of 16

there is discrimination due to low proficiency in the na-
tional language, and/or because of race or accent, and
that there is a need for culturally appropriate healthcare
improvements. Furthermore, knowledge regarding the
healthcare system of the host country is generally poor
and more information about it needs to be provided to
the refugees.

In several of the included studies, the authors con-
clude that the refugees and asylum seekers need to be
given more information about their rights to healthcare,
as well as about the healthcare system itself [24, 27–30,
34], while in only two of the included studies the partici-
pants report receipt of such information [32, 33]. In the
Swedish study by Wångdahl [27], 30% of the participants
did not fully understand what they were being told. This
could affect the refugees’ access to healthcare, and re-
duce their autonomy in informed decision-making con-
cerning their own healthcare [27]. The need for refugees
to have proper and effective communication with the
healthcare segment is urgent, since they are at a greater
risk of suffering from poor physical and mental health
[8–10], with increased morbidity and mortality rates in
comparison to the rest of the host country population
[49]. Vulnerable populations, such as the refugees, often
have significant difficulties with health literacy and are
therefore challenged by intercultural communication
barriers when accessing and making sense of relevant
health information. Therefore,
these consumers are
often misinformed about healthcare services, disease
prevention practices and early detection guidelines,
which could lead to serious health errors and health
problems [49].

A number of the included studies express difficulties
concerning interpretation—with finding an interpreter,
the confidentiality of using an interpreter, as well as with
the quality of the interpretation [24, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37–
40]. Ngo-Metzger et al. [50] found that if the consumers
of care did not have interpreters present at the health-
care appointment, this meant that they received signifi-
cantly less health education. Furthermore, even the
patients that used an interpreter rated their care pro-
vider fair or poor, in comparison to those that knew the
native language. Ngo-Metzger et al. [50] concluded that
for patients with another native language it is of great
importance to have an interpreter, but that having an in-
terpreter may not completely ameliorate the language
barrier that exist and may interfere with the patient-
provider relationship.

Some of the included studies further show there is a
need for a more culturally appropriate healthcare for ref-
ugees and asylum seekers [24, 37, 39, 44]. These studies
found that culturally appropriate care is needed for sev-
eral reasons: 1) to address cultural differences concern-
ing symptomologies, diagnoses and medical terminology

[37], 2) to increase the understanding of cultural differ-
ences [24], 3) to increase the understanding of the health
examination system in the West [44] and 4) to develop
culturally appropriate health promotion in order to help
with necessary lifestyle changes [39]. Cultural compe-
tence could be viewed as a critical factor and an essential
component for providing relevant, effective and cultur-
ally responsive healthcare services to an increasingly di-
verse population worldwide. Even though cultural
competence alone is not sufficient for reducing all health
and healthcare disparities, it nevertheless remains one of
the most significant tools when it comes to addressing
health disparities in society [51]. However, cultural
awareness within healthcare requires genuine efforts to
be made for cultural barriers to be understood—through
engagement in the community, as well as through work-
ing closely with members of the community in order to
address these barriers [52]. If cultural safety principles
are incorporated into healthcare practices and research,
then health structures may shift to resist dominant views
of culturally and socially heterogeneous groups [37].

In this scoping review a total of 26 studies were in-
cluded representing 10 different countries around the
world, with a higher representation from the countries
of Canada, United States, Australia and the United King-
dom. It is important that similar studies are conducted
in more countries, to obtain a better picture of the ex-
tent to which healthcare is appropriate and positively
evaluated by the refugees worldwide. The next step
would be to acquire more specific knowledge about the
experiences of the different refugee ethnic groups, for
then healthcare systems could tailor their services even
further to address the unique health needs of these spe-
cific groups, and would thus be able to provide genuine
culturally appropriate healthcare [53].

In a number of the studies included in this review, the
refugees perceived healthcare professionals to be support-
ive towards them [23, 24, 29, 30, 33, 38, 41, 42, 45], al-
though in a few of the studies the participants were less
content and satisfied with these encounters [28, 37, 40, 42
43]. Since this group of people tends to suffer more from
poor physical and mental health, and since they also strug-
gle with resettlement challenges [54], it is of importance
for health professionals to support them when they come
for a wide variety of reasons into healthcare settings. In
order to ensure quality healthcare services, it is important
that the GPs themselves are supported through profes-
sional development in refugee health, so that they are en-
abled to provide appropriate and suitable care for a group
of people with complex health issues [55].

Strengths and limitations
This review has a broad scope and attempts to draw a
refugees have with the
picture of

the experiences

Page 15 of 16

healthcare sector in their host country. One limitation is
that the scope may not be broad enough, since only sci-
entific papers were included. A complete search has not
been done and, as this is a scoping review, we did not
conduct a quality assessment of the reviewed studies.
Thus, the results should be interpreted with some cau-
tion. Additional search terms, search blocks, or inclusion
and exclusion criteria could have been used, although
the range of the study and its results would then have
been different. Systematic searches have been carried
out in three databases that are primarily used for med-
ical and nursing research [56]. Some duplicates were
found in the three databases, which suggests that the
search breadth was wide enough. Previous work experi-
ence of the authors within the field of both immigration
and healthcare, as well as experience of performing sys-
temic searches, strengthen this study. The fact that the
inclusion and exclusion criteria have been firmly set
from the beginning and were followed closely and
strictly throughout the data collection process could be
seen as an asset to this study. Only English language
sources were retrieved and reviewed. Literature on this
topic may very well have been produced in other lan-
guages, and could therefore be missing in this present
review. However, there is very little literature that is not
written in English cited in the papers reviewed thus far,
which indicates that the most important sources for this
topic may be available primarily in English.

Conclusions
The aim of this review was to compile research about
the experiences that refugees have with healthcare sec-
tors in their host countries. The review concluded that
insufficient language knowledge is perceived as a com-
munication barrier, that the refugees are lacking infor-
mation both regarding the healthcare system itself and
their right to access it in the host countries. Support
given by the health professionals is of great importance
for a positive encounter with healthcare, and there is a
need for improvement when it comes to provision of
culturally appropriate healthcare. Since refugees are at a
greater risk of suffering from poor mental and physical
health, and therefore have higher morbidity and mortal-
ity rates in comparison to the rest of the host country
population, there is an urgent need for improvements to
be made in communication, interpretation, support and
deliverance of culturally appropriate healthcare.
