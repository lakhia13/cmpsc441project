Psychology since World War II has been largely devoted to repairing weakness and understanding suffering.
Towards that end, we have made considerable gains. We have a classification of mental illness that allows
international collaboration, and through this collaboration we have developed effective psychotherapeutic or
pharmacological treatments for 14 major mental disorders. However, while building a strong science and
practice of treating mental illness, we largely forgot about everyday well-being. Is the absence of mental
illness and suffering sufficient to let individuals and communities flourish? Were all disabling conditions to
disappear, what would make life worth living? Those committed to a science of positive psychology can draw
on the effective research methods developed to understand and treat mental illness. Results from a new
randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrate that people are happier and less depressed three months
after completing exercises targeting positive emotion. The ultimate goal of positive psychology is to make
people happier by understanding and building positive emotion, gratification and meaning. Towards this
end, we must supplement what we know about treating illness and repairing damage with knowledge about
nurturing well-being in individuals and communities.

1. A BALANCED PSYCHOLOGY
American psychology before World War II had three objec-
tives: the first was to cure mental illness, the second was to
make relatively untroubled people happier, and the third
was to study genius and high talent. All but the first fell by
the wayside after the war. Researchers turned to the study
of mental disorders because that was where the funding
was. The biggest grants were coming from the newly foun-
ded National Institute of Mental Health, whose purpose
was to support research on mental
illness, not mental
health. At the same time, practitioners suddenly became
able to earn a good living treating mental illness as a result
of the Veterans Administration Act of 1946. Psycho-
pathology became a primary focus of psychology in
America because it made sense at that time. Many very
distressed people were left in the wake of World War II,
and the high incidence of mental disorders had become a
pressing and immediate problem.

A wealth of excellent research resulted from this chain of
events. In 1946, there were no effective treatments for any
of the psychological disorders, whereas now we can cure
two and treat another 12 via psychotherapy and/or pharma-
cology (Seligman 1993). Furthermore, the intensive study
of psychopathology has given rise to methods of classifying
the mental disorders (International classification of diseases,
9th edition, and Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
disorders, 4th edition), and these methods have allowed
clinical psychologists to produce diagnoses with acceptable
accuracy, and to reliably measure symptoms that were once

quite difficult to pinpoint. After 50 years and 30 billion
dollars of research, psychologists and psychiatrists can boast
that we are now able to make troubled people less miserable,
and that is surely a significant scientific accomplishment.

The downside of this accomplishment is that a 50-year
focus on disease and pathology has taken its toll on society
and on science. In our efforts to fix the worst problems that
people face, we have forgotten about the rest of our mission
as psychologists. Approximately 30% of people in the USA
suffer from a severe mental disorder at one time or another
(Kessler et al. 1994) and we have done an excellent job of
helping that 30%. It is time now to turn to the other 70%.
Although these people may not be experiencing severe
pathology, there is good evidence to indicate that the
absence of maladies does not constitute happiness (Diener
& Lucas 2000). Even if we were asymptotically successful
at removing depression, anxiety and anger, that would
not result in happiness. For we believe ‘happiness’ is a
condition over and above the absence of unhappiness.

That said, we know very little about how to improve the
lives of the people whose days are largely free of overt
mental dysfunction but are bereft of pleasure, engagement
and meaning. We do not know much about what makes a
person optimistic, kind, giving, content, engaged, purpos-
ive or brilliant. To address this, the first author proposed,
during his term as President of the American Psychological
Association in 1998, that psychology be just as concerned
with what is right with people as it is with what is wrong. As
a supplement to the vast research on the disorders and
their treatment, we suggest that there should be an equally
thorough study of strengths and virtues, and that we should
work towards developing interventions that can help
people become lastingly happier.

2. WHAT IS HAPPINESS?
Towards this goal, our first order of business is to determine
what it is we were trying to increase. What is happiness?
More words have been written about this great philosophi-
cal question than perhaps any other. Science can no more
presume to answer this question than other classic philo-
sophical questions, such as ‘what is the meaning of life’? But
science can illuminate components of happiness and inves-
tigate empirically what builds those components. With that
said, a review of the literature led us to identify three con-
stituents of happiness: (i) pleasure (or positive emotion);
(ii) engagement; and (iii) meaning. We define these three
routes to happiness in the paragraphs that follow.

The first route to greater happiness is hedonic, increasing
positive emotion. When people refer in casual conversation
to being happy, they are often referring to this route. Within
limits, we can increase our positive emotion about the past
(e.g. by cultivating gratitude and forgiveness), our positive
emotion about the present (e.g. by savouring and mind-
fulness) and our positive emotion about the future (e.g. by
building hope and optimism). However, unlike the other
two routes to happiness, the route relying on positive emo-
tions has clear limits. Positive affectivity is heritable, and we
speculate that, for important evolutionary reasons, our
emotions fluctuate within a genetically determined range. It
is possible (and worthwhile) to increase the amount of posi-
tive emotion in our lives, but we can boost our hedonics
only so high. Further, when people fluctuate within a rela-
tively ‘down’ range of positive emotion, but live in a society
like the USA that promotes an upbeat disposition, they can
feel discouraged and even defective. Fortunately, positive
emotion is not the sole determinant of happiness, and our
most liberating goal is to offer a broader conception of hap-
piness than mere hedonics (Seligman 2002).

A second route to happiness involves the pursuit of
‘gratification’. The key characteristic of a gratification is
that it engages us fully. It absorbs us. Individuals may find
gratification in participating in a great conversation, fixing
a bike, reading a good book, teaching a child, playing the
guitar or accomplishing a difficult task at work. We can
take shortcuts to pleasures (e.g. eating ice cream, mas-
turbating, having a massage or using drugs), but no short-
cuts exist to gratification. We must involve ourselves fully,
and the pursuit of gratifications requires us to draw on
character strengths such as creativity, social intelligence,
sense of humour, perseverance, and an appreciation of
beauty and excellence.

Although gratifications are activities that may be enjoy-
able, they are not necessarily accompanied by positive emo-
tions. We may say afterwards that the concert was ‘fun’, but
what we mean is that during it, we were one with music,
undistracted by thought or emotion. Indeed, the pursuit of
a gratification may be, at times, unpleasant. Consider, for
example, the gratification that comes from training for an
endurance event such as a marathon. At any given point
during the gruelling event, a runner may be discouraged or
exhausted or even in physical pain; however, they may
describe the overall experience as intensely gratifying.

Finding flow in gratifications need not involve anything
larger than the self. Although the pursuit of gratifications
involves deploying our strengths, a third route to happiness
comes from using these strengths to belong to and in the
service of something larger than ourselves; something such

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)

as knowledge, goodness, family, community, politics, jus-
tice or a higher spiritual power. The third route gives life
meaning. It satisfies a longing for purpose in life and is the
antidote to a ‘fidgeting until we die’ syndrome.

Peterson et al. (2005) develop reliable measures for all
three routes to happiness and demonstrate that people dif-
fer in their tendency to rely on one rather than another. We
call a tendency to pursue happiness by boosting positive
emotion, ‘the pleasant life’; the tendency to pursue happi-
ness via the gratifications, ‘the good life’; and the tendency
to pursue happiness via using our strengths towards some-
thing larger than ourselves, ‘the meaningful life’. A person
who uses all three routes to happiness leads the ‘full life’,
and recent empirical evidence suggests that those who lead
the full life have much the greater life satisfaction (Peterson
et al. 2005).

3. INTERVENTIONS TO NURTURE HAPPINESS?
We have designed and tested interventions to nurture each
of the three routes to happiness (pleasure, gratification and
meaning). Positive emotions are increased and the pleasant
life is promoted by exercises that increase gratitude, that
increase savouring, that build optimism and that challenge
discouraging beliefs about the past. Interventions that
increase the good life identify participants’ signature
strengths and use them more often and in creative new ways.
Meaningful
life interventions aim toward participants’
identifying and connecting with something larger than
themselves by using their signature strengths. Some of these
interventions can be found at www.authentichappiness.org.
We are in the process of testing the efficacy of these inter-
ventions by randomly assigning individuals to interventions
or to a placebo control, and measuring their level of happi-
ness and depression before the intervention, immediately
after it, 1 week later, one month later, and three months
later. Early results demonstrate that (i) it is possible to
boost individuals’ levels of happiness, and (ii) these effects
do not fade immediately after the intervention (as is the
case with the placebo). The ‘good things in life’ exercise
provides an example of an efficacious
intervention.
Designed to increase positive emotion about the past, this
exercise requires individuals to record, every day for a
week, three good things that happened to them each day
and why those good things occurred. After completing this
exercise, individuals were happier and less depressed at the
three-month follow-up (Seligman & Steen 2005). Note
that these research designs are exactly parallel to the
random-assignment, placebo-controlled experiments that
are the bulwark of the medication and psychotherapy
outcome literature, except that the intervention is targeted
to increase happiness rather just to decrease suffering.

Our research places us among a growing number of posi-
tive psychologists who are committed to understanding
and cultivating those factors that nurture human flourish-
ing, and we are encouraged that the field of positive
psychology seems to be thriving as well. Researchers who
were studying positive strengths, emotions and institutions
long before the term ‘positive psychology’ was coined are
receiving increased recognition and support for their work,
while young researchers worldwide can apply for research
and intellectual support via positive psychology research
awards and conferences.

One reason for optimism that the field of positive psy-
chology may make substantial gains in the next several
years is that it does not start from square one. Rather, it
draws on the proven methodologies that advanced the
understanding and treatment of the mental illnesses. When
it is no longer necessary to make distinctions between ‘posi-
tive psychology’ and ‘psychology as usual’, the field as a
whole will be more representative of the human experience.
Our goal is an integrated, balanced field that integrates
research on positive states and traits with research on suf-
fering and pathology. We are committed to a psychology
that concerns itself with repairing weakness as well as nur-
turing strengths, a psychology that concerns itself with
remedying deficits as well as promoting excellence, and a
psychology that concerns itself with reducing that which
diminishes life as well as building that which makes life
worth living. We are committed to a balanced psychology.
