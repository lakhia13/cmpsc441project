Alcohol Use Disorder and 
Antisocial and Borderline 
Personality Disorders

Ashley C. Helle, Ashley L. Watts, Timothy J. Trull, and Kenneth J. Sher

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) frequently co-occurs with other psychiatric 
disorders, including personality disorders, which are pervasive, persistent, 
and impairing. Personality disorders are associated with myriad serious 
outcomes, have a high degree of co-occurrence with substance use 
disorders, including AUD, and incur significant health care costs. This 
literature review focuses on co-occurring AUD and personality disorders 
characterized by impulsivity and affective dysregulation, specifically 
antisocial personality disorders and borderline personality disorders. 
Prevalence  rates,  potential  explanations  and  causal  models  of 
co-occurrence, prognoses, and the status of existing treatment research 
are summarized. Several important future research considerations are 
relevant to these complex, co-occurring conditions. Research assessing 
mechanisms responsible for co-occurring AUD and antisocial personality 
disorder or borderline personality disorder will further delineate the 
underlying developmental processes and improve understanding of 
onset and courses. In addition, increased focus on the efficacy and 
effectiveness of treatments targeting underlying traits or common factors 
in these disorders will inform future prevention and treatment efforts, as 
interventions targeting these co-occurring conditions have relatively 
little empirical support.

Introduction

The quest to understand the etiology, course, and treatment of alcohol 
use disorder (AUD) has given rise to an extensive body of work on 
identifying factors that contribute to these phenomena. Many of these 
factors, such as temperament and personality traits, are common to 
multiple psychiatric conditions, and some, such as variants of alcohol 
metabolizing genes, are specific to AUD. This review describes the 
co-occurrence of AUD with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and 
borderline personality disorder (BPD). The prevalence and effects of

ALCOHOL RESEARCHCurrent Reviewsthese personality disorders, their co-occurrence with 
AUD through the lens of several current models, 
and the treatment and overall implications of these 
complex co-occurrences are discussed.

The conceptualization and diagnostic criteria for 
AUD has evolved over the years and through editions 
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM). For example, in the text revision 
of the fourth edition of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR) 
the conceptualization included alcohol abuse 
and dependence, which were categories that 
comprised two different symptom sets and required 
a number of criteria for diagnosis.1 More recent 
conceptualizations of AUD are seen in the fifth 
edition of the DSM (DSM-5), which describes AUD 
as a single disorder with 11 criteria and includes a 
severity gradient designated by the number of criteria 
met (e.g., two to three symptoms constitute mild 
AUD).2 Although this conceptualization inherently 
is still categorical, the changes are consistent with 
a transition toward dimensional approaches (e.g., 
severity can be graded across one set of symptoms).3 
Additional work needs to be done to capture a fully 
dimensional diagnosis for AUD.

Other diagnostic systems, such as the 

11th revision of the International Classification 
of Diseases (ICD-11), have implemented new 
conceptualizations of AUD that differ from the 
alcohol abuse and dependence categories and that 
attempt to capture potential features of severity (e.g., 
harmful use diagnosis and recurrent problems).4 
Note that many of the studies reported in this 
review focus on previous DSM conceptualizations 
of AUD, such as the categories of alcohol abuse 
and dependence from the DSM-IV-TR. In 
addition, much of the work described here 
conceptualizes AUD as a categorical diagnosis, 
either present or absent, although support for a 
categorical AUD taxonomy is declining.1 Differing 
AUD conceptualizations may affect the general 
consensus of research findings.

Personality disorder diagnoses and, more 

generally, psychopathology are migrating toward 
a dimensional classification system. For example, 
the ICD-11 includes a dimensional approach to 
personality disorder diagnosis.4 For classifying 
personality disorders, there has been a call for and 
transition to dimensional approaches, and a number 
of the proposed models largely align with robust 
and well-validated models of personality.5-8 The 

e2 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

DSM-IV-TR personality disorder categories were 
retained in the DSM-5, but the DSM-5 (Section III: 
Emerging Measures and Models) proposes a new 
model that integrates dimensional aspects (e.g., 
dimensional personality traits) into a more 
traditional categorical classification model.2 This 
hybrid categorical-dimensional model, the alternative 
DSM-5 model for personality disorders, is described 
in more detail in the following section.

Personality Disorders

Although the long-standing research aimed at 
identifying an “alcoholic personality”9 has not been 
particularly fruitful, these efforts have nevertheless 
identified some personality traits, or constellations 
thereof, that are associated with increased risk for 
alcohol use and misuse. ASPD and BPD, both 
characterized by impulsivity, negative emotionality, 
and antagonism, are two such constellations. 
This review focuses on ASPD and BPD; however, 
personality disorders in general are the focus of some 
research presented and are noted throughout.

ASPD is characterized by behavior patterns that 
show a lack of regard for and violation of the rights 
of others, deceit, manipulation, and impulsivity 
that have occurred since age 15, in addition to 
evidence of conduct disorder before age 15.2 
BPD is conceptualized as a disorder of emotion 
dysregulation, impulsivity, suicidality, identity 
disturbance, and difficulties in interpersonal 
relationships. Although the DSM-5 classifies 
personality disorders categorically, the DSM-5 
alternative, hybrid dimensional-categorical 
model of personality disorder describes these 
disorders in terms of broad personality domains 
(negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, 
disinhibition, and psychoticism) and facets that are 
largely consistent with popular models of general 
personality, namely the five-factor model (see the 
section Trait Explanations for a detailed explanation 
of this model).5 Individual personality disorders 
such as BPD are then characterized by specific 
traits, resulting in a hybrid model that describes the 
disorders in terms of both dimensional trait features 
(e.g., disinhibition) and categories (e.g., BPD).
Within the alternative DSM-5 model for 

personality disorders, ASPD and BPD are 
characterized by high levels of disinhibition, 

with BPD additionally associated with high levels 
of negative affectivity, and ASPD additionally 
associated with high levels of antagonism. The 
ICD-11 conceptualizes personality disorders 
in a manner similar to the DSM-5 alternative 
model, such that dimensional traits (e.g., negative 
affectivity and disinhibition) are included in the 
diagnosis.4 Further, in the ICD-11, these traits 
accompany a general diagnosis for mild, moderate, 
or severe personality disorder.

Prevalence

Epidemiological, community, and clinical 
psychiatric samples across all 10 categorical 
personality disorders have yielded prevalences 
ranging from 9% to 21% in community 
(nonclinical) samples10 to approximately 31% 
in psychiatric outpatient samples,11 with many 
individuals receiving diagnoses of more than one 
personality disorder. Across epidemiological studies, 
community prevalences for ASPD and BPD, 
individually, range from 1% to 4% and 1% to 6%, 
respectively.10

ASPD and BPD manifest in a broad array of 

maladaptive behaviors, including suicide, self-
harm, aggression, criminal behavior, and substance 
misuse. Moreover, ASPD and BPD are associated 
with profound economic costs.12-15 ASPD is 
associated with criminal offenses, with ASPD 
prevalence as large as 60% in prison populations,12 
and BPD is associated with higher suicide rates 
than those among the general population.13 Both 
conditions are associated with higher rates of 
chronic illness, sleep disturbances, and health 
care utilization when compared to rates among 
individuals with no diagnosis of personality 
disorder.14,15 Evidence shows that ASPD and BPD 
are related, and that they are serious psychiatric 
disorders associated with significant consequences, 
including consequences undergirded by poor 
emotional and behavioral control (e.g., excessive 
alcohol use), making the disorders likely to co-
occur with AUD.

Diagnosis limitations and considerations

Because the literature on co-occurrence is largely 
based on categorical diagnoses, the limitations and 
biases of the current diagnosis classification system 

for personality disorders should be considered. 
A few well-documented limitations include lack 
of coverage of an individual’s presenting concerns 
within the existing personality disorders, an 
arbitrary number of symptoms required for a 
diagnosis, large variation of presentation and 
symptoms within each personality disorder, 
and high co-occurrence of personality disorder 
categories.7 Although substantial evidence 
supports dimensional as opposed to categorical 
conceptualizations of personality disorders, such as 
the five-factor model and the DSM-5 alternative 
model for personality disorders,6 the current 
exploration of co-occurrence inherently relies on 
categorical diagnoses.16

Consequently, some apparent co-occurrence may 

be misleading because of overlapping features and 
aspects of diagnostic bias. Moreover, subthreshold 
levels of alcohol or personality pathology, such 
as binge drinking and impulsivity, which are 
not diagnostic categories, may co-occur before 
co-occurring alcohol and personality disorders 
can be detected. Thus, an association between 
personality disorders and AUD may manifest 
before formal diagnoses of either condition and 
may occur at varying levels of pathology. These 
factors should be considered when examining the 
conceptualization and diagnosis of co-occurring 
AUD and personality disorders.

Epidemiology of Co-Occurring AUD 
and Personality Disorders

Data from large epidemiological studies of 
psychopathology highlight the intertwined 
nature of AUD and personality disorders. In the 
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and 
Related Conditions (NESARC), which was a large, 
population-based study, 42% of participants who 
met the diagnostic criteria for any personality 
disorder also met the criteria for DSM-IV alcohol 
dependence.10 Diagnostic co-occurrence tended 
to be most pronounced for Cluster B personality 
disorders, particularly ASPD and BPD, which 
are characterized by disinhibited and antagonistic 
forms of externalizing traits and behaviors. Recent 
reviews have indicated that of those individuals 
who met diagnostic criteria for BPD, 46% to 49% 

Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders | e3 

also met diagnostic criteria for current AUD, and 
59% met diagnostic criteria for lifetime AUD.17 
The prevalence of AUD among those diagnosed 
with ASPD was about 68%.18 Among the general 
population or clinical samples of individuals 
with a current diagnosis of AUD or alcohol 
dependence, the prevalence of a BPD diagnosis was 
approximately 12% to 17%.17 Among individuals 
with an AUD diagnosis, especially clinical samples, 
ASPD diagnoses were slightly more prevalent than 
BPD diagnoses, ranging from 19% to 22%.18 
Overall, AUD and ASPD and BPD overlap to a 
high degree.

Nevertheless, it is important to consider 
co-occurrence estimates in the context of their 
sampling limitations and interpretive challenges. 
For instance, many studies that establish 
populationwide estimates are cross-sectional, which 
precludes investigating the temporal relations 
among onset of AUD and personality disorders. 
Moreover, epidemiological data tend to rely on 
retrospective self-reports and lifetime diagnoses, 
which may be influenced by an individual’s current 
emotional state (e.g., momentary affect) and 
general personality traits (e.g., level of negative 
emotionality).

In addition, when assessing for AUD, 

interviewers ask about the various consequences 
of alcohol use. In practice, establishing alcohol 
as a cause or contributor to a criterion (e.g., 
hazardous use) can be extremely challenging, 
but the assumption that alcohol played a causal 
or consequential role is often the default.19 For 
example, if an individual routinely drinks while 
driving, is this behavior best understood as 
caused by AUD or by a more general pattern 
of rule-breaking and risky behavior? Therefore, 
some ostensible co-occurrence could be due to 
imprecision in the diagnostic criteria and how 
those criteria are assessed.

Explanations and Models of 
Co-Occurrence

Relevant to developing effective treatment and 
prevention are the mechanisms responsible for 
co-occurring AUD and personality disorders, 
that is, how or why personality disorders relate to 

e4 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

AUDs. Explanations or models of co-occurring 
AUD and ASPD or BPD include common third-
variable (e.g., trait) explanations and causal (e.g., 
AUD leads to personality disorder or personality 
disorder leads to AUD) explanations.

Trait explanations

Meta-analytic research suggests that personality 
disorders can be conceptualized as combinations, 
or even configurations, of extreme variants of 
general personality traits, which often are based 
on or correspond with the five-factor model.8 
The five-factor model encompasses the broad 
personality domains of neuroticism, extraversion, 
openness to experience, agreeableness, and 
conscientiousness, each of which includes narrower 
traits, termed “facets.” Five-factor model domains 
and facets are dimensional, such that variability in 
personality lies on a continuum, with each pole 
reflecting an extreme of a basic trait. For simplicity, 
the two poles are described as high and low. For 
example, social cooperativeness and affiliation 
reflect high agreeableness, which is the opposite 
pole of antagonism. ASPD and BPD reflect low 
levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness 
and high levels of antagonism and impulsivity, 
respectively. ASPD and BPD have key associations 
with neuroticism and extraversion, although 
the personality trait associations are different for 
each disorder. BPD is characterized by high levels 
of neuroticism, whereas ASPD is not robustly 
associated with neuroticism but is characterized by 
high levels of two of neuroticism’s facets: anger and 
impulsiveness. ASPD is characterized by high levels 
of the excitement-seeking facet of extraversion, 
whereas BPD is characterized by low levels of 
the warmth and positive emotionality facets 
of extraversion.

From a trait perspective, BPD and ASPD tend 
to relate similarly to AUD. This similarity can be 
explained by their overlapping profiles of general 
personality traits, particularly antagonism and 
impulsivity (disinhibition).8 Although AUD 
often is conceptualized as an episodic condition 
rather than a chronic (trait-like) condition, it 
is increasingly apparent that AUD is related to 
several personality traits, and that these traits are 
similar to the traits that undergird ASPD, BPD, 
and other psychopathology in general. Trull 

and Sher first established that alcohol abuse and 
dependence were characterized by high levels of 
neuroticism and low levels of agreeableness and 
conscientiousness.20 Even with no diagnosis of 
AUD, features or patterns of alcohol use (e.g., 
ever using alcohol, quantity of alcohol use, and 
problematic use of alcohol) have been characterized 
by the same general personality traits (e.g., low 
conscientiousness).21

Of note, typologies for AUD have shown similar 

patterns of personality dimensions. Cloninger 
conceptualized two subtypes of AUD.22 Type I 
had later onset (after age 25) and was associated 
with more anxious rather than impulsive features. 
Type II was more common in men and represented 
individuals who had early onset of alcohol use 
and frequent aggressive behaviors or arrests. 
Cloninger examined Type II AUD22 and ASPD23 
separately and posited that they both had high 
novelty-seeking, low harm avoidance, and low 
reward dependence. This literature converges 
evidence that AUD on one hand and BPD and 
ASPD on the other have comparable relationships 
with general personality traits. Personality traits 
associated with aggressive, impulsive, and neurotic 
tendencies coalesce into the trait complexes of 
ASPD and BPD. These same trait complexes may 
contribute to a broad swath of externalizing forms 
of psychopathology, including alcohol and other 
substance misuse, risky sex, and other antisocial 
behavior.24,25

Developmental explanations

Adolescence and emerging adulthood are crucial 
developmental periods for understanding the 
sources and trajectory of AUD. In addition 
to being a period of heightened alcohol use,26 
adolescence tends to be associated with increased 
independence and acquisition of adult roles, 
exploration, and reward-seeking, as well as 
heightened levels of impulsivity, sensation-seeking, 
and, to a lesser extent, neuroticism.27 Declines 
in alcohol use and reductions in personality 
trait levels across development have been called 
“maturing out”28 and the “maturity principle,”29 
respectively. For example, late adolescence and 
emerging adulthood are associated with heightened 
prevalence of alcohol use and associated problems, 
the risk for which tends to decline with age. 

Although personality traits are believed to reflect a 
person’s stable, internal disposition,30 the transition 
from emerging to young adulthood is associated 
with normative changes in personality that reflect 
development toward psychological maturity, such 
as increases in emotional stability, self-control, 
and affiliation, and a shift to adult roles, such as 
committed relationships and parenthood.27
Researchers have empirically linked these 

developmental changes in personality and alcohol 
use.31-33 Specifically, changes in impulsivity, 
neuroticism, and problematic alcohol use tend to 
correlate. Across adolescence and early adulthood, 
individuals with steeper declines in impulsivity 
and neuroticism demonstrated steeper declines 
in problematic alcohol use.33 Individuals with a 
less substantial decline (or even an increase) in 
impulsivity and neuroticism had either increases, 
or smaller decreases, in problematic alcohol use. 
In the same vein, increases in risk-taking behavior 
across development are associated with increases 
in alcohol use among adolescents.34,35 Still, 
there are individual differences in these general 
developmental trends, and some research suggests 
that personality may moderate AUD trajectories 
such that individuals who exhibit more impulsivity 
and neuroticism are more likely to experience 
more severe or chronic problems with alcohol. 
Relatedly, other research suggests variability in the 
developmental course of personality and alcohol 
use. Some individuals do not exhibit the maturity 
principle or mature out of alcohol use and instead 
exhibit chronic and stable alcohol, emotional, and 
behavioral control issues.36,37

Causal models

At least four major co-occurrence models, each of 
which contains different assumptions, explain how 
AUD relates to ASPD and BPD: the predisposition 
(or vulnerability) model, the complication (or scar) 
model, the exacerbation model, and the spectrum 
model.38 The predisposition model purports that 
existing personality disorder elicits environmental 
responses, such as interpersonal or occupational 
problems, that provoke the onset of AUD. The 
temporal relationship between AUD and ASPD 
or BPD is reversed in the complication model, 
whereby AUD “scars” an individual’s personality. 
For instance, neuroadaptation due to excessive 

Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders | e5 

alcohol consumption across time might result in 
increased impulsivity or negative emotionality. The 
exacerbation model purports that ASPD and BPD 
add to or modify the manifestation, course, or 
expression of AUD, resulting in a distinctive AUD 
symptom profile. For instance, the presence of ASPD 
or BPD might increase the longevity of AUD or the 
extent of impairment. The spectrum model posits 
that the two disorders share common etiology.
Unfortunately, there is a relative paucity of 

empirical data for comparing these causal models. 
Existing data tend to support the predisposition 
model, in which the personality traits that undergird 
ASPD or BPD, particularly impulsivity, novelty-
seeking, and neuroticism, tend to predict later 
alcohol problems, including AUD diagnosis39 
and onset.40 Tracing the prospective, longitudinal 
relationships between impulsivity, neuroticism, 
and AUD across adolescence, Elkins and colleagues 
demonstrated that, after accounting for preexisting 
AUD, impulsivity and negative emotionality 
uniquely predicted new onset of AUD at age 20 
after a baseline at age 17.40

Still other research suggests that personality 

may contribute to AUD by means of “niche-
picking,” whereby those with higher levels of certain 
personality traits select into high-risk environments 
for AUD. Park and colleagues found that 
undergraduates who scored highly on extraversion, 
despite not drinking heavily before college, were 
more likely to enter into the Greek system and thus 
were at increased risk for alcohol problems later in 
college.41 Novelty-seeking (a facet of extraversion) 
also has been shown to have a proximal association 
with alcohol use, such that enhancement motives for 
drinking (to “get high” or enhance positive affect) 
were associated with sensation-seeking.42 Together, 
these findings suggest that traits associated with 
ASPD and BPD, namely impulsivity and negative 
emotionality, appear to reflect broad liability for 
precocious alcohol use and AUD. Other traits 
associated with ASPD, namely novelty-seeking, 
tend to be associated with AUD both directly and 
indirectly by influencing selection into high-risk 
environments and motives for drinking.

The exacerbation model has some limited support, 
in that individuals with higher levels of outgoingness, 
impulsivity, aggression, and antisociality have been 
shown to be more likely to experience reinforcing, 
stress-dampening effects of alcohol.43 The 

e6 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

complication model also has some limited support, 
as demonstrated by research in which chronic, 
heavy-drinking adolescents exhibited short-term 
(1 year) increases in impulsive behavior.35 Research 
also has implicated alcohol use as a predictor of 
aggressive and violent behavior.24

Of note, the temporal relatedness of alcohol 
use to changes in personality is relevant, such that 
“proximal, but not necessarily distal, alcohol use 
influences subsequent changes in personality.”44(p363) 
Barnes wrote about the directionality of these 
relationships, noting that neuroticism tended to 
increase from “prealcoholic” to “clinical alcoholism,” 
suggesting that such a change in personality may be a 
result of heavy or chronic drinking.45

The increase in neuroticism as alcohol use 
progresses aligns with neurobiological models of 
addiction, such as the allostatic model. This model 
posits that as addiction and compulsion for a 
substance progresses, negative affect increases in 
the absence of the substance, thereby contributing 
to substance use as negative reinforcement and 
becoming a continuing cyclical process.46 The result 
is progressive allostatic changes of less positive 
and more negative mood. The persistence and 
reversibility of such presumed allostatic effects in the 
absence of continued heavy drinking is unclear.45 
Together, these findings highlight the intertwined, 
bidirectional connections between AUD and 
personality disorders, which likely cannot be 
described by one causal model.

The predisposition, complication, and 

exacerbation models presume independent etiology 
and onset of AUD and personality disorders. The 
spectrum model, in contrast, contains two major 
assumptions: Personality disorders and AUD are 
not distinct and rise, at least in part, from a set 
of common etiological factors. In addition, each 
disorder exists on a continuum or comprises multiple 
components along a continuum, ranging from 
subclinical traits to full-blown psychopathology. 
This model has received considerable support and 
also has historical roots. Cloninger first proposed 
that personality mediated genetic risk for AUD,23 a 
theory that Slutske and colleagues later instantiated 
empirically.47 Using a multivariate behavioral genetic 
twin design, these researchers found that the genetic 
variance associated with the broad trait of behavioral 
undercontrol, which included impulsivity, novelty-
seeking, and aggression, accounted for 40% of 

the genetic variance in alcohol dependence. These 
findings highlight the notion that the overlap of 
impulsivity and AUD originates from shared genetic 
mechanisms. Other work has demonstrated the same 
for AUD and BPD.48 This shared genetic mechanism 
appears to give rise to externalizing behavior and 
psychopathology generally,25 including AUD, other 
substance use disorder (SUD), conduct disorder, and 
antisocial behavior, rather than to impulsivity and 
AUD specifically.

These findings align with burgeoning evidence 
that internalizing and externalizing are two broad, 
heritable spectra of psychopathology. Internalizing 
is characterized by elevated negative emotionality, 
and externalizing is characterized by behavioral 
undercontrol and novelty-seeking. These two spectra 
are responsible for well-documented co-occurrence of 
psychiatric conditions that share phenomenological 
similarities.49,50

Contemporary taxonomies organize 

psychopathology dimensionally and hierarchically, 
with signs and symptoms of psychiatric conditions 
at the bottom of the hierarchy and externalizing 
and internalizing toward the top.51 Much research 
places AUD, ASPD, and BPD squarely within 
externalizing. Externalizing can be broken 
down into disinhibited and antagonistic forms. 
Disinhibited externalizing comprises all substance-
related disorders, whereas antagonistic externalizing 
comprises BPD as well as narcissistic, histrionic, 
and paranoid personality disorders. Notably, 
an antisocial behavior subfactor is believed to 
contribute to both the disinhibited and antagonistic 
externalizing subspectra and includes ASPD, conduct 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intermittent 
explosive disorder. Some research suggests that BPD 
contributes to both externalizing and internalizing 
spectra,52 although this possibility warrants more 
research attention.

Tully and Iacono proposed a hierarchical common 

liabilities model, which suggests that disorders 
(e.g., SUD and ASPD) that load onto the same 
psychopathology spectrum (e.g., externalizing) 
share common etiologic mechanisms.50 As noted 
previously, a significant amount of evidence 
demonstrates that genes influence the covariation 
among disorders within externalizing and 
internalizing spectra, likely because of the common 
neurobiological mechanisms within each spectrum. 

These researchers offered that neurobiological 
mechanisms responsible for behavioral control and 
negative emotionality give rise to externalizing and 
internalizing, respectively, and likely are responsible 
for the co-occurrence among AUD, ASPD, and 
BPD. Specific genetic and other neurobiological 
mechanisms responsible for the development of 
AUD, ASPD, and BPD remain elusive. Further 
research is needed to identify more specific 
neurobiological mechanisms and biologically based 
endophenotypes implicated in the covariation among 
AUD, ASPD, and BPD, as well as those that are 
unique to each condition.53

Closely aligned to the spectrum perspective is the 

notion that AUD is heterogeneous and has two or 
more subtypes, each one associated with a different 
spectrum.54,55 A number of these subtypes, such as 
Knight’s “essential” type,54 Babor’s Type B,55 and 
Cloninger’s Type II,22 are characterized by early onset 
and antisocial features. Thus, a relevant consideration 
is the possibility that the apparent co-occurrence 
between AUD and ASPD, for example, could be 
viewed as a subtype of AUD associated with the 
externalizing spectrum. Other subtypes, such as 
Knight’s “reactive alcoholism,” Babor’s Type A, and 
Cloninger’s Type I, are associated more with the 
internalizing spectrum. The subtyping literature 
highlights that the phenomenon of co-occurrence 
need not be viewed as the overlap of two relatively 
homogeneous conditions but could represent 
a single, relatively homogeneous, subtype of a 
heterogeneous condition.

Prognosis and Course

The course of AUD has much variation, with some 
cases limited to a specific period of time, others 
showing a relapsing and remitting pattern, and still 
others showing a persistent, chronic pattern.56 Given 
the chronic nature of personality disorders, it seems 
likely that the presence of a co-occurring personality 
disorder would be associated with a more pernicious 
course of AUD. Relatively little research has used 
community-based samples to examine the course of 
AUD and personality disorders. However, existing 
data suggest co-occurring personality disorders augur 
poor prognoses. For example, in a general population 
sample, ASPD and BPD were significantly associated 
with persistence of alcohol dependence.57

Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders | e7 

Few in-depth investigations focus on the course 

of co-occurring AUD and ASPD. One study 
investigated the prevalence and course of SUD, 
including AUD, in a treatment-seeking sample that 
included a small number (n = 54) of individuals 
diagnosed with ASPD and a comparison sample 
(n = 552) of individuals with no ASPD diagnosis.58 
The investigators found that individuals diagnosed 
with ASPD started drinking alcohol at younger 
ages. However, AUD diagnosis and indicators of 
course (i.e., years of alcohol use, days of alcohol 
use in the past year, and days of abstinence) were 
not significantly different between the ASPD and 
non-ASPD groups.

A prospective, 10-year study focused on the course 

of BPD in a clinical sample and demonstrated a 
few major themes relevant to the course of SUD, 
including alcohol abuse and dependence.59 The 
study included two groups of participants: those 
diagnosed with BPD and those diagnosed with 
another personality disorder. First, diagnoses of 
alcohol abuse and dependence were more common 
among participants who were diagnosed with BPD 
when compared with participants diagnosed with 
another personality disorder. Second, the prevalence 
of alcohol disorders similarly decreased over time for 
both groups, but it remained more common among 
those diagnosed with BPD.

The course of alcohol and substance disorders was 
examined more closely within the BPD group. The 
findings indicated that a vast majority (about 90%) 
of participants diagnosed with BPD had a remission 
of alcohol abuse or dependence by the 10-year 
follow-up.59 Further, participants with BPD were 
more likely to experience remission than recurrences 
of use, and individuals who had BPD but no alcohol 
diagnosis at baseline were unlikely to develop 
an alcohol-related diagnosis during the study. 
Although this was not a treatment-specific study, the 
participants were recruited from inpatient samples 
and were in treatment for most of the study period.
In a review of treatment outcomes for individuals 
with co-occurring AUD and ASPD, Newton-Howes 
and colleagues concluded that alcohol outcomes and 
psychosocial functioning improved for those who 
stayed in treatment, although attrition was high.60 
The prognosis of co-occurring AUD and BPD is 
complex and difficult to disentangle given the varied 
pathways of each disorder. Intensive longitudinal 
studies are critical to assess variations in course and 

e8 | Alcohol Research: Current Reviews | Vol 40 No 1 |  2019

prognosis and can potentially provide indicators of 
co-occurrence and severity. Additional research in 
this area is needed.

Treatment

Clinical approaches to and research on treatment 
for personality disorders and SUD (including AUD) 
have often been tackled from a silo approach, such 
that one condition (e.g., addiction) is addressed 
separately from other psychological symptoms and 
disorders. Addressing personality disorders and SUD 
independently may be necessary in the clinical realm 
because of active substance use or threats of relapse 
thwarting treatment progress. Also, this approach 
may be necessary for research trials to maximize 
internal validity.

Depending on the severity of AUD, the 

detoxification period may first be necessary for the 
most accurate assessment of mood and personality. 
For example, increased irritability, anxiety, and low 
mood may be present primarily during heavy use 
or during withdrawal and may resolve if substance 
induced.2,46 Assessment of affective symptoms after 
withdrawal or detoxification, incorporating known 
information about premorbid emotional and 
behavioral functioning when available, may help 
with diagnosis decisions and may serve to disentangle 
substance use from symptoms that may be associated 
with other disorders. However, some individuals 
do not receive treatment following detoxifications, 
as it is estimated that approximately 50% of 
detoxifications are followed by other treatment.61
Although co-occurring AUD or SUD and 

personality disorders understandably can make the 
assessment and intervention process challenging, it 
may be unrealistic to require that treatment focus on 
only one aspect at a time (e.g., target only substance 
use and then treat the personality disorder). 
For co-occurring AUD and BPD, a number of 
complications may arise, such as suicidal thoughts 
or behavior associated with the personality disorder, 
potentially undermining the ability to continue 
with AUD treatment. Thus, it may not always be 
possible or ideal to treat only the AUD or personality 
disorder and then proceed to treat the co-occurring 
disorder. These complexities are evident throughout 
the research literature, as few studies specifically 
examine co-occurring conditions.

Although treatments have been developed or 
adapted for AUD, SUD, BPD, and ASPD, there 
is limited empirical support for these treatments 
among samples of individuals diagnosed with 
AUD and co-occurring ASPD or BPD. Treatment 
research involving those with AUD and psychiatric 
disorders other than personality disorders also is 
limited, highlighting a major gap in empirical and 
intervention fields.62 However, studies examining 
various disorder-specific treatments may be useful 
for treating the co-occurring disorders. It should be 
noted that a number of treatments may be effective 
for AUD and ASPD or BPD, but they have not been 
established as efficacious because of limited trials, 
small samples, or a broad focus on SUD or outcomes 
rather than AUD.63 Regardless, research in which 
SUD is the focus may provide a starting point for 
further treatment research on alcohol use and AUD 
in the context of BPD and ASPD. (See Table 1 for 
brief descriptions of the treatments discussed in 
this article.)

Psychosocial treatments

There is modest support for treatments that 
show reductions in substance use while primarily 
treating BPD (i.e., dialectical behavior therapy, 
dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, and dual-
focused schema therapy) or while treating SUD 
in the context of BPD.63,76 For example, one study 
examined dialectical behavior therapy for SUD 
and included medication assistance (e.g., replacing 
opiates with methadone) in the initial phases of 
treatment, called “transitional maintenance.”64 The 
investigators reported that at the end of treatment 
and at a 16-month follow-up, this treatment was 
more effective at reducing substance use than 
treatment as usual.

Other studies have found dialectical behavior 
therapy to be as effective at treating BPD symptoms 
for those with BPD and SUD as it is for participants 
with no SUD.77 However, for the reduction of 
substance-related symptoms, no difference was 
found between the dialectical behavior therapy 
group and the treatment as usual group.77 Although 
dialectical behavior therapy is primarily used for 
BPD, it was found to be acceptable in a clinical 
trial intended to treat men with both BPD and 
ASPD, most of whom also reported substance 
use.78 Rates of alcohol and substance use did not 

change substantially in this trial, however. A review 
examining effective treatments for BPD determined 
that other treatments, such as mentalization-based 
therapy, showed promise, although the small 
number of studies limited the strength of possible 
recommendations.79

Effective treatments for ASPD are limited 

because few trials with sufficient evidence have been 
identified.80 ASPD treatments showing promise, 
such as treatment with contingency management, 
often were originally developed for SUDs, further 
highlighting the possibility of a common thread 
across interventions for co-occurring AUD and 
ASPD or BPD.

As noted by Garofalo and Wright, treatment 

approaches based on transdiagnostic constructs such 
as neuroticism and disinhibition may target changes 
in the constructs.24 Transdiagnostic factors, which 
have been described as “psychological constructs 
that are observed across a range of disorders” and 
“functionally causal mechanisms that inform the 
development of classes of disorders,” align with a 
dimensional approach to both understanding and 
treating psychopathology.81(p135) Some treatment 
packages that use a transdiagnostic approach are 
acceptance and commitment therapy,71 dialectical 
behavior therapy,64 and the unified protocol.72 
Through various treatments and across an array 
of disorders, including BPD and SUD, research 
has supported changes related to transdiagnostic 
constructs, such as increases in emotion regulation.82 
In addition, indirect evidence supporting 
transdiagnostic approaches comes from research 
on personality and alcohol, which has revealed 
that using alcohol to cope with negative emotions 
mediates the association between personality traits, 
such as neuroticism and impulsivity, and reported 
alcohol problems.83

The integration of relevant treatment components 

such as emotion regulation skills, as opposed to 
stand-alone, single-disorder treatment, is highly 
compatible with transdiagnostic approaches. For 
example, contingency management, an effective 
treatment for AUD that uses behavioral principles to 
decrease ineffective and increase effective behaviors, 
has been incorporated into treatment for other 
disorders, such as dialectical behavior therapy.70 
Integrated treatment for personality disorders 
proposes using key treatment components from 
multiple therapies and developing a treatment

Table 1 Treatment Descriptions

Treatment

Key Concepts

Dialectical Behavior Therapy for SUD64

•  Uses primarily behavioral approaches to target problematic behaviors organized within a 

predetermined hierarchy: life-threatening behaviors, behaviors that interfere with treatment, and 
behaviors that interfere with quality of life.

•  Targets substance use as the top behavior within the quality-of-life level of the hierarchy.
•  Includes skills training in four domains: mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and 

interpersonal effectiveness.

•  Includes 12 months of weekly individual therapy and group skills training, telephone coaching, 

and therapist consultation.

•  Emphasizes attachment strategies and dialectical abstinence.
•  Targets BPD and AUD simultaneously.

Dynamic Deconstructive Psychotherapy65

•  Includes weekly individual therapy for 12 months.
•  Emphasizes alliance building, emotion identification, polarization awareness, judgment awareness 

Dual-Focused Schema Therapy66

Mentalization-Based Therapy67

and modification, and distance from idealizing fantasies.

•  Targets AUD and BPD simultaneously.

•  Includes 6 months of individual and group therapies.
•  Emphasizes relapse prevention, stimulus control, interpersonal and emotion regulation skills, 

coping with craving, and identification and obstruction of maladaptive schemas.

•  Addresses substance use as a coping mechanism for emotions and conflicts related to schemas.
•  Targets AUD and BPD simultaneously.

•  Uses psychodynamic-oriented treatment in group and individual formats.
•  Emphasizes improvement of mentalization within a safe, collaborative, and attached therapy 

relationship and focuses on internal states of self and others, with a goal of improving 
interpersonal relatedness, emotion regulation, and identity. 

Metacognitive Treatment68,69

•  Emphasizes metacognitive mastery, which is the “ability to use knowledge about mental states of 

Contingency Management70

self and others to cope with distress and solve social problems.”6(p22)

•  Targets the cognitive attentional syndrome to modify unhelpful thinking patterns.

•  Uses behavioral economics and operant conditioning principles to modify behaviors.
•  Emphasizes the use of reinforcements and consequences to increase desired (e.g., abstinence) 

and decrease undesired (e.g., substance use) behaviors.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy71

•  Emphasizes acceptance, values, and psychological flexibility through approaches such as 

Unified Protocol Therapy72

mindfulness, identification of values and congruent living, and thought diffusion.

•  Offers individual and group formats. 

•  Uses transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders.
•  Emphasizes emotional and physical awareness, appraisal flexibility, exposure, and 

emotion-driven behaviors.

Emotion-Regulation Therapy73

•  Uses an acceptance-based approach to emotion regulation and is delivered in group format as 

Integrated Therapy74

an adjunctive treatment.

•  Includes participation in groups focused on improving skills such as, among others, impulse 

control and increasing awareness of emotions and their functions.

•  Uses a coordinated, goal-oriented approach integrating evidence-based components of other 
treatments (e.g., dialectical behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy) and follows a 
sequential process of therapy stages, beginning with establishing safety.

•  Emphasizes therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and self-observation.

Mindfulness and Modification Therapy75

•  Includes individual or group transdiagnostic treatment targeting behavioral dysregulation.
•  Emphasizes mindfulness and components of other treatments (e.g., acceptance and commitment 

therapy and dialectical behavior therapy).

adapted to a patient’s needs.74 This approach 
inherently integrates key transdiagnostic components 
such as emotion regulation.

Research specific to co-occurring SUD and 

personality disorders (not exclusively ASPD 
and BPD) has concluded that using evidence-
based strategies across therapies (e.g., combining 
contingency management with pharmacotherapy) 
tends to be most effective.84 Research on AUD 
treatment has suggested that targeting specific traits, 
such as impulsiveness, using a matched treatment 
approach may effectively reduce alcohol use.85 
Mindfulness and modification therapy, which 
is another transdiagnostic treatment that targets 
behavioral dysregulation, has been shown to be 
related to decreased alcohol use and aggression 
among voluntary and court-ordered participants.75 
Collectively, the research suggests that identifying 
transdiagnostic features and treating conditions using 
evidence-supported treatment components that 
target those features may be a useful approach for 
treating co-occurring AUD and personality disorders.
Important to note is attrition during treatment 

for co-occurring AUD or SUD and personality 
disorders (e.g., 40% in a sample of SUD and BPD), 
and some evidence shows higher dropout rates 
for participants who had AUD and a personality 
disorder, as compared to those with AUD and 
no personality disorder.60,64 This attrition is not 
surprising given that this population faces many 
challenges and complexities with the presenting 
problem and related to the broader environment 
and context. However, some studies have pointed 
to factors and existing strategies that may improve 
retention rates, such as making treatment enrollment 
contingent on predetermined attendance rules and 
establishing strong therapeutic relationships.64 Other 
research has called for a focus on improving dual-
diagnosis treatments and retention strategies for 
people with AUD.60

Pharmacological interventions

Comprehensive treatment for people with 
co-occurring AUD and ASPD or BPD often 
adopts a multifaceted approach using psychosocial 
and pharmacological interventions, including 
medication-assisted treatment for AUD and for 
BPD. Treatment for AUD may include acamprosate, 
naltrexone, disulfiram, or off-label medications 

such as topiramate,86 and treatment for BPD may 
include naltrexone or topiramate.87,88 This review 
focuses on studies of personality disorders and AUD 
outcomes and is organized by class of medication 
(i.e., alcohol-specific medications, anticonvulsants, 
and psychoactive drugs).

An investigation of the effectiveness of medications 

among individuals with alcohol dependence found 
that treatment with naltrexone, naltrexone plus 
disulfiram, or disulfiram plus placebo was just as 
effective for alcohol use outcomes among individuals 
who had co-occurring BPD or ASPD as it was 
among those with no ASPD or BPD.89 In another 
study, Rohsenow and colleagues identified that 
the presence of antisocial traits was associated with 
increased effectiveness of naltrexone when compared 
to placebo.90

Before discussing pharmacotherapy for personality 
disorders, it should be noted that no medications for 
ASPD or BPD have been approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. Further, no clinical trials 
have directly examined the efficacy of medications 
for people with co-occurring AUD and ASPD or 
BPD. Most studies have focused on one medication 
that targets similar mechanisms (e.g., impulsivity) 
across co-occurring conditions.

Research supporting specific pharmacotherapy 
for BPD is mixed, largely because the quality and 
quantity of studies provide insufficient evidence 
to evaluate efficacy.91 Although the evidence 
regarding pharmacotherapy approaches for BPD 
is equivocal, certain medications, such as mood 
stabilizers and antipsychotics, matched to specific 
symptom presentations, such as affective lability, may 
show improvement for BPD symptoms, whereas 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
demonstrate little to no efficacy.87 Similarly, studies 
have preliminarily supported use of naltrexone for 
symptoms in the impulsive behavior domain and 
have reported reductions in self-injurious thoughts 
and behaviors.87,88 The general recommendation is 
to use psychotherapy as the primary treatment with 
pharmacotherapy as an adjunctive treatment, since 
the efficacy of specific medications for BPD is not 
currently robust. Regarding ASPD, little evidence 
supports pharmacotherapy, and medications are 
often used to treat symptoms but not as a stand-
alone treatment.92

Anticonvulsants such as topiramate and 
lamotrigine and atypical, second-generation 

Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders | e11 

antipsychotics such as olanzapine have been 
investigated for the treatment of AUD and BPD. 
Topiramate has been identified as a possible off-
label medication for AUD and BPD separately, 
suggesting a mechanism of action (of increased 
inhibitory control) applicable to both conditions.93 
A review of the medications for co-occurring AUD 
and BPD noted that topiramate was associated with 
fewer drinking days for participants who had AUD 
and with decreased anger intensity and reactions for 
those who had BPD.63 In addition, topiramate and 
lamotrigine have demonstrated some effectiveness 
for decreasing craving, and lamotrigine has been 
associated with a decrease in impulsivity and anger 
symptoms of BPD.63

The atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole and 
olanzapine have been associated with impulsivity 
changes in BPD.94,95 The effect of atypical 
antipsychotics on alcohol-related outcomes is mixed. 
An inconsistent effect for outcomes such as craving 
or abstinence has been reported across studies, and 
some research has suggested that genetic influences 
may act as primary moderators.96,97

The literature on antidepressants has demonstrated 

mixed results across studies and conditions. As 
previously mentioned, SSRIs generally have been 
ineffective in the treatment of BPD. On the other 
hand, research investigating AUD and ASPD 
has found more promising results. For instance, 
one study concluded that people with AUD 
and ASPD who also had another mood disorder 
benefited from antidepressants, whereas those 
with no additional mood disorder did not.98 In a 
review of pharmacotherapy for ASPD, the tricyclic 
antidepressant nortriptyline was identified as one 
of the medications that was superior to placebo on 
at least one alcohol-related outcome (i.e., drinking 
days).92 However, only one study reported this 
result, and several other outcomes, such as patient 
drinking ratings and craving, did not differ between 
the nortriptyline and placebo groups.92 As with 
the atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants have 
been associated with different pharmacological 
outcomes across the traditional alcohol typologies. 
For individuals in the Type A typology group 
compared with those in the Type B group, the SSRI 
sertraline was more effective for the outcomes of 
fewer drinking days, time to relapse, and continuous 
abstinence period.99

Considerations and future directions 
for treatment

ASPD and BPD are complex and heterogeneous 
disorders often accompanied by other disorders, 
such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, as with 
psychosocial approaches, pharmacotherapy has 
focused on transdiagnostic dimensions or assumed 
neurophysiology rather than diagnosis categories 
for treatment of these disorders.100 This focus has 
led to the investigation of medications specific to 
affective dysregulation or impulsive behavioral 
dysregulation instead of medications specific to 
a diagnosis.

Other treatment complexities include 

determining level of care based on severity of 
presentation and addressing barriers to accessible 
care. For individuals with severe AUD, inpatient 
or detoxification treatment may be a necessary 
component of treatment. For individuals with 
BPD, hospitalization or specific safety measures 
may be necessary if suicide is a risk. For those with 
ASPD, incarceration or other related limitations 
may be barriers to treatment. When any of these 
disorders occur independently or simultaneously, 
the risks of addiction, intentional or accidental 
overdose, and self-harm are heightened and 
may affect the course of treatment, particularly 
pharmacotherapy decisions.

Stepped care is an approach that can potentially 
help navigate the complex and evolving nature of 
co-occurring AUD and ASPD or BPD. Stepped 
care, or continuing care, has been associated 
with positive outcomes and longer treatment 
engagement for individuals with AUD or SUD.101 
Stepped care is an adaptive approach, evolving as 
the patient’s needs change over time. For example, 
intensive in-person treatment may be necessary 
at times, whereas other modes of treatment with 
varying levels of intensity, such as telephone-based 
care or medication, may be more appropriate over 
the period of treatment. A flexible treatment team 
is necessary for a stepped care approach to work 
effectively. Time in treatment has been positively 
associated with better outcomes for people who 
have been diagnosed with co-occurring AUD and 
other psychopathology,84 further highlighting the 
potential utility of stepped care approaches for 
these co-occurring conditions.

In conclusion, future research investigating 

pharmacotherapies specific to co-occurring 
conditions is needed. The extant research, 
often limited to a few studies per finding, 
generally concludes:
•  Pharmacotherapies for AUD do not produce 
different outcomes for individuals with a 
co-occurring personality disorder.

•  Some anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics 
may be useful for the treatment of AUD, BPD, 
and their co-occurrence.

•  Research is mixed on the effectiveness of 
antidepressants for ASPD alone and for 
co-occurring AUD and ASPD, and effectiveness 
often depends on important moderating variables.

Evidence-based treatments for co-occurring AUD 
and personality disorders, in addition to realistic 
implementation and dissemination strategies that 
accommodate the treatments to these multifaceted 
disorders, need to be explored further.

Conclusion and Future Research

Existing research on ASPD and BPD has important 
implications for AUD, likely because the conditions 
have overlapping symptoms, personality correlates, 
course, and etiology. Research examining shared 
mechanisms can contribute to both prevention and 
targeted intervention efforts. In addition, using 
new and advanced methodological approaches to 
assess risk factors and precursors to misuse or relapse 
can advance understanding of mechanisms that 
contribute to initial and continued use along the 
developmental course.26

Key aspects of these disorders, such as affect 
disturbance, reflect volatility. Momentary changes 
in affect may be challenging to recall or assess using 
traditional methodological approaches such as 
asking individuals to rate their mood from a week 
ago. For example, craving and affect are episodic 
and may be assessed more accurately when they 
occur with natural cues. Precise assessment of such 
symptoms or constructs is relevant to diagnosis, 
because a comprehensive assessment of important 
criteria across relevant contexts can provide a full and 
more accurate picture of the individual’s presenting 
concerns and symptoms. Research incorporating 
methodological approaches, such as ambulatory 

assessment and ecological momentary assessment, 
to assess mood and craving in the moment can 
resolve critical within-person patterns of response 
to evocative cues, allowing for a more nuanced and 
individual evaluation of associations between the 
behaviors (e.g., drinking) and traits (e.g., impulsivity) 
commonly related to personality disorders. 
These methods can facilitate the assessment of an 
individual’s experience (e.g., mood and behaviors) 
in the moment.

Future research should also continue to focus on 
assessing and implementing the best methods, times, 
and places for providing treatment to individuals 
with co-occurring AUD and ASPD or BPD. 
For example, individuals with both AUD and a 
personality disorder tend to seek substance-specific 
treatment later than those with only AUD, although, 
on average, they use substances earlier, have greater 
impairment, and have shorter time to relapse.102 
Research must also address:
•  Screening (where and when people get referred 

to treatment)

•  Barriers to treatment entry (factors that influence 

failure to enter treatment)

•  Identification of treatment approaches for 

co-occurring conditions

•  Dissemination and implementation of effective 

treatment approaches
All three disorders have many similarities, 

including impulsivity and negative affect, 
externalizing correlates, and a likely potential for 
serious consequences and negative outcomes. 
Nevertheless, the ability to reach people diagnosed 
with these conditions and to treat them successfully 
is lacking in many ways. Individuals diagnosed with 
co-occurring AUD and ASPD, BPD, or another 
personality disorder clearly have an influential 
presence across health and legal systems.12,15 
However, people diagnosed with AUD alone have 
a surprisingly low treatment-seeking rate.62 In the 
National Comorbidity Survey, results specific to 
treatment-seeking behaviors among individuals 
with co-occurring AUD and a psychiatric condition 
indicated that this population was more likely to 
receive specialty mental health treatment not focused 
on substance use (41%) than substance-specific 
interventions (16%).62

The contrast between patterns of treatment-seeking 

behaviors is stark for people diagnosed with AUD 

Antisocial and Borderline Personality Disorders | e13 

alone versus those diagnosed with co-occurring 
conditions. Further understanding of the barriers 
to treatment for those with co-occurring conditions 
may provide points of change that positively 
influence the consumer’s ability to access care that 
targets relevant transdiagnostic factors. Hopefully, 
as more investigators focus on the common factors 
underlying these conditions, newer assessment and 
treatment approaches can be developed, evaluated, 
and ultimately disseminated to settings and 
clinicians that serve these individuals.
