Abstract 
Background  There are no published longitudinal studies from Africa of people with dementia seen in memory 
clinics. The aim of this study was to determine the proportions of the different dementia subtypes, rates of cognitive 
decline, and predictors of survival in patients diagnosed with dementia and seen in a memory clinic.

Methods  Data were collected retrospectively from clinic records of patients aged ≥ 60 seen in the memory clinic 
at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa over a 10-year period. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorders (DSM–5) criteria were used to identify patients with Major Neurocognitive Disorders (dementia). 
Additional diagnostic criteria were used to determine the specific subtypes of dementia. Linear regression analysis 
was used to determine crude rates of cognitive decline, expressed as mini-mental state examination (MMSE) points 
lost per year. Changes in MMSE scores were derived using mixed effects modelling to curvilinear models of cogni-
tive change, with time as the dependent variable. Multivariable cox survival analysis was used to determine factors 
at baseline that predicted mortality.

Results  Of the 165 patients who met inclusion criteria, 117(70.9%) had Major Neurocognitive Disorder due to Alz-
heimer’s disease (AD), 24(14.6%) Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder (VND), 6(3.6%) Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), 
5(3%) Parkinson disease-associated dementia (PDD), 3(1.8%) fronto-temporal dementia, 4(2.4%) mixed demen-
tia and 6(3.6%) other types of dementia. The average annual decline in MMSE points was 2.2(DLB/PDD), 2.1(AD) 
and 1.3(VND). Cognitive scores at baseline were significantly lower in patients with 8 compared to 13 years of edu-
cation and in those with VND compared with AD. Factors associated with shorter survival included age at onset 
greater than 65 (HR = 1.82, 95% C.I. 1.11, 2.99, p = 0.017), lower baseline MMSE (HR = 1.05, 95% C.I. 1.01, 1.10, p = 0.029), 
Charlson’s comorbidity scores of 3 to 4 (HR = 1.88, 95% C.I. 1.14, 3.10, p = 0.014), scores of 5 or more (HR = 1.97, 95% C.I. 
1.16, 3.34, p = 0.012) and DLB/PDD (HR = 3.07, 95% C.I. 1.50, 6.29, p = 0.002). Being female (HR = 0.59, 95% C.I.0.36, 0.95, 
p = 0.029) was associated with longer survival.

Conclusions  Knowledge of dementia subtypes, the rate and factors affecting cognitive decline and survival out-
comes will help inform decisions about patient selection for potential future therapies and for planning dementia 
services in resource-poor settings.

Background
Neurodegenerative  disorders  like  dementia  are  on  the 
rise  in  sub–Saharan  Africa  due  to  increased  longevity 
leading  to  an  increase  in  the  numbers  of  older  people 
[1].  In  response,  memory  clinics  have  been  established 
in  some  parts  of  sub-Saharan  Africa  to  identify,  investi-
gate,  and  treat  cognitive  disorders  such  as  dementia  [2, 
3]. There are few studies that have described these cohort 
of  patients,  and  none  that  we  are  aware  of  that  have 
reported out-patient longitudinal data. Memory clinic or 
hospital-based studies on people living with dementia in 
Africa  have  usually  been  small  or  have  had  a  cross-sec-
tional design [2–4].

Kalula et al.described a cohort of patients seen regard-
less  of  age  in  a  memory  clinic  in  Cape  Town,  South 
Africa.  Within  a  period  of  five  years,  305  people  were 
seen  of  whom  74%  had  dementia  [2].  Of  these  44% 
had  Major  Neurocognitive  Disorder  due  to  Alzhei-
mer’s  disease  (AD),  28%  Major  Vascular  Neurocogni-
tive  Disorder  (VND),  and  15%  mixed  Alzheimer’s  and 
vascular  dementia.  Thirteen  percent  had  other  forms  of 
dementia,  namely  Dementia  with  Lewy  bodies  (DLB), 
Parkinson  disease-associated  dementia  (PDD),  fronto-
temporal  dementia  (FTD),  HIV-associated  dementia, 
alcohol-related dementia, history of previous head injury 
and  undetermined  forms  [2].  In  this  study,  however, 
dementia  diagnoses  were  based  on  clinicians’  impres-
sions  rather  than  standardized  diagnostic  criteria.  In 
2011  a  Nigerian  hospital-based  study  profiled  dementia 
phenotypes  of  108  patients  who  were  inpatients  over  a 
10-year  period  [4].  Of  these  57.4%  were  diagnosed  with 
AD, 16.7% VND, 3.7% mixed dementia, 3.7% FTD, 2.8% 
DLB,  2.8%  alcohol  related  dementia,  0.9%  PDD  and 
undetermined  subtypes  12%  [4].  None  of  the  memory 
clinic studies we reviewed that were conducted in Africa 
reported rates of cognitive decline or mortality data.

Mini-mental  state  examination  (MMSE)  scores  have 
been  used  to  determine  cognitive  decline  in  studies 
conducted in Western and Asian memory clinics [5–7]. 
A retrospective chart review of a cohort of people seen 
in  two  University  Alzheimer’s  Disease  centres  in  the 
USA  showed  an  average  annual  MMSE  decline  of  3.2 
points in AD and 4.7 points in FTD [5]. A mainly Euro-
pean  multi-centre  study  found  mean  annual  MMSE 
score declines of 2.1 points with DLB, 1.6 points for AD 
and  1.8  points  for  PDD  [6].  A  memory  clinic  study  in 
the  Republic  of  Korea  comparing  AD,  VND  and  PDD 
subtypes  showed  more  rapid  decline  in  patients  with 

AD  compared  with  the  others  [7].  Factors  like  age  of 
symptom  onset,  level  of  education,  and  cardiovascular 
risk  factors  have  also  been  shown  to  predict  rates  of 
decline  [8–10].  Gerritsen  et  al.  showed  that  neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms were associated with higher rates of 
cognitive decline [11].

Dementia  subtypes  and  rates  of  cognitive  decline 
appear to influence survival outcomes in dementia [12, 
13].  Slower  rates  of  cognitive  decline  and  longer  sur-
vival  have  been  shown  in  Alzheimer’s  dementia  com-
pared with DLB and FTD [13, 14]. A Californian study, 
where  type  of  dementia  was  confirmed  by  autopsy, 
found a survival from time of diagnosis of 4.2 years for 
FTD  compared  to  6  years  for  AD  [13].  In  this  cohort, 
FTD had a higher cognitive decline of mean annual rate 
of  6.7  points  compared  to  AD  with  2.3  points  [13].  A 
study of people seen in memory clinics in Sweden with 
a  mean  follow-up  of  2.5  years  found  that  low  baseline 
MMSE,  male  gender,  higher  number  of  medications, 
institutionalization,  and  age  were  associated  with 
increased  mortality  after  dementia  diagnosis  [15].  A 
retrospective study carried out in three Italian demen-
tia out-patient clinics found age, gender and functional 
status  to  be  the  main  determinants  of  patient  survival 
[16].  An  Australian  study  with  participants  from  nine 
memory  clinics  found  that  57.4%  of  779  patients  with 
dementia had died within eight years [17]. In this study, 
greater  deterioration  in  dementia  severity  and  func-
tional  impairment  over  time  predicted  mortality  inde-
pendent  of  baseline  levels  [17].  A  study  in  specialised 
outpatients’ dementia clinics in Spain found AD to have 
the  best  survival  while  subtypes  like  Parkinson-Plus 
Syndromes  and  dementia  due  to  multiple  aetiologies 
sub-types had the worst prognosis [18]. A Dutch study 
carried out among patients with young onset dementia 
in  specialised  centres  found  AD  to  have  a  worse  sur-
vival compared with VND subtype [19]. The same study 
found a trend of decreased survival for the participants 
with AD compared with FTD [19].

There  are,  to  our  knowledge,  no  published  longitu-
dinal  studies  of  patients  with  dementia  from  memory 
clinics  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  that  have  characterized 
the  subtypes,  cognitive  decline,  survival  outcomes  and 
predictors of survival. Dementia subtypes have distinc-
tive  natural  histories.  A  precise  diagnosis  may  lead  to 
a  better  understanding  of  prognosis.  Data  regarding 
rates  of  cognitive  decline  and  survival  of  the  different 
dementia subtypes have also largely been derived from

populations  in  the  developed  world.  Accurate  clini-
cal  diagnosis  is  especially  important  in  resource  poor 
settings  where  expensive  investigations  are  not  read-
ily  available.  With  the  future  advent  of  potential  spe-
cific  drug  therapies,  an  accurate  diagnosis  as  well  as  a 
knowledge  of  probable  survival  outcomes  of  dementia 
subtypes  may  be  useful.  A  knowledge  of  the  charac-
teristics  of  patients  seen  in  memory  clinics  and  their 
longitudinal  trajectories  can  also  be  used  to  further 
develop these clinics and services of older people with 
dementia. The aim of this study, using data collected on 
older adults who attended the memory clinic at Groote 
Schuur  Hospital  in  Cape  Town,  was  to  determine  the 
proportions  of  the  different  dementia  subtypes,  the 
rates  of  cognitive  decline,  trajectories  of  decline  of 
the  different  dementia  sub-types,  and  to  determine 
whether their correlations exist between dementia sub-
types and survival rates.

Methods
Study design and procedure

Data  were  obtained  from  patients’  memory  clinic  case 
records  using  a  standardized  data  collection  form  for 
patients  aged  60  and  above  seen  during  a  10-year  study 
period from  1st January 2010 to  31st December 2019.

The memory clinic is a sub-specialist outpatient clinic 
of Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. 
The  clinic  is  held  weekly,  and  its  clinical  staff  consists 
of  a  team  of  geriatric  medicine  physicians,  neuropsy-
chiatrists,  a  neurologist,  neuropsychologists,  and  sub-
specialty  trainees.  Patients  are  referred  from  general 
practitioners,  family  physicians,  medical  officers  from 
community  health  clinics  and  state  or  private  special-
ists in the Western Cape region. The catchment popu-
lation  is  mainly  urban  with  a  mix  of  socioeconomic 
status.  The  clinical  staff  triage  the  referrals  into  those 
who  would  be  seen  in  the  memory  or  geriatric  clinics. 
In  general,  patients  with  higher  MMSE  scores  (≥ 15) 
are  more  likely  to  be  testable  using  the  full  neuropsy-
chology  battery  and  are  therefore  seen  in  the  memory 
clinic.  Those  with  lower  MMSE  scores  are  seen  in  a 
geriatric clinic, where a less detailed and more focused 
cognitive assessment is performed. Patients are usually 
accompanied by a family member/caregiver who assists 
with  collateral  history.  Patients  undergo  a  full  medi-
cal  examination.  Baseline  cognitive  assessments  were 
generally administered in English by the neuropsychol-
ogy  team.  If  a  patient  didn’t  speak  English,  the  tests 
were informally translated by a tester who could speak 
the  patient’s  first  language.  The  tests  include  assessing 
general  cognitive  functioning  using  MMSE  and  Mon-
treal  Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA)  scores.  Specific 
cognitive abilities are assessed as follows: Learning and 

memory  by  Repeatable  Battery  for  the  Assessment  of 
Neuropsychological  Status  (RBANS)  list  learning  with 
delayed  recall,  RBANS  Story  Memory  with  delayed 
recall  and  RBANS  Figure  Recall.  Language  is  assessed 
by verbal fluency that includes both semantic and pho-
nemic  assessments,  Boston  Naming  test  (short  form), 
and  an  assessment  for  speech  quality  (i.e.,  clarity,  dif-
ficulty  in  making  oneself  understood,  and  difficulty  in 
understanding).  Attention  and/or  working  memory 
is  assessed  by  digit  span  forward  and  backwards  and 
months  of  the  year  backwards.  Frontal  lobe  or  execu-
tive functioning by trails A, MoCA Trail, trails B, CLOX 
1  and  2,  Luria  recursive  figures  and  hand  sequence. 
Visuo-perceptual  or  spatial  ability  is  assessed  by  the 
RBANS  figure  copy,  and  CLOX  test.  The  RBANS  bat-
tery was not validated in this memory clinic population.
Laboratory  investigations  to  exclude  reversible  causes 
of  cognitive  impairment  are  conducted.  These  include 
tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function, serum calcium 
levels,  serum  levels  of  vitamin  B-12,  HIV,  and  syphilis 
serology  tests.  Patients  undergo  neuroimaging—usu-
ally computed tomography (CT) of the brain—but other 
neuroimaging  modalities  such  as  Magnetic  Resonance 
Imaging  (MRI),  Single  Photon  Emission  Computed 
Tomography (SPECT), and 18-fluoro deoxy glucose Posi-
tron Emission Tomography (18-FDG-PET) are occasion-
ally done if indicated.

The  multi-disciplinary  team  meets  at  the  end  of  each 
clinic  to  discuss  the  patients’  likely  diagnoses  and  plan 
of  action.  Cognitive  assessments  using  MMSE  and/or 
MoCA are usually carried out by the attending clinician 
at six-monthly intervals corresponding with the patient’s 
follow-up  clinic  visits.  Once  a  treatment  plan  is  agreed 
upon,  patients  are  discharged  back  to  the  care  of  the 
referring centre.

For  this  study,  a  consensus  diagnosis  of  dementia  and 
dementia  sub-type  was  determined  by  a  retrospective 
review  of  hospital  records  by  the  Neurologist  (MC)  and 
the  trainee  sub-specialist  in  geriatric  medicine  (MS). 
The  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disor-
ders  (DSM–5)  criteria  for  Major  Neurocognitive  Disor-
der were used to determine if the patients had dementia. 
To  determine  dementia  subtypes  the  following  standard 
diagnostic criteria were used: National Institute of Neu-
rological  and  Communicative  Disorders  and  Stroke  and 
the  Alzheimer’s  Disease  and  Related  Disorders  Associa-
tion for AD [20], National Institute of Neurological Dis-
orders  and  Stroke  and  the  Association  Internationale 
pour  la  Recherche  et  l’Enseignement  en  Neurosciences 
(for cerebral vascular disease description) for VND [21], 
Work  Group  on  fronto-temporal  dementia  and  Pick’s 
disease  for  FTD  [22],  and  consensus  guidelines  for  the 
clinical and pathologic diagnosis of dementia with Lewy

bodies [23]. We also used a validated set of diagnostic cri-
teria for PDD [24, 25].

Permission  to  conduct  the  study  was  obtained  from  the 
medical superintendent of Groote Schuur Hospital.

A  participant  was  classified  as  having  the  subtype  of 
dementia if he/she met the probable or the possible crite-
ria as per the outlined standard diagnostic criteria above. 
It  was  possible  for  participants  to  meet  criteria  for  two 
different  subtypes  of  dementia.  If  a  participant  met  two 
different  probable  or  two  different  possible  dementia 
diagnoses  according  to  criteria,  they  were  classified  as 
having  mixed  dementia.  If  participants  met  the  criteria 
for probable dementia of one type and possible dementia 
of another type, they were categorized as only having the 
probable  dementia  subtype  (e.g.,  if  they  met  criteria  for 
probable  AD  and  possible  VND,  they  were  categorized 
as AD). Table 1 shows details of how this was done using 
AD and VND as examples.

The baseline visit was identified as the date the patient 
was first seen during the study period and met the study 
criteria. The education level was the highest level attained 
at baseline. Duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 
estimated  from  the  earliest  symptom  of  dementia  as 
obtained  from  the  patient  and/or  caregiver.  Comorbid-
ity  scores  were  derived  from  the  Charlson’s  Weighted 
Index  of  Comorbidity  [26].  Baseline  laboratory  investi-
gations  were  carried  out  within  three  months  before  or 
after  dementia  diagnosis.  Blood  pressure  measurements 
and MMSEs were carried out at baseline and subsequent 
clinic  visits,  usually  with  intervals  of  six  months.  Cho-
linesterase  inhibitors  were  prescribed  for  patients  who 
could  afford  to  purchase  them  from  private  pharma-
cies  since  they  were  not  available  in  state  services.  We 
checked for dates of death at the state registry managed 
by  the  South  African  Medical  Research  Council  (MRC) 
for all enrolled participants on  30th November 2021.

Participants  with  advanced  dementia  (unable  to  com-
plete  at  least  50%  of  neuropsychology  battery  tests  and 
dependent, in the absence of physical disability, on three 
or  more  basic  activities  of  daily  living),  were  excluded 
from the study.

Ethics  approval  was  obtained 

from  the  Human 
Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sci-
ences, University of Cape Town (HREC-REF: 403/2021).

Statistical analysis
Characteristics

Analyses  were  performed  using  Stata  version  17.0  [27]. 
Proportions  of  participants  diagnosed  with  different 
sub-types  of  dementia  were  expressed  as  percentages  of 
the total number of participants in the study. Frequency 
tables  and  cross  tabulations  of  sociodemographic  and 
clinical  variables  were  undertaken.  Normally  distrib-
uted  data  were  expressed  as  means  and  standard  devia-
tions  and  compared  using  one  way  analysis  of  variance 
(one-way  anova).  Tukey  or  Scheffe  tests  were  used  for 
post-hoc  comparisons  to  assess  which  group  pairs  dif-
fered  significantly.  Non-normally  distributed  data  were 
expressed  as  median  and  interquartile  ranges  and  com-
pared  using  Kruskal–Wallis  tests.  Comparisons  of  cat-
egorical variables were performed using chi-square tests 
of independence.

Cognitive decline

Periods of 12-month intervals of mean MMSE scores, for 
participants who had more than one annual score, were 
used for the analysis of cognitive decline. Linear regres-
sion  was  used  to  determine  the  crude  rates  of  cognitive 
decline, expressed as MMSE points lost per year. We used 
MMSE scores with mixed effects modelling to curvilinear 
models  of  cognitive  change  with  time  as  the  dependent 
variable. Different models using time to event (TTE) i.e., 
from onset of symptoms to death or end of study period, 
age at onset of dementia symptoms and age at diagnosis 
of dementia, were used to determine whether independ-
ent variables like gender, years of education, comorbidity 
score and dementia subtypes predicted cognitive decline. 
There was no serious deviation from assumptions of nor-
mality and constant variance.

Survival

Survival  time  was  defined  as  time  from  symptom  onset 
of  dementia  until  the  date  of  death.  The  Kaplan–Meier 
method was used to estimate the mean and median sur-
vival  times  among  the  different  dementia  sub-types.  A 
comparison  of  survival  rates  was  done  by  the  log  rank 
test. We used Kruskal–Wallis test to assess survival out-
comes between the dementia subtype groups because of 
the non-normally distributed data. Post hoc comparison 
tests were used to assess which group pairs differed, and 
significant  results  were  based  on  a  Bonferroni  adjusted 
level  alpha  of  0.005.  Cox  models  were  used  to  deter-
mine  factors  associated  with  survival.  Potential  risk  fac-
tors for reduced survival and those with p-values of < 0.2 
in  univariate  analysis,  were  entered  into  multivariate 

Ssonko et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2023) 23:829

modelling. Variables were also included in the multivari-
ate  model  of  Cox  regression  with  the  Breslow  method 
for ties to determine which factors at baseline predicted 
reduced  survival.  The  model  was  found  to  have  reason-
able  predictive  power  (using  Harrell’s  C  concordance 
statistic)  and  there  were  no  serious  violations  of  the 
assumptions  of  proportionality  (based  on  Schoenfeld 
residuals). The significance level was set at p < 0.05.

Results
A total of 633 patients attended the memory clinic over 
the  10-year  study  period.  Of  those,  67  who  were  aged 
less  than  60  years,  were  excluded.  A  list  of  566  patients 
was  submitted  to  the  medical  records  department  for 
retrieval of their case records. Of these we received 506 
(89.4%).  A  total  of  341  patients  were  excluded  as  they 
did not meet the study criteria, resulting in a final study 
cohort  of  165  participants  as  shown  in  Fig.  1. The  main 
reasons  for  exclusion  after  reviewing  the  case  notes  on 

the  506  included  missing  data  (n = 93),  a  diagnosis  of 
mild  cognitive  impairment  (n = 88),  age  below  60  years 
(n = 68),  psychiatric  illness  (n = 52),  advanced  dementia 
(n = 21), delirium (n = 8), out of study period (n = 4), and 
other reasons (n = 3 seen in the Geriatric clinic, n = 1 no 
cognitive impairment, n = 1 metastases to the brain, n = 1 
tuberculous meningitis and n = 1 intellectual disability).

Dementia Subtypes

Table  2  shows  the  categorization  of  the  study  cohort  by 
dementia  subtypes.  We  classified  117  (70.9%)  as  having 
AD, 24 (14.6%) with VND, 6 (3.6%) with DLB, 5 (3%) with 
PDD,  3  (1.8%)  with  FTD,  4  (2.4%)  with  mixed  dementia 
and 6 (3.6%) with other types of dementia.

Demographic and clinical characteristics

Table 3 shows the socio-demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of the study cohort. There were more females 
101  (61.2%)  than  males.  The  majority  104  (63.4%)  had

duration  of  symptoms  for  two  or  more  years  prior  to 
dementia diagnosis. Most participants had a comorbid-
ity  score  of  1  to  2  (40%)  followed  by  a  score  of  3  to  4 
(33.3%). At baseline, 39 (23.6%) had MMSE scores of 25 
to 30, 89 (53.9%) MMSE scores 19 to 24 and 35 (21.2%) 
MMSE  scores  of  10  to  18.  Two  individuals  with  low 
MMSEs  of < 10  had  a  diagnosis  of  Primary  Progressive 
Aphasia  and  another  with  Alcohol  Related  Dementia. 
Both had fair functionality though with communication

batteries.

Table  4  shows  the  demographic  and  clinical  charac-
teristics  of  the  study  cohort  by  dementia  subtype.  The 
mean  age  at  diagnosis  of  dementia  was  72.4  years  and 
was  highest  for  the  AD  group  (73.6  years,  SD = 7.2). 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  age  at 
diagnosis  for  the  dementia  subtypes  F  (4,  154) = 3.88, 
p = 0.005. Using the Scheffe test, the mean age at diag-
nosis  was  only  significantly  different  between  AD 
and  VND  (mean  difference = 5.09,  p = 0.029).  Partici-
pants  with  DLB  or  PDD  had  the  highest  age  at  onset 
of  70.9  years,  SD = 6.2,  F  (4,  153) = 3.17,  p = 0.016.  The 
Tukey  test  indicated  that  the  mean  age  at  onset  was 
only  different  between  AD  and  VND  (mean  differ-
ence = 4.32,  p = 0.046).  The  overall  time  since  symp-
tom  onset  and  diagnosis  was  30.6  months  (SD = 23.1) 
and  highest  for  FTD  with  60  months,  SD = 24,  F  (4, 
153) = 2.43,  p = 0.05.  The  Tukey  test  showed  that  par-
ticipants  with  FTD  tended  to  differ  from  VND  (mean 
difference = 37.13,  p = 0.066).  The  overall  mean  follow-
up  time  since  symptom  onset  was  7.2  years  (SD = 3.3)

and least for DLB/PDD group with 4.96 years, SD = 2.5. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean 
follow-up time for the dementia subtypes χ2(4) = 15.39, 
p = 0.04.

Cognitive decline

Figure  2  shows  assessments  for  annualised  cognitive 
decline  among  the  dementia  subtypes.  The  histogram 
(A)  shows  that  there  were  no  serious  deviations  from 
normality.  We  were  therefore  able  to  use  the  mean 
MMSE  to  reflect  the  drop  in  annual  MMSE  points. 

The  beam  (C)  and  confidence  interval  (D)  plots  show 
annual drop in MMSE points of 2.2, 2.1 and 1.3 of par-
ticipants  with  DLB/PDD,  AD,  and  VND  respectively. 
These  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  since 
26 participants had one baseline MMSE score and were 
not analyzed for cognitive decline.

Table  5  shows  mixed  effects  modelling  for  MMSE 
cognitive  scores.  Cognitive  scores  differed  signifi-
cantly  for  those  with  13  years  and  above  of  education. 
They  had  higher  MMSE  scores  compared  to  partici-
pants  with  less  than  8  years  of  education  in  the  three

different mixed effects modeling which included either 
TTE (4.07; 95% C.I. 1.90, 6.25; p < 0.0001), age at symp-
tom  onset  (4.15;  95%  C.I.  2.00,  6.31;  p < 0.0001)  or 
age  at  dementia  diagnosis  (4.27;  95%  C.I.  2.11,  6.43; 
p < 0.0001).  Cognitive  scores  also  differed  significantly 
for  VND  compared  with  AD.  The  VND  group  had 
higher MMSEs on all three mixed effects models: TTE 
(2.37;  95%  C.I.  0.43,  4.31;  p = 0.017),  age  at  symptom 
onset  (2.81;  95%  C.I.  0.88,  4.74;  p = 0.004)  and  age  at 
dementia diagnosis (2.82; 95% C.I. 0.87, 4.77; p = 0.005).

Survival

Table  6  shows  survival  characteristics  of  participants 
according to dementia subtype. Of the 165 participants, 
112 (67.9%) died during the study period. The mean age 
at death of all participants with dementia was 77.3 years 
(SD = 7.3) and was highest for AD (78.9 years, SD = 7.4). 
Using  the  Kruskal–Wallis  test,  there  was  a  signifi-
cant  difference  between  the  dementia  subtype  groups 
for  mean  age  at  death  (χ2(4) = 13.51,  p = 0.009).  The 
Mann–Whitney test showed that the mean age at death 
was  only  significantly  different  between  AD  and  VND 
(p = 0.001).  The  mean  survival  time  of  all  deceased 

participants  with  dementia  was  6.7  years  (SD = 3.4), 
being highest for AD (7.3 years, SD = 3.5) and least with 
mixed dementia (4.1 years, SD = 0.2) followed by DLB/
PDD (4.8 years, SD = 2.6). There was a statistically sig-
nificant difference among the dementia subtype groups 
(χ2(4) = 11.15,  p = 0.025).  The  Mann–Whitney  test 
showed  a  significant  difference  of  the  mean  survival 
time only between AD and DLB/PDD (p = 0.004).

Figure  3  shows  the  survival  curves  for  the  different 
groups of dementia subtypes. A log rank test showed sig-
nificantly  different  survival  among  the  different  demen-
tia  subtypes  (χ2(4) = 18.03)  with  a  p-value = 0.0001. 
Survival was only significantly different between AD and 
DLB/PDD participants, log rank test (χ2 (1) = 15.31) and 
p-value = 0.0001 with AD having a longer survival.

Table 7 shows the results of univariate survival analy-
sis. Women had a longer survival compared to the men 
(HR = 0.59,  95%  C.I.  0.40,  0.86,  p = 0.006).  Participants 
with Charlson’s Weighted Comorbidity scores of 5 and 
above had a shorter survival than those with scores 1 to 
2 (HR = 1.81, 95% C.I. 1.13, 2.89, p = 0.013). VND group 
had  a  shorter  survival  than  AD  (HR = 1.83,  95%  C.I. 
1.06,  3.18,  p = 0.03).  Participants  with  DLB/PDD  also

Discussion
In  our  study,  the  commonest  dementia  subtype  was 
AD  followed  by  VND.  The  overall  duration  from  symp-
tom  onset  until  diagnosis  (date  of  first  clinic  visit)  was 
2.5  years.  The  combined  DLB/PDD  subtype  group  had 
the highest age of symptom onset while AD had the high-
est  age  at  diagnosis.  Cognitive  scores  were  significantly 
higher for VND compared to AD subtypes and higher for 
participants  with  longer  duration  of  education.  Cogni-
tive  decline  was  faster  in  the  DLB/PDD  subtype  and  in 
the AD group compared with VND. Survival in the DLB/
PDD group was lower compared to the AD group. Other

Examination, HR Hazard Ratio, CI confidence interval, VND Major Vascular

disease dementia, FTD Fronto-temporal dementia

factors  significantly  associated  with  reduced  survival 
were  older  age  of  dementia  onset,  lower  baseline  cogni-
tion,  and  higher  comorbidity  scores.  Female  gender  was 
associated with increased survival.

We found AD to be the commonest dementia subtype 
(70.9%),  followed  by  VND  (14.6%).  Our  results  are  not 
consistent  with  other  studies  as  our  AD  frequency  was 
higher  [4,  28,  29].  In  memory  clinic  or  hospital-based 
studies from different parts of the world, the prevalence 
of  AD  ranged  between  38  and  67%  and  5%  to  26%  for 
VND [4, 28–31]. Our findings of a higher proportion of 
AD could relate to how we categorized AD subtype. For 
example, participants with combinations of probable AD 
plus possible VND or participants with probable AD plus 
possible  DLB  were  all  classified  primarily  as  AD.  Differ-
ences in proportions of our dementia subtypes could be 
influenced by variations in criteria to categorize demen-
tia  and  differences  in  the  interpretation  of  these  crite-
ria.  Findings  of  the  Lewy  Body-containing  dementias 
of  DLB  (3.6%)  and  PDD  (3%)  as  the  third  commonest 
dementia subtype have been shown in previous memory 
clinic  studies  [28,  31].  Patients  presenting  with  motor

symptoms  of  Parkinsonism  in  this  hospital  are  usu-
ally  channeled  to  the  neurology  clinic  resulting  in  fewer 
Lewy  Body-containing  dementias  at  our  memory  clinic. 
Our finding of a prevalence of FTD of 1.8% is similar to 
a cohort from a memory clinic in Hong Kong of a com-
parable mean age at diagnosis as our study of 76.1 years 
[28].  Findings  from  a  large  memory  clinic  cohort  in 
France with a mean age of 56 years found a higher preva-
lence  of  FTD  of  9.7%  [32].  The  low  frequency  of  FTD 
in  our  study  could  therefore  be  due  to  the  higher  inclu-
sion criterion age cut-off of 60 years. Patients with initial 
behavioral symptoms with FTD could have been referred 
to the psychiatric clinic and not the memory clinic.

The highest age of symptom onset of 70.9 years in our 
study was in the DLB/PDD group. Amoo et al. in study of 
a  Nigerian  hospital  cohort  found  the  AD  group  to  have 
the  highest  mean  age  of  symptom  onset  of  72.8  years 
compared to DLB patients with a mean age of symptom 
onset  of  65  years  [4].  It  is  unclear  from  the  publication 
whether  the  cohort  comprised  outpatients,  in-patients, 
or both. Our age of symptom onset for DLB/PDD demen-
tias  is,  however,  similar  to  the  findings  of  a  recent  Chi-
nese study which reported a mean age of symptom onset 
of 68.6 years [33]. As stated above, our DLB/PDD group 
is biased group as many younger DLB/PDD patients are 
seen in the neurology clinic.

Our  study  found  an  overall  duration  of  illness  of 
30.6  months,  from  symptom  onset  to  diagnosis.  This  is 
comparable to memory clinic study findings in India and 
Hong Kong [28, 29]. A lower duration of 13.8 months was 
found  in  an  Italian  study  [34].  In  the  developed  world, 
organizational  challenges  of  memory  clinics  coupled 
with long waiting lists are thought to explain the longer 
duration  from  symptom  onset  to  diagnosis  [35].  Our 
challenges of long waiting lists due to fewer qualified per-
sonnel in the memory clinic are similar to findings else-
where  [36].  Also  in  our  context,  significant  functional 
impairment  is  often  the  trigger  for  caregivers  to  seek 
medical help, and this usually occurs late [34, 37]. In our 
cohort, duration from symptom onset to diagnosis could 
have  been  shortest  in  VND  (22.9  months)  followed  by 
those  with  DLB/PDD  (26.2  months)  because  of  the  ear-
lier motor or other non-cognitive symptoms that lead to 
patients  or  caregivers  recognising  the  illness  sooner.  In 
our setting, early symptoms of AD are more likely to be 
seen as “old age” until patients become very functionally 
impaired and present late to the clinic.

The dementia subtype with the highest age at diagnosis 
of 73.6 years was AD. In addition to early cognitive symp-
toms  being  attributed  to  “old  age”  leading  to  diagnosis 
later  in  the  disease  trajectory,  our  inclusion  criterion  of 
age 60 years and above and the triage of some people to 

the geriatric clinic could have contributed to an exclusion 
bias of people with young onset dementia and older frail 
people with advanced dementia [38].

The  mean  annual  rate  of  cognitive  decline  of  MMSE 
points per dementia subtype in our study was 2.2 for the 
group with DLB/PDD, 2.1 for AD and 1.3 for VND. The 
decline in cognition between DLB and PDD is similar to 
that shown by a Swedish study [39]. We considered DLB 
and  PDD  as  one  group  in  the  analyses  due  to  the  small 
numbers in each of these groups. DLB and PDD may, in 
any case, be considered on the same spectrum of patho-
logical  disorders  [40].  In  our  study,  cognitive  decline  of 
DLB/PDD  and  AD  were  similar,  a  finding  different  to  a 
multi-centre cohort study [6]. The similar annual rates of 
decline between DLB/PDD and AD in our study could be 
due  to  the  combination  of  AD + DLB  pathologies  which 
we could have classified as AD. Studies have shown that 
dual  AD + DLB  pathology  has  a  faster  cognitive  decline 
than either individual dementia subtypes [14, 41–43].

We  found  significantly  higher  MMSE  scores  for  VND 
compared to AD, findings similar to those of a Canadian 
study [44]. In our study, we used the MMSE, an inferior 
tool  for  detecting  subcortical  dysexecutive  cognitive 
related  impairment,  hence  the  higher  VND  scores  [45]. 
The  Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  (MoCA)  was  not 
universally used until the later years of the study period.

Thirteen  or  more  years  compared  to  less  than  eight 
years of education was also associated with significantly 
higher MMSE scores in our study. Education levels have 
been shown to affect performance of cognitive tests like 
MMSE  [46].  Higher  levels  of  education  have  been  asso-
ciated  with  higher  MMSE  scores  in  both  developed 
and  developing  countries  [46–48].  Majority  of  our  par-
ticipants  could  have  had  high  MMSE  scores  due  to  the 
higher  literacy  rate  of  participants  as  indicated  by  the 
MMSE score criteria in the triage of who would be seen 
in  the  memory  or  geriatric  clinics.  The  high  education 
levels  of  76%  (Table  1)  of  participants  having  eight  or 
more  years  of  education  may  be  as  a  result  of  memory 
clinic  population  catchment  area  in  the  Western  Cape 
province of South Africa having the highest literacy rates 
in South Africa of approximately 80% [49].

The  finding  of  the  DLB/PDD  group  having  a  higher 
mortality  compared  to  AD  is  consistent  with  previous 
studies  [50,  51].  We  did  not  explore  possible  causes  of 
death,  but  a  previous  study  has  shown  that  fall-related 
injuries  and  pneumonias  contributed  to  mortality 
[50].  Shorter  survival  due  to  onset  of  dementia  symp-
toms ≥ 65  years  has  also  been  shown  in  studies  else-
where  [17,  52].  Increased  mortality  due  to  late  onset  of 
dementia  symptoms  could  be  due  to  increased  vulner-
ability  to  infections  due  to  aspiration  pneumonia  and

urinary tract infections, injuries related to poor mobility, 
and  adverse  reactions  due  to  psychotropic  and  sedative 
medicines,  the  choice  of  which  is  limited  particularly  in 
the  public  healthcare  service.  The  infections  and  inju-
ries  are  associated  with  progression  of  the  dementia 
syndrome  as  a  result  of  excess  damage  accumulation  or 
rapidly  shrinking  resilience  due  to  accelerated  aging  of 
the  participants  [53,  54].  We  found  a  large  proportion 
(67.9%)  of  our  cohort  died  during  the  follow-up  period 
with  a  mean  survival  time  of  6.7  years.  This  finding  is 
higher than mortality of 57.4% of 779 dementia patients 
in an Australian study carried out in nine memory clin-
ics [17]. This difference could be due to late diagnosis in 
our  cohort  compared  to  the  earlier  dementia  diagnosis 
in the Australian cohort which is associated with longer 
survival  similar  to  findings  in  the  Dutch  study  which 
focused on early onset dementia [19]. Majority (61.6%) of 
the Australian PRIME study cohort were on cholinester-
ase inhibitors which could have slowed cognitive decline 
and  probably  reduced  mortality  rate  compared  to  our 
cohort [55]. Females were associated with increased sur-
vival compared to males, a finding again consistent with 
other studies [15, 17]. In our study, survival decreased by 
5%  for  every  one  unit  decrease  in  MMSE  score.  This  is 
consistent with the findings from similar published stud-
ies  showing  shorter  survival  with  a  lower  MMSE  scores 
[15,  56,  57].  The  short  survival  in  our  study  population 
could  have  been  due  to  increased  risk  of  infections.  We 
did not have data on the causes of death as registered on 
the  death  certificate,  which  are  commonly  reported  as 
natural cause particularly in frail patients with dementia. 
The risk of infection was increased in our study popula-
tion because the care is provided by family and other car-
egivers who have little knowledge and no formal support 
in the care of patients with swallowing disorders and/or 
bladder  and  bowel  dysfunction  and  poor  mobility.  With 
our  study  showing  reduced  survival  with  reduced  cog-
nitive  score,  comorbidity  burden  has  been  associated 
with  impaired  cognitive  performance  and  decline  [58, 
59].  Higher  comorbidity  as  characterized  by  Charlson’s 
comorbidity  index  scores  of  3  to  4  and  5  and  above  in 
our  study,  was  associated  with  higher  mortality  among 
dementia patients. Previous studies have assessed comor-
bidity differently [57, 60, 61]. Our study relied on the doc-
umented  comorbidities  limited  to  Charlson’s  index  tool 
[26].  We  therefore  did  not  consider  geriatric  syndromes 
and  other  conditions  not  in  the  Charlson’s  comorbidity 
index that could also influence survival.

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  published  longi-
tudinal  study  carried  out  in  a  memory  clinic  in  Africa, 
describing  dementia  subtypes,  cognitive  decline,  and 

survival over a 10-year period. The strengths of the study 
include  the  categorization  of  dementia  using  validated 
diagnostic criteria as well as obtaining complete survival 
data with a mean follow up period of 7.2 years. The study 
cohort was, however, a specific group of people referred 
to  a  memory  clinic  and  so  the  results  are  not  generaliz-
able to all people with dementia in the community.

The study was retrospective. We depended on the data 
collected  at  the  time  and  the  clinicians’  notes.  Clearly  a 
prospective study with a data collection protocol set up in 
advance would have considerably reduced the number of 
exclusions (93 in total) we had to make for missing data. 
We excluded 21 patients with advanced dementia (Fig. 3). 
These exclusions would have affected dementia sub-type 
proportions and survival outcomes. However, determin-
ing dementia sub-type in advanced disease would be dif-
ficult  anyway.  The  use  of  MMSE  has  several  limitations 
including floor and ceiling effects as well as cultural and 
linguistic validity concerns.

Another  important  limitation  was  not  having  clini-
cal diagnoses validated by autopsy which is the ultimate 
reference standard for dementia diagnosis. However, we 
used diagnostic criteria that have been validated in some 
post-mortem brain studies [62].

Conclusion
In  conclusion,  we  have  reported  comparable  propor-
tions of dementia subtypes and their characteristics from 
this 10-year longitudinal memory clinic cohort in South 
Africa.  We  describe  cognitive  decline  of  some  dementia 
subtypes  and  factors  affecting  cognitive  scores  such  as 
dementia subtype and education level. There was a high 
death  rate  in  this  cohort,  comparable  to  other  similar 
populations. The factors associated with shorter survival 
included  DLB/PDD  group,  older  age  of  symptom  onset, 
lower baseline cognition, and higher comorbidity scores. 
Females were associated with increased survival.

Future  longitudinal  studies  in  Africa  could  explore 
dementia subtype proportions for younger onset demen-
tia  subtypes  and  cognitive  decline  of  specific  dementia 
subtypes like FTD, which we were unable to analyze due 
to  a  smaller  number  of  participants.  There  is  a  further 
need  to  assess  other  known  predictors  of  mortality  like 
neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  polypharmacy,  and  func-
tional  impairment  including  how  activity  of  daily  living 
scores or carer burden change over time in larger longi-
tudinal memory clinic studies in Africa. An early reliable 
dementia  subtype  diagnosis  and  knowledge  of  survival 
outcomes is important where complex investigations may 
be lacking but where potential disease-modifying therapies 
may become available in the future.
