Background

A B S T R A C T

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare, chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease with a prevalence varying from 4.3 to 150 people
in 100,000, or approximately five million people worldwide. Systemic manifestations frequently include internal organ involvement, a
characteristic malar rash on the face, pain in joints and muscles, and profound fatigue. Exercise is purported to be beneficial for people
with SLE. For this review, we focused on studies that examined all types of structured exercise as an adjunctive therapy in the management
of SLE.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of structured exercise as adjunctive therapy for adults with SLE compared with usual pharmacological
care, usual pharmacological care plus placebo and usual pharmacological care plus non-pharmacological care.

Search methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 30 March 2022.

Selection criteria

We  included  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  of  exercise  as  an  adjunct  to  usual  pharmacological  treatment  in  SLE  compared  with
placebo,  usual  pharmacological  care  alone  and  another  non-pharmacological  treatment.  Major  outcomes  were  fatigue,  functional
capacity, disease activity, quality of life, pain, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to any reason, including any adverse events.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our major outcomes were 1. fatigue, 2. functional capacity, 3. disease activity, 4. quality of life, 5.
pain, 6. serious adverse events, and 7. withdrawals due to any reason. Our minor outcomes were 8. responder rate, 9. aerobic fitness, 10.
depression, and 11. anxiety. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. The primary comparison was exercise compared with placebo.

Main results

We  included  13  studies  (540  participants)  in  this  review.  Studies  compared  exercise  as  an  adjunct  to  usual  pharmacological  care
(antimalarials,  immunosuppressants,  and  oral  glucocorticoids)  with  usual  pharmacological  care  plus  placebo  (one  study);  usual
pharmacological care (six studies); and another non-pharmacological treatment such as relaxation therapy (seven studies). Most studies

had selection bias, and all studies had performance and detection bias. We downgraded the evidence for all comparisons because of a
high risk of bias and imprecision.

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus placebo plus usual pharmacological care

Evidence  from  a  single  small  study  (17  participants)  that  compared  whole  body  vibration  exercise  to  whole  body  placebo  vibration
exercise (vibrations switched off) indicated that exercise may have little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and pain (low-certainty
evidence). We are uncertain whether exercise results in fewer or more withdrawals (very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report
disease activity, quality of life, and serious adverse events.

The study measured fatigue using the self-reported Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue), scale 0
to 52; lower score means less fatigue. People who did not exercise rated their fatigue at 38 points and those who did exercise rated their
fatigue at 33 points (mean difference (MD) 5 points lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.29 lower to 3.29 higher).

The  study  measured  functional  capacity  using  the  self-reported  36-item  Short  Form  health  questionnaire  (SF-36)  Physical  Function
domain, scale 0 to 100; higher score means better function. People who did not exercise rated their functional capacity at 70 points and
those who did exercise rated their functional capacity at 67.5 points (MD 2.5 points lower, 95% CI 23.78 lower to 18.78 higher).

The study measured pain using the SF-36 Pain domain, scale 0 to 100; lower scores mean less pain. People who did not exercise rated their
pain at 43 points and those who did exercise rated their pain at 34 points (MD 9 points lower, 95% CI 28.88 lower to 10.88 higher).

More participants from the exercise group (3/11, 27%) withdrew from the study than the placebo group (1/10, 10%) (risk ratio (RR) 2.73,
95% CI 0.34 to 22.16).

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus usual pharmacological care alone

The addition of exercise to usual pharmacological care may have little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and disease activity (low-
certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether the addition of exercise improves pain (very low-certainty evidence), or results in fewer or
more withdrawals (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events and quality of life were not reported.

Exercise  plus  usual  care  versus  another  non-pharmacological  intervention  such  as  receiving  information  about  the  disease  or
relaxation therapy

Compared with education or relaxation therapy, exercise may reduce fatigue slightly (low-certainty evidence), may improve functional
capacity (low-certainty evidence), probably results in little to no difference in disease activity (moderate-certainty evidence), and may
result in little to no difference in pain (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether exercise results in fewer or more withdrawals
(very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life and serious adverse events were not reported.

Authors' conclusions

Due to low- to very low-certainty evidence, we are not confident on the benefits of exercise on fatigue, functional capacity, disease activity,
and pain, compared with placebo, usual care, or advice and relaxation therapy. Harms data were not well reported.

What are the benefits and risks of exercise for people with systemic lupus erythematosus?

Key messages

Exercise  in  addition  to  'usual  care'  may  have  little  benefit  on  fatigue,  functional  capacity,  and  pain  in  people  with  systemic  lupus
erythematosus (SLE).

No studies reported side effects during exercise. However, we have low confidence in the overall evidence.

What is systemic lupus erythematosus?

SLE (or 'lupus') is a disease in which the body's immune (defence) system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. It is a
long-term disease (one that lasts longer than six weeks and is usually life-long). Often, SLE causes pain in joints and muscles, and extreme
tiredness. Symptoms can improve temporarily, or worsen suddenly (flares).

How is systemic lupus erythematosus treated?

Management or usual care in SLE may include, but is not limited to, treatment with medicines such as disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It may also include treatments that are not medicines such as sun
avoidance, supplementation (i.e. vitamin D), education about the disease and other illnesses (i.e. hypertension), and physical activity or
exercise. Regular exercise training could serve as an adjunct treatment for people with SLE.

What did we want to find out?

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We wanted to find out if exercise in addition to usual care improved fatigue, functional capacity (ability to perform normal everyday tasks),
quality of life, pain, and disease activity, and caused no harm.

What did we do?

We searched for studies that investigated structured exercise programmes such as aerobic exercise, resistance, stretching or combinations
of these (including a specific dosage of exercise, e.g. frequency, intensity, time, type)  in addition to usual care compared with placebo
(pretend medicine), usual care alone, or another non-medicine intervention (e.g. relaxation therapy) in people with SLE.

We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods
and sizes.

What did we find?

We found 13 studies that involved 540 participants with SLE that included a structured exercise programme that lasted up to 12 weeks in
duration. Usual care included DMARDs and glucocorticoids.

The main results of the review are:

1. Whole body vibration exercise plus usual care may result in little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and pain when compared
to whole body placebo vibration exercise (vibration switched off) plus usual care (1 study, 17 participants).

The study measured fatigue using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue domain (FACIT-Fatigue) (0 to 52 scale, where
0 means no fatigue) and, at 12 weeks, fatigue improved by 5 points in the exercise group compared to the group that did not exercise:

– People who exercised rated their fatigue at 33 points.

– People who did not exercise rated their fatigue at 38 points.

The study measured functional capacity using the Functional Capacity domain in the 36-item Short Form health questionnaire (SF-36) (0 to
100 scale, where 100 means best function) and, at 12 weeks, function worsened by 2.5 points in the exercise group compared to the group
that did not exercise:

– People who exercised rated their functional capacity at 67.5 points.

– People who did not exercise rated their functional capacity at 70 points.

The study measured pain on the Pain domain of the SF-36 (0 to 100 scale, where 0 means no pain) and, at 12 weeks, pain improved by 9 points
in the exercise group compared to the group that did not exercise:

– People who exercised rated their pain at 34 points.

– People who did not exercise rated their pain at 43 points.

More people from the exercise group (27%) withdrew from the study compared those in the placebo group (10%).

The study did not measure disease activity or quality of life.

2. Exercise plus usual care may result in little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and disease activity when compared to usual care
alone. And we are uncertain whether exercise improves pain when compared to usual care alone.

3. Exercise plus usual care may reduce fatigue, improve functional capacity, and probably results in little to no difference in disease activity,
and may result in little to no difference in pain when compared to another non-medicine intervention plus usual care.

No studies reported any serious side effects that were related to the exercise programme during or following the intervention.

What are the limitations of the evidence?

We have little confidence in the evidence because the number of studies was very small, and it is possible that people in the studies were
aware of which treatment they were getting.

Most studies assessed the effectiveness of exercise for a short duration (12 weeks or less) and it is unclear if people would adhere to exercise
over time. More rigorous studies of structured exercise over a period of time longer than 12 weeks are needed to improve our confidence
in the benefits and safety of exercise in people with SLE.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Description of the condition

Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  is  a  chronic  autoimmune
inflammatory  disease  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  clinical  and
serological  manifestations  caused  by  autoantibody  production,
complement  activation,  and  immune  complex  deposition.  The
pathogenesis  of  SLE 
is  characterised  by  the  formation  of
autoantibodies and a breakdown in the immune milieu of the body
leading to an unregulated inflammatory response and consequent
internal  organ  and  tissue  damage  (Fanouriakis  2019).  Systemic
manifestations  frequently  include  internal  organ  involvement,
a  characteristic  malar  rash  on  the  face,  sicca  symptoms,  and
profound  fatigue.  People  with  SLE  experience  multiple,  varied
symptoms  and  laboratory  abnormalities  that  occur  in  different
combinations,  at  different  time  points.  SLE  is  heterogeneous,
meaning that symptoms vary widely from one person to the next,
for  example,  one  person  may  develop  a  rash,  while  another  may
have high blood pressure, joint pain, and anaemia. Although SLE
constitutes  the  most  common  form  of  lupus,  which  is  the  broad
term  to  describe  the  disease,  there  are  other  forms  of  lupus
which  include  discoid  lupus  erythematosus  (DLE)  or  cutaneous
lupus  erythematosus  (CLE),  characterised  by  mostly  cutaneous
involvement (Fanouriakis 2019).

SLE  is  a  rare  disease  with  an  incidence  of  approximately  1  to  10
per 100,000 person-years and a prevalence varying from 4.3 to 150
people  in  100,000  (Nikpour  2014),  or  approximately  five  million
people worldwide. The prevalence in Australia varies between 19.3
and 39 people in 100,000 for non-Aboriginal Australians and 52.0 to
92.8 people in 100,000 for Aboriginal Australians (Bossingham 2003;
Segasothy 2001). There is a higher SLE incidence in Asian (especially
Chinese),  African,  and  Hispanic  populations.  These  last  two
populations  are  especially  associated  with  high  disease  activity
and  damage.  SLE  can  affect  both  men  and  women  of  any  age,
with  90%  being  female.  It  predominantly  affects  young  women
and middle-aged women, between the ages of 15 and 45 years. By
age, the female:male ratio is 3:1 before puberty, 10 to 15:1 during
childbearing years, with a slight decrease again after menopause at
8:1 (Askanase 2012).

SLE  has  a  severe  and  pervasive  effect  on  people  living  with  the
disease,  with  people  reporting  the  disease  to  cause  debilitating
fatigue;  mental  deterioration;  pervasive  pain;  disrupted  identity
from feeling of hopelessness, guilt and punishment, or feeling as
though they are a burden (Sutanto 2013). In contrast, some people
have also reported the disease to have increased their resilience,
empowerment,  and  optimism.  Debilitating  pain,  musculoskeletal
manifestations,  fatigue,  and  renal  and  cutaneous  problems  were
reported to limit people's ability to work and participate in family
and social activities (Sutanto 2013).

People  with  SLE  are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  comorbidities
such as osteoporosis (Gu 2020) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease  (CVD)  (Manzi  1997;  Schoenfeld  2013).  CVD  risk  amongst
people  with  SLE  compared  to  the  general  population  is  at
least  doubled.  While  older  people  with  SLE  appear  to  have  the
highest  absolute  risks  of  CVD,  young  women  have  alarmingly
high  relative  risks,  given  the  rarity  of  CVD  in  the  comparable
general  population  (Schoenfeld  2013).  People  with  SLE  are
also  less  physically  active  than  people  without  SLE  (Margiotta
2018),  with  60%  of  people  not  meeting  sufficient  physical

biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such
as rituximab  or belimumab; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs)  such  as  naproxen  or  celecoxib  (Fanouriakis  2019).    It
may  also  include  non-pharmacological  measures  such  as  sun
avoidance;  supplementation  (i.e.  vitamin  D);  education  about
the  disease  or  comorbidities  (i.e.  hypertension),  or  both;  and
physical  activity  or  exercise  (Fanouriakis  2019).  Regular  exercise
training could serve as an adjunct treatment for people with SLE
to  reduce  the  risk  of  developing  secondary  complications,  help
manage symptoms related to the disease, and improve key clinical
outcomes such as quality of life and fatigue.

Description of the intervention

The  treatment  for  SLE  depends  on  the  organs  and  systems
involved  as  well  as  disease  severity.  It  can  include  topical
applications  for  skin  problems,  NSAIDs  for  musculoskeletal
diseases,  and  immunosuppression.  Common  medications  to
treat  the  inflammatory  response  associated  with  subsequent
widespread  organ  involvement  include  corticosteroids,  immune
suppressants,  hydroxychloroquine,  and  biological  agents  (Ali
2018).

Exercise  is  generally  used  as  an  adjunct  to  pharmacological
management  of  SLE  (Yorganci  2020).  For  this  review,  we  focused
on  studies  that  examined  all  types  of  structured  exercise  as  an
adjunctive therapy in the management of SLE. Evidence suggests
that  exercise  interventions  are  safe,  with  no  change  in  disease
activity  or  adverse  events,  and  effective  in  managing  key  clinical
outcomes  such  as  fatigue  (Del  Pino-Sedeno  2016;  O'Dwyer  2017;
Wu 2017; Yuen 2014). According to the American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM), exercise is defined as a type of physical activity
consisting of planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement
done to improve or maintain (or both) one or more components of
physical fitness (Pescatello 2014).

The  three  main  types  of  exercise  include  aerobic,  resistance,
and  range  of  movement.  Aerobic  exercise  relies  primarily  on  the
cardiovascular  system  and  represents  a  broad  range  of  physical
activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, and dancing (Pescatello
2014). Resistance exercise can be provided via specifically designed
equipment such as resistance bands, hand weights, and machines,
or  achieved  via  functional  means  such  as  stair  climbing,  rising
from a chair, and lifting groceries to induce muscular contraction,
which builds the strength, anaerobic endurance, and size of skeletal
muscles  (Pescatello  2014).  Range  of  motion  exercise  refers  to
activity aimed to improve movement of a specific joint, for example,
yoga, tai chi, or stretching (Pescatello 2014). Exercise intensity may
be high (70% to less than 90% of heart rate maximum (HRmax) or a
rating of perceived exertion (RPE) value of 5/10 to 7/10), moderate

(55% to less than 70% HRmax or an RPE value of 3/10 to 4/10), or
light (40% to less than 55% HRmax OR an RPE value of 1/10 to 2/10).

Nicholson 1989; Tench 2003). Most of these studies were at risk of
selection and reporting bias.

The  exercise  intervention  may  be  supervised  by  allied  health
practitioners,  medical  health  practitioners,  or  other  exercise
professionals, and can be individually supervised or supervised in a
group setting, or it can be completely unsupervised and performed
independently. Unsupervised exercise is usually reported as home-
based exercise, but can also include exercising in a park or in a gym
without  supervision.  While  people  with  SLE  are  advised  to  avoid
sun exposure, which may limit their interest or raise concern about
exercise, it is important to know that not all exercise is performed
outdoors. The exercise environment may be water-based (indoors
or outdoors), land-based (indoors or outdoors), in a gym or clinic,
outdoors at a park or along a walking or bike track, or in ones' home
(Pescatello 2014).

How the intervention might work

Regular  exercise  training  may  lead  to  anti-inflammatory  benefits
in  chronic  diseases  with  systemic  low-grade  inflammation  (i.e.
type  2  diabetes)  by  reducing  inflammatory  markers  (Perandini
2012),  and  is  regarded  as  a  valuable  self-care  intervention  for
this  population.  Given  the  potential  role  of  inflammation  in
the  aetiology  and  clinical  symptoms  of  SLE,  including  pain,
redness,  and  swelling,  if  exercise  training  is  able  to  alleviate  the
inflammatory process, it could be a helpful intervention in treating
the  symptoms  related  to  inflammation  in  SLE  (Perandini  2012).
Exercise  is  beneficial  in  reducing  fatigue  (Del  Pino-Sedeno  2016;
Neill 2006; Wu 2017; Yuen 2014), improving symptoms of depression
(Da  Hora  2019;  Kelley  2015),  and  improving  quality  of  life  (Da
Hora 2019; Sieczkowskaa 2020). The benefits of exercise are similar
in  other  rheumatic,  inflammatory  conditions  with  improvements
in  quality  of  life  (Sieczkowskaa  2020),  reduced  inflammation
(Metsios  2020;  Perandini  2012),  and  reduced  joint  damage  and
symptoms (Sveaas 2017). Importantly, it is suggested that exercise
does not deleteriously affect disease activity (O'Dwyer 2017), and
positively influences fatigue (O'Dwyer 2017; Wu 2017; Yuen 2014),
which is a significant concern for most people with SLE. As such,
exercise  could  serve  as  an  adjunct  non-pharmaceutical  therapy
for  people  with  SLE  to  assist  in  the  management  of  disease-
related symptoms such as fatigue and pain, as well as preventing
comorbidities such as osteoporosis and CVD.

Why it is important to do this review

To date, there are currently three systematic reviews that assess the
safety and effectiveness of exercise in adults with SLE, two of which
were published in 2017 and one in 2021 (O'Dwyer 2017; Wu 2017;
Lu 2021).

The  first  review  found  exercise  improved  depression  and  fatigue
and not alter disease activity in adults with SLE compared to control
groups (O'Dwyer 2017). Meta-analyses of seven studies found that
disease  activity  was  unchanged  following  exercise  interventions
(mean  difference  (MD)  0.01,  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  −0.54
to  0.56),  fatigue  decreased  in  the  exercise  intervention  group
compared  to  controls  (MD  −0.52,  95%  CI  −0.91  to  −0.13),  and
depression  scores  decreased  in  the  exercise  groups  compared  to
the controls (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.40 standard
deviations  (SD),  95%  CI  −0.71  to  −0.09)  (Abrahão  2016;  Boström
2016;  Carvalho  2005;  Dos  Reis-Neto    2013;  Miossi  2012;  Robb-

The  second  review  found  that  a  12-week  supervised  aerobic
exercise programme reduced fatigue for people with SLE with mild
disease  activity  (Wu  2017).  Meta-analysis  of  three  trials  showed
that aerobic exercise training decreased fatigue severity compared
to controls (MD −0.52, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.13), and had a positive
effect  on  the  36-item  Short  Form  (SF-36)  Vitality  subscale  (MD
14.98,  95%  CI  7.45  to  22.52)  (Carvalho  2005;  Ramsey-Goldman
2000; Tench 2003). However, the quality of evidence assessed using
PEDro  was  downgraded  to  fair  (Tench  2003)  or  poor  (Ramsey-
Goldman 2000).

The  third  review  found  that  exercise  improved  some  aspects  of
quality  of  life  in  people  with  SLE  (Lu  2021).  Meta-analysis  of  five
RCTs showed a positive effect of exercise on the physical health and
function  aspect  (SF-36  Physical  Function  and  LupusQOL  Physical
Health)  of  health-related  quality  of  life  amongst  participants
with  SLE  (Hedges'  g  0.468,  95%  CI  0.206  to  0.730;  P  <  0.001).
Heterogeneity  between  studies  was  low  (I2  =  19.2%;  P  =  0.292)
(Abrahão 2016; Bostrom 2016; Keramiotou 2020; Lopes-Souza 2021;
Tench 2003).

These  three  reviews  found  that  exercise  is  effective  in  managing
concerning  symptoms  of  SLE  including  fatigue,  depression,  and
some aspects of qualify of life. However, more studies with more
participants  are  needed  to  strengthen  these  results,  and  the
optimal  exercise  protocol  is  yet  to  be  determined.  Therefore,
it  is  important  to  perform  this  systematic  review  to  capture
any  additional  trials,  update  the  existing  evidence,  and  identify
the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  exercise  in  adults  with  SLE.  We
conducted the review according to the guidelines recommended by
the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Editorial Board (Ghogomu 2014).

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We  included  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and  quasi-RCTs.
We included parallel and cross-over trials, and cluster-RCTs, using
either non-intervention or active controls. There were no language
restrictions.  We  included  abstracts  and  studies  with  unpublished
data.

Types of participants

We included trials of adults (aged 18 years or greater), diagnosed
with SLE according to the study author's report; American College
of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  criteria  or  European  League  Against
Rheumatism  (EULAR)  criteria  (or  both),  with  systemic  disease
involving  at  least  two  body  sites  or  organ  systems.  We  excluded
trials of participants with SLE and another diagnosed condition in
different groups (i.e. group one = people with SLE, group 2 = people
with  rheumatoid  arthritis)  if  the  effect  of  the  intervention  could

not be determined on the participants with SLE alone. We included
intervention trials without regard to race, sex, or disease duration
of participants.

Types of interventions

Structured exercise 

Adjunct  to  usual  care,  an  intervention  consisting  of  structured
exercise  performed  at  any  duration,  frequency,  intensity,  and  of
any type was included. The type of exercise intervention included
either  an  individual  type  of  exercise  or  a  combination  of  various
types (e.g. resistance training alone or resistance training combined
with  aerobic  training).  Exercise  interventions  were  structured,
recurring, and prescriptions included specific dosage information
(i.e.  frequency,  intensity,  timing,  type).  Aerobic  exercise  could
include, but was not limited to, walking (treadmill or free), cycling
(stationary  or  free),  swimming,  or  aerobics  classes.  Range  of
movement  exercise  could  include  Pilates;  yoga;  tai  chi;  or  active,
ballistic,  and  static  stretching.  Other  forms  of  exercise  such  as
sports,  games,  and  recreational  activities  such  as  dancing,  lawn
bowls, and Wii fit could be included. Exercise environments could
include water- or, land-based exercise, indoor or outdoor settings,
home-based or community led, supervised or unsupervised, face-
to-face or telehealth.

Usual pharmacological care

Usual  pharmacological  care  could  include,  but  was  not  limited
to,  the  following  standard  pharmacological  drug  treatments;
antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids
such as prednisone, immunosuppressives such as mycophenolate,
and  biologicals  such  as  belimumab  or  rituximab.  Other  non-
pharmacological measures may also have included sun avoidance,
commonly  prescribed  supplementation  (i.e.  vitamin  D),  and
education  about  the  disease  or  managing  comorbidities  such  as
hypertension, for example (Fanouriakis 2019).

Comparisons

We  included  any  RCT  that  evaluated  the  effect  of  exercise  as  an
adjunct therapy to usual care, compared to:

1. usual pharmacological care plus placebo;
2. usual pharmacological care alone;
3. usual pharmacological care plus another intervention that was
non-pharmacological  (e.g.  relaxation,  counselling,  education,
support group).

We excluded studies if the exercise intervention was not structured
(i.e. the exercise intervention did not have a dosage for frequency,
intensity, or duration of exercise) or if the exercise intervention was
an  acute  or  single  bout  of  exercise  (i.e.  one  individual  session  of
exercise or one exercise test).

Types of outcome measures

Studies were not excluded on the basis of outcome reporting.

Major outcomes

1. Fatigue: mean or mean change in fatigue assessed by Fatigue
Severity  Scale  (FSS),  Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness
Therapy  –  Fatigue  (FACIT-F)  (FACIT  group;  Lai  2011),  or  other
relevant fatigue scales such as Profile Of Moods State (POMS).

the 36-item Short-Form (SF-36), or Physical Function subscale of
the SF-36, or other physical function or disability scales.

3. Disease  activity:  mean  or  mean  change  in  SLE  scores  on
validated  disease  activity  indices  such  as  the  Systemic  Lupus
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus  Disease  Activity  Index  SELENA  Modification
(SELENA-SLEDAI),  modified  SELENA-SLEDAI  Flare  Index  (SFI)
(Petri  1999;  Petri  2005);  British  Isles  Lupus  Assessment  Group
index  (BILAG)  (Hay  1993;  Isenberg  2000);  or  other  similar
validated indices.

4. Quality of life: mean or mean change in quality of life assessed
by the Mental Component Score (MCS) of the SF-36, or similar
assessments such as Lupus Quality Of Life (LupusQOL) (Doward
2009; McElhone 2007).

5. Pain:  mean  or  mean  change  in  pain  measured  by  the  Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, the numerical rating scale (NRS)
for pain, or the Bodily Pain subscale of the SF-36.

6. Serious adverse events (SAEs): including number of SAEs, or

number of people with one or more SAE.

7. Withdrawals due to any reason

Minor outcomes

1. Composite responder rate, as defined with the Systemic lupus
erythematosus  Responder  Index  (SRI),  where  a  responder  is
defined as a person with
a. a 4-point or greater reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score;
b. no new BILAG A or no more than one new BILAG B domain

score; and

c. no  deterioration  from  baseline  in  the  physician's  global

assessment by 0.3 points or greater (Furie 2009).

2. Aerobic  capacity:  mean  or  mean  change  in  aerobic  capacity
assessed  by  predicted  or  absolute  value  of  maximum  rate  of
oxygen consumption (VO2max).

3. Depression: mean or mean change in depression assessed by
Beck-Depression Index (BDI) or other relevant depression scales
such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

4. Anxiety: mean or mean change in anxiety assessed using HADS

or other relevant anxiety scales.

We  analysed  all  exercise  interventions  in  the  pooled  primary
analysis.  For  efficacy  outcomes,  we  extracted  data  from  the  end
of intervention time point. We defined the end of intervention as
the time when the structured exercise intervention had completed.
We  extracted  adverse  event  outcomes  at  the  last  time  point  (i.e.
proportion who had an event by the end of the trial).

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We  searched  Cochrane  Central  Register  of  Controlled  Trials
(CENTRAL),  MEDLINE  Ovid,  Embase  Ovid,  CINAHL  (EBSCO),
SPORTDiscus (EBSCO), and Web of Science. We also conducted a
search  of  ClinicalTrials.gov  (www.clinicaltrials.gov)  and  the  WHO
trials  portal  (www.who.int/ictrp/en/).  We  searched  all  databases
from  their  inception  to  30  March  2022,  and  we  imposed  no
restriction on language of publication.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two  review  authors  (SF,  EN)  independently  screened  titles  and
abstracts  for  inclusion  of  all  the  potentially  relevant  studies

we  identified  as  a  result  of  the  search,  and  coded  them  as
'retrieved'  (eligible  or  potentially  eligible/unclear)  or  'did  not
retrieve'. We retrieved the full-text study reports/publications and
two review authors (SF, EN) independently screened the full texts
and  identified  studies  for  inclusion,  and  identified  and  recorded
reasons  for  exclusion  of  the  ineligible  studies.  We  resolved  any
disagreements  through  discussion  with  a  third  review  author
(MC).  We  identified  and  excluded  duplicates.  We  recorded  the
selection  process  in  sufficient  detail  to  complete  a  PRISMA  flow
diagram  (Figure  1;  PRISMA  Group  2009;  prisma-statement.org/
PRISMAStatement/Default.aspx).

Data extraction and management

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two  review  authors  (SF,  EN)  extracted  the  following  study
characteristics from included studies.

1. Methods: study design, total duration of study, number of study
centres  and  location,  study  setting,  withdrawals,  and  date  of
study.

2. Participants:  number,  mean  age,  age  range,  sex,  disease
duration,  severity  of  condition,  diagnostic  criteria,  important
SLE baseline data, medication, inclusion criteria, and exclusion
criteria.

3. Interventions:

including type, frequency, intensity, and duration of the exercise
intervention  was

supervised. This was assessed using the Consensus on Exercise
Reporting  Template  (CERT):  Explanation  and  Elaboration
Statement (bjsm.bmj.com/content/50/23/1428Slade 2016).
4. Outcomes: major and minor outcomes specified and collected,

and time points reported.

5. Characteristics  of  the  design  of  the  trial  as  outlined  in  the

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section.

6. Notes: funding for trial, and notable declarations of interest of

trial authors.

Two  review  authors  (SF,  MC)  independently  extracted  outcome
data  from  included  studies.  We  extracted  the  number  of  events
and number of participants per treatment group for dichotomous
outcomes,  and  means,  SDs,  and  number  of  participants  per
treatment  group  for  continuous  outcomes.  We  noted  in  the
Characteristics of included studies table if outcome data were not
reported  in  a  usable  way  and  when  data  were  transformed  or
estimated from a graph. We resolved disagreements by consensus
or by involving a third review author (SO). One review author (SF)
transferred data into RevMan Web. We double-checked that data
were  entered  correctly  by  comparing  the  data  presented  in  the
systematic review with the study reports.

If  more  than  one  measure  for  an  outcome  was  reported,  we
extracted only the one reported by most of the included trials (i.e.
FSS for fatigue). In the event of multiple outcome reporting, if both
final values and change from baseline values were reported for the
same  outcome,  we  extracted  the  final  values,  as  reported  in  the
publication. Similarly, if data were analysed based on an intention-
to-treat  (ITT)  sample  and  another  sample  (e.g.  per-protocol,  as-
treated), we extracted the ITT sample for both outcomes assessing
benefits and outcomes assessing harms. If data for more than one
time point were provided, we used the 'end of structured exercise
intervention' time point for the meta-analysis.

Two  review  authors  (SF,  MC)  independently  assessed  risk  of  bias
using  the  RoB  1  tool  for  each  study  using  the  criteria  outlined
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Chapter  8;  Higgins  2011).  We  resolved  any  disagreements  by
discussion  or  by  involving  other  review  authors  (SO,  DG).  We
assessed the risk of bias according to the following domains.

1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants and personnel.
4. Blinding of outcome assessment.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias (potential threats to validity such as unit of analysis
issues, inappropriate or unequal application of co-intervention
across treatment groups).

We  graded  each  potential  source  of  bias  as  high,  low,  or  unclear
risk,  and  provided  a  quote  from  the  study  report  together  with
a  justification  for  our  judgement  in  the  risk  of  bias  table.  We
summarised  the  risk  of  bias  judgements  across  different  studies
for each of the domains listed. We considered blinding separately
for  different  key  outcomes  where  necessary  (e.g.  for  unblinded
outcome assessment, risk of bias for objective outcome measures
which  may  be  different  from  a  participant-reported  scale).  In
addition,  we  considered  the  impact  of  missing  data  by  key
outcomes.

Where information on risk of bias related to unpublished data or
correspondence with a trialist, we noted this in the risk of bias table.

When considering treatment effects, we considered the risk of bias
for the studies that contributed to that outcome.

We  presented  the  figures  generated  by  the  RoB  1  tool  to  provide
summary assessments of the risk of bias.

Assessment of bias in conducting the systematic review

We  conducted  the  review  according  to  the  published  protocol
(Frade 2021), and reported any deviations from it in the Differences
between protocol and review section.

Measures of treatment effect

We  analysed  dichotomous  data  as  RRs  when  the  outcome  was
a  rare  event  (approximately  less  than  10%),  with  95%  CIs.  We
analysed continuous data as MD (if studies use the same scale) or
SMD (if studies use different scales) with 95% CIs. We entered data
presented  as  a  scale  with  a  consistent  direction  of  effect  across
studies.

Better health.

When studies used different scales to measure the same conceptual
outcome  (e.g.  disability),  we  calculated  SMDs  instead,  with
corresponding 95% CIs. We back-translated SMDs to a typical scale
(e.g. 0 to 10 for pain) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among-
person  SD  (e.g.  the  SD  of  the  control  group  at  baseline  from  the
most representative trial) as recommended in Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2020a).

We  assumed  a  minimal  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  of
1.5  points  in  a  10-point  Likert  scale  for  pain;  and  10  points  on  a
100-point Likert scale for function or disability into the calculator.
Using a cross-sectional approach (Goligher 2008) derived 5.9 points
as  the  MCID  for  the  FACIT-Fatigue  scale  in  people  with  SLE.  The
MCID for the FSS has been reported as a decrease of 1 point on the
7-point scale (Nordin 2016). The MCID for LupusQOL is estimated
using  an  anchor-based  approach  as  mean  changes  in  LupusQOL
domains  when  minimal  change  (deterioration  =  −3  or  −2  points;
improvement = 2 or 3 points) (McElhone 2016). SF-36 score can be
expressed in two subscores according to the domains they explore:
a  PCS  and  an  MCS.  We  considered  3.74  for  PCS  and  1.7  for  MCS
as minimal important differences (Leung 2011). For measures with
no previously reported clinically important threshold, we used the
SMD interpretation where values greater than 0.8 were considered
clinically  significant  (large  effect).  A  change  of  4  points  on  the
SLEDAI scale is considered the MCID; however, this has not yet been
well established (Brunner 2010).

For  dichotomous  outcomes,  we  calculated  the  absolute  percent
change from  the  difference in the risks between the intervention
and  control  groups  using  GRADEpro  GDT  and  expressed  as  a
percentage (GRADEpro GDT).

For  continuous  outcomes,  we  calculated  the  absolute  percent
change by dividing the MD by the scale of the measure.

Unit of analysis issues

Where a single trial reported multiple trial arms, we included only
the relevant arms. If two comparisons (e.g. exercise programme 1
and exercise programme 2 versus placebo) were combined in the
same meta-analysis, we combined the two exercise groups into one
intervention to avoid double-counting. We listed all treatment arms
in the Characteristics of included studies table, even if they were
not used in the review.

We analysed non-standard designs (i.e. cluster-RCTs and crossover
RCTs)  using  methods  appropriate  to  the  design  as  suggested  in
Sections  23.1.4,  23.1.5,  and  23.2.5  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2020b).

Dealing with missing data

We  contacted  investigators  or  study  sponsors  to  verify  key  study
characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where
possible  (e.g.  when  data  were  not  available  for  all  participants).
Where  this  was  not  possible,  and  the  missing  data  were  thought
to  introduce  serious  bias,  we  explored  the  impact  of  including
such studies in the overall assessment of results using a sensitivity
analysis. We described any assumptions and imputations to handle
missing data and explored the effect of imputation using sensitivity
analyses.

For  dichotomous  outcomes  (e.g.  number  of  withdrawals  due
to  adverse  events),  we  calculated  the  withdrawal  rate  using

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

the  number  of  participants  randomised  in  the  group  as  the
denominator.

For  continuous  outcomes  (e.g.  mean  change  in  pain  score),  we
calculated  the  MD  or  SMD  based  on  the  number  of  participants
analysed at that time point. If the number of participants analysed
was  not  presented  for  each  time  point,  we  used  the  number  of
randomised participants in each group at baseline.

Where  possible,  we  computed  missing  SDs  from  other  statistics
such as standard errors, CIs, or P values, according to the methods
recommended  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews
of  Interventions  (Chapter  10;  Deeks  2020).  If  SDs  could  not  be
calculated, we imputed them (e.g. from other studies in the meta-
analysis) (Deeks 2020).

Assessment of heterogeneity

We  assessed  clinical  and  methodological  diversity  in  terms  of
participants, interventions, outcomes, and study characteristics for
the  included  studies  to  determine  whether  a  meta-analysis  was
appropriate.  This  was  conducted  by  observing  these  data  from
the data extraction tables. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by
visual inspection of the forest plot to assess obvious differences in
results  between  the  studies,  and  using  the  I2  and  Chi2  statistical
tests.

As recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of  Interventions  (Chapter  10;  Deeks  2020),  the  interpretation  of
an  I2  value  of  0%  to  40%  might  'not  be  important';  30%  to
60%  may  represent  'moderate'  heterogeneity;  50%  to  90%  may
represent 'substantial' heterogeneity; and 75% to 100% represents
'considerable' heterogeneity. We kept in mind that the importance
of  the  I2  statistic  depends  on:  magnitude  and  direction  of  effects
and strength of evidence for heterogeneity.

The Chi2 test was interpreted where a P ≤ 0.10 indicated evidence
of statistical heterogeneity.

If  we  identified  substantial  heterogeneity,  we  reported  it  and
investigated  possible  causes  by  following  the  recommendations
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Chapter 10; Deeks 2020).

Assessment of reporting biases

We  created  and  examined  a  funnel  plot  to  explore  possible
small-study biases. In interpreting funnel plots, we examined the
different  possible  reasons  for  funnel  plot  asymmetry  as  outlined
in  Chapter  13  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews
of Interventions and related this to the results of the review (Page
2020). If we were able to pool more than 10 trials, we undertook
formal  statistical  tests  to  investigate  funnel  plot  asymmetry,  and
followed  the  recommendations  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 13; Page 2020).

To  assess  outcome  reporting  bias,  we  checked  trial  protocols
against published reports. For studies published after 1 July 2005,
we screened the Clinical Trial Register at the International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform of the WHO (apps.who.int/trialssearch) for
the a priori trial protocol. We evaluated whether selective reporting
of outcomes was present.

Data synthesis

We undertook meta-analyses only where this was meaningful (i.e.
if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question
were  similar  enough  for  pooling  to  make  sense).  We  anticipated
that the following comparisons would be used.

1. Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus placebo
2. Exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  usual

pharmacological care

3. Exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  another
intervention (e.g. education about exercise, counselling about
exercise, relaxation exercises).

We used a random-effects model. We analysed all types of exercise
interventions in the pooled primary analysis.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

If there were sufficient data, we would have conducted subgroup
analyses  for  fatigue  according  to  components  of  exercise.  We
had  restricted  subgroup  analyses  to  the  primary  time  point.  We
anticipate that the following exercise components may be useful.

1. Types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, relaxing/range of motion)
2. Exercise  setting  (supervised  or  unsupervised/home-based

exercise)

The reason for including components of an exercise programme in
the subgroup analyses is to be able to identify an optimal exercise
for improving fatigue in people with SLE, which has been implicated
for  future  research  in  previous  reviews  (O'Dwyer  2017;  Wu  2017).
This  information  will  be  critical  for  informing  both  practitioners
and patients regarding the most appropriate exercise prescription.
Pooled evidence from three studies showed that aerobic exercise
training  significantly  decreased  fatigue  severity  compared  to
relaxing  exercise  (Carvalho  2005;  Ramsey-Goldman  2000;  Tench
2003),  and  supervised  exercise  reduced  fatigue  symptoms  to  a
significantly greater extent than home-based exercise (Wu 2017).

We  would  have  used  the  formal  test  for  subgroup  interactions
in  Review  Manager  Web  (RevMan  Web  2022),  and  use  caution  in
the interpretation of subgroup analyses as advised in Section 9.6
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(McKenzie 2021). We would compare the magnitude of the effects
between  the  subgroups  by  assessing  the  overlap  of  the  CIs  of
the summary estimate. Non-overlap of the CIs indicates statistical
significance.

Sensitivity analysis

We  planned  to  carry  out  the  following  sensitivity  analyses  to
investigate the robustness of the treatment effect on fatigue.

1. Impact of including studies with high or unclear risk of selection,

detection, and attrition biases

2. Impact of including studies with imputed data

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the
evidence

At  least  two  review  authors  (SF,  MC)  assessed  the  certainty  of
the supporting evidence behind each estimate of treatment effect
using  the  GRADE  approach  for  the  major  outcomes:  fatigue,
functional  capacity,  disease  activity,  quality  of  life,  pain,  serious

adverse  events,  and  withdrawals  due  to  any  reason.  We  used
methods and recommendations described in Cochrane Handbook
for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Chapter  14;  Schünemann
2020a). We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations,
consistency  of  effect,  imprecision,  indirectness,  and  publication
bias)  to  assess  the  certainty  of  a  body  of  evidence  as  it  relates
to the studies that contributed data to the meta-analyses for the
prespecified outcomes, and reported the certainty of evidence as
high, moderate, low, or very low.

We  used  GRADEpro  GDT  software  to  prepare  and  display  the
summary of findings tables. We justified all decisions to downgrade
the certainty of evidence for each outcome using footnotes, and we
made  comments  to  aid  the  reader's  understanding  of  the  review
where necessary. We provided the number needed to treat for an
additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH)
and  absolute  percent  change  in  the  'Comments'  column  of  the
summary of findings table.

We preselected the following important outcomes for inclusion in
the summary of findings tables.

1. Mean  or  mean  change  in  fatigue  assessed  by  FSS,  FACIT-F,  or

other relevant fatigue scales such as POMS.

2. Mean or mean change in functional capacity measured by the
PCS of the SF-36, or physical function subscale of the SF-36, or
other physical function or disability scales.

3. Mean or mean change in SLE scores on validated disease activity
indices such as the SLEDAI, SELENA-SLEDAI, modified SELENA-
SLEDAI SFI; BILAG; or other similar validated indices.

4. Mean or mean change in quality of life assessed by the MCS of

the SF-36, or similar assessments such as LupusQOL.

5. Mean or mean change in pain measured by VAS for pain, NRS for

pain, or the bodily pain subscale of the SF-36.

6. SAEs,  number  of  SAEs,  or  number  of  participants  with  one  or

more SAE.

7. Withdrawals due to any reason

We  produced  three  summary  of  findings  tables  for  the  following
comparisons.

1. Exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  placebo  plus

usual pharmacological care.

2. Exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  usual

pharmacological care.

3. Exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  another
intervention (e.g. education about exercise, counselling about
exercise, relaxation exercises) plus usual pharmacological care.

For efficacy outcomes, we extracted data at the end of intervention
time point. We extracted adverse event outcomes at the last time
point (i.e. proportion who had an event by the end of the trial).

Interpreting results and reaching conclusions

We  followed  the  guidelines  in  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews  of  Interventions  (Chapter  15;  Schünemann  2022b),  for
interpreting  results,  and  were  aware  of  distinguishing  a  lack  of
evidence of effect from a lack of effect. We based our conclusions
only  on  findings  from  the  quantitative  or  narrative  synthesis,
according  to  Synthesis  Without  Meta-analysis  (SWiM)  reporting
guideline of included studies for this review (Campbell 2020). Our

Description of studies

Details  of  the  included  studies  are  listed  in  Table  1  and  the
Characteristics of included studies table.

Results of the search

The  search  was  conducted  up  to  30  March  2022.  It  yielded  1613
records across six databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL,
SPORTDiscus,  and  Web  of  Science).  After  removal  of  duplicates,
1089  records  remained.  Of  these,  we  retrieved  41  for  full-text
screening  on  the  basis  of  title  and  abstract.  We  deemed  13  RCTs
eligible  for  inclusion  (Abrahão  2016;  Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;
Benatti  2018;  Bostrom  2016;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;
Hashemi  2022;  Kao  2021;  Keramiotou  2020;  Lopes-Souza  2021;
Miossi  2012;  Tench  2003).  We  excluded  27  articles,  one  trial  is
awaiting classification (Boedecker 2020), and there are no ongoing
studies. See Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram of search results
(Page 2021).

Included studies

Study design and setting

Studies were conducted in Brazil (7/13, 53%), Europe (3/13, 23%),
the US (1/13, 8%), the UK (1/13, 8%), and Iran (1/13, 8%), Six studies
were two-arm parallel RCTs (Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016; Daltroy
1995;  Hashemi  2022;  Keramiotou  2020;  Lopes-Souza  2021),  two
studies were two-arm parallel quasi-RCTS (Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao
2021),  four  studies  were  three-arm  parallel  RCTs  (Abrahão  2016;
Benatti 2015; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003), and one study was a three-
arm parallel quasi-RCT (Avaux 2016).

Participants

There were a total of 540 participants with SLE who commenced the
intervention, and 463 participants who completed the intervention
(86%).  There  were  77  participants  who  dropped  out  of  the
studies  (reasons  reported  in  the  Characteristics  of  included
studies table). Across included trials the mean age of participants
ranged  from  21.5  to  53  years,  and  mean  duration  of  disease
from  2.5  to  21  years.  Most  studies  diagnosed  SLE  using  the  ACR
criteria  for  SLE.  It  is  unclear  whether  included  participants  had
comorbidities  as  this  was  not  clearly  reported  in  the  included
studies. Participants were on various pharmacological treatments
including  csDMARDs  such  as  hydroxychloroquine,  prednisolone
or  glucocorticoids,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  methotrexate,
azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide; bDMARDs such as rituximab
or belimumab; and NSAIDs such as naproxen or celecoxib. See Table
1.

Interventions and comparators

Control group interventions

All 13 studies compared a type of exercise, or a combination of types
of exercise, plus usual care, to a control group that received either
one of the following.

1. Placebo plus usual carea (Lopes-Souza 2021).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

a. In this study, the exercise intervention included whole body
vibration exercise where participants were asked to stand on
a vibrating platform, and the placebo intervention also stood
on a vibration platform, except the vibration was turned off.
2. Usual  care  alonea  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;

Bostrom 2016; Hashemi 2022; Tench 2003).

3. Another  non-pharmacological  intervention  plus  usual  carea
(Abrahão  2016;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;
Keramiotou  2020;  Miossi  2012;  Tench  2003).  Other  non-
pharmacological interventions included:
a. participants  received  information  about  the  disease,  and
were  informed  that  they  would  receive  the  intervention
after  the  study  was  finished,  and  they  would  be  invited  to
participate in the intervention that proved the most effective
(Abrahão 2016);

b. participants were contacted by the research team once per
week.  They  were  also  asked  to  fill  out  questionnaires,  and
were  encouraged  to  maintain  their  current  level  of  activity
(Daltroy 1995);

c. participants  received  information  about  the  disease.  They
received clear instruction not to start any exercise for the next
16 weeks (Dos Reis-Neto 2013);

d. participants  received  information  about  the  disease.  They

were asked to maintain their usual lifestyle (Kao 2021);

e. participants  had  four  sessions  of  training  in  alternative
methods  of  performing  daily  activities,  use  of  aids,  joint
protection, and energy conservation (Keramiotou 2020);
f. participants received information about their disease. They
were advised to remain physically inactive (Miossi 2012);
g. participants  listened  to  a  relaxation  audio  tape  in  a  quiet,
warm,  and  darkened  room  for  30  minutes,  three  times  per
week.  Participants  were  seen  by  an  exercise  professional
every two weeks for a supervised relaxation session (Tench
2003).

aUsual  care  included  pharmacological  treatments:  csDMARDs
such  as  hydroxychloroquine,  prednisolone  or  glucocorticoids,
mycophenolate  mofetil,  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  and
cyclophosphamide;  bDMARDs  such  as  rituximab  or  belimumab;
and NSAIDs such as naproxen or celecoxib.

Exercise interventions

All  13  studies  included  a  structured  exercise  programme  as  part
of their intervention. The summary of interventions can be found
in Table 2, and summarised below.

1. Type of exercise: four studies included aerobic exercise (Benatti
2018;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Tench  2003),  seven
studies  included  a  combination  of  aerobic  and  resistance
exercise (Abrahão 2016; Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015; Bostrom 2016;
Hashemi  2022;  Kao  2021;  Miossi  2012),  one  study  included  a
combination of resistance exercise and stretching (Keramiotou
2020),  and  one  study  included  whole  body  vibration  exercise,
which  is  a  subgroup  of  resistance  training,  better  classified  as
muscle  activation/neuromuscular  training  complementary  to
resistance training (Lopes-Souza 2021).

2. Intensity of exercise: one study was low intensity (Lopes-Souza
2021),  seven  studies  were  moderate  intensity  (Abrahão  2016;
Avaux 2016; Daltroy 1995; Hashemi 2022; Kao 2021; Keramiotou
2020),  one  study  was  high  intensity  (Bostrom  2016),  and  four

studies did not clearly report the intensity (Benatti 2015; Benatti
2018; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Miossi 2012).

3. Frequency  of  exercise:  participants  undertook  two  exercise
sessions  per  week  in  five  studies  (Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;
Bostrom 2016; Lopes-Souza 2021; Miossi 2012), three sessions
per week in five studies (Abrahão 2016; Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-
Neto 2013; Hashemi 2022; Tench 2003), five sessions per week in
one study (Kao 2021), daily in one study (Keramiotou 2020), and
a total of three hours over the entire week, with no clarity on the
number of sessions per week in one study (Avaux 2016).

4. Duration  of 

intervention: 

the  exercise 

the  exercise
intervention had a duration of 12 weeks in 11 studies (Abrahão
2016;  Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;  Bostrom  2016;
Daltroy  1995;  Kao  2021;  Keramiotou  2020;  Lopes-Souza  2021;
Miossi  2012;  Tench  2003),  with  a  24-week  follow-up  in  three
studies  (Daltroy  1995;  Keramiotou  2020;  Lopes-Souza  2021),
and  a  24-week  plus  52-week  follow-up  in  one  study  (Bostrom
2016). The exercise intervention had a duration of 16 weeks in
one study (Dos Reis-Neto 2013), and eight weeks in one study
(Hashemi 2022).

Outcomes

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Pain

Lopes-Souza  2021  measured  pain  using  the  SF-36  Quality  of  Life
questionnaire, Pain domain, which we used in our analyses. Scores
ranged  from  0  to  100,  with  higher  scores  indicating  less  pain.
However,  for  consistency  with  other  pain  scales  (i.e.  VAS),  we
reversed the scale so that a lower score indicated less pain.

Serious adverse events

Lopes-Souza 2021 reported no SAEs.

Withdrawals due to any reason

Lopes-Souza  2021  reported  three  participant  dropouts  from  the
exercise  group  (one  participant  withdrew  before  the  six-week
analysis  due  to  low  back  pain,  and  two  withdrew  before  the
12-week  analysis  due  to  personal  reasons)  and  one  participant
withdrew from the control group before the six-week analysis due
to personal reasons.

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

See Table 3 and Table 4 for further details on the major and minor
outcomes in the included studies.

Lopes-Souza 2021 did not report composite responder rate.

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus placebo plus usual
pharmacological care

Major outcomes

One trial compared a structured exercise intervention to a placebo
control (Lopes-Souza 2021). The certainty of evidence was low for
fatigue, functional capacity, and pain, and very low for withdrawals
due  to  any  reason.  We  extracted  data  from  the  end  of  the
intervention  (i.e.  12  weeks).  The  major  outcomes  are  reported  in
summary of findings Table 1.

Fatigue

Lopes-Souza 2021 measured overall fatigue (mean or mean change)
using  the  FACIT-F,  which  we  used  in  our  analyses.  It  had  a  scale
with 13 items scored from 0 to 4. Overall scores ranged from 0 to
52, with a lower final score indicating greater fatigue. However, for
consistency with other analyses of fatigue, we reversed the scale so
that a lower score indicates less fatigue.

Functional capacity

Lopes-Souza  2021  measured  overall  functional  capacity  (mean
or  mean  change)  using  the  SF-36  Functional  Capacity/Physical
Function  domain,  which  we  used  in  our  analyses.  Scores  ranged
from  0  to  100,  with  higher  scores  indicating  better  functional
capacity.

Disease activity

Aerobic fitness

Lopes-Souza 2021 did not report aerobic fitness.

Depression

Lopes-Souza 2021 did not report depression.

Anxiety

Lopes-Souza 2021 did not report anxiety.

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus usual
pharmacological care alone

Six  trials  compared  exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care
versus usual pharmacological care alone (Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015;
Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016; Hashemi 2022; Tench 2003).

Major outcomes

Fatigue

Two trials measured and reported overall fatigue (mean or mean
change) using the Krupp FSS, with scores ranging from 1 to 7, lower
scores indicating less fatigue, which we used in our analyses (Avaux
2016; Tench 2003). Tench 2003 also measured overall fatigue using
the  Chalder  Fatigue  Scale  (CFS)  and  VAS  for  fatigue;  however  we
extracted  data  from  the  FSS  only.  Four  trials  did  not  measure  or
report (or both) fatigue (Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016;
Hashemi 2022).

Lopes-Souza 2021 did not report disease activity.

Functional capacity

Quality of life

Lopes-Souza 2021 partially reported quality of life using the SF-36
Quality of Life questionnaire; however, authors did not report the
MCS  and  PCS  scores,  and,  therefore,  this  was  not  used  in  our
analyses.

Two  trials  measured  overall  functional  capacity  (mean  or  mean
change) using the SF-36 Physical Function domain, which we used
in our analyses (Bostrom 2016; Tench 2003). Scores ranged from 0 to
100, with higher scores indicating better functional capacity. Four
trials  did not measure or report (or both) functional capacity (Avaux
2016; Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Hashemi 2022).

Disease activity

One  trial  measured  disease  activity  using  the  SLEDAI,  which  we
used  in  our  analyses  (Bostrom  2016).  Scores  ranged  from  0  to
105,  with  lower  scores  indicating  less  disease  activity.  Tench
2003 measured disease activity using the SLAM measuring system,
which  we  used  in  our  analyses.  Scores  ranged  from  0  to  83,  with
lower  scores  indicating  less  disease  activity.  Four  trials  did  not
measure or report (or both) change in disease activity before and
after  the  intervention  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;
Hashemi 2022).

Quality of life

Two trials partially reported quality of life using the SF-36 Quality
of  Life  questionnaire;  however,  authors  did  not  report  the  MCS
and PCS scores, and, therefore, could not be used in our analyses
(Bostrom 2016; Tench 2003). Four trials  did not measure or report
(or  both)  quality  of  life  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;
Hashemi 2022).

Pain

Bostrom  2016  measured  and  recorded  pain  using  the  SF-36
Quality of Life questionnaire, Pain domain, which we used in our
analyses. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating
less  pain.  For  consistency  with  other  pain  scales  (i.e.  VAS),  we
reversed the score so that a lower score indicated less pain. Tench
2003 measured pain using the SF-36 Quality of Life questionnaire;
however, authors did not report the Pain domain, and, therefore,
this  was  not  used  in  our  analyses.  Four  trials  did  not  measure
or  report  (or  both)  pain  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;
Hashemi 2022).

Withdrawals due to any reason

Avaux 2016 had three participants withdraw from the intervention;
two  due  to  personal  reasons,  and  one  due  to  a  disease  flare;
however, it is unclear which group they were part of, and they were
not included in our analyses. Benatti 2018 had eight participants
withdraw  from  the  intervention  for  the  following  reasons:  four
participants withdrew from the control group (one was pregnant,
three for personal reasons) and four participants withdrew from the
exercise group (one fractured a limb outside of training sessions,
three for person reasons). Another two participants withdrew due
to a disease flare (one from each group). Bostrom 2016 had three
participants withdraw from the control group (one had depression/
cognitive  impairment,  one  had  untreated  dementia,  one  had
suspected relapse of breast cancer). Tench 2003 had 14 participants
withdraw due to any reason: four participants withdrew from the
exercise group, five participants withdrew from the active control
group  (relaxation)  and  five  participants  withdrew  from  the  usual
care  control  group.  Note  that  six  participants  dropped  out  of
treatment and eight participants completed the study but did not
wish  to  repeat  the  walking  test  to  exhaustion  at  the  end  of  the
intervention. Two trials had no withdrawals from the intervention
due to any reason that were reported (Benatti 2015; Hashemi 2022).

Serious adverse events

None of the six trials reported any SAEs (Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015;
Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016; Hashemi 2022; Tench 2003).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

None of the six studies reported composite responder rate (Avaux
2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;  Bostrom  2016;  Hashemi  2022;
Tench 2003).

Aerobic fitness

Bostrom  2016  recorded  aerobic  capacity  using  the  maximum
oxygen consumption (VO2max in litres/minute), with higher scores
indicating  better  aerobic  capacity.  Tench  2003  recorded  aerobic
capacity  using  peak  oxygen  consumption  (VO2peak  in  millilitres/
kilogram/minute),  with  higher  scores  indicating  better  aerobic
capacity.  Four  trials  did  not  measure  or  report  (or  both)  aerobic
capacity (Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Hashemi 2022).

Depression

Tench  2003  recorded  depression  using  the  HADS  –  Depression
subscale. Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating
a  better  outcome.  Five  trials  did  not  measure  or  report  (or  both)
depression (Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016;
Hashemi 2022).

Anxiety

Tench  2003  recorded  anxiety  using  the  HADS  –  Anxiety  subscale.
Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating a better
outcome.  Five  trials  did  not  measure  or  report  (or  both)  anxiety
(Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;  Bostrom  2016;  Hashemi
2022).

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus another non-
pharmacological intervention plus usual pharmacological care

Seven  studies  compared  exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological
care versus another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual
pharmacological care (Abrahão 2016; Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-Neto
2013; Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003).

Major outcomes

Fatigue

Daltroy  1995  measured  fatigue  using  the  MAC  questionnaire  and
POMS  Fatigue  questionnaires;  however,  these  were  not  included
in  our  analyses  because  the  results  for  the  participants  with  SLE
were not available separately from those of the participants with
rheumatoid  arthritis.  Keramiotou  2020  measured  overall  fatigue
using the LupusQOL – Fatigue questionnaire, which we used in our
analyses. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating
less fatigue. For consistency with other fatigue scales (i.e. FSS), we
reversed the scale so that a lower score indicated less fatigue. Tench
2003 measured fatigue using the Krupp FSS, which we used in our
analyses. Scores ranged from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating
less fatigue. Tench 2003 used the CFS, VAS Fatigue, and the SF-36
Quality of Life questionnaire, Vitality domain; however, these were
not used in our analyses. Four trials did not measure or report (or
both) overall fatigue (Abrahão 2016; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021;
Miossi 2012).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Two  trials  measured  functional  capacity  using  the  SF-36  Quality
of  Life  questionnaire,  Physical  Function  domain,  which  we  used
in  our  analyses  (Abrahão  2016;  Tench  2003).  Scores  ranged
from  0  to  100,  with  higher  scores  indicating  better  functional
capacity.  Keramiotou  2020  measured  functional  capacity  using
the  LupusQOL  questionnaire  Physical  Health  domain,  which  we
used  in  our  analyses.  Scores  ranged  from  0  to  100,  with  higher
scores indicating better functional capacity. Keramiotou 2020 also
assessed 
functional  capacity  using  the  Health  Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ); however, this was not used in our analyses.
Four trials did not measure or report (or both) functional capacity
(Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021; Miossi 2012).

care  control  group.  Note  that  six  participants  dropped  out  of
treatment and eight participants completed the study but did not
wish  to  repeat  the  walking  test  to  exhaustion  at  the  end  of  the
intervention. Four trials did not clearly report withdrawals due to
any  reason  (Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;  Miossi
2012).

Serious adverse events

Seven  trials  reported  no  SAEs  (Abrahão  2016;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos
Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;  Keramiotou  2020;  Miossi  2012;  Tench
2003).

Disease activity

Three trials measured disease activity using the SLEDAI, which we
used  in  our  analyses  (Abrahão  2016;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Miossi
2012).  Scores  ranged  from  0  to  105,  with  lower  scores  indicating
less  disease  activity.  Tench  2003  measured  disease  activity  using
the SLAM measuring system, which we used in our analyses. Scores
ranged  from  0  to  83,  with  lower  scores  indicating  less  disease
activity.  Two  trials  measured  fatigue  using  the  SLEDAI;  however,
authors do not report the mean and SD, and, therefore, we were
unable to use these in our analyses (Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020).
Two  trials  did  not  measure  or  report  (or  both)  change  in  disease
activity  before  and  after  the  intervention  (Daltroy  1995;  Miossi
2012).

Quality of life

Two trials partially reported quality of life using the SF-36 Quality
of Life questionnaire; however, authors did not report the MCS and
PCS  scores,  and,  therefore,  these  were  not  used  in  our  analyses
(Abrahão  2016;  Tench  2003).  Keramiotou  2020  partially  reported
quality  of  life  using  the  LupusQOL  questionnaire;  however,  they
reported only Physical Health and Fatigue domains, and, therefore,
were not used in our analyses. Four trials did not measure or report
(or both) quality of life (Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021;
Miossi 2012).

Pain

Abrahão 2016 measured pain using the SF-36 Quality of Life Pain
questionnaire, which we used in our analyses. Scores ranged from
0  to  100,  with  higher  scores  indicating  less  pain.  For  consistency
with  other  scales  (i.e.  VAS),  we  reversed  the  scale  so  that  lower
scores indicated less pain. Tench 2003 also used the SF-36 Quality
of Life questionnaire to measure quality of life; however, authors
did not report the Pain domain, and, therefore, this was not used in
our analyses. Keramiotou 2020 measured pain using the VAS Pain,
which  we  used  in  our  analyses.  Scores  ranged  from  0  to  10,  with
lower scores indicating less pain. Four trials did not report quality
of life (Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021; Miossi 2012).

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

None of the seven trials measured or reported (or both) composite
responder  rate  (Abrahão  2016;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;
Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003).

Aerobic fitness

Daltroy 1995 measured aerobic capacity using a 12-minute walking
test;  however,  this  was  not  used  in  our  analyses.  Two  trials
measured aerobic capacity using VO2peak (in millilitres/kilogram/
minute), which we used in our analyses (Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Tench
2003). Higher scores indicated better aerobic capacity. Four trials
did not measure or report (or both) aerobic capacity (Abrahão 2016;
Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020; Miossi 2012).

Depression

Abrahão 2016 measured depression using the BDI, which we used
in  our  analyses.  Scores  ranged  from  0  to  63,  with  lower  scores
indicating  a  better  outcome.  Daltroy  1995  measured  depression
using  the  Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale
(CES-D)  and  was  not  used  in  our  analyses  because  we  were
unable to differentiate the participants with SLEW from those with
rheumatoid arthritis. Scores ranged from 0 to 60, with lower scores
indicating  a  better  outcome.  Tench  2003  measured  depression
using  the  HADS  –  Depression  subscale  and  was  not  used  in  our
analyses. Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating
a better outcome. Four trials did not measure or report (or both)
depression (Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020; Miossi
2012).

Anxiety

Tench 2003 measured anxiety using the HADS – Anxiety subscale.
Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with lower scores indicating a better
outcome. Six trials did not measure anxiety (Abrahão 2016; Daltroy
1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;  Keramiotou  2020;  Miossi
2012).

Withdrawals due to any reason

Excluded studies

Abrahão  2016  had  two  participants  withdraw  from  the  control
group  for  an  unknown  reason.  Keramiotou  2020  had  two
participants  from  the  exercise  group  withdraw;  however,  the
reasons  were  not  reported.  Tench  2003  had  14  participants
withdraw  from  the  study:  four  participants  withdrew  from  the
exercise group, five participants withdrew from the active control
group (relaxation), and five participants withdrew from the usual

We excluded 27 studies for the following reasons.

1. Ineligible  intervention:  exercise  was  either  acute  (one  single
bout  of  exercise)  or  did  not  meet  our  inclusion  criteria  of  an
exercise intervention being structured, recurring, and including
specific  dosage  information  (i.e.  frequency,  intensity,  timing,
type).

2. Ineligible participant population: intervention group included
participants with SLE, however, control group participants were

Allocation

Random sequence

We judged five studies at low risk of bias because they used and
reported an appropriate method of randomisation (Abrahão 2016;
Benatti 2015; Bostrom 2016; Keramiotou 2020; Tench 2003).

We assessed five studies at unclear risk of bias because the methods
used to generate allocation sequence were not described, or were
unclear  (Benatti  2018;  Daltroy  1995;  Hashemi  2022;  Lopes-Souza
2021; Miossi 2012).

We judged three studies at high risk of bias because their methods
of  randomisation  were  not  truly  random  (i.e.  quasi-randomised),
despite authors reporting the study to be randomised (Avaux 2016;
Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021).

Allocation concealment

We  judged  two  studies  at  low  risk  of  bias,  since  they  provided
adequate  information  on  the  method  of  allocation  concealment
(Abrahão 2016; Keramiotou 2020).

For  10  studies,  the  method  used  to  conceal  allocation  sequence
was unclear, or not described (Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Bostrom
2016; Daltroy 1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Hashemi 2022; Kao 2021;
Lopes-Souza 2021; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003).

We judged one study at high risk of bias because the selection of
participants based on their geographical location was deemed as
selection bias (Avaux 2016).

Blinding

Participant blinding

We judged all studies at high risk of bias. Blinding participants and
care providers is difficult because of the nature of the intervention.
Most of the included studies did not report information on blinding,
or  a  masking  procedure  for  treatment  allocation  or  delivery.  No
studies reported using a blinding procedure (sham or attentional
comparator, or blinding of study hypothesis).

Outcome assessor 

We  judged  all  studies  at  high  (Avaux  2016;  Bostrom  2016;  Dos
Reis-Neto  2013)  or  unclear  risk  of  bias  (Abrahão  2016;  Benatti
2015;  Benatti  2018;  Daltroy  1995;  Hashemi  2022;  Kao  2021;
Keramiotou  2020;  Lopes-Souza  2021;  Miossi  2012;  Tench  2003).
Most  included  studies  used  subjective  outcomes  (self-reporting).
Because  participants  were  not  blind  to  the  treatment  allocation
(i.e. inability to bind an exercise trial), we considered the outcomes
assessors to be unblinded.

Incomplete outcome data

We judged seven studies at low risk of attrition bias (Abrahão 2016;
Daltroy 1995; Hashemi 2022; Kao 2021; Lopes-Souza 2021; Miossi
2012; Tench 2003).

We  judged  six  studies  at  high  risk  of  attrition  bias  because  of
withdrawals throughout the intervention with no clear reporting of
ITT analyses (Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015; Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016;
Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Keramiotou 2020).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Selective reporting

We  judged  five  studies  at  low  risk  of  reporting  bias,  because  all
outcomes  reported  were  prespecified  in  their  methods  (Daltroy
1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Hashemi 2022; Kao 2021; Miossi 2012).

We judged seven studies at a high risk of bias because we found
outcomes  listed  in  their  methods  and  not  reported  in  the  results
(e.g. the MCS of the SF-36) (Abrahão 2016; Avaux 2016; Benatti 2015;
Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016; Keramiotou 2020; Lopes-Souza 2021;
Tench 2003).

Other potential sources of bias

We judged all studies at low risk of other bias because we identified
no other potential sources of bias.

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus placebo plus
usual pharmacological care

One study compared exercise plus usual care versus placebo plus
usual care (Lopes-Souza 2021).

Major outcomes

See: Summary of findings 1.

Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue, 0 to 52 scale, lower score indicates less fatigue
severity, MCID 5.9 points)

One study (17 participants) found that exercise may result in little
to no effect on fatigue. The mean fatigue score for the placebo plus
usual  care  group  was  38  points,  and  the  mean  fatigue  score  for
the exercise plus usual care group was 33 points (MD −5.00 points,
95% CI −3.29 lower to 13.29; Analysis 1.1). There was no clinically
meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations, we downgraded
the  evidence  two  levels  for  high  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision;  we
rated the certainty of evidence as low.

Functional capacity (SF-36 Physical Function, 0 to 100 scale, higher
scores indicate better function, MCID 10 points)

One study (17 participants) found that exercise may have little to no
effect on functional capacity. The mean functional capacity score
for the placebo plus usual care group was 70 points, and the mean
functional capacity score for the exercise plus usual care group 67.5
points (MD −2.50 points, 95% CI −23.78 to 18.78; Analysis 1.2). There
was no important clinically meaningful benefit. Because of study
limitations, we downgraded the evidence two levels for high risk of
bias and imprecision; we rated the certainty of evidence as low.

Disease activity

The study did not report disease activity.

Pain (SF-36 Pain, 0 to 100 scale, lower scores indicate less pain, MCID
10 points)

One  study  (17  participants)  found  that  exercise  may  have  little
to  no  effect  on  pain.  The  mean  pain  score  was  43  points  for  the
placebo  plus  usual  care  group,  and  the  mean  pain  score  was  34
points for the exercise plus usual care group (MD −9.00 points, 95%
CI −28.88 to 10.88; Analysis 2.4). There was no important clinically
meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations, we downgraded
the  evidence  two  levels  for  high  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision;  we
rated the certainty of evidence as low.

Serious adverse events

No SAEs reported.

Withdrawals due to any reason

We  are  uncertain  whether  exercise  results  in  fewer  or  more
withdrawals  (RR  2.73,  95%  CI  0.34  to  22.16;  1  study;  Analysis
1.4).  The  study  reported  three  dropouts  from  the  exercise  group;
one participant withdrew before the six-week analysis due to low
back  pain  ("not  related  directly  with  the  intervention"),  and  two
withdrew  before  the  12-week  analysis  for  personal  reasons,  and
one  participant  withdrew  from  the  control  group  before  the  six-
week analysis for personal reasons.

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

The study did not measure or report composite responder rate.

Aerobic fitness

The study did not measure or report aerobic fitness.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

we downgraded the evidence two levels for high risk of bias and
imprecision; we rated the certainty of evidence as low.

Functional capacity (SF-36 Physical Function, scale 0 to 100, higher
score indicates better function, MCID 10 points)

Two  studies  (96  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual  care
may  have  little  to  no  effect  on  functional  capacity.  The  mean
physical  function  score  in  the  usual  care  alone  group  was  60
points,  and  the  mean  physical  function  score  for  the  exercise
plus  usual  care  group  was  65.4  points  (MD  5.39  points,  95%  CI
−5.97 to 16.75; Analysis 2.2; Bostrom 2016; Tench 2003). Statistical
heterogeneity was not important (I2 = 0%). There was no clinically
meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations, we downgraded
the  evidence  two  levels  for  high  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision;  we
rated the certainty of evidence as low.

Disease activity (SLEDAI, scale 0 to 105, lower score indicates less
disease activity, MCID 4 points)

Two studies (100 participants) found that exercise plus usual care
may have little to no effect on disease activity. The mean disease
activity score in the usual care alone group was 0.5 points, and the
mean disease activity score for the exercise plus usual care group
was  0.43  points  (MD  −0.07  points,  95%  CI  −2.8  to  2.66;  Analysis
2.3;  Bostrom  2016;  Tench  2003).  Statistical  heterogeneity  was
significant (I2 = 88%). There was no clinically meaningful benefit.
Because  of  study  limitations,  we  downgraded  the  evidence  two
levels for high risk of bias and imprecision. We rated the certainty
of evidence as low.

We back-translated the SMD by multiplying the SMD by the SD of the
control group at baseline from the most representative trial (Tench
2003).

Note one of the two studies used SLAM to measure disease activity
(Tench 2003).

Depression

Quality of life

The study did not measure or report depression.

No studies reported quality of life.

Anxiety

The study did not measure or report anxiety.

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus usual
pharmacological care alone

Six  studies  compared  exercise  plus  usual  care  versus  usual  care
alone  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;  Bostrom  2016;
Hashemi 2022; Tench 2003).

Major outcomes

See: Summary of findings 2.

Fatigue (FSS, scale 1 to 7, lower score indicates less fatigue, MCID 1
point)

Two studies (104 participants) found that exercise plus usual care
may have little to no effect on mean fatigue. The mean fatigue score
in the usual care alone group was 5.4 points, and the mean fatigue
score  for  the  exercise  plus  usual  care  group  was  4.8  points  (MD
−0.59 points, 95% CI −1.40 to 0.22; Analysis 2.1; Avaux 2016; Tench
2003). Statistical heterogeneity was not important (I2 = 0%). There
was no clinically meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations,

Pain (SF-36 Bodily Pain, scale 0 to 100, lower scores indicate less pain,
MCID 10 points)

One  study  (31  participants)  reported  pain.  We  are  uncertain
whether  exercise  improves  pain.  The  mean  pain  score  in  the
usual  care  alone  group  was  38  points,  and  the  mean  pain  score
for  the  exercise  plus  usual  care  group  was  52  points  (MD  16.00
points,  95%  −CI  0.18  to  32.18; Analysis  2.4;  Bostrom  2016).  There
was no important clinically meaningful benefit. Because of study
limitations,  we  downgraded  the  evidence  three  levels  for  high
risk of bias and imprecision (low participant numbers and the CIs
included  a  large  effect  and  no  effect).  We  rated  the  certainty  of
evidence as very low.

Serious adverse events

No SAEs were reported.

Withdrawals due to any reason

We  are  uncertain  whether  exercise  results  in  fewer  or  more
withdrawals  (RR  0.92,  95%  CI  0.53  to  1.60;  Analysis  2.5).  Avaux
2016 reported three withdrawals from the study; two for personal
reasons, and one due to a disease flare; however, it is unclear which
group  they  were  part  of,  and,  therefore,  they  were  not  included

in  our  analyses.  Benatti  2018  had  eight  participants  withdraw
from the intervention; four participants withdrew from the control
group  (one  was  pregnant,  three  for  personal  reasons)  and  four
participants withdrew from the exercise group (one fractured limb
outside  of  training  sessions,  three  for  person  reasons).  Another
two  participants  withdrew  due  to  a  disease  flare  (one  from  each
group).  Bostrom  2016  had  three  participants  withdraw  from  the
control  group  (one  had  depression/cognitive  impairment,  one
had  untreated  dementia,  one  had  suspected  relapse  of  breast
cancer).  Tench  2003  had  14    participants  withdraw  due  to  any
reason.  Four  participants  withdrew  from  the  exercise  group,  five
participants  withdrew  from  the  active  control  group  (relaxation),
and five participants withdrew from the usual care control group.
Note  that  six  participants  dropped  out  of  treatment  and  eight
participants  completed  the  study  but  did  not  wish  to  repeat  the
walking test to exhaustion at the end of the intervention. Two trials
had no withdrawals from the intervention due to any reason that
were reported (Benatti 2015; Hashemi 2022).

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

No  studies  measured  or  reported  (or  both)  composite  responder
rate.

Aerobic capacity (peak VO2, higher scores indicate better aerobic
capacity)

Three  studies  (109  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological  care  may  improve  aerobic  capacity  score  when
compared  to  usual  pharmacological  care  alone;  however,  the
improvement was not clinically important (MD 1.27 points, 95% CI
−0.59 to 3.12; Analysis 2.6; Benatti 2018; Bostrom 2016; Tench 2003).

Depression (BDI, scale 0 to 63, lower scores indicate less depression)

One  study  (65  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological  care  may 
improve  depression  score  when
compared  to  usual  pharmacological  care  alone;  however,  the
improvement was not clinically important (MD −0.29 points, 95% CI
−0.78 to 0.20; Analysis 2.7; Tench 2003).

Anxiety (HADS, scale 0 to 21, lower scores indicate less anxiety)

One  study  (65  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological care may improve anxiety score when compared
to  usual  pharmacological  care  alone;  however,  the  improvement
was  not  clinically  important  (MD  −0.80  points,  95%  CI  −3.02  to
1.42; Analysis 2.8; Tench 2003).

Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus another non-
pharmacological intervention plus usual pharmacological care

Seven  studies  compared  exercise  plus  usual  care  versus  another
non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care (Abrahão 2016;
Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;  Keramiotou  2020;
Miossi 2012; Tench 2003).

Major outcomes

See: Summary of findings 3.

Fatigue (FSS, scale 1 to 7, lower scores indicate less fatigue severity,
MCID 1 point)

Two  studies  (119  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
care  may  reduce  fatigue.  The  mean  fatigue  score  in  the  non-

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

pharmacological  interventions  (joint  aids  and  information  about
their  disease,  education,  and  relaxation  therapy)  plus  usual  care
was  5.3  points,  and  the  mean  fatigue  score  for  the  exercise  plus
usual  care  group  was  4.79  points  (MD  −0.51  points,  95%  CI  −0.88
to  −0.14;  Analysis  3.1;  Keramiotou  2020;  Tench  2003).  Statistical
heterogeneity was not important (I2 = 0%). There was no clinically
meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations, we downgraded
the  evidence  two  levels  for  high  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision;  we
rated the certainty of evidence as low.

We back-translated the SMD by multiplying the SMD by the SD of the
control group at baseline from the most representative trial (Tench
2003).

Note  one  of  the  two  studies  used  LupusQOL  Fatigue  to  measure
fatigue (Tench 2003).

Functional capacity (SF-36 Physical Function, scale 0 to 100, higher
scores indicate better functional capacity, MCID 10 points)

Three studies (182 participants) found that exercise plus usual care
may  increase  functional  capacity.  The  mean  functional  capacity
score  in  the  other  non-pharmacological  interventions  (joint  aids
and  information  about  their  disease,  education,  and  relaxation
therapy) plus usual care was 41.4 points, and the mean functional
capacity score for the exercise plus usual care group was 54.6 points
(MD 13.20 points, 95% CI 6.17 to 20.22; Analysis 3.2; Abrahão 2016;
Keramiotou 2020; Tench 2003). There was a clinically meaningful
benefit. Because of study limitations, we downgraded the evidence
two  levels  for  high  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision.  We  rated  the
certainty of evidence as low.

Note  that  one  of  the  three  studies  used  LupusQOL  to  assess
functional  capacity  (scale  0  to  100,  higher  scores  indicate  better
functional capacity) (Keramiotou 2020).

We back-translated the SMD by multiplying the SMD by the SD of
the  control  group  at  baseline  from  the  most  representative  trial
(Abrahão 2016).

Disease activity (SLEDAI, scale 0 to 52, lower scores indicate lower
disease activity, MCID 4 points)

Four  studies  (184  participants)  founds  that  exercise  plus  usual
care  probably  results  in  little  to  no  difference  in  disease  activity.
The mean disease activity score in the other non-pharmacological
interventions  (joint  aids  and  information  about  their  disease,
education, and relaxation therapy) plus usual care was 1.2 points,
and the mean disease activity score for the exercise plus usual care
group was 1.22 points (SMD 0.02 points, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.32; MD
0.034 points, 95% CI −0.476 to 0.544; Analysis 3.3; Abrahão 2016; Dos
Reis-Neto 2013; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003). Baseline control group
SD for converting SMD to MD was 1.7 and taken from Abrahão 2016.
Statistical  heterogeneity  was  not  significant  (I2  =  1%).  There  was
no clinically meaningful benefit. Because of study limitations, we
downgraded the evidence one level for high risk of bias We rated
the certainty of evidence as moderate.

Note  that  one  of  the  four  studies  used  SLAM  to  measure  disease
activity  (scale  0  to  83,  lower  scores  indicate  less  disease  activity)
(Tench 2003).

We back-translated the SMD by multiplying the SMD by the SD of
the  control  group  at  baseline  from  the  most  representative  trial
(Abrahão 2016).

Depression (BDI, scale 0 to 63, lower scores indicate less depression)

This outcome was measured; however, the MCS score of the SF-36
Quality of Life questionnaire was not reported and, therefore was
unable to be included in the analysis.

Pain (VAS, scale 0 to 10, lower scores indicate less pain, MCID 1.5
points)

Two studies (121 participants) found that exercise plus usual care
may  result  in  little  to  no  difference  in  pain.  The  mean  pain  score
in  the  other  non-pharmacological  interventions  (joint  aids  and
information about their disease, education, and relaxation therapy)
plus usual care was 4.97 points, and the mean pain score for the
exercise plus usual care group was −0.29 points (MD −1.59 points,
95%  CI  −2.46  to  −0.71;  Analysis  3.4;  Abrahão  2016;  Keramiotou
2020). Statistical heterogeneity was significant (I2 = 74%). Because
of  study  limitations,  we  downgraded  the  evidence  two  levels  for
high risk of bias and imprecision. We rated the certainty of evidence
as low.

Note that one of the two studies used the SF-36 Bodily Pain domain
to  measure  pain  (scale  0  to  100,  lower  score  indicates  less  pain)
(Abrahão 2016).

We back-translated the SMD by multiplying the SMD by the SD of
the  control  group  at  baseline  from  the  most  representative  trial
(Abrahão 2016).

Serious adverse events

No SAEs were reported.

Withdrawals due to any reason

We  are  uncertain  whether  exercise  results  in  fewer  or  more
withdrawals  (RR  0.89,  95%  CI  0.13  to  5.94;  Analysis  2.5).  Abrahão
2016 reported two participant withdrawals from the control group
for an unknown reason. Keramiotou 2020 reported two participant
withdrawals  from  the  exercise  group;  however,  the  reasons  were
not reported. Tench 2003 reported 14 participant withdrawals from
the  intervention;  four  participants  withdrew  from  the  exercise
group,  five  participants  withdrew  from  the  active  control  group
(relaxation),  and  five  participants  withdrew  from  the  usual  care
group.  Note  that  six  participants  dropped  out  of  treatment  and
eight participants completed the study but did not wish to repeat
the walking test to exhaustion at the end of the intervention. Four
trials did not clearly report withdrawals due to any reason (Daltroy
1995; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Kao 2021; Miossi 2012).

Minor outcomes

Composite responder rate

No  studies  measured  or  reported  (or  both)  composite  responder
rate.

Aerobic fitness (peak VO2, higher scores indicate better aerobic
capacity)

Two  studies  (99  participants)  found  an  improvement  in  aerobic
capacity score with exercise plus usual care compared to another
non-pharmacological  intervention  (joint  aids  and  information
about  their  disease,  education,  and  relaxation  therapy)  (MD  1.19
points, 95% CI −1.64 to 4.02; Analysis 3.6; Dos Reis-Neto 2013; Tench
2003). There was no clinically meaningful benefit.

One  study  (61  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological  care  may 
improve  depression  score  when
compared to another non-pharmacological intervention (joint aids
and  information  about  their  disease,  education,  or  relaxation
therapy); however, the improvement was not clinically important
(MD −1.40 points, 95% CI −4.61 to 1.81; Analysis 3.7; Abrahão 2016).

Anxiety (HADS, scale 0 to 21, lower scores indicate less anxiety)

One  study  (61  participants)  found  that  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological care may improve anxiety score when compared
to  another  non-pharmacological  intervention  (joint  aids  and
information about their disease, education, or relaxation therapy);
however, the improvement was not clinically important (MD −1.10
points, 95% CI −3.61 to 1.41; Analysis 3.8; Tench 2003).

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Given the small number of studies, we did not conduct subgroup
analysis to explore the possible effect of type of exercise (resistance
versus cardiorespiratory) on estimated effect size. Neither did we
conduct  a  sensitivity  analysis,  because  we  judged  all  studies  at
unclear or high risk of bias for most items.

Assessment of publication bias

We  had  planned  to  assess  publication  bias  by  visual  inspection
of  funnel  plots,  but  we  did  not  generate  funnel  plots  because  of
the limited number of studies (fewer than 10), and the risk of an
underpowered test. We were unable to determine the existence of
publication bias.

Summary of main results

The main purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness
of  structured  exercise  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  to  usual
pharmacological  care  for  people  with  SLE.  Overall,  13  RCTs  (540
participants)  met  the  inclusion  criteria.  The  structured  exercise
programmes  amongst  the  13  included  studies  varied;  see  Table
2, therefore the results of this review are not specific to one type
or dosage of exercise. All studies compared a type of exercise, or
a  combination  of  types  of  exercise,  plus  usual  pharmacological
care,  to  a  control  group  that  received  one  of  the  following;
placebo plus usual pharmacological care (Lopes-Souza 2021); usual
pharmacological  care  alone  (Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti
2018;  Bostrom  2016;  Hashemi  2022;  Tench  2003);  or  another
non-pharmacological  intervention  (education  about  the  disease/
exercise, relaxation therapy, etc.) plus usual pharmacological care
(Abrahão  2016;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos  Reis-Neto  2013;  Kao  2021;
Keramiotou 2020; Miossi 2012; Tench 2003).

capacity,  and  disease  activity,  measured  after  the  completion  of
the intervention. And we are uncertain whether exercise improves
pain  (very  low-certainty  evidence)  or  results  in  fewer  or  more
withdrawals (very low-certainty evidence).

We  found  low-  to  moderate-certainty  evidence  that  structured
exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  compared  to  another
non-pharmacological intervention (relaxation, education, support
aids)  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  may  reduce  fatigue
(low-certainty  evidence),  may  improve  functional  capacity  (low-
certainty  evidence),  probably  results  in  little  to  no  difference  in
disease  activity  (moderate-certainty  evidence),  and  may  result  in
little  to  no  difference  in  pain  (low-certainty  evidence),  measured
after the completion of the intervention. We are uncertain whether
exercise  results  in  fewer  or  more  withdrawals  (very  low-certainty
evidence).

We have no clear evidence that structured exercise can induce more
adverse events. No studies clearly reported an adverse event as an
outcome, or elaborated further on the reasons for a withdrawal and
whether this led to further complications, hospitalisation, or death.
We were unable to draw any conclusions.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

The evidence provided by this review is limited to the 13 included
RCTs  that  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological  care  versus  a  control  group  (placebo  plus  usual
pharmacological care, usual pharmacological care alone, another
non-pharmacological  intervention  plus  usual  pharmacological
care). One RCT that is potentially eligible for this review is awaiting
classification because their results have not yet been reported in
full (Boedecker 2020).

All  studies  compared  exercise 
in  addition  to  their  usual
pharmacological care to no additional exercise; however, there was
heterogeneity between exercise interventions with no dose control
between  the  studies.  The  included  studies  investigated  several
different types and combinations of exercise components. Aerobic
exercise,  in  particular  walking,  was  the  most  frequent  exercise
type.  However,  the  components  were  incompletely  described  in
most  trials.  For  example,  the  material  used,  who  provided  the
intervention,  how  it  was  supervised,  and  where  the  exercise  was
delivered  were  often  missing.  The  exercise  dosage,  and  level
of  supervision,  could  not  be  explored  with  indirect  statistical
techniques, such as meta-regression. Thus, we did not investigate
heterogeneity  by  the  type  of  exercise,  or  supervision  because
we  were  unable  to  isolate  these  components  from  the  included
studies.

Twelve  studies  assessed  outcome  measures  at  the  end  of  the
intervention  only  (i.e.  12  weeks),  which  may  not  have  accounted
for  the  long-term  effect  of  exercise,  and  its  feasibility  (Abrahão
2016;  Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Benatti  2018;  Daltroy  1995;  Dos
Reis-Neto 2013; Hashemi 2022; Kao 2021; Keramiotou 2020; Lopes-
Souza  2021;  Miossi  2012;  Tench  2003).  Importantly,  because  SLE
may progress or vary over time, it is necessary to assess outcome
measurements  at  more  time  points,  and  over  a  longer  period  of
time (greater than 12 months) to verify the relationship between
treatment effect and outcomes (i.e. fatigue).

Most  exercise  programmes  were  delivered  in  conjunction  with
drug therapy (standard NSAIDs, DMARDs, or biological agents). The

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

benefits of exercise interventions, depending on the type of drug
therapy received, could not be determined. Therefore, we do not
know  if  some  drugs  in  addition  to  exercise  have  better  or  worse
outcomes for people with SLE. Also, no study specifically evaluated
the efficacy of exercise with biological medication versus standard
NSAID or DMARD therapy.

An important consideration is that most participants in the studies
had minimal disease activity (SLEDAI score less than 4) at baseline,
and,  therefore,  the  overall  results  could  not  be  applicable  to
all  people  with  SLE.  Also,  considering  that  people  with  SLE  can
experience varying symptoms and degree of symptoms over time,
the change in outcomes from baseline to the end of intervention
need to be read with caution (i.e. the change in outcome reporting
might  be  more  a  reflection  of  how  they  were  feeling  on  that  day
of  testing,  rather  than  a  change  in  feelings  before  and  after  the
intervention).

Other outcomes needed to understand more about the risk/benefit
ratio  of  exercise,  which  have  been  included  in  this  review,  is
participant-reported fatigue, quality of life, pain, depression, and
anxiety.  Importantly,  these  outcomes  should  be  evaluated  using
standardised outcome tools that are validated in SLE (e.g. FACIT)
(Lai 2011), as well as dynamic muscle strength and aerobic fitness,
which could be observed to link the relationship between disease-
related  outcomes  and  exercise.  With  respect  to  the  instruments
used  to  measure  health-related  quality  of  life,  the  SF-36  was  the
most  frequently  used  tool  in  the  included  studies.  Although  the
use of the SF-36 allows for comparison of quality of life in various
diseases, it lacks characteristic details that are specific in SLE, such
as  body  image  and  intimate  relationships  (McElhone  2010).  SLE-
specific instruments, such as the 34-item LupusQOL developed by
McElhone  and  colleagues  in  2007  (McElhone  2007)  and  the  40-
item SLEQOL developed by Leong and colleagues in 2005 (Leong
 2005), might be able to offer enhanced responsiveness to changes
in health-related quality of life than the SF-36. Future studies may
want to use these instruments either alone or in combination with
a generic measure to ensure that both disease-specific and wider
aspects of quality of life are assessed.

Inherent  with  exercise  trials,  it  is  difficult  to  blind  participants
to  the  intervention.  Therefore,  bias  introduced  by  a  placebo
effect can potentially overestimate the efficacy of an intervention,
particularly  in  the  evaluation  of  subjective  outcomes.  As  such,
future trial designs could instead be double blinded and compare
different modes (aerobic, resistance, range of motion), intensities
(low,  moderate,  and  high  according  to  RPE  or  percentage  of
maximum heart rate), time of exercise (i.e. 10-minute or 60-minutes
bouts), or a combination of these to increase our understanding of
exercise guidelines in SLE. In addition, to minimise detection bias,
consistent blinding of outcomes assessors is recommended, since
participants cannot be blinded to the intervention.

There  was  heterogeneity  between  outcome  measures  amongst
studies and outcomes that were included in dose-matched studies.
There  was  also  methodological  limitations,  risk  of  bias,  and
an  overall  limited  number  of  participants  in  the  studies.  The
evidence  derived  from  the  included  studies  does  not  allow
strong conclusions to be drawn about which specific components
of  exercise  are  best  in  terms  of  dose  of  exercise,  and  level
of  supervision.  There  needs  to  be  1.  more  studies  completed
assessing  the  effects  of  exercise  in  people  with  varying  levels  of
disease activity; 2. more participants in the trials; 3. homogeneous

outcomes  that  are  more  sensitive  to  change  in  SLE  (i.e.  FACIT-
Fatigue,  LupusQOL,  SLEDAI,  etc.);  4.  trials  that  compare  various
doses of exercise (i.e. aerobic versus resistance training on fatigue,
disease activity etc.); and 5. longitudinal study designs that focus on
change in disease-related outcomes as well as exercise adherence,
physical activity levels, and sustainability of outcomes over a longer
period of time.

Quality of the evidence

We had concerns about the risk of bias for all studies included: eight
(62%) studies had either high or unclear allocation concealment;
all  failed  to  blind  participants  or  outcome  assessors;  six  (46%)
had incomplete outcome data; and seven (54%) had a high risk of
selective  reporting.  Given  the  number  of  studies  included  in  the
review,  we  cannot  rule  out  the  existence  of  a  small-study  effect,
explaining the magnitude of the positive results we found.

We  considered  statistically  significant  group  differences  between
exercise  plus  usual  pharmacological  care  versus  a  control  group
(placebo plus usual pharmacological care, usual pharmacological
care  alone,  or  another  non-pharmacological  intervention  such
as  relaxation  therapy,  support  aids,  or  education  about  the
disease  plus  usual  pharmacological  care).  For  each  comparison,
the number of studies (fewer than 10), and small samples (many
studies were small, with fewer than 100 participants) might have
contributed  to  a  low-power  analysis.  Low  power  is  associated
with bias (Button 2013). Most studies we included were at high or
unclear risk of bias, which suggests that the estimated effects might
be  overestimated,  and  reduces  the  likelihood  that  they  reflect  a
true  effect.  We  cannot  provide  conclusions  with  a  high  level  of
confidence.  The  magnitude  of  the  estimated  effects  may  change
with larger studies.

We  only  presented  the  findings  of  trials  that  reported  the  major
outcomes of interest in Summary of findings 1; Summary of findings
2;  Summary  of  findings  3;  and  used  the  GRADE  approach  to
assess  the  certainty  of  the  evidence  examined  for  each  outcome
(Schünemann  2020a).  Most  of  the  evidence  was  downgraded  to
low  or  very  low  certainty,  based  on  two  factors:  risk  of  bias  and
imprecision with small trials and large CIs.

Potential biases in the review process

We  made  all  attempts  to  reduce  the  bias  involved  in  the  review
process  by  including  the  best  available  evidence.  All  studies
included  were  RCTs  or  quasi-RCTs.  However,  by  restricting  the
inclusion criteria to RCTs only, we may have limited the number of
included trials and potentially missed useful additional evidence.
We conducted an extensive search of the literature in all relevant
databases  and  identified  all  relevant  trials  meeting  the  reviews'
eligibility criteria. None of the review authors have been involved in
the conduct of the included trials. A minimum of two review authors
independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed the risk
of  bias,  and  graded  the  certainty  of  evidence  in  all  studies.  Even
though we searched as extensively as possible, we may have missed
eligible  studies,  such  as  studies  reported  only  in  dissertations
or  conference  proceedings.  For  missing  data,  we  systematically
sought  information  from  study  authors.  However,  most  of  our
attempts  to  contact  study  authors  were  unsuccessful,  and  most
data came from published sources.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

This  review  has  some  limitations.  We  could  not  determine
whether participants who received usual pharmacological care also
completed  their  own  exercise  independent  of  the  trials  exercise
intervention,  because  the  included  studies  poorly  described  the
content  of  usual  pharmacological  care  interventions.  In  some
studies,  we  could  not  determine  what  constituted  usual  care.
Participants in the usual pharmacological care groups could have
practised  exercises,  or  could  have  been  on  more  drugs  than
outlined in the study, which could explain why there was a smaller
effect size or no effect when comparing exercise to a control group.
A  possible  explanation  could  also  be  the  result  of  performance
bias,  due  to  lack  of  blinding,  inherent  in  exercise  interventions
and when using subjective participant-reported outcome measures
(PROMs). Another limitation was the heterogeneous use of outcome
measures amongst the included studies, making it difficult to meta-
analyse the data.

We  found  wide  variations  amongst  the  trials,  likely  related  to
different exercise components. Despite the prespecification stated
in our protocol, we could not perform subgroup analyses to explore
heterogeneity for factors such as exercise supervision or modalities
of  exercises.  We  had  to  decide  what  type  of  'exercise'  should  be
included;  we  excluded  single  bouts  of  exercise  (i.e.  one  exercise
session  or  exercise  test),  or  unstructured  exercise  (i.e.  no  clear
dosage prescription). The cutoff might be contentious, particularly
with  unstructured  exercise,  and  discussion  regarding  whether  to
include structured and unstructured exercise into another review
should  be  considered.  Last,  the  number  of  included  studies  and
participants in this review was too small.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

Three  different  systematic  reviews  have  examined  the  effects  of
exercise  in  people  with  SLE  (Lu  2021;  O'Dwyer  2017;  Wu  2017).
None  included  all  the  RCTs  we  identified,  all  of  which  compared
the effects of exercise to placebo, usual care alone, or another non-
pharmacological intervention.

O'Dwyer  2017  performed  a  systematic  review  and  included  11
studies  (Abrahão  2016;  Avaux  2016;  Benatti  2015;  Bogdanovic
2015;  Bostrom  2016;  Carvalho  2005;  Dos  Reis-Neto    2013;  Miossi
2012; Ramsey-Goldman 2000; Robb-Nicholson 1989; Tench 2003),
consisting of six RCTs and five quasi-RCTs. Five studies compared an
exercise intervention to a control group (usual care, or unchanged
physical  activity  status)  (Bostrom  2016;  Carvalho  2005;  Dos  Reis-
Neto    2013;  Miossi  2012;  Robb-Nicholson  1989),  and  two  studies
compared an aerobic exercise programme to a range of movement/
muscle strength programme  (Bogdanovic 2015; Ramsey-Goldman
2000). The systematic review included seven studies in the meta-
analyses  (Abrahão  2016;  Boström  2016;  Carvalho  2005;  Dos  Reis-
Neto    2013;  Miossi  2012;  Robb-Nicholson  1989;  Tench  2003).
Meta-analyses  were  deemed  appropriate  for  four  outcomes:
disease activity, fatigue, aerobic capacity, and depression. Results
showed  that  disease  activity  was  not  changed  following  exercise
interventions (MD 0.01, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.56), fatigue decreased in
the  exercise  intervention  group  compared  to  controls  (MD  −0.52,
95%  CI  −0.91  to  −0.13),  and  depression  scores  lowered  in  the
exercise groups compared to the controls (SMD −0.40 SD, 95% CI
−0.71 to −0.09). Most of these studies were at risk of selection and
reporting bias.

Wu 2017 performed a systematic review and included three studies
(Carvalho 2005; Ramsey-Goldman 2000; Tench 2003), consisting of
two RCTs and one quasi-experimental study. Aerobic exercise, three
times a week and of moderate intensity, was a common component
of the three studies. Two studies were conducted in a supervised
setting and one study was based at home. One study had a duration
of  eight  weeks  and  two  studies  had  a  duration  of  12  weeks.  All
three studies were included in the meta-analyses and showed that
compared to controls aerobic exercise training decreased fatigue
severity (MD −0.52, 95% CI −0.91 to −0.13), and showed a positive
effect  on  the  SF-36  Vitality  subscale  (MD  14.98,  95%  CI  7.45  to
22.52). However, the quality of evidence assessed using PEDro was
downgraded to fair (Tench 2003) or poor (Ramsey-Goldman 2000).

Lu 2021 performed a systematic review on the effects of exercise on
health-related quality of life and included nine studies, consisting
of five RCTs (Abrahão 2016; Bostrom 2016; Keramiotou 2020; Lopes-
Souza  2021;  Tench  2003),  and  four  non-RCTs  (random  allocation
or  control  group  were  not  available).  Not  all  studies  used  the
SF-36 Health-related Quality of Life measure or all of its subscales,
therefore, nine separate meta-analyses were conducted, including:
one  analysis  on  all  five  studies  regardless  of  the  health-related
quality of life measure; another analysis on four studies that used
the SF-36 Physical Function domain; and seven analyses on studies
that used the remaining seven domains of the SF-36. The results
of  the  meta-analysis  of  the  five  RCTs  showed  a  positive  effect  of
exercise on the physical health and function aspect (SF-36 Physical
Function and LupusQOL Physical Health) of health-related quality
of life amongst participants with SLE (Hedges' g: 0.468, 95% CI 0.206
to 0.730; P < 0.001). Heterogeneity between studies was low  (I2 =
19.2%; P = 0.292).

Our  findings  are  largely  consistent  with  the  findings  of  the
above  systematic  reviews  in  terms  of  exercise  effectiveness.  The
differences with our review are that we have included an updated
trial  (Hashemi  2022),  and  we  have  only  included  RCTs,  whereas
the  other  reviews  also  included  other  study  designs.  In  addition,
we included three separate analyses to evaluate the effectiveness
of  exercise  as  'adjunctive  therapy'  in  SLE  (exercise  plus  usual
pharmacological care versus 1. placebo plus usual pharmacological
care,  2.  usual  pharmacological  care  alone,  and  3.  another  non-
pharmacological  intervention  plus  usual  pharmacological  care).
This  review  adds  to  the  existing  knowledge  of  exercise  in  SLE  by
emphasising  that  exercise  can  be  used  as  an  adjunctive  therapy
to  the  usual  pharmacological  care  for  SLE.  The  reason  this  is
important is that most people with SLE will be taking or practising
one or more pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions
(or both), thus exercise should be considered as adjunctive to this;
it  would  be  difficult  to  know  the  true  effect  of  exercise  alone  on
people  with  SLE.  Furthermore,  this  review  revealed  the  lack  of
homogeneous study designs, outcome tools used, and lack of detail
in exercise prescription amongst trials, and has shown the need for
more rigorous studies in SLE and exercise to be considered.

uncertain  whether  exercise  results  in  fewer  or  more  withdrawals
(very low-certainty evidence).

We found low-certainty evidence that structured exercise plus usual
care compared with usual care alone may result in little to no effect
on  fatigue,  functional  capacity,  and  disease  activity,  measured
after the completion of the intervention. We are uncertain whether
exercise improves pain (very low-certainty evidence) or results in
fewer or more withdrawals (very low-certainty evidence).

We  found  moderate-  to  low-certainty  evidence  that  structured
exercise plus usual care compared to another non-pharmacological
intervention  (relaxation,  education,  support  aids)  plus  usual
care  may  reduce  fatigue  (low-certainty  evidence),  may  improve
functional  capacity  (low-certainty  evidence),  probably  results  in
little  to  no  difference  in  disease  activity  (moderate-certainty
evidence),  and  may  result  in  little  to  no  difference  in  pain
(low-certainty  evidence),  measured  after  the  completion  of  the
intervention. We are uncertain whether exercise results in fewer or
more withdrawals (very low-certainty evidence).

We are uncertain of the potential for harm from structured exercise,
because of the limited number of studies reporting adverse events.
We are unable to distinguish the best dosage of exercise, including
frequency, intensity, type, or its mode of delivery.

Considering  there  is  low-certainty  evidence  on  the  benefits  and
harms of exercise, clinicians should ensure that exercise is tailored
to the individual, prescribed according to the individuals' physical
abilities and limitations, and monitored by an exercise professional
(e.g.  exercise  physiologist,  physical  therapist,  physiotherapist).
People  with  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)  should  seek
advice from their healthcare team when starting any new exercise
programme,  choose  exercise  that  they  enjoy,  that  is  individually
appropriate to their physical ability, and avoid exercising in the sun
when the ultraviolet index is high (greater than 3).

Implications for research

The evidence for the major outcomes was moderate, low, or very
low  certainty,  so  new  studies  could  change  the  estimate  effects.
This review has raised new questions to answer and implications
for further research.

The  long-term  effects  of  structured  exercise  for  people  with  SLE,
and whether they are clinically relevant are unclear. Longitudinal
studies of exercise in SLE that report harms data (adverse events
and withdrawals, with reason) on more people with SLE, followed
for a longer duration (i.e. exercise performed for more than three
months) are needed to improve our understanding of the benefit/
risk ratio of exercise. Furthermore, well-designed trials are needed
to  elucidate  the  benefits/harms  of  exercise  in  SLE,  focusing  on
important  outcomes  such  as  disease  activity  using  standardise
outcome tools such as the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease
Activity Index (SLEDAI)-2K, damage indices such as Systemic Lupus
International Collaborating Clinics Damage Indices (SLICC-DI), and
specifically  looking  at  changes  in  serological  markers  including
anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), complement levels C3 and
C4,  as  well  as  inflammatory  markers  erythrocyte  sedimentation
rate,  C-reactive  protein,  and  interleukin-6.  Adverse  events  were
rarely  measured  or  reported  (or  both)  in  the  included  trials.

produces harmful effects is difficult to determine. Studies should
systematically investigate and report adverse events.

Future  trials  of  exercise  in  SLE  should  provide  an  accurate
description  of  the  content,  dose,  application,  and  adherence  to
the  exercise  interventions.  The  Consensus  on  Exercise  Reporting
Template, or the CONSORT Template for Intervention Description
and  Replication  should  be  used  in  future  trials  of  exercise  to
improve  the  description  of  exercise  programmes  and  facilitate
its  application  and  findings  in  clinical  practical.  Furthermore,
new  trials  of  exercise 
in  SLE  could  be  well-designed  and
double  blinded  to  effectively  compare  different  modes  (aerobic,
resistance,  range  of  motion),  intensities  (low,  moderate,  and
high  according  to  rating  of  perceived  exertion  or  percentage  of
maximum  heart  rate),  time  of  exercise  (i.e.  10-minute  or  60-
minutes  bouts),  or  a  combination  of  these.  We  also  recommend
that  future  trials  include  more  diverse  participants  (disease
activity,  age,  sex,  race/ethnicity,  functional  capacity),  and  results
be  further  analysed  by  subgroups.  In  particular,  we  recommend
that participants with higher disease activity (SLEDAI greater than
4) be included in future exercise trials. Further research should aim
to determine the efficacy of exercise interventions in people with
SLE receiving different therapies (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs,  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drugs,  biological  agents,
and no treatment).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Last,  standardised  efficacy  outcomes  in  exercise  trials  for  people
with  SLE  are  needed.  For  example,  all  studies  using  the  36-
item  Short  Form  questionnaire  to  assess  quality  of  life  should
report the Mental Component Summary and Physical Component
Summary  scores.  All  trials  should  report  disease  activity  using  a
standardised and validated tool such as SLEDAI to report changes
in  disease  activity  before  and  following  an  intervention,  to  add
further  information  regarding  the  potential  harms  or  benefits  of
exercise. Furthermore, all trials should measure and report fatigue,
functional capacity, and other exercise capacity measures such as
aerobic capacity and strength to determine the effectiveness of the
exercise intervention.

Time trial period: study process occurred between March 2011 and March 2012

Interventions: cardiovascular exercise plus usual care vs resistance exercise  plus usual care vs control
group plus usual care

Sample size calculation: sample size calculated based on primary outcome considering a clinically
significant difference with moderate treatment effect of 40%. Considering a significance level of 5%
and power of 90%, they estimated 20 participants in each group.

Analysis: data presented take into consideration that 2 participants dropped out of study, thus ITT
analyses performed to adjust the analysis of the intervention effects.

h. General Health Perception: 32.4 (SD 26.3)
i. Change in Health Status: 3.4 (SD 0.7)

Pretreatment group differences: the 3 groups were homogeneous for age, disease duration, weight,
and height at baseline.

Interventions

Exercise: cardiovascular training group plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity (65–75% of maximum HR according to the ACSM guide-
lines). Exercise intensity determined by HR reserve (HRR), which was calculated by HRR = MHR – RHR.
MHR determined using: MHR = 205 − (0.42 × age).

3. Time of exercise session: 50 min per session
4. Type of exercise: cardiovascular exercise walking and bicycle ergometry interventions (Model CLB 10
Classic, Caloi, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Each training session consisted of a 10-min warm-up followed by 30
min of exercise at target HR and a 10-min cool-down.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: trained professional in Rheumatology Services at Interlagos Specialty Outpa-

tient Clinic

Exercise: resistance training group plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week

2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity (65–75% of 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) according to the
ACSM guidelines). To establish the training intensity for each participant, their 1 RM for each exercise
was determined. Training intensity changed over time as the participants progressed.

3. Time of exercise session: 50 min per session
4. Type of exercise: resistance training exercise. Each session consisted of 8 exercises, including holds
(crucifix) with free weights, extension-machine exercises, rowing exercise with an elastic band, knee
flexion with ankle weights, 2-arm biceps curls, adduction exercises with an elastic band, French curls,
and abdominal exercises. Training involved small and large muscle group exercises. Participants per-
formed 3 sets of 15 repetitions with rest intervals of 1 min between sets.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: trained professional in the Rheumatology Services at Interlagos Specialty Out-

patient Clinic

Control group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Participants in control group received usual care and information about the disease, but no exercise in-
tervention. These participants were informed that they would receive the intervention after the study
was finished, and they would be invited to participate in the intervention that proved the most effec-
tive.

Outcomes

All outcomes measured at baseline and at 3 months.

1. Health-related quality of life: measured using the SF-36. Measure is grouped into 8 domains: Phys-
ical Functioning, Physical Role Functioning, Bodily Pain, General Health Perceptions, Vitality, Social
Role Functioning, Emotional Role Functioning, and Mental Health. Scores on each subscale ranged
from 0 to 100, with 0 = worst health status and 100 = best health status. Change in health status after
intervention from baseline was also assessed.

2. Severity of depression: measured using BDI. This is a 21-item, multiple-choice inventory. Individual
scale items are scored on a 4-point continuum (0 = least, 3 = most), with a total summed score range
of 0–63. Lower scores indicate a better outcome.

3. Disease activity: measured using SLEDAI. This gives a score range of 0–101, higher score = higher

overall disease activity.

4. Aerobic capacity: measured using the 12-min walk test. The more distance covered in 12 min = the

better the outcome.

High risk

Quote: "Patients in the control group received usual care and information

that they would receive the intervention after the study was finished".

Comment: it is evident that participants were not blinded to the study groups;
judged at high risk of bias.

Unclear risk

Assessor reported: unclear risk

The personnel conducting the assessor reported outcome for aerobic capac-
ity was not clearly identified, and, therefore, it is unclear whether assessors
were blinded to the study design and groups. Authors did report that the same
rheumatologist clinically evaluated participants during the course of the inter-
vention, who was blinded to the hypothesis; however, it is unclear if they were
blinded to the groups. 

Participant reported: high risk

Assessors (i.e. participants) were not blinded to the self-reported outcome
measures (i.e. fatigue); judged at high risk of bias.

2 participants dropped out of study for unknown reasons, and ITT was per-
formed to analyse intervention effects.

Authors assessed QoL using the SF-36 questionnaire; however, did not report
the Mental Component Summary score or the Physical Component Summary
score, or both.

Study characteristics

Methods

Study design: quasi-randomised 3-arm parallel RCT

Setting: supervised training group trained in the hospital-based revalidation centre under the supervi-
sion of a multidisciplinary team, while the home training group exercised at home on their own.

Time trial period: process occurred between June 2012 and January 2013

Interventions: home training group plus usual care vs supervised training group plus usual care vs
plus usual care (control group)

Sample size calculation: pilot and exploratory study, therefore, study author did not perform statisti-
cal power analyses.

Analysis: results were compared by paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests, as appropriate.

Participants

Number of participants

1. Screened: 45
2. Randomised: 42 (18 in home training group, 15 in supervised training group, and 9 in control group). 3
did not meet the inclusion criteria at baseline (screening failures: FSS too low in 1, and major physical
disability in 2).

3. Included in 3-month analyses: 39 (17 in home training group, 14 in supervised training group, 8 in
control group). 3 participants left the protocol during the first 3 months due to disease flare (n = 1), or
personal reasons (n = 2). However, it is unclear which reason was associated to which group.

2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity (60–80% of theoretical MHR). The modified Borg scale was

used to determine participant's perception of exertion at PWC75%.

3. Time of exercise session: not specified. Participants were asked to perform 3 hours of exercise per

week.

4. Type of exercise: endurance exercise (walking or bicycle) and strengthening exercises (elastic band

or weights for upper and lower limbs), performed at home on their own.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Setting: unsupervised and performed at home.

Exercise: supervised training group plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: not specified. Participants were asked to perform 3 hours of exercise

per week.

2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity (60–80% of theoretical MHR). The modified Borg scale was

used to determine participant's perception of exertion at PWC75%.

3. Time of exercise session: not specified. Participants were asked to perform 3 hours of exercise per

week.

4. Type of exercise: endurance exercise (walking or bicycle) and strengthening exercises (elastic band
or weights for upper and lower limbs), performed in hospital-based revalidation centre under super-
vision of multidisciplinary team.
5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: supervised by multidisciplinary team in hospital-based revalidation centre.

At the start of programme, the home and supervised groups participated in a multidisciplinary infor-
mation session about the benefits of exercise in SLE, during which practical information was also de-
livered. Participants in the home and supervised groups were asked to record their number of training
hours.

Control group (usual care alone)

Participants in the control group did not participate in the information session and were asked not to
change their level of physical activity.

Outcomes

All outcomes measured at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months.

1. Change in fatigue: measured using Krupp's FSS. FSS is a 9-item questionnaire, scored on a 7-point
Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree, and 7 = strongly agree. Minimum raw score is 9 and maximum
score is 63. However, the mean of all scores can also be taken with a minimum score of 1 and a max-
imum score of 7. Higher score = greater fatigue severity. A change score of 1.9 points is considered a
clinically important change.

2. Cardiorespiratory endurance: assessed as physical working capacity (expressed in Watts/kilogram
bodyweight) measured at 75% of the predicted MHR (PWC75%/kg). This index was calculated during a
multistage submaximal bicycle test, starting at 30 W and increased by 30 W every 2 min, until partic-
ipant's HR reached ≥ 75% of predicted value. The modified BORG scale was used to determined par-
ticipant's perception of exertion at PWC75%(data not shown in this study).

3. Compliance: measured by training hours recorded by participants. They subdivided participants into
2 groups, those who performed > 50% of prescribed exercises (compliant group n = 15) and those who
performed less (non-compliant group n = 15), irrespective of their initial assignment to the home or
supervised group.

Risk of bias

Bias

Authors' judgement

Support for judgement

Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)

High risk

Although the authors reported randomisation in the methods, we considered
this study to be quasi-randomised. Method of randomisation was not truly ran-
dom; judged at high risk of bias. 

Quote: "Patients living less than 30 min away from the hospital were included
in the supervised training group (STG), the others in the home training group
(HTG). Those patients who declined to train (n = 4) or refused their allocation
(n = 7) constituted the control group (CG)".

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

High risk

No allocation concealment was reported in the article. However, based on the
randomisation process described above, there was a selection bias based on
the geographical location of the participants; judged at high risk of bias.

Blinding of participants
and personnel (perfor-
mance bias)
All outcomes

Blinding of outcome as-
sessment (detection bias)
All outcomes

High risk

Being an active exercise intervention, it is not possible to blind the participants
and supervisors of the intervention; judged at high risk of bias.

High risk

Assessor reported: unclear risk

It is unclear whether the outcome assessor assessing the outcome physical
working capacity was also the exercise programme supervisor, and, therefore,
the blinding of outcome assessment was unclear.

Participant reported: high risk

Outcomes such as fatigue is a participant-reported outcome, and the partici-
pants knew which group they were in; judged at high risk of detection bias.

Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias)
All outcomes

High risk

Authors did not clearly report any data for participants who withdrew from the
study after baseline. We assumed that analysis was conducted per protocol,
and not ITT; judged at high risk of bias.

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

High risk

Authors clearly reported that they did not show data for cardiorespiratory en-
durance at 3 months and 9 months, despite it being measured.

Quote: "By contrast, the PWC75%/kg and the Borg scale did not improve over
time in none of the 3 groups, nor at month 3, neither at month 9 (data not
shown)".

Methods

Study design: single-centre, parallel-group, 3-arm RCT. Study is part of a larger clinical trial that aims
to comprehensively investigate the effects of exercise training on autonomic function and cardiorespi-
ratory parameters (data previously published), inflammatory markers, and cardio-metabolic risk fac-
tors in people with SLE (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01515163) (Miossi 2012).

Setting: Laboratory of Physical Conditioning for Rheumatologic Patients of the School of Medicine,
University of São Paulo, Brazil

Time trial period: not reported

Interventions: supervised exercise training group SLE plus usual care vs non-trained SLE control group
(usual care alone) vs healthy controls who performed a supervised exercise training group

Sample size calculation: not reported

Analysis: Kolmogorov–Smirnov's test with Lilliefor's correction revealed that only the glucose levels
and total cholesterol levels showed a normal distribution. Therefore, all other dependent variables
were tested by non-parametric tests. Independent samples were compared using the Mann–Whitney
U test, whereas dependent samples were compared using the Wilcoxon test. Glucose and total choles-
terol levels were tested by an unpaired T test for independent samples and the paired T test for depen-
dent samples. Furthermore, Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the use of drugs at baseline be-
tween SLE trained (SLE-TR) and non-trained (SLE-NT) groups. Finally, effect sizes were calculated. The
significance level was set at P < 0.05. All analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS), version 19.0 for Windows.

Methods

Study design: single-centre, parallel-group, 2-arm RCT

Setting: intrahospital gymnasium, Laboratory of Physical Conditioning for Rheumatologic Patients of
the School of Medicine (LACRE), University of São Paulo, Brazil

Time trial period: not reported

Interventions: supervised exercise training plus usual care vs usual care alone

Sample size calculation: not reported

Analysis: to minimise the impact of interindividual variability, all values were converted into delta
scores (i.e. post−pre values) and thereafter tested by a mixed model, considering pre values from all
dependent variables as covariates. Tukey post hoc was used for multiple comparisons. Baseline data
were compared using Fisher's exact tests and unpaired Student's t-tests. Cohen's d was used to deter-
mine between-group effect sizes for dependent variables. The significance level was previously set at P
≤ 0.05, with a trend towards significance being accepted at P ≤ 0.1. All analyses were performed using
SAS 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. Data were presented as means ± SDs. Post hoc power analy-
ses were performed with the assistance of the G-Power software (Version 3.1.2) and demonstrated a
power of 70% and 60% at an alpha level of 5% to detect significant differences in insulin sensitivity (as-
sessed by the HOMA IR and AUCinsulin in response to the MT) between trained and non-trained partici-
pants, with effect sizes of −1.0 and −0.8.

Interventions

Exercise intervention group plus usual care

Phase 1 (0–3 months)

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 2 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: high (65–80% of maximum HR or a rating of 13–16 out of 20 on the Borg Rating

of Perceived Exertion scale)

3. Time of exercise session: 60 min per session
4. Type of exercise: mainly aerobic exercise (about 20 min) and muscle strength and endurance exer-
cise (about 15 min). Note: participants could alternatively choose any preferred self-managed high-
intensity physical activity, as some participants lived far from the hospital.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks (supervised as described above)

Note: physical activity at low-to-moderate intensity was self-managed and consisted of any type of pre-
ferred physical activity.

Phase included: 1-hour education session held by a rheumatologist and another by a physiotherapist
to educate them on: their disease, the risk for cardiovascular disease, the treatment of the disease, and
the importance of, and how to perform, physical activity and exercise. It also included education on
how to use a HR monitor, how to assess intensity according to Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale,
and how to document physical activity with modes, frequency, durations, and intensities. This phase
also included supervised exercise training, 30 min of individual coaching of physical activity at 6- and
12 weeks, loan and use of HR monitor, and use of a physical activity diary.

Phase 2 (4–9 months)

During this period, the physical activity was self-managed with the help of videotapes or sound cas-
settes (or both) from the high-intensity aerobic group exercise programme performed during the first 3
months. As an alternative, any physical activity at high intensity could be chosen.

This phase included: 30 min of individual coaching of physical activity at 6 and 9 months, use of HR
monitor, and use of the physical activity diary. Participants also received 10 min of telephone support
which reduced towards the end of 12 months.

Phase 3 (9–12 months)

This phase included use of the HR monitor and physical activity diary.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Participants were asked not to change their physical activity lifestyle during the study period and they
were not given any specific information related to the study.

Outcomes

All outcomes measured at baseline; at month 0 (2–3 weeks after baseline when the intervention start-
ed); and after 3, 6, and 12 months.

1. Aerobic capacity: VO2max in mL/kg/min, maximum watts, and maximum exercise time duration was
recorded. In addition to VO2max, 60% and 80% of VO2max were measured. This outcome was measured
using a maximal symptom-limited, bicycle ergometer exercise test (test was terminated when partic-
ipant had indicated exhaustion). The higher the result, the better the outcome.

2. Frequency of physical activity: physical activity defined as all types of housework, gardening, walk-
ing, dancing, or regular physical activity that increase HR and exertion levels. This was measured by 2
self-reported questionnaires concerning frequency of physical activity for high intensity physical ac-
tivity and low-to-moderate physical activity performed during the week (i.e. how often have you been
physically active at high intensity, at least 30 minutes? "Never or irregularly, once a week, 2–3 times
per week, 4–5 times per week, or 6–7 times per week").

3. Health-related quality of life: measured using the SF-36. Each of the 8 domains were reported. Pos-

sible score for each of the 8 subscales is 0–100; the higher the score, the better the function.

4. Disease activity: measured using the modified version of SLEDAI. This gave a score range 0–101, and

the higher the score, the higher the overall disease activity.

5. Organ damage: measured using the SLICC. Score range 0–46, where 0 indicates no damage and 46

worst damage.

Study characteristics

Methods

Study design: single-centre, parallel-group, 2-arm RCT

Setting: home-based exercise intervention

Time trial period: not reported

Interventions: exercise plus usual care vs another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care

Sample size calculation: sample size calculations were based on the desire to detect a 15% improve-
ment in exercise tolerance test time, using a 2-tailed t-test, with alpha set at 0.01. Based on results from
their pilot study, 24 participants per group provided 80% power to detect this difference. They deter-
mined 50 participants per disease group, to maintain power within diagnosis.

Analysis: differences between the 4 diseases-by-treatment groups at baseline were tested with F or
Chi2 tests, as appropriate. For each outcome (exercise tolerance test, endurance, fatigue, depression,
helplessness), a set of relevant variables were selected, by stepwise linear regression, for use as co-
variates and selected for significance easting to reduce the likelihood of false positives due to multiple
testing. Overall tests of the intervention effect were performed with multivariate analysis of variance.
All analyses were performed with SAS on an IBM PS2 computer. 

Participants

Number of total participants (SLE and RA)

1. Who received recruitment letters: 196 participants with RA (84 required further information) and 158

Interventions

Exercise: treatment group plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week
2. Time of exercise session: 30 min per session
3. Intensity of exercise: moderate-to-high (60–80% of maximum HR achieved on the exercise tolerance

test)

4. Type of exercise: aerobic exercise performed on a stationary bike that was set up in their home.
5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks

A physiotherapist contacted the participant once a week to update logs of exercise, report of symp-
toms, and perceived fatigue. Pulse oximeters were provided to help participants monitor their HRs and
as a compliance-enhancing strategy. The physiotherapist instructed the participant at home when set-
ting up the bike, and made a second visit 2–3 weeks later at an exercise session to check the partici-
pants' ability to follow the regimen correctly.

Control group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Participants were encouraged to maintain their current level of activity during the 12-week pro-
gramme. They also filled out questionnaires and were contacted once per week as an attention control.

Outcomes

All outcomes measured at baseline and 3 months.

1. Fatigue

a. Measured using the MAC questionnaire, which assesses energy for daily activities. The MAC scale is
the sum of 4 VAS, and ranges from 0 (no fatigue/lots of energy) to 40 (extreme fatigue/no energy).
Higher scores indicate worse fatigue.

b. Measured using the POMS Fatigue questionnaire, which assesses mood. The POMS scale sums re-
sponses to 6 adjectives (bushed, tired, etc.) on a 5-point Likert scale, covering the last week, and
has response ranging from 0 (not at all fatigued) to 30 (extremely fatigued). Higher scores indicate
worse fatigue.

2. Depression: measured using the CES-D, a 20-item measure of the frequency of various somatic and
psychological symptoms over the last month. Scores range from 0 (no depression) to 60 (extremely
depressed). A score of > 16 indicates clinical depression.

3. Helplessness: helplessness, or the perceived lack of ability to control and cope with one's arthritis,
measured by the 15-item Arthritis Helplessness Index, with scores ranging from 15 (low helplessness)
to 60 (great helplessness).

4. Exercise tolerance: measured using a graded exercise tolerance test using a cycle ergometer, start-
ing at 30 W and increasing by 30 W every 3 min until the participant asked to stop the test. Electrocar-
diogram, blood pressure, and symptoms were carefully monitored for signs of exercise intolerance.
Exercise test was stopped if the participant exhibited angina, fall in blood pressure, severe shortness
of breath, ≥ 3 premature ventricular contractions in sequence. The time taken to complete the test
was recorded (higher the time = the better the outcome).

Unclear risk

Assessor reported: unclear risk

It is unclear whether the assessors were blinded from the intent of the study or
knew which participants were in which group. 

Quote: "The testing was administered by a cardiologist and nurse in an exer-
cise physiology laboratory".

Participant reported: high risk

Assessors (i.e. participants) were not blinded to study groups, and performed
self-reported outcome measures (i.e. depression); judged at high risk of bias.

Low risk

No evidence of attrition bias.

Low risk

All outcome measures were reported for all participants.

Other bias

Low risk

No other bias identified.

try and monitored by frequency meter (Poland Electro, Kempele, Finland). Intensity of walking was
unclear.

3. Time  of  exercise  session:  60-min  sessions  (10-min  warm-up,  40  min  of  walking  and  10-min  cool-

down)

4. Type of exercise: walking, outdoors in the morning
5. Duration of intervention: 16 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: in the morning at a public park, supervised by a physical educator or physician.

Control group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Participants received usual care and information about the disease, but no exercise intervention. Re-
ceived clear instruction not to start any exercise programme for the next 16 weeks.

Outcomes

Outcomes measures at baseline and postintervention (16 weeks)

1. Endothelial function: measured using resting diameter, hyperaemia diameter and flow-mediated di-
lation, ergospirometry. Non-invasive methods of measuring endothelial function include ultrasound
flow-mediated dilation, salbutamol-mediated endothelial function measured by pulse wave analysis
or pulse contour analysis, flow-mediated magnetic resonance imaging, laser Doppler flowmetry, and
flow-mediated pulse amplitude tonometry.

2. Ergospirometric  assessment:  ergospirometry  was  performed  at  the  laboratory  of  the  Center  for
Studies in Psychobiology and Exercise using a Quark PFT ergospirometric testing device. (pulmonary
function test) (Cosmed, Italy). Measured through the continuous analysis of carbon monoxide and
methane (tracer) fractions with fast analysers. Normal value is 95% confidence interval. Test measures
the amount of air the lungs can hold. Test also measures how forcefully one can empty air from the
lungs.

3. Disease Activity: measured using the SLEDAI. This gives a score range 0–101, and the higher the score,

the higher the overall disease activity.

evaluators".

In the exercise group, assessments were performed 72 hours after the last
training session to reduce the possible effects of acute exercise.

Participant reported: high risk

Because the assessor (i.e. participants) were not blinded to the self-reported
outcomes measures (i.e. fatigue); judged at high risk of bias.

Interventions

Exercise plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 5 days/week
2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity determined by HRR 50–50%, according to the ACSM guide-

lines. HRR = MHR − RHR. MHR determined using formula: MHR = 205 − (0.42 × age).

3. Time of exercise session: 30 min per session (3- to 5-min warm-up, 4 sets of combined exercise ses-
sion for approximately 30 min in total, and final set of 3- to 5-min of relaxation and stretching). Each
set of combined exercise lasting for 7 min 15 s, with a brief break between sets.

4. Type  of  exercise:  aerobic  exercise  combined  with  bodyweight  or  500–620  mL  of  dumbbell  water
weights for resistance training. Combined exercise sessions consisted of various styles of basic exer-
cises, alternating workouts of legs with trunk movement, and arm exercises.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: home-based exercise. The research team member contacted participants pe-
riodically by telephone or text messages to ensure their compliance. Each week the participants re-
ported their maximal HR after each exercise session by written logs. Instructed by an exercise physi-
ologist/professional exercise instructor on the performance of aerobic exercise combined with resis-
tance training and the skills of HR measurement at rest and after exercise.

Control group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Participants received usual care and information about the disease, but no exercise intervention. They
were to maintain their usual lifestyle.

Outcomes

All outcomes measured at baseline and postintervention (12 weeks).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1. Disease activity: measured using SLEDAI-2K at baseline and after 12-week intervention. This gives a

score range 0–101, higher score = higher the overall disease activity.

2. Executive performance (reaction time and the performance index): measured using the go/no-go

test and Stroop Task.
a. Go/no go: upon receiving an indicative stimulus for action (i.e. go signal), which was displayed on
a computer screen, the participant pressed the assigned keyboard button as quickly as possible.
Alternatively, upon receiving a distractor stimulus (i.e. no-go signal), the participant held their ac-
tion. The participants performed a set of go (160 trials) and no-go (40 trials) stimuli. Reaction time
measured as mean time required for pressing the button after the stimuli. Accuracy defined as the
percentage of correct responses to both the indicative and distractor stimuli.

b. Stroop Task: comprised a series of colour words presented on a screen. In the incongruent trial
(100 trials in total), a mismatch existed between the name of the colour and the colour shown on
the screen. In the congruent trials (100 trials in total), colour words were presented as a matching
colour. All the words were written in the official national language and were displayed on the screen
1 at a time. The participants were asked to respond as quickly as possible by pressing the corre-
sponding keyboard button that represented the actual colour and make as few errors as possible
during this task. Reaction time measured as time required for pressing the button after the word
appeared on the screen. Accuracy for each of the congruent and incongruent trials was calculated
as the percentage of correctly pressed keyboard buttons.

3. Physical fitness: measured using a 2-km walking test. The faster the test was completed (lower time
recorded), the better the result of the physical fitness test was. Recorded in minutes and seconds.

Study characteristics

Methods

Study design: quasi-randomised 2-arm parallel controlled trial

Setting: Greece 

Time trial period: unknown

Interventions: exercise group (combined resistance and stretching) plus usual care vs another non-
pharmacological intervention plus usual care

Sample size calculation: a sample size of 32 participants per group was required for an 80% probabil-
ity of demonstrating a difference of 15% between comparison groups (exercise: −25% (SD 20%) vs con-
trol: −10% (SD 20%)) in percentage change of DASH score from baseline to 12 weeks with a significance
of < 5% (2-tailed test). Participants of pilot study were included in the final sample. The estimation of
sample size was performed using G*Power V.3.1.9.2 programme.  

Analysis: data were expressed as mean ± SD or median (in case of violation of normality) for continu-
ous variables and as percentages for categorical data. The Kolmogorov Smirnov test utilised for nor-
mality analysis of the parameters. The comparison of variables at each time point between interven-
tions was performed using the independent samples t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. All
tests were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. All analyses were carried out using
the statistical package SPSS V.21.00 (IBM Corporation).

Interventions

Exercise group (combined resistance and stretching) plus usual care

Outcomes

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 7 days/week
2. Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity. Initial intensity of exercise set at a moderate level and pro-
gramme was reassessed, using a modified Borg Scale (a tool to measure a persons' perception of their
effort and exertion, breathlessness, and fatigue during physical work) to maintain the same intensity,
in every face-to-face session with the hand therapist at 0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks.

3. Time of exercise session: 30 min per session
4. Type of exercise: upper-limb exercises (9 strengthening and stretching exercises for the upper ex-
tremities with a stick, 10 strengthening and stretching exercises for the fingers, and 11 strengthening
exercises against resistance with therapeutic putty).

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks (and 24 weeks' follow-up, we did not report these measurements)
6. Supervision/setting: none reported

Control group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Participants had 4 sessions of training in alternative methods of performing daily activities, use of aids,
joint protection and energy conservation, additionally to assessment at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks,
in order to keep them also committed and motivated. All participants received the same training in al-
ternative methods of performing daily activities, use of aids, joint protection, and energy conservation.

1. Performance of daily activities: measured using DASH at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. It was 30
items regarding symptoms and function. Items were scored on a scale from 1 (no difficulty) to 5 (ex-
treme difficulty/unable to do). A high score indicates a decreased ability in performances of daily ac-
tivities.

2. Functional ability: measured using the HAQ. Total score 0–3, in 0.125 increments. Lower scores in-
dicate better function, and higher scores indicate worse function and greater disability. Measured at
baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

3. Grip and pinch strength: measured using the Jamar dynamometer and pinch gauge tool using the
DH at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. 3 trials were recorded, and the mean score was recorded after
attempts complete by participants.

4. Dexterity: measured using the Purdue pegboard test at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. DH was required
to be used. Participants were asked to take as many pins as possible in 30 s, out of a cup and place
each 1 into a hole in a board. The greater the number of pins the better the result.

5. QoL: measured using the LupusQOL Questionnaire at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Evaluating 8 do-
mains, each domain is scored separately, score range 0–100, with greater values indicating better QoL.
6. Pain: measured using VAS Pain, scored on 0–10 scale, with a lower score indicating less pain. Measured

at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

7. Fatigue: measured using the LupusQOL Fatigue domain at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Score range

0–100, higher the score indicates less fatigue.

Quote: "A hand therapist (KK) assessed all patients at baseline, 6, 12 and 24
weeks. Rheumatologists working in the two hospitals evaluated all partici-
pants and were masked to group allocation. Clinical evaluation included ten-
der and swollen joint count".

It is unclear from this statement whether the hand therapist was also masked
to group allocation; judged at unclear risk.

Participant reported: high risk

Participants were not blinded to the study, and outcomes were self-reported;
judged at high risk of bias.

In the summary table of results, it was unclear how many participants were
included in the postintervention outcome data, considering 2 participants
withdrew from the exercise programme at 6 weeks, with no clear reason for
dropout. 

Quote: "One patient in the exercise group was diagnosed with influenza and
treated with oseltamivir".

However, it was unclear whether this was the participant that dropped out,
and they did not report anything regarding the second participant who
dropped out.

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

The LupusQOL is used to assess QoL; however, authors did not report all do-
mains. Only Physical Health and Fatigue domains were reported.

Study characteristics

Methods

Study design: randomised controlled 2-arm parallel trial 

Setting: Laboratorio de Vibracoes Mecanicas e Practicas Integrativas, Departamento de Biofisica, Insti-
tuto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro,
RJ, Brazil

Time trial period: recruited between May 2017 and November 2018

Interventions: WBVE plus usual care vs placebo (isometry) plus usual care

Sample size calculation: performed by a previous study using the HAQ based on minimal clinically im-
portant difference of 0.22 in HAQ score (SD 0.19) between 2 groups.

Analysis: descriptive analysis performed by mean ± SD for continuous variables, and absolute and rela-
tive frequency for categorical variables. To compare the variables between the intervention groups, the
t test was used for the continuous variables and the Chi2 test for the categorical variables. To evaluate
the effect of the intra group intervention according to the moment of the evaluation (time) the paired
t test was used, as well as 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The difference between the initial
and final means of each group and the comparison of this difference between groups was performed
using the paired t test. To minimise the effect of possible confounding variables on outcomes, the dif-
ferent variables between the groups at randomisation were considered as adjustment variables when
comparing the intervention between the groups. The adjusted model was performed by multiple linear
regression. For all analyses performed, the value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

b. Week 5–12: 2-min warm-up, 10 min WBVE

Outcomes

4. Type of exercise: WBVE is a subgroup of resistance training, better classified as muscle activation or
neuromuscular training complementary to resistance training. The participants were positioned on
the vibrating platform with 130° of knee flexion.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: unclear if there was supervision present during intervention.

Control group: placebo (isometry) plus usual care

Participants stood on a vibrating platform (switched off).

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 2 times/week (24 hours between sessions)
2. Intensity of exercise: light-to-moderate intensity, warm-up was performed in the same way as in the

WBVE group.

3. Time of exercise session:

a. Week 1–4: 2-min warm-up, 5 min stood on a vibrating platform
b. Week 5–12: 2-min warm-up, 10 min stood on a vibrating platform

4. Type of exercise: participants were requested to maintain stance with 130° of knee flexion on the
same vibrating platform (turned off). The deck panel remained covered. The cycles, working, and rest
times corresponded to the weeks, consistent with the WBVE group, but without vibration.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: unclear if there was supervision present during intervention.

1. Fatigue: measured using the FACIT-Fatigue (version 4) is a 13-item questionnaire that uses a 5-point
Likert-type response scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; and 4 = very
much), with scores ranging from 0 to 52 (higher scores indicating less fatigue). FACIT-Fatigue scale was
completed before the intervention at weeks 0, 6, and 12.

2. Functional capacity: measured using the HAQ and the Timed Up and Go test.

a. The HAQ consists of 20 questions, which represent common daily activities, and evaluates 8 cat-
egories:  dress  and  physical  presence,  wake  up,  feed,  walk,  hygiene,  reach,  footprint,  and  other
day-to-day activities. The answer alternatives for each question are 'no difficulty' (score = 0), with
'some difficulty' (score = 1), "very difficult" or 'using an auxiliary device' (score = 2) and 'unable to
do' (score = 3). The highest score obtained for any question in a given subcategory determines the
score for it. A final score is calculated based on the sum of the highest scores in each subcategory
divided by the number of subcategories that were answered. Total score range from 0 (no disabil-
ity) to 3 (severe disability). The HAQ questionnaire was completed by the women just before the
intervention at 0, 6, and 12 weeks.

b. The Timed Up and Go consisted of measuring the time use for participants to stand up from a chair,
walking 3 m, turning, returning to the chair and sitting down. Instructed to walk in a comfortable
and safe pace. The final score was the duration of time in which it took for the participant to com-
plete this test, safely and correctly.

3. QoL: measured using the SF-36, which is a common tool for assessing QoL in chronic diseases, and
it can be used in any disease, including SLE. It consists of 36 items, grouped into 8 domains cover-
ing physical and mental health. The 8 domains include: Functional Capacity, Physical Role Function-
ing, Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Role Functioning, Emotional Role Limitations, and Emotional
Wellbeing. The score of these domains ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better health. The
SF-36 survey was completed by the women at 0, 6, and 12 weeks.

4. Hand grip strength: evaluated by a hand-held dynamometer performed through 3 evaluations, where
the participant held the dynamometer (EMG830RF, EMG System, Sao Jose dos Campos/SP) with the
DH 3 times in a row for 5 'seconds.' The best value of the 3 measurements was used to classify sar-
copenia. Quote: "The higher the score, the better the strength".

Sample size calculation: not reported

Analysis: effect sizes were estimated for the postintervention assessments using the pooled SDs of
the 2 independent samples at postintervention. The significance level was previously set at P < 0.05.
All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 8.2. Data were presented as mean and SD. As
the primary analysis, ITT analysis was used for each comparison irrespective of the compliance with ex-

Interventions

Exercise: trained SLE plus usual care

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 2 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: HR corresponding to the interval between VAT and 10% below RCP
3. Time of exercise session: 80 min per session
4. Type of exercise: training session composed of 5-min treadmill warm-up followed by 35–40 min of
resistance training, 30 min of treadmill aerobic training, and 5 min of stretching. Resistance training
included 7 exercises for the main muscle groups (e.g. bench press, leg press, leg extension). Partici-
pants were required to perform 4 sets of 8–12 RM, except during the first week, when a reduced volume

of 2 sets of 15–20 RM for each exercise was performed (as an adaptation period to resistance training).
Cardiorespiratory exercise test was performed on a treadmill (Centurion, Model 200, Micromed) using
a maximal-graded exercise protocol.
5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: all sessions were monitored by 1 fitness professional.

Non-trained SLE group (another non-pharmacological intervention plus usual care)

Physically inactive women were advised to remain physically inactive. Participants received usual care
and information about the disease, but no exercise intervention.

Heathy control group 

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: HR corresponding to the interval between VAT and 10% below RCP.
3. Time of exercise session: 80 min per session
4. Type of exercise: training session composed of 5-min treadmill warm-up followed by 35–40 min of
resistance training, 30 min of treadmill aerobic training, and 5 min of stretching. Resistance training
included 7 exercises for the main muscle groups (e.g. bench press, leg press, leg extension). Partici-
pants were required to perform 4 sets of 8–12 RM, except during the first week, when a reduced volume
of 2 sets of 15–20 RM for each exercise was performed (as an adaptation period to resistance training).
Cardiorespiratory exercise test was performed on a treadmill (Centurion, Model 200, Micromed) using
a maximal-graded exercise protocol.
5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: all sessions were monitored by 1 fitness professional.

Participants with SLE and healthy controls had not engaged in regular physical activity programme for
≥ 6 months before the commencement of study and were instructed to maintain their usual living activ-
ities and not to engage in any other regular exercise programme throughout the study.

1. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak): oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output were obtained
through breath-by-breath sampling and expressed as a 30-s mean using an indirect calorimetry sys-
tem  (Cortex  Model  Metalyzer  III  B).  This  was  measured  using  a  maximal-graded  exercise  test  on  a
treadmill. Measured at baseline and 12 weeks.

2. Chronotropic reserve: HR response during exercise was evaluated by the formula chronotropic re-
serve = [peak HR − resting HR/220 − age − resting HR] × 100. HRR was defined as the difference between
HR at peak exercise and at both the first (HR recovery 1) and (HR recovery 2) minutes after exercise.
Absolute change was used to calculate the difference between the HR at peak exercise and at the first
and second minutes after the exercise test. Relative change for HR was calculated for the intervals
between rest to VAT, rest to RCP, and rest to peak exercise. Measured at baseline and 12 weeks.

Study characteristics

Methods

Study design: 3-arm RCT

Setting: Bone and Joint Research Unit, Department of Psychological Medicine, Barts; the London,
Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry; National Sports Medicine Institute; Barts and the Lon-
don NHS Trust, London, UK

Time trial period: unknown

Interventions: aerobic exercise programme plus usual care vs another non-pharmacological interven-
tion (relaxation exercise) plus usual care vs usual care alone

Sample size calculation: in a previous study of exercise therapy and fibromyalgia, 50% of participants
considered themselves moderately improved by the treatment compared with 10% of controls receiv-
ing flexibility training. By assuming similar treatment responses with a = 0.05 and a power of 90%, the
study authors calculated that 30 participants would be required for each group.

Analysis: statistical analysis used the SPSS 10.0 for Windows software package (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). All participants who underwent random allocation were analysed according to group assign-
ment. The Clinical Global Impression Change score was analysed categorically; a score of 1 or 2 was
considered clinically important. We compared the proportions of participants rating themselves clini-
cally improved by ITT analysis by means of ×2 analysis with Fisher's exact test for small numbers. 1-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction or the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare means
and medians of each variable in the 3 groups as appropriate.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Participants were asked to continue with their normal daily activity pattern and specifically asked to
avoid doing any extra physical activities. They were reviewed at follow-up but not seen at any other
times. 

Outcomes

1. Fatigue: measured using the FSS, CFS, and VAS

a. FSS: FSS is a 9-item questionnaire, scored on a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree, and 7
= strongly agree. Minimum raw score is 9 and maximum score is 63. However, the mean of all scores
can also be taken with a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 7. Higher score = greater
fatigue severity. A change score of 1.9 points is considered a clinically important change. Measured
at baseline and 12 weeks.

b. CFS: was originally perceived as comprising 2 subscales that evaluate fatigue in the physical and
mental domains. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = better than usual, 1 = no more than
usual, 2 = worse than usual, 3 = much worse than usual), with higher scores indicating greater fa-
tigue. Measured at baseline and 12 weeks.

c. VAS: measured using VAS for fatigue. Study authors did not report which scale was used. However,

lower scores on VAS usually indicate a better outcome. Measured at baseline and 12 weeks.
2. Anxiety: measured using the HADS questionnaire, which consists of 7 questions for anxiety and 7
questions for depression. Questions are compiled, but scored separately. Score range is 0–21. Lower
scores indicate a better outcome (a score of 8–10 is mild, 11–14 moderate, and 15–21 severe).

3. Depression: measured using the HADS questionnaire, which consists of 7 questions for anxiety and 7
questions for depression. Questions are compiled, but scored separately. Score range is 0–21. Lower
scores indicate a better outcome (a score of 8–10 is mild, 11–14 moderate, and 15–21 severe).

4. Sleep: measured using the PSQI, which is a self-rated questionnaire that assesses sleep quality and
disturbances  over  a  1-month  period.  Consisting  of  19  individual  items,  generating  7  'component'
scores that include; subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency,
sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Score range from 0 (no diffi-
culty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The component scores are summed to produce a final global score (rang-
ing from 0 to 21). Higher scores indicate worse sleep quality.

5. Disease activity: measured using the SLAM, which includes both dimensions: disease activity and
disease severity over the previous 4 weeks. It assesses 9 organ systems (subjective items include, fa-
tigue, myalgia, arthralgia) and 7 laboratory items. There are 32 items. Score range from 0 to 83. Lower
score indicates less disease activity.

6. QoL: measured using the SF-36, which is a common tool for assessing the QoL in chronic diseases,
and it can be used in any disease, including SLE. It consists of 36 items, grouped into 8 domains cover-
ing physical and mental health. The 8 domains include: Functional Capacity, Physical Role Function-
ing, Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Role Functioning, Emotional Role Limitations, and Emotional
Wellbeing. The score of these domains ranges from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better health. The
study reported Physical Function, Physical Role, and Vitality domains.

7. Self-rated CGI change: this is a stand-alone assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global
functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication. Comprised of 2 companion 1-item mea-
sures evaluating severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and change from the initiation of treatment
on a scale of 1 to 7. Rated on a 7-point scale, this indicates the severity of illness scale using a range of
responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).

Risk of bias

Bias

Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)

Authors' judgement

Support for judgement

Low risk

Randomisation has been reported. 

Quote: "All 93 patients were randomly allocated to the exercise programme,
the relaxation programme or to no intervention, using a minimisation proto-
col".

Allocation concealment
(selection bias)

Unclear risk

No allocation concealment clearly reported, and, therefore, it was unclear
whether this was concealed.

Blinding of participants
and personnel (perfor-
mance bias)
All outcomes

Blinding of outcome as-
sessment (detection bias)
All outcomes

High risk

Being an active exercise intervention, it is not possible to blind the participants
and supervisors of the intervention; judged at high risk of bias.

Unclear risk

Assessor reported: unclear risk

No blinding of outcome assessment (disease activity) was clearly reported.

Participant reported: high risk

Participants completed self-reported outcomes, and participants knew which
group they were in; judged a high risk of bias.

Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias)
All outcomes

Low risk

Authors reported an ITT method of analysis.

Selective reporting (re-
porting bias)

High risk

Authors did not report scores for all 8 domains in the SF-36: Physical Function-
ing (10 items); Physical Role Limitations (4 items); Bodily Pain (2 items); Gener-
al Health Perceptions (5 items); Energy/Vitality (4 items); Social Functioning (2
items); Emotional Role Limitations (3 items), and Mental Health (5 items). Au-
thors also did not report the PCS score and the MCS score for this outcome.

Other bias

Low risk

No other biases.

Interventions

Anaerobic exercise programme

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: each exercise session was to be adjusted (intensity) by interpreting of the
training data and the rating of perceived pain and load every week. The recommendations are
based on heart rate in training zones related to individual anaerobic threshold.

3. Time of exercise session: 20–50 min for each training session. Including 5-min warm-up and 5-
min cool-down. Anaerobic training sessions are performed using an intermittent protocol with
heart  rate  above  the  individual  anaerobic  threshold  for  2–3  min  per  interval.  The  progression
stages in the anaerobic exercise group range from 3 intervals (1 interval of 3 min + 2 intervals of
2 min each) up to 8 intervals (8 intervals of 3 min each) with a 2-min walking break between in-
tervals.

4. Type of exercise: walking or running should be the main part of endurance training sessions. Per-
forming 1 or 2 strength training session weekly or integrating specified strength training exercises
into the endurance training (e.g. at the end of running or walking) was also suggested. 10 strength
exercises for major muscle groups that can be trained separately with elastic resistance bands, 3
sets with 15 repetitions per exercise each week was created for compilation. The compilation also
includes 10 relaxation exercises, recommended for after strength training sessions.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: every Monday, an individualised training schedule was sent to each partic-
ipant in both intervention groups. Participants are given a weekly protocol, where all physical
activities during the week, including all recommended (endurance and strength) and additional
activities, should be recorded. After each week, a sports therapist analyses the training data to
adapt the schedule for the following week according to participant self-reported values of pain
and training load.

Aerobic exercise programme

1. Frequency of exercise sessions: 3 times/week
2. Intensity of exercise: each exercise session was to be adjusted (intensity) by interpreting of the
training data and the rating of perceived pain and load every week. The recommendations are
based on heart rate in training zones related to individual anaerobic threshold.

3. Time of exercise session: 20–50 min for each training session. Including 5-min warm-up and 5-
min cool-down. Anaerobic training sessions are performed by using an intermittent protocol with
heart rate above the individual anaerobic threshold for 2–3 min per interval. The aerobic exercise
group performs aerobic training sessions for the whole programme.

4. Type of exercise: walking or running should be the main part of endurance training sessions. Per-
forming 1 or 2 strength training session weekly or integrating specified strength training exercises
into the endurance training (e.g. at the end of running or walking) was also suggested. 10 strength
exercises for major muscle groups that can be trained separately with elastic resistance bands, 3
sets with 15 repetitions per exercise each week was created for compilation. The compilation also
includes 10 relaxation exercises, recommended for after strength training sessions.

5. Duration of intervention: 12 weeks
6. Supervision/setting: every Monday, an individualised training schedule was sent to each partic-
ipant in both intervention groups. Participants are given a weekly protocol, where all physical
activities during the week, including all recommended (endurance and strength) and additional
activities, should be recorded. After each week, a sports therapist analyses the training data to
adapt the schedule for the following week according to participant self-reported values of pain
and training load.

Usual care

To assess the effect of the intervention programme, the control group (treatment as usual) will par-
ticipate in voluntary exercise that is assessed using a questionnaire for habitual physical activity.
These participants also received a smartwatch.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

1. VO2peak: measured using spiroergometry at weeks 0 and 12.

Secondary outcomes

1. Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions: scale consists of 20 items using a 5-point Lik-
ert scale, from absolutely agree to absolutely disagree, to assess cognitive fatigue (10 items) and
motor fatigue (10 Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions items). The scores for cognitive
and motor fatigue are added for the sum score. A cutoff value of 43 indicates mild fatigue, whereas
higher values are associated with moderate fatigue (≥ 53) or severe fatigue (≥ 63). Outcome mea-
sured at weeks 0, 12, and 24.

2. Beck-Depression Inventory: questionnaire consists of 21 sets of statements, which are ranked
in terms of severity from 0 to 3. The sum (range 0–63) indicates the severity of depression. The
standardised scale is 0–8, no depression; 9–13, minimal depression; 14–19, mild depression: 20–
28, moderate depression, 29–63: severe depression. Outcome measured at weeks 0, 12, and 24.
3. SLE disease activity index: index consists of 24 items including clinical and laboratory variables
to measure disease activity within the previous 10 days. Maximum score 105, scores > 3 indicate
a mild or moderate flare, and scores ≥ 12 indicate a severe flare. Outcome measured at weeks 0,
12, and 24.

4. Disease Activity Score-28: score indicates rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and treatment
response. It is composed of 4 measures including the number of swollen or tender joints, C-reac-
tive protein level, and patient's health assessment. A total score is calculated using the formula.
Values range from 2.0 to 10, where a higher value indicates higher disease activity. The score is a
valuable tool to assess the severity of joint involvement and activity in SLE. Outcome measured
at weeks 0, 12, and 24.

5. Work Ability Index: self-assessment questionnaire used to assess the work ability of the patients.
The questionnaire covers 6 dimensions including current work ability, as well as past 2-year es-
timation  amongst  others:  7–27  points  indicates  poor,  28–36  points  indicates  moderate,  37–43
points indicates good, and 44–49 points indicates very good work ability. Outcome measured at
weeks 0, 12, and 24.

6. Revised Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index: scoring system in-
cludes a score to measure the activity of skin lesions and a score to measure the damage to skin le-
sions in people with discoid lupus erythematosus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The score
is used as a follow-up parameter. It has been shown that scores correlate well with the physician's
and patient's global assessment of disease activity. Outcome measured at weeks 0, 12, and 24.
7.
 Autoantibody titres: DNA b (standard value ≤ 20 IU). Outcome measured at weeks 0, 12, and 24.
8. Complement level: C3c and C4 levels (standard values: C3c: 0.9–1.8 g/L; C4: 0.1–0.4 g/L). Out-

come measured at weeks 0, 12, and 24.

9. Circulating, cell-free DNA levels: concentration of circulating, cell-free DNA (ng/mL) measured
before, during, and after laboratory standardised stepwise exercise test from capillary and venous
blood samples. After centrifugation of the samples, the circulating cell-free DNA is determined by
a direct quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method from plasma without previous
DNA extraction. Compared to healthy participants, participants with SLE show higher circulating
cell-free DNA plasma levels. Outcome measured at weeks 0 and 12.

10.Extracellular vesicles: relative amount of extracellular vesicle subpopulations analysed using
bead isolation and size exclusion chromatography followed by protein marker characterisation.
Outcome measured at weeks 0 and 12.

11.Lactate levels: to estimate the lactate threshold, capillary blood samples were taken from the
fingertips using end-to-end capillary with a defined volume of 20 µL sodium heparin (EKF-Diag-
nostics GmbH) before analysis using the Biosen S-Line (EKF-Diagnostics GmbH). In this study, cap-
illary blood samples were taken at the beginning of the test, after each step of treadmill walking,
and 3 min after exhaustion. All samples were quantified directly after the test. To define the anaer-
obic lactate acid threshold or individual anaerobic threshold the Dickhuth model (baseline) +1.5
mmol/L model was used. Outcome measured at weeks 0 and 12.

12.Ventilatory threshold: change in ventilatory threshold after 12 weeks compared to baseline. Out-

come measured at weeks 0 and 12.

13.Muscle mass: muscle mass measured in absolute mass (kilograms) including internal organs us-

ing bioelectrical impedance analysis. Outcome measured at weeks 0 and 12.

Exercise group 1: home training

Participants performed endurance exercise (walking
or bicycle) and strengthening exercises (elastic band or
weights for upper and lower limbs), at home unsuper-
vised. The targeted intensity was moderate (60–80% of
theoretical maximal HR). The modified Borg scale was
used to determine participant's perception of exertion
at PWC75%.

Exercise group 2: supervised training

Participants performed the same exercise programme;
endurance exercise (walking or bicycle) and strength-
ening exercises (elastic band or weights for upper and
lower limbs), in the hospital-based revalidation cen-
tre under the supervision of the multidisciplinary team.
Targeted intensity was moderate (60–80% of theoret-
ical maximal HR). The modified Borg scale was used
to determine participant's perception of exertion at

muscle strength and endurance exercise (about 15
min). Intensity was set as high (65–80% of maximum
HR or a rating of 13–16 out of 20 on the BORG rating of
perceived exertion scale)

Note: participants could alternatively choose any pre-
ferred self-managed high-intensity physical activity, as
some participants lived far from the hospital.

Phase also included a 1-hour education session held
by a rheumatologist and another by a physiotherapist
to educate them on: their disease, the risk for cardio-
vascular disease, the treatment of the disease, and
the importance of, and how to perform, physical ac-
tivity and exercise. It also included education on how
to use a HR monitor, how to assess intensity accord-
ing to RPE scale, and how to document physical activ-
ity with modes, frequency, durations, and intensities.
This phase also included supervised exercise training,
30 min of individual coaching of physical activity at 6
and 12 weeks, loan and use of HR monitor, and use of a
physical activity diary.

Phase 2 (4–9 months)

During this period, the physical activity was self-man-
aged with the help of videotapes or sound cassettes (or
both) from the high-intensity aerobic group exercise
programme performed during the first 3 months. As an
alternative, any physical activity at high intensity could
be chosen.

This phase included: 30-min of individual coaching of
physical activity at 6 and 9 months, use of HR monitor,
and use of the physical activity diary. Participants also
received 10 min of telephone support which reduced
towards the end of the 12 months.

Phase 3 (9–12 months)

This phase included: use of the HR monitor, and use of
physical activity diary.

ercise programme included a 10-min warm-up, 10-min
of running on a treadmill, and 10 min of cycling, both at
an intensity of 50–60% of their VO2max, followed by 60

Participants in the 2 exercise groups received their
usual care plus they performed 1 type of exercise, de-
scribed below, 3 times/week, for 50 min for 12 weeks.
Both exercise groups were supervised by trained pro-
fessional in the Rheumatology Services at the Interla-
gos Specialty Outpatient Clinic.

Exercise group 1: cardiovascular training group

Participants received walking and bicycle ergometer
interventions (Model CLB 10 Classic, Caloi, São Paulo,
Brazil) consisting of a 10-min warm-up, 30 min of exer-
cise at target HR, and 10-min cool-down. The targeted
intensity was moderate (65–75% of maximum HR ac-
cording to the ACSM guidelines), determined by the HR
reserve.

Exercise group 2: resistance training group

Participants received a resistance training programme
comprised of 8 exercises; holds (crucifix) with free
weights, extension-machine exercises, rowing exercise
with an elastic band, knee flexion with ankle weights,
2-arm biceps curls, adduction exercises with an elas-
tic band, French curls, and abdominal exercises. The
training involved small and large muscle group exer-
cises. Participants performed 3 sets of 15 repetitions
with rest intervals of 1 min between sets. The targeted
intensity was moderate (65–75% of 1 repetition maxi-
mum according to the ACSM guidelines). To establish
the training intensity for each participant, their 1 rep-
etition maximum for each exercise was determined.
Training intensity changed over time as the partici-
pants progressed.

Taiwan 

Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity determined
by HRR 50–50%, according to the ACSM guidelines. HRR
= MHR − RHR. MHR determined using formula: MHR =
205 − (0.42 × age).

Time of exercise session: 30 min per session (3- to 5-
min warm-up session, 4 sets of combined exercise ses-
sion for approximately 30 min in total, and a final set
of 3- to 5-min of relaxation and stretching). Each set of
combined exercise lasting for 7 min 15 s, with a brief
break between sets. 

Type of exercise: aerobic exercise combined with
bodyweight or 500–620 mL of dumbbell water weights
for resistance training. Combined exercise sessions
consisted of various styles of basic exercises, alternat-
ing workouts of legs with trunk movement, and arm ex-
ercises.

Duration of exercise intervention: 12 weeks 

Progression: not reported

Equipment used: 500–620 mL of dumbbell water
weights

Provider: instructed by an
exercise physiologist/pro-
fessional exercise instruc-
tor on the performance of
aerobic exercise combined
with resistance training and
the skills of heart rate mea-
surement at rest and af-
ter exercise. The research
team member contacted
participants periodically
by telephone or text mes-
sage to ensure their compli-
ance. Each week, the partic-
ipants reported their max-
imal heart rate after each
exercise session by written
logs. 

Place of exercise: partici-
pant's home

unknown. 

Place of exercise: home-
based programme 

Individual or group: in-
dividual (taking into ac-
count participants were
performing their exercise
programme at home)

Intensity of exercise: moderate intensity. The initial
intensity of exercise was set at a moderate level and
the programme was reassessed, using a modified Borg
Scale (a tool to measure a persons' perception of their
effort and exertion, breathlessness, and fatigue during
physical work) to maintain the same intensity, in every
face-to-face session with the hand therapist at 0, 3, 6,
and 9 weeks. 

Time of exercise session: 30 min per session 

Type of exercise: upper limb resistance and range of
motion exercise (9 strengthening and stretching exer-
cises for the upper extremities with a stick, 10 strength-
ening and stretching exercises for the fingers and 11
strengthening exercises against resistance with thera-
peutic putty).

Duration of exercise intervention: 12 weeks (with a
follow-up assessment at 24 weeks)

Progression: not reported

Equipment used: therapeutic putty (soft or medium
resistance)

Intensity of exercise: heart rate corresponding to the
interval between ventilatory anaerobic threshold and
10% below respiratory compensation point.

Time of exercise session: 80 min per session (5-min
treadmill warm-up, 35–40 min of resistance training, 30
min of treadmill aerobic training, and 5-min of stretch-
ing).

Type of exercise: cardiovascular exercise (treadmill
walking for 30 min), and resistance training included 7
exercises for the main muscle groups (e.g. bench press,
leg press, leg extension). 

Duration of exercise intervention: 12 weeks 

Progression: participants were required to perform 4
sets of 8–12 repetitions maximum, except during the
first week, when a reduced volume of 2 sets of 15–20
repetitions maximum for each exercise was performed
(as an adaptation period to resistance training). Over-
load progression was implemented when the partici-
pant could perform > 12 repetitions on the last training
set for 2 consecutive workouts. Aerobic training inten-
sity was set at the corresponding heart rate between
the ventilatory anaerobic threshold and 10% below the
respiratory compensation point. Cardiorespiratory ex-
ercise test was performed on a treadmill (Centurion,
Model 200, Micromed) using a maximal-graded exercise
protocol. The recovery period was set at 2 min using
the initial workload (1.7 miles per hour).

SF-36 was used to
measure quality of life;
however, authors did
not report MCS score,
PCS score, and all 8 do-
mains, and, therefore,
this was not used in
our analyses.

SF-36 was
used to mea-

authors did
not report the
Pain domain,
and, there-
fore, this was

No withdrawals due to
adverse events were re-

We made the following changes from the protocol (Frade 2021).

We  clarified  the  definition  of  usual  care:  "Usual  pharmacological  care  could  include,  but  was  not  limited  to,  the  following
standard  pharmacological  drug  treatments;  antimalarials  such  as  hydroxychloroquine,  NSAIDs,  glucocorticoids  such  as  prednisone,
immunosuppressives such as mycophenolate, biologicals such as belimumab or rituximab. Other non-pharmacological measures may
also have included sun avoidance, commonly prescribed supplementation (i.e. vitamin D), and education about the disease or managing
comorbidities such as hypertension, for example (Fanouriakis 2019)".

We changed the preferred order of the data synthesis to reflect the hierarchy of the control group:

1. Exercise plus usual care versus placebo plus usual care
2. Exercise plus usual care versus usual care alone
3. Exercise plus usual care versus another non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. education about exercise, counselling about exercise,

relaxation exercises) plus usual care

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We changed the major outcome: 'withdrawals due to adverse events' to 'withdrawals due to any reason,' inclusive of any adverse events.
We removed withdrawals from the minor outcomes.

The review authors who screened the titles and abstracts, and full-text, has been changed to SF and EN. The third review author has been
changed to MC.

Extraction of study characteristics has been changed from one author (SF) to two authors (SF, EN) who will both spot-check for accuracy.

We clarified the definition of end time point of data extraction to be when the structured exercise intervention had completed (i.e. the
exercise intervention went for 12 weeks; however, participants were advised to continue to exercise and were followed up).

We did not do the following: in the 'Effects of interventions' results section and the 'What happens' column of the summary of findings
table, we provided the absolute percent change and the NNTB or NNTH (the NNTB or NNTH was provided only when the outcome shows
a clinically significant difference).
