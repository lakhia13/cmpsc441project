ABSTRACT

Background. There are over 506 children’s products containing one or more types of
additives. Maternal awareness of these additives is essential for the health of preschool-
aged children, as this period is vital for children’s growth and development. This study
aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and purchasing behaviors related to food
additives among mothers living in the western region of Saudi Arabia, as well as the
dietary patterns of preschool children.
Method. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey with a
convenience sample of 521 mothers of preschool-aged children (3–5 years old). The
survey gathered data on the child’s age, number of children, the youngest child’s weight
and height, food intolerance, tooth decay, as well as the dietary patterns of preschool
children. It also assessed the mother’s knowledge, attitude, and purchasing behaviors
related to food additives.
Results. The study found that 46.6% of mothers demonstrated good knowledge of
food additives, while 56.0% demonstrated fair attitudes and 78.5% good purchasing
behavior regarding additives. Additionally, the majority of mothers reported favorable
dietary patterns for their preschool-aged children. ‘‘Biscuits and crackers’’ had the
highest consumption frequency (4.98 ± 1.50), with 36.7% of children consuming
them once daily, while ‘‘Soft beverages’’ had the lowest consumption frequency (2.73 ±
2.04), with 46.6% of children never consuming them. Statistically significant differences
were identified between mothers’ knowledge and their age, education level, occupation
status, and economic status (p < 0.05). ANOVA results also indicated a statistically
significant difference between mothers’ attitudes and occupation status (p < 0.05).
Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations between mothers’ knowledge
of food additives and their attitudes (r = 0.293) and purchasing behaviors (r = 0.284)
related to additives.
Conclusion. The findings suggest that mothers possess a relatively good level of
knowledge of food additives and hold fair attitudes toward them, tending to result in
healthier purchasing behaviors and dietary practices for their preschool-aged children.
To increase awareness, nutrition intervention programs are required across various
socio-economic groups of mothers in the western region of Saudi Arabia. These
programs can significantly contribute to promoting healthier dietary practices for
preschool-aged children and improving overall family health and well-being.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, food additives have gained increasing importance in the food industry.
Food additives are defined as substances added to food to enhance or alter flavor, texture,
and appearance. Initially, the primary purpose of food additives was to extend shelf life,
enhance color, and add sweetness to products (Kang, Kim & Kim, 2021). Historically,
natural additives such as vinegar, salt, and lemon were commonly used. However, with
advancements in the food industry, artificial additives have largely replaced natural ones.
The standards, regulations, and usage of food additives are globally governed by the
Codex Alimentarius, a program of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert
Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), comprising experts from various countries,
determines regulations and standards related to food additives (Kraemer et al., 2022).
There are over 10,000 allowed chemical substances classified as food additives, including
sodium nitrite (E 401), monosodium glutamate (E 621), high fructose corn syrup (HFCS),
guar gum (E 412), trans fats, and artificial sweeteners (Chazelas et al., 2020). Globally, the
presence of ‘‘E numbers’’ or symbols on labels of food products indicates the inclusion
of additives. According to standards for labeling food additives set by the Saudi Food
and Drug Authority (SFDA), product labels must include all details regarding the name,
net contents, number of food additives (E number), side effects, and alcohol-free status
(Hussein, 2020).

In supermarkets, over 506 products are categorized as children’s, and this number
is expected to increase in the future. Additionally, each food product may contain one
or more types of additives (Lorenzoni, Oliveira & Cladera-Olivera, 2012). Childhood is a
critical period for growth and development, and the high consumption of products such
as candy, soft drinks, breakfast cereals, and jellies among preschool children can adversely
affect their health and growth, leading to conditions such as diabetes and obesity (Leal et
al., 2017; Gulliford, 2008). Additionally, some studies have shown a negative effect of food
additives on behavioral changes in preschool children, such as hyperactivity (McCann et
al., 2007). High intake of products with food additives has also been linked to dental caries
(Av, Adeloye & Ma, 2015).

Mothers play an important role in shaping their children’s food choices and dietary
habits, particularly during the preschool years. According to Kostecka (2014), preschool
children consume more processed foods containing food additives than adults. A
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study analyzed the association between
the intake of artificial food colorants and additives and behavioral issues in children,
including hyperactivity and attention deficit disorders. The study concluded that certain
food colorants might increase these conditions in susceptible children (McCann et al.,
2007). Several reviews have also indicated an association between various food additives and

long-term health effects in children, such as endocrine disruption, developmental delays,
increased susceptibility to chronic diseases, hyperactivity, allergic reactions, and metabolic
disturbances, raising particular concern over the cumulative effects of prolonged exposure
to these additives on overall health (Savin et al., 2022; Trasande, Shaffer & Sathyanarayana,
2018). Therefore, proper knowledge, attitudes, and purchasing behaviors regarding food
additives among mothers are critical to the health of children. When mothers are educated
about healthy food choices, their children are more likely to consume healthier food
options compared to children of mothers who lack this awareness. A systematic review of
the effects of culinary interventions on dietary intake and behavioral change indicated that
culinary interventions were associated with improved attitudes, self-efficacy, and dietary
intake in adults and children (Hasan et al., 2019).

There is a noticeable gap in the literature specifically focusing on the knowledge,
attitudes, and purchasing behaviors regarding food additives among mothers in the
western region of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the knowledge,
attitude, and purchasing behaviors related to food additives among mothers in this region,
as well as the dietary patterns of preschool children. The results of this study are expected to
assist policymakers in designing suitable, evidence-based policies regarding food additives
and establishing appropriate health education programs for mothers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Design and study population
This study employed a quantitative descriptive cross-sectional design, utilizing a non-
probability convenience sample of mothers with preschool children (aged 3–5 years) living
in the western region of Saudi Arabia. The western region of Saudi Arabia is characterized
by its diverse population, which may influence food consumption patterns and attitudes
toward food additives, thus providing a broad perspective on individual behaviors. The
sample size consisted of 385 respondents, with a margin of error of 5% and a confidence
level of 95%.

Procedure
Data were collected using an online survey, which was accessible from April 9, 2022, to
January 1, 2023. The survey was disseminated by the Deanship of Graduate Studies and
Scientific Research to the emails of students and faculties. Additionally, the survey was
distributed in 56 kindergarten centers across various cities in the western region of Saudi
Arabia. To reach a wider audience within the region, targeting different segments of the
population, the survey was also distributed through social communication platforms such
as WhatsApp, Telegram, and Twitter.

Electronic informed consent was obtained from participants prior to them filling out
the survey. The survey was reviewed to ensure the questions were suitable for evaluating
knowledge, attitudes, purchasing behaviors, and dietary patterns related to food additives.
Face validity testing was conducted with eight mothers, and content assessment was
conducted by six nutrition experts to ensure clarity and relevance of the survey.

The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of

Medicine, King Abdulaziz university with reference number (184-22).

Measurement
• Demographic characteristics: The survey included 12 questions covering demographic
information related to the mother’s age, education level, marital status, occupation,
economic status, city of residence, child’s age, number of children, and self-reported
weight and height.

• Mothers’ knowledge of food additives: This section included 10 questions assessing
mothers’ knowledge of food additives, developed based on a review of previously
published questionnaires in the scientific literature (Ibrahim et al., 2021; Moselhy et al.,
2016; Slavica & Radoslav, 2013). The total score ranged from 0 to 8 points, categorized
as good knowledge (8–6 points), fair knowledge (5–3 points), and poor knowledge (2–0
points).

• Mothers’ attitudes toward food additives: Eight questions were included to evaluate

mothers’ attitudes toward food additives in food products, developed based on a review
of previously published questionnaires in the scientific literature (Esfahani, Ziaei &
Esfandiari, 2021; Zugravu et al., 2017). The scoring ranged from 0 to 8 points, with
categories defined as good attitude (8–6 points), fair attitude (5–3 points), and poor
attitude (2–0 points).

• Mothers’ purchasing behavior: Mothers’ purchasing behavior was assessed using
eight questions, with scoring ranging from 0 to 8 points and categories defined as
good purchasing behavior (8–6 points), fair purchasing behavior (5–3 points), or poor
purchasing behavior (2–0 points). These questions were developed based on a review of
previously published questionnaires in the scientific literature (Ali et al., 2019; Esfahani,
Ziaei & Esfandiari, 2021; Slavica & Radoslav, 2013; Suparmi, Desanti & Cahyono, 2015).

• Dietary Patterns of Preschool Children: Preschool children’s eating behaviors were

assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), adopted from the study conducted
by Hamed, Ferer & Nofal (2021). The FFQ measured the frequency of consumption
of various food products containing food additives across different categories, such as
biscuits and crackers, chips, cake, cereals, flavored dairy products, chewing gums, canned
juices, soft drinks, candy, chocolate, ice cream, jelly, processed meat, sauces, and instant
noodles and soup. The frequency of consumption of each food was assessed across seven
categories: more than once per day, once per day, 4–5 times per week, 2–3 times per
week, once per week, once or less per month, and never.

Data analysis
All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for
Windows, Version 29. Descriptive analysis was employed to provide information on basic
characteristics of the data, including descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency,
and dispersion. Normality tests were conducted on all study variables, including mothers’
knowledge of food additives, attitudes toward food additives, purchasing behaviors, and
preschool children’s dietary patterns. A one-way ANOVA test was performed to compare

4/18

the total mean scores of mothers’ knowledge and attitudes toward food additives according
to demographic variables. Post-hoc multiple comparisons (Scheffé’s method) tests were
used for pairwise comparisons among age groups. Furthermore, the correlational method
was used to determine the relationship between the study variables. The level of statistical
significance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
Socio-demographic data
The initial total sample size was 521 participants. However, 51 responses were excluded
from the analysis due to participants residing outside the western region of Saudi Arabia,
such as in Riyadh, the eastern region, the northern region, or the southern region. Among
the remaining participants, the majority (94%) were married, 66.8% had at least one
preschool-aged child (3–5 years old), and 63.3% lived in the city of Jeddah. Additionally,
56.6% of the mothers held a bachelor’s degree, and 55.3% were housewives. In terms
of children’s ages, 42.6% of the mothers had a child aged 5 years, and 38.8% reported a
monthly income ranging from 8,000 to less than 15,000 Saudi Riyals (SR). The highest
proportion of participants, 25%, fell within the age range of 28 to 31 years, while the
lowest proportion, 7.5%, was in the age range of 18 to 22 years. Regarding children’s health
indicators, 64.2% of the children were underweight, 14.2% were obese, 16.2% suffered
from food allergies, and 28% had dental caries. There were 15 participants missing data for
weight and 94 missing data for height in the questionnaire responses.

Mothers’ knowledge of food additives
Regarding the mothers’ knowledge of food additives, 60.1% of participants had heard
about food additives. Among them, 52.1% reported having acquired information about
food additives from social media or the internet. Additionally, 68.1% of participants
knew that additives are substances added to processed food to improve flavor, color,
texture, and extend preservation. Similarly, 68.1% were aware that food additives include
preservatives, coloring agents, antioxidants, and emulsifiers. A majority of participants
(54.1%) believed that food factories adhere to specific global regulations regarding the
authorized proportions of food additives allowed in their products. Moreover, 66.6%
knew that food factories in Saudi Arabia have a clear list of food additives in their food
products. Nearly half of the participants (47.85%) were aware that the type of food additive
is written on the packaging and symbolized by the letter ‘‘E’’. Similarly, 41.5% knew that
the numbers following the letter ‘‘E’’ denote the type of food additive contained in the
product (e.g., ‘‘E129’’). Additionally, 66.8% knew that food additives in processed food
products are categorized into natural and synthetic additives. Lastly, 72.4% were aware that
excessive consumption of industrial food additives could lead to hyperactivity in children
and other serious illnesses. Overall, most mothers had either fair (32.6%, 4.21 ± 0.768) or
good knowledge (46.6%, 7.07 ± 0.836) of food additives.

Table 1 presents the total score for participants’ responses to the eight questions on

mothers’ knowledge of food additives.

The scoring of this section was 1 point was given for each correct response and 0 points were given to each incorrect answer. The scoring in the attitude section ranged from 0 to
8. The participants who have scoring points from 8 to 6 was reflected as good attitude, the scoring points from 5 to 3 had fair attitude and the score points from 2 to 0 had poor
attitude.

Mothers’ attitudes toward food additives
Regarding attitudes, 57% of mothers reported not allowing their children to consume
foods containing food additives. Additionally, 71.2% stated that they lacked sufficient
nutritional information to select suitable food products, including those with food additives.
Furthermore, 65.1% believed that foods containing artificial additives are more attractive
to consumers, while 66.4% were unaware that approved food additives in food products
in Saudi Arabia are considered safe for health. Most participants (54.1%) reported not
worrying about their children developing diseases after consuming foods with additives,
while 54.7% expressed no fear of their children developing allergies after consuming such
foods. Additionally, 52.6% of mothers were willing to pay more money for food without
additives. Finally, 90.2% believed that implementing awareness programs in the community
regarding food additives is crucial. Overall, most mothers had fair attitudes (56.0%) while
a smaller proportion had good (23.8%) attitudes toward food additives (Table 2).

Mothers’ purchasing behavior
Table 3 presents the mothers’ responses to questions regarding their purchasing behaviors.
The highest percentages were related to health considerations, with 91.7% (the highest)
of mothers expressing a preference for natural products for their children. In contrast,
the lowest percentage, 57.4%, relates to mothers who reported that their children could
not freely choose their food and drinks. These results show that most mothers (78.5%)
exhibited good purchasing behavior regarding food additives (7.03 ± 0.732) (Table 3).

The responses for these questions were ‘‘Always’’, ‘‘Sometime’’, ‘‘Rarely’’ and ‘‘Never.’’ If respondents answered, ‘‘Always or Sometimes’’, then they were classified as having a
positive purchasing behavior, and if the answer was ‘‘Rarely or Never’’, they were classified as having a negative purchasing behavior, depending on the questions. Furthermore,
1 point was given for each correct response and 0 points were given for each incorrect response. The scoring ranges from 0 to 8 points, with points between 8 to 6 points consid-
ered as having a good purchasing behavior, points from 5 to 3 points considered having fair purchasing behavior and from 2 to 0 considered having a poor purchasing behavior.

Dietary patterns of preschool children
Table 4 presents responses to the dietary patterns of preschool children. The overall mean
score was 3.95 ± 1.36 out of 7-point Likert scale. The highest mean score was 4.98 ± 1.50
for biscuits and crackers (including corn and wheat crackers and all kinds of biscuits), with
36.7% of children consuming them once daily. The lowest mean score was 2.73 ± 2.04 for
soft beverages (e.g., Pepsi, 7UP), with 46.6% of children reporting never consuming them.

Diﬀerences in mothers’ knowledge of food additives according to
demographic variables
The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between mothers’
knowledge and their age, education level, occupation status, and economic status (p < 0.05).
Marital status also showed a weak difference (p = 0.093) at the 0.10 level. Post-hoc multiple
comparisons (Scheffé’s method) tests reveal that the significant difference between the
mothers’ ages favored older mothers, indicating that knowledge of food additives increases
with age. Regarding education, the significant difference favored those with postgraduate
studies, who had the highest mean score of knowledge of food additives (5.72 ± 2.083).
Regarding occupation status, employed mothers had the highest mean score of knowledge
of food additives (5.44 ± 2.371). Regarding income, mothers with 8,000 SR or more had
a mean score greater than 5 out of 8 degrees, higher than for low-income mothers. No
significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in mothers’ knowledge of food additives for
the other demographic variables (Table 5).

Diﬀerences in mothers’ attitudes toward food additives according to
demographic variables
Table 6 presents the ANOVA results for differences in mothers’ attitudes toward food
additives according to demographic variables. A statistically significant difference was
observed between occupation status groups (p < 0.05). Post-hoc multiple comparisons
(Scheffé’s method) results show a significant difference between employee mothers and
both housewives and students in favor of employee mothers, namely indicating that the
higher the mother’s career status, the more positive her attitudes toward food additives.
No significant difference was found (p > 0.05) in mothers’ attitudes toward food additives
according to the other demographic variables.

Relation between food additives related knowledge, attitude, and
willingness to buy food additives among mothers in the western
region of Saudi Arabia
There was a significant positive relationship between mothers’ knowledge of food additives
and both attitudes and purchasing behaviors, with correlation coefficients of r = 0.293 and
r = 0.284, respectively (Table 7). This suggests that greater knowledge about food additives
was associated with more positive attitudes and purchasing behaviors. Conversely, a
significant negative relationship was observed between the dietary patterns of preschool
children and both knowledge and attitudes, with correlation coefficients of r = −0.100 and

toward food additives were associated with a lower likelihood of unhealthy dietary patterns
in preschool children.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to assess Saudi mothers’ knowledge, attitudes, and purchasing behaviors
regarding food additives, along with the dietary patterns of preschool children. The findings
indicate that mothers exhibited a relatively good level of knowledge, fair attitudes, positive
purchasing behaviors, as well as favorable dietary patterns for their preschool children.
These outcomes were found to be influenced by various demographic characteristics.
Mothers aged between 28 and 31, employed mothers, and those with higher incomes
(above 25,000 SR per month) displayed significantly greater knowledge. These results
differ from a study conducted in Egypt, where most mothers exhibited poor knowledge
about food additives, although educated mothers with higher socio-economic status
demonstrated better understanding about food additives (Hamed, Ferer & Nofal, 2021).
It is worth noting that younger and more educated mothers were often more

knowledgeable about trends in the food industry. They were more attentive to reading the
recommendations in the nutrition field and understanding the potential impact of food
additives on their child’s health. Moreover, educated mothers are skilled at making the
right decisions when selecting healthy food choices and can distinguish the ingredients
of various food products. Additionally, they might be more proficient in seeking out
reliable information and understanding complex nutritional information (Zugravu, 2012).

Almoabadi and Hanbazaza (2024), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.18223

11/18

Research has shown that employed mothers with higher financial capabilities may also have
the opportunity to attend scientific classes or conferences related to the food industry and
food additives, increasing their knowledge and benefitting their preschool-aged children
(Ravikumar et al., 2022).

The results suggest that occupation status significantly impacts attitudes toward food
additives. Employee mothers tend to have good attitudes toward food additives, whereas
housewives, businesswomen, and students often exhibit poor or fair attitudes, possessing
only basic information about additives without going into details. This could be explained
by the fact that working mothers may gain experience and exchange new information
with peers in their jobs (Nsiah-Asamoah, Pereko & Intiful, 2019). In contrast, a study
conducted in Oman found that non-working Omani mothers have a positive attitude
toward healthy dietary intake for their children, spending more time at home, caring for
their children, and being able to prepare traditional meals, thereby avoiding processed
foods (Al-Shookri et al., 2011). Conversely, the stress experienced by mothers working
full-time jobs may result in a negative attitude toward maintaining a healthy food pattern
for their children compared to mothers without jobs or with part-time jobs. Long work
hours may prevent mothers from seeking updates and information about food technology
for their children’s nutrition (Ergün & Bozdemir, 2023). Previous multicenter studies in
European countries such as Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain,
and Sweden have shown that a higher educational level of parents is associated with a
clearer attitude toward food additives for their children (Jilani et al., 2018). Additionally,
according to Hamed, Ferer & Nofal (2021), positive attitudes among mothers have been
linked to a higher socio-economic status. This could be explained by the fact that employed
mothers may have higher purchasing power, which could affect their buying choices. In
addition, they might be more willing to purchase products with additives if they perceive
these products as offering better quality or if they believe that the additives are safe and
beneficial. The difference between studies could be explained by variations in geographical
location, dietary habits, perceptions, and social and cultural backgrounds.

Furthermore, some countries have placed a strong emphasis on implementing nutrition

intervention programs specifically targeting mothers. This focus has contributed to an
increased clear attitude toward child products containing processed additives. According
to Setia et al. (2020), there was an increase in positive attitudes toward healthy food choices
and behaviors among mothers after a two-month nutrition intervention program. A clear
attitude among mothers about nutritional information impacts all family members, not
just the child, and can lead to changes in eating behaviors toward a healthier lifestyle.

The findings of this study indicate that the majority of mothers exhibited positive
purchasing behavior by avoiding food additive products for their preschool children,
remaining unaffected by their children’s unhealthy requests. These findings align with
a previous study conducted in Italy, where mothers refrained from purchasing products
containing artificial colors and sweeteners for their children (Baldassarre, Campo & Falcone,
2016). However, contrasting findings regarding mothers’ purchasing behavior emerged in
a study by Monalisa (2020), which indicated that preschool children could influence their
mothers’ decision-making to purchase products with low nutrient content. This disparity

Almoabadi and Hanbazaza (2024), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.18223

12/18

in results could be explained by variations in mothers’ levels of education. Mothers with
higher levels of education tend to make healthier decisions when purchasing healthy
products and are more aware of the potential side effects of food additive products. Studies
have shown that when consumers understand food labeling regulations, such as those
related to nutritional information or food safety warnings, they are more likely to use this
information to guide their purchasing decisions and select products that align with their
health and safety preferences (Grunert & Wills, 2007; Drichoutis, Lazaridis & Nayga, 2006).
Moreover, mothers with strong emotional connections to their children tend to purchase
any food products to satisfy their children’s desires and ensure their happiness (Estay,
Kurzer & Guinard, 2021).

Additionally, the attractive packaging of children’s products containing food additives

not only directly influences children’s food preferences but also increases the pressure
on mothers during purchasing decisions to satisfy their children’s food requests (Walsh,
Meagher-Stewart & Macdonald, 2015). A study conducted in the United States found that
packaging featuring vibrant colors and attractive images significantly influences parents,
particularly mothers, in their decision to purchase food additive products for preschool
children aged 2 to 5 years, rather than considering taste or health benefits (Prible, 2017).
Food additive products are also widely popular and readily available in both small and
large markets, including urban and rural grocery shops. Furthermore, these products are
inexpensive, have a longer shelf life, are often ready to eat, and require minimal preparation
time (Kraemer et al., 2022).

In the present study, mothers reported the daily frequency of their preschool children’s
consumption of food additives products, which included biscuits, crackers, potato chips,
cakes, breakfast cereals, fortified dairy products, juices, and chocolate. A previous study
conducted in Egypt revealed that among preschool children, the products most frequently
consumed were fries, biscuits, lollipops, cake, and chocolate (Hamed, Ferer & Nofal, 2021).
Similarly, a study conducted in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia among preschool children
aged between 1 and 5 indicated that they consumed certain food daily, including pizza,
burgers, chocolate or dessert, butter-mayonnaise, soft drinks, juices, chips, and biscuits
(Darwish et al., 2014). Regular consumption of these types of foods not only increases the
intake of food additives but also raises the risk of developing food allergies and dental
caries due to the high sugar content and potential allergens commonly found in these
products. The current findings related to food allergies and dental caries suggest that
dietary recommendations should consider these health conditions, guiding parents in
making informed choices that address both nutritional needs and health concerns.

Implementing a combination of interventions, policy changes, and educational
programs, such as workshops and online resources that provide parents with knowledge
about healthy eating and the impact of food additives on health, can empower parents
to make better-informed choices for their children. These efforts could improve dietary
patterns among preschool children, foster healthier eating habits, and support overall
well-being in this age group. Additionally, policies that restrict the marketing of unhealthy
foods to young children could reduce their exposure to high-sugar and high-fat products.
Furthermore, enhancing food labeling requirements to provide clear and comprehensive

Almoabadi and Hanbazaza (2024), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.18223

13/18

information about additives, sugar content, and nutritional value can further assist parents
in making more informed food choices for their children.

To our knowledge, this study is among the first few studies in the Middle East aimed at
assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and purchasing behaviors of Saudi mothers regarding
food additives, as well as the dietary patterns of preschool children. However, the study
has certain limitations. First, being an observational study, it cannot establish causality.
Additionally, the use of a self-reported questionnaire introduces the potential for response
bias. Furthermore, relying on convenience sampling as a method of data collection limits
the generalizability of the findings to the general population of Saudi Arabia.

CONCLUSIONS

The findings revealed that mothers in the western region of Saudi Arabia had a relatively
good level of knowledge and fair attitudes regarding food additives. Consequently, they
tended to engage in better purchasing behaviors and adopt healthier dietary patterns for
their preschool children.

These mothers demonstrated a preference to prioritize fresh, unprocessed foods and
made informed choices that minimized the consumption of products containing artificial
additives. Their heightened knowledge and understanding of the potential health risks
associated with additives enabled them to make conscious decisions concerning their
children’s food preferences.

The study identified a close association between a mother’s awareness and certain
demographic factors such as age, occupation, and high income levels. Younger mothers
and those with higher levels of education had greater access to reliable information sources,
including healthcare professionals and credible sources, making them more aware of both
the presence and potential effects of food additives. This highlights the importance of
implementing educational interventions and providing accessible information to empower
mothers to make informed dietary choices for their children. Furthermore, a higher income
level was observed to contribute to the adoption of healthy dietary practices. Despite the
higher costs, these mothers were inclined to purchase products with high nutritional value,
reflecting the importance they placed on their children’s health.

Collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and food industry stakeholders is vital.

Such collaboration could raise public awareness across different segments of society by
developing evidence-based food labeling guidelines, implementing nutritional intervention,
reducing the use of harmful additives, and promoting the availability of nutritious and
additive-free products. These efforts could significantly enhance parents’ awareness,
attitudes, and purchasing behaviors regarding food additives. Future longitudinal studies
are recommended to track changes in knowledge, attitudes, and dietary behaviors related
to food additives. This approach could help establish causal relationships and provide a
better understanding of the long-term effects of dietary patterns on health outcomes.
