Objective: Social
isolation and loneliness (SI/L) are considered critical public
health issues. The primary objective of this scoping review is to document the
experience of SI/L among older adults in Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic,
given research gaps in this area. We identiﬁed the reasons for SI/L, the effects
of SI/L, SI/L coping strategies, and research and policy gaps in SI/L experiences
among older adults in Africa during COVID-19.

Methods: Six databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Web of
Science, and Ageline) were used to identify studies reporting the experiences of
SI/L among older adults in Africa during the COVID-19 lockdown. We adopted the
Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-
ScR).

Results: Social
isolation and loneliness due to COVID-19 in Africa affected
older adults’ mental, communal, spiritual, ﬁnancial, and physical health. The
use of technology was vital, as was the role of social networks within the
family, community, religious groups, and government. Methodological challenges
include the risk of selective survival bias, sampling biases, and limited inductive
value due to context. Also, lack of large-scale mixed methods longitudinal studies
to capture the experiences of older adults during COVID-19. There were essential
policy gaps for African mental health support services, media programs, and
community care service integration targeting older adults in the era of the
COVID-19 lockdown.

Like in other countries, COVID-19 lockdown policies and the
Discussion:
lockdown restrictions primarily caused the experience of SI/L among older adults
in Africa. In African countries, they resulted in a severance of older adults from the
cultural structure of care for older adults and their familial support systems. Weak
government intervention, personal situations, challenges regarding technology,
and detachment from daily activities, disproportionately affected older adults
in Africa.

Introduction

Globally, COVID-19 accounted for a disproportionate number
of deaths among older adults, and in Africa, 50% of COVID-
19 deaths occurred among older adults aged 60 and over (1).
Consequently, the outbreak of COVID-19 and the restrictions
imposed to contain the spread of the disease created unanticipated
disruption to social life, leading to myriad physical, social, and
mental health challenges. These disruptions signiﬁcantly aﬀected
older adults, since the disease risk was higher, resulting in
more stringent behavioral adjustments. In addition, since social
and physical distancing was not commonplace in Africa’s more
communitarian social environment (i.e., more multigenerational
households), the requirements for COVID-19 control were sudden
and diﬀerent than in many other countries (2). Additionally, the
conditions impacted life diﬀerently, especially according to urban,
rural milieux, and kinship structures. Older adults in Africa may
also have been more vulnerable to social isolation and loneliness
(SI/L) due to their family-based approach to care and living
arrangements [e.g., (3, 4)].

Research indicates that SI/L are related but distinct concepts. SI
refers to reductions in the quantity and quality of social interaction
and network of support. In contrast, loneliness is a mental state
that occurs due to the lack of quality social connections necessary
to meet the social needs of a person (5). Ideally, to stay socially
connected and receive adequate support, older adults need to
be embedded in supportive social networks. However, in Africa,
geriatric care relies heavily on kinship systems (3, 6). At the same
time, formal service approaches tend to be weak or non-existent
because of a lack of funding and political will (7).

SI/L are considered critical public health issues often associated
with poor physical and mental health,
lower psychological
wellbeing, and mortality (8–12). Speciﬁcally, SI/L accounts for
a signiﬁcant risk of depression (50%) and anxiety (47%) across
studies in diﬀerent countries (13). In addition, SI/L are associated
with an increased risk of physical health problems such as frailty
and chronic conditions (14, 15), and about 30% risk of heart disease
and stroke (16). In Africa, these associations have not been closely
examined due to paucity of quantitative research on the experiences
of older adults.

However, SI/L became a focal public health challenge during
the pandemic in many countries, with the rate of loneliness
ranging from 20 to 40% in China, Europe, Latin America, Canada,
the US, and Africa (17–19). Moreover, the rate of SI/L varies
across social settings, and it is higher in social contexts where
people feel socially disconnected—such as in residential care (20).
Thus, in the African context, the cultural approach to care, a
sense of community, kinship and living arrangements, and the
African notion of shared ties, are signiﬁcant factors for lower
levels of SI/L in these community contexts (21). Unfortunately,
these ties were tested during the pandemic because the cultural
approach to care requires face-to-face interactions. Thus, the
inability of older adults to receive adequate physical, emotional,
and material support
from families and friends during the
pandemic was a signiﬁcant cause of strain on their social and
mental health (22). During the pandemic,
in many countries
with more developed infrastructures, the use of technology, such

as phone and other low-tech communicative devices, have been
shown to be beneﬁcial in reducing SI/L and supporting some
older adults to stay socially connected (23, 24). The uptake of
information and communication technology appeared to increase
among older adults in some countries, but particularly in places
where there was technology uptake prior to the pandemic
(24, 25). However, the extent to which telephone reduced SI/L
among older adults in Africa is unclear because few studies
have explored this area. In addition, there is a “gray” digital
divide between rural and urban settings, and materially deprived
environments, making research contexts unique (14, 22). For
instance, digital infrastructure such as connectivity, cost of data
and devices, and access to energy supply in most parts of Africa
contribute to a digital divide (26). Furthermore, the weakness
of resources that the government provides, including pensions,
palliative care, health care, and community supports, may have
weakened system-level resilience (27) in Africa. Yet, there appeared
to be some successful approaches, such as religious groups
that fostered social connection and support by organizing small
groups to meet on a face-to-face rather than large congregation
basis and to provide food to older adults who were lacking
(28, 29).

Overall, among the 54 African countries, there is limited
empirical evidence that comprehensively explores the experience
of SI/L among older adults, in particular, during the pandemic.
Therefore, the primary objective of this scoping review is to
document the experience of SI/L among older adults in Africa
during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are
to: (1) identify the reasons for SI/L among older adults in Africa
due to COVID-19 restrictions, (2) highlight the eﬀects of SI/L
among older adults during COVID-19 restrictions, (3) describe
the SI/L coping strategies, including social support adopted during
the COVID-19 restrictions, (4) discuss the research and policy
gaps of SI/L experiences among older adults in Africa in the era
of COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review of studies reporting the
experiences of SI/L among older adults in Africa during the
the Joanna Briggs Institute
COVID-19 lockdown. We adopt
(JBI) (30) methodology and the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) (31).

Search strategy

We searched six databases for research articles exploring how
older adults coped with SI/L during the COVID-19 restrictions
in Africa. The focus was on empirical research articles because
they provide evidence from older adults’ experiences of SI/L
during the pandemic. We searched PubMed (2020—to week 4
of May 2022); Scopus (2020—week 4 of May 2022); CINAHL
Complete (2020—week 4 of June 2022); APA PsycINFO (2020—
week 2 of July 2022); Web of Science (2020—week 4 of July

2022); Ageline (2020—week 4 of July 2022). We used operators
and took cognizance of MeSH (Medical subject heading) terms and
their associated approaches. There were variations across the broad
terms—“Africa” AND older AND adults OR aged OR elderly OR
seniors AND social AND isolation OR loneliness AND covid-19
OR coronavirus OR 2019-ncov OR SARS-CoV-2 OR cov-19 (see
Appendix 1).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were selected based on the following inclusion criteria:
(1) The article focuses on Africa, (2) Written in the English
Language, (3) It speciﬁcally focuses on exploring the experiences
of SI/L among older adults, (4) Was conducted in Africa, among
African older adults who are 50+, and we considered this lower
age cap due to the life expectancy at birth of African older
adults. We also considered the fact that the higher age cap (60+)
leads to the exclusion of older adults from surveys (1), (5) Is
based on empirical data, and (6) Was focused on the COVID-
19 pandemic. Studies were excluded if they did not ﬁt these
inclusion criteria.

We initially retrieved a total of 5019 articles from PubMed
(253), Scopus (993), CINAHL (795), APA PsycINFO (721), Web of
Science (2095), and Ageline (162). After de-duplication, there were
3011 articles exported to Covidence, an online systematic review
management platform. Through the hand-searching of Google
Scholar and chaining other references, 37 more articles were found.
A rapid review of titles was conducted in Covidence, with 2,131
titles were excluded because they did not speciﬁcally address social
isolation or were not focused on COVID-19. Also, at the stage of
reviewing abstracts, 892 abstracts were excluded because they did
not focus on older adults, or concentrated on mixed populations,
or were not focused on Africa. Therefore, the 25 titles had their full
text downloaded, and 15 more were found ineligible because they
were not empirical or were focused on other mental health issues,
not SI/L. In conclusion (see Figure 1), 10 articles were deemed to
be of high quality for review and exported to NVivo 12, a textual
analysis software for content-based analysis.

Data extraction

We adopted the JBI template for determining the quality
of article, extracting details, characteristics, and results, together
with the output of textual data coding on NVivo. This approach
enhanced the robustness of the analysis and gave context to
the presentation of data and discussions. With the JBI template,
extracted ideas included—Author names, the title of the article,
year of publication, country of publication, study Area, setting
(rural or urban), research tradition, study design, research
instrument, the unit of analysis, recruitment strategy, sample size,
living arrangement of the study participants, age, gender, marital
status, and education. Additionally, study objectives/research
questions and research ﬁndings were curated. Finally, the JBI
in assessing the quality
critical appraisal tool was also useful

(trustworthiness, relevance, and results) of the articles in an
iterative process, from the rapid review of titles and abstracts to the
ﬁnal inclusion of the reviewed studies.

Furthermore, through the content analysis on NVivo 12,
precisely 12 codes were generated through a deductive analysis
process during the rapid review of the titles and abstract through
discussions by AIA, AVW and JP, and ﬁve sub-codes were
developed through an inductive process by AIA and AVW (see
Table 1). We ensured the rigor of the data analysis process through
researcher triangulation (32, 33) by comparing the perspectives
of each researcher regarding the interpretation of the ﬁndings.
Also, through a process of refutational analysis, we sought both
convergence and divergence in the data (34), so that the report
provided comparative insight into the experiences of SI/L in Africa.
This approach provided insights into the context of SI/L among
older adults in African communities.

Ten articles published between 2020 and 2022 were included
in this review, and all articles focus on SI/L among older adults
in the COVID-19 era. Six articles were published in Dovie (35),
Jemal et al. (36), Morgan et al. (37), Ekoh et al. (22), Asante
et al. (26), Ekoh (38). Also, three articles were published in
Manyaapelo et al. (29), Ekoh et al. (28), Giebel et al. (14), and one
was published in Ekoh et al. (39). Four of the included articles
were focused on the social isolation experiences of older adults
in Nigeria (22, 28, 38, 39), three were from Ghana (26, 35, 37),
one each from South Africa (29), Ethiopia (36), and Uganda (14).
The four Nigerian articles (22, 28, 38, 39) have the same ﬁrst
author, are results of diﬀerent small studies conducted in the
same communities (Ihe and Umudioka) and two anonymized care
homes in Enugu and Anambra States, Nigeria. Furthermore, ﬁve
studies were conducted in Urban and Peri-Urban settings (26, 29,
35–37).

Research design of included studies

As shown in Table 3, all of the studies utilized a cross-
sectional design and there are two quantitative studies (36,
37) and the remaining eight articles were based on qualitative
studies. Among the qualitative articles, three studies adopted
the phenomenological method (26, 28, 35), four studies used
in-depth interview guides (26, 28, 29, 39), while one study
(38) involved a mix of older adults and caregivers as research
participants, and the remaining studies focusing solely on older

adults. The studies were all community-based, and two studies

phone interviews.

Characteristics of the research participants

Across all the included articles, information on Table 4 shows,
there were 961 research participants, and the sample sizes ranged
from 11 participants (22, 39) to 423 participants (36) across
the studies. The minimum age of research participants was age
50 (37) and the maximum was 88 years (29). The majority
(57%) of the participants are female and most (47%) older adults
were not married. More than half (51%) of the older adults
have acquired formal education and some (37%) older adults
are retirees. Regarding living arrangements, research participants
predominantly live within multigenerational households, spouses,
or caregivers. However, three studies from Nigeria observed an
emerging pattern of living alone or in residential care (28, 38, 39)
and one from South Africa (29).

Several articles identiﬁed immediate and indirect reasons for
the experience of social isolation among older African adults. The
primary cause of social isolation among older African adults were
the restrictive COVID-19 public health guidelines to protect older
adults, travel restrictions, a ban on gatherings, and physical/social
distance. Older adults were at high risk of infection and death due
to COVID-19, such that family and social networks of support were
careful not to visit (36, 39). Thus, the need to keep a social distance
was a signiﬁcant reason for social isolation in the research reviewed
(14, 29, 35, 36, 39). In addition, the restriction on vehicular
movement across locations, primarily between urban and rural
destinations (22, 29) made it diﬃcult for potential informal sources
of social support to return home and connect physically with
older adults. This disconnect was more acute among older adults
who lived alone (28). Also, the ban on gatherings (22, 26, 28, 29)
impeded the social connections that older adults would have with
the large community.

Technology use

An indirect cause of social

isolation was the economic
downturn, which caused ﬁnancial pressures due to job/livelihood
loss and unaﬀordable transportation costs (22, 28, 29). In addition,
the economic downturn made it diﬃcult for adult children and
other sources of support to visit their parents and send them
gifts, being part of the cultural expectations from adult children in
African settings.

Loneliness facilitators among older adults
in Africa

The environmental and emotional triggers of loneliness among
older adults primarily resulted from the social
isolation they
experienced. Similar to social isolation, the environmental triggers
of loneliness among older adults in Africa included the metaphor
of “staying away to protect older adults from the high risk of
infection and mortality” (22, 26). Also, during economic downturn,
the ban on vehicular movement, and sociocultural activities caused
job/livelihood loss and a high cost of
transportation, which
contributed to feelings of disconnection. These factors also led to
the inability of relevant social networks to organize socials, visit,
send gifts, and provide money, creating a feeling of loneliness (29).
In addition, a peculiar feeling of loneliness occurred among older

adults who lived within a family structure. This form of loneliness
was observed among participants who had a family trauma, such
as the death of a child or spouse or divorce/separation (26, 29).
The feeling of loneliness was mostly expressed by male older adults
who do not share common social activity interests with members
of their household (26). Loneliness occurred when children and
wives had an interest in television or phones when the male older
adult enjoyed a game like “Oware (a popular game in Ghana)” with
friends and associates.

Effects of social isolation and loneliness
among older adults in Africa

Social isolation and loneliness due to COVID-19 in Africa
aﬀected older adults’ mental, communal, spiritual, ﬁnancial, and
isolation and loneliness among older
physical health. Social
adults in Africa were associated with depression among older
adults (36). Consequently, lonely older adults reported a decline
in cognitive capacities because their minds were not socially
stimulated, potentially increasing the risk of cognitive impairments
like dementia (14). Also, the experience of social isolation and
loneliness tested Africa’s cultural philosophy of interconnectedness,
togetherness, and relationships within communities (29).
In
addition, older adults’ spirituality was aﬀected by social isolation
due to a lack of congregation, especially if they were religious
adherents before the lockdown (35). The economic eﬀect of social
isolation was that some older adults could not visit their plots of
land to garden and grow vegetables as a means of subsistence (14).
In similar situations, older adults could not access support with
household chores and farming activities (39). As a result of the
disconnection from ﬁnancial activities, there was also a decline in
physical activities. Besides, older adults with multiple morbidities
and physical disabilities were at risk of health complications and
death (38). Furthermore, those who were frail before COVID-19
became frailer because they could not perform regular physical
activities (14).

Coping with social isolation and loneliness
among older adults in Africa

Several articles documented ways older adults coped with social
isolation and loneliness associated with the COVID-19 restrictions.
The use of technology was vital, as was the role of social networks
within the family, community, religious groups, and government.

Technology adoption

Technology helped some older adults in Africa to cope with
isolation, such as platforms including WhatsApp and telephone
calls (35), and Facebook and Twitter for social contact and
information (29). Also, television and radio help stay in touch
with the outside world through news and other programs (22).
In addition, older adults played video videogames on the Internet
and engaged in video calls to overcome boredom (35). Conversely,
regardless of these beneﬁts, many barriers were identiﬁed in the

review. For example, some older African adults did not feel that the
beneﬁts of technology were adequate, noting that technology could
not replace the value of face-to-face interactions (26). Signiﬁcantly,
the digital divide problem aﬀected older adults due to the lack
of access to the Internet, digital skills, and negative disposition
toward technology. Other problem areas were the cost of devices,
the quality of the infrastructure, and personal opinions about
technology (22).

Moreover, many older adults in Africa did not consider using
technology as eﬀective in reducing their loneliness. Instead, they
cited reasons such as being used to living without phones and that
phones do not provide any social engagement (22). In another case,
older adults expressed concerns about the lack of infrastructure
for smartphones, including electricity and Internet access (14). For
instance, the weak infrastructure in rural areas aﬀected the quality
or duration of telephone communication (22, 29).

Role of religious groups

Research also indicates that many older adults could cope
with the social isolation and loneliness linked to the COVID-
19 pandemic by leveraging social connections through family
members, religious groups, and the government to support their
physical and emotional needs.

Familial and community support

For older adults who lived within family structures and
communities, schoolchildren were available at home because
schools were shut down, and they provided social support and
engagement to older adults (35). Also, adult children were available
to provide support, although some had lost their livelihoods.
Regardless of the economic burden of supporting adult children’s
daily needs, Manyaapelo and colleagues emphasized that older
adults valued the sense of family and community. This reduced
the potential stress and pressure of the COVID-19 period (29). In
cases where the older adult lived alone, adult children who sent
ﬁnancial or material support or gifts provided older adults with a
sense of social connection (29). In other cases, some older adults
relied on the support of their extended family members, such as
uncles, nieces, and nephews, to help them maintain a livelihood.
The extended family members provided the support because that
was the role expected of them in the local culture (29).

On the other hand, the family as social support did not work
well for some older adults who experienced family trauma and
conﬂict. Familial support was not forthcoming when there was a
sick adult child, divorce/separation, death of an adult child, or adult
children abandoning their parents (29).

Several articles also identiﬁed religious groups as a source of
support by visiting older adults in the communities, and making
food available to people living in the community (22, 29). After the
initial eﬀect of the lockdown, religious groups developed innovative
ways to address the need for staying connected with members.
They also set up smaller groups to meet up with older adults in
their homes and at the community level. Thus, even when the
gathering in the church was impossible, older adults living within
the communities were reached by religious organizations (28).

Government support

The support from the government varied considerably across
countries. In the included articles, the provision from governments
in South Africa and Nigeria were identiﬁed as more supportive.
In South Africa, apart from the Pension scheme, the government
provided a Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress to people
considered qualiﬁed to access this support (29). South Africa has a
well-structured system of providing social support to older citizens
and this was utilized during the outbreak. Similarly in Nigeria,
there exists a pension scheme with limited coverage for older
adults. In addition, the government set up a COVID-19 Palliative
Care System through the direct distribution of food. However,
there is evidence that the food was not equally distributed (39),
mainly because rural areas are usually disproportionately excluded
from social services and support. In Ghana, the Social Security
and National Insurance Trust was not functioning appropriately,
hence there were prolonged delays in payment. This situation was
aggravated during COVID-19 and older adults could barely get one
payment in 5 months (26).

Research gaps

The 10 studies in this review reveal methodological challenges
such as the risk of selective survival bias, sampling biases, and
limited inductive value due to context. The risk of selection bias
in the study occurred because the sampling was conducted online,
and there was a tendency to exclude older adults who were not
literate or could not use the computer (37). Also, the potential
for sampling bias exists, primarily due to the limited number of
study sites (36) and the exclusion of older adults without mobile
phones (29).

A signiﬁcant research gap in African social

isolation and
large-scale quantitative and
loneliness studies is the lack of
longitudinal studies (14) to capture the experiences of older
adults during COVID-19. Topical research interests include the
unmet social and functional needs (39), mental health, the digital
divide (14, 28, 35), the eﬀect of social networks (26, 35), and
the rural-urban dichotomy of SI/L (14). In particular, there is a
need to support research to explore diversity across all African
countries, and this could be fostered through the development of

comprehensive, collaborative research networks. There is also a
need for evaluation research to assess the eﬃcacy and eﬀectiveness
of various programs and services to improve social connectedness
among older African adults living in diverse settings.

Policy gaps

The reviewed articles highlighted important policy gaps for
African mental health support services, media programs, and
community care service integration targeting older adults. It
was clear that mental health care is ﬂoundering in Africa. The
psychological distress among older adults at the height of the
pandemic and the inability to access help constituted high risk
and lower adaptation (37). Some research suggests the need to
have mental health hotlines that will provide virtual menta health
services (22). Also, regarding media programing, older adults in the
reviewed studies interacted with TV and radio as means of staying
connected when they are unable or unwilling to use digital devices.
Radio and TV programming should present older adults in Africa

Adedeji et al.

with age-friendly programs that will keep them engaged (22, 28).
Additionally, because the pandemic has tested the capacity of
Africa’s informal support structures, the government must integrate
caregivers and social workers into a care network at the community
level (28, 39). Another approach to integrating services at the
community level is a partnership and providing grants to residential
care facilities as an emergent support structure.

Discussion

COVID-19 restrictions were similar across countries, and in
Africa, the experience of SI/L was acute because of the disconnect
of kinship-based care and support (3, 4) and the lack of African
governments’ commitment to providing social support to older
adults (1). Countries with more developed welfare programs did
not rely as heavily on kinship networks. Therefore, regardless of the
beneﬁts of African social organization based on a common bond
and communalism, these were unsustainable during the COVID-
19 pandemic lockdowns. Comparatively, because welfare states
have protective characteristics that address SI/L (40, 41), they fared
better than the African countries lacking system-level strengths.

Thus, a challenge of

the African kinship-based support
structure is that it triggers a feeling of isolation when disconnected.
Isolation occurs because the kinship approach creates a sense of
expectation (41) due to the norm of reciprocity between parents
and children (42). Therefore, the experience during COVID-19
conﬁrmed the assertion that older adults in individualistic social
settings experience a lesser sense of loneliness than in collectivist
societies (43). Yet, regardless of society type, the physical and
mental health eﬀects of SI/L (12) include frailty, early dementia
onset (14), psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and anxiety),
and severe cognitive impairments (13). Similarly, loneliness can
exacerbate physical conditions like obesity and cardiovascular
diseases (16, 19).

During the pandemic, technology adoption was a key tool
in addressing SI/L in many countries globally (24, 44). In
African literature, the smartphone was the common technology,
followed by television and radio. However, the telephone was
more beneﬁcial because it assisted older adults in speaking with
family members through video and voice calls (22), considering
that such technologies had been in use among older adults
before the pandemic. Unfortunately, there is currently no data
in Africa that compares the rate of technology adoption among
older adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
it is easy to infer that the rate of technology was low due
to contextual considerations. For example, older adults were
unwilling to acquire digital skills, experienced digital infrastructure
barriers, and thought smartphones did not provide as many social
connections as they desired (22, 26, 45). Comparatively, in the era
of COVID-19, the technology adoption rate increased in a place
like Canada, albeit similar problems occurred but at lower rates
[e.g., (24, 46)]. So, there was a consensus in the research about the
lack (though in various degrees) of digital infrastructure, cost of
devices, and Internet coverage in African and western countries.
These claims are valid, and the barriers to technology speciﬁcally
suited to the needs of older adults must be addressed to promote

higher social connectedness in future outbreaks. The challenges
of digital skills and infrastructure can be addressed by engaging
the private sector and encouraging the development of frugal
innovation because frugal innovation promotes less engineering
complexity and low cost of production and maintenance. So, frugal
innovation will ensure that the technologies for Africa are designed
and developed based on the infrastructural realities and interests of
Africa and Africans.

In sum, the available social support during the pandemic was
family, community, religious groups, and government support.
These same support areas have been documented in studies
conducted outside Africa (5, 47). Regardless of the entrenched
communalism and common-bond ideologies in Africa, non-
African literature captured how support was made available to
older adults during the pandemic. The role of government was
eﬀective outside of Africa because those countries had well-
developed welfare regimes that catered to the needs of older
adults (40). Neither the Pension scheme nor COVID-19 palliative
measures were eﬀective in most African countries because the
database infrastructure was ineﬃcient. An additional problem
was the historical rural-urban divide regarding the imbalances
in the spread of infrastructure (14, 22, 29). By implication, the
systemic weaknesses further complicated the experiences of SI/L
among older adults in Africa. Since familial support was severely
hit in a similar measure across all the countries, the ability of
the government to provide practical medical, social, and material
support varied greatly between places. Therefore, given the lack
of comparative evidence, it is safe to assume that older adults
in other parts of the world fared better during the pandemic
because government support was available. Future researchers
should consider geographically comparative research, which is
needed to answer these questions.

There were important research and policy gaps regarding the
experiences of COVID-19 among older adults in the African
literature. Regarding the research gap, there have been relatively
few large-scale research projects (mixed methods, qualitative, and
quantitative) in Africa documenting older adults’ social, physical,
and mental health experiences through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hence, the evidence is sparse. The World Health Organization’s
Regional Oﬃce for Africa report also recognizes these gaps. In
addition, a large proportion of evidence emerged from a few
select African countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, South
Africa, and Uganda. Unfortunately, these are just too few to drive
the evidence from Africa and allow researchers to make claims
about SI/L experiences broadly. Hence, the WHO’s 2021 report on
the impact of COVID-19 on older African adults relied on case
studies rather than community experiences (1). Therefore, it is
essential to conduct empirical research to explore the challenges
older adults experienced during the COVID-19 restrictions. Also,
such data will help identify the changes over time, especially
because the pandemic has historical value. In addition, the outcome
of such research will provide the basis for policy intervention in the
core areas of unmet needs and assistance to resource management
planning for governments in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic also exposed weaknesses in the
policy framework for caring for older adults in many Africa
in Nigeria, during the pandemic, the
countries. For example,

the vulnerable
government’s inability to adequately support
population, including older adults, triggered the restart of the
National
Identiﬁcation registration system, which had been
redundant since 1999. In addition, to addressing the national
registration issues, it was essential to consider integrated healthcare
services at the community level. Community-level support for
mental, social, and physical wellbeing support was absent in most
African countries. An integrated approach is necessary because the
communal approach to care was unsustainable during the height of
the pandemic. Therefore, it is vital to consider complementing the
existing care structure through policies and programs that operate
at the community level. An example of successful community-
integrated eﬀorts during COVID-19 was in Vietnam (48), where
grassroots health networks consisting of district hospitals, health
centers, health stations, and village health collaborators led the
community-level engagements with the people. Such models will
be valuable for building strong and resilient support systems
for older African adults, given the network-oriented nature of
African communities.

mental and physical health challenges outcomes which integrated
care service at the community and government support could have
addressed if they were available. It is important to address the
research and policy gaps to capture the spectrum of COVID-19
experiences and provide intervention for older adults.

Limitations

Funding

The African focus of this scoping review is restricted because
only a few studies were available from Africa, as there were only
ﬁve African countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and
Uganda) involved in the review. Only a limited number of studies
describe the COVID-19 experiences of older adults in Africa. Seven
articles reported studies conducted in Nigeria (4 articles) and
Ghana (3 articles). Thus, the review can only focus on West Africa.
Also, most of the included articles were based on qualitative studies.
Therefore, it was impossible to derive population-wide estimates of
essential associations in quantitative terms. Also, the rural-urban
dichotomy of the study areas is subject to debate globally because
there is no consensus about the deﬁnition of rurality or urbanity.
Finally, due to the paucity of large-scale examples, this review
was limited in comparing Africa with other continents to provide
insight into the causes and consequences of SI/L among older adults
during COVID-19 (31).

Conclusion

This is the ﬁrst known review exploring the social isolation
and loneliness of older adults in Africa during the COVID-19
pandemic. Similar to many countries which enacted COVID-19
lockdown policies, the experience of SI/L among older adults
in Africa was primarily caused by the lockdown restrictions. In
African countries, these lockdown policies resulted in a severance
of older adults from the cultural structure of care for older
adults and their familial support systems. Weak government
intervention, the existing rural-urban disproportionate spread
of infrastructure and social welfare services, personal situations,
challenges regarding technology, and detachment
from daily
activities, disproportionately aﬀected older adults in Africa. Care
structures like the family and community could not implement
the required intervention. SI/L among older adults in Africa had
