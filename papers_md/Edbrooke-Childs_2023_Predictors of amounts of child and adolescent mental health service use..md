Abstract
The aim of this study was to build evidence about how to tailor services to meet the individual needs of young people by 
identifying predictors of amounts of child and adolescent mental health service use. We conducted a secondary analysis of 
a large administrative dataset from services in England was conducted using the Mental Health Services Data Set (years 
2016–17 and 2017–18). The final sample included N = 27,362 episodes of care (periods of service use consisting of at 
least two attended care contacts and less than 180 days between care contacts) from 39 services. There were 50–10,855 
episodes per service. The descriptive statistics for episodes of care were: Mage = 13 years,  SDage = 4.71, range = 0–25 years; 
13,785 or 50% male. Overall, there were high levels of heterogeneity in number of care contacts within episodes of care: 
M = 11.12, SD = 28.28, range = 2–1529. Certain characteristics predicted differential patterns of service use. For example, 
young people with substance use (beta = 6.29, 95% CI = 5.06–7.53) or eating disorders (beta = 4.30, 95% CI = 3.29–5.30) 
were particularly more likely to have higher levels of service use. To build on this, evidence is needed about predictors of 
child and adolescent mental health treatment outcome and whether the same characteristics predict levels of improvement 
as well as levels of service use.

Introduction

One  in  six  young  people  in  England  experience  mental 
health difficulties [1]. The focus of the present research is 
publicly funded child and adolescent mental health services, 
which are free at the point of contact. THRIVE is the lead-
ing model for child and adolescent mental health services in 
England [2]. Here, service provision is organised into five 
needs-based groupings: (1) Thriving—those not in need of 
specialist mental health support; (2) Getting Advice—those 
in need of advice, signposting to other forms of support, and 
consultation; (3) Getting Help—those in need of specific 
goal-focussed support (e.g., a time limited intervention); (4) 
Getting More Help—those in need of extended and more

specialist support; and (5) Getting Risk Support—those with 
ongoing needs who have not benefited from treatment.

Policy in England calls for child and adolescent mental 
health services to be tailored to meet the individual needs 
of young people [3]. One approach to tailoring services is 
through case-mix classification systems or clustering tools, 
which identify groups of service users with similar charac-
teristics and therefore, similar levels of service use need [4]. 
Systematic reviews have identified a range of case-mix char-
acteristics and classification systems for amounts of adult 
mental health service use [5, 6]. There is less extensive evi-
dence for child and adolescent mental health. A recent sys-
tematic review found higher levels of service use in young 
adults for example, with higher levels of prior service use or 
those who were female, gay, or bisexual [7]. There is a need 
for recent evidence from large-scale datasets from child and 
adolescent mental health services as the most recent data 
were collected up to 2014 and included up to 11 services [8, 
9]. These studies identified high levels of heterogeneity in 
amounts of service use.

Martin et al. [8] used a conceptual classification system, 
based on the aforementioned THRIVE model, to identify

18 needs-based groups. Young people in certain sub-groups 
within the Getting Help and Getting More Help groupings, 
such as those with depression, self-harm, eating disorder, 
or psychosis, had higher levels of service use. In addition, 
young people with comorbid needs (co-occurring behav-
ioural and emotional difficulties or co-occurring emotional 
difficulties) also had higher levels of service use. However, 
the relationship between comorbidity and levels of service 
use is complicated due to the impact comorbidity has on 
treatment engagement.

Quantitative studies are generally inconclusive about 
the role of levels of need on premature treatment termi-
nation, such as whether higher levels of need are associ-
ated with higher levels of premature treatment termination 
[10–13].  Theory  and  evidence  from  qualitative  studies 
indicate a range of reasons for premature treatment termi-
nation [14–16]. For example, young people with complex 
and multiple needs may experience additional challenges 
to engaging with treatment and may be more likely to have 
premature treatment termination. Young people may be dis-
satisfied with treatment, or they may have gained what they 
needed before reaching the end of treatment, and may be 
more likely to have premature treatment termination [17].

The aim of the present study was to build on the extant 
literature and identify predictors of amounts of service use 
in a large administrative dataset from child and adolescent 
mental health services in England.

Methods

Data preparation and procedure

Data were sourced from routinely collected administrative 
data, extracted from the ‘community activity data package’ 
of the Mental Health Services Data Set by NHS Digital 
(years 2016–17 and 2017–18) [18]. For more information on 
the dataset including data coverage, see NHS Digital [19]. 
This package comprises administrative data collected from 
all publicly funded community services (i.e., not inpatient 
services) in England. However, only services that submit-
ted data were included, meaning not all services may be 
represented. No information about services which did not 
provide data (including how many services did not provide 
data) are available. A service refers to a collection of mental 
health teams that provide care over a specified geographical 
area. From this extract, services that submitted data on care 
contacts during the 2016–17 and 2017–18 financial years 
were included if they had at least 50 closed episodes of care.
Care contacts were filtered to include those where the 
mode of communication was face-to-face, telephone, tele-
medicine or not stated, and to exclude those where the mode 
of communication was text message or email; in line with 

previous research [8], telephone contacts were included to 
capture direct contact with service users. Episodes of care 
were constructed, referring to periods of service use con-
sisting of at least two attended care contacts and less than 
180 days between care contacts based on session date. We 
adapted our operationalisation of episodes of care from 
[20]; here, three care contacts were required, however, we 
used two because this is in line with national analyses of the 
present dataset [21]. Episodes of care were included in the 
present analysis if the age at episode start was 0–25 years, 
the episode of care was closed, and there was complete data 
on presenting difficulties (see Measures).

The filtering process is shown in supplementary Fig. 1. 
There were 50,242,747 care contacts relating to 5,350,642 
referrals. We excluded 35,749,942 care contacts (not aged 
0–27 years), resulting in 14,492,805 care contacts relating 
to 1,666,832 referrals. From this, we constructed 459,514 
episodes of care (2 care contacts, < 180 days apart, excluded 
text, email, unattended), meaning 3,683,810 referrals were 
excluded. Then 34,574 were excluded because young people 
were aged 26–27 years. This resulted in 424,940 episodes 
of care, of which 397,578 episodes of care were excluded, 
mainly because presenting difficulties information was miss-
ing. Although there are various definitions of young peo-
ple and age limits for youth mental health services in the 
United Kingdom, we restricted the sample in the third step 
to exclude episodes of care 26–27 years. On reflection, we 
decided an upper age limit of 25 years was more in keeping 
with general classification approaches used by services.

This resulted in a final dataset of N = 27,362 episodes 
from  39  services  with  50–10,855  episodes  per  service 
(Mage = 13 years,  SDage = 4.71, range = 0–25 years; 13,785 
or 50% male); please see Table 1 for descriptive statistics 
on all study variables and supplementary Fig. 1 for full data 
processing and inclusion flow chart. These episodes of care 
were for 27,033 young people, meaning < 3% of young peo-
ple had more than one episode of care during the time period 
under study. The study was approved by the University Col-
lege London Research Ethics Committee (12689/001) and 
the NHS Digital Data Access Request Service (DARS-NIC-
140981-R5N6Z). A range of data are collected as part of the 
‘community activity data package’ and we included data in 
accordance with the a priori research questions.

Measures

Deprivation

Deprivation was reported using quintiles of the Income Dep-
rivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) based on young 
people’s local area of residence. Local area of residence was 
available at the level of the Lower Layer Super Output Area,

N = 27,362  episodes  of  care  for  27,033  young  people,  from  39  ser-
vices  with  50–10,855  episodes  per  service.  Neighbourhood  SES 
(socio-economic  status)  was  derived  using  quintiles  of  the  income 
deprivation affecting children index. Frequencies of the broad ethnic 
groups (i.e., the sum of the relevant specific groups), used in the main 
analysis, are highlighted in italics

which is the smallest geographic area in England at which 
deprivation is routinely measured.

Demographic characteristics

Age, sex, and ethnicity were recorded by services as part of 
routine data recording. We refer to sex as our understanding 
is this variable refers to sex-assigned at birth rather than 
gender.

Ethnicity  was  generally  reported  by  the  child,  young 
person, or parent/carer at the initial stages of contact with 
the service and was captured using the categories from the 
2001 Census. These were grouped for analysis as follows: 
Asian (Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, “other” 
Asian  background),  Black  (African,  Caribbean,  “other” 
Black background), Mixed-race (White and Asian, White 
and Black African, White and Black Caribbean, “other” 
Mixed-race background), White British, “other” White back-
ground (White Irish, “other” White background), “other” 
ethnic background, and not reported or known. We present 
the broad and specific groups in the descriptive statistics 
(Table 1), and we used the broad groups in the main analysis 
to avoid including underpowered groups.

Referral route

The individual or organisation making the referral, or the 
referral source, was recorded by services using 44 categories 
that were grouped into nine study variables for the present 
analysis: primary care, self-referral, education, social care/ 
youth justice, child health, emergency department, mental 
health, other, and not reported.

Presenting difficulties

Two sources were used to identify the presence or absence 
of 30 non-mutually exclusive presenting difficulties. First, 

1 32338

European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2023) 32:2335–2342

the 30-item clinician-reported Current View questionnaire 
[22] on presenting problems were used. Second, clinician-
reported ICD-10 free-text diagnoses were used. Each ICD-
10 diagnosis in the dataset was looked up and then mapped 
by hand on to the corresponding item of the 30 Current View 
presenting problems. This was conducted by one author and 
then reviewed by co-authors in team meetings. New vari-
ables were created by transforming the string ICD-10 codes 
to a Current View presenting problem. The ICD-10 recoded 
presenting problems when then added to the Current View 
presenting problems. Episodes of care were included if there 
was one source of presenting problems, resulting in three 
possibilities:

1.  If an episode of care only had Current View presenting 

problems, these data points were retained;

2.  If an episode of care only had ICD-10 presenting prob-
lems, that had been recoded into corresponding Cur-
rent View presenting problems, these data points were 
retained;

3.  If an episode of care had both Current View and ICD-
10 presenting problems, these data points were merged. 
ICD-10 presenting problems were added to the Current 
View ones.

Thus, we created one set of harmonised 30 presenting dif-
ficulties. Presenting difficulties using these two approaches 
are typically completed during the initial stages of treatment 
as part of the initial assessment sessions.

To avoid including an excessive number of presenting 
difficulty variables in the main analysis, internalising dif-
ficulties were grouped together (e.g., social anxiety, low 
mood), externalising difficulties were grouped together (i.e., 
conduct disorder, carers having difficulties managing the 
young person’s behaviour), neurodevelopmental problems 
were grouped together (i.e., attention-deficit-hyperactivity-
disorder, developmental), schizoaffective difficulties were 
grouped together (i.e., bipolar disorder, psychotic symp-
toms), and relational problems were grouped together (e.g., 
peer relationship difficulties, family relationship difficulties). 
In addition, to avoid including underpowered groups in the 
main analysis, presenting difficulties with < 10% frequency 
were  excluded:  toilet  problem,  mutism,  gender  identity, 
unexplained physical health problems, and adjustment to 
physical health problems (the episode of care was retained). 
This resulted in a final set of 12 presenting difficulty vari-
ables (please see Table 1).

Analytic strategy

To investigate predictors of child and adolescent mental 
health service use, multilevel regressions were performed 
in STATA 16 [23]. There were two levels in the multilevel 

regressions, episode of care as the level one group and ser-
vice as the level two group. As < 3% of young people had 
more than one episode of care, the analysis was underpow-
ered to include young person as a group. A null model with-
out predictors was computed with number of care contacts 
as the criterion variable, and the intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient (ICC) was calculated. To examine the associations with 
individual-level characteristics, level-1 predictor variables 
were added in Model 1: deprivation with the least deprived 
quintile coded as the reference category to facilitate interpre-
tation; demographic characteristics of grand-mean centred 
age and female (with male as the reference category as it was 
marginally the largest group); ethnicity (with White British 
as the reference category as it was the largest group); refer-
ral source with primary care as the reference category as it 
was the largest group; and the 12 non-mutually exclusive 
presenting difficulty variables. As the present manuscript is 
based on a secondary analysis of anonymised administrative 
data, we do not have further information than that included 
in the data. There is not additional regional data and we were 
unable to match to any other service or regional data as these 
are anonymised. We examined outliers, multicollinearity, 
and non-normally distributed residuals. All of the predictor 
variables were binary or categorical, therefore we inspected 
groups with very low frequencies. There were some low 
frequencies (< 5%) in ethnicity and referral sources but these 
were retained due to theoretical importance. After running 
the multilevel regressions, we plotted the residuals in a Q-Q 
plot. This indicated some high skew, indicating that lower 
and  higher  values  were  higher  than  predicted  (see  Sup-
plementary material). We examined correlations between 
binary and continuous predictor variables (age, gender, and 
the presenting difficulty variables). The majority of correla-
tions were significant but none were above 0.7 (the largest 
was 0.48) (see Supplementary material).

Results

Overall, there were high levels of heterogeneity in num-
ber of care contacts per episode: M = 11.12, SD = 28.28, 
median = 6, range = 2–1,529. As expected based on previous 
research [8, 24] number of care contacts was non-normally 
distributed: 18,878 (68.99%) had 2–9 care contacts, 6,832 
(24.97%) had 10–29 care contacts, 958 (3.5%) had 30–49 
care contacts, and 694 (2.54%) had 50 + care contacts. In 
the null model, the ICC indicated that 24% of the variance 
in number of care contacts was explained at the service-
level,  which  remained  relatively  unchanged  in  Model  1 
(20%). This suggests that almost a quarter of the difference 
in number of care contacts was due to in which service the 
episode of care occurred. Model 1 was a significantly better 
fit to the data than the null model according to the likelihood

N = 27,362 episodes of care for 27,033 young people, from 39 services with 50–10,855 episodes per ser-
vice. Neighbourhood SES (socio-economic status) was derived using quintiles of the income deprivation 
affecting children index. Coefficients in bold are significant at least at the p < 0.05 level

shown in Table 2.

There were no significant effects of economic disadvan-
tage. Regarding demographics, females had higher numbers 
of care contacts than males, and older young people had 
lower numbers of care contacts than younger young people. 
Compared to White British young people, Mixed-race young 
people had higher numbers of care contacts, and young peo-
ple with not reported or known ethnic identities had lower 
numbers of care contacts. Regarding referral source, young 
people  referred  through  social  care/youth  justice,  child 

health, or mental health had higher numbers of care contacts 
than young people referred through primary care.

Regarding presenting difficulties, young people with 
substance use, eating disorders, self-care difficulties (e.g., 
personal hygiene), or schizoaffective difficulties had higher 
numbers of care contacts than young people without these 
presenting difficulties. Young people with substance use 
(beta = 6.29) or eating disorders (beta = 4.30) were par-
ticularly more likely to have higher levels of service use. 
Broadly speaking, this suggests for example that episodes 
of care with substance use as a presenting difficulty had 
6.29 more care contacts than episodes  of care without 

1 32340

substance  use,  while  controlling  for  other  predictors. 
In contrast, young people with internalising difficulties 
(beta = − 2.00) or relational difficulties (beta = − 3.25) had 
lower numbers of care contacts than young people without 
these presenting difficulties.

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to build on the extant lit-
erature and identify predictors of amounts of service use in a 
large administrative dataset from child and adolescent men-
tal health services in England. In line with previous studies 
[8, 9], there were high levels of heterogeneity in amounts 
of  service  use,  with  an  average  of  11.12  care  contacts 
(SD = 28.28, range = 2–1529). We also found that almost a 
quarter of the difference in number of care contacts was due 
to in which service the episode of care occurred.

Regarding presenting difficulties, young people with 
substance use, eating disorders, self-care difficulties, or 
schizoaffective  difficulties  had  higher  numbers  of  care 
contacts than young people without these presenting dif-
ficulties, and there were larger effects for substance use 
and eating disorders. These findings are in line with previ-
ous similar research, that found for example associations 
between psychosis and eating disorders with child mental 
health service use, although not substance use [8].

In addition, young people with internalising difficulties 
or relational difficulties had lower numbers of care contacts 
than young people without these presenting  difficulties. 
Young people with internalising difficulties or relational dif-
ficulties may need more specific goal-focussed support or 
advice, signposting, and consultation such as for peer rela-
tionship work in schools or family relationship work in com-
munity and voluntary sector services. Alternatively, young 
people with these difficulties may have been more likely to 
prematurely terminate treatment, due to experiencing addi-
tional challenges to engaging with care, dissatisfaction with 
care, or having their needs met before the end of treatment 
[14]. Future research should examine the potential role of 
comorbidity in number of care contacts.

The findings of the present research are in line with 
the THRIVE model of child and adolescent mental health 
service provision in England [2]. Young people with sub-
stance use, eating disorders, self-care difficulties, or schiz-
oaffective difficulties may need extended and more special-
ist support. Future research is needed to examine whether 
young people with these difficulties are benefitting from 
longer treatment or whether they have ongoing needs that 
are not benefited from treatment. Considering that previ-
ous quantitative studies have generally been inconclusive 
about the role of levels of need on premature treatment 
termination [10–12], future research should examine the 

association between severity of presenting difficulties, in 
addition to type of presenting difficulties, and service use. 
One approach could be to examine the needs-based defini-
tion of premature treatment termination, where episodes of 
care are classified based on whether or not they completed 
the optimal number of sessions based on levels of need on 
intake [13, 25].

The findings of the present research add to the literature 
as they provide recent evidence on child mental health ser-
vice use from a large administrative dataset. The extant liter-
ature suggests that whilst young people with more complex 
difficulties might require longer treatment durations, they 
may also be more likely to experience premature treatment 
termination (see Introduction). The findings of the present 
research help to address this gap, showing that young peo-
ple with more complex difficulties had higher numbers of 
episodes of care. The large amount of variation explained 
at the service-level (24%) may potentially be explained by 
the complexity of difficulties, as it may be that services 
supporting young people with these difficulties were more 
specialist. For example, substance use had the highest num-
ber of episodes of care but was only present for < 10% of 
young people, and support for substance use may have been 
provided by dedicated services. When supporting young 
people with substance use, eating disorders, self-care dif-
ficulties, or schizoaffective difficulties, the findings of the 
present research may suggest that discussing the likelihood 
that support may take some time, and developing a plan for 
supporting the young person to remain engaged with support 
over this time, may help to tailor support to the individual 
needs of young people.

Young people referred through social care/youth justice 
had higher numbers of care contacts than young people 
referred through primary care. Referral through this route 
is less likely to be voluntary, and it may be that engage-
ment with services was higher as this was compulsory [26]. 
Young  people  referred  through  mental  health  and  child 
health had higher numbers of care contacts than young peo-
ple referred through primary care. Referral through these 
routes may indicate, or be perceived as indicating, a higher 
level  need  and  correspondingly  treatment  duration.  For 
example, in another paper examining data from England, 
when referrals came via mental health, they had a shorter 
wait than cases referred form primary care [27]. Future 
research could extend this by examining differences in pat-
terns of service use by referral route. With the increase of 
remote therapy, future research examining differences in 
service use by appointment medium would be particularly 
helpful to informing the tailoring and funding of services.

Young women had higher levels of service use than 
young men, consistent with the troubling pattern in the 
literature of higher, and increasing, levels of mental health 
difficulties for young women [1]. Future research is needed

to explain the finding that young people from Mixed-race 
backgrounds had higher levels of service use than young 
people from White British backgrounds. Young people 
with not reported ethnicity had lower levels of service 
use than young people from White British backgrounds, 
and future research should examine whether not reporting 
ethnicity is in and of itself an indicator of challenges with 
engagement, for example because of a process issue in the 
service meaning they are not able to collect or record this 
information or because there is a lack of trust for young 
people in services meaning they are less likely to report 
this information.

Limitations

The limitations of using administrative data should be 
considered when interpreting the findings of the present 
research [28]. For example, there may have been differ-
ences  in  how  sites  collected  and  coded  the  data  (e.g., 
referral sources) and services differed in size generally 
according to the size of the population for whom they 
cared. Correspondingly, some services may have had more 
than one team. In addition, the same young person may 
have been included in different services as young person 
identifiers were unique within, but not necessarily across, 
services. Moreover, relatively large amounts of data were 
excluded at both the service and episode of care levels 
due to missingness. Although not unusual for administra-
tive data, it does highlight the need to find ways to obtain 
high quality data on larger percentages of episodes of care 
receiving public services. There was a lack of data both 
at the service level and at the regional level, meaning we 
were unable to examine the influence of these contextual 
factors on service use. As for other countries, there is a 
lack of national data on the number of child mental health 
services, meaning we cannot fully understand how many 
services are not included in our data or even describe the 
child mental health system.

Presenting difficulties were identified using two differ-
ent types of clinician reports, Current View questionnaire 
[22]  presenting  problems  and  ICD-10  free-text  diagno-
ses mapped on to the Current View presenting problems. 
Although this resulted in a more comprehensive assessment 
of presenting difficulties than relying on one data source, it 
may have also resulted in inconsistencies in mapping across 
sources and moreover, ICD-10 diagnoses may have been 
inaccurately recorded. In particular, coding was conducted 
by one researcher, although it was cross-checked by the 
other researchers in team meetings. Future research should 
examine predictors of different types of care contacts and 
professionals involved in care contacts to provide a more 
granular understanding of the child and adolescent mental 

health service use needs for young people. This could, for 
example, include information on the needs-based grouping 
of young people, based on presenting difficulties [2]. Future 
research should also go beyond administrative data to follow 
up young people after they stop using services to examine 
whether their needs have been sufficiently met or whether 
they have been unable to continue to use services [14].

The lack of significant association between economic 
disadvantage and number of care contacts warrants further 
investigation. It should be noted that a lack of data on struc-
tural inequalities may be masking the wider picture on social 
inequalities [29]. It could be that economic disadvantage 
has less of an impact on service engagement once support 
is initiated, whereas young people in areas of higher levels 
of economic disadvantage may have higher levels of unmet 
need and be less likely to be referred to mental health ser-
vices. The indicator of economic disadvantage was based 
on geographical area, and a more specific indicator of actual 
family-level economic disadvantage may have shown a dif-
ferent pattern of results.

Conclusion

Notwithstanding  the  above  limitations,  the  present 
research identified predictors of amounts of service use 
in a large and recent administrative dataset from child 
and adolescent mental health services in England. Young 
people with substance use or eating disorders were par-
ticularly likely to have higher numbers of care contacts. 
To build on this, evidence is needed about predictors of 
child and adolescent mental health treatment outcome and 
whether the same characteristics predict levels of improve-
ment as well as levels of service use.
