Abstract
Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a structured outpatient treatment developed by Dr Marsha Linehan for
the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive-
behavioral principles and is currently the only empirically supported treatment for BPD. Randomized
controlled trials have shown the efficacy of DBT not only in BPD but also in other psychiatric disorders,
such as substance use disorders, mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders.
Traditional DBT is structured into 4 components, including skills training group, individual psychotherapy,
to teach
telephone consultation, and therapist consultation team. These components work together
behavioral skills that target common symptoms of BPD,
including an unstable sense of self, chaotic
relationships, fear of abandonment, emotional lability, and impulsivity such as self-injurious behaviors. The
skills include mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. Given the
often comorbid psychiatric symptoms with BPD in patients participating in DBT, psychopharmacologic
interventions are oftentimes considered appropriate adjunctive care. This article aims to outline the basic
principles of DBT as well as comment on the role of pharmacotherapy as adjunctive treatment for the
symptoms of BPD.

is a structured
Dialectical behavior
outpatient treatment based on cognitive-behavioral prin-
ciples developed by Dr Marsha Linehan in the early 1990s
for the treatment of parasuicidal behavior in women with

borderline personality disorder (BPD).1 Linehan defines
parasuicidal behavior as ‘‘any intentional, acute self-
injurious behavior with or without suicidal intent, includ-
ing both suicide attempts and self-mutilative behaviors.’’2
Borderline personality disorder, as outlined by the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5), is
a chronic disorder that includes symptoms such as frantic
efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, unstable
relationships, identity disturbance, impulsive and danger-
ous behaviors, recurrent suicidal threats or self-mutilating
behaviors, affective instability,
feelings of emptiness,
difficulties controlling anger, and/or stress-related para-
noid thoughts or dissociation.3 The lifetime prevalence of
BPD is approximately 6%.4 Borderline personality disorder
accounts for significantly higher health care costs than
both major depressive disorder and other personality
disorders.5 These high medical costs can be attributed to a

The term ‘‘dialectical’’ means the interaction of conflicting
ideas. Within DBT, ‘‘dialectical’’ refers to the integration
of both acceptance and change as necessities for
improvement.6 Dialectical behavior

supported treatment for BPD as demonstrated by the
Cochrane Collaborative Review.7 Research has also shown
it be effective in treatment of substance use disorders,
mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
eating disorders in both adults and adolescents.8 Given
the often comorbid psychiatric symptoms with BPD in
patients participating in DBT, psychopharmacologic inter-
ventions are oftentimes considered appropriate adjunctive
care. This article aims to outline the basic principles of
DBT as well as comment on the role of pharmacotherapy
as adjunctive treatment for the symptoms of BPD.

The Efficacy of DBT in Borderline
Personality Disorder and Other
Psychiatric Disorders

There have been several randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) studying the efficacy of DBT in BPD. The Linehan
Institute compiled a list of RCTs reviewing studies on DBT
since 1991.8 This compilation shows that DBT has been
more effective than community-based treatment-as-usual
in numerous areas, including reducing parasuicidal behav-
iors, increasing adherence to treatment, and reducing the
number of hospitalizations. Dialectical behavior therapy
has also been efficacious in comorbid substance use
disorders, binge eating disorder, depression, and bulimia
nervosa.8 In addition, it has been studied with primary
diagnoses of trichotillomania, bipolar disorder, attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders (eg, binge
eating, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa), adolescents
with behavioral disorders, and PTSD.8 Noticeably, many
of the aforementioned psychiatric disorders share diag-
nostic criteria with BPD, such as impulsivity, labile mood,
interpersonal difficulties, suicidal behaviors, and/or en-
gagement
in risky behaviors. These shared target
symptoms likely contribute to DBT’s efficacy across
disorders.

DBT Structure

Traditional DBT consists of 4 components: skills training
group, individual psychotherapy, telephone consultation,
and therapist consultation team. This treatment structure
was used in the RCTs validating its effectiveness; however,

DBT can be modified or shortened to accommodate any
treatment setting,
including solo private practices or
inpatient facilities.1,6

Skills Training Group

Linehan’s DBT manual explains that the skills training
group is designed to target behavioral skill deficits that
are common to patients with BPD, including an unstable
sense of self, chaotic relationships, fear of abandonment,
emotional lability, and impulsivity. The group focuses on
teaching psychosocial skills that target these deficits
through 4 skills training modules: core mindfulness,
interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and
distress tolerance. The group typically meets weekly for
approximately 2 hours, and it takes about 6 months to
complete all of the modules. Individuals can choose to
repeat the modules, and it is recommended that patients
who are new to DBT stay in the skills training group for at
least 1 year. Patients are assigned homework to reinforce
skills and given diary cards to keep track of how they are
using the skills outside of the group. Although patients
can discuss with the group how they are using the skills,
they are encouraged to process their diary cards primarily
with their individual therapists.6
Core Mindfulness
The core mindfulness skills are central to all of the skills
taught in DBT and are frequently revisited within the other
3 modules. Many of these skills have been adopted from
Eastern meditation practices. The mindfulness skills are
divided into ‘‘what’’ skills and ‘‘how’’ skills. The ‘‘what’’
skills teach patients to observe, describe, and participate
fully in the present moment. These skills are meant to
target the tendency of patients to participate without
awareness through impulsive and emotion-driven behav-
iors. The ‘‘how’’ skills teach patients to be present in the
moment with a nonjudgmental mindset, focusing on one
thing at a time, and in an effective manner. These skills
target the tendency of patients to idealize and devalue
both themselves and other people as well as the tendency
for patients to ruminate about the past or worry about the
future instead of living in the present moment.6
Interpersonal Effectiveness
The interpersonal effectiveness module focuses on
teaching and practicing social skills that are effective in
relationships. Many patients with BPD have a history of
childhood abuse, neglect, or other forms of invalidation
that made it difficult for them to form secure attachments
early in life. They therefore often experience intense,
unstable relationships in which they have trouble asserting
themselves. Although these patients fear abandonment,
they frequently end relationships prematurely because of
difficulties tolerating conflict. The interpersonal strategies
teach patients how to ask for what they need, say ‘‘no’’ to
inappropriate demands, and cope with interpersonal
conflict. The focus of these strategies is in learning to

keep meaningful relationships, while also maintaining self-
respect.6
Emotion Regulation
The emotion regulation skills are strategies for enhancing
control over personal emotions. For individuals with BPD,
emotions can be intense and labile. This often leads to the
development of dysfunctional behaviors that are aimed at
avoiding negative emotions. The emotion regulation skills
first work on identifying and labeling emotions so that
patients can understand how emotions can lead to
behaviors affecting their overall functioning. The patients
also learn to identify obstacles to changing their
emotions, which often include parasuicidal and other
dysfunctional behaviors that have been used by a patient
for communication or validation of their experience.
Patients are taught to avoid vulnerable situations that
often lead to negative emotions and taught to increase
events in their
frequently lead to positive
emotions. Patients are encouraged to use mindfulness
techniques to accept and tolerate painful emotions in a
nonjudgmental way.6
Distress Tolerance
The distress tolerance skills teach patients that pain and
distress are an inevitable part of life, and unwillingness to
accept this fact often leads to greater suffering. This
module shows patients how to experience their current
situation nonjudgmentally without attempting to change
it. It is important to note that accepting their current
situation does not mean that they must approve of their
current situation. The distress tolerance skills include both
crisis survival and acceptance strategies. The crisis survival
skills teach patients techniques for distracting, self-
soothing, and adjusting their thoughts in the moment.
The acceptance skills work on transforming intolerable
suffering into pain that can be tolerated.6

Individual Psychotherapy

Within the weekly individual therapy module of treat-
focus: parasuicidal
ment, there are 6 main areas of
behaviors, therapy-interfering behaviors, behaviors that
interfere with quality of life, behavioral skills acquisition,
posttraumatic stress behaviors, and self-respect behav-
iors.9 These are meant to supplement and enhance the
group therapy module of treatment. Individual therapy is
conducted by the patient’s primary therapist on the
patient’s treatment team and is usually someone selected
by the patient.1

Parasuicidal behaviors, whether those with actual suicidal
intent or not, are never to be ignored in DBT. Parasuicidal
behaviors are explored in detail, and emphasis is also
placed on problem-solving behaviors, engaging in active
coping, and using short-term distress management
techniques. Previous trauma may need to be addressed
if posttraumatic stress behaviors occur, as it can influence

parasuicidal behaviors. However, the focus should initially
be on current parasuicidal behaviors.9

Therapy-interfering behaviors can occur on the behalf of
both therapist and patient. Patient interference includes
anything that may interfere with receiving therapy or lead

to therapist burnout
behavior, breaking agreements with the therapist that
are repeatedly addressed). By reducing therapy-interfer-
ing behaviors, drop-out
rates can be significantly
reduced.9

(eg, nonadherence,

Behaviors that interfere with quality of life include any
behaviors that may seriously interfere with development
of an improved lifestyle for the patient. Some examples
are substance abuse, high-risk sexual behaviors, financial
or employment concerns, and/or any behaviors with
potential legal, interpersonal, or health issues.9

Behavioral skills are considered those skills that will be
used in the patient’s daily life. These behaviors specifically
address BPD traits defined in the DSM-5. Mindfulness,
distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal
effectiveness skills are explained in further detail and
applied to the patient’s everyday life. In addition, new
self-management skills (eg, learning/maintaining healthy
behaviors, eliminating unhealthy behaviors) are taught
and reinforced throughout individual therapy.9

Most patients, particularly those with BPD, enter therapy
with a trauma history.9 Although trauma and posttrau-
matic symptoms may initially remain unaddressed be-
cause of the priority of suicidal behaviors, it is important
that the therapist address trauma history when the
patient appears ready. This focus includes remembering
the abuse (eg, validation of memories, acknowledging
emotions related to abuse),
reducing self-blame and
stigmatization, ending denial and intrusive thoughts
regarding abuse (eg, exposure techniques), and reducing
polarization or dialectical view of the self and the abuser.9

Last, self-respect behaviors are designed to enhance the
patient’s ability to validate him or herself. It is important
for the patient to build greater self-reliance. The therapist
will need to consistently reinforce self-respect behaviors
throughout the therapy process.9

Telephone Consultation

Telephone consultation allows the patient to contact the
individual therapist for in-the-moment guidance. Phone
calls are designed to teach patients how to ask for help
effectively and to apply skills learned in therapy to
everyday life, especially during times of crisis. Patients
with BPD often do not ask for help because they feel

designed to minimize reinforcement of parasuicidal
behaviors. For that reason, patients are told at the
beginning of therapy that they are expected to call their
therapist before engaging in parasuicidal
individual
behavior. In addition, the patient is not allowed to call
the therapist for 24 hours after engaging in parasuicidal
behavior unless there are life-threatening injuries. The 24-
hour rule is meant to encourage patients to seek help
from the therapist at earlier stages of a crisis while the
therapist can still offer assistance and not after the patient
has already chosen maladaptive behaviors.1

this part of

Many therapists are fearful and overwhelmed by the idea
of being available to their patients at all hours of the day
and night. For this reason, many therapists limit when
they are available or choose not to participate in this part
of DBT treatment. Nevertheless,
the
treatment module is strongly recommended in order to
reduce parasuicidal behaviors. The length and frequency
of permissible phone conversations vary for different
therapists and different patients. Many therapists quickly
realize that many of the patients do not utilize the phone
coaching as often as they should. For patients who abuse
the telephone conversations, this becomes a therapy-
interfering behavior that is addressed during individual
therapy sessions. When DBT is restructured in various
outpatient or inpatient settings, other providers such as
mental health technicians, nurses, or on-call psychiatrists
may fill this role.1

Therapist Consultation Team

The therapist consultation team is a weekly meeting of all
individual and group therapists who are currently
providing DBT. Working with patients with BPD who are
highly suicidal can be challenging and stressful. Significant
stress can lead therapists to react in problematic ways
during treatment. The therapist consultation team func-
tions to maintain motivation and commitment among all
providers in order to provide optimal treatment.1 It can
also be used to promote empathy within the therapist,
focusing on accepting the patient rather than forcing
change upon the patient, that will ultimately help reduce
parasuicidal behaviors in the patient.9 If a group setting is
not possible, all DBT therapists are strongly encouraged to
be a part of some form of consultation or supervision
relationship.1

Pharmacologic Considerations for
Treatment of BPD

In general, psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for
BPD over psychotropic medications.10 In fact, the National
Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has
published guidelines that medication should not be used
specifically for BPD or symptoms associated with BPD.11
However, patients with personality disorders are pre-
scribed medications more frequently than any other
diagnostic group,12 and the American Psychiatric Associ-
ation declared pharmacotherapy as having an important
‘‘adjunctive role’’ in treatment of personality disorders.13

In a 2012 multicenter study in the United Kingdom,
researchers showed that within a sample of 161 patients
with BPD, approximately 45% were prescribed second-
generation antipsychotics (other than clozapine), 40%
were prescribed mood stabilizers, and 20% were pre-
scribed clozapine. Polypharmacy (including antidepres-
sants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines,
and ‘‘other’’ medications) was also shown to be common,
with approximately 62% of patients on 2 or more
medications and approximately 24% on 3 or more
medications. In this study, approximately 80% of patients
with BPD had past or current comorbid psychiatric
disorders,
including schizophrenia, PTSD, depression,
bipolar disorder, and/or anxiety. Additionally, approxi-
mately 60% of the 14 ‘‘consultants’’ involved in manage-
ment of these subjects with BPD disagreed with the NICE
guidelines, and none completely agreed with the guide-
lines.10

In the scientific literature, there appears to be mixed
evidence on the efficacy of medications for the manage-
ment of BPD, and psychopharmacologic interventions
usually have nonspecific results.14 A 2011 meta-analysis
evaluated the effectiveness of medications in treating
impulsivity, aggression, depression, anxiety, anger, and
suicidal behavior in patients with BPD, and concluded the
following:
(1) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) can improve impulsivity and aggression but have
little effect on other symptoms; (2) mood stabilizers and
anticonvulsants have a moderate effect on depression and
can improve aggression and impulsivity; (3) first-genera-
tion antipsychotics can reduce anger and suicidal behavior
in patients with BPD but have little effect on psychosis
and anxiety; and (4) second-generation antipsychotics can
have an effect on aggression, but there are mixed results
for other symptoms.12 Benzodiazepine use by patients
with BPD has been greatly discouraged, as it may be
abused (ie, used to self-medicate intrapersonal issues) and
exacerbate BPD symptoms.12 Other research has sup-
ported this finding, as 87% of psychiatrists interviewed
cited medication misuse,
including overdose, as a
common problem among their BPD patients.15 Despite

Ment Health Clin [Internet]. 2016;6(2):62-7. DOI: 10.9740/mhc.2016.03.62

65

continued use of pharmacotherapy,
researchers have
concluded that conservative use should be considered
lethality of most medica-
best practice, given potential
tions, with the exception of SSRIs.14

There is some evidence that DBT is effective in lowering
psychotropic medication use in patients. One study
noticed significant decrease in psychotropic medication
use among college students with parasuicidal behaviors
following DBT treatment.16 One particular study focusing
on adolescent DBT during long-term inpatient therapy
also found a reduction in psychotropic medications
prescribed.17 However, there were no comparison group
results with which to run a statistical analysis on the
significance in the DBT group’s reduction in medication.
This is an area that deserves further consideration, given
the mixed evidence for medication effectiveness, medi-
cation side effects, and potential for misuse of psycho-
tropic medications.

There are several overall implications of medication in
the treatment of BPD. While medications may be helpful
for some comorbid psychiatric symptoms in patients
with BPD, their efficacy for treatment of BPD should not
be assumed.18 For example, research shows that SSRIs
may show improvement in depression or anxiety on a
variety of self-report measures in patients with BPD;
however, these measures are not designed to assess
changes in symptoms of BPD, as depression and anxiety
are comorbid issues.18 In addition, medications in BPD
often create more problems than they solve owing to the
potential for adverse side effects, addiction, and lethal
overdose.14 Therefore, it is recommended to use caution
when prescribing medications to this population. When
medications are prescribed, they should only be used in
conjunction with psychotherapy.19 In general, DBT is
first-line treatment for BPD and has been shown to
reduce the need for medications and medical care by up
to 90%.8,19

Conclusion

Although medications can provide adjunctive treatment in
patients with BPD and comorbid psychiatric symptoms,
DBT is currently the only empirically supported treatment
for BPD. For that reason, it is important that all patient
providers understand when a patient could potentially
in particular, have the
benefit from DBT. Pharmacists,
unique opportunity to speak to patients and providers in
both formal contexts (eg, medication management
appointments, medication reconciliation and education,
rounds) and informal
inpatient consultation, medical
contexts (eg, conversation while a patient pays for a
prescription, patient chart review in a medical setting).
Within these contexts, a patient provider may discover

behaviors consistent with those of BPD,
including
impulsivity, affective instability, interpersonal or intraper-
sonal conflict, parasuicidal behaviors, substance abuse
(alcohol, prescription drugs, or illicit drugs), or polyphar-
macy. If a pharmacist notices any of these symptoms, it
would be beneficial to provide the patient with a referral
to a local community mental health center for DBT in
addition to providing direct services such as assessing
current medication efficacy or safety concerns, reducing
unnecessary polypharmacy, and/or addressing prescrip-
tion drug abuse concerns.
