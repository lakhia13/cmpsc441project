Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a constellation of social deﬁcits and repetitive sensory-
motor behaviours. Aquatic therapy (AT) may be effective in improving the social interactions and
behaviours in children with ASD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an AT
program on social competence and quality of life and to understand participant’s experiences related
to the intervention by obtaining qualitative data. A mixed methods intervention study was conducted
among 6 children with ASD and their parents, with two research phases in a concurrent embedded
design (an aquatic intervention as the quantitative design and a qualitative design in second step).
The intervention and qualitative design followed international guidelines and were integrated into
the method and reporting subheadings. Signiﬁcant improvement was observed in the physical
competence (p = 0.026) and important improvements in school functioning and aquatic skills, with no
adverse events. Qualitative ﬁndings described: the meaning of AT intervention, patterns of behaviour
and activities changes, social communication and social interaction. The aquatic intervention showed
positive results for the social and physical competence, with elements of discordance, expansion, and
conﬁrmation between quantitative and qualitative results.

1. Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are multifactorial disorders of neurodevelopment
that appear in the early stages of life [1]. In 2018, it was estimated that the overall prevalence
of ASD among Spanish children was 15.5 per 1000 in preschoolers and 10 per 1000 in school-
age children [2]. They are diagnosed by a signiﬁcant impairment in social communication
and repetitive sensory and motor behaviours [1]. In addition to concerns about social
communication and behaviour, studies have addressed the fact that children with ASD
have great motor difﬁculties. Provost et al. noted that at least 60% of young children with
ASD could meet the criteria for early intervention by health professionals based on their
motor difﬁculties alone [3]. Motor problems reported in children with ASD include clumsy
gait, poor muscle tone, balance difﬁculties, poor motor control and manual dexterity, and
difﬁculties with praxis and movement planning [4,5]. McPhillips et al. concluded that
children with ASD are at risk for clinically signiﬁcant motor impairments [6].

Gernsbacher et al. showed that the acquisition of motor skills is relevant to everyday
skills such as language and communication, founding a strong association between early

oral and manual motor abilities and later speech ﬂuency [7]. Other authors stated that
motor skills are also related to emotional and social functioning [8,9], and the way children
play and interact [10]. Even walking problems and postural asymmetry have been shown
to have an effect on schooling and socialization of these children [11]. According to
Sutera et al., better motor control is associated with a decrease in the severity of non-
motor symptoms of autism in adulthood [12]. Overall, previous studies suggest that
the performance of motor skills in children with ASD may have signiﬁcant long-term
effects in counteracting the developmental cascade in the social, emotional and behavioural
domains [8,13,14] beyond just the acquisition of motor competence [15]. Kasari et al.
found that teaching functional motor abilities enables participation in social activities,
increasing opportunities for interaction and thus producing highly positive effects for other
problems [16].

Previous evidence suggest that the teaching of motor skills would encourage impor-
tant changes in behaviour (such as imitation, social attention, speech and communication).
Among the types of intervention identiﬁed to improve both motor skills and social be-
haviours is aquatic therapy (AT). AT is a therapeutic modality in an enriched environment,
with considerable advantages due to the water properties, such as hydrostatic pressure,
water temperature, viscosity, and buoyancy [17]. Based on the literature, AT appears to
be particularly beneﬁcial for children with ASD, who need strong sensory stimulation.
It involves vigorous movement in contact with and against water pressure, and the in-
tense sensory stimulation received may result in an overall calming effect and improve
the children’s ability to interact and communicate with others. Mortimer et al. in their
systematic review, point out that AT is a promising treatment method for social interactions
and behaviour, especially while using the Halliwick concept. The purpose of the Halliwick
concept is to apply a progressive program in particular, focusing on individuals with phys-
ical and/or learning difﬁculties, to participate in water activities, to move independently
in water, and to swim. It comprises four phases: mental adjustment to the water, rotations,
control of movement, and movement in the water [18]. Some authors speciﬁcally added
learning strategies to the Halliwick swimming intervention [19–22] with different feedback
chosen (continuous reinforcement, unique opportunity and social reinforcements). Few
studies reported improvements of water skills and water orientation [23–25]. In terms
of physical condition and social behaviour, statistically signiﬁcant differences were also
found with respect to the control groups [24–26]. Parental and children participation and
satisfaction were measured by Fragala-Pinkham, who reported high levels of satisfaction
with the aquatic program [23]. Mills et al. showed that AT may enhance behaviours im-
pacting mental health and well-being of children [27]. Quality of life was improved in the
sub-domains of physical function, emotional and social aspects, and school aspects [28]. In
all the interventions using learning strategies, the objectives were to achieve certain aquatic
skills or the performance of water games [19–22]. All studies described earlier [19–28] were
conducted solely on children with ASD, while Pan’s research was only one comparing
children with ASD with their siblings [25].

Experimental interventions using enriched environments for the treatment of diseases
should be analysed to determine their efﬁcacy and safety, as well as the experience, perspec-
tive and satisfaction of the users [29]. Both quantitative (e.g., intervention effectiveness)
and qualitative (patient acceptance or refusal of therapy) aspects need to be studied in
relation to the treatment approach in different intervention settings [30]. Mixed method
research combines the strengths of quantitative and qualitative research to gain a deeper un-
derstanding [31]. This methodology has previously been used in research involving health
services, such as program evaluation, implementation of innovative interventions [31],
clinical issues, and health care decision-making, including a supplementary qualitative
component within pilot studies of complex interventions [30]. Previous studies have de-
scribed the use of mixed methods in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (not
in ASD), combining analysis of the effects of experimental interventions with qualitative
research on the impact of various treatments [32,33].

The Qualitative Research in Trials (QUART) study [29] reported on how qualitative
health research had been used in trials and identiﬁed ways to maximize the value of a trial in
providing evidence of treatment efﬁcacy. QUART provided the way for using mixed studies
for qualitative analysis of a new intervention in efﬁcacy studies (quantitative component).
This approach determines whether an intervention is carried out as intended, describes the
implementation processes, generates an understanding of why the intervention worked or
failed, and demonstrates whether the effectiveness of the therapy is promoted or limited
in real-world situations. Similarly, new treatments must also be investigated under real
clinical conditions, where patients and their environment (away from the clinical setting)
do not necessarily adhere to ideal experimental criteria [34]. Qualitative analyses can be
conducted before, during or after the quantitative evaluation of the intervention [35]. Before
applying the treatment to larger samples, the study protocols should be progressively
tested to describe their efﬁcacy, safety, and patient acceptance [29]. These issues are
especially important in complex patients, such as children with ASD, who often have
multiple comorbidities, take multiple medications, and have varying levels of functional
impairment [36].

Therefore, the current study aimed to use a concurrent integrated design to investigate
the use of an AT intervention for children with ASD. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst study that attempts to describe the impact of AT intervention with learning
strategies on children with ASD using mixed methods, to evaluate the intervention from
clinical and parental perspectives. The study included both quantitative and qualitative
objectives. The objective of the quantitative design was twofold: to implement an AT
program, using learning strategies speciﬁcally designed by the research team for children
with ASD and to analyse its effects on perceived competence and social acceptance, aquatic
skills, and quality of life. The qualitative design objective was to explore and describe
the experiences regarding AT among parents of children with ASD, as well as to assess
emotions and to describe the polarity through parents’ narratives (acceptance or rejection)
of this way of treatment.

2. Materials and Methods

A mixed-method intervention study design with a qualitative component was ap-
plied. Within a concurrent integrated design [35], in the ﬁrst step of data analysis, the
quantitative methodology was used, while in the second step, qualitative methodology
was used. Qualitative data were collected after the AT intervention to elucidate possible
mechanisms and explain the quantitative results (participants’ experience, intervention-
related improvements, and possible facilitators and barriers) [35]. Table 1 summarizes
the methodology used in the research process. Quantitative and qualitative data were
integrated at the method level by embedding one into the other [35], and at the level of
interpretation and reporting through narrative and joint presentations [37]. Figure 1 shows
the design of the mixed methods and embedded integration.

The integration phase of the study elucidates the understanding of the relationships
between the quantitative and qualitative components [35]. The aim of this integration
phase is to balance the respective strengths and weaknesses of the methods to optimize the
performance of the various complementary sources of evidence [35].

In this study, we followed the Best Practices for Mixed Methods Research in the Health
Sciences from the National Institutes of Health [38] and the guidelines provided in Good
Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study [39]. The Template for Intervention Description and
Replication checklist (TIDieR) [40] was used in the quantitative intervention phase (see
Table S1).

We have followed the guidelines for qualitative studies established in the Standards for
Reporting Qualitative Research [41] and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative
Research [42]. In addition, we followed the criteria for ensuring the reliability of qualitative
research as proposed by Guba and Lincoln [43,44]. The various techniques performed and
the application procedures used to monitor reliability are described in Table S2.

2.1. Quantitative Intervention Phase Design

A non-randomized clinical intervention was conducted in the ﬁrst quantitative re-

search step, involving children with ASD.

2.1.1. Sampling and Participants

All patients were recruited from the Formato Integral Centre (Valencia, Spain) with a
non-probabilistic sampling of non-consecutive cases. The study participants had to meet the
following inclusion criteria: (a) age: 6–12 years; (b) medical diagnosis of Autism Spectrum
Disorder; (c) participation in continued treatment with AT for at least three months prior to
the beginning of the study (prescribed techniques need time to cause mental adjustment
and solid conﬁdence); (d) informed consent signed by the legal guardians. The exclusion
criteria were the coexistence of other disorders, including genetic disorders and psychiatric
conditions.

2.1.2. Intervention

The TIDieR checklist [40] was followed (Table S1). The Water Speciﬁc Therapy (WST)–
Halliwick sessions included four different phases in order to inﬂuence the internal processes
associated with distorted experiences and to lead to relatively permanent changes in the
capacity to perform activities [45]. These phases were (1) Entrance ritual: stimulating the
approach to the new environment. (2) Mental adjustment: controlling and dosing different
types of sensory inputs. (3) Learning phase: design of speciﬁc tasks using strategies that
support learning. (4) Exit ritual: calm down and make a connection with the transfer out of
the water.

WST sessions were carried out at the swimming pool of Formato Integral Centre dur-
ing individual AT sessions lasting 60 min twice a week over seven months, and provided
by the same physical therapist, who is specialist in AT. This WST intervention was part
of the intervention programs at the Formato Integral Centre. The main goal of this WST
intervention was to enhance the sensorimotor performance, cognitive potential, enjoyment
and social aspects among children and youth with ASD, as a feasible alternative to conven-
tional physical therapy. Various aquatic sensorimotor tasks with learning strategies were
used (Figure 2).

2.1.3. Data Collection and Outcome Measures

The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children
(PSPCSA) for the ﬁrst and second grades was administered to measure the perceived
competence and social acceptance. Psychometric properties of PSPCSA are considered
acceptable [46]. Twenty-four items in four subtests were analysed: cognitive competence;
peer acceptance; physical competence; maternal acceptance; with higher points meaning
higher level of competence or acceptance.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, x 5 of 18   We have followed the guidelines for qualitative studies established in the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research [41] and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qual-itative Research [42]. In addition, we followed the criteria for ensuring the reliability of qualitative research as proposed by Guba and Lincoln [43,44]. The various techniques per-formed and the application procedures used to monitor reliability are described in Table S2. 2.1. Quantitative Intervention Phase Design A non-randomized clinical intervention was conducted in the first quantitative re-search step, involving children with ASD. 2.1.1. Sampling and Participants All patients were recruited from the Formato Integral Centre (Valencia, Spain) with a non-probabilistic sampling of non-consecutive cases. The study participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (a) age: 6–12 years; (b) medical diagnosis of Autism Spec-trum Disorder; (c) participation in continued treatment with AT for at least three months prior to the beginning of the study (prescribed techniques need time to cause mental ad-justment and solid confidence); (d) informed consent signed by the legal guardians. The exclusion criteria were the coexistence of other disorders, including genetic disorders and psychiatric conditions. 2.1.2. Intervention The TIDieR checklist [40] was followed (Table S1). The Water Specific Therapy (WST)–Halliwick sessions included four different phases in order to influence the internal processes associated with distorted experiences and to lead to relatively permanent changes in the capacity to perform activities [45]. These phases were (1) Entrance ritual: stimulating the approach to the new environment. (2) Mental adjustment: controlling and dosing different types of sensory inputs. (3) Learning phase: design of specific tasks using strategies that support learning. (4) Exit ritual: calm down and make a connection with the transfer out of the water.

The main goal of this WST in-tervention was to enhance the sensorimotor performance, cognitive potential, enjoyment and social aspects among children and youth with ASD, as a feasible alternative to con-ventional physical therapy. Various aquatic sensorimotor tasks with learning strategies were used (Figure 2).  Figure 2. Example of visual prompting and attentional cues used in aquatic sensorimotor task. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3126

To assess the child’s ability to adapt to the aquatic environment and related functional
ability, the Water Orientation Test Alyn version 1 (WOTA 1) was administered. The WOTA
1 scale is reliable and valid for assessing mental adaptation and aquatic function in children
with disabilities [47]. This test consists of 15 items with a score from 0 to 3, depending on
the ability to perform the functional task in the aquatic environment.

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) parent-report (23-item version) was
administered to measure health-related quality of life. PedsQL has been shown to have
strong psychometric properties in a sample of individuals with developmental disabilities,
including individuals with ASD [48]. Four multidimensional scales were analysed: physical
health; emotional, social, and school functioning. The items in each of the dimensions are
scored from 0 to 4 according to the problems the child has had in his or her daily life and
the difﬁculty the child has had in the last month in carrying out the task in question. Zero
points are equivalent to no problem and 4 points mean problems almost always or the
partial inability to carry out such activity (extreme difﬁculty). Next, the items are reverse
scored and linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale (0–100, 1–75, 2–50, 3–25, 4–0), so that
higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.

All assessments were performed by the same physical therapist trained in the use of
the measurement instruments and not related to the intervention received by the subjects.
The outcome measures were administered at the beginning (pre) and at the end (post) of
the intervention.

2.1.4. Data Analysis

The statistical analysis of the data obtained was carried out using IBM SPSS Statis-
tics (version 21, Armonk, NY, USA). A descriptive analysis of the entire sample and
the study variables of the PSPCSA, WOTA1 and PedsQL scales included: mean, stan-
dard deviation, minimum and maximum. Due to lack of data normal distribution (the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and small sample size, non-parametric, statistical tests were
used. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for related samples was used to compare variables at
the beginning and at the end of intervention. Additionally, the effect size was determined
by calculating the r according to the formula presented by King et al. [49]. Values of
r > 0.50, >0.30 and >0.10 were typically considered to represent large, moderate, and small
meaningfulness of results, respectively. The statistical analysis was calculated with a 95%
conﬁdence level. A value of p < 0.05 was established to determine statistical signiﬁcance.

2.2. Qualitative Phase Design

We conducted a qualitative exploratory study [43,44].

2.2.1. Sampling and Participants

Purposeful sampling methods were used based on their relevance to the research ques-
tion rather than clinical representativeness [50]. All parents were recruited from the AT trial.
Recruitment took place when the patients completed their WST intervention in the swim-
ming pool at the Formato Integral Centre. Parents were included in the qualitative phase if
their child met the inclusion criteria of our study and agreed to participate. The sampling
process was based on the information power criteria established by Malterud et al. [51].
Information power indicates that the more information the sample has that is relevant to
the study, the fewer participants are needed. For this reason, the same participants who
were recruited for the intervention in the quantitative phase were included in qualitative
phase. No participants withdrew from the study.

2.2.2. Data Collection

Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews, based on a question guide,
designed to obtain information regarding speciﬁc topics of interest [43] (Table S3). The
question guide was developed based on a prior literature review [52,53] along with the
researchers’ experience [43]. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3126

7 of 17

Overall, 295 min of data collection was recorded. All interviews were held either at the
Formato Integral Centre or at the participants’ home, depending on parents’ preference.
Researcher ﬁeld notes were also collected for analysis. Field notes were used as a sec-
ondary source of information to provide more in-depth information and support the data
obtained from the interviews [43]. All parents were interviewed alone, and interviews
were conducted in the Spanish language.

2.2.3. Data Analysis

To analyse the participants’ experience an inductive thematic analysis was performed
on the collected data [43,50]. Complete and literal transcriptions were made from each
in-depth interview and the researchers’ ﬁeld notes [43,50]. The thematic analysis ap-
proach [43] involved identifying the most descriptive content in order to convert the data
into meaningful units and, subsequently, to reduce the data and identify the most com-
mon meaningful groups. In this manner, clusters of meaningful units were generated,
identifying similar points or content that allowed topics describing the study participants’
experience to emerge [43,50]. This thematic analysis procedure was conducted separately
with both the interviews and the ﬁeld notes. Joint meetings were held to combine the
results of the analysis as well as to discuss the data collection and analysis procedures. In
the event of differing opinions, theme identiﬁcation was performed based on a consensus
among the research team members. Subsequently, the research team held joint meetings to
combine, integrate, and identify ﬁnal themes.

For the qualitative content statistical analysis, the R Ver. 3.5.1. (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing, Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Welthandelsplatz 1, 1020 Vienna,
Austria) was used. The text of the interviews was lemmatized for the analysis. Sentiment
analysis was performed using the Bing [54], Aﬁnn and National Research Council Canada
(NRC) [55] dictionaries. Likewise, the polarity of the text was analysed using the Bing
dictionary, the Semantic Orientation Dictionaries Version 1.11 Spanish [56–58] dictionary
as ampliﬁers and decrementators, and those proposed by Vilares et al. [59] as deniers.

Content analysis has been used previously in the health sciences to study medical
and patient narratives [60,61]. Four phases were used progressively for the analysis of
acceptance-rejection (polarity). First, we created a ﬁle with the text of the interviews
broken down by phrases for textual analysis. Second, we calculated the polarity using
the Bing Sentiment Dictionary [54], the ampliﬁers and de-ampliﬁers from SO Dictionar-
iesV1.11Spa [56–58], and the negators proposed by Vilares et al. [59]. (Table S4). Third, we
calculated the scatterplot of the sentences in the text regarding neutrality to identify positive
or negative trends. Finally, the evolution of the emotional valence (positive–negative) was
presented throughout the interviews. We applied the Fourier transformation to conﬁrm
the polarity trend.

2.3. Ethical Considerations of the Mixed Methods Intervention

All subjects gave their informed consent regarding inclusion in the study, as well
as permission to record their interviews, prior to participating in the quantitative and
qualitative studies. The study was conducted in accordance with the WMA Declaration of
Helsinki [62], and the protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee at
the San Pablo-CEU University.

2.4. Integration Procedure (Embedded) for Quantitative and Qualitative Content

In the current study, quantitative and qualitative data were integrated at the method
level through embedding one within the other [63], and at the interpretation and reporting
level through narrative and joint displays [35,37] (Figure 1). Embedding at the method level
occurs in studies with both primary and secondary questions (objectives), when different
methods are employed to address each question. In the current study, the implementation
of data integration consisted of (a) analysing the primary data set to answer the primary
research question (quantitative-intervention), (b) analysing the secondary data set (quali-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3126

tative), which is embedded within the primary design, and incorporating the secondary
results, (c) interpreting how the primary (quantitative) and secondary (qualitative) results
answer the quantitative and qualitative questions, and (d) presenting the complete set of
ﬁndings [35]. Moreover, the narrative approach (contiguous), and joint displays (ﬁgures
and graphs) were used to interpret and present the ﬁndings [35,37]. A contiguous approach
to integration involves the presentation of ﬁndings within a single report, although the
quantitative and qualitative ﬁndings are reported in different sections. Integration through
joint displays brings the data into a visual medium that enables one to draw new insights
beyond what can be gained through the results of the separate quantitative and qualita-
tive methods; for these reasons, we organized the related data into ﬁgures, tables, and
graphs [37,64].

3. Results

The results are reported in the following order: (1) quantitative and intervention

results, (2) qualitative results, and (3) mixed method ﬁndings (integration) [63].

3.1. Quantitative Findings

The sample consisted of 6 participants (5 boys and 1 girl) of the 9 patients selected
at the beginning of the study. Three subjects were excluded from the study (2 refused
participation, and 1 did not return consent form). The mean age of the children receiving
WST intervention was 7.17 years (SD ± 1.60). The mean age of parents was 46.6 years
(SD ± 4.5) for fathers and 43 years (SD ± 3.7) for mothers. The levels of ASD severity
according to The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders-5 [65] were 1 (50%), 2 (16.7%), and 3 (33.3%). No session had to be
interrupted for safety reasons, and none of the children reported any adverse effects during
the sessions.

The PedsQL, PSPCSA, and WOTA 1 results (including descriptive statistics) from
the examination before and after the WST intervention are shown in Table 2. Using a
Wilcoxon test, the results of physical competence (the subtest of PSPCSA) were found to
be signiﬁcant (p = 0.026), and the effect size of the improvement was large (r = 0.64). Two
PSPCSA subtests (peer and maternal acceptance) did not indicate signiﬁcant improvement,
but the effect size of values increase was moderate (r > 0.3). Similarly, in 3 of 5 PedsQL
scales, the effect size of improvement was large (school functioning, r > 0.5) and moderate
(physical and psychosocial health, r > 0.3). Moreover, observed effect size of improvement
in aquatic functioning (WOTA 1) was large (r > 0.5).

3.2. Qualitative Findings
3.2.1. Results of the Thematic Analysis

We extracted the themes that represented the participants’ experiences through
analysing the collected qualitative data, which included interviews and researcher´s notes.
Three major themes representing parents’ experiences with WST intervention in children
with ASD were extracted from the interviews: (a) the meaning of AT; (b) patterns of
behaviour and activities changes, and (c) social communication and social interaction.

(a) The meaning of AT
All participants described AT as a beneﬁcial activity for their children, very much
directed towards movement and emphasized the value of it being done together with other
children. Parents found it a motivating activity for their children because they love the
water and see it as a game. However, they were all confused at the beginning, as they
thought it would also include the teaching of swimming.

“Aquatic therapy as it is a more directed thing because the movement is more . . . it has a
more concrete purpose . . . ”

(P3)

“Water is comfortable for him and he likes it . . . and then because he saw it and enjoyed
it as if it was a game (fun).”

(P4)

“An activity for children with problems and the ability to work with them in the aquatic
environment . . . many possibilities for many things, mainly teaching of swimming . . . ”

(P3)

(b) Patterns of behaviour and activities changes
This theme refers to the behavioural changes parents have observed in their children
in relation to the AT. All the participants agreed that on the days they go to the pool, the
children were more relaxed, happy, serene and calm, showing less insistence on ritualised
patterns. Three of the participants described having noticed changes in the routines
following AT, decreasing the frustration and being somewhat less inﬂexible to changes if
they occurred out of the pool.

“Pool day for him is . . . it changes his face . . . he is happy . . . he comes relaxed . . . very
comfortable, with less stereotyped movements.”

(P1)

None of the participants spontaneously reported changes in hyper/hyporeactivity to
sensory input or interests in the sensory aspects of the environment. Four participants
indicated that they had no problems with eating and report some improvement in activities
in the dressing room, such as their participation in dressing up, although they still needed
time and patience. Four participants reported that the teachers from the school have seen
improvements in terms of behaviour and the relationship with the other children, observing
less disruptive and aggressive behaviour.

“The teacher has told us that the tantrums and aggressive behaviour have decreased and
they last less and less time . . . ”

(P3)

(c) Social communication and social interaction
This theme describes the skills of the children with ASD on social approach with
family and peers, during or after the AT sessions. Three of the participants reported an
improvement in parent–child interaction. The remaining participants reported that nothing
had changed, and even two of them said that the interaction was still only related to the
needs of the children. Similarly, they expressed that the way they relate to their siblings is
still to play whatever they want according to their interests, and if this is not the case, they
tend to move away, and the deﬁcit in maintaining the play relationship persists. When
asked about playing with the peers, all the answers reﬂected that they usually do not
respond when a child proposes to play, or that they only do so if they like the game.

“In the water he tries to play more with us and tries something more with the other
children. He is more attentive and looks for them more often, but it is still only about his
speciﬁc interest, he still doesn’t approach them if they play something he doesn’t like.”

(P2)

Regarding the concept of verbal/non-verbal communication, four of the parents stated
that they had observed an improvement in non-verbal communication in their children,
which allowed them to maintain a certain emotional reciprocity by sharing affects and
emotions after the intervention. However, all agreed that with the children in the AT
group it is still difﬁcult to develop or maintain the relationship. None of the participants
spontaneously reported changes in verbal communication.

“He looks at us, he looks at us much more when we are in the water with him. He
keeps eye contact more often and for a longer time. That calmness helps him to continue
connecting with us afterwards, it gives us a certain feeling of connection.”

(P6)

3.2.2. Results of Emotions and the Acceptance-Rejection (Polarity) Analysis

The emotions analysis showed a predominance of positive emotions (Figure 3A,B) ex-
cept in the case of the Aﬁnn dictionary in which negative emotions predominate, especially
scores −1 and −2 (Figure 3C). The associated emotions are those of anticipation and trust,
followed by the feeling of sadness (Figure 3A).

The polarity of the interviews was 0.086 ± 0.403 which indicated a discrete trend
towards positive emotions due mainly to the presence of extreme positive values (Figure 4).

3.3. Mixed Method Findings (Integration)

The results of the integration showed elements of conﬁrmation, expansion, and dis-
cordance [37] (Table 3). Our conﬁrmation results demonstrated that the WST intervention
including learning strategies led to improvements in physical competence, peer and mater-
nal acceptance, aquatic skills and school functioning. These results were conﬁrmed through
the parents’ narratives, which described improvements in childrens’ social interactions
and communications post-treatment, at home and at school. Additionally, the content
of parents´ interviews reported a predominance of positive emotions and a polarity of
acceptance (positive) to the WST intervention.

Our results showed some discordance between quantitative and qualitative results.
While the quantitative results presented signiﬁcant improvement in physical competence,
from the parents’ perspective this effect was not relevant. In contrast, parents reported im-
provements in non-verbal communication, emotional reciprocity, and parent–child interaction.

4. Discussion

Our study showed positive results for the social and physical competence, with
elements of discordance, expansion, and conﬁrmation between quantitative and qualitative
results after the AT intervention. The results provided an expansion of knowledge in the
application of the intervention programs for children with ASD and included the parents’
perspective on the intervention. Mixed method design allowed to evaluate the intervention
from both clinical perspective and parents’ expectations. Such approach may increase
its impact on the functionality and socialisation of the child. Thus far, only few studies
have investigated the effect of AT on social interactions and behaviours of children with
ASD [24,25], or including learning strategies [19–22] to achieve certain swimming skills.
To our knowledge, no study has described the impact of WST intervention with learning
strategies on children with ASD using mixed methods.

Our results revealed statistically signiﬁcant increase of perceived physical compe-
tence and clinically signiﬁcant improvement in the social acceptance (composed of peer
and maternal acceptance). Chu and Pan’s studies showed improved social interactions
with peers, siblings, and therapists in all groups during group activity time [24,66]. In
both studies, the aquatic interventions were based on the Halliwick concept, resulting in
improvements in social interactions and behaviours. Chu and Pan suggested that these
improvements may be due to social interaction with peers or siblings, the structure of
the aquatic program, and the guidance of the AT instructor [66]. It may also be due to
the constant attention they received from the therapist and observations of positive social
interactions during the AT sessions [24], which was also noted in our study. In Chu and Pan
studies, follow-up monitoring showed that at 10 weeks after the intervention, the positive
effect was maintained [24,66]. Vonder Hulls revealed that the most potential beneﬁts of AT

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3126

13 of 17

included stimulation and vocalisation of language, improved tolerance of physical contact,
increased eye contact, and improved self-conﬁdence [67]. These beneﬁts can have holistic
effect on relationships with peers and siblings and greater social acceptance, also observed
in our study. Chu and Pan suggested that less physical contact with therapists does not
necessarily imply a negative outcome. It may improve positive interactions of a child with
ASD with the peers [66]. Vonder Hulls et al. presented consistent ﬁndings suggesting that a
decrease in asking for help from the therapists, by children with ASD, could be treated as a
sign that the child is gaining conﬁdence and independence in social interactions, similarly
to our results [67].

Learning strategies in our AT program mainly comprised task direction, consecutive
steps, prompting, and attentional cues included in the 4 phases of the WST. Among
the studies that implemented learning strategies to the aquatic intervention, three used
elements of the Halliwick concept (simple progression, water games, and lateral and
vertical rotation) [19–21] and one [22] used three swimming skills (kick, stroke, and head
turns to the side). Rogers’ et al. [22] proposed continuous reinforcement while Yilmaz’s
et al. used unique opportunity and social reinforcements, as a feedback during AT. Yilmaz
et al. found a decrease in stereotyped movements during the AT session [19,22]. Pan found
a decrease in antisocial behaviour and an increase in physical interaction with peers, as well
as in social interaction with the peers, the instructor, and another child with autism [24].
In the survey conducted by Volder Hulls et al., more than half of the parents conﬁrmed
a signiﬁcant increase in maintaining eye contact, concentration, and attention in their
children [67]. The present study supports such effect of the AT intervention on social
acceptance of children with ASD expressed in perceived peer and maternal acceptance.

We observed a clinically signiﬁcant increase in aquatic functioning after WST inter-
vention, which is in line with authors who showed that children with ASD increased their
aquatic skills [19]. Yilmaz et al. revealed improvements in the percentages of errors made
and in the total time spent on the achievement of the task. In addition, it was shown that
the participants maintained the gains obtained in the ﬁrst, second, and fourth week after
the intervention [19]. Other studies showed an increase in aquatic skills after interven-
tion together with the signiﬁcant improvement of swimming movements [24,66]. In our
study, the AT intervention was based on everyday movements (not swimming) included
in aquatic games, and therefore, clinically signiﬁcant improvement was observed only in
aquatic functioning.

The results of this study revealed that quality of life improved in the sub-domains
of health aspects and school aspects. Our ﬁndings in PedsQL scales showed clinically
important improvement in school functioning (large effect size) and in both physical and
psychosocial health (moderate effect size). Similarly, Ennis et al. demonstrated that there
was an improvement in total scores, social skills, school activities and emotional functioning
measured by the PedsQL even with a shorter duration program (10 weeks) than ours [28].
Lack of improvement in social and emotional functioning domains in our study may be
related to the appropriateness of the PedsQL for lower functioning children with ASD
discussed by Ikeda et al. [68].

Our qualitative results showed a discrete tendency of polarity towards positive emo-
tions with predominance of positive emotions regarding the meaning of AT, patterns of
behaviour and activities, and social interactions. Parents’ perception of children’s’ im-
provements in behavioural changes at the end of the sessions was consistent with previous
researches [19,24]. Children were calm and relaxed with a decrease in aggressive and
disruptive behaviour. These ﬁndings are in accordance with previous authors who found a
signiﬁcant decrease in the antisocial/aggressive and deﬁant/disruptive behaviours after
AT intervention [24]. Yilmaz et al. noted a decrease in stereotyped movements, such as
turning, rolling, and delayed echolalia. [19]. Additionally, our results identiﬁed improve-
ments in children’s social interactions and communication after treatment, both at home
and at school. It should be emphasised that parents highlighted the fun and motivating
character of the WST sessions. In all studies [19,24,28], parents noted that their children

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3126

14 of 17

had fun during therapy in water. None of the studies indicated a negative effect of AT on
children with ASD.

Further studies are needed to corroborate the effects of aquatic interventions and
to assess the transfer of social interaction outcomes to daily life. In addition, certain
requirements must be met during implementation to ensure that these treatments are more
effective, also considering the presence and needs of parents during sessions, as well as the
social relationships and strategies adopted. These results can inform the development of
future AT programs in hospital settings.

The current study has several limitations. The sample size was small, which may
demonstrate a lack of statistically signiﬁcant results, but still provide results with clinical
signiﬁcance. Large and moderate effect sizes obtained in our study for school functioning,
physical health, psychosocial health, peer acceptance, physical competence, mental accep-
tance, and aquatic functioning may be an indicator of future expectations of research results.
Nevertheless, future studies should be conducted with more participants. The results of
this study should be treated with caution and cannot be generalized to all children with
ASD. However, we do not consider this a signiﬁcant limitation because we used a mixed
methods (quantitative and qualitative) approach, with multiple strategies for data collec-
tion and analysis, to increase the trustworthiness and credibility of the ﬁndings [29,30,35].
Currently, the integration of qualitative and quantitative designs is recommended when
evaluating novel interventions for use in health sciences [29,30,35]. Further randomized
controlled trials will be required to compare our aquatic protocol with other conventional
approaches to learning and to verify our results.

5. Conclusions

The WST program, together with speciﬁcally designed learning strategies, represents
a novel intervention approach that could improve certain social interaction outcomes in
children with ASD. However, based on this unique methodology, elements of discordance,
extension, and conﬁrmation were identiﬁed between the qualitative and quantitative
results. It has to be highlighted that mixed method design with embedding quantitative
and qualitative data is new for the AT ﬁeld. Further studies are needed to corroborate the
effects of enriched environments intervention combined with conventional therapies for
the learning of children with ASD.

The present study has important implications and signiﬁcance for the development of
aquatic programs and interventions based on the use of WST along with learning strategies
among children with low-functioning ASD, promoting behavioural changes as the most
important outcomes. Our results may help healthcare professionals to better understand
children receiving aquatic treatment. The presence of parents during the sessions is an
added value for the transfer of children’s learning out of the pool.
