version of IAPT: clinical outcomes and
predictors of change in a multicenter
cohort study

Abstract
Background: Prompt mental health care (PMHC) is a Norwegian initiative, inspired by the English ‘Improving
Access to Psychological Therapy’ (IAPT), aimed to provide low-threshold access to primary care treatment for
persons with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The objectives of the present study are to describe the PMHC
service, to examine changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression following treatment and to identify predictors
of change, using data from the 12 first pilot sites.
Methods: A prospective cohort design was used. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at
baseline, before each treatment session and at the end of treatment. Effect sizes (ES) for pre-post changes and
recovery rates were calculated based on the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder
scale. Multiple imputation (MI) was used in order to handle missing data. We examined predictors through latent
difference score models and reported the contribution of each predictor level in terms of ES.
Results: In total, N = 2512 clients received treatment at PMHC between October 2014 and December 2016, whereof
61% consented to participate. The changes from pre- to post-treatment were large for symptoms of both depression
(ES = 1.1) and anxiety (ES = 1.0), with an MI-based reliable recovery rate of 58%. The reliable recovery rate comparable
to IAPT based on last-observation-carried-forward was 48%. The strongest predictors for less improvement were having
immigrant background (ES change depression − 0.27, ES change anxiety − 0.26), being out of work at baseline (ES
change depression − 0.18, ES change anxiety − 0.35), taking antidepressants (ES change anxiety − 0.36) and reporting
bullying as cause of problems (ES change depression − 0.29). Taking sleep medication did on the other hand predict
more improvement (ES change depression 0.23, ES change anxiety 0.45).

Conclusions: Results in terms of clinical outcomes were promising, compared to both the IAPT pilots and other
benchmark samples. Though all groups of clients showed substantial improvements, having immigrant background,
being out of work, taking antidepressant medication and reporting bullying as cause stood out as predictors of poorer
treatment response. Altogether, PMHC was successfully implemented in Norway. Areas for improvement of the service
are discussed.

Background
In Norway, anxiety and depression occupy the 8th and 9th
positions among the most common causes of burden of
disease [1]. However, access to mental health care services
for persons with anxiety and depression is limited, and the
treatment gap in Norway [2], as in many other European
countries [3–5], is estimated to be over 50% for these
disorders. In addition, though clients have a three-fold
preference for psychological versus pharmacological treat-
ment [6, 7], the latter is most often prescribed. The
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD) has urged Norway to address these weak-
nesses in care provision,
in particular concerning the
treatment of clients with mild to moderate anxiety and
depression [3]. Currently, this group of clients is to a large
degree dependent on care available from general practi-
tioners (GPs).

In order to address the treatment gap, the UK govern-
ment in 2007 announced the innovative, large-scale ini-
tiative “Improving Access to Psychological Therapy”
(IAPT). In short, the initiative included an expansive
training of new therapists to offer evidence-based psy-
chological therapies as recommended by the National
Institute of Clinical Evidence (NICE), organized consistent
with a stepped care model. The scale-up was argued to be
cost-effective by reducing welfare costs and increasing
productivity [8, 9]. Following promising results from pilot
studies [10, 11], the IAPT program was broadly rolled out
in England in 2010. The program is continuously moni-
tored, and the latest annual report found an average recov-
ery rate of 49.3% and reliable recovery rate of 47.0% [12].

As each health care system is different, it is vital to
illuminate whether large-scale implementation of the
program is viable also in other countries. Thus far, the
success of the IAPT initiative has encouraged replica-
tions in New Zealand and Australia. The Australian
adaptation is evaluated finding promising results [13].

Prompt Mental Health Care (PMHC; “Rask Psykisk
Helsehjelp” in Norwegian) service,
is the Norwegian
adaptation of IAPT. The Norwegian Ministry of Health
and Care Services initiated PMHC as a pilot project at
12 sites in 2012, with the aim to increase access to
evidence-based primary care treatment for adults with
mild to moderate anxiety and depression [14]. As previ-
ously described [15], PMHC and IAPT share key charac-
low-threshold
teristics by offering a free of charge,
service, aiming for short waiting times, and allowing for
access without referral from the GP. In PMHC cognitive
behavioural therapy (CBT) is provided, both as low-
(guided self-help and group-based psychoeducation) and
high-intensity (face-to-face) treatment. PMHC is orga-
nized according to a so-called matched-care model, in
which information from the initial assessment and client
preferences is used to determine the choice of treatment.

This indicates, different from the stepped care model
used in IAPT, that the client does not necessarily start
with low-intensity treatment [16]. So far, PMHC has
been established at 49 sites in municipalities and bor-
oughs throughout Norway.

PMHC is evaluated using the same main outcome
measures as in IAPT, more specifically the Patient
Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9, [17])
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7,
[18]), to allow for cross-country comparisons. Initial re-
sults, presented in a research letter in “Psychotherapy
and Psychosomatics” [15], show a recovery rate of 57%,
reliable recovery rate of 52% and promising effect sizes
(0.8–1.2) for pre-post improvement in symptoms of both
anxiety and depression among the 12 first pilot sites.

The current paper will provide a more elaborate de-
scription of the PMHC service and show updated clin-
ical outcomes based on a larger sample of PMHC users.
In addition to provide updated effect sizes and recovery
rates, the current paper will report predictors of clinical
improvement from pre- to posttreatment. Though the
effect of CBT is widely demonstrated [19–22], we need
to know whether a large-scale implementation of this
novel treatment model, focusing on low-intensity care
delivered by multidisciplinary teams, is appropriate for
clients with different socio-demographic backgrounds
and clinical characteristics. In general, a vast number of
studies have investigated factors predicting treatment
response of CBT for anxiety and depression, however
notably few consistent predictors are identified [23–25].
Pre-treatment severity is one of the most frequently re-
ported predictor of poorer treatment outcome [19, 26],
though its impact on degree of improvement is less clear
[25, 27]. Among IAPT clients, disability, unemployment,
younger age and functional
impairment were associ-
ated with persistence of depression symptoms, and
co-morbid depression and low outcome expectancy
with persistence of anxiety symptoms after treatment
[28]. Personality difficulties are found associated with
less improvement in IAPT [29].

The lack of consistency with regard to predictors of
treatment response mentioned above may partly be
explained by the variation in analytic strategies. It is
known that using categorical outcomes versus continu-
ous outcomes and/or simple gain scores versus residua-
scores can influence findings. More
lized changes
importantly, the bulk of evidence emerge from compar-
ably small trials in controlled settings, which often have
strict inclusion criteria and insufficient power to exam-
ine treatment effects across groups [25]. Predictor stud-
ies from routine care, large-scale implementations may
therefore be of interest as these both ensure sufficient
statistical power and increase the generalizability of find-
ings. On the downside, the latter type of studies are

Knapstad et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:260

typically based on single-group observational study de-
signs, which by nature complicates causal inference. Use
of simple gain scores provide unbiased estimates of dif-
ferential treatment effects if the assumption of a stable
base rate in the control group holds [30, 31]. In the ab-
sence of a control group, it is impossible to test this as-
sumption. However,
there is evidence from previous
studies that clients in waitlist control conditions with a
prior duration of clinically significant anxiety and/or de-
pression for six months or over tend to report low to
very low recovery rates (5–20%) [32–34]. Therefore, in
PMHC clients with a prior duration of 6 months or
more, it may be reasonable to assume that depression
and anxiety scores would continue to be relatively stable
without any form of treatment [10]. As such, analyses
based on simple gain scores in this subgroup of clients
may point to differential treatment effects of relevant
demographic factors and clinical characteristics.

In summary, the present paper extends findings from
a report in Norwegian [35] and a research letter in ‘Psy-
chotherapy and Psychosomatics’
the
following objectives: 1) To describe the general charac-
teristics of PMHC. 2) To elaborate on the main findings
with regard to effect sizes of clinical improvement and
recovery rates from pre- to post- treatment. 3) To exam-
ine the predictive value of a range of baseline character-
istics for treatment response. Merged data from the first
12 pilot sites will be employed for all analyses.

Methods
Pilot sample
The first 12 PMHC pilot sites were established in 2012–
2013. The sites were distributed across several geograph-
ical areas in eastern, western and central Norway,
including both urban and rural areas. Nine of
the
pilot sites were located in individual municipalities (Fjell,
Hurum, Kristiansund, Lørenskog, Modum, Molde, Notod-
den, Orkdal and Stjørdal), one through inter-municipal co-
operation (Fosen DM IKS) and two covered boroughs in
the Oslo municipality (Frogner and Søndre Nordstrand).
The population size varied from 11,722 in rural Orkdal to
55,965 in urban Oslo Frogner. The demographic profiles of
the pilot sites displayed notable differences as well. For
example, the proportion of inhabitants with an immigration
background varied from 5.8% in Fosen DM IKS to 52.2% in
Oslo Søndre Nordstrand and the proportion of persons on
permanent disability pension varied from 4.5% in Oslo
Frogner to 14.4% in Notodden [35].

The PMHC teams had on average four full-time equiv-
alents independent of the catchment area population
size. All teams were multidisciplinary and had at least
one clinical psychologist who carried the professional re-
sponsibility for the services provided. All therapists had

a minimum of three years with relevant higher education
and completed an additional, mandatory one-year train-
ing in cognitive behavioural therapy under the auspices
of the Norwegian Association for Cognitive Therapy.
The curriculum was based on IAPT, but adjusted to the
Norwegian context. It included 208 h of tutoring and
96 h of supervision from clinical psychologists,
in
addition to peer supervision. All therapists had individ-
ual treatment responsibilities.

Procedures
All clients contacting PMHC participated in an initial
assessment. During this session, information about the
content and treatment methodology within PMHC was
provided, and the therapist assessed relevant information
to decide whether PMHC could be the appropriate treat-
ment or not. The therapist identified the relevance and
severity of the mental problems, and the available client
resources.

Treatment inclusion criteria
Inhabitant of the pilot site community, ≥18 years of age,
anxiety disorder and/or mild to moderate symptoms of
depression (formal diagnosis not provided).

Treatment exclusion criteria
Clients with history or clear indications of psychosis, bi-
polar disorder, personality disorder, severe drug abuse,
and suicide risk were generally excluded from PMHC,
and were referred to the GP or secondary health care
services.

Participation was based on opt-in, where clients who
were suitable for treatment were informed about the
study,
invited to participate and asked to sign an
informed consent. The participants were asked to
complete questionnaires before the first
treatment
session, before each session during the treatment, and at
post-treatment. In more than 97% of the cases, partici-
pants completed the questionnaires electronically. For
each participant, the therapists (n = 68) were asked to
complete a questionnaire at post-treatment about the
therapy process.

The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Com-

mittee for Western Norway (REK-vest no. 2014/597).

Participants
As displayed in Fig. 1, 2512 clients started treatment at
PMHC between October 2014 and December 2016. This
number varied between 88 in Stjørdal and 395 in
Lørenskog [35]. Of those who started treatment, 1532
(61%) signed informed consent. The study participation
rate varied between 27.7% in Orkdal to 79.3% in Oslo
Frogner. In 8 out of 12 pilot sites, the participation rate
was over 60%. Of the 1532 participating clients, 1297

had attended at least two sessions. Number of sessions
does not include initial assessment since the clients were
included in the study after this session.

Missing data
Missing data rates at baseline were generally low (< 5%)
with exception of weight (10.2%), antidepressant medica-
tion (11.9%), anxiolytic medication (10.4%), sleep medica-
tion (10.4%), and life events (10.2%). For the overall
sample, 21.3% of the cases did not have any follow-up as-
sessment, while post-treatment scores for PHQ and GAD
were missing for 43.6% of the cases. For the sample who
attended at least two sessions, 7.2% of the participants did

not have a follow-up assessment, while post-treatment
scores for PHQ and GAD were missing for 33.2% of the
participants. In both groups, missing data for PHQ and
GAD at post-treatment were associated with being youn-
ger, higher mean scores for the last observed score on
PHQ and GAD while under treatment, and the following
self-reported causes of current mental health problems:
difficult childhood and having been bullied (all p < .05).
Missingness in the overall sample was also associated with
low educational level, being a smoker, and the following
self-reported causes of current mental health problems:
romantic relationship problems and family relationship
problems (all p < .05). This may suggest that missing data

Knapstad et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:260

at post-treatment were (partly) “missing at random”
(MAR) [36]. It should also be noted that 25.0% of the vari-
ance in missing scores at final treatment was explained at
the therapist level, while this was the case for less than 3%
of the variance in PHQ/GAD changes scores. With the ex-
ception of the “under treatment” PHQ/GAD data, the
other missing data correlates were only weakly associated
with PHQ/GAD at post-treatment. This implies that omit-
ting these variables from the (missing) data analysis model
would not bias PHQ/GAD estimates at post-treatment. It
is nonetheless likely that in these types of settings part of
the missing data is “missing not at random” (MNAR) as
well [36]. Nonresponse for some participants may be more
likely because of the actual (but unobserved) PHQ/GAD
scores at post-treatment, which is conceivable for both
those who are not improving and those recovering. The
bias introduced by MNAR can partly be eliminated by in-
cluding strong correlates of variables with missing data. In
the present study, there was a relatively strong relationship
between the observed PHQ and GAD scores
at
post-treatment and respectively baseline PHQ and GAD
scores (r ≈ .4) and the last observed scores on PHQ and
GAD while under treatment (r ≈ .6). Finally, some of the
missing data may also be “missing completely at random”
(MCAR) [36]. Information from the therapists indicated
that missing questionnaires were often due to lack of time
or the result of participants forgetting to complete the
questionnaire.

Measures
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to
measure depressive symptoms [17]. It includes nine items
based on each of the DSM-IV criteria for depression, with
response categories range from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly
every day”). This yielded a total sum score that ranged
from 0 to 27. The PHQ has good psychometric properties
[17]. Cronbach’s alpha based on PMHC data was 0.85.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)
was used to measure symptoms of anxiety disorder [18]. It
includes seven items to score common anxiety symptoms
ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Total
score could range from 0 to 21. In addition to measuring
generalized anxiety disorder, there are indications that the
GAD-7 also has good sensitivity and specificity for panic,
social anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder [18].
Cronbach’s alpha based on PMHC data was 0.87.

Participants were defined as caseness when scoring

PHQ ≥ 10 and/or GAD ≥8.

The following self-reported baseline characteristics

were included as potential predictors of change:

Socio-demographic factors
Gender, age, educational level (primary school, second-
ary school, higher education), marital status (having a

partner, not having a partner), immigration background
(defined as being an immigrant or born in Norway with
immigrant parents). Employment status was assessed by
means of two questions, one multi-response item about
employment status, and one multi-response item about
sources of income [35]. Based on these two questions,
participants were placed into three categories: 1) In
regular work, 2) In combined work and a recipient of
benefits (graded sick leave, disability, unemployment or
other benefits), and 3) Out of work with or without ben-
efits. A similar categorization has been used in another
Norwegian treatment study [37].

Life style and social factors
Physical activity (days per week), BMI, smoking (yes, no),
alcohol use (2–3 times a week or more, less than 2–3
times per week).

Social support was assessed using the Oslo 3-items so-
cial support scale (OSS-3) [38]. The items cover number
of close confidants, the sense of concern or interest
shown by others and perceived availability of practical
help from neighbors. Due to the relatively low internal
consistency and the subjective nature of the items in the
PMHC data (Cronbach’s alpha = .64), social support was
modelled as a latent variable.

Life-events were measured by means of the Life-events
scale [39], which screens for 24 specific life-events that the
participant is asked to rate the impact of from − 3 (very
negative) to 3 (very positive). A sum-score for the total
impact of life-events was made by merging the impact of
negative and positive events.

Other relevant factors
Duration of psychological problems prior to the initial
(< 6 months, ≥6 months),
referral

health personnel), previous
attempts by

psychologist or psychiatrist last 12 months (yes, no), use
of antidepressant medication (every day, less than every
day), use of anxiolytic medication (every week, less than
every week), use of sleep medication (every week, less
than every week), perceived cause of symptoms (rela-
tionship problems, family relationship problems, school/
job related, difficult childhood and/or bullying: yes, no).

Number of sessions and length of treatment (log--
transformed due to positive skewness) were included in
sensitivity analyses as predictors of change in the multi-
variate predictor model, to examine their impact on the
predictive values of the baseline variables.

Statistical analyses
Basic descriptive analyses were carried out using Stata
Version 15.0. All other analyses were conducted in
Mplus Version 8. For all analyses in Mplus, type = com-
plex was used to account for clustering within pilot sites.

Knapstad et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2018) 18:260

Multiple imputation (MI) was used to handle missing
data in predictor and outcome variables. All predictor
variables mentioned above, the variables containing the
last available PHQ and GAD scores during treatment,
and the post-treatment variables for PHQ and GAD
were included in the imputation model. The multiple
imputation procedure in Mplus was used to generate 20
imputed datasets. MI is valid under the MAR assump-
tion and is generally preferred over more traditional
methods for dealing with missing data.

For observed sum scores, empty means models with
an unstructured R-matrix were used to estimate
means at pre- and post-treatment in symptoms of de-
pression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Unadjusted
effect sizes were calculated by dividing the mean dif-
ference
at
pre-treatment (Cohen’s d) using the model constraints

In addition to observed sum scores, we also reported
the results from multiple indicators latent difference
score models [40]. The advantage over the more trad-
itional approach based on observed sum scores is that
latent difference scores reflect meaningful differences
rather than differences that (partly) result from measure-
ment error, and reduces regression to the mean ef-
fects. As a first step, measurement invariance across
time (i.e. pre-post) was tested for PHQ-9 and GAD-7
(MLR estimator, continuous indicators). The config-
ural model yielded an acceptable fit for both PHQ-9
(RMSEA = .06, CFI = .94) and GAD-7 (RMSEA = .06,
CFI = .97). Changes in model fit were minimal when

Recovery rates were calculated based on observed sum
scores. Recovery was defined as scoring above the case-
ness threshold on the PHQ-9 (≥ 10) and/or GAD-7 (≥ 8)
measures at the start of treatment and below the case-
ness threshold on both these measures at the end of the
treatment. Reliable recovery rate was calculated in order
to account for measurement error, aligning with the pro-
cedures employed for the IAPT evaluations [41]. Using
the standard deviation of the sample and Cronbach’s
alpha for PHQ and GAD, a reliable change score of ≥6
was derived for PHQ and ≥ 5 for GAD.

The predictor analyses were performed in the sample
that had completed at least two sessions and reported
having problems at least six months prior to treatment
(n = 1059). The latter restriction was chosen to limit the
impact of natural recovery or regression to the mean ef-
fects, which may be less pronounced for longer-lasting
problems [32–34]. Predictors were examined through
multiple indicator latent difference score models and the
contribution of each predictor level was expressed in
terms of ES. The predictors were first examined separ-
ately. Those predicting change at an ES level of ≥0.1
were included in a multivariate model.

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristic of participants
Compared to the population statistics of the PMHC
catchment areas [42], males (25.5%), older individuals (>
67 years = 1.2%), those with lower education (10.2%),
and immigrant background (11.3%) were underrepre-
sented among study participants (Table 1). This pattern
was observed across all pilot sites. The subgroups who

symptoms
≥6 months were in large similar to the overall sample
(Table 1), except those having at least two sessions were
somewhat higher educated and fewer were out of work
(p < 0.001). The proportion of participants with problem
duration of six months or longer prior to the initial as-
sessment was 84.3%. In all pilot sites, this proportion
was above 75.0%. Mean baseline scores for PHQ-9 were
12.5 (SD = 5.7) and for GAD-7 10.1 (SD = 5.0). Split by
urban and rural sites, baseline GAD-7 score were slightly
higher at the urban (10.5 (SD5.0)) than at the rural sites
(mean 9.9 (SD 5.0) (t = − 2.2, df = 1514, p = 0.032). There
were, however, no difference in neither baseline PHQ-9
score nor percentages of participants with PHQ-9 or
GAD-7 scores that can be classified as severe (i.e. ≥29
for PHQ-9 and ≥ 15 for GAD). Using the pre-defined
cut-offs for PHQ and GAD, 77.2% of the participants
could be identified as being at caseness at pre-treatment.
The variation across pilot sites with regard to the per-
centage of caseness at pre-treatment varied between
70.1% (Fosen DM IKS) and 83.2% (Notodden). In 45.2%

of the cases, the therapists registered depression as the
primary provisional diagnosis, 21.5% were registered for
a specific anxiety disorder, and in 20.2% of the cases
mixed depression and anxiety was indicated (see also
Table 2).

Treatment characteristics of PMHC
As reported by the therapists, just above half of the partic-
ipants were referred by GPs or other health personnel
(57.0%), the rest were self-referrals (Table 2). Self-referral
was less common among participants with immigrant
background (32.3%, OR = 0.59 (95% CI 0.40–0.89)) and
those in combined work and a recipient of benefits
(38.7%, OR = 0.73 (95% CI 0.56–0.96)). No other signifi-
cant associations were identified between type of referral
and the pre-treatment characteristics (Table 1). This may
suggest that self-referral did not contribute to increased
participation of the underrepresented groups mentioned
above. Those referred by health personnel had slightly

higher mean PHQ-9 score at baseline (12.9 (SD = 5.67))
than the self-referrals (11.6 (SD = 5.3)) (t = 4.0, df = 1147,
p < 0.001).

Median waiting time was 10.0 days between initial
contact and assessment, and 22.0 days between initial
contact and first treatment session. Waiting times varied
considerably across pilot sites, with 8 days in Notodden
and 48.0 days in Lørenskog between initial contact and
first treatment session. The median treatment duration
was 11.1 weeks and the median number of attended ses-
sions was 6.0.

Based on the total number of registered sessions after
the initial assessment, the majority of sessions were used
on face-to-face treatment (71.3%). Moreover, 76.6% of
the participants received at least one face-to-face session
during the course of treatment. Guided self-help (8.3%
of sessions) and group course psychoeducation (16.5% of
sessions) were used less frequently (Table 2), although
there were large variations across pilot sites [35]. Pilot

technique). In the latter, the ESs were still in the upper
moderate range.

More specifically, in the sample that attended at least
two sessions and using MI to handle missing outcome
data, the ES of the average observed change scores (pre
minus post) were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.16) for PHQ and
1.03 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.10) for GAD. Employing latent
variable change score models, which exclude measure-
ment error, the ESs were 1.20 for symptoms of depres-
sion and 1.13 for symptoms of anxiety.

Approximately the same estimates were found in both
the ITT sample using MI and among those who com-
pleted both the pre- and post-treatment questionnaire,
as the observed scores from the primary analysis. To set

aMI Multiple Imputation, LOCF Last Observation Carried Forward

a lower bound of effect, sensitivity analyses using LOCF
missing data technique gave observed change scores of
ES = 0.88 and 0.74 for PHQ and 0.83 and 0.71 for GAD
in the sample attended at least two sessions and the ITT
sample, respectively.

Looking at those meeting criteria for caseness only,
the ESs of improvement were markedly larger (1.53 for
observed PHQ /1.79 latent PHQ score and 1.41 for ob-
served GAD/1.62 latent GAD score). Restricting the ana-
lyses
to participants with problem duration of >
6 months hardly changed the ES estimates.

The recovery rate was 65 (95% CI: 61%, 69%) and reli-
able recovery rate 58% (95% CI: 54%, 61%) in the sample
that completed at least two sessions, using MI. Again,
these estimates were quite similar to the results for the
ITT sample using MI (64% and 57%) and for those who
competed both the pre- and post-treatment question-
naires (69% and 62%). In the ITT sample when using
LOCF (most conservative estimate), the recovery rate
was 46% and reliable recovery rate 41%. The comparable
IAPT estimates (LOCF and at least two sessions) were
respectively 57% and 48%.

A sensitivity analysis showed that only 2.2% (n = 10) of
the clients defined as pre-treatment caseness changed
less than three points on the PHQ and/or GAD scales
from pre- to post-treatment. The same was true for
those having at least two sessions.

Baseline predictors of change
Table 4 details the baseline characteristics that signifi-
cantly predicted reliable change in latent depression
and/or anxiety score from pre- to post-treatment (p <
0.05 and ES ≥ 0.1). The contribution of each predictor
level is reported in terms of ES (95%CI), where negative
numbers equals less improvement and positive more im-
provement on latent symptom scores. As mentioned in
clustering within
the
pilot-sites is accounted for by using the Mplus function
type = complex. For completeness, the impact of site on
PHQ and GAD changes scores is determined by calcu-
lating intraclass correlations. These were 0.014 for PHQ
and 0.012 for GAD, suggesting that little variation in
change scores was explained by site.
The strongest predictors of

less improvement on
latent symptoms scores were taking antidepressant
medication (ES change anxiety − 0.36), being out of
work at baseline (ES change depression − 0.18 and ES
change anxiety − 0.35), reporting bullying as cause of
problems (ES change depression − 0.29), and immi-
grant background (ES change depression PHQ − 0.27
and ES change anxiety − 0.26), (adjusted estimates).
In combination with elevated baseline scores,
these
observations may indicate that the treatment was less
effective for these groups.

Taking sleep medication did on the other hand predict
more improvement (ES change depression 0.23 and ES
change anxiety 0.45, adjusted). Given that we use latent
scores and examine a group in which natural recovery is
less likely,
indicate that combining sleep
medication and CBT can increase treatment effects.

this might

Some factors predicted less improvement (self-referral,
physical activity) and some more improvement (Job/
school-related problems, living alone, relationship prob-
lems) with small, adjusted effect sizes only (Table 4).
Seen together with deviant latent baseline scores, in re-
spectively the same directions as for the change scores,
regression to the mean might be an important alterna-
tive explanation for these predictors.

A sensitivity analysis,

including treatment duration
and number of sessions, respectively, in the multivariate
predictor models, slightly reduced the predictive power
of some of the predictors and increased others (ES ±
0.01–0.05, details not shown). Accounting for treatment
duration and number of sessions did however not
change any conclusions.

The remaining baseline characteristics did not predict
change in neither latent depression nor anxiety scores.
Accordingly, the lower educated showed similar degree
of improvement as the higher educated, though notably
reporting higher symptom severity both at pre and
post treatment (ES baseline score depression 0.42 and
anxiety 0.23). The same pattern was found for those
reporting difficult childhood experiences as cause of
symptoms
(ES baseline score depression 0.27 and
anxiety 0.43), whereas the opposite was found for
level of social support (ES baseline score depression
− 0.47 and anxiety − 0.21).

Discussion
Main findings
Overall, the results from the 12 first pilot sites of PMHC
in Norway indicate that the service was successfully im-
plemented. The clinical results of PMHC were promis-
ing as indicated by the large improvements from pre- to
post-treatment for symptoms of both depression and
anxiety. However, some groups of clients showed less
improvement during treatment than others, most not-
able those having immigrant background, being out of
work at baseline, taking antidepressant medicine and
reporting bullying as cause of problems. Regarding im-
plementation, key positive features of PMHC were short
waiting times and short treatment duration, and that al-
most half of the participants chose to contact PMHC
directly without GP referral. All of this was in line with
the guidelines set out by the Norwegian Directorate of
Health [14]. Despite the low-threshold features, some
groups were under-represented among the clients,
namely males, older individuals (> 67 years), those with

lower education, and immigrants. Aligning with what is
reported from IAPT [10], the majority of participants
that contacted PMHC had been struggling with similar
psychological problems for a period longer than six months
prior to the initial contact, suggesting that there is an ur-
gent need for a service like PMHC.

Interpretation of clinical outcomes
The effect sizes for PMHC were comparable to those
found in the first IAPT pilot sites [10, 11]. Using the
same analytic approach (e.g. attending at least two ses-
sions and using LOCF missing data technique) the pre
to post effect sizes for PHQ and GAD were respectively
0.9 and 0.8 in PMHC and 1.0–1.2 and 1.1–1.2 in the first
two pilots in IAPT. Also in terms of recovery rates, the
estimates were solid, comfortably exceeding the 50% re-
covery target used in IAPT, similar to the overall IAPT
recovery rate [11], and far beyond the 5–20% natural re-
covery found among wait-list control clients with
pre-treatment duration of above six months [32–34]. As
previously discussed [15], direct comparison with IAPT
is difficult. Most important, the lower PHQ and GAD
pre-treatment mean scores at PMHC make it easier to
fall below the cutoff value for recovery during the course
of treatment. Whereas 77% of the PMHC participants
were classified as a clinical case at the start of treatment,
the number was 92.4% in the latest annual report [12].
In part, this may be because the baseline questionnaire
was completed prior to the first treatment sessions and
not during the initial assessment. Some clients might
therefore already have started an improvement process
[43], leading to an underestimation of change scores for
PMHC. On the other hand, our definition of “at least
two sessions” do not include the initial assessment. This
may slightly overestimate the change scores reported in
the current study, when comparing to the IAPT results.
Finally, the relatively low study participation rate and
more missing outcome data in the PMHC sample may
introduce nonparticipation bias. Due to all the uncer-
tainties hampering the use of benchmarks from other
clinical populations, the initiated randomized controlled

more precisely the effect attributable to the treatment
provided at PMHC.

Predictors of change
Regarding the predictors, both demographic (marital sta-
tus, ethnicity, job status), life style (physical activity) and
clinical (medication, perceived cause of symptoms) char-
acteristics contributed in explaining variations in degree
of clinical improvement, with small to moderate effect
sizes. First, it is worth noting that the improvement was
substantial across all groups, as indicated by effect sizes

> 0.8 when subtracting the predictor levels from the
intercept levels of change. By study design it is difficult
to fully disentangle the extent these variations in im-
provement reflects the differences in response to treat-
ment from regression to the mean effects. The effect of
natural recovery was presumably reduced by restricting
the analyses to those having long-lasting conditions [32–
34], and measurement error was excluded by employing
latent variables. Regression to the mean can however
not be ruled out as a (partly) alternative explanation of
the predictors that showed elevated pre-treatment scores
in combination with small deviances in change scores
(living alone, intimate partner relation problems, school/
job related problems).

Having immigrant background, being out of work, ex-
periencing bullying as cause of problems and daily tak-
ing antidepressant medications nonetheless stood out as
probable predictors of poorer treatment response. These
were all associated with less improvement in symptom
scores, most of them with moderate effect sizes while also
being associated with higher baseline scores. The first
three all represent “structural” factors or problems, which
are more or less out of control of the client. A conceivable
interpretation is thus that the individual-focused treat-
ment provided through CBT, not sufficiently meet the
needs of these clients. Unfortunately, we do not have elab-
orated information to support this interpretation, for in-
stance, whether the bullying is ongoing or not. Alternative
or additional interpretations are that these groups had
problems that were more complex and/or were more vul-
nerable in general [44, 45], and were in need of a more
comprehensive treatment than provided within the frames
of the PHMC. These interpretations may also apply well,
in reverse, to the group reporting job- or school-related
problems, as these might be seen as a relative resourceful
group with perhaps less complex problems. This group
was associated with increased improvement in symptoms
of depression. Additionally, during the implementation of
PMHC, the health benefits of work was highlighted both
by the Directorate of Health and through the therapist
curriculum. The therapist might thus have had more com-
petence in and awareness on addressing work-related
problems as compared to, for instance, bullying. Inter-
views with clients and therapist provide mixed support for
such interpretation, as the therapists regarded work as an
integrated and natural topic during treatment whereas cli-
ents noted little focus on work [35].

Regarding immigrants, bearing in mind their heteroge-
neous backgrounds
[45], additional explanations of
poorer treatment response include communication diffi-
culties between the therapist and the client, and contra-
therapist’s
client’s
dictions between the
conceptions of the illness [46]. In concert with the find-
ings that immigrants both were under-represented and

and the

had higher pre-treatment symptom scores as compared
to Norwegians, this underscores that the service should
take measures to lower barriers for access and better
meet the needs of these clients.

Interestingly, self-referral predicted slightly less im-
provement (ES -0.17) in symptoms of depression. Possible
explanations include differences in motivation [47] or
group composition, though notably no baseline differences
were observed between the self- and health personnel
referred other than lower pre-treatment symptom scores
among the former. In comparison no differences in out-
come were found between the self- and the GP-referred in
the first pilots in IAPT [11].

Implementation efforts
vAltogether, the PMHC sites have accomplished a lot dur-
ing the pilot period. PMHC was a complex service to im-
plement, especially in the early phase of the pilot project.
This was mainly due to the many requirements the pilot
sites were expected to meet. These involved the drafting
of new procedures; design of intake forms, information
material and websites; education and supervision of staff;
implementation of job-focused treatment and symptom
measurements during treatment; participation in the
research project; development of guided self-help ma-
terials and procedures; development or adaptation of
group courses; and collaboration with other services
[35].
It was therefore not beyond expectation that
some variation arose with regard to how the pilot
sites met requirements, and that some requirements
were underprioritized. As a result of good leadership
and high levels of professional commitment of the in-
volved therapists, all teams managed to build a new
service that was able to provide treatment for people
with mild to moderate anxiety and depression.

Despite the abovementioned indicators of PMHC
succeeding in being a low-threshold service, men, older
individuals, those with low education and immigrant
background were underrepresented compared to the
population statistics of
the PMHC pilot sites. This
mirrors what was found at the IAPT pilot sites [11]. The
option of self-referral did not increase participation of
underrepresented groups. In fact did immigrants use
self-referral to a lesser extents than non-immigrants.
This contrasts the experience from IAPT [10], but is line
with a registry-based study finding that immigrants in
Norway are less likely to seek help for mental health
problems [48]. Amount of self-referral varied substan-
tially between the pilot
sites, presumably partly
explained by some being hesitant of broad promotion of
their service through the establishing phase. Though
such pragmatic solutions might be necessary temporar-
ily, an unintended pitfall may be that it contributes to an
inequity of access.

that

The use of low-intensity treatment was underutilized
in many of the PMHC pilot sites, despite previous stud-
ies indicating that for example guided self-help can pro-
vide similar results as traditional face-to-face treatment
[49, 50]. The underutilization may partly be due to the
fact
therapists were primarily trained to use
face-to-face treatment. In connection with this, guided
self-help programs and group courses for psychoeduca-
tion were not available at the start of the pilot project.
Consequently, many pilot sites had to use considerable
amounts of time and resources to develop their own ma-
terial. This delayed and sometimes even hampered the
implementation and subsequent use of
low-intensity
treatments. It is essential for the further development of
PMHC that standardized, evidence-based programs for
guided self-help and courses are made available. Both

Strengths and limitations
A number of strengths and limitations should be men-
tioned. Strengths of the study included the relatively
large sample size and the use of multiple assessments
during the course of treatment, which resulted in large
amounts of follow-up data. The multiple assessments
helped to reduce potential bias in PHQ/GAD estimates
at post-treatment. We used a similar design and partly
the same instruments as in IAPT, which has eased the
comparisons between the two services. The two out-
come measures show high internal consistency and data
was analyzed using a variety of statistical models, all of
which increase our trust in the results. The pragmatic
focus provides a demonstration that treatments devel-
oped in controlled settings can be deployed at scale
within routine health care systems without major loss of
effectiveness. Limitations included the use of a single
group design. The mentioned ongoing randomized con-
trolled trial within PMHC will therefore be a major con-
tribution for how the observed changes in the PMHC
in a comparable
group compare to the changes
control group. The participation rate for the study
was somewhat low (61% versus 97% in the IAPT pi-
lots), which may have had consequences for the rep-
resentativeness of our sample. We should therefore be
somewhat careful
to generalize our findings to the
entire PMHC population and, as discussed, directly to
compare the sample with the IAPT clients. Some of
the measures were rather crude. Though avoiding too
extensive questionnaires,

Conclusion
Large improvement in symptoms of anxiety and depres-
sive were reported by clients having received treatment in
this newly implemented low-threshold primary care ser-
vice across Norway. Bearing in mind the lack of a control
group, this indicate that this adaption of IAPT is a viable
supplement to the existing health services to increase
access of effective treatment for people who suffer from
symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety and depression.
The services at the 12 sites across Norway were mainly
implemented according to the guidelines outlined by the
Norwegian Directorate of Health. Yet, PMHC is still in an
early phase of development, and there is room for
improvement in several areas, most notably increased use
of low-intensity treatments such as guided self-help and
increased use of PMHC by groups that are currently
underrepresented.
