The eﬀects of lithium treatment duration on deep grey matter structures in bipolar disorder are not well known.
In this cross-sectional neuroimaging case-control study, we tested the hypothesis that shape characteristics of
deep grey matter structures in bipolar disorder are associated with the duration of lithium treatment and with
clinical phenomenology.

In a setting of neuropsychiatry outpatient clinic, we included 74 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and 74
matched healthy control subjects (HC). Both groups underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging acquisition and
an exhaustive assessment of clinical and psychiatrics dimensions. Shape measures of seven deep grey matter
structures (hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus) were
obtained from T1 weighted images in both groups, using FSL FIRST segmentation tool. The segmented structures
were then analysed vertex-by-vertex with FSL Randomise tool. First, we investigated the presence of signiﬁcant
associations between the duration of lithium treatment and shape measures in BD sample. Then, for structures
that resulted signiﬁcantly associated with the duration of lithium treatment, comparisons between BD and HC
were performed either considering the BD group as a whole or dividing it in three groups based on the duration
of treatment (lithium drug-naïve, short and long treated). Any deformation uncovered by group comparisons was
subsequently associated with depressive and hypomanic/manic symptoms.

The relationship between structures shape and the duration of lithium treatment in BD sample was signiﬁcant
for bilateral nucleus accumbens. Speciﬁcally, signiﬁcant bilateral extroﬂection eﬀects, related to longer duration
of lithium treatment, were found bilaterally over the surface shape of core accumbens nuclei (r2
R-Accu-Core = 0.12,
L-Accu-Core = 0.1, p = 0.031). Moreover, introﬂection eﬀect related to longer duration of treatment
p = 0.016, r2
resulted over the shell of right accumbens (r2
R-Accu-Shell = 0.17, p = 0.002). Nucleus accumbens shape did not
diﬀer between BD and HC considering BD group as a whole. By contrast, categorizing BD in subgroups as a
function of the duration of lithium treatment revealed signiﬁcant inward deformation on the core of left ac-
cumbens nucleus and outward deformation on the shell of the right accumbens nucleus in lithium-naive patients,
compared to both patients with long duration of lithium treatment (pL-Accu-Core = 0.016, pR-Accu-Shell = 0.005)
and HC (pL-Accu-Core = 0.002; pR-Accu-Shell = 0.005). Moreover, compared to HC, inward deformation on the core
of the left accumbens surface was found for patients with short duration of treatment (pLAccu-Core = 0.027).
Finally, measures of surface deformation on the core of left accumbens observed in the group comparison
showed signiﬁcant positive correlations with depressive symptoms severity, as assessed by the Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (total score: r2
L-Accu-Core = 0.1, p = 0.005)
and Beck Hopelessness Scale (r2

L-AccuCore = 0.07, p = 0.02, somatic score: r2

LAccu-Core = 0.05, p = 0.03).

Findings demonstrate that lithium untreated BD patients are characterised by localized shape abnormalities in
the nucleus accumbens. Lithium treatment could act modulating these morphometric features as part of its
mechanism of action in mood stabilizing.

1. Introduction

Brain changes in deep grey matter (DGM) structures have been
described with some inconsistences (McDonald et al., 2004) in patients
with diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BD) (Hibar et al., 2016). While the
sources of heterogeneity are multifactorial, one much debated source of
bias is the eﬀect of mood-stabilizing medications, primarily lithium (the
archetypal mood stabilizer), that is already thought to have a mod-
ulatory eﬀect in terms of volumetric increase induced on brain struc-
tures, particularly hippocampus and amygdala (Manji et al., 2000;
Shaltiel et al., 2007; De-Paula et al., 2016; Simonetti et al., 2016).

In recent years, developments in brain morphometric methodolo-
gies have led to diﬀerent structural measures that can integrate data
derived from volumetric analysis. Indeed, investigation of the three-
dimensional surfaces of DGM structures have been shown to be more
sensitive than gross morphometric techniques, identifying group ab-
normalities where volumetric analyses did not (Mamah et al., 2009).
Since shape analysis enables the uncovering of localized changes on the
surface of brain structures it can be a very speciﬁc neuroimaging
measure, especially in the case of structures with explicit regional dif-
ferentiation in functions, such as DGM (Herrero et al., 2002). Previous
studies investigating DGM shape in BD reported that drug-naive and
non-psychotic BD patients, compared to healthy controls (HC), show
widespread shape alteration of the caudate (Hwang et al., 2006;
Ong et al., 2012; Mamah et al., 2016; Womer et al., 2014) and putamen
(Mamah et al., 2016; Womer et al., 2014), both as local inward and
outward deformations. Signiﬁcant shape contraction on the dorsal
surface of the right accumbens and widespread contractions of the
globus pallidus in non-psychotic BD patients have also been reported
(Mamah et al., 2016). However, results from these studies did not
consider neither the speciﬁc eﬀect of lithium treatment nor the eﬀect of
its duration relative to illness duration. Indeed, a staging model for
bipolar disorder has recently been proposed claiming that a better re-
sponse to treatment generally occurs when drugs are introduced early
in the course of the illness (Vieta et al., 2011). Coherently, this model
posits that response to treatment is function of the duration of illness
and that the longer untreated duration of illness the longer duration of
treatment is necessary in order to be eﬀective. In this perspective,
treatment duration should be considered as the balance between the
exposure to neuropathological (Van Gestel et al., 2019) (driven by ill-
ness duration) and neuroprotective (driven by lithium treatment) pro-
cesses.

Finally, the relationship between lithium-driven DGM shape varia-
tions and clinical correlates of BD patients, such as the degree of de-
pressive and manic symptoms, has not been investigated.

In the present work, our ﬁrst aim was to analyse the potential eﬀect
of the duration of lithium treatment on the morphometric measures of
DGM surfaces. As a secondary goal, we aimed at identifying the re-
lationship between the severity of patients’ depressive and/or manic
symptomatology and the degree of any localized DGM abnormalities.
To these aims we analysed the shape of seven bilateral DGM structures
(i.e. Accumbens, Amygdala, Caudate, Hippocampus, Pallidus, Putamen,
and Thalamus) in HC and BD samples, both considering BD as a whole
group and stratifying it in subsamples, according to lithium treatment
duration.

We hypothesize that shape of DGM structures of BD is associated to
lithium treatment duration, given the well-established neurotrophic
eﬀect of lithium (Manji et al., 2000). Further, based on previous lit-
erature focusing on volume data (Simonetti et al., 2016), we predict
that diﬀerences between BD and HC subjects on DGM surface will be

evident only categorizing patients as a function of duration of lithium
treatment, such that shape abnormalities would emerge particularly in
never treated patients. Finally, we expect that such abnormalities will
be associated to the severity of depressive and hypomanic/manic pa-
tients’ symptomatology, given lithium eﬃcacy in mood stabilization
(Geddes et al., 2004).

2. Methods

This cross-sectional case-control study was approved by the local
ethic committee of the Santa Lucia Foundation. All participants pro-
vided written informed consent to be included in the study.

Given the lack of prior studies about the relationship between DGM
shape morphometry and lithium treatment in bipolar disorder, an a
priori power calculation in G*power was used to determine the
minimum sample size. Speciﬁcally, we used data from our previous
study on hippocampal volumetry in bipolar disorder (Simonetti et al.,
2016), which showed an eﬀect sizes of 0.85–0.99 for the lithium-de-
pendent modulatory eﬀects, to inform the power calculation. To be
conservative we used the lower estimate, which determined that a total
sample size of at least 24 subjects would have greater than 95% power
to detect a diﬀerence between groups, with an alpha value of <0.05
(two tailed).

Subjects were recruited between May 2013 and March 2017.

2.1. Participants

(American

(DSM-IVTR)

Text Revised

Eighty patients with a diagnosis of BD (49 BD type I – 31 BD type II)
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IV-Edition,
Psychiatric
Association 2000) were initially assessed at the Santa Lucia Foundation
in Rome. The clinical psychiatrist who had been treating the patients
and knew their clinical history, and who was blind to the aims of the
study, made the preliminary diagnosis using the DSM- IV-TR criteria.
Then, a research psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV-TR-Patient Edition (SCID-I/P) (First et al., 2002) conﬁrmed the
clinical diagnoses. If the diagnoses made at the two diﬀerent steps were
not consistent, more data were gathered and the diagnostic process
continued until a ﬁnal diagnostic consensus was reached. If an agree-
ment could not be reached the patient was not included in the sample.
From the original BD group (n = 80), two refused to undergo the MRI
exam and four were excluded given the low quality of T1-weighted
images (see exclusion criteria). The remaining sample of 74 patients
included 45 with BD-I and 29 with BD-II.

We also recruited 74 healthy controls (HC) in the same geographical
area, paired-matched with the patients for age, gender and educational
level. All HC were screened for a current or lifetime history of DSM-IV-
TR Axis I and II disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders, Research Version, Non-patient Edition
(SCID-I-NP) (First et al., 1997a) and the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) (First et al., 1997b);
they were also assessed to conﬁrm that no ﬁrst-degree relative had a
history of bipolar, mood- or schizophrenia-related disorders.

Apart from these groups-speciﬁc inclusion processes, inclusion cri-
teria for all participants were: (i) age between 18 and 75 years, (ii) at
least ﬁve years of education, and (iii) suitability for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scanning. Exclusion criteria were: (i) history of alcohol
or drug abuse during the two years before the assessment, (ii) lifetime
drug dependence, (iii) traumatic head injury with loss of consciousness,
(iv) past or present major medical illness or neurological disorders, (v)

(FLAIR) scans, potentially explaining critical phenomenology; in par-
ticular, the presence, severity, and location of vascular lesions were
computed according to the semi-automated method developed by our
group (Iorio et al., 2013).

2.3. Clinical assessment

Clinical characteristics were collected during a semi-structured
clinical interview and all patients were under stable pharmacologic
treatment for at least six months. Age at onset was deﬁned as ‘age at
onset of ﬁrst aﬀective symptoms’, which were investigated in an in-
terview with patients and ﬁrst-degree relatives. We also collected spe-
ciﬁc information about lithium treatment duration (LiTD), reported in
months. We categorized patients with LiTD longer than 50% of illness
duration (hereafter called LiTD+, N = 13), those with LiTD shorter
than 50% of illness duration (LiTD-, N = 31), and those not taking
lithium at all (NoLi, N = 30), in order to weight up LiTD as a function
of patients’ illness duration. This was done in order to obtain better
homogeneity (in terms of lifetime drug exposure) of samples to com-
pare with HC group, according to the staging model of BD (Vieta et al.,
2011). At the time of MRI scanning, patients in both LiTD+ and LiTD-
groups all were still taking lithium.

(Hamilton, 1960),

The severity of aﬀective depressive and hypomanic/manic symp-
toms was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D)
the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)
(Beck, 1998) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (Young et al.,
1978). The amount of depressive symptoms were scored, rating also the
psychological (HAM-Dpsy) and somatic components (HAM-Dsom) of
depression, apart from the total score (HAM-D tot).

2.4. Image acquisition e processing

All 148 participants underwent the same imaging protocol, which
included 3D T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences using a 3T
Achieva MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands)
with a 32-channel receiving-only head coil. Whole-brain T1-weighted
images were obtained using a fast-ﬁeld echo sequence (echo time/re-
petition:
si-
zeec = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3). T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences were ac-
quired to screen for brain pathology.

time = 5.3/11 ms, ﬂip angleec = 9°, voxel

Segmentations of seven bilateral subcortical grey matter nuclei
(Accumbens, Amygdala, Caudate, Hippocampus, Pallidus, Putamen,
and Thalamus) were generated using the FIRST algorithms included in
the FMRIB Software Library (FSL, version 5.0.0). Speciﬁcally, FIRST is a
fully automated model-based segmentation/registration software, pro-
viding analysing tools both for volume estimations and localized dif-
ferences in shape (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIRST). The

segmentation process is based on the shape and appearance models,
constructed from 336 manually segmented images using Gaussian as-
approach
combined with a Bayesian probabilistic
sumptions
(Patenaude et al., 2011). FIRST algorithms ascertain the most probable
shape by means of linear combinations of shape variations employing
the learned manually segmented models. Moreover, the segmentation
process includes boundary correction and registration to a MNI152
template using 12 degrees of freedom as well as a subcortical mask to
detect and eliminate voxels outside the subcortical structure. Shape was
then expressed as a mean with modes of variation (principal compo-
nents).

After the automated segmentation performed by the software, the
outputs were manually checked and conﬁrmed for the proper nuclei
extraction of all the subcortical structures. FSLView toolbox was used
for neuroimaging results visualizations (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/
fslwiki/FslView).

In case of signiﬁcant results located in the nucleus accumbens, we
further reﬁned their localization in terms of speciﬁc accumbens sub-
regions (i.e. core and shell), by using the Allan Human Brain Atlas
(Hawrylycz et al., 2012) (available from: http://atlas.brain-map.org)
and referring to previous evidence on accumbens anatomy (Baliki et al.,
2013) (see Results section).

2.5. Statistical analyses

Comparisons between HC and BD on sociodemographic variables
(i.e. age, gender, and educational level) and between BD subgroups on
sociodemographic and clinical (i.e. duration of illness, number of epi-
sodes, time of lithium exposure, severity of (hypo)manic/depressive
symptoms and pharmacological treatment) characteristics were per-
formed using t-test, ANOVA or chi-square tests on StatView statistical
software, considering p < 0.05 as statistical threshold for signiﬁcance.
All neuroimaging statistics were performed by vertex-wise shape
analysis along the surface of the segmented DGM structures, using FSL
Randomise tool with a nonparametric permutation testing (Nichols and
Holmes, 2002). We used n = 5000 permutations and a Threshold-Free
Cluster Enhancement (TFCE, –T2) to correct for multiple comparisons
(p < 0.05, after correction for multiple comparisons) (Smith and
Nichols, 2009).

We preliminary checked for the presence of diﬀerences in demo-
graphical, clinical (Table 1) and DGM morphological features between
BD-I and BD-II performing t-tests between patients’ subgroups. Since no
diﬀerence was found between BD subtypes, subsequent analyses were
performed considering BD patient groups as a whole.

The eﬀect of lithium treatment duration on BD DGM was in-
vestigated using FSL Randomise as follows: ﬁrst, linear regressions were
performed between each DGM shape measure of BD (continuous de-
pendent variable) and LiTD (continuous independent variable), in-
cluding the duration of illness as covariate of no interest. The inclusion
of the covariate was justiﬁed by the signiﬁcant association with the
independent variable (r2 = 0.125, p = 0.0186). Second, in case of
signiﬁcant linear regressions results, we compared BD and HC either
considering patient group as a whole, either dividing patients in three
groups based on LiTD. In the ﬁrst case, DGM of BD and HC were
compared using t-test while in the second case, ANOVA analyses were

conducted, using shape as dependant variable and group (i.e. LiTD+,
LiTD-, NoLi, HC groups) as four-level independent variable. We per-
formed the last two analyses in order to assess whether the impact of
the duration of lithium treatment is crucial to bring out diﬀerences
between patients and controls and to investigate in which time point of
medication they could be evident. Moreover, categorizing patient ac-
cording to treatment duration, we investigated if lithium-associated
DGM morphological characteristics found in BD were similar to these
observed in physiological states. T-tests were performed for post-hoc
comparisons. The relationship between values of inward/outward de-
formations in BD patients (independent variable) and clinical symptoms
severity (i.e. HAM-Dtot, HAM-Dpsy, HAM-Dsom, BHStot) (dependent
variable) was subsequently assessed performing linear regressions. We
focused subsequent ANOVA post-hoc (pairwise comparisons) and linear
regressions (surface deformations vs. symptom severity) analyses in
those areas where signiﬁcant surface outward or inward deformations
emerged from results of the main ANOVA analysis.

3. Results

3.1. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics

Sociodemographic characteristics of BD (as a whole) and HC groups
are shown in Table 2. As expected, in view of the matching procedure,
the groups did not diﬀer in terms of age, gender or educational level
(Table 2). No diﬀerences were also found when HC were compared to
BD subgroups (NoLi, LiTD- and LiTD+) (Table 3). Furthermore, the
NoLi, LiTD- and LiTD+ subgroups did not diﬀer in terms of duration of
illness, number of past episodes, HAM-D scores, YMRS scores, or – with
the exception of lithium exposure – current and past pharmacotherapies
(Table 3).

3.2. Shape analysis

Either comparisons between BD-I and BD-II patients or between HC
and BD (considered as a single diagnostic group) did not show sig-
niﬁcant shape diﬀerences in any of the analysed DGM structures.

The linear relationship between LiTD and DGM shape in BD in-
dicated both positive and negative signiﬁcant associations between the
duration of lithium treatment and the morphometric characteristics of
clusters located on the bilateral nucleus accumbens (R-Accu and L-
Accu). In order to qualify the localization of signiﬁcant changes in
terms of speciﬁc accumbens subregions (i.e. core or shell), we both
referred results to the standard Human Brain Atlas (Hawrylycz et al.,
2012) (available from: http://human.brain-map.org) and to previous
evidence for human nucleus accumbens anatomy (Baliki et al., 2013)
described by the MNI coordinates, which anatomically deﬁned the core
and the shell of the nucleus accumbens. According to y-axis coordinate
and to boundaries obtained from Human Brain Atlas (Hawrylycz et al.,
2012), our results could be selectively located on the surfaces of the
accumbens nuclei core or shell. Speciﬁcally, we found positive bilateral
correlations in clusters on the accumbens core sub-ﬁeld (statistical
peaks: corrected pR-AccuCore = 0.016; corrected pL-Accu-Core = 0.031)
indicating that the longer lithium treatment duration, the more out-
ward is the bending of the cluster on the core (i.e. core extroﬂection).
Moreover, we found a negative correlation between shape and lithium
treatment duration in a cluster on the boundary of the R-Accu shell sub-
ﬁeld (statistical peak: corrected pR-Accu-Shell = 0.002), indicating that
lithium treatment duration is associated with inward bending in this
sub-region (i.e. shell introﬂection) (Fig. 1).

When splitting the BD group in terms of LiTD (LiTD+, LiTD-, NoLi
and HC), ANOVA performed on R-Accu and L-Accu shape showed sig-
niﬁcant
pL-Accu-
(statistical
ANOVA = 0.025; corrected pR-Accu-ANOVA = 0.025) (Fig. 2). Post-hoc t-
tests revealed R-Accu shell outward deformation in the NoLi group
compared to LiTD+ (statistical peak: corrected pR-Accu-Shell = 0.016)

and HC (statistical peak: corrected pR-Accu-Shell = 0.002). Moreover, the
LiTD- group showed L-Accu core inward deformation compared to HC
(statistical peak: corrected pL-Accu-Core = 0.027). Details on results and
clusters coordinates are shown in Table 4.

The shape of BD L-Accu-Core was positively correlated with HAM-
Dtot (statistical peaks: corrected pL-Accu-core = 0.02), HAM-Dsom (sta-
tistical peaks: corrected pL-Accu-core = 0.005) and BHStot (statistical
peaks: corrected pL-Accu-core = 0.03) scores (Table 4, Fig. 3), indicating
the more inward deformation the higher depression symptom severity.
No signiﬁcant associations were found for YMRStot scores.

4. Discussion

Despite a substantial amount of research over the past decades has
been focused on neurotrophic and neuroprotective eﬀects of lithium,
this is the ﬁrst report describing an association between lithium treat-
ment duration and Accu shape in patients diagnosed with BD. Here we
show that patients without or even with short-term personal history of
lithium treatment have outward R-Accu shell and inward L-Accu core
surface changes, when compared to both healthy individuals and pa-
tients under long-term lithium treatment. Moreover, in patients we
showed that the increased duration of lithium treatment was associated
with both an extroﬂection eﬀect on the core of bilateral Accu and a
concomitant introﬂection eﬀect on the shell of R-Accu. Both these ef-
fects showed that the longer duration of treatment the strongest shape
modulations, bringing patient whit longer treatment to have an Accu
morphology similar to that of healthy controls. We also found that in-
ward deformation of L-Accu core shape is signiﬁcantly correlated with
increased depression severity.

A small number of previous studies (Hwang et al., 2006; Ong et al.,
2012; Mamah et al., 2016; Womer et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2017) in-
vestigated the shape of brain regions in patients with BD and half of
them were restricted to the caudate (Hwang et al., 2006; Ong et al.,
2012) and putamen nuclei alone (Ong et al., 2012) or did not consider
DGM structures at all (Sun et al., 2017). Among the remaining studies,
ﬁndings led to inconsistent results (Mamah et al., 2016; Womer et al.,
2014)
Indeed,

modulatory eﬀect of lithium treatment was clearly described on other
morphometric brain measures, such as volume (Hibar et al., 2016;
Simonetti et al., 2016; Sani et al., 2018) and cortical
thickness
(Giakoumatos et al., 2015). Indeed, lithium treatment was associated
with volume preservation of deep grey matter assemblies (e.g. hippo-
campus, amygdala, thalamus and basal ganglia) and cortical thickening
in frontal, parietal and occipital regions as well as in the precuneus and
precentral areas (Abramovic et al., 2016). This was also conﬁrmed by
post-mortem studies demonstrating lower numbers of neurons among
individuals with BD who are lithium-treatment naïve (Benes et al.,
1998; Bowley et al., 2002).

The Accu has dopamine as a principal neurotransmitter and animal
studies described that lithium modulates neuronal activity and dopa-
mine neurotransmission in models of BD. In particular, Clock-Δ19 mice
have higher dopamine levels in the Accu area (Coque et al., 2011) and
display behaviours that are very similar to those found in human BD
(i.e. increased exploratory drive in novel environments, signiﬁcant re-
duction in sleep, decreased anxiety related behaviours, and increase in
cocaine preference). Chronic administration of lithium decreases Clock-
Δ19 mice dopamine tissue levels in the Accu and reverses many of the
phenotypes of Clock-Δ19 mice. Consistently with our morphological
results, it has been demonstrated that dopamine neurotransmission
modulates diﬀerent responses of core and shell Accu neurons and de-
pletion of dopamine release from the ascending pathway diﬀerently
aﬀect the morphology of medium spiny neurons of the two Accu dis-
tricts (Meredith et al., 1995). Speciﬁcally, in animal models dopamine
depletion is associated with a signiﬁcant reduction of the dendritic
length of neurons in the core but not in the shell, which show a more
tortuous morphology instead. It could be the case that an initial pa-
thogenetic condition in BD lithium naïve patients is characterized by
increased level of tonic dopamine, inducing oxidative neuronal loss
with a concomitant reduction of dopaminergic connections. Then, do-
pamine deﬂection consequent to oxidative neuronal loss can lead to
shorter dendrites in the core resulting in an inward surface deforma-
tion. Since the same input (dopamine deﬂection) causes an opposite
eﬀect on the neuronal dendrites of the shell, here the pathological
oxidative process could lead to a more tortuous internal organization,
ending in an outward surface deformation.

A number of mechanisms have been recognized as associated to the
neuroprotective/neurotrophic eﬀects of lithium that could be useful in
interpreting our results. The inhibition of a protein kinase having a pro-
apoptotic action (i.e. glycogen synthase kinase-3, GSK-3), the induction
of intracellular molecular survival pathway, and the stimulation of
GABAergic neurotransmission, are those having the most direct evi-
dence (Malhi et al., 2013). By stimulating inhibitory GABAergic neu-
rotransmission while reducing the excitatory dopaminergic one
(Malhi et al., 2013; Chiu and Chuang, 2010), lithium reduces the

neuronal loss due to oxidative stress and promotes neuronal plasticity
(Gray and Mcewen, 2013). Some of these mechanisms, or probably all
these coupled together, could be responsible for grey matter shape re-
modelling, even if the precise underling biochemical mechanism of this
drugs remain poorly deﬁned. Based on the hypothesis suggested by
Van Essen (1997), the shapes of speciﬁc brain structures may be de-
termined by the physical properties of neural tissue combined to the
patterns of neural connectivity and biochemical mechanism mediating
the neural signalling cascades. Being a dynamic process, it drives
normal conditions, neurodegenerative and neurorestorative processes.
In this context, lithium treatment could act as a trigger that elicits an
extensive reprogramming of BD pathological baseline condition, ﬁnally
resulting in shape remodelling.

The Accu is connected to the limbic and extrapyramidal motor
systems. Recent evidence (Li et al., 2018) suggests that Accu D1 and D2
dopamine receptors in Accu core and shell receive similar inputs from
diverse sources. Inputs to the core are broadly scattered whereas inputs
to the shell are relatively concentrated around DGM. Speciﬁcally, the
anterior cortex preferentially innervates the core for both D1 and D2,
whereas the lateral hypothalamic area preferentially targets D1 in the
shell. Acting as a limbic-motor interface, the Accu regulates motivation
and emotional processes and is involved in a number of the most dis-
abling neuropsychiatric disorders (Mavridis et al., 2011; De Rossi et al.,
2016; Nestler and Carlezon, 2006; Francis and Lobo, 2017). Moreover,
it is part of a circuit including the hippocampus, the amygdala, the
prefrontal cortex and other regions mediating emotional memory and
anxiety (Francis and Lobo, 2017). As such, the Accu has a central role in
the cerebral reward system. It integrates excitatory inputs from these
regions triggering emotionally motivated behaviours through cortico-
striatal-thalamic loops within the basal ganglia, eventually driving the
dorsolateral
behaviours
facilitate
(Floresco, 2015). These local and global Accu circuit interactions
mediate motivated and emotional behaviour, making them an attrac-
tive focus to study aﬀective disorders such as BD and depression. Evi-
dence for reward and dopamine neural systems alterations in mood
disorders, like mania, major depression and BD, have been widely re-
ported both in humans and animal models (Francis and Lobo, 2017;
Abler et al., 2008; Abramson et al., 1989; Satterthwaite et al., 2015;
Naranjo et al., 2001; Berk et al., 2007). Furthermore, it has been pro-
posed a “dopamine dysregulation syndrome” model for the BD patho-
physiology (Berk et al., 2007), where a cyclical dysregulation in
quantitative dopaminergic transmission is the main construct. Despite
our work does not directly asses dopamine transmission, it supports this
model showing a complex pattern of lithium-dependant surface mod-
ulatory eﬀects on such central node for dopamine and rewarding sys-
tems.

between L-Accu core area inward deformation and both hopelessness
and depressive symptom severity. Recently, a more accurate way for
characterizing Accu functions has been proposed overcoming the ped-
antic view that it merely acts as a reward centre relay (Floresco, 2015).
Speciﬁcally, the Accu is involved in the modulation of cerebral pro-
cessing of motivationally relevant goals by promoting likelihood, eﬃ-
ciency, and vigour of behaviours intended to obtain those goals, driving
exploration of novel stimuli and procurement of things worth having
(rewards) or the avoidance of aversive consequences. Moreover, the
core and shell areas modulate diﬀerent functions in this motivational
process: the core has a more prominent role in instigating approach
behaviour toward motivationally relevant stimuli (“go to it” function)

while the shell drives behaviour to stay on tasks until the rich of a goal
(“stay to it” function), suppressing irrelevant or non-rewarded actions.
Our results of increased L-Accu core inward deformation associated
with higher depressive symptom severity support the hypothesis of a
decreasing “go to it” brain signalling as pathophysiological correlate of
depressive phenomenology in BD. A recent theory was proposed to
integrate the hopelessness theory of depression (Abramson et al., 1989)
and Davidson's (1994) approach/withdrawal motivational theory of
depression, based on the evidence that individual with high vulner-
ability to cognitive distress resulted in higher hopelessness and de-
pression scores
and fewer motivated goal-directed behaviour
(Haeﬀel et al., 2008). Amotivational/anhedonic features are crucial

components of depression and, interestingly, the left lateralized ﬁnding
of Accu core deformation in BD may be explained by the crucial role of
the dominant hemisphere in motivational behaviours (Pizzagalli et al.,
2005). Studies conducted over several decades support the use of long-
term lithium treatment to prevent depression relapse in patients with
bipolar disorder (Geddes et al., 2004). In this context, our ﬁndings may
reﬂect one of the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the ther-
apeutic eﬀect of lithium, as part of its eﬃcacy on preventing depression
that may unfold through a long-term remodelling of cortical-subcortical
connections related to the motivational/hedonic dimension.

5. Limitations

Several issues have to be considered before concluding. First, the
sample size of LiTD+ group is relatively small. However, it is adequate
to detect shape diﬀerences because of the moderate to large eﬀect size
we observed. Second, our results come from a cross-sectional study
design and should be replicated also with a longitudinal approach for
deﬁnitively demonstrating a causal eﬀect between lithium exposure
and Accu neuroprotection. Third, our patients were treated also with
diﬀerent psychotropic drugs that might potentially aﬀect Accu shape.
However, it could be noted that BD subgroups showed no diﬀerences in
terms of non-lithium pharmacological drugs, making unlikely the
probability that they may have inﬂuenced our results.

Finally, the criterium adopted here for categorising BD patients
according to the 50% ratio between illness and treatment duration
could be considered as arbitrary. However, as posited by the staging
model of BD (Vieta et al., 2011), the impact of pharmacological treat-
ment should be considered relatively to illness duration rather than in
its absolute value, assuming the construct that the earlier intervention
the better eﬃcacy. From the other side, it should be thought that the
longer time of brain exposure to pathological conditions the stronger
intervention is needed to counteract the illness. Therefore, we chose the
50% threshold since it distinguishes patients having more exposure to
potential neuroprotective eﬀects (driven by lithium treatment) than to
neuropathological processes (driven by the illness) from patients
showing the opposite pattern. In practical terms, the 50% ratio re-
present the “zero” point as reference to the balance between neuro-
pathological and neuroprotective eﬀects.

6. Conclusions

Lithium treatment aﬀects Accu surface morphology in BD, with
diﬀerent impacts on core and shell. Diﬀerences between BD and HC on
Accu shape morphometry are signiﬁcant in patients never treated with
lithium but they progressively decrease and disappear in patients under

long-term treatment. Lithium treatment dependent surface deforma-
tions of L-Accu core showed signiﬁcant correlations with the severity of
depressive phenomenology, being the less inward deformation asso-
ciated to the lower depression symptoms, especially in terms of somatic
and hopefulness components. Taken together our results suggest that
the duration of lithium treatment is associated with the modulation of
Accu shape as part of the mechanism of action possibly linked with its
mood stabilizing eﬀects.
