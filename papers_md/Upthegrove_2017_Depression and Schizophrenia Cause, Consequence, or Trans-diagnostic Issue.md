The presence of depression in schizophrenia has been a chal-
lenge to the Kraepelinian dichotomy, with various attempts 
to save the fundamental distinction including evoking and 
refining diagnoses such as schizoaffective disorder. But the 
tectonic plates are shifting. Here we put forward a summary 
of  recent  evidence  regarding  the  prevalence,  importance, 
possible  aetiological  pathways  and  treatment  challenges 
that recognizing depression in schizophrenia bring. Taken 
together  we  propose  that  depression  is  more  than  comor-
bidity and that increased effective therapeutic attention to 
mood symptoms will be needed to improve outcomes and to 
support prevention.

Prevalence of Depression in the Life Course of 
Schizophrenia

The  prevalence  of  depressive  disorder  in  schizophrenia 
has been reported to be around 40%, however the stage 
of illness (early vs chronic) and state (acute or post-psy-
chotic) factors influences figures, which can thus vary con-
siderably.1 In acute episodes rates are up to 60%, whilst in 
post-psychotic schizophrenia rates of moderate to severe 
depression  vary  between  20%  in  chronic  schizophrenia 
and  50%  following  treatment  of  first  episode.2  When 
examining very early phases of illness, in groups identi-
fied as ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis, high rates of 
“comorbid”  axis  one  diagnoses  are  reported,  with  over 
40% reaching criteria for a depressive disorder, outweigh-
ing anxiety or other mood symptoms.3 When depression 
is  investigated  longitudinally  in  schizophrenia,  the  vast 
majority,  up  to  80%,  of  patients  experience  a  clinically 
significant  depressive  episode  at  1  or  more  time  point 

during  the  early  phase.  This  underlines  how  cross-sec-
tional  rates  markedly  underestimate  the  true  prevalence 
and  suggests  that  in  the  early  phase  of  illness  at  least, 
mood  symptoms  may  be  more  than  “comorbid”  expe-
riences.  The  diversity  in  reported  figures  for  depression 
is  also  partly  attributed  to  the  challenge  in  distinguish-
ing  mood  symptoms  from  negative  symptoms,  suggest-
ing a complex and as yet poorly understood overlap with 
other symptom dimensions at a phenomenological level.4 
Depression in schizophrenia has long been a taxonomic 
challenge  leading  to  assertions  that  true  schizophrenia 
is  “non-affective”;  or  invention  of  new  diagnoses  and 
broadening  definitions,  such  as  schizoaffective  disorder. 
In DSM-V schizoaffective disorder, the occurrence of the 
delusions or hallucinations must be present in the absence 
of any serious mood symptoms for at least 2 weeks whilst 
the mood disorder must be present for the majority of the 
total duration of illness.5 Our increasing knowledge as to 
the  prevalence  and  course  of  depression  in  schizophre-
nia particularly, in the early years makes, the distinction 
between  schizophrenia  and  new  definitions  of  schizoaf-
fective disorder even more challenging.2

Importance of Depression in Schizophrenia

Historically  there  has  been  some  thought  that  the  pres-
ence of mood symptoms in schizophrenia may be a good 
prognostic  indicator,  with  patients  who  have  high  levels 
of  affective  symptoms  appearing  more  on  the  “bipolar” 
rather than deficit/autistic end of a psychosis continuum 
model.6 However on the contrary, evidence suggests that 
depression  is  linked  to  poorer  outcomes  in  schizophre-
nia.2,7 As example, depression is the most significant factor 
in completed suicide in schizophrenia, more so than act-
ing on command hallucinations.8 Depression also has long

term consequences for functional recovery and quality of 
life.1 Conley et al report that those with schizophrenia and 
depression were significantly more likely to relapse, to be 
a  safety  concern  (violent,  arrested,  victimized,  suicidal), 
have greater substance-related problems and report poorer 
life satisfaction, mental functioning, family relationships, 
and  medication  adherence.1  In  UHR  samples,  reporting 
of psychotic like experiences in the presence of moderate 
depression also raises risk for suicidal ideation. Kelleher 
et  al  show  in  a  large  community  sample  that  attenuated 
psychotic  experiences  were  relatively  common  among 
young people who had a diagnosis of moderate depressive 
disorder, and that the combination of experiences in this 
sample was significantly associated with suicidal behavior: 
ie, patients did not need to present with severe depression 
or  have  formal  psychotic  symptoms  to  be  at  heightened 
risk.9 In addition, depression has been linked to increased 
risk  of  transition  from  UHR  to  first-episode  psychosis 
(FEP), suggesting that in this group depression also indi-
cates a poorer outcome.10 However, the relationships are 
not straightforward nor is there sufficient evidence to sug-
gest  direct  causality.  In  longitudinal  studies  depression 
and positive symptoms may co-occur but not necessarily 
predict each other over time.11

Phenomenology of Depression in Schizophrenia: 
Interplay of Depression and Negative Symptoms

Depression  is  a  mood  disorder  that  is  characterized  by 
apathy, low mood and social withdrawal.12 Beck describes 
a  “cognitive  triad”  in  depression  of  “life  is  pointless,  the 
future hopeless and the self is worthless.”13 The nature of 
the phenomenology of depression in schizophrenia, how-
ever, has not often been interrogated in phenomenological 
terms.  Some  of  our  recent  evidence  suggests  self-stigma, 
shame,  difficulty  in  regaining  trust  in  ones  own  thoughts 
after recovery from delusional beliefs, and poor motivation 
are core features rather than other more “biological” symp-
toms such as early morning wakening, diurnal variation in 
mood or loss of appetite.14 The Calgary Depression Scale 
for Schizophrenia (CDSS) is widely used to assess depres-
sion as a distinct from negative symptoms, with weight rest-
ing more on subjective reports of hopelessness, guilt, and 
suicidal ideation rather than agitation, anhedonia and par-
anoid symptoms as seen in other depression rating scales.15
Use  of  the  CDSS  has  been  built  on  the  distinction 
between  primary  and  secondary  negative  symptoms. 
Secondary negative symptoms (particularly those of such 
as anergia, alogia and flattened affect) may present as a 
result of depression.16 However, there are features in com-
mon  to  both  depression  and  negative  symptoms,  such 
as  social  withdrawal,  diminished  capacity  to  experience 
pleasure (anhedonia) and loss of motivation. With regard 
to anhedonia, recently there has been distinction between 
motivational  anhedonia  (motivation  to  pursue  rewards) 
and  consummatory  anhedonia  (pleasure  experienced  in 

Depression and Schizophrenia

anticipation  or  response  to  rewards).  Consummatory 
anhedonia  and  difficulty  in  anticipating  future  pleasure 
may be more in keeping with depression, where as moti-
vational  anhedonia  better  seen  as  a  primary  negative 
symptom.  Strauss  and  colleagues  argue  that  anhedonia 
should not defined as a diminished capacity to experience 
pleasure but a cognitive dissonance of low pleasure that 
surfaces  when  a  person  is  asked  to  report  on  future  or 
past positive emotions, reduced pleasure seeking behav-
ior  or  elevation  of  negative  emotions.17  This  has  strong 
similarities with depression at a symptom level (negative 
emotions  associated  with  difficulty  in  retrieval  of  posi-
tive emotions or memories) and within the NIHR RDoC 
framework suggests the need to investigate anhedonia at 
a symptom level across diagnoses.

Thus, whilst anhedonia may be common to depression 
and negative symptoms, other core depressive symptoms, 
as assessed with the CDSS appear distinct. We have previ-
ously shown depression and negative symptoms as specifi-
cally assessed are orthogonal.2 This leads to the possibility 
that whilst anhedonia itself may be considered transdiag-
nositc,  subtypes  including  anticipatory,  consummatory, 
and motivational anhedonia, maybe more specific.

Depression and Mood Instability as a Dimension of 
Psychosis

Of the many factor analysis studies of psychosis, all identify 
depression and more broadly mood symptoms as a distinct 
dimension, including those that investigate a schizophreni-
form sample in the absence of affective psychoes.18 We note 
above the high rates of depression in UHR and first-epi-
sode samples but importantly, instability of mood in the 
early course of psychosis is also widespread. Instability in 
mood  and  negative  affect  is  associated  with  clinical  and 
nonclinical paranoid thinking and with the emergence and 
persistence  of  auditory  hallucinations.19  It  also  explain 
new inception of paranoid ideas and auditory hallucina-
tions at 18 months.20 High rates of childhood trauma are 
reported in both schizophrenia and depression compared 
to controls and are thought to be important in the genesis 
of both disorders.21 Mood instability may act as a mediator 
between traumatic events such as bullying and persecutory 
ideation,  as  well  as  childhood  sexual  abuse  and  psycho-
sis, though interestingly this effect doesn’t hold true at the 
point of transition in UHR samples.22

Psychotic-like  experiences  are  also  more  common 
in  individuals  with  anxiety  and  depressive  disorders, 
while  UHR  samples  have  high  rates  of  anxiety,  as  well 
as  depression.23  Why  mood  instability  levels  are  high  in 
schizophrenia  or  how  this  relates  to  depression  in  this 
group requires further research, but the mechanism may 
involve maladaptive cognitive emotional regulation strat-
egies  involving  situation  selection,  rumination,  worry, 
re-appraisal,  and  experiential  avoidance.  For  example, 
experience sampling method (ESM) studies demonstrate 

241

R. Upthegrove et al

patients with schizophrenia are more stress reactive than 
first  degree  relatives  or  healthy  controls,  and  this  emo-
tional  reactivity  correlates  with  positive  symptoms  and 
need for care.24

The  close  linkage  between  psychosis  symptoms  and 
depression,  especially  in  the  prodromal  phase  has  led 
to  proposals  that  depression  in  schizophrenia  may  be 
the  severe  end  of  a  dimension  of  affective  dysregula-
tion beginning in adolescence progressing into the early 
stages  of  psychosis  as  the  illness  crystalizes.  Fusar-poli 
and Yung propose an increasing specificity and power of 
positive  symptoms  whereby  at  a  population  level  both 
may be non significant co-occurrences, yet when seen in 
established severe mental illness have distinct specificity.25 
It  is  possible  the  relationship  between  mood  and  posi-
tive symptoms follow a similar course; thus when seen in 
UHR may represent non-specific indicator of pluripotent 
pathways, yet as illness progression occurs a more direct 
relationship  is  possible.  Indeed  with  affective  disorders, 
psychotic symptoms are understood to arise when mood 
symptoms  are  most  severe,  eg,  in  psychotic  depression, 
yet they often co-occur at population level and in UHR 
samples in a manner not specific to diagnostic categories.9

Three Pathways to Depression in Schizophrenia

How are we to understand this varied picture of depression 
in schizophrenia? Birchwood argued that there are 3 dis-
tinct pathways: depression which is intrinsic to psychosis, 
depression which is a psychological reaction to the diagno-
sis and its implications for social status and position, and 
depression as “smoking gun evidence” of historical child-
hood  trauma.26  This  framework  seems  to  have  stood  the 
test of time. Trauma, neglect and social adversity are now 
well-established risk factors for schizophrenia.27 These fac-
tors also share risk for a variety of other disorders (includ-
ing  depression  itself)  and  for  this  reason  depression  may 
be  trans-diagnostic.  We  have  published  a  series  of  stud-
ies  examining  the  second  pathway.2,26,28–31  The  summary 
is  that  it  is  the  way  a  person  appraises  the  meaning  and 
significance of their psychotic experience, including their 
subordinate relationship to voices, or persecutors and the 
impact of the diagnosis on social status that underlies the 
development of depression. We have shown that this is the 
case even during the acute phases of illness where insight 
is not totally lost.2,26 Therefore, of Birchwood’s 3 pathways 
it is the first, depression as intrinsic to psychosis itself, that 
may now need further exploration.

If  we  move  to  accept  that  depression,  for  some  at 
least,  is  intrinsic  in  part  to  the  disorder  itself,  the  ques-
tion arises as to whether this occurs as part of a Fould’s 
hierarchy,  whereby  patients  exhibiting  symptoms  at  a 
given  level  must  also  display  symptoms  at  each  of  the 
lower  levels,32  whether  depression  a  manifestation  of 
their common aetiological factors, or indeed if there may 
be  a  more  causal  relationship.  Recent  evidence  shows 

242

that  first-episode  schizophrenia  and  first-episode  affec-
tive  psychosis  have  similar  changes  in  brain  structure, 
although  progressive  insular  grey  matter  loss  may  me 
more  pronounced  in  schizophrenia.33  Increase  in  stress 
reactivity seen in schizophrenia may be linked to inflam-
matory  and  structural  brain  changes.24  Hippocampal 
grey  matter  volume  (GMV)  reduction  is  found  in  uni-
polar depression, related to the duration of illness34 but 
is  also  seen  in  schizophrenia.  Inflammation  mediated 
effects on Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a 
proposed pathway for this effect.35 There is evidence that 
changes in circulating inflammatory markers and neuro-
trophins associated with the onset of depression are also 
seen  commonly  in  schizophrenia,36  with  evidence  that 
the presence schizophrenia and depression being specifi-
cally toxic; Noto recently demonstrated that IL-6, IL-4, 
IL-10, and TNFα were significantly higher in this patient 
group.37 In addition, recent studies by Chuang et al show 
that in depression, blunted affect, alogia and withdrawal 
are  inversely  associated  with  grey  matter  volume  in  the 
bilateral cerebellum whilst in schizophrenia, anhedonia, 
and avolition are inversely related to white-matter volume 
in the left anterior limb of internal capsule and positively 
in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus and key areas 
involved  in  the  processing  of  reward  anticipation.38  In 
functional  brain  imaging,  patients  with  depression  and 
schizophrenia show similarly enhanced brain response to 
fearful facial expressions, particularly in the thalamus, to 
those with affective psychosis.39 Regions critical to emo-
tional  processing  are  common  in  models  of  psychotic 
symptoms and include the hippocampus, insula and pre-
frontal cortex. These areas are implicated in both depres-
sion  with  psychosis  and  schizophrenia.40  In  broader 
terms  of  affective  instability,  there  is  some  convergence 
of  evidence  that  alterations  in  amygdala  activation  is 
involved in difficulty in emotional processing, salience to 
emotional stimuli, and behavioral response.23

Thus it is possible that depression (as a core dimension 
of psychosis) not only explains some of the commonality 
in biological findings across mood disorders and schizo-
phrenia,  but  provides  potential  aetiological  pathways. 
This may be particularly relevant when the most active ill-
ness process is ongoing, ie, during the early critical period 
when disease trajectories are set. We might suggest that 
depression  drives  forward  further  symptom  dimensions 
through  a  stress-inflammation-structural  brain  change 
pathway. This area is ripe for further investigation.

Treatment of Depression

Even though depression in schizophrenia is increasingly 
recognized  as  a  dimension  of  schizophrenia  psycho-
pathology,  clinically  it  remains  inadequately  treated.41 
More  than  15  years  have  passed  since  Siris  published 
“Depression in the era of atypical antipsychotic agents” 
with  the  recommendation  that  antipsychotic  dose 

reduction  or  changing  to  a  atypical  antipsychotic  may 
reduce the occurrence of depression.42 Yet the prevalence 
of  depression  in  schizophrenia  has  remained  high,  and 
rates  of  suicide  unaltered,  despite  the  wide  use  atypical 
antipsychotics,  suggesting  more  treatment  options  are 
needed.

Targeting  the  treatment  of  depression  in  early  psy-
chosis has the potential to reduce suffering, risk of sui-
cide  and  improve  functional  outcome,  yet  the  extent  of 
the effectiveness of existing treatments for depression in 
the  context  of  schizophrenia  is  unclear.  CBT  and  anti-
depressants  are  recommended  in  the  treatment  of  uni-
polar  depression  and,  in  the  recent  update  of  the  UK 
NICE  guidelines  for  schizophrenia  it  is  recommended 
this guidance be adhered to43; however, there is very little 
evidence for this assertion. Despite their frequent use on 
a pragmatic basis, there have been few sufficiently pow-
ered, randomized controlled trials of antidepressants for 
the  treatment  of  depression  in  schizophrenia,  although 
recent  meta-analysis  gives  some  limited  evidence  of 
effect.44  Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  for  psychosis 
(CBTp) has been the subject of much research in recent 
years, however has primarily focused on effectiveness for 
positive  symptoms, transition from high-risk status  and 
more  recently  on  distress.  No  CBTp  studies  have  used 
depression  as  a  primary  outcome  or  target  of  therapy. 
The  pervasive  presence  of  depression  in  schizophrenia 
and early phase psychosis, and the proposed role of affect 
dysregulation in the development of emerging psychotic 
thinking  on  the  one  hand  and  quality  of  life  in  estab-
lished psychosis on the other, underlines the urgent need 
for  treatment  trials.  We  cannot  assume  that  “standard” 
pharmacological  interventions  or  CBT  for  depression 
or would be effective. For example, as we have reviewed 
above, the content of depressive thinking in psychosis can 
include internalised stigma and entrapment by psychosis 
and intervention might therefore need to be augmented 
by practical steps to achieve mastery of the illness or of 
emancipating the individual from corrosive stigmatising 
stereotypes.2,28

Conclusion

There  are  probably  several  pathways  to  depression  in 
schizophrenia,  some  of  which  are  well  understood. 
Depression  in  schizophrenia  challenges  a  categorical 
and hierarchical diagnostic system. If we accept depres-
sion in schizophrenia is common, as our evidence would 
indicate, what are the implications for psychotic depres-
sion or schizoaffective disorder as diagnostic categories? 
This is open for debate, however, it is clear that the con-
cept of depression as a comorbidity of schizophrenia is 
a  misnomer;  its  role  may  well  be  much  more  profound. 
Depression is now recognized as occurring frequently in 
schizophrenia particularly as it develops in adolescence. 
It  is  significant  in  the  prediction  of  transition  to  FEP, 

Depression and Schizophrenia

poor  clinical  outcomes,  quality  of  life,  and  suicide.1,7,8,25 
Yet  all  this  has  not  been  translated  into  commensurate 
clinical recognition and to the resolution of uncertainties 
in  therapeutic  approaches.  FEP  sees  the  highest  rate  of 
decline in functioning, and high rates of depression, yet 
conversely  it  is  a  period  of  high  level  of  recovery  from 
positive symptoms. This underlines the need for focused 
interventions  outwith  positive  symptoms.  The  interplay 
of  depression  and  mood  instability  with  the  emergence 
of  delusions  and  hallucinations,  opens  up  the  prospect 
of trials targeting affective dysregulation and mood insta-
bility as a preventive maneuver. The current lack of evi-
dence for the treatment of depression in schizophrenia is 
the result of a lack of sufficient investigation, rather than 
lack of evidence of effect, and may result in a potential 
missed opportunity for effective intervention with poten-
tially wide consequences for the illness and its prevention. 
Trials of routine treatments for unipolar depression, with 
vs without adaption for the schizophrenia context should 
feature high on funders’ research priorities as this holds 
the  hope  of  a  significant  impact  on  recovery,  reducing 
levels of completed suicide, and patient suffering.
