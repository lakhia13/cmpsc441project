Abstract
Recent reports estimate that approximately 9% of adults globally identify as a sexual and gender minority (SGM), including 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ+) people. While research has shown that SGM populations experience 
health disparities, few studies have focused on cardiometabolic risk and outcomes, particularly with regard to diabetes and 
its sequelae. Using narrative review methods, we describe the epidemiology of cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes in 
SGM populations, with a focus on literature resulting from meta-analyses and analyses of large samples published between 
2017 and 2025. We also propose recommendations for follow-up and monitoring of metabolic and cardiovascular risk in 
SGM populations. Available data show varying risk for cardiometabolic conditions across SGM subpopulations. Studies 
of UK data have noted that sexual minority women have an increased risk of diabetes compared with heterosexual women, 
while data from the USA reveal ambiguous results depending on the data source. Transgender adults were found to be at 
increased risk for diabetes compared with cisgender comparators in UK data sources but not in US sources. For chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), risk varied by subpopulation and data source. Notably, SGM subpopulations in the UK were reported 
to have an increased risk of CKD while similar populations in the USA appear to have no difference in risk compared with 
cisgender, heterosexual comparators. Similarly, risk for CVD among sexual minority populations varied by data source. 
However, both US and UK data suggest that transgender adults are at increased risk of CVD. Subsequent research is needed 
to further characterise these disparities and longitudinal cohort studies must be explicitly inclusive of SGM populations. 
Ideally, SGM-specific longitudinal cohort studies should be executed to more accurately and effectively characterise cardio-
metabolic risk, outcomes and potential interventions in these populations.

Glossary of terms related to the study of sexual orientation and 
gender identity

Bisexual

Cisgender

Someone who experiences sexual, romantic, physical and/or spiritual attraction to 
people of their own gender as well as toward another gender (sometimes 
shortened to ‘bi’).

A term used to describe people whose gender identity is congruent with their sex 
assigned at birth.

Cisheteropatriarchy

A system of power and control that privileges cisgender, heterosexual men and 
masculinity, while marginalising and oppressing women, LGBTQ+ people and 
gender-non-conforming people.

Gay

Gender expression

Gender identity

Gender minority

Gender non-binary

Lesbian

Queer

Sex

A term used to describe boys/men who are attracted to boys/men, but often used 
and embraced by people with other gender identities to describe their same-
gender attractions and relationships as well. Often referred to as ‘homosexual’, 
although, given its overtly clinical and historically pathologising use, this term is no 
longer used by the majority of people with same-gender attractions [105].

The ways in which a person communicates femininity, masculinity, androgyny or 
other aspects of gender, often through speech, mannerisms, gait or style of dress. 
Everyone has ways in which they express their gender.

A person’s inner sense of being a girl/woman, a boy/man, a combination of 
girl/woman and boy/man or something else, or having no gender at all. Everyone 
has a gender identity.

A broad diversity of people who experience an incongruence between their 
gender identity and what is traditionally expected based on their sex assigned at 
birth, such as transgender and gender non-binary people.

A term used by some people who identify as a combination of girl/woman and 
boy/man, as something else or as having no gender. Often used interchangeably 
with ‘gender non-conforming’ and/or ‘genderqueer’.

Used to describe girls/women who are attracted to girls/women; applies for 
cisgender and transgender girls/women. Often referred to as ‘homosexual’, 
although this term is no longer used by the majority of women with same-gender 
attractions.

Historically a derogatory term used against LGBTQ+ people, it has been 
embraced and reclaimed by LGBTQ+ communities. Queer is often used to 
represent all individuals who identify outside of other categories of sexual and 
gender identity. Queer may also be used by an individual who feels as though 
other sexual or gender identity labels do not adequately describe their experience.

Biological sex characteristics (chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones and/or 
genitals); male, female, intersex. Synonymous with ‘sex assigned at birth’.

Sex assigned at birth Usually based on phenotypic presentation (i.e. genitals) of an infant and 

categorised as female or male; distinct from gender identity.

Sexual minority

Sexual orientation

Straight

A broad diversity of people who have a sexual orientation that is anything other 
than heterosexual/straight. Typically includes gay, bisexual, lesbian, queer or 
something else.

A person’s physical, emotional and romantic attachments in relation to gender. 
Conceptually separate from gender identity and gender expression. Everyone has 
a sexual orientation.

A boy/man or girl/woman who is attracted to people of the other binary gender 
than themselves; can refer to cisgender and transgender individuals. Often 
referred to as heterosexual.

Transgender man

Someone who identifies as male but was assigned female sex at birth.

Transgender woman

Someone who identifies as female but was assigned male sex at birth.

Introduction

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations account 
for 9% of adults globally (including lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender or queer [LGBTQ+] people) [1]; this propor-
tion is expected to grow as younger generations are more 
likely to identify as SGM than older people [1, 2]. Studies 
show that SGM populations experience health disparities 
[3], but few studies have focused on cardiometabolic condi-
tions [4–6]. Previous reviews of cardiometabolic health in 
SGM individuals describe conflicting results and suggest 
that, while SGM populations experience heightened burdens 
of cardiometabolic risk factors that vary across sexual orien-
tations and gender identities, their incidence of cardiometa-
bolic outcomes may not significantly differ from that in the 
population at large [4, 5, 7].

The current narrative review describes the epidemiology 
of cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes in SGM popu-
lations in the UK and USA, with a focus on literature result-
ing from meta-analyses and analyses of large data sources 
(e.g. national surveillance systems) published between 2017 
and 2025. In addition, we examine how limitations in study 
design may explain mixed findings regarding prevalence 
of diabetes, comorbidities and complications. The text box 
provides a glossary of terminology to facilitate a shared set 
of definitions related to the study of sexual orientation and 
gender identity.

Methods

Search strategy and included literature

We performed separate literature searches for the vari-
ous topics covered in this review; search strategies are 
provided in ESM Table 1. To keep the review focused 
and contemporary, we used PubMed as our primary data-
base and prioritised publications from 2017 to 2025 with 
large sample sizes or meta-analyses to reduce the bias that 
may arise when reporting results from single studies with 
small sample sizes. We limited our review to publications 
reporting results from studies conducted in the UK and 
USA. To compensate for using PubMed as our primary 

Diabetologia (2025) 68:2652–2669

database, we also reviewed the references cited in identi-
fied publications and included those that were relevant. As 
this is a broad narrative review covering several aspects of 
cardiometabolic health in SGM individuals, rather than a 
systematic review, there were no rigorous inclusion/exclu-
sion criteria. Thus, other publications could have been 
included; the publications included are frequently cited 
and were included to highlight the variation that exists in 
the current literature on these topics.

Conceptual model

Foregrounding the Black feminist frame of intersectional-
ity [8], our conceptual model (Fig. 1) depicts how intersec-
tional stigma and multilevel minority stress are connected 
to disparities in cardiometabolic risk factors and outcomes 
in SGM populations [4, 5, 9]. Briefly, one’s multiple dimen-
sions of positionality (e.g. race and ethnicity, sex, gender, 
sexual orientation, disability) are subjected to societal sys-
tems of privilege, power and oppression (e.g. cisheteropatri-
archy, structural racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia), 
producing intersectional stigma. The net effects of intersec-
tional stigma are manifested across socioecological levels 
and influence health behaviours, chronic stress and inflam-
mation, which shape blood glucose levels,  HbA1c, quality 
of life, and diabetes incidence, prevalence, comorbidities 
and complications. The model applies at both individual 
and population levels. When applying the model in pub-
lic health, expected outcomes are predicted to vary, with 
groups facing increasing levels of intersectional stigma (e.g. 
Black bisexual women) hypothesised to have worse health. 
Notably, structural, social and internalised stigma can be 
modified by resilience-promoting factors at multiple levels. 
Cardiometabolic health outcomes of a given individual or 
group should be viewed as the net effect of modifiable struc-
tural, social and individual processes that can be disrupted 
or supported to promote health equity. Despite the paucity of 
research regarding resilience and diabetes, related research 
in cardiovascular health has noted potential associations. As 
such, we have elected to ensure that resilience is incorpo-
rated in the conceptual model to encourage future study of 
this component of well-being.

Notably, intersectionality is a necessary component of 
the conceptual model, as risk factors and outcomes, as 
well as social determinants of health and other key soci-
odemographic factors, vary by racial and ethnic groups 
within SGM populations. Therefore, we report using our 
‘primary lens’ of SGM status but must highlight that we 
cannot capture the heterogeneity of findings in these popu-
lations without also addressing these additional intersec-
tional factors; SGM health is directly tied to the full, holis-
tic social position of SGM people within a given social 
context.

Fig. 1   Conceptual  model  of  intersectional  stigma  and  multilevel 
minority  stress  and  cardiometabolic  risk  factors  and  outcomes  in 
SGM  populations.  In  brief,  the  conceptual  model  depicts  intersec-
tional  stigmatisation  operating  dynamically  in  relation  to  resilience-
promoting  factors  at  structural,  interpersonal  and  individual  levels 
(nested  boxes)  that  influence  distal  and  proximal  minority  stressors. 
When  stigmatisation  rather  than  resilience  is  the  dominant  effect 
within  the  model  (as  generally  posited  for  SGM  populations),  the 
resulting net effect of intersectional stigmatisation contributes to poor 
SGM  population  health  and  health  disparities  via  minority  stress-

linked pathways of psychological distress and cardiometabolic behav-
ioural risk factors. These pathways contribute to clinical cardiometa-
bolic risk factors and outcomes. They also add to the higher chronic 
stress burden associated with the development of clinical cardiomet-
abolic  risk  factors  and  disparities,  including  diabetes  and  complica-
tions  onset  among  SGM  populations  with  intersecting  marginalised 
identities. When resilience is the dominant effect, the negative health 
effects  of  these  minority  stress  pathways  are  decreased,  resulting  in 
the  lessening  of  diabetes  risk  factors,  incidence  and  complications.

Results

Risk factors for diabetes

Modifiable risk factors for diabetes, including adiposity, 
poor-quality  diet  and  lack  of  physical  activity,  are  well 
established [10]. Studies also report associations between 
substance use, deficient sleep and HIV infection and diabetes 
incidence in the general population [10]. Consistent with 
our conceptual model, studies have shown that multilevel 
minority stress in SGM adults is associated with all of the 
aforementioned diabetes risk factors [11]. However, much of 
the literature assessing the association of sexual orientation 
and/or gender identity with diabetes risk factors focuses on 
this single dimension of positionality. Therefore, we report 
intersectional data when they exist but primarily focus on 
the distribution of diabetes risk factors in SGM populations 
compared with heterosexual and/or cisgender individuals 
overall. A summary of the following information on risk 
factors is displayed in Table 1.

BMI  Elevated BMI is the most common risk factor for type 
2 diabetes; 90% of adults in the UK and USA with diabetes 
have a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 [12]. A meta-analysis of 12 studies 
from the UK reported that both lesbian (OR [95% CI] 1.41 
[1.16, 1.72]) and bisexual (OR [95% CI] 1.24 [1.03, 1.48]) 
women were more likely to have overweight or obesity than 
heterosexual women, while gay men had a lower risk than 
heterosexual men (OR [95% CI] 0.72 [0.61, 0.85]) [13]. 
In the USA, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) data support the findings of this UK meta-analysis 
[14]. In contrast, the 2021 Health Survey for England found 
that a lower proportion of sexual minority adults were over-
weight or obese (51%) than heterosexual adults (63%) [15]. 
Additional data from the USA suggest that BMI in SGM 
populations may vary by race and ethnicity. Wave IV of 
the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health 
(Add Health) found no sexual orientation differences in 
BMI among Black/African American women, while White 
and Latina bisexual women were found to have a higher 
BMI than same race and ethnicity heterosexual individuals

[16]. However, in 2002–2016 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) data, Black and White 
lesbian women and bisexual women of all races/ethnicities 
had a higher BMI than White heterosexual women [17]. 
Among transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals, 
gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) may be linked 
to changes in obesity prevalence [4].

Diet  While SGM individuals and their heterosexual cisgen-
der peers have similar dietary behaviours, some SGM sub-
groups demonstrate differing dietary behaviours, patterns and 
quality as well as risk for disordered eating [18]. A study of 
UK adolescents reported that ‘mostly heterosexual’ boys and 
girls had approximately twice the risk of dieting, overeating 
and binge eating compared with ‘completely heterosexual’ 
adolescents of the same sex; that gay and bisexual boys had 
2.67 times the odds of dieting compared with heterosexual 
boys; and that lesbian and bisexual girls had 4.43 times the 
odds of binge eating compared with heterosexual girls [19]. 
Similar results were observed in a study of US college stu-
dents; this study also reported that transgender students had 
4.62 times the odds of a past-year eating disorder diagnosis 
compared with heterosexual cisgender female students [20]. 
The US-based Population Research in Identity and Dispari-
ties for Equality (PRIDE) study reported that, among gender-
queer/non-binary individuals and transgender men, lifetime 
use of appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs was 
associated with dietary restraint and binge eating [21]. Fur-
ther, 2003–2016 NHANES data demonstrate that moderate 
and severe food insecurity is 20–70% higher among sexual 
minority individuals compared with heterosexual peers [22]; 
these findings persisted after adjusting for multiple sociode-
mographic factors and are likely to be driven by higher rates 
of poverty and homelessness experienced in sexual minority 
compared with heterosexual adults [22].

Physical activity  Physical activity varies across SGM sub-
populations [18]. The UK Active Lives Survey 2022–2023 
found that 72% of gay/lesbian and 70% of bisexual adults 
completed 150+ min of moderate to vigorous physical activ-
ity per week compared with 64% of heterosexual adults [23]. 
Data on insured residents in Northern California revealed 
that sexual minority women engaged in more frequent physi-
cal activity at higher levels of intensity, and for an aver-
age of 13 min more per week, than heterosexual women, 
but  that,  although  sexual  minority  men  also  engaged  in 
physical activity more frequently than heterosexual men, 
the intensity level was lower [24]. In contrast, a systematic 
scoping review demonstrated that sexual minority women 
may have lower physical activity levels than heterosexual 
women due to homophobia and/or wider acceptance of a 
variety of body sizes (e.g. some butch women embracing 

a larger size) [25]. Further, while some sexual minority 
men had increased physical activity levels, to cultivate an 
‘ideal’ athletic body, other image classifications among gay 
men, such as ‘femme’, may suggest lower physical activity 
levels [25]. An NHANES analysis revealed no difference 
in physical activity levels among sexual minority adults 
compared  with  sex-matched  heterosexual  counterparts; 
these findings remained consistent across race and ethnicity 
[26]. Some evidence suggests that TGD individuals may be 
less active than their cisgender counterparts [27], possibly 
due to an increased risk of victimisation based on gender 
identity within team sport settings. However, a systematic 
review focused on TGD populations revealed that, despite 
the gendered nature of several team sports and sport facili-
ties, engaging in individual physical activities can promote 
further exercise when spaces are perceived as comfortable 
and accessible [28]. Finally, although not every TGD person 
desires or accesses transition-related health services, TGD 
individuals may participate in physical activities to achieve 
surgical candidacy [28] or as a result of a positive body 
image from GAHT [27].

Substance use: alcohol, tobacco and other drugs  Numerous 
studies demonstrate that SGM individuals, as a group, are at 
increased risk of dependence on tobacco, alcohol and other 
drugs compared with their non-SGM counterparts, but this 
risk may differ by sex, sexual orientation and gender identity 
[29–32]. A meta-analysis of 23 studies in the UK reported 
that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) adults had 1.26 and 
1.21 times the odds of smoking and high-frequency alcohol 
consumption, respectively, in unadjusted models compared 
with  heterosexual  adults  [32].  However,  in  sex-specific 
analyses, only LGB women had a greater odds of smoking 
compared with heterosexual female participants (OR [95% 
CI] 1.23 [1.05, 1.44]); there was no significant association 
between sexual orientation and substance use in men nor 
between  sexual  orientation  and  alcohol  consumption  in 
women. Data from the US National Health Interview Survey 
(NHIS) suggest that lesbian and bisexual women are more 
likely to smoke cigarettes and binge drink than heterosexual 
women, but these results differed by partnership status [33]. 
Regarding TGD populations, tobacco use is higher among 
TGD populations than cisgender individuals and transgender 
men may exhibit heavier episodic drinking than cisgender 
populations [29]. Multiple studies show that transgender 
men may also have a higher risk of alcohol use disorders 
than transgender women [29]. Illicit drug use and prescrip-
tion drug misuse is also higher among TGD individuals than 
the general US population [29]. Most research on illicit drug 
use among TGD populations has focused on transgender 
women, showing elevated use of several drugs, especially 
methamphetamine, compared with transgender men [29].

Sleep  Poor sleep quality is associated with several adverse 
health risks [34] and findings on sleep health and related behav-
iours in SGM subpopulations are mixed [35]. The majority of 
studies reveal that sexual minority adults have more sleep dis-
turbances and a lower quality of sleep than heterosexual adults 
[35]. In a UK study of adolescents, both gender minority and 
sexual minority adolescents had worse sleep patterns than their 
heterosexual cisgender peers, with gender minority adolescents 
displaying the poorest sleep patterns [36]. Consistent results 
were observed in an analysis of 2013–2017 US NHIS data, 
which found that sexual minority individuals across all racial 
and ethnic categories had more trouble staying asleep than 
heterosexual peers [37]. However, some studies reveal higher 
sleep quality in gay men than heterosexual men, while other 
studies demonstrate shorter periods of sleep and greater sleep 
disturbances for gay men [35]. A narrative review highlighting 
limitations among sleep research focused on SGM individu-
als reported the use of overlapping secondary datasets, cen-
tring research on sleep quality as opposed to other important 
sleep factors (e.g. sleep apnoea, hypersomnia), and few studies 
including gender minority individuals, rather than just sexual 
minority individuals [35]. Despite the paucity of literature, poor 
sleep quality has been a consistent finding among transgender 
women and men [35, 38]. Further, gender non-conforming indi-
viduals have reportedly shorter sleep periods (≤5 h/day) than 
other cisgender and transgender subgroups [34].

HIV  With antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with 
HIV (PLWH) are ageing well but also at risk of developing 
chronic conditions, including diabetes. HIV and exposure to 
ART regimens may place PLWH at higher risk for diabetes; 
the association between ART and diabetes incidence may be 
mediated through ART-induced weight gain [39, 40]. HIV 
disparities impact a variety of SGM subpopulations and, 
as such, diabetes risk may be concomitantly heightened in 
these populations. Among PLWH, sexual minority men and 
transgender women are disproportionately impacted; sexual 
minority men comprised 71% of new HIV infections in the 
USA in 2022 [41] and 36.5% of all new HIV diagnoses in 
2021 in the UK [42], and it was estimated that, in 2022, the 
global risk of acquiring HIV among transgender women was 
20 times higher than that among the general adult popula-
tion [42]. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported 
that, in the USA, an estimated 44% of Black transgender 
women have HIV, significantly higher than that of White 
transgender women (6.7%) and transgender women of other 
races and ethnicities (9.8%) [43]. This staggering inequity is 
a concrete example of UNAIDS’ finding that HIV dispari-
ties—and thus potential HIV-associated diabetes risk—are 
worsened among minoritised individuals across the globe 
[44]. Therefore, an intersectional lens is recommended when 
considering the link between HIV and metabolic health 
among SGM individuals.

Inflammation and stress  While prior studies have reported 
that under-represented racial and ethnic groups have higher 
chronic inflammation levels and greater risks for chronic 
conditions tied to discrimination [45], there have been lim-
ited investigations in SGM populations. A review found that 
social stigma, such as exclusion, denigration and rejection, 
towards SGM people can promote systemic inflammation 
[46]. The few studies that have characterised inflammation in 
SGM populations have reported high levels of inflammatory 
markers (e.g. C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6) [47], attributed 
to stress and discrimination [47]. High inflammation levels 
can decrease adiponectin levels and lead to insulin resistance 
[48], which is associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk. 
For TGD populations, testosterone may increase levels of 
proinflammatory cytokines and cardiometabolic risk [49]. 
As with HIV, future studies should investigate inflammatory 
markers among SGM populations with intersecting margin-
alised identities.

Diabetes in SGM populations

Despite disparities in cardiometabolic risk factors, there is 
disagreement in published literature about whether SGM 
populations have a higher prevalence of diabetes than non-
SGM counterparts (Table 2); in addition, to our knowledge, 
no large studies of diabetes in SGM populations have dis-
tinguished between type 1 and type 2 diabetes [50–54]. The 
majority of diabetes prevalence estimates are derived from 
US data and meta-analyses thereof. However, data from 
the UK-based GP Patient Survey estimate that, as a group, 
sexual minority women have 1.2 times the odds of prevalent 
diabetes compared with heterosexual women [53]; driven by 
estimates in bisexual and other queer women rather than gay/
lesbian women (Table 2), this is consistent with the concep-
tual model (Fig. 1), which would expect to see higher rates 
of diabetes among marginalised populations. In contrast, 
UK-based GP Patient Survey data do not indicate that sexual 
minority men as a group have an increased prevalence of 
diabetes compared with heterosexual men, although bisexual 
and other queer men have an increased diabetes prevalence 
compared with heterosexual men (Table 2) [53].

Much of the US data arise from analyses of BRFSS 
data, which incorporate survey weights so that results are 
representative of the US population. Results suggest that, 
in aggregate, sexual minority adults have a 10% greater 
odds  of  diabetes  prevalence  than  heterosexual  adults 
(Table 2) [30], although in race-stratified analyses this 
association was significant only in non-Hispanic White 
individuals. Sex-specific analyses suggest the opposite to 
the findings of the GP Patient Survey such that sexual 
minority men, but not women, had an increased diabe-
tes prevalence compared with their heterosexual counter-
parts. Similarly, conflicting results are observed for TGD

individuals, with GP Patient Survey data showing that 
TGD adults had 1.2 times the odds of prevalent diabe-
tes compared with cisgender adults [52], and BRFSS data 
showing that, compared with cisgender men, transgen-
der women had no difference in diabetes prevalence and 
transgender men had a decreased diabetes prevalence [55].
Epidemiological studies investigating diabetes using 
objective measures (e.g. diabetes medication use,  HbA1c) 
have found related disparities impacting sexual minority 
women. In the Nurses’ Health Study II, sexual minority 

women had a significantly earlier age of diabetes onset 
than heterosexual peers [56]. The US-based Add Health 
cohort study found that women who reported same-sex 
sexual attraction and/or sexual minority sexual identity in 
both adolescence and adulthood were more likely to have 
prevalent diabetes than their heterosexual female counter-
parts [57]. However, studies conducted using electronic 
health record (EHR) data from the All of Us study in the 
USA have found a lower diabetes prevalence among SGM 
than non-SGM participants (Table 2) [52]. The variation 

 
Diabetologia (2025) 68:2652–2669 

2661

in  these  findings  may  be  due  in  part  to  differences  in 
study samples, study designs, data sources (e.g. EHR vs 
self-report) and methodology and, generally, the use of 
small sample sizes.

Given that many studies report that SGM individuals 
are less likely to access healthcare due to lack of health 
insurance, inability to pay and fear of poor-quality treat-
ment, SGM individuals may be less likely to be aware that 
they have diabetes [58, 59]. Studies using only self-report 
data to assess diabetes prevalence (e.g. BRFSS, NHIS) 
in populations with less access to healthcare are biased 
towards undercounting diabetes cases and towards null 
findings [60, 61]. Studies that include both self-report of 
diabetes and laboratory testing (e.g. fasting plasma blood 
glucose,  HbA1c) at the population level may help overcome 
this weakness. In addition, although EHR data contain 
objective  measures  of  glycaemic  status,  only  individu-
als who have gained access to healthcare, disclosed their 
SGM status to healthcare providers and had their SGM 
data  recorded  within  their  EHR  would  be  classified  as 
SGM in the data. Although studies investigating diabetes 
in safety-net healthcare systems can help address some of 
these issues, studies seeking to describe potential diabetes 
disparities in SGM populations in EHR datasets may be 
biased toward the null.

Finally, with over 90% of all diabetes cases attribut-
able to type 2 diabetes, and a higher incidence of type 
2 diabetes among adults aged 45 and older, most stud-
ies investigating diabetes disparities in SGM populations 
are subject to analytical limitations, as they often do not 
account for differences in the mean age of SGM compared 
with non-SGM populations. In nearly all epidemiological 
surveillance and EHR studies conducted to date, SGM par-
ticipants have been significantly younger than their non-
SGM counterparts [52].

Outcomes following diabetes

Diabetes is an established risk factor for CVD (i.e. myocar-
dial infarction [MI] and stroke); people with diabetes are 
twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke compared 
with those without the condition. Chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) is also a common long-term complication of dia-
betes. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimates that one-third of adults with diabetes have 
or will develop CKD [62]; Diabetes UK puts this figure 
at 40% [63]. Below, we present what is currently known 
about prevalent CVD and CKD in SGM populations; there 
is a dearth of literature on incident CVD and CKD in SGM 
individuals.

CVD: MI and stroke  Several studies report excess CVD 
risk in sexual minority adults compared with heterosexual 

peers, but whether they have a greater prevalence of CVD 
events is unclear (Table 3). Conflicting results likely arise 
due to ascertainment of sexual orientation (self-reported 
or identified via natural language processing) and his-
tory of CVD events (self-reported or based on diagnosis 
codes). Mereish et al found that mastery, one’s sense of 
control over one’s life, mediated the association between 
minority stressors and CVD risk in an SGM population, 
such  that  increased  minority  stressors  decreased  one’s 
sense of mastery, which was then associated with greater 
CVD risk [64], a finding that is consistent with our con-
ceptual model (Fig. 1).

The prevalence and incidence of CVD among TGD 
adults has been investigated more than CVD among sex-
ual minority adults. While early studies found no associa-
tion between GAHT and MI incidence and mortality risk 
[65, 66], subsequent studies consistently demonstrated an 
increased prevalence of CVD among transgender women 
receiving  GAHT  [67];  such  results  were  likely  due  to 
use  of  ethinyloestradiol  as  GAHT  among  transgender 
women [68]. Since ethinyloestradiol has been replaced 
by lower dose transdermal or oral bioidentical oestro-
gen, an increased prevalence of CVD among transgen-
der women receiving GAHT has not been demonstrated 
compared with transgender women not receiving GAHT 
[68].  Regardless  of  GAHT  use,  data  from  the  BRFSS 
consistently demonstrate that transgender women have 
an increased prevalence of CHD, stroke and MI compared 
with cisgender women and an increased prevalence of any 
CVD compared with cisgender men [61, 69]; gender non-
conforming adults have increased odds of MI vs cisgender 
women [61]; and transgender men have 2.5 and 4.9 times 
the odds of MI compared with cisgender men and cisgen-
der women, respectively [69]. Data from the US Veterans 
Healthcare Administration suggest that TGD veterans’ 
CVD risk is greater than that of cisgender women but 
lower than that of cisgender men and that, among TGD 
veterans, receipt of masculinising GAHT is associated 
with decreased CVD risk but feminising GAHT is not 
associated with CVD risk [70]. A 2024 meta-analysis of 
22 studies reported that the overall incidence of CVD 
(stroke,  MI  or  thrombosis)  was  greater  in  transgender 
women than cisgender men and in transgender men than 
cisgender  women.  However,  these  associations  were 
driven largely by the associations between gender iden-
tity and thrombosis, as the 95% CIs for MI and stroke 
included the null value of 1.0 [71].

Chronic kidney disease  Few studies have investigated CKD 
disparities impacting SGM populations (Table 4) but most 
report an increased prevalence of CKD in SGM individu-
als compared with similar heterosexual cisgender individu-
als. Results from All of Us are a notable exception; in this

study, most associations were null or suggested that sexual 
minority women and gender-diverse individuals assigned 
male at birth were at lower risk of CKD than heterosexual 
women and men, respectively (Table 4) [52]. However, these 
results may be driven by the significantly younger mean age 
of sexual minority women and gender-diverse people com-
pared with the mean ages of other groups [52]. Analysis of 
2014–2019 BRFSS data showed that older sexual minority 
men were more likely to report CKD than similarly aged 
heterosexual men; this disparity was attenuated after adjust-
ment for diabetes status [72], suggesting that CKD dispari-
ties may be rooted in a higher prevalence of diabetes in SGM 
individuals. In a cross-sectional study of TGD individuals, 
the estimated prevalence of CKD was found to be 36% [73], 
more than twice the CKD prevalence (15%) in the general 
US and UK populations. Interestingly, the prevalence of 
CKD was greater in transgender men and women who were 
not receiving GAHT than in those who were. These results 
are in contrast to studies which observed that creatinine 
significantly decreased over the first year of GAHT usage 
among transgender women, yet significantly increased over 
the same time period in transgender men [74, 75]. Because 
GAHT may impact creatinine, GFR should be measured 
directly rather than estimated to accurately guide clinical 
decision-making among TGD individuals [67].

Diabetes complications and quality of care

Diabetes leads to severe complications that affect quality 
of life, particularly because of the impact on vasculature 
and functional and cognitive disability. Fortunately, these 
complications can be delayed or entirely prevented with 
good glycaemic and comorbidity management. Successful 
management of diabetes requires improvement in self-man-
agement skills, retention in healthcare, access to pharmaco-
logical interventions, and addressing psychosocial issues. 
However, SGM individuals face several barriers that affect 
successful diabetes management.

Structural factors hinder SGM individuals from accessing 
or engaging with care. SGM individuals experience higher 
rates of poverty than non-SGM populations [76], and fre-
quently face policies that discriminate against them [77], 
affecting healthcare access. In the USA, SGM adults living 
in jurisdictions without non-discrimination laws have lower 
health insurance coverage than their non-SGM counterparts 
[78]. Policies can limit the ability of SGM individuals to 
share insurance as well as involve SGM partners in their care 
[79]. The latter is especially relevant when considering that 
people with diabetes are at risk of rapid-onset life-threaten-
ing emergencies where cognition is severely affected or in 
settings of end-stage disease that require management within

intensive nursing or palliative care facilities. Policies also 
create stigmatising environments associated with increased 
risk of victimisation [80] and adverse health outcomes [81]. 
These issues are further complicated by immigration poli-
cies that limit access to insurance and care. Finally, many 
areas criminalise SGM identities, leading to direct harm and 
stress. These laws also force people not to reveal their sexual 
orientation and to delay or forego healthcare [82].

In addition to these structural issues, SGM individu-
als experience interpersonal discrimination in healthcare 
interactions [83], including healthcare encounters in which 
they are assumed to be straight and/or cisgender [84]. To 
maintain their safety, SGM individuals sometimes need to 
conceal their identity, which disrupts the patient–physician 
relationship [83]. As a result, SGM people avoid seeking 
care due to anticipated or experienced discrimination in 
healthcare [85], resulting in many not receiving essential 
healthcare [86], including screening for diabetes [87].

In addition to the high likelihood that SGM people with 
diabetes have issues receiving healthcare [88], an analysis 
of EHR data showed that transgender men and women with 
diabetes were less likely to receive  HbA1c re-testing than 
cisgender men with diabetes [88]. It was also reported that 
sexual minority women with diabetes were less likely to 
receive  HbA1c re-testing than gay men. Further, both sexual 
minority women and heterosexual men were less likely to 
achieve  HbA1c <75 mmol/mol (<9%) than gay men [88]. A 
common theme in the research on quality of diabetes care 
is the heterogeneity of outcomes by sexual orientation and 

gender identity, highlighting the importance of stratifying 
results when possible. There are very few publications on 
risk of diabetes complications outside studies on CKD and 
CVD.

Interventions

Interventions for diabetes rely on providing education and 
coaching on lowering BMI and achieving glycaemic con-
trol through self-management practices. However, self-man-
agement techniques for diabetes can be difficult to execute, 
particularly without social support [89]. For many, including 
SGM individuals, successful health outcomes require social 
support [89]. In the USA, the National LGBT Health Educa-
tion Center recommends community support through social 
interaction for diabetes management and prevention [90], such 
as support groups where SGM participants can exchange infor-
mation on providers and encourage healthy practices, such as 
walking or running groups.

To our knowledge, there are few diabetes management or 
prevention efforts centred on SGM people. Existing diabe-
tes interventions for SGM individuals should be multilevel, 
similar to smoking cessation programmes for SGM people 
[91]. Community-centred elements that improve intervention 
success include using SGM community members for inter-
vention implementation and providing space for discussing 
unique factors affecting behaviour. Furthermore, interven-
tions that account for multiple risk factors may be able to 
address  several  risks  simultaneously  through  integrated

strategies.  Taking  a  gender-inclusive  vs  gender-specific 
approach to understanding shared vs unique risk factors, 
respectively, per gender group is a necessary part of devel-
oping interventions in this area. Risk reduction programmes 
for TGD populations, for example, that address HIV risk and 
substance use while also targeting transphobic structural and 
social factors unique to this population and its subgroups can 
be effective at providing education and promoting healthy 
behaviours.

Discussion

Summary

This narrative review reveals significant variation in cardio-
metabolic risk and outcomes among SGM subpopulations. 
Studies of UK data find that sexual minority women have an 
increased risk of diabetes compared with heterosexual women, 
while data from the USA reveal ambiguous results based on 
data source. Transgender adults were found to be at increased 
risk for diabetes compared with cisgender comparators in UK 
data sources but not in the USA. For CKD, risk varied by sub-
population and data source. Notably, SGM subpopulations in 
the UK were reported to have an increased risk of CKD while 
similar populations in the USA appear to have no difference 
in risk compared with cisgender, heterosexual comparators. 
Similarly, risk for CVD among sexual minority populations 
varied by data source. However, both US and UK data suggest 
that transgender adults are at increased risk of CVD.

Practical and methodological limitations 
of evidence to date

Although we included data from the UK where possible, 
most of the data describing the cardiometabolic health of 
SGM populations comes from US-based samples; data from 
countries outside the UK and USA are even more limited. 
This lack of UK data combined with cultural and structural 
differences between the UK and the USA, largely arising 
from differences in healthcare systems and access, limit 
the generalisability of these findings to UK individuals and 
make it hard to compare findings across countries. Further, 
given the recent political shift in the USA, particularly Exec-
utive Order 14168 and the cancellation of federally funded 
grants focused on SGM health, the future of research on 
this topic in the USA is uncertain [92, 93]. It is imperative 
that non-US researchers aid in moving this research forward.
In addition to the practical challenges researchers face 
when studying SGM health, there are also methodological 
limitations to consider. Most SGM research relies on cross-
sectional data analysis and assessment of disease prevalence 
rather than longitudinal data analysis, which would enable 
the assessment of disease incidence. This lack of data on 

incident diabetes and development of CVD and CKD follow-
ing a diabetes diagnosis prevents us from drawing conclu-
sions surrounding temporality. The findings of this review 
highlight the need for longitudinal cohort data in which sex-
ual orientation and gender identity are self-reported and car-
diometabolic diagnoses are objectively ascertained through 
chart review to close these gaps in knowledge and aid in the 
identification of intervention points to lessen disparities in 
SGM health. However, the proportion of SGM individuals in 
cohort studies is typically low and often too small to ensure 
adequate statistical power to detect true significant differ-
ences. In the absence of cohort data, longitudinal analysis 
of EHRs with cardiometabolic outcomes ascertained via 
diagnosis codes may show promise.

However, while EHRs resolve sample size concerns, they 
have their own limitations. Individuals identified as SGM in 
EHRs are younger, on average, than individuals identified as 
heterosexual cisgender [70, 94–97]. Failure to adjust for age 
then leads to biased results, and even covariate adjustment for 
age may be inadequate to fully account for age differences 
between groups if the age distribution is sufficiently disparate 
between groups. Thus, creation of a nested age-matched sam-
ple may be necessary to eliminate the confounding effect of 
age. Further, EHRs typically contain little to no information 
on social determinants of health and, as SGM populations are 
disproportionately affected by lower socioeconomic status, 
income and healthcare access [98, 99], inadequate adjustment 
for these confounders may obscure the specific impact of sex-
ual orientation and gender identity on outcomes.

Finally, although we reviewed and included data from 
meta-analyses, it is important to note that some of the esti-
mates included in the meta-analyses were based on compari-
sons where the SGM group under study had fewer than ten 
events, which may have biased the results [51, 100]. Meta-
regressions that adjust for study characteristics may help 
reduce some of this bias.

Future directions and conclusion

There is an urgent need for research into sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, and cardiometabolic risk and, subse-
quently, tailored interventions that consider the intersecting 
social locations and systems of oppression that shape the 
challenges and needs of SGM communities. Future research 
must include SGM populations in the design while also 
including sexual orientation and gender identity data in the 
routine collection of demographic characteristics of study 
samples. Additionally, research that considers both general 
and SGM-specific vulnerabilities and identifies health-pro-
moting resiliencies should inform future intervention targets, 
which must be adapted to the needs of SGM subpopula-
tions. Finally, SGM health content should be included in 

2666

the training, accreditation and qualification requirements for 
health professions [101, 102]. There are exciting opportuni-
ties for future research and clinical and public health efforts 
to better understand and reduce cardiometabolic disparities 
among SGM people.
