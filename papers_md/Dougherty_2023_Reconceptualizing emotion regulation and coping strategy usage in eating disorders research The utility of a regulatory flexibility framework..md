Abstract

Objective:  Emotion regulation and coping strategies are often conceptualized in eating disorder 
(ED) research as inherently adaptive or maladaptive, and successful regulation is often defined as 
greater overall use of adaptive strategies. However, recent empirical work outside of the field of 
EDs challenges this categorical conceptualization of strategies, demonstrating that adaptiveness is 
determined by the ability to flexibly implement and adjust strategies based on contextual demands 
(i.e., regulatory flexibility). Despite evidence that emotion regulation and coping strategies are best 
conceptualized in terms of flexibility in the broader literature, few ED studies have adopted this 
model.

Method:  We review the current conceptual framework of emotion regulation and coping 
strategies used in ED research and present regulatory flexibility as an alternative approach to 
conceptualizing these strategies.

Results:  Lack of research on regulatory flexibility among individuals with EDs limits our 
understanding of the role of emotion regulation and coping difficulties in ED risk and 
maintenance. Adopting a regulatory flexibility model of strategies in EDs may extend knowledge 
of the role of emotion regulation difficulties in the development and maintenance of EDs.

Discussion:  We highlight the potential utility of investigating regulatory flexibility and present 
recommendations for future research on regulatory flexibility in EDs.

Research in eating disorders (EDs) often conceptualizes emotion regulation (ER) and 
coping strategies as inherently adaptive or maladaptive (Leppanen et al., 2022). However, 
this conceptualization is inconsistent with evidence that the adaptability of strategies is 
contextually dependent (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). In this paper, we argue in favor of 
an alternative conceptualization of ER and coping strategy usage in ED research, namely 
regulatory flexibility. We will: (a) discuss the conceptual framework of ER and coping 
strategies most commonly used in ED research, (b) introduce an alternative conceptual 
framework (regulatory flexibility), (c) highlight the utility of adopting a regulatory flexibility 
framework in ED research, and (d) offer directions for future research.

Current Conceptual Framework of Regulatory Strategies in ED Research

ER and coping strategies aim to modify emotions or alter stressors that prompt emotional 
responses (Compas et al., 2014). Table 1 depicts commonly investigated strategies in ED 
research. EDs are associated with an overreliance on putatively maladaptive ER and coping 
strategies (Perthes et al., 2021; Prefit et al., 2019; Trompeter et al., 2021). Individuals with 
EDs also report less frequent use of putatively adaptive strategies compared to individuals 
without EDs (Svaldi et al., 2012). Putatively maladaptive strategies (i.e., methods used 
to regulate emotions; Koole, 2009) are considered less effective in modulating emotions, 
resulting in emotion dysregulation (i.e., an emotional experience/expression pattern that 
impedes appropriate behavior; Beauchaine, 2015). In contrast, putatively adaptive strategies 
are considered more effective in modulating emotions, resulting in improved ER (Aldao 
et al., 2010). Theoretical models conceptualize ED behaviors as maladaptive attempts to 
regulate emotions, which may be used in the absence of adaptive strategies (Heatherton & 
Baumeister, 1991). Collectively, this supports the use of interventions to replace maladaptive 
strategies with adaptive strategies.

Research on regulatory strategy usage in EDs primarily adopts a categorical 
conceptualization of strategies, which assumes that strategies are inherently adaptive or 
maladaptive (Prefit et al., 2019). Aligned with this conceptualization of strategies, evidence-
based treatments for EDs (e.g., Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT-E]) focus on 
decreasing the use of maladaptive strategies and increasing the use of adaptive strategies 
(Fairburn, 2008). Although these treatments generally lead to improvements in ER and 
coping, individuals with high emotion dysregulation have poorer treatment outcomes 
compared to those with low emotion dysregulation (Brown et al., 2020; Cassioli et al., 
2022), suggesting that this method of addressing regulatory deficits may be insufficient.

Regulatory Flexibility: An Alternative Conceptualization of Regulatory 

Strategies

The assumption that ER and coping strategies are inherently adaptive or maladaptive is 
inconsistent with evidence showing that the adaptability of regulatory strategies depends on 
the context (defined as an event, situational feature, or internal characteristic) in which they 
are implemented (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). Context shapes ER processes, including the 
selection of regulatory strategies (De France & Hollenstin, 2022; Del Palacio-Gonzalez & 
O’Toole, 2022; Koval et al., 2023; Socastro et al., 2022; Wenzel et al., 2022; Wylie et al.,

2023), and the effectiveness of a particular strategy in modulating emotions varies across 
contexts (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). For example, reappraisal, which involves reinterpreting 
the meaning of a stressor (e.g., focusing on the potential benefits of a breakup), requires 
cognitive functions that are impaired during strong emotional states (Pessoa, 2009; Silvers et 
al., 2015). Thus, it may be effective in regulating low-intensity emotional distress, but less 
effective in regulating high-intensity emotional distress (Sheppes & Meiran, 2007; Sheppes 
et al., 2014). Problem-solving, which aims to alter a stressor, may be effective when dealing 
with controllable stressors (e.g., an exam), but detrimental when dealing with uncontrollable 
stressors (e.g., a terminal illness; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Given the importance of 
context in determining the efficacy of strategies, there is growing consensus that adaptive 
ER and coping do not involve merely using “adaptive” strategies, but rather, flexibly varying 
strategies in synchrony with changing contextual demands (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). 
Accordingly, ER research is moving away from a categorical conceptualization of strategies 
and towards a more dimensional conceptualization of regulatory flexibility.

According to a regulatory flexibility framework, adaptive regulatory strategy usage is 
characterized by the ability to flexibly deploy strategies in accordance with changing 
contextual demands (i.e., greater regulatory flexibility). In contrast, maladaptive regulatory 
strategy usage is characterized by the implementation of context-inappropriate strategies 
(e.g., using re-appraisal to regulate high-intensity emotional distress) and the rigid 
implementation of strategies across contexts (i.e., lower regulatory flexibility; Aldao et al., 
2015; Bonanno & Burton, 2013). Regulatory flexibility overlaps conceptually with other 
self-regulation constructs (e.g., psychological flexibility) that share a common emphasis 
on modifying emotions (Bond et al., 2011; Gratz & Roemer, 2004); however, it can be 
distinguished by its specific focus on the ability to switch between regulatory strategies 
based on contextual demands.

Evidence suggests that regulatory flexibility may be more important for well-being than 
the use of discrete strategies (Bonanno & Burton, 2013). Low regulatory flexibility 
is linked to maladaptive affective consequences (Battaglini et al., 2022) and multiple 
forms of psychopathology, including anxiety, depression (Cheng et al., 2021), and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Rodin et al., 2017). Adopting a regulatory flexibility 
framework has advanced our understanding of etiological mechanisms in affective disorders. 
For example, low regulatory flexibility may enhance susceptibility to developing PTSD 
following trauma exposure (Levy-Gigi et al., 2016) and play a role in maintaining depressive 
and anxiety symptoms (Chen & Bonanno, 2021;Goodman et al., 2021). To date, research 
has predominantly investigated regulatory flexibility in the context of negative emotions. 
Research is needed to clarify the contribution of low regulatory flexibility to positive 
emotion dysregulation and risk for psychopathology.

Regulatory flexibility has been measured using validated self-report questionnaires (e.g., 
Coping Flexibility Scale; Flexible Regulation of Emotion Expression Scale; Burton & 
Bonanno, 2016; Kato, 2012), performance-based laboratory paradigms (e.g., ER choice task, 
expressive flexibility paradigm; Bonanno et al., 2004; Sheppes et al., 2011), and ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Battaglini et al., 2022). EMA is ideally suited 
for studying regulatory flexibility because it can capture within-person fluctuations in

strategy use across diverse contexts (English & Eldesouky, 2020). Notably, regulatory 
flexibility is operationalized inconsistently, with some studies defining it as the degree of 
covariation between change in strategy usage and change in context (Haines et al., 2016) 
and others defining it as variability in strategies (Cheng et al., 2014). Thus, there is a need 
for more consistency in the operationalization of regulatory flexibility (for a more extensive 
discussion, see Aldao et al., 2015).

The Utility of a Regulatory Flexibility Framework in ED Research

Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of regulatory flexibility in 
the broader ER literature, research on regulatory flexibility in EDs is sparse. Individuals 
with EDs show deficits in processes that support the flexible implementation of strategies, 
providing indirect evidence of a link between low regulatory flexibility and EDs (Tchanturia 
et al., 2012). Specifically, individuals with EDs show deficits in interoceptive awareness and 
self-regulatory abilities (e.g., psychological flexibility, access to ER strategies), which may 
interfere with their ability to tailor strategies to contextual demands (Cobos-Sánchez et al., 
2020; Levin et al., 2014; Prefit et al., 2019;Trompeter et al., 2021;Wollast et al., 2022). 
Individuals with EDs also display trait-level cognitive rigidity and deficits in cognitive 
flexibility, which may interfere with their ability to adjust strategies in accordance with 
changing contextual demands (Tchanturia et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2021). To date, only 
one study has directly investigated regulatory flexibility and ED symptoms in a nonclinical 
sample of women (Dougherty et al., 2020). This study found that low flexibility in ER 
strategy usage was associated with greater frequency of compensatory behaviors, supporting 
the relevance of regulatory flexibility to ED behaviors.

The lack of research on regulatory flexibility among individuals with EDs limits our 
understanding of the role of ER and coping difficulties in ED risk and maintenance. 
Although it is established that individuals with EDs have deficits in self-regulation and 
implement putatively maladaptive strategies, little is known about their ability to accurately 
identify contextual demands or synchronize regulation efforts with contextual demands 
(Levin et al., 2014; Perthes et al., 2021). Investigating regulatory flexibility in EDs may 
contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the role of maladaptive regulatory responses 
in the development and maintenance of EDs.

Discussion

Directions for Future Research

Regulatory Flexibility and ED Onset—Research suggests that ER difficulties increase 
risk for the development of EDs (McClure et al., 2022). However, it is unclear whether 
deficits in regulatory flexibility predict later development of ED symptoms. To investigate 
this, researchers could add measures of regulatory flexibility to community-based cohort 
studies investigating predictors of health outcomes across the lifespan. Regulatory flexibility 
may be especially important during adolescence, a developmental period characterized 
by heightened stress (Núñez-Regueiro & Núñez-Regueiro, 2021) and increased risk for 
ED onset (Stice et al., 2009). Longitudinal methods also could be used to investigate 
whether low regulatory flexibility during adolescence predicts ED symptoms due to poor

emotional adjustment to stress. Ultimately, research aimed at understanding the predictive 
links between regulatory flexibility and ED onset may inform prevention efforts during key 
at-risk periods.

Regulatory Flexibility and ED Maintenance—Stress-induced elevations in negative 
emotions precede the occurrence of ED behaviors, supporting the use of interventions to 
replace ED behaviors with putatively adaptive strategies (Strivasta et al., 2021). However, 
if individuals are not able to tailor strategies to contextual demands or flexibly adjust 
strategies in accordance with contextual changes, they may experience prolonged emotional 
distress following stressful events, despite broadening their repertoire of putatively adaptive 
strategies. Research should investigate whether individuals with low regulatory flexibility 
experience a less pronounced reduction in negative affect over time following stressful 
events, subsequently enhancing their vulnerability to engaging in ED behaviors. Importantly, 
difficulties regulating positive emotions are also theorized to play a role in maintaining 
EDs (Coniglio et al., 2019), underscoring the necessity of going beyond negative affect 
and exploring whether low regulatory flexibility similarly contributes to positive emotion 
dysregulation.

EMA is well-suited to investigate these questions, as researchers can capture both proximal 
and distal temporal changes in regulatory strategies and emotions over time. This may 
be especially useful when investigating ED behaviors, as they may successfully modulate 
emotions in the short-term but exacerbate distress in the long-term (Wedig & Nock, 2010; 
Wonderlich et al., 2022). Regulatory flexibility itself also comes at a cost (e.g., uses 
attentional resources) that may vary across time (e.g., when someone is well-rested versus 
fatigued; Toh & Yang, 2023). Consistent with recommendations by Aldao et al. (2015) and 
previous studies (e.g., Battaglini et al., 2022), researchers could operationalize regulatory 
flexibility as intraindividual covariation between regulatory strategy usage and contextual 
factors (e.g., by regressing strategy variability onto change in context). Researchers could 
also investigate whether this operationalization of regulatory flexibility has predictive 
validity in ED samples.

Regulatory Flexibility and ED Treatment—Evidence supporting the relevance of 
regulatory flexibility to EDs may indicate the utility of its integration in existing evidence-
based treatments. Future studies may investigate the effectiveness of modified treatments 
that incorporate interventions to directly target regulatory flexibility. For example, one 
intervention developed by Veilleux et al. (2022) educates individuals about the differential 
effectiveness of regulatory strategies in high versus low intensity emotional states (i.e., 
different emotional contexts), helps them to recognize when the intensity of their emotions 
has escalated enough to warrant a shift in strategy, and has them practice switching 
between strategies in accordance with changes in the intensity of their emotions. Single-
case experimental designs could be used to test the effectiveness of modified treatments 
in individuals with EDs, particularly those with elevated emotional dysregulation. These 
designs maximize internal and external validity and are ripe for application in clinical 
settings, which may be ideal for testing treatments aimed at enhancing regulatory flexibility 
(De Young & Bottera, 2018).

Conclusion

Page 6

Research on ER and coping strategies in EDs has provided valuable insights. However, the 
categorical conceptualization of strategies has left gaps in our understanding of the role of 
regulatory responses in EDs. Shifting focus from the dispositional use of putatively adaptive 
or maladaptive strategies to regulatory flexibility in ED research may advance knowledge of 
the role of ER difficulties in EDs, ultimately enhancing prevention and treatment efforts.

Public Significance Statement

Research on emotion regulation and coping strategy usage in eating disorders often 
views regulatory strategies as inherently adaptive or maladaptive. However, recent studies 
support defining strategies in terms of flexibility. Adopting a regulatory flexibility model 
of strategies in eating disorders research may advance knowledge of the role of emotion 
regulation difficulties in the development and maintenance of eating disorders, ultimately 
enhancing prevention and treatment efforts.
