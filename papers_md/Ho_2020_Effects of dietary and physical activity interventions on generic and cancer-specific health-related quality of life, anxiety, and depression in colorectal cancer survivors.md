Abstract
Purpose To assess the effects of dietary and physical activity (PA) interventions on generic and cancer-specific quality of life
(QoL), anxiety, and depression levels among adult Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors.
Methods Two-hundred twenty-three adult CRC survivors within 1 year of completion of primary cancer treatment
were randomized to receive dietary, PA or combined intervention, or usual care for a 12 monthduration, under a 2
(diet vs usual care) × 2 (PA vs usual care) factorial design. Generic and cancer-specific QoL was assessed using a
Chinese version 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-
Colorectal (FACT-C) scale, respectively. Anxiety and depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear mixed models were used for examining the inter-
vention effects.
Results Participants receiving dietary intervention experienced a significant improvement in the generic measure of QoL (SF-6D
utility scores, mean difference 0.042, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.081) at 12 months, the cancer-specific QoL scores (mean difference 3.09,
95%CI 0.13 to 6.04), and levels of depression (P = 0.015) at both 12 and 24 months follow-up. Participants receiving PA
intervention only demonstrated a significant improvement in SF-6D utility index (mean difference 0.039, 95%CI 0.002 to
0.077) and physical functioning (mean difference 2.85, 95%CI 1.00 to 4.70) at 6 months.
Conclusions Dietary intervention improved the generic and cancer-specific QoL and depression in CRC survivors.
Trial registration The study was prospectively registered on 17 October 2012 at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01708824).
Implications for Cancer Survivors CRC survivors can benefit from dietary interventions in alleviating depression and improving
overall health-related QoL.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading burden of disease world-
wide. CRC was the third most common cancer in men and the
second most common cancer in women with over 1.8 million
new cases, accounting for 10.1% of total cancer burdens, in
2018 [1] . The burden of CRC is expected to increase by 60%
with more than 2.2 million new cases by 2030 [2]. CRC is the
most common cancer in Hong Kong with 5635 new cases in
2017. The crude incidence rate of CRC in Hong Kong in-
creased from 48.2 per 100,000 in 2000 to 76.2 per 100,000
in 2017 [3].

CRC and its treatment often produce significant impacts on
quality of life (QoL) and mental well-being in CRC survivors.
In general, cancer survivors report greater mental health
needs, higher levels of anxiety and depression, and poor phys-
ical and mental health-related QoL [4, 5]. A population-based
survey conducted in the USA reported that on average, the
health-related QoL score of cancer survivors was more than 1
standard deviation below the population mean [6]. With ad-
vances in cancer detection and treatment, CRC survivors are
now living longer. This underscores the need for finding ef-
fective ways to improve both the short-term and long-term
health-related QoL and mental health of CRC survivors.

Evidence from observational studies indicates that diet and
physical activity (PA) are closely linked to health-related QoL
in several types of cancer survivors including CRC [7, 8].
Evidence is emerging that cancer survivors with a greater
adherence to lifestyle behavior recommendations report im-
proved levels of health-related QoL [7]. These findings point
to the potential positive impact of PA and healthy diet on the
health-related QoL in this population. A few studies have
investigated the effects of lifestyle intervention (diet plus PA
interventions, with intervention duration ranging from 6 weeks
to 6 months) on the health-related QoL and mental well-being
in CRC survivors [9–11]. A recent systematic review includ-
ing five randomized controlled trials published between 2003
and 2014 demonstrated the absence of a significant effect of
PA intervention on QoL outcomes, with the exception of one
trial reporting an association with improved physical well-
being [12]. All of these studies were conducted in Caucasian
populations with intervention duration up to 6 months. It is not
known whether the findings from these trials can be general-
ized to the Asian population. Also, the effects of a longer-term
PA intervention were uncertain. This type of information is
especially important due to the rising trend of CRC in Asian
countries.

Dietary factors play an important part in CRC recovery
following primary treatment [13]. However, to our knowl-
edge, no study has explored the role of dietary intervention
on both generic and cancer-specific QoL and levels of anxiety
and depression in CRC survivors. The “Moving Bright,
Eating Smart” study was the first multicenter RCT to assess

425

the efficacy of dietary and PA interventions targeted at dietary
and PA behaviors among adult Chinese CRC survivors [14].
This paper reports the effects of dietary and PA interventions
on generic health-related QoL, CRC-specific QOL, and men-
tal health outcomes. We hypothesized that both dietary and PA
interventions would lead to improvements in generic and
CRC-specific QoL and levels of anxiety and depression in
comparison to a usual care group with a history of diagnosis
of and treatment for CRC.

Methods

The “Moving Bright, Eating Smart” study was a 2 × 2 facto-
rial design RCT. Details of the trial protocol and the findings
of the dietary and PA outcomes have been published else-
where [14, 15]. This paper reports on the effects of interven-
tions on generic and CRC-specific QoL, levels of anxiety, and
depression.

Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review
Board of the Hong Kong West Cluster, the Hospital Authority
in Hong Kong (UW12-478), and site-specific approval pro-
vided by other participating centers (Island East HKEC-2012-
068; and Kowloon West KW/EX-13-002(59-02). Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants, and the
RCT has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT01708824).

Eligibility criteria and subject recruitment

Adults (aged 18 years or older) with histologically con-
firmed CRC and within 1 year of completion of primary
cancer treatment were recruited from the surgical and onco-
logical departments of four public hospitals in Hong Kong.
CRC survivors with persistent or recurrent disease at the
time of recruitment, with hereditary CRC syndromes, and
with known contraindication to PA, such as wheelchair-
bounded or chronic heart failure, were not eligible to partic-
ipate. Potential eligible patients were invited to complete a
validated food frequency questionnaire [16] and the Global
Physical Activity Questionnaire [17]. Those who were al-
ready meeting the target of dietary intake (consumed less
than five servings per week of red/processed meat and less
than two servings daily of refined grains) or PA targets (ac-
cumulated more than 300 min per week of moderate-to-
vigorous intensity PA) were excluded.

The study recruited 224 CRC survivors. Sample size cal-
culation was based on the assumption that 25% of intervention
group participants and 10% of the control group participants
would meet the intervention targets with a power of 80% and a
significance level of 5% and assuming a 10% dropout rate.

426

Randomization and blinding

Eligible participants were randomized to either Group A (di-
etary and PA interventions, n = 55), Group B (diet only, n =
56), Group C (PA only, n = 56), or Group D (usual care with-
out intervention, n = 56) using a block randomization method
stratified by stoma status and study center, by a staff not in-
volved in the study. Group allocation concealment was en-
sured by having a staff not involved in the study to keep the
randomization schedule. The staff was phoned for group allo-
cation when a patient was recruited. Due to the nature of the
intervention, blinding of the participants and interveners were
not possible. However, staff who assessed the outcomes were
blinded.

Interventions

The intervention adopted a personalized and multiple-contact
approach and was based on the theory of planned behavior
(TPB) [18] and the health action process approach (HAPA)
[19]. The intervention details have been published elsewhere
[15]. In brief, the content and the pace of the intervention
delivered depended on the individual participant’s HAPA
stage , namely pre-intentional, intentional, and action stage,
respectively. Specifically, three sets of HAPA stage-of-change
matched information leaflets for each of the dietary and PA
interventions were developed to address the needs of pre-in-
tenders, intenders, and actors. Participants of Group A (dietary
and PA interventions), Group B (diet only), and Group C (PA
only) received the intervention for 12 months and were

J Cancer Surviv  (2020) 14:424–433

followed for another 12 months. Figure 1 shows the interven-
tion schedule.

Dietary interventions

The dietary interventions aimed to reduce red/processed meat
consumption to less than five servings per week (less than two
servings of processed meat) and to limit refined grains to two
servings per day. A staggered approach based on the TPB and
HAPA was adopted. Specifically, participants were encour-
aged to gradually reduce red/processed meat and to replace
them with other protein sources, followed by replacing refined
grains with whole grains. The intervention consisted of indi-
vidual face-to-face motivational interviews (2 sessions, deliv-
ered by dietitians), motivational phone calls every 2 weeks by
trained research assistants, monthly HAPA stage-of-change
matched information pamphlets and quarterly newsletter by
mail, and quarterly group meeting during the first 12 months.
During the intervention period, participants were encouraged
to self-monitor their red/process meat, refined, and whole
grains intakes by completing monthly dietary intake logs. A
set of eating utensils, including bowl, cups, and spoons, was
provided to participants to facilitate portion size estimation.

Physical activity interventions

Participants were encouraged to increase PA progressively to
achieve the general health target of 30 min of moderate-to-
vigorous PA (MVPA) 5 days a week in the first 6 months and
progressing toward the target of 60 min of MVPA 5 days a

week over the next 6 months. Similarly, participants received
individual face-to-face motivational interviews (1 session, de-
livered by a trained RA), motivational phone calls every
2 weeks, monthly HAPA-stage-of-change matched informa-
tion pamphlets, a quarterly newsletter for experience sharing
among participants by mail, and quarterly group meeting over

and a monthly PA log for tracking their levels of PA.

rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4). The total scores
(FACT-C, range from 0 to 132) and a general score (FACT-
G, excluding the colorectal cancer-specific items, range from
0 to 104) were calculated. A higher score indicates better QoL.
The FACT-C and FACT-G have been extensively tested in
CRC survivors (including Chinese populations) and found to
be reliable and valid measures [21].

Usual care

Anxiety and depression

Participants in the usual care (control) group received five
pamphlets containing general healthy lifestyle advice, includ-
ing healthy eating, increase PA, maintaining a normal body
weight, quit smoking, and avoid alcohol abuse. The pamphlets
were posted to participants at every 2 months during the initial
12 months.

Measurements

Participants were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and
24 months. Generic health-related QoL was assessed using a
Chinese version 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)
[20], and the CRC-specific QoL was assessed by the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal
(FACT-C) scale [21], while anxiety and depression scores
were obtained using a Chinese version of the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD-C) [22, 23].

Generic quality of life

The SF-12 is widely used for assessing health-related QoL.
The validity and reliability of SF-12 has been confirmed
among ethnic Chinese [20, 24]. It consists of 12 items which
are categorized into the subscales of Physical Component
Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS). The SF-
12 PCS and MCS scores were calculated using standard algo-
rithms with a higher score implying better QoL. In addition, a
population-specific algorithm was employed to convert the
completed SF-12 into a single index, the six-dimensional
health state short form (SF-6D) [25]. The SF-6D utility index
scores ranged from 0.0 (representing the lowest state of QoL)
to 1.0 (the highest state of QoL). SF-6D utility index is a
preference-based health-related QoL measure that could be
used for economic evaluation [25].

CRC-specific quality of life

The FACT-C is a valid and reliable measure for assessing
health-related QoL in CRC patients [21]. It consists of 27 core
items evaluating physical well-being, social/family well-be-
ing, emotional well-being, and functional well-being plus nine
additional colorectal cancer-specific items. Each item was

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was
used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression [22,
23]. The HADS consists of 14 items and two subscales (anx-
iety and depression) with seven items in each subscale. Each
item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 to 3). Total scores
were calculated for both subscales by summing up the indi-
vidual items. Higher scores represent higher levels of depres-
sion and anxiety. The Chinese version of the HADS has been
validated for the Chinese population [23].

Statistical analysis

The intervention effects were analyzed by the intention-to-
treat principle. To test the hypotheses of a difference between
dietary intervention and usual care, and that between PA in-
tervention and usual care, we used the linear mixed model that
accounts for the extra-covariance among the repeated mea-
surements over time. These two by two-group comparisons
were made under the 2 (diet vs usual care) × 2 (PA vs usual
care) factorial design that allows simultaneous assessment of
both the dietary and PA interventions effects over usual care at
a smaller sample size provided there is no interaction effect
between the two interventions. Hence, we first examined the
interaction effect between the dietary and PA interventions,
before assessing their marginal effects.

Specifically, we first conducted a linear mixed model of
SF-12 PCS, with random intercept and fixed effects of diet
(vs usual care), PA (vs usual care), time, diet by PA interac-
tion, diet by time interaction, PA by time interaction, the base-
line value, stoma status, and study center. We did not observe
a significant diet by PA interaction effect, which assured the
appropriateness of analyzing the dietary and PA intervention
effects under the 2 × 2 factorial design setting. After removing
this and other insignificant interaction effects, we repeated the
linear mixed model, based on which the coefficients and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) corresponding to diet and PA were
reported. The same analysis was conducted for other generic
health-related QoL scores (SF-12 MCS, SF-6D utility index),
the CRC-specific QoL scores (FACT-G and FACT-C scores),
and levels of anxiety and depression. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, North Caroline), and a 5% significance level was used.

Results

Participants

A flow diagram of participants through the study has been
reported previously [14]. In brief, 223 eligible participants
(82 females, 141 males) were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio
to Group A, B, C, and D. Table 1 shows the baseline charac-
teristics of participants. The mean age of the participants was
65.2 years (standard deviation = 10.1; range = 25 to 86). Most
of them (87%) had completed at least college. Overall, 60% of
the participants were colon cancer survivors (n = 133), 40% of
them were rectal cancer survivors (n = 89), and one with syn-
chronous colon and rectal cancers. There were 20% partici-
pants with stage I cancer, 43% with stage II, and 37% with
stage III or IV. All participants had surgeries, and 30 of the 223
participants (13%) had a permanent or temporary stoma.
About 60% participants (n = 129) received adjuvant chemo-
therapy and 19% (n = 43) received adjuvant radiotherapy. No
significant differences in baseline characteristics among the
four groups were observed.

At 24 months, 31 participants (14%) dropped out due to can-
cer recurrence (n = 18), loss to follow-up (n = 8), development of
new cancer (n = 5), and died from cancer recurrence (n = 2).
There were no significant differences in retention rates among
all four groups and no significant differences in baseline charac-
teristics between the completers and non-completers.

Intervention adherence

Overall, participants randomized to the intervention groups
(Group A, B, and C) attended an average of 95% of motiva-
tional sessions, answered 72% of the motivational phone calls
and joined 44% of the group meetings. The attendance rates
were similar among the three intervention groups. At
12 months, 55% and 43% of the participants receiving the
dietary intervention (Group A and B) met the red/processed
meat and refined grain targets, respectively. Of the participants
receiving the PA intervention (Group A and C), 62% met the
general health target (30 min of MVPA 5 days), and 55% met
the cancer outcome target (60 min of MVPA 5 days).These
positive behavioral changes were sustained at 24-month fol-
low-up with 52%, 41%, and 60% of participants meeting the
red/processed meat, refined grains, and cancer outcome PA
targets, respectively.

Impact of interventions on generic and CRC-specific
quality of life

24-month follow up. As no interaction effect was observed
between the dietary and PA interventions, Table 3 summarized
the confirmatory results of the dietary and PA interventions.

There was no significant time effect of the PA intervention
on the QoL scores among the participants receiving the PA
intervention (Table 2) indicating PA intervention did not have
a significant effect on the generic and CRC-specific QoL

scores. However, participants receiving the PA intervention
showed a greater improvement in SF-6D utility index (mean
difference 0.039, 95%CI 0.002 to 0.077, Table 3) and SF-12
PCS scores (mean difference 2.85, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.70) when

compared to those who did not receive the PA intervention at
6 months.

Impact of interventions on levels of anxiety
and depression

Overall, participants receiving the dietary intervention showed
a significant reduction in the levels of depression (mean dif-
ference 0.71, 95%CI 1.28 to 0.14, Table 2) but no significant
changes in the levels of anxiety. Participants receiving the
dietary intervention also reported a significantly greater reduc-
tion of levels of depression at both 12 months and 24 months
when compared to those who did not receive the dietary in-
tervention (Table 3). However, PA interventions were not sig-
nificantly associated with changes in the level of depression.
Also, neither dietary nor PA interventions were significantly
associated with changes in the level of anxiety.

Discussion

In the light of the growing number of CRC survivors, an
evaluation of generic and CRC-specific health-related QoL
of survivors becomes increasingly important. The major find-
ing of this trial is that participants receiving the dietary inter-
vention reported a significant improvement in generic
preference-based QoL index (SF-6D utility scores), physical
functioning (SF-12 PCS), the cancer-specific QoL scores
(FACT-G), and levels of depression compared to those who
did not receive the dietary intervention.

Health-related quality of life is an important aspect of suc-
cessful cancer survivorship [26]. Encouragement of healthy
diet and adherence to recommended dietary guidelines have
been one of the goals of CRC survivorship care. The role of
diet has been assessed previously as part of multiple health
behavior change interventions for CRC survivors [9–11].
However, there are no published studies that have been under-
taken among CRC survivors to assess the impacts of diet-only
intervention. The present study adds to our understanding of
the role that dietary interventions play on the health-related
QoL and levels of anxiety and depression in CRC survivors.
Our results suggest that a theory-based dietary intervention
has the potential to improve both generic and CRC-specific
health-related QoL and reduce depression in CRC survivors.
Cancer is a traumatic event. Cancer survivors often face ad-
aptation problems and fears of cancer recurrence and negative
effects of cancer treatment. Although the mechanisms of the
observed beneficial effects of dietary intervention are not
clear, research suggests that health-related behavior change
interventions may promote posttraumatic growth in CRC sur-
vivors and foster positive growth and adaptation which may
alleviate distress [9]. In addition, emerging evidence shows
that provision of reliable and good quality health information

may help to relieve distress in cancer survivors [27]. In current
study, intervention components included individual face-to-
face sessions delivered by dietitians plus regular phone calls
and stage-of-change matched information pamphlets devel-
oped by oncology healthcare teams, and these may have con-
tributed to the positive outcomes observed. However, it is
unclear why there was no intervention effect on the levels of
anxiety. A possible reason for the lack of intervention effects
on anxiety could be due to relatively lower anxiety scores
(mean scores ranged from 10.1 to 11.1) at baseline compared
to the depression scores (mean scores ranged from 11.4 to
12.0). It is worth to note that a total score of 8 to 10 represents
a borderline abnormal level of depression and anxiety, while a
total score of 11–21 represent an abnormal level of depression
and anxiety [22]. Further studies are needed to confirm and
explain this observation.

CRC is a leading cancer burden worldwide; hence, eco-
nomic evaluation is becoming more important for evaluating
the cost-effectiveness of clinical interventions so as to inform
resource allocation. A number of measures are available for
estimating the health utility scores. However, no study had
reported the effects of dietary or PA intervention on the health
utility scores in CRC survivors. The current study has includ-
ed the novel health utility data, the SF-6D utility index score.
The SF-6D is a widely used preference-based measures of
health derived from the popular health-related QoL instru-
ment, SF-12 [28]. This tool applied cost-utility analysis in
enabling the generation of quality-adjusted life years to guide
health economic decisions. A novel finding of the current
study is that a significant intervention effect on the SF-6D
scores was observed for participants receiving PA interven-
tions at 6 months and for participants receiving dietary inter-
ventions at 12 months. These novel results suggest that PA
and dietary interventions are cost-effective in the short to me-
dium term. More work is needed to confirm this observation
and identify the most cost-effective approach of supporting
CRC survivors.

While the effects of PA interventions on the generic and
cancer-specific QoL in CRC survivors have been studied pre-
viously, we extended the evidence by examining both the
long-term effects (24-month follow-up) and the impact on
health utility scores. Consistent with the findings reported by
other research groups [9, 29, 30], no significant between-
group differences were observed on the CRC-specific QoL
at any time points. The physical functioning measure (SF-12
PCS) and the SF-6D utility scores at 6 months did improve in
the PA group during the intervention period. The PA interven-
tion did not result in a significant improvement in participants’
PA levels [14]. As most participants were sufficiently physi-
cally active at baseline [13], the PA intervention might have
not been able to yield significant increases in PA levels and,
thereby, in health-related QoL among the participants. Ceiling
effects of PA intervention have also been reported by other

432

J Cancer Surviv  (2020) 14:424–433

research teams [31]. Another explanation for the lack of a signif-
icant intervention effect may be related to the low intensity of the
PA intervention (predominantly walking) used in current study.
Participants received one face-to-face intervention session plus
phone calls every 2 weeks and monthly pamphlets, without su-
pervised PA training. Further studies are warranted to explore the
optimal length, intervention intensity, and mode of delivery (for
example, supervised PA training) of PA interventions for improv-
ing exercise behavior and QoL in CRC survivors.

The current study has several limitations that should be
noted. First, the QoL, anxiety, and depression were based on
self-report; although these measures are widely used in epide-
miological and clinical researches, the inherent biases related
to self-reporting cannot be fully eliminated. Second, this study
was conducted in Chinese CRC survivors, which may limit
the generalizability of the findings to other populations.
Further studies are needed to establish the efficacy of the die-
tary intervention in other ethnicities and with other cancer
types. The study was also limited by the possible ceiling effect
of PA intervention. Future studies should recruit cancer survi-
vors with lower PA levels at baseline or encourage greater
intensities of PA intervention if deemed appropriate to confirm
the effect of PA on health-related QoL.

In summary, this study provides insight into the use of
dietary interventions for improving generic health-related
and CRC-specific QoL and reducing depression in CRC sur-
vivors. Future efforts should be directed toward promoting
behavior changes in CRC survivors to prevent cancer recur-
rence as well as to promote higher levels of QoL and reduced
distress levels. Further studies with even longer-term follow-
up are needed to assess the impact of dietary and PA interven-
tions on clinical endpoints, such as disease-free survival and
mortality, as well as the cost-effectiveness.
