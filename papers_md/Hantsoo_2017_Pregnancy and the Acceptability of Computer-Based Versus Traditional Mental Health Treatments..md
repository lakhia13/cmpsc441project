Abstract

Background: Recent recommendations urge increased depression screening in pregnant and postpartum wo-
men, potentially increasing demand for treatment. Computer-based psychotherapy treatments may address some
of perinatal women’s unique mental health treatment needs and barriers.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a quantitative survey of pregnant women (‡12 weeks of gestation) on
preferences regarding computer-based therapies compared with traditional
therapies (psychotherapy and
medication). Nonpregnant women and men served as comparison groups. Participants were provided de-
scriptions of three computer-based therapies: video telehealth therapy (VTT), computer-assisted therapy (CAT),
and self-guided online therapy (SGO). Participants were asked to select all options that they would consider for
treatment as well as ﬁrst choice preference. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed current depressive
symptomatology, and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) assessed psychiatric history.
Results: Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), nonpregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54).
Among pregnant women, 77.5% (n = 86) indicated that they would consider some form of computer-based
therapy for mental health treatment during pregnancy; VTT was the most commonly considered, followed by
CAT and SGO. When asked to select their preferred intervention, traditional talk therapy was the ﬁrst choice
among all three groups, controlling for treatment history and PHQ-9 score. About one-third of pregnant women
chose some form of computer-based therapy as their top choice.
Conclusions: While computer-based therapies were acceptable to most pregnant women in this sample, tra-
ditional talk therapy was the preferred option. Future research should consider how to tailor computer-based
therapies to the unique needs of perinatal women.

Introduction

Up to 15% of women will suffer from depression while

pregnant.1–3 Mental health concerns during pregnancy
have been linked to preterm birth,4,5 lower birth weight,6,7
abnormal infant neuroendocrine development,8 and long-term
adverse impact on offspring neurodevelopment.9,10 Thus, the
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently re-
commended screening for depression speciﬁcally in pregnant
and postpartum women.11 With increased perinatal depression

screening will come increased demand for treatment. How-
ever, treatment options must meet the unique needs of
perinatal women. Pharmacotherapy is the treatment recom-
mendation for moderate to severe depression during preg-
nancy,12 but women consistently prefer nonmedication
options for perinatal mental health treatment,13 and often
discontinue medication during pregnancy due to concern
over potential harm to the fetus.14–16 While pregnant and
postpartum women prefer nonmedication treatment such as
psychotherapy, they also face unique barriers to obtaining

such treatment, including lack of childcare, lack of time,
limitations in mobility or transportation, stigma associated with
depression during pregnancy, and ﬁnancial concerns.17–21

Computer-based treatments address some of these barri-
ers.22,23 Computer-based treatments can connect therapists and
patients in real time, allow stand-alone interventions, or act as
adjuncts to traditional therapy models. Several computer-
based treatments have been examined in the treatment of de-
pression, anxiety disorders, and insomnia24–27 and range from
self-guided web-based tools28 to interactive modules that
augment traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) (e.g.,
computer-assisted CBT, CCBT).29–32 Although, the past de-
cade has seen signiﬁcant growth in and tailoring of computer-
based treatments to speciﬁc populations,33,34 perinatal women
have not been frequently included.35–37 Like others,32 our
previous trial of CCBT for depressed pregnant women showed
a high rate of adherence to the treatment program, and 80% of
participants showed symptom improvement,31 suggesting that
computer-based treatments may be a promising option for
perinatal women. Based on the reported barriers and reluctance
to use medication, the ideal treatment during pregnancy would
be a nonpharmacologic, short-term, easy-to-access, and ef-
fective alternative.

To examine whether computer-based psychotherapeutic
interventions would be an acceptable alternative among
pregnant women, we conducted a quantitative survey of
pregnant women with and without a history of mental health
treatment. Nonpregnant women and men with and without
mental health treatment history were included as comparison
groups. We hypothesized that pregnant women would prefer
computer-based therapies over traditional psychotherapy in a
clinician’s ofﬁce or medication alone given the unique bar-
riers that pregnant women face and their general desire to
avoid psychotropic medications. We similarly hypothesized
that pregnant women would prefer computer-based treat-
ments more frequently than nonpregnant women or men.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

graphic information (including age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital
status, education, and household income), medical and psy-
chiatric history (current and past diagnoses and prescribed
medications), and selected potential beneﬁts, disadvantages,
and barriers to mental health treatment (with space for free
response if other was chosen). To assess acceptability and
preference of three computer-based therapies as well as tradi-
tional talk therapy and medication, participants were provided
descriptions of three computer-based therapies (Table 1):
video telehealth therapy (VTT), a method in which the pa-
tient engages in psychotherapy sessions with the therapist
over a web camera; computer-assisted therapy (CAT), a
method of delivering psychotherapy, typically CBT, through
a computer interface with some interaction with the thera-
pist31; and self-guided online therapy (SGO), a self-selected
and self-administered program in which the patient does not
meet with a therapist and instead completes computer-based
exercises at home at his or her own pace. To assess treatment
acceptability, participants were asked to select all options
that they would consider for treatment; pregnant women were
asked to answer the question assuming that they would receive
this treatment while pregnant. To assess treatment preference,
participants were asked to select their ﬁrst choice among this set
of options. For both acceptability and preference, participants
had the option to select none or don’t know.

As depressive symptoms may impact treatment preference,
participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(PHQ-9)39 to assess current depressive symptomatology.
After completion of these assessments online, participants
were presented with a page thanking them for their par-
ticipation and prompting them to schedule a Mini Inter-
national Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI)40 by phone.
After reviewing the participant’s self-report measures, a
researcher trained to administer the MINI called the par-
ticipant within 72 hours after submission of online surveys
and completed the MINI by phone. After completion of the
MINI, the participants received a $5.00 gift card by mail as
compensation for their participation.

Eligible participants were 18- to 45-year-old pregnant
females, at least 12 weeks gestational age, and nonpregnant
females and males of age 18–45. Participants were recruited
using ﬂyers disbursed in and around the University of Penn-
sylvania campus, from the Penn Center for Women’s Beha-
vioral Wellness, and via Penn Data Store (a data analytic center
that provides patient information collected from Penn Medicine
information systems). The only exclusion for study participa-
tion was if the participant was unable to correctly summarize
the differences among the three types of computer-based
therapies after being read descriptions of each.

Study overview

This single-site study was approved by the University of
Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. All subjects elec-
tronically signed informed consent before completion of study
procedures. Participants completed surveys online using the
online REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools
hosted by the University of Pennsylvania. REDCap is a secure
web-based application designed to support data capture for
research studies.38 Via RedCap, participants reported demo-

Measures

The PHQ-9 was used to assess mood over the past 2 weeks.
The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for screening, di-
agnosing, monitoring, and measuring the severity of de-
pression. It is completed by the patient and takes less than 5
minutes to complete. The diagnostic validity of the PHQ-9
was established in studies showing PHQ scores ‡10 and had a
sensitivity of 88% and a speciﬁcity of 88% for major de-
pression. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moder-
ate, moderately severe, and severe depression.39

The MINI is a short screening assessment given by a
trained evaluator to establish current and past mental health
concerns. When administered by family medicine residents
in a primary healthcare setting, the MINI had kappa coefﬁ-
cients between 0.65 and 0.85, sensitivity between 0.75 and
0.92, speciﬁcity between 0.90 and 0.99, positive predictive
values between 0.60 and 0.86, negative predictive values,
between 0.92 and 0.99, and accuracy between 0.88 and 0.98
when compared with the Structured Clinical Interview for
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM).40

Statistical methods

Descriptive analyses were performed to characterize the
study population and to determine demographic differences
between the groups. For continuous variables, analysis of
variance was used to compare values among the three groups.

HANTSOO ET AL.

For categorical variables, Pearson’s chi-square test was used
to compare the groups. If a three-way comparison was sig-
niﬁcant, post hoc tests were performed. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance was set at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. Chi-square tests
and multinomial logistic regression were used to assess dif-
ferences in treatment acceptability and treatment preferences
among men, women, and pregnant women.

Results

Demographics

Participants included pregnant females (n = 111), non-
pregnant females (n = 147), and males (n = 54). The groups
were similar in terms of age, race, and education ( ps > 0.05)
(Table 2). A greater number of men than women were single,
widowed, or divorced. Pregnant women reported higher total
household income; this was likely because more pregnant
women were married and thus in a dual-income household
(Table 2). The three groups were similar in self-report and
clinician-rated measures of depression and anxiety, including
PHQ-9 score and MINI diagnoses (Table 2). More than half
of the participants reported having received mental health
including talk therapy (n = 181), medication
treatment,
(n = 89), and alternative treatments, including acupuncture
(n = 1), biofeedback (n = 1), or inpatient or day programs
(n = 3) (Table 2). Signiﬁcantly more men than women were
treatment naı¨ve (Table 2). Those with a treatment history
had signiﬁcantly higher PHQ-9 scores than those without

a treatment history (F(278) = 6.2, p = 0.003);
those with
medication treatment had signiﬁcantly higher PHQ-9 scores
than those with no treatment or talk therapy (F(2) = 26.0,
p < 0.001). As treatment history may inﬂuence treatment
preference, these variables were included in logistic regres-
sion models that assessed treatment preferences. For further
analyses, those who reported receiving mental health treat-
ment were categorized as having received talk therapy,
medication (even if other treatments were reported), or no
treatment. Those who had received alternative treatments
were excluded from analyses.

Treatment options: barriers and acceptability

Barriers to treatment. Among pregnant participants, the
major perceived barriers to traditional mental health treatment
during pregnancy included work schedule, treatment afford-
ability, and lack of childcare (Table 3). Only lack of insurance
was reported as a barrier by nonpregnant women signiﬁcantly
more frequently than pregnant women ( p = 0.04).

Acceptability of treatments. Participants were presented
with ﬁve types of therapies (traditional psychotherapy, med-
ication, CAT, SGO, and VTT) and asked to select all treat-
ment options that they would consider if they needed mental
healthcare. Pregnant women indicated that they would con-

sider each speciﬁc computer-based therapy at similar rates to
nonpregnant women and men: VTT was most commonly
considered by pregnant women at 58.6% (n = 65), followed by
CAT at 55.9% (n = 62) and SGO at 27.9% (n = 31) (Table 4).
A signiﬁcantly lower percentage of pregnant women (16.2%,
n = 18) indicated that they would consider medication com-
pared with nonpregnant women (57.8%, n = 85) ( p < 0.001).
Men considered CAT signiﬁcantly more often than women
overall ( p = 0.03) (Table 4). When all forms of computer-
based therapy (CAT, VTT, and SGO) were combined,
77.5% (n = 86) of pregnant women indicated that they would
consider some form of computer-based therapy for men-
tal health treatment during pregnancy; this was similar to
nonpregnant women (83.7%, n = 123) and men (85.5%,
n = 46) (X2(2) = 2.15, p = 0.342).

Treatment beneﬁts. Participants selected from a list
of potential perceived beneﬁts to computer-based therapy
(Table 3); the most common responses included ability to
access computer-based therapy material anytime, less time at
the therapist’s ofﬁce, and feeling more comfortable or honest
reporting emotions to a computer. Endorsement of these
potential beneﬁts did not differ between groups ( p > 0.05).
Only 12% of participants believed that computer-based
therapy would be more conﬁdential and secure compared

with traditional talk therapy. Concerns included feeling that
computer-based therapy would not be as helpful or as cus-
tomizable as traditional therapy, as well as conﬁdentiality of
personal information or privacy concerns. Most participants
across the three groups chose a desktop or laptop as their ﬁrst
choice for accessing computer-based therapy. Tablets were
second choice, and smartphones were third choice in all
groups (Table 3).

First choice treatment preferences

When all treatment options were presented and partici-
pants were asked to select their single most preferred inter-
vention, traditional talk therapy was the ﬁrst choice treatment
among all three groups (Table 5). Among pregnant women
whose preferred choice was a computer-based therapy, top
choices were CAT (16.2%, n = 18), VTT (9%, n = 10), and
SGO (5.4%, n = 6), which was similar to nonpregnant women
and men (Table 5). Chi-square analyses revealed that treat-
ment preference did not vary by education level, household
income, employment status, marital status, or means of
transportation ( p¢s > 0.05). Treatment preference varied by
treatment history (X2(18) = 38.91, p = 0.003) and having a
current PHQ-9 score of 10 or above (X2(6) = 13.88, p = 0.03).
Thus, treatment history and PHQ-9 scores were included in
regression models. Using talk therapy as a reference cate-
gory, multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that
computer-based therapies were favored over talk therapy by
individuals with no treatment history ( p = 0.002) or a history

of medication ( p = 0.09) (F(15) = 48.22, p < 0.001). This
preference was not inﬂuenced by pregnancy status or sex. As
expected, pregnant women were less likely than the other
groups to favor medication over talk therapy ( p = 0.008).
Those with a history of medication were more likely to prefer
medication over talk therapy, regardless of group ( p = 0.017).
Participants were then asked to select their top choice
among the three types of computer-based therapies. Con-
trolling for PHQ-9 score and treatment history, multinomial
logistic regression revealed that nonpregnant women pre-
ferred VTT over CAT ( p = 0.018). Participants with a high
PHQ score, regardless of group, preferred SGO over CAT
( p = 0.02). Treatment history had no signiﬁcant effect on
treatment preference among the computer-based therapies.

Other factors inﬂuencing treatment preferences

Gestational age. We considered that during pregnancy,
gestational age may inﬂuence treatment choice. Among
pregnant women in this sample, post hoc logistic regressions
revealed that there was no relationship between gestational
age and preference for therapies that required regular in-person
contact with a provider (traditional therapy and CAT) versus
those that did not (medication, VTT, and SGO) ( p = 0.53).
When examining by trimester, the top treatment choice of all
options was talk therapy across all trimesters ( p = 0.85).

Anxiety diagnoses. Anxiety diagnoses were more com-
mon among women in this sample (Table 2). This included
a current or past MINI diagnosis of generalized anxiety

post-traumatic stress disorder. Participants with an anxiety
disorder more commonly selected computer-based therapies
and medication and were less likely to prefer talk therapy,
compared with those without anxiety, in a chi-square analysis
( p = 0.02).

Discussion

This study assessed preferences for mental health treat-
ment among pregnant women, compared with nonpregnant
women and men, given recent recommendations to increase
mental health screening and treatment among pregnant wo-
men. We compared traditional therapies (talk therapy and
medication) with newer computer-based therapies (VTT,
CAT, and SGO).

Computer-based therapies were a highly acceptable form of
treatment. Among pregnant women, 77.5% indicated that they
would consider computer-based therapy for mental health
treatment during pregnancy, and 30.6% (n = 34) preferred
computer-based therapy to all other forms of treatment.
Among pregnant women, VTT had the highest level of ac-
ceptability among the three computer-based therapy options.
VTT does not require travel to a clinician’s ofﬁce, which may
explain why pregnant women favored it over CAT, which in
this study was deﬁned as requiring brief in-person sessions
with a therapist. Indeed, work schedule and lack of childcare
were among pregnant women’s greatest barriers to seeking
treatment; by removing travel to a therapist’s ofﬁce, VTT may
allow more ﬂexibility around work schedules and childcare. It
should be noted that CAT can be adapted to omit in-person
sessions with a therapist, instead utilizing, for example, tele-
phone contact with a therapist. While not deﬁned this way in
this study, it is possible that replacing brief in-person sessions
in CAT with video or telephone sessions could make it more
appealing to pregnant women facing treatment barriers such
as work schedules or childcare.

While participants indicated that they would consider
computer-based treatments, the preferred treatment option
among pregnant women, as well as nonpregnant women and
men, was traditional psychotherapy. This is consistent with
recent ﬁndings that face-to-face psychotherapy was preferred
to computer-based treatments, regardless of age, sex, or ed-
ucation level.41 In a primary care sample, 94.3% of patients
indicated interest in receiving face-to-face care in the clinic,
and only 47.1% expressed interest in internet intervention.42
Given documented limitations in access to therapists trained
in evidenced-based treatments in many areas of the United
States,43,44 further research should be done to explore what
might make computer-based treatment more appealing to
patients. Inability to form a therapeutic relationship with a
computer, as opposed to the human connection one experi-
ences in face-to-face psychotherapy, is a major shortcoming
of computer-based therapies.45 In this sample, lack of warmth
and the computer not being as helpful as a live therapist were
some concerns regarding computer-based treatments.

Regarding pregnancy’s impact on treatment preference, one
might predict that the further along in pregnancy a woman is,
with increased frequency of prenatal visits and/or limited mo-
bility, the more she might prefer home-based computer-based
therapy to minimize travel to a therapist’s ofﬁce. However,
gestational age did not inﬂuence treatment preference in this

sample. Pregnancy status did inﬂuence treatment preference
regarding medication—as expected, pregnant women were less
likely to favor medication, likely due to concerns about the
effect of pharmacotherapy on the fetus.14

Treatment history inﬂuenced treatment preference among the
traditional therapies, but not for computer-based therapies.
Among individuals with no treatment history or a history of
medication use, computer-based therapies were signiﬁcantly
preferred over talk therapy regardless of sex or pregnancy status.
This suggests that treatment-naı¨ve patients may be more open to
computer-based therapies than those with an established treat-
ment history. Computer-based treatments may also be appealing
to individuals who have utilized psychiatric medication in the
past and are interested in exploring psychotherapy.

While PHQ-9 scores in this sample were relatively low,
individuals who had greater depressive symptomatology
were more likely to prefer SGO from among the computer-
based therapies. Of the three computer-based therapies, SGO
requires no interaction with a psychotherapist, may vary in
quality, and has the least amount of empirical support in
terms of treatment effectiveness.46 This is concerning as
work by Mohr et al. suggests a high dropout rate (80%–90%)
in SGO, making it a poor treatment option for patients with
severe symptoms and high need for mental health treat-
ment.47 It is possible that the more structured and interactive
format of CAT, which combines aspects of traditional talk
therapy with computer-based components, would provide
better retention than SGO.

These ﬁndings have implications for use of technology in
mental health treatment, particularly among pregnant women.
Computer-based therapies may be most appealing to pregnant
women who do not want to take medication or face barri-
ers such as scheduling demands, access to transportation, or
childcare.48,49 A large number of participants cited the ability
to access therapy at any time as being an important consid-
eration for them. Less time spent at the therapist’s ofﬁce was
also cited as an advantage of computer-based therapies.

Strengths, limitations, and future directions

This study’s strengths included assessing speciﬁc types of
computer-based therapies, as opposed to focusing on computer-
based therapy in general. It also used the clinician-administered
MINI to diagnose anxiety and mood disorders, as opposed to
relying on self-report measures alone. As treatment history ap-
peared to inﬂuence treatment preferences, one limitation was that
we did not collect detailed information on participants’ past
treatments, for example, type of psychotherapy, number of ses-
sions of psychotherapy, or response to medications. Previous
experience with treatment, whether it was positive or negative,
can clearly have a large impact on an individual’s choice of
treatment and should be assessed in detail in future studies. This
sample was largely Caucasian, college-educated, and used
computers frequently. Future studies should assess acceptability
of computer-based therapies in more diverse samples as access to
or experience with technology could be limited by income or
education level.

Conclusions

With recent recommendations to increase mental health
screening and treatment in the perinatal population, this re-
search provides important information on what treatment

1112

options may be appealing to women during pregnancy. The
prenatal period is critically important in the development and
long-term health of the offspring, and untreated maternal
depression can have deleterious effects.10 While identifying
depression among pregnant women is important, taking the
next step to ameliorate depressive symptoms during preg-
nancy is imperative. Computer-based therapies have the po-
tential to circumvent a number of barriers that may keep
women from seeking mental health treatment during preg-
nancy, providing an efﬁcient and cost-effective50 way to de-
ploy mental health intervention during the perinatal period.
CBT, the treatment recommended by the USPSTF 2016
guidelines, is particularly amenable to computer adaptation45;
it is generally time limited and includes psychoeducation on
core principles51 that are translatable to a computerized for-
mat.29 Future studies should examine how to make computer-
based treatments tailored to and more appealing to pregnant
and postpartum women.
