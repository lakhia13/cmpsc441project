Abstract
Background  Primary aldosteronism (PA) is an adrenal gland disease, that induces increased secretion of the 
mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, resulting in symptoms such as hypertension. This study reports a patient with 
agoraphobia and panic attacks, associated with PA. This patient’s psychiatric symptoms improved after treatment with 
eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Case presentation  The patient was a 40-year-old female with agoraphobia, which refers to the irrational fear of 
situations that may cause anxiety, and panic attacks characterized by profuse sweating, palpitations, and generalized 
weakness. She was diagnosed with hypertension from PA. Subsequently, she received treatment with eplerenone, 
which improved her agoraphobia and panic attacks.

Conclusions  There have been no previous reports on PA associated with agoraphobia and panic attacks that 
improved with pharmacotherapy. Patients with agoraphobia and panic attacks should be evaluated for PA. In patients 
with PA, pharmacotherapy with eplerenone should be considered.

Background
Primary  aldosteronism  (PA)  is  an  adrenal  gland  disor-
der, that causes overproduction of the mineralocorticoid, 
aldosterone, resulting in hypertension. PA can be attrib-
uted  to  approximately  1%  of  all  hypertensive  patients, 
but in recent years it has been estimated to be 5–10% [1]. 
Unilateral PA secondary to an adrenal adenoma is treated 
via  unilateral  adrenalectomy,  while  bilateral  PA  second-
ary  to  adrenal  hyperplasia  is  treated  with  mineralocor-
ticoid  receptor  (MR)  antagonists.  Patients  unwilling  to 

undergo  surgery  also  receive  MR  antagonists. The  com-
plications  of  PA  include  depression,  anxiety  disorders, 
and  other  psychiatric  disorders  [2–5].  There  have  been 
some  reports  of  PA,  complicated  with  agoraphobia  or 
panic  attacks  [5,  6].  However,  this  was  the  first  study 
to  document  the  resolution  of  agoraphobia  and  panic 
attacks  in  a  patient  with  PA,  who  was  treated  phar-
macologically.  This  study  reports  the  case  of  a  patient 
with  agoraphobia  and  panic  attacks  induced  by  PA. The 
patient’s psychiatric symptoms improved after treatment 
with eplerenone, an MR antagonist.

graduating  from  high  school,  she  studied  abroad  at  a 
University  College.  After  graduating  from  the  Univer-
sity, she returned to her hometown and worked in sales 
and  business.  She  developed  uterine  cancer  and  com-
plete remission was achieved postoperatively. She did not 
have a history of mental illness. Four months prior to her 
visit to our university hospital, she was at the company’s 
training  center,  where  she  experienced  sweating,  palpi-
tations,  breathlessness,  lightheadedness,  and  weakness. 
Her  symptoms  made  it  difficult  to  move  her  extremi-
ties. These symptoms were repeatedly observed in simi-
lar situations. Her symptoms improved when she moved 
away  from  the  training  center.  She  began  experienc-
ing  similar  symptoms  during  online  meetings.  She  con-
sulted  with  her  local  physician,  who  recorded  a  systolic 
blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg, plasma aldosterone 
concentration  (PAC)  of  69.6  pg/mL  (CLEIA  method), 
active renin quantitative concentration (ARC) of 1.4 pg/
mL (CLEAR method), and positive PAC/ARC 50 and PA 
screening  tests.  She  was  admitted  to  the  Internal  Medi-
cine  Department  of  the  University  Hospital.  She  was 
seen by a hospital physician, and similar symptoms were 
elicited.  Since  her  attacks  were  precipitated  by  specific 
situations  and  improved  upon  avoiding  these  triggers,  a 
psychiatric disorder was suspected. Thus, the patient was 
referred  to  the  Department  of  Psychiatry.  The  patient’s 
facial expressions and tone of voice were calm and com-
posed.  She  experienced  attacks  in  certain  situations 
such as when she entered the company’s training center 
or  during  online  meetings.  During  the  attacks,  she  was 
aware of her lightheadedness, weakness of the upper and 
lower  extremities,  inability  to  stand  up  for  an  extended 
period,  palpitations,  sweating,  and  some  difficulty  in 
breathing.  These  attacks  frequently  occurred  when  she 
went to the company’s training centers and online meet-
ings. In the hospital, the same symptoms were observed, 
when she was in the examination room with a physician. 
The  symptoms  lasted  for  several  minutes  and  improved 
when  the  patient  moved  away  from  the  trigger.  She 
became  anxious  about  these  situations  and  eventually 
developed an avoidant behavior. The symptoms occurred 
when  the  patient  went  to  training  center,  online  meet-
ings,  consultations  with  the  doctor,  and  the  examina-
tion room. The total score of the Japanese version of the 
self-rating Panic and Square Fear Scale (PAS) [7] was 26. 
The  symptoms  were  possibly  caused  by  PA.  However, 
they  were  triggered  by  specific  situations  and  improved 
upon  avoiding  these  triggers.  Moreover,  the  patient’s 
weakness  was  not  caused  by  a  documented  decrease  in 
her potassium level. Thus, the symptoms were not solely 
caused by PA. Rather, her symptoms constituted a panic 
attack.  The  patient  experienced  fear  and  anxiety,  when 
she was placed in the aforementioned situations, and she 
tended  to  avoid  them.  Her  symptoms  were  triggered  by 

situations  involving  social  interactions  despite  having 
minimal  fear  of  attracting  attention  from  others.  Based 
on this, a social anxiety disorder was less likely, and the 
patient was diagnosed with agoraphobia. A positive cap-
topril stress test and furosemide standing test were per-
formed  to  identify  the  cause  of  hypertension,  and  the 
patient  was  diagnosed  with  PA.  Abdominal  computed 
tomography showed no adrenal gland tumors, and elec-
tive adrenal vein sampling was considered to determine if 
surgery was indicated. However, the patient did not wish 
to  undergo  surgery.  Hence,  she  received  pharmacologi-
cal treatment. She was given eplerenone (25 mg), an MR 
antagonist.  Five  days  later,  the  dosage  was  increased  to 
50  mg.  After  initiating  eplerenone  therapy,  the  patient’s 
panic  attacks  persisted,  albeit  less  severely.  The  panic 
attacks were associated with a feeling of chest heaviness 
and  the  duration  of  the  attacks  was  reduced.  Based  on 
this,  the  treatment  improved  the  patient’s  agoraphobia 
and panic attacks. She was discharged Day22 after admis-
sion. Following her discharge, her psychiatric symptoms 
gradually  improved.  She  still  had  panic  attacks  upon 
entering  the  training  center  and  during  medical  exami-
nations.  Subsequently,  she  was  prescribed  alprazolam 
(0.4 mg), but it was discontinued after a single dose due 
to  somnolence.  Her  blood  pressure  remained  at  140/90 
mmHg.  The  dosage  of  her  eplerenone  was  increased  to 
75 mg. Four days after the increase dosage, her psychiat-
ric symptoms disappeared, and she has not experienced a 
panic attack or agoraphobia since then.

Discussion and conclusions
This  was  the  first  case  of  PA-induced  agoraphobia  and 
panic attacks, that were completely resolved with eplere-
none treatment. Several reports have shown the relation-
ship  between  PA,  psychiatric  disorders,  and  psychiatric 
symptoms.  Among  ten  patients  with  PA,  six  had  gener-
alized  anxiety  disorder.  One  patient  had  panic  disorder, 
while  another  had  major  depressive  disorder  [4].  The 
frequency of psychiatric disorders, stress, mental status, 
and well-being were assessed and compared among three 
groups:  23  patients  with  PA,  23  patients  with  essential 
hypertension, and 23 normotensive healthy controls. The 
prevalence  of  anxiety  disorders  was  significantly  higher 
in  the  PA  group,  compared  to  the  other  two  groups  [5]. 
One  patient  in  this  study  had  agoraphobia,  complicated 
by  PA,  and  reports  of  PA  complicated  by  agorapho-
bia  were  limited  to  this  case.  Although  the  mechanism 
behind  the  development  of  psychiatric  complications 
in  PA  patients  has  not  been  elucidated,  animal  experi-
ments have reported that MR, a receptor for aldosterone, 
was  also  expressed  in  the  hippocampus  and  amygdala, 
which  control  anxiety  and  fear  [8,  9].  Chronic  aldoste-
rone  administration  reportedly  increased  anxiety-like 
behavior in rats [10]. In the present case, the onset of the 

Kijima et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2023) 23:787 patient’s  agoraphobia  and  panic  attacks  was  consistent 
with  the  development  of  hypertension  from  PA.  Based 
on this, PA possibly induced her agoraphobia and panic 
attacks. The gradual decrease and eventual disappearance 
of psychiatric symptoms with eplerenone, an MR antago-
nist, also supported the association between PA and her 
agoraphobia and panic attacks.

Eplerenone is an MR antagonist, that selectively inhib-
its  MR.  It  is  used  to  treat  hypertension.  Unilateral  PA 
secondary to an adrenal adenoma is treated via unilateral 
adrenalectomy,  while  bilateral  PA  due  to  adrenal  hyper-
plasia is treated with MR antagonists, such as eplerenone. 
Pharmacotherapy  is  used  when  surgery  is  not  required. 
Based on rat experiments, the chronic administration of 
eplerenone induced anxiolytic effects [11]. In a previous 
report,  a  patient  with  PA,  complicated  by  panic  attacks, 
received  treatment  with  spironolactone,  another  MR 
antagonist.  The  patient’s  symptoms  gradually  improved 
with  pharmacological 
significantly 
enhanced  after  undergoing  an  adrenal  adenomectomy 
[6].  In  our  study,  the  patient  was  not  desirous  of  sur-
gery,  so  oral  eplerenone  was  prescribed.  The  patient’s 
agoraphobia  and  panic  attacks  improved  with  oral  MR 
antagonist  treatment,  and  the  symptoms  eventually  dis-
appeared. There have been no reports, documenting the 
complete  resolution  of  PA-associated  agoraphobia  and 
panic attacks with oral MR antagonist treatment alone.

treatment  and 

This study reports a case of PA, associated with agora-
phobia and panic attacks, that improved with eplerenone. 
Based  on  the  results  of  this  study,  eplerenone  was  an 
effective treatment option for PA-associated agoraphobia 
and panic attacks among patients not desirous of surgery.
