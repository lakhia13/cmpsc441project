Abstract

Background/Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) encompass a wide range of heart
and vascular conditions and remain the leading cause of death worldwide. Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychotherapeutic approach that integrates acceptance,
mindfulness, and commitment to value-based actions. This systematic review aims to
explore the current evidence on the potential role of ACT interventions in supporting psy-
chological well-being among individuals with CVDs. Methods: A systematic review was
conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search of the literature was conducted
through Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and PsycINFO databases. Six studies
met the inclusion criteria. Results: The reviewed studies suggest that ACT may promote
psychological flexibility, emotion regulation, and self-care behaviors in patients with CVDs.
Reported outcomes include improved mindfulness, reduced distress, and enhanced quality
of life. However, the evidence base is limited in both size and methodological rigor, with
included studies varying in design and population. Conclusions: While preliminary find-
ings indicate that ACT shows promise in addressing psychological aspects of CVDs, the
current evidence remains insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. Further high-quality,
large-scale studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and clinical applicability of ACT
in cardiovascular populations.

1. Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) encompass a broad spectrum of disorders including
ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and various other
cardiac and vascular conditions [1]. CVDs represent the leading cause of death worldwide,
claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually and significantly impacting overall quality
of life (QoL) [2,3]. Despite an overall decrease in global mortality rates, deaths attributed
to CVDs, particularly ischemic heart disease and stroke, have risen by a concerning 21.1%
between 2007 and 2017 [3,4]. Currently, heart attacks and strokes are responsible for 80% of
CVD deaths, with a particular impact on younger individuals, as one-third of these deaths
occur prematurely in those under 70 years old.

1.1. Epidemiological Burden in Italy

In Italy, CVDs are the leading cause of mortality, accounting for 44% of all deaths [5].
Moreover, cardiovascular disability affects a considerable segment of the population, with
a prevalence estimated at 4.4 per 1000 inhabitants [5]. These data highlight the urgent need
for innovative therapeutic approaches and effective preventive strategies to address this
growing public health challenge.

1.2. Stress as a Cardiovascular Risk Factor

Recent studies have identified stress as a significant and newly recognized risk factor
for CVDs. Prospective data from large-scale cohort studies confirm a strong association be-
tween stress and the incidence of stroke, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and other
cardiovascular manifestations [3,4]. While workplace stress and social isolation are the most
widely studied triggers, other psychosocial stressors—such as marital problems, caregiving
responsibilities, and bereavement—also contribute to cardiovascular risk. Stress-related
emotional disturbances, including depression [5,6], anxiety [7], psychological distress [8],
emotional exhaustion [9], and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [10], are not merely
causes of stress, but often emerge as its consequences.

1.3. The Interplay Between Depression and CVDs

In healthy individuals, depression increases the risk of coronary artery disease by
1.5 to 2.0 times, while in patients with pre-existing coronary disease, it raises the risk of
myocardial infarction by 1.5 to 4.5 times [11,12]. The coexistence of depression and CVDs
is associated with worse clinical outcomes and elevated healthcare costs. Conditions such
as hypertension and coronary heart disease are frequently accompanied by depression,
emphasizing the strong bidirectional link between mental health and cardiovascular risk.
Consequently, the Italian National Health Service (NHS) has prioritized prevention and
provided access to innovative cardiovascular treatments. A truly effective preventive
strategy should integrate interventions targeting lifestyle, risk factor modification, disease
management, and rehabilitation [13,14].

Nonetheless, significant challenges persist, ranging from the insufficient implementa-
tion of preventive strategies by physicians to issues such as patient mistrust and the spread
of misinformation, including fake news, regarding medications and the adoption of healthy
lifestyles. In general, it is crucial for every patient to actively participate in understanding
and managing key risk factors associated with CVDs, encompassing aspects like smoking,
physical activity, diet, and levels of blood cholesterol, glucose, and pressure.

Effective CVD prevention requires active patient participation in understanding and
managing key risk factors like smoking, diet, physical activity, and blood pressure, choles-
terol, and glucose levels [15,16]. However, the lack of internationally standardized guide-
lines for risk assessment and interventions remains a challenge. For elderly patients,
prevention programs face additional challenges due to emotional changes, altered body
perception, and diminished future expectations [17,18]. CVDs can also impair cognitive
function in older adults, potentially leading to somatic dysfunction and contributing to
geriatric depression.

Recognizing this association is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies in

CVD patients.

Research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques, particularly
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), can effectively motivate older adults to
adopt healthier lifestyles [19,20]. ACT is a form of CBT that uses mindfulness, accep-
tance, and commitment to enhance psychological flexibility. This approach differs from
traditional CBT by focusing on normal human cognition rather than specific deficits [21].

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1831

ACT offers several potential benefits for CVD management. By incorporating mindfulness
and acceptance techniques, this approach aids individuals in coping with stress, a major
risk factor for CVDs [21], thereby promoting emotional acceptance and improving mental
health [22]. Additionally, ACT emphasizes values-based actions, potentially leading to
healthier lifestyle choices [23], and enhances psychological flexibility, enabling individuals
to navigate life challenges more effectively, which may reduce their negative impact on
cardiovascular health [24]. Furthermore, ACT may improve adherence to medication and
self-management programs [25]. ACT’s different focus improves well-being and QoL of
those involved by advanced progressive illness, including caregivers and healthcare person-
nel. The ACT model consists of six interdependent and overlapping processes. The first is
acceptance, as creating a space for difficult thoughts and emotions rather than suppression
or avoidance them. Defusion is the detachment from negative thoughts and emotions to
reduce their influence on cognition. Contact with the present moment involves tuning into
what is happening in the environment right now maintaining flexible awareness hic et
nunc rather than being influenced by the past or future. Self as context is a viewpoint from
which we can observe thoughts and feelings, and a psychological space in which those
thoughts and feelings can move. It is a place from which we can observe our experience
without being caught up in it. Values are the vital and personally meaningful aspects of
life. Clarifying values allows the creation of behavioral change. The last element, com-
mitted action, involves engaging in patterns of effective action that are guided by core
values. These processes can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) mindfulness and
acceptance, and (2) commitment and behavior change [26]. ACT is a collaborative process
in which the therapist and the client work together to promote awareness, psychological
flexibility, and behavioral change towards a more satisfying and meaningful life [27]. A
significant advantage of ACT compared to other therapeutic approaches is its integration
of motivational and cognitive elements, leading to more enduring treatment outcomes [28].
There is a rapidly growing evidence base for the efficacy of ACT in the treatment of a broad
range of disorders and conditions, with recent systematic reviews describing its potential
value for CDVs [29–33].

This systematic review aims to evaluate the current body of research on the effective-

ness of ACT interventions in managing and preventing CVDs.

2. Materials and Methods

This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (see Figure 1) [34]
See Supplementary Materials for the PRISMA 2020 Checklist. A protocol for this review
was registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF), registration code/number: DOI
10.17605/OSF.IO/TCFPS, registration date: 13 March 2024.

2.1. Search Strategy

The studies were identified by searching in Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane,
and Psychinfo databases. All the studies fulfilling our selected criteria were evaluated
for possible inclusion. The search combined the following terms: (“acceptance and com-
mitment therapy” [MeSH Terms] OR (“acceptance” [All Fields] AND “commitment” [All
Fields] AND “therapy” [All Fields]) OR “acceptance and commitment therapy” [All Fields])
AND (“cardiovascular diseases” [MeSH Terms] OR (“cardiovascular” [All Fields] AND
“diseases” [All Fields]) OR “cardiovascular diseases” [All Fields] OR (“cardiovascular” [All
Fields] AND “disease” [All Fields]) OR “cardiovascular disease” [All Fields]). The search
terms were identified for title and abstract. After duplicates had been removed, all articles
were evaluated based on title and abstract.

This research was not restricted by the year of publication for the articles considered.
Inclusion criteria were (i) articles that enrolled human subjects, (ii) experiments that

examined ACT in CVDs patients, and (iii) articles in the English language only.

Exclusion criteria were (i) reviews and meta-analyses and (ii) duplicated studies.
The literature search was conducted between 15 February and 10 April 2024.

2.2. Study Selection

A total of 109 articles were identified through database searches. In total, 10 articles
duplicated were deleted, 17 reviews were removed, 42 studies were removed for title
screening, 4 for abstracts, and 28 articles were removed for text screening (Figure 1). In this
systematic review, we considered a total of 6 articles about the relationship between ACT
and CVDs. To minimize bias and ensure a robust selection process, two authors (A.G. and
I.V.) independently reviewed and extracted data from the studies. Any discrepancies were
resolved through collaborative discussion and consultation with a third author (D.L.). This
multi-step approach guaranteed that at least three researchers independently assessed each
article. In cases of persistent disagreement, all authors were involved in the final decision.
Data extraction relied solely on the full text of the articles.

2.3. Data Extraction and Analysis

After finalizing the selection through full-text review, data were extracted from the
included studies and compiled into a table using Microsoft Excel 2021. The extracted
information included key study characteristics: title, lead author, publication year, aims,
design, sample size, participant demographics, intervention and control details, baseline
measures, outcome types with assessment points, results, and key conclusions. We also
extracted data on reported effect sizes and power analyses. Cases where such data were
not provided by the original authors have been explicitly noted in in the corresponding
table. Additionally, inter-rater reliability between the two reviewers (I.V. and A.G.) was
assessed using the kappa statistic. The kappa score, exceeding the 0.61 threshold for
substantial agreement, indicated excellent concordance between the reviewers. This high
score underscores a robust data extraction process with a significant level of agreement.
Given the limited number and heterogeneity of the included studies (randomized controlled
trials, observational, and qualitative designs), we opted for a combined synthesis approach
to provide an exploratory overview of the emerging evidence on ACT in cardiovascular
populations. This strategy prioritizes hypothesis generation over definitive conclusions,
as stratification by design type was not feasible due to the small number of studies in
each category.

2.4. Assess Quality of Included Studies’ Risk of Bias

The risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using a revised
Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2) tool [34], which comprises five domains: (i) bias arising
from the randomization process, (ii) bias due to deviations from the intended interven-
tion, (iii) bias due to missing outcome data, (iv) bias in the measurement of the outcome,
and (v) bias in the selection of the reported result. Furthermore, the risk of bias in non-
randomized studies of exposures (ROBINS-E) tool [35] evaluates seven key domains that
can introduce bias: (i) bias due to confounding, (ii) bias arising from measurement of the
exposure, (iii) bias in selection of participants into the study (or into the analysis), (iv) bias
due to post-exposure interventions, (v) bias due to missing data, (vi) bias arising from
measurement of the outcome, and (vii) bias in the selection of the reported results (see [36]).

3. Results
3.1. Synthesis of Evidence

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the current body of research on the
effectiveness of ACT interventions in managing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). A total
of six studies were included (Table 1); two focused on exploring the mechanisms of ACT,
while the remaining four assessed patient outcomes. These studies encompassed a range
of methodological designs, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental
studies, observational research, and qualitative analyses. Given the heterogeneity of the
included designs and the limited number of studies, we opted to synthesize findings
across methodologies to provide a broad overview of the emerging evidence. However, we
acknowledge that this approach may weaken the internal validity of the conclusions due
to the lack of stratification by design type. Therefore, the results should be interpreted as
exploratory and hypothesis-generating, rather than definitive. Future reviews with larger
datasets may benefit from stratifying findings by study design to enhance interpretability
and methodological rigor.

3.2. Key Findings from Included Studies

The studies reviewed clarified the potential effectiveness of mechanisms of ACT such
as present-moment focus, mindfulness, and emotion regulation skills. Although not directly
assessed in terms of physiological parameters in the included studies, these processes have
been theoretically linked to autonomic regulation, particularly parasympathetic functioning.
This association is hypothesized to contribute to the perceived therapeutic value of ACT by
fostering a supportive and emotionally regulated environment during treatment sessions.
Similarly, Al-Hammouri et al. [37] explored the application of ACT in promoting self-care
behaviors among individuals with heart failure. Their study highlighted the essential role
of mindfulness, cognitive fusion, and committed action in the maintenance of self-care
practices. Notably, committed action positively affects self-care behavior, especially among
individuals with lower levels of mindfulness and cognitive fusion. These results emphasize
the importance of evidence-based interventions in enhancing self-care practices among
heart failure patients.

Studies investigating patient outcomes [39–42] demonstrated the positive effects of
ACT interventions across various cardiovascular conditions. Ghahnaviyeh’s study [38]
evidences the effectiveness of ACT intervention in ameliorating the QoL in patients with
myocardial infarction. ACT approach focuses on functional processes underlying impaired
behavioral manifestations rather than on a disorder’s characteristic symptoms developing
functional behavioral patterns. Instead of focusing on reducing the symptoms, the therapist
seeks to improve the patient’s overall QoL with his cooperation. This method improves
both mental and physical health. ACT intervention allows these patients to clarify their
values and goals, focusing on things they can change rather than on things they cannot.
In patients with myocardial infarction, basic activities such as sitting or lying down to
rest, going out, walking, climbing stairs, sleeping and shortness of breath are challenges.
As a result, patients learn that, in alignment with their beliefs, it is preferable to avoid
the negative/intrusive thoughts and the subsequent effects. In addition, Sheibani et al.
(2019) [39] examined the effects of ACT on emotion regulation and self-control strategies
in patients with coronary heart disease. Their findings indicated that group-based ACT
sessions help patients choose functional emotion regulation strategies, avoiding dysfunc-
tional ones. Fattahi et al. [40] further supported these findings by demonstrating that ACT
improved emotion regulation and self-compassion in cardiovascular patients. They suggest

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1831

8 of 14

that ACT interventions help patients accept their thoughts and feelings rather than trying
to change them, leading to more flexible and compassionate self-awareness. Similarly,
Large, Samuel, and Morris’s study [41] suggests that ACT can help stroke survivors accept
their condition through reappraisal and cognitive flexibility. However, the authors suggest
a tailored approach as each participant had diverse needs.

Overall, these studies provide encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of ACT
in improving mental and emotional well-being in patients with CVDs. The studies also
shed light on potential mechanisms by which ACT works, including fostering a supportive
therapeutic environment, promoting mindfulness and cognitive flexibility, and encouraging
acceptance and self-compassion.

3.3. Risk of Bias

The Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2) tool and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-
of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool were used to assess the risk of bias of the articles included in
this review. Figures 2 and 3 show the summary of the risk of bias assessment. Out of the
total studies assessed, one study showed some concerns about bias due to confounding [42].
Additionally, two studies displayed some concerns about bias in selection of participants
into the studies [37,42]. Moreover, only one study showed some concerns about bias
arising from measurement of the outcome [38]. Three studies exhibited high risk of bias to
deviations from the intended intervention [39–41]. Furthermore, one study showed high
risk of bias due to missing outcome data [40] and another some concerns [39]. Only one
study displayed some concerns about bias arising from the randomization process [41].

4. Discussion

This review provides preliminary evidence suggesting that ACT may support mental
and emotional well-being in patients with CVDs. The literature highlights the significant
psychological burden associated with these conditions, with patients frequently experienc-

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1831

9 of 14

ing fear, anxiety, and depression, which can hinder effective disease management [43]. ACT
has been proposed to address these challenges by promoting acceptance and psychological
flexibility [44]. Unlike traditional therapies focused on symptom suppression, ACT fosters
mindful observation of internal experiences, enabling patients to build resilience through
cognitive defusion and values-oriented behavior [45]. This therapeutic process may help
patients relate differently to distressing emotions, potentially enhancing emotional regu-
lation and interpersonal functioning. Furthermore, ACT facilitates the identification and
pursuit of personal values despite illness-related limitations [46].

Ghahnaviyeh et al. [38] found that ACT significantly improved both physical and
mental components of quality of life in myocardial infarction patients, with benefits main-
tained at a six-month follow-up. Similarly, Fattahi et al. [40] demonstrated a significant
long-term reduction in depression, anxiety, and stress, accompanied by improvements in
self-compassion and emotion regulation. Effect sizes were strongest for stress (η2 = 0.69), fol-
lowed by suppression, self-compassion, and anxiety. Additionally, the qualitative study by
Celano et al. (2016) [42] uniquely captured the experiential recovery process in post-stroke
patients. Participants reported that ACT helped them reinterpret disability-related limita-
tions and regain a sense of agency. Thematic analysis revealed that psychological flexibility
fostered by ACT contributed to improved coping, emotional regulation, and acceptance
of a changed reality [42]. Notably, earlier systematic reviews by Dindo et al. (2017) [43]
and McPhillips et al. (2019) [44] included 12 and 15 studies, respectively, but focused more
broadly on chronic illness or predated several recent contributions now included in the
present review. Similar lines of inquiry have also been explored by other authors, further
supporting the relevance of this topic [43–47]. By integrating newer trials with longitudi-
nal designs and diverse CVD populations (e.g., post-stroke, heart failure), this synthesis
offers enhanced depth and contemporary relevance. Nevertheless, the limited number of
included studies (n = 5) and their methodological diversity (three RCTs, one observational,
one qualitative) constrain the strength and generalizability of our conclusions.

Broader meta-analytic efforts remain necessary to quantify pooled effects across out-
comes and subgroups [48]. While this review focuses on ACT, it is important to acknowl-
edge other psychological interventions effective in CVD populations. Traditional cog-
nitive behavioral therapy (CBT), for instance, emphasizes cognitive restructuring and
has been widely used to reduce psychological distress and improve treatment adherence.
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and psychoeducational programs have also
shown promise, particularly in enhancing emotional regulation and reducing stress. Com-
pared to these approaches, ACT centers more explicitly on acceptance and values-driven
action rather than symptom elimination. Although some studies suggest ACT may offer
unique advantages for patients coping with chronic illness, direct head-to-head compar-
isons remain limited. Future research should aim to contrast ACT with these established
interventions to determine its relative efficacy and suitability for different patient profiles.
ACT may also offer added value by equipping individuals with effective emotion
regulation skills, which are critical for managing the psychological impact of CVD. Through
mindfulness and cognitive defusion, patients learn to observe thoughts and feelings with
greater clarity and reduced reactivity. This, in turn, lessens the intensity of negative emo-
tions and supports adaptive coping [49,50]. The importance of emotion regulation is
corroborated by studies such as [40,41], which report concurrent improvements in self-
compassion and psychological well-being. These psychological benefits may, according to
some hypotheses, positively influence cardiovascular outcomes, given the established link
between emotional distress and cardiac prognosis [47]. Overall, the findings reviewed here
indicate that ACT may contribute to reduced psychological distress, enhanced emotion
regulation, and improved self-compassion in CVD patients [37–42]. For example, ACT

Healthcare 2025, 13, 1831

10 of 14

has been shown to help stroke survivors accept their new reality, reinforcing its broader
potential in chronic care contexts [42]. By complementing traditional medical treatments
with a psychological framework rooted in flexibility and meaning, ACT may promote
active engagement in health management [39]. Some studies highlight the need for tai-
lored interventions, suggesting that ACT protocols should be adapted to specific CVD
subgroups. Furthermore, future research should explore digital delivery platforms (e.g.,
mobile-based ACT) and assess the cost-effectiveness of these approaches. As emphasized
across several studies, interventions that promote acceptance and values-guided behavior
may work synergistically with standard care by targeting psychosocial determinants of
cardiovascular prognosis.

Finally, ACT has been associated with benefits beyond mental health. Some studies
report improved cognitive function, possibly related to enhanced psychological flexibility
and present-moment focus [49]. ACT may also promote greater adherence to treatment
plans by helping patients accept their condition and commit to valued actions [50]. By
encouraging patients to identify what truly matters to them and focus on controllable
aspects of life, ACT fosters a sense of agency, even in the presence of functional limitations
[50. Ultimately, ACT may enhance quality of life for individuals with CVD by supporting
psychological adjustment and personal growth in the context of chronic disease [50]. While
these outcomes are promising, they must be interpreted with caution. Given the hetero-
geneity of included studies, the present findings remain exploratory. Future systematic
reviews should aim for clearer stratification by study design and larger sample sizes to
support stronger, evidence-based conclusions.

In particular, future meta-analytic efforts will be essential to quantify the pooled
effect of ACT interventions on psychological and health-related outcomes in CVD popu-
lations. This will require more homogeneous data across studies in terms of design and
measurement. The methodological heterogeneity of the included studies—encompassing
randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional designs, and one qualitative investigation—
reflects the exploratory nature of the field. We chose to include all relevant study types
to ensure a comprehensive mapping of the existing literature. However, this approach
inevitably limits direct comparisons between outcomes and reduces the possibility of syn-
thesis across designs. Another important limitation is the incomplete reporting of effect
sizes and power analysis across studies, which reduces the ability to compare the efficacy
of ACT interventions quantitatively. We emphasize that the small number of available
studies significantly limits the generalizability of our findings, and this review should be
interpreted as an initial synthesis of a still-developing area of research.

4.1. Limitations

Although this systematic review provides valuable insights, there are some limitations
that need to be considered. First, only five studies met the inclusion criteria, which limits
the statistical and conceptual power of the review. Among these, three were randomized
controlled trials, two were observational studies, and one was qualitative. Overall, the
studies included small sample sizes, ranging from 12 to 165 participants, with the largest
being an exploratory cross-sectional study. This limited number and heterogeneity of
studies may impact the generalizability of our findings. However, this reflects the relatively
recent application of ACT in the context of CVD management, where evidence is still
emerging. Further high-quality, large-scale clinical trials are needed to better evaluate the
efficacy, feasibility, and implementation of ACT in patients with CVDs.

4.2. Future Directions

Looking ahead, the future of ACT for CVD management holds significant promise. We
can expect continued research efforts to refine ACT protocols, tailoring them to the unique
needs of different CVD patient subgroups. This personalized approach ensures interven-
tions effectively address the challenges faced by individuals with varying conditions and
severities. Technological advancements and telehealth hold the potential to revolutionize
access to ACT. Digital platforms and mobile applications delivering ACT-based therapy
could significantly broaden dissemination, reaching a wider population of CVD patients,
including those in underserved or remote areas. Furthermore, fostering collaboration
between healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers is essential to seamlessly inte-
grate ACT into comprehensive CVDs care models. Advocating for reimbursement policies
and insurance coverage for psychological interventions like ACT will ensure equitable
access to these evidence-based treatments.

As our understanding of the psychological aspects of CVDs deepens, the importance
of addressing patients’ emotional and mental well-being alongside physical health becomes
increasingly clear. ACT provides a valuable framework for achieving this holistic approach
by promoting acceptance, psychological flexibility, and alignment with personal values.

5. Conclusions

This systematic review provides preliminary evidence suggesting that ACT may
support emotional well-being and psychological flexibility in individuals with heart failure
and other cardiovascular conditions. Across the limited number of studies included,
ACT interventions appeared to promote self-regulation, improve coping strategies, and
reduce psychological distress. However, the heterogeneity in study designs, small sample
sizes, and limited methodological robustness significantly constrain the generalizability of
these findings. Given these limitations, the current literature does not allow for definitive
conclusions about ACT’s clinical effectiveness in CVD populations. Nonetheless, the
promising patterns observed highlight the potential of ACT as a complementary approach
in cardiovascular care. Future research should prioritize large-scale randomized controlled
trials with standardized protocols and long-term follow-up to rigorously assess the efficacy,
mechanisms of action, and implementation strategies of ACT in this context.
