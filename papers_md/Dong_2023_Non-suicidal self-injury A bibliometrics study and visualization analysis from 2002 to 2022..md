Objective: To overview the research actuality and offer
the hotspots and
cutting-edge issues in the ﬁeld of Non-suicidal Self-injury (NSSI) by using
bibliometric analysis.

Materials and methods: Publications related to NSSI from 2002 to 2022 were
extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. CiteSpace
V 6.1.R2 and VOSviewer 1.6.18 were used to visually analyzed institutions, countries,
journals, authors, references, and keywords in research on NSSI.

Results: A total of 799 studies about NSSI were analyzed via CiteSpace and
VOSviewer. The number of annual publications related to NSSI is ﬂuctuating growth.
The USA and Harvard University are the most productive country and institutions.
In the case of journals and co-cited journals, Psychiatry Research are the most
productive journal and also ranked highest among co-cited journals. Furthermore,
Michael Kaess has published the most publications, and Matthew K. Nock is the
most cited author. An article published by Swannell SV et al. shows the highest
citation counts. After analysis, the most common keywords are harm, adolescents
and prevalence. The gender difference, diagnosis, and dysregulation are frontier
areas of NSSI research.

Conclusion: This study analyzed the research of NSSI from multiple perspectives,
and provides valuable information for researchers to capture the current status, hot
spots, and frontier trends of NSSI.

1. Introduction

Non-suicidal Self-injury (NSSI) is described as deliberate, direct destruction or alteration of
body tissue without conscious suicidal intent (1). This includes any behave that maybe cause
harm but not death to oneself, such as cutting, burning, scratching, and impingement (2).
A study on NSSI have pointed out that an increasing trend globally, including in developing

countries and it is almost equally prevalent in both developing
and developed countries (3). A large number of studies has
conﬁrmed that NSSI is motivated by intrapersonal/self-regulating
and interpersonal/social functions (3). Even people who show only
one or two acts of NSSI admit at least one function for their act, and
the intrapersonal function is the most common (4). NSSI has become
a common mental health threat among people, the prevalence of
NSSI is 46.5% in adolescents and 23% in young adults (5). There
has high number of clinical assessment instruments and diversity of
evaluations about NSSI research, the most frequent instruments of
NSSI are structured interviews and their indicators were related to
NSSI function and topography (6).

Many patients with non-suicidal suicide don’t take it seriously
without treatment and eventually evolve into other psychiatric
disorders such as borderline personality disorders (BPD), anxiety
disorders, and aﬀective disorders (7). The therapies of NSSI that were
identiﬁed as eﬀective were cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectic
behavioral therapy for adolescents (DBT-A), and mentalization-
based therapy for adolescents (MBT-A) (8). Furthermore, in recent
study the cognitive behavior hypnotherapy was found to be eﬀective
in treating the non-suicidal self-injury condition (9).

Bibliometrics is a mathematical and statistical method that
analyzes and observes research trends and is widely applied in many
ﬁelds (10). It plays an important role in developing guidelines and
understanding research hotspots. We can quickly clarify the structure
of literature, analyze the development process, and capture the
research hotspots of research ﬁelds by using bibliometrics analysis
(11). This study aimed to use CiteSpace and VOSviewer scientiﬁc
softwares to analyze literatures related to NSSI over the past 20 years
and explore its research hotspots and development trends, and also to
provide a thinking direction for future research.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Data sources

The retrieval data were extracted from the Science Citation
Index-Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC).
The WoSCC is the most frequently used and acceptable database
for scientiﬁc or bibliometric studies. It contains nearly 9,000
of the world’s most prestigious high-impact journals and more
to
than 12,000 academic conferences (12), so we selected it
perform the search. Relevant publications were downloaded within
1 day on December 4, 2022. The process of data extraction
was presented in Figure 1. The search strategy was [TI = (non-
suicidal self-injur∗ OR non-suicidal self-injur∗ OR non-suicidal
self-harm∗ OR “NSSI”) OR AK = (non-suicidal self-injur∗ OR
non-suicidal self-injur∗ OR non-suicidal self-harm∗ OR “NSSI”)].
To capture as many data sources as possible,
the wildcard
character (∗) that could be substituted for any other characters
and allows variable endings of keywords was used (13). For
example, “non-suicidal self-injur∗” would also return the terms
of “non-suicidal self-injury” and “non-suicidal self-injurious.” The
dates of the search restricted from January 1, 2002, to December
4, 2022, resulting in 1,658 records. This was followed by 220
unrelated document types, including conference abstracts, editorial
material, corrections, correspondence, retractions, and conference

proceedings, and 1,438 results were remaining. Then, restricting
language as English there left 1,406 results. Next, two independent
investigators reviewed the titles and abstracts and excluded articles
that were not associated with NSSI, eventually 799 publications were
remained.

2.2. Analysis tool

All search datas retrieved WOSCC were converted to VOSviewer

and CiteSpace to perform visual analysis.

VOSviewer is a computer program developed by Van Eck and
Waltman at Leiden University in the Netherlands in 2009 that is
suitable for constructing complex networks using large-scale data
(14). It provides visual analysis and creates maps based on network
data. It can construct network diagrams of academic publications,
scientiﬁc journals, authors, research institutions, countries, and
keywords. The items in these networks can be connected by co-
citation links, co-occurrence, citation, and bibliographic coupling
(15). Each node of the network maps represented elements such
as country,
institution, or keyword, the size and color of the
nodes reﬂected frequency and cluster of elements, respectively (16).
The links between nodes represented the co-authorship, co-citation
or co-occurrence associations between nodes and the color of
the nodes and lines indicated diﬀerent clusters or corresponding
average appearing year (AAY) (17). We use VOSviewer to analyze
institution, co-cited journals, authors, co-cited authors and keywords.
VOSviewer software parameter settings: Normalization Method:
association strength;
the minimum publication thresholds for
institutions and authors are all 5, respectively; the minimum citation
thresholds for journals, authors, and references are 100, 100, and
50, respectively; and the minimum keyword occurrence threshold
is 15 (18).

Science

CiteSpace is created by Dr. Chaomei Chen (School of
and Technology, Drexel University,
Information
Philadelphia, PA, USA) and his team in 2004 (11). Burst detection,
betweenness centrality, and heterogeneous networks are three central
concepts of CiteSpace, which help to quantitatively and visually
summarize previous research, and identify trends and key change
nodes in a timely manner. We used CiteSpace to analyze institution,
countries, dual-map overlay of journals and strongest citation bursts
of references and keywords. We downloaded the records retrieved
by WoSCC, and then converted these data into plain text format
for export, including complete records and references, which was
named download_ XXX. txt, and ﬁnally imported into citespace
(V.6.1.R2) for bibliometric and visual analysis (19). The speciﬁc
parameters used in CiteSpace were set as follows: time span (from
January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2022, year per slice = 1), top N
(50), term source (title, abstract, author keywords, and keywords
plus), node types (author,
institution, country, keywords, cited
reference, cited author, and cited journal), network clipping method
(pathﬁnder) (20). The remaining settings maintain the software
default. Diﬀerent nodes in a map represented indexes including a
country and institution, or journal. The size of the nodes spoke on
behalf of the centrality of publications or frequency, and a node with
large size typically indicated high occurrence or citation frequency
as a pivotal point, meanwhile, the links between nodes showed the
network of cooperation, collaboration, or co-citation, and the color
of nodes and links indicated diﬀerent clusters (21).

132 publications output in 2021, indicating that NSSI is receiving
increasing attention.

3.1. Analysis of publication years

The number of publications per speciﬁc period reﬂects the
development trend of research in this ﬁeld (Figure 2; 14). As shown in
Figure 2, From 2002 to 2010, publication outputs during this period
were low, the research on NSSI had a slow development speed. Since
2011, the number of publications has gradually increased, reaching

3.2. Analysis of institutions

A total of 346 institutions involved in the publications about NSSI
and the top 10 productive institutions are listed in Table 1. Harvard
University (n = 40) has the most publications, followed by Heidelberg

University (n = 31) and Katholieke University Leuven (n = 27). The
network map of institution cooperation was generated by CiteSpace
(Figure 3), in which each node represents an institution and the size
of the node indicates the number of publications by the institution.
The bigger the size of nodes is, the more publication output of
institution is. Besides, the purple outer ring of the circle is centrality,
the wider the circle, the higher is the centrality (22). It can be
seen that there were relatively few collaborations among institutions
from diﬀerent countries, only three institutions including Harvard
University (centrality: 0.34), Harvard Medical School (centrality:0.26)
and Katholieke University Leuven (centrality:0.14) had the value of
centrality more than 0.1. The institution co-authorship analysis was
generated by VOSviewer (Figure 4). According to the color gradient
in the lower right corner, these institutions such as Duke University

3.3. Analysis of countries and funding
agencies

According to statistics, a total of 799 articles related to NSSI were
published in 50 countries. The top 10 countries are listed in Table 2.
The United States had the most publications (n = 330), followed by
China (n = 109) and Germany (n = 84). This phenomenon may be
related to the population of the countries. The larger the population,
the greater the number of psychological problems associated with
NSSI, which can arouse the attention of clinical workers and
researchers. The country cooperation map was conducted CiteSpace
(Figure 5), in which each node represents a country, and the size
of the node is proportional to the number of articles published by
country. Links between nodes signify relationships of collaboration or
co-occurrence or co-citation among countries (23). The ﬁgure shows
the close cooperation between the USA and other countries including
Belgium, Australia, and Germany etc. Besides, The USA leads in
both single-country and multi-country publications among diﬀerent
countries. It’s worth noting that Italy’s centrality is 0, which indicates
Italy has relatively few collaborations with other countries. In Table 3,
top 10 funding sources in the ﬁeld of NSSI research are listed.
summarizes the data of the top 10 most frequent funding sources in
this ﬁeld. Obviously, the United States has a large percentage, with
ﬁve funding agencies in the United States. The USA also published
the most relevant articles, it is apparent that the wealth of diﬀerent
countries can inﬂuence research in certain degree.

3.4. Analysis of journals and cited journals

To ﬁnd the core and authoritative journals in the ﬁeld
of NSSI, we conducted the analysis of
literature sources (24).
The top 10 journals are shown in Table 4. The ﬁrst was

From the ﬁgure, we can found that one main citation path. The
publications related to NSSI were published in the journals of
psychology, education, and health, but the most cited publications
were published in the journals of psychology, education, and
social.

3.5. Analysis of authors and cited authors

A total of 445 authors published related articles on NSSI. As
shown in Figure 8, the author’s authorship was conducted by
VOSviewer. Each color represents a cluster, there were 21 clusters in
ﬁgure. Active collaborations usually exist in the same cluster, such as
Michael Kaess and Peter Parzer; there were also collaborations among
linked two nodes in diﬀerent clusters, such as Matthew K. Nock
and Laurence Claes (25). Besides, some clusters has no collaboration
with others, which indicated further cooperation with authors in the
ﬁeld of NSSI. The top 10 related authors and co-citation are listed
in Table 5. The most productive author was Michael Kaess, who
contributed 35 publications, followed by Franz Resch (n = 26) and
Paul L. Plener (n = 23). Co-cited author analysis refers to when the
literatures of two authors are simultaneously cited by a third author.
The visualization density map of co-citation author’s analysis was
generated by VOSviewer (Figure 9), in which 43 authors were cited
at least 100 times. We could clearly view the high-frequency co-
cited authors, the deeper the color, the more citations. The highest
frequency co-citation author is Matthew K. Nock, followed by E.
David Klonsky and Jennifer J. Muehlenkamp.

3.6. Analysis of co-cited references

Co-cited references are references that have been co-cited in
a set of publications (26, 27). Usually cited references with the
highest frequency are the main focus of the researchers. The top
10 co-cited references related to NISS are listed in Table 6, and
each of them was co-cited more than 90 times. The ﬁrst co-cited
reference was published by Swannell SV et al., which investigated
the methodological factors aﬀecting heterogeneity in estimates of
prevalence of NSSI, the time eﬀects, and overall international NSSI
prevalence (28). The second co-cited reference was published by
Matthew K. Nock et al. In 2006, which reported on the diagnostic
correlates of adolescents with a recent history of NSSI and examines
the relation between NSSI and suicide attempts (29). The third co-
cited reference was published by Matthew K. Nock et al. in 2004,
which this study applied a functional approach to the assessment
of self-mutilative behavior among adolescent psychiatric inpatients
(30). The network map of co-cited references timeline view was
conducted by CiteSpace (Figure 10), which displays the evolution
of research hotspots over time. Clusters were formed by selecting
keywords, and then a total of 11 clusters were generated by LLR
algorithm; each of these clusters represents the activity of its future
direction, the denser and more active the clusters in the graph, the
more they represent the current research frontier (31). The elements
on the horizontal axis represent co-cited references; the position
of the element on the horizontal axis denotes the time of the ﬁrst

occurrence; and the line connecting the elements denotes the co-
cited relationship. The size of the element is proportional to the
citation count of the reference (32). As shown in Figure 10, cluster
#0 (community sample), #8 (diagnostic correlate) and #9 (sexual
abuse) started earlier; while cluster #4 (eating disordered behavior),
and #6 (non-suicidal self-injury) are still continuous, which could be
regarded as the frontier.

References with citation bursts are those that have been cited
signiﬁcantly more frequently over a period (33). The years between
“Begin” and “End” represent the period when the reference was
more inﬂuential; years in light green mean that the reference has
not yet appeared, years in dark green mean that the reference is
less inﬂuential, and years in red mean that the reference is more
inﬂuential (34). The top 25 references with the strongest citation
bursts were generated by CiteSpace (Figure 11). The strongest
burstness (strength = 27.35) occurred in a paper entitled “Prevalence
of Non-suicidal Self-Injury in Non-clinical Samples: Systematic
Review, Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression”(28), published in

(n = 321), “non-suicidal self-injury” (n = 267) and “behavior”
(n = 220). The network of co-occurrence keywords was generated by
VOSviewer (Figure 12), in which 97 keywords occurrence at 15 times.
The keywords formed four clusters: cluster 1 (red color), cluster 2
(blue color), cluster 3 (yellow color), cluster 4 (green color), which

connecting lines between the keywords indicated the frequency of co-
occurrence between the two keywords (37). The overlay visualization
of keywords was generated by VOSviewer (Figure 13), where the
color indicated the average published year. As we can see, ecological
momentary assessment, dysregulation and gender diﬀerence are
emerging ﬁelds that were colored yellow (17).

The burst detection in Citespace, based on Kleinberg’s algorithm,
aims to ﬁgure out a meaningful document ﬂow structure with
respect to time lapse. Keywords bursts provide helpful
insight
into the research footprint of the research focus (38). The top
25 keywords with the strongest citation bursts were generated by
CiteSpace (Figure 14). The blue line means the time interval,

while the red line means the time period with a keyword bursting
(26). “mutilation” had the strongest burst (strength = 13.39) from
2008 to 2016. Notably, “gender diﬀerence” (strength = 5.56),
“diagnosis”(strength = 3.41), “dysregulation” (strength = 2.58) are
still in burstness, they are considered as frontier in the ﬁeld of NSSI
research.

In this article, we used CiteSpace and VOSviewer to visually
analyze studies on NSSI from 2002 to 2022, which aimed to help

researchers grasp developmental trends in this ﬁeld. 799 publications
related to NSSI were searched from the WoSSC.

• As shown in Figure 2, the number of publications related
to NSSI shows slightly ﬂuctuated growth. There were small
numbers of publications in this ﬁeld that began to appear from
2002 to 2010, but in the meantime, however, this research is still

in its infancy (28). Since 2011, the number of publications began
to rapidly increase, it can be seen that the NSSI research is got
more attention. Overall, the number of publications is up which
represents NSSI research will has good development trend in the
future.

According to the analysis of countries in Figure 5, the USA
was the most productive country and the number of publications
overwhelmingly exceeded other countries. It is inseparable from the
local funding agencies (27). Among the top 10 funding agencies,
ﬁve were from the USA and it shows the strong academic impact
of the USA on the research related to NSSI. As shown in Table 1,
ﬁve institutions were from the USA, and Harvard University shows
the highest centrality (0.34), which indicates it plays a pivotal part in
bridging cooperation among institutions worldwide.

Furthermore, according to the top 10 authors in Table 5,
Michael Kaess from the Heidelberg University contributed the most
publications. But Mattew K. Nock had the most value of centrality
(0.32), which shows he played a vital leadership role in this ﬁeld and it
is worthwhile for novice researchers in this ﬁeld to deeply research his
publications. As for co-cited authors, the publications of ﬁve authors
were cited more than 400 times and Matthew K. Nock (n = 1,412)
had the highest number of citations. Signiﬁcantly, Michael Kaess had
the most signiﬁcant number of published articles without ranking
in top 10 cited journals, whereas Mattew K. Nock published articles
far lwss than Michael Kaess could listed ﬁrst in co-citation journals.
Therefore, it can be seen that we should not only pay attention to the
number of articles, but also the quality of articles, and improve the
impact of the research in the future.

As shown in Table 4, the journal with the most articles about
NSSI was the Psychiatry Research (n = 105, IF = 11.225) and there
is only two journal’s impact factor exceeded 10.0, whereas there
was a journal’s impact factor is 1.899 that JQR ranked Q4. It can
be seen that publishing articles related to NSSI in high-IF journals

are a huge challenge. As for co-cited journals, Psychiatry Research
(n = 1,626) is also the journal with the highest citations. It is helpful
to ﬁnd the core journals published in the research about NSSI
by analyzing the distribution of literature sources. It follows that
the cited publications are all from high-impact journals, showing
it is attached great importance to research NSSI in the worldwide
academic ﬁeld. The most co-cited reference was retrospective analysis
of the prevalence of NSSI in non-clinical samples by Sarah V Swannell
et al. (28).

The research hotspots and development dynamics in the ﬁeld of
NSSI can be captured from the keywords’ co-occurrence network and
bursts reﬂect (39). By analyzing the frequency of the keywords and

the keyword clustering analysis, it can be concluded that the research
hotspots of NSSI are as follows:

(1) Study on the behavior character of NSSI and its harm
to patients can help to ﬁnd the corresponding treatment
fundamentally (40).

(2) Study on the prevalence and risk factors of NSSI can better
understand the phenomenology of NSSI and solve the diﬀerent
problems of the population (41). And the development of
standardized methodology in NSSI research is vital when
researchers estimate prevalence.

(3) Adolescent is the main group of NSSI research. The main cause
is that numerous research showed that the NSSI prevalence of
adolescents is higher. Surely, it also involved patients in the
population of children (26), adults, bisexuality (27), and so on.
The research population was gradually diversiﬁed and enriched.

(4) NSSI related to depression closely. Lu Wang, et al. (42)
concluded that there is a relationship between NSSI and suicide
risk in patients with depression. Koray Kara, et al. (43) discussed
the relationship between NSSI and depression, concluded that
depressive symptoms are more common in individuals with
NSSI behaviors in a forensic adolescent population.

Additionally, keywords with the strongest citation bursts can
reﬂect emerging trends and research frontiers. In this study, three
frontiers of related research were captured as follows via CiteSpace: a
meta-analysis (2018–2022), ecological momentary assessment (2020–
2022), and diagnosis (2020–2022).

1. Gender diﬀerence: Gender diﬀerence in NSSI is not a static
gap, but evolves across time, widening in mid-adolescence and
disappearing by early adulthood (44). Moye Xin, et al. (45)
investigated potential gender diﬀerences in the interrelations
between diﬀerent types of stressful life events and non-suicidal
self injury (NSSI) among Chinese youth, clarifying the risk
factors in aﬀecting NSSI from male and female perspectives
respectively. Fang Cheng, et al. (46) in their study found that
in the path analysis model with the introduction of mediating
eﬀects, the inﬂuence of gender diﬀerences on NSSI behavior

becomes more pronounced under the interaction of multiple
factors: women seem to be more signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the external derivatives in the internal derivatives than male
subjects, and are more likely to trigger NSSI behavior under the
interaction of multiple factors.

2. Diagnosis: Numerous research focus on studying diagnostic
methods of the NSSI to promote to treat this disease. Maria
Zetterqvist et al. (47) discussed the clinical utility of the NSSI
diagnosis by using the Clinical Assessment of Non-suicidal
Self-Injury Disorder Index (CANDI) and proved CANDI was
a feasible tool
to evaluate NSSI in adolescents not only
restricted in adults. Jill M Hooley et al. (48) particularly analyze
the NSSI diagnostic challenges and consider current issues
in its diagnosis.

3. Dysregulation: Desregulation are usually considered as emotion
dysregulation in the ﬁeld of NSSI research, which many
researchers ﬁnd it closely connects with NSSI. Hedvig
Andersson, et al. (49) considered that emotion dysregulation
has been identiﬁed as a core mechanism in the development
and maintenance of NSSI and it is therefore an important
target when addressing NSSI. Additionally, So Yung Yang,
et al. (50) also found the emotion dysregulation mediated the

association between childhood trauma and NSSI and emphasize
that promoting emotion regulation strategies could prevent
NSSI behavior in patients with mood disorders.

5. Strengths and limitations

As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst study in the Web of Science
database that using bibliometric analysis to visually analyze NSSI
from institutions, countries, authors, journals, co-cited references.
Based on comprehensive indexes like journals, authors, countries,
and institutions, bibliometric can conduct an in-depth evaluation of
the research trends and the focus of a certain ﬁeld; the combination
of the knowledge map and visualized analysis can quantitatively
reﬂect research status and practical applications simultaneously, and
demonstrate the distribution of collaborations among countries,
regions, disciplines, etc., (22, 51), other review types like systematic
review and meta-analysis can’t make a summary from a monolithic
and comprehensive perspective for speciﬁc ﬁelds of NSSI research.
However, there also are some limitations to our study. The data about
NSSI publications were only extracted from the WoSCC database

6. Conclusion

Funding

From bibliometric analysis and visualization of NSSI, it is can
be seen that related literature developed rapidly at present. The
USA is the most productive country and Michael Kaess is the most
proliﬁc author in this ﬁeld. Psychiatry Research has the largest
publications about NSSI. The research of NSSI hotspots and frontiers
has been mentioned above and it will be very helpful to the
researchers in this ﬁeld.
