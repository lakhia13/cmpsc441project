Abstract

Background: Increasing evidence suggests that psychological well-being (PWB) is associated with lower disease
and mortality risk, and may be enhanced with relatively low-cost interventions. Yet, dissemination of these
interventions remains limited, in part because insufficient attention has been paid to distinct PWB dimensions,
which may impact physical health outcomes differently.

Methods: This essay first reviews the empirical evidence regarding differential relationships between all-cause
mortality and multiple dimensions of PWB (e.g., life purpose, mastery, positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism). Then,
individual-level positive psychology interventions aimed at increasing PWB and tested in randomized-controlled trials
are reviewed as these allow for easy implementation and potentially broad outreach to improve population well-being,
in concert with efforts targeting other established social determinants of health.

Results: Several PWB dimensions relate to mortality, with varying strength of evidence. Many of positive psychology
trials indicate small-to-moderate improvements in PWB; rigorous institution-level interventions are comparatively few,
but preliminary results suggest benefits as well. Examples of existing health policies geared towards the improvement
of population well-being are also presented. Future avenues of well-being epidemiological and intervention research,
as well as policy implications, are discussed.
Conclusions: Although research in the fields of behavioral and psychosomatic medicine, as well as health psychology
have substantially contributed to the science of PWB, this body of work has been somewhat overlooked by the public
health community. Yet, the growing interest in documenting well-being, in addition to examining its determinants and
consequences at a population level may provoke a shift in perspective. To cultivate optimal well-being—mental,
physical, social, and spiritual—consideration of a broader set of well-being measures, rigorous studies, and
interventions that can be disseminated is critically needed.

Background
Over the past decades, evidence for the mental and
physical health benefits of enhanced psychological well-
being (PWB) has expanded dramatically [1–3]. Notably,
research in the fields of behavioral and psychosomatic
medicine, as well as health psychology have substantially
contributed to this body of work [1–7]. Yet, such work
is still overlooked by a considerable proportion of the
public health community, despite accumulating compel-
ling reasons for a paradigm shift [8]. Associations of
PWB levels with subsequent physical health outcomes
have been well-documented [1, 2]. Easy-to-implement
well-being interventions have been developed and evalu-
ated in randomized-controlled trials (RCT), with many
showing positive results [9, 10]. The potential for devel-
oping scalable interventions to be broadly disseminated
is substantial and, in many cases, could require only lim-
ited or no professional training resources [9, 10]. Such
interventions would improve not only PWB, but may
have the potential to promote and maintain physical
health as well [11]. This could be done in concert with
efforts targeting other established social determinants of
physical health/mortality (e.g., poverty, education, dis-
crimination, social capital) [12, 13]. Existing skepticism
among scientists may be due to insufficient attention
paid to distinct dimensions of PWB (e.g., positive affect,
optimism), which could differentially impact physical
health and explain certain conflicting findings [2]. If
PWB’s importance is to be embraced by the public
health community and incorporated into policies, these
distinctions need to be made clear. In this debate article,
we argue that PWB dimensions, including life purpose,
personal growth, mastery, autonomy, ikigai, life satisfac-
tion, positive affect, sense of coherence, and optimism,
may relate differently to all-cause mortality, based on
existing empirical evidence. We also discuss some avail-
able interventions promoting PWB and how these might
be used and disseminated more broadly.

PWB is important not only because of its potential ef-
fects on physical health but also as its own end. The
World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a
“state of complete physical, mental, and social well-
being and not merely the absence of disease or infirm-
ity.” Importantly, PWB reflects more than the mere ab-
sence of psychological distress, such as anxiety or
depressive symptoms. Although there is an inverse cor-
relation between self-reported positive and negative
psychological states, most coefficients vary from small-
to-moderate, but are generally not strong in magnitude
[14–16]. Psychological distress and well-being also have
distinct biological correlates,
further supporting the
idea that they are separate rather than mirrored con-
structs [15, 17–19]. Accordingly, a successful psycho-
therapeutic or pharmacological treatment of anxiety

symptoms will decrease symptoms of psychological dis-
tress but will not necessarily translate into a greater
sense of purpose in life, autonomy, or optimism.

If we are to take seriously the WHO’s integrative
conceptualization of health, PWB should be embraced as
a fundamental public health goal [8]. The adoption of
policies and programs supporting PWB in individuals
and groups requires an understanding of the potential
community benefits of such efforts. Through our assess-
ment of the research investigating the relationship be-
tween PWB and all-cause mortality,
interventions to
change PWB, and policy implications of well-being re-
search, we aim to contribute to this understanding.

Defining well-being
Well-being is a complex and multifactorial construct. Mea-
sures of well-being are sometimes divided into objective
measures, which mostly refer to “standard of living,” and
subjective measures, which capture psychological, social,
and spiritual aspects and are based on cognitive and
affective judgements individuals make about their lives [20].
When these measures concern psychological aspects (e.g.,
happiness), they are often referred to as measures of psy-
chological well-being (PWB). While certain PWB dimen-
sions such as life satisfaction are often imbedded in “quality
of life” measures, this latter multidimensional construct is
much broader and includes other aspects related to mental
and physical health like perceived stress, functioning/dis-
ability status, and physical symptoms [21, 22]. PWB on its
own has been a central area of research in psychology for
decades [7]. It is also important to epidemiology, to under-
stand its contribution to health outcomes [8], and more
broadly to public health, notably to implement country-
level monitoring and policies promoting overall health [7].

Distinct theoretical dimensions have been proposed to
characterize PWB research thus far (see [1] for details)
including: hedonic well-being (e.g., feeling happy), evalu-
ative well-being (e.g. being satisfied with life), eudaimo-
nic well-being (e.g.,
finding purpose in life, having a
sense of mastery and autonomy in one’s own decisions),
and other constructs that contribute to feeling whole or
well (e.g., optimism). In the following section, we de-
scribe these PWB dimensions and illustrate their poten-
tial effects on physical health by examining the evidence
on how each is associated with all-cause mortality. Even
though composite PWB measures exist, some authors
have shown that it remains difficult to measure PWB
across a continuum (unidimensionally) [23] and others
have insisted on understanding PWB as a multidimen-
sional, rather than unidimensional, construct [24]. More-
over, research has documented statistically significant
associations among PWB dimensions themselves, with
magnitude of estimates varying from small to moderate
when evaluated among adults from various countries

[14, 25–28]. Overall, these findings suggest that although
PWB dimensions may share a latent factor, they do rep-
resent distinct constructs.

Psychological well-being and mortality
A growing body of evidence suggests that various PWB
dimensions are associated with subsequent chronic dis-
eases and mortality, and potential mechanisms explain-
ing associations, including stress-buffering effects [1, 2]
and healthier behaviors [1, 2, 5, 29]. For instance, prior
epidemiological research has shown that individuals ex-
periencing higher levels of optimism were more likely to
subsequently engage in favorable habits (e.g., physical ac-
tivity), reduce/cease detrimental ones (e.g., smoking),
leading to an overall healthy lifestyle [30–33]; in turn,
the adoption of such healthy habits may lower one’s risk
of chronic diseases and mortality [1, 2]. However, it is
not always clear whether these longitudinal relationships
remain after rigorous confounder control, whereby a
third factor, such as socioeconomic status (e.g., educa-
tion, personal income), influences both PWB and health.
Likewise, whether these longitudinal associations do not
simply capture reverse causation, whereby health status
drives PWB levels,
is sometimes uncertain. However,
considering premature mortality risk, an objective end-
point, offers some methodological strengths such as vir-
tually no misclassification and research based on
longitudinal design by nature of the outcome. Recent
meta-analyses have suggested that life satisfaction, posi-
tive affect, meaning/purpose in life, and optimism are
protective against premature mortality [34–36], though
the quality of statistical adjustment for potential con-
founders in these studies was variable. Here, we briefly
discuss evidence as to whether and how various PWB di-
mensions are prospectively associated with premature
all-cause mortality, specifically. Searches of
literature
written in English or French within PubMed and Psy-
cInfo databases targeted individual prospective and lon-
gitudinal studies evaluating the role of at least one PWB
dimension with mortality risk. Additional studies were
obtained through bibliographies of eligible articles.
Rigorous individual studies included in this narrative re-
view all adjusted for baseline sociodemographics (e.g.,
age, sex, education), medical status (e.g., blood pressure,
body mass index, chronic conditions), and health behav-
iors (e.g., smoking, physical activity). Some studies fur-
ther adjusted for psychological distress, to determine
PWB’s role on mortality beyond anxiety and depression
symptoms, and for self-rated health.

Purpose in life
Experiencing a sense of purpose and direction in one’s life
has been consistently associated with reduced mortality.
For instance, among 1236 older U.S. adults (mean age =

78 years), every standard deviation (SD) increase in life
purpose was associated with 40% decreased hazard of 5-
year mortality (hazard ratio, HR = 0.60; 95% confidence
interval, CI = 0.42–0.87) [37]. In the Women’s Health Ini-
tiative cohort, after additional statistical control for psy-
chological distress in multivariable models, greater life
purpose was associated with lower likelihood of death over
a 2-year period in 7675 older U.S. women [38]. Meta-
analyses suggested similar effects (higher versus lower
purpose in life; rate ratio, RR = 0.83, CI = 0.75–0.91) [35].
Some research has examined the role of meaning in life
but the results are less convincing than those assessing
purpose. A study of 1361 older U.S. adults (mean age = 79
years) over 5 years found no relationship of meaning in
life with overall mortality (OR = 0.97; CI = 0.93–1.01) in
multivariable models further adjusting for self-rated health
[39]. These results raise the question of whether “mean-
ing” and “purpose,” often used interchangeably, might
capture distinct constructs that relate differently to mor-
tality [40].

Personal growth
To our knowledge, personal growth –that is whether in-
dividuals seek to realize their full potential and recognize
that the self is constantly developing– has been explored
in relation to mortality in only a handful of studies. Not-
ably, in the Women’s Health Initiative investigation de-
scribed above, personal growth levels were associated
with lower 2-year mortality rates, both continuously (per
1-unit increase: HR = 0.95; CI = 0.93–0.98) and categor-
ically (lower versus higher [reference group] quartile:
OR = 2.10, CI = 1.42–3.08) [38]. This study also evalu-
ated life purpose, with contrasting multivariable-adjusted
estimates suggesting stronger associations with life pur-
pose than personal growth (ORs = 3.55 versus 2.10) on
mortality.

Mastery
Mastery –whether individuals effectively manage their en-
vironments or perceive life as being under their control–
has also been well-studied in relation to mortality. An
investigation following 2829 Dutch adults (ages 55–85)
for up to 3 years found that a 1-unit rise was associated
with lower mortality odds (OR = 0.94, CI = 0.89–0.99),
even after extensive adjustment of covariates including
self-rated health, social support, self-efficacy, and self-
esteem [41]. Likewise, among English adults from the
EPIC-Norfolk Study (N = 20,495; ages 41–80), every 1-SD
increase in mastery was associated with a lower rate of
death (RR = 0.82, CI = 0.76–0.89) over 5 years,
further
controlling for psychological distress [42]. Similar results
were obtained in U.S. samples too [43].

Autonomy
Although research is sparse, available evidence suggests
mortality risk is not strongly associated with autonomy,
characterized as the extent to which individuals act inde-
pendently without concern for external pressures. In a
study of 9420 midlife British adults (mean age = 58 years)
over a 5-year period, autonomy scores were unrelated to
the hazard of death in multivariable models also control-
ling for self-rated health and psychological distress (per
1-unit increase: HR = 1.02; CI = 0.96–1.09) [44].

Ikigai
This Japanese term translates into the happiness, worth,
and benefit of being alive. It captures not only eudaimonic
well-being (e.g., life purpose) but also hedonic well-being
(e.g., pleasure), though usually assessed with only one item.
Using data from the nationwide Japan Collaborative Cohort
Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (N = 73,272; ages
40–79), adults with higher (versus lower) levels of ikigai had
a reduced hazard of mortality over 5 years (HRmen = 0.80;
CI = 0.72–0.89; HRwomen = 0.80; CI = 0.69–0.92) [45]. In
another Japanese cohort (N = 43,391; ages 40–79), lower
and moderate ikigai levels (versus higher) were related to an
increased 7-year hazard of death (HRmoderate = 1.1; CI =
1.0–1.2; HRlower = 1.5; CI = 1.3–1.7), with further adjust-
ment for self-rated health not altering these results [46].

Positive affect
joyful, cheerful, excited and proud are
Feeling happy,
often included in the construct of positive affect. Data
from the German Aging Survey (N = 3124; ages 40–85)
showed that every unit increase in positive affect was
associated with a lower 14-year mortality risk, after
adjusting for sociodemographics, medical status, psycho-
logical distress, and also life satisfaction (HR = 0.81,
CI = 0.70–0.93), though further controlling for self-rated
health and physical activity attenuated the association
(HR = 0.88, CI = 0.76–1.02) [47]. Even if happiness is a
pleasurable feeling that is sometimes included in positive
affect, it has also been studied on its own in prior PWB-
mortality research. In a subset of the Million Women
Study (N = 719,617; ages 53–72), English women who
said they were “unhappy” or “usually happy” on a 1-item
measure did not differ in mortality risk in 10-year
follow-up compared to those who said they were “happy
most of the time” (RR = 0.98, CI = 0.94–1.01; RR = 0.99,
CI = 0.96–1.01, respectively) [48]. While this study has
drawn media attention because of its large sample size
and control for multiple covariates, its conclusions based
on the use of a single happiness item have also has gen-
erated some controversy. Likewise, another study of
older adults found no association between happiness
assessed with 2 items and mortality [49]. These results
the comprehensive experience of
may suggest

that

various types of positive affect, rather than the sole ex-
perience of feeling happy as captured by single items, is
what matters in terms of longevity.

Life satisfaction
Life satisfaction can be measured either globally, cap-
turing the extent to which individuals judge their life
as a whole to be satisfactory, or specifically by life do-
mains (e.g., work,
family). A Canadian population-
based study (N = 73,904; ages 18 to > 80) revealed that
“very dissatisfied” (versus “very satisfied or satisfied”)
individuals had an increased mortality risk (HR = 1.70,
CI = 1.16–2.51), after controlling for numerous rele-
vant covariates [50]. In the German Aging Survey de-
scribed above, mortality risk was reduced for each unit
increase in life satisfaction after adjusting for sociode-
mographics, medical status, psychological distress and
also positive affect (HR = 0.89, CI = 0.79–1.00), but be-
came unrelated after additional controlling for self-
rated health and physical activity [47]. Although the
estimate appears stronger with positive affect than life
satisfaction in this study, even after including both in
statistical models,
these dimensions were assessed
with distinct scales and scores were not standardized,
which precludes formal comparison.

Sense of coherence
One of the most rigorous early studies evaluating sense of
coherence’s role in mortality risk has been conducted in
the EPIC-Norfolk Study data (N = 16,668; ages 41–80)
[51]. Sense of coherence was captured by the sum of 3
items measuring, respectively, the level of manageability,
comprehensibility, and meaningfulness in one’s life. Adults
with higher (versus lower) sense of coherence had a re-
duced risk of 6-year mortality (RR = 0.76, CI = 0.64–0.90),
after statistical control for multiple covariates including
psychological distress. These results have been replicated
in a recent study of 585 men who were followed for 22
years and completed a more comprehensive assessment of
the three constructs above [52]. Yet, it remains unclear
whether any protective effects on mortality risk should in-
stead be attributed to other PWB constructs captured by
this scale. Notably, the meaningfulness item (“Do you usu-
ally feel that your daily life is a source of personal satisfac-
tion?”) might relate to lower mortality risk because it
captures, in fact, life satisfaction.

Optimism
Multiple investigations indicate that dispositional opti-
mism—a person’s general expectation that the future will
turn out well or that good things will happen in the future—
is associated with lower mortality rates. The Women’s
Health Initiative (N = 97,253; ages 50–79) showed that
higher versus lower quartiles of optimism were related to a

Trudel-Fitzgerald et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1712 

Page 5 of 11

reduced hazard of mortality over 8 years (HR = 0.86, CI =
0.79–0.93), after adding psychological distress to multivari-
able models [53]. Analyses conducted in another cohort of
midlife U.S. women, the Nurses’ Health Study, replicated
these results using the same research design [54]. Addition-
ally, a Netherlands-based study among men and women
ages 65–85 (N = 941) found a similar pattern over a 9-year
period (HRhigher versus lower quartiles = 0.71; CI = 0.52–0.97), al-
though results were not adjusted for psychological distress
[55]. Altogether, these estimates are comparable to those re-
ported by a recent meta-analysis (higher versus lower opti-
mism; RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80–0.92) [36].

Overall psychological well-being
Other authors have considered global measures of
in a subset of
psychological well-being. For instance,
the Midlife in the United States Study (N = 3032; ages
25–74), scores on items assessing positive affect,
life
satisfaction, eudaimonic well-being and social well-
being were combined to capture positive mental
health—also labeled flourishing by the authors [56].
Multivariable findings
lower versus
higher flourishing levels were related to greater odds
of 10-year mortality (OR = 1.62; CI = 1.00–2.62). While
combining various components of PWB may form a

indicated that

Summary
Overall, existing literature indicates that several PWB di-
mensions are associated with a reduced risk of prema-
ture all-cause mortality among the general population,
with small to medium effects. These relationships were
observed in studies with large sample sizes and over
short to long follow-up periods. Associations were ro-
bust to adjustment for numerous covariates, including
potential mechanisms that could explain associations
(e.g., health behaviors); for some dimensions, associa-
tions were obtained despite the use of distinct PWB
measures (e.g., optimism, sense of coherence). Among
the dimensions reviewed, purpose in life, optimism, and
ikigai, had the strongest evidence, followed by life satis-
faction, positive affect, mastery, and sense of coherence.
Available results with happiness, personal growth, and
autonomy suggested no effect or were too limited to
draw firm conclusions. Other PWB dimensions, includ-
ing self-acceptance and emotional vitality, may have
been investigated with all-cause mortality risk using pro-
spective research designs, but studies using rigorous
control for traditional medical and behavioral risk fac-
tors are scarce.

All studies reported above carefully controlled for
sociodemographics, medical status, and health behaviors,
and even after further adjustment for psychological dis-
tress, associations were generally evident, which further
supports PWB as distinct from the absence of psycho-
logical distress. When more than one PWB dimension
was investigated, however, very few authors evaluated
their independent roles by including dimensions simul-
taneously in the models [47]. Thus, while these PWB
factors appear conceptually distinct, it remains uncertain
whether they independently reduce all-cause mortality
and if so, the relative magnitude of their effects. When
adjusting for self-rated health, some of the studies of
certain domains, though not all, indicated null estimates.
Self-rated health usually assesses, via one item, whether
individuals perceive their health as excellent, very good,
good, fair or poor, and is one of the strongest predictors
of future morbidity and mortality risk [58]. However,
controlling for self-rated health may sometimes be an
overadjustment, because this rating is both defined and
influenced by functional health, physical conditions, and
most importantly, psychological distress and well-being
[58]. Nevertheless, those PWB dimensions that are asso-
ciated with lower mortality even after adjustment for
self-rated health arguably manifest even stronger evi-
dence for a causal relationship.

Psychological well-being and other outcomes
Although our narrative review focused on mortality, it is
worth briefly noting that PWB may have important ef-
fects on numerous other outcomes. Observational and
experimental research indicates that greater PWB levels
are related to lower risk of cardiometabolic diseases, in-
fectious illness and physical decline, though results with
cancer are less clear [1, 2, 54]; PWB has also been re-
lated to more favorable health behaviors and healthier
biological processes, which could act as mechanistic
pathways relating PWB to chronic disease and mortality
risk [1, 2, 29, 33]. Observational and experimental re-
search also suggests PWB relates to higher future levels
of employment, income, and work retention, as well as
greater social support later on [59]. Likewise, prospective
observational studies show that low PWB levels, includ-
ing dimensions like self-acceptance, autonomy, life pur-
pose, positive relationships, and mastery, are associated
with greater likelihood of clinical depression 10 years
later, after controlling for baseline traditional risk factors
and psychological distress [60]. PWB was predictive of
post-treatment symptom severity and remission status,
independent of initial symptoms of depression and anx-
iety, in a recent clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness
of cognitive-behavioral
therapy for anxiety disorders
[61]. PWB is not simply the absence of mental illness,
and, in fact, contributes to subsequently preventing its

onset and relapse. Moreover, PWB is desired not pri-
marily because of
its effects on mental and physical
health, but as an end itself [57]. Most people want to be
happy, satisfied with their life, and pursue a life that has
meaning. PWB is thus important in its own right.

and behaviors,

Interventions
Albeit approximately 30% of one’s PWB is explained by
heritable/dispositional factors, it is clear that external life
events and environmental influences can account for a
large proportion of an individual’s PWB. For instance, it
has been well documented that greater levels of PWB
are associated with higher levels of education, income,
occupational status, and social capital [3, 7, 62, 63].
Intentional
self-
regulation and lifestyle habits, are also important deter-
minants of PWB [5, 63]. Positive psychology (PP) thus
appears as a compelling intervention strategy, as it aims
to improve the frequency and intensity of positive emo-
tional experiences,
including optimism, gratitude, pur-
through
pose/satisfaction in life, and positive affect,
intentional actions in the form of targeted, structured
activities [9, 64, 65]. While these interventions aim to
improve PWB within individuals, individuals are not the
sole responsible agent of such changes; in fact, lever-
aging community and institutional resources is also in-
creasingly encouraged to promote all individuals’ PWB
by making strategies accessible to diverse groups of the
population. In this regard, various PP interventions have
been evaluated and have shown to improve mood and
well-being among different populations [7, 9, 10, 65].

At the individual level, PP interventions are typically
assigned, either separately or in combination, on a short-
term regular basis (e.g., weekly)
for participants to
complete on their own, and then, in some cases, reviewed

with a clinical or research professional to further elicit
PWB [66]. Individual, group, and self-help interventions,
including acts of kindness, counting blessings, and mind-
fulness, were first evaluated in non-clinical samples (e.g.,
community, students; examples in Table 1 with complete
references in the Additional file 1) [9, 63, 64].

In an early meta-analysis of 49 randomized or quasi-
experimental studies (N = 4235), such PP interventions im-
proved well-being, with a small but clinically meaningful
mean effect size (r = 0.29, CI = 0.21–0.37) [64]. A more re-
cent meta-analysis of 39 RCTs (N = 6139) [9] showed a
similar effect of PP interventions on PWB (Cohen’s d =
0.20, CI = 0.09–0.30), with strongest effects for strategies
targeting optimism, gratitude, and kindness [67], and with
gains persisting for up to 6 months post-intervention
(d = 0.16, CI = 0.02–0.30). Comparable effects are observed
among clinical populations. A meta-analysis of 30 studies
(N = 1864) in participants with either a psychiatric disorder
(e.g., depression, anxiety) or a somatic condition (e.g., car-
diometabolic disease, cancer) indicated that PP interven-
tions had a small but meaningful effect on PWB (Hedges’
g = 0.24, CI = 0.13–0.35) [65]. Yet, it is still unclear whether
longer-term health outcomes, including disease incidence
and premature mortality, may be altered by improving
PWB through these brief PP interventions, or if longer,
more intensive interventions would be required [2].

Considering PP interventions at the institutional level
is also critical. Because even changes of small magnitude
at the individual level may translate into large changes at
the population level, the potential benefits of such inter-
ventions on mental and physical health, including mor-
tality risk, may be substantial. For instance, recent
research has estimated a 5% decreased risk of stroke for
individuals endorsing higher vs.
lower levels of opti-
mism, via optimism’ role on healthy lifestyle [33]. Such

independently of wages

In 2018, a public health summit of experts in mental
and occupational health urged for building scientific
evidence in the workplace that supports specific inter-
ventions aiming to improve and maintain employees’
health, including PWB [68]. Practices supporting, for
instance, work-life balance and a physically/psycho-
logically safe environment contributed to job satisfac-
tion,
[20, 68]. Because
employees’ general sense of well-being, beyond job
satisfaction, could contribute to productivity and prof-
itability [20, 68], broadly defined well-being interven-
tions are increasingly evaluated in organizational
settings. While the number of workplace-related RCTs
is comparatively fewer, preliminary results are encour-
aging. A recent systematic review of RCTs and quasi-
experimental studies indicated that PP interventions
in the workplace were the only brief interventions to
have a meaningful, albeit small, impact on employees’
mental health and well-being, whereas no evidence
was found for strategies like relaxation and massage
[69]. A subsequent RCT tested a 5-week online PP
intervention adapted for the workplace among U.K.
[10]. Participants
government employees (Table 2)
receiving the intervention (n = 170; vs. wait-list
control group, n = 160) reported enhanced levels of
positive affect and flourishing (p < .05), but not life
satisfaction, post-intervention [10], reinforcing further
empirical attention to PWB facets separately.

Besides the workplace, institution-based RCTs have also
been conducted in schools (examples in Table 2 with
complete references in the Additional file 1). While most
studies have evaluated multicomponent interventions, mak-
ing it difficult to disentangle the contribution of specific
strategies, beneficial effects on PWB and other psychosocial
outcomes were often observed. Other interventions relying
on cognitive-behavioral strategies, like the Penn Resiliency
Program, have been successful in improving psychosocial
outcomes, including PWB, in schools and other settings
(e.g., U.S. Army, see details in [11]).

Policy implications
Over the past decade, governments from a dozen coun-
tries have also initiated regular well-being surveys as a
component of public health data collection. Some coun-
tries evaluate hedonic PWB through a four-to-six do-
main questionnaire. Notably,
in Bhutan, PWB is
evaluated every few years with items like “All things con-
sidered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole
these days?”, along with other complimentary domains
including social support, negative emotional experience,
and spirituality. Likewise, the U.K. national survey in-
cludes a similar life satisfaction question, as well as items
probing meaningful
and positive/negative
activities
affect. Other national surveys use broader, culturally-
relevant indices or objective well-being measures that
capture infrastructure and services, environment and
landscape factors, social relationships and even trust in
government
International
well-being surveys sometimes issue an annual “happiest
country on Earth.” This judgment pleases not only the
popular press, but also national governments that in-
creasingly recognize that well-being measures can be a
crude but reliable indicator of overall citizen satisfaction.
Results from these surveys, after being reported to na-
tional assemblies, may also subsequently spur policy in-
terventions. For example, the U.K.
initiated the 24-h,
free and confidential helpline, “Silver Line”, in 2013 in
response to survey feedback of decreasing social con-
nectedness among the aged [70]. Over 5 years, 2 million
calls were received and over 70% reported that the help-
line not only enhanced their social lives but also their
happiness [70]; the U.K.’s first Minister of Loneliness
was subsequently appointed in 2018.

Besides the importance of systematic monitoring of
well-being indicators at the population level, implement-
ing effective well-being policies is key to having a
broader outreach in addition to individually tailored in-
terventions. Notably, the Health-in-All-Policies (HiAP)
approach, originating in South Australia, Europe, and
Canada, has introduced a strategic way to better tackle
social determinants of health, as documented in the

[71]. This administrative
process, more recently adapted by U.S. state and local
governments, integrates health as a central outcome of
all departments regardless of their functional oversight.
Consequently, all sectors (e.g., employment, parks and
recreation, housing administrations) become responsible
for health-related interventions (e.g., facilitating access
to greenness), rather than relying solely on public health
policies [72]. For instance, better transport opportunities
(e.g., cycling and walking paths) and reducing environ-
mental degradation (e.g., pollution) may be ensured by
leveraging a collaborative workforce as well as cross-
cutting information and evaluation systems [71]. Such
collaborative approaches can in turn enhance a popula-
tion’s physical health more efficiently, via downstream
consequences on common risk factors (e.g., obesity) and
chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular diseases). HiAP
could be improved by further integrating well-being sci-
ence, including brief and relatively low-cost empirically-
based PP interventions, into such municipal- and state-

strategies. Even though effects

observed

In parallel, policy strategies should address “the causes
of the cause,” namely upstream social determinants that
may drive PWB per se. As briefly mentioned previously,
higher levels of education, income, occupational status,
and social capital [3, 7, 62, 63], to name a few, have been
associated with enhanced levels of PWB. Coordinated
government actions, notably via the HiAP approach,
tackle such social determinants. For example, working
towards educational attainment and employment stabil-
ity across various sociodemographic groups would not
only create engaged citizens and promote better physical
health, but also potentially increase their PWB [71].
Additionally, anti-discrimination policies, including the
Equal Employment Opportunity Act, have historically
helped to minimize group-based disparities in the social
determinants of mental and physical health [73]. There-
fore, stronger enforcement of anti-discrimination pol-
icies might be another way to alter downstream PWB.
Efforts to support families and opportunities for com-
munity participation could likely increase levels of PWB
as well [8, 57]. Lastly, because economic motives may
act as a barrier to seeking mental health support, ad-
equate reimbursement of psychotherapy services could
also be implemented to enhance PWB [74].

Existing community initiatives might be disseminated
across the country as well. Among others, the Office of
Civic Wellbeing located in and supported by the city of
Santa Monica, California, has launched the Wellbeing
Project in 2013 [75]. This groundbreaking model for city
governments uses the science of well-being to document

community’s strengths and needs, along with the mul-
tiple determinants involved, to improve collective well-
being. Moving from data to action, the Office has now
various ongoing projects dealing with social determi-
nants of PWB. One of them, in partnership with the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Social Services,
enrolls eligible Santa Monica residents for “CalFresh,” a
public benefit program that supports individuals to meet
their nutritional needs and improve healthy eating [75].

Limitations and future avenues
PWB has promising potential to improve mental and
physical health, derived from epidemiological studies and
clinical trials described above. Although the current re-
view was comprehensive but non-systematic by nature,
some limitations were evident and should guide future re-
search and practice. Firstly, PWB-mortality associations
have been rarely investigated across sociodemographic
groups (i.e., by explicitly evaluating effect modification, be-
yond statistical adjustment), and many interventions have
been restricted to clinical or convenience samples, mostly
in high-income countries, which may not be generalizable
to other populations. Yet, preliminary observational find-
ings from these studies hint at effect modification by sex
[34, 45], race/ethnicity [53], educational attainment [43],
as well as specific causes of death (e.g., cardiovascular ver-
sus cancer) [42, 45, 53]. As for age, insight about the role
of PWB, as experienced during childhood or adolescence,
in health would be informative from a lifecourse perspec-
tive. However, most epidemiological cohorts have not
queried PWB indicators in early life, and studies in youn-
ger individuals do not have the required follow-up to
evaluate PWB’s role in mortality.

With regard to lower-middle-income countries, a
handful of studies have examined the interplay between
mental and physical health. However, to our knowledge
they either have not collected data on PWB indicators
specifically to date (e.g.,
the Kenyan Grandparents
Study) or did not yet investigate PWB’s role in mortality,
most likely because they were initiated recently (e.g., the
Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging, Health and Aging
in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Com-
munity in South Africa). Besides country-level income,
the role of other indicators of socioeconomic status
(SES) in the PWB-mortality relationship specifically is
less known. In fact, although most rigorous studies cited
above have controlled for education level, fewer investi-
gations have adjusted for individual/family income [38,
44, 53], occupation status/types [42, 45, 46, 51, 53, 55],
or area deprivation [48], and did not formally assess ef-
fect modification. Hence, it remains unclear as of now
whether findings obtained from studies assessing the
PWB-mortality association in high-income countries and
adjusting for certain SES indicators may generalize to

Trudel-Fitzgerald et al. BMC Public Health         (2019) 19:1712 

Page 9 of 11

those of lower-middle-income countries and other socio-
economic groups.

Furthermore, rigorous methodologies should be favored
(e.g., lagged analyses to address potential for reverse caus-
ation, repeated PWB measurements to capture changes,
comprehensive set of covariates to account for confound-
ing, simultaneous adjustment for multiple dimensions of
PWB). In addition to improving methodological rigor, sys-
tematically incorporating well-being scales in large na-
tional cohort studies will help solidify the evidence of
PWB’s causal role in health outcomes [8].

rather

Of course, PWB measure selection depends on the con-
text. For instance, for a multi-purpose epidemiological co-
hort study, with limited space on the questionnaires, or
for studies in which PWB is investigated only as an out-
come, a composite PWB measure might be sufficient.
However, to advance science and be more precise, and
consistent with the argument that PWB is a multidimen-
sional
than unidimensional construct detailed
above, dimension-specific measures should be favored. To
date, numerous large-scale studies have administered at
least one PWB measure to their participants
(e.g.,
Women’s Health Initiative cohort, Nurses’ Health Study,
Midlife in the United States Study, Health and Retirement
Study, Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, EPIC-
Norfolk Study, Japan Collaborative Cohort Study). Includ-
ing additional PWB measures in these studies, to permit
comparison across constructs, and expanding PWB as-
sessments to other large national cohorts is warranted.
Consequently, such evidence will guide the development
of more targeted and efficient intervention, as well as pri-
mary/primordial prevention strategies. For instance, PP
interventions implemented earlier in the lifecourse may
have the potential to reduce adverse behaviors and detri-
mental biological processes over time, possibly lowering
likelihood of chronic illness later in life.

Lastly, additional research exploring whether and how
well-being strategies and policies can be implemented in
communities will be needed to achieve a population-
level impact. Notably, health professionals should assess
the barriers and benefits of integrating PWB into stand-
ard clinical practices focused on deficits and disorders.
Leveraging input from local agents who grasp the needs
and characteristics of certain subgroups would facilitate
the crafting and delivery of empirically-based PP inter-
ventions (e.g., teachers in targeted schools of low-SES
neighborhoods). Eventually, public health policy-makers
will have to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
imple-
menting PP interventions in these distinct environments
(e.g., medical settings, schools, neighborhoods) [76].

Conclusions
Existing research to date suggests that many, though not
all, dimensions of psychological well-being (PWB) are

associated with all-cause mortality. Building from the
evidence of associations between PWB and mortality,
this essay then discusses interventions to promote PWB.
Many randomized-controlled trials evaluating positive
psychology interventions at the individual level indicate
small-to-moderate improvements in various PWB di-
mensions; rigorous institution-level
interventions are
comparatively few, but preliminary results suggest bene-
fits as well. These interventions have the potential to be
easily implemented and, in turn, have a broad outreach
to improve population well-being. Existing health pol-
icies geared towards the improvement of population
well-being could also leverage the science of PWB.

While this body of work has been overlooked by part
of the public health community [8, 11], the growing
interest in documenting well-being, in addition to exam-
ining its determinants and consequences at a population
level may provoke a shift in perspective. Over the past
decade, numerous countries have initiated well-being as-
sessment via national surveys, which have led to the im-
institutional policies geared
some
plementation of
towards PWB’s enhancement. However,
there is at
present no attempt at national measurement in the U.S.;
it is perhaps time that this be changed. To cultivate opti-
mal well-being—mental, physical, social, and spiritual—
consideration of a broader set of well-being measures,
rigorous studies, as well as public and private interven-
tions is critically needed.
