Abstract

Background—Responding to one’s own name (RtN) has been reported as atypical in children 
with developmental disorders, yet comparative studies on RtN across syndromes are rare.

Aims—We aim to (a) overview the literature on RtN in different developmental disorders during 
the first 24 months of life, and (b) report comparative data on RtN across syndromes.

Methods and procedures—In Part 1, a literature search, focusing on RtN in children during 
the first 24 months of life with developmental disorders, identified 23 relevant studies. In Part 2, 
RtN was assessed utilizing retrospective video analysis for infants later diagnosed with ASD, RTT, 
or FXS, and typically developing peers.

Outcomes and results—Given a variety of methodologies and instruments applied to assess 
RtN, 21/23 studies identified RtN as atypical in infants with a developmental disorder. We 
observed four different developmental trajectories of RtN in ASD, RTT, PSV, and FXS from 9 to 
24 months of age. Between-group differences became more distinctive with age.

Introduction

Scientists and clinicians have been tirelessly pursuing markers that enable the earlier 
detection of various developmental disorders. To date, a number of developmental disorders 
can be detected intrauterinely or during the neonatal period using effective screening tools. 
In some cases, physical features may raise an early suspicion of a certain disorder while in 
others, particular neuro-functional signs, such as the prominent and unique vocalisations in 
Cri du chat syndrome (chromosome 5p deletion syndrome), may lead to the early 
recognition of a certain condition. Early detection becomes more challenging when 
attempting to identify developmental disorders which manifest later in life, often beyond 
toddlerhood. In recent years, increased efforts have been devoted to study these late-detected 
disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome (RTT), fragile X 
syndrome (FXS), or Angelman syndrome (AS), to name but a few, through retrospective and 
prospective approaches (e.g., Bölte et al., 2016). The establishment of the prospective 
paradigm in studying high-risk sibling cohorts of ASD or attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), for example, has enabled the developmental trajectories of these late 
recognised disorders to be more precisely studied. This has resulted in a better 
understanding of the early phenotypes of such disorders, and has contributed to the 
development of intervention programs aimed at improving the developmental outcomes of 
children, such as the Early Start Denver Model (Dawson, 2008; Dawson et al., 2010; Rogers 
et al., 2012; Sullivan, Stone, & Dawson, 2014). Some disorders, such as FXS, RTT, or AS, 
are however rarely studied using prospective approaches due to their hereditary nature (e.g., 
RTT is mainly caused by de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene; (Neul et al., 2010) and/or 
their rarity: this impacts upon the possibilities of identifying parameters to enable early 
detection.

Early identification of a developmental disorder is a prerequisite for the implementation of 
targeted and timely intervention. The first two years of life (i.e., from birth to 24 months) are 
considered to be the most effective timeframe for intervention as the young brain is highly 
plastic, and can be re-wired to encourage a more preferable developmental trajectory (Chen, 
Cohen, & Hallett, 2002; Cioni, D'Acunto, & Guzzetta, 2011; Dawson, 2008; Dawson et al., 
2012; Hadders-Algra, 2011, 2014). Unfortunately, a number of developmental disorders are 
not commonly diagnosed before preschool age. Some health care professionals have been 
advocating for global genetic screening at birth and in some disorders, whole genome 
sequencing might offer a promising option for earlier detection. With other disorders, 
however, such as ASD or ADHD, the genetic heterogeneity, the genotype-phenotype 
relation, and related epigenetic factors are not yet completely understood. Thus, searching

for neuro-functional markers, especially in the first two years of life where early signs 
emerge and consolidate, still remains indispensable for early identification that will 
subsequently enable early intervention (Marschik et al., 2017).

Notably, developmental disorders of different etiologies share a range of similar 
abnormalities. For example, autistic features are frequently also observed in individuals with 
FXS or RTT, although sometimes transient in nature (Niu et al., 2017). Multiple clinical 
conditions can also co-occur in the same individual, such as FXS with ASD, or ASD with 
ADHD (e.g., Abbeduto, McDuffie, & Thurman, 2014; Craig et al., 2015; Johnson, Gliga, 
Jones, & Charman, 2014. These overlapping characteristics and comorbidities complicate 
the identification of specific disorders. It is still to be examined whether a particular 
behavioural marker is (a) reliably associated with a specific disorder, (b) shared by different 
conditions, or (c) rather associated with a general developmental delay.

One frequently studied early behaviour is the response to one’s own name. Response to 
name (RtN) requires an individual to detect and shift his or her attention to a signal that is 
socially meaningful and salient to the person named (e.g., by turning the head and looking at 
the person who called their name). Previous studies have applied modified head-turn 
preference procedures (Mandel, Jusczyk, & Pisoni, 1995) or near-infrared spectroscopy 
technology (Grossmann, Parise, & Friederici, 2010), and demonstrated that typically 
developing infants from 4.5 to 5 months of age onwards are sensitive to the sound pattern of 
their own name. Compared to another name, hearing their own names, especially when 
spoken by their mother, elicited greater activity in 6-month-old infant's medial prefrontal 
cortex, an area considered important in the process of self-referencing (Imafuku, Hakuno, 
Uchida-Ota, Yamamoto, & Minagawa, 2014). Furthermore, 5-month-old infants attended 
longer to objects presented on a screen after hearing their own name compared to another 
name (Parise, Friederici, & Striano, 2010). These findings suggest that by 6 months of age 
infants are not only sensitive to the sound pattern of their name, but also start to associate 
this signal to other social cues (e.g., the mother’s voice), and use this socially meaningful 
signal to guide their attention to events and objects in the world. It is worthy to note that 
different areas of the brain are triggered in young infants when responding to their name in 
comparison to that seen in adults (Kampe, Frith, & Frith, 2003). This suggests that RtN is a 
developing behaviour in infants who are gradually learning to use a unique social cue (i.e., 
hearing their own name) to selectively orient their attention to meaningful aspects of their 
environment.

Due to the salient socio-communicative nature of RtN, it has been widely studied in 
individuals with socio-communicative deficits, especially among infants later diagnosed 
with ASD. RtN has also been included in several screening tools (e.g., Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule, ADOS: Lord et al., 1989; 2012; Autism Observation Scale for 
Infants, AOSI: Bryson, Zwaigenbaum, McDermott, Rombough, & Brian, 2008). Recently, 
studies on RtN, together with other related social-reciprocal behaviors have been extended to 
individuals later diagnosed with RTT or FXS. In this article, we provide (a) an overview of 
studies that have investigated RtN in individuals with developmental disabilities; (b) new 
empirical data on RtN from children with ASD or FXS, adding a cross syndrome 
comparison of ASD, FXS, RTT, and the preserved speech variant of RTT (PSV); and (c) we

discuss perspectives of future research aiming at earlier diagnosis and the potential of RtN as 
one early marker for identifying developmental disorders.

Methods

Part 1: Overview of previous research

Search procedures—Two independent literature searches were conducted by two authors 
(LR, LM) and checked for completeness by a third author (KDB) within the electronic 
databases PubMed, ERIC, ProQuest, and Google Scholar in early October 2017 using the 
search terms: [react* to name/response to name/orient* to name] AND 
[neurodevelopmental/developmental disorders], [developmental disabilities], [autis*], 
[Angelman syndrome], [AD(H)D], [Asperger], [Canavan disease], [Coffin-Lowry 
syndrome], [developmental dyslexia], [fragile X syndrome], [monosomy 22q13], [Mowat-
Wilson syndrome], [Noonan syndrome], [pervasive developmental disorders, not otherwise 
specified; PDD-NOS], [Pitt-Hopkins syndrome], [Prader-Willi syndrome], [Rett syndrome], 
[Smith-Magenis syndrome], [specific language impairment/communication disorder], 
[specific learning disorder], [Tourette syndrome], [Tuberous sclerosis]. The search resulted 
in 48 potential papers that were screened against the pre-determined inclusion criteria (see 
below). Nineteen papers were selected and then used for an ancestry search whereby authors 
of the included papers were searched in PubMed and Google Scholar search engines to 
locate any additional papers. Four further papers were then included leading to a final 
sample of 23 studies for analysis (Table 1).

Inclusion criteria—The pre-determined inclusion criteria were the following: (a) 
participants included in the study must have been at risk of, or have later received a 
diagnosis of a developmental disorder; (b) participants must have received an RtN 
assessment during the first 24 months of life; (c) analysis of RtN must have been one of the 
objectives of the study and data related to RtN must have been explicitly reported; and (d) 
studies must have been written in English and published in peer reviewed journals.

Part 2: Cross syndrome comparison

Within the framework of this article we compared data on RtN of individuals later diagnosed 
with ASD, FXS, RTT or PSV. The RTT data has been previously reported by our research 
group (Townend et al., 2015). Here we added retrospective video analyses of infants later 
diagnosed with ASD or FXS; for the age group 9 to 12 months we additionally report on 
data of a typically developing (TD) group. The identical RVA procedure was employed as 
reported in our previous study on RTT (Townend et al., 2015). Response rate is calculated by 
“response observed” divided by “response expected” (Table 2). An “opportunity” refers to 
one name prompt or more quickly succeeding prompts in the same situation. If within the 
same opportunity, a reaction was observed after the third name prompt or later, this was 
counted as “no response”.

Video recordings of the first 24 months of life of 33 individuals with a total running time of 
1279 minutes were analysed. The footage was provided by parents who were not aware of 
their infants’ condition at the time of recording and included: 328 minutes of 13 individuals

with ASD (13 male), 664 minutes of 13 individuals with FXS (10 male), and 287 minutes 
recordings of 7 TD children (5 male). The previously published data on RTT comprised 10 
female individuals with typical RTT and 5 with the preserved speech variant of RTT (PSV; 
Townend et al., 2015). All data were extracted from our real-world database GUARDIAN 
[Graz University Audiovisual Research Database for the Interdisciplinary Analysis of 
Neurodevelopment] that was built up over 15 years and comprises home video material with 
a total running time of more than a year (Pokorny et al., 2016). All children with FXS or 
RTT included in GUARDIAN had a clinical diagnosis and genetic confirmation of 
respective FMR1 or MECP2 mutation. Clinical diagnosis were in accordance with specific 
consensus criteria (e.g., Neul et al. 2010 for RTT) or widely accepted diagnostic instruments 
for ASD (e.g., ADOS), depending on the different diagnostic procedures of the referring 
centers. All available individuals with FXS, RTT, or ASD who had adequate video data of 
the first 24 months of life from the database have been included in the current study. The 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical University of Graz, 
Austria (24-226 ex 11/12) and the parents gave their informed written consent to participate 
in the study and to the potential publication of the results.

Results

Part 1: Overview of previous research

Participant Characteristics—Of the 23 studies included in this overview (highlighted 
with * in the Reference section), 20 focused on children with ASD, one focused on 
individuals with RTT (Townend et al., 2015), and one on individuals with FXS (Baranek et 
al., 2005). The remaining study reported on three infants who demonstrated a lack of social 
engagement, suggestive of autism spectrum disorder (Koegel, Singh, Koegel, Hollingsworth, 
& Bradshaw, 2014). Within the 20 ASD studies, 6 studies analysed infants at high-risk 
(HRASD) for ASD, i.e. siblings of children with ASD (Brian et al., 2008; Gammer et al., 
2015; Miller et al., 2017; Nadig et al., 2007; Yirmiya et al., 2006; Zwaigenbaum et al., 
2005); 8 studies compared children with ASD and intellectual disability (termed mental 
retardation, MR, in the studies of Muratori, Apicella, Muratori, & Maestro, 2011; Osterling, 
Dawson, & Munson, 2002; or developmental disabilities, DD, in Baranek, 1999; Clifford, 
Young, & Williamson, 2007; Trillingsgaard, Sørensen, Němec, & Jørgensen, 2005; Veness 
et al., 2012; Ventola et al., 2007; Wetherby et al., 2004); 3 studies included children with 
specific language impairment, developmental language delay, or language delay 
(SLI/DLD/LD: Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Veness et al., 2012; Ventola et al., 2007); 2 studies 
reported on early and late onset ASD groups (ASD-EO/ASD-LO: Osterling et al., 2002; 
Werner, Dawson, Osterling, & Dinno, 2000); and 1 study specifically reported on children 
with pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS: Chawarska, 
Klin, Paul, & Volkmar, 2007).

Of the 23 studies included in this overview, 3 did not report on the participants’ gender 
(Table 1; Trillingsgaard et al., 2005; Werner et al., 2000; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). Six 
studies did not include a control group (Chawarska et al., 2007; Gomez & Baird, 2005; 
Koegel et al., 2014; Townend et al., 2015; Trillingsgaard et al., 2005; Ventola et al., 2007), 
and one study was population-based (Stenberg et al., 2014). Sixteen studies included a

comparison group that either consisted of TD children or children with a low risk for 
receiving an ASD diagnosis (LR).

Study Design—The first assessment of RtN was conducted during the first year of life in 
15 studies; the remaining 8 studies assessed RtN during the second year of life (Table 1). 
Thirteen studies conducted RtN assessments only once, six of them during the first year of 
life (Baranek, 1999; Baranek et al., 2005; Osterling & Dawson, 1994; Osterling et al., 2002; 
Werner et al., 2000; Yirmiya et al., 2006), the others during the second year of life (Brian et 
al., 2008; Clifford et al., 2007; Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Gomez & Baird, 2005; Stenberg et 
al., 2014; Ventola et al., 2007; Wetherby et al., 2004). The other 10 studies assessed RtN at 
multiple age points (Table 1).

RtN Assessment—Except for three studies mainly dealing with RtN (Miller et al., 2017; 
Nadig et al., 2007; Townend et al., 2015), all other articles in this overview assessed multiple 
early behaviours, with RtN being one of them. Various instruments and approaches to 
evaluate RtN were applied (Table 1). In five of the 11 prospective studies, the following 
standardized developmental assessments were administered: the ADOS (Brian et al., 2008), 
the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G, Chawarska et al., 2007), 
the AOSI (Brian et al., 2008; Gammer et al., 2015; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005), and the 
Systematic Observation of Red Flags (SORF, Wetherby et al., 2004; for Key please see 
Table 1). In four of the prospective studies, direct assessments were implemented where a 
researcher (Miller et al., 2017; Nadig et al., 2007; Wetherby et al., 2004) or the mother of the 
infant (Yirmiya et al., 2006) was instructed to elicit RtN. In addition to a direct observation 
in a semi-structured interactive play session, Trillingsgaard and colleagues (2005) also used 
a parental questionnaire to assess RtN retrospectively. Parental questionnaires were also 
used by four other research groups who calculated rate of RtN based on the relevant item 
within the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT, Stenberg et al., 2014; 
Ventola et al., 2007), the Temperament and Atypical Behavior Scale (TABS, Gomez & 
Baird, 2005), or the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scale Developmental Profile 
Infant-Toddler Checklist (CSBS-ITC, Veness et al., 2012; for Key please see Table 1). Eight 
of the 23 studies adopted retrospective video analysis (RVA) to assess RtN (Baranek, 1999; 
Baranek et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2007; Muratori et al., 2011; Osterling & Dawson, 1994; 
Osterling et al., 2002; Townend et al., 2015; Werner et al., 2000). The intervention study by 
Koegel and colleagues (2014) assessed RtN response rates during a baseline observation, 
intervention, and follow-up.

Interrater reliability—In the five studies that used parental questionnaires, interrater 
reliability could not be calculated (Gomez & Baird, 2005; Stenberg et al., 2014; 
Trillingsgaard et al., 2005; Veness et al., 2012; Ventola et al., 2007). A further five studies 
did not report on interrater reliability (Brian et al., 2008; Chawarska et al., 2007; Gammer et 
al., 2015; Miller et al., 2017; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). Of the remaining 13 studies, 6 
reported intra-class coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.66 to 1.00 (Baranek, 1999; Baranek 
et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2007; Nadig et al., 2007; Osterling et al., 2002; Werner et al., 
2000), 5 reported Kappa values ranging from 0.67 to 1.00 (Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Muratori 
et al., 2011; Osterling & Dawson, 1994; Wetherby et al., 2004; Yirmiya et al., 2006), and a

further 2 reported the percentage of agreement ranging from 50 to 100% (Koegel et al., 
2014; Townend et al., 2015).

Main findings on RtN—Of the included studies in this overview, RtN was identified as 
atypical (i.e., significantly different from that observed in the TD or LR groups, or the score 
on the related item of the standardised assessment was not within normal range) for children 
with developmental disorders in 21 studies, of which 19 focused on children with ASD. This 
result was observed irrespective of the method applied: it was observed in prospective 
studies using standardised assessments and/or direct observations, in studies using parental 
questionnaires, and in RVA (Table 1). The majority of the studies comparing RtN in 
individuals with ASD and their TD peers reported a lower rate of RtN in ASD (Clifford et 
al., 2007; Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Muratori et al., 2011; Osterling & Dawson, 1994; 
Osterling et al., 2002; Stenberg et al., 2014; Werner et al., 2000; Wetherby et al., 2004). 
Similar results were found when high-risk infants for ASD were compared with low-risk 
infants (Miller et al., 2017; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). In the intervention study by Koegel 
and colleagues (2014), low rates of RtN were reported during baseline in all three infants 
entering the study at ages 4 to 9 months. Following 10 to 17 weeks of a parent-led play 
based intervention, RtN rates improved and these results maintained 2 to 6 months post 
intervention (Koegel et al., 2014).

The results from Veness and colleagues (2012) were interesting in that RtN was assessed by 
an item on the caregiver checklist CSBS-ITC in four targeted groups (i.e., ASD, SLI, DD, 
and TD) at 8, 12, and 24 months of age. The caregivers were asked whether RtN is present at 
the time of assessment, offered with three options: “not yet”, “sometimes”, or “often”. 
Although a significant overall group difference of data analysis at 24 months was revealed, 
further post hoc test found no significant difference between any two groups. In their RVA 
study comparing individuals with ASD, intellectual disability, and TD, Muratori and 
colleagues (2011) found a significant difference in RtN between ASD and TD at the ages 7 
to 12 months, but not at a younger or older age. In a prospective study, Nadig and colleagues 
(2007) reported no significant difference between HRASD and LR infants in RtN at 6 
months, yet a significantly lower RtN rate of the HRASD infants at 12 months. Interestingly, 
in Yirmiya and colleagues (2006), RtN was reported as significantly better in the ASD group 
compared to the TD group at 4 months of age.

Comparing RtN between infants later diagnosed with ASD and those with developmental 
delay or intellectual disability, the results were mixed and appeared to have depended on the 
methodology applied. Studies applying direct behavioural coding (Trillingsgaard et al., 
2005; Wetherby et al., 2004), the M-CHAT (Ventola et al., 2007), or RVA (Clifford et al., 
2007), for example, revealed atypical RtN in individuals with ASD, whereas the use of 
retrospective questionnaire did not (Trillingsgaard et al., 2005). Additionally, applying 
different statistical procedures, Muratori and colleagues (2011) demonstrated different 
findings related to RtN between individuals with ASD and intellectual disability. Differences 
in RtN were also related to the assessments used. For example, in the study by Brian et al. 
(2008), the ADOS indicated differences within the HRASD group between individuals who 
later received an ASD diagnosis and who did not. The AOSI, however, failed to identify

differences between the two groups. Nonetheless, both ADOS and AOSI differentiated 
HRASD infants with an ASD diagnosis from the low risk controls in RtN.

In the only study on RTT included in this overview, Townend and colleagues (2015) 
evaluated RtN in individuals with typical RTT and the preserved speech variant (PSV) of 
RTT. Ten individuals with typical RTT responded more often to their name calling than five 
individuals with PSV from 5 to 8 months of age. Reversely, from 9 to 24 months, individuals 
with PSV demonstrated higher RtN rates compared to individuals with typical RTT. 
Unfortunately, this study is limited as it did not include a control group. In the only study 
focusing on individuals with FXS, replicating a previous procedure (Baranek, 1999), 
Baranek and colleagues (2005) detected a significant difference among the groups (i.e., 
FXS, ASD, DD, and TD) in RtN assessed by the number of adult name prompts. Specific 
statistical comparison between any two groups was however, not reported.

Part 2: Cross-syndrome comparison: an exploratory study

Our new RtN data from the video analyses of young children later diagnosed with RTT, 
PSV, FXS, ASD, in comparison to the seven TD children, are presented in Table 2. We did 
not have sufficient video footage for the youngest age period (5 to 8 months) of children 
later diagnosed with FXS or ASD for a comparison, thus the cross-syndrome comparison 
focused on the age periods of 9 to 12, 13 to 18, and 19 to 24 months. From the TD group, 
sufficient data were available only for 9 to 12 months range. Due to small sample sizes, we 
decided to report only descriptive data in Table 2 and Figure 1.

Figure 1 shows changes in the RtN rate for each group across the three age periods. From 9 
to 12 months of age, differences in RtN appeared to be substantial between TD infants and 
all other conditions in our sample (i.e., RTT, PSV, FXS, and ASD). At all age periods, 
individuals with RTT demonstrated the lowest rate of RtN amongst all of the groups. At 9 to 
12 months, the RtN rate appeared to be similar among ASD, FXS, and PSV, yet differences 
became evident and more distinctive with age, with ASD showing lower rates of RtN than 
FXS and PSV, but higher than RTT. Three different developmental profiles appeared: (a) 
increasing RtN rate with age for children with FXS; (b) continuously declining RtN rate for 
children with RTT; and (c) a slightly increasing rate of RtN, followed by RtN rate 
deterioration for children with PSV or ASD, with the ASD group demonstrating a dramatic 
reduction from the first to the second half of the second year (Figure 1).

Discussion

In research and clinical practice, RtN is considered a critical behaviour related to infants’ 
socio-communicative development. Understanding this easy-to-assess and early emerging 
function may contribute to our knowledge of impaired social development in late infancy 
and toddlerhood, and to the earlier recognition of certain developmental disorders. In the 
current article we (a) present an overview of the literature concerning RtN in infants with 
various developmental disabilities and (b) provide a cross-syndrome comparison of infants 
with ASD, FXS, RTT, PSV, and their TD peers.

In Part 1, we identified 23 studies, which utilised a variety of methodologies and instruments 
to analyse RtN during the first 24 months of life (Table 1). Due to the saliency of RtN in 
early socio-communicative development, it is not surprising that most articles involved in 
this overview focused on individuals with ASD. Only few studies analysed RtN in other 
developmental disabilities (e.g., Baranek et al., 2005; Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Townend et al., 
2015). Because of the divergence of the approaches and assessments for evaluating RtN, 
findings from the previous studies are not always comparable and sometimes inconsistent 
(e.g., Brian et al., 2008; Trillingsgaard et al., 2005). In our current study (Part 2), we 
assessed RtN across four conditions (ASD, FXS, RTT, and PSV) during the first 24 months 
of life by applying the same RVA procedure, providing cross-syndrome data on a 
comparable basis. This explorative data, given limited sample sizes, revealed four clearly 
different trajectories in RtN for the four developmental disorders assessed (Figure 1). 
Twenty-one of the 23 studies overviewed in Part 1 reported RtN deficits from 9 months 
onwards. Our own study confirmed this finding that all infants later diagnosed with a 
developmental disorder presented a lower RtN rate in contrast to their typical developing 
peers by the end of the first year.

Atypical RtN was not uniquely associated with ASD. Numerous studies revealed that 
children with a later diagnosis of ASD do respond to their names, although usually at a 
diminished rate, and their TD peers as well as infants with other developmental disorders do 
fail on RtN tasks from time to time (e.g., Baranek et al., 2005; Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Miller 
et al., 2017; Nadig et al., 2007; Townend et al., 2015). The results of the present RVA study 
(Part 2) appear to be consistent with the existing literature (e.g., Baranek et al., 2005; Wolff 
et al., 2012) in that individuals with FXS presented less impaired RtN than individuals with 
ASD; and infants with RTT, possibly due to the severe phenotype and the period of 
regression, revealed an even lower rate of RtN than those with ASD from 9 to 24 months. 
Therefore, atypical RtN, especially if consistently observed during the first 24 months of 
life, may be a potential indicator of a general disintegrative development (e.g., Miller et al., 
2017; Nadig et al., 2007). More importantly, the likelihood of failing RtN and the 
developmental profiles of this behaviour appear to be divergent across different 
developmental disorders (e.g., Baranek et al., 2005; Gabrielsen et al., 2015; Townend et al., 
2015), suggesting that RtN may have the potential as one marker in the early identification 
of different conditions.

Atypical RtN is but one neurobehavioral marker among others in deviant early development, 
which, on its own, has limited potential to specifically detect a certain disorder. Together 
with additional age-specific atypicalities, it may well alert clinicians to initiate a diagnostic 
process. The consistent failure to respond to one's name appears to coincide with other social 
deficits such as lack of responding to and initiating joint attention, reciprocal positive affect, 
and engagement with toy play and positive adult led stimulation (Goin & Myers, 2004; 
Koegel et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2017; Oner, Oner, & Munir, 2014; Osterling & Dawson, 
1994; Townend et al., 2015; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). In light of a bootstrapping 
perspective, consistent failures on a range of basic social skills appears to have significant 
negative implications for later communication and social development (Dawson, 2008; 
Miller et al., 2017; Oner, Oner, & Munir, 2014;). Given the fact that RtN is part of 
standardized assessments for ASD, e.g. in the ADOS, as one of many items on social

interaction, it may also have the potential to play a part in a heuristic model to detect 
developmental disorders commonly diagnosed beyond infancy (e.g. the Fingerprint-Model 
as proposed by Marschik et al., 2017). We assume that a particular combination of certain 
age-specific neurofunctional parameters (functions and dysfunctions defined by different 
levels of atypicality) constitute attribute-constellations, or fingerprints, that point to certain 
disorders. RtN must be seen in the complexity of the developing nervous system and its 
functions and not as a single parameter to detect developmental disorders.

Apart from involving RtN in more systematic and comprehensive assessments for early 
identification of developmental disabilities, one must consider its age-related significance. 
For example, Yirmiya and colleagues (2006) assessed RtN in 4-month-old infants and found 
an unexpected better RtN score in HRASD than in LR controls, although this score was not 
related to the developmental assessments at 14 months of age. Other studies (e.g., Miller et 
al., 2017; Muratori et al., 2011; Nadig et al., 2007) reported comparable RtN rates of 
children with a later ASD diagnosis and the TD controls at 6 months of age. Our current 
data also presented that differences in RtN between groups (i.e., ASD, FXS, PSV, and RTT) 
were less distinctive at 9 to 12 months, but became more evident with increasing age (Figure 
1). These results confirm RtN to be an emerging behaviour during the first year of life. RtN 
assessed before the end of the first year might not serve as a reliable predictor for later 
development. In particular, the onset of ASD has been reported as gradual with a relatively 
broad window of symptom consolidation between 12 and 36 months of age (Jones, Gliga, 
Bedford, Charman, & Johnson, 2014; Mitchell, Cardy, & Zwaigenbaum, 2011; Ozonoff et 
al., 2010). Our findings coincide with the literature in that deficits in RtN became more 
obvious in individuals with ASD from 13 - 18 months to 19 - 24 months (Figure 1).

In our overview of research on RtN, we focused on data collections of the first 24 months of 
life; perhaps a more inclusive age period would capture the long term implications of 
atypicalities in RtN. In our empirical study, we applied RVA to assess RtN across conditions. 
Given the merits and restrictions of this methodology, which have been intensively discussed 
in the past, video examination has proven to be a valuable tool for observing infants with 
developmental disorders prior to their diagnosis (e.g., Goin & Myers, 2004; Marschik & 
Einspieler, 2011; Ozonoff et al., 2011; Palomo, Belinchón, & Ozonoff, 2006; Zwaigenbaum, 
Bryson, & Garon, 2013). Utilizing this method, we were able to address the issue of the 
scarcity of comparative studies in RtN in individuals with developmental disorders other 
than ASD. Due to the small sample size and the inherent limits of the methodology applied, 
our findings need to be interpreted with caution and replications with greater sample sizes 
are warranted. Still, we provide novel information for unravelling an essential early 
behaviour of social development through a cross-syndrome comparison.

Considering the promising results of Koegel and colleagues (2014) and existing early 
intervention programs (e.g., Dawson et al., 2010), it seems worthwhile to extend and 
investigate future intervention studies that target RtN in addition to other critical social 
interactive behaviours to determine the best possible approaches aiming at more preferable 
outcomes of developmental disabilities. Research on long term implications of RtN 
discrepancies for children with developmental disorders to determine the stability and 
reliability of this behavioural marker in the diagnostic process is warranted. In-depth

analyses during the first 24 months of life might reveal temporal and/or qualitative 
differences in the development of RtN and may shed light on the salience of this behaviour 
in developmental disorders that share similar phenotypical characteristics, e.g. autistic traits 
as seen in RTT and FXS. RtN, in connection with other developmental variables, may be a 
potential parameter of interest in our recently proposed ‘Fingerprint-model’ characterising 
neurofunctional biomarkers in association with specific disorders over time and contribute to 
their early identification (Marschik et al., 2017).

Conclusion

A significant finding that emerges from the literature is that consistently failing RtN appears 
to be a predictor of atypical development. RtN is easy to assess and may be one of the 
behavioural markers to be involved in the symptom-constellation based fingerprint approach. 
It may have the potential to contribute to the early differentiation of typical and atypical 
development in young children. Further assessment of RtN in TD children and individuals 
with various developmental disorders might shed more light on the importance of RtN as a 
differentiating behavioural marker of developmental and rare genetic disorders that manifest 
in more subtle ways.

What this paper adds?

This paper adds an overview which evaluates the presence of response to name (RtN) 
during the first 24 months of life, and the association of RtN with various developmental 
disorders. It also adds a cross-syndrome comparison of early RtN in infants who were 
later diagnosed with ASD, RTT, PSV, or FXS. It was discussed to which extent deficits in 
RtN might be an early marker for specific disorders. The findings highlighted the 
potential value of including RtN assessment in our recently proposed ‘Fingerprint-
Model’ characterising neurofunctional biomarkers in association with specific disorders, 
aimed at their early identification.
