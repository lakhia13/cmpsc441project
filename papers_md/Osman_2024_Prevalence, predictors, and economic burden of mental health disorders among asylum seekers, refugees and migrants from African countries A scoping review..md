Background

Asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African countries may have significant health
needs, resulting in economic implications for receiving countries around the world. The risk
of mental illness is higher in these communities because of factors like violence, deprivation,
and post-immigration challenges.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the literature to determine the prevalence, predic-
tors, and economic impacts of mental health (MH) disorders among asylum seekers,
migrants, and refugees from African countries.

Design and methods

In this scoping review, we followed the guidelines from PRISMA and CoCoPop. A modified
version of the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) was used to assess study
quality for cross-sectional studies, while an appraisal list was used for qualitative studies
based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Inclusion criteria included peer-
reviewed articles published in English, and articles based on official reports from credible
institutions and organizations. Among the exclusion criteria were publications that were not
peer reviewed or had not been sourced by credible sources, publications that did not meet
the study topic or language criteria, mixed populations (including Africans and non-Afri-
cans), and research abstracts, reviews, news articles, commentary on study protocols, case
reports, letters, and guidelines.

Data sources

A systematic search was carried out in Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, APA PsycINFO,
Web of Science and EBSCO, to identify relevant articles that were published between 1 Jan-
uary 2000 and 31 January 2024.

Results

A total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria, including 22 from African countries and three
qualitative studies. In terms of number of countries contributing, Uganda was the largest (n
= 7), followed by Italy (n = 4). The most studied conditions, using multiple diagnostic tools,
were Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, n = 19) and depression (n = 17). These stud-
ies all revealed elevated rates of mental health disorders among these groups, and these
were related to migration, refugee-related factors, and traumatic events. Most of these
groups are dominated by young males. There is, however, a prominent presence of minors
and women who have suffered a variety of forms of violence, in particular sexual violence.
Furthermore, mental illnesses, such as PTSD and depression, are not only persistent, but
can also be transmitted to children. In accordance with our inclusion criteria, our review
found only one study that examined the economic impact of MH disorders in these groups,
leaving a significant knowledge gap. According to this randomized controlled trial, interven-
tion to reduce psychological impairment can help young people stay in school, improve their
quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and earn an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
of $7260 for each QALY gained.

Conclusion

Asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African countries are likely to experience MH
needs, according to this scoping review. As well as posing persistent challenges, these dis-
orders can also be transmissible to offspring. In addition to longitudinal studies of these
groups, economic impact studies of mental illnesses are necessary.

1. Introduction
Human mobility is one of the most significant issues of the 21st century. The number of dis-
placed persons worldwide is estimated to be the highest in history, with tens of millions cross-
ing borders every day and approximately three billion crossings annually [1]. The number of
forced migrants entering industrialized countries at an increasing rate in recent years has
made screening health conditions more challenging [2].

Depending on the context, refugees, migrants, or asylum seekers may have a different
meaning: political, media, security, health, or legal. According to the International Organiza-
tion of Migration (IOM) [3], refugees are threatened because of their race, religion, nationality,
membership in a particular social group, or political beliefs, and their own governments do
not provide them with protection. "Migrants" are people who move across international bor-
ders or within states away from where they live regularly. A migrant may be a student abroad,
a worker overseas, or an individual who comes to the country for economic reasons. Migrants
and refugees differ primarily in how they experience forced migration. Migrants who migrate
for economic, environmental, or family reasons are considered voluntary migrants. Asylum

seekers are individuals seeking international protection. In a country with individualized pro-
cedures, an asylum seeker is someone who has not yet been granted asylum by the country to
which the claim has been submitted. It is important to note that asylum seekers are not all rec-
ognized as refugees, but that all refugees were originally asylum seekers. Detailed explanations
of these terms can be found in the S1 File.

There has been an increase in refugee influxes into and out of African countries, creating
the need for global responses to accommodate these populations. There have been reports of
humanitarian concerns regarding the integration of the millions of people forced into exile by
these flows into the social, economic, and political environments of their host countries. The
result is that Africa continues to produce a disproportionate number of refugees; around 47
percent of the refugees registered with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR) come from the continent [4]. Therefore, it is difficult for host states to achieve a bal-
ance between maintaining control over their borders and protecting refugees.

Furthermore, migrants fleeing persecution of political opponents, human rights violations,

and ethnic cleansing campaigns may have far-reaching effects. The number of refugees in
Africa is quite high; Sudan, Mozambique, and Rwanda have produced more than a million ref-
ugees each [4]. When political turmoil occurs at home, it can have a significant spillover effect
on other states and lead to strong reactions. Due to the lack of borders among refugees and dis-
sidents, internal violence can easily cross national borders [5, 6].

The reactions of host countries to refugees are controversial and poorly understood. It has
been reported that a significant number of refugees generate positive spillovers in host countries
[7, 8]. In countries that have accepted refugees, the creation of new businesses and the replace-
ment of aging populations have led to increases in income and gross domestic product [9].
However, despite these developments, it is very difficult to provide optimum benefits to refugees
and asylum seekers due to resource limitations and the increasing level of global debt [10].

There may be barriers that asylum seekers, migrants, and refugee groups experience in cop-
ing with stress, working productively and fruitfully, and contributing to society. In addition to
economic, sociocultural, and ecological factors, there are many factors and challenges contrib-
uting to poor mental health in these groups. Among them are language barriers, family separa-
tions, loneliness, documentation challenges, housing problems, loss of social standing, job
insecurity, racism, and discrimination. Moreover, refugees who have experienced violent
trauma or severe deprivation may be at greater risk of mental illness. According to a scoping
review of 36 studies conducted in 12 African countries [11], lifetime prevalence of mood disor-
ders ranged from 3.3 to 9.8%, anxiety disorders ranged from 5.7 to 15.8%, substance use disor-
ders ranged from 3.7 to 13.3%, and psychotic disorders ranged from 1.0 to 4.4%. It is common
for immigrants to experience stress as they leave their home country and enter a society that
has different cultural values and social norms.

In terms of mental health (MH), refugees resettled in industrialized countries have encoun-
tered a variety of adverse experiences, including witnessing atrocities, losing family members,
experiencing stressful escape and transit experiences, living in refugee camps, cultural and lin-
guistic barriers, stigma surrounding mental illness, unemployment, financial hardship, and
losing status, culture, and identity. Even so, most asylum-seekers are not screened for mental
health problems during the asylum process [12], which is also true of most newly resettled ref-
ugees [13, 14]. As a result of this, forced migrant populations are known to have high rates of
mental disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress dis-
order (PTSD), which are several times higher than in the host population [15] or non-forced
migrant populations [16]. Based on a large meta-analysis of refugees and other conflict-
affected persons, the adjusted weighted prevalence rates for MDD and PTSD were 30% [17],

suggesting that refugees and asylum seekers are more likely to suffer from these mental disor-
ders [18, 19], with asylum seekers experiencing even higher rates.

There is a critical need to promote mental health among asylum seekers, migrants, and ref-

ugees. While the circumstances and experiences of refugees and asylum seekers may differ,
they all fled their countries of origin due to persecution, conflict, violence, or other dangerous
circumstances [20]. During the resettlement process, migrants often encounter adverse cir-
cumstances and insecurity in their countries of origin, as well as challenges associated with the
migration journey.

In light of this, this scoping review explored the literature to investigate the prevalence, pre-

dictors, and economic impacts of mental health disorders among asylum seekers, migrants,
and refugees from African countries.

2. Methods
The protocol, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria

A study protocol based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analy-
sis Protocols (PRISMA) was drafted for an MSc dissertation project at Liverpool Johns Moore
University (LJMU), UK, and revised by the faculty board. As of now, the protocol cannot be
accessed by the public, but it can be shared upon request.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established using the Context-Context-Population
Framework (CoCoPop) in order to define prevalence data in accordance with the research
question [21].

Articles considered in this review met the following inclusion criteria: (a) investigated the

prevalence, predictors, and economic cost of mental illness and/or psychiatric disorders
among refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers from African countries (definitions of all terms
can be found in the S1 File) (b) were published in the English language, (c) were peer-reviewed
and based on official reports from credible institutions and organizations and were published
between 1 January 2000 and 31 January 2024.

The exclusion criteria included the lack of peer review or not coming from credible official

sources and the inclusion criteria not meeting the study topic and language (English). The
review excluded publications in which mixed populations were involved (both from Africa
and elsewhere), in addition to research abstracts, reviews, news, commentary on protocol
development, case reports, letters, guidelines, and books.

Search strategy

We developed a comprehensive search strategy following the JBI Scoping Review Network
guidelines. In order to gather all possible evidence in this field, an initial search was conducted
for articles published between January 1, 2000, and January 31, 2024, including Medline
(through PubMed), EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus and Pro-
Quest. Additionally, we searched grey literature, such as the ProQuest theses database, and
reviewed the references of eligible articles. We used a combination of Medical Subject Head-
ings/Entree terms as well as free terms according to population, intervention, and outcome
frameworks. S2 File provides detail of search terms.

Screening, quality of evidence, and critical appraisal of studies

Following the search of the databases, and removal of duplicate articles, a total of 2475 articles
were exported to Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. To screen the data, the first step was to
review the abstracts for clear points that addressed the research question, screening full text if

the abstract was either unavailable or did not provide sufficient information. Exclusion of the
papers was due to the following reasons: ineligible study types or populations, ineligible
research questions, review articles, reports, or perspectives, no additional data, or duplication
of publications. Additionally, we read references in papers to identify potential articles. We
then categorized the searched papers into yes, no, and unclear categories, and included uncer-
tain abstracts until we reviewed the full text articles to prepare the final list of eligible articles
that were imported into EndNote (version X9) according to their eligibility. To assess the qual-
ity of cross-sectional studies, we used a modified version of the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sec-
tional Studies (AXIS) [22]. This tool is designed to ensure systematic interpretation and to
inform decisions about the quality of cross-sectional studies. This critical appraisal (CA)
method is usually used in systematic reviews, but we found it very useful in this scoping review
study. The main components of this CA include assessing whether the study is suitable to
answer the hypothesized question and whether bias might be introduced. According to AXIS
tool, we used the following parameters for CA of studies:

1. The introduction: should include clear objectives.

2. Methods: a suitable study design; a sufficient sample size, usually > 100 except for quantita-
tive studies; a target population (African); a clear definition of the condition to be studied, a
validated instrument to assess it, and an appropriate statistical analysis plan for the
described data.

3. Results: the basic data were adequately presented; respondents and non-respondents were
described along with their reasons for not responding, and the results presented were
described in the methods section.

4. Discussion: The authors’ discussion and conclusions were supported by study results, and

limitations of the study were addressed clearly.

5. Other: funding source explained appropriately; no conflict of interest; ethics statement

available as needed.

For qualitative studies, a ten-point appraisal list consistent with the Critical Appraisal Skills

Programme (CASP) tool was used. The CAPS tool covers key aspects such as study design,
methodology, data analysis, and interpretation of results.

Data charting

The key information we charted for all publications was the following: the author(s), publica-
tion year, origin/country of the study (where it was conducted), category of the population
whether it is refugees, immigrants, or asylum seekers, study population and sample size (if
applicable), age categories, gender percentages, techniques, approaches, and methods used to
assess the MH under study, prevalence of the MH problem(s) under study, predictors and
determinants of the prevalence of the MH problems under study, and an overview of key find-
ings related to one or more of the scoping review questions. For the economic burden studies,
we extracted data about the approach used for the economic evaluation of the studied MH
problem. We also extracted data about study type and design, and the study outcome.

Data quality assurance and appraisal of individual sources

To achieve this goal, we used the condition-context-population-framework (CoCoPop) to
determine data eligibility. In addition to the comprehensive search which included searching
the grey literature, particularly theses through the ProQuest database, we included only articles

PLOS ONEMental Health Disorders in African Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Migrants

which were written in English to avoid misinterpretations and considered both the rationale
and limitations of publications. The data charting process included reviewing evidence from
all sources and using predefined charting formats. Following the inclusion of studies and the
recording of key information relevant to review questions, we developed a proposal to present
results in accordance with the objectives or review questions using diagrams, tables, or descrip-
tive formats.

Data analysis & synthesis

The extracted data were compiled using the narrative synthesis of Barnett-Page and Thomas
[23], and we followed the guidelines for data synthesis without meta-analysis [24].

3. Results
Characteristics of the included studies

Fig 1 summarizes the results of the study, which included 38 articles that met the inclusion
criteria.

Based on the 38 studies included in this review, 35 were quantitative cross-sectional studies,

while three were qualitative exploratory studies. A summary of the important findings of the
eligible articles is presented in Table 1 and Fig 2 illustrates the country location of each study.
As shown in Fig 2, the majority of the studies were conducted within the African continent,
with 22 studies being conducted on the continent. Among the studies, seven were from
Uganda, followed by four from Italy, and three from the United States. In most of these stud-
ies, both males and females are examined, focusing on refugees’ adult populations. A single
study focused on women, two on unaccompanied minors, one on children and parents as
dyads, and one on young adults. In the select studies, gender representation varies, but most
studies include more males than females. According to most studies, participants were less
than 40 years old on average. East Africa represented the majority of study participants, fol-
lowed by West Africa. No study included populations from Northern or Southern Africa. A
study of unaccompanied Eritrean minors in Sudan [25], used both research approaches. In
this study, after researchers determined the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the group,
they used a quantitative approach to develop themes based on the daily stressors associated
with these mental health disorders.

Description of the major conditions and the psychometric instruments
used in the examination

A wide range of mental and psychiatric conditions have been examined in the studies reviewed
in this article. Across all studies, PSTD or CPSTD was the most frequently studied condition.
Study focus, however, may vary from assessing a specific condition such as PSTD or depres-
sion to assessing the overall mental health of the study population, which may include anxiety,
depression, and PSTD together. Fig 3 summarizes the number of studies that examined differ-
ent mental disorders. It should be noted that each study examined more than one condition,
thus the number of studies does not equal 38 when taken as the total number of all studies
included.

Studies often used more than one set of instruments to assess the prevalence and patterns of

a particular condition, such that different instruments were used for different conditions. An
overview of the main instruments used to assess the different conditions is provided in
Table 2.

The prevalence of MH disorders among African asylum seekers, migrants,
and refugees

It is evident from Table 2 that mental health disorders have a high prevalence in all studies,
varying according to the demographics of the study population, the specific mental health con-
dition, and the location of the study population. Although it is difficult to compare prevalence
across these factors since different instruments are used for evaluating prevalence, as well as

the different contexts and conditions assessed in each study, certain patterns are evident.
Firstly, women have a higher prevalence of specific mental health conditions. According to a
study conducted on Congolese populations in Uganda [26], 94% of women reported symp-
toms of PTSD, compared to 84% of men [26]. A similar observation was made in another
study examining female Congolese and Somali populations in Uganda, where 92% and 71.1%
of men and women reported having PTSD and depression, respectively. Additionally, research
conducted within African countries tends to show a greater prevalence of different conditions

than research conducted elsewhere in the world. It is difficult, however, to draw any definitive
conclusions based on the different tools used.

Second, higher prevalence is associated with specific mental health conditions. There is a
high prevalence of PSTDs and CPSTDs across the included studies (range: 19.8% to 94%), per-
haps due to the fact that they are the most studied conditions [26, 31]. There was a similar
trend in the 17 studies that examined the prevalence of depression. Most studies reported a
prevalence of less than 50%, with a range between 20 and 67.9%. In other studies, similar
trends have been observed, however, suicidal ideation (7.3–31%) has been reported to be the
least common trend (which is not high when viewed in conjunction with the prevalence of
conditions associated with suicidal ideation, including depression). These data indicate that
asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees’ groups from African countries suffer from higher rates
of mental illness, specifically PTSD and depression, than the general population.

Qualitative studies overview

A qualitative examination of specific mental health conditions was conducted in three of the
studies in this review. Anakwenze and Rasmussen [29], investigated the effect of parental
trauma on the externalizing behavior of children using parent-child dyads. In another study
by Gakuba and colleagues s [37], examined the mental health of young adult refugees, as well
as the factors that predispose this population to poor mental health (Table 2). As part of their
study, a semi-structured interview process conducted with youth and professionals working in
the mental health field among asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees, themes for reasons for
poor mental health among these populations were identified, including immigration, and liv-
ing conditions, as well as the lengthy asylum process.

Results of the study in children and unaccompanied minors

Children were involved in five studies, either as unaccompanied minors (two studies) or ado-
lescents (one study) or as participants in studies in which one or both parents took part (two
studies). There is a marked difference in the prevalence of mental health problems among
unaccompanied minors in Africa and Europe; Eritrean minors in Sudan showed 88.9% anxiety
and depression, and African minors in Austria demonstrated 17 to 29% depression [25, 61].
One interesting study is that by Scharpf and colleagues [58] which shows that when examining
the whole Burundian families for suicidality, mothers and fathers showed different discrepan-
cies, with mothers being most affected than fathers, and children exhibiting lower rates when
living with their parents. According to these findings, suicide is predicted differently by family
members, with children more likely to commit suicide if they suffer from externalizing disor-
ders, mothers mostly due to violence, and fathers due to war-related trauma.

Predictors of different conditions’ prevalence

The studies that were included provided snapshot prevalence data, which cannot be used for
developing a mathematical model that can be used for predicting the prevalence of the disease.
The term "predictors" is therefore used to describe the factors and conditions associated with
the occurrence of a variety of mental health disorders, rather than to refer to predictive models
or factors that can be used to predict their prevalence.

There are certain demographic characteristics that are associated with a higher prevalence
of MH disorders and depression, namely older age, female gender, having no formal educa-
tion, being unemployed, and living in poor housing conditions [11]. Further, it has been
found that displacement history, poor social support, separation of the family during migra-
tion, post-migration isolation, and hostile attitudes from host populations are all important

Generally, "coping" refers to methods of minimizing distress caused by negative life
experiences. This 28-item self-report questionnaire measures how well an individual copes
with stressful life events by comparing effective and ineffective methods. The test can be used
to assess someone’s ability to cope with a wide range of difficulties. These difficulties include
severe medical conditions, injuries, traumatic events, natural disasters, and financial strain.

predictors that have been identified to explain the change in behavior [11]. A number of con-
ditions indicated different predictors that could be attributed to migration or refugee factors,
which are mainly traumatic events, as well as postmigration refugee factors, primarily the
length of time spent as a refugee or the time spent waiting for asylum, the difficulty of getting
medical care, as well as discrimination. Women are more likely to be affected by various forms
of gender-based violence, such as sexual violence, rape, or interpersonal violence than men,
which may explain why this review found a higher prevalence of PTSD in women across a
number of studies.

In regards to refugee populations in host countries outside Africa, a qualitative study found

that there are certain daily stressors that lead to mental health disorders and higher levels of
psychosocial stress for these populations [25]. There were several themes identified, including
harassment (verbal, sexual, and physical), racism, financial difficulties, acculturation distress,
and restricted freedom. Table 3 summarizes the major predictors of the various conditions
across all the studies.

among African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees, we identified only one study that

examined the specific economic impacts of mental health interventions [62]. The study used
the Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI), a behavioral intervention designed to reduce func-
tional impairment (expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years - QALYs) among war-
affected young people in Freetown, Sierra Leone who were not able to attend school (Table 4).
In the secondary analysis, financial and economic costs were analyzed as well as incremental
cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) based on gains across mental health and education dimen-
sions. In the YRI group, school retention was higher, functional impairments were lower, and
the ICER per QALY gained was $7260. According to the authors, when the willingness-to-pay
threshold exceeds three times the average gross domestic product per capita, the YRI is not
cost-effective. Despite this, the results of the YRI indicate that a range of benefits were derived,
including an increase in enrollment in schools, which was not captured in the cost-effective-
ness analysis.

4. Discussion

This study examined mental health disorders among asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees
from African countries without any restrictions regarding the refugee experience (region of
origin, duration of displacement, or country of settlement, among others). One important
observation is that most asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees tend to relocate within Africa,
whereas younger age groups tend to leave the continent, particularly to Europe. There may be
a war-related explanation for this trend. For example, the Libyan war, which has left the coun-
try unable to control its borders. As a result, West Africa is cut off from the Mediterranean
Sea, which provides access to Europe. Similarly, Sudan, with its long history of conflict and
border with Libya, offered an alternative path to Eastern Africans.

It appears that most of the studies were conducted before 2020, suggesting that the

COVID-19 epidemic may have negatively impacted refugee movements. Even so, it is expected
that these disputes will continue to escalate due to ongoing conflicts and tensions in Africa, as
well as the global economic crisis, as the Lampedusa refugee crisis in Italy recently

Key findings

The primary analysis used
an ’ingredients approach’
to estimate the financial
and economic costs. A

(ICER) expressed in terms
of mental health and
schooling gains was also
calculated.
A secondary analysis
examined whether
intervention effects were
greatest among the worst-
off (upper quartile)
psychological distress at
baseline.

Primary analysis yielded an
ICER of $7260 per QALY
gained.
Secondary analyses
indicated that the
intervention was cost-
effective ¶ among those
worst-off psychological
distress at baseline, yielding
an ICER of $3564 per
quality-adjusted life years
(QALY) gained.
However, observations
were seen in until 6-month
follow-up duration and not
after that.

¶ Cost effectiveness was defined as meaning that each QALY gained would cost less than three times the country’s average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at
purchasing power parity.

demonstrated. Currently, the British government is proposing a number of laws to control asy-
lum seekers, migrants, and refugees in the UK, which illustrates how local governments in
Europe are becoming more aware of the importance of future trends in asylum seekers,
migrants, and refugees.

Refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants from African countries are more
likely to suffer from mental health disorders

Based on this research, African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees suffer from high rates
of PTSD (19.8% to 94%) and depression (20% to 67%). The prevalence of both conditions in
African populations is significantly higher than in global migrant and refugee populations
(PTSD prevalence = 31.5%; depression prevalence = 31.5%) [63]. One possible explanation is
that most forced migrations within the continent are the result of war or violence. Our
research shows that war survivors and refugees from conflict-affected regions suffer from
higher PTSD rates [64, 65]. Nevertheless, African populations also have significantly higher
prevalence rates than other war-affected migrant and refugee groups such as Syrians resettled
in Western countries, who report prevalence of PTSD and depression at 31.5% [66]. The rea-
son for this observation is unclear and warrants further research, however, we hypothesize that
the poor living conditions of African refugees and migrants in host African countries and the
challenges faced by racism and social integration in Western host countries may contribute to
higher mental health conditions.

Moreover, the prevalence rates of PTSD and depression in African refugee and migrant
populations are higher than those in the general population, where lifetime prevalence is esti-
mated at 3.9% and 10.8%, respectively [67, 68]. In light of this evidence, the migration morbid-
ity hypothesis [69] is supported and the healthy migrant hypothesis [70] may be contested.
There are two possible explanations for this. First, African refugee and migrant populations in
host African countries continue to live in poor conditions and suffer from unemployment,
both of which contribute to the prevalence of morbidity. Secondly, it is notable that a signifi-
cant portion of the population in these select studies has experienced forced migration rather
than voluntary migration, which, according to the literature, is highly selective of the younger
and healthier migrants.

Similarly, we establish that anxiety disorders and psychosis are less prevalent among Afri-

can asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees. This is consistent with the results of systematic
reviews of global refugee and migrant populations that indicate a lower prevalence of anxiety
disorders and psychosis (11% and 1.51% respectively) as well as a lower prevalence than those
in the general population of 16% [71] and 3% [72]. Although the reason for this is unclear, we
believe that perhaps anxiety disorders and psychosis are less researched in these populations
due to a lack of research focus or a bias in selection of study participants. Also, according to
Derek Summerfield, western notions of anxiety and psychosis, and therefore the criteria and
tools used to diagnose them, may not be applicable to African settings [73].

A number of the predictors of MH disorders identified in this study, such as socio-demo-
graphic factors, social and interpersonal relationships, as well as exposure to traumatic experi-
ences and violence, are supported by evidence in the literature [74]. PTSD, the most frequently
studied condition, is present in more than 50% of these groups, due to their exposure to severe
traumatic experiences related to displacement in conflict-ridden African countries.

Our findings highlight specific gender patterns. The majority of asylum seekers, migrants,

and refugees leaving Africa are young males. Furthermore, females are more likely to suffer
from PTSD than males due to the significant trauma they have experienced due to gender-
based sexual violence. According to studies on PTSD and gender, women are more likely than

men to suffer from PTSD [75, 76]. It is more likely that women will experience sexual violence
during times of conflict [77, 78], which may increase their risk of PTSD, as well as childrearing
pressures, safety concerns, and exploitation. Despite this, studies from countries that have
been reported to commit systematic sexual violence do not adequately describe the type of
trauma associated with PTSD diagnosis [79]. Furthermore, there are major gaps in the litera-
ture when it comes to disaggregating data by gender for other mental health conditions,
whereas gender disaggregated data for PTSD is readily available. According to best reporting
practices, future research in this field should disaggregate outcome measures by gender.

In accordance with findings from a global systematic review in 2020 [80], our review also

identified several predictors of post-migration mental health disorders in host countries,
including prolonged detention, long waits for refugee permits, limited healthcare access, accul-
turation difficulties, and low social support and integration. The West underestimates these
challenges, as do African nations. The prevalence of postmigration mental health disorders is
higher in countries with harsh immigration policies, such as detention, deportation, and delays
in refugee determination and resettlement processes. Likewise, local population shifts against
immigration host countries and increased hostility towards refugee populations negatively
impact social integration and increase the risk of mental illness. Furthermore, MH disorders
in asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees’ groups can have long-lasting impacts on the next
generation. It appears that there are gaps in the existing literature, such as the lack of longitudi-
nal studies in these groups and assessments of the economic costs associated with MH disor-
ders in African populations.

MH disorders are more prevalent among children, adolescents, and their
families from African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees

The prevalence of depression, anxiety, emotional problems, and behavioral problems among
refugee and asylum seeker children and adolescents was generally higher than that of native
children and adolescents [81–84]. It is possible for these differences to vary depending on the
type of trauma experienced in the country of origin or during migration, as well as the chal-
lenges and problems faced by the host country [85]. The development of psychiatric disorders
in children and adolescents is affected by several factors [85–87]. Among them: pre-migration
factors such as poverty, violence, wars, warlike conditions, education, family values, social and
cultural values; peri-migration issues such as separation, abuse, and trafficking; and post-
migration issues such as schooling, social support, stable settlement, parental mental health,
and legal aspects of immigration. This scoping review found that unaccompanied minors suf-
fer from more anxiety disorders, depressions, and PTSD than accompanied minors [88],
which indicates that they require special care. As a result, while this review summarizes migra-
tion factors’ associations with mental health disorders, it does not provide an in-depth analysis
of this complex interplay.

The prevalence of PTSD and depression in the postmigration environment suggests that
ongoing stressors may contribute to MH problems. In particular, Anakwenze and Rasmussen’s
[29] study indicates that mental illness in parents of asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees’
groups can manifest in their children, who are born and raised there without having to deal
with displaced conditions or volition in their original countries. Foreign environments can
present several challenges, including social and cultural isolation, reorganization of family rela-
tionships, difficulty adjusting to the culture, and limited economic and social opportunities.

MH in postmigration environments may also be hampered by low social support, accumula-

tion challenges, and other factors. In contrast to depression or post-traumatic stress disorder,
displaced individuals were more likely to experience anxiety. Fazel and colleagues’ study on the

mental health of displaced and refugee children resettled in high-income countries [85]
reported a higher prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in chil-
dren. It is likely that this is due to the fact that we included studies of refugees’ populations in
low- and middle-income countries, where there may be a greater number of predictors and risk
factors. Another explanation is based on methodology. It is likely that there is a difference in
prevalence because it was not aggregated into a single figure, as in systematic reviews, but
described as a range of values from individual studies that were highly heterogeneous in nature.

Literature gaps regarding African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees

During our review, we identified that there is a lack of comprehensive assessment of the eco-
nomic burden of MH diseases among asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees, especially in
African countries. In the literature, there are only a few studies that examine the economic
impact of restructuring on the health sector, including mental health services, without consid-
ering the burden on those services. The absence of empirical studies on the economic dimen-
sions of mental health in African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees underscores the
urgent need to understand the intricate relationship between mental health challenges and
economic outcomes. Accordingly, future research should focus on unraveling the nuanced
complexities of how mental health issues manifest and influence the economic landscape of
African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees. Additionally, a deeper understanding of these
dynamics may assist us in developing supportive interventions that are tailored to these
groups’ specific needs.

Furthermore, in studies using certain diagnostic assessments such as the PDS, PTSD and
depression were more prevalent than in studies using the ITQ or PHQ. It should be noted that
most of these instruments are self-admitted; however, the PDS is detailed and includes sub-
scale scores for intrusions, avoidance, and arousal symptoms, so it can report a higher preva-
lence rate. The same trend can be observed in instruments for other conditions as well.
Overall, we found no difference between interviews conducted with interpretation assistance
and those conducted in a native language. As a result of my study, it was found that although
the diagnostic measures are perceived to be similar in their accuracy and performance, they
differ in certain respects. Therefore, it is critical that the method and instrument used to assess
refugee populations’ mental health be carefully selected. Due to clinicians’ reliance on self-
reported symptoms when diagnosing mental illness, this difference may be caused by a num-
ber of factors, including language proficiency. It is necessary to conduct research to determine
whether native interviewers conducting interpreter-assisted interviews and clinicians conduct-
ing assessments in their native language can grasp cultural and linguistic nuances that may
affect diagnostic accuracy. It is important to note that we did not examine how diagnostic
measures and tools may affect diagnosis of cases. In these studies, we acknowledge that western
representations and understandings of psychiatric conditions have a great deal of influence on
the tools developed. Consequently, either African populations’ mental health disorders are
overmedicalized or underdiagnosed. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research in
this area.

Strengths and limitations of the study

This study examined the prevalence, predictors, and economic burden of mental health disor-
ders in this population and extends beyond post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to include
depression, anxiety, and psychosis. By specifically focusing on the African demographic, this
study significantly contributes to the existing body of evidence regarding mental health disor-
ders among asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants. This study sheds light on the substantial

PLOS ONEMental Health Disorders in African Asylum Seekers, Refugees and Migrants

presence of African asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees in economically disadvantaged Afri-
can nations, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced healthcare support in these regions in
contrast to many studies conducted in high-income countries. Additionally, by emphasizing
the significant mental health burden experienced by asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees, as
well as the burgeoning displaced population, the study underscores the necessity for both short-
term and long-term mental health services following resettlement, emphasizing the importance
of comprehensive mental health support to address these pressing needs.

Similarly, our study has several limitations. As seen in our review and other systematic
reviews, findings can vary considerably due to differences in methodological and clinical qual-
ity among included studies. Different ethnic groups in Africa, varying ages, and the use of a
variety of diagnostic tools may all contribute to this heterogeneity. Despite this high degree of
heterogeneity, as is expected when investigating and analyzing prevalence across the popula-
tion of global refugees, a sense of accomplishment has been achieved in knowing that current
prevalence estimates can provide a starting point for further research.

Specifically, our study revealed that self-reports and proxy-reports often indicated a higher
point prevalence of mental health disorders than structured clinical interviews using standard
diagnostic criteria, such as DSM. A psychological or psychiatric assessment may be necessary
in this case. In addition, we did not conduct subgroup analyses or exclude studies reporting
data on specific subgroups, such as male-female comparisons, which could have provided
valuable insights into these distinctions. To enhance the accuracy and depth of our under-
standing of MH disorders among asylum seekers, migrants, and refugees from African popula-
tions within the context of our study, it is important to standardize assessment methods and
consider subgroup differences. It is also possible that this variation may hinder the compara-
bility of data among countries and international organizations. To enhance data exchange and
cooperation among entities such as UNHCR, a unified methodology approach should be
established, incorporating clear definitions and guidelines.

Conclusions

In summary, MH disorders are significantly more prevalent among asylum seekers, migrants,
and refugees from African countries than in the general population. There are several predic-
tors of MH disorders in this population, including sociodemographic factors and postmigra-
tion stressors, both in host African countries as well as Western host countries. The economic
burden of MH disorders in this group is largely unknown. An understanding of the longitudi-
nal effects of migration on MH disorders in this population, and the resulting economic bur-
den, requires more research.

Recommendations

• Prioritize mental health: Research should focus on mental health concerns among refugees

and asylum seekers, emphasizing that mental well-being needs to be prioritized over physical
health.

• Special attention to women and unaccompanied minors: women and unaccompanied

minors, considered high-risk groups, require special attention. In addition to expediting
their asylum claims, host countries should offer them employment and educational opportu-
nities. The psychological intervention that enhances coping strategies, self-esteem, and iden-
tity rebuilding is especially beneficial for refugee groups.

• Incorporating mental health into economic programs: Interventions such as Youth Readi-
ness Intervention (YRI) have proven effective not just in improving refugee quality but also

in terms of generating income-producing opportunities and school retention. Hence, it is
important to integrate them into economic plans that target these groups of people.

• Methodological standardization and priorities for research: Comparable and validated meth-
ods and tools should be used when studying MH in these populations. Women, unaccompa-
nied minors, and the economic aspects of the problem are important research areas. Despite
evidence that MH can manifest in offspring of these human groups and be a long-term issue,
our analysis found no longitudinal studies. Research in this area is also important. Without
further high-quality research that examines the different components of MH needs, cultur-
ally appropriate and effective interventions, and longitudinal mental illness trajectory, which
will have a significant impact on successful integration, untreated mental illnesses will
adversely affect successful integration into host communities.
