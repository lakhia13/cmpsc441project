Disenfranchised Grief

Conventionally, therapeutic assessments, interventions, and treatments have focussed
on death-related “losses and grief” responses. It is purported that the COVID-19
aftermath has resulted in losses that cannot always be encapsulated using this method.
In search of reasoning, models and theories that explain the sweeping mass destruction
that COVID-19 has caused, key concepts arise in terms of how we should deal with
losses and in turn support patients in the health and social care sector, (notwithstanding
formal therapeutic services). There is a crucial need to embrace ambiguous loss and
disenfranchised grief into everyday terminology and be acquainted with these issues,
thereby adapting how services/clinicians now embrace loss and grief work. Integral to
this process is to recognize that there has been a disproportionate impact on Black and
minority ethnic communities, and we now need to ensure services are “seriously culturally
competent.” Primary Care services/IAPT/health and social care/voluntary sector are all
likely to be at the forefront of delivering these interventions and are already established
gatekeepers. So, this article discusses the prognostic therapeutic response to non-death
related losses and grief, not restricted to the formal echelons of therapeutic provision.

Keywords: COVID, loss, grief, therapy, primary care, BAME

INTRODUCTION: THE CONTEXT

“...in a ﬁeld focused on the rupture in attachment bonds and associated grief in the aftermath of the death
of a signiﬁcant person, the far vaster domain of non-death losses has receded into relative invisibility,
though the grief that attends them often may be equally substantial”. (1, p.12)

There are many theories and subjugations about death, grief and loss, over the last Century. Harris
(1) presents a comprehensive account of non-death related losses. This paper extends and adds
to the valuable contributions due to the recent impact of COVID-19 and encourages health and
social care professionals to be mindful of the insidious losses that may fester. Although this paper is
written from a UK perspective the authors do not doubt that other cultures are undergoing similar
traumatic challenges.

Aim
The purpose of this article then is to highlight that grief work in therapeutic services has largely
been on death, it is then hardly a revelation that we are now “pandemic stricken” to address the
therapeutic aftermath of COVID-19. The primary aim is to deduce the literature on non-death
related COVID and make recommendations to therapeutic providers to adapt traditional loss and

Methods
A selective review of papers has been presented to illustrate the
need for focus on non-death related losses due to the breadth
of literature in many ﬁelds. This methodology demonstrates an
alternative to systematic review which can often be constrained
to speciﬁc subjects or ﬁelds and lend little to a newly developing
topic, as such, COVID related non-death losses. It would be
naïve to assume that currently, one central literature searching
system can fully encapsulate such a new topic, particularly due
to the multi-faceted nature of COVID impact from marketing
to public health. The authors acknowledge that this process is
not free from selective bias and indeed compromises the depth
that a systematic review would capture. However, the idea is to
encourage debate into the nature of COVID losses and advocate
for further research.

RESULTS

This selective review enabled the deducing of a wide-range
of factors that need to be accounted for when considering
COVID related losses in therapeutic losses. The result would
enable therapists and clinicians to ensure their assessments and
treatment protocols moving forward look beyond death when
deciphering COVID impact factors. Indeed, to ensure BAME
consideration is not missed regarding access or adaptability of
current workings.

DISCUSSION

outcomes. There is now a pressing political, academic, and social
need to look at non-related deaths, namely, ambiguous loss and
disenfranchised grief.

COVID-19 is a human disaster that has led to a form of loss
and grief that is complex and cannot ﬁt traditional pathologies
of depression, anxiety, and worry—the medical quandary of
psychiatric diagnosis may fall short to address some of the
idiosyncratic experiences of many. The resulting “new normal”
of the COVID-19 pandemic has left families bewildered with
traumatic losses as never before (3). At the time of writing
127,762,656 cases and 2,795,872 deaths from COVID-19 (4) have
been reported throughout the world. These statistics are open
to interpretation and should be used with caution due to the
diﬀerences in reporting/ recording deaths, particularly in less
developed countries such as India (5). The impact of COVID-19
on the world in terms of deaths alone is non-quantiﬁable.

COVID losses are a public health issue and the psychological
processing of this cannot be clumped in with other models.
However, it is widely acknowledged that mental health is a public
health issue, and research has extensively identiﬁed that the
impact of lockdown was severe (6, 7) and low mood identiﬁed as
a real concern (8). The Afghanistani crisis that arose alongside
the pandemic resulted in a secondary global public health
concern and strategies to support these communities need to be
considered (9).

further marginalized ethnic minorities disproportionately, and
the urban environment may critically inﬂuence the mental
health of minorities during the pandemic (10). Pierce et al.
(11) recommend that when considering the longitudinal impact
of COVID-19 on mental health recommends prioritizing the
needs of young people, women and pre-school children, and the
authors wish to draw attention to the BAME aspect in light of this.

The discussion embraces a wide plethora of multi-modal
literature sources, reﬂecting on key areas that lend to the panacea
of therapeutic advances notwithstanding the BAME interface and
additional considerations. Explicit recommendations are made to
the therapeutic community to adapt to non-death related losses,
giving due consideration to BAME communities.

A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE

The perceived capricious and ﬁckle nature of COVID and
evolving evidence base has aﬀected every corner of the globe
with changing requirements to isolate; most pertinently it has
left many families grieving loved ones and others dealing with
the loss due to physical disability associated with long COVID
(2). Almost everybody has experienced the loss of restricted
movement and reduced social contact whilst others have faced
redundancy or reduced income and boredom whilst on furlough.
Many are also aﬀected by contradictory news reports and
national strategies leading to an insidious loss of trust. COVID-
19 has indeed left people bereft of many less recognized losses
that need to be acknowledged and given credibility. Moreover,
therapeutic services need to embrace the “being present” and
the patient over the primary need for
relational needs of

Deﬁnitions
Deﬁning loss and grief has always been fraught with semantics
leading to various schools of thought about the diﬀerences in
terminology, and to the extent to which it relates to death or other
losses. Grief is frequently deﬁned as the normal response to loss
(12). Yet it is often inferred that death is not the only loss, but the
only loss that legitimizes a grief reaction. According to Harris (1),
a loss can be deﬁned as an experience where there is a change in
“circumstances, perception or experience,” and the individual is
unable to return to a previous state. Her analogy of a shattered
piece of glass that can be mended but never exists is useful in
describing how loss is experienced. The idiographic positioning
of the interpretation of loss in this deﬁnition is precisely what is
needed to formulate the wide array of experiences that COVID-
19 has inﬂicted on the population. Traditional approaches to grief
have largely focussed on death and relational separation. The use
of memory boxes and “digital death” literature posited important
perspectives of keeping the “memories alive” or “celebrating the
life and contributions,” they made to the idiographic journey.
Digital methods of grief are particularly useful in helping young
people grieve (13). The use of storytelling, reframing and creating
a narrative of the deceased is considered a way of coping (14).
The use of rituals around death have long been appraised and

understandings of grief. Grief has been conceptualized as a
disease (16) and as as a series of stages in time (17, 18). Kubler
Ross (19) famously formulated a ﬁve-stage theory of grieving
based on her work talking to dying patients in a hospice setting.
Although widely critiqued as presenting a simplistic and linear
understanding of grief this model is widely used within therapy
and has greatly inﬂuenced many practitioners’ understanding. A
preferred model is the Dual Process Model (20) which proposes
that grief involves the individual in two separate but interrelated
modes of grief. These are a “loss orientation” mode when the
focus is on acknowledging and processing the emotions of
grief and a “restoration orientation” mode when the focus is
on engaging in coping with the world without the support of
the deceased. Hence, the individual oscillates between periods
of emotion and remembering and adjusting their lives. This
model is preferred in terms of therapeutic psychoeducation or
indeed managing COVID-19 related grief as it draws attention
to the fact that isolation and lockdown have not only challenged
individuals to process the emotions of grief without the physical
presence of
friends, and professional
support systems. This is epitomized by a new legal limit in the
number of mourners at a funeral. However, it is also important to
note that there have also been abundant challenges to restoration,
requiring the bereaved to negotiate a world that is greatly altered
without the support of those they loved.

the extended family,

It is acknowledged that not all griefs are equal or treated
equally by society. Doka (21) deﬁnes disenfranchised grief as
grief that results when a person experiences a signiﬁcant loss and
the resultant grief is not openly acknowledged, socially validated,
or publicly mourned. In a time when many are grieving the
unanticipated death of loved ones, others may feel inhibited
and disenfranchised from expressing the grief they feel at not
being able to visit living relatives, particularly those who are
frail elderly and/or in residential care. Indeed, Sudnow (22),
emphasized the concept of social death, in which the person is
alive but treated as if dead. It is very easy to postulate that many
individuals are feeling socially dead due to enforced restriction of
social contacts currently. Another interrelated concept is that of
ambiguous loss (23). This is a loss that occurs without closure
or clear understanding. A commonly cited example is that of
a spouse of a person with dementia, who is both with and
simultaneously without, their partner. The loss of a relationship
during COVID can similarly be conceptualized as ambiguous
grief as the loved one is both living but unavailable to normal
contact. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that there
are liberating losses (24) when people experience feelings of relief,
freedom, or happiness when society expects sadness and distress.
This may relate to an acknowledgment of the end of suﬀering
after the ambiguous loss of caring for someone with dementia
but may also be experienced when COVID restrictions have
prevented the necessity of visiting the sick and dying.

Much grief resolves or develops into an increased sense of
maturity with time (18). However, a proportion of grief can

be persistent and severely disabling. This is commonly termed
complicated or complex grief. Factors that may be associated with
complex grief include a sense of disbelief regarding the death,
anger and bitterness regarding the death (25). There remain
many COVID-19 deniers and the rapidness with which this new
disease has impacted society and front-line workers mean that
there is the potential for deaths and other losses associated with
COVID-19 to linger without support and attention (26).

Death and Loss
Ariès (27) highlights how death occurs in a historical, cultural,
and social context. His seminal work, Western Attitudes Toward
Death from the Middle Ages to the Present, presents four
key periods in the past millennium. He documents an abrupt
change in the mid 18th century when death becomes othered
and dramatized. He highlights how family and friends have
been enabled to mourn and freely display emotion from this
time (27). Death separated the living from the dead and the
living were consoled through memories and mourning. He then
shows how death became more hidden and shameful in the 19th
century and was increasingly associated with old age. Indeed,
the majority of people began to die in hospital with shielding
of information about the death to spare the bereaved from
emotional turmoil. Jacobssen (28, 29) proposed a ﬁfth, more
recent phase of spectacular death, where death and mourning
have increasingly become spectacles, with a strong urge to create
memories and memorials, both physical and digital for those who
have died. Walter (30) draws attention to the way that dying,
funerals, mourning and afterlife beliefs are continually evolving
and that we must evolve new ways to manage dying, funerals
and mourning. Walter (30) highlights how containing grief and
emotion can be psychologically and socially necessary in high
death rate situations and societies whilst expressing them can
be productive in times of peace and security. The challenges
presented by COVID-19 as death again occurs sequestered in
hospitals but mourning and grief are continually being discussed
in the public sphere and the living are confronted with multiple
ambiguous losses embedded in restrictions to everyday life within
a multicultural society (31).

THE MEDICAL
PERSPECTIVE-DIAGNOSTICS

We know that death alone is not the only event that can
cause grief reactions, even complicated grief in people (32,
33). Studies are well averse to the aspect that ambiguous loss
and disenfranchised grief in people can take a toll on their
livelihoods, often undetected and minimized as “life- changes.”
Prior attempts to capture diﬃculties in response to change
have been encapsulated by “adjustment disorder” and focus on
behaviors rather than the root cause. In psychiatry, the diagnosis
of “Prolonged Grief disorder” (34) or “Persistent Complex
Bereavement Disorder” (35), is fairly new. Prigerson et al. (36)
developed a psychometric validity of criteria where there is a
heightened risk of persistent “distress and function.” PTSD and
the relationship with grief are considered yet, the psychological

measures unless used in conjugation with grief measures do not
necessarily look at loss. A history of losses can be mesmerized
by depression and anxiety disorder, the patient not disclosing
the losses and the therapist working on symptomatology.
Nevertheless, Diagnostic Criteria for DSM-5 Persistent Complex
Bereavement Disorder and ICD-11 Prolonged Grief Disorder
criteria focus on the loss of a signiﬁcant other by death. Harris
(1) posits that in non-death losses the term chronic sorrow is
more appropriate and points out key diﬀerences between the

consideration for how loss is assessed during and post-
COVID, and how we capture the timeline in the therapeutic
approaches whether they be counseling or CBT. The usual
psychiatric evaluation or clinical presentation may need to be
more investigative in nature, particularly where the presentation
of the individual may be taciturn or morose. Not all individuals
who experience grief and loss will likely be assessed or even
formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist- many of these individuals
will rely on a good formulation in psychological services and
support from the wider health and social care services. Using a
variety of psychological measures to triage, such as the Inventory
of Complicated Grief (ICG) instead of usual trauma measures
should be given due consideration (37, 38). All very well

COVID-19 BOTTOMLESS PIT OF LOSSES

The challenges presented by COVID-19 as death again occurs
sequestered in hospitals, but mourning and grief are continually
being discussed in the public sphere and the living are confronted
with multiple ambiguous losses embedded in restrictions to
everyday life within a multicultural society (31).

Living in bubbles and self-isolating has aﬀected previously
formed collegial relationships and bonds. Anthologists have
suggested the alternative approach of social containment, which
is more about building links and reducing isolation (39, 40).
The key areas of prospective lockdown striking have been
identiﬁed, however notably, the losses are subject to individual
interpretation and are endless. The profound impact on
vulnerable and already disadvantaged groups in society cannot be
quantiﬁed; the elderly, victims of abuse, disabled/ mental health
aﬀected, have all experienced the consequences of COVID-19
(41). The fragility of social interactions is further observed in
the closure of shops, nightclubs, pubs, football stadiums and
social venues in the UK, albeit arguably these closures could have
been earlier.

Across the life- span, children have been adversely aﬀected
by the uncertainty that the Schools’ debate has caused- whether
children are at risk at school or not was always likely to be
anxiety-provoking. The intersection with socio-economic status

and that 50% of children did not get free school meals during
the pandemic is extremely concerning (42). There will be a
scientiﬁc evidence base to follow when children return to school
and the impact of the pandemic. University numbers have been
aﬀected particularly where International students are concerned,
and refunds are demanded where online provision is alternated
at times (43). There is a whole population of students and pupils
who will need support with educational loss in years to come, and
services need to respond to these needs.

The UK employment market alone is radically aﬀected by
COVID-19 and despite support packages for SMEs (Small and
Medium-size Enterprises), the business industry accounting for
50% of all UK revenue was badly aﬀected by the pandemic (44).
Notably, an approximate 5% proportion of this sector is likely to
be occupied by BAME communities due to the discrimination
they encounter in the labor market. Unemployment rates are
high (5% compared to 4% pre-pandemic), beneﬁt claimants have
risen by 113% and the economic recession will inevitably aﬀect
the population substantially in due course.

Nicola et al. (45) provide a comprehensive global socio-
economic analysis of the impact of COVID. The agricultural
industry has taken a 20% hit due to hotels and restaurants closing.
Demand for petrol has reduced and this is a major loss of income.
Whilst furlough schemes and other incentives are in place to keep
the economy going, the recession and impact of the economic
losses are likely to aﬀect the whole of the UK population for years
ahead. The social drift theory including impact on mental health
(46) suggests downward mobility will inevitably give rise to
disenfranchised losses, including impact on mental health strain.
Child contact in normal cases has become strained with
lockdown rules, impacting children who wish to spend time
with both parents, and indeed with shielding grandparents (47).
Wealthy citizens have been “banking on COVID” in divorce
settlements to ensure they pay out less (48). Law ﬁrms have
alluded to an increase in divorce cases however this is yet to be
conﬁrmed in the upcoming Census 2021 (49). What we do know
is high street stores have jumped on the “COVID loss” industry
and are selling divorce celebration products, so all is not lost,
i.e., banners such as “newly unwed.” Regardless, for many, there
may be a disenfranchised loss in terms of the relationship and
celebrations may not be foremost and hence support services
need to consider the variety of responses a loss of relationship
could invoke aligned to grief theories already purported.

Many perspectives of death have been explored and how
we cope with it culturally. There are various religious and
cultural practices around the meaning of death. Mourning,
the expression of sorrow for someone’s death is an important
cultural practice however limitations on the numbers at funerals,
restrictions on indoor gatherings and COVID travel restrictions
have led to funerals becoming “by invitation only” during the
COVID pandemic have all interrupted the normal expressions
of grief. Moreover, singing and chanting in public have also
been banned. For many, including those of Southeast Asian
heritage, the loss of shared cultural experiences of mourning has
complicated grief responses. Asian communities rely on inter-
familiar support and because of the high impact of BAME deaths
that these communities particularly suﬀered. Notably, loneliness

Ambiguous Loss and Disenfranchised Grief

and isolation aﬀected people of all cultures across the lifespan,
from older adults to young children.

This disenfranchisement of mourning cultures may be
ampliﬁed by the ambiguity of the loss in the context of the
pandemic. Inevitably, the processing of losses during COVID-
19 in other cultures is an important consideration. The
political and social struggle against Xenophobia toward the
Chinese population, and further demonstrated through the Black
Lives Matters concerns, have highlighted the disproportionate
“ambiguous” losses that BAME families face. Social distancing
has caused immense losses in cultural celebrations and the notion
of extended families in the South Asian future, thus far not
represented in academic literature.

Virtual methods had implications

for older BAME
communities, often where English was a second language.
This resulted in not only isolation that was strange in extended
family structures but a lack of recognition during the pandemic
and service provision to cope with the disenfranchised grief of
not connecting with others.

DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT

Essentially, Otu et al. (50) address the disproportionate impact
death has had on “already vulnerable” BAME communties. The
authors acknowledge that COVID-19 and BLM (Black Lives
Matter) has given rise to the debate around whether the term
BAME is suitable (51). The contention around this terminology
is ongoing, however, it is important to note that academically it
is useful at this stage to use the term in accessing literature on
the topic. The current revival of “lay’ and secularized practices
of keeping loved one’s memories alive including children are
resurfacing in therapeutic responses to death. Every therapeutic
community or service must develop rapid systems to embrace
the aftermath of COVID related presentations and predict new
ways of working. These in turn mean a review of how current
responses to grief and loss may diﬀer over the coming years, a
bio-psycho-social consideration is much needed.

There have been long-lasting eﬀects on all communities
including mental health deterioration during lockdown (52). The
BAME population in the UK stands at 14% based on the Census
(53), yet Black African males are 4 times more likely to die
due to COVID than their white counterparts reinforcing already
recognized health and social disparities (49). Chaudhry et al. (54)
postulate that the 64% BAME National Health Service (NHS)
employed staﬀ may have been deployed into high virus areas
which resulted in disproportionate deaths. The ongoing impact of
COVID-19 and the disproportionate impact on BAME families
cannot be underestimated, “not only have Black, Asian and
minority ethnic people been overexposed to contracting COVID-
19, but the economic impact of the pandemic is also likely to
disproportionately aﬀect these communities too” [(55), p. 5]. Sze
et al. (56) in a systematic review concluded that individuals of
Black and Asian ethnicity are at increased risk of COVID-19
infection and Asians may be at higher risk of ITU admission
and death. Speciﬁcally, the Racial Disparities Unit (RDU) found
an alarming impact of COVID-19 on Bengali and Pakistani

communities mainly due to multi-generational households (57).
There is a disproportionate rate of deaths in these communities
which must be considered and catered for, rather than the usual
homogenisation of BAME communities.

RESILIENCE, COPING AND HOPE

There is a humanistic desire that a global tragedy like COVID-
19 should result in enhanced community social cohesion and
resilience (58). Empaths across the world, charity workers,
keyworkers and religious aid all stepped up to buﬀer against
losses. Despite the critique,
in the UK there were pockets
of ﬁnancial support available to businesses, homeowners and
employers. Yet, developing countries relied on spiritual strength
and versatility to be resilient. The kind acts of individuals and
organizations, and some infrastructure, have inspired hope and
compassion. These altruistic human conditions serve as antidotes
to the manifold losses experienced during the pandemic and
must be acknowledged. Trzebi´nski et al. (59) posited that the
key ingredients to being resilient in the pandemic were, (1)
the inﬂuence of meaning in life, (2) life satisfaction, and (3)
assumptions on world orderliness and positivity, all of which
will result in lower stress and anxiety responses. How society
will respond long term to the losses of COVID is yet to be
determined. All models of grief acknowledge that grieving takes
time. Klass et al. (60) highlight the need for continuing bonds
with the deceased to support healthy grieving and resilience. It
may be that society will need to develop civic forms of national
memorialisation or that a more individualized approach will
be more beneﬁcial in the long term. However, the restoration
orientation of Stroebe and Schuts model (20) highlights that the
cost will not just be emotional but in enabling everyone in society
with the skills to reorientate to a post COVID world.

The term thanatechnology (61) incorporates internet tools
that can be utilized to commemorate the deceased in the form of
a continuing bond and inadvertently become digitally immortal.
Testoni et al. (62) carried out a qualitative study in Italy during
the pandemic to report the use of social networks to connect with
others during the pandemic was useful in the mourning process.
Features of ambiguous loss were present amongst those unable
to be present with family, yet the connectedness was helpful.
The feeling of abandonment by health services was a prominent
theme within the study.

Furthermore, emotional dysregulation (the ability to regulate
emotion to situations and adapt), has been considered to aﬀect
people across the life- span. Moccia et al. (63), in an Italian study,
were able to identify the relationship between lack of emotional
regulation and reduced hedonic tone (ability to feel pleasure) as
predictors for COVID- related depression. Janiri et al. (64, 65)
identiﬁed that emotional regulation was particularly a concern
in older adults, over the age of 60 which resulted in low mood.
Janiri et al. (64, 65) identiﬁed that emotional dysregulation was
a key mediating factor when considering trauma in children.
In fact, childhood trauma was seen to increase vulnerability to
stress due to COVID-19. Therefore, it seems that emotional
dysregulation and reduced hedonic tone should be targeted in

IMPACT ON NURSES

including nurses, had to support
Healthcare professionals,
increased numbers of people dying in all
locations: Indeed,
there were 76,000 excess deaths in England and Wales in
2020 (66). Home deaths increased by a third during COVID
meaning community nurses were providing complex care to
people who might otherwise have died in hospital. Deaths in
hospitals also increased (66) with restricted family access, which
has compounded the grieving experience.

Wilson and Kirshbaum (67) noted that over half of the
deaths in the UK occur in NHS hospitals. Furthermore, bearing
witness to these deaths and with the extra COVID related
deaths were bound to have a profound impact on nurses. Al
Thobaity and Alshammari (68) explored the emotional pressures
that nurses underwent through the pandemic, often under-
resourced and carrying out their roles without PPE (Personal
Protective Equipment). According to Purba (69), nurses played
an important role in managing COVID-19 on the frontline and
should be supported to manage health inequalities.

The concept of vicarious trauma (secondary trauma) has
been explored in nursing for a long time and the key impact
from deaths and abuse-related risks accorded even in a research
capacity, Taylor et al. (70). Sabo (71) argues that non-resolved
compassion fatigue/burnout/stress results in vicarious trauma,
and this is a concern. There is a pressing need then for nurses
to develop self-care strategies to cope with the aftermath of the
pandemic, namely, moral distress and injury (72, 73). Nurses are
likely to require explicit support around loss and grief in response
to the pandemic and services need to embrace the prospect and
design services accordingly.

PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

Services need to develop robust Employment Assistance
Programmes to ensure there are therapeutic services in place to
support frontline staﬀ and key workers both with the personal
and professional impact of COVID. The concept of vicarious
trauma is fraught with complications—an area that comes up
commonly in therapy and professionals need to fully support staﬀ
to access therapy to improve patient care and reduce transference
of loss between homework. The use of clinical supervision in
medical professions needs to be utilized more eﬀectively than
ever, and supervisors need to have suﬃcient training not just in
traditional grief but the entangled weave of ambiguous loss and
disenfranchised grief (74).

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services
provide primary care psychological services within mental health
in the UK and would be in a prime position to create impetus
in what is considered as in “vogue” treatments for loss and grief.
Currently, the UK oﬀers services to children with mental health
issues in secondary care only, and the demand is excessive. IAPT
talking therapy services are likely to extend to children soon,

Grief theories have suggested that perhaps an old wound is
reopened, and loss (ambiguous/disenfranchised or otherwise) is
re-triggered. However, when multiple support mechanisms are
available that compound the loss such as socialization, spirituality
and community/family support this is then less prominent. The
oscillation between good and bad days do eventually subside to
become less distressing and frequent. How does and will this
concept help to formulate and treat a post-COVID generation
who have suﬀered months of ambiguous loss and perhaps
actual loss?

Frontline service and need to develop loss and grief based
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions for patients
including ﬂexible access to therapy for key-workers and shift
workers outside of the usual oﬃce hours. The ﬁrst author
developed a well appraised virtual twilight service during the
pandemic for a UK based service, and the uptake from essential
workers was vast.

Moving away from the Kubler and Ross model and capturing
ambiguous loss and disenfranchised grief using trauma and grief
measures much like for any human catastrophe, may be the
answer. The initial minimum data set required in these services to
measure depression and anxiety and trauma is measured through
the Impact of Events scale (IES). The Inventory of Complicated
Grief (ICG) is not a part of IAPT indicators, and there is now a
pressing need for this to be included (36–38). Furthermore, the
identiﬁcation of traumatic loss as part of a PTSD formulation is
the best way to encapsulate the current paradigm and apply it
to existing resources. Therapists at primary and secondary care
levels must be trained to recognize and treat ambivalent loss and
disenfranchised grief at this time of adversity. The target-driven
services may have to adopt this method of delivery where loss
is concerned. Harris posits that training programs that focus on
“curing” and “ﬁxing” individuals are insuﬃcient. The need for
a validating and compassionate response where the clinician is
present with the client during the process rather than outcome-
driven is emphasized.

THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES

IAPT within primary care services use psychological models to
train therapists using a scientiﬁc-practitioner model referred to
as the Boulder model. Nathan (75) states CBT clinicians rarely
use research to further the scientiﬁc-practitioner model and
empirically supported treatments are encouraged. Professionally
we need to plan and ensure workplaces and training educational
establishments are training their workforce to deal with
ambiguous grief and disenfranchised loss. Not having access
to usual activities aﬀects people in many ways, and we have a
generation of post-COVID survivors who will need support to

Ambiguous Loss and Disenfranchised Grief

TABLE 1 | Recommendations—responding to COVID losses.

Recommendations

• Embracing COVID-related ambiguous losses and disenfranchised grief into

therapeutic provision including health and social care support regimes, which
are less outcome orientated and focus on relational support.

• Incorporate the dual processing model into grief and loss training programmes

on COVID-19 aftermaths, not exclusive to death.

• Consider relational trauma-informed grief interventions (including measures)

more readily when assessing the impact of COVID-related losses, particularly
within primary care IAPT services.

• Ensure robust key worker Employment Assistance Programmes to support the

infrastructure and keyworkers affected by COVID-19.

• Emotional dysregulation and reduced hedonic tone should be targeted in

therapeutic interventions across the lifespan.

• Proactively engage with BAME communities who may be less inclined to access

therapies post-COVID, ensuring bi-lingual provision and acknowledge the
enriched cultural afﬁnity with spirituality and religion.

• Additional support for services to engage with BAME communities and recruit.
Train representative clinicians that understand the culture and/or training in
cultural competency.

• Capacity build within mainstream therapeutic services to address their needs,
instead of creating fragmented/ ghettoization of new services or specialized
“ethnic services,” which can create divisions.

overcome this. Embedded within the infrastructure, the needs of
BAME communities who are disproportionately aﬀected must
be foremost in any service delivery model. Harris (1) makes
important recommendations on supporting a person through
loss and “shattered dreams” and avoiding the “get over it
and move on” Western approach to non-death losses. This is
likely to be a lifelong adjustment to loss, and the target-driven
services may have to adopt this method of delivery where loss
is concerned. Harris posits that training programs that focus on
“curing” and “ﬁxing” individuals are ineﬀective. The need for
a validating and compassionate response where the clinician is
present with the client is emphasized.

A transdiagnostic and relationally driven model of assisting
post-COVID generation needs to be developed for those who
experienced loss is key to developing an understanding, and
treatment packages for this population. Humphrey and Zimpfer
(12), using a counseling approach, have presented useful methods
to assess grief using the bio-psycho-social model,
including
spiritual and philosophical reasoning, and duly considers past
“losses” to gain an understanding of current interpretation using
a timeline approach. Losses across the lifespan may be key in
understanding idiosyncratic responses to COVID−19, and this
method of formulation presents intrigue and a focus on what
is unanswered for the individual. The work of Humphrey and
Zimpfer (12) is appraised to include the impact of anticipatory
grief, and traumatic grief because of murder for example.

the facets of

CBT does situate well with grief and loss, in theory, the
use of cognitive meaning is at the forefront (76). In dealing
with complicated grief,
irrational cognitions,
autobiographical memory, and coping strategies are seen as
predictors (77, 78). The work of Mueller (79) in CBT traumatic
is noteworthy. She recognizes the impact of COVID
grief
and embraces this into CBT. Rosner et al. (80) consider the
application of CBT to complicated grief and this again can
be adapted to COVID-19 losses. Working with the patient to
stabilize, explore, and confront the most painful aspects of the
loss are encouraged. Comprehensively, they posit a cognitive
behavioral treatment manual for complicated grief disorder (CG-
CBT) of 25 individual sessions. The longevity of treatment may
be a concern in the implementation where shorter-term CBT
or counseling therapy is considered in primary care services
at least. Shear et al. (25) proposed a 16-session model of
Complicated Grief Therapy (CGT), which may be a preferred
protocol and proved more eﬀective than interpersonal therapy in
the RCT.

The debate between CBT or counseling for grief and/or loss
has long eroded-both have a role and are equipped to deal with
the aftermath of COVID. The evidence base for the therapeutic
approach for COVID related losses is out there; it is now a
case of service providers explicitly adapting and incorporating it
into practice.

CONCLUSION

There is a wealth of evidence that COVID-19 has resulted in
unimaginable losses to the indigenous population, but even
more so to the BAME community. It is anticipated that having
considered the COVID related losses that may be less obvious,
that of ambiguous loss and disenfranchised grief, professionals
and services can respond to this eﬃciently. The need to be
culturally competent due to the disproportionate impact on
BAME communities is pressing. Planning mainstream services
and responses to COVID losses for BAME communities need to
be embedded in service development and not an afterthought
(see Table 1). We now need prognostic therapeutic approaches
to ensure loss and grief interventions are not limited to death
alone and be adaptive to the COVID generation. Essentially, the
therapeutic costs of COVID-19 “loss and grief ” are idiosyncratic,
and therefore the treatment of it remains at the intersection of
therapeutic understanding by service providers and employers.
