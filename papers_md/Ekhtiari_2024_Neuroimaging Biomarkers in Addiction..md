ABSTRACT 
As a neurobiological process, addiction involves pathological patterns of engagement with 
substances and a range of behaviors with a chronic and relapsing course. Neuroimaging 
technologies assess brain activity, structure, physiology, and metabolism at scales ranging 
from  neurotransmitter  receptors  to  large-scale  brain  networks,  providing  unique 
windows into the core neural processes implicated in substance use disorders. Identified 
aberrations  in  the  neural  substrates  of  reward  and  salience  processing,  response 
inhibition,  interoception,  and  executive  functions  with  neuroimaging  can  inform  the 
development of pharmacological, neuromodulatory, and psychotherapeutic interventions 
to modulate the disordered neurobiology.  Based on our systematic search, 409 protocols 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov include the use of one or more neuroimaging paradigms 
as  an  outcome  measure  in  addiction,  with  the  majority  (N=268)  employing  functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), followed by positron emission tomography (PET) 
(N=71), electroencephalography (EEG) (N=50), structural magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) (N=35) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) (N=35). Furthermore, in a 
PubMed  systematic  review,  we  identified  61  meta-analyses  including  30  fMRI,  22 
structural MRI, 8 EEG, 7 PET, and 3 MRS meta-analyses suggesting potential biomarkers 
in addictions. These studies can facilitate the development of a range of biomarkers that 
may  prove  useful  in  the  arsenal  of  addiction  treatments  in  the  coming  years.  There  is

evidence  that  these  markers  of  large-scale  brain  structure  and  activity  may  indicate 
vulnerability  or  separate  disease  subtypes,  predict  response  to  treatment,  or  provide 
objective measures of treatment response or recovery. Neuroimaging biomarkers can also 
suggest novel targets for interventions. Closed or open loop interventions can integrate 
these biomarkers with neuromodulation in real-time or offline to personalize stimulation 
parameters  and  deliver  the  precise  intervention.  This  review  provides  an  overview  of 
neuroimaging  modalities  in  addiction,  potential  neuroimaging  biomarkers,  and  their 
physiologic and clinical relevance.   Future directions and challenges in bringing these 
putative biomarkers from the bench to the bedside are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION 
Substance  use  disorders  (SUDs),  including  alcohol,  cause  significant  and  increasing 
mortality and morbidity worldwide 1,2.  In the United States alone, yearly costs of medical 
care, lost productivity and law enforcement associated with SUDs exceed an estimated 
$700  billion  3.  As  the  designation  suggests,  SUDs  have  conventionally  been  viewed  as 
disorders  of  “substance  use”  4;  but  increasing  evidence  suggests  that  this  harmful 
substance  use  is  both  driven  by  and  contributes  to  pervasive  brain  alterations  which 
underlie profound cognitive and behavioral manifestations broader than substance use 5. 
Since early pneumoencephalography  studies revealed general  brain atrophy in  chronic 
alcohol  users  6,  decades  of  neuroimaging  research  have  increasingly  caused  a  shift 
towards a “brain disease” model of SUDs 7–9. Under this neuroimaging-informed model, 
genetic,  developmental,  social,  and  biological  influences  converge  on  combinations  of 
core neurocognitive aberrations: the mesocorticolimbic reward network is sensitized by 
drugs  of  abuse,  leading  to  excessive  attribution  of  salience  to  drug-associated  stimuli; 
anti-reward  and  stress  systems  across  the  basal  ganglia  and  the  extended  amygdala 
become over-reactive, contributing to withdrawal symptoms and negative-affective states 
which  can  motivate  substance  use;  and  executive  control  networks  centered  around 
prefrontal regions are disrupted, with the degradation of top-down frontal control leading 
to disinhibited substance use 7–11.  

Considering the evidence for neural aberrations in SUDs that can be objectively assessed 
using  neuroimaging  technologies,  there  is  growing  interest  in  using  neuroimaging  to 
inform clinical care and intervention development for SUDs  12,13. Objective measures of 
SUDs are currently limited to measures of psychoactive substances or their metabolites 
in biological samples (National Institutes of Health, 2020a) or reflect toxic effects of use 
14.  These  measures  of  substance  use  are  not  informed  by  the  neurocognitive  processes 
which underlie addiction, and thus have limited use in distinguishing at-risk individuals, 
offering prognostic insight, or informing interventions  8. In this context, neuroimaging 
technologies provide objective measures which could be used as novel “biomarkers” for 
SUDs, enabling the translation of neuroscientific insights to the bedside  15. This echoes 
broader  trends  in  precision  psychiatry  and  efforts  to  develop  and  utilize  so-called 
“biomarkers”  in  psychiatric  practice  and  research  more  extensively  16,17.  Neuroimaging 
biomarkers,  which  can  indicate  specific  aberrations  of  brain  structure  and  function  in 
SUDs,  bring  a  three-fold  advantage:  first,  they  provide  a  direct  window  into  proximal 
potential neurobiological mechanisms of disease and recovery in individuals with SUDs; 
second, they suggest novel treatment targets and provide neurophysiological evidence of 
effectiveness to facilitate intervention development; and third, mechanistically-grounded 
markers  could  be  used  directly  for  clinical  purposes:  to  distinguish  different  sub-
populations  of  substance-using  individuals  and  inform  personalized  interventions  and 
ongoing monitoring tailored for patients with specific brain abnormalities 18–22. 

It is important to note that the “brain disease” model is not the only account of addiction 
etiology. For example, alternative explanations posit that addiction is a disease of choice 
and may be caused by a lack of alternative reinforcers 23, some contest whether addiction 
is  a  “disease”  24,  and  others  simply  argue  that  neurobiological  explanations  cannot  be 
privileged  over  others  25.  Moreover,  the  “brain  disease”  model  has  faced  criticism  on

scientific, philosophical, and political grounds 26–28; and while it is generally agreed that 
alcohol and substance use disorders involve brain  changes  22,29, some have argued that 
the  current  body  of  neurobiological  evidence  may  not  be  sufficient  to  conclude  that 
neurobiological  dysfunctions  are  specific  and  primary  causes  of  addiction  broadly  30. 
However, while we would argue that the addiction neuroimaging literature to date both 
aligns  with  a  “brain  disease”  model  of  addiction  and  supports  the  development  of 
neuroimaging biomarkers, adherence to the former is not strictly necessary for the latter: 
According to the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group, a biomarker is simply “a defined 
characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic 
processes, or biological responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic 
interventions”  31.  Regardless  of  whether  addictive  disorders  are  primarily  caused  or 
sustained  by  neurological  dysfunction,  neuroimaging  biomarkers  of  aberrant  brain 
structure or function associated with specific mechanisms of addiction and recovery could 
illuminate neural pathology, facilitate intervention development, and guide clinical care. 
A pertinent example is hypertension: the fact that the disease can be caused in large part 
by social and environmental factors does not diminish the importance of blood pressure 
as a biomarker to diagnose and monitor hypertension and develop interventions 32,33. 

To lay the conceptual framework for a discussion of potential neuroimaging biomarkers 
in SUDs, we will provide an overview of the current status of neuroimaging paradigms in 
translational addiction neuroscience, informed by a systematic review of neuroimaging 
outcome measures in 409 protocols registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between its inception 
and  November  17,  2021.  Together,  the  409  protocols  have  utilized  479  imaging 
modalities, and 688 neuroimaging outcome measures and provide a broad estimate of 
the clinically-relevant uses of neuroimaging in addiction neuroscience. We supplement 
this discussion with another systematic review of 61 meta-analyses between inception and 
November 10, 2023 of neuroimaging biomarkers in SUDs, and highlight biomarkers that 
have replicated in meta-analyses across multiple contexts and diagnoses. We then discuss 
different neuroimaging biomarkers which may be developed for SUDs based on taxonomy 
developed by the FDA-NIH Biomarker Working Group  34 and highlight challenges and 
future  directions  to  provide  clinicians  and  researchers  with  an  understanding  of 
opportunities and challenges in neuroimaging biomarker research. 

RESULTS 

The  present  manuscript  is  informed  by  two  systematic  reviews.  The  first  covered  SUD 
clinical research protocols which include neuroimaging outcome measures, obtained by 
querying  the  ClinicalTrials.gov  repository  between  inception  and  November  17,  2021 
(Supplementary Figure 1a). This systematic review yielded a final result of 409 protocols. 
The second systematic review was conducted on PubMed, focusing on meta-analyses of 
neuroimaging studies of SUDs and finding 61 meta-analyses from which 83 meta-analytic 
findings  were  extracted  (Supplementary  Figure  1b).  In  this  paper,  while  we  seek  to 
structure  the  discussion  around  replicated  findings  that  have  held  across  SUDs,  some 
findings pertain only to specific SUDs, in which cases the particular SUD is highlighted. 
It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  neuroimaging  measures  and  findings  in  included 
protocols  and  meta-analyses  do  not  constitute  validated  biomarkers:  Any  objective

measure  needs  to  undergo  an  extensive  validation  process  to  qualify  as  an  actual 
biomarker of disease or recovery, which is not the case for any of the measures we discuss. 
Essential validation steps are discussed in the future directions. The systematic reviews 
serve  to  highlight  replicated  neuroimaging  findings  in  SUDs  and  demonstrate  the 
different  exploratory  purposes  for  which  neuroimaging  modalities  are  already  used  in 
clinical research. These purposes or “contexts of use” are grouped under corresponding 
categories  of  biomarkers  to  outline  what  measures  might  come  to  serve  as  actual 
neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDs, and motivate a discussion of challenges which need 
to be surmounted in the process. 

NEUROIMAGING MODALITIES IN ADDICTION MEDICINE 
Interest in clinical uses of neuroimaging paradigms for virtually all SUDs has increased 
over time, with 87.3% of the protocols in our systematic review starting in 2010 or later. 
This  is  particularly  the  case  with  alcohol  (N=139)  and  nicotine  use  disorders,  but  a 
growing number of protocols are using neuroimaging as an outcome measure for cocaine 
(N=44), cannabis (N=36), and opioid use disorder (N=31) (Figure 1a and Supplementray 
Figure 2). The growing interest in using neuroimaging paradigms has also been reflected 
in the conducted meta-analyses (Note that three  of the studies are mega-analyses rather 
than meta-analyses, though we use the term meta-analysis to refer to these for simplicity). 
with all of them conducted after 2011 and more than half of them (N=31 out of 61) in the 
last  3  years.  Most  of  the  meta-analyses  were  conducted  on  multi  substances  (N=28)  
followed by analyzing studies focusing solely on alcohol (N=13) (Supplementary Figure 
3).    With  some  exceptions,  neuroimaging  paradigms  in  addiction  neuroscience  can  be 
broadly  categorized  into  “structural”  imaging  techniques  which  probe  brain  structure 
statically, “functional” paradigms which evaluate changes in a signal associated with brain 
function during the scan, and “molecular” paradigms which assess the static or changing 
distribution  of  important  molecules/metabolites  within  the  brain.  These  various 
paradigms are converging on a multi-scale perspective into brain changes in SUDs and 
may be used to develop clinically-relevant biomarkers 35,36. 

Brain Structure: Gray and White Matter 

While a few studies have utilized CT scans to interrogate brain structure alterations in 
SUDs  37,  arguably  the  most  popular  structural  neuroimaging  paradigm  in  addiction 
neuroscience is structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), used by 35 protocols in 
our trials database as the only neuroimaging paradigm and by 27 protocols in conjunction 
with another paradigm (Figure 1b). Among the meta-analytic findings reviewed, 22 out of 
83 were aberrations observed with structural MRI. Using MRI, algorithms such as voxel-
based morphometry can isolate and quantify gray matter 38, and meta-analyses of these 
and  similar techniques have revealed wide-spread losses of gray matter across cortical 
and  subcortical  regions  across  a  number  of  different  SUDs  39–44, though  there  is  some 
evidence  that  these  may  recover  with  abstinence  45.  “Mega-analyses”  of  MRI  data 
collected from thousands of individuals with a variety of SUD types have also revealed an 
overall loss of gray matter, particularly in the insula and prefrontal and parietal cortices,

and  suggest  that  use  severity  may  be  correlated  with  lower  amygdala  and  nucleus 
accumbens  volume,  particularly  in  alcohol  use  disorder  46.  Simultaneously,  studies  of 
white  matter  structure  with  diffusion-weighted  imaging  have  broadly  revealed  white 
matter  degeneration  in  commissural  tracts,  the  internal  capsule,  and  corpus  callosum 
across  several  SUDs  39,47–49.  Observed  structural  changes  in  the  gray  and  white  matter 
might explain both deficits in higher-order cognitive processes and bottom-up processes 
in SUDs, with striking alterations in both frontal, parietal, and insular cortical regions 
involved  in  interoception,  attention,  and  executive  control  and  in  the  amygdala  and 
nucleus accumbens which subtend bottom-up reward and affective processing 46,50.

Brain Function: Hemodynamics and Electrophysiology 

While  structural  neuroimaging  paradigms  are  useful,  the  brain  is  engaged  in  constant 
activity during task performance and even idleness or sleep 51 and alterations in these rich 
neural  dynamics  underlie  the  cognitive-behavioral  profiles  typical  of  SUDs  52.  This 
necessitates  the  use  of  “functional”  neuroimaging  paradigms  that  can  measure  brain 
activity either during the performance of various tasks (“task-based” imaging, 342 out of 
688 instances in protocol database and 30 out of 83 in our meta-analysis database) or 
during rest (“resting-state” imaging, 217 instances in our protocol database and 4 in our 
meta-analysis  database)  53.  For  example,  “cue-reactivity  paradigms”  involve  the 
presentation of stimuli associated with substances, such as pictures, scents or tastes, to 
assess neural reactivity and sensitization to these cues 54, and are used by 130 protocols 
in our protocol database (and 10 meta-analytic findings in SUDs). Other tasks can be used 
to  probe  other  aspects  of  reward  processing  (42  instances  across  protocols,  6  meta-
analytic  findings),  response  inhibition  (36  instances  across  protocols,  3  meta-analytic 
findings) and decision making (22 instances across protocols, 1 meta-analytic finding), all 
processes whose neural circuitry is impacted in SUDs 11,55 (Figure 2 and 3).

Further,  39  meta-analytic  findings  across  neuroimaging  SUD  studies  are  from  meta-
analyses which include fMRI studies, alone (30 findings) or in combination with other 
modalities (Figure 3). There is extensive task-based fMRI evidence of disruption during 
reward-processing  60,  and  drug  cue  exposure  results  in  a  cascading  hyperactivation  of 
limbic  circuits  which  subtend  valuation  and  salience  processing  and  disruption  of 
prefrontal control, which can end in drug use 55,61. On the other hand, resting-state fMRI 
studies have revealed that SUDs are associated with weaker connections in the executive 
control network and stronger couplings within and between salience, reward, and “default 
mode” networks, suggesting that this might account for impaired response inhibition and 
the abnormal salience of drugs  11,62. Other hemodynamic paradigms have converged on 
similar  findings,  with  aberrant  function  and  perfusion  in  the  middle  frontal  and 
orbitofrontal cortices, among others, observed in SUDs 57,63

with 74 instances in our protocol database (and 8 findings in our meta-analysis database) 
compared  to  a  single  protocol  with  MEG.  Event-related  potentials  elicited  during  task 
performance  are  usually  split  into  components  associated  with  underlying  cognitive 
processes. For example, There is evidence that the P300 component of ERPs elicited by 
drug cues may be associated with reward valuation and the late positive potential with 
drug  use  motivation  in  individuals  with  SUDs,  while  the  error-related  negativity  and 
feedback-related  negativity  components  are  associated  with  cognitive  control  and  self-
regulation 66,67. Another approach is to decompose the recorded EEG or MEG signal into 
specific  “bands”  with  different  frequencies,  which  has  revealed  decreases  in  EEG  beta 
band  power  in  opioid  and  alcohol  use  disorders  68.  As  with  fMRI  and  fNIRS,  EEG 
recordings  also  revealed  network-level  changes  in  individuals  with  SUDs:  Examples 
include disruptions in the communication of the parietal lobe with other brain regions 69 
and reductions in global integration and locally specialized connectivity 70. 

Brain Biochemistry: Molecular Systems 

On a molecular level, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon-emission 
computed  tomography  (SPECT)  use  radiotracers  with  specific  patterns  of  distribution 
across the tissue. Psychiatric SPECT and PET imaging increasingly use complex ligands 
known  to  preferentially  bind  to  molecules  of  interest  to  probe  both  the  density  and 
binding  potential  of  a  certain  neurotransmitter  system  across  the  brain,  and  dynamic 
changes  in  neurotransmission  induced  by  a  pharmacological  agent  or  during  cognitive 
and behavioral tasks 71. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a different approach 
to  investigating  molecular  concentrations  across  the  brain,  using  magnetic  resonance 
rather  than  ionizing  radiation  to  assess  relative  levels  of  different metabolites,  such  as 
choline  and  N-acetylaspartate,  and  neurotransmitters,  such  as  glutamate,  GABA,  and 
glutamine 72.

All  three  modalities  are  used  in  our  protocol  database  as  outcome  measures,  with  70 
instances of PET, 7 instances of SPECT, and 40 instances of MRS (Figure 2), and 16 meta-
analytic  PET/SPECT  findings  (7  findings  from  meta-analyses  of  studies  using  only 
PET/SPECT,  9  in  combination  with  fMRI  studies).  PET  and  SPECT  studies  have 
demonstrated  that  dopamine  transporter  and  D2  dopamine  receptor  availability  are 
consistently  downregulated  in  SUDs,  especially  D2  receptors  in  the  striatum  whose 
downregulation  is  associated  with  compulsive  drug  use  73.  This  has  been  extensively 
corroborated  in  stimulant  use  disorders,  with  several  recent  meta-analyses  74,75.  These 
observations and further aberrations  in  dopamine  synthesis  and release are consistent 
with  dysfunctional  dopaminergic  neuroadaptations  in  the  reward  network  and 
accompany changes in other neurotransmitter systems implicated in the neuro-cognitive 
abnormalities observed in SUDs, such as serotonergic disruptions potentially related to 
affective deregulation and opioidergic down-regulation which may explain tolerance and 
dependence  76–78.  At  the  same  time,  meta-analyses  of  MRS  studies  have  revealed 
decreased  N-acetylaspartate  levels  across  frontal  and  cingulate  regions,  suggesting 
decreased  neuronal  and  axonal  viability  79,80;  and  others  have  reported  aberrations  in 
glutamate and GABA levels in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia which correlate with 
disease  severity  and  cognitive  function  across  SUDS  81,82.  These  findings  suggest  that 
neurotransmitter abnormalities may account for some neuro-cognitive abnormalities in 
attention and executive function observed in SUDs. 

NEUROIMAGING BIOMARKERS IN ADDICTION  
Given the observation of brain abnormalities across different domains in SUDs, there are 
ongoing efforts to utilize these  brain  aberrations as biomarkers for specific contexts of 
use.  The  neuroimaging  technologies  discussed  above  have  distinct  advantages  and 
disadvantages, and thus each may be better suited for use in certain contexts and/or for 
different  SUDs.  The  systematic  review  of  the  registered  protocols  discussed  above 
expectedly identified mostly neuroimaging biomarkers used to measure the effect of an 
intervention  in  a  trial.  However,  neuroimaging  biomarkers  could  go  beyond  treatment 
response  assessment.  The  FDA-NIH  Biomarker  Working  Group  has  formally  defined 
distinct biomarker types which correspond to different stages of addiction, recovery, and 
clinical intervention 34: In the context of SUDs, “susceptibility” biomarkers indicate the 
risk  that  individuals  develop  a    SUD  and  “diagnostic”  biomarkers  can  distinguish 
individuals with SUDs from recreational users or between clinically relevant subtypes of 
SUDs. For individuals with an established SUD diagnosis, “prognostic” biomarkers can 
predict  the  future  progression  of  patients  towards  relapse  versus  remission  and 
“monitoring” biomarkers can be measured over time to assess changes. 

When  developing  or  implementing  a  clinical  intervention  for  SUDs,  “predictive” 
biomarkers can predict the clinical impact of an intervention, and “safety” biomarkers can 
be measured to assess the safety of an intervention or novel substance; while “response” 
biomarkers  reflect  an  individual’s  response  to  an  intervention  and,  under  certain 
conditions, can be used as “surrogate endpoints”: biomarkers which can demonstrate the 
likely clinical effectiveness of an intervention before actual clinical outcomes develop 83,84. 
A schematic of the different stages of SUDs and intervention is presented in Figure 4. It 
is important to note that a single neuroimaging measure may conceivably serve multiple

biomarker roles in different contexts: as an example, higher baseline ventral striatal fMRI 
drug cue-reactivity can distinguish relapsing individuals with stimulant use disorder from 
non-relapsing individuals 3 months after the scan (prognosis) 85 and predict the clinical 
response  of  individuals  with  alcohol  use  disorder  to  naltrexone  (prediction)  86.  At  the 
same time, striatal cue-reactivity in individuals with alcohol use disorder can be reduced 
through  treatment  (response)  87.  Such  converging  evidence  can  support  the  clinical 
validity of a biomarker. 

 Figure 4: Schematic representation of stages in substance use and SUDs and their 
therapeutic  interventions  and  corresponding  biomarker  types.  Susceptibility 
biomarkers  can  predict  transition  to  substance  use  or  disorder,  prognostic  biomarkers  can 
predict the future progression of the disorder, diagnostic biomarkers can distinguish clinically-
relevant populations, monitoring biomarkers facilitate ongoing information about the course of 
the  disorder  with  or  without  intervention,  predictive  biomarkers  can  predict  treatment 
response,  response  biomarkers  can  reflect  the  physiological  impact  of  an  intervention  and 
potentially be used as surrogate endpoints in lieu of clinical outcomes, and safety biomarkers 
can  help  assess  the  potential  hazards  of  various  substances  used  in  clinical  or  non-clinical 
settings. 

Based on an assessment of the structure of the reviewed protocols, the 409 protocols have 
collectively  used  510  neuroimaging  measures  as  putative  SUD  biomarkers.  These  510 
putative  neuroimaging-based  biomarkers  are  broken  down  based  on  biomarker  type, 
substances, and neuroimaging modalities in Figure 5. Based on the systematic review of 
meta-analyses, several of these markers have also been suggested across several SUDs or 
contexts of use in meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies. Such suggested findings were 
observed  in  55  meta-analyses  in  our  database  and  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The 
following sections review these biomarker types in greater detail.

Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Assessment  

The most straightforward application of neuroimaging biomarkers for SUDs would be for 
assessment purposes, since any structural, functional, or biochemical brain differences 
between  individuals  with  and  without  SUDs  could,  hypothetically,  be  used  to  at  least 
support  the  existence  of  disease.  Accordingly.  we  identified  110  putative  assessment 
neuroimaging  markers  in  our  systematic  review  of  clinical  research  protocols  and  69 
across meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies in SUDs. However, mere diagnosis may not 
be  the  best  use  of  neuroimaging  biomarkers.  Currently,  diagnoses  rely  ultimately  on 
relatively 
lead  to 
heterogeneous patient populations, and moreover diagnoses rely ultimately on relatively 
inexpensive clinical interviews and the added benefit of biomarkers is unclear  88. More 
promising may be the use of neuroimaging biomarkers for clinically-relevant subtyping, 
prognosis, and patient monitoring. 

interviews,  but  these  diagnostic  criteria

Biomarkers for diagnosis, subtyping, and susceptibility assessment: 

Conceivably useful assessment neuroimaging biomarkers for SUDs fall into a few contexts 
of  use.  One  would  be  “diagnostic”  biomarkers  which  differentiate  healthy  and 
disordered  substance  use  rather  than  individuals  with  SUD  and  non-drug  users,  given 
that distinguishing dependent and recreational use purely on the basis of self-report and 
drug  use  quantity  is  difficult  89.  We  identified  88  instances  of  potential  diagnostic 
biomarkers  across  protocols  (Figure  5)  and  68  across  meta-analyses  (Figure  3)  in  our 
systematic  review  databases.  Several  neuroimaging  biomarkers  may  help  distinguish 
dependent and non-dependent users. For example, dependent compared to light alcohol 
use  may  be  associated  with  greater  alcohol-cue-induced  BOLD  signal  in  the  dorsal 
striatum but lower signal in the ventral striatum  90 and dependent cannabis users have 
lower OFC volume compared to recreational users 91. Such diagnostic biomarkers may be 
especially relevant in the staging of SUDs, given the recently proposed category of “pre-
addiction” 92. Another use of diagnostic biomarkers could be to distinguish SUD patients 
with  the  same  diagnosis,  but  different  underlying  neuro-cognitive  pathology.  For 
example, heavy alcohol drinkers who drink primarily for “relief” from negative affect have 
greater alcohol-cue-induced BOLD signal in the dorsal striatum as compared to “reward” 
drinkers 93. 

Another useful class of  assessment biomarkers would be markers of “susceptibility”, 
biomarkers which predict the development of SUD in at-risk individuals in the absence 
of diagnosable disease. Only two of the registered protocols and one meta-analysis had 
putative  susceptibility  biomarkers,  which  require  studying  healthy  participants  for  the 
development of SUDs. Much of the previous SUD-susceptibility neuroimaging research 
has been conducted in adolescents, who are particularly at risk of initiating substance use 
and transitioning to SUDs due to reward deficits associated with the striatal dopaminergic 
reorganization  and  the  faster  development  of  limbic  emotion  and  reward  systems 
compared to the prefrontal control circuitry 94. Consistent with this theory, task-related 
fMRI investigations have shown that dorsal striatal hyper-activation during reward tasks

may  be  a  marker  of  substance  use  vulnerability  and  is  linked  with  co-existing 
externalizing  psychopathology,  and  stronger  responses  of  the  reward-related  nucleus 
accumbens  and  orbitofrontal  regions  to  alcohol  cues  can  distinguish  individuals  who 
transition to heavy drinking 95,96. Moreover, response inhibition fMRI studies have shown 
that  blunted  frontoparietal  activity  during  inhibition  and  hyperactivation  during 
inhibition failures predict the initiation of substance use 97. Structural MRI studies have 
converged on similar findings: Both lower volumes and lower white matter integrity in 
fronto-limbic  regions  involved  in  reward  processing  and  decision-making  may  be 
markers of susceptibility to substance use initiation and the development of SUDs 98.

various substance use disorders (SUDs) and neuroimaging modalities. Biomarker 
types are divided between the substance of interest and neuroimaging modalities used in the

biomarker type.  Some protocols did not report enough details for neuroimaging modalities in 
a way that fit any biomarker’s definition. Data is collected from ClinicalTrials.gov on November

Biomarkers for prognosis and monitoring: 

With  the  rising  number  and  larger  sample  sizes  of  studies  with  prospective  and 
longitudinal  designs,  it  has  become  possible  to  investigate  relationships  between 
neuroimaging parameters and subsequent clinical trajectories, enabling the development 
of  “prognostic”  biomarkers,  with  20  examples  in  our  systematic  review  of  study 
protocols. An important clinical use of these biomarkers would be to predict relapse in

abstinent individuals more accurately than is possible using self-report or behavioral task 
performance  alone.  Task-based  fMRI  studies  have  shown  that  individuals  who  require 
high  neural  activation  for  response  inhibition  are  more  prone  to  relapse,  even  with 
normative  behavioral  task  performance  97,  and  baseline  nucleus  accumbens  drug  cue-
reactivity may predict relapse with an accuracy outperforming conventional measures 85. 
Resting-state fMRI has further demonstrated that the weaker inter-regional synchrony in 
the executive control network may account for poorer response inhibition and can predict 
relapse 99. 

Neuroimaging  biomarkers  that  are  measured  over  time  can  also  be  used  as 
“monitoring”  biomarkers,  offering  insights  into  the  development  and  abatement  of 
neuro-cognitive  pathology  to  complement  the  clinical  picture.    These  biomarkers  are 
difficult to develop since they require repeated neuroimaging measurements and a model 
of their correspondence with clinical states and clinically-relevant phenotypes over time. 
None of the protocols or meta-analyses in our databases had the requisite structure to 
contribute to the development of potential monitoring biomarkers. Nevertheless, much 
of  the  research  on  using  neuroimaging  outcomes  for  putative  monitoring  markers  has 
focused on neurological recovery during abstinence: longitudinal studies have shown that 
both gray and white matter degeneration in the frontal cortices of individuals with SUD 
can  recover  after  abstinence  100,101,  and  in  PET  and  SPECT  studies  striatal  dopamine 
transporters  downregulated  in  methamphetamine  use  disorder  can  recover  during 
abstinence  102,103.  A  striking  finding  is  the  observation  that  individuals  with  SUD 
experience an “incubation” and accumulation of drug craving following abstinence which 
may predispose them to relapse. Another study has revealed that this “craving incubation” 
is reflected in the amplitude of the late positive potential, a marker of attention bias to 
drug cues which follows an expected parabolic trajectory during abstinence and a feature 
that would be missed by relying purely on self-report measures 67.

Perhaps even more important than diagnostic, prognostic or susceptibility assessment of 
SUDs  would  be  the  use  of  neuroimaging  biomarkers  in  interventional  contexts;  for 
example, 
their 
neurophysiological  impact  in  clinical  trials  or  psychiatric  practice  or  predict  their 
outcomes  and 
intervention  selection.  Furthermore, 
neuroimaging biomarkers of cognitive processes such as cue-induced craving and reward 
processing  can  directly  become  targets  for  intervention.  According  to  our  systematic 
review of ClinicalTrials.gov protocols, several multi-scale brain aberrations identified in 
observational  studies  of  SUDs  are  under  investigation  as  putative  interventional 
biomarkers.  Some  of  these  are  illustrated  in  Figure  6.  Protocols  with  potential 
interventional biomarkers constitute a majority of the protocol database and contain 400 
putative biomarkers. this is unsurprising since we reviewed ClinicalTrials.gov protocols, 
which mostly consist of interventional studies. Across meta-analyses however, there were 
only 14 examples of findings relevant to interventional contexts of use.

Figure 6: Multi-scale brain aberrations as putative neuroimaging biomarkers in 
trials for substance use disorders (SUDs). Seven examples of brain aberrations identified 
in  SUDs  (yellow  boxes)  that  have  been  investigated  as  putative  “response”  or  “predictive” 
biomarkers  or  intervention  targets  in  protocols  registered  in  ClinicalTrials.gov  (light  blue 
boxes).  The  relevant  literature  is  referenced  in  supplementary  table  2.  FC:  Functional 
Connectivity; FDCR: fMRI Drug Cue Reactivity; PFC: Prefrontal Cortex. tDCS: Transcranial 
Direct Current Stimulation.  

Biomarkers of intervention response and safety: 

The  effectiveness  of  interventions  for  SUDs  is  generally  assessed  by  measuring  their 
impact on drug use, which provides little information about neuro-cognitive recovery 8. A 
paradigmatic  group  of  interventional  biomarkers  is  “response”  biomarkers.  In  early 
phases  of  intervention  development,  “pharmacodynamic”  response  biomarkers  can 
indicate  the  presence  of  a  treatment  effect  on  neuroimaging  biomarkers  of  recognized 
importance in SUDs and provide some estimate of the intensity and location of this effect. 
In  our  systematic  reviews,  365  neuroimaging  outcomes  were  used  as  putative 
response/pharmacodynamic biomarkers across protocols and 13 neuroimaging response 
markers  were  discovered  across  meta-analyses.  Response  biomarkers  can  be  used  to 
screen candidate therapeutics and prioritize those with plausible effectiveness, as in the 
“Fast-Fail”  initiative  of  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health104.  In  this  context, 
research  could  be  focused  on  therapies  that  engage  brain  substrates  of  SUDs.  For 
example, pharmaco-fMRI studies have shown that baclofen can dampen increased drug 
cue-reactivity  105,106, and PET imaging can directly measure the dose-dependent impact 
of various therapies on neurotransmitter systems 107. 

A  narrower  and  more  impactful  subclass  of  “response”  biomarkers  are  “surrogate 
endpoints”.  These  neuroimaging  measures  would  not  only  correlate  with  the  clinical

effect of a therapy but causally lie along the physiological route between an intervention 
and  its  clinical  effect  in  SUDs.  A  paradigmatic  example  of  a  surrogate  endpoint  in 
medicine is blood pressure, widely accepted as an outcome measure in clinical trials since 
it is known that anti-hypertensive medications offer clinical benefit through lowering high 
blood pressure, even though blood pressure in itself is not a clinical endpoint 108. Rigorous 
clinical  trials  might  be  able  to  establish  that  the  impact  of  therapies  such  as  dlPFC 
stimulation  on  craving  is  mediated  through  the  modulation  of  cue-related  neural 
activation and connectivity, leading to the development of surrogate endpoints 63. 

Biomarkers assessed over time can be used as “monitoring” biomarkers in the context 
of  interventions  as  well,  establishing  links  between  a  neuroimaging  biomarker  and 
clinical response. For example, multiple imaging rounds in a trial of naltrexone for alcohol 
use disorder showed that naltrexone lowers ventral striatal fMRI drug cue-reactivity from 
baseline and greater reduction is associated with a larger clinical response 109, and event-
related potentials recorded with EEG or MEG can be assessed during and after treatment 
to demonstrate the normalization of ERP components associated with attention bias or 
error-processing 66.  

While  we  classified  markers  which  show  the  neural  impact  of  novel  compounds  as 
“response”  biomarkers  since  their  protocols  did  not  explicitly  use  them  to  indicate  the 
safety of interventions, neuroimaging biomarkers could also be used to gauge the safety 
and toxicity of various compounds of interest in addiction medicine. One example would 
be  the  use  of  neuroimaging  to  inform  ongoing  discussions  on  the  safety  of  electronic 
cigarette products, where fMRI has been used to demonstrate that e-cigarette smoking 
may  immediately  induce  activation  across  sensorimotor  areas  110  and  sweet-tasting 
products may synergize with nicotine content to increase the influence of e-cigarettes on 
nucleus  accumbens  reactivity  111.  Another  pertinent  use-case  is  assessing  the  abuse 
potential  of  analgesic  medications.  Many  such  therapeutics,  and  in  particular  opioid 
medications, may lead to addictive substance use in some individuals, and neuroimaging 
biomarkers of safety may serve as early warning signs both during drug development and 
treatment  112.  Neuroimaging  safety  biomarkers  may  also  be  useful  to  assess  the  brain 
impact  of  alcohol  and  opioid  medications  in  individuals  with  genetic  susceptibility  to 
addiction,  such  as  those  with  certain  variants  of  dopamine  and  opioid  receptor  genes 
113,114. 

Biomarkers for treatment targeting and implementation: 

Data  on  the  effectiveness  of  current  interventions  for  SUDs  remains  inconsistent, 
necessitating  the  development  of  more  consistently  efficacious  interventions  and 
subtyping individuals with SUDs to develop personalized treatment protocols/plans  115. 
Beyond  providing  information  about  the  neural  impact  of  treatment,  neuroimaging 
biomarkers  could  enable  individually  targeted  SUD  treatment  by  reflecting  a  patient’s 
baseline  or  dynamically  changing  neural  state.  An  example  of  this  is  targeting  brain 
stimulation  at  important  hubs  of  aberrant  networks  in  each  patient  since  electric  and 
magnetic  neuromodulation  have  connectivity-dependent  effects  (Siddiqi  et  al.,  2019;

Weigand et al., 2018) and it has been proposed that both structural and functional MRI 
can be used to optimally target the stimulation the inhibitory frontoparietal network in 
patients with SUD  116. The importance of targeting specific networks for intervention is 
further supported by recent observational evidence that brain lesions which affect areas 
functionally  connected  to  cingulate,  prefrontal,  insular,  and  temporal  regions  can 
consistently induce remission in individuals with SUD  117. In addition to using baseline 
neuroimaging,  more  sophisticated  technologies  are  paving  the  way  for  concurrent 
neuromodulation and brain imaging. These include TMS or tDCS with simultaneous EEG, 
MEG, fNIRS, or fMRI 118–122. These methods provide immediate readouts of the effects of 
neuromodulation  on  network  activity  and  can  be  used  to  develop  “closed-loop” 
stimulation systems where neuromodulation is dynamically adjusted for optimal impact 
123. Lastly, EEG and fMRI biomarkers that are correlated with undesirable SUD-related 
symptoms such as craving have been successfully used in neurofeedback training, where 
patients with tobacco or alcohol use disorder learned to attenuate these signals based on 
dynamic feedback 124,125. 

Biomarkers to predict treatment effect: 

The  final  potential  use  case  of  biomarkers  in  an  interventional  context  would  be  to 
predict the impact of therapies.  We identified  35 neuroimaging outcome measures in 
our systematic review of protocols that serve as putative predictive biomarkers, though 
only one relevant marker was identified in the systematic review of meta-analyses. As the 
variability in the effectiveness of interventions for SUDs may be, in part, due to distinct 
baseline  neurocognitive  states,  neuroimaging  biomarkers  could  help  the  selection  of 
interventions most likely to ameliorate the underlying pathology in each patient 20,126. For 
example, among individuals with AUD, a reduction of fMRI drug cue-reactivity in both 
the left putamen and the right ventral striatum can predict the effectiveness of naltrexone 
109,127; for individuals with cocaine use disorder, greater persistence of the cue-triggered 
brain response across the cue task predicts poor drug use outcome 128. Machine-learning 
algorithms  using  task-related  and  resting-state  fMRI  data  have  been  able  to  predict 
treatment  response  and  completion  in  individuals  with  stimulant  and  heroin  use 
disorders  129,130.  Structural  connectivity  biomarkers  may  also  have  predictive  value: 
reduced structural connectivity between the right anterior insula and nucleus accumbens 
at  baseline  can  predict  relapse  to  stimulant  use  up  to  six  months  after  residential 
treatment 131.  

Arguably, a robust neuroimaging biomarker of SUDs would be valid in several different 
contexts of use. Further, if the biomarker reflects physiological changes which are broadly 
important in the etiogenesis of SUDs and in recovery, such physiological changes would 
likely be detectable with different neuroimaging modalities and in different substance use 
disorders.  Several  neuroimaging  markers  with  converging  supporting  evidence  across 
meta-analyses  have  been  discussed  in  Table  1,  but  a  particularly  promising  set  of 
examples are those which reflect the structure, function and connections of the striatum.

evidence  supporting  the  use  of  striatal  markers  across  neuroimaging  modalities  and 
contexts of use.  

Textbox  1:  Striatal  neuroimaging  biomarkers  in  SUDs.  A  discussion  of  the 
potential of neuroimaging markers of striatal function and structure across different 
contexts of use in SUDs and important next steps. 

There  is  overwhelming  evidence  that  the  striatum  is  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
SUDs. Meta-analyses have shown striatal atrophy across substance use disorders 132,133, 
impaired dopamine neurotransmission 74,75, and striatal dysfunction across substances 
and  task  paradigms,  particularly  in  reward-related  tasks  and  those  which  induce 
craving  60,134–138.  Based  on  these  observations  and  studies  in  animal  models,  major 
neuroscientific theories of addiction feature striatal dysfunction as a central cause of 
the  aberrant  reward  processing,  impulsivity,  and  incentive  sensitization  which  drive 
SUDs 7,139. 

This body of literature, paired with relevant findings across contexts of use, provides an 
extensive foundation to support the clinical validation of neuroimaging biomarkers of 
striatal structure and function. As an example, striatal fMRI drug cue reactivity might 
indicate  individual  susceptibility  to  alcohol  use  disorder  140,  diagnostically  93  and 
prognostically  85  demarcate  clinically  relevant  subtypes  of  disease,  predict  treatment 
response  86,  and  reflect  treatment  response  141  or  monitor  it  across  time  109.  An 
important  next  step  would  be  investigating  analyaitcal  properties  of  striatal 
neuroimaging biomarkers, data on which is sparse. There is evidence supporting the 
longitudinal stability of striatal fMRI drug cue reactivity 142,143. There is also evidence 
for reasonable test-retest reliability of striatal PET imaging 144,145 and morphometry and 
cortico-straiatal integrity measures 146 in non-SUD samples; but these should be further 
replicated across larger samples with different SUDs. 

Further, there is little formal guidance and consensus on best methodological practices 
for striatal neuroimaging, which may differ from those for cortical neuroimaging. For 
example, a 32-channel receiving coil may be more sensitive to cortical signals than an 
8-channel coil but less sensitive to subcortical activations 147, and fMRI with higher field 
strengths seems to be more crucial for imaging the striatum than the cortex  148. Any 
striatal  neuroimaging  biomarker  would  need  to  be  precisely  specified,  with 
methodological parameters, the target population, and standard operating procedures 
selected with respect to its context of use. This is since measures of striatal structure, 
function  and  connections  are  impacted  by  image  acquisition  parameters  149  and 
processing  and  reconstruction  pipelines  150,  behavioral  task  design  151,  operating 
parameters such as time of day  152, and participant characteristics such as sex  153 and 
psychiatric  comorbidity  107.  Further  research  is  required  to  clarify  how  these  factors 
impact  the  clinical  validity  and  analytical  properties  of  striatal  markers  in  different 
contexts of use and guide biomarker specification. 

Lastly,  a  putative  striatal  biomarker  needs  to  be  cost-effective,  but  there  has  been 
virtually no cost-benefit analysis of any striatal neuroimaging biomarker. While most 
of the cited literature supporting the clinical use of striatal neuroimaging in SUDs has 
used functional neuroimaging paradigms, it is difficult to assess striatal function with

relatively inexpensive neuroimaging modalities such as EEG and structural scans are 
both  more  affordable  and  already  in  widespread  clinical  use.  Functional  striatal 
biomarkers would likely be most cost-effective in clinical research settings, for example 
in  facilitating  the  design  of  novel  interventions  and  candidate  screening  in  drug 
development 104. 

CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
Despite decades of research highlighting the potential of neuroimaging technologies for 
the  development  and  validation  of  biomarkers  of  SUDs  and  the  proposal  of  several 
promising  biomarkers  in  recent  years  13,154,155,  critics  have  noted  that  substantial 
investment  in  biomedical  addiction  research  has  not  yet  led  to  the  development  of 
biomarkers with substantial clinical utility 156. There is growing awareness of the myriad 
challenges ahead of pushing neuroimaging  biomarkers through the “translational gap” 
and  into  drug  development  and  clinical  practice  54,157,  and  we  dedicate  the  following 
sections  to  a  reflection  on  these  scientific,  technical,  and  regulatory  challenges  and 
solutions  which  we  believe  are  critical  in  developing  clinically-relevant  biomarkers  of 
SUDs.  

Regulatory validation of neuroimaging biomarkers 

The  use  of  neuroimaging  biomarkers  in  clinical  and  drug  development  contexts  is 
contingent on approval by relevant regulatory bodies. These include the FDA in the US 
and the EMA in the European Union, which in recent years have developed structured 
frameworks within which biomarkers can be approved and endorsed for use, primarily in 
drug development and clinical trials 158,159. In the US, the 21st Century Cures Act adopted 
the process of qualification of drug development tools (including biomarkers) into US law 
in December 2016. Before the establishment of the drug development tool qualification 
program,  FDA  acceptance  of  biomarkers  as  drug  development  tools  happened  on  a 
sponsor-by-sponsor,  drug-by-drug  basis.  Biomarkers  qualified  under  the  current 
framework can be used by drug developers for the qualified context of use. Neuroimaging 
biomarkers  submitted  for  approval  through  the  FDA  framework  (and  with  some 
differences,  the  EMA  framework)  should  be  precisely  defined  with  descriptions  of  the 
neuroimaging protocol, target populations, and the use context for which the biomarker 
is to be approved. 

During the validation process, a biomarker’s analytical characteristics, such as reliability, 
validity, and natural variation need to be established. This is particularly important since 
despite some supporting evidence 160, there are significant concerns about the reliability 
of commonly used neuroimaging paradigms 161. Such research could also aid in the choice 
of biomarker: For example, a recent fMRI alcohol cue-reactivity study demonstrated that 
brain  activations  during  constituting  contrast  conditions  'alcohol'  and  'neutral'  have 
higher reliability than the 'alcohol versus neutral' difference contrast 143. After analytical 
validation, the biomarker should be “clinically validated” by elucidating its etiological link 
to an SUD and establishing that it is reliably associated with current or future disease or

recovery,  for  example  by  presenting  evidence  of  the  existence  and  role  of  neural 
aberrations  in  SUDs  as  was  attempted  in  this  manuscript.  Finally,  it  should  be 
demonstrated  that  the  biomarker  addresses  a  substantial  gap  and  demonstrates  cost-
effectiveness.  As  an  example  of  how  these  requirements  can  be  met  for  a  putative 
neuroimaging marker, Textbox 1 includes a brief discussion of the relevant evidence and 
important gaps  in the  case of markers of striatal structure and function.  Besides these 
formal qualification pathways, the use of biomarkers in clinical contexts can be facilitated 
by  the  endorsement  of  a  constellation  of  other  institutions  which  develop  relevant 
guidelines and best practice recommendations for SUDs. Meeting qualification standards 
for  neuroimaging  biomarkers  requires  broad  collaboration  and  public-private 
partnerships,  extensive  resource  sharing,  and  rigorous  research  practices.  These 
qualification steps are outlined in Figure 7.

Figure 7: Major steps in the development and validation of potential neuroimaging 
biomarkers for SUDs. Initially, the context(s) of use for the biomarker is specified and the 
potential biomarker is precisely defined. Following analytical and clinical validation and cost-
benefit analysis, the compiled evidence is presented for regulatory approval. The FDA evaluates 
the  use  of  biomarkers  for  drug  development  through  a  biomarker  qualification  process 
involving  submission  of  a  Letter  of  Intent,  a  Qualification  Plan,  and  a  Full  Qualification 
Package,  though  a  Letter  of  Support  may  be  issued  by  the  FDA  to  indicate  its  support  for  a 
biomarker before formal qualification. The use of neuroimgaing biomarkers in clinical contexts 
also requires initial approval by the FDA, but also the endorsement of a constellation of other 
institutions  (adapted  from  157,  reproduced  with  permission).  Surr.  Endpoint:  Surrogate 
Endpoint, COU: Context of Use. 

Large-scale  collaboration  and  multiple  stakeholders  in  biomarker 
development 

The development, validation, and impactful use of neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDs will 
depend  upon  the  formation  of  large,  multi-site  consortia  which  can  effectively  direct 
resources towards biomarker discovery with harmonized research designs, starting with 
the “low-hanging fruit”- biomarkers with substantial bodies of supporting evidence and 
greatest  potential  utility,  such  as  in  intervention  development.  Furthermore,  while 
translational  research  in  the  field  is  mostly  conducted  by  academics,  the  developed 
biomarkers need to be cost-effective from the perspective of policymakers interested in 
reducing  the  societal  burden  of  SUDs,  pharmaceutical  companies  developing 
interventions  and  seeking  to  reduce  the  duration  and  cost  of  drug  development,  and 
regulatory  bodies  interested  in  using  scientifically  validated  neuroimaging  markers  in 
approval decisions 162. 

Importantly, the use of neuroimaging biomarkers and the interventions that they are used 
to develop should also be acceptable, accessible, affordable and desirable for individuals 
with SUDs, and concerns about neuroscientific models of addiction should be addressed 
22. Multi-stakeholder engagement is complicated by gaps in knowledge and terminology 
between stakeholders, differences in expectations and interests, power imbalances and 
stigma  associated  with  SUDs,  and  identifying  representative  stakeholders.  Effective 
engagement  of  various  stakeholders  in  biomarker  development  for  SUDs  requires 
designing  engagement  plans  and  collaboration  roadmaps,  developing  common 
terminology,  clarifying  and  communicating  the  purpose  of  the  engagement  and 
stakeholder roles, and investing in the necessary skills and resources 163–165. 

Rigorous research and reporting for biomarker discovery 

An essential step in the development of neuroimaging biomarkers is to harmonize  best 
practices in study design, analysis, and reporting, especially given recent concerns about 
the  reliability  of  multiple  neuroimaging  modalities  166–168.  While  there  is  significant 
disagreement over the best neuroimaging research design practices, certain factors would 
likely  improve  overall  methodological  quality  18.  Larger  sample  sizes  and  appropriate 
statistical power analyses, for example, would improve the reproducibility of fMRI cue

reactivity studies and enable the ascertainment of substantive effects 169. One solution is 
the collation of neuroimaging data into “big data” repositories, such as the structural MRI 
database maintained by the NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analyses (ENIGMA) 
International Consortium 170 and task-based fMRI datasets made available on platforms 
such as OpenNeuro 171, which can be used for large-scale analyses, hypothesis generation, 
and model validation. A growing number of multi-center initiatives such as the Human 
Connectome  Project,  UK  Biobank,  and  the  Adolescent  Brain  Cognitive  Development 
(ABCD)  project  collect  neuroimaging  data  from  thousands  of  individuals  using 
harmonized  scanning  and  data  management  standards  across  sites  and  may  provide 
highly useful for the identification of neuroimaging markers 172–174.       In the absence of 
large-scale  studies,  meta-analyses  can  be  used  to  synthesise  data  across  neuroimaging 
studies, discover convergent findings that replicate across SUDs and contexts of use, and 
disambiguate  the  influence  of  study  design  and  confounders.  A  summary  of  neural 
markers which have replicated across SUDs or contexts of use is presented in Table 1. 

Another issue is the methodological heterogeneity of neuroimaging research. The choice 
of hardware, data acquisition protocol, pre-processing steps, and analysis pipelines can 
have  unexpected  and  substantial  effects  on  the  results  of  studies  using  a  variety  of 
neuroimaging modalities  175–177. While it is impossible to prescribe a similar set of best 
practices for every study, the design should be appropriate to specific contexts of use if 
the  results  are  to  contribute  to  biomarker  development.  Furthermore,  the  clarity, 
interpretability, and replicability of neuroimaging research would be enhanced with pre-
registered  protocols,  carefully  considering  essential  aspects  of  research  design,  and 
comprehensive  reporting  of  methodological  details  178.  Various  guidelines  for  research 
design  and  reporting  have  been  developed  in  recent  years  with  various  degrees  of 
generality, such as those developed by the Committee on Best Practice in Data Analysis 
and  Sharing  (COBIDAS)  and  COBIDAS  MEEG  179,180  and  the  Addiction  Cue  Reactivity 
Initiative (ACRI) of the addiction working group of ENIGMA consortium 54. 

Technological advancements relevant to SUD biomarker discovery  

A variety of innovations in neuroimaging technology, data management, and analysis may 
pave the way for SUD neuroimaging biomarkers. Among promising advances are high-
field  MRI  with  increasingly  stronger  magnetic  fields,  which  can  offer  greater  spatial 
resolution  in  structural  and  functional  scans  181;  functional  magnetic  resonance 
spectroscopy  (fMRS),  which  can  capture  dynamic  changes  in  metabolites  182;  and  new 
PET  radiotracers,  which  can  probe  under-investigated  neurotransmitter  systems  of 
interest to addiction medicine 183. Another emerging possibility is the use of neuroimaging 
to derive subject-specific “fingerprints” of brain circuitry or function, such as “precision 
functional mapping” to identify individual-level functional connectomes with fMRI 184 or 
the use of EEG to identify participant-specific electrophysiological patterns  185,186. Such 
subject-level (rather than group-level) neuroimaging markers are particularly useful for 
biomarker development since most contexts of use require biomarkers which can be used 
to make decisions for individual patients, and the heterogeneity of brain structure and 
function  across  individuals  renders  the  translation  of  group-level  findings  to  the 
individual-level problematic 187,188.

It  is  also  increasingly  possible  to  integrate  different  neuroimaging  technologies 
concurrently  or  in  series,  and  use  multimodal  data  to  probe  multiple  facets  of  brain 
structure and function in tandem: resting-state fMRI and MRS can be utilized together to 
assess the relationship between neuromodulation-associated brain network changes and 
neurotransmitter  concentrations  189,  functional  diffuse  correlation  spectroscopy  and 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy have been used along with EEG during and after 
brain stimulation to concurrently measure cerebral hemodynamics and electrical activity 
(Giovannella et al., 2018), simultaneous EEG and fMRI neurofeedback might improve the 
quality of the provided neurofeedback using bimodal data (Lioi et al., 2020), and receptor 
maps obtained by PET can inform resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analysis 190. 
These technological advances have co-occurred with rapid developments in informatics, 
data  analytics,  and  computational  infrastructure  which  facilitate  data  storage  and 
sharing,  biomarker  discovery  with 
learning 
algorithms, and reproducible analytical practices 191,192.

Theories and models of addiction 

A  significant  challenge  in  biomarker  development  and  theoretical  progress  in  both 
addiction  medicine  and  psychiatry  as  a  whole  is  the  fact  that  the DSM  is  a  descriptive 
diagnostic manual, and its constructs are neither domain-based nor necessarily grounded 
in neurobiology 193. SUDs are multifaceted disorders with complex comorbidity patterns 
and overlapping brain substrates 194,195, and neuroimaging biomarkers will likely reflect 
the trans-diagnostic impairment and recovery of physiological processes which undergird 
specific  cognitive  domains.  This  highlights  the  importance  of    mechanistic  models  of 
disease (rather than manual-based diagnostic labels) in the development of neuroimaging 
addiction  biomarkers.  Under  most  mechanistic  accounts  of  addiction,  addiction  starts 
with positive reinforcement learning before other processes are involved 7. These include 
excessive incentive sensitization 139 for example, which can explain heightened reactivity 
to drug cues in functional neuroimaging studies 96,196–200. What happens later is subject 
to  some  contention:  some  emphasize  a  shift  from  initially  goal-directed  behavior  to 
habitual and then compulsive substance use, reflected in neuroimaging findings of a shift 
in drug cue-reactivity from the ventral to the dorsal striatum 201; while others highlight a 
shift  from  positive  to  negative  reinforcement  as  withdrawal  becomes  more  important, 
with  some  emphasizing  goal-directed  choice  (rather  than  habit  or  compulsion)  as 
individuals learn to relieve negative affect with substance use.  

Other  models  focus  on  processes  such  as  learning  and  executive  control.  The  reward 
deficiency and allostasis models 202, for example, highlight the importance of suppression 
and disruption of reward processing circuits; while others focus on core deficits in value 
updates  and  reward  learning  203.  These  models  can  explain  wide-spread  neural 
aberrations when individuals with various  SUDs process non-drug gains and  losses  136 
and  the  reduced  salience  of  novel  and  surprising  stimuli  204.  While  the  frameworks 
discussed above can account for frequent observations of impaired response  inhibition 
205 (and corresponding neuroimaging aberrations during executive control tasks  198,206–
209), recent “dual process” accounts of addiction emphasize the broad disruption of top-
down, deliberative processes in prefrontal and parietal regions together with deregulation

and disinhibition of bottom-up automatic processes in mesolimbic circuits  210. Further, 
recent  observations  suggest  that  general  cognitive  decline  and  a  broad  depletion  of 
executive control in addiction may be particularly important to the course of disease and 
treatment  211,  in  line  with  broad  degenerations  of  cortical  gray  and  white  matter 
39,41,43,47,212.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  many  of  these  contructs  are  not  mutually 
exclusive,  and  multiple  interacting  processes  may  be  in  play  in  the  development, 
maintenance and recovery from SUDs. 

Overall,  the  briefly  discussed  models  (see  10  for  detailed  discussion)  and  theories  have 
been  developed  in  tandem  with  advances  in  addiction  neuroimaging,  and  provide 
promising starting points for the development of neuroimaging biomarkers. Frameworks 
such as the impaired response inhibition and salience attribution model 11, the Addictions 
Neuroclinical Assessment framework 8, and the Alcohol and Addiction Research Domain 
Criteria  213  aim  to  map  addictive  disorders  to  specific  axes  of  impairment  and 
neuroimaging  research  by  facilitating  hypothesis  generation  and  the  development  of 
interpretable  neuroimaging  biomarkers  linked  to  formal  theories  of  addiction.  Despite 
differences, these frameworks converge on the involvement of positive valence, negative 
valence  and  cognitive  control  systems  in  SUDs,  and  have  been  used  to  propose 
neuroscience-informed  classifications  of  interventions  10,214.  Complementing  these 
theoretical developments, computational modeling of processes of interest in addiction 
neuroscience  (such  as  drug  cue-reactivity,  aberrant  decision-making,  etc.)  can 
mechanistically  represent  the  interplay  between  neural  mechanisms  and  behavior  and 
link  neuroimaging  markers,  underlying  neuro-cognitive  pathology,  and  signs  and 
symptoms of SUDs 215,216. 

CONCLUSION 

insights 

Modern  neuroimaging  technologies  can  probe  brain  structure  and  function  at 
into  the 
unprecedented  resolution  and  have  already  produced  novel 
neurocognitive mechanisms of addiction and recovery. The rapid pace of technological 
advancement, 
increasing  availability,  and  growing  recognition  of  neuroimaging 
paradigms in recent years has contributed to an explosion in their use within clinical and 
translational  addiction  medicine:  from  2015  to  2021,  an  average  of  35  protocols  with 
neuroimaging  as  one  of  the  registered  outcome  measures  in  people  with  SUDs  were 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov every year, more than ten times the average number from 
2000  to  2006.  Especially  popular  are  fMRI  (268  protocols)  and  EEG  (50  protocols), 
which  dynamically  assess  brain  function;  PET  (71  protocols)  and  MRS  (35  protocols) 
which  probe  neurotransmitter  systems  and  their  interactions  with  radioligands;  and 
structural MRI (35 protocols) which can be used to investigate brain structure at various 
scales.  These  paradigms  can  be  systematically  utilized  to  discover  and  develop 
biomarkers,  measures  that  objectively  reflect  biological  processes  involved  in  both  the 
progression  of  substance  use  and  SUDs  and  the  physiological  and  clinical  impact  of 
interventions  for  these  disorders.  Particularly  promising  are  several  neuroimaging 
markers  which  have  replicated  in  meta-analyses  across  contexts  of  use  and  disorders. 
Technological  and  scientific  advancements,  rigorous  research  practices,  and  multi-
stakeholder  engagement  can  facilitate  the  development  of  institutionally  approved

be used in clinical practice in the foreseeable future. 

METHODS AND LIMITATIONS 

The  present  manuscript  is  informed  by  two  systematic  reviews.  The  first  covered  SUD 
clinical research protocols which include neuroimaging outcome measures, obtained by 
querying  the  ClinicalTrials.gov  repository  between  inception  and  November  17,  2021 
(Supplementary Figure 1a). This systematic review yielded a final result of 409 protocols. 
The second systematic review was conducted on PubMed, focusing on meta-analyses of 
neuroimaging studies of SUDs and finding 61 meta-analyses from which 83 meta-analytic 
findings were extracted (Supplementary Figure 1b). Please refer to the methods section 
of  the  supplementary  materials  for  more  details  on  the  methods,  and  to  the  OSF 
repository  https://osf.io/79uc3/?view_only=1d92a6fd769f40119464b156f0c88912  for 
the search protocol and analysis scripts.  Although we used widely-known and inclusive 
databases of protocols and meta-analyses, we did not triangulate the results with other 
databases.  Our  approach  likely  leads  to  some  missing  protocols  and  papers,  and  in 
particular  an  under-representation  of  protocols  from  countries  that  use  registration
