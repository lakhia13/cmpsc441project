- Symptoms vs. Disorders

- A psychiatric disorder is a mental illness that seriously affects thinking, mood, and behavior.

- Symptoms of psychiatric disorders include confusion, sadness, and trouble managing stress.

- If you have ongoing mental health symptoms, you may need both medication and talk therapy.

A psychiatric disorder is a mental illness diagnosed by a mental health professional that greatly disturbs your thinking, moods, and/or behavior and seriously increases your risk of disability, pain, death, or loss of freedom.

In addition, your symptoms must be more severe than expected response to an upsetting event, such as normal grief after the loss of a loved one.


## Examples of Psychiatric Disorders


A large number ofpsychiatric disordershave been identified.Chances are that, whether or not you or someone close to you has been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, you know something about one or more of the following examples:

- Personality disorders

- Anxiety disorders

- Eating disorders

- Addictive behaviors

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), one in five adults in the U.S. has some type of mental illness. This includes conditions that can range from mild to severe.

NIMH distinguishes between any mental illness (AMI), which represents all recognized mental health conditions, and serious mental illness (SMI), which involves a small and more severe subset of illnesses.

NIMH reports that in 2021, 5.5% (14.1 million) of U.S. adults over the age of 18 had a serious mental illness.

Examples of ongoing signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders include:

## Types of Psychiatric Disorders


Psychiatric disorders fall into one of the following main types (often called classes or categories):


### Neurodevelopmental Disorders


Neurodevelopmental disorders affect how your brain functions and can affect cognition, behavior, communication, and motor abilities.The many psychiatric disorders in this group usually begin in infancy or childhood, often before a child starts school. Examples include:

- Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

- Autism spectrum disorders

- Learning disorders


### Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders


Psychotic disorders cause detachment from reality. People with these diagnoses experience delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking and speech.

Schizophreniais probably the best known of these illnesses, although detachment from reality can sometimes affect people with other psychiatric disorders.


### Bipolar and Related Disorders


This group includes disorders in which episodes ofmania(periods of excessive excitement, activity, and energy) alternate with periods of depression.

There are three types of bipolar disorder:

- Bipolar I: Characterized by episodes of mania and depression

- Bipolar II: Characterized by depressive and hypomanic episodes

- Cyclothymic disorder: Marked by depressive and hypomanic symptoms that are not severe enough to be considered mood episodes


### Depressive Disorders


These include disorders characterized by feelings of extreme sadness and worthlessness, along with reduced interest in previously enjoyable activities. Examples include:

- Major depressive disorder: There are also different forms of major depressive disorder, including seasonal affective disorder and postpartum depression.

- Persistent depressive disorder (PDD): This involves mild to moderate depression that lasts longer than two years.

- Premenstrual dysphoric disorder(PMDD): This is more severe than the more widely known premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS isnotclassified as a psychiatric disorder.


### Anxiety Disorders


Anxiety involves focusing on bad or dangerous things that could happen and worrying fearfully and excessively about them. Anxiety disorders include:

- Illness anxiety disorder: A condition marked by an excessive worry about bodily sensations and a belief that one has or will get a serious medical condition

- Somatic symptom disorder (previously known as hypochondriasis): An excessive preoccupation with physical symptoms that create significant distress and make it difficult to function in everyday life

- Factitious disorder: Involves intentionally creating symptoms or faking symptoms of an illness

### Neurocognitive Disorders


These psychiatric disorders affect people’s ability to think and reason. The disorders in this group include delirium as well as disorders of thinking and reasoning caused by such conditions or diseases as traumatic brain injury or Alzheimer's disease.

This group includes psychiatric disorders that are due to other medical conditions or that don't meet all the requirements for any of the other psychiatric disorder groups.


## When Does a Mental Health Concern Become a Psychiatric Disorder?


If you're like most people, you’ve probably had a mental health concern from time to time, such as depression following ​the loss of a job. These concerns are typically time-limited, and eventually, you start to feel better.

That’s not true of a psychiatric disorder, in which your symptoms are ongoing and frequently upsetting to you and the people around you.

A psychiatric disorder also interferes with your ability to do day-to-day tasks.

When the stress of trying to cope with your symptoms becomes more than you can handle, treatment typically involves a combination of medications andpsychotherapy(also called talk therapy).
