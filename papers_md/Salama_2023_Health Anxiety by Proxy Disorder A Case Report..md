Abstract
Health anxiety by proxy (HAP) is a newly introduced term in psychiatry to describe the anxious feelings or
fear of having or acquiring a serious illness. It is often accompanied by maladaptive illness behavior in the
absence of true somatic symptoms. This, in turn, entails seeking medical advice and therefore doing many
unnecessary investigations in an attempt to justify these symptoms. Functional impairment may appear in
HAP patients, and this indicates a pathological point. To some extent, it can be said that HAP is similar to
health anxiety disorder in terms of symptomatology and items. However, it is imposed on another (usually
the patients’ children) instead of the patient himself. Many biopsychosocial factors are suggested to play a
role in the psychopathology of HAP. Until now, there are no well-established criteria in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) or International
Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) to make the diagnosis of health anxiety by proxy. Although
treatment protocols are missing, it appears that patients are not responding to treatment protocols for
illness anxiety disorder. This requires focusing attention on conducting studies on those patients to develop
clear treatment plans to help patients. In this report, we present a 28-year-old female with constant worries
about her child’s health, which subsequently resulted in seeking medical advice at multiple clinics with
different medical specialties. Many factors were thought to be implicated in triggering her current condition.
The anxious feelings reflected negatively on the patient's life, resulting in a poor functioning status. A
treatment plan was initiated with a dismal response and fluctuating course. Additionally, we discussed the
initial definition and the bases that could be used to facilitate the diagnosis and management of HAP
disorder.

Introduction
Illness anxiety disorder (IAD), previously known as hypochondriasis, is classified as a somatic symptom and
related disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It is
characterized by rumination and intense worries about harboring serious illness [1]. This condition is often
triggered by a misunderstanding of one's own bodily sensations [2], which are explained as alarming signs of
a serious illness and associated with maladaptive illness behavior with recurrent body examination and/or
medical advice seeking [3], which mostly provides transient relief of their anxiety  [4].

DSM-5 describes two types of IAD: the care-seeking type and the care-avoidant type. The care-seeking type
involves those who constantly use the healthcare system, including physician visits and performing multiple
tests and procedures. On the other hand, the care-avoidant type refers to patients who avoid seeking medical
advice. They have severe anxiety and believe their physician visit or laboratory test will reveal life-
threatening illnesses like cancer [5].

Clinical observations suggest that illness anxiety may extend to affect others, such as children. In
comparison to healthy women, recent studies have shown that mothers who suffer from illness anxiety
disorder would display higher levels of maladaptive health behaviors towards their children. Health anxiety
by proxy (HAP) has recently been introduced as a term to describe excessive parental concerns and
preoccupation with their child's symptoms and fear that physicians will overlook a serious disease in their
child [6]. Consequently, this will expose the child to unnecessary and potentially unpleasant medical
examinations and procedures.

HAP has been largely neglected in pediatric settings [6]. Therefore, till 2021, no standardized measures for
systematic assessment were established. In 2021, a group of researchers developed the Health Anxiety by
Proxy Scale (HAPYS) to systematically assess HAP [7]. Twenty-six items characteristic of HAP has been
introduced in the last update of this scale. The current study aims to expand our knowledge and
understanding of this type of somatic symptom and related disorder. Herein, we present a case of a care-
seeking type of health anxiety by proxy, whose disease course has been characterized by recurrent visits to
the physician to seek reassurance about her son's health in the past five years with no resolution of signs

and symptoms.

Case Presentation
The patient has a bachelor's degree in psychology but does not have a job. She married eight years ago and
has three sons aged seven years, four years, and 15 months. During her lifetime, she went through many
biopsychosocial stressors, the most prominent of which was that her marital relationship was not
interconnected or enjoyable. She claimed that her marital relationship was problematic, with multiple ups
and downs. She also mentioned that her husband always neglects her, and she is the only one who puts much
effort into this relationship. She also mentioned a history of sexual abuse when she was young.

The patient presented to the clinic complaining of constant worry about her youngest child's health for the
past year. This started when she noticed a spot on her son's back, which, in turn, raised her suspicion that
her son might suffer from a serious illness. Subsequently, the patient began to search and investigate the
matter and visited many doctors from different specialties to check on her son's health. Her visit to the
physician used to give her a transient relief of her anxiety. However, gradually, she began to increase the
frequency of her physicians' visits with minor relief of her symptoms. At first, she used to seek medical
attention about three times a month. Later on, her disease started progressing, and thus, her physicians'
visits increased. She mentioned that she went to four physicians in one day. At the time of initial medical
seeking, she had been told that her son might have McCune Albright syndrome. Therefore, her concern
became centered and preoccupied with that illness.

During the five-months before coming to the psychiatric clinic, she visited most of the medical specialties,
the most prominent of which were: Pediatricians, Dermatologists, Neurologists, Endocrinologists, and
Orthopedists. All the physicians, after conducting some necessary examinations and labs, agreed that her
son's health was good and he did not suffer from any diseases. However, this did not reassure her and did not
change her view on anything, which encouraged one of her relatives, who primarily works in the medical
field, to advise her to visit a mental health clinic.

Accordingly, after attending the psychiatrist, a treatment plan was started. The patient was first started on
escitalopram 20mg for three months. In the first few weeks of drug therapy, she showed slightly elevated
mood, talkativeness, and to a small extent, slight relief in her anxiety. Later on, her response started to
decline, and the patient relapsed despite the increase in drug dose. Thus, venlafaxine 75mg twice daily and
propranolol 10mg PRN was tried for one month. During this period, the patient's condition worsened, and
she began to have suicidal thoughts and tried to commit suicide using medications. She also mentioned that
she started to worry about her older child's health status due to the emergence of a new spot on his back.
Thus, propranolol has been replaced with risperidone 1mg twice daily. There was minor improvement
related to poor inter-family support and fluctuated husband's attention. Accordingly, the patient started on
fluoxetine in addition to the previously mentioned drugs. It is important to mention that the patient
underwent several cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions in conjunction with medications throughout
her treatment period.

With those medications, the patient slightly improved with a fluctuating course. She mainly did better with
psychotherapy, especially in the first few days of the treatment, in addition to family support and attention.
However, most of the time, the patient showed the same concerns related to her son, anxiety, health
behaviors, and poor functionality. She recently started to avoid showing her family her anxiety related to her
suspected son's illness. To exemplify this, she mentioned that she took her son to outpatient clinics multiple
times without telling her family to avoid their worry about her condition.

Discussion
Health anxiety by proxy disorder (HAP) is characterized by excessive worries about having or developing a
serious and undiagnosed disease in someone else (usually the patient's child's health) [6]. These worries and
concerns persist despite normal physical examination and investigations. Physical symptoms are not
present, and if they are present, they are minimal. As health anxiety by proxy is described as a new
phenomenon in mental health, there are no epidemiological studies about this new phenomenon. Therefore,
any case that raises suspicion for this disorder should be reported to help develop diagnostic criteria and
management for this newly defined disorder.

The clinical presentation of HAP is suggested to be similar to that of an illness anxiety disorder (IAD).
However, the concern will be on someone else's health, such as the patient's child, as presented in this case,
instead of the patient's health. Symptoms of illness anxiety occur on a spectrum from physiological to
pathological and are considered pathological when anxiety about health causes functional impairment, as
demonstrated in the case presentation [8,9]. Patients often discuss their illness concerns with others,
investigate the suspected diagnoses, and seek reassurance from others.

These preoccupations are heterogeneous, so patients may be preoccupied with a particular diagnosis,
alteration in body function, or vague concern. The patient's concern may involve one or more organ systems,
and the concern may shift over time from one organ or disease to another [10]. It is apparent from the

patient history that the disorder has a chronic course with fluctuating symptoms.

The preoccupation with the feared illness often becomes a central focus of the patient's life, which leads to
high healthcare utilization. Moreover, sometimes patients may press the physician to do invasive diagnostic
tests and higher-risk treatments. Seeking care from multiple clinicians, "doctor-shopping" is prominent in
this case, supporting the diagnosis. Comorbid psychopathology may be present, but it is often missed due to
attention on the primary disorder.

According to DSM-5 and DSM-5-TR, there are no diagnostic criteria for HAP. Therefore, we diagnosed this
disorder according to DSM-5-TR criteria applied for IAD but with the concerns imposed on the patient’s
child [11]. The patient is preoccupied with her child having or developing a serious illness in the setting of
mild or absent somatic symptoms. Substantial anxiety about her child’s health was evident, with a low
threshold for becoming alarmed about his condition. There were reported excessive health-related behaviors
manifested by repeatedly visiting multiple physicians and doing extensive investigations. The preoccupation
was for more than six months (about one year in our case) and is not explained by other medical or mental
disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or somatic type of delusional disorders.

A newly designed scale measures excessive parental worries about children's health. Health Anxiety by Proxy
Scale (HAPYS) is designed to provide a systematic assessment of health anxiety by proxy. The final version
of this scale consists of 26 item characteristic of health anxiety by proxy and an impact section with five
items [7]. Although this scale measures excessive parental worries but does not set a definitive way to
diagnose health anxiety by proxy disorder. In the future, after creating definitive characteristics for
diagnosis, this scale can be an important tool to diagnose this disorder.

General medical disorders should be ruled out before diagnosing health anxiety by proxy disorder.
Additionally, symptoms of health anxiety by proxy disorder may overlap with the symptoms of other
psychiatric disorders, and sometimes, it is difficult to make a diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for HAP
may include one of these: normal reactions, adjustment disorder, factious disorder imposed on another
(Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSP)), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), specific phobia, panic disorder, psychotic disorders, unipolar major depression or persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia). 

Patients with health anxiety by proxy disorder have excessive concerns and preoccupations that are
unrelated to symptoms' severity and persist for at least six months in contrast to normal reactions. On the
other hand, patients with adjustment disorder may have anxiety and worries about their children's health.
However, adjustment disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion. It occurs within three months of an onset of an
identifiable non-life-threatening stressor and lasts ≤ 6 months following the resolution of that stressor.
Meanwhile, patients with MSP intentionally falsify symptoms or induce injury in someone else. Both are not
present in this case. Patients with GAD may have worries about their children's health, but they are also
preoccupied with worries about other aspects of their lives, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Patients with HAP may have intrusive thoughts about their children's health and develop compulsive
behaviors (e.g., visiting physicians). However, in HAP, the preoccupations usually focus on having a disease.
In contrast, in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and usually focus on fears of
getting a disease in the future. Additionally, patients with OCD seek reassurance in an attempt to relieve or
reduce anxiety associated with the intrusive thoughts related to their children's health, while patients with
HAP visit physicians in a try to find the diagnosis of their children's illness and manage them accordingly.

HAP patients are primarily preoccupied with issues about someone else's health, not specific objects or
situations; thus, the diagnosis of a specific phobia is unlikely. They may develop panic attacks like those
with panic disorder, but these attacks are triggered by concerns about the child's health. In contrast, in panic
disorder, these attacks are not limited to health concerns. They also understand that their concerns and
fears may not be true, as opposed to patients with psychotic disorders who have intense and rigid beliefs
associated with other signs of psychosis (e.g., hallucinations or disorganized speech). Patients with major
depression or persistent depressive disorder may not accept reassurance to their concerns regarding their
children's health, especially during their major depressive episodes. However, if their worries and concerns
persist despite the remission of their depressive episode, the diagnosis of HAP should be considered.
Additionally, they also have other symptoms (e.g., insomnia, anorexia, anergia, impaired memory and
concentration, and suicidality) [11].

The most important aspect of the management of IAD is establishing a strong therapeutic alliance with the
patient [12]. It is essential for the patients to feel that their concerns and worries are understood and not
underestimated by the physician. This could be achieved by regular visits to the same physician or
psychiatrist to have an open dialog and monitor how their fears and concerns improve or worsen over time
[13]. Medical and psychiatric management of patients with IAD tends to improve coping with fears and
worries rather than eliminate them. This is done to prevent patients from adopting the sick role and
becoming chronically invalid, thus ignoring their real medical issues [14,15]. The goal of treatment for those
patients is to relieve their health worries by reassuring them that medical illnesses are ruled out based on

medical and laboratory investigations to limit their visits to specialists and avoid unnecessary diagnostic
procedures. This is also done to reduce the wasting of medical resources and physicians’ time and efforts.
Some studies estimated that about 20% of the medical budget in the United States is spent on patients with
some form of somatization or IAD [16].

The management of IAD is mainly done by psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both.
There are no head-to-head trials to compare the effect of using a combination to using either of the
treatments alone. Still, some studies suggest that psychotherapy is superior to medications. Thus,
nowadays, psychotherapy is considered the first-line treatment for patients with hypochondriasis [17]. Many
studies showed that cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral stress management, and psychoeducation
effectively improved patients’ health-related thoughts and behaviors. It also helped in the relief of their
anxiety and depression [18].

The use of medications such as antidepressants is usually considered a second line of treatment or an
alternative to psychotherapy in cases of poor accessibility to CBT or in cases of patient denial of
psychotherapy [19]. Additionally, we can use the medications as a first-line treatment in case of IAD with
other comorbidities like depressive disorders. Antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been proven to be
effective in patients with IAD. Additionally, patients should be reassured and given detailed information
about the plan of treatment to enhance their compliance because many of them may misinterpret the use of
medications as an attempt to ignore their worries.

Despite the use of multiple lines of treatment, from psychotherapy to different drug regimens for managing
our patient, her disease course showed mild improvement with multiple relapses. This suggests that the
management of health anxiety by proxy should not be similar to that of the usual IAD. Thus, we need to
develop a new protocol to improve the outcomes of those patients in the future.

Conclusions
Health anxiety by-proxy describes the preoccupation with excessive worries about other person’s health,
especially patients’ children, in the absence or minimal somatic symptoms. It is essential for the patients to
feel that their concerns and worries are understood and not underestimated by the physician. This can
ensure that those patients will receive the proper treatment and avoid the unnecessary treatment of their
healthy relatives. Until today, there are no definitive criteria to diagnose patients with this disorder, but it
seems to be similar to that of usual IAD. The management of HAP seems to be similar to IAD, where
psychotherapy and antidepressants are the mainstays of treatment. However, they are not as effective, which
suggests the need for new protocols for the management of HAP.
