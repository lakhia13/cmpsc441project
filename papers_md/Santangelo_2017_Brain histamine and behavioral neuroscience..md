The  human  histaminergic 

system  contains 
approximately  64.000  neurons  located  in  a  posterior 
region of the hypothalamus, the tuberomamillary nucleus. 
Projections of such a relatively small number of neurons 
are  surprisingly  widespread  throughout  the  central 
nervous system. Histaminergic neurons are highly active 
during wakefulness and contribute to the physiology of 
arousal  state,  exploration,  pain  modulation,  nutrition, 
thermoregulation and brain energy metabolism, learning 
and  memory  functioning  [1].  The  possibility  to  assess 
the  contribution  of  brain  histamine  (HA)  to  specific 
behavioral  changes  is  a  complex  task,  taking  into 
consideration  the  broad  modulatory  activity  exerted  by 
this amine at different levels of cortical and subcortical 
circuitry.  An  explanation  of  the  diversity  of  functions 
of  the  histaminergic  system  may  be  attributed  to  the 
heterogeneous nature of HA neurons that are organized 
into functionally distinct circuits, impinging on different 
brain regions, and display selective control mechanisms 
[2].

From  a  quantitative  perspective,  data  from 
genetic  models  indicate  that  lack  of  HA  is  associated 
with reduced motor activity reasonably due to impaired 
arousal  state  and  motivation  [3].  Recent  findings  have 
unveiled an additional relevant contribution of brain HA 
on qualitative features of the displayed motor behavior 
both  in  humans  and  animals  [4].  Ercan-Sencicek  and 
colleagues [5] have elaborated a histaminergic hypothesis 
of tic phenomenology on the basis of the identification of 
a rare autosomal dominant form of Tourette’s syndrome 
highly correlated with a nonsense mutation, Hdc W317X, 
on the gene for histidine decarboxylase (HDC) the key-
enzyme  responsible  for  HA  synthesis.  HA  and  the  H3-
receptor have a strong influence on dopaminergic activity 
in the Basal Ganglia suggesting an unexpected role of HA 

in the pathophysiology of movement disorders, not only 
confined to tic symptomatology. The peculiar distribution 
of  the  H3  receptor,  mainly  confined  to  the  brain,  calls 
for  a  better  understanding  of  the  role  of  this  amine  in 
brain  circuitry  [6]. The  H3  receptor  likely  represents  a 
selective pharmacological target to modulate brain HA. 
Albeit a direct involvement of the histaminergic system 
has  been  suggested,  to  our  knowledge,  only  in  the 
Tourette’s syndrome, markers of an altered HA activity 
have been described in several neuropsychiatric conditions 
characterized by stereotypical or abnormal motor behavior 
and thoughts, such as Schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, 
Huntington’s disease or Addiction [3][6].

In view of these results, we have recently described 
the effect of an acute brain HA depletion on the display of 
motor sequences of naïve CD1 mice in the open-field [7]. 
Our approach does not require any previous conditioning 
and the analysis is carried out following a high-res video 
recording  of  the  ongoing  behavior.  HA  depletion  was 
obtained by intracerebroventricular administration of the 
HDC  inhibitor  alpha-fluoromethylhistidine  and  motor 
sequences were detected and analyzed using a multivariate 
technique known as temporal pattern (t-pattern) analysis. 
Basically,  a  t-pattern  represents  a  sequence  describing 
repetitive  aspects  of  a  studied  behavior  [8]  and  can  be 
formally presented using the following expressions:

X1 ≈dt1 X2 ≈dt2 X3 ... Xi ≈dti Xi+1

where, X1 ... X2 ... X3 indicate the components of 
a  given  sequence  of  events  and  ≈dt  terms  indicate  the 
temporal interval between these components (with ≈dt ≥ 
0). Hence, for instance, Xi ≈dti Xi+1 indicates a t-pattern 
where the component Xi is followed by the component Xi+1 
after the dti interval. 

Figure 1: Example of a three-event t-pattern occurring four times during an observation period (T0-Tx) encompassing 
a 40 hypothetical events (letters). The ((A B) C) sequence becomes evident if all the remaining events are left out (grey letters). 
“First”, “second” and “following steps” = search runs carried out by the software on the basis of a bottom-up criterion.

T-pattern  analysis  is  performed  by  means  of  a 
specific software known as Theme® (Patternvision LTD, 
Iceland;  Noldus  IT,  The  Netherlands).  This  computer 
program, on the basis of an advanced algorithm, searches 
for  statistically  significant  constraints  among  events  in 
observational  data,  by  taking  into  account  occurrences, 
order,  and  timing  of  the  events.  For  example,  given  a 
hypothetical period of observation encompassing a number 
of behavioral events (e.g. A, B, C, D, ...) performed by 
a  freely  moving  animal  (see  Figure  1),  the  algorithm 
compares  the  distributions  of  each  pair  of  events  (e.g. 
“A” and “B”) assessing the existence of a time interval 
so that “A” is followed by “B” within that interval more 
often  than  chance  expectation.  If  such  a  circumstance 
is confirmed, “A” and “B” are considered a t-pattern of 
first level (A B). In a second step, following a bottom-up 
search process, this pattern is considered the starting point 
for higher-order t-patterns, e.g. ((A B) C) and so on up to 
any level. Fig. 1 illustrates a hypothetical t-pattern of three 
events, occurring four times within an observation period 
encompassing  several  behavioral  events.  More  details 
concerning  theories,  concepts  and  techniques  behind 
t-pattern  analysis  can  be  found  in  our  recent  book  [8].        
By using such a multivariate technique, main results of 
our study [7] can be summarized as follows:

•  Brain HA has important modulatory activity in 
terms of behavioral patterning/sequencing;
•  Acute HA depletion is associated with increased 
number  and  complexity  of  motor  sequences 
displayed in the open field;

•  This  enhancement  appears  to  involve  mainly 
exploratory, rather than grooming activity;
•  The  dopamine  D2/D3  receptor  antagonist 
sulpiride,  at  non  sedative  doses,  provides  a 
partial reversal of the effects observed in HA 
depleted  mice,  thus  suggesting  a  relevant 
interplay between dopamine and histamine.
According  to  these  results  we  suggest  that  the 
consistent  increase  both  in  complexity  and  number  of 
exploratory  sequences  observed  in  the  HA  depleted 
animals,  although  not  apparently  associated  with  the 
presence of any actual abnormal motor behavior compared 
to  controls,  may  represent  the  behavioral  phenotype 
underlying  the  pathophysiology  of  tic-phenomenology 
and,  possibly,  other  above-mentioned  neuropsychiatric 
disorders.  Further  studies  are  in  progress  in  our 
laboratories in this direction.
