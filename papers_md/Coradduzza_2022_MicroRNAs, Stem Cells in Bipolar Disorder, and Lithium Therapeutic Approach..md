Abstract: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, chronic, and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder charac-
terized by recurrent mood disturbances (mania/hypomania and depression, with or without mixed
features) and a constellation of cognitive, psychomotor, autonomic, and endocrine abnormalities.
The etiology of BD is multifactorial, including both biological and epigenetic factors. Recently, mi-
croRNAs (miRNAs), a class of epigenetic regulators of gene expression playing a central role in brain
development and plasticity, have been related to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including BD.
Moreover, an alteration in the number/distribution and differentiation potential of neural stem cells
has also been described, signiﬁcantly affecting brain homeostasis and neuroplasticity. This review
aimed to evaluate the most reliable scientiﬁc evidence on miRNAs as biomarkers for the diagnosis of
BD and assess their implications in response to mood stabilizers, such as lithium. Neural stem cell
distribution, regulation, and dysfunction in the etiology of BD are also dissected.

1. Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, chronic, and disabling neuropsychiatric disorder.
An estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% and rates reaching as high as 4–5% have been
reported for bipolar spectrum disorders [1]. BD is characterized by recurrent episodes of
mania or hypomania and depression, with or without mixed features, and subsyndromal
symptoms are common [2]. The pathogenesis of BD is not well understood; nevertheless,
research is focusing on genetics, neurobiological, and psychosocial factors contributing to
the development of the disorder [3], with heritability being ∼70% [1–4]. The analysis of
genetic variation associated with BD susceptibility conﬁrmed its highly polygenic nature,
describing many thousands of common variants that are associated, at different levels,
with the risk of BD [5]. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is often subjective due to the
complex spectrum of symptoms. From a clinical point of view, the differential diagnosis
of BD from other diseases showing overlapping symptoms is still a challenge, thus [5,6]
affecting the suitable treatment from the early stages [7]. Within this context, patients
could exhibit hypomanic episodes as a mood status, while seeking medical help during
depressive episodes [8]. The diagnostic error is approximately 40% and could require
5–12 years to be corrected, leading to a prolonged course, more affective episodes, and
an increased suicide rate and socioeconomic burden [9,10]. Within this context, the iden-
tiﬁcation of biomarkers that may reﬂect BD-speciﬁc pathophysiological processes can be
helpful to enrich current diagnostic algorithms, thus providing new biological targets for
the development of personalized treatments [11,12]. The nervous system (NS) comprises
different cell types, including stem cells, that reside in speciﬁc niches, capable of generating

new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes [13]. Different studies highlighted the po-
tential role of miRNAs as promising biomarkers, easily collected from different biological
ﬂuids [14–16], to reveal the presence and the evolution of BD and drug responses [17].
Different environmental factors or epigenetic modiﬁcations involving miRNA could trigger
psychiatric disorders. Such as BD, affecting adult neurogenesis by inﬂuencing neural stem
cell behavior [18–21]. MiRNAs are responsible for NS development and neurogenesis,
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [22,23], being implicated in translation, RNA
metabolism, gene development, and regulation [24,25]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class
of small, well-conserved noncoding RNAs that, when dysregulated, could be involved
in different nervous system diseases (NSDs) [26–31]. Moreover, they are related to the
glucocorticoid regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in response
to stress in mood and anxiety disorders [32–34]. MiRNAs are actively secreted by cells
either shuttled via microvesicles as exosomes, in complexes with RNA-binding proteins or
lipoproteins, such as nucleophosmin (NPM1), or Argonaute proteins [35–37]. Circulating
miRNAs can be useful candidates for the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders [38,39],
being easily detectable in plasma [33]. This review focuses on the role of circulating miR-
144, miR-134, and miR-34 as potential biomarkers that are also involved in mood stabilizer
treatment of BD [40].

2. Stem Cells Epigenetics and BD

Stem cells are involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the whole organism for their
extensive ability to self-renew and differentiate into tissue-speciﬁc elements. They exert
a crucial role in regenerative medicine, being able to acquire a speciﬁc phenotype upon
stimulation with different chemical or physical stimuli. Moreover, they can be isolated
from several available sources [41–45].

The existence of a subset of stem cells in the central nervous system (CNS) able to gen-
erate new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes has been largely demonstrated [13].
These cells reside in speciﬁc regions of the brain and are responsible for the generation
of new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes [45,46]. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are
undifferentiated neural cells with replicative potential, capable of differentiating into
multiple neuronal and glial cell types. They retain a quiescent state for long periods, thus
providing a pool of reserve cells useful for tissue regeneration [47].

These cells reside in speciﬁc niches, such as the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral
ventriculus, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the subgranular zone (SGZ) [48].
The niche mediates the interaction between stem cells and the environment, being able
to inﬂuence cell fate and behavior. Moreover, in the niche cell–cell interactions, various
microenvironmental signals (among which are growth factors and neurotransmitters) act
to regulate stem cell quiescence and proliferation, and promote neurogenesis [49,50].

Epigenetics, a physiological process with phenotypic alterations triggered by environ-
mental factors not involving changes in the DNA sequence, could play a key role in the
pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). Within this context, microRNAs (miRNAs) may
represent an interesting diagnostic tool in neurogenesis and neuro-psychiatric disorders [51–54].
Different environmental factors, such as stress, exercise, and antidepressant drugs or

neurodegenerative disorders, may affect neurogenesis [55].

Epigenetic modiﬁcation could be involved in adult neurogenesis by inﬂuencing stem
cells located in the niche [56] by inducing chromatid modiﬁcations and thus altering the
expression of selected targets, ultimately affecting the maintenance of the proliferation and
stemness of NSCs [57].

3. MicroRNA Expression in Bipolar Disorder

Emerging omics technologies are providing innovative tools for medical decision-
making. Many authors suggest that, among transcriptomic biomarkers, microRNAs
(miRNAs) are the most promising. MiRNAs, detectable in liquid biopsy, are highly stable,
have a long half-life, their analysis does not require any special handling, and they are
quantiﬁed with relatively low cost, high sensitivity, and high speciﬁcity through standard
techniques [58,59], as shown in Table 1.

miRNA expression has been analyzed in different samples, such as post-mortem
brain tissue, cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF), and peripheral blood from psychiatric patients.
The results show dysregulation in some classes of miRNAs in patients with mood dis-
orders and psychosis [60–69], and with major depression [70–72], suggesting a common
dysregulation of these miRNAs in different neuropsychiatric conditions [22,73–78]. Some
authors described lower circulating miR-134 expression in the plasma of bipolar (type I)
patients without medication during a manic episode as compared with controls. Strazisar
and co-workers (2015) provided strong support for the involvement of miRNAs in the
pathogenesis of BD by analyzing 13 miRNA sequences in patients with bipolar disorder
and schizophrenia, and healthy controls [79]. A more recent study on peripheral blood sam-
ples [80] showed that a number of miRNAs were signiﬁcantly dysregulated in BD, either
overexpressed (miR-720-5p, miR-3158-3p, miR-4521-5p, miR-345-5p, miR-1973-5p, miR-
140-3p, miR-30d-5p, miR-330-3p, miR-330-5p, miR-378a-5p, miR-21-3p, and miR-29c-5p) or
downregulated (miR-1972-5p, miR-4440-5p, and miR-1915-5p). The same authors hypoth-
esized an implication of long-term potentiation, phosphatidylinositol signaling system,
neurotrophin signaling, and gap junction signaling in the pathogenesis of BD [81]. Ba-
nach et al. (2017) analyzed the expression level of miR-499, miR-708, and miR-1908 in the
leukocytes of bipolar patients during a depressive episode as compared with a remission
state. Signiﬁcant down-regulation of these miRNAs was detected in patients during a
depressive state, providing further insights into the pathophysiology of depression in
bipolar disorders [82].

3.1. MiR-144-5p

MiR-144 is a family of microRNAs found in mammals, including humans. In humans,
miR-144 has been characterized as a “common miRNA signature” [83] of several different
tumors. The gene encoding miR-144 is located on chromosome 11 and encompasses a
non-coding transcriptional unit comprising miR-451 [84]. The carboxy terminus of the
GATA4 transcription factor is thought to activate the transcription of miR-144 [85,86].
Sureban et al. suggested that DCAMKL-1, a microtubule-associated kinase expressed in
postmitotic neurons, negatively regulates miR-144 and Notch-1, being itself one of the
downstream targets of miR-144 [87]. The miR-144/451 gene is a direct transcriptional target
of GATA-1 [88], being itself a direct target of the same hematopoietic transcription factor.
Within this context, ChIP studies demonstrated that GATA-1 binds the miR 144/451 locus
at the promoter and an upstream enhancer at −2.8 kb, displacing GATA-2 and recruiting
the cofactor FOG-1 [88,89]. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of human
transcription factors are implicated in different cellular and tissue functions, and are
also involved in several diseases, such as neurological disorders. MEF2 proteins are co-
expressed with members of the GATA family in several other types of cells. The most
notable is the presence of MEF2 proteins with GATA-6 in non-muscle cells, including
those in the brain [88–90] (Figure 1). Given the co-expression of MEF2 and GATA factors,
the GATA-dependent MEF2 pathway could also be enrolled to understand the molecular
dysregulation occurring during BD.

In a study involving 16 primary health care centers, the plasma miR-144-5p levels
were associated with depressive symptoms, being signiﬁcantly higher after psychological
treatment (structured mindfulness-based group therapy) [91]. These results, even if the
study did not focus on BD patients, suggest that miRNA-144-5p can reﬂect one of the patho-
logical processes of depressive symptomatology [90]. Within this context, the signaling
pathways targeted by miR-144 include the protein kinase C (PKC), Wnt/β-catenin, and
PTEN pathways, all implicated in the development of depression [91]. Moreover, it has
recently been demonstrated that MiR-144 can inhibit the expression of Ataxin 1 (ATXN1) in
human cells, which in turn is associated with mental disorders, such as bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder [91].

3.2. MiR-134

Affective disorders are associated with reduced size of brain regions related to mood,
cognition, and neuronal atrophy, together with a synaptic loss [92]. Within this context,
miRNA-134 is speciﬁcally expressed in the brain, being able to counteract dendritic spine
formation in vitro [93]. Usually, miR-134 binds to the mRNA encoding the LIMK1 protein
kinase, a regulator of synaptic morphogenesis [23,90,94,95]. Moreover, the NAD-dependent
deacetylase sirtuin1 also plays an important role (SIRT1) in normal brain physiology and
neurological disorders [92]. Within this networking, sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is able to regulate
miR-134-5p, as the knockdown of SIRT1 in vitro increases miR-134-5p expression, which
in turn inhibits cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein expression [95]. Further-
more, miR-134-5p is also regulated by Mef2, which negatively regulates the number of
excitatory synapses in mature hippocampal neurons [96]. The inhibition of Mef2 in rat
hippocampal neurons followed by depolarization downregulates miR-134-5p, affecting its

These results, even if the study did not focus on BD patients, suggest that miRNA-144-5p can reflect one of the pathological processes of depressive symptomatology [90]. Within this context, the sig-naling pathways targeted by miR-144 include the protein kinase C (PKC), Wnt/β-catenin, and PTEN pathways, all implicated in the development of depression [91].

Furthermore, miR-134-5p is also regulated by Mef2, which negatively regulates the num-ber of excitatory synapses in mature hippocampal neurons [96]. The inhibition of Mef2 in rat hippocampal neurons followed by depolarization downregulates miR-134-5p, affect-ing its ability to regulate its targets, such as CREB. The downregulation of Mef2 greatly reduces the stimulation-induced expression of mir-134 and of the miR-379–410 miRNAs located in the same locus [64,95,96]. Fan et al. showed that the overexpression of miR-134 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10489

ability to regulate its targets, such as CREB. The downregulation of Mef2 greatly reduces
the stimulation-induced expression of mir-134 and of the miR-379–410 miRNAs located
in the same locus [64,95,96]. Fan et al. showed that the overexpression of miR-134 was
sufﬁcient to produce depressive-like behavior. In particular, different authors demonstrated
that, in BD patients without medication, the circulating plasma levels of miR-134 were
signiﬁcantly decreased as compared with those of control patients and patients under-
going drug treatment [97]. Following these observations, different authors claimed that
decreased plasma miR-134 levels may be directly associated with the pathophysiology
and severity of manic symptoms in BD, and may be considered a potential peripheral
marker of mania, associated with effective mood stabilizer treatment [97]. MiR-134 could
exert an effect on the neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells by inhibiting the GSK3β-Snail
path. GSK3 is involved in different pathways of neuronal development and functioning,
neuronal morphology, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter signaling, as well as in the
onset of several neurological disorders (targeting GSK3 signaling as a potential therapy
for neurodegenerative diseases and aging) [98]. It is well known that GSK3 is increased in
BD due to a serotonergic hypofunctionality (serotonin syndrome of depression) [99,100],
thus representing one of the therapeutic targets of lithium. GSK3β is a negative regulator
of MEF2 transcriptional activity in skeletal and cardiac muscle. This effect is indirectly
mediated by repressing the p38MAPK path, a well-known positive regulator of MEF2
activity. A variety of loss of function approaches revealed that the abrogation of GSK3β
signaling leads to greater transcriptional activity of MEF2, both in vitro and in vivo, in
myoblasts and cardiac myocardium. In addition, GSK3β inhibition increases p38MAPK
phosphorylation, which in turn increases MEF2 [63,99]. Here, we speculate that the increase
in mir-134 in BD patients after treatment with lithium is due to the following mechanism:
lithium inhibits GSK3, which increases Mef2, which is able to induce the expression of
mir-134 [23,95,101,102] (Figure 2).

MiR-34a MiR-34a is a regulator of central nervous system (CNS) plasticity.

3.3. MiR-34a

MiR-34a is a regulator of central nervous system (CNS) plasticity. Hippocampus-related
neurogenesis is a neural stem cell-based process that is important for several aspects of
cognitive abilities [103], also showing a potential therapeutic function by responding to local
neuronal loss in pathological events [104]. Within this context, it is noteworthy that the
neurogenic potential of NSCs in the adult Dentate Gyrus (DG) decreases throughout life [105].
MiR-34a is an intergenic miRNA located on human chromosome 1 between the coding
regions for G Protein-Coupled Receptor 157 (GPR157). In vivo, miR-34a imposes a negative
control on the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (GRM7) levels in primary hippocampal
culture. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in many neuropathological con-
ditions associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the anti-miR inhibitor
miRNA-34a signiﬁcantly increases the GRM7 protein levels, demonstrating that miR-34a
and GRM7 coexist, at least in cultured hippocampal neurons, and that endogenous miR-34a
is sufﬁcient to control the GRM7 protein levels [106,107].

These results, showing that miR-34a is down-regulated, lead to the predicted up-
regulation of its effector GRM7 in both in vivo and cultured hippocampal neurons by
lithium and VPA (Figure 3).

4. MicroRNAs, Stem Cells, and Response to Mood Stabilizers in Bipolar Disorder

Several studies focused on miRNA expression after treatment, particularly in response
to mood stabilizers, as shown in Table 2. The ﬁrst pre-clinical study in non-human (rats)
showed miRNA dysregulation in the hippocampus after chronic treatment with mood
stabilizers (MD), lithium, or valproate. Under-expression was proven for let-7b, let-7c,
miR-128a, miR-24a, miR-30c, miR-34a, and miR-221 while over-expression was found for
miR-144 [106]. In the same year, Chen and collaborators (2009) published results from
another pre-clinical study that aimed to evaluate miRNA expression after treatment with
lithium in lymphoblastoid cell lines. In particular, after 4 days of treatment, they observed
the over-expression of miR-221, miR-152, miR-15a, miR-155, miR-34a, and miR-181c, and
under-expression of miR-49. After 16 days of treatment, only the over-expression of
miR-34a, miR-152, miR-155, and miR-221 was detected. The authors hypothesized that Li
may have induced miRNA expression changes, leading to post-transcriptional regulation,
or it may have regulated the expression of genes involved in the transcription machinery,
including miRNAs. The important clinical implications following these ﬁndings are that
miRNAs responding to Li treatment may serve as biomarkers to understand different
treatment outcomes in individual patients [40]. In a more recent pre-clinical study aimed
at evaluating miRNA expression changes following glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in
cerebellar granule cell cultures (CGCs) of rats and neuroprotective treatment with lithium
and valproate, after treatment, miR-34a and miR-495 were signiﬁcantly down-regulated
while miR-182, miR-147, and miR-222 were over-expressed. They concluded that the
pathways associated with mood-stabilizer-regulated miRNAs were strongly associated with
the pathways implicated in both neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders [108].
Lithium (Li) is considered a key treatment for the acute and long-term management
of BD [7], but responses to treatment can be considerably different; indeed, only one-third
of patients treated with lithium are responders. Several clinical and biological factors are
linked to a favorable prophylactic response. The modulation of gene function by Li has
been suggested as a plausible mechanism, although the molecular mechanisms are not
well understood [106]. Li produces direct interactions on several regulatory sites, including
lithium-sensitive magnesium-dependent phosphatases (IMPase) and glycogen synthase
kinase 3 beta (GSK3β). GSK3β is a negative regulator of MEF2 transcriptional activity. MEF2
proteins are recruited to target promoters by GATA transcription factors, thus enhancing

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10489

their transcriptional activity. Li also modulates enzymes involved in the production of
GABA, dopamine, and glutamate (NMDA receptors), and influencing different signaling
systems, such as the ERK/MAPK, PKC, PI3K/Akt, and Wnt/b-catenin pathways.

Within this context, Li is able to improve the dysregulated mitochondrial function

found in IPSCs derived from BD patients [110,111].

Moreover, neuronal processes, such as neurite outgrowth, neurogenesis, remodeling
of neuronal structure and neuroprotection (BDNF and GDNF), and angiogenesis (VEGF),
are modulated by Li treatment. It is also noteworthy that ketamine, a drug with a rapid anti-
depressive effect, is involved in molecular neuroplasticity. It has also been hypothesized
that this drug may act through the regulation of miRNAs [112]. Some of these miRNAs
are critical modulators of central nervous system (CNS) plasticity. Among these, miR-34
contributes to and regulates the effects of lithium on the metabotropic glutamate receptor,
GRM7, both in vitro and in vivo [22,106,108]. Lithium-treated cells showed an increase
in the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 and a decrease in the expression of the pro-apoptotic
protein BAX. Li is also able to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species activating
the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2, thus increasing the expression of its target
genes. In contrast, NRF2 knockdown reduces the neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, and
antioxidant effects of lithium [113].

4.1. MiR-144

MiR-144 is widely expressed in the brain. Several studies demonstrated that miR-144
is involved in the response to mood stabilizer treatment [106], in stress responses [33,114],
and in diseases related to aging [115]. Long-term treatment with lithium results in a signiﬁ-
cant increase in miR-144 expression in the rat hippocampus, a region involved in mood
regulation [106]. In humans, miR-144 acts on the protein kinase C (PKC), Wnt/β-catenin,
and PTEN pathways. This miRNA can also inhibit the expression of Ataxin 1 (ATXN1),
a gene associated with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder.
Therefore, it has been identiﬁed as one of the potential targets for the development of new
antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder [14],
and for the development of mood stabilizers [53]. Figure 1 shows the biological mechanism.

4.2. MiR-134

It is well known that the miRNA-134 plasma levels begin to increase after 2 weeks,
being signiﬁcant after 4 weeks of lithium treatment in bipolar patients as compared with
untreated BD patients. Changes in the miR-134 blood levels are associated with the
recovery of secondary manic symptoms due to long-term treatment with mood stabilizers.
Furthermore, miR-134 is involved in the development of dendritic spines blocking the
expression of protein kinase, Limk1, which controls synaptic development, maturation,
and/or plasticity [23]. Within this network, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF),
a neurotrophin released in response to synaptic stimulation, is able to release the inhibition
of Limk1 translation imposed by miR-134 [23]. Therefore, it appears that miRNA-134 and
BDNF have opposite actions in the regulation of dendritic spine development. Increasing
the BDNF levels after treatment with mood stabilizers appears to inhibit Limk1–miR-134
mRNA binding. The authors hypothesized that this interaction may be associated with the
increased plasma levels of miRNA-134 (Figure 2).

4.3. MiR-34a

Several studies demonstrated that miR-34a is downregulated following Li neuropro-
tective treatment. This miRNA is neuroprotective in primary rat neuronal cultures, in
human SH-SY5Y cells [91] in the hippocampus [106], and in rodent cerebellar granule cell
cultures [78]. In vitro, the overexpression of miR-34a significantly reduces the mRNA levels
of BCL-2, NRF2, and BDNF in SH-SY5Y cells by inducing neuronal death, while GRM7
levels [60,93,106,108,109,113,116,117] are induced upon miR-34a downregulation. Currently,
the mechanisms of the effect of lithium on miR-34a expression are still unknown; never-
theless, different transcription factors, signaling pathways, and epigenetic changes might
be involved [41,118]. MiR-34a appears to be the link between the response to therapeutic
treatment and the molecular mechanisms [109]. MiR-34a, in non-neuronal cells, has been
shown to be a strong inhibitor of Wnt signaling and β-catenin-mediated transcription in
response to p53 activation [87]. Recent findings have shown that Actin/spectrin adaptor
protein (ANK3) positively regulates both the cadherin and Wnt signaling pathways, altering
β-catenin availability; loss of ANK3 function impacts neurogenesis [109], supporting the
importance of Wnt signaling in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Since lithium
also affects Wnt signaling, it could be hypothesized that high expression of miR-34a may be
important for the pathophysiology of BD via this pathway. It is believed that the delayed
therapeutic effects of mood stabilizers may be partly attributed to their ability to reduce
the miR-34a levels following chronic treatment [87]. Using IPA analysis, Husenbeger et al.
(2013) identified TGF-β signaling associated with miR-34a. TGF-β expression has been
implicated in several brain injuries (cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and AD) [95]
and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia [96]. TGF-β has
also been shown to provide neuronal protection against excitotoxic injury and, in cortical
neurons, TGF-β signaling is regulated by lithium through the inhibition of GSK-3 [100]. This
suggests that the neuroprotective effects of Li treatment may modulate TGF-β signaling via
the regulation of miRNA-34th in order to protect against glutamate insult [108].

5. Neural Stem Cells

In adulthood, new functional neurons can be generated from stem cells, a phenomenon
known as adult neurogenesis (AN). In animal models, reduced AN has been implicated in
the etiopathology of psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder [21].

Lithium has been used in modern psychiatry for the long-term treatment of bipo-
lar disorder, being also able to exert hematological, antiviral, and neuroprotective ef-
fects [119]. Lithium exerts an effect on neurogenesis by increasing the proliferation of
progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and increasing the mitotic activity
of Schwann cells [119].

Within this context, some authors reported that Li shows neuroprotective and neu-

rotrophic properties, which may be related to its clinical effectiveness [120].

In addition, therapeutic concentrations of Li have recently been shown to signiﬁ-
cantly increase neuronal proliferation and the differentiation of neural progenitor cells
in vitro [121,122].

It has been demonstrated that Li could promote NSC proliferation by activating the
Wnt signaling pathway in vitro. This effect provides an excellent target for the development
of new treatments for those diseases involving NSC dysfunction [123].

Among the different factors able to exert an effect on neural stem cells, miRNAs play
an important role both in neural development and in the adult brain, being dysregulated in
neuropsychiatric disorders, such as BD [124], as demonstrated by postmortem brain tissue
isolated from bipolar patients [125].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 10489

12 of 18

Within this context, some authors proposed that miR-34a is implicated in multiple eti-
ological factors and the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, along with neuronal development
and synaptogenesis.

Using human neuronal progenitor cells derived from iPSCs, they showed that an

increase in miR-34a expression impairs neuronal differentiation [109].

Neuronal differentiation and cell morphology, synapse function, and electrophysiolog-
ical maturation are signiﬁcantly impaired in NSCs upon miR-34 overexpression, which is
usually faintly expressed during physiological neurogenesis [126].

The overexpression of miR-34a results in increased postmitotic neurons and the elon-
gation of neurites in mouse NSCs. A decrease in its expression resulted in the inhibition of
neuronal differentiation. MiR-34a would induce neuronal differentiation by targeting the
Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) gene, negatively regulating cell proliferation [127,128].

MiR-34a blocks proliferating PC12 cells in G1 stages, a pre-requisite for neuronal
differentiation, and is upregulated in aged brain cells, suggesting that increased expression
of miR-34 is necessary to maintain mature neurons in the non-proliferative stage [129].

Another miRNA related to neurogenesis and bipolar disorder is mir-134. The miR-
134 plasma levels are downregulated in patients with BD without medication, being
associated with the pathophysiology and severity of manic symptoms in BD, since, after
drug treatment, the levels increase [93].

In particular, in the central nervous system, miR-134 plays an essential role in em-
bryonic stem cell proliferation and differentiation by suppressing Nanog and inducing
neural development. Moreover, the upregulation of this miRNA was described during
oligodendrogliomas (ODG) and glioblastomas (GBM), suggesting its possible involvement
in brain tumor progression [130].

MiR-134 is also able to inﬂuence the regulation of dendritic spine volume and synapse
formation in mature rat hippocampal neurons in vitro, acting on LimK1 protein kinase [23].
The role of miR-134 in neuroplasticity is also inferred by its capability to promote neural
progenitor proliferation, while counteracting Chrdl-1-induced apoptosis and Dcx-induced
differentiation in vitro [131].

6. Clinical Implications and Limitations

BD results from the complex interaction of multiple susceptible genes with environmen-
tal factors, resulting in not only mood disorder, but also a constellation of cognitive, motor,
autonomic, endocrine, and sleep/wake abnormalities. The discovery of the role of miRNAs
in diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response/resistance may improve clinical approaches
and prognosis in psychiatric patients based on current concepts of personalized medicine
applied to mental disorders, ‘precision psychiatry’ [132,133]. MiRNA expression, also in-
duced by Li treatment, leads to post-transcriptional regulation. Li itself has been shown
to regulate the expression of genes related to BD, including miRNAs. Finally, the selected
miRNAs targeted by Li treatment can serve as biomarkers to understand different treatment
outcomes in different patients. Identifying target miRNAs and their regulated transcripts
may be important to further unravel the mechanism of action of Li and disclose a novel
future role of neural stem cells in brain homeostasis as a promising tool for stem-cell-based
therapy and as a promising possible therapeutic tool suitable for BD therapy.

post-mortem and circulating) performed in bipolar patients were considered, including
studies on patients being treated with lithium. Studies focusing exclusively on other
psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or major depression, were excluded. The data
incorporated papers published until June 2022.

8. Future Perspectives

Different studies revealed altered miRNA expression levels in BD, suggesting that the
synergic effects of different miRNAs could contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.
MiRNAs appear to be tightly regulated in adult human brains, with little inter-individual
variability. Implementing the most sensitive and precise technical methodologies could
be crucial in the precise detection of different expressions among sample groups. Future
studies with other cohorts are needed to replicate current ﬁndings and determine whether
miRNA alterations in BD are widespread throughout the brain or restricted to speciﬁc
brain regions [65]. It is clear that any future application of plasma miRNA detection for
diagnostic or prognostic purposes will depend on the reproducibility and reliability of
the results. This could be helpful in the identiﬁcation of potential BD patients and of
the effective targets, which could represent a cure even for those who are refractory to
conventional treatment [78].

9. Conclusions

This review summarizes the present knowledge of microRNAs involved in BD and their
expression and function, together with neural stem cells and their correlation with the altered
neuroplasticity observed in BD. Future studies with large cohorts are needed to identify the
genes and metabolic pathways regulated by these miRNAs to provide new information and to
elucidate the pathogenesis of this disease. We propose several cellular mechanisms involving
lithium, miR-134, miR-144, miR-34, and neural stem cells as novel and promising diagnostic
and therapeutic tools for a personalized clinical setting in bipolar disorder.
