Background 

Acupuncture,  with  many  categories  such  as  traditional 
acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, and 
acupoint  injection,  has  been shown  to  be relatively safe 
with few adverse effects. It is accessible and inexpensive, 
at least in China, and is likely to be widely used there for 
psychotic symptoms.

contacted authors of studies when necessary. We analyzed 
binary outcomes using a standard estimation of risk ratio 
(RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). For continu-
ous  data,  we  calculated  mean  differences  with  95%  CI. 
For  homogeneous  data  we  used  fixed-effect  model.  We 
assessed  risk  of  bias  for  included  studies  and  created  a 
summary of findings table using GRADE.

objectives 

To review the effects of acupuncture, alone or in combina-
tion treatments compared with placebo (or no treatment) 
or any other treatments for people with schizophrenia or 
related psychoses.

Search Methods

We  searched  the  Cochrane  Schizophrenia  Group  Trials 
Register  (February  2012)  and  inspected  references  of 
all  identified  studies.  We  contacted  relevant  authors  for 
additional information.

Selection Criteria 

We  included  all  relevant  randomized  controlled  trials 
involving  people  with  schizophrenia-like  illnesses,  com-
paring  acupuncture  added  to  standard  dose  antipsychot-
ics  with  standard  dose  antipsychotics  alone,  acupuncture 
added to low dose antipsychotics with standard dose anti-
psychotics,  acupuncture  with  antipsychotics,  acupuncture 
added  to  traditional  chinese  medicine  (TCM)  drug  with 
TCM drug, acupuncture with TCM drug, electric acupunc-
ture convulsive therapy with electroconvulsive therapy.

Data Collection and analysis

We reliably extracted data from all included studies, dis-
cussed  any  disagreement,  documented  decisions  and 

Main results

After an update search in 2012, the review now includes 
30 studies testing different forms of acupuncture across 
6  different  comparisons.  All  studies  were  at  moderate 
risk  of  bias.  When  acupuncture  plus  standard  antipsy-
chotic  treatment  was  compared  with  standard  antipsy-
chotic treatment alone people were at less risk of being 
“not  improved”  (n  =  244,  3  RCTs,  medium-term  RR 
0.40  CI  0.28–0.57,  very  low  quality  evidence,  figure  1). 
Mental  state  findings  were  mostly  consistent  with  this 
finding  as  was  time  in  hospital  (n  =  120,  1  RCT,  days 
MD −16.00 CI −19.54 to −12.46, moderate quality evi-
dence). If anything, adverse effects were less for the acu-
puncture  group  (eg,  central  nervous  system,  insomnia, 
short-term, n = 202, 3 RCTs, RR 0.30 CI 0.11–0.83, low 
quality  evidence).  When  acupuncture  was  added  to  low 
dose  antipsychotics  and  this  was  compared  with  stan-
dard  dose  antipsychotic  drugs  relapse  was  less  in  the 
experimental group (n = 170, 1 RCT, long-term RR 0.57 
CI 0.37–0.89, very low quality evidence) but there was no 
difference  for  the  outcome  of  “not  improved.”  Again 
mental  state  findings  were  mostly  consistent  with  the 
latter. Incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms—akathi-
sia, were less for those in the acupuncture added to low 
dose antipsychotics group (n = 180, 1 RCT, short-term 
RR  0.03  CI  0.00–0.49,  low  quality  evidence)—as  dry 
mouth, blurred vision, and tachycardia. When acupunc-
ture  was  compared  with  antipsychotic  drugs  of  known 
efficacy in standard doses, there were equivocal data for 
outcomes such as “not improved” using different global

state  criteria.  Traditional  acupuncture  added  to  tradi-
tional  chinese  medicine  (TCM)  drug  had  benefit  over 
use of TCM drug alone (n = 360, 2 RCTs, RR no clini-
cally  important  change  0.11  CI  0.02–0.59,  low  quality 
evidence))  but  when  traditional  acupuncture  was  com-
pared  with  TCM  drug  directly  there  was  no  significant 
difference in the short term. However, we found that par-
ticipants given electroacupuncture were significantly less 
likely to experience a worsening in global state (n = 88, 1 
RCT, short-term RR 0.52 CI 0.34–0.80, low quality evi-
dence). In the one study that compared electric acupunc-
ture  convulsive  therapy  with  electroconvulsive  therapy 
there  was  significantly  different  rates  of  spinal  fracture 
between the groups (n = 68, 1 RCT, short-term RR 0.33 
CI 0.14–0.81, low quality evidence). Attrition in all stud-
ies was minimal. No studies reported death, engagement 

with services, satisfaction with treatment, quality of life, 
or economic outcomes.

authors’ Conclusions

Limited  evidence  suggests  that  acupuncture  may  have 
some  antipsychotic  effects  as  measured  on  global  and 
mental state with few adverse effects. Better designed large 
studies  are  needed  to  fully  and  fairly  test  the  effects  of 
acupuncture  for  people  with  schizophrenia.  Full  details 
of the review are published on the Cochrane Library.1
