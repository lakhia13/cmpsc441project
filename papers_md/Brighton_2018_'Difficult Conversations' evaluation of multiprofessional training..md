AbstrAct
Objectives  Evidence-based communication 
skills training for health and social care 
professionals is essential to improve the care 
of seriously ill patients and their families. We 
aimed to evaluate the self-reported impact of 
‘Difficult Conversations’, a multidisciplinary half-
day interactive workshop, and gain feedback to 
inform future development and evaluation.
Methods  Service evaluation using questionnaire 
data collected before and immediately after 
workshops from February 2015 to August 
2016 regarding participant self-assessed 
confidence, knowledge and skills. Qualitative 
free-text comments provided feedback about 
the workshop and were subjected to content 
analysis.
results  Of 886 workshop participants, 655 
completed baseline questionnaires and 714 
postworkshop questionnaires; 550 were 
matched pairs. Participants were qualified or 
trainee general practitioners (34%), community 
nurses and care coordinators (32%), social 
care professionals (7%), care home staff (6%), 
advanced practice/specialist nurses (5%), care 
workers (5%) and allied health professionals 
(3%). All groups demonstrated significant 
increases in mean self-assessed confidence (2.46, 
95% CI 2.41 to 2.51; to 3.20, 95% CI 3.17 to 
3.24; P<0.001), knowledge (2.22, 95% CI 2.17 
to 2.27; to 3.18, 95% CI 3.14 to 3.22; P<0.001) 
and skills (2.37, 95% CI 2.32 to 2.42; to 3.09, 
95% CI 3.05 to 3.12; P<0.001). Qualitative 
findings showed participants valued role play, 
the communication framework acronym and 
opportunities for discussion. They commended 
workshop facilitators’ skills, the safe atmosphere 
and interprofessional learning. Suggested 
improvements included more prepared role play 
and greater coverage of the taught topics.
conclusions  ‘Difficult Conversations’ 
workshops were associated with improvements 
in participants’ self-assessed confidence, 
knowledge, and skills. Our findings identify 
workshop characteristics that are acceptable 
to multidisciplinary trainees. Further testing 

is warranted to determine effectiveness and 
accurately identify workshop components 
leading to change.

IntrOductIOn
Clear,  compassionate  communication  is 
important  to  patients  with  life-limiting 
disease and their families.1 This is reflected 
in  policy  commitments  to  improve  this 
area  of  care.2  However,  poor  experi-
ences  of  communication  remain  a  prin-
ciple area of complaint within the British 
National  Health  Service  (NHS)3  and  are 
associated  with  patient4  and  caregiver5 
distress and poor staff outcomes.6 There-
fore,  providing  effective,  evidence-based 
communication  skills  training  remains  a 
priority.

‘Difficult  Conversations’  is  a  multidis-
ciplinary,  half-day  interactive  workshop 
developed  by  experienced  palliative  and 
end  of  life  care  (EoLC)  clinicians  (CM-S 
and  JN).  It  aims  to  equip  health  and 
social care professionals with the knowl-
edge,  confidence  and  skills  required  to 
have  potentially  difficult  conversations 
with patients with serious and life-threat-
ening illness and their families. This may 
include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  conver-
sations  around  diagnosis,  deterioration 
of  health,  and  advance  care  planning. 
In  brief,  the  workshop  commences  with 
an  interactive  seminar,  video  examples 
and  group  work  covering  the  principles 
of  breaking  bad  news,  and  introducing 
the 
frame-
work. The ‘SCARS’ acronym presents an 
‘aide  memoire’  to  help  navigate  difficult 
conversations:  Setting,  Communicate 
with  kindness,  Ask,  Respond  and  reflect 
and Summary and plan. Following agree-
ment of ground rules, participants engage 
in role play sessions. Finally, participants 
discuss their roles and responsibilities and 
learn about mental capacity and advance

This  format  reflects  other  communication  skills 
training7–9  but  uses  a  unique  communication  frame-
work and targets multidisciplinary groups.10

‘Difficult  Conversations’  has  trained  over  1600 
professionals  and  is  endorsed  by  the  British  General 
Medical Council and Royal College of General Practi-
tioners South London Faculty. However, effectiveness 
has  not  been  externally  evaluated.  Here  we  report  a 
service  evaluation  examining  the  participant-assessed 
impact  of  ‘Difficult  Conversations’  and  summarising 
their feedback to inform future workshop refinement 
and evaluation.

MethOds
design, recruitment and data collection
This  service  evaluation  uses  a  pre-post  test  design. 
Data  were  collected  from  ‘Difficult  Conversations’ 
workshops from February 2015 to August 2016, across 
community settings in South and North West London 
serving a population of 4.7 million.11

Participants  completed  a  questionnaire  before 
the  workshop  (baseline)  and  immediately  after.  The 
precourse  questionnaire  asked  participants  to  rate 
their  confidence,  knowledge  and  skills  in  conducting 
difficult conversations (eg, breaking bad news or about 
EoLC)  with  patients  and  carers  on  a  4-point  Likert 
scale  (eg,  from  ‘not  confident’  to  ‘very  confident’). 
The  postcourse  questionnaire  reassessed  these  three 
domains, and asked additional questions regarding the 
likelihood the workshop would improve their practice, 
and whether they would recommend the workshop to 
a  colleague.  Free-text  questions  asked  participants  to 
provide  feedback  regarding  what  they  enjoyed  about 
the workshop and how it could be improved.

Analysis
Questionnaires that included participants’ names were 
matched and assigned an anonymous paired ID prior 
to  analysis.  Differences  between  matched  baseline 
and postworkshop scores were analysed using paired 
t-tests.  Independent  t-tests  were  used  to  compare 
scores  between  matched  and  unmatched  question-
naires at baseline and postworkshop. Due to concerns 
regarding treating the 4-point Likert scale data as para-
metric interval data, non-parametric alternatives were 
also  used  to  check  results  with  a  more  conservative 

Table 1  Self-assessed confidence, knowledge and skills

method.  Due  to  multiple  testing,  Bonferroni  correc-
tions were applied.

Free-text data from all postworkshop questionnaires 
were  summarised  using  content  analysis.12  Themes 
were  inductively  identified  for  each  question,  and 
each  answer  was  coded  at  one  or  more  themes  as 
appropriate.

results
self-assessed confidence, knowledge and skills
Of 886 workshop participants, 655 (74%) completed 
baseline  questionnaires  and  714  (81%)  postwork-
shop  questionnaires;  550  represented  matched  pairs. 
The  majority  of  participants  were  general  practi-
tioners  (qualified  GPs:  n=159,  29%;  trainee  GPs: 
n=29, 5%), community nurses and care coordinators 
(n=175, 32%), social care professionals (n=39, 7%), 
care  home  staff  (n=31,  6%),  advanced  practice  and 
specialist nurses (n=30, 5%), care workers (n=30, 5%) 
and  allied  health  professionals  (n=18,  3%).  Others 
(n=39, 7%) included a range of professions including 
hospital doctors, managers and receptionists. For more 
information on these staff groups, please see  box S1 
in online supplementary 1.

Self-rated  confidence,  knowledge  and  skills 
in 
conducting  difficult  conversations  with  patients  and 
their  families  all  increased  significantly  from  baseline 
(table  1).  This  remained  true  when  data  for  each  staff 
group  were  analysed  separately.  The  largest  improve-
ments in confidence, knowledge and skills were observed 
for care workers (baseline means: 2.27, 1.97 and 2.07; 
mean change scores: 1.07, 1.33 and 1.07, respectively), 
while the smallest were for qualified GPs’ confidence and 
skills (baseline means: 2.63, 2.58; mean change scores: 
0.61 and 0.53, respectively) and trainee GPs’ knowledge 
(baseline mean: 2.24; mean change score 0.72).

Scores  for  matched  questionnaires  (included  in  the 
paired  analysis)  and  unmatched  questionnaires  (that 
could  not  be  included  in  the  paired  analysis)  did 
not  differ  significantly  at  baseline  or  postworkshop 
on  confidence,  knowledge  and  skills,  or  postcourse 
perceived  impact  on  practice.  However,  scores  for 
unmatched  questionnaires  were  significantly  lower 
than matched questionnaires as to whether participants 
would recommend the workshop to colleagues (mean 
3.74, 95% CI 3.67 to 3.81 vs mean 3.85, 95% CI 3.82 
to 3.88; t=2.872, P=0.004).

Of  714  postworkshop  questionnaires,  666  included 
views  on  what  participants  valued  about  the  work-
shop. Many positive comments were about the inter-
active  teaching  methods  (n=102)  and  enjoying  the 
workshops  (n=88).  Participants  particularly  valued 
role  play  (n=168),  the  ‘SCARS’  communication 
framework (n=104), opportunities for discussion and 
group  work  (n=80)  and  the  videos  (n=43).  Many 
commented  on  the  relevance  of  the  topics  discussed 
(n=79),  highlighting  the  following  as  particularly 
useful:  Do  Not  Attempt  –  Cardio-Pulmonary  Resus-
citation  (DNA-CPR)  orders,  mental  capacity,  and 
advance  care  planning.  Participants  stated  the  work-
shop  provided  knowledge 
(n=112),  confidence 
(n=27) and skills (n=17). They praised the expertise 
of the workshop facilitators (n=64), noted the benefits 
of  interprofessional  learning  (n=36)  and  spoke  posi-
tively of the safe and informal atmosphere (n=36).

There were 227 suggestions on how the workshop 
could be improved. The most related to improvements 
in  the  role  play  (n=59):  requesting  more  time  spent 
on  this  activity  (n=21;  n=5  requested  less)  and  26 
suggesting  the  scenarios  be  preprepared  and  specific, 
rather  than  generated  with  participants  during  the 
workshop. There were also requests for longer work-
shops (n=45) and to focus on specific topics in greater 
detail (n=43), including advance care planning, mental 
capacity and DNA-CPR orders.

Almost  all  participants  completing  the  postwork-
shop questionnaire said the course was likely (33.1%) 
or highly likely (66.1%) to improve their practice and 
that they were likely (17.1%) or highly likely (82.6%) 
to recommend the workshop to colleagues.

dIscussIOn
We  found  increases  in  the  self-reported  confidence, 
knowledge and skills of those attending the ‘Difficult 
Conversations’ workshops. These increases were most 
prominent  among  care  workers  who,  in  our  ageing 
population, will likely play an increasing role in gener-
alist  palliative  and  EoLC  for  the  frail  elderly.13  This 
may reflect less previous training in this area, compared 
with those working in, for example, general practice. 
Alternatively, this may relate to differing training needs 
and  expectations  across  disciplines.  Further  work  is 
needed to understand the impact of these differences 
on training outcomes. However, regardless of profes-
sional group, all participants reported significant bene-
fits of the workshop.

Participants  particularly  valued  the  role  play,  the 
‘SCARS’  communication  framework  and  opportuni-
ties for discussion and group work. They also noted 
the  skills  and  sensitivity  of  the  facilitators,  the  safe 
learning atmosphere and the opportunity for interpro-
fessional  learning.  These  findings  match  evaluations 
of  other  similar  training  courses  (ie,  short  duration 
workshops  using  role  play  and  a  communication 

Short report

framework), which also report self-assessed improve-
ments  in  participants’  abilities.7–9  The  value  partici-
pants consistently place on role play and discussion,9 
communication  frameworks8  and  providing  a  safe 
atmosphere  to  learn  and  practice7  suggests  these 
could be key elements of acceptability. To what extent 
they represent ‘active ingredients’ of the intervention 
warrants  further  exploration.  Although  interprofes-
sional learning is rare in EoLC communication skills 
trainings,10  it  was  viewed  favourably  by  participants 
attending  the  ‘Difficult  Conversations’  workshop. 
How this relates to the learning experience should be 
tested.

This  evaluation  has  limitations.  First,  there  might 
be  unknown  differences  between  the  majority  (80%) 
of  participants  who  shared  names  on  their  question-
naires  (facilitating  matching)  and  those  who  did  not. 
Second,  the  uncontrolled  nature  of  the  evaluation 
means there might be alternative explanations for the 
increase in self-assessed abilities. Third, the questions 
asked of participants have not been psychometrically 
tested.  Moreover,  we  do  not  know  whether  there  is 
a lasting impact beyond the immediate postworkshop 
measurement,  nor  whether  the  perceived  increase  in 
confidence, knowledge and skills has beneficial effects 
on patients and their families. Future evaluation would 
therefore  benefit  from  a  controlled  design,  longer 
term  follow-up  and  use  of  validated  staff-reported 
and patient/carer-reported outcome measurement.10 14 
Such  work  should  be  implemented  in  line  with  the 
MORECare  statement  on  evaluating  complex  inter-
ventions in EoLC.15

This  service  evaluation  of  the  ‘Difficult  Conversa-
tions’ workshop indicates a self-reported improvement 
in participants’ confidence, knowledge and skills. This 
favourable finding encourages continuation and devel-
opment  of  the  course  alongside  rigorous  evaluation, 
in  addition  to  exploring  potential  mechanisms  of 
action.  Based  on  our  initial  findings,  we  recommend 
other  communication  skills  courses  consider  their 
acceptability in terms of: the value of interprofessional 
learning,  the  use  of  communication  frameworks  and 
role play, opportunities for open discussion and a safe 
learning environment.
