Cancer and Stress:
Understanding the Connections
and Interventions

Abstract: Stress is ubiquitous in
our modern society and contributes
to many disease states. This
narrative review describes the effect
of stress/distress on cancer
development and progression.
Seminal randomized controlled
trials, systematic reviews/meta-
analyses, and distress management
guidelines from the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN), the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the
Society for Integrative
LinearOncology (SIO) are
highlighted. We describe the
physiological effects of distress,
distress assessment, and
management. Psychological
treatments are summarized.
Evidence-based lifestyle
modiﬁcations and integrative
therapies are reviewed in detail,
including mindfulness-based
techniques, yoga, guided imagery,
breathing techniques, hypnosis,
exercise, music therapy, qigong/Tai
Chi, eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing, and improving
sleep and heart rate variability.
Recognition and treatment of
distress can improve quality of life.
More research is needed to
determine the effects of managing

distress on cancer outcomes, as well
as the best type and duration of
intervention, noting that the
beneﬁts of interventions may be

chronic, severe, or one cannot cope
with these events, distress ensues.
Distress can have adverse effects on
quality of life and cancer outcomes.

Introduction

In 2024, over 2 million people will
be diagnosed with cancer, and over
600 000 will die of cancer in the
United States.1 All patients with
a cancer diagnosis, regardless of
stage, are likely to experience stress
or distress due to the nature of the
diagnosis and the adverse effects of
the disease and its treatment. Stress
can be considered a normal reaction
to life events, but when the stress is

This narrative review describes the
impact of distress on cancer
development and outcomes and
describes interventions designed to
mitigate distress. National
guidelines, systematic reviews/
meta-analyses, and randomized
controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are
highlighted. Psychological
interventions and lifestyle/
integrative therapies are reviewed.

Deﬁnition of Stress/
Distress

In the context of cancer, Antoni

a reaction in the brain (stress
perception) and, in turn, activates
physiologic ﬁght-or-ﬂight responses in
the body (stress response).”2 This
understanding of stress is crucial in the
context of cancer, as it helps us
comprehend the distress experienced
by cancer patients, which can range
from mild (i.e., common feelings of
vulnerability) to disabling.3 The
assessment of distress will be covered
below. The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) deﬁnes
distress as: “a multifactorial unpleasant
experience of a psychological (i.e.,
cognitive, behavioral, emotional),
social, spiritual, and/or physical
nature that may interfere with one’s
ability to cope effectively with cancer,
its physical symptoms, and its
treatment. Distress extends along
a continuum, ranging from common
normal feelings of vulnerability,
sadness, and fears to problems that
can become disabling, such as
depression, anxiety, panic, social
isolation, and existential and spiritual
crisis.”4 Distress can also be associated
with physical symptoms such as
fatigue, digestive issues, and insomnia.5
As described within the 2024 NCCN
Distress Management (DM) guidelines,
the “prevalence of psychological
distress in individuals varies by the type
and stage of cancer and by patient age,
gender, and race.” In a study of 4496
patients with cancer, Zabora et al6
reported that the overall prevalence of
distress was 35.1%, which varied from
29.6% for patients with gynecologic
cancers to 43.4% for patients with lung
cancer. Overall, research indicates that
20% to 62% of patients with newly
diagnosed and recurrent cancer show
clinically signiﬁcant levels of distress.7-10
There are known risk factors for
developing moderate to severe distress,
as in Table 1.

Effects of Stress on the
Body

The physiological components of

the stress response, commonly
termed “ﬂight, ﬁght, or freeze,” are

predominant in two systems: a fast
response mediated by the
sympathetic-adrenal-medullary
(SAM) axis and a slow response
mediated by the hypothalamus-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.11 This
response is a combination of
physiological changes that helps an
individual appropriately respond to
a threat, ensuring survival. When the
SAM axis is triggered, it increases
secretion of the catecholamines
epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Circulating epinephrine and
norepinephrine interact with
α-adrenergic and β-adrenergic
receptors, driving the ﬂight or ﬁght
response.11 The slow stress
response, the HPA axis, is activated
when the amygdala sends a distress
signal to the hypothalamus, leading
it to release corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF). CRF then triggers the
anterior pituitary gland to release
adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH). ACTH, in turn, stimulates
the release of glucocorticoids, such
as cortisol, from the adrenal glands.
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that
regulates behavioral, cardiovascular,
and immune responses.12 Activation
of the SAM axis and the HPA axis
affects all body organ systems,
including the nervous system, the
cardiovascular system, the
endocrine system, the respiratory
system, the gastrointestinal system,
the musculoskeletal system, and the
reproductive system. The
physiological changes due to the
impacts on these organ systems are
as follows: increased heart rate and
redirection of blood to large
muscles, increased respiratory rate
allowing for improved oxygenation
of cells and reduction in carbon
dioxide waste, increased production
of stress hormones, glycogenolysis
and gluconeogenesis allowing cells
to receive adequate nutrition,
increased muscle contraction and
decreased sexual desire and
function in the face of chronic
stress.11 While acute stress is
essential to human survival, chronic

stress (or distress) is associated with
several chronic diseases, including
cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
gastrointestinal disease, and
psychiatric diseases. Systemic low-
grade chronic inﬂammation,
measured by elevated plasma pro-
inﬂammatory biomarkers such as
interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and C-
reactive protein (CRP), have been
hypothesized to be the mechanism
of action driving these disease
states.13

How Do We Measure the
Stress Response/
Distress?

Patient Self-Report

Patient self-report measures
include ultrashort (e.g., NCCN
Distress Thermometer, Patient
Health Questionnaire 2), short (e.g.,
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7
(GAD-7), Patient Health
Questionnauire-9 (PHQ-9)), and
long (e.g., Beck Depression
Inventory-II, Proﬁle of Mood State)
questionnaires. Although many
questionnaires that assess distress
are psychometrically valid,
sensitivity and speciﬁcity can vary
widely by measure. Sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and content validity are
higher in longer, psychometrically
well-constructed questionnaires,14
while brief questionnaires (1-4
questions) can be adequate for
ruling out distress.15 Therefore, it is
important to consider the pros and
cons of each questionnaire to
optimize tool selection, including
downstream burdens on patients
and clinical systems (e.g., false
negative screens send distressed
patients through cancer treatment
with untreated distress and its
associated symptom burden).
Furthermore, measures of distress
extend beyond those commonly
used in the clinical setting (e.g.,
measures of depression and anxiety)
to include more basic,
transdiagnostic, dimensional

Biomarkers of Distress
Inﬂammatory biomarkers (e.g.,
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and
gene expression) are commonly
linked to stressful life events such as
cancer and associated measures of
psychological response (i.e.,
distress).2 Distress can trigger
chronic inﬂammation (a shift from
predominantly antiviral to pro-
inﬂammatory immune orientation),
moderated by psychological
factors.17 Animal models of chronic
stress document activation of
microglia, neuroinﬂammation,
blood-brain barrier (BBB)
permeability, allowing pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines into the CNS
(mediating depression), transport of
peripheral monocytes to stress-
sensitive neural regions, and
increased metastasis associated with
distress.18 Meta-analyses of patients
with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) or depression have
examined over 20 soluble/
peripheral blood-derived
inﬂammatory mediators,

documenting elevations in serum
levels of IL-6, TNFa, CRP, IL-3, IL-12,
IL-18, sIL-2R (possibly IL-1B) and
reduced IL-4 when compared to
control groups.19,20

Salivary cortisol has been used to
detect abnormal HPA axis signaling.
Cortisol has a diurnal pattern, with
the highest level occurring about
30 min after awakening and
declining throughout the day.
Various abnormalities include
a ﬂattened slope (low awakening
spike), abnormal cortisol awakening
response (CAR), abnormal total
cortisol (AUC), and high evening
cortisol levels.21-25 Salivary cortisol
testing has mainly been used as
a research tool.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is
a valuable surrogate for distress/
autonomic dysfunction in the
research setting.26 It predicts
morbidity and mortality for various
health conditions, including
cardiovascular disease27-29 and
cancer30-32 in many but not all
studies.33 HRV is deﬁned as the
ﬂuctuation in the interval between
heartbeats34 and is a non-invasive
method to determine sympathetic/
parasympathetic tone as a biomarker
for well-being, resiliency, and
adaptability.35-37 The beat-to-beat
variability is calculated, with higher

HRV corresponding to more
“coherence” or an optimal balance
between parasympathetic/
sympathetic tone or more resiliency.
Many complex metrics are used to
measure HRV, which are time-
dependent and provide different
information. ECG is the gold-
standard measurement of HRV, but
various monitors (i.e., watches, chest
bands, rings, heart math) are also
available for consumers and
research.38,39 HRV can be affected
by heart rate, medications, physical
activity, breathing, age, sex, overall
health, and emotions, thus making
interpretation of many widely
available/over-the-counter devices
difﬁcult.39,40

Does Distress Cause or
Contribute to the
Development of Cancer?

Though it is challenging to study

the impact of distress on cancer
development or incidence,41–45
seminal and analytic studies largely
conclude that while distress does not
cause cancer, it does contribute to
cancer progression.2,46,47 Existing
studies have been marked by
methodologic limitations, including
difﬁculty in controlling for
confounders, non-prospective

designs, and heterogeneity in
measuring anxiety/depression. An
older meta-analysis did show that
depression was associated with a small
increased risk of developing cancer
(RR 1.15). However, the studies were
extremely heterogeneous, as well as
variable in controlling for confounders
(such as smoking and alcohol use).48
Another large meta-analysis of 51
cohort studies also showed that
depression and anxiety were
associated with a small increased risk
of cancer incidence (RR 1.13); the
authors state that results should be
interpreted with caution due to
signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the
included studies.47 A recent meta-
analysis from the Netherlands using
individual patient data and validated
measures for anxiety and depression
did not ﬁnd any evidence that baseline
anxiety or depression was associated
with cancer incidence.49 The study
controlled for age, sex, smoking
history, alcohol use, exercise
frequency, and cancer-speciﬁc risk
factors. When looking at speciﬁc
cancer types, depression and anxiety
were associated with an increased risk
of lung cancer in the minimally
adjusted models (Hazard ratios (HR)
1.12-1.60). However, this is likely due
to increased smoking in patients with
depression. This study did not include
patients with chronic anxiety or
depression or a history of anxiety and
depression; other studies have shown
that chronic depression may be a risk
factor for cancer development.50,51

Another recent meta-analysis of 22

cohorts and over 400 000 patients
examined whether psychosocial
factors (depression diagnosis,
depression symptoms, anxiety
diagnosis, anxiety symptoms,
perceived social support, loss
events, general distress, neuroticism,
and relationship status) interacted
with or modiﬁed the effects of health
behaviors (smoking, alcohol use,
physical activity, body mass index,
sedentary behavior, sleep quality,
sleep duration) that are known to
affect cancer risk. They found that

the “behavioral risk proﬁle for
cancer incidence was similar with
and without psychosocial stress,”
meaning that stress does not
independently worsen the negative
effects of unhealthy behaviors. This
study, however, only looked at stress
and behavioral factors at one point in
time; further studies should examine
longer-term stress and its
relationship with behaviors and
cancer risk.52

Adverse childhood events (ACEs)
such as neglect, physical or sexual
abuse, household challenges, and
other traumatic experiences have been
associated with chronic health
problems, including cancer, mental
health issues, and behavioral risk
factors (smoking, obesity, drug
use).53-55 Patients exposed to more
ACEs have more fatigue and
experience greater mental health
issues during cancer treatment.56 A
systematic review of 12 publications
showed that higher ACE scores were
signiﬁcantly associated with the risk of
any cancer development.57 Notably, in
this and similar studies, high ACE
scores were also associated with
adverse health behaviors (smoking,
alcohol use, etc) that are known risk
factors for cancer development, which
are difﬁcult to control in study design.58
The mechanisms of how ACEs may
contribute to cancer or other disease
development may be related to these
adverse health behaviors, as well as
increased inﬂammation,59,60 shortened
telomeres,61 or altered/maladapted
stress responses.62 More research must
be conducted to determine the
mechanisms of such associations and if
interventions can lead to prevention
and/or improved outcomes.

Effects of Distress on
Cancer Outcomes

Preclinical Models

Preclinical models have shown that
stress can impact multiple pathways
that can lead to cancer growth and
metastasis. Distress can increase
cortisol and norepinephrine, which

may enhance tumor growth and
metastasis, enhance angiogenesis,
increase resistance to
chemotherapy, and negatively affect
the immune system.63,64 He et al64
showed that chronic stress alters the
tumor microenvironment in mice in
several ways, including reduced T-
cell inﬁltration, increased neutrophil
inﬁltration, and ﬁbronectin
accumulation. They also found that
glucocorticoid release with chronic
stress causes increased neutrophil
extracellular trap formation and
promotes metastasis. Effects on
natural killer cells (NKC) have also
been demonstrated—in patients
with breast cancer who had
abnormal cortisol patterns, the
number and activity of NKC
decreased.21

Effect of Stress on Cancer
Recurrence and Mortality

Evaluating the effect of distress on
cancer outcomes is difﬁcult. There
are many different methods of
assessing distress, as well as multiple
diagnoses associated with distress,
such as depression/anxiety/PTSD,
that are used in many studies. Also,
many risk factors need to be
controlled, including cancer-speciﬁc
prognostic features and behavioral
and physiologic factors. Studies are
subject to publication bias and are
extremely heterogeneous, making
interpretation of the literature
difﬁcult. There are limited studies
examining the relationship between
distress and cancer recurrence, and
these show mixed ﬁndings. Older
reviews/small meta-analyses65,66
showed no association between
distress and cancer recurrence, but
a newer meta-analysis of 17 studies
involving patients with breast cancer
did show that anxiety and
depression were associated with
increased cancer recurrence.67
There is much more data

supporting that distress/anxiety/
depression are associated with
a small to moderate increased risk of
cancer mortality (Table 2). Again,

1196

vol. 19 (cid:129) no. 8

American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine

these studies are heterogeneous
with regard to the method of
assessing distress, the timing of such
assessments, cancer types/stages,
and adjustments for confounding
factors, but the studies are generally
consistent in showing that distress is
associated with increased cancer
mortality.

Effects of Stress on Treatment
Adherence
Distress may inﬂuence the
likelihood of cancer treatment
adherence and completion as well as
adversely affect outcomes, including
survival. Anxiety and depression
negatively affect quality of life (QOL)
and may lead to less acceptance,
compliance with, or tolerability of
chemotherapy.73,82 These factors
may contribute to worse cancer
outcomes, especially in the curative
setting.83 (See Table 3).

Effects of Stress on QOL/
Symptoms

Stress or distress also affects how

patients experience cancer
treatment. According to NCI PDQ,
“For patients undergoing cancer
treatment, anxiety can also heighten
the expectancy of pain, other
symptoms of distress, and sleep
disturbances, and it can be a major
factor in anticipatory nausea and
vomiting. Regardless of its severity,
anxiety can substantially interfere
with the quality of life of cancer
patients and their families and
should be evaluated and treated.”96
Fortin and colleagues3 also found
that patients with severe anxiety
experienced more physical
symptoms, such as nausea and
vomiting, which can compound
cancer-related somatic symptoms. In
a secondary analysis of data from an
RCT evaluating guided imagery and
progressive muscle relaxation (PMR)
on pain, fatigue, anxiety, and
depression, Charalambous et al
showed evidence of co-occurrence
and inter-relation between pain,
anxiety, depression, and fatigue in

208 patients with breast and prostate
cancer. The analysis concluded that
targeting fatigue, anxiety, and
depression may positively affect
pain and health-related QOL in this
population.97 Another RCT showed
that in a cohort of 169 patients with
BC, self-reported depression burden
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the severity
of side effects, number of side
effects, and the burdens of fatigue,
difﬁculty concentrating, and
anxiety.98

Interventions

NCCN/ASCO Guidelines for
Distress Management

Per current guidelines, all patients
should be assessed for distress using
screening questionnaires at regular
intervals. See Table 4 for screening
test interpretation. Depending on the
screening test’s outcome, different
strategies may be utilized. In general,
patients with moderate to severe
distress (i.e., >4/10 on the NCCN
thermometer or > 8 on the PHQ-9
scale/>10 on GAD-7) should be
referred to mental health
professionals (psychiatry,
psychology, social work) for
evaluation and treatment. This may
include cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT), family counseling,
medications, and chaplaincy care.
For patients with milder distress, the
care team may manage symptoms.
(Tables 5 and 6)4,99

It should be noted that while

distress screening is recommended,
there is some evidence that this
practice does not improve
outcomes.100,101 A recent Cochrane
review did not support the
effectiveness of routine screening,
highlighting the heterogeneity and
methodological issues with the
studies.102 Many patients who screen
positive for distress do not utilize
available resources.103 Cancer
distress guidelines deﬁne distress as
a complex, multi-component
construct best treated by teams that
include multiple specialists with

expertise in each component of
distress (e.g., depression, pain,
spiritual concerns). Unfortunately,
the scientiﬁc literature on distress
screening trials tends to focus on
brief distress screening measures
that do not adequately capture the
complexity of distress and thus do
not adequately test distress
screening as recommended within
current guidelines. Distress
treatment within the scientiﬁc
literature also tends to be less
specialized than recommended
within guidelines and thus
inadequately tested. Furthermore,
there is a lack of investigation
between distress screening measure
selection, construct validity, and
downstream impacts such as
burdens on patients and staff. In
sum, guideline congruent care is not
well tested. There is a signiﬁcant
need to test comprehensive care
models that align with guidelines.104

Psychological Therapies and
Cancer Outcomes

Psychological therapies, such as
CBT, Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT), and supportive
psychotherapy, can be beneﬁcial for
patients with distress. These
psychosocial interventions may also
have a small to moderate effect on
survival.105 CBT interventions are
the most studied psychological
intervention for cancer distress and
are considered the gold-standard
psychological intervention. CBT is
an evidence-based psychological
intervention that challenges
maladaptive thought patterns to
improve psychological, emotional,
and behavioral responses to stress.
As a skills-based intervention,
individuals learn various coping
skills through practice with a mental
health provider and integrate skills
into their home lives. Numerous
studies have used CBT to improve
psychological and physical
outcomes for patients with cancer in
survivorship and with advanced
disease.106-110 ACT, a promising

intervention for cancer distress, is
considered a third-wave behavioral
intervention stemming from the CBT
tradition. ACT aims to promote
psychological ﬂexibility by fostering
awareness of and willingness to
experience distressing internal
experiences while encouraging
engagement in value-driven
behaviors.111 Unlike CBT, ACT
focuses on changing the relationship
to thoughts instead of altering the
content of thoughts. ACT consists of
six core processes (i.e., mindfulness,
acceptance, self-as-context, cognitive
defusion, values, and committed
action) which promote psychological
ﬂexibility.112 A recent meta-analysis
of 110 articles examining the
association between ACT processes
and cancer-related distress indicated
that higher self-reported scores
related to psychological ﬂexibility
(present-moment awareness and
acceptance) were associated with
lower levels of cancer distress.113
ACT has been shown in a systemic
review of 8 studies of advanced
cancer patients to improve anxiety,
depression, psychological distress,
and fatigue, but not pain or
psychological ﬂexibility.114 Similarly,
in cancer survivors, ACT reduced

anxiety, depression, and fear of
recurrence, as well as improved QOL
and psychological ﬂexibility.115

Physiologic Basis of
Psychological Therapies

Though there is a paucity of

rigorous psychological intervention
trials for cancer distress that include
the measurement of inﬂammatory
biomarkers, psychological treatment
is associated with improvements in
both distress constructs and
associated inﬂammatory markers.116
In more controllable animal models,
protocols have demonstrated similar
effects and reversibility of these
effects via blocking the
psychoneuroimmunological cascade
of stress.117-119 Meta-analysis of 56
human psychological treatment RCTs
also revealed reversibility of chronic
inﬂammation (e.g., pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine levels, immune cell counts,
NKC activity, in vitro T-cell mitogen-
driven blastogenesis, infection).120
CBT, mindfulness, and meaning-
based therapies share common
mechanisms and thus are commonly
grouped as “psychological
treatments.”121 Shields et al120
documented effects for both CBT and
combined psychological

interventions within cancer and other
deﬁned populations (HIV,
autoimmune, insomnia), with
durability of at least six months. CBT
was associated with a 33% decrease
in parameters of chronic
inﬂammation, while psychological
treatments, in general, were
associated with an 18% decrease.`123
Beyond pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
and immune cell counts, CBT was
also associated with improved NKC
activity, in vitro T-cell mitogen-driven
blastogenesis, and decreased
incidence of postoperative infections.
Interestingly, age and sex did not
moderate effects.

Across RCTs of psychological
treatment in cancer populations,
psychological therapies are
associated with reduced peripheral
blood mediators of chronic
inﬂammation and improved
parameters of normal/healthy
immune homeostasis (see Figure 1).
The effect of CBT on inﬂammation in
cancer patients has been studied to
a greater extent than other
psychological interventions. In
a study of CBT for cancer
interventions compared to controls,
individuals randomized to CBT had
lower levels of inﬂammation (e.g.,

randomized newly diagnosed BC
patients into a CBT intervention or
control arm. Following the
completion of the intervention,
participants were asked to complete
follow-up assessments at regular
intervals. Participants who
experienced a recurrence (median =
11 years after initial diagnosis) and
received the CBT intervention had
signiﬁcantly higher NKC in the
12 months following recurrence
diagnosis than those in the control
group. Although these studies

suggest that non-pharmacological
interventions can decrease
psychological distress and lower
inﬂammation and stress response, it is
important to note that measurements
of immune function vary greatly.
Given the improved understanding of
the role of immunity in cancer and
the use of immunotherapy to treat
cancer, there is a pressing need for
more sophisticated measures.

Trauma Therapy: Eye
Movement Desensitization and
Reprocessing (EDMR)

Oncology patients can experience

cancer-related PTSD symptoms as
a result of their treatment, and more
traumatic stress symptoms may
occur for patients with a recurrent
cancer diagnosis.124 These patients
should be referred to a mental health
professional for evaluation and

treatment. EDMR is an adjunctive
therapy that involves focusing
patients’ attention on their trauma
memory while also incorporating
eye movements, tones, or tapping to
decrease the intensity and emotion
surrounding the memory (APA).125
EMDR may be recommended as an
intervention for post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and is performed by
a trained therapist. EDMR is an
emerging therapy for additional
emotional health support and
enhancement of QOL in the
oncology patient
population.124,126,127

Tables 7 and 8).128 These
guidelines provide the level of
evidence for these therapies
(high, intermediate, and low) and
the strength (strong, moderate,
and weak) to recommend such
therapies. These modalities are
described in more detail below.

Mindfulness-Based
Interventions (MBI)

Mindfulness-based interventions
teach patients to be aware of the
present moment and
nonjudgmentally address thoughts,
feelings, and sensations. Patients may

practice mindfulness in different
ways, including meditation, yoga, Tai
Chi, breathing techniques, guided
imagery, and body scans.129 Guided
imagery (GI) can help individuals
visualize images, objects, sounds, and
smells that may assist with relaxation
and support healing.130 Performing
a body scan is a technique in which
the patient focuses attention on
different body parts, noting
temperature, muscle tightness, and
other sensations, intending to
reconnect patients to their bodies.131

One common MBI is an

intervention called Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). In

this group-based intervention,
participants learn about
mindfulness-based practices such as
meditation, body scans, and yoga
under the guidance of trained
instructors for two to two and a half
hours weekly over eight weeks. This
includes one full-day retreat and
approximately 45 minutes/day of
home practice between weekly
sessions.132 The beneﬁts of MBI
have been shown in multiple meta-
analyses, conﬁrming improvement
in anxiety and depressive
symptoms and improvements in
QOL.133-135 It is possible that
longer-term beneﬁts may require

mental health compared to usual
care (and equivalent to in-

intervention called Mindfulness-
Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR)
has been developed at the
University of Calgary and is more
speciﬁc for patients with
cancer.139 MBCR programs consist
of body awareness, exercises/
gentle yoga, meditation, inquiry,
and daily home practices. The in-
person class is nine weeks, with
one week being an in-person
retreat. MBCR has been shown in
clinical trials to improve
psychological and sleep outcomes
in patients with cancer.139-141
MBIs are strongly recommended
by the SIO for the treatment of
anxiety and depression during
and after therapy (Tables 7 and
8).128

Yoga

Yoga, an ancient practice rooted

in Indian philosophy, combines
breathing techniques
(pranayama), physical postures
(asanas), and meditation (dyana)
to promote relaxation through
reduced activity in the
sympathetic nervous system. As
with psychological therapies,
yoga also decreases inﬂammatory

cytokines and oxidative stress in
patients with breast cancer.142
Much like MBSR, many of the RCTs
in this space have looked at the
use of yoga amongst patients with
BC.142,143 Given the limited
evidence in malignancies outside
of BC, a wide variety of forms and
styles of yoga, and variable
designs in yoga protocols amongst
current studies, further research
would prove beneﬁcial. SIO
recommends yoga for anxiety and
depression in patients with BC,
both during and after therapy
(Tables 7 and 8).128

Tai Chi/Qigong (TCQ)

Qigong and Tai chi originated
thousands of years ago in China
and involve slow-ﬂowing
movements, breathing techniques,
and focused attention. Tai Chi is
a form of Qigong, but these are
considered equivalent practices
for most purposes and will be
referred to as TCQ. These forms of
mindful movement have shown
many health beneﬁts.144 These
exercises can be practiced
anywhere- at home or outside,
without requiring special
equipment. With practice, TCQ can
inﬂuence stress centers (activating
the parasympathetic nervous

system) to reduce stress hormones
and lower blood pressure and
heart rate.145 Multiple clinical trials
have shown the beneﬁts of TCQ. In
patients with cancer, TCQ has been
shown to improve quality of life,
decrease fatigue, improve
cognition, and improve immune
functioning.146-151 SIO
recommends TCQ to help treat
anxiety/depressive symptoms for
patients with BC after they have
completed therapy (Table 8).128

Hypnosis/Guided Imagery
Hypnosis is “a waking state of
awareness, (or consciousness), in
which a person’s attention is
detached from his or her
immediate environment and is
absorbed by inner experiences
such as feelings, cognition, and
imagery.”152 This can be
therapeutic because suggestions
alter perceptions, thoughts,
emotions, and behaviors. This can
be done in various formats,
including in person, group, or self-
directed.153 Hypnosis does appear
to improve mental health in
patients with cancer; more studies
are needed on the effects on
cancer-speciﬁc outcomes.154-157
SIO recommends hypnosis for
anxiety for patients with cancer

Guided imagery (GI) can help
individuals visualize images,
objects, sounds, and smells that
may assist with relaxation and
support healing.130 Studies
focusing on GI for individuals with
cancer often combine this
technique with other mind-body
practices such as PMR, deep
breathing, and music.

Music Therapy

A trained music therapist typically

supports music therapy; patients
generally listen to pre-recorded
selections. These music selections
are often culturally appropriate or
tailored to patients’ preferences.
Music therapy may help with mood
disorders during active treatment
and may be recommended.128 In an
updated Cochrane review, Brandt
et al found that music therapy
improved anxiety symptoms and, to
a lesser extent, depressive
symptoms; the evidence for this,
however, was low.158

aerobic activity per week and twice-
weekly strength training sessions are
recommended.167 In large meta-
analyses, exercise has also been
shown to improve depressive
symptoms in patients with various
cancers, although the effect size may
be smaller than for other
outcomes.165,166,168-171 The effects of
exercise on improving anxiety are
mixed.166,172,173 A large meta-
analysis showed beneﬁts in QOL
domains, including emotional well-
being, sexuality, sleep disturbance,
social functioning, anxiety, fatigue,
and pain at varying follow-up
periods. The authors called for more
research to determine exercise
prescriptions for different types of
cancer and how to sustain effects for
more extended periods.171 For
example, in patients with lung
cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple
myeloma, exercise has not been
shown to improve mood
symptoms.174-176 However, given
the multitude of beneﬁts of exercise,
it is recommended for all patients
during treatment (as tolerated) and
survivorship.

Other Lifestyle
Interventions for Distress

Exercise

Exercise has been shown to
improve QOL, cognition, fatigue,
and cancer-related outcomes and is
recommended for patients in active
treatment and survivorship.99,159-166
In general, 150-300 min of moderate

Importance of Sleep

Sleep can be impaired by
distress.177 Impaired sleep is
associated with worse QOL and
cancer outcomes. Short sleep is
associated with increased cancer
incidence and worsened
survival.178-180 A large systemic
review with 7092 cancer patients

reported associations between
poorer sleep and poorer response to
treatment, shorter time to
progression, and reduced overall
survival. A meta-analysis revealed
statistically signiﬁcant associations
between poor self-reported sleep
and decreased overall survival and
shorter time to progression.
Signiﬁcant associations were also
observed between poor objectively
assessed sleep and reduced overall
survival.181 In patients with
colorectal cancer, sleep problems
were reported by 56% at baseline
and by 52% on treatment. Sleep
problems at baseline were
independently associated with
a higher risk of earlier death,
progression, and worsened
response to treatment.182 Sleep
problems can persist for years after
diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In
one study, 20% of the sample of
cancer survivors at nine years post-
treatment reported poor sleep
quality, and 51% reported high sleep
disturbance. Sleep medication use
was reported by 28% of patients.
Poor sleep was associated with
physical, emotional, and economic
distress and fear of recurrence.183
Cognitive Behavior Therapy for
Insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold-
standard treatment intervention for
insomnia with greater long-term
effects compared to medications.184
CBT-I involves sleep hygiene,
stimulus control, sleep restriction,
relaxation, and worry management.

Table 9 describes sleep hygiene
techniques.

Stimulus control involves changing

the relationship between the bed
and other activities. After winding
down, patients should only go to bed
when feeling sleepy. If they are not
asleep in 15-20 min, they are
instructed to get up and go to
another room. Engagement in
mundane activities, such as reading,
coloring, or listening to music, is
acceptable, while avoidance of
stimulating activities or those with
bright lights is discouraged. Patients
are then instructed to go to bed
again, but only when feeling sleepy;
this process is repeated until sleep
initiation is obtained. Stimulus
control thus associates sleep with the
bed/bedroom environment. Sleep
restriction involves setting consistent
sleep and wake times based on sleep
diary data to set an optimal sleep
window, creating a sleep deﬁcit and
promoting healthy sleep patterns.
Relaxation and worry management
are also taught to help reshape
negative thoughts about insomnia.

Many of the techniques described
above, including mindfulness-based
interventions, breathing exercises,
PMR, and Qigong or gentle yoga,
may be helpful for relaxation and
quieting the mind. Patients with
seizures or bipolar disorders should
only attempt CBT-I with the
guidance of trained
professionals.185-187

Lifestyle/Integrative
Approaches to Improve Heart
Rate Variability (HRV)

As described above, measuring
HRV is a surrogate for autonomic
health and stress resiliency. Low
HRV is associated with a worse
cancer prognosis, as well as overall
mortality.29-32,188 A scoping literature
review showed that HRV
biofeedback (by breathwork, heart
math, and relaxation) was associated
with improved sleep, fatigue,
anxiety, depression, cognition, and
distress.189 A systematic review of 19
observational studies of patients
with various cancers showed that
higher HRV correlated with

improved cancer outcomes;
however, patients with better coping
skills and resilience may have better
outcomes.31 Table 10 describes
techniques that may be useful to
optimize HRV. These include
lifestyle pillars such as nutrition,
exercise, sleep, and avoiding
alcohol/tobacco. More research is
needed to determine if enhancing
low HRV measures improves
prognosis.

Importance of Social Support
NCI deﬁnes social support for
patients with cancer as “a network of
family, friends, neighbors, and
community members that is
available in times of need to give
psychological, physical, and
ﬁnancial help.”208 Higher levels of
social support have been shown to
positively impact QOL, increase
resilience and coping, improve
emotional health, and increase
survival.209-214 Social constraint
(refraining from or modifying
patients’ disclosure of stress- and
trauma-related thoughts, feelings, or

1205

American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine

concerns) may also impact patients’
well-being.214 Patients with higher
levels of social support also have
lower inﬂammatory markers such as
CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a.215 It is
important to refer patients who lack
social support to resources through
social workers or cancer resource/
education centers.216

Summary

Stress/distress are ubiquitous in
society and play a signiﬁcant role
in human disease. The literature
does not support stress as a factor
in the development of cancer, but
it may lead to behaviors that
increase cancer risk. Conversely,
more robust data shows that
distress in patients with a cancer
diagnosis can contribute to cancer
progression and lead to worse
outcomes. Distress interventions
have been shown to improve
quality of life, physical symptoms,
and cancer outcomes. NCCN/
ASCO guidelines are available to
help clinicians assess and refer
patients. Many integrative and
lifestyle interventions are available
for patients, including mindfulness
interventions, meditative
movements, exercise/yoga, music
therapy, breathing exercises,
guided relaxation, and activities
that improve sleep and HRV.
Lifestyle/integrative clinicians can
play a much-needed role in many
of these interventions.

Recommendations and
Important Points for
Practice

1. Recognize that distress is

common among patients with
cancer

2. Reassure patients that stress itself

did not cause their cancer

3. Screen per institutional guidelines
for distress at multiple time points
and ensure that patients have
access to support

4. Recognize that treating distress

likely improves QOL and cancer
outcomes

5. Utilize NCCN/ASCO guidelines as

needed to guide referrals

6. SIO guidelines are available to
guide referrals for integrative
practices, with mindfulness-
based interventions having the
strongest recommendations for
depressive/anxiety symptoms
7. Optimize lifestyle factors, such as

exercise, sleep, and social
support, which play an important
role in mitigating distress
