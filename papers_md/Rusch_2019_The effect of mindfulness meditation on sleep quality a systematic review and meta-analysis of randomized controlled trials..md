Abstract

There is a growing interest in the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation for sleep disturbed 
populations. Our study sought to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation interventions on 
sleep quality. To assessTo assess for relative efficacy, comparator groups were restricted to specific 
active controls (such as evidenced-based sleep treatments) and nonspecific active controls (such as 
time/attention-matched interventions to control for placebo effects), which were analyzed 
separately. From 3303 total records, 18 trials with 1654 participants were included. We determined 
the strength of evidence using four domains (risk of bias, directness of outcome measures, 
consistency of results, and precision of results). At post-treatment and follow-up, there was low 
strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions had no effect on sleep quality 
compared with specific active controls (ES 0.03 [95% CI −0.43–0.49]) and (ES −0.14 [95% CI 
−0.62–0.34]) respectively. Additionally, there was moderate strength of evidence that mindfulness 
meditation interventions significantly improved sleep quality compared with nonspecific active 
controls at post-intervention (ES 0.33 [95% CI 0.17–0.48]) and at follow-up (ES 0.54 [95% CI 
0.24–0.84]). These preliminary findings suggest that mindfulness meditation may be effective in 
treating some aspects of sleep disturbance. Further research is warranted.

Introduction

Sleep disturbance is a common health complaint affecting an estimated 10–25% of the 
general population.1 Accumulated sleep deficiency can increase the risk for mood and 
anxiety disorders,2–4 cognitive impairment,5 and a variety of medical conditions, including 
cardiovascular disease6 and obesity.7 Pharmaceutical sleep aids remain the first-line 
treatment for insomnia. While effective, they have the potential for abuse, cross-reactivity 
with other medications, and side effects including memory loss, abnormal thoughts, 
behavioral changes, and headaches.8,9 Alternatively, behavioral treatments, such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), can be expensive and inaccessible.10 While the 
risks are attenuated with CBT-I, some of the therapeutic components, such as intensive sleep 
restriction, may exacerbate comorbid psychiatric symptoms and thus compromise 
adherence.11–13 Taken together, there is a need for complementary health interventions, 
which increase patient choice and may be offered as a second-line treatment option when 
first-line treatments are not viable or are intolerable.

In recent years, mindfulness meditation has gained interest as an alternative treatment for 
sleep disturbance. Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in 
the present moment, and non-judgmentally—this attention is curious and kind.14 Cultivating 
present moment awareness, in lieu of reinforcing past or future reactivity, may function to 
transform engrained cognitive patterns and subsequent maladaptive behaviors.15 
Mindfulness meditation is hypothesized to target multiple cognitive and emotional processes 
that contribute to poor sleep quality. It has been shown to decrease ruminative thoughts,16 
diminish emotional reactivity,17,18 and promote impartial reappraisal of salient experiences, 
which together may facilitate sleep.19

The effect of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality has also been the topic of recent meta-
analyses. However, findings were inconsistent and ranged from no effect to a moderate 
positive effect in favor of mindfulness meditation. Two of the four meta-analyses were not 
restricted to randomized control trials (RCTs).20,21 A third meta-analysis, restricted its 
investigation to RCTs;22 however, due to the small number of included trials investigators 
were unable to analyze the active control and waitlist control trials separately. This made it 
difficult to parse nonspecific effects (e.g., attention and expectancy bias) from the effect of 
the intervention. A fourth meta-analysis compared the effect of mindfulness meditation to 
active controls independently;23 however, the small number of included trials limited its 
generalizability. The objective of this meta-analysis is to build on prior meta-analyses by 
only including RCTs that employed a mindfulness meditation intervention in populations

with clinically significant sleep disturbance. Furthermore, To assess for relative efficacy, 
comparator groups were restricted to specific active controls (such as evidenced-based sleep 
treatments) and nonspecific active controls (such as time/attention-matched interventions to 
control for placebo effects), which were analyzed separately. We aim to examine the 
following three questions: (1) Does mindfulness meditation improve sleep quality when 
compared with specific active controls or nonspecific active controls; (2) Does the effect 
persist long-term; and (3) Is there a dose-response effect.

Methods

Systematic search

This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement.24 PubMed, EBSCO, Embase, and The 
Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles through May 2018, with no start date 
restriction. For search terms, two main subject-heading domains were combined with the 
AND operator: one to designate the intervention (meditation, mindfulness, mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), or 
Vipassanā), and the second to designate the outcome (sleep or insomnia). No language 
restrictions were placed on the search. The bibliography of identified trials and germane 
review articles were manually searched for additional references.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included published reports of RCTs in populations with clinically significant sleep 
disturbance that employed a mindfulness meditation intervention with multiple treatment 
sessions and assessment of baseline and post-intervention sleep quality. Validated sleep 
measures included both objective and subjective measurements, for example, actigraphy, 
self-reported sleep quality questionnaires, and diary-reported sleep quality. Evidence-based 
sleep treatments were determined by an American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2006 
report25 and updated with a recent meta-analysis of 19 trials reporting medium to large 
effects of physical activity on subjective measures of sleep.26 Trials were excluded that 
compared mindfulness meditation to an experimental sleep treatment (e.g., transcendental 
meditation, tai chi, and yoga), or compared novice meditators to experienced meditators. All 
other populations with clinically significant sleep disturbance, excluding children and 
adolescents, were eligible. Table 1 includes a detailed summary of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.

Data extraction

Two investigators independently screened the title and abstract of each record to assess 
eligibility. The full-text article was obtained for all potentially eligible trials and screened for 
inclusion. Of the included trials, three investigators independently extracted data relating to 
author, publication year, population type, sample size, mindfulness meditation intervention, 
control intervention, control type, intervention weeks, in-class meditation hours, retreat 
meditation hours, at-home meditation hours, criteria for sleep disturbance, sleep quality 
outcome measure, assessment time-points, assessment data, and risk of bias criteria.

Discrepancies in the eligibility and data extraction were resolved through further contact 
with corresponding authors, discussion, and consensus.

The strength of the body of evidence

The methods for determining the strength of the body of evidence were replicated from our 
prior meta-analysis.27 Briefly, three investigators graded the strength of evidence for each 
outcome, independently and then by consensus, using the grading scheme recommended by 
the Methods Guide for Conducting Comparative Effectiveness Reviews.28 In assigning 
evidence grades, we considered four domains: risk of bias, directness of outcome measures, 
consistency of results, and precision of results. Evidence was classified into the following 
four categories: (1) high (indicating high confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to 
the true effect for this outcome, and further studies would not change the conclusion); (2) 
moderate (indicating moderate confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true 
effect for this outcome, and findings are likely to be stable, but some doubt remains); (3) low 
(indicating limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this 
outcome, and that additional evidence is needed); and (4) insufficient (indicating no 
evidence or inability to estimate an effect for this outcome).28

Risk of bias scoring was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included trials. 
Four major and four minor criteria were determined based on a system implemented in a 
prior comprehensive U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review of meditative 
practices.23 Two points were given for meeting each major criterion and one point was given 
for meeting each minor criterion. A low risk of bias was assigned to trials with a score 
between 9 and 12 points. A medium risk of bias was assigned to trials with a score between 
6 and 8 points. Any trial with five or fewer points was assigned a high risk of bias (Table 2). 
In assessing the directness of measures, both objective and subjective sleep measures were 
considered direct if they were validated to assess a sleep quality dimension. The consistency 
of results was evaluated by comparing the overall direction of effect. Lastly, the precision of 
results was based on the CI range from the meta-analysis. If the CI range was wide due to a 
large heterogeneity (which was attributed to the inconsistency of results) the evidence was 
not scored as imprecise as well.28

Outcome measures

Objective measures of sleep quality included the actigraphy. Subjective measures with 
established validity included the insomnia sleep index (ISI), the medical outcomes study-
sleep scale (MOS-SS), and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Due to the high 
overlap in content validity between the three sleep quality scales, they were pooled in the 
meta-analysis.

Data synthesis and analysis

Quantitative data were analyzed with the Cochrane Collaborative Review Manager Software 
(RevMan 5.3).29 All essential data that were not reported in the original papers were 
requested and received from the trial authors. Since sleep quality measures differed between 
trials (e.g., ISI, MOS-SS, and PSQI), the between-group standardized mean difference was 
used as the summary effect estimate of sleep quality and was calculated as Hedges’ g. Two

trials used multiple sleep quality measures (ISI and PSQI).30,31 In this instance, the PSQI 
score was included in the meta-analysis since it was the most common measure used across 
all trials. Outcomes were analyzed on change from baseline to post-intervention to evaluate 
between-group percent change and the consistency of results across trials. A meta-analysis 
was used to estimate long-term effects of trials with a follow-up assessment between 5 to 12 
months from baseline. To test for relative efficacy, all analyses were stratified by control 
type (i.e., specific active control or nonspecific active control). Spearman’s correlation was 
used to examine a dose-response between in-class meditation hours and standardized sleep 
quality change scores. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic, whereby an I2 ≤ 
25% was considered low, an I2 = 50% was considered moderate, and an I2 ≥ 75% was 
considered high.32 Effect sizes were interpreted based on Cohen’s recommendation.33 P-
values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Results

Search results

A total of 3303 records were initially identified for inclusion in the review. After adjusting 
for duplicates (n = 1312), another 1912 records were further excluded based on title and 
abstract. A full-text review of the remaining 79 articles was conducted and 18 trials with 
1654 participants were included in the final analysis (see CONSORT flow diagram in Fig. 
1).

Characteristics of included trials

Publication dates ranged from 2010 to 2018. MBSR was the most prevalent intervention 
(9/18), followed by MBCT (3/18), and mind-body bridging (MBB) (3/18). Weekly in-class 
meditation sessions ranged from 1 to 2.5 h for 2 to 16 weeks. At-home meditation practice 
was encouraged in all 18 trials; however, 12 trials recommended a specific daily practice 
time, which ranged from 15 to 60 minutes. Seven trials included a one-day meditation 
retreat, and one trial offered an in-class booster session at 2 months post-intervention. All 18 
trials included at least one subjective measure of sleep quality and two trials used an 
objective measure (e.g., actigraphy). Detailed characteristics of the 18 included trials are 
presented in Table 3.

Quality of included trials

All or most trials included a description of withdrawals and dropouts (18/18), described the 
randomization procedure (17/18), matched the control group for time and attention to the 
meditation group (16/18), and reported attrition rates less than 20% at post-intervention 
(13/18). Quality limitations included a failure to evaluate the intervention credibility (3 did/
18), conceal allocation (8/18), blind evaluators to participant allocation (9/18), and include 
an intent-to-treat analysis (10/18). The majority of trials had a moderate risk of bias (10/18), 
seven had a low risk of bias, and one had a high risk of bias. There were no significant 
differences in risk bias scores between the specific active control and nonspecific active 
control groups. Certified meditation instructors were included in 16 trials, trait mindfulness 
was assessed in 11 trials, and prior meditation was explicitly excluded in 10 trials.

Specific active controls

Page 6

Seven of the included trials used specific active control groups,30,31,34–38 with a total of 716 
participants. There was low strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions 
had no effect on sleep quality compared with specific active controls (i.e., evidence-based 
sleep treatments) at post-intervention (ES −0.03 [95% CI −0.49–0.43]) and at a 5- to 12-
month follow-up (ES −0.14 [95% CI −0.62–0.34]). This grading was based on an overall 
medium risk of bias, directness of measure, inconsistency of results (due to high 
heterogeneity at post-intervention [I2 = 88%] and a follow-up [I2 = 84%]), and precision of 
results (see Fig. 2A and Figs. 3 and 4).

Nonspecific active controls

Eleven of the included trials used nonspecific active control groups,39–49 with a total of 939 
participants. There was moderate strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation 
interventions significantly improved sleep quality compared with nonspecific active controls 
(i.e., time/attention matched controls) at post-intervention (ES 0.33 [95% CI 0.17–0.48]) and 
at a 5- to 12-month follow-up (ES 0.54 [95% CI 0.24–0.84]). This grading was based on an 
overall medium risk of bias, directness of measure, consistency of results (due to low 
heterogeneity at post-intervention [I2 = 0%] and follow-up [I2 = 45%]), and precision of 
results (see Fig. 2B and Figs. 3–4).

Dose–response effect

Seventeen trials reported on total in-class meditation hours for the intervention, which 
ranged from 3 to 42 h (15.6 M, 9.8 SD), including the one-day retreat. No significant 
correlation was found between in-class meditation hours and standardized sleep quality 
change scores (rs = 0.1, P = 0.704). Six trials assessed a dose-response relationship between 
at-home practice minutes and sleep quality improvements from baseline to post-intervention. 
Three trials identified no relationship,31,38,41 while another three trials identified a 
significant positive correlation.34,36,49 One trial investigated a long-term dose–response 
effect and found a significant positive correlation between continued at-home practice 
minutes and additional sleep quality improvements at 18-month follow-up.34

Sensitivity analysis

We conducted a sensitivity analysis to confirm that our conclusions were not dependent on 
the updated evidenced-based sleep treatment determination. The specific active control 
group (minus the two exercise control trials36,38) had similar results at post-intervention (ES 
−0.14 [95% CI −0.80–0.53]) [I2 = 91%] and at a 5- to 12-month follow-up (ES −0.19 [95% 
CI −0.96–0.58]) [I2 = 89%]). The nonspecific active control group (plus the two exercise 
control trials) also had similar and significant results at post-intervention (ES 0.30 [95% CI 
0.17–0.43]) [I2 = 14%] and did not report additional 5- to 12-month follow-up data. A 
second sensitivity analysis was conducted by including trials with a PSQI score greater than 
10, and an ISI score greater than 14, which are indicative of severe sleep disturbance.50,51 
The specific active controls had a similar effect size at post-intervention (ES −0.12 [95% CI 
−0.80–0.57]) [I2 = 91%]) and a decreased effect size at a 5 - to 12-month follow-up (ES 
−0.26 [95% CI −0.93–0.42]) [I2 = 85%]), which remained nonsignificant. Meanwhile, the

nonspecific active controls had an increased effect size at post-intervention (ES 0.52 [95% 
CI 0.32–0.72]) [I2 = 0%]) and a similar effect size at a 5- to 12-month follow-up (ES 0.64 
[95% CI 0.26–1.02]) [I2 = 44%]), which remained significant. Lastly, a leave-one-out 
sensitivity analysis determined that the significant heterogeneity in the specific active control 
meta-analysis was the result of a single CBT-I trial.30 The heterogeneity was reduced from 
88% and 84% to 0% at post-intervention and at a 5- to 12-month follow-up. Results were 
similar at post-intervention (ES 0.15 [95% CI −0.01–0.31]) and at a 5- to 12-month follow-
up (ES 0.10 [95% CI −0.09–0.29]), with a change in direction of effect.

Discussion

The evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation can improve sleep quality in a variety of 
clinical populations with sleep disturbance. While our results indicated no effect of 
mindfulness meditation on sleep quality when compared with evidenced-based sleep 
treatments, the strength of evidence was low and further studies are needed to elucidate these 
findings. Results also indicated that mindfulness meditation significantly improved sleep 
quality compared with nonspecific active controls. This meta-analysis only included RCTs 
with an active comparator group, so there is greater confidence that the reported benefits are 
not attributed to placebo effects commonly observed in usual care and waitlist control trials.

At a 5- to 12-month follow-up, mindfulness meditation did not differ in effect from 
evidence-based sleep treatments and significantly improved sleep quality compared with 
nonspecific active controls. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a long-term 
effect. The maintenance of intervention effects may be attributed to learned techniques that 
reduce sleep-interfering cognitive processes,20 changes in sleep architecture,52 as well as 
morphometric and connectivity alterations in sleep-related brain regions.53,54 Despite these 
advances, additional evidence is needed to clarify the conditions and mechanisms that drive 
the maintenance of intervention effects.

The evidence did not support a dose-response relationship between in-class meditation hours 
and sleep quality scores. This finding is consistent with a meta-analysis of 20 trials that 
assessed the relationship between in-class meditation hours and psychological distress.55 
The link between at-home practice minutes and sleep quality scores was inconclusive due to 
the limited number of trials that assessed this relationship. Dose–response relationships are 
arguably one of the most challenging measures in meditation research. It’s difficult to 
accurately assess how mindful (versus mind wandering) an individual is during meditation 
practice.56 Studies with tailored curriculums, expert instructors, and different patient 
populations may result in larger effects with shorter course durations. Moreover, the 
nonlinear trajectory of mediation progress is often misunderstood.57 Traditionally, success is 
defined by increased awareness and equanimity, whereby positive states are a byproduct. 
When symptom change over a short period is utilized as a benchmark of success, meditation 
progress and its potential effect on well-being may be veiled.

Of the 10 trials that reported on adverse events, there was no evidence of increased risk of 
harm. Two trials reported a worsening of sleep quality in 3% and 7% of the meditation 
groups, compared with 24% and 12% in the comparator groups.45,47 Another trial reported

Limitations

one case of muscle soreness in the meditation group and one case of sleep disruption in the 
control group.42 It’s not uncommon for symptoms to worsen, particularly in the early weeks 
of the intervention.58 Feelings of anger, sadness, or fear, may appear stronger as practice 
develops since present moment awareness can highlight emotions.59 A history of trauma, 
mental instability, addiction, or major life changes, may heighten emotional reactivity and 
require additional clinical monitoring.60

There are several limitations that reduced our ability to draw robust conclusions from these 
results. At the meta-analysis level, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis indicated substantial 
heterogeneity due to the inclusion of a single CBT-I trial.30 This may be attributed to the 
large positive effects CBT-I is estimated to have on sleep quality when compared to other 
evidenced-based sleep treatments.61 It might also be due to the 50% attrition rate in the 
MBSR group (verses 14% in the CBT-I group). Participants who withdrew typically did so 
within the first three weeks and had higher levels of baseline insomnia severity, which may 
have attenuated effects.30 Additional heterogeneity might have been introduced by 
combining scores from the ISI, MOS-SS, and PSQI to create a single global sleep quality 
score. At the study level, the most common drawbacks were a failure to evaluate the 
intervention credibility and conceal allocation, which may lead to expectation bias. The lack 
of comprehensive reporting of treatment adherence and adverse events limited our ability to 
rigorously examine the effect of a dose–response and assess for safety. Moreover, only two 
trials included an objective measure of total sleep time via actigraphy. One trial identified a 
statistically significant between-group effect in favor of MBSR at a 5-month follow-up, but 
not at post-intervention.30 The other trial did not report between-group effects.31

Future directions

These findings support continued research exploring the clinical application of mindfulness 
meditation and provide a foundation for healthcare providers to consider these interventions 
in sleep-disturbed populations. Future research in mindfulness meditation would benefit 
from addressing the outstanding methodological limitations, as well as incorporating 
adherence measures, such as mobile applications, so participants can easily record at-home 
practice time. Future research should include systematic reporting of adverse events, which 
can help identify factors of increased risk. Researchers should use a combination of 
objective and subjective sleep outcomes to better understand if improved sleep quality is due 
to reduced sleep onset latency, improved total sleep time, or some other factor. The 
effectiveness of web- and app-based mindfulness meditation interventions should be 
investigated to increase accessibility, especially for low-income minorities with poor health 
and barriers to access.

change in favor of meditation. For example, a change score of 20% indicates the meditation 
group had a 20% higher improvement in sleep quality score compared with the control 
group. Dotted lines at −5% and 5% demarcate the effect threshold and do not indicate 
statistical significance. *The result is statistically significant per manuscript. [*] overall 
group effect is statistically significant; the effect for individual time points was not reported.

Major and minor criteria in assessing risk of bias

Table 2.

Major Criteria

Minor Criteria

Was the control matched for time and attention by the instructors? Was the randomization procedure described?

Were evaluators blinded to participant allocation?

Was allocation concealed?

Was there a description of withdrawals and dropouts?

Was an intent-to-treat analysis used?

Was attrition less than 20% at post-intervention assessment?

Did the trial evaluate the credibility, and if so, was it comparable?
