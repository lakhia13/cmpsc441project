SAMHSA’s grant programs and services support efforts for ending and preventing homelessness among people with mental and/or substance use disorders.

Stable housing is a critical component of recovery. SAMHSA’s homelessness programs and resources work to end homelessness by improving access to treatment and services that support health and wellness. It is well documented that untreated behavioral health conditions can contribute to issues such as unemployment that make it difficult to find and keep stable and affordable housing. As reported by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, approximately 30% of people experiencing chronic homelessness have a serious mental illness, and around two-thirds have a primary substance use disorder or other chronic health condition.

SAMSHA’s homelessness programs support many types of behavioral health treatments and recovery-oriented services. These services include:

- Case management

- Treatment for mental and/or substance use disorders

- Enrollment in mainstream benefits such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

- Peer support services

- Employment readiness services

Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS)

- Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH): This program funds services for people with serious mental illness (SMI) experiencing homelessness. PATH grants are distributed annually to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each state or territory solicits proposals and awards funds to local public or nonprofit organizations, known as PATH providers.

- Treatment for Individuals Experiencing Homelessness (TIEH): This program expands access to mental and substance use disorders treatment for people experiencing homelessness along with a serious mental illness, serious emotional disturbance, or co-occurring disorders. The goal of the program is to increase access to evidence-based treatment services, peer support, services that support recovery, and connections to permanent housing.

- The Homeless and Housing Resource Center (HHRC): Provides training on housing and treatment models focused on adults, children, and families who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness and have serious mental illness and/or serious emotional disturbance, substance use disorders, and/or co-occurring disorders.

Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT)

- Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals (GBHI): This program provides comprehensive, coordinated, and evidence-based treatment and services for individuals, including youth, and families with SUDs or co-occurring mental and SUDs who are experiencing homelessness.
