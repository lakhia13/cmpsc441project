Abstract

Seasonal variation of manic and depressive symptoms is a controversial topic in bipolar dis-
order research. Several studies report seasonal patterns of hospital admissions for depres-
sion and mania and variation in symptoms that appear to follow a seasonal pattern, whereas
others fail to report such patterns. Differences in research methodologies, data analysis
strategies, and temporal resolution of data may partly explain the variation in findings
between studies. The current study adds a novel perspective to the literature by investigat-
ing specific meteorological factors such as atmospheric pressure, hours of sunshine, rela-
tive humidity, and daily maximum and minimum temperatures as more proximal predictors
of self-reported daily mood change in people diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The results
showed that daily maximum temperature was the only meteorological variable to predict
clinically-relevant mood change, with increases in temperature associated with greater odds
of a transition into manic mood states. The mediating effects of sleep and activity were also
investigated and suggest at least partial influence on the prospective relationship between
maximum temperature and mood. Limitations include the small sample size and the fact
that the number and valence of social interactions and exposure to natural light were not
investigated as potentially important mediators of relationships between meteorological fac-
tors and mood. The current data make an important contribution to the literature, serving to
clarify the specific meteorological factors that influence mood change in bipolar disorder.
From a clinical perspective, greater understanding of seasonal patterns of symptoms in
bipolar disorder will help mood episode prophylaxis in vulnerable individuals.

Introduction

Many people intuit that bad weather makes us sad and good weather makes us happy. Scien-
tific investigation has largely failed to support such associations however, with variations in
meteorological variables either showing no [1, 2] or weak [3] relationships with variations in
normal mood. A likely explanation for these weak experimental findings is that weather affects
mood for only a subset of the population, and the strength and direction of these effects vary
between individuals. Indeed, Klimstra et al. [4] identified four subtypes of people in their

Meteorology and mood in bipolar disorder

Dutch sample according to how individuals’ mood was affected by the weather—Summer Lov-
ers, Summer Haters, Rain Haters, and Unaffected types. The latter subtype, consisting of those
that do not experience changes in mood with the weather, was by far the most populated
group in the Klimstra et al. sample and goes some way to explaining why average effects of
weather on mood across large groups are often not found.

A subset of the population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes in mood due to
associated changes in the weather are people diagnosed with bipolar disorder (BD). Unstable
mood is a feature of the disorder, even outside the clinical episodes of mania and depression
that define the disorder [5], and it has been shown that people with this condition have greater
vulnerability to a range of environmental insults (e.g., sleep disturbance, social rhythm disrup-
tions [6]) than the rest of the population. In addition, a seasonal pattern specifier in diagnostic
criteria for the disorder (DSM-5 [7]) allows characterisation of clinical mood variation as
‘seasonal’, suggesting that some people with BD present clinically with a repeating pattern of
mood disturbance that cycles in a seasonal manner.

Several lines of investigation have been used to systematically evaluate the relationship
between season and mood in people with BD. In a comprehensive review of studies across sev-
eral continents and latitudes, Geoffroy et al. [8] reported peaks in hospital admission rates for
depressive episodes in early winter and for manic episodes in spring-summer. A similar sea-
sonal pattern of recurrence was apparent for people diagnosed with the seasonal specifier of
BD (approximately 10–15% of all people diagnosed with BD-I). The limitations of data based
on hospital admissions records and clinical reports are well-known and significant enough
that these findings be interpreted with caution [9]. Geoffroy et al. therefore also reviewed data
on the seasonality of self-reported symptoms amongst people with BD and found that about a
quarter report a seasonal pattern to their mood symptoms. The most commonly reported pat-
tern across the studies reviewed was a lowering of mood in winter. Similar findings were
reported in a long-term prospective study of manic and depressive symptoms conducted over
10 years and based on yearly or half-yearly reports of symptoms to clinicians [10]. While
depressive symptoms peaked in winter, particularly amongst those diagnosed with Bipolar I
disorder, manic symptoms peaked in autumn, not spring-summer as had previously been
reported.

Five further studies investigating prospective relationships between mood and weather in

people with BD have failed to find the seasonal patterns reported above. Bauer et al. [9]
reported finding no seasonal variation in daily mood self-reports amongst 360 BD outpatients.
Friedman et al. [11] found no relationship between clinically-defined depressive episodes and
calendar month amongst patients with BD-I enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhance-
ment Program for BD (STEP-BD). Christensen et al. [12] investigated seasonal variation via
meteorological factors (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, hours of
sunshine), and whether such factors predicted the onset of manic and depressive episodes
amongst 56 patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder over a period of 3
years. Again, no meaningful relationships were found. Finally, Murray et al. [13] reported find-
ing no relationship between season and clinician-rated symptoms of mania or depression
amongst 429 patients with BD. Null findings were also reported in a large population-based
study of seasonal variation in depressive symptoms [14].

The variation in findings between studies using cross-sectional data such as hospital admis-

sion records and those using prospective data from self-reports can probably be explained on
methodological grounds. Hospital admission records are low resolution representations of the
relationship between season and mood for several reasons—hospital admission dates are often
poor indicators of episode onset, dates of episode onset are subject to recall bias, and not all
BD patients who experience a mood episode will present to a hospital. Prospective data would

appear to be a more authentic way of capturing these relationships, particularly as they pertain
to the lived experience of people with BD. If seasonal cycling of symptoms is to be used to facil-
itate mood episode prophylaxis, then understanding of the lived experience is of paramount
importance.

In addition to the methodological importance of prospective self-reports, the use of daily
meteorological data to investigate relationships with mood may also confer methodological
advantages. As Christensen et al. [12] noted, it is the variation in weather that may explain sea-
sonal influences on mood. Indeed, many of the mechanistic theories used to explain seasonal
variation in mood for people with BD are based on variations in daily meteorological factors
such as exposure to sunlight and how it affects neurobiological processes [15, 16], rather than
the gross and non-specific environmental changes that occur with the seasons. In other words,
daily meteorological factors are more proximal indicators of how mood is affected by seasonal
variation.

The aim of the current study was to investigate associations between daily mood self-
reports and meteorological factors in a sample of people diagnosed with BD. The mixed find-
ings reported in the literature preclude hypotheses pertaining to which meteorological factors,
if any, are most important in affecting mood. We also investigated possible mediators of
weather-mood relationships in order to better understand how these factors might be related.
Manifestation of manic and depressive states is associated with higher and lower levels of activ-
ity, respectively. It would not be surprising therefore, to see that activity levels partially mediate
the weather-mood relationship, as they are also associated with changes in the weather. That
is, people tend to be more active in sunny/warmer weather than in darker/colder weather [17].
Sleep-related variables were also investigated as possible mediators of the weather-mood rela-
tionship. Fig 1 presents the model of relationships being investigated in the current study.

Method

Participants

Eleven participants (8 women, 3 men; age M = 47 years) were recruited through a public health
service in regional Victoria, Australia. Inclusion criteria for the study consisted of a primary
diagnosis of BD-I using DSM-IV-TR criteria with no significant comorbidity in the form of an
Axis-II disorder or a psychotic or substance use disorder. All participants had been clinically
stable for at least 6 months at the time of entering the study, and all were taking medications to

help manage their condition. Participants maintained a treatment-as-usual approach to the
ongoing management of their condition throughout their time in the study. No episodes of
mania or depression were reported during participants’ involvement in the study.

An average of 130 consecutive days of self-report data (range: 14 days to 231 days) per par-

ticipant was available for analysis. Missing observations were found in the mood and sleep
data for seven out of the 11 participants. The percentage of missing self-report mood and
sleep observations for the whole sample was low however, with only 3.7% of total possible data
points not recorded.

Materials

Screening. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-Auto [18]) was used
to confirm primary diagnosis. The CIDI-Auto provides a valid and reliable diagnosis of mood
disorder based on DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.

Daily self-report mood recording. ChronoRecord [19] was used by participants to record
daily mood and sleep data. Mood was recorded on a 100-unit VAS with user-defined extremes
of mania and depression anchoring each end point. ChronoRecord has proven to be a valid
and reliable indicator of clinically-relevant mood states in BD [19, 20].

Sleep was also recorded using ChronoRecord. A graphic interface of 24 boxes, each repre-

senting one hour in the preceding 24 hours was toggled between three options—Awake, In
Bed Asleep, and In Bed Awake. Participants selected the option that best represented their
degree of ‘wakefulness’ for each hour in the 24-hour period.

24-hour activity monitoring. Wrist actigraphy was used to record ambulatory 24-hour
activity patterns. The actigraph employed in the current study was the Respironics/Mini-Mit-
ter Actiwatch-L (Respironics, Inc., Bend, Oregon) and the Actiware 5.0 software program was
used to view and analyse the activity data. The actigraph was worn on the non-dominant wrist
of all participants.

Sleep. Actigraphy was also used to measure three sleep variables—total sleep time (TST),
sleep efficiency (SE), and wake after sleep onset (WASO). TST was calculated as the total num-
ber of minutes spent asleep. SE was expressed as the percentage of minutes spent asleep during
a given sleep period. A higher percentage indicates more time spent asleep during the sleep
period. WASO was defined as the number of minutes spent awake after sleep onset. The use of
ChronoRecord afforded the opportunity to collect sleep self-reports alongside these actigraph-
recorded sleep variables. Self-reported percentage of time spent in bed actually sleeping (In
Bed Asleep) was the variable of interest in the current study.

Total daytime activity. A single variable was used to measure total daytime activity. The

10 consecutive hours within the 24-hour day with the highest average level of activity (M10)
provides an output variable that can be used to monitor daily activity levels [21].

Meteorological data. Meteorological data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of

Meteorology’s Climate Data Service (www.bom.gov.au). Daily data pertaining to hours of
sunshine, minimum and maximum temperature in degrees Celsius, average relative humid-
ity, and barometric pressure in hectopascals (hPa) were retrospectively matched by date to
the mood, sleep, and activity data reported daily by participants. Temperature, humidity,
and air pressure data were measured at the airport of the town in regional Victoria from
where participants were recruited and where they all resided (latitude 36.8˚ S). Sunshine
data were measured at an international airport, some 150 kilometers from the town in
regional Victoria (latitude 37.7˚ S), because these data were not available from the regional
airport.

Procedure

Participants completed the CIDI-Auto as well as the requisite consent forms. Participants
gave written consent to participate in the study and for review of their confidential medical
records. Participants received a computer package that included ChronoRecord and other
applications necessary to complete and submit mood and sleep reports and were paid for
their ongoing participation in the study. Ethical approval for study procedures was gained
through both the Swinburne University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee
and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the public health service from which partici-
pants were recruited.

Statistical analysis

In accordance with the mood rating categories for ChronoRecord described by Bauer et al.
[19], a mood rating of below 40 was regarded as low mood (depression), above 60 was
regarded as high mood (mania) and scores between 40 and 60 were regarded as normal mood.
Relationships between mood, weather, activity, and sleep variables were investigated with hier-
archical multi-level nominal logistic regression models fitted using HLM7 software [22] to
allow for the nested nature of the data within individuals. The sleep variables were added at
stage 1, the meteorological variables were added at stage 2, with the M10 activity variable
added at Stage 3. All variables were group mean centered prior to analysis in order to avoid
potential complications associated with multicollinearity.

In these models the reference category was defined as yesterday’s mood with the probability

of transition i calculated from the following formula. No transition refers to no change in
mood between yesterday and today.

A mixed linear model analysis was run for the four sleep variables (TST, WASO, SE and In
Bed Asleep) in order to determine which of the previous day’s meteorological variables (maxi-
mum temperature, difference between maximum and minimum temperature, hours of sun-
shine, average relative humidity and mean sea level pressure) were related to sleep. This
analysis was necessary in order to model possible mediating effects of sleep in the relationship
between weather and mood. Several of the sleep variables were transformed in order to make
an assumption of normality more plausible for the mixed linear model analysis with a square
root transformation for WASO and arcsin(SQRT(y/100)) transformations for SE and In Bed
Asleep.

A further mixed linear model analysis was run to determine which of the meteorological
variables (maximum temperature, difference between maximum and minimum temperature,
hours of sunshine, average relative humidity and mean sea level pressure) were related to activ-
ity levels. This analysis was necessary in order to model possible mediating effects of activity in
the relationship between weather and mood. In this analysis, participants were regarded as a
random factor and an AR dependence structure was assumed for consecutive days.

Results

Table 1 shows the transition frequencies for mood on consecutive days. Depressed mood days
were followed by another depressed mood day for 49.1% of such days with a switch to normal
mood for 39.6% of such days and a switch to manic mood for 11.3% of such days. Normal
mood days were followed by another normal mood day for 83.4% of such days with a switch to

Manic mood days were followed by another manic mood day for 41.1% of such days with a
switch to normal mood for 41.7% of such days and a switch to depressed mood for 17.3% of
such days. Mood was in the normal range for 70.7% of all days.

Effect of last night’s sleep, today’s meteorological variables and today’s
activity levels on changes in mood

Relationships between variables were tested using nominal logistic regression analyses. Sepa-
rate analyses were performed for depressed, normal and manic mood yesterday, allowing yes-
terday’s mood to moderate the relationships with changes in mood. Each analysis was carried
out using multi-level modelling in three stages as previously described. In these multinomial
logistic regression analyses the condition of no mood change from yesterday was considered
the reference category. The first analyses, summarised in Tables 2 and 3, consider shifts in
mood when yesterday’s mood was depressed.

Table 2 shows that In Bed Asleep had a significant positive relationship with changes from
depressed to normal mood. On average, the odds of a switch from depressed to normal mood
increased by 5% for a 1% increase in the percentage of time spent in bed asleep. A significant
relationship between Mean Sea Level Pressure and a switch from depressed to normal mood
was also found. On average, a 1 hPa increase in Mean Sea Level Pressure was associated with a
6% reduction in the odds of a switch from depressed to normal mood.

Table 3 shows that there was a significant relationship between maximum temperature and
the odds of a transition from depressed to manic mood. A 1˚ increase in the maximum temper-
ature was associated with a 17.5% increase in the odds of a transition from depressed to manic
mood on average. The number of minutes spent awake after sleep onset was also significantly
associated with the odds of a transition from depressed to manic mood. For each additional
minute awake the odds of a shift from depressed to manic mood declined by 3.6% on average.
In the next analysis, no significant predictors were found for transitions from normal to
manic mood. However, as shown in Table 4, there were some significant predictors for transi-
tions from normal to depressed mood.

The data in Table 4 suggest that, on average, the odds of a transition from normal to

depressed mood increased by 7.7% for each additional 1% of SE, but declined by 3.0% for each
additional 1% of time spent in bed asleep. In addition, there was a significant association with
M10, with the odds of a transition from normal to depressed mood on average declining by
0.4% for each additional unit increase in M10 raw activity.

Finally, transitions from manic mood were investigated. No significant predictors were
found for transitions from manic to depressed mood. However, Table 5 shows a single signifi-
cant predictor—In Bed Asleep—for transition from manic to normal mood. A transition from
manic to normal mood was more likely after a good night’s sleep. For each 1% increase in time
spent in bed asleep the odds of a transition from manic to normal mood increased by 14.8%
on average.

Overall, the results show that higher maximum temperatures were associated with transi-
tion from depressed to manic mood while higher mean sea level pressure appeared to inhibit
a transition from depressed to normal mood. Increased M10 activity apparently only pro-
tected against transitions from normal to depressed mood. A higher percentage of time
spent in bed asleep was associated with increased odds of a transition from depressed to
normal mood and from manic to normal mood, with decreased odds of a transition from
normal to depressed mood, and thus suggest that percentage of time spent in bed asleep had
a protective effect on unhealthy mood transitions. Additional minutes awake after sleep
onset appeared to reduce the odds of a transition from depressed to manic mood while
increased sleep efficiency appeared to increase the odds of a transition from normal to
depressed mood.

Effect of meteorological variables on sleep

A mixed linear model analysis was run for the four sleep variables (TST, WASO, SE and In
Bed Asleep) in order to determine which of the previous day’s meteorological variables were
related to sleep (Table 6).

The results show that maximum temperature was the only meteorological variable that had

a significant linear relationship with In Bed Asleep and TST, with higher temperatures being
associated with less sleep.

In combination with the significant relationships between last night’s sleep and today’s
mood, these findings suggest that the effect of meteorological variables on transitions in mood
may be partially mediated by the effect of meteorological variables on sleep.

Effect of today’s meteorological variables on activity levels

A mixed linear model analysis was then run in order to determine whether today’s activity lev-
els were related to the meteorological variables. Table 7 suggests that hours of sunshine and
mean sea level pressure have a positive relationship with activity levels on the same day. It is
possible then, that activity levels partially mediate the effect of meteorological variables on
transitions in mood.

Discussion

Overall, the results supported effects of two meteorological variables on mood. Specifically,
higher maximum temperature was associated with an increase in the odds of a transition from
depressed mood to manic mood on consecutive days. In addition, improvement in mood
from depressed to normal on consecutive days was more likely the lower the recorded sea-

level pressure was on that day. Effects of sunshine hours, humidity, and minimum temperature
on transitions in mood were not found.

That higher maximum temperatures were associated with transitions from depressed to
manic mood on consecutive days is a novel finding, particularly in the absence of an effect
of sunshine hours on mood—an effect that may have been expected based on theory. Previ-
ous data have shown that sunshine can have a positive effect on mood [4], and theory would
suggest that increased hours of access to sunshine (or alternative sources of bright light
[15]) during the day would have a stabilising effect on neurobiological systems that are rele-
vant to mood disorders [16]. No such data exists for an independent effect of temperature
on mood.

A transition in mood of the magnitude recorded may be clinically significant, as it indicates

a rapid change from a depressed mood state to a manic one. Such rapid changes in mood are
indicative of worse outcomes in BD populations [23]. Notably, the significant effect was iso-
lated to instances in which mood transitioned upwards from depressed to manic (n = 29), a
transition which is considered a worsening of mood. Maximum temperature was not associ-
ated with a transition from normal mood to manic (n = 72), or from depressed to normal
mood (n = 91), the latter of which in particular may be considered an improvement in mood.
The relationship between mood and sea-level pressure was also a novel finding. No previ-
ous study has demonstrated any effect, positive or negative, of atmospheric pressure on mood.
Theories on why such an effect might exist are similarly non-existent. The magnitude of the
relationship between lower sea-level pressure and improvement in mood from depressed to
normal in the current study was very small—a 1 hPa decrease in Mean Sea Level Pressure was
associated with only a 6% increase in the odds of a switch from depressed to normal mood.
The potential clinical relevance of such a small effect is arguably moot. In the absence of any
practical or theoretical justification for such a relationship, this finding must be considered
questionable until replicated.

Stronger relationships were reported for the effects of sleep on mood. In particular, self-
reported percentage of time spent in bed asleep was associated with greater odds of transition
into normal mood, from both depressed and manic mood the previous day, and lower odds of
a transition from normal mood the previous day into depressed mood the next day. It would
seem therefore, that longer self-reported time spent in bed asleep had a protective effect on
unhealthy mood transitions in this sample of people with BD-I. The significant associations
between sleep and mood were not consistently replicated using actigraph-derived objective
estimates of sleep, perhaps reinforcing the fundamental differences between, and inherent lim-
itations of, these two measures of sleep, particularly in populations with disturbed sleep [24].
Nevertheless, the importance of adequate sleep in managing BD is unquestionable [25] and
the current findings appear to support clinical recommendations.

Based on the results reported here it is possible that any meteorological effects on mood
are, at least in part, mediated by sleep and activity variables. The findings in the current study
that specific meteorological factors can affect sleep (Table 6) and activity (Table 7), when con-
sidered alongside the well-characterised associations between mood and both sleep [26] and
activity [27] in BD populations, suggest a hypothesised mediational relationship in the direc-
tion of meteorological factors -> sleep/activity -> mood. Further direct evidence of such a
causal pathway is needed.

A potential mediator of the relationship between meteorological factors and mood not
investigated in the current study is seasonal variation in social interaction (i.e., greater in Sum-
mer, lesser in Winter). Such variation in social interaction may have particular relevance for
people with BD [28, 29]. The number and valence of social interactions should be measured in
future studies of weather-mood relationships in BD populations.

Meteorology and mood in bipolar disorder

The small sample size and the fact that all participants were taking medication to manage
their BD are limitations of the current study. The possibility that the reported outcomes are
idiosyncratic to this sample can not be discounted. In addition, obtaining data on individuals’
actual exposure to natural light, rather than relying on meteorological reports of the amount of
sunshine hours per day, would be desirable methodological inclusions in future studies. Simi-
larly, self-reports of mood, particularly manic mood, may need to be corroborated with others’
reports of participants’ mood given the lack of insight often associated with these mood states
in people with BD [30]. Given these limitations, the findings are undoubtedly preliminary and
exploratory in nature. Replication in larger and more diverse samples is necessary.

The outcomes of the current study provide a novel perspective on the questions surround-
ing seasonal mood patterns in BD. In particular, we were interested in the specific meteorolog-
ical factors (if any) that affect mood in this population, and possible mediators of these
relationships. The data supported a small effect of temperature on mood in this sample, with
higher maximum temperature being associated with worsening of mood towards mania. This
effect of temperature was likely mediated by sleep. The lack of consensus in the BD literature
on weather-mood relationships is largely due to variations in how mood disorder states are
measured and conceptualised in BD (episodes, hospitalisation, self-reports) and the most
appropriate time lag to monitor these relationships (synchronous, previous day, weekly,
monthly). The current study investigated the relationship between meteorological factors and
mood at a more proximal level than previous investigations by using daily and more specific
meteorological data as well as daily reports of mood, and thus makes an important contribu-
tion to our understanding of seasonal mood patterns in BD. A more nuanced understanding
of meteorological influences on mood in BD will assist clinical- and self-management of
manic and depressive episodes that recur with the seasons.
