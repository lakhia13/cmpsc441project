Abstract

These guidelines provide an up-date of previous IFCN report on “Non-invasive electrical and 
magnetic stimulation of the brain, spinal cord and roots: basic principles and procedures for 
routine clinical application” (Rossini et al., 1994). A new Committee, composed of international 
experts, some of whom were in the panel of the 1994 “Report”, was selected to produce a current 
state-of-the-art review of non-invasive stimulation both for clinical application and research in 
neuroscience.

Since 1994, the international scientific community has seen a rapid increase in non-invasive brain 
stimulation in studying cognition, brain–behavior relationship and pathophysiology of various 
neurologic and psychiatric disorders. New paradigms of stimulation and new techniques have been 
developed. Furthermore, a large number of studies and clinical trials have demonstrated potential 
therapeutic applications of non-invasive brain stimulation, especially for TMS. Recent guidelines 
can be found in the literature covering specific aspects of non-invasive brain stimulation, such as 
safety (Rossi et al., 2009), methodology (Groppa et al., 2012) and therapeutic applications 
(Lefaucheur et al., 2014).

This up-dated review covers theoretical, physiological and practical aspects of non-invasive 
stimulation of brain, spinal cord, nerve roots and peripheral nerves in the light of more updated 
knowledge, and include some recent extensions and developments.

1. Introduction

It has been 20 years since the publication of the first IFCN-endorsed report on “Non-
invasive electrical and magnetic stimulation of the brain, spinal cord and roots: basic 
principles and procedures for routine clinical application” (Rossini et al., 1994). This report 
has been useful and has been cited 1805 times to date (Google Scholar, 7th December 2014). 
Over 20 years there have been many developments, some foreshadowed in 1994, some 
unforeseen. Accordingly, a new Committee has been tasked with updating the report. In 20 
years much has been learnt about plasticity of the nervous system in healthy subjects and 
patients with neurological and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. The development of new

techniques, new coils, new stimulus paradigms and the introduction of neuronavigation have 
rendered research and clinical studies more accurate, more insightful and of greater clinical 
value. These developments have allowed non-motor areas of the brain to be probed and for 
non-invasive brain stimulation to be trialled as a therapeutic measure. Comprehensive 
coverage of the entire field would constitute a sizable monograph and of necessity this 
Report focuses on those areas of greatest interest to practicing clinical neurophysiologists. 
Recently published guidelines cover the safety of non-invasive brain stimulation (Rossi et 
al., 2009), its methodology (Groppa et al., 2012) and therapeutic applications (Lefaucheur et 
al., 2014).

2. Physiology

Stimulation of the human brain, like the peripheral nerve, involves depolarizing neuronal 
membranes in order to initiate action potentials. Experience from invasive stimulation during 
neurosurgery or epilepsy monitoring shows that stimulation parameters for the central 
nervous system are relatively similar to those needed for peripheral nerve: short pulses with 
a duration of less than 1 ms and with an amplitude of few milliamperes. Transcranial 
methods for brain stimulation face the problem of delivering such a stimulus across the high 
resistance barrier of the periencephalic ‘layers’, including scalp, skull, meninges and 
cerebrospinal fluid.

Early approaches involved applying high-voltage electric stimuli through electrodes on the 
scalp. Although a large proportion of the current travels along the scalp between the 
electrodes, a small portion of the current penetrates the brain and activates neurons. This 
method, pioneered by Merton and Morton (1980), is known as transcranial electrical 
stimulation (TES; a term which should be differentiated from the generic term used for any 
transcranial electrical stimulation method, usually abbreviated as TES, and including those 
employing weak electric currents, see below). TES did have the huge merit of introducing a 
neurophysiological technique for studying for the first time excitability and propagation 
properties along central nervous system fibers in intact and cooperative human beings. 
However, the fields of application declined rapidly with the introduction of transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 1985 by Barker et al. (1985) because high-voltage TES is 
uncomfortable.

Another important electrical stimulation approach, which is not covered in this review, is 
low-intensity transcranial electrical stimulation using low-intensity currents applied through 
scalp electrodes (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000). The most common protocol is transcranial 
direct current stimulation in which a constant current of 1–2 mA is applied continuously for 
10–20 min. Currents of this magnitude cannot directly initiate action potentials in a resting 
cell or its axon; instead they cause small changes in the membrane potential of cell bodies or 
the axonal terminations of neurons and have been proven to modulate spontaneous firing 
rates (Nitsche and Paulus, 2011; Paulus et al., 2013; Filmer et al., 2014). This is thought to 
bias excitability of populations of neurons and influence information transmission in neural 
networks. Finally, many other techniques of TES have been proposed for more than a 
century (Guleyupoglu et al., 2013), using, for example, non-polarizing high-frequency

alternating current (Reato et al., 2013).

2.1. Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) using short-duration high-intensity pulses

High-voltage TES delivers a capacitively coupled pulse that has a time constant of 50–100 
μs duration and an electrical potential difference of several hundred Volts using a bipolar 
electrode arrangement. It produces a brisk sensation because it activates local pain receptors 
in the skin and causes local contraction of scalp muscles. In the motor cortex, neural 
stimulation occurs preferentially in the cortex underlying the anode and elicits motor evoked 
potentials (MEPs) on the opposite side of the body. A single pulse of anodal stimulation 
delivered on the scalp elicits brain current that enters superficial dendrites of pyramidal 
neurons of layer 5 and exits in deeper layers where it depolarizes the cell membrane and 
initiates an action potential. Experiments on primates using surface stimulation of the 
exposed cortex show that activation occurs in the subcortical white matter, a few nodes 
distant to the axon hillock region (Ranck, 1975; Amassian et al., 1987). The same is thought 
to be true in humans for TES (see below). As the action potentials descend to the spinal cord 
via the pyramidal tract, they can be recorded as a D-wave (D = direct, which reflects direct 
activation of axons). At higher intensities, the stimulus recruits synaptic inputs to the same 
corticospinal neurones, causing them to discharge at later intervals. This produces I-waves (I 
= indirect [synaptic] activation of corticospinal neurons), in recordings of the descending 
volleys from the spinal cord.

Initial invasive experiments characterised D- and I-waves in monkeys and cats (Adrian and 
Moruzzi, 1939; Patton and Amassian, 1954; Kernell and Chien-Ping, 1967; Amassian et al., 
1987; Edgley et al., 1997) (Fig. 1), and similar data have been obtained in humans by 
recording the descending activity produced by TES of motor cortex from electrodes inserted 
into the epidural space of the cervical spinal cord in patients during spinal surgery (Boyd et 
al., 1986; Berardelli et al., 1990; Burke et al., 1990, 1993; Thompson et al., 1991) and, more 
recently, in conscious patients implanted for pain control (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004a). The 
mechanisms that generate I-waves wave are still unclear (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004a): why 
should corticospinal neurones tend to discharge synchronously at a frequency of around 600 
Hz? One possibility is that the pyramidal neurons or a class of excitatory input neurons have 
an intrinsic capacity to discharge repetitively in response to a strong depolarizing input. 
Such fast spiking neurons have been described in somatosensory cortex (Ozaki and 
Hashimoto, 2011) in response to electrical stimulation of afferents in peripheral nerves 
(Baker et al., 2003). Other possibilities are reverberating chains of oscillating interneurons or 
even separate monosynaptic, di- and tri-synaptic inputs. Detailed neural models that have 
been developed incorporate both the intrinsic electrical properties of pyramidal cells as well 
as reasonable estimates of their inputs and can produce high frequency repetitive activity 
using known cortical circuitry (Esser et al., 2005; Rusu et al., 2014), but the technology to 
test the models using direct recordings of cortical neurons during stimulation is still being 
developed (Mueller et al., 2014).

TES at just supra-threshold intensity evokes a very short latency response (around 20 ms) in 
contralateral hand muscles when they are pre-activated (the motor evoked potential, MEP).

Very often no response is seen to the same stimulus in volunteers at rest; only when the 
intensity is increased do responses regularly occur in relaxed individuals, although these are 
often 2–3 ms or more later than the earliest onset in active muscle (Rossini et al., 1987a; 
Day et al., 1989). The reason for this “latency jump” between relaxed and contracted MEPs 
is that just supra-threshold pulses recruit only a single D-wave, which generates a 
monosynaptic EPSP onto spinal motoneurons. In resting motoneurons, this EPSP will be 
insufficient to bring the neuron to threshold. However, if motoneu-rons are near their 
discharge threshold, as most of them are during a mild voluntary contraction, they will fire 
an action potential and produce a short-latency EMG response in the hand. This hypothesis 
is partly confirmed by recordings in awake monkeys (Lemon et al., 1998). Recruitment of 
later I-waves at higher intensities produces a sequence of EPSPs that temporally summate 
and eventually discharge motoneurons, albeit at a longer latency than the initial D-wave 
(Day et al., 1989; Rossini et al., 1995). Another – non mutually exclusive – explanation is 
that the relaxed MEPs mainly reflect the activation of low-threshold, small and slowly 
propagating pyramidal tract neurons at the cortical level, while the contracted MEPs mainly 
reflect activation of higher-threshold central and peripheral pyramidal neurons having faster 
propagations and producing larger action potentials which finally govern large motor units in 
the target muscle (Liddel and Phillips, 1952; Henneman et al., 1974; Rossini et al., 1995). 
This issue is still a matter of debate. One should be aware that the volleys recorded from the 
spinal cord surface in humans do not necessarily reflect those to the target muscle from 
which the MEPs are recorded.

The repetitive discharge evoked by TES combined with the synaptic relays in the pathway 
from cortex to muscle makes the electromyographic (EMG) responses to TES (MEPs) more 
complex than the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recorded from electrical 
stimulation of a peripheral nerve (Day et al., 1989). Most of our knowledge has come from 
examination of TES-induced MEPs in small hand muscles to stimulation of the hand area of 
primary motor cortex (M1). These MEPs differ from CMAPs in three important respects. 
First, the threshold for evoking a MEP is lower in actively contracting muscle than it is in 
muscles at rest. Second, the latency of a MEP evoked at rest is often 1–3 ms longer than a 
response of the same size evoked in active muscle. Third, the MEP amplitude and shape 
differ from the peripherally evoked CMAPs. The shape of the MEP becomes polyphasic and 
the MEP has a longer duration than the peripherally evoked CMAP, particularly at high 
intensities of stimulation. The maximal MEP amplitude evoked by a single stimulus is 
always substantially lower than the maximal CMAP amplitude evoked by supramaximal 
peripheral electrical stimulation (Rossini et al., 1987a; Day et al., 1989). In contrast to 
peripherally evoked CMAPs, cortically evoked MEPs show substantial trial-to-trial 
variability even when extrinsic stimulation settings, such as stimulus intensity and position 
are kept constant. This variability can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations of corticomotor 
excitability, both cortical and spinal.

The reason why the threshold is lower during contraction than at rest is that, in a contracting 
muscle, spinal motoneurons are firing randomly and the effect of a liminal excitatory input 
from the corticospinal tract (CST) will be to advance and synchronize the activity of 
motoneurons that were just about to discharge (see Day et al., 1989). A single TES evoked 
descending volley can therefore discharge the spinal motoneurons during a tonic contraction

while the same volley cannot do so at rest. Resting motoneurons will require a larger 
descending input to evoke an MEP. The lowest threshold volley evoked by TES is the D-
wave initiated in the cortex and its threshold is unaffected by volitional contraction (Di 
Lazzaro et al., 1998). H-reflex measurements provide further support for a spinal mechanism 
mediating at least in part the reduction in corticomotor threshold during voluntary 
contraction of the target muscle (Day et al., 1987).

Regarding factors that contribute to the shorter latency of MEPs under active conditions, one 
should note that the latency of descending corticospinal volleys recorded from the spinal 
cord is similar in active and relaxed muscles (Di Lazzaro et al., 1998, 1999b). As noted 
above, the D-wave evoked during active contraction produces an excitatory input to the 
spinal motor pool that is capable of recruiting already-firing motor units and produce a MEP. 
At rest, TES brings spinal motoneurons to threshold at a later time and this accounts for the 
later onset of MEP in relaxed muscle (Day et al., 1987). If the stimulus intensity is 
increased, later I-waves are recruited and their excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) 
summate at motoneurons with the EPSP from the initial D-wave, leading to larger MEPs. It 
is worth noting that with TES, large MEPs tend to have a shorter latency than small MEPs 
(particularly in relaxed muscle) (Rothwell et al., 1987; Day et al., 1987). This would be in 
accordance with the size principle of motor unit recruitment, discussed later, such that larger 
motoneurons with faster conducting peripheral motor axons are recruited in the larger MEP 
and therefore the latency is correspondingly shorter (Henneman, 1985). However a larger D 
wave produced by suprathreshold stimuli would also contribute to this.

The final difference between MEPs and peripheral CMAPs is that MEPs are more 
polyphasic especially at high stimulus intensities. As the intensity of the pulse increases, the 
number of descending volleys increases, each of which may produce EPSPs in spinal 
motoneurons. The net effect is that the motoneurons may discharge on receipt of anyone of 
these, leading to temporally dispersed activation of motor units and a polyphasic MEP. In 
fact, the multiple descending inputs can even cause some single units to discharge twice 
within the same MEP (Day et al., 1989). This can be confirmed by collision methods. If 
correctly timed, a supramaximal CMAP can collide with the orthodromic activity in 
peripheral motor axons set up by a high intensity transcranial pulse. If spinal motoneurons 
discharge only once in response to the transcranial input, then there should be total collision 
with the antidromic activity set up by the CMAP. In the EMG, all that will be visible is the 
CMAP. However, if transcranial or proximal peripheral stimulation made motoneurons fire 
twice the second discharge of the units will be visible following the CMAP, unless the 
collision is incomplete due to motoneuron loss (Day et al., 1987; see also Magistris et al., 
1999, for application to TMS evoked MEPs). Finally, it is important to remember that 
although the initial response of a muscle to TES is caused by activity in rapidly conducting 
monosynaptic corticospinal projections (the corticomotoneuronal connection), the same 
stimulus can also activate other slower conducting and probably multi-synaptic inputs. These 
are often not visible in the EMG because they sit in the “shadow” of the large 
corticomotoneuronal MEP. However, they can be revealed by using H-reflexes to test 
motoneuron excitability in response to sub-MEP threshold stimulation in relaxed muscle 
(Cowan et al., 1986). Following the initial period of excitation, there is often a short period 
of inhibition, which is probably due to activation of the Ia reciprocal inhibitory interneuron

in the spinal cord. This is followed by a longer phase of excitation, some of which might 
result from the activation of propriospinal interneurons by the initial descending volley 
(Mazevet et al., 1996; Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke, 2012).

As mentioned previously both for TES and TMS, there is a clear “latency jump” of about 3 
ms when MEPs are recorded in relaxed and contracting MEPs (Merton and Morton, 1980; 
Merton et al., 1982). The “latency jump” and amplitude facilitation observed in MEPs 
during contraction vs. relaxation involves a number of mainly spinal mechanisms, 
presumably including the size principle of motoneuron recruitment (Henneman et al., 1965; 
Desmedt, 1983; Rossini et al., 1985, 1987a,b).

2.2. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

TMS uses electromagnetic induction as a highly effective painless way to generate 
suprathreshold current in the brain, much as does TES. A simple TMS device consists of a 
few circular turns of copper wire connected to the terminals of a large electrical capacitance 
via a switch. The capacitance is discharged by closing the switch so that a large current of 
several thousands Amps flows transiently through the wire coil for a period of less than 1 
ms. This large current can have a monophasic or biphasic pulse configuration. The 
monophasic current pulse consists of a strong initial current which is balanced by a 
dampened return current. Only the first phase of the stimulus produces current flow in the 
stimulated brain: the dampened reverse current produces no neuronal stimulation. In 
biphasic pulse configuration an initial current rise is followed by a reversed current and by a 
subsequent increase of current: therefore, the current direction is reversed twice during a 
biphasic pulse. Both phases of the biphasic pulse induce physiologically significant current 
fluxes in brain tissue, and these flow in the same or opposite direction. Because the reversal 
phase is longer and wider than the initial rising phase and the second phase is more effective 
for biphasic TMS (Kammer et al., 2001; Groppa et al., 2012). The monophasic or biphasic 
current pulse produces a rapidly changing and brief magnetic field at the orthogonal angles 
to the coil plane. The peak magnetic field strength is similar to that of the static field in a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner (1–2 T). Magnetic fields readily penetrate into 
the brain without attenuation by the scalp or skull and generate a current according to the 
Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction (Fig. 2). Several comprehensive reviews on the 
technical aspects of magnetic stimulators are available in the literature and are beyond the 
scope of the present document (Kammer et al., 2001; Sauve and Crowther, 2014).

2.2.1. TMS coil design (Fig. 3)—TMS was introduced using large circular coils of wire 
with a diameter of around 10 cm. When a circular coil configuration is used for TMS, 
stimulation is most effective circularly under the coil with minimal stimulation in the center 
of the ring. When the circular coil is placed tangentially on the scalp, the site of stimulation 
covers a large area of brain but the depth of penetration into the brain is small: the intensity 
of the induced current falls as a matter of distance following a mathematical function; for 
instance, at a given strength of stimulation, the resulting current intensity induced 5 cm from 
the coil surface is only about 1/3 of the peak value (Mills et al., 1987). Thus, the stimulation 
of deep structures always comes at the cost of stimulation at higher intensity of the more 
shallow ones using “classical” coils. This problem has not been solved even by specific coils

which have been designed to stimulate deep structures, such as the “H-coil” (Zangen et al., 
2005). Shallower stimulation will result in a concurrent and more intense focal neural 
stimulation, achieved by overlapping two small round coils with oppositely directed currents 
into a figure-of-eight shape (Ueno and Matsuda, 1992). The figure-of-eight coil is classically 
used to stimulate a given brain region more selectively, for example in the context of 
therapeutic applications of TMS or for brain mapping. The smaller the diameter the more 
focal the TMS and the more rapidly the coil heats up during repetitive stimulation. Recent 
reviews have addressed this issue, comparing the various types of coil used in TMS practice 
(see Peterchev et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2014).

2.2.2. TMS recruits I-waves at lower thresholds than D-waves—Most of the basic 
principles discussed earlier for TES are also valid for TMS. However, there is one important 
difference between TMS and TES. TMS of the motor cortex tends to activate I-waves at 
lower intensities than the D-wave, although this depends on coil orientation (Di Lazzaro et 
al., 2004a).

Most of the reported data comes from motor cortex stimulation, and the most direct evidence 
comes from epidural recordings from the spinal cord in conscious patients. They show that 
the earliest wave recruited by TES, the presumed D-wave, is not recruited at threshold by a 
TMS pulse. Dependent on coil orientation, TMS of the motor cortex evokes a wave 
corresponding to the I1 wave, and the D-wave is only recruited at intensities much greater 
than threshold. The resulting effect of this can be observed in MEP recordings. When MEPs 
are recorded in voluntarily activated muscle, the minimal latencies can be measured, and 
MEP latency at just-suprathreshold intensities is usually approximately 1.5 ms longer than 
the latency of similarsized MEPs evoked by TES. At higher intensities, the latency to TMS 
shortens and becomes equal to TES, because the stronger TMS evokes D-waves (Day et al., 
1989; Di Lazzaro et al., 2004b). Whether this concept generalizes to all areas of cortex is 
unknown, and more research on non-motor areas should be carried out. Even in the motor 
cortex there is some debate over the extent to which this is true for TMS of the leg area as 
compared with the arm area. Early studies that used the same single motor unit and surface 
EMG approaches in the tibialis anterior muscle suggested that, in contrast to stimulation of 
the hand area, TES and TMS of the leg area both evoke D-waves (Priori et al., 1993; Terao 
et al., 1994; Nielsen et al., 1995). However, recordings from the thoracic cord suggested that 
TMS tended to evoke I-waves rather than D-waves (Di Lazzaro et al., 2001b; Terao et al., 
2000).

2.2.3. What and where does TMS stimulate?—Both TES and TMS stimulate axons 
rather than cell bodies of neurons since the latter have a much longer electrical time constant 
and higher threshold. This has been confirmed experimentally by comparing the strength–
duration (S–D) time constants of peripheral nerve and cortex. Measurements made with 
varying durations of electrical pulses yield similar S–D time constants for both nerve and 
cortex suggesting that their targets are large diameter myelinated axons (Burke et al., 2000). 
Two key features need to be considered. The first is that the currents induced in the brain by 
TMS (and TES) have an important directional component. In the case of TMS, early 
modeling studies of the induced electric field showed that charge build-up at surface

boundaries makes the majority of induced current flow parallel to the surface of the brain, 
rather than perpendicular to the grey matter (Tofts and Branston, 1991). The second concept 
is that the threshold for stimulation of neurons depends strongly on the relative current 
direction: axons are best stimulated by that component of current that flows nearly in 
parallel with their main orientation. This explains why electrical stimulation occurs best with 
the anode and cathode placed along the length of a peripheral nerve rather perpendicular to 
it. In fact, the physics of nerve stimulation state that if we take an axon, then it will be best 
activated at the point where the second spatial derivative of the electric field along its length 
is maximal. With respect to TMS, this means that stimulation often occurs at the point where 
the axon bends out of the field and the change in electric field is greatest (Maccabee et al., 
1993). Thus EMG responses to TMS at just supra-threshold intensities are usually 1.5 ms or 
so later than after TES. At higher intensities, the latency to TMS shortens and approaches 
that of TES when TMS finally evokes D-waves (Di Lazzaro et al., 2004b). Detailed 
modeling studies of the electric field distributions induced by TMS in realistic models of the 
brain are still being undertaken (Thielscher et al., 2011; Laakso et al., 2014a, 2014b).

Day et al. (1989) initially argued that with TMS stimulation is most likely to occur in the 
part of the motor cortex nearest to the scalp surface, which would correspond to the crown of 
the anterior bank of the central sulcus. If TMS induced horizontal current flow through this 
region, then it would be unlikely to activate pyramidal neurons directly (and evoke D-
waves). Instead, it was postulated that TMS might preferentially activate horizontally 
oriented axons of cortical interneurons that activated pyramidal neurons trans-synaptically 
(I1-waves). Later, imaging studies have suggested that this assumption was erroneous, 
because motor cortex TMS evoked activation deep in the central sulcus using PET 
assessment (Fox et al., 2004) or distant from the site of stimulation using fMRI assessment 
(Bestmann et al., 2004). However, these results do not allow identification of the precise 
location of TMS-induced axonal activation, because this site may be different from the 
neural structures identified by functional brain imaging. The biological effect depends on the 
neuronal circuits that are finally recruited and can be anatomically different from the site 
where axons are activated by the TMS-induced electrical field. An example is seen with the 
analgesic effects resulting from motor cortex stimulation (Lefaucheur, 2013). Therefore, 
modeling studies may be more relevant than imaging studies to determine where TMS 
activation occurs in the brain. Several detailed modeling studies, mostly of motor cortex 
stimulation, have taken into account tissue inhomogeneities in the cortex as well as 
boundaries between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF/grey and grey/white matter), and have shown 
that induced electric fields are strongest in the crown of the gyrus, although there can also be 
hot spots within the subcortical white matter (Opitz et al., 2013). When this type of 
calculation is combined with models of typical varieties of cortical and subcortical neurons, 
it seems likely that TMS of the motor cortex will activate cortical interneurons in the gyral 
crown or lip of the sulcus, as well as pyramidal neurons in the lip of the sulcus or slightly 
deeper (Salvador et al., 2011; Opitz et al., 2013). Excitation threshold depends on the 
orientation and membrane properties of the axons impacted by the TMS-induced electrical 
field. The influence of subcortical white matter activation remains to be studied in detail, but 
could well be important since the subcortical white matter is primarily composed of the 
axons of cortico-cortical loop fibers which may well have strong connections to the

corticospinal output neurons. Indeed, another modeling study has proposed that the 
activation site in TMS involves the crown, anterior bank and white matter (Laakso et al., 
2014a). The results of imaging studies employing neurovascular coupling reflect the 
cumulative effects of TMS over several seconds, not merely the one triggered by the initial 
part of the stimulus as reflected in the MEP, and prudence should be employed in 
considering the conclusions of such studies.

2.2.4. Stimulation with TMS is directionally specific—When a figure-of-eight TMS 
coil is placed over the hand area of motor cortex, thresholds from a monophasic stimulator 
are lowest when the coil is oriented to produce an approximately posterior–anterior (PA) 
current flow perpendicular to the central sulcus (Werhahn et al., 1994; Sakai et al., 1997). 
Recordings of descending corticospinal activity from the spinal epidural space suggest 
preferential recruitment of the first I-wave (I1-wave) (Di Lazzaro et al., 2001c). If the coil 
orientation on the scalp is reversed to induce an anterior–posterior (AP) current then the first 
recruited I-waves often occur 1–3 ms later (Di Lazzaro et al., 2001c). Similar differences in 
latency are evident in the surface EMG recorded MEPs (Werhahn et al., 1994; Sakai et al., 
1997). It is not clear whether the late I-waves from AP stimulation are the same late I-waves 
as recruited by higher intensity PA current (Di Lazzaro and Ziemann, 2013). Nevertheless, 
changing the current direction seems to recruit different inputs to the corticospinal output 
neurons. Orienting the coil to induce a latero-medial current reduces the threshold for D-
wave activation (Di Lazzaro et al., 1998). All these differences are less evident at higher 
intensities of stimulation. Interestingly, the extent to which they are present differs between 
individuals, possibly meaning that they depend on details of individual neuroanatomy and 
tissue anisotropy, such as the orientation and location of neurons relative to the TMS coil; 
needless to say, this aspect is valid for any type of cortical area and not only for the motor 
cortex. Models of electric fields induced by TMS can account for some of this selectivity 
and have been recently implemented (Rotem et al., 2014). They show that larger fields are 
induced in the crown of the precentral gyrus by perpendicular than parallel stimulation. 
However, they do not readily explain why there is a difference between PA and AP 
stimulation, particularly if TMS primarily activates horizontal interneurons at the gyral 
surface (Salvador et al., 2011; Day et al., 1989). This is because these neurons are 
distributed isotropically and therefore should be equally well activated by both AP and PA 
directionality of TMS. Since this cannot be the case, it suggests that some other (at present 
unknown) elements are stimulated preferentially by PA stimulation.

These observations relate to monophasic magnetic pulses, which are commonly used for 
single-pulse experiments, while repetitive TMS (rTMS) is usually performed with biphasic 
stimuli because of a lower energy requirement (Sommer et al., 2006). Biphasic stimulation is 
thought to be more powerful than monophasic stimulation, in particular in producing motor 
evoked potentials (MEPs) (Kammer et al., 2001). However, rTMS using monophasic pulses 
activates a relatively uniform population of neurons and could therefore be more effective in 
producing sustained after-effects than biphasic pulses which generate a more complex 
pattern of neural activation. For example, MEP size reduction following 1 Hz-rTMS 
delivered over M1 (Taylor and Loo, 2007) and MEP enhancement following 10 Hz-rTMS 
(Arai et al., 2007) are more marked and prolonged when monophasic pulses are used.

Importantly, the effects of monophasic and biphasic magnetic pulses can be compared only 
if the second and decisive phase of the biphasic pulse is taken as the equivalent of the initial 
monophasic pulse (Di Lazzaro et al., 2001a; Sommer et al., 2013). Studies may be confusing 
when the initial phase of the biphasic pulse is retained for comparison, also given that the 
direction of the current can be reversed depending on the manufacturer (Kammer et al., 
2001).

3. TMS in clinical settings

TMS of the motor cortex has a well-established role in clinical neurophysiology and is used 
worldwide to assess the conduction of the descending cortico-nuclear and cortico-spinal 
connections (Table 1). The motor cortex is a favoured target area for neuros-cientific studies 
because changes in motor activation and excitability can be readily assessed by recording 
MEPs. Neurophysiological measures, such as corticomotor threshold (MT), MEP amplitude 
and latency, Cortical Silent Period (CSP) duration, Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) 
or MEP recruitment curves among others, can be used to provide evidence of disease-related 
changes in motor cortical control or corticospinal output in patients. However, as for any 
other neurophysiological variables, each laboratory needs to establish its own normative data 
set for reliable diagnostic testing in clinical practice.

4. Motor threshold

In clinical practice and in scientific studies, the intensity of TMS is individually adjusted to 
the “cortical” Motor Threshold (MT) defined as the minimal intensity of motor cortex 
stimulation required to elicit a reliable MEP of minimal amplitude in the target muscle. 
Lowest thresholds are found for hand and forearm muscles, followed by progressively 
higher thresholds for truncal, lower limb and pelvic musculature (Tables 2 and 3). Face 
musculature can also be examined, but this is more difficult because the facial nerve and 
muscles can be directly stimulated in the TMS-induced electrical field, resulting in 
contamination of “cortical” MEPs by “direct” peripheral neuromuscular responses and facial 
muscle reflexes (i.e. blink reflex).

As previously stated the MT can be defined as the lowest transcranial stimulus intensity at 
which TMS of motor cortex produces an EMG response in the ‘target’ muscle or a visible 
muscle twitch. However, even if a twitch-based MT estimation is easier to perform, MT 
determination based on this is discouraged because it is associated with high intra- and inter-
rater variability. In addition, visually estimated twitch-based MTs are approximately 10% 
(0–30%) higher than MTs determined on EMG recordings (Westin et al., 2014).

Intrinsic fluctuations of the excitability of cortical and spinal neurons cause trial-to-trial 
variability in MEP amplitude. This “physiological noise” introduces some uncertainty when 
estimating the MT (Adrian and Moruzzi, 1939). While physiological noise cannot be 
eliminated, other technical and physiological variables can and should be kept constant 
during MT measurements, such as coil position and orientation, the motor state (e.g. 
background activity of the target muscle), the individual arousal level, and environmental 
noise. Before determining MT, the optimal position and orientation of the coil for

stimulation of the target muscle has to be identified (cf. sections on mapping and basic 
physiology).

4.1. Determining the “cortical” motor threshold

Resting MT (RMT) is determined while the target test muscle is at rest. Complete relaxation 
can be controlled by checking the absence of EMG at high-gain amplification either visually 
or by acoustic feedback or both. Active MT (AMT) is usually determined during a slight 
tonic contraction of the target muscle at approximately 20% of the maximal muscle strength. 
The active MT corresponds closely to the threshold for inducing descending volleys in the 
fast-conducting neurons of the corticospinal tract. This is because the first recruited 
descending volleys are able to effectively discharge those spinal motoneurons that are close 
to firing threshold in an active condition.

MEP responses to individual, successive stimuli when elicited in active muscles using 
threshold intensities may fluctuate in amplitude from 0 to about 1 mV, with a median value 
around 0.2 mV. If relaxed, variability is less, around 0–0.5 mV.

The following procedure is recommended to define the MT precisely using a figure-of-eight 
coil (see also Groppa et al., 2012) (Figs. 4 and 5). Localize the “hot spot” with the coil on 
M1 contralateral to the examined limb (cf. section on mapping). The lowest threshold for the 
hand area can usually be determined by orienting the coil 45° towards the contralateral 
forehead in order to guarantee current flow approximately perpendicular to the central 
sulcus. Orientation is at least as critical as position (Sakai et al., 1997; Opitz et al., 2013). 
For stimulation of the foot area (abductor hallucis muscle) a lateral orientation of the handle 
of the butterfly or figure-of-8 perpendicular to the interhemispheric cleft (i.e. lateral) 
produces the highest MEP amplitudes and shortest latencies. However Richter et al. (2013) 
report that rotating the coil ~30° anteriorly results in a MT that is lower by 8.0 ± 5.9% of 
maximal stimulator output compared with the standard lateral orientation.

The following methods have been used for MT determination.

4.1.1. Relative frequency methods—The relative frequency method has been described 
in the 1994 “Report” (Rossini et al., 1994) and recently modified slightly (Groppa et al., 
2012): TMS should start with a subthreshold intensity. One may start with a stimulus 
intensity of 35% of the maximal stimulator output (MSO) with the coil placed over the 
optimal site for stimulation. To determine RMT, stimulus intensity is gradually increased in 
steps of 5% MSO until TMS consistently evokes MEPs with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 
>50 μV in each trial. Thereafter, stimulus intensity is gradually lowered in steps of 1% MSO 
until there are less than 5 positive responses out of 10 trials. This stimulus intensity plus 1 is 
then defined as RMT. In active muscles with ongoing activity, MEPs greater than 0.1 mV 
(100 μV) are judged to be positive. Of note, an analogous procedure for MT determination 
has been used in classic physiology with direct cortical stimulation in experimental 
preparations (Patton and Amassian, 1954). The procedure is more complicated for AMT 
than RMT, since TMS interferes with the ability to maintain a steady muscle contraction 
with stable background EMG activity of 10–20% of maximal contraction (Rossini et al.,

1995). As with any other method, accuracy increases with the number of stimuli per 
intensity level.

However, when using at least 5 positive MEPs out of 10 trials (Groppa et al., 2012) it has 
been calculated that measurement accuracy, defined as “probability to obtain a 
diagnostically acceptable estimator for this subject exceeds 0.95” (Awiszus, 2012), is only 
47.6%. With 10 MEPs out of 20 trials (Rossini et al., 1994) accuracy is 96.2% (Awiszus, 
2012). On this basis it can be said that for both for clinical and research purposes 10 out of 
20 trials are required to produce reproducible results.

4.1.2. Adaptive methods—Adaptive methods use an S-shaped metric function to model 
the probabilistic nature of MT and the relationship between TMS intensity and the 
probability of eliciting a MEP. At each trial, the model recalculates by an adaptive stair-case 
procedure a TMS intensity that yields a 50% probability of evoking a MEP which is then 
selected as the intensity for the next TMS pulse. Examples of adaptive methods to determine 
the MT are Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) (Awiszus, 2003) and 
Maximum Likelihood Regression. A computer program is necessary to run the maximum-
likelihood threshold tracking algorithm, and was made freely available by Awiszus and 
Borckardt (“Adaptive PEST” http://www.clinicalresearcher.org/software.htm (Mishory et al., 
2004)).

As summarized recently (Groppa et al., 2012), a typical program starts with defining an 
upper and lower boundary. A conservative approach uses 0% of MSO as lower boundary and 
100% as upper boundary. More effectively, one might select the boundaries based on the 
known threshold distribution in the target population (e.g. ±20%). 14 up to 17 stimuli 
without specific a priori assumptions have been calculated to be necessary for reliable MT 
estimation (Awiszus, 2011). In the only study carrying out a comparative analysis for 
adaptive methods (Silbert et al., 2013) it was concluded that the relative frequency method 
requires significantly more trials than the PEST method (see below). The median difference 
between PEST and relative frequency estimates of MT was 2.3% of MSO with a maximal 
individual difference of up to 5%: higher MTs were found for PEST (Silbert et al., 2013).

As a conclusion, each of the methods described above can be used in research or clinical 
settings to provide a sufficiently accurate MT estimation. However, adaptive methods based 
on threshold-tracking algorithms provide a more accurate and usually faster MT estimation 
because it may require a smaller number of stimuli (Awiszus, 2011; Qi et al., 2011).

5. MEP amplitude

The MEP is commonly recorded over the target muscle using surface electrodes in a bipolar 
belly-tendon arrangement. The placement of the electrodes and the filter and amplification 
settings are identical to the standards used for recording the CMAP evoked by peripheral 
nerve stimulation (PNS). However, the peripherally evoked and transcranially evoked motor 
responses have different neurobiological properties, and these need to be considered when 
using the MEP amplitude as a neurophysiological measure of corticomotor excitability. 
These differences were discussed earlier and explain why the TMS-evoked and PNS-evoked

motor responses only resemble each other: there are differences in amplitude, duration, and 
shape.

5.1. Temporal dispersion of corticomotor excitation

As described in detail in the previous sections a single TMS pulse applied to M1 gives rise 
to a series of temporally dispersed descending corticospinal volleys (Di Lazzaro et al., 
2004a; Groppa et al., 2012; but see Rusu et al., 2014 on the plausibility of an alternative 
mechanism behind D- and I-wave generation through computational modeling). At spinal 
level the dispersed corticospinal volleys result in activation of motoneurons at slightly 
different latencies, dependent on their thresholds, and this asynchrony is accentuated by 
conduction in the peripheral nerve. This produces phase cancellation of motor unit potentials 
(MUAPs) and MEPs that are significantly less synchronized, more prolonged, and of lower 
amplitude than CMAPs (Rossini et al., 1995; Magistris et al., 1998). This observation cannot 
be overcome during brain stimulation by increasing the TMS intensity. In fact, phase 
cancellation of the motor unit potentials contributing to the whole MEP is prominent at high 
stimulation intensities and causes a discrepancy between the size of the mechanical and 
electrical muscle response to TMS. At TMS intensities that cause maximal stimulation of 
the fast-conducting corticomotor pathway, TMS elicits a muscle twitch in the target muscle 
that can exceed the force of muscle twitches evoked by supramaximal peripheral nerve 
stimulation. This is because some motoneurons may discharge more than once to the intense 
corticospinal volley.

Phase cancellation of MUAPs can be reduced to a level that is comparable to PNS with a 
triple stimulation technique (TST). The TST is a collision method that has been introduced 
by Magistris et al. (1998) and “resynchronizes” corticomotor excitation at the level of the 
peripheral motor axon. MEP amplitudes recorded with TST closely match that of the 
maximal electrically evoked CMAP so that the MEP/CMAP ratio in normal subjects is close 
to 1. TST can be implemented as a clinical routine procedure to assess corticomotor 
conduction to distal limb muscles in patients, but has been rarely employed in 
neuroscientific studies on healthy individuals.

5.2. The effect of stimulus intensity

Both, extrinsic factors (e.g. ‘conditioning’ stimuli preceding a ‘test’ TMS stimulus) and 
intrinsic factors (e.g. the mental activity) can change corticomotor excitability and change 
MEP amplitude. As a general rule, increasing the stimulus intensity will induce a stronger 
descending excitatory drive resulting in faster temporospatial summation at the cortico-
motoneuronal synapses, and MEP amplitude increases gradually with increasing stimulus 
intensity. The relationship between stimulus intensity and MEP amplitude can be formally 
modeled by a cumulative Gaussian and described by a sigmoid curve (Devanne et al., 1997; 
Pitcher et al., 2003; Möller et al., 2009). The sigmoid curve indicating the relationship 
between stimulus intensity and MEP amplitude is called the “stimulus–response curve”, 
“recruitment curve”, or “input–output curve”. The initial segment of the sigmoid curve is 
relatively flat and deviates from zero at the stimulus intensity that corresponds to the MT. 
The second part of the sigmoid curve is an ascending line caused by an approximately linear 
increase in MEP amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity. This part of the recruitment

curve corresponds to TMS intensities between 120% and 140% of resting MT (Davey et al., 
1999; Han et al., 2001). The stimulus–response relationship can then be assessed by 
calculation of the amplitude ratio of the MEP obtained at 140% of resting MT to that 
obtained at 120% (Lefaucheur et al., 2006a) or of the slope of the IO-curve within this range 
of stimulation intensities (Lefaucheur et al., 2012). This slope reflects the gain in MEP 
amplitude with increasing stimulus intensity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has 
revealed a positive correlation between the slope of the MEP input–output curve (IO-curve) 
and cortical glutamate levels in the motor cortex, suggesting a link between glutamatergic 
neurotransmission and corticospinal excitability (Stagg et al., 2011). At higher stimulus 
intensities, the stimulus–response curve plateaus with no further increase in MEP amplitude 
despite of an increase in stimulus intensity. The plateau at high stimulus intensities is due in 
part to the increasing phase cancellation of the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) that 
constitute the MEP (Magistris et al., 1998). In summary, the stimulus–response curve is 
determined by the progressively higher number of recruited corticospinal fibers and the 
temporal dispersion of the spikes propagating along the corticomotor pathways. Therefore, 
clinical use of the MEP IO-curve has been promoted in acute (e.g. stroke) and slowly 
progressive (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) diseases affecting the number of pyramidal 
tract fibers.

An increase in neural excitability at the cortical or spinal level, due to, e.g., voluntary 
contraction of the target muscle, will facilitate corticomotor excitability and result in larger 
MEP amplitudes without a change in stimulus intensity. This implies that the sigmoid 
stimulus–response function reflecting the relation between stimulus intensity and MEP 
amplitude is not invariant, but is subject to dynamic changes which reflect the present 
physiological state of the motor system. For instance, different IO-curves will be obtained in 
the same muscle depending on whether the target muscle is relaxed or active, in a movement 
preparation period, or in a condition of mental motor imagery without real contraction (Starr 
et al., 1988; Rossini et al., 1988; Tomberg and Caramia, 1991). The flexible tuning of the 
stimulus–response function by physiological variables explains why measurements of MEP 
amplitude are the most popular electrophysiological “read out” to assess after-effects of 
repetitive TMS and other non-invasive brain stimulation protocols applied over M1 on 
corticospinal excitability (Siebner and Rothwell, 2003; Ziemann et al., 2008).

5.3. Inter-trial variability of MEP amplitude

Intrinsic fluctuations in neural excitability at the cortical and spinal levels render the MEP 
amplitude highly variable even in an apparently resting state with complete relaxation of the 
‘target’ muscle. This intrinsic trial-to-trial variability has to be taken into account when 
measuring threshold under resting conditions (Rossini et al., 1994) and using the mean MEP 
amplitude as a state marker of corticomotor excitability (Wassermann, 2002). Recent TMS–
EEG studies have shown that TMS-induced MEP amplitudes depend on the state of ongoing 
EEG phase and power fluctuations which may account at least partially for the inter-trial 
variability of MEP amplitudes (Bergmann et al., 2012; Ferreri et al., 2014b; Keil et al., 
2014). For instance, MEPs are consistently larger when evoked during the up-states than 
during down-states of slow oscillations in non-REM sleep (Bergmann et al., 2012). During 
wakefulness, the MEP amplitude correlate with the power and phase of EEG and EMG

activity in a frequency band around 18 Hz, and high beta-band cortico-muscular coherence 
shows a positive linear relationship with the MEP amplitude (Keil et al., 2014). Together, 
these results show that the inter-trial variability of MEP amplitudes may contain important 
information about the state-dependency of corticomotor excitability (Ferreri et al., 2014b).

5.4. Measuring MEP size

The size of a single MEP is usually expressed as peak-to-peak amplitude, but the “area 
under the curve” of the rectified MEP or the amplitude from pre-MEP baseline can also be 
used. As mentioned above, intrinsic fluctuations of neural excitability at the cortical and 
spinal levels introduce a substantial variability of the MEP amplitude from trial to trial. 
Therefore, several MEPs need to be consecutively recorded to obtain a reliable estimate of 
the MEP size. This is particularly relevant in TMS studies during which MEP amplitude 
measurements need to be repeated several times during the same experiment. In this context 
neuronavigated TMS is advantageous to monitor coil position relative to the cortical target 
site and to correct any shift in coil position or angulation during serial measurements.

MEP amplitude measured at a single TMS intensity provides no information about the 
stimulus–response characteristics of corticospinal excitability. TMS intensities are usually 
expressed as a percentage of either individual MT or MSO. MEP measurements can be 
performed during relaxation or during tonic contraction of the target muscle. The stimulus–
response relationship between TMS intensity and MEP amplitude can then be determined by 
averaging the MEP amplitudes for each intensity level. Alternatively, the MEP amplitudes 
for each trial are plotted against the corresponding TMS intensity and the stimulus–response 
function is derived by curve fitting, e.g., by fitting a Boltzmann function. A change in 
corticospinal excitability may result in a right- or leftward shift of the entire stimulus–
response curve and/or a change in its slope depending on whether the excitability change is 
similarly expressed across the entire intensity range or not. Hysteresis effects have been 
described for TMS at a relatively short inter-trial interval of 5 s (but not 20 s) in the relaxed 
(but not active) target muscle and may introduce systematic biases in clinical and research 
studies (Möller et al., 2009). Stimulus–response curves are not static but undergo rapid 
modifications under physiological conditions. A simple example is a change in motor state 
of the target muscle from rest to tonic contraction, which will result in a leftward shift of the 
curve, a steeper slope and a higher maximal amplitude. Motor skill training can also change 
the recruitment curve. After motor skill training of rapid wrist extension, the slope of the 
recruitment curve of the agonist muscle increased, while the slope decreased in the 
antagonist muscle (Suzuki et al., 2012). Further, stimulus–response curves can be modified 
by CNS-active drugs. For example, lorazepam and lamotrigine suppress the stimulus–
response curve in healthy individuals (Boroojerdi et al., 2001) (for recent review, see 
Ziemann et al., 2014).

The stimulus–response curve is altered by neurological diseases that impair corticomotor 
conduction. Within the central nervous system, a disease-related loss of corticospinal axons, 
conduction block or demyelination may result in an attenuated slope of the stimulus–
response curve and reduced maximal amplitude. Accordingly, abnormal stimulus–response 
curves have been reported in patients with motor stroke (Ward et al., 2006) and amyotrophic

lateral sclerosis [ALS] (Vucic and Kiernan, 2007). In patients with chronic motor stroke, the 
slope of the stimulus–response curve predicted the magnitude of task-related brain activation 
(Ward et al., 2006). The flatter the slope of the stimulus–response curve, the more patients 
recruited secondary motor networks in both hemispheres “in an attempt to generate motor 
output to spinal cord motoneurons” (Ward et al., 2006). In ALS, the stimulus–response 
curve often shows hyperexcitability of the corticospinal neurons, especially in the early 
stages of the disease (Vucic et al., 2013). It is worth pointing out that the stimulus–response 
curve is also sensitive to disease-related alterations in corticospinal excitability in conditions 
which do not cause structural damage to the CST, e.g. Parkinson’s disease (Valls-Solé et al., 
1994) and dystonia (Siebner et al., 1999) (cf. Table 1).

5.5. Practical considerations

The estimation of the probabilistic distribution of MEP amplitudes is relevant in scientific 
studies of corticospinal excitability and requires a large number of MEPs to be recorded for 
each muscle. In many studies, however, experimental constraints allow only the assessment 
of the MEP size at a single intensity rather than assessing the entire stimulus–response 
curve. In these situations, TMS intensity is usually set to 115–125% of the individual’s RMT 
to ensure that the experiment probes the MEP size on the rising phase of the stimulus–
response curve where there is a roughly linear increase with TMS intensity. Many plasticity 
studies target an intensity that generates a MEP size of about 1 mV, or MEP size of half 
maximum.

In contrast to scientific studies, the primary goal of diagnostic TMS is to elicit a maximal 
corticomotor response. Hence, TMS intensity should be sufficiently high to excite all high-
threshold, fast-conducting corticospinal neurons and spinal motoneurons (Groppa et al., 
2012). An optimal intensity for diagnostic TMS is an intensity that marks the transition from 
the rising slope to the flat portion (plateau) of the sigmoid stimulus–response curve: 140% 
of RMT, corresponding to approximately 170% of AMT (Groppa et al., 2012). In addition, 
the efficacy of TMS in exciting the corticomotor output may be increased by asking the 
patient/subject to preactivate the target muscle at 10–20% of maximum strength. For each 
muscle, 5–6 consecutive MEPs should be recorded during tonic contraction and only the 
MEP with the largest amplitude should be considered. In patients with an inability to 
contract the target muscle (for instance due to severe paresis), CST excitation may be 
facilitated by voluntary activation of the homologous muscle of the other side, motor 
imagery of target muscle contraction, or tonic vibration of the target muscle, though to a 
lesser extent than voluntary contraction of the target muscle.

There is a further practical consideration here. In cognitive studies, where repetitive TMS 
around threshold intensity is used, one cannot assume a stable state of the cortex being 
stimulated for many hundreds of trials; nor can we directly measure the cognitive outputs as 
we can do with the motor cortex. This is a complex issue, but not one that can be ignored 
(see Silvanto et al., 2008)

6. Cortical Silent Period

As initially mentioned by Merton and Morton (1980), a period of electrical silence in the 
surface EMG activity occurs immediately after the MEP when TES is delivered to M1 
during a tonic muscle contraction. Using focal TMS of the motor cortex hand representation 
using suprathreshold intensities, a silent period (cortical silent period, CSP) can be evoked in 
a contralateral hand muscle, lasting up to 100–300 ms following the MEP. The duration of 
the CSP gradually increases with the intensity of TMS (Fig. 6), while the level of 
contraction plays an insignificant role (Haug et al., 1992; Inghilleri et al., 1993; Roick et al., 
1993; Rossini et al., 1995; Orth and Rothwell, 2004; Kimiskidis et al., 2005). The 
physiology of this inhibitory phenomenon is particularly complex and different spinal and 
supraspinal sources contribute to its genesis. It is now generally agreed that several spinal 
inhibitory mechanisms contribute to the CSP (Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 1976; Person and 
Kozhina, 1978), including recurrent inhibition due to activation of Renshaw cells, the 
refractoriness of spinal motor neurons after excitation, postsynaptic inhibition by activation 
of Ia inhibitory interneurons. However, because of their short duration, these spinal 
mechanisms are limited to the early party of CSP, i.e. the initial ~50 ms (5–10 ms, except 
recurrent inhibition ~35 ms; Fuhr et al., 1991; see Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke, 2012) 
while the later part of CSP is generated by inhibitory mechanisms within M1. Hence, the 
total duration of the CSP is usually altered only by cortical mechanisms. TMS applied even 
at moderate stimulation intensities produces a CSP significantly longer than the one induced 
by TES (Inghilleri et al., 1993; Brasil-Neto et al., 1995); as TMS preferentially activates 
axons of excitatory intracortical interneurons which in turn stimulate pyramidal neurons 
(Day et al., 1989; Di Lazzaro et al., 2004a) while TES directly depolarizes subcortical axons 
of pyramidal neurons (Edgley et al., 1990). This observation confirms the above finding and 
suggests a predominant role of intra-cortical inhibitory phenomena in the genesis of CSP. 
The recording from epidural electrodes by Chen et al. (1999b) demonstrated that I-waves of 
descending corticospinal volley evoked by TMS were suppressed if a second TMS pulse was 
given 100–200 ms after a conditioning first TMS pulse, i.e., during the CSP.

The inter-hemispheric difference in CSP duration is very small, typically less than 10 ms, 
and interindividual differences and the inter-session variability of the CSP duration are 
larger (Haug et al., 1992; Cicinelli et al., 1997; Orth and Rothwell, 2004), ranging from 20% 
to 35% (Orth and Rothwell, 2004).

Since the duration of the CSP mostly reflects cortical mechanisms and it can be readily 
probed with single-pulse TMS, the CSP is a useful measure of intracortical inhibition in 
human M1 and can be used to detect intracortical excitability changes in brain diseases (i.e. 
in epilepsy, see Cicinelli et al., 2000) during clinical studies.

The following two methods can be used to estimate the CSP duration, as recommended by 
Groppa et al., 2012 (based on 5/6 trials per muscle):

•

The first method calculates the mean CSP duration (or median) based on trial-by-
trial measurements of the CSP duration. In a single trial, the CSP is measured as 
the time elapsing from the onset of the MEP until the recurrence of voluntary 
tonic EMG activity.

The second method averages 5–6 MEP/CSP rectified traces. The rectified and 
averaged trace provides a good visualization of the voluntary EMG activity level 
at baseline (i.e., prior to the TMS pulse). Therefore, the end of the CSP can be 
defined more precisely by the reappearance of voluntary EMG activity relative to 
the tonic baseline EMG level.

Pharmacological studies suggested that the CSP reflects particularly long-lasting cortical 
inhibition mediated through gamma-aminobutyric type B receptors (GABABR). Stetkarova 
and Kofler (2013) demonstrated that CSP duration increased progressively after the 
administration of intrathecal baclofen (a specific GABAB receptor agonist). These findings 
contrast with previous observations: no effect after single oral (McDonnell et al., 2006) or 
intravenous (Inghilleri et al., 1996) doses of baclofen, but they concur with the significant 
CSP prolongation observed during the continuous administration of high-dose intrathecal 
baclofen in a patient with generalized dystonia (Siebner et al., 1998). These discrepancies 
can be explained by different routes of administration, dose, effective drug concentration and 
observation periods. Other studies (Werhahn et al., 1999; Pierantozzi et al., 2004) 
demonstrated that the administration of tiagabine (a GABA re-uptake inhibitor) or vigabatrin 
(an inhibitor of the GABA-degrading enzyme GABA transaminase) lengthen the CSP, 
suggesting the involvement of both GABAAR and GABABR. In relation to this, it has been 
shown that lorazepam (a GABAAR positive allosteric modulator) prolonged CSP duration if 
assessed at low stimulation intensity but shortened it if assessed using a high stimulation 
intensity (Kimiskidis et al., 2006). These data support the idea that at the lower range of 
stimulus intensities (i.e. short CSPs are elicited) CSP duration reflects the activation of 
GABAARs, while at the higher range of stimulus intensities (i.e., when long CSPs > 100 ms 
are elicited) it reflects the activation of GABABRs.

7. Central motor conduction measurements

After the introduction of TMS by Barker et al. (1985), the first clinical use of this new 
technique was to estimate the CMCT in humans by recording MEPs to stimulation of the 
motor cortex and spinal roots (Table 4). We here summarize the most frequently employed 
techniques.

1. Central motor conduction time (CMCT)

CMCT is a neurophysiological measure that reflects conduction between the primary motor 
cortex and spinal cord. With electrical stimulation, it includes the times for impulse 
propagation via the fast-conducting neurons in the corticospinal tract and excitation of the 
spinal motoneurons sufficient to exceed their firing threshold. With TMS, it also includes the 
times for trans-synaptic excitation of the cortical motoneurons in the M1 via cortical 
interneurons. CMCT can be estimated by subtracting the conduction time from the spinal 
roots/nerves to the muscle, referred to as peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT) from 
the latency of MEPs evoked electrically or magnetically by transcranial cortical stimulation 
(Fig. 7).

Two methods are employed to measure PMCT: motor root stimulation and the F wave 
technique (Merton et al., 1982; Rossini et al., 1985, 1986, 1987a,b). The first approach

activates motor roots (spinal nerves) at their exit foramina using electrical or magnetic 
stimulation over the spinal enlargements (Mills and Murray, 1986; Ugawa et al., 1989b; 
Matsumoto et al., 2013b). In this method, CMCT includes the time taken for at least one 
synaptic delay and the time in proximal motor root in the spinal canal, in addition to the true 
CMCT (time needed for conduction in the CST) (Cowan et al., 1984; Mills and Murray, 
1985; Hess et al., 1987; Rossini et al., 1987a; Ugawa et al., 1988a,b, 1989a, 1990). The 
second approach is the use of F-waves (Rossini et al., 1987a; Chu, 1989; Eisen and Shtybel, 
1990; Claus, 1990). The F wave latency measures antidromic conduction in motor axons to 
the spinal motoneuronal pool, the “turn-around” time at the motoneuron pool (generally 
considered to be 1 ms) and then orthodromic conduction from the motoneuron pool to the 
muscle. Accordingly, the conduction time from the motoneuron pool can be estimated by 
taking half of the result of adding the F wave latency and the M wave latency to nerve 
stimulation (cathode proximal) and subtracting 1 ms, i.e. (F + M − 1)/2 (Rossini et al., 
1987a). The peripheral conduction time measured using F waves is slightly longer (1–1.5 
ms) than the latency of the CMAP produced by “spinal stimulation”. This is because the site 
of stimulation with the latter is not at the motoneuron pool, as discussed below.

Both techniques have disadvantages:

- F waves—The major disadvantage of this method is that F waves can be measured 
routinely only for distal muscles, unless complex collision techniques are used. In addition, 
the latency of the fastest F waves provides a measure of conduction in the fastest motor 
axons, but their motoneurons are not those recruited first by corticospinal volleys 
particularly with near-threshold stimuli and a relaxed target muscle. The IO-curve for motor 
axons is normally quite steep, so that the resulting discrepancy will be small if the MEP is 
relatively large and well-synchronized. However, in presence of damage to the descending 
motor pathways or the spinal motoneurons the MEP may be small, reflecting only the 
recruitment of the lowest-threshold motoneurons. On the other hand, peripheral nerve 
damage may disperse the MEP, and this could create difficulties when trying to exclude 
central abnormalities in patients with peripheral nerve damage.

If F wave persistence is low, whether this is normal for that particular muscle (e.g., tibialis 
anterior) or due to disease, the recorded F wave sequence may not sample the fastest axons. 
This will produce a spuriously short CMCT.

- Stimulation over the spinal segment—Here the latency of the CMAP produced by 
stimulation over the spinal segment is subtracted from the latency of the MEP. Stimulation 
may be electrical or electromagnetic. Electrical stimuli are commonly delivered using the 
high-voltage stimulators developed for TES. As in conventional nerve conduction studies, 
the effective stimulus is cathodal (unlike the optimal polarity for transcranial stimulation of 
the motor cortex; Rothwell et al., 1987; Burke et al., 1990). The cathode is placed over T1 
for the upper limb and the relevant root exit zone for the lower limb, with the anode over the 
spine, some centimeters more rostrally, e.g., over C5 for the upper limb. Using TMS, the coil 
is centered over the cervical or lumbar root exit zone.

When recordings are carried out from muscles of small volume surrounded by other muscles 
the final MEP will always be somewhat “contaminated” by cross-talk: volumetric spread of 
MEPs from adjacent muscles, often innervated by different spinal roots and/or nerve trunks. 
Only with needle electrodes can one be certain that the MEP arises from a specific muscle, 
and this is particularly so when recording from atrophic muscles. On the other hand, MEPs 
can be recorded from muscles which are anatomically relatively isolated (e.g. ADM for the 
hand).

With both high-voltage surface stimulation and electromagnetic stimulation, current is 
sprayed over a large area, even when focal coils (e.g., figure-of-8) are used. Motor axons 
may then be activated at some distance from the cathode. However, the bend in axons and 
the tissue inhomogeneities alter the electrical and electromagnetic fluxes such that motor 
axons are preferentially activated at the vertebral foramina for both the upper and lower limb 
outflows (e.g. Mills and Murray, 1986; Ugawa et al., 1989b; Alfonsi et al., 2003). As 
mentioned above, this implies that the measure of CMCT derived using peripheral 
stimulation is contaminated by the inclusion of conduction across the motoneuron and its 
axon. This will be greater with lower limb muscles because of the longer conduction path 
through the cauda equina. Whatever the method of stimulation employed it is important to 
monitor the CMAP carefully because, as stimulus intensity is increased to supramaximal, 
the site of activation of some axons will shift distally, even as far as the brachial plexus with 
stimulation over the cervical spinal cord (Plassman and Gandevia, 1989). Stimulation of 
nerve roots or the plexus will activate axons projecting to muscles other than the target one, 
regardless of whether high voltage or electromagnetic stimuli are employed. Contamination 
of the EMG recording over the target muscle by activity of neighboring muscles (cross-talk) 
is inevitable, and may be hard to detect when there is peripheral nerve pathology. In addition 
the electrical and electromagnetic stimuli inevitably activate afferent axons, and reflex 
discharges could contribute to late components of a dispersed CMAP.

There is no perfect technique that will be optimal for all occasions: for measuring CMCT the 
F wave technique is more accurate, while for peripheral nerve/root pathology, spinal 
stimulation may be preferred. In diagnostic studies, routine usage of the TST as described by 
Magistris et al. (1999) is more complicated (and uncomfortable), but its use may be 
necessary to clarify the findings in individual patients as well as in specific conditions in 
research studies.

For CMCT measurements TMS is usually delivered during voluntary contraction of the 
target muscle, thereby providing the shortest MEP latency. In this situation, the spinal 
motoneuronal pools will be close to firing threshold and a discharge could be generated by 
the earliest descending volley. In some disorders, however (i.e. in multiple sclerosis), a 
prolonged CMCT may be due to impaired temporal and spatial summation of descending 
volleys at the spinal motoneurons. For CMCT measurement, after superimposing the 
responses, the reproducible onset latency should be measured. If conduction block in 
proximal peripheral nerves is suspected, supramaximal electrical or magnetic root 
stimulation should be tried to identify the conduction block (Mills and Murray, 1986; 
Matsumoto et al., 2009a, 2010e, 2013b,c,d).

CMCT and MEP latency mature in parallel with the development of the central nervous 
system, specifically with maturation of the corticospinal tracts, and in neonates they are 
markedly longer in latency than in adults, particularly given size (Duron and Khater-Boidin, 
1988; see Fig. 8). While CMCT reaches adult values around 3 years of age, the threshold of 
transcranial stimulation is too high for reliable responses until about 10 years of age (Koh 
and Eyre, 1988; Müller et al., 1991; Caramia et al., 1993; Fietzek et al., 2000). In adults, 
CMCT has no correlation or only a weak correlation with age (Ugawa et al., 1989a; Claus, 
1990; Eisen and Shtybel, 1990; Mano et al., 1992; Rossini et al., 1992; Mills and Nithi, 
1997; Matsumoto et al., 2012). CMCT for upper limbs has no correlation or only a weak 
correlation with body height, whereas CMCT for lower limbs is strongly correlated with 
height (Rossini et al., 1987b; Chu, 1989; Ugawa et al., 1989a; Claus, 1990; Ghezzi et al., 
1991; Ravnborg et al., 1991; Toleikis et al., 1991; Furby et al., 1992; Wochnik-Dyjas et al., 
1997; Matsumoto et al., 2010a). Most studies show no gender differences in CMCT once 
data are corrected for height (Ugawa et al., 1989a; Claus, 1990; Toleikis et al., 1991; Furby 
et al., 1992; Mills and Nithi, 1997; Tobimatsu et al., 1998). Most studies have reported no 
significant side differences in CMCT in the healthy subjects (Ugawa et al., 1989a; Eisen and 
Shtybel, 1990; Mills and Nithi, 1997); the side-to-side difference in CMCT is therefore a 
clinically useful measure.

2. Cortico-brainstem and brainstem-spinal root conduction times (C-BST and BST-R CTs)

Stimulation at the brainstem or foramen magnum levels (Ugawa, 1999a; Terao and Ugawa, 
2002) (Fig. 9) can be achieved by electrical (Ugawa et al., 1991b, 1995a) or magnetic 
stimulation (Ugawa et al., 1994). For TMS the center of a double cone coil is placed over the 
inion or the midpoint between the inion and the ipsilateral mastoid process to induce upward 
current in the brain (Ugawa et al., 1994; Shirota et al., 2011) where it likely activates the 
CST at the pyramidal decussation due to high induced current concentration at the foramen 
magnum (Ugawa et al., 1992, 1996). It produces a single descending volley (Ugawa et al., 
1994), in contrast to the multiple descending volleys with cortical stimulation. Brainstem 
stimulation can be employed to calculate the cortical–brainstem conduction time (C–BST 
CT) and the brainstem–spinal root conduction time (BST–R CT) (Ugawa et al., 1992, 1996). 
Such measurements enable localization of a CST lesion above or below the pyramidal 
decussation. Brainstem stimulation may also be used in research to investigate changes in 
spinal excitability (Ugawa, 2002). Possible drawbacks of this method are that slowly 
conducting descending tracts may be activated in patients with severe damage to the CST 
(Ugawa and Kanazawa, 1999b) and the inability to elicit a MEP in patients with severe CST 
involvement. In such cases, paired-pulse magnetic brainstem stimulation may be able to 
elicit MEPs by producing artificial temporal summation of EPSPs at the spinal motoneurons 
(Matsumoto and Ugawa, 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2010b).

3. Cortico-conus and cauda equina conduction times (CCCT and CECT)

A newly developed TMS method is able to activate the conus medullaris in the spinal canal 
(Matsumoto et al., 2009a, 2013b) (Fig. 9). This method is not currently recommended for 
routine clinical activity. Conus activation can be achieved by electrical (Ugawa et al., 
1988a,b, 1989a, 1990, 1995a; Claus, 1990) or magnetic stimulation (Maccabee et al., 1996; 
Maegaki et al., 1997; Matsumoto et al., 2009b, 2010a,c,d). For magnetic conus stimulation,

a 20-cm diameter coil designated as a Magnetic Augmented Translumbosacral Stimulation 
(MATS) coil has been developed, with which the induced currents are strong enough to elicit 
MEPs in leg muscles reliably (Matsumoto et al., 2009a, 2009b). With conus stimulation both 
electrical and magnetic pulses are likely to activate axons at the root exit zone from the 
conus medullaris, i.e. the most proximal cauda equina, where the electrical conductivity 
changes abruptly (Ugawa et al., 1995a; Maccabee et al., 1996; Laakso et al., 2014b). These 
activation sites with the MATS coil have recently been confirmed by the induced current 
estimation using a spinal cord and canal model (Laakso et al., 2014b). The latency 
difference between MEPs to cortical stimulation and conus stimulation (cortico-conus motor 
conduction time (CCCT)) estimates the conduction time within the CST not including any 
peripherally generated components. In patients with severe peripheral neuropathy, therefore, 
CCCT was found to be not prolonged while CMCT was, because of peripheral conduction 
delays within the cauda equina (Matsumoto et al., 2010d). This method also enables 
calculation of cauda equina conduction time (CECT) which reflects conduction within the 
cauda equina (Matsumoto et al., 2010a, 2013a). However, supramaximal stimulation of the 
conus is usually impossible, limiting the ability to detect conduction block in the cauda 
equina.

8. Cortical mapping of motor representations

TMS can be used to map brain function and explore the excitability of different cortical 
regions (Rossini et al., 1994; Hallett, 2007; Wagner et al., 2007; Dayan et al., 2013). The 
only widespread experience in brain mapping with TMS has been of the motor cortex. In 
theory, any TMS effect can be mapped to its cortical location, but the most commonly 
employed is the motor homunculus because the MEP constitutes a reliable output measure. 
For motor mapping, the territory where MEPs can be produced is identified. Stimulation 
intensity is generally fixed at a percentage of the MSO above resting MT. Stimuli are applied 
at various scalp sites using a figure-of-eight coil and a coordinate spatial system referenced 
to the vertex (Thickbroom et al., 1999), and the amplitude of MEPs evoked in contralateral 
muscles is measured. Then, a map of sites on the scalp from which responses can be 
obtained in each muscle of interest is defined. The target muscle representation has a 
maximum value (optimal site), a center of gravity (CoG) (elements of the representation can 
be used to form a weighted average of their location, in which the weights are given by the 
normalized value of the element), and a surface area. The CoG provides a spatial average 
optimal site rather than the one site of largest MEP response, which is the “hot spot”. This 
approach can allow the distinction of the representations for two or more hand muscles 
(Figs. 10 and 11). Maps of the M1 representation for APB and ADM muscles were produced 
by fitting a continuously defined 3D function to findings gathered from stimulation at 
specific scalp sites and projecting such function onto a 2D surface via a radial projection 
(Wilson et al., 1993). The maps of APB and ADM overlap, but with a statistically significant 
separation, the APB map being more lateral than the ADM map. Changing the coil direction 
may also help refine maps. Maps for ADM, APB and FDI muscles have been studied by 
systematically rotating the coil to determine the direction of induced current for each scalp 
site of the map expressing the optimal ones as an angle relative to individual central sulcus 
directionality (Bashir et al., 2013). There is considerable evidence that CoG-based TMS

mapping is spatially accurate, especially when using a navigation system (see next section), 
and has been recently validated by direct electrical stimulation of cortex in patients with 
brain tumors (Opitz et al., 2014).

Another mapping variable is the map volume, i.e., the sum of the average MEP amplitude at 
each location stimulated, normalized to the average MEP at the location of the largest 
response. This measure provides information on the overall excitability of the cortical 
representation but does not inform about the topography of the representation of a given 
muscle. The area of the MEP map increases with the intensity of TMS (Najib et al., 2011), 
and changes in spinal cord excitability may influence the magnitude of motor maps.

The vast majority of reports agree that upper limb/hand muscle maps are quite symmetrical 
in terms of spatial coordinates on the two hemispheres (Wassermann et al., 1992; Wilson et 
al., 1993; Cicinelli et al., 1997). This means that intra-individual interhemi-spheric mapping 
differences are normally small or absent, regardless of the inter-individual differences in the 
absolute values of such coordinates. Therefore, in case of a lesion or excitability changes 
affecting the motor cortical system of one hemisphere, the spatial characteristics of the maps 
from the hemisphere not involved in the lesion/experiment could be used as a reference for a 
given subject (Traversa et al., 1997, 1998), although plastic changes can impact on the 
unaffected hemisphere via transcallosal influences. Thus, the right/left or affected/unaffected 
hemispheres can be reliably compared on follow-up studies, if the mapping procedure is 
rigorously performed (e.g., with the use of a navigation system) and the method is kept 
constant (Traversa et al., 1997; Cicinelli et al., 2000).

In some circumstances, both physiological and pathological, it is possible to identify 
topographic differences in the localization of the CoG of a muscle representation with 
respect to normal and/or the unaffected hemisphere (Liepert et al., 1999). For example, a 
shift of the CoG of a hand muscle representation towards the face representation may 
indicate plastic reorganization (either “functional” or “aberrant”) in the motor cortex. The 
representations of different body parts, such as arm and leg, are generally separate, but there 
is overlap for muscle representations in the same body part, much as has been documented 
in experimental models and in fMRI mapping (Pascual-Leone et al., 1993; Donoghue and 
Sanes, 1994; Melgari et al., 2008). Motor mapping can also demonstrate the presence of 
weak and probably polysynaptic ipsilateral corticospinal pathways to upper extremity 
muscles (Wassermann et al., 1994; Ziemann et al., 1999). Additionally, CSPs can be mapped 
(Wassermann et al., 1993).

9. Principles of neuronavigation

Introduced some years ago, navigation systems, integrating individual brain imaging data 
and dedicated to TMS practice, serve several objectives (Lefaucheur, 2010): (i) to determine 
the exact cortical location of a TMS target; (ii) to ensure the reproducibility of TMS 
targeting during repeated sessions or follow-up studies; (iii) to improve the accuracy of TMS 
motor mapping methods; (iv) to determine the functional involvement of a cortical region 
(e.g., motor ability or speech), especially in the context of presurgical mapping. However, 
various approaches have been proposed before image-guided systems became available.

A common method to identify a brain area uses its spatial relationship with functional 
criteria such as motor responses or phosphenes obtained from stimulation of the primary 
motor or visual cortices, respectively. The position of the coil over the skull is varied until 
the desired effect is obtained; so the optimal stimulation site is defined by this effect. This 
approach was used for the localization of functional responses like speech arrest (Pascual-
Leone et al., 1991), and for the detection of visual phenomena like phosphenes over the 
occipital cortex (Amassian et al., 1998). However, it is important to monitor and to correct 
the coil position to avoid the risk of not reaching the target area of the subject when non-
motor brain areas represent the TMS ‘target’, or during long stimulation sessions such as for 
the therapeutic applications of repetitive TMS, or during mapping procedures, or when the 
same target brain area is to be accessed in follow-up sessions. Accurate localization of 
specific brain areas to stimulate requires a precise online matching system between the 
orientation of the coil on the scalp and the site of stimulation. To solve this problem several 
TMS research groups have determined the stimulation site using other strategies such as a 
standardized function-guided procedure (see Pascual-Leone et al., 1996, for locating the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or the international EEG 10–20 system [American Soc. EEG, 
1991] (Rossini et al., 1987a, 1987b; Seyal et al., 1992; Walsh et al., 1998). Given the 
assumption that there is a consistent correlation between scalp locations and underlying 
brain structures, the coil is placed above a certain 10–20 position to depolarize neurons in 
the underlying cortex. The accuracy of these methods in finding the exact coil position 
related to certain cortical areas is, however, in the range of centimeters. Furthermore, these 
techniques do not take into account inter- and intra-individual variability of cortical 
anatomy, so it remains difficult to compare results from different subjects in studies using 
this information on coil positioning.

A more accurate solution to the problem of coil placement is offered by stereotaxic 
neuronavigation devices that enable the precise location of the magnetic coil with respect to 
the underlying brain anatomy; moreover, if MRI guided systems utilize individual MR 
images of that specific subject, individual brain structures can be taken into full account. The 
frameless stereotaxic neuronavigation system combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
data with TMS, guiding the coil to regions selected on the MR images (Krings et al., 1997; 
Ettinger et al., 1998; Boroojerdi et al., 1999; Paus, 1999; Gugino et al., 2001; Herwig et al., 
2001a, 2002). The subject’s head and the MR scan are coregistered in a common reference 
space using a set of anatomical landmarks (such as the alar wings of the nose, the tragus of 
the ear and the internal angles of both eyes), visible on both the subjects MRI and on his/her 
head. This allows a link between MR images and real anatomy and a three-dimensional (3-
D) orientation by interactive visual navigation. The 3-D position of the landmarks can be 
measured with a digitizing pen using a radiofrequency-based, mechanical or optical tracking 
system. The optical-tracking system uses a camera to measure the 3-D locations of infra-red 
LEDs attached on the coil and on the subject’s head, giving the possibility of tracking 
simultaneously the 3-D orientation and the movement of the coil and of the subject’s head.

These systems allow real-time monitoring of coil position without restraining the subject’s 
head during a TMS experiment in order to preserve the effective stimulation sites on the 
cortical surface. Stereotaxic neuronavigation can be based on the subject’s structural 
(anatomical) MRI, on the functional MRI obtained in the same subject, and on the use of

functional neuroimaging data from the literature (“probabilistic approach”; Paus et al., 1997) 
or from a brain “model” based on archives of the brains of healthy subjects (e.g., Talairach 
and Tournoux, 1988). Stereotaxy achieves greater accuracy, of the order of a few 
millimeters, compared with some centimeters for the non-navigated techniques (Sparing et 
al., 2008). Moreover, the trial-to-trial replacement variability is downgraded close to zero. 
The use of neuronavigation systems reduces the variability of the induced electric fields into 
the brain from one TMS pulse to another (Cincotta et al., 2010). Such systems are 
particularly useful to target cortical regions other than the motor cortex, such as the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Herwig et al., 2001b; Ahdab et al., 2010; Mylius et al., 2013).

10. Stimulation of nerve roots and peripheral nerve

Conduction across proximal segments of peripheral nerves, plexuses and nerve roots is 
commonly tested using H reflexes and F waves. This involves peripheral nerve stimulation, 
with transmission of nerve volleys centrally and then distally across the body segment under 
study. An alternative technique involves direct stimulation of proximal structures, and this 
may be preferable:

2.

In corticospinal lesions, when measuring CMCT, as discussed above.

In peripheral nerve pathology, when looking for abnormalities of impulse 
conduction in motor axons in proximal segments in, e.g., nerve root lesions, 
multifocal motor neuropathy and acquired inflammatory polyneuropathies/
radiculopathies. Here the responses to the peripheral stimuli may be combined 
with those to TMS.

The demonstration of conduction slowing or conduction block in proximal segments can be 
problematic with routine diagnostic testing, and a number of techniques have been 
developed to stimulate motor axons proximal to common sites of pathology. Such testing 
may be useful particularly in plexus lesions and in radiculopathies (either compressive or 
inflammatory) (e.g. Fisher, 2002; Alfonsi et al., 2003; Vucic et al., 2006; Incesu et al., 2013).

Unlike the situation with transcranial stimulation, recordings made using peripheral 
stimulation are best done at rest. Background contraction provides no advantages: the 
latency and waveform are not altered by background contraction, and the EMG of the 
contracting muscle would represent unwanted “noise” in such recordings. A comprehensive 
review of electromagnetic stimulation of motor roots has been published recently, and 
includes a comparison with other stimulation methods (Matsumoto et al., 2013b).

Stimulation may be electrical or electromagnetic. With the former, the stimuli can be 
delivered through monopolar needle electrodes inserted close to the targeted structure (e.g., 
the sciatic nerve at the gluteal fold, plexus or a nerve root; Fisher, 2002; Vucic et al., 2006), 
or using the high-voltage stimulators developed for transcranial electrical stimulation 
(Fisher, 2002; Alfonsi et al., 2003). Electromagnetic stimulation has the advantage that it 
produces minor discomfort, and this can be important with relatively deep nerves, such as 
the femoral nerve (Bachasson et al., 2014), particularly in obese patients, or patients wearing 
a cast or those in whom cooperation is likely to be limited. For electrical stimulation, a 
Teflon-coated monopolar needle electrode is a convenient cathode, but description of this

method is beyond the scope of the present document. As mentioned above, neighbors of the 
target muscle will be activated and will contribute to the CMAP, to a greater extent than with 
stimulation of the peripheral nerve more distally. Collision techniques may be necessary to 
eliminate this problem.

Thus, high-voltage or electromagnetic stimulation can be satisfactory alternatives to 
stimulation through a needle electrode for peripheral nerve abnormalities if latency is not 
critical and if the site of stimulation is not close to the site of pathology. Uncertainty about 
precisely where the stimulated axons are activated renders measures of conduction distance 
unreliable. With diffuse processes, the current required to activate axons will be elevated, 
and the site of lowest threshold may be some distance from the cathode.

12. Paired-pulse stimulation

12.1. General principles of paired-pulse TMS studies

Paired-pulse TMS allows assessment of intra-cortical inhibition and facilitation. Several 
intracortical circuits can be tested and those discussed in this article are summarized in Table 
5. It usually involves a conditioning stimulus (CS) followed by a test stimulus (TS), and the 
MEP amplitudes (usually peak-to-peak) or areas are compared to those produced by the TS 
alone as a reference (baseline/control) condition. Due to the trial-to-trial variability of MEP 
induced by TMS, at least 8–10 trials for each combination of CS/TS intensities and 
interstimulus interval (ISI) between CS and TS should be tested. The studies are usually 
done with the target muscle at rest. Contraction of the target muscle can strongly alter 
paired-pulse TMS findings. For example, contraction results in significant reduction of short 
interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) (Ridding et al., 1995b). Background EMG should be 
monitored and recorded to determine the state of muscle relaxation or level of muscle 
activity. In some paradigms, comprehensive examination involves testing a range of CS 
intensities to determine the thresholds for eliciting inhibition or facilitation. The TS intensity 
is set to allow observations of inhibition and facilitation, typically at amplitudes of 0.5–1 
mV for hand muscles or 110–120% of resting MT. Using a test stimulus that produces MEP 
at the middle value of the Input–Output curve (S50) is logically optimal and allows equal 
amounts of inhibition and facilitation (Kukke et al., 2014).

12.2. Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF)

SICI is elicited when a subthreshold CS is followed by a suprathreshold TS at an ISI of 1–6 
ms (Kujirai et al., 1993) (Fig. 12) and it is due to cortical inhibition (Nakamura et al., 1997). 
There are two phases of SICI, peaking at ISIs of ~1 ms and 2.5 ms. SICI at 1 ms may partly 
be related to neuronal refractoriness but may also involve synaptic inhibition (Fisher et al., 
2002; Hanajima et al., 2003; Roshan et al., 2003). SICI at 2.5 ms likely represents post-
synaptic inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors 
because drugs that enhance GABAAergic neurotransmission increase SICI (Ziemann et al., 
1996a; Di Lazzaro et al., 2007). SICI in reality reflects the balance between inhibition and 
facilitation. The relationship between the degree of SICI and CS intensity is a U-shaped 
curve (Chen et al., 1998; Ilic et al., 2002). At low CS intensities, increasing the CS intensity 
leads to greater SICI but further increase leads to reduction of inhibition and eventual 
facilitation, due to the recruitment of facilitatory circuits (Kujirai et al., 1993; Peurala et al., 
2008). Therefore, SICI is a complex measure and the results from SICI studies should be 
interpreted carefully taking into account the different stimulus parameters. With SICI effects 
on I3 waves using posteriorly directed induced currents in the brain (see Section 2.2.4), the 
inhibition continues 20 ms or longer, which is compatible with GABAA inhibition in 
animals without any contamination by facilitation effects (Hanajima et al., 1998). This 
procedure has not been used widely because it is more complex than the usual method. 
There is a further issue: to standardize conditions, the intensity of the subthreshold CS is 
typically set as a percentage of MT. If there is a decrease in MT because cortical excitability

is enhanced, the strength of the conditioning stimulus evoking inhibition will be less, and 
vice versa. As noted in the preceding paragraph, the relationship between CS intensity and 
SICI is not linear, and is not easily predicted. These issues need to be considered when 
comparing data from patients with control data, difference in SICI between groups being due 
to a CS of different intensity rather than a pathological change. As recommended below, a 
range of CS intensities should be used in experimental studies, even though the procedure 
then becomes lengthy.

Intracortical facilitation (ICF) can be elicited with a similar protocol as SICI but at longer 
ISIs of 6–30 ms (Kujirai et al., 1993). It reflects a true facilitation rather than a rebound after 
SICI because it has a higher threshold than SICI and a different sensitivity to change in the 
CS current direction (Ziemann et al., 1996b). Excitatory glutamatergic circuits in M1 may be 
involved (Ziemann, 2004) and it has been suggested that this form of facilitation might result 
from the recruitment of additional cortical circuits separate from those more easily activated 
by single pulse stimulation (Di Lazzaro and Rothwell, 2014). However, the physiological 
basis of ICF is still poorly understood (Di Lazzaro et al., 2006).

12.3. Short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF)

SICF can be elicited by a suprathreshold first stimulus followed by a second stimulus, also 
suprathreshold (Tokimura et al., 1996) or at RMT level (Ziemann et al., 1998). SICF occurs 
at three distinct phases with ISI at around 1.5, 2.9 and 4.5 ms (Ziemann et al., 1998; Chen 
and Garg, 2000) and is cortically mediated (Ziemann et al., 1998; Di Lazzaro et al., 1999b). 
It is likely due to the summation of different I-waves at corticospinal neurons (Ziemann and 
Rothwell, 2000; Ilic et al., 2002; Hanajima et al., 2002). The TMS intensity and ISI for 
eliciting SICF partly overlap with those for SICI. This may explain why SICI decreases at 
higher CS intensities (Peurala et al., 2008; Ni et al., 2013). A comprehensive testing protocol 
will initially evaluate the time course of SICF with a first stimulus that evokes an MEP of 
about 1 mV in a hand muscle and a second stimulus near the MT, at ISIs from 1 to 5 ms at 
steps of 0.2 ms. This identifies the optimal ISI for each SICF peak and trough for each 
individual. The SICF peaks and troughs may be tested further with a second stimulus at 
different intensities to identify the intensity required to evoke SICF. SICI should ideally be 
tested at the trough of SICF to reduce contamination by SICF. A range of CS intensities 
from about 0.5 active motor threshold (AMT) to about 1.4 AMT can be used to obtain SICI 
recruitment curve at specific ISIs. However, the testing protocol outlined above is lengthy 
and abbreviated protocols are needed in many experimental situations. For SICI, ISI 2.0 ms 
and CS intensity below AMT can generally avoid contamination with SICF. In some studies, 
the CS intensities may be adjusted to produce 50% of maximum inhibition to avoid floor or 
ceiling effects of subsequent intervention.

12.4. Long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI)

LICI refers to inhibition of a test MEP with a suprathreshold CS applied 50–200 ms prior to 
the TS (Valls-Solé et al., 1992; Wassermann et al., 1996; Sanger et al., 2001). LICI derives 
from cortical inhibition (Nakamura et al., 1997) likely mediated by GABAB receptors 
(Werhahn et al., 1999; McDonnell et al., 2006; Müller-Dahlhaus et al., 2008). For 
comprehensive testing of LICI and a subsequent late disinhibition, a range of ISIs from 50 to

300 ms should be tested. The ISIs of particular interest may be tested further with different 
CS intensities. For abbreviated LICI testing, ISI of 100 or 150 ms may be used. Following 
LICI a phenomenon of Late Cortical Disinhibition – representing a very robust period of late 
facilitation – has been described (Cash et al., 2010; Caux-Dedeystére et al., 2014).

12.5. Interhemispheric inhibition (IHI)

IHI is measured by delivering suprathreshold CS to M1 of one hemisphere followed by 
suprathreshold TS to M1 of the contralateral one. IHI is a cortical phenomenon (Di Lazzaro 
et al., 1999b) that is likely produced by interhemispheric excitatory pathways through the 
corpus callosum and synapse onto local inhibitory circuits in the target M1 (Ferbert et al., 
1992; Wahl et al., 2007; Ni et al., 2009), although there might be some subcortical 
contribution (Gerloff et al., 1998). In certain restricted conditions, a homologous 
interhemispheric facilitation followed by the inhibition can be observed (Ugawa et al., 1993; 
Bäumer et al., 2006). IHI is most pronounced at ISI of ~10 ms and ~40–50 ms which are 
referred to as short and long latency IHI (SIHI and LIHI) (Chen et al., 2003; Ni et al., 2009). 
In addition to the interactions between the homologous M1s, IHI, particularly LIHI, 
represents a widespread inhibitory system projecting from various motor related cortical 
areas, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal premotor cortex and somatosensory 
cortex, to the contralateral M1 (Ni et al., 2009). Pharmacological studies suggest that LIHI is 
mediated by post-synaptic GABAB receptors (Irlbacher et al., 2007). Interhemispheric 
facilitation from the premotor cortex to M1 has also been demonstrated (Bäumer et al., 
2006).

12.6. Paired-associative stimulation (PAS)

A further method to study cortical functional connections involves a TMS test stimulus 
preceded by conditioning electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve at different ISIs.

Mariorenzi et al. (1991) first recorded MEPs from thumb flexor muscles, whilst a 
conditioning stimulation of median or ulnar nerve randomly preceded TMS of the opposite 
motor cortex (at ISIs of 10–48 ms). Conditioned MEPs compared to control MEPs were 
significantly attenuated at ISIs between 16 and 22 ms and were significantly increased at 
ISIs between 21.7 and 24.8 ms. Such effects were limited to median-innervated muscles and 
did not occur in ulnar-innervated muscles when the conditioning stimulus was on the median 
nerve. It has been theorized that the interval between muscle stretch and the onset of the 
transcortical, long latency electromyographic responses (LLRs) is divided into an afferent 
time (AT), taken at the peak of wave N20 of somatosensory evoked potentials, an efferent 
time (ET), calculated by means of CMCT, and a cortical interval (CI) for relaying the signal 
from somatosensory to motor cortex. Considering this theory, the afferent input from 
peripheral nerve stimulation changes the excitability of corticospinal neurons of the 
contralateral sensorimotor cortex during the CI (i.e., the MEP facilitation occurred with 
nerve stimulation-TMS intervals corresponding to the sum of AT + CI).

Given these basic assumptions, it was hypothesized that lasting excitability changes may be 
induced in the motor cortex by pairing median nerve stimulation with TMS over the motor 
cortex, because the magnetic stimulation excites the pyramidal cell indirectly through the

axons of excitatory interneurons and because somatosensory inputs converge on pyramidal 
cells located in the motor cortex. This approach prompted the development of the Paired 
Associative Stimulation method (PAS), a paradigm consisting of low-frequency repetitive 
stimulation of the median nerve (typically 90–200 stimuli) combined with time locked TMS 
over the contralateral motor cortex. PAS with the interval between the two associative 
stimuli set at ~25 ms (PAS25) led to a strong facilitation of MEPs, whereas inhibition 
occurred when the interval between peripheral and cortical stimulation was reduced to about 
10–15 ms (Stefan et al., 2000; Wolters et al., 2003). This bidirectional PAS-induced 
plasticity is reminiscent of what is observed in experimental models of associative long-term 
synaptic plasticity, i.e., long-term potentiation, LTP, and long-term depression, LTD (Stefan 
et al., 2000, 2002; Wolters et al., 2003, 2005; Classen et al., 2004). In addition, PAS-induced 
excitability changes followed the rules of homeostatic plasticity (Pötter-Nerger et al., 2009). 
On motor corticospinal output, the effects of PAS are rapid (within 30 min), persistent (>30–
60 min duration), reversible and topographically specific. By investigating the effects of PAS 
on somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials, it has been shown that similar effects are 
present in the somatosensory and auditory cortices as in the motor cortex. As a general rule, 
the interval separating two consecutive pairs of conditioning-test stimuli (PAS frequency) 
can affect the pattern of motor cortical excitability changes. Usually, PAS is delivered at a 
relatively low frequency (0.01–0.25 Hz) (Stefan et al., 2000; Ziemann, 2004; Müller et al., 
2007), but some authors showed long-lasting changes in motor cortex excitability following 
PAS25 applied at 5 Hz (Quartarone et al., 2006).

Pharmacological studies have demonstrated the involvement of NMDA receptors in PAS25 
(Stefan et al., 2002; Wolters et al., 2003). PAS25 does not change the SICI (Rosenkranz and 
Rothwell, 2006; Kujirai et al., 2006; Quartarone et al., 2006), suggesting that PAS does not 
influence inhibition mediated by the GABAA receptor, whereas it increases the duration of 
the CSP recorded from a contracting muscle (Quartarone et al., 2003; Stefan et al., 2000, 
2004), suggesting an influence on GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory circuits. LTP-like 
effects of PAS25 were also not associated with enhanced intracortical glutamatergic 
transmission as revealed by lack of ICF changes (Quartarone et al., 2006). In sum, PAS25 
does not affect short-latency intracortical circuits (Ni et al., 2014), but, as demonstrated by 
Kujirai et al. (2006), those recruited at long latencies are facilitated by PAS. Because these 
elements would probably correspond to those involved in the generation of late I-waves, 
PAS-induced plasticity would be different from theta-burst induced plasticity, which is 
probably based on modulation of the first I-wave (Huang et al., 2005), discussed below.

12.7. Short latency (SAI) and long latency (LAI) afferent inhibition

Cutaneous or mixed afferent input from the hand can inhibit MEPs evoked in resting 
muscles by TMS of the motor cortex at remarkably short latencies with a reduction of 
cortical excitability which has been confirmed also by epidural spinal cord recordings 
(Tokimura et al., 2000).

SAI is elicited if median nerve stimulation precedes contralateral M1 TMS at ISIs around 
the latency of the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential, and is followed by 
a period of facilitation which is likely related to long latency transcortical responses

(Mariorenzi et al., 1991; Tokimura et al., 2000). Pharmacological studies showed that SAI 
involves cholinergic (Di Lazzaro et al., 2000) and GABAAergic (Di Lazzaro et al., 2005) 
circuits. SAI may be evoked with median nerve stimulation at the wrist or with digit 
stimulation, usually of the index or the middle finger. The intensity of sensory stimulation 
may be adjusted to produce a motor twitch, or at two to three times sensory threshold (Ni et 
al., 2011a). Maximum inhibition occurs at ISIs of about N20 latency plus 2 ms, or between 
20 and 22 ms for median nerve stimulation at the wrist and about 25 ms for digit stimulation 
(Mariorenzi et al., 1991; Bikmullina et al., 2009a; Ni et al., 2011a). LAI is elicited when 
median nerve stimulation is applied before TMS at ISI around 200 ms (Chen et al., 1999a).

12.8. Thalamo-cortical inhibition induced by cerebellar stimulation (CBI)

CBI refers to inhibition of M1 when preceded by stimulation over the contralateral 
cerebellar hemisphere, as seen in pioneering studies with cerebellar TES. It is thought to be 
mediated by activation of cerebellar Purkinje cells which inhibit M1 via a disynaptic 
pathway through relays in the deep cerebellar nuclei and in the ventro-lateral thalamus 
(Ugawa et al., 1991a, 1995b; Pinto and Chen, 2001; Groiss and Ugawa, 2012). This may be 
related to a potential of positive polarity recorded by scalp EEG in the con-tralateral central-
frontal area from cerebellar stimulation (Amassian et al., 1992). Cerebellar stimulation can 
be performed with a double cone coil (Ugawa et al., 1995b; Werhahn et al., 1996) placed 3 
cm lateral to the inion on a line joining the inion and the external auditory meatus. The 
intensity of cerebellar stimulation is set at 5% below the AMT (for stimulating the pyramidal 
tract over the cerebellum), while M1 stimulation is performed with a figure-of-eight coil 
adjusted to produce MEP of about 0.5 mV in hand muscles. CBI is maximum at ISIs of 5–8 
ms (Amassian et al., 1992; Ugawa et al., 1995b).

12.9. Interactions between cortical circuits

Interactions between different cortical circuits can be tested with triple stimulation 
paradigms. For example, LICI inhibits SICI and this interaction is likely mediated by 
presynaptic GABAB receptors (Sanger et al., 2001). Details of the method are described 
elsewhere (for a review see Ni et al., 2011b). Inputs from other cortical areas such as the 
premotor cortex, supplementary motor area and parietal cortices also modulate M1 
excitability. Whether the effects are inhibitory or facilitatory to the M1 depends on the 
stimulation site, CS intensity and ISI. Neuro-navigation techniques may improve the 
accuracy identifying the target area outside the M1. Detailed description of these techniques 
are available elsewhere (Civardi et al., 2001; Koch et al., 2007; Bäumer et al., 2009; Arai et 
al., 2012).

13. TMS–EEG evoked cortical responses

TMS has been combined with different neuroimaging techniques (Siebner et al., 2009; 
Ziemann, 2011). For example, a promising tool has been introduced that permits the co-
registration of the EEG activity – which has a temporal resolution of a few milliseconds and 
can be simultaneously sampled from a large number of scalp sites – during TMS (Fig. 13), 
thus providing the possibility to noninvasively probe the brain’s cortical excitability and 
time-resolved connectivity (Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Virtanen et al., 1999; Ilmoniemi and

Kicic, 2010). This means that combined with EEG, TMS is developing towards a brain 
research method in which stimulation is navigated into a desired brain area and the 
concurrently recorded EEG scalp potentials are processed into source images of the TMS-
evoked neuronal activation (Komssi et al., 2004). Needless to say, such an approach is quite 
promising also for clinical applications (Julkunen et al., 2013; Ragazzoni et al., 2013; 
Frantseva et al., 2014; Napolitani et al., 2014; Sarasso et al., 2014).

The first published attempt to measure TMS-evoked brain responses was made in 1989 by 
Cracco et al. (1989); in their setup, one scalp electrode was used to record EEG responses to 
TMS at the homologous cortical area contra-lateral to the stimulation site and it was possible 
to record cortico-cortically mediated activity with an onset latency of 9–12 ms (for a review 
see Komssi and Kähkönen, 2006). However, this approach at that time was substantially 
hampered by severe technical limitations related to the coupling of a strong stimulation 
artefact to the recording system, known already from studies with electrical stimuli 
(Freeman, 1971). It was necessary to overcome this difficulty. One way to suppress the 
stimulus artifact was to use a sample-and-hold circuit able to block the EEG signal for 
several milliseconds immediately adjacent to the TMS pulse, as previously suggested by 
electrical stimulation experiments (Freeman, 1971). This method, avoiding saturation of the 
recording amplifiers by the magnetic stimuli, allowed for the first time the accurate 
recording of multichannel EEG activity in response to TMS. With this type of amplifier 
TMS-evoked brain EEG responses were successfully measured in 1997 (Ilmoniemi et al., 
1997; Virtanen et al., 1999). The propagation of TMS-evoked brain activity was then traced 
between brain areas starting a few milliseconds post-stimulus. In the following years, TMS–
EEG studies have started to describe the scalp topography and investigated the possible 
generator sources of the TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) in order to extend our 
understanding of the activation mechanisms of TMS. Moreover, they have confirmed the 
potential of TMS–EEG as a tool for basic neuro-physiological research and possibly for 
diagnostic purposes (for a review see Ferreri and Rossini, 2013).

The electric currents induced in the brain by TMS can depolarize cell membranes so that 
voltage-sensitive ion channels are opened and action potentials are initiated. Subsequent 
synaptic activation is directly reflected in the EEG (Ilmoniemi et al., 1997), which records a 
linear projection of the postsynaptic current distribution on the lead fields of its 
measurement channels. EEG is not very sensitive to action potentials because of their 
symmetric current distribution and short duration, so it is believed that postsynaptic currents 
generate most of the EEG signals. If the conductivity structure of the head is taken into 
account, the EEG signals can be used to locate and quantify these synaptic current 
distributions and to make inferences on local excitability and area-to-area functional 
connectivity in the nervous system (Komssi et al., 2002, 2004, 2007; Massimini et al., 2005; 
Ferreri et al., 2011). The initial TMS-evoked response, although difficult to measure 
uncontaminated by artifact (Veniero et al., 2009), appears to result from the activation of the 
target area whereas later deflections are partially due to activity triggered by axon-
propagated signals. How the signals are transmitted strongly depends on the state of the 
simultaneous and/or in-series firing of distributed neuromodulatory neural network 
(Kähkönen et al., 2001; Massimini et al., 2005), and also on local activation at the time of 
stimulus delivery (Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010; Veniero et al., 2013).

Understanding the TMS-evoked activity that is elicited at sites distant from the TMS target 
can benefit from knowledge of the anatomical connectivity of the brain as seen by diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) studies with MRI (Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010; Niskanen et al., 2011; 
Peters et al., 2013). TEPs are generally highly reproducible, provided that the delivery and 
targeting of TMS is well controlled and stable from pulse to pulse and between experiments 
(Casarotto et al., 2010). Several components of the EEG response to single-pulse TMS in the 
motor cortex have been clearly identified (for review see Komssi and Kähkönen, 2006; 
Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010; Ferreri and Rossini, 2013). In particular, single-pulse TMS over 
M1 is able to evoke EEG activity lasting up to 300 ms composed at the vertex of a sequence 
of deflections of negative polarity peaking at approximately 7, 18, 44, 100, and 280 ms, 
alternating with positive polarity peaks at approximately 13, 30, 60 and 190 ms post-TMS 
(Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Paus et al., 2001; Komssi et al., 2002, 2004, 2007; Nikulin et al., 
2003; Kähkönen et al., 2004, 2005; Kähkönen and Wilenius, 2007; Bonato et al., 2006; 
Daskalakis et al., 2008; Farzan et al., 2009; Lioumis et al., 2009; Mäki and Ilmoniemi, 
2010a; Veniero et al., 2010; Ferreri et al., 2011, 2012; Premoli et al., 2014; Casula et al., 
2014). However, these components are not invariable, the most reproducible being N7, P30, 
N44, P60, N100 and P180 (Table 6; Fig. 13). In addition to some inter-individual 
differences, the responses depend on the exact coil location and orientation (Komssi et al., 
2002), on the state of the cortex (Nikulin et al., 2003; Ferreri et al., 2014b; Kundu et al., 
2014) and on the vigilance of the subject (Massimini et al., 2005, 2012). In addition to 
standard evoked responses, TMS may also trigger oscillatory activity or perturb ongoing 
rhythms (Paus et al., 2001; Fuggetta et al., 2005; Van Der Werf and Paus, 2006; Van Der 
Werf et al., 2006; Rosanova et al., 2009; Maki and Ilmoniemi, 2010b; Veniero et al., 2011; 
Thut et al., 2011; Vernet et al., 2013; Garcia Dominguez et al., 2014; Shafi et al., 2014), 
eliciting event-related EEG synchronization/desynchronization (Pfurtscheller and Lopes da 
Silva, 1999).

13.1. TMS–EEG in studying cortical excitability, connectivity and plasticity

The usual purpose of a topographic plot of TEPs is to detect both local and distant effects of 
TMS, i.e., to measure both local excitability of the stimulated patch of the cortex and the 
propagation of TMS-evoked activity in a broader cortical network. The overall response 
amplitudes are usually highest under the coil and diminish with increasing distance from the 
stimulation point. Locally, within one hemisphere, increased EEG activity can be seen in a 
number of neighboring electrodes, suggesting the spread of TMS-evoked activity to 
anatomically interconnected cortical areas (Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Paus et al., 2001; Ferreri 
et al., 2011). An important feature of TEP topography is that even though only one cortical 
hemisphere is stimulated, bihemispheric EEG responses are evoked with different features. 
TMS-evoked activity propagates from the stimulation site ipsilaterally via association fibers 
and contralaterally via transcallosal fibers and to subcortical structures via projection fibers 
(Ilmoniemi et al., 1997; Komssi et al., 2002, 2004; Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010; Ferreri et al., 
2011, 2012, 2014b). Therefore, EEG as a measurement of cortical activity after the TMS 
pulse makes possible to study cortico-cortical interactions by applying TMS to one area and 
observing responses in remote, but interconnected areas, or to study how the activity in one 
area affects the ongoing activity in other areas (Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010; Ferreri et al., 
2014b). Post-synaptic effects of the inhibitory interneurons are considered to be represented

as the TMS-evoked N44 and N100 components (Nikulin et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2005; 
Bonato et al., 2006; Ferreri et al., 2011, 2012; Premoli et al., 2014), as it has been seen 
shown that inhibitory processes in deeper cortical layers can produce surface-negative 
potentials preferentially (Caspers et al., 1980). An important challenge in interpreting TMS 
results comes from the fact that the effects of brain stimulation propagate from the target site 
ortho-and anti-dromically in the neuronal network (Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010) and 
similarly, the stimulated area is influenced by connected areas. Because area-to-area 
modulation is often inhibitory, corticospinal excitability (as reflected by the magnitude of 
the descending volley elicited by a given cortical stimulus) does not necessarily increase 
with the general level of cortical activity (Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010).

There is growing evidence, also from stimulation of cortical areas other than the M1, that the 
impact of TMS on the EEG response is not only determined by the properties of the stimulus 
alone, but also by the initial state of the activated brain region (Ferrarelli et al., 2008; 
Casarotto et al., 2011). This was preliminarily demonstrated by the analysis of the features 
of the EEG-based pre-stimulus spectral EEG profile to test the hypothesis that fluctuations 
in neuronal activity have a functional significance and may account for the variability in 
neuronal or behavioral responses to physically identical external stimuli, such as TMS 
(Ilmoniemi and Kicic, 2010). Besides assessment of the general state of the brain (Kähkönen 
et al., 2001; Massimini et al., 2005; for a review see Massimini et al., 2012), concurrent 
TMS and EEG have the potential to offer insights into how brain areas interact during 
sensory processing (Bikmullina et al., 2009b; Ferreri et al., 2012, 2014a), cognition 
(Bonnard et al., 2009; Miniussi and Thut, 2010) or motor control (Nikulin et al., 2003; Kičić 
et al., 2008; Ferreri et al., 2011). Several recent findings open up promising possibilities to 
use this technique to assess directly whether and where in the cortex LTP or LTD plasticity 
phenomena can be induced with several different paradigms (Esser et al., 2006; Huber et al., 
2008; Veniero et al., 2013). Detection of the natural frequencies of TEPs with TMS–EEG 
may also have diagnostic potential and clinical applications, as it opens up possibilities to 
map the natural frequency of different cortical areas in various neuropsychiatric conditions 
such as depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, dementia or disorders of consciousness (for 
review see Massimini et al., 2012; Daskalakis et al., 2012; Ferreri and Rossini, 2013; 
Kimiskidis et al., 2014). Since natural frequencies reflect relevant circuit properties, TMS-
evoked EEG may radically extend the window opened by conventional MEP recordings 
(Maki and Ilmoniemi, 2010a). Whereas TMS-MEP is limited to motor areas, TMS–EEG can 
access any cortical region (primary and associative) both in healthy and diseased subjects, 
and may offer a straightforward and flexible way to detect and follow-up the state of 
corticothalamic circuits and cortico-cortical connections.

14. Repetitive TMS

Repetitive TMS (rTMS) was introduced in 1989 using consecutive stimuli with a 
progressively shorter interstimulus interval as short as 10 ms (Rossini and Caramia, 1992). It 
needs a specific set of stimulators able to overcome the recharging time to maintain the same 
stimulus output with extremely brief interstimulus intervals (i.e. 10 or 20 ms). rTMS has a 
modulatory effect on cortical excitability, which outlasts the stimulation period and can be

used in a variety of ways both in motor and non-motor brain regions and with local and 
nonlocal effects on brain activity.

The majority of research which has studied the effects of rTMS on cortical activity has 
focused on the effects of stimulation in M1, as the cortical excitability of this brain region 
can be easily measured. There is relative consensus that stimulation frequencies below 1 Hz 
are mainly inhibitory, while repetition rates of 5 Hz and beyond are mainly facilitatory at 
least regard to corticospinal motor output. Limited evidence as to the effect of rTMS in other 
brain regions has come from neuroimaging and EEG studies. These studies have been 
conducted predominantly in clinical groups where changes induced by stimulation may not 
necessarily reflect changes seen in healthy subjects. rTMS paradigms used to induce 
changes in cortical excitability include conventional rTMS techniques involving high (>3 
Hz) and low (<1 Hz) frequency stimulation as well as newer patterned protocols such as 
theta burst stimulation (TBS) or quadripulse stimulation (QPS).

A substantial number of studies have explored the effects of conventional high and low 
frequency rTMS on cortical excitability, and there is an emerging body of research 
characterising the response to TBS.

14.1. High frequency rTMS

A large number of studies, especially in the early 2000s explored the effects of “high-
frequency” rTMS on M1 cortical excitability (Pascual-Leone et al., 1994; see review by 
Fitzgerald et al. (2006)). A typical experiment would assess cortical excitability before and 
after the repeated application of brief, high-frequency stimulation trains, often with 
assessment of excitability during stimulation trials as well. These studies employed 
intensities of stimulation ranging from well below the resting MT to substantially above it 
(~150% of the resting MT). They also employed a diverse range of stimulus frequencies 
from 2 to 20 Hz or higher. Overall, this literature suggests that most high-frequency 
stimulation protocols produce an increase in cortical excitability, as measured by the size of 
induced MEPs within the rTMS stimulation train (Fitzgerald et al., 2006). The majority of 
studies also report increases in cortical excitability outlasting repeated stimulation trains 
although a number of studies (for example Peinemann et al., 2004), which used lower 
stimulus intensities, have reported no persistent post-TMS changes in cortical excitability.

There are also conflicting reports as to the effects of high-frequency rTMS on parameters of 
cortical inhibition (Fitzgerald et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2008). When cortical inhibition has 
been assessed with paired pulse TMS methods, the majority of studies have reported a 
decrease in SICI after high-frequency rTMS trains in healthy subjects (for example, 
Peinemann et al., 2000). However, the reverse (SICI increase) can be observed in 
pathological conditions, especially in patients with reduced SICI at baseline (Lefaucheur et 
al., 2006a). The CSP duration appears to be relatively increased during the stimulation train, 
but there is less consistency in reports on the after-effects of rTMS on CSP (Fitzgerald et al., 
2006). A recent study found that greater effects on CSP duration were produced with a 
greater number of applied stimuli at high frequencies (i.e. 20 Hz) (de Jesus et al., 2014). 
Recently comments on non-linear effects or rTMS could potentially avoid the frequent 
assumption the more (intensity and number of stimuli) the better (Gamboa et al., 2010).

14.2. Low-frequency rTMS

In the majority of studies, low-frequency stimulation has been applied at 1 Hz, although a 
smaller number of studies have utilized frequencies between 0.1 and 0.9 Hz (Chen et al., 
1997; Fitzgerald et al., 2006). Low frequency rTMS is often employed as a single, low-
frequency stimulation train lasting 10–20 min. There have been some reports in which 
repeated briefer low-frequency stimulation trains were applied. Few effects of this form of 
low frequency stimulation have been reported within the stimulation trains but there is a 
moderately consistent effect of low-frequency stimulation on post-train cortical excitability, 
typically characterised by a reduction in MEP size (Fitzgerald et al., 2006). More reliable 
effects on cortical excitability are induced with higher intensities of stimulation and where 
stimulation trains are repeated on more than one occasion.

The effects of low frequency rTMS on cortical inhibition are not consistent (Fitzgerald et al., 
2006). A number of studies have reported no changes in SICI with 1 Hz stimulation (for 
example Gilio et al., 2003). A large number of studies have examined the effect of 1 Hz 
stimulation on the CSP with highly contradictory effects reported across studies (Fitzgerald 
et al., 2006). Recently, de Jesus et al. (2014) reported no effect of low frequency stimulation 
on intracortical excitability, including inhibition, in the motor cortex.

14.3. Patterned stimulation

The most well established patterned form of TMS is the application of theta burst 
stimulation (TBS) (Huang et al., 2005). Other approaches, including the use of quadripulse 
stimuli or the inhibitory effect of continuous theta burst (Rothkegel et al., 2010), have been 
less evaluated even if quite promising and, for certain aspects, more stable and reliable. 
These also include the application of repetitive pairs of TMS pulses and the combination of 
high and low frequency stimulation in a ‘priming stimulation’ paradigm (Hamada et al., 
2013).

TBS involves TMS. TBS consists of TMS pulses delivered as a 3-pulse 50-Hz burst applied 
at 5 Hz (i.e., 50 Hz burst of 3 pulses delivered every 200 ms). Intermittent TMS (iTBS) 
involves 600 pulses delivered as 2-s trains of TBS repeated every 10 s (i.e. 2 s of TBS 
followed by an 8 s rest) for about 3 min. iTBS was initially considered as one of the most 
effective and reliable methods of producing LTP-like plasticity in the cortex (Huang et al., 
2005), By contrast, continuous application of TBS trains for 40 s (cTBS) resulted in a LTD-
like decrease in motor cortex excitability, as revealed by prolonged reduction of MEP size 
(Huang et al., 2005). Studies of both types of patterned stimuli have suggest that they 
produce lasting effects on cortical excitability that exceed those seen with standard rTMS 
protocols (Iezzi et al., 2011). Most studies which have explored the effect of iTBS have 
found that it produces an increase in cortical excitability that persists in some cases 
considerably longer than the effects seen with high frequency rTMS (Di Lazzaro et al., 
2011). In contrast, cTBS has been shown to produce long-lasting reductions in cortical 
excitability, although these are seen with less consistency than the effects of iTBS. Few 
studies have explored the effect of TBS on cortical inhibition, and these have showed 
heterogeneous results (Suppa et al., 2008; McAllister et al., 2009; Doeltgen and Ridding, 
2011). Recently, there has also been an increasing interest in exploring alternative

stimulation parameters for the application of TBS, with stimulation bursts of 3 pulses 
applied at intervals of 33.3 ms (30 Hz), repeating every 200 ms (5 Hz) or every 167 ms (6 
Hz) (Goldsworthy et al., 2012a; Wu et al., 2012). In addition, as TBS sessions are short, 
there is increasing interest in exploring whether providing multiple sessions with some time 
spacing between them can produce greater effects on cortical excitability than single 
sessions alone. The application of repeated cTBS sessions at 10 min intervals appears to 
produce greater reductions in cortical excitability than single sessions (Goldsworthy et al., 
2012b). However, this effect was not seen with iTBS or TBS at a number of time intervals in 
a second study (Gamboa et al., 2010, 2011). It is also important to note that there are a 
number of significant variables that modulate the effects of TBS (and other forms of rTMS) 
on cortical excitability. For example, the effect of 1 Hz stimulation appears to be modulated 
by time of day and cortisol secretion (Clow et al., 2014). The effect of this type of 
stimulation is also dependent on the type of TMS coil, the cortical induced current direction 
and the stimulation intensity utilized (Lang et al., 2006; Talelli et al., 2007). In addition, the 
induction of changes in cortical excitability appears to be substantially influenced by the 
induction of intrinsic cortical activity prior to or during the period of stimulation (Gentner et 
al., 2008). Finally, limited research has explored the reliability of induction of cortical 
excitability changes with TBS at different points in time: this appears to be better with iTBS 
(Hinder et al., 2014) than cTBS (Vernet et al., 2014). It is also worth noting that there may 
well be a variable response to TBS and other forms of non-invasive brain stimulation such 
that the expected change in cortical excitability will only be reproduced in a subset of 
subjects (Lopez-Alonso et al., 2014). Indeed, there is considerable intersubject variability in 
response to cTBS and iTBS (Hamada et al., 2013). Moreover, one must emphasize that, as 
for any other rTMS method, the resulting effect of a TBS protocol on cortical excitability 
and neural function of different areas is difficult to generalize from results obtained to the 
stimulation of the motor cortex in healthy subjects: TBS effects other than the “classical” 
iTBS/cTBS antagonism may be observed on non-motor function in patients by stimulating 
motor or extra-motor cortical regions (Grossheinrich et al., 2009; Borckardt et al., 2011; 
Lefaucheur et al., 2012). However, the promising effect of such short-duration stimulation 
protocols on synaptic plasticity should be really toned down at present, since it was recently 
demonstrated that TBS effects were highly variable between individuals, depending on 
differences in the interneuronal cortical networks that are preferentially recruited by the 
TMS pulse (Hamada et al., 2013).

Quadripulse stimulation (QPS) is another promising approach of patterned rTMS, which is 
thought to induce stable and reliable long-term effects (Hamada et al., 2008, 2009; Nakatani-
Enomoto et al., 2012). QPS facilitates MEPs for interstimuli intervals (ISIs) of 1.5–10 ms 
and suppresses MEPs for ISIs of 30–100 ms. Its bidirectional effects on cortical excitability 
were confirmed by a neuroimaging study (Watanabe et al., 2014). The use of monophasic 
TMS pulses and the relatively long duration of the session (30 min) may explain its more 
stable effect. QPS should be a promising stimulation method for long lasting effect induction 
even though a few investigators have used it; more replication studies are needed.

14.4. General comments and practical considerations

Repetitive TMS is usually not a routine clinical tool; the interested Reader is referred for 
technical details to recent review publications (Rossi et al., 2009; Lefaucheur et al., 2014). 
Safety recommendations should be adhered to for the use of various forms of rTMS and 
patterned TMS (Rossi et al., 2009).

15. TMS in cognitive neuroscience

TMS has gained a stable and unique place among the non-invasive exploratory functional 
techniques for in vivo human brain investigation outside the classical motor cortex target. 
TMS can infer causality of a given cognitive/behavioral phenomenon, but this requires a 
number of “control” conditions including site (i.e., beside the “sham” stimulation of the 
target brain region, also the real stimulation of a non-target brain area), time and context 
specific effect on performance.

15.1. The “online interference” approach

The “online” concept is here developed in a wide sense, which includes both facilitation and 
depression of a given task performance. The unique feature of TMS in the field of cognitive 
neuroscience depends mainly on its ability to interact transiently with the stimulated brain 
area, modifying its activity and therefore interrogating its function. Its functional impact is 
due to the ability to impinge on neuronal function transiently (Miniussi et al., 2013), 
modifying information processing dependent on the activity of the involved neurons 
(Silvanto et al., 2008; Siebner et al., 2009). Interference with TMS is therefore 
complementary to more traditional neuroimaging studies based on hemodynamic (fMRI) or 
metabolic (PET) approaches to cognitive challenges, irrespective of the neocortical region 
that is being targeted. TMS has been considered an advantageous alternative to classical 
lesion studies in patients not only because it can be applied in healthy controls but also for a 
number of additional reasons, given that the use of TMS follows the rule of inference. If 
cortical area A is involved in cognitive process B and is not involved in process C, the 
alteration of the activity of area A will result in altered performance in B and not C. Thus, 
for deductive reasoning, area A plays a causal role in the performance of B. Additionally, 
discrete lesions are either chronic processes, or have chronic consequences after acute 
presentation. The resulting behavioral effects thus reflect the specific information provided 
both by the lesion itself and by the plastic adaptive changes of the surviving brain areas. 
Moreover, TMS can be safely repeated in subjects on different occasions, eventually 
allowing an intra-lab or between-lab retest of a given experimental hypothesis. Finally, in 
some specific fields, as memory tasks requiring a two-stage cognitive process (i.e., encoding 
and later retrieval of items), TMS allows teasing apart the effects on one of these two tasks 
more easily than in the case of lesion studies (e.g. Rossi et al., 2001, 2004). Because 
information processing of higher brain functions is distributed along several parallel 
distributed networks involving “nodes” in many cortical areas, a single pulse is often 
inadequate to interact with the brain activity at a behaviorally relevant level. However, the 
first example of TMS outside the motor cortex used single pulses to transiently suppress 
visual perception by stimulating the occipital cortex about 80–100 ms after the presentation 
of the visual stimulus (Amassian et al., 1989). Single pulses can also produce a transient

“neglect” of a sensory stimulus (Oliveri et al., 1999, 2000). In this context TMS may be used 
as a tool to investigate and understand the role and timing of the involvement of a target area 
in a specific performance (Walsh and Cowey, 2000), the contribution of different sites to 
different aspects of a cognitive function (Robertson et al., 2003), the relative timing of the 
contribution of two or more areas to task performance and the function of intracortical and 
transcallosal connectivity (Jahanshahi and Rothwell, 2000). In short, TMS can be used to 
investigate what information is processed in a given brain structure, and when this 
processing occurs. Therefore TMS is a technique that can be used to investigate brain–
behavior relationships. In general, the possibility of understanding the location, timing (i.e. 
cognitive chronometry) (Walsh and Pascual-Leone, 2003) and functional relevance of the 
neuronal activity underlying cortical functions makes TMS an essential technique mainly in 
perception and cognitive research. Nevertheless several clinical applications are also 
possible.

15.2. Cognitive mapping

Similarly to the motor cortex non-motor areas can also be mapped; for example, one can 
produce phosphenes in different regions of the visual field with an accuracy of 1–2 degrees 
of visual angle by stimulating appropriate parts of the occipital cortex (Kammer, 1999; 
Merabet et al., 2003).

For clinical application, navigated TMS (navigated brain stimulation, NBS) (Ruohonen and 
Kahru, 2010) may allow an interference-based interrogation of a specific function. In this 
context it has been shown that presurgical mapping of the motor homunculus is sometimes 
used for localization when there are tumors that can distort brain architecture. There are 
some data to indicate that such mapping can improve outcome (Krieg et al., 2014). NBS 
mapping has been used and approved by the FDA, and in this context it has been shown that 
NBS can be used for mapping speech-sensitive cortical areas as a valuable tool for in 
preoperative assessment (Picht et al., 2013). These methods are not standardized, and 
various language tasks can be used as well as various patterns of TMS stimulation (Tarapore 
et al., 2013; Rogić et al., 2014; Rösler et al., 2014). However, attention should be paid not to 
misinterpret the data. For example, true speech arrest of cortical origin should be different 
from the spreading of the induced electric field to the facial nerve, which may induce 
transient dysarthria (Stewart et al., 2001a).

15.3. Stimulation characteristics (frequency, intensity)

In the online application, the faster the rTMS frequency, the greater the disruption of the 
activity of the targeted brain region, and the greater the final behavioral effects will be (that 
is, unless single pulse TMS is applied at the optimal time, e.g., Amassian et al., 1989). 
However, with rTMS the potential risks will be greater and more prominent nonspecific 
behavior and attention effects will be observed, which can make the results more difficult to 
interpret (Rossi et al., 2009). Moreover, the effects induced by online stimulation are 
generally short-lived, lasting approximately a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds. In 
this area, traditional methods of determining stimulation threshold have usually been used 
(Rossini et al., 1994). Nevertheless, in this field considering that often a non-motor area is 
under study, stimulation intensity is usually established as the lowest stimulation intensity

that can successfully affect behavior when TMS is delivered over the area of interest, based 
on the literature and/or the researcher’s previous experience (Stewart et al., 2001b; Sandrini 
et al., 2011).

15.4. TMS as a therapeutic tool

In contrast to online and short-lived rTMS effects, rTMS may be applied for several minutes 
with the aim of enhancing or inhibiting cortical reactivity and to modulate the hypo- or 
hyperfunction of a given brain network. This approach is called offline stimulation. TMS has 
been suggested to facilitate recovery from several cognitive deficits in post-stroke aphasia, 
neglect, Alzheimer and psychiatric patients (Miniussi et al., 2008; Miniussi and Rossini, 
2011; Barr et al., 2013). All these applications need further confirmation to establish the 
exact boundaries of their practical utility in larger cohorts of patients and following the rules 
of Evidence Based Medicine in double-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over trials. The 
principle underlying behind these applications is that inducing changes in cortical 
excitability leads to a recovery or reorganisation of the functional network – including 
balancing the hemispheres when bihemispheric mutual control is normally present. 
Nevertheless, so far, further investigations are needed to determine efficacy, and whether 
TMS can be used to ameliorate deficits in the cognitive domain with long-lasting, clinically 
exploitable, effects. Moreover, an important aspect is that in some cases TMS cannot be 
considered the treatment by itself, but as an adjunct to other rehabilitative interventions to 
reduce the treatment time and potentiate the final effects.

16. Therapeutic applications of rTMS

In the next sections, several paradigmatic examples of clinical applications with rTMS for 
disease treatment are outlined. These are ones for which a recent evidence-based review 
(Lefaucheur et al., 2014) demonstrated level “A” efficacy.

17. rTMS in depression

Current State of rTMS Clinical Practice for Depression

To summarize the acute antidepressant effectiveness data, over 89 individual trials have been 
conducted, and 4 different large multisite trials have all found statistically and clinically 
significant effects of daily prefrontal rTMS for 3–6 weeks compared to sham in patients 
affected by major depression who did not respond to at least two antidepressant drugs. 12 
meta-analyses confirm these trials. In some studies, however, non significant effects were 
reported. Two different devices currently have US Food and Drug (FDA) clearance for 
treating depression, with several others in some form of FDA pre-review.

Who should deliver TMS in Depression?

Because it is a medical therapeutic treatment with a risk of seizure, rTMS should only be 
performed in a medical setting under the guidance and supervision of a licensed physician 
(Rossi et al., 2009); meanwhile, national regulations are determining these legal boundaries. 
When it is being used to treat acute depression it is suggested that the medical team should

include a psychiatrist (Schlaepfer et al., 2010; Carpenter et al., 2012), and that the 
psychiatrists who use TMS should receive training in brain stimulation methods.

Unresolved Issues

Although the literature suggests that daily prefrontal rTMS has an antidepressant effect 
greater than sham TMS (placebo), and that the magnitude of this effect is at least as large as 
antidepressant drug treatments, many issues remain unresolved. For example, it is unclear 
how best to deliver rTMS to treat depression. Most, but not all (Klein et al., 1999), studies 
have used focal coils positioned over the left prefrontal cortex. It is still not known whether 
rTMS over one hemisphere is better than another, or whether there are better methods for 
placing the coil. For the most part, the coil has been positioned using a rule-based algorithm 
to find the prefrontal cortex, which was adopted in the early studies (George et al., 1995). 
However, this method was shown to be imprecise in the particular prefrontal regions 
stimulated directly underneath the coil, depending largely on the subject’s head size (Herwig 
et al., 2001b). Many studies now employ a positioning system based on EEG coordinates, or 
placing the treatment coil at least 6 cm anterior to the thumb motor area, rather than the 
“standard” 5 cm (Johnson et al., 2013). It may be that 7 cm is even better (Beam et al., 
2009). Two retrospective analyses of clinical trials where brain imaging was performed to 
document the coil location have independently confirmed that a coil position that is anterior 
and lateral is associated with a better clinical response (Herbsman et al., 2009; Johnson et 
al., 2013). Another group has performed a randomized controlled trial examining different 
prefrontal locations and a more anterior and lateral location did indeed produce a superior 
antidepressant response (Fitzgerald et al., 2009). These findings suggest that the location of 
the coil matters, even within broad boundaries of a specific lobe. It is not clear whether 
individualized location via neuronavigated methods will be needed for optimizing response, 
or whether general algorithms will suffice for a probabilistic positioning for most patients. 
Stimulation intensity and duration of series are other unresolved parameters in rTMS for 
depression. There is now increasing recognition that higher intensities of stimulation are 
needed to reach the prefrontal cortex, especially in elderly patients, where atrophy of the 
prefrontal cortex may outpace that of the motor cortex. Stimulation intensity is often based 
on MT even when a systematic study on the intensity (dose)/effect has not been carried out 
(Kozel et al., 2000; McConnell et al., 2001; Mosimann et al., 2002; Padberg et al., 2002). 
Data indicate that rTMS therapeutic effects likely develop over several weeks. Consequently, 
many of the initial trials, which lasted only 1–2 weeks, were probably too brief to generate 
maximum clinical antidepressant effects.

There is limited data on using rTMS as a maintenance treatment in depression (Nahas et al., 
2000). Pilot findings suggest that rTMS might eventually be used as a maintenance tool in 
depression, and that one treatment per week might be a good first attempt at a maintenance 
schedule. Several groups have performed maintenance rTMS, but there have been no 
controlled clinical trials, and optimal ways of using rTMS to prevent relapse remain to be 
defined (Li et al., 2004; O’Reardon et al., 2005). Another interesting concept is the use of 
maintenance TMS following acute series or maintenance Electro Convulsive Therapy (ECT) 
in patients who require maintenance treatment above psychopharmacology, but for whom 
adverse cognitive effects, procedural side effects, fear of or intolerance of anesthesia,

18. rTMS in neuropathic pain

A large review was recently published (see Lefaucheur et al., 2014). The present section 
only concerns chronic neuropathic or non-neuropathic pain and not the use of rTMS to 
relieve provoked acute or experimental pain, which has also been reviewed elsewhere 
(Mylius et al., 2012). Because epidural stimulation of the motor cortex through surgically-
implanted electrodes was used in the early nineties to treat drug-resistant neuropathic pain 
(Tsubokawa et al., 1991), rTMS therapy for pain relief was also targeted to the motor cortex 
(M1), or more precisely the precentral gyrus. Since the first report (Lefaucheur et al., 
2001a), about 20 original placebo-controlled studies including at least 10 patients who 
received active low frequency (LF) or high frequency (HF) rTMS of M1 have been 
published to date, covering about 700 patients. Stimulation was always applied to the motor 
(precentral) cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to pain, usually the area corresponding 
homotopically to the painful zone. First, all studies consistently reported the absence of any 
significant analgesic effect of LF rTMS of M1 delivered contralateral to the pain side 
(Lefaucheur et al., 2001a, 2006b, 2008, 2014; André-Obadia et al., 2006; Saitoh et al., 
2007). Conversely, HF rTMS delivered over the same target was found to produce 
significant pain-relieving effects (pain relief >30% in 46–62% of patients and >50% pain 
relief in 29%). These effects are optimal 2–4 days after a single rTMS session (Lefaucheur 
et al., 2001b). However, for a therapeutic application, repeated rTMS sessions are needed. 
Two studies clearly showed long-lasting pain relief following a 5-day protocol of 20 Hz 
rTMS of M1 in patients with post-stroke pain (Khedr et al., 2005), trigeminal neuropathic 
pain (Khedr et al., 2005), and phantom limb pain due to amputation (Ahmed et al., 2011). 
Finally, the largest study to date, by Hosomi et al. (2013), was based on a 10-day protocol of 
5 Hz rTMS of M1 in a multicenter series of 64 patients with chronic neuropathic pain of 
various origins. They found modest but significant pain reduction following active vs. sham 
rTMS, but they used a rather low frequency of stimulation (5 Hz) and a limited number of 
pulses (500) per session.

Although an analgesic effect of rTMS of M1 has been demonstrated, there are still many 
open questions before rTMS can be used in the treatment of chronic pain in daily clinical 
practice. The two main issues are the design of a maintenance protocol for long-term therapy 
and the method of determining the optimal target within the precentral gyrus; in fact, the 
location of the best target over the precentral gyrus with respect to the clinical presentation 
remains challenging (Lefaucheur et al., 2004b, 2006b). Only a few studies have used 
neuronavigation in this context (Hirayama et al., 2006; Lefaucheur et al., 2012), and there 
are arguments to suggest that diffusion tensor fiber tracking, in particular, could be of 
interest for this purpose (Goto et al., 2008; Ohn et al., 2012). Several rTMS target locations 
have been assessed for their ability to produce neuropathic pain relief, but M1 was found to 
be preferable to premotor or primary somatosensory cortical regions (Hirayama et al., 2006; 
Saitoh et al., 2006). However, stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
remains to be studied, according to the proven efficacy of this target in depression and the 
well-known relation between depression and chronic pain. Apart from being a therapeutic

tool for neuropathic pain, rTMS can also be used as a method to select candidates for 
neurosurgically implanted cortical stimulation. It has been shown that a response to HF 
rTMS of M1 can predict a positive outcome after implantation (Lefaucheur et al., 2004a, 
2011; André-Obadia et al., 2008, 2014; Hosomi et al., 2008). Therefore, it is good practice 
to perform rTMS tests before considering chronic cortical stimulation.

Regarding non-neuropathic pain conditions, sham-controlled results obtained in large series 
of patients and replicated by independent groups are lacking. In complex regional pain 
syndrome type 1, there are two sham-controlled studies showing a significant reduction of 
pain intensity following HF rTMS of M1, but outlasting stimulation for only a short time on 
average (Pleger et al., 2004; Picarelli et al., 2010). In fibromyalgia, two groups have reported 
prolonged effects of repeated HF rTMS sessions with a maintenance protocol, both on pain 
and quality of life, up to several months, but the target was the left M1 in one group (Mhalla 
et al., 2011) and the left DLPFC in the other group (Short et al., 2011). In migraine, HF 
rTMS of the left M1 (Misra et al., 2012, 2013) or the left DLPFC (Brighina et al., 2004) has 
also been assessed in sham-controlled studies showing a significant decrease in the 
frequency and intensity of migraine attacks. However, these promising results remain to be 
replicated by other groups (Conforto et al., 2014). It should also be noted that 
“conventional” rTMS protocols must be distinguished from devices delivering single or 
double TMS shocks over the occipital cortex during the aura of a migraine attack (Lipton et 
al., 2010). Despite rather debatable results, favorable recommendations have been recently 
issued on these devices for clinical application with FDA approval this year. Finally, one 
group showed that LF rTMS (1 Hz) delivered to the right secondary somatosensory cortex 
could provide pain relief in patients with visceral pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis 
(Fregni et al., 2005, 2011). Again, these results await replication in larger placebo-controlled 
studies.

Although rTMS represents a promising therapeutic tool in chronic pain, with proven 
efficacy, especially for M1 stimulation in neuropathic origin, further research is still needed 
to compare the respective value of various cortical targets, depending on the side and 
frequency of stimulation and the clinical presentation, with respect to the location and the 
respective sensory-discriminant and affective-emotional components of pain. A personalized 
approach should reduce the very high variability in rTMS analgesic response between 
individuals.

19. Conclusions and final remarks

This report aimed to provide the Reader with a comprehensive and updated knowledge on 
the basic mechanisms and practical applications of various forms of non-invasive, 
electromagnetic stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems and on the use of 
TMS as an adjunctive therapy of diseases resistant or only partly responding to drug 
treatments. An extended bibliography is also listed.

The same philosophy of the previous 1994 document has been implemented in the attempt to 
create a handout of value both for routine daily examinations and for building a research 
protocol. Other valuable reviews have been published in recent years on several of the topics

This review is an up-date document on basic aspects of non-invasive 
stimulation of brain, spinal cord and nerve roots.

The main physiological, theoretical and methodological features of 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are described.

Instructions for practical use of non-invasive stimulation in clinical 
applications and research are provided.

Fig. 1. 
The pyramidal tract waves (from Kernell and Chien-Ping, 1967 – with permission). The 
records of Fig. 1 are from two different baboons (A and B, respectively), and they were 
obtained with an electrode resting on the dorsolateral surface of the cervical spinal cord. 
Weak stimuli are seen to elicit only a brief single ‘wave’ which has an initial positive and a 
more prominent negative phase (D-wave). At higher stimulus strengths the D wave attains a 
greater amplitude, and it is then succeeded by a series of rapidly recurring, smaller, and 
predominantly negative-going waves (I-waves). The interval between the various waves is of 
the order of 1–2 ms. The various I waves were numbered according to their latency at strong 
cortical stimuli, and they are referred to as the I1 (arrow marked “x”), I2, I3 and 14 waves, 
respectively.

Fig. 2. 
Illustration of direction of current flows in a magnetic coil and the induced current in the 
brain (from Hallett, 2007 – with permission). In magnetic stimulation, a brief, high-current 
pulse is produced in a coil of wire, called the magnetic coil. A magnetic field is produced 
with lines of flux perpendicular to the plane of the coil, which ordinarily is placed tangential 
to the scalp. The magnetic field can be up to about 2 T and typically lasts for about 100 μs. 
An electric field is induced perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The voltage of the field 
itself may excite neurons, but the induced currents are likely to be more important. In a 
homogeneous medium, spatial change of the electric field will cause current to flow in loops 
parallel to the plane of the coil, which will be predominantly tangential in the brain. The 
loops with the strongest current will be near the circumference of the coil itself. The current 
loops become weak near the center of the coil, and there is no current at the center itself. 
Neural elements are activated by the induced electric field by two mechanisms. If the field is 
parallel to the neural element, then the field will be most effective where the intensity 
changes as a function of distance. If the field is not completely parallel, activation will occur 
at bends in the neural element.

Coil placement for MT determination of an intrinsic hand muscle (from Groppa et al., 2012 
– with permission). In this and in the following figure the current flowing in the brain has an 
opposite direction to that flowing in the coil. Optimal coil orientation refers to monophasic 
pulse or the second phase of a biphasic pulse. Current direction in the coil can differ across 
commercially available stimulators.

A representative case of a linear pattern of increase of the CSP duration (right and left 
hemisphere, recordings from left and right FDI, respectively) as a function of transcranial 
stimulation intensity which was increased by about 20% from motor threshold (from 
Cicinelli et al., 2000 – with permission). The values of the CSP duration interhemispheric 
asymmetry (ms) are shown. The bottom part of the figure shows the peripheral SP recorded 
from FDI muscles following supramaximal electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the 
wrist.

Schematic representation of the calculation of central motor conduction time (CMCT) (from 
Kobayashi and Pascual-Leone, 2003 – with permission). Motor evoked potential induced by 
TMS. (b) MEP after cervical spinal root stimulation. (c) F-waves after ulnar nerve electric 
stimulation. CMCT is estimated by onset latency of T1 minus onset latency of T2. By use of 
F-wave latency CMCT can be estimated more precisely as T1–(F + M − 1)2. T1 = onset 
latency of MEP elicited by TMS; T2 = onset latency of MEP elicited by the coil placed on 
the back of cervical spine. M = onset latency of M-wave by electrical ulnar nerve 
stimulation. F = onset latency of F-wave by electrical ulnar nerve stimulation.

Age effects on absolute latencies and ‘latency jump’ between “relaxed” and “contracted” 
motor evoked potentials (from Caramia et al., 1993 – with permission). Magnetic brain 
stimulation was carried out in children from 2 to 12 years. The latency of MEPs recorded 
during voluntary contraction increased in a linear fashion with age and body size. The 
latency of MEPs recorded when relaxed had a much slower “maturation,” and gained the 
adult value at about 10–12 years of age. The same effect is observed with TES.

Central motor conduction studies using magnetic stimulation in humans. (A) CMCT for 
upper limbs, (B) CMCT for lower limbs. For upper limbs, cortical-brainstem conduction 
time (C–BST CT) and brainstem-cervical root conduction time (BST–R CT) can be 
measured as well as CMCT. For motor cortex and motor root stimulation, a round coil is 
usually used, whereas for brainstem stimulation, a double cone coil is required. For lower 
limbs, cortical-brainstem conduction time (C-BST CT) and brainstem-lumbar root 
conduction time (BST–R CT) also can be measured. Furthermore, cortico-conus motor 
conduction time (CCCT) and cauda equina conduction time (CECT) can be measured. For 
cortical stimulation, a round coil or double cone coil is used, whereas for motor root 
stimulation, a round coil or MATS coil is used. For conus stimulation, the MATS coil is 
required.

EMG responses to TMS in relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle are inhibited by a prior, 
subthreshold, magnetic conditioning stimulus (from Kujirai et al., 1993 –with permission). 
(A) Shows examples of EMG data from a single subject. The top trace shows absence of any 
responses to the conditioning stimulus given alone. The lower two records have two 
superimposed traces, the response to the test stimulus given alone, and the response to the 
test stimulus when given 3 ms (middle traces) or 2 ms (lower traces) after a conditioning 
stimulus. The larger of the two traces (dotted line) is the response to the test stimulus alone. 
It is dramatically suppressed at these two interstimulus intervals. Note the shorter latency of 
the conditioned response at an ISI = 3 ms. Each trace is the average of 10 sweeps. (B) Shows 
the mean (+SEM) time course of suppression in 10 subjects. At each interstimulus interval, 
the size of the conditioned responses is expressed as a percentage of the size of the control 
response. In both (A) and (B), the conditioning and test stimuli were given through the same 
figure-of-eight coil oriented so that electric current in the junction region flowed from 
anterior to posterior over the lateral part of the motor cortex.

TMS–EEG co-registration (Bonato et al., 2006 – with permission). (A) Grand average of the 
electroencephalographic (EEG) responses from 100 ms pre to 300 ms post-transcranial 
magnetic stimulation (TMS) at all scalp locations recorded during real-TMS and Sham-
TMS. This figure refers to stimulation of the left primary motor cortex (MI) performed with 
the coil oriented 45° away from the midline and with the handle pointing backwards and 
laterally. The grey point indicates the site of stimulation (between F3 and C3), while the 
arrow indicates the orientation of the coil in respect to the stimulation site (45° to the sagittal 
plane). The electrode montage used for the experiment is shown at the bottom. Polarity of 
the waveforms is plotted with negative values upward in this and subsequent figures. The 
two Sham-TMS conditions (Sham 1-TMS and Sham 2-TMS) have been averaged. (B) Grand 
average of the EEG responses recorded at the vertex (Cz) during the real-TMS (thick solid
