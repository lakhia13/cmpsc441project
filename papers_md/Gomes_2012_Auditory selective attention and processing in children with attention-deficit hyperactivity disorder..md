Abstract

Objective—This study sought to better characterize the contributions of deficits in attention
allocation and distracter inhibition to the poor performance on attention tasks often seen in
children with ADHD.

Methods—Electrophysiological (Nd, P3b) and behavioral measures (speed and accuracy) were
examined during an auditory selective attention task in children with ADHD, children with typical
development (TD), and adults. Thirty children (15 ADHD; 13 females) between the ages of 7 and
13 and 16 adults (8 females) participated.

Results—Nd waveforms were elicited from adults and children with TD, but not from children
with ADHD. Further, those with ADHD exhibited significantly smaller auditory responses at
100ms (Ta). P3bs were elicited in all three groups by targets but not by unattended deviants.
Performance was significantly poorer in children with ADHD than TD and RTs were more
variable.

Conclusions—Children with ADHD evidenced poorer attention allocation, as measured by Nd
and hits, but were not more distracted by unattended deviants, as measured by P3b and false
alarms, than children with TD.

Significance—Findings for Nd, P3b, and Ta considered together suggest that deficits in auditory
selective attention in children with ADHD may be attributable to reduced information early in the
processing stream.

Introduction

Page 2

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing
neuropsychiatric disorder of early onset that is characterized by age-inappropriate
hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity (Durston, 2003). Children with ADHD tend
to do poorly in school and are at risk for school failure (Barkley, 2006). They generally have
difficulties allocating their attention efficiently and, in at least some situations, are more
vulnerable to distraction (Kenemans et al., 2005; van der Stelt et al., 2001; van Mourik et al.,
2007). In school the abilities to selectively attend to the teacher, sustain that attention
through a lesson, and inhibit processing of the distracters in the classroom, are critical for
learning and school success.

Recordings of the electrical activity of the brain provide a noninvasive means of assaying
the processes underlying selective attention. These have been well-characterized in the
literature for both adults and children, and provide objective metrics of selective attention.
The high temporal resolution of EEG recordings also allows assessment of the integrity of
the basic sensory processing that necessarily precedes selective attention. To assess selective
attention processes, the response to a given stimulus when it is in an attended channel is
compared to the response to the same stimulus when it occurs in an unattended channel.
Successful selective attention should lead to a so-called negative-difference wave (Nd), the
timing and amplitude of which are informative with regard to specific selective attention
processes (for reviews see Hillyard et al., 1995; Näätänen, 1992; Näätänen et al., 2001). Nd
onset-latency increases as the physical separation between the attended and unattended
stimuli decreases, suggesting that Nd onset reflects the time required to determine whether a
stimulus belongs to the unattended or the attended channel (i.e., whether or not it should
receive extended processing). Whilst developmental studies reveal that Nd onset decreases
into the teen years and beyond (Gomes et al., 2007), Nd responses are clearly apparent in
pediatric populations and can serve as a useful metric of the integrity of brain processes
involved in selective attention in clinical groups of children.

A handful of studies have compared Nds in children with and without ADHD (Loiselle et
al., 1980; Rothenberger et al., 2000; Satterfield et al., 1990; Zambelli et al., 1977; for a
review see Jonkman et al., 1997). Findings have been somewhat variable across studies.
Some have found smaller Nds and poorer performance in children with ADHD (Jonkman et
al., 1997; Loiselle et al., 1980; Satterfield et al., 1990; Zambelli et al., 1977). In contrast,
others have demonstrated comparable Nds and performance between groups (Rothenberger
et al., 2000; also see Satterfield et al., 1990).

We sought to resolve some of the ambiguity around electrophysiological measures of
selective attention in ADHD. Several measures were taken to ensure a strong test of auditory
selective attention. Selective attention is challenging for younger children when just one
feature separates the attended and unattended channels. Therefore two channel cues were
provided: ear and frequency, to facilitate channel separation. Targets, on the other hand,
were selected for intermediate levels of difficulty to maximize the likelihood that selective
attention to the specified channel would be necessary for successful task performance. Since
selective attention processes in those with and without ADHD may employ different
underlying neural circuitry we sampled from a relatively large number of electrodes
allowing us to fully characterize selective attention processes. Finally, we used a highly
standardized paradigm that has yielded well-characterized responses in the literature, and we
collected a large number of trials for each stimulus condition to ensure a high signal-to-noise
ratio. We hypothesized that children with ADHD would exhibit smaller Nds of later onset
and peak-latency, reflecting their difficulties with sustaining attentional focus and allocating
their attention efficiently in response to task demands (Halperin et al., 2008).

Method

Participants

To examine the extent to which target stimuli were processed in the “unattended” channel,
and thus the degree to which children with ADHD were unnecessarily processing
distractors, we also measured the P3b response to targets in the attended and unattended
channels (Ridderinkhof & van der Stelt, 2000). The P3b is a positive-going response that is
maximal at the midline parietal sites and is usually elicited by rare, unpredictable stimuli
which the participant is actively trying to discriminate (for reviews see Johnson, 1989;
Näätänen, 1992). P3b peak latency and amplitude are sensitive to a variety of task and
stimulus parameters, mainly to the extent that these influence target detection (Reinvang,
1998). Developmental studies of the P3b have found that peak latency decreases with age
but that the morphology of the component does not seem to change (Friedman, 1991;
Johnson, 1989). Some studies report that P3bs elicited by target stimuli are smaller in
children with ADHD than in children with TD (Jonkman et al., 1997; Loiselle et al., 1980;
Satterfield et al., 1990) but others report that they are equivalent (Rothenberger et al., 2000).
It has been suggested that this difference might be attributable to accuracy and reflect the
inclusion of responses to all targets, as opposed to only correct targets in most of these
studies (Jonkman et al., 1997). P3b to unattended deviants has not generally been examined,
but Satterfield et al. (1990) reported no difference between the groups in the amplitude of
the waveform in the time window of the P3b in the ERP elicited by the unattended deviants
(also see Loiselle et al., 1980). We expected P3b would be elicited by the attended targets
from participants in all three groups. Further we expected P3b to be elicited by the
unattended deviants in at least some of the children with ADHD reflecting difficulties
maintaining their attentional focus on the stimuli in the attended channel.

Participants were 16 adults (8 females), 15 typically developing children (8 females), and 15
children with ADHD (5 females). The adults ranged from 18 to 45 years of age (M = 25.0 y,
SD = 8.1 y). Self-reported ethnicity for the adults was as follows: 8 Hispanic, 1 African
American, 4 Caucasian and 3 Asian. One of the adults was left-handed.

Children were excluded from the study if they had a chronic medical or neurological illness;
a history of neurological problems; were taking systemic medication (other than stimulant
medication); had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, major affective disorder, autism,
pervasive developmental disorder, or a chronic tic disorder; or were not attending school.
Two children in the ADHD group who were taking stimulant medication were asked not to
take it on the day of the experiment. Child participants also had to achieve a Full Scale IQ
score of 80 or better on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI;
Psychological Corporation, 1999) and pass a bilateral hearing screening test (hearing
threshold of 25 dB HL or better for 500 to 4000 Hz) on the day of testing.

The children with ADHD ranged in age from 7.3 to 12.5 years of age (M = 9.7 y, SD = 1.8
y). All were referred for participation in the study by teachers, parents, or clinicians, and had
either behavioral and/or reading problems. Eight had been previously diagnosed with
ADHD and 5 with language or learning issues. Parent-reported ethnicity was as follows: 9
Hispanic, 5 African American, and 1 Asian. Seven of the children came from bilingual
households. Two were left-handed.

Children were categorized as having ADHD using parent, teacher, and examiner DSM-IV
ADHD rating scales (DuPaul et al., 1998). Children needed to evidence 6 or more symptoms
of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity in one setting and at least 4 or more in a
second setting to be considered for the ADHD group. Further, parents had to indicate that
the symptoms were present by 7 years of age. A licensed pediatric neuropsychologist

reviewed the child’s file to determine if a different diagnosis was more appropriate (based
on this review, 4 additional children were excluded).

The TD children ranged in age from 7.5 to 13.5 years of age (M = 10.2 y, SD = 1.5 y) and
were recruited from the same local community as the ADHD group. All were in the age
appropriate grade in school with no history of special education services. Age appropriate
abilities were confirmed by normal range scores on standardized tests of cognition. In
addition, TD children needed to have fewer than 4 symptoms of both inattention and
hyperactivity/impulsivity rated as present by their parent on the ADHD rating scale. Parent-
reported ethnicity for the children was as follows: 8 Hispanic, 3 African American, 2
Caucasian, and 3 Asian. Nine of the children were from bilingual households and 1 child
was left-handed.

Children were administered a battery of tests including the WASI. As shown in Table 1, the
groups did not differ in age or gender (chi squared = 1.22, p=.269). Children in the ADHD
group received significantly higher ratings from their parents for inattentive and impulsive/
hyperactive symptoms [t(28) = 5.2, p<.001; t(28) = 3.9, p<.005, respectively] as expected
given the criteria for group assignment. The TD children exhibited significantly higher
scores on the cognitive tests administered [VIQ: t(28) = 3.4, p<.005; PIQ: t(28) = 3.0, p<.01;
FSIQ: t(28) = 3.6, p<.005]. It is common for children with ADHD to perform more poorly
than their TD peers on standardized tests (Halperin et al., 2008). However, recent papers
have argued against using IQ as a covariate in studies with a clinical sample, such as ours, as
it is invalid to assume that IQ is independent of the disorder (Dennis et al., 2009).

Prior to testing, all children signed assent forms and parents and adult participants signed
consent forms. The protocol for the study was reviewed and approved by the City College of
New York Institutional Review Board and the New York City Department of Education.

Parents were paid $50 and parents of clinically referred children were provided with a
written report. Adult participants were paid $10 per hour for their participation.

Four types of stimuli were presented to each participant, two standards [1000 Hz (low
channel) and 2000 Hz (high channel) tones], an intensity target, and a duration target. Tones
were presented monaurally through insert earphones. They were delivered at 82 dB SPL and
were of 100 ms duration (including 10 ms rise and fall times), except for intensity and
duration targets. Target stimuli deviated from standards by an amount that was adjusted
individually according to detection performance of participants during a same-different
pretest in which five levels of difference from the standard were presented for each of the
target types in the ear and frequency channels to be used in the actual experiment. This was
done to control for potential individual differences in discrimination. The target duration
tones ranged between 25 and 85 ms (as compared to the 100 ms standard) and the intensity
target tones were between 67 and 79 dB (as compared to the 82 dB standard). The children
with ADHD received targets which on average showed a greater physical difference from
the standards than those received by children with TD and the adults.

The ear to which the high versus low frequency stimuli were presented was counterbalanced
across subjects, as was the ear to which a given target type (duration or intensity) was
presented. Stimulus order was pseudo-randomized with the high and low standards each
occurring 40% of the time and each of the targets occurring 10% of the time. Stimulus onset
asynchrony (SOA) varied randomly from 850 to 1150 ms with a mean SOA of 1 s to make
stimulus onsets less predictable.

Procedure

Page 5

Participants were presented with two streams (“channels”) of stimuli differentiated by ear
and frequency (1000 Hz, low and 2000 Hz, high channels). In one condition they attended to
the high frequency channel and in the other to the low frequency channel. Participants were
instructed to respond to infrequent targets within the attended channel via button press,
while ignoring tones presented to the other ear. Stimuli were presented in runs of
approximately 5 minutes, with 300 stimuli presented within a block. Altogether, a total of 4
“attend the high frequency channel” blocks and 4 “attend the low frequency channel” blocks
were presented. All participants first attended to the tones presented to the right ear.

An adult sat with each child during the experiment to monitor attention and minimize
movement. Further, if the child missed more than two targets in a row, they were gently
reminded to listen to the appropriate ear for the target. Short breaks, in which the children
remained seated, and long breaks, in which they were disconnected from the recording
apparatus and allowed to walk around, were given as needed. Total experiment time was
approximately 3 hours, including approximately 45 minutes of electrode application, 1 and
1/2 hours of testing with breaks, and 45 minutes of electrode removal and debriefing.

Electrode Placement and Recording Techniques

The EEG was recorded from 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in an elastic cap with the
amplifier bandpass set to 0.5 – 70 Hz (−6 dB points) and a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The
scalp sites recorded were frontal/central: Fp1, Fp2, Fz, F3, F4, F7, F8, FCz, FC3, FC4;
frontal/temporal/central: FT7, FT8, T3, T4, T5, T6, Cz, C3, C4; central/parietal: CPz, CP3,
CP4; temporal/parietal/occipital: Tp7, Tp8, Pz, P3, P4, Oz, O1, O2; and left (A1) and right
(A2) mastoid electrodes. The vertical electrooculogram (VEOG) was recorded from
electrodes placed above and below the left eye. The horizontal electrooculogram (HEOG)
was recorded via electrodes attached to the outer canthi of each eye. All of these sites were
referenced to an electrode placed on the tip of the nose. Impedances at the beginning of the
experiment were maintained at below 10 kΩ.

Data Analysis

Adults were included in this study as adult data using comparable experimental parameters
were not available and it was deemed important to establish that Nds would be elicited in
adults, using this paradigm. However, the primary comparisons are between the two child
groups, with a focus on the responses to the attended versus the unattended standards (for
which the signal to noise ratio was the best).

Behavioral data—RT and accuracy measures (hits and false alarms; FA) were recorded
for each participant for each type of target and signal detection measures were calculated (d-
prime and C). The window for behavioral responses was 200–1200 ms following stimulus
onset. This response window slightly overlapped the presentation of the subsequent
stimulus.

Electrophysiological data—Individual participant EEG data was sorted into 1100 ms
epochs (including a prestimulus interval of 100 ms) as a function of stimulus and attention
conditions. Each epoch was baseline corrected across the entire sweep before artifact
rejecting and averaging. Artifact reject levels were set at +/− 100 V for all electrodes to
exclude blinks and movement artifacts. The averages for each condition were rebaselined to
the average amplitude of the prestimulus portion of the epoch.

The mean number of sweeps included in the attended and unattended standard averages for
the adults were 370.6, for the children with TD were 313.1, and for the children with ADHD

movement related artifact rejection in the children with ADHD. Nonetheless, the number of
acceptable ERP trials elicited in each group is substantial and yielded clear waveforms for
most participants. Grand mean averages for each age-group and stimulus-type were obtained
for purposes of display and examination of topographic distributions. Grand mean difference
waveforms were obtained by subtracting the ERPs elicited by the standards when they were
unattended from the ERPs elicited by the same standards when they were attended.

The windows chosen for average Nd amplitude measurements were the 50 ms surrounding
the Nd peak latency (25 ms on each side of the peak) at FCz in the group grand averages.
Grand mean peak latencies for the adults and children with TD respectively were as follows:
intensity – 233 and 314 ms and duration – 233 and 310 ms. Nds were not as apparent in the
children with ADHD, although a small, possible Nd was seen in the waveforms elicited in
the intensity condition peaking at 340. This peak was used for measurement purposes in
both conditions for the children with ADHD. For each participant the Nd was rated as
present, absent or questionable by examining the raw and difference waveforms at FCz.
Onset and peak latencies of the Nd rated as present and questionable were determined by
two raters. Rare differences were discussed until agreement was reached.

Latency windows for amplitude measurements of Ta and P1 were chosen by identifying the
peak latencies in the grand mean waveforms. The peak latency for P1 was 70 ms and for Ta
was 114 ms for both child groups (TD or ADHD) regardless of deviant condition or
attention instruction. The windows chosen for average amplitude measurements were the 20
ms surrounding the peak latency (10 ms on each side of the peak).

An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests. Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were
used in reporting p values when appropriate.

To examine the efficiency of channel selection between the two child groups, the proportion
of FA to unattended deviants as a function of total FA were compared with a 2 (ADHD and
TD) by 2 (target type) ANOVA. A proportion was used to control for the more impulsive
responding seen in the children with ADHD as evidenced by their statistically higher total
FAs and more liberal response bias. No significant effects or interactions were found.

In summary, the children with ADHD missed more targets, made more FA, and exhibited
more variable RTs than children with TD. However, responses to unattended deviants were
comparable between the two groups when the proportions of FA to unattended deviants
relative to total FA were examined.

Figure 1 displays the grand mean waveforms elicited by the standard tones when they were
in the attended (gray line) and unattended channels (black line) at selected midline recording
sites (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, Pz) from children with ADHD, children with TD, and adults. ERPs
elicited in the duration and intensity conditions have been collapsed for this figure.
Developmental changes in the morphology of the waveforms are clearly evident. ERPs
elicited from the child groups are characterized by a P1 peaking at approximately 70 ms, a
N1 peaking at about 115 ms, and a P2 peaking at about 190 ms. P1s are larger in the
children than in the adults, but N1s and P2s are smaller. However, the most notable
developmental difference is the presence of an additional negative going wave followed by a
positive going wave in the children (Gomes et al, 2007).

Nd amplitude analyses—Nd is identified as the separation between the waveforms
elicited by the attended and unattended standards. It begins on the upward slope of the P2
component for the adults and somewhat later in the children (see Figure 1). As can be seen
in the difference waves in Figure 2, Nds are much smaller for the children with ADHD than
for the adults and children with TD. Consistent with the literature Nd is largest in the fronto-
central region and peaks at approximately 230 ms for the adults. The Nd is followed by a
positive going wave which peaks at approximately 410 ms in the adults and is largest over
centrally located electrodes.

Analysis of the amplitude data occurred in two stages. First, to establish that the amplitude
of the waveform elicited by the standards when they were in the attended channel was
significantly different from the amplitude of the waveform elicited by the standards when
they were in the unattended channel in the Nd latency window, three way ANOVAs with
factors of target type (intensity, duration), attention (attended, unattended), and electrode
(Fz, FCz, Cz, FC3, FC4, C3, C4) were conducted for each group. Main effects of attention
were found for the adults and children with TD but not for the children with ADHD [adult: F
(1, 15) = 32.45, p<.0005, ηp
14) = 0.00, NS]. In order to explore the consistency of these findings, the Nd amplitudes for
seven electrode sites used in these analyses were compared using post-hoc t-tests (see Table

and the children with TD in the duration condition. In the intensity condition, the effect of
attention was significant only centrally at Fz and FCz for children with TD. For the children
with ADHD there were no significant differences at any electrode site in either condition.

Individual Ratings of Nd—Nds were identified in the grand means of 87.5% of the
adults (14 in each condition), 73.3% of the children with TD (13 in duration and 9 in
intensity), and 56.6% of the children with ADHD (8 in duration and 9 in intensity). For the
children with ADHD an additional analysis was done to determine if significant Nds were
elicited from the children rated as having present or questionable Nd. The 2 (attention) × 7

condition [F (1, 7) = 0.94, NS]. This finding supports the observation of a small Nd in the
intensity condition for the children with ADHD and suggests individual differences in
selective attention. An examination of the demographic and performance data failed to
reveal any obvious differences between the children with ADHD evidencing Nd in the
intensity condition and those who did not. It should be noted that only 5 children with
ADHD evidenced Nds in both conditions, 7 evidenced them in one condition but not the
other and 3 did not evidence Nds in either condition.

Latency Analyses—Onset and peak latencies for Nds rated as present and questionable
were compared using repeated measures MANOVAs with the factors of group (adult, TD,

the appropriate group and condition for the omnibus test but not for the post-hoc t-tests.

peak (t (21) = 5.85, p<.0005)].

P3b—The allocation of attention can also be assessed by comparing the ERP correlates of
target detection for stimuli in the attended and unattended channels. Targets in the
unattended channel will be referred to as “deviants”. Figure 3 presents the P3bs for the
correctly detected attended targets and the unattended deviants. P3bs were elicited from
participants in all three groups in both target conditions by the attended targets but were not
elicited by the unattended deviants suggesting that participants in all three groups were able
to follow the task instructions and maintain their attentional focus on the specified channel.
The attention effects on P3b were confirmed for the children using a repeated measures

deviant type, attention instruction, and electrode (T3, T4, TP7, TP8, T5, T6) comparing the

electrode sites examined for both the attended and unattended standards (see Table 4). A
similar analysis comparing the amplitude of a central positivity, P1, using six central
electrodes (FCz, Cz, FC3, FC4, C3, C4) found no main effect [F (1, 28) = .08, NS] or
significant interactions of group.

In summary, significant group Nds were elicited from the adults and children with TD but
not from the children with ADHD. However, some of the children with ADHD did appear to
evidence Nds (based on experimenter ratings) and when the waveforms from only those
children were examined a significant Nd was present in the intensity condition but not in the
duration condition. An early lateral positivity, Ta, elicited by attended and unattended
standards was found to be smaller in the children with ADHD than in those with TD. P3s
were elicited by correctly detected targets in all three groups but not by unattended deviants.

Discussion

This study examined attention allocation, maintenance, and distracter inhibition in children
with ADHD, children with TD, and adults during an auditory selective attention task. In
what follows we consider the implications of the resulting behavioral and
electrophysiological data, both for TD children and for children diagnosed with ADHD.

Selective attention in children with TD and adults

Children with TD and adults were able to selectively attend to the designated channel in this
paradigm, as reflected in clear Nds, a well-established electophysiological metric of auditory
selective attention, and the pattern of behavioral measures (adequate hits and a low rate of
false alarms). Nd onset and peak latency were earlier for the adults than for the children,
replicating Gomes et al. (2007) and suggesting developmental improvements in the speed
and efficiency of attention allocation (Ridderinkof & van der Stelt, 2000). Further, the
effectiveness of channel selection and the inhibition of distracter processing for both the
adults and children with TD was evidenced by the elicitation of P3bs to detected targets but
not to unattended deviants.

The use of two cues for channel identification, tone frequency and location, was expected to
positively impact performance and electrophysiological measures (Hansen & Hillyard,
1980) relative to Gomes et al. (2007) where channel was identified by frequency alone.
Evidence for this was not, however, at all apparent in our data. We were particularly
surprised that improvement was not apparent for the children where selective attention
processes are still developing and one might expect that multiple cues would be particularly
helpful. Future work using a within subject manipulation of number of cues for channel
selection will be better suited to assess the benefits to children and clinical groups of channel
cue redundancies in selectively attending to task relevant inputs.

Selective attention in ADHD

Notably, despite pretesting in which the difference levels were set to achieve a moderately
high level of accuracy, performance was quite weak for the children with ADHD once these
stimuli were placed in the context of a selective attention task. Children with ADHD showed
significantly poorer target detection than their age matched controls, and Nds were not
significant in the group electrophysiological data. An examination of the individual
waveforms suggested that Nds were evident in some of the children. However, the effect
was inconsistent. In these children, an Nd was usually only identified in one condition and
not the other, and many of the Nds were rated as questionably present. Nonetheless when
only the children rated as having present or questionable Nds were examined there was
evidence of a significant Nd in the intensity condition but not the duration condition.

Although somewhat weaker performance and smaller Nds were expected from the children
with ADHD when compared to those with TD, the absence of a significant Nd and the
extremely poor performance of the children with ADHD at the group level were not
anticipated. However, our current findings are generally consistent with Jonkman et al.
(1997), Loiselle et al. (1980), and Zambelli et al. (1977), all of whom found smaller Nds and
poorer performance in the children with ADHD than in their control children. Further, as in
the current study, Zambelli et al. (1977) directly compared the amplitude of the waveforms
elicited in the attended and unattended conditions and found no significant attention effect in
their participants with ADHD. In contrast, Rothenberger et al. (2000) found no evidence of
group differences in Nd between the children with ADHD and TD. There are two critical
differences between the Rothenberger study and ours. First, in the Rothenberger study the
target stimuli were very frequent. In their study, 40% of the stimuli in the attended channel
were targets which required button press responses, in contrast to 20% of attended stimuli in
the current study. Second, the targets in the Rothenberger study were easy to discriminate
(frequency target of 1500 Hz with a standard of 1000 Hz), while our targets were
individually selected to be moderately challenging to detect. These factors may have
increased the alertness of the participants in the Rothenberger study resulting in
exceptionally good compliance and very strong performance. The results of the
Rothenberger study might provide clues to optimizing performance in children with ADHD;
however, they do not explain why these children have general difficulties with attention
allocation in the first place.

So why is the allocation of attention particularly challenging for children with ADHD? We
will consider a number of possible explanations for our findings. First, perhaps the children
with ADHD were attending to all of the stimuli and consequently did not show
electrophysiological selective attention effects or behavioral benefits associated with
focusing on the critical channel. Although possible, this explanation seems unlikely given
that there are no indications that the unattended deviants were processed as targets
(unattended deviants did not elicit P3bs or a proportional increase in FA) as would be
expected if the children were actively attending to all of the stimuli. Alternatively, perhaps
these children had trouble attending to any of the stimuli. Again, although possible, this
explanation also seems unlikely given that the targets in the attended channel were
processed differently than deviants in the unattended channel (as indexed by measures of
P3). Trouble attending to the task would be expected to result in similar sized, and probably
small, P3bs to both attended targets and unattended deviants.

Another possibility is suggested by the significantly smaller Tas elicited by both the
attended and unattended standards from the children with ADHD as compared to those from
the children with TD. Perhaps the children with ADHD were trying to comply with the task
demands but were inefficiently attending to (Bekker et al, 2005) or processing the sensory
information making the task more difficult. As such they were engaged in the task but were
less consistent and effective in their performance due to limited information about the
stimuli. This interpretation of our data is consistent with cascade models of information
processing in which restricted early information has cascading implications for later
processing (McClelland, 1979). In our paradigm, limited information about the stimuli
would impact the attention related ERPs in two ways. First, it would obviously impact the
representation of the current stimulus, but it might also reduce the quality of the memory of
the standard (referred to as the attentional trace; Näätänen, 1992; Näätänen et al, 2001)
making it harder to make judgments about the current stimulus. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to determine if similar group differences in the Ta were seen in other selective
attention studies as none of them presented data from lateral electrodes and most only
recorded from midline sites. However, a similar component has been shown to have reduced

amplitude and increased latency in children with severe language impairments (but normal
hearing) when compared to children with TD (Tonnquist-Ulen, 1996).

Ta, one of the components of the auditory T-complex (Ponton et al, 2002; Tonnquist-Uhlen
et al., 2003), has not been extensively studied, but appears to reach mature amplitude and
latency relatively early (Tonnquist-Uhlen et al., 2003) and to be best represented in dipole
source models by radial dipoles located in parabelt area of secondary auditory cortex
(Ponton et al., 2002). As the Ta component matures early and is relatively insensitive to
attention, at least in our study, it may reflect basic, stimulus processing. The reduced
amplitude Ta seen in the children with ADHD may reflect a dampening of information
available to this system, more limited activation, or immature/incomplete neural
synchronization (Gilley et al., 2005). All of these explanations would suggest that the
information available for making decisions about channel membership and target identity is
impoverished. Further, it is possible that the reduced Ta reflects aberrant processing earlier
in the auditory system. Studies examining brain-stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) in
children with attention deficit disorder as compared to children with typical development
have found transmission delays; specifically longer latencies for waves III and V, and
transmission times between waves I–III and III–V (Lahat et al., 1995; Puente et al., 2002).
As wave III is generated in the pons and wave V in the midbrain (Näätänen, 1992), the
delays in these waves and the increased transmission times suggest possible brainstem
dysfunction in ADHD. Such a processing delay at the level of the brainstem could result in
impoverished cortical representations and poor performance, especially in challenging
situations. Notably, if confirmed, such findings might be consistent with the notion that
ADHD is not due to a primary deficit in higher cortical executive/prefrontal functioning
(Barkley et al., 1997; Pennington and Ozonoff, 1996), but rather that differences in earlier-
developing subcortical regions have a significant impact on the development and
functioning of these more rostral brain structures (Halperin & Schulz, 2006; Sergeant,
2000).

These findings must be viewed within the context of several limitations. The lateral Ta
group differences, while intriguing, were post-hoc and thus, should be considered cautiously
until replicated. Second, we did not systematically assess psychiatric disorders other than
ADHD, although parents were queried about previous diagnoses, and only 2 children were
reported to have been diagnosed with another psychiatric disorder, conduct disorder in both
cases. Consequently, we are unable to determine with certainty the degree to which the
results might be affected by other possible comorbidities.

This study confirms that children with ADHD have difficulty selectively attending to
competing channels of auditory information, with much poorer target detection performance
compared to their typically developing peers, and the virtual absence of an
electrophysiological index of selective attention (the Nd). Examination of the sensory
evoked responses suggests a possible contributing factor to these processing difficulties.
Namely, an impoverished representation of the auditory signal (as suggested by a
diminished Ta) might have cascading effects on later discrimination, especially in the face
of a complex auditory environment. Future work will follow up on the notion that basic
sensory processing is impaired in children with ADHD.

Highlights

1. Children with ADHD, as a group, exhibited almost no effect of attention on Nd,

whereas an effect was elicited from children with typical development.

In contrast, both children with ADHD and typical development exhibited larger
P3bs for attended targets than unattended deviants suggesting adequate
inhibition of distracter stimuli.

3. Reduced Ta amplitude was found for the children with ADHD which was not

impacted by attention and may reflect reduced sensory information.

Grand mean ERPs elicited from participants in the three groups at Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz, and Pz.
The gray lines are the ERPs elicited by the standard tones when they were in the attended
channel and the black lines are the ERPs elicited by the standard tones when they were in
the unattended channel. In this and all subsequent figures, stimuli were presented at time
zero, positive is up, and waveform were smoothed for display.

Figure 2.
Grand mean difference waveforms (Nd) elicited from participants in all three groups
obtained by subtracting the ERPs elicited by the standard tones when they were unattended
from the ERPs elicited by the standard tones when they were attended at selected electrode
sites (Fz, FCz, Cz). The gray, black, and dotted lines are the waveforms elicited from the
adult, children with TD and children with ADHD, respectively.

Figure 3.
Grand mean ERPs (P3b) elicited by the correctly detected attended targets and unattended
deviants compared to the relevant standards in both the duration and intensity conditions for
all three groups at Pz. The black lines are the ERPs elicited by the target/deviant tones and
the gray lines are the ERPs elicited by the standard tones.
