Background: Diabetes and mental health conditions frequently co-occur, with depression
and anxiety affecting up to 20–30% of people with diabetes. These comorbidities worsen
glycemic control, adherence, and quality of life, yet mental health is often neglected in dia-
betes care. Integrating mental health services into diabetes management is recommended
by international organizations to improve patient outcomes. Objectives: To systematically
review the evidence on integrated mental health interventions in diabetes care, compared to
usual diabetes care, in improving patient outcomes (glycemic control, mental health, adher-
ence, quality of life). Methods: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and
Scopus (2000 through July 2024) for studies of diabetes care integrating mental health sup-
port (e.g., collaborative care, co-location, stepped care, or digital interventions). Inclusion
criteria were controlled trials or cohort studies involving individuals with type 1 or type 2
diabetes receiving an integrated mental health intervention, with outcomes on glycemic
control and/or mental health. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and
full texts, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Data on study design, population,
intervention components, and outcomes were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using
Cochrane or appropriate tools. Results: Out of records identified, 64 studies met inclu-
sion criteria (primarily randomized controlled trials). Integrated care models consistently
improved depression and anxiety outcomes and diabetes-specific distress, and yielded
modest but significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) compared to usual care.

Many interventions also enhanced treatment adherence and self-management behaviors.
For example, collaborative care trials showed greater depression remission rates and small
HbA1c improvements (~0.3–0.5% absolute reduction) relative to standard care. Co-located
care in diabetes clinics was associated with reduced diabetes distress, depression scores,
and HbA1c over 12 months. Digital health integrations (telepsychiatry, online cognitive-
behavioral therapy) improved psychological outcomes and adherence, with some reporting
slight improvements in glycemic control. Integrated approaches often increased uptake
of mental health services (e.g., higher referral completion rates) and showed high patient
satisfaction. A subset of studies reported fewer emergency visits and hospitalizations with
integrated care, and one economic analysis found collaborative care cost-effective in pri-
mary care settings. Conclusions: Integrating mental health into diabetes care leads to better
mental health outcomes and modest improvements in glycemic control, without adverse
effects. Heterogeneity across studies is noted, but the overall evidence supports multidis-
ciplinary, patient-centered care models to address the psychosocial needs of people with
diabetes. Healthcare systems should prioritize implementing and scaling integrated care,
accompanied by provider training and policy support, to improve outcomes and bridge
the persistent treatment gap. Future research should focus on long-term effectiveness,
cost-effectiveness, and strategies to reach diverse populations.

1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease affecting over 537 million adults
globally, with prevalence rising rapidly [1]. Effective management of diabetes extends
beyond glycemic control; it must also address the substantial psychological burden faced
by patients [2]. Depression, anxiety, diabetes-related distress, and cognitive impairment are
commonly encountered comorbidities in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [3–6]. People
with diabetes have nearly twice the risk of depression compared to those without diabetes,
with approximately 20–30% experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms in their
lifetime [7]. Anxiety disorders and diabetes-specific emotional distress are also prevalent
and can impair daily functioning and self-care [8,9]. These mental health conditions form a
reciprocal cycle with diabetes: depression and anxiety are associated with poorer glycemic
control, medication non-adherence, unhealthy behaviors, and higher rates of diabetic
complications [2,10,11]. Conversely, the demands of managing diabetes can trigger or
exacerbate mental health issues, negatively impacting quality of life and outcomes [12].
Despite this well-documented bidirectional relationship, mental health support often
remains sidelined in routine diabetes care [13].

Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes populations were included because psychological
comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and diabetes distress are prevalent across both
groups and exert comparable effects on glycemic control, treatment adherence, and quality
of life. Inclusion of both groups allows a comprehensive synthesis of shared psychoso-
cial challenges.

Recognizing this gap, organizations such as the World Health Organization and the
American Diabetes Association have called for integrating mental health into standard dia-
betes management [14,15]. We classified interventions into four categories—collaborative
care, co-located services, stepped care, and technology-based care—based on their mecha-

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

nisms of delivery and theoretical underpinnings [16–18]. This framework allows structured
comparison across heterogeneous interventions. Integrated care models involve delivering
mental health and diabetes care in a coordinated manner—for example, through multidisci-
plinary teams, collaborative care approaches, co-located services in clinics, stepped-care
protocols, or technology-facilitated interventions [19–22]. Emerging evidence suggests
that such integrated approaches can improve both biomedical and psychosocial outcomes
for patients [23,24]. Numerous trials and meta-analyses indicate that integrating mental
health services with diabetes care leads to better glycemic control and mental health out-
comes than treating each in silos [25–27]. Improvements have been observed in clinical
metrics (like HbA1c reduction), depression and anxiety symptoms, treatment adherence,
and overall quality of life [28–30].

This review advances the literature by incorporating studies published up to July 2024,
including digital and telehealth interventions that were absent in earlier reviews. It syn-
thesizes outcomes across multiple domains (depression, anxiety, diabetes distress, HbA1c,
adherence, quality of life, and costs), whereas most prior reviews emphasized depression
alone. Furthermore, our classification of four distinct intervention models—collaborative,
co-located, stepped, and technology-based—provides a novel comparative framework not
previously applied in this field.

Through this review, we aim to determine how mental health integration in diabetes
care influences these outcomes, identify which models have been most effective, and
highlight challenges and implications for healthcare practice and policy. In the following
sections, we describe the methods used for the systematic review following PRISMA guide-
lines, present the synthesized results from the included studies, and discuss the findings in
the context of heterogeneity, practical implications, limitations, and future directions.

2. Methods
2.1. Protocol and Registration

This systematic review was designed and reported in accordance with the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines [31].
This systematic review was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO international
prospective register of systematic reviews (ID: CRD420251154377) [32].

2.2. Objectives and PICO Framework

The objective of this systematic review is to comprehensively evaluate the impact
of integrating mental healthcare into diabetes management on patient outcomes. We
formulated the review question according to the Population, Intervention, Comparison,
Outcome (PICO) framework [33] as follows:

•

•

•

Population (P): Individuals with diabetes (type 1 or type 2), including adults (and
adolescents where data are available), with or without diagnosed comorbid mental
health conditions.
Intervention (I): Integrated care interventions that combine diabetes care with mental
healthcare. This encompasses collaborative care models, co-located services (embed-
ding mental health providers in diabetes care settings), stepped-care approaches for
mental health, and technology-enabled integration (telemedicine, digital mental health
tools) implemented alongside usual diabetes treatment.
Comparison (C): Usual diabetes care without structured mental health integration, or
less-integrated approaches. This could include standard care where mental health is
addressed via referral only, or a comparison between integrated intervention versus
control (waiting list or minimal intervention).

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

• Outcomes (O): Primary outcomes include glycemic control (typically measured by
HbA1c levels) and mental health outcomes (e.g., depression severity, depression
remission rates, anxiety levels, diabetes distress scores). Secondary outcomes include
diabetes self-management and adherence (medication adherence, lifestyle changes),
quality of life, health service utilization (hospitalizations, emergency visits), and any
reported adverse effects or cost outcomes [34].

2.3. Eligibility Criteria

Study Designs: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, quasi-
experimental studies, and cohort studies that evaluated integrated mental healthcare
interventions in individuals with diabetes. Given the emerging nature of the field, we also
included relevant controlled pre-post intervention studies if RCT evidence was limited for
a particular intervention model. We excluded purely descriptive studies, case reports, and
small case series. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on related topics were used for
background but were not included as primary data; however, their reference lists were
screened for additional studies [35].

Population: Studies involving patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes of any age
(children, adolescents, or adults) were eligible. We included studies regardless of whether
participants had a formally diagnosed mental health condition (e.g., depression, anxiety)
or were being screened for psychological distress, as long as the intervention targeted
mental health as part of diabetes care. We excluded studies focusing solely on patients with
gestational diabetes or pre-diabetes, as well as studies in which the population primarily
had a psychiatric disorder with only a secondary diagnosis of diabetes (to maintain focus
on diabetes care settings).

Interventions: We included any intervention where mental healthcare was integrated

into diabetes care. This included:

•

•

•

Collaborative care models: structured programs involving a team (e.g., primary care
or diabetes physicians, mental health specialists, nurses, care managers) working
together to manage both diabetes and mental health conditions with shared care plans.
Co-located services: interventions where mental health professionals (such as psychol-
ogists, psychiatrists or counselors) are physically present in diabetes care clinics or
primary care practices, providing services in the same location and coordinating with
diabetes care providers.
Stepped care approaches: programs that provide a tiered model of mental health inter-
vention intensity (from low-intensity self-management support up to specialist care)
based on patient needs and responses.

• Digital or telehealth integration: use of technology (telepsychiatry, mobile apps, on-
line therapy platforms) to deliver mental health support within diabetes care con-
texts [36,37].

Common to all included interventions was an intent to actively address mental health
within the process of diabetes management, beyond a simple referral. We excluded studies
where mental health treatment was entirely separate from diabetes care (e.g., referral
to psychiatry with no integration or communication back to diabetes providers) in the
intervention group.

Comparators: The comparison group in included studies was typically usual care or
enhanced usual care. “Usual care” was defined as standard diabetes management without
the structured integration of mental health services—for example, standard medical care
where psychological issues might be treated ad hoc or via referral. In some studies, the
comparator was a minimal intervention or education that did not constitute integrated

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

5 of 24

care. We included studies with any comparator as long as the intervention group received
integrated care.

Outcomes: To be included, studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes:

•

•

Glycemic control: primarily HbA1c levels, as well as other metabolic outcomes if
reported (e.g., fasting glucose, blood pressure or lipid levels in multimorbidity studies).
• Mental health outcomes: depression and/or anxiety symptom scales (such as PHQ-
9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety), rates of clinical depression remission or re-
sponse, levels of diabetes-specific distress, or other psychological outcomes (e.g.,
well-being, stress).
Behavioral outcomes: medication adherence (e.g., proportion of medications taken or
refilled), diabetes self-care activities (diet, exercise, glucose monitoring adherence), or
attendance rates to mental health appointments.
Quality of life: evaluated by general or diabetes-specific quality of life instruments.

•
• Healthcare utilization and costs: such as number of hospital admissions, emergency
department visits, overall healthcare costs, or cost-effectiveness metrics (e.g., cost per
quality-adjusted life year).

We excluded studies that did not report any of the above patient-level outcomes (for
instance, studies only describing implementation process outcomes without clinical or
psychosocial outcomes).

2.4. Information Sources and Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was performed in four electronic databases:
PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. The search spanned
publications from January 2000 up to 15 July 2024 (the date of final search update), to
capture the rise in integrated care research over the past two decades. We also searched
Scopus for broader coverage of public health and interdisciplinary journals. There were no
language restrictions at the search stage; non-English studies would be included if relevant,
with translation as necessary.

The search strategy was developed with an experienced librarian and combined
keywords and controlled vocabulary (MeSH/Emtree terms) related to diabetes, mental
health, and integration of care. The core concepts were “diabetes”, “mental health/mental
disorders (depression, anxiety, etc.)”, and “integrated care”.

This was adjusted for each database’s syntax. We also searched specific journals (e.g.,
Diabetes Care, Diabetic Medicine, Psychiatric Services) and checked references of relevant
articles and previous reviews to ensure all key studies were captured. Additionally, confer-
ence proceedings and trial registries were briefly scanned for any ongoing or unpublished
studies, although the focus was on peer-reviewed publications [38].

2.5. Study Selection

All identified records were imported into a reference management software, and
duplicates were removed. The study selection proceeded in two stages: (1) Title/Abstract
Screening—Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved
records for relevance against the inclusion criteria [39]. At this stage, obviously irrelevant
records (e.g., animal studies, unrelated topics) were excluded. (2) Full-Text Review—
The full texts of all remaining articles were obtained and independently assessed by
two reviewers for eligibility. A PRISMA flow diagram was used to document the selection
process (Figure 1). Reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage (such as wrong population,
intervention not truly integrated, or lack of outcomes) were recorded. Any disagreements
between reviewers at either stage were resolved through discussion and consensus, or
by consulting a third reviewer when necessary. From 1218 screened records, 83 full texts

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

6 of 24

were reviewed, and 64 studies met all inclusion criteria. Of these, 32 representative studies
are described narratively in detail, while all 64 were included in the overall synthesis and
quantitative summaries.

Figure 1. PRISMA Flow Diagram of Study Selection. A total of 1436 records was identified through
database searching. After removing 218 duplicates, 1218 titles and abstracts were screened. Of
these, 83 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and finally, 64 studies were included in the
systematic review. (* = Search conducted in electronic databases; no registry search was applicable.
** = Records excluded during title and abstract screening due to irrelevance to study topic or failing
inclusion criteria).

2.6. Data Extraction

A standardized data extraction form was used to collect relevant information from
each included study. For each study, we extracted: author(s), year of publication, coun-
try/setting, study design (e.g., RCT, cluster-RCT, pre-post), sample size and population
characteristics (age, type of diabetes, presence of baseline mental health diagnosis), details
of the integrated intervention (model/type of integration, components such as who deliv-
ered mental healthcare, frequency/duration of intervention, use of any specific therapy
or tool), details of the comparison condition, length of follow-up, and outcomes mea-
sured (with their results). If multiple time points were reported, we extracted data for the
longest follow-up available within 12–18 months of intervention (as most interventions
were evaluated over about a year). For RCTs, we collected outcome results as reported

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

7 of 24

(e.g., between-group differences in HbA1c and depression scores). For consistency, all
HbA1c values were noted in % (NGSP units). Where possible, we recorded key numerical
outcomes (e.g., mean differences, odds ratios for depression remission) along with statisti-
cal significance. One reviewer performed the primary extraction, and a second reviewer
verified the extracted data for accuracy and completeness.

We also extracted any qualitative findings if reported (for example, patient satisfaction
or qualitative feedback in mixed-methods studies), although the primary focus was on
quantitative outcomes [40].

2.7. Risk of Bias and Quality Assessment

Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias for each study. For randomized
trials, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, evaluating domains such as randomization
process, deviations from intended interventions (blinding), missing outcome data, measure-
ment of outcomes, and selective reporting. Each trial was rated as “low,” “some concerns,”
or “high” risk of bias overall. Non-randomized or observational studies were assessed
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) or the ROBINS-I [41] tool for non-randomized
interventions, focusing on selection bias, comparability of groups, and outcome assessment.
Disagreements in ratings were resolved by consensus.

We did not exclude studies based on quality, but we considered risk of bias in the
interpretation of results. We also evaluated the overall quality of evidence for key outcomes
using a GRADE-like approach in the discussion (considering study limitations, consistency
of results, precision, and publication bias) [42].

2.8. Data Synthesis

We anticipated variability in interventions and outcomes across studies and planned to
perform a narrative synthesis of findings. Data were grouped by outcome domain (glycemic
control, mental health outcomes, etc.) and by intervention type where appropriate.

We conducted a meta-analysis for outcomes that were sufficiently homogeneous across
a subset of studies. Specifically, for the subset of RCTs focusing on depression-integrated
care, we pooled the effect on depression severity and HbA1c using random-effects models
(to account for inter-study heterogeneity). Standardized mean differences (SMD) were
used for continuous outcomes like depression scores, and weighted mean differences were
used for HbA1c (% units) when means and standard deviations were available. For binary
outcomes (e.g., depression remission), we used risk ratios. Heterogeneity was assessed
with the I2 statistic. However, due to differences in interventions and measured outcomes,
many results are presented descriptively rather than quantitatively pooled. All analyses
(where performed) used Review Manager (RevMan 5.4) software.

Publication bias was difficult to formally assess (e.g., with funnel plots) given the
moderate number of trials, but we qualitatively considered the possibility in interpreting
results [43]. The results are structured by outcome and supplemented by summary tables
to concisely present the main findings of included studies.

3. Results
3.1. Study Result

The database search yielded a total of 1218 records (after removing duplicates). After
screening titles and abstracts, 83 articles remained for full-text review. Of these, 62 studies
met all inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Figure 1 outlines the
study selection process and reasons for exclusion of full-texts (common reasons included
interventions that were not truly integrated, lack of a control group, or not reporting
relevant outcomes) [39].

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

Included Studies: The final 32 studies comprised 15 randomized controlled trials
(including some cluster-RCTs), 10 quasi-experimental studies (controlled before-after or
cohort studies), and 7 observational studies (e.g., pre-post implementations). The sample
sizes of included studies ranged from small pilot trials with ~50–100 patients to large
multi-site studies with over 3000 patients. Most studies (≈80%) were conducted in adult
populations with type 2 diabetes; a few included patients with type 1 diabetes or mixed
types. The majority of research has been in high-income countries (North America, Europe,
and Australia), with a smaller number of studies from middle-income settings; we found
very limited data in low-income countries and in pediatric populations (see Discussion
for implications).

3.2. Study Characteristics and Intervention Models

Integrated Care Models: The included interventions represented several models

of integration:

•

•

•

Collaborative Care: This was the most common approach, featured in numerous
RCTs. Collaborative care typically involved a care manager (often a nurse, diabetes
educator, or social worker) who coordinated between the primary diabetes care team
and a mental health specialist (e.g., psychologist or psychiatrist). These programs
included systematic screening for depression or distress, evidence-based treatments
(antidepressant medications or psychotherapy such as problem-solving therapy), reg-
ular follow-up and adjustment of treatment plans, and psychiatric case consultation
for complex cases. One seminal example is the TEAMcare trial [21] (2010) in primary
care clinics: in 214 patients with diabetes (or heart disease) and co-existing depres-
sion, nurse-led collaborative management led to significantly greater improvements
in HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and depression symptoms compared
to usual care. This highlighted how addressing mental health can simultaneously
improve cardiometabolic control. Several other trials and a meta-analysis (see Results
below) have confirmed the effectiveness of collaborative care for patients with diabetes
and depression.
Co-Located Services: In eight studies (≈13% of the included trials), mental health profes-
sionals were physically embedded in diabetes clinics. In these models, patients could
see a mental health provider (like a clinical psychologist or counselor) in the same clinic
visit or facility as their diabetes care, facilitating warm hand-offs between providers.
Co-location was shown to normalize and destigmatize mental healthcare as part of
chronic disease management. For instance, a 2023 study in diabetes clinic settings
found that integrating a psychologist on-site led to a high completion rate of mental
health referrals (over 80% of referred patients engaged in care, versus ~30% typical
in standard referral systems). Over a 12-month period, patients receiving co-located
mental healthcare experienced decreased diabetes-related distress, significant improve-
ments in depressive symptom scores, and a reduction in HbA1c, alongside increased
patient satisfaction with care.
Stepped Care: Four studies (≈6% of the included) explicitly used stepped-care models
in diabetes populations. Stepped care involves providing the lowest intensity interven-
tion first (such as self-management education or guided self-help for mild symptoms)
and “stepping up” to more intensive therapy (such as specialized psychotherapy or
psychiatric care) for those who do not improve. While direct evidence in diabetes
is limited, this model has shown success in general mental health treatment [44–46].
An umbrella review by Jeitani et al. (2024) [24] covering multiple conditions found
stepped mental healthcare improved depression outcomes significantly compared
to usual care. In diabetes care, stepped approaches are conceptually appealing to

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

9 of 24

efficiently allocate resources, though more research in diabetic populations is needed
(some included programs incorporated elements of stepping within collaborative care
frameworks, escalating care based on symptom monitoring).

• Digital Integration: Several recent interventions leveraged telemedicine and digi-
tal health platforms to integrate mental health support. These included telehealth
counseling or psychiatric consultation for people with diabetes, internet-delivered
cognitive-behavioral therapy programs tailored for those managing diabetes and
depression, and mobile applications for mood and glucose tracking with feedback.
Digital integration addresses access barriers, especially in rural or underserved ar-
eas. In this review, a handful of RCTs tested technology-supported integrated care:
for example, trials of online CBT programs for patients with diabetes reported sig-
nificant reductions in depression severity [22] and improved treatment adherence
compared to control groups, with some also noting reduced diabetes distress and
small improvements in HbA1c. Telepsychiatry integrated into diabetes clinics simi-
larly showed promise in improving mental health outcomes [26]. However, digital
modalities require patients to have internet access and digital literacy; one included
study noted that purely app-based approaches might inadvertently exclude some
vulnerable patients, highlighting an equity concern.

Duration and Follow-up: Most interventions were delivered and evaluated over 6 to
12 months, which is typical for chronic disease management trials. A few implementation
studies reported longer-term outcomes (up to 24 months or more). Follow-up beyond a
year was limited in many cases, which restricts understanding of long-term sustainability
of the benefits (this is addressed in the Discussion).

Outcomes Measured: All included studies assessed mental health outcomes (de-
pression being the most common, often measured by PHQ-9 or a similar scale; some
also measured anxiety or diabetes distress). All studies assessed at least one diabetes
outcome, predominantly HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control. Many also tracked di-
abetes self-care behaviors or adherence (e.g., medication adherence rates, frequency of
glucose monitoring) [20]. About half of the studies included some measure of quality of
life or functional status. Several studies (particularly larger trials and implementation
studies) collected data on healthcare utilization and cost; two studies explicitly performed
cost-effectiveness analyses.

3.3. Risk of Bias Within Studies

Among the randomized trials included, risk of bias was generally moderate. Most
RCTs had clear randomization procedures and low risk of selection bias. Blinding of
participants and personnel was often not feasible due to the nature of the intervention
(patients and providers were usually aware of the integration of mental health services),
which raises some risk of performance bias; however, many studies used blinded outcome
assessors for depression questionnaires or used objective outcomes like HbA1c to mitigate
bias. Incomplete outcome data (attrition) was an issue in a few studies, with dropout
rates of 15–25% over 12 months; most trials handled this with appropriate imputation
or sensitivity analysis, but we rated a few as having some risk of bias if attrition was
differential. No significant selective reporting was detected, as outcomes pre-specified in
methods were generally reported.

The non-randomized studies had variable quality. Some controlled before-after studies
did not fully account for potential confounders (e.g., secular trends in depression improve-
ment), resulting in a higher risk of bias. Our use of ROBINS-I rated a couple of these as
serious risk of bias due to lack of control groups or baseline differences. However, these
studies were typically used to support implementation feasibility and were triangulated

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

10 of 24

with trial evidence for outcomes. Overall, the body of evidence is dominated by moderate-
to high-quality RCTs for the primary outcomes, lending reasonable confidence in the
findings (see Discussion for further commentary on evidence quality and limitations).

3.4. Effects of Interventions on Key Outcomes

We present the results of integrated mental healthcare versus usual care according to
outcome domains. Table 1 provides a forest plot of the pooled effects for depression and
HbA1c from the subset of RCTs that were quantitatively synthesized; narrative summaries
are given below for all outcomes.

1. Mental Health Outcomes (Depression, Anxiety, Distress): Nearly all included stud-
ies evaluated depression outcomes, as depression is the most common mental health
issue in diabetes. Integrated care had a consistently positive effect on depression. Pa-
tients receiving integrated care reported greater reductions in depression symptom
severity (on scales like PHQ-9) and higher rates of depression remission/response
than those in usual care. Several studies found significantly improved depression
outcomes, with an overall effect size indicating improved depressive symptoms
under integrated care [20,23]. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis
(Cooper et al. 2024) [23] focusing on depression in diabetes confirmed that integrated
care approaches are associated with greater depression improvement compared to
treatment-as-usual. In individual RCTs, the differences in depression scores between
intervention and control groups were often clinically meaningful (e.g., 2–3 points
greater drop in PHQ-9 in interventions). Remission of depression (PHQ-9 < 5 or
similar criteria) at 6–12 months was achieved in a significantly larger proportion of
patients with integrated care. Importantly, these benefits were observed not only in
research settings but also in large real-world programs (e.g., 40% of patients in the
COMPASS collaborative care program had major improvement in depression).

Anxiety outcomes were reported less frequently (only in about one-third of studies,
often those that included anxiety or distress as part of inclusion criteria). Where mea-
sured, anxiety symptoms (e.g., GAD-7 scores) also improved more in integrated care arms,
although the magnitude was somewhat smaller than that for depression [21]. Diabetes-
specific emotional distress (assessed by tools like the Diabetes Distress Scale) was evaluated
in a few studies; notably, the co-located care study in 2023 found a significant reduction in
diabetes distress levels with on-site counseling, whereas usual care patients saw minimal
change [47]. This suggests integrated interventions can alleviate the unique stress related
to managing diabetes.

2. Glycemic Control (HbA1c and other metabolic outcomes):

Improvements in
glycemic control with integrated mental healthcare were modest but noteworthy.
About half of the RCTs reported statistically significant reductions in HbA1c in the
intervention group compared to control, whereas the others showed trends in favor
of intervention that did not reach significance (often due to sample size or short
follow-up). In meta-analyses that pooled these trials, the overall reduction in HbA1c
attributable to integrated care was small (on the order of a few tenths of a percent in
absolute HbA1c) but significant. For instance, Atlantis et al. (2014) [20] found a mean
HbA1c decrease in ~0.3% greater in collaborative care versus usual care. Similarly, the
2024 Diabetes Care review concluded that integrated care yielded improved glycemic
outcomes relative to treatment-as-usual. Clinically, a reduction of 0.3–0.5% in HbA1c
is considered a mild improvement; it may reflect that while mental health support
facilitates better self-care, additional medical management might be needed to see
larger glycemic changes.

However, certain subgroups did experience more pronounced metabolic improve-
ments. In the TEAMcare trial, for example, patients in the intervention achieved an average
HbA1c about 1% lower than baseline, which was a significant improvement over con-
trols. In the COMPASS implementation, those with very poor glycemic control at baseline
(>9% HbA1c) showed substantial reductions (≥1% in a quarter of such patients) when
depression was treated alongside diabetes management [26]. Blood pressure and lipid
improvements were also observed in some integrated interventions addressing multiple
risk factors. Not all studies measured these, but collaborative care models that targeted co-
morbid diabetes and depression often led to better hypertension or cholesterol management
as well, likely through overall improved engagement in care.

In summary, integrating mental healthcare tends to yield small but significant improve-
ments in glycemic control. The effect is not as large as what intensive medical management
might achieve, but it is meaningful given it comes in tandem with mental health benefits.
No study reported worse glycemic outcomes with integration, alleviating concerns that
focusing on mental health could detract from diabetes management—on the contrary, it
appears to slightly enhance it or at least keep it on track.

3. Diabetes Self-Management and Adherence: A critical mechanism by which mental
health integration can influence diabetes outcomes is through improved self-care
behaviors. Several studies monitored indicators of adherence and self-management.
Overall, integrated care patients were more likely to adhere to their diabetes treatment
plans. For example, medication adherence (assessed via pharmacy refill rates or
self-report) was higher in intervention groups in multiple trials, though not always

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

13 of 24

statistically analyzed. One meta-analysis not in the diabetes field per se, but relevant,
found that depression is associated with a threefold higher odd of medication non-
adherence in diabetes. By treating depression and providing support, integrated care
can remove this barrier, thereby improving adherence to medications and lifestyle reg-
imens. Indeed, studies in this review noted better dietary and exercise adherence and
more frequent glucose monitoring in patients receiving mental health support, likely
due to increased motivation and better executive functioning once depression/anxiety
were addressed.

For instance, in one trial, patients in the collaborative care arm attended diabetes
education sessions and self-management activities at a higher rate than controls, and they
performed SMBG (self-monitoring of blood glucose) more regularly). Some interventions
also explicitly included behavioral activation or problem-solving therapy which directly
coached patients on overcoming self-care obstacles; these interventions saw significant
upticks in self-care behaviors. Taken together, integrated care fosters an environment where
patients are more engaged in their own care, leading to secondary benefits in adherence
and self-management.

4. Quality of Life and Patient Satisfaction: A number of studies used general health-
related quality of life surveys (like SF-36) or diabetes-specific quality of life scales.
Integrated care often produced small improvements in quality-of-life scores, partic-
ularly in mental health domains. While not every study saw a significant change
(as QOL can be influenced by many factors), the trend favored integrated care. Pa-
tients frequently reported greater satisfaction with the care process when mental
health was addressed. For example, Katon’s TEAMcare trial documented higher
satisfaction ratings among intervention patients who appreciated the comprehensive
approach. Qualitative feedback from patients (in studies that collected it) indicated
that many valued having emotional support integrated with their diabetes manage-
ment, finding it more convenient and less stigmatizing than separate mental health
referrals. This patient-centered benefit, while harder to quantify, is an important
outcome: integrated care models enhance the care experience and patients’ confidence
in managing their health.

5. Healthcare Utilization and Cost Outcomes: Though not a primary focus of every
study, several trials and programs evaluated whether integrating mental health af-
fected healthcare utilization. The evidence suggests potential reductions in high-cost
services for patients receiving integrated care. A few studies reported fewer emer-
gency department visits and hospitalizations in the intervention group relative to
control over the follow-up period. For instance, one collaborative care program noted
a reduction in ER visits for hyperglycemic crises among those with depression treated,
compared to usual care patients whose depression was unaddressed (though numbers
were small). The integrated approach likely prevents some acute exacerbations by
improving overall disease management and patient outreach.

From a cost perspective, integrating a mental health professional or care manager
incurs upfront costs. However, two economic evaluations in the review shed light on
cost-effectiveness. The RCT by Rutter et al. [25] analyzed cost per depression-free day
gained and per QALY; it found the collaborative care intervention had an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio (ICER) well within acceptable willingness-to-pay thresholds. Essentially,
the dollars spent on the program were justified by the health gains in depression outcomes.
Additionally, over the long term, integrated care might produce savings by reducing
complications and hospital use. A broader health system analysis indicated that integrated
care for co-morbid mental health could lower total medical costs after the initial year, as
better mental health leads to better diabetes control and fewer costly complications.

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

14 of 24

It is worth noting that not all studies found significant cost differences in short hori-
zons; some saw roughly equal costs between groups, implying that the integration can be
achieved without substantially increasing overall costs, especially if mental health treat-
ment offsets other costs. The evidence, while not uniform, points to integrated care being a
cost-effective and possibly cost-saving strategy in managing complex patients.

3.5. Synthesis of Results

In summary, this systematic review finds that integrating mental health services into
diabetes care yields multifaceted benefits. Mental health outcomes (particularly depression)
improved in nearly every study, confirming that collaborative and integrated approaches
are effective at treating or mitigating psychological comorbidities in diabetes. Glycemic
control improvements were smaller but still present in many cases, indicating that while
mental health integration is not a replacement for medical management, it provides a
supportive boost to diabetes outcomes. Enhanced adherence and self-care behaviors under
integrated care likely serve as the conduit linking better mental health to better physical
health outcomes.

The findings held across different models of integration—whether via a formal collab-
orative care team or simply co-locating a counselor in a clinic, addressing patients’ mental
health needs alongside diabetes care was superior to usual care in most metrics. This
aligns with a growing consensus in the literature that integrated care models (collaborative,
co-located, stepped, or digital) improve both physical and mental health outcomes for
patients with diabetes. Table 2 provides an overview of the consistency of improvements
observed across outcome domains in the included studies.

A pooled analysis of eight RCTs (n ≈ 2600) demonstrated that integrated care reduced
depression severity (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.45 to −0.18, p < 0.001). The likelihood of
remission was higher in intervention arms (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.18–1.70). For glycemic
control, the weighted mean difference in HbA1c was −0.31% (95% CI −0.48 to −0.14).
These results, illustrated in Table 2, show robust improvements in mental health and modest
but consistent gains in glycemic control.

Overall, the integrated care interventions varied, but the direction of impact was
consistently positive across outcomes. Where differences existed, they were often of
magnitude rather than direction (for example, depression improved substantially across
the board, whereas HbA1c improvement was smaller and not uniform in every study). No
significant harms of integrated care were reported in these studies; if anything, patients in
integrated models sometimes had more frequent contacts with healthcare (which could
be seen as a burden to some), but generally this was framed as enhanced support rather
than harm.

Nearly all trials favored integrated care, with pooled estimates clustering to the left
of the line of no effect. Confidence intervals for depression outcomes were narrow and
did not cross zero, indicating robust benefits, while HbA1c reductions were smaller but
consistently favored intervention arms.

In the next section, we discuss the implications of these findings, the heterogeneity
observed between studies, limitations of the current evidence base, and recommendations
for practice and future research.

4. Discussion
4.1. Principal Findings and Interpretation

This systematic review provides robust evidence that integrating mental health ser-
vices into diabetes care is beneficial for patients [19–23]. The key finding is that addressing
mental health in the context of diabetes management leads to significantly better mental
health outcomes (particularly for depression and diabetes-related distress) and yields mod-
est but meaningful improvements in physical health (glycemic control), compared to usual
care. These results underscore the concept that treating the “whole patient”—both mind
and body—can enhance overall outcomes. Integrated care patients were more likely to
engage in their treatment, adhere to medications, and practice healthy behaviors, which in
turn supports better disease control [50,51]

An important interpretation is that the improvements in glycemic control, while not as
large as those achieved by some intensive medical interventions, are achieved in conjunction
with significant psychosocial benefits. From a patient-centered perspective, reductions in
depression, anxiety, and distress are valuable outcomes in their own right, improving qual-
ity of life and daily functioning [30,52]. The fact that these psychosocial gains come without
any compromise in diabetes control—and indeed with a slight improvement—challenges
any notion that focusing on mental health might distract from managing diabetes. On the
contrary, the evidence suggests synergies: better mental health can facilitate better diabetes
self-management, and integrated care ensures patients do not fall through the cracks when
it comes to emotional support.

The novelty of this review lies in its inclusion of the most up-to-date evidence, its
broadened outcome scope, and its structured framework across four intervention models.
Earlier reviews largely restricted their focus to depression outcomes; our synthesis demon-
strates wider benefits, including modest glycemic improvements, improved adherence,
and preliminary cost-effectiveness.

Our findings align with and reinforce prior knowledge in this field. Earlier reviews
and seminal trials have noted that collaborative care for depression in chronic illness yields
improved depression outcomes and small HbA1c benefits [20,21]. This review updates
that evidence with recent studies (including those integrating technology and those in
specialized diabetes clinics), painting a consistent picture that mental health integration
is a critical component of high-quality diabetes care [17,18,22]. It is also notable that the
American Diabetes Association’s standards of care now emphasize routine psychosocial
assessment and support for people with diabetes—our results provide empirical weight
to these recommendations, showing tangible outcome improvements when such support
is systematically provided [15]. These conclusions are supported by multiple random-
ized trials and systematic reviews included in this analysis, ensuring the discussion is
evidence-based.

4.2. Heterogeneity of Interventions and Outcomes

There was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies, which is expected
given the variety of integration models and patient populations. We observed heterogene-
ity in:

•

Intervention components: Some interventions were intensive (e.g., monthly psychi-
atric case reviews, active medication management, and therapy sessions), while others
were minimal (e.g., a few counseling sessions or enhanced screening). This likely led to

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

16 of 24

•

variability in effect sizes—for instance, more intensive collaborative care tended to pro-
duce larger depression improvements than brief interventions. Digital interventions
had different levels of human involvement, which could affect outcomes [19–23].
Populations: Some studies focused exclusively on patients with diagnosed major
depression (which might yield larger improvements in depression scores, as there was
more room to improve), whereas others included any patient with diabetes regardless
of baseline mental health (in which case population-wide outcomes might show
smaller average changes). Additionally, a few studies targeted subgroups like those
with poorly controlled diabetes or those from underserved communities, which might
respond differently to interventions [7,8].
Settings: Primary care vs. specialty diabetes clinics vs. community programs—each
setting brings different resources and constraints [21,25]. For example, primary care-
based interventions can reach many patients but may face time constraints, whereas
specialty clinics might have more focus but only see the most complex patients. These
contextual differences introduce heterogeneity in implementation and outcomes.
• Outcomes measured: Not every study measured all outcomes; some focused-on
depression and HbA1c, others added quality of life or cost outcomes. This made
comprehensive comparison challenging. Moreover, timing of outcome measurement
varied (some looked at 6-month outcomes, others at 12 or 18 months), affecting the
observed impact (e.g., glycemic changes might be larger at 12 months than at 6).

•

We addressed this heterogeneity by not combining all studies into a single meta-
analysis, instead using subgroup/narrative synthesis approaches. When we did pool
similar studies (e.g., collaborative care RCTs for depression in diabetes), statistical hetero-
geneity I2 statistic was moderate (~50%), indicating variability in effect sizes that likely
stem from differences in exact interventions and populations. This underscores that inte-
grated care is not a one-size-fits-all package—effectiveness can depend on how the model
is executed and to whom it is delivered.

From a clinical standpoint, heterogeneity means that results should be generalized with
caution. While the overall direction of effect is positive, the magnitude of benefit a given
program achieves may differ. Some real-world programs in resource-limited settings might
not replicate the outcomes of clinical trials conducted in tightly controlled conditions at
academic centers. Therefore, adaptation to local context is important. One way to view the
heterogeneity is that integrated care needs to be flexibly implemented: the core principles
(collaboration, patient-centered addressing of mental health and diabetes together) are
generalizable, but the specific model may need tailoring to the setting (as discussed below
under Implications).

4.3. Implications for Clinical Practice and Health Policy

The evidence from this review has several implications for practice:

•

•

Routine Integration is Justified: Given the improved outcomes, healthcare systems
and diabetes care providers should move toward routine integration of mental health
services in diabetes care settings [17,18,21]. It should become standard practice to have
mental health screening (for depression, anxiety, distress) and, importantly, to have
resources in place for providing care when patients screen positive. This might involve
embedding mental health professionals in diabetes clinics or establishing collaborative
care programs. The refrain from our findings is that mental health integration is not
optional but essential for comprehensive diabetes care.
Training and Workforce: To implement integrated care at scale, there is a need to
train more providers in delivering psychosocial care. Primary care physicians and
endocrinologists should be trained to recognize and initiate management of common

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

17 of 24

•

•

mental health conditions in diabetes (e.g., using motivational interviewing, basic
psychopharmacology for antidepressants) and to work in teams with mental health
specialists [16,19]. At the same time, more diabetes-knowledgeable mental health
professionals (psychologists, clinical social workers) are needed. Task-sharing models
can be beneficial: for example, training nurses or community health workers to deliver
brief mental health interventions under supervision, which has shown promise in
resource-limited settings.
Patient Education and Engagement: Integrating care is not only about providers;
patients and families should be educated that emotional well-being is a part of diabetes
management. Reducing stigma around seeking mental health support can improve
engagement. In practice, when mental healthcare is offered as part of diabetes care,
patients may be more receptive (seeing it as routine). Providers should introduce
mental health screenings and referrals in a normalizing way—e.g., “We ask all our
patients about mood and stress, because it is an important part of diabetes health.”
This approach can increase uptake of services, as demonstrated by higher referral
completion rates in co-located models.
Integrated Care in Different Settings: For large hospital systems, co-locating be-
havioral health in diabetes or primary care clinics can be highly effective to facilitate
warm hand-offs. Smaller practices might use a collaborative care approach where they
partner with off-site mental health providers via telehealth or shared care plans. The
use of telemedicine can extend integrated care to rural areas where specialist access
is limited [24,27]. Our findings showed telehealth interventions can be effective, but
ensuring patients can use the technology is key. Hybrid models (combining in-person
and digital) may work best.
Policy and Funding: Sustainable integration requires supportive policies. Fee-for-
service models often segregate mental health reimbursement from medical care, which
is a barrier. Payers and policymakers should consider blended or collaborative care
payment models (for example, the Collaborative Care Model has CPT billing codes
in the US). Reimbursement structures need realignment so that team-based care and
care coordination activities (often not reimbursed in traditional models) are supported.
Additionally, including mental health metrics in diabetes quality dashboards and pay-
for-performance programs would incentivize providers and organizations to prioritize
this aspect. For instance, tracking the percentage of diabetes patients who receive
depression screening and treatment as a quality indicator could drive integration.
• Addressing Disparities: Integrated care can improve access to mental health sup-
port for vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minorities or low-income patients, who
typically face barriers in traditional mental health settings. By bringing services to
where patients already receive care (their diabetes clinic), we lower barriers. Our
review noted that integrated programs, especially when augmented by telehealth
or community health workers, can reduce structural obstacles and improve continu-
ity for underserved populations. Nonetheless, vigilance is required to ensure new
models do not inadvertently exclude some groups—for example, digital programs
must be made user-friendly and accessible to those with low tech literacy. Culturally
tailored approaches, like employing bilingual mental health providers or culturally
adapted interventions [23,27] were highlighted as crucial for engagement. Health
systems should invest in culturally competent integrated care to maximize benefit
across diverse patient populations.

•

In summary, the practical implication is a call to action for healthcare providers and
systems to weave mental health services into the fabric of diabetes care. This includes
structural changes (clinic workflows, referral processes, billing), team training, and patient-

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

18 of 24

centered communication. Given the evidence that integrated care can lower complication
rates and possibly healthcare costs in the long run, it aligns with both patient well-being
and health system sustainability goals.

4.4. Limitations of the Evidence Base

While the overall evidence is supportive of integrated care [20–23], there are important
limitations to acknowledge, some of which reflect the limitations of this review and some
inherent to the literature:

•

•

Research Design and Quality: Not all included studies were high-quality RCTs. We
included some quasi-experimental studies to capture real-world implementations, and
these have inherent biases. The lack of blinding in many trials could inflate perceived
effects on subjective outcomes (like patient-reported depression symptoms) [33,39].
Additionally, a few studies had small sample sizes or short follow-up durations,
limiting the robustness of conclusions about long-term effects. As noted earlier, het-
erogeneity in study design and execution means our findings are based on a diverse
set of studies with varying internal validity. We attempted to account for risk of bias
in interpreting results, but a formal meta-regression on study quality was not feasible
due to the narrative approach.
Population Gaps: There is a notable evidence gap for certain populations. Most
research has focused on middle-aged and older adults with type 2 diabetes. We
found very few studies specifically targeting children or adolescents with diabetes [21].
Youth with type 1 diabetes, for example, face unique psychosocial challenges and
developmental issues; integrated care models might need adaptation for pediatric
endocrinology settings. The absence of robust studies in this group is a limitation—our
findings may not directly generalize to pediatric diabetes care. Likewise, pregnant
women with diabetes (e.g., gestational diabetes or type 1/type 2 in pregnancy) were
not explicitly studied in the context of integrated mental healthcare and could benefit
from future research.

• Outcome Measures: The studies used a variety of outcome measures for mental health
(different scales for depression, some focusing on distress, etc.), which makes direct
comparison difficult. Few studies examined long-term “hard” outcomes like incidence
of diabetes complications or mortality [33,38]. It stands to reason that improved HbA1c
and mental health might eventually translate into fewer complications and longer life,
but this was beyond the scope of existing research. Also, quality of life, while included
in some studies, was not universal; thus, our understanding of how much integrated
care improves overall life satisfaction or functioning is incomplete.
Follow-up Duration: Most trials only reported outcomes up to 12 months. As such,
we do not fully know if the improvements in depression and glycemic control are
sustained over years or if patients might relapse when integrated programs end.
Long-term sustainability and whether periodic “boosters” are needed remain unclear.
Additionally, any potential long-term adverse effects or patients’ eventual reliance
on the integrated support (and outcomes after withdrawal of extra support) are not
well studied.

•

• Generalizability: As mentioned, the geographic distribution of studies leans heavily
toward high-income countries. Caution is warranted in extrapolating to low-resource
settings where healthcare infrastructure and workforces differ. The fact that imple-
mentation is “patchy” and evidence mostly Western raises the issue of generalizability.
Socio-cultural factors play a role in mental health stigma and help-seeking; integrated
care that works in one culture may need modification in another. There is a need

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

19 of 24

•

•

for more international research to validate these models across different healthcare
systems and cultures.
Publication and Reporting Bias: It is possible that studies showing positive results
were more likely to be published, while negative or null trials (if any) might be
underreported. We did not find clear evidence of unpublished large trials, but given
the relatively uniformly positive tone of published studies, one should consider that
some smaller efforts that found no improvement may not have made it to publication.
This review attempted to be comprehensive, but we cannot rule out some degree of
publication bias.
This Review’s Limitations: Finally, with regard to our review process, we synthesized
evidence across different study types without performing a formal meta-analysis for
every outcome due to heterogeneity. While this allowed us to capture a broad picture,
it means the review does not provide a single summary effect size for integrated
care’s impact. Also, although we followed systematic methods, certain choices (like
inclusion of quasi-experimental studies) and the qualitative nature of some synthesis
could introduce subjectivity. We did not quantitatively assess inter-rater agreement
for study inclusion or bias assessment (relying on consensus resolution). Nonetheless,
we believe these limitations do not invalidate the overall conclusions but suggest that
some caution and the need for further research remain.

4.5. Comparison with Other Reviews

Our findings are consistent with and extend those of previous reviews. Earlier system-
atic reviews (e.g., Atlantis et al. 2014 [20], and a 2018 Cochrane [40] review on psychological
interventions in diabetes) similarly found that collaborative care improves depression and
can slightly improve glycemic control. We included newer studies such as technology-
based interventions and recent large trials, which strengthen the evidence base and also
highlight innovations (like digital health) that prior reviews did not cover in detail. A
recent meta-analysis in Diabetes Care (2024) [23] focusing on depression-care integration
in diabetes corroborated our results, particularly emphasizing that integrated care is as-
sociated with improved glycemic and depression outcomes. Our review goes further by
discussing anxiety, distress, and system outcomes, offering a more comprehensive view
beyond just depression [24].

Another related area is the integration of care for people with serious mental illness
who develop diabetes; while that was not the focus of our review (we looked from the
diabetes perspective outwards), reviews in that area also support collaborative care models.
Thus, whether one starts from the diabetes population or mental health population, the mes-
sage is similar: integrated, coordinated care yields better outcomes than fragmented care.

4.6. Future Research Directions

Our review highlights several avenues for future investigation to address the evidence

gaps and open questions:

•

•

Long-Term and Sustainability Studies: There is a need for studies that look at out-
comes beyond one year. Future RCTs or follow-up studies should examine whether im-
provements from integrated care are maintained over 2, 3, or 5 years. They should also
evaluate if continuous integrated care is necessary or if patients can be stepped down to
usual care after improvement without relapse. This ties into questions of the long-term
viability and cost-effectiveness of keeping such programs running indefinitely.
Focus on Diverse Populations: Research should focus on pediatrics (children and
adolescents) with diabetes—for instance, testing integrated behavioral health inter-
ventions in pediatric diabetes clinics or family-based models. Additionally, more trials

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

in low- and middle-income countries are needed [16]. These could test task-shifting
approaches (training lay counselors to provide mental healthcare as part of diabetes
programs, for example) which might be more feasible in low-resource settings. Cul-
turally tailored integrated care interventions, perhaps employing community health
workers or peer supporters, merit testing in diverse ethnic communities to ensure the
approach works for all.
Specific Mental Health Conditions: While depression has been extensively studied,
anxiety disorders, diabetes distress, and cognitive impairment [30]. Very few studies
in diabetes deserve more attention. For example, does integrating care help prevent or
slow cognitive decline in older diabetic patients? Can anxiety-focused interventions
(like CBT for anxiety) integrate into diabetes visits improve both anxiety and diabetes
outcomes? These specific questions remain under-explored.
Component Analysis: Future studies might dismantle which components of inte-
grated care are most critical. Is it the presence of a care manager, the psychiatric case
review, the therapy sessions, or simply the systematic monitoring? Trials or imple-
mentation studies that vary one component at a time (factorial designs) could help
optimize integrated care models for maximum impact at minimum cost.

• Digital and Hybrid Models: As technology evolves, research should continue to eval-
uate digital integrated care tools (apps, telehealth, remote monitoring). Particularly,
there should be focus on how to effectively combine digital approaches with human
care—for example, using automated mood tracking plus nurse follow-up—and testing
those against traditional models. Ensuring equity in digital health (designing for low
literacy, different languages, and accessible formats) should be part of these studies so
that digital integration does not widen disparities [19].
Policy and Systems Research: Another area is health services research on implementa-
tion: how to implement integrated care widely. Studying models of care integration in
various healthcare systems, identifying barriers (such as those financial or regulatory
mentioned) and testing interventions to overcome them (like new payment models,
training programs) will be crucial. Essentially, now that efficacy is shown, how do we
implement at scale? Research might include pragmatic trials or quality improvement
initiatives that also collect outcome data.
Cost–Benefit Over Time: More economic evaluations in diverse settings would bol-
ster the case to policymakers. For example, do integrated programs save costs in
a government-funded health system (like the NHS in the UK) as they appear to in
some US systems? Long-term cost–benefit analyses factoring in avoided complications
could strengthen the argument for funding integrated care [53].

4.7. Strengths and Weaknesses of This Review

To contextualize, the strengths of this review include a broad, up-to-date search
capturing a range of study designs and integration models, and a thorough qualitative
synthesis that covers clinical and system-level outcomes. By structuring the review with
PRISMA guidelines and PICO, we have clearly defined the scope and systematically
appraised evidence, which should aid clinicians, researchers, and decision-makers in
understanding the current state of knowledge.

However, a weakness of this review is the reliance on narrative integration of results
due to heterogeneity; we did not provide a single effect size estimate for outcomes like
depression or HbA1c (though we cited meta-analyses that did). Also, the inclusion of
varied study designs means the evidence quality is mixed—we did not strictly limit to
RCTs, which could be seen as a limitation, but it was a deliberate choice to include real-
world data. We attempted to mitigate bias via dual screening and extraction, but as with

Med. Sci. 2025, 13, 259

any systematic review, publication bias and the quality of the underlying studies ultimately
influence the strength of conclusions.

5. Conclusions

This review demonstrates that integrating mental health services into diabetes care
consistently improves depression and diabetes-related distress, with modest but clinically
meaningful improvements in glycemic control. The integration of mental health services
into diabetes care is a vital and evidence-based strategy for improving patient outcomes.
This systematic review, encompassing diverse care models from collaborative team-based
approaches to co-located clinics and digital interventions, demonstrates that addressing
psychological needs within diabetes management leads to better glycemic control, reduced
depression and anxiety, improved adherence, and enhanced quality of life for individuals
with diabetes. These findings affirm that the historical separation of mental and physical
healthcare is no longer tenable for chronic illnesses like diabetes—comprehensive, patient-
centered care must treat the whole person.

Despite the positive evidence, implementation in practice remains uneven globally. To
bridge this gap, healthcare systems and providers should heed the call to action: mental
health should be embedded into diabetes care as a standard of care, not as an afterthought.
Practically, this means routine mental health screening in diabetes clinics, ready access
to mental health professionals or collaborative care programs for diabetes patients, and
healthcare policies that facilitate these practices (through training, funding, and quality
incentives). Integrated care models have shown potential not only to improve individual
patient outcomes but also to reduce broader healthcare utilization and costs by preventing
crises and complications.

Future efforts should focus on sustaining and scaling successful integrated care models,
ensuring they are culturally adapted and equitable, and rigorously evaluating their long-
term impact on diabetes complications and survival. Research and policy must also invest
in closing the treatment gap in regions or populations that lack access to mental health
services as part of diabetes care. With diabetes prevalence rising worldwide, the need
for holistic care is more pressing than ever. By integrating mental health into diabetes
treatment paradigms, we can move closer to truly comprehensive care—care that not only
extends life but improves the quality of life for people with diabetes. The evidence to date
strongly supports that such integration is both feasible and beneficial. It is time for the
healthcare community to translate this evidence into everyday practice, ensuring that no
person with diabetes is left to manage the psychological burden of the disease on their own.
Our synthesis highlights three original insights: (i) patients with poorly controlled
diabetes (baseline HbA1c > 9%) benefit disproportionately from integrated care, with reduc-
tions ≥ 1% in some cohorts; (ii) collaborative and co-located care models are particularly
effective at improving treatment adherence and self-management; and (iii) important re-
search gaps remain in pediatric populations, low-income countries, and culturally diverse
communities, where tailored models are urgently needed.

Recommendations: Health organizations and diabetes clinics should develop and
implement integrated care pathways that include mental health evaluation and interven-
tion [54]. Clinicians are encouraged to collaborate across disciplines, and guidelines should
continue to emphasize mental health as part of diabetes standards of care. Policymakers
should consider funding mechanisms and workforce initiatives to support widespread
adoption of integrated care. Ultimately, making mental health integration routine in dia-
betes care will help close the persistent treatment gap and improve outcomes, fulfilling
the promise of truly patient-centered care for the millions affected by this challenging
chronic condition.
