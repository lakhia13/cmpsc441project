Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to traits concerned with happiness, fulﬁllment and
enrichment and is a substantial predictor of a ﬂourishing life. Interest in the promotion
of well-being has blossomed in recent years, and it is widely reported that positive
psychological
interventions (PPIs) can effectively improve SWB. However, to date,
the neural correlates of PPIs remain elusive. Since previous research has suggested
foundation for potential working
that emotion regulation might be the theoretical
mechanisms, here we used electroencephalography (EEG)
techniques to identify
whether the intentional increase of subjective well-being through PPIs was associated
with greater tonic left frontal activation. Fifty-ﬁve students met the inclusion criteria and
were allocated to a randomized controlled trial that was single blinded. The intervention
group received PPIs once a week for 10 weeks (n = 28). Meanwhile, students in
a placebo control group (CG, n = 27) were asked to write down early memories
every day for 10 weeks and were invited to share voluntarily at the weekly meeting.
Measures of subjective well-being, depression and anxiety were assessed at pre-test
and post-test. Forty-eight students completed the post-test, and the collected data
were analyzed across time (PPIs, n = 25; CG, n = 23). It was found that students
undergoing the 10-week PPIs reported larger improvement in SWB, and greater relief
in self-rated depression and anxiety from pre-intervention to post-intervention than did
those in the control group. As expected, in conjunction with the promotion of subjective
well-being and the amelioration of emotional distress from pre- to post-treatment in the
intervention group, a signiﬁcantly increased coefﬁcient of frontal alpha EEG asymmetry
was found. In summary, these ﬁndings suggest that adaptive emotion regulation, which
is characteristic of greater tonic left frontal activation, reﬂects the efﬁciency of PPIs and
highlights the frontal alpha EEG asymmetry as a neural substrate linking PPIs and mental
health.

Neural Correlates of Well-Being Intervention

INTRODUCTION

Recent years have seen a blossoming interest in the ﬁeld of
human subjective well-being (SWB). SWB refers to a broad
category of phenomena that include people’s evaluations of their
lives (e.g., “life is satisfactory”) and emotional responses (e.g.,
“I am happy”) (1). As a predominant positive psychological
component, subjective well-being is considered to play a critical
role in fostering the quality of people’s social lives (1). According
to Shin et al. (2), positive aﬀect contributed to the promotion
of peer acceptance, teacher-assessed adaptation, and initiating
positive relationships with peers among children. As is revealed
by Boehm and Lyubomirsky (3), the most popular and likable
people are usually those more happier ones. In addition, there
are a number of studies on the predictive power of SWB on
health and longevity (4). For example, Xu and Roberts studied
6,856 participants from Alameda Countyin California over a
period of 28 years (1966 to 1993). The results indicated that
positive aﬀects, satisfaction with life, and domain satisfactions are
correlated with lower risk of all-cause and natural cause mortality
(risk ratios from 0.90 to 0.99). Unnatural-cause mortality can
also be predicted by positive aﬀects and satisfaction with life (risk
ratios from 0.86 to 0.96) (5). Just as Diener proposed, “subjective
well-being is not only a desirable outcome but can also be an
important predictor of future life outcomes” (1).

Considering the beneﬁcial eﬀects of SWB,

intentionally
cultivating SWB through well-being interventions can therefore
serve as an antidote to negative emotions and motivates people
to seek for rewards in their lives (6). In addition, the frequency
of negative aﬀect, behaviors, and thoughts, which are typical
features of various risk factors leading to psychopathology,
will thus be reduced (7). An ideal way to increase well-being
is by means of positive psychological interventions (PPIs) (8,
9). According to Layous et al. “PPIs are treatment methods
or intentional activities that aim to cultivate positive feelings,
behaviors, or cognitions” (7). They are simple and easy to
use, and most are self-administered, with participants accepting
uniﬁed and normalized training instructions and performing
the activities themselves (7). These intentional activities include:
writing about three good things that happened each day, making a
gratitude visit or writing letters of gratitude, identifying signature
strengths and using them in a new way (10), expressing gratefulness
for life’s blessings that people experience each day (11), and
imagining the best possible self (12), etc. All of these exercises
underline the cultivation of personal character strengths shared
by individuals with a high level of well-being (such as three
good things [the strength of hope], gratitude visit [the strength
of gratitude] and counting kindness [the strength of kindness])
(13). These diverse PPIs strategies have shown beneﬁcial eﬀects
on subjective well-being in general (14, 15) and on symptoms of
various mental disorders (16, 17).

The beneﬁcial eﬀects of PPIs are well recognized and
certiﬁed, while more work needs to be done on the underlying
mechanisms of PPIs, particularly the supporting empirical
evidence. Considering the improvement in emotional status is
one of the most noteworthy beneﬁts of PPIs. It is argued by
some researchers (18) that the cultivation of adaptive emotional

regulation plays the key role in health promotion; and in
their reports, emotion regulation strategies are proposed as the
theoretical foundation of possible working mechanisms, which
contain “situation selection, situation modiﬁcation, attentional
deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation” (19).
A recent study conducted by Wellenzohn et al. (20) tested the
proposed mechanisms. In this study, a random division was
made among 695 adults, and all the participants were randomly
assigned to one of “three funny things” intervention group, which
needed they write down three funny things every day in a way
to center on the present, the past, or the future, respectively, or a
placebo control group (i.e., early memories exercises). The results
indicated that the intervention could increase participants’ well-
being and decrease depression signiﬁcantly. Moreover, compared
with the placebo control group, the intervention groups were
more capable in boosting savoring and turning the attentional
deployment to the positive (20). This initial study provides the
ﬁrst support for the proposed working mechanisms of eﬀective
PPIs. However, studies of the neural correlates of PPIs are remain
elusive.

Extensive electroencephalography (EEG) research has shown
that emotion-related traits and states are associated with frontal
EEG asymmetry and the manipulation of an individual’s anterior
alpha EEG asymmetry is associated with later emotion regulation
and emotion perception (21). For example, Jackson and his
colleagues based on 47 adults suggested that greater left superior
frontal activation at pre-test was correlated with a lower startle
magnitude after the oﬀset of negative stimulus (22). In another
EEG study (23), biofeedback training was randomly given to
18 right-handed female participants, which were designed to
increase right frontal alpha relative to left frontal alpha (Group
A) or in the opposite direction (Group B); before and after
the 5-week intervention, three short emotionally evocative silent
ﬁlms (happy, neutral, and sad) were presented. The results
demonstrated that participants in group B reported more positive
emotions when they watched the happy ﬁlms and expressed less
corrugator activation when they watched the sad ﬁlms (23).

Although a recent EEG study had found that there was a
positive correlation between left-sided frontal activation and the
levels of SWB (24), it is not clear whether the intentionally
increase of subjective well-being through PPIs was associated
with greater tonic left frontal activation. To address this gap in
the literature, here we examined the frontal alpha activities before
and after PPIs, and we hypothesized that the PPIs might boost an
individual’s mental well-being to the extent of the improvement
of ability to properly regulate emotions, which manifested as an
increased coeﬃcient of frontal alpha EEG asymmetry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants
The study was advertised via a recruitment notice advertisement
posted around a medical university. Medical students were
chosen because they were believed a more “at risk population”
for mental disorders (25). After applying for the training,
participants were asked to ﬁll out the screening questionnaires
(n = 116). We applied the following inclusion criteria: (a) not

the

(c) being

(b) not participating in any other psychological

right-handed
study,
individuals, (d) having no history of neurological or psychiatric
problems, and (e) having normal visual acuity or corrected
visual acuity. Students who met all the inclusion criteria were
then oﬀered detailed information about the research target
and process. Written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects before the intervention. The Satisfaction with Life
Scale (SWLS), the Positive Aﬀect, and Negative Aﬀect Schedule
(PANAS), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
Scale (CES-D), and the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) were
adopted to assess their levels of subjective well-being, depression
and anxiety.

Following the provision of signed consent and the completion
of the screening questionnaires and pre-assessment, participants
(n = 56) who met all the inclusion criteria were randomly
assigned to the intervention condition (n = 28) or to the placebo
control condition (n = 28) by an online true random-number
service independent of the investigators. The regional ethics
committee of Army Military Medical University approved this
consent procedure and the study protocol.

Procedure
Participants in the intervention group and the control group
received strength-based PPIs or the placebo interventions,
respectively. To certify the beneﬁcial eﬀects of PPIs on subjective
well-being, self-report measures were conducted on the internet
before and immediately after the interventions. The programme
was set as an optional course named “Psychology and Life” so
that the delivery of the programme could ﬁt within the school
term and study objectives. Both ten-session interventions were
administered in group format by three school psychologists.
Although the procedure requires skilful manipulation and was
not blinded to the practitioners, students were blinded to the
group allocation; thus, the study was a randomized single-blinded
control trial.

In addition, students were asked to undergo EEG recordings
before and after training (see ﬂow chart in Figure 1). For the
EEG assessment, students were instructed to sit in a sound-
attenuated room and to keep two 2-min intervals for eyes open
and for eyes closed respectively in a counterbalanced order across
participants. In the eyes open intervals, participants need to have
their eyes ﬁxed on a white cross, which was displayed in the center
of a computer monitor.

The Well-Being Intervention
Weekly sessions for 10 consecutive weeks were oﬀered. The
ﬁrst session consisted of an introduction to the intervention
purpose,
in addition to some activities designed to help to
enhance participants’ interactions and establish a friendly and
supportive group environment. Sessions two through nine were
structured as 3 parts in line with Seligman’s framework (10) and
with Suldo’s (26) intervention procedures for boosting well-being
through intentional activities, consisting of increasing 1. grateful
expressions for past events (sessions 2 and 3), 2. satisfaction
by means of creative use of signiﬁcant character strengths

(sessions 4, 5, and 6), and 3. positive future-oriented emotions
by cultivating a hopeful, optimistic and goal-directed thinking
habit (sessions 7, 8, and 9) (26). The last session was centered on
reﬂecting on the practice of learned skills in daily life, including a
review of activities and the theoretical framework for increasing
well-being. In brief, this 10-week, 2-h-per-week intervention
consisted of the following exercises: introduction to gratitude
and gratitude letter-writing, gratitude visit, acts of kindness (27),
identifying signature strengths (10), use of signature strengths
in new ways and savoring (10), stopping worrying (28), three
good things, and the best possible self (12), in addition to an
introductory (the ﬁrst meeting) and concluding session (the last
meeting) (see Supplementary Table 1).

Positive Interpretations of Past Events
The crucial purpose of sessions 2 and 3 was to cultivate a gratitude
framework for the explanation of past events. A gratitude-related
video was shown as a method of revealing the importance of
expressing gratitude and guiding students to understand the
correlation between gratitude and well-being. The exercises of
the gratitude letter and gratitude visit were administered to focus
participants’ thoughts on grateful people and events, and to
increase the experience of gratitude and subjective well-being
by strengthening the association between thoughts, feelings, and
actions (26). Students were asked to Àcompose a gratitude letter
and send the letter to someone (far away from them) whom are
extremely grateful, but whom they have never properly thanked;
Ávisit someone near them who is extremely compassionate.The
students were encouraged to share the experience of their
gratitude practice at the next session.

Positive Experience of Present Events
“Act of kindness,” “identify signature character strengths,” and
“use signature character strengths creatively” were collected into
this topic to promote engagement and satisfaction in daily
life. The acts of kindness exercise required that participants do
something good (that is, to practice beneﬁcence) and to record
the experience (27). From the perspective of emotion regulation,
this could inﬂuence the students’ choices of what situations
they might enter and further aﬀect the resulting emotional
experience. In addition, participants were invited to identify their
signature character strengths through the online Values in Action
Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth) (29), and to try to
use their top 5 signature strengths in new and diﬀerent ways. To
intensify and savor the experience of ﬂow and satisfaction derived
from this activity, the students were required to record the feeling
of creatively using these top strengths every day for 1 week.

Positive Framework of Future Events
The main aim of sessions 7–9 was to cultivate a positive
framework for consideration of future events. The worry journals
were used to change students’ existing irrational or negative
beliefs and to build reasonable cognition. Students were asked
to report the records of “the things you worry about” that they
had written down previously and to count how many of these
concerns had truly happened (28). The exercise of three good
things was intended to develop learned optimism. According

to Seligman (10), the act of recording 3 pleasant things was
capable of helping participants develop positive attitudes and
get into the habit of being aware of the bright aspects of
surrounding events, which enabled individuals to stay open-
minded in a dilemma and eﬀectively address the predicament.
The “best possible self ” exercise (12) required students to set
a short-term goal and make a practical plan to achieve the

goal; according to Snyder’s hope theory, the detailed plan must
contain Àpossible obstructions; Ápaths to overcome diﬃculties
and Âmotivations for success. In addition to promoting the
students’ feeling of hope and their resulting sense of well-being,
detailed goal mapping could reduce the uncertainty of the future,
which was the main risk factor leading to anxiety disorders
(30).

The Placebo Control Condition
Participants in the control group received no instruction for the
intervention programme. Instead, they were asked to write down
something from their early memories every day for 10 weeks and
were invited to share voluntarily at the weekly meeting.

2)according to Cohen (36) were calculated for estimating

(ηp
eﬀect sizes.

The purpose of these analyses was to determine the beneﬁts of
the intervention on students’ well-being, depression and anxiety
in the two conditions.

Self-Report Measures and Analyses
The intervention was assessed in terms of related changes with
the participants’ subjective well-being, as well as in terms of
traditional negative indicators of mental health (i.e., depression
and anxiety), so that the secondary eﬀects of the intervention on
psychopathology could be explored.

Subjective Well-Being
Subjective well-being (SWB) is abroad concept that includes
experiencing more positive emotions, a high degree of
satisfaction with life and low levels of negative moods (31).
A measure of SWB was then constructed with the Positive Aﬀect
and Negative Aﬀect Schedule (PANAS) (32) and with the SWLS
(33) (i.e., PA+SWLS–NA). The PANAS has 20 adjectives that
indicate positive and negative aﬀect. A ﬁve-point Likert scale
ranging from 1(very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) was
used to evaluate participants′ mood state during a certain time
frame. The internal consistency coeﬃcient of the positive aﬀect
subscale and the negative aﬀect subscale for our sample were
0.86 and 0.83, respectively. The SWLS is a 5-item self-report
questionnaire. Participants need to evaluate the degree to which
they agree or disagree with items such as “In most ways my life
is close to my ideal” on a seven-point Likert scale range from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The internal consistency
coeﬃcient of SWLS for our sample was 0.96.

Mental Health
Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (34). Subjects are invited to
rate the frequency of occurrence of the symptoms from 0 to 3
(0–occasionally or never, 1—sometimes, 2—often or half of the
time, and 3—mostly or continuously). Total scores ranged from
0 to 60, with lower scores indicating less depression. The internal
consistency coeﬃcient for our sample was 0.91.

The SAI (35) was administered to assess anxiety. SAI is a
20-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure certain
subjective feelings such as nervousness, worries, and fear at
present or during a speciﬁc period of time. Each question is rated
on a four-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 4 = very much so),
with total scores ranging from 20 to 80. The Cronbach alpha
estimate for our sample was 0.85.

Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted using SPSS19.0.
Independent
samples t-tests and Chi-square tests were conducted to explore
the homogeneity of the intervention group and the control
group. We conducted repeated measures ANOVA on outcome
measures with test time as a within-group factor and condition
as a between-group factor. A p-value of < 0.05 with an α-level
of 5% was set for statistical signiﬁcance. Partial η-square values

EEG Recording, Reduction, and Analysis
Tin electrodes attached to a stretch-lycra electrode cap were used
to record EEG for an 8-min resting period consisting of two
eyes-open parts and two eyes-closed parts with a counterbalanced
sequence, each 2 min in length. Horizontal electro-oculographic
activity was recorded from the epicanthus of each eye and
vertical from the supra-and infra-orbital positions of the right
eye. Continuous EEG data were collected through a 64-
channel NuAmp acquisition system (Neuroscan Inc.) using the
International 10–20 system, with a reference at Cz and the area
between Fz and Fpz as the ground. All electrode impedances
were below 5 kΩ. Oﬄine, a digital average mastoid reference,
(M1+M2)/2, was performed.

After the raw EEG data were manually scored for eye
movement and muscle artifact, the EEG was reconstructed into
non-overlapping epochs of 2 s. After artifact detection, for each
channel of each participant, the power spectrum was derived
from the Fast Fourier Transform and Hamming window every
2 s in each baseline type (eyes open, eyes closed); thus, each 2 min
baseline type contained 60 non-overlapping 2-s epoch, and EEG
ﬁndings were speciﬁc to both open and closed eyes. The average
power spectrum for each 2-min period was obtained. The total
power in the alpha band (8–13 Hz) was extracted and were then
averaged across minutes. In order to obtain normalized data, the
power values were natural logarithm (ln) transformed. A measure
of frontal EEG asymmetry (i.e., ln [right]–ln [left]) was then
derived for the homologous scalp site of interest. Since alpha
power is usually considered as inversely proportional to cortical
activity, lower value of the index reﬂects the less left side activity
(37).

RESULTS

Descriptive Statistics
Figure 1 presents the subjects’ ﬂow chart. Among all
the
participants, 116 (47 female, mean age = 21.63 ± 3.14) applied
for the training. Of the students, 55 were eligible to join in
the research and were randomly allocated into the treatment
and placebo control groups. Post-test follow-up failed to be
made in 7 students causing a 12.73% drop-out rate. Table 1
shows students’ demographic data. According to the results of
independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests, no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the demographic variables was found.

Changes in Self-Report Measures
In Table 2, the baseline value of the self-report measures for
the intervention group and placebo control group are depicted.
No signiﬁcant group diﬀerences at pretest were found on any
measure.

the intervention participants reported statistically signiﬁcant
decreases in depression and anxiety from T1 to T2, while no
signiﬁcant change was observed in the control group.

Repeated measurement ANOVA results are detailed in

based PPIs could contribute to promoting an increase in the
individuals’ well-being and mitigating mental distress.

Change of Frontal Alpha EEG Asymmetry
The means and standard deviations of the following four alpha
asymmetry scores in the PPIs and CG before and after the
intervention are presented in Table 2: lateral frontal (F8-F7),
frontal (F4-F3), fronto-central (FC4-FC3, FC6-FC5) (38). Using
the t-test, alpha EEG asymmetry baseline measures were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the intervention group and the
control group. Repeated measurement ANOVA results were
detailed in Table 3. Results indicated that there was no main
eﬀect of time and no main group eﬀect. Signiﬁcant time (T1 and
T2) by group (PPIs and CG) interactions were found for F4-F3
alpha asymmetry and FC4-FC3 alpha asymmetry. Further simple
eﬀect analysis indicated signiﬁcant training eﬀects at post test for
2 = 0.09] and
F4-F3 alpha asymmetry [F(1, 46) = 4.51, p = 0.04, ηp
2 = 0.16],
FC4-FC3 alpha asymmetry [F(1, 46) = 8.49, p = 0.01, ηp
with a more positive asymmetry score in the intervention group.

Correlations Between Frontal EEG
Asymmetry Change and Behavioral

According to Table 4, the control group exhibited no signiﬁcant
correlations between behavioral changes and EEG changes.
However, signiﬁcant correlations were found between changes of
self-reported outcome measures (i.e., subjective well-being and
anxiety) and changes of frontal alpha asymmetry (i.e., F4-F3 and
FC6-FC5) in the intervention group. In addition, the PPIs sample

all students, changes of F4-F3, F8-F7, FC4-FC3, and FC6-FC5
frontal EEG asymmetry were negatively related to changes of
CES-D and SAI scores (only the correlation with change of F4–F3

DISCUSSION

This study aimed to explore the impact of the PPIs, compare
with a placebo control, upon subjective well-being and emotional
distress, as well as on the corresponding neural electrical changes.
Self-reported results showed that the intervention had signiﬁcant
eﬀects on subjective well-being, depression, and anxiety. First,
the data indicated that students participating in the10-week PPIs
reported a greater increase in subjective well-being compared to
the control participants. Over the 3 months, subjective well-being
increased immediately at post-test in the intervention condition,
while no signiﬁcant change was found in the placebo control
group. The results parallel the positive correlation documented
between well-being and coping capacity and resilience (39) and

suggest us that through school interventions, the promoting
of well-being could thus improve students’ mental toughness,
coping styles, and developmental processes (40). Moreover, Ryﬀ
et al. proposed that well-being has a meaningful defensive
function in aspect of sensitivity to chronic and acute life stresses
(41). Consistent with this, participants in the intervention group
showed greater relief in depression and anxiety relative to
students in the placebo control group from pre- to post-test. The
observed eﬀects are worth noting as medical students tend to
experience more distress in the middle of the semester, during
which exams and assignments come in great number (42). The
results thus certify the viewpoint that the PPIs can play an
important role if conducted in the middle or the end of the
semester, when students are in a more vulnerable psychological
state (43).

improvement of human subjective well-being,

Although much attention has been directed toward
the
the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying
these well-being
interventions remain elusive. On the base of Gross’s emotion
regulation-model, Quoidbach et al. (18) frame diﬀerent kinds
of PPIs and suggested emotion regulation strategies to be the
theoretical foundation for potential working mechanisms (20).
Based on this, the current study proposed that PPIs might
promote a participant’s mental well-being to the extent that
the ability to properly regulate emotions improved, which was
manifested as an increased coeﬃcient of frontal alpha EEG
asymmetry. The results align with the initial hypothesis: In
conjunction with the promotion of subjective well-being and the
amelioration of emotional distress from pre- to post-treatment in
the intervention group, obvious electrocortical changes occurred
typically with a shift to the greater rest left frontal alpha EEG
asymmetry.

According to Beck’s generic cognitive model

(GCM),
individuals with emotional distress are tend to pay more
attention to mood—congruent stimuli (44), which facilitates
biased interpretation and biased memory, this, in turn, leads to
the formation of biased cognitive processing schemas or beliefs
(45). In addition, the activated schema could initiate further
aﬀective, motivational, and behavioral responses and trigger the
downward spirals to mental disorders (39). Previous research
has proposed that momentary thought–action repertoires

will be broaden by positive emotions, which could widen the
thoughts and actions that pass through the mind (6), and thereby
promoting more creative and ﬂexible cognitive associations
and appraisals to face emotional situations (46), and create
the urge to sit back and enjoy current life circumstances or
stimulate people to act and approach rewards in their lives (24).
Since the way in which we consider and reﬂect to the world
shapes what we experience, the broadened attention to positive
information, a more ﬂexible cognitive association and active
coping strategies toward improved well-being (6) could have
an adaptive emotion-regulating eﬀect in everyday emotional
situations; this would enable people to place the life events in
a broader context, reducing the adverse eﬀects of any typical
negative event, and thus, countering the downward spirals of
negativity (6, 39).

Moreover, beneﬁting from the scope of attention and
cognition broadened by positive emotions, peoples’
lasting
coping resources would also be augmented through enhancing
ﬂexible and creative thinking ability (6); such resources would
include lasting social bonds and attachments prompted by
play, enduring physical resources promoted by exploring, and
improved self-insight and advanced world view prompted by
savoring (6).With regards to our intervention, the positive
activities such as the gratitude visit, which asked participants to
express their appreciation to someone who had done something
good for them, or the act of kindness, which required the
students to perform a good work and record their feelings,
could strengthen interpersonal relationships and optimize their
social support networks. When people later faced threatening
situations, these greater personal resources would have translated
into more adaptive strategies, and in turn, more rational
emotional and behavioral responses (6, 39, 45). This virtuous
circle could contribute to triggering upward spirals of well-
being toward greater adaptation and mental health (39, 47).
Taken together, the prefrontal activation in the intervention
group is identiﬁed to activate the regulatory structures ascribing
to the broader, ﬂexible and positive attentional, cognitive, and
behavioral repertories.

Some limitations of the current study should be mentioned.
One point of concern is the small sample size. The ﬁndings were
based on 48 medical students, which possibly undermined the
signiﬁcance of several interactive and simple eﬀects, so a larger
sampling is needed to replicate these results in future studies.
Second, the dropout rate in this study was 12.73%; in order to
increase the overall response rate and keep students motivated
to remain in the study, upcoming studies might oﬀer more
ways to include more students, such as monetary incentives or
credits reward. Another limitation of this study is its single-blind
nature. A large population study that is blind to both participants
and practitioners and long-term follow-up must be considered.
Finally, in addition to recording the frontal alpha activity at rest
before and after the well-being intervention, future studies should
detect participants’ continuous brain electrical activities as they
process emotional stimuli; this could help uncover the possible
eﬀects of subjective well-being on diﬀerent stages of emotion
regulation, such as initial attentional bias, later cognitive process,
and behavioral responses.

CONCLUSION

Above all, the data from this study have shown that strength-
based PPIs can eﬀectively improve young adults’ subjective well-
being and mitigate the symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Crucially, the process of adaptive emotion regulation might
be the potential mechanisms by which PPIs brought beneﬁts.
Our ﬁndings may have clinical
implications for providing
potential biomarkers for the early prevention of mental disorders.
Furthermore, beyond psychological interventions related to well-
being, the neurofeedback training of subjective well-being can be
developed to improve levels of health.
