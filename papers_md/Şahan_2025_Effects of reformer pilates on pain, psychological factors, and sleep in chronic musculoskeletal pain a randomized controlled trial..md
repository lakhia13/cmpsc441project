Abstract
Background  Musculoskeletal disorders that follow a chronic course are associated with many symptoms, the most 
striking one is chronic pain that gradually worsens. The aim of this randomized controlled and single- center study 
was to investigate the effect of Reformer Pilates exercises on pain severity, pain coping methods, pain beliefs, fear of 
movement, fatigue and sleep quality in young adult patients with chronic low back pain and neck pain.

Methods  A total of 54 women aged between 30 and 50 were randomized into two groups. The Reformer Pilates (RP) 
group received a 6-week exercise program (45 min/twice per week), while the control group (CG) didn’t receive any 
exercise program. Outcomes measured before and after the interventions were, Brief Pain Questionnaire, Pain Coping 
Scale, Pain Beliefs Scale, Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, FACIT Fatigue Scale and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index.

Results  The groups were homogeneous at baseline. Statistical differences were found in favour of RP with small 
to large effect size in pain parameters (p < 0.05; Cohen’s d = 0.17–1.45), large effect size in fear of movement, small 
effect size in fatigue and medium effect size in sleep quality (p < 0.05; Cohen’s d = 0.43–0.86). No statistical difference 
between the groups was observed only in the pain beliefs organic sub-heading of the Pain Beliefs Scale and in the 
passive strategies sub-headings of the Pain Coping Scale (p > 0.05).

Discussion  The results of the current study suggest that Reformer Pilates increased active living in patients with 
chronic low back pain and chronic neck pain engenders a comprehensive enhancement in both physical and mental 
health, in addition to the capacity of patients to proactively manage their condition.

RESEARCHOpen AccessBackground
Musculoskeletal  disorders  are  a  global  health  problem 
causing heavy economic burden due to their widespread 
prevalence and leading to significant health problems [1, 
2]. Musculoskeletal disorders that follow a chronic course 
are  associated  with  many  symptoms,  the  most  striking 
one  is  chronic  pain  that  gradually  worsens  [3].  Chronic 
pain is generally described as ongoing or recurrent pain 
that continues for more than three months, distinguish-
ing  it  from  acute  pain  conditions  [4].  It  often  continues 
even in the absence of peripheral pain stimuli due to syn-
aptic plasticity and neural network restructuring at vari-
ous levels of the nervous system—a phenomenon known 
as pain centralization [5].

Epidemiological  studies  report  that  approximately 
one in nine young adults suffers from chronic pain, with 
prevalence  rates  ranging  from  5  to  30%  in  this  popula-
tion  and  more  common  in  the  female  population  [6,  7]. 
The most prevalent types of musculoskeletal pain include 
neck  pain,  osteoarthritis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and 
chronic low back pain [8]. In Turkey, low back, neck, and 
upper  back  pain—also  the  focus  of  the  present  study—
are  reported  as  the  most  prevalent  forms  of  musculo-
skeletal pain [1]. Recent studies have found that chronic 
musculoskeletal pain is not only physically disabling but 
is also associated with numerous somatic comorbidities, 
anxiety,  depression,  fearful  beliefs  about  the  meaning  of 
pain, poor coping skills, catastrophizing, work avoidance 
behavior, stress, increased use of health services, insom-
nia, and unemployment [9, 10]. Considering the complex 
and  multifactorial  nature  of  chronic  pain,  multimodal 
and biopsychosocial approaches are more recommended 
in its management [11, 12].

Data from several studies suggest that, resistance exer-
cise  training  and  flexibility  exercises  performed  at  least 
twice  a  week  are  recommended  in  international  treat-
ment  guidelines  for  the  management  of  musculoskeletal 
pain in terms of preservation of functional status, promo-
tion of lifelong physical activity and improvement of gen-
eral quality of life [2, 13].

Over the past 20 years, Pilates has grown in popularity 
and recommendation as a form of physical exercise glob-
ally, despite the abundance of physical activity programs 
[14].  Pilates  consists  of  over  fifty  exercises  of  varying 
degrees of difficulty. Exercise programs can therefore be 
tailored to individuals with varying demands, tastes, ail-
ments, ages, and abilities. Controlled movement patterns 
and  elastic  resistance  applications  improve  neuromus-
cular  control,  core  stability  and  dynamic  balance.  These 
components are often impaired, especially in individuals 
with chronic back and neck pain [15, 16]. More effective 
activation and coordination of the trunk muscles contrib-
ute to better proprioception and spinal stabilization [16].

Additionally, the benefits of Pilates exercises are notice-
able  in  a  short  period  of  time,  they  motivate  people  to 
stick  to  their  training  regimens  and  alter  their  behavior 
permanently to lead more active lives [18, 19]. Exercises 
can be performed on a mat and also using special Cadil-
lac,  Reformer  and  Wundachair  equipment  [20].  Pilates 
is  a  mind–body  exercise  system  grounded  in  six  core 
principles:  concentration,  movement  control,  center-
ing, fluidity, precision, and breath. It is designed to pro-
mote  physical  fitness  and  mental  discipline  by  fostering 
harmony  between  the  body  and  the  mind  [14,  21].  This 
allows for reduced stress and anxiety and increased psy-
chological  resilience  in  coping  with  pain.  In  these  ways, 
Pilates  can  also  offer  psychological  benefits  similar  to 
mindfulness-based interventions [22, 23].

Although  Reformer  Pilates  exercises  have  become 
increasingly  popular  in  recent  years,  the  findings  of 
existing  studies  remain  inconsistent  [17–19,  24].  There-
fore,  the  present  study  aims  to  investigate  the  effects  of 
Reformer  Pilates  on  various  dimensions  of  pain  per-
intensity,  coping  strategies, 
ception—including  pain 
pain-related  beliefs,  and  fear  of  movement—as  well  as 
on fatigue and sleep quality in young adult women with 
chronic musculoskeletal pain.

The findings are expected to contribute to the growing 
body of literature on exercise-based, holistic approaches 
to chronic pain management.

Methods
The  present  study,  designed  to  examine  the  effects  of 
Reformer Pilates on pain intensity, pain coping strategies, 
pain-related  beliefs,  kinesiophobia,  fatigue,  and  sleep 
quality in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, 
was conducted between March 1 and October 7, 2024.

Sample

The randomize controlled trial included 60 patients aged 
between  30  and  50  years,  referred  to  the  physiotherapy 
and rehabilitation department by a physician and deemed 
suitable  for  the  Reformer  Pilates  program.  Inclusion 
criteria  included  female  individuals  with  a  diagnosis  of 
chronic  musculoskeletal  pain  that  persisted  for  at  least 
six  months.  In  terms  of  having  a  history  of  mechanical 
pain, the inclusion criteria were that the pain was charac-
terized as increasing with physical exertion and decreas-
ing  with  rest.  Other  inclusion  criteria  were  that  the 
participants  had  the  cognitive  ability  to  understand  the 
exercise instructions, were able to comply with the inter-
vention protocol and gave informed consent.

Exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of low back or neck 
pain  due  to  a  serious  underlying  disease  such  as  cancer 
or  radiculopathy,  or  other  causes  such  as  fibromyalgia; 
spinal  surgery  within  the  last  six  months;  a  history  of 
emotional problems and psychiatric disorders or known 
cognitive  impairment  that  interfered  with  communica-
tion; and participation in an exercise or physical therapy 
program during the last three months.

The  control  group  consisted  of  patients  waiting  for 
treatment  without  any  intervention  method.  Individuals 
were  assigned  to  the  study  (Reformer  Pilates)  group  or 
the control group by simple randomization.

Study design

The  study  group  (the  Reformer  Pilates  group)  under-
went  a  6-week  exercise  regimen. The  control  group  was 
made up of inactive female volunteers who were waiting 
to begin Reformer Pilates workouts; no exercise regimen 
was  used.  Evaluations  were  conducted  both  before  and 
after the 6-week exercise program in the research group 
(Reformer Pilates group) and the control group.

The  study’s  power  analysis  was  conducted  using  the 
G*power 3.1.9.7, with alpha and beta errors set at 5% and 
20%, respectively. Based on the study of Natour et al. [26] 
(effcet size = 0.77), it was determined that 54 samples (27 
experimental and 27 control groups) would be sufficient. 
To account for the possibility of patients dropping out of 
the study, we added 3 participants to each group and ini-
tially evaluated 60 patients.

Randomization

Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention 
(Reformer  Pilates)  and  control  groups  using  simple  ran-
domization with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The randomization 
sequence  was  generated  in  advance  by  an  independent 
researcher using a computer-assisted randomization tool 
(www.randomizer.org) to minimize selection bias. Blind-
ing  of  participants  and  the  treating  physiotherapist  was 
not  possible  given  the  study’s  design.  However,  to  mini-
mize  bias,  all  outcome  assessments  were  performed  by 

an  independent  physiotherapist  blinded  to  group  allo-
cation.  Furthermore,  data  analysis  was  carried  out  by 
a  researcher  who  was  not  involved  in  the  intervention 
implementation or outcome assessments.

Reformer pilates exercise training protocol

Reformer Pilates exercises focusing on core strength, spi-
nal  mobility,  postural  control,  flexibility,  and  muscular 
endurance. Reformer Pilates exercise protocol was deter-
mined according to previous clinical studies in the litera-
ture [16, 27]. For six weeks, the exercises were done twice 
a week for 45 to 50 min each time. Firstly, the Reformer 
machine and its operation were demonstrated to all par-
ticipants.  The  individuals  were  given  an  explanation  of 
the Pilates method’s core concepts of centering, concen-
tration,  breathing,  control,  flow,  and  precision.  Lateral 
breathing,  neutral  spine,  and  pelvic  floor  exercises  were 
described  and  shown.  Stretching  exercises  took  up  the 
opening  and  last  five  minutes  of  the  sessions.  Three  to 
five  repetitions  of  stretching  exercises  were  performed 
first,  followed  by  six  to  eight  repetitions  of  strengthen-
ing  and  stabilizing  activities.  Repetitions  were  gradually 
increased to 10–12 on a weekly basis, depending on each 
participant’s  tolerance.  The  individual  exercise  toler-
ance of the participants was determined based on verbal 
feedback  from  the  participant,  such  as  pain  and  fatigue, 
or  symptoms  observed  by  the  physiotherapist,  such  as 
difficulties  in  performing  the  movement  and  compensa-
tory  movements.  Repetitions  were  increased  when  the 
participant  was  able  to  perform  the  exercise  correctly 
without  any  unfavorable  conditions  (e.g.,  pain,  fatigue). 
Springs were included according on the workouts’ objec-
tives  and  degree  of  difficulty.  Higher  resistance  springs 
were  used  for  strengthening  and  stabilization  exercises, 
while  lighter  resistance  springs  were  used  for  stretching 
activities.  As  with  increasing  the  number  of  repetitions, 
the use of springs was individually regulated according to 
the participant’s verbal feedback (such as pain, fatigue or 
increased  pain  after  the  previous  session)  and  the  phys-
iotherapist’s observation (such as the participant’s ability 
to  perform  the  movement  correctly  and  with  ease).  To 
ensure that the exercises were performed correctly, each 
movement  was  demonstrated  and  explained  individu-
ally. For breathing control and centering, verbal cautions 
were issued. Pilates workouts included posture exercises, 
standing  hip  stretching,  elephant  stretching,  long  box 
series,  plank,  knee  stretch,  back  extensor  strengthening, 
footwork series, supine armwork, and feet in straps (Sup-
plementary Materials). The Reformer Pilates intervention 
was delivered by an expert physiotherapist with 5 years of 
clinical experience and certified training in Pilates-based 
exercise.  All  Reformer  Pilates  applications  were  applied 
individually.  The  6-week  Reformer  Pilates  program 
was  carried  out  in  a  controlled  and  professional  clinical

reinjury and fear-avoidance in work-related activities are 
two of the scale’s parameters. The 17-item likert scale has 
four points: 1 for strongly disagreeing and 4 for strongly 
agreeing.  A  total  score  is  determined  after  the  fourth, 
eighth,  twelfth,  and  sixteenth  elements  are  reversed. 
A  high  degree  of  kinesiophobia  is  indicated  by  a  high 
score  on  the  scale.  In  the  studies,  using  the  total  score 
is advised. Yılmaz et al. conducted a study on the scale’s 
reliability and validity in Turkish [33].

Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Therapy 
(FACIT)  Fatigue  Scale  is  a  scale  developed  to  measure 
the fatigue level of individuals in the last week. The scale 
consists of 13 items. It is a 4-point Likert-type scale with 
1 = not at all and 4 = very much. Total score 0–52. A total 
score  below  30  indicates  severe  fatigue.  The  higher  the 
score, the less tired the person is and the better the qual-
ity of life. It was developed by Webster et al. in 2003 [34].
Pittsburg  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI)  is  a  scale  used 
to  assess  the  quality  and  disruption  of  sleep  throughout 
the previous month. The scale has a total of 19 items and 
7 sub-items, which include subjective sleep quality, sleep 
latency,  duration,  habitual  sleep  efficiency,  sleep  disrup-
tions, use of sleep aids, and loss of daily functioning. Each 
item is scored between 0 and 3. A total PSQI score rang-
ing  from  0  to  21  is  obtained  by  summing  the  subscales 
[35].  The  scale’s  validity  and  reliability  in  Turkish  were 
investigated by Ağargün et al. [36].

Statistical analysis

As a result of the assessments given to the study partici-
pants, descriptive statistics and analyses were conducted. 
Frequency and percentage were used as descriptive statis-
tics  for  categorical  variables,  or  demographic  traits. The 
“Shapiro-Wilk Test” was used to control for the variables’ 
conformance  to  a  normal  distribution.  The  variables’ 
descriptive  statistics  were  presented  as  mean ± standard 
deviation (X ̅±SD) values. Two independent groups hav-
ing a normal distribution were compared using the “two-
sample  t-test,”  while  two  independent  groups  without  a 
normal  distribution  were  compared  using  the  “Mann-
Whitney  U  Test.”  Two  dependent  groups  with  a  normal 
distribution  were  compared  using  the  "  paired  t-test” 
while  two  dependent  groups  without  a  normal  distribu-
tion  were  compared  using  the  “Wilcoxon  Signed  Rank 
Test.”  Effect  sizes  were  categorized  as  small  (0.20–0.50), 
medium (0.51–0.80), and large (> 0.80), following Cohen’s 
guidelines  [37].  The  minimum  significance  level  was 
taken  as  0.05  for  all  analyses.  Statistical  analysis  of  the 
data was performed using SPSS v26 (IBM Inc., Chicago, 
IL, USA) statistical package program.

Department  of  the  Private  Middle  East  Hospital.  There 
were  no  intervention-related  adverse  events  during  the 
study.

Outcome measures

All study participants were asked for demographic data, 
including  age,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  education  level, 
pain duration and diagnosis.

Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was developed by Cleeland 
and Ryan in 1994 [28]. The Brief Pain Inventory consists 
of eleven items related to the extent of pain intensity and 
the extent to which pain interferes with activities of daily 
living.  Pain  intensity  measurements  include  the  most 
severe, the mildest, the average and the pain at the time 
of interview in the last 7 days. A numerical pain scale is 
used  to  evaluate  the  level  of  pain  (0  being  no  pain  and 
10  being  unbearable  pain).  In  the  past  7  days,  pain  has 
affected  the  patient’s  ability  to  walk,  work,  sleep,  and 
enjoy life. It also measures their mood, relations with oth-
ers, and general activity level. On a numerical pain scale 
of  0–10,  each  object  is  scored  (0  being  fully  unaffected, 
10  being  completely  affected).  The  Turkish  validity  and 
reliability of the BPI was performed by Dicle et al. (2009) 
in surgical patients [29].

Pain  Coping  Scale,  created  by  Kraaimaat  and  Evers 
[30],  measures  the  frequency  with  which  people  with 
chronic  pain  employ  behavioral  and  cognitive  coping 
mechanisms.  Three  active  sub-dimensions,  such  as  dis-
traction,  pain  transformation,  and  comforting  thinking, 
and  three  passive  sub-dimensions,  such  as  withdrawal, 
worrying,  and  rest,  are  included  in  the  scale’s  original 
version. It is scored between 1 (almost never) and 4 (very 
often). A high score on the scale means using the strategy 
in  the  related  subscales  more.  The  scale  was  adapted  to 
Turkish  with  279  chronic  pain  patients  including  rheu-
matic diseases, fibromyalgia, low back pain and non-spe-
cific pain categories [31].

Pain  Beliefs  Scale  was  developed  by  Edwards  et  al. 
to  assess  beliefs  on  the  origin  and  management  of  pain 
[32].  The  scale  consisted  of  12  questions  and  two  sub-
dimensions as ‘psychological beliefs’ and ‘organic beliefs’. 
The six-point Likert-type scale was scored from 1: ‘never’ 
to 6: ‘always’. The organic beliefs dimension showed that 
the pain was mostly of organic origin, while the psycho-
logical  beliefs  dimension  showed  that  the  pain  experi-
ence was influenced by psychological factors. The highest 
score that can be obtained from the organic and psycho-
logical  beliefs  sub-dimensions  is  6  and  the  lowest  score 
is  1.  Although  there  is  no  cut-off  score  for  the  scale,  an 
increase in the score indicates that pain beliefs related to 
that dimension are high [2].

Tampa  Kinesiophobia  Scale  was  developed  to  assess 
the  fear  of  movement  and  potential  damage.  Injury/

Results
Three  participants  in  the  Reformer  Pilates/research 
group were eliminated from the study due to their irreg-
ular  attendance  and  subsequent  dropouts,  and  three 
participants  in  the  control  group  were  excluded  as  they 
refused to continue with the study after it was over and 
evaluation  measurements  could  not  be  taken.  54  people 
participated in the study; 27 of them were women in the 
Reformer Pilates group and 27 were in the control group 
(Fig. 1).

A summary of each participant’s demographics is pro-
vided  in  Table  1.  The  demographic  features  of  the  par-
ticipants  in  the  Reformer  Pilates  group  and  the  control 
group (age, BMI, education level, chronic pain area, and 
duration)  were  found  to  be  similar,  with  no  statistically 
significant difference between the two groups.

In the pre-treatment evaluations of both the Reformer 
Pilates  group  and  the  control  group,  the  groups  were 
homogenous (p > 0.05).

When  pre-treatment  and  post-treatment 

scores 
were  compared  within  groups,  a  statistically  significant

improvement was observed in the Reformer Pilates group 
for all outcomes except the passive coping subscale of the 
Pain  Coping  Scale,  and  the  organic  subscale  of  the  Pain 
Beliefs  Scale  (p < 0.05).  The  effect  sizes  for  the  observed 

changes  ranged  from  small  to  large  (Cohen’s  d = 0.40  to

improvements in pain intensity and fatigue scales met the 
threshold for clinical significance [38, 39].

The  Reformer  Pilates  group  showed  statistically  sig-
nificant  improvements  in  a  wide  range  of  pain-related 
outcomes. Significant reductions were observed in worst 
pain  intensity  (Mean  difference  (MD) = 2.18,  95%  CI: 
1.52–2.84, p < 0.001), least pain intensity (MD = 1.88, 95% 
CI:  1.29–2.48,  p < 0.001),  average  pain  (MD = 1.81,  95% 
CI:  1.21–2.42,  p < 0.001)  and  current  pain  (MD = 2.14, 
95%  CI:  1.57–2.72,  p < 0.001).  Functional  interference 
items  of  the  Brief  Pain  Inventory  also  showed  signifi-
cant  improvements  in  general  activity  (MD = 2.52,  95% 
CI:  1.86–3.17,  p < 0.001),  mood  (MD = 2.62,  95%  CI: 
2.01–3.24, p < 0.001), walking ability (MD = 2.03, 95% CI: 
1.  40-2.67,  p < 0.001),  work  (MD = 1.  55,  95%  CI:  1.04–
2.06,  p < 0.001),  relationships  with  others  (MD = 1.96, 
95%  CI:  1.30–2.61,  p < 0.001),  sleep  (MD = 1.92,  95%  CI: 
1.24–2.61,  p < 0.001)  and  enjoyment  of  life  (MD = 2.48, 
95%  CI:  1.71–3.24,  p < 0.001).  There  was  also  a  signifi-
cant  increase  in  active  pain  coping  strategies  (MD  = 
-2.62, 95% CI: -4.01 to -1.24, p < 0.001) and improvement 
in  the  psychological  subscale  of  the  Pain  Beliefs  Scale 
(MD = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.21–1.01, p = 0.001). Improvements 
were also observed in fear of movement (MD = 3.00, 95% 
CI:  2.44–3.55,  p < 0.001),  fatigue  (MD  =  -6.18,  95%  CI: 

-9.48  to  -2.88,  p < 0.001)  and  sleep  quality  (MD = 2.22, 
95%  CI:  1.26–3.18,  p < 0.001).  The  effect  sizes  of  these 
changes  ranged  from  small  to  large  (Cohen’s  d = 0.17  to 
1.45) (Table 3).

Discussion
The results of this study showed that a six-week program 
of  Reformer  Pilates  exercises  in  patients  with  chronic 
musculoskeletal  pain  exerted  a  favorable  influence  on 
perceived pain intensity, pain coping, pain beliefs, fear of 
movement, fatigue and sleep quality. From a clinical per-
spective,  the  most  notable  outcomes  were  the  improve-
ments  in  pain  intensity  and  fatigue  levels,  as  these 
changes reached the threshold for clinical significance.

The  pain  sensation  experienced  in  chronic  mus-
culoskeletal  disorders  varies  from  person  to  person, 
emphasizing  the  necessity  for  objective  measurement 
of  pain  using  a  common  language  [40].  This  is  crucial 
for  enhancing  convenience  in  diagnosis  and  treatment. 
Therefore,  the  most  important  step  in  the  management 
of painful conditions is the multidimensional assessment 
of pain [41]. The Brief Pain Inventory was used to assess 
pain in this study. The Brief Pain Inventory is a question-
naire  that  assesses  pain  in  a  multidimensional  way  by 
assessing  the  impact  of  pain  on  functioning  in  daily  life 

Şahan et al. BMC Psychology          (2025) 13:836 Page 8 of 11

(e.g.,  general  activity,  mood,  sleep)  as  opposed  to  scales 
that only measure the severity of pain [28]. This provides 
a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  how  Reformer 
Pilates  affects  both  sensory  and  functional  dimensions 
of pain in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. 
The study revealed a substantial decline in pain intensity 
and its impact on daily functioning among the Reformer 
Pilates  group,  both  in  the  pre-treatment  and  post-treat-
ment  in-group  evaluations  and  in  comparison,  with  the 
control  group.  In  particular,  the  decrease  in  pain  inten-
sity  met  the  threshold  of  clinical  significance,  indicat-
ing that the change was meaningful for the patient. In a 
study  conducted  on  this  subject,  although  the  effective-
ness of most exercise interventions in the management of 
chronic low back pain was emphasized, it was stated that 
the most beneficial program was Pilates or strength train-
ing, which includes mind-body exercises that are applied 
for  1–2  sessions  per  week,  lasting  less  than  60  min  and 
lasting 3–9 weeks [42]. Similar to the results of the pres-
ent  study,  Şahiner  et  al.  reported  that  Reformer  Pilates 
was  effective  and  reliable  in  reducing  pain  in  patients 
with  chronic  neck  pain. They  attributed  the  pain  reduc-
tion  to 
impaired  proprioception, 
in 
suggesting  that  Reformer  Pilates  enhances  postural 
awareness and concentration during movement. This, in 
turn, increases the efficiency of neural inputs transmitted 
from skin and joint mechanoreceptors to the central ner-
vous system [16].

improvements 

Pain  is  a  multidimensional  experience  that  encom-
passes not only physical but also psychological and social 
components.  This  complexity  explains  why  the  sever-
ity  of  pain  is  not  always  directly  related  to  the  extent  of 
tissue  damage.  Especially  in  the  case  of  chronic  pain,  it 
can become a significant source of stress that negatively 
affects  a  person’s  quality  of  life.  The  individual  develops 
cognitive and behavioral responses to this stressor. These 
efforts, which directly affect the intensity of pain, psycho-
logical adjustment and the level of pain-related disability 
are called coping strategies [4, 30, 31]. In general, passive 
coping  categories  (e.g.,  withdrawal,  rest,  worry-disas-
terization)  are  associated  with  worse  outcomes,  such  as 
decreased physical functioning and increased psycholog-
ical  distress,  whereas  active  coping  strategies  (e.g.,  con-
tinuing  activities  despite  pain,  ignoring  pain)  are  more 
positive,  although  there  is  no  consensus  on  this  issue 
[30, 31]. In a separate study by Kaygısız et al. with indi-
viduals experiencing chronic musculoskeletal pain, it was 
observed that young women exhibited a greater tendency 
to employ active coping strategies in managing their pain 
[43].  To  our  knowledge,  no  previous  research  has  spe-
cifically examined the effects of Reformer Pilates on pain 
coping strategies. According to the results of the current 
study, regular Reformer Pilates exercises enabled patients 
with  chronic  musculoskeletal  conditions  to  adopt  more 

active  coping  strategies.  In  fact,  considering  that  the 
patients who participated in this study were young adults 
and  people  who  were  active  in  daily  life,  it  is  seen  that 
the  results  are  compatible  with  the  literature.  In  addi-
tion, although the difference was not statistically signifi-
cant, a reduction was also observed in the passive coping 
strategy  of  worrying. This  is  thought  to  be  explained  by 
the  fact  that  deep  breathing  control  and  rhythmic  and 
goal-oriented  movements  in  Pilates  exercises  increase 
endorphin levels and have a regulatory effect on the cen-
tral  nervous  system;  thus  reducing  anxiety,  anxiety  and 
depression symptoms by providing relaxation in the body 
and  mind  [44].  Interestingly,  despite  the  lack  of  statisti-
cally  significant  results,  a  decrease  was  observed  in  the 
passive  coping  strategies—specifically  in  the  subcat-
egories  of  resting  and  withdrawal—among  participants 
in  the  control  group.  This  suggests  that,  even  without 
receiving  any  intervention,  simply  being  included  in  the 
study, the information provided about the study, and the 
initial assessments may have prompted them to reflect on 
their pain perception and coping strategies.

Beliefs about pain play a strong role in behavioral and 
emotional  responses  to  musculoskeletal  pain.  This  is 
because  a  person’s  beliefs  about  musculoskeletal  pain 
can  influence  how  they  respond  to  pain,  how  disabled 
they  are  likely  to  be  due  to  pain  and  how  chronic  the 
pain becomes. More importantly, beliefs can be changed 
and are therefore considered an important goal for pain 
management.  It  has  been  reported  that  changing  pain 
beliefs has both a positive effect on treatment satisfaction 
and  reduces  pain  and  disability  [32,  41].  Pain  beliefs  are 
classified  as  psychological  and  organic  beliefs.  Psycho-
logical beliefs are related with the belief that psychologi-
cal factors such as depression and anxiety have an effect 
on  pain.  In  psychological  beliefs,  the  person  thinks  that 
they  have  control  over  their  own  health  and  well-being. 
Organic  beliefs  are  that  organic  factors  are  effective  in 
the experience of pain. It is the belief that pain is caused 
by injuries and damages in the individual’s body and that 
managing pain is under the control of others. Psychologi-
cal effects and the benefits of relaxation are not accepted 
[32,  45,  46].  Molazem  et  al.  concluded  that  relaxation 
techniques  changed  the  pain  beliefs  of  hemophilia 
patients [47]. When the results of the study are examined, 
it is seen that the beliefs of patients with chronic muscu-
loskeletal pain that their pain is mostly caused by psycho-
logical effects increased after 6 weeks of regular exercise. 
The findings of this study are consistent with previous lit-
erature indicating that pain-related beliefs are modifiable 
through targeted interventions [32, 41, 47]. In particular, 
the results suggest that an exercise-based approach may 
be  effective  in  promoting  this  change.  Moreover,  fos-
tering  psychological  pain  beliefs  appears  to  encourage 

Şahan et al. BMC Psychology          (2025) 13:836 Page 9 of 11

Although these conditions share certain pathophysiologi-
cal and psychosocial mechanisms, they also differ in ana-
tomical and clinical characteristics. The inclusion of two 
distinct pain regions may have introduced heterogeneity 
that limits condition-specific interpretations.

Future perspectives

Further  research  might  use  some  objective  evaluations, 
imaging  techniques,  and  involvement  in  a  long-term 
Reformer  Pilates  exercise  program  in  order  to  provide 
more  accurate  and  dependable  indications  of  changes 
in  pain-related  parameters.  It  is  also  recommended  to 
investigate  long-term  effects  and  benefits  in  different 
patient groups in the future.

Clinical implications

According  to  the  results  of  the  study,  Reformer  Pilates 
can  be  considered  as  an  effective  treatment  option  to 
alleviate pain and improve psychological well-being (such 
as fatigue) in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain 
(especially those with low back and neck pain). Clinicians 
and  therapists  can  incorporate  Reformer  Pilates  into 
multidisciplinary  pain  management  program.  Appropri-
ate supervision and individualized exercise prescriptions 
can be implemented to maximize benefits and minimize 
risks. The results of this study support the clinical appli-
cation of Reformer Pilates as part of a holistic approach 
to pain management.

Conclusion
This study was designed to examine how Reformer Pilates 
exercises  change  pain-related  perceptions  such  as  pain 
intensity, pain coping skills, pain beliefs and how it has an 
effect on fear of movement, fatigue and insomnia caused 
by  pain  in  individuals  with  chronic  musculoskeletal  dis-
orders.  According  to  the  results  of  the  study,  Reformer 
Pilates exercises reduce pain perception and help patients 
with  chronic  musculoskeletal  pain  to  cope  with  pain  by 
providing  body  and  mind  unity.  While  previous  studies 
have  predominantly  focused  on  the  physical  benefits  of 
Pilates, the present study extends the scope by evaluating 
the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of Reformer 
Pilates, particularly in relation to pain beliefs and coping 
strategies.  In  this  regard,  it  is  believed  to  make  a  mean-
ingful contribution to the existing gap in the literature.

individuals  to  adopt  a  more  active  and  self-efficacious 
role in managing their pain.

In  the  development  of  pain-related  fear,  overstimula-
tion  of  the  amygdala  is  said  to  cause  suppression  of  the 
medial  prefrontal  cortex,  thus  leading  to  chronic  pain. 
In  their  study,  Senba  and  Kami  mentioned  that  patients 
with  chronic  pain  are  maladaptive  to  situations  because 
their  limbic  system  is  functionally  impaired,  they  can-
not  engage  in  goal-oriented  behaviors  and  they  are  eas-
ily caught in fear-avoidance thinking. In their study, they 
also stated that the key to getting out of the chronic pain 
state  depends  on  the  activation  of  the  positive  neurons 
of  the  basal  nucleus  of  the  amygdala  and  that  exercise 
encourages reward behavior and provides relief from the 
fear  response  to  pain  [7].  In  the  study,  it  was  observed 
that the decrease in the patients’ fear of movement after 
6 weeks of regular exercise training developed in parallel 
with the literature.

In this study, it was observed that the fatigue levels of 
the patients in the Reformer Pilates group decreased after 
exercise  training.  A  possible  explanation  for  this  might 
be breathing, which is one of the basic  principles in the 
application of Pilates exercises. Because breathing during 
exercise increases general well-being by providing respi-
ratory control in individuals and activating the parasym-
pathetic nervous system, and also has a positive effect on 
physical and mental fatigue [48].

Pilates  exercises  are  being  utilized  more  and  more  to 
enhance  the  quality  of  sleep,  but  the  effects  are  incon-
sistent.  More  extensive  research  is  required,  Chen  et 
al.  noted  in  their  study  that  Pilates  had  no  discernible 
impact  on  sleep  quality  in  postmenopausal  and  healthy 
women  over  40  [49].  However,  after  a  12-week  exercise 
regimen,  Pilates  was  found  to  improve  sleep  quality  in 
a  different  trial  including  young  people  who  were  sed-
entary [50]. It is evident from our study’s analysis of the 
impact of Reformer Pilates on sleep quality that exercise 
enhances sleep quality.

Limitations

The  major  limitation  of  this  study  is  the  absence  of  fol-
low-up  assessments,  which  could  have  provided  impor-
tant  insights  into  the  long-term  effects  of  the  Reformer 
Pilates  exercise  program  on  pain-related  outcomes  such 
as  pain  severity  and  pain  perception.  Additionally,  the 
study  included  only  female  participants,  which  limits 
the  ability  to  generalize  the  findings  to  male  popula-
tions  or  to  explore  potential  gender-based  differences 
in  treatment  response.  Another  limitation  is  the  reli-
ance  on  self-reported  outcome  measures.  The  dropout 
of six participants may have resulted in attrition bias and 
somewhat  reduced  the  generalizability  of  the  findings. 
Furthermore, the study sample included both chronic low 
back pain (CLBP) and chronic neck pain (CNP) patients.
