Effectiveness of the dog therapy for
patients with dementia - a systematic
review
Blanka Klimova1, Josef Toman1 and Kamil Kuca2,3*

Abstract

Background: Dementia represents a mental and economic burden for both patients and their caregivers.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of animal assisted therapy (AAT) with special focus
on canis therapy among people with dementia, specifically Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: The key method of this review study is a systematic review of the research studies detected in the Web
of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The search was conducted for the studies dating from 2016 till 31 August 2018
because several review studies were published before. Eventually, only six studies were involved into the final
analysis.

Results: The findings of this review, based on significant effect sizes, reveal that AAT may work as a beneficial and
effective complementary treatment, especially in the area of behavioral and psychological symptoms, for patients
with different degree of dementia severity if AAT is targeted at their specific needs and interests.

Conclusions: More research in the area of methodology for the implementation of AAT is necessary, and more
research should be conducted with respect to the use of AAT for the improvement of cognitive functions in
people with dementia.

Background
Nowadays, the number of people suffering from demen-
tia worldwide, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, reaches
about 50 million. It is estimated that every year there
occur about 10 million new cases [1]. Dementia is a neu-
rodegenerative syndrome, which causes deterioration of
cognitive functions, especially
thinking, orientation,
memory, or communication. The cognitive impairment
is usually accompanied with other symptoms such as be-
havioral disorders, difficulties in walking, sleeping, or
sexual problems [2].

Dementia results from different diseases,

ample,

strokes, malnutrition, or brain tumors

for ex-
[3].

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) seems to be the most com-
mon form of dementia and contributes to 70% of de-
mentia cases. The other most
types of
dementia are vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy
bodies, Parkinson’s disease dementia,
frontotemporal
dementia/ degeneration, and mixed dementia [4]. De-
mentia usually starts to affect people at the age of
60+ years. But, for example, frontotemporal dementia
occurs as early as at the age of 45 [5]. At present, de-
mentia symptoms cannot be cured and inevitably lead
to patient’s disability and eventually, to his/her death.
Depression and cognitive decline especially result in
patient’s mortality among the elderly people with de-
mentia [6, 7]. Adequate medications can for some
time postpone this process. Nevertheless, the symp-
toms of dementia steadily deteriorate and the patient
cannot look after himself/ herself. S/he has to rely on
somebody else in this respect, most often on his/her
in the year of 2016,
family member. For instance,

about 16 million of informal carers delivered 18 bil-
lion hours of care [8]. This care inevitably impacts
these informal carers, especially physically, emotion-
ally, but also financially since they usually must quit
their job to take care of their loved ones [9]. There-
fore, dementia significantly influences not only pa-
tients, but also their carers [10]. For this reason,
scientists worldwide are seeking non-pharmacological
strategies
that can enhance or maintain cognitive
functions and psychical symptoms of these people in
order to help them in maintaining quality of their life
and reducing the overall economic burden. These al-
ternative approaches are non-invasive, with minimum
side effects and definitely less costly [11]. One such

Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can be defined as a
goal directed intervention in which an animal meeting
specific criteria is an integral part of
the treatment
process [12]. AAT is usually performed by health or hu-
man service providers. These are, for instance, registered
nurses, nursing assistants, or occupational
therapists
[13]. The aim of AAT is to enhance physical, social,
emotional, or cognitive functions in both healthy and
unhealthy individuals and thus, contribute to the im-
provement of person’s well-being. AAT can take a form
of individual or group interventions [12].

As research [14] shows, AAT improves a person’s
mental and physical health. In the area of mental health,
it releases an automatic relaxation response, reduces the
feeling of anxiety, contributes to the lowering of loneli-
ness, or help in the recall of memories. In the area of
physical health, AAT helps to reduce blood pressure and
improves cardiovascular health, decreases the amount of
medications, reduces physical pain, or helps children
with autism to get engaged in social interactions. For in-
dividuals with dementia, AAT has the following specific
benefits:

(cid:1) it contributes to slightly higher physical activity;

people can pet the animal, such a dog, or in better
cases, they can go for a walk [15, 16];

(cid:1) it can relieve the so-called sundown syndrome, which
manifests itself in increased agitation, restlessness,
disorientation and aggressive behavior [15, 17];

(cid:1) it can improve short-term memory and

communication skills [15, 18];
(cid:1) it enhances eating habits [16];
(cid:1) it reduces loneliness [15, 17, 18].

In fact, when patients pet or cuddle their animal,
their body releases endorphins and other hormones
such as oxytocin, prolactin and dopamine. This con-
tributes to the benefits described above [19]. As Jo

[19] indicates, the most suitable animals for ATT are
fish, cats, dogs and horses. Most recently, robots dis-
guised as animals also started to be used in ATT
[20]. They appear to have similar positive effects
without the negative aspects of traditional pets such
as allergies, infections, or biting [21]. As Petersen et
al. [21] demonstrated in their study, these animal ro-
bots can reduce stress and anxiety in people with
dementia and decrease the use of psychoactive medi-
cations and pain medications among them.

Although several review studies [22–25] had been
already published, this review includes the latest stud-
ies on this topic, which were not included in these
reviews with one exception in [25]. In addition, this
review apart from the effect of canis therapy on the
reduction of behavioral symptoms of dementia ex-
plores also its effect on the reduction of cognitive
symptoms of dementia. In this respect it differs from
the latest systematic review by Yakimicki et al. [26]
who did not concentrate on the relationship between
the cognitive symptoms of dementia and animal-
assisted interventions.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to systematically
review evidence from controlled trials, case reports,
observational or experimental studies in order to find
out
to the question whether animal
assisted therapy with a special focus on canis therapy
among people with dementia is effective in reducing
cognitive and behavioral symptoms of dementia.

Methods
The authors performed a systematic review of research
studies detected in the Web of Science, Scopus and
PubMed. The search keywords were as follows: animal
assisted therapy AND dementia, animal assisted therapy
AND Alzheimer’s disease, canis therapy AND dementia,
canis therapy AND Alzheimer’s disease, dog therapy
AND dementia, dog therapy AND Alzheimer’s disease.
The search was conducted for the studies dated from
2016 till 31 August 2018.
Two (BK and JT) of

the authors identified and
screened the relevant articles. Altogether 107 articles
were detected in the databases mentioned above. Most
of the studies were detected in Web of Science (62),
followed by Scopus (30), and PubMed (15). After a thor-
ough review of the titles and abstracts (53) and their du-
plication (22) of the selected studies, 32 studies were
screened and after that, 21 studies remained for the full-
text analysis.

These full-text articles were then analyzed and evalu-
ated on the basis of the following inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. The inclusion criteria, based on PICOS
guidelines, were as follows:

Klimova et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2019) 19:276

(cid:1) The articles had to be published between January 1,

2016, and August 31, 2018.

(cid:1) Only English peer-reviewed journal articles were

involved.

(cid:1) The subjects had to be patients with dementia.
(cid:1) The intervention had to include a dog therapy.
(cid:1) Only randomized controlled trials, experimental/

cross-sectional studies, case reports, or observational
studies were involved.

(cid:1) The primary outcome focused on the reduction of
dementia symptoms, especially cognitive decline
among patients with dementia.
The exclusion criteria were as follows:

(cid:1) Descriptive or review studies on the research topic

were excluded from the analysis.

(cid:1) Studies whose subjects were not all patients with

dementia were also excluded, e.g. [27].

(cid:1) Studies which did not focus on dog therapy were

In addition, a backward search was also performed, i.e.,
references of detected studies were evaluated for relevant
research studies that authors might have missed during
their search. In addition, a google search was conducted in
order to detect unpublished (grey) literature. After this, an-
other two articles have been identified. Thus, altogether six
research articles were eventually analyzed and evaluated.

Two authors (BK and JT) performed an independent
quality assessment of these studies. They read the arti-
cles to assess eligibility and to determine the quality.
The basic quality criteria were adequately described
study design, participant characteristics, control condi-
tions, outcome measures, and key findings, with special
focus on statistically significant differences (Table 1).
The authors selected these basic quality criteria using
Health Evidence Quality Assessment Tool
for review
articles [31].

Figure 1 below then describes the selection procedure

not involved either, e.g. [21].

Results
Altogether six original studies on the research topic
were identified. Three studies were controlled studies
[28–30], two studies were experimental studies [17,
18] and one study was an observational study [13].
As for the country of origin, most of the research in
this
area has been conducted in Scandinavian
countries [13, 17, 29, 30], followed by Italy [28] and
USA [18]. The key area of assessment focused on
behavioral symptoms of patients with all severity of
dementia [13, 18, 29, 30]. Apart from that, one study
[28] explored cognitive functions and one study [17]
concentrated on physical health and more specific-
ally, on balance. The sample of subjects ranged from
5 to 80 older individuals with the mean age between
75 to 95 years. Not surprisingly,
there were more
female participants than male participants if taking
into account
their age. The intervention period
lasted from two weeks to six months. All control
groups were passive. The main outcome measures
comprised standardized tests such as Mini-Mental
State Examination, Geriatric Depression Scale, Clin-
ical Dementia Rating, or Quality of Life in Late-stage
Dementia. The results of all
identified studies indi-
the AAT or AAA therapies with a dog
cate that
have a positive impact on mental and physical health
of
the subjects with dementia as the effect sizes
show. Based on the basic quality criteria, only the
study by Swall et al. [13] seems to be less reliable
quality. The findings of
the detected studies are
summarized in alphabetical order of their first au-
thor in Table 1 below.

Discussion
As the findings of
the studies in Table 1 show,
AAT or AAA therapies may be effective in the care
about patients with dementia. They especially posi-
tively enhance patients’ behavior since while being
with a dog, patients appear to be calm, relaxed and
contented, which results in the reduction of their
feelings of depression, anxiety, agitation, and aggres-
sion [13, 17, 18, 28, 30]. This was also supported by
significant effect
In addition,
AAT/AAA contributes to the improvement of social
behavior; the presence of a dog stimulates patients
to interact and thus reduces their social
isolation
and loneliness. These findings have been also con-
firmed by other review studies, e.g. [22, 23, 25, 26],
and in most previous empirical studies, e.g. [32, 33].
The repeated multimodal stimulations (verbal, vis-
ual, tactile) as seen in the study by Menna et al.
[28] prove to be feasible and effective. In this study,
the intervention took the form of structured play

[17, 18, 28].

sizes

with a dog, which acted as a therapeutic and social
agent.

Furthermore, dog therapy can be effective in the
improvement of patients’ physical health as it was
proved in the study on balance by Olsen et al. [29],
in which AAA had a significant effect (p = 0.03) on
improving subjects’ balance and preventing risks of
in comparison with the control group. The re-
fall
searchers engaged patients in active interactions with
the dog and the patients, for example, had to bend
down to pick the ball or they leaned forward to pet
the dog. All these movements required a good pos-
ture control. Positive outcomes in the area of phys-
ical health were also studied by Cherniack and
Cherniack [24], but with modest results.

In addition, dog therapy may also be beneficial for
the improvement of cognitive functions as it was
demonstrated by Menna et al.
[28], although with
modest effects. Interaction with the dog namely re-
quires from the patient to pay attention, orientation
in his/her environment, or simply it evokes in him/
her memories from the past.

Olsen et al. [17] in their study also point out that the
severity of dementia should be considered when plan-
ning AAT/AAA since patients with severe dementia had
different needs and they demand more care and time.
Therefore, AAT/AAA should be tailored to their specific
needs and interests and aim at the person-centered de-
mentia care [13].

The limitation of this study consists in analyzing the re-
sults of studies with different methodological approaches
to AAT or AAA, small subject samples, as well as with dif-
ferent intervention periods. In addition, there was only
one study [30], which also measured the effect after the
follow up period. All these aspects then might have an im-
pact on the overestimation of the discussed findings.
Therefore, standard guidelines for the implementation of
AAT are needed [22].

symptoms)

Conclusion
The findings of this study reveal that AAT may work
as a beneficial and effective complementary treat-
ment (especially in the area of behavioral and psy-
chological
for patients with different
degree of dementia severity if AAT is targeted at
their specific needs and interests. Nevertheless, more
research in the area of methodology for the imple-
mentation of AAT is necessary, as well as more re-
search should be conducted with respect to the use
of AAT for the improvement of cognitive functions
in people with dementia.
