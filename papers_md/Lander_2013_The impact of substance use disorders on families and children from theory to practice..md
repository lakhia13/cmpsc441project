The Impact of Substance Use Disorders on Families and
Children: From Theory to Practice

Abstract

The effects of a substance use disorder (SUD) are felt by the whole family. The family context
holds information about how SUDs develop, are maintained, and what can positively or negatively
influence the treatment of the disorder. Family systems theory and attachment theory are
theoretical models that provide a framework for understanding how SUDs affect the family. In
addition, understanding the current developmental stage a family is in helps inform assessment of
impairment and determination of appropriate interventions. SUDs negatively affect emotional and
behavioral patterns from the inception of the family, resulting in poor outcomes for the children
and adults with SUDs. Social workers can help address SUDs in multiple ways, which are
summarized in this article.

INTRODUCTION AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

The family remains the primary source of attachment, nurturing, and socialization for
humans in our current society. Therefore, the impact of substance use disorders (SUDs) on
the family and individual family members merits attention. Each family and each family
member is uniquely affected by the individual using substances including but not limited to
having unmet developmental needs, impaired attachment, economic hardship, legal
problems, emotional distress, and sometimes violence being perpetrated against him or her.
For children there is also an increased risk of developing an SUD themselves (Zimic &
Jakic, 2012). Thus, treating only the individual with the active disease of addiction is limited
in effectiveness. The social work profession more than any other health care profession has
historically recognized the importance of assessing the individual in the context of his or her
family environment. Social work education and training emphasizes the significant impact
the environment has on the individual and vice versa. This topic was chosen to illustrate
how involving the family in the treatment of an SUD in an individual is an effective way to
help the family and the individual. The utilization of evidence-based family approaches has
demonstrated superiority over individual or group-based treatments (Baldwin, Christian,

Berkeljon, & Shandish, 2012). Treating the individual without family involvement may limit
the effectiveness of treatment for two main reasons: it ignores the devastating impact of
SUDs on the family system leaving family members untreated, and it does not recognize the
family as a potential system of support for change. Two theories important to understanding
how and why SUDs impact the family are attachment theory and systems theory.

Attachment Theory

It is estimated that more than eight million children younger than age 18 live with at least
one adult who has a SUD that is a rate of more than one in 10 children. The majority of
these children are younger than age 5 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
[USDHHS], 2010). The studies of families with SUDs reveal patterns that significantly
influence child development and the likelihood that a child will struggle with emotional,
behavioral, or substance use problems (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration [SAMHSA], 2003). The negative impacts of parental SUDs on the family
include disruption of attachment, rituals, roles, routines, communication, social life, and
finances. Families in which there is a parental SUD are characterized by an environment of
secrecy, loss, conflict, violence or abuse, emotional chaos, role reversal, and fear.

Relationships serve as the communication conduits that connect family members to each
other. Attachment theory provides a way of understanding the development and quality of
relationships between family members. John Bowlby (1988) developed attachment theory
through the clinical study of mammalian species and humans. He postulated that at the time
of an infant's birth, the primary relationship, usually with the mother but not always, serves
as the template for all subsequent relationships throughout the life cycle. This relationship
forms a subsystem within the larger family system. It is through this relationship, at a
prelanguage level, that infants learn to communicate and relate to their environment. They
do this through crying, cooing, rooting, and clinging. The way in which the primary
caretaker responds to these cues will establish the quality of the attachment. Generally, if the
child experiences the primary caretaker as responsive and nurturing, a secure attachment
will form. If the child experiences the primary caretaker as unresponsive or inconsistently
responsive, an insecure attachment may form that can result in a variety of problems
including anxiety, depression, and failure to thrive.

A parent with a SUD, who is mood altered, preoccupied with getting high or spending
significant amounts of time recovering from the effects of substances, may miss the
opportunities to foster healthy attachment. Consequently, the intricate attachment system
that is built on hundreds of thousands of reciprocal and implicit interactions between infant
and attachment figure will be affected. Eye contact, tone, volume and rhythm of voice,
soothing touch, and the ability to read the needs of the infant are all intricate building blocks
of attachment. Healthy attachment is a psychological immune system of sorts. Just as
humans need a physiological immune system to fight off disease and illness, likewise, the
relational attachment system provides protection against psychological problems and illness.
Without a healthy attachment system, a child is much more vulnerable to stress and
therefore more susceptible to having problems with trauma, anxiety, depression, and other
mental illness. Attachment theory posits that the quality of the parents' attachment system
that developed in infancy will affect their ability to form healthy attachments to their own
children and with other adults.

Family Systems Theory

Family systems theory grew out of the biologically based general systems theory. General
systems theory focuses on how the parts of a system interact with one another. In general
systems theory an individual cell is one example of a system, and in family systems theory

the family is essentially its own system. Key concepts in both theories are feedback,
homeostasis and boundaries that are defined and operationalized in this section. Family
systems theory was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Nathan Ackerman, Jay
Haley, Murray Bowen, Salvadore Minuchin, Virginia Satir, and Carl Witaker, among others
were highly influential figures in this movement and developed its applications to
psychiatric treatment. Out of this theory multiple models of family therapy developed
including but not limited to strategic, structural, experiential, and more recently the
multisystemic family systems therapy (MFT) model. All the family therapy models share the
basic principal of family systems theory that is that the individual cannot be fully understood
or successfully treated without first understanding how that individual functions in his or her
family system. Individuals who present in our clinical settings can be seen as
“symptomatic,” and their pathology can be viewed as an attempt adapt to their family
system so as to maintain homeostasis.

Homeostasis refers to the idea that it is the tendency of a system to seek stability and
equilibrium (Brown & Christensen, 1986). The idea of homeostasis is key to understanding
the effect of SUDs on the family in that each family member tends to function in such a way
that keeps the whole system in balance even if it is not healthy for specific individuals. For
example, a latency-age child may cover up her father's drinking by cleaning up after him if
he is sick, getting him into bed after he passes out, and minimizing his drinking to her
mother. Her efforts allow his SUD to continue with limited consequence and keep the family
system at relative equilibrium by reducing fighting between the mother and father. Although
that adaptation may keep the family system in a state of equilibrium, it also serves to
maintain the problem. Feedback refers to the circular way in which parts of a system
communicate with each other. The process of feedback is how the parent–child attachment
relationship is formed. In a family system, a wife may identify that she abuses pain pills
because her husband ignores her and she is depressed. The husband may in turn state that he
avoids his wife because she is always morose and high on pain pills. Each person's behavior
becomes reinforcing feedback for the other. Boundaries define internal and external limits of
a system and are established to conserve energy by creating a protective barrier around a
system. In a family they regulate interpersonal contact. In a healthy family, boundaries
surround the parental subsystem and the child subsystem by keeping them separate. In a
family with a parent who has a SUD, boundaries around the parental and child subsystems
are typically permeable as the parental subsystem does not function well as a cohesive unit.
Boundaries around the family itself are rigid to maintain the family secret of substance
abuse. Healthy boundaries are important in the normal development of a family and
children.

FAMILY IMPACT

Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of SUDs. Given that the
family in which one is raised influences both of these, it is important to explore the impact
of SUDs on the family. Studies looking at the relative weight of these influences show that
both add contribution and impact (Haber et al., 2010). The impact will vary depending on
the role and gender that the individual with the SUD has in the family. For example, if an
adolescent child is identified as having a SUD, this will affect the family differently than if a
parent has an SUD. The attitudes and beliefs that family members have about SUDs are also
of importance as these will influence the individuals as they try to get sober and will
influence the efficacy of treatment interventions. For example, if a parent sees a SUD as a
moral failing and thinks his or her adolescent child should just use “will power” to quit, this
will be important to know if the treating therapist is working from a disease model of
addiction. Education with the family about SUDs, their development, progression, and
treatment will be needed. When family members have appropriate education and treatment

for themselves they can play a significant role in the abusers' recognition of the problem and
acceptance of treatment. The evidence-based family treatment Community Reinforcement
And Family Training (CRAFT) has demonstrated its effectiveness in increasing the rate at
which abusers enter treatment (Roozen, de Waart, & van der Kroft, 2010).

When one person in a family begins to change his or her behavior, the change will affect the
entire family system. It is helpful to think of the family system as a mobile: when one part in
a hanging mobile moves, this affects all parts of the mobile but in different ways, and each
part adjusts to maintain a balance in the system. One consequence of this accommodation
can be that various family members may inadvertently sabotage treatment with their own
behaviors as they respond to the change in the individual using substances. For example, if
an adult son tries to get sober and his retired father feels as if he has lost his “drinking
buddy,” he might express to his son that he can have “just a couple beers at the game.” This
will put pressure on the son to continue his use so as not to disappoint his father. These
behaviors can be seen as an attempt to maintain the comfortable equilibrium of the system
because as one person changes it upsets the equilibrium of the whole family system
including extended family relationships. Family therapy can be a useful intervention where
the therapist can assist and support the son in setting limits with the father saying he does
not want to drink at all and suggesting alternative non-drinking-related activities. Individual
therapy can be used with the son to affirm his decision to remain sober and reinforce the
importance of his establishing his own identity as a nondrinking person.

We know that individuals who grow up in a family where there is an SUD are at
significantly higher risk to develop SUDs due to genetic and environmental factors
(Hawkins, Catalano, & Miller, 1992). It is essential to assess for active substance abuse in
the immediate and extended family. Knowing that an individual with an SUD grew up in a
family with an SUD has significant implications in treatment. Active substance abuse in the
family of a client who is trying to get clean will also put that client at risk for relapse.

Developmental Stages of the Family

Understanding the family's specific developmental stage can help with assessing the
interventional needs of a family. Carter and McGoldrick (1989) identify eight stages of the
family life cycle and corresponding developmental tasks. SUDs can disrupt these
developmental tasks depending on who has the SUD and at what developmental stage the
family is in when the SUD develops. Table 1 is an adaptation of Carter and McGoldrick's
family life cycle stages as applied to families with SUDs. When families do not move
through the life cycle and get stuck, individual members can exhibit clinical symptoms. It
should be noted that blended families with stepparents and stepchildren have their own
developmental needs that are impaired by SUDs as well, but those are not detailed in this
table.

Impact of Parental Substance Abuse on Children

Clinicians have speculated that what are called “attachment disorders” may occur at elevated
rates among children affected by alcohol, in part due to abuse and neglect (when these have
happened), and in part because of alcohol-related deficits in cognitive and social-emotional
functioning that lead to less resilience (Coles et al., 1997). Studies indicate that between one
third and two thirds of child maltreatment cases involve some degree of substance use (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 1996). The negative consequences
of having one or both parents with a SUD ranges from covert damage that is mild and may
play out when a child or adolescent is having difficulty establishing trusting relationships
with people, to being overly emotionally responsible in relationships and taking on adult
roles much younger than developmentally appropriate. An even more severe impact can

begin in utero with maternal substance abuse that causes damage to the growing fetus
resulting in birth defects, fetal alcohol syndrome, and/or fetal alcohol effects. These
difficulties may cause disabilities that require early intervention and often ongoing and
social and mental health services. Social workers can help by encouraging their clients who
abuse substances to use precautions to prevent pregnancy and providing education about the
risks of maternal drug use on the developing fetus. If a social worker is working with a
pregnant client with an SUD, referral to a Perinatal Addiction Clinic and/or high-risk
pregnancy OB/GYN clinic is indicated.

As previously mentioned, all primates learn how to regulate their affect from their primary
attachment figures through the attachment system and modeling. Parents who have
substance use problems will likely have their own affect dysregulation that may have
preceded or resulted from their substance use. Consequently, development of healthy affect
regulation will be difficult for children and adolescents to achieve. This can result in
children and adolescents having an increased risk for internalizing problems such as
depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and so on or externalizing problems such as
opposition, conduct problems (stealing, lying, and truancy), anger outbursts, aggressivity,
impulsivity, and again substance abuse. Children may present to a social worker in direct
practice at community mental health center or a school setting. Social workers can assist
these clients by looking for signs and symptoms of parental substance use while observing
the child's behavior in social settings and in play behavior. Social workers should look for
how the child's presenting symptoms serve a function in the family system to maintain
homeostasis. Providing family therapy, parent training and education, play therapy, social
skills training, and coping skills training either in individual or group therapy in an
outpatient, school or in-home therapy setting are ways that social workers can be helpful.
Sometimes a referral to Child Protective Services will be indicated.

Parental Substance Abuse and Child Abuse and Neglect

A parent with a SUD is 3 times more likely to physically or sexually abuse their child. The
sequalae of this is that these children are more than 50% more likely to be arrested as
juveniles, and 40% more likely to commit a violent crime (USDHHS, 1996). Children who
have experienced abuse are more likely to have the externalizing disorders such as anger,
aggression, conduct, and behavioral problems whereas children who experience neglect are
more likely to have internalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, poor peer
relations). Incest has a very high association with parental substance abuse as do all types of
sexual abuse. About two thirds of incest perpetrators report using alcohol directly before the
offending incident (USDHHS, 1996).

Although active substance abuse can impair attachment and healthy modeling for affect
regulation, sometimes the consequences of severe and ongoing substance abuse on the part
of a parent can result in parent and child separation. This separation could be because of
parental incarceration, long-term treatment or an intervention on the part of child protective
services that removes the child from an unsafe or high-risk home environment and places
him or her in an out-of-home placement such as foster care, relative placement, or a group or
residential home. In extreme cases, the separation may be due to the substance-related death
of the parent from overdose, motor vehicle accident, or medical complications due to
substance abuse. The significant increase in out-of-home child placements in the 1980s and
1990s closely paralleled the pandemic drug addiction in the United States during those
decades (Jaudes & Edwo, 1997). Any long-term separation will have a negative impact on
the child's ability to attach, regulate affect, and can lead to a trauma response of numbing or
hyperarousal (inability to discriminate and respond appropriately to stimulus). These
impairments in the psychological emergency response system are directly related to, and
substantially increase, subsequent traumatic victimization. Maltreated children of parents

with a SUD are more likely to have poorer physical, intellectual, social, and emotional
outcomes and are at greater risk of developing substance abuse problems themselves
(USDHHS, 2003).

Social workers can help by using trauma-informed, attachment-informed, and systems-based
approaches to direct practice in individual therapy and family therapy with special attention
to multigenerational trauma and substance abuse. The role of the social worker may include
providing in-home therapy supporting parents in being more effective with parental
supervision, providing structure, and facilitating healthy caring communication. Social
workers may serve on multidisciplinary teams to advocate for a child who is adjudicated,
abused, and/or neglected. In addition, social workers may provide expert testimony in courts
and participate in permanency planning for children in out-of-home placements. Lastly,
social workers play an essential role in specialized courts (family courts, mental health
courts, adult drug courts, and juvenile drug courts), providing a unique person in
environment and multisystems lens to helping children and families. Specialized drug courts
have been shown to produce favorable outcomes for the whole family (Burns, Pullman,
Weathers, Wirschem, & Murphy, 2012).

Parental Substance Abuse and Child Social and Emotional Functioning

Many children living in a home where there is an addiction develop into “parentified
children.” This occurs when the caretaker is unable to meet the developmental needs of the
child, and the child begins to parent themselves and perhaps younger siblings earlier than
developmentally appropriate. In a phenomenon called “reversal of dependence needs” the
child actually begins to parent the parent.

Case Example

Ashley was a 15-year-old female who was referred to treatment by her school
counselor for self-injury. She is a classic “hero” child who has excellent grades and
is well liked by her peers. Her parents separated when she was age 5, and she lived
with her biological mother until she was 12. Her father obtained full custody of her
after being contacted by the domestic violence shelter where she was living with
her mother and younger brother. They had moved to the shelter after a domestic
violence incident involving her mother's boyfriend. Her biological mother was
alcohol dependent; she had difficulty keeping a job and moved frequently. In fifth
grade, Ashley changed schools 7 times in a single academic year. Her mother
worked as a waitress and a bartender and would often go out drinking after her
evening shifts. Ashley then became the caregiver to her younger brother. From age
9 she remembers her mother coming home, being intoxicated sometimes in a black-
out, and Ashley helping her into bed. She remembers caring for her mother at night,
cleaning up her vomit, wiping her face, and tending to her younger brother in the
mornings by getting his breakfast and helping him get ready for school. She stated
to her therapist that she remembers thinking, “If only I take really good care of her,
maybe she'll be able to take care of me someday.”

In reversal of dependence needs, the parent's needs are placed before the child's. This sets
the child up for a potential lifetime of inability to set healthy boundaries in relationships and
make the important triad connections between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It creates a
lack of self-awareness and sometimes an over awareness of others' needs. In the literature
one can find these difficulties well-documented under children of alcoholics and adult
children of alcoholics research (Berkowitz & Perkins, 1988; Cork, 1969; Hecht, 1973;
Morehouse & Richards, 1982; Stroufe, Egeland, Carlson, & Collins, 2005; Tarter, 2002;
Zucker, Donovan, Masten, Mattson, & Moss, 2009).

Communication is a significant social skill for interpersonal effectiveness. Parents with a
SUD may have difficulty with assertiveness and direct communication. Many subjects are
covertly “off-limits” to discuss. Children in these families also often witness the
convergence of poor communication and affect dysregulation with their caregivers that
frequently results in domestic violence. Although these difficulties may not be overtly
diagnosable with a physical or psychological disorder, the patterns have significant
developmental, social, and interpersonal consequences. Common emotions these children
experience are anxiety, fear, depression guilt, shame, loneliness, confusion, and anger. They
may believe that they caused their parent's SUD, or perhaps they are expected to keep the
drug use a secret from others in the family or in the community. Perhaps they recognize their
parent is mood altered or in withdrawal but are told that, “Your dad is just sick; he needs his
medicine.” A parent's moodiness, forgetfulness, and preoccupation can create a chaotic and
unstructured, unpredictable environment that leaves the child guessing and asking the
questions, “What is going to happen next?” and “What is normal?” Children may present in
community mental health settings with a variety of presentations. In terms of diagnosable
mental and emotional disorders, children affected by parental substance abuse are virtually
at higher risk for nearly every childhood disorder in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Of most
significant correlation are the following: eating disorders, behavior disorders, anxiety
disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and SUDs. Social workers can help by
evaluating the function of the presenting symptoms through a family systems perspective.
Social workers can help children and families have more direct and honest, yet
developmentally appropriate communications; and helping youth to deal with covert and
overt emotions that are related to their parent's substance use. Social workers can achieve
this through the provision of play therapy, individual therapy, family therapy, and group
therapy in a variety inpatient, outpatient, in-home, and community based settings.

Parental Substance Abuse and Educational Functioning

Educational problems are also characteristic of some children affected by parental substance
use. Problems with unexcused absences in childhood can turn into more serious truancy
problems in adolescence and culminate in school dropout. In early childhood, parents read
less and provide less learning-based stimulation to their infants and toddlers. In school-age
years, parents are less available to provide assistance with homework, monitor school
performance, and track assignments. These children may have difficulty with attention and
concentration due to increased anxiety levels related to a chaotic home environment.
Unstructured bedtimes and mealtimes as well as witnessing domestic violence and safety
issues all contribute to an increase in learning problems and behavioral problems for these
children at school. It is difficult for children to focus on higher order thinking and learning
when basic survival needs are not met. Similar to the home environment, communication
between substance abusing parents and teachers and the larger school system is poor. Many
parents struggling with an SUD had difficulty with the school system in their own school-
age years and avoid interacting with it due to their own anxiety or shame.

The role of the social worker may include providing school-based supportive services to the
youth as well as connecting clients with afterschool care, tutoring services, or mentoring
agencies such as Big Brothers Big Sisters. In-home and outpatient family therapy and
education, supporting parents in being more effective with parental supervision and
discipline, providing structure, rewards, and consequences for school attendance and
performance and supporting parents in communicating with the school systems can help as
well. Social workers can also help by participating in Individualized Education Plan (IEP)
meetings, making school referrals for special education, and requesting psychoeducational
and neuropsychological testing. Referral to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for a

interventions in the classroom.

The Impact of Substance Abuse on Parents of Adult Children

As children transition into adulthood they are still strongly affected by their parents as their
parents are by them. One of the factors that can perpetuate SUDs is the enabling that family
members frequently engage in. Enabling is a form of accommodation that protects the
individual with the SUD from fully experiencing the consequences of his or her substance
use. An example of enabling is when the parents of a 25-year-old man repeatedly bail him
out of jail and pay for lawyer and court fees generated as a result of drug-related arrests. The
parents are attempting to help their son and maintain homeostasis in the system by
preventing him from going to jail, however the secondary effect is that the son experiences
no consequence to his use. As a result, his SUD is more likely to continue. Parents and
grandparents do not always agree on how to “help” an adult child with an SUD. Social
workers can encourage parents of adult children to seek their own help in Al-Anon and Nar-
Anon. These are 12-Step programs for family members that will help them disengage with
love, so that they stop enabling and begin to care for themselves. Often parents blame
themselves for their children's substance use and feel responsible for fixing the problem. In
Al-Anon and Nar-Anon they receive support from other family members and learn they did
not cause the SUD, nor can they control it or cure it.

How Social Workers in Nonaddiction Settings Can Help

It is beyond the scope of this article to present in detail how to assess for an SUD, and social
workers inexperienced in this area should refer patients to those who specialize in the
treatment of SUDs. However with the prevalence of SUDs in the general population being at
least 10%, and higher for those presenting with mental health problems, social workers in all
settings will find themselves working with individuals with SUDs. All clients, and
especially those with known or suspected SUDs, should be reassured of confidentiality. Due
to the shame and stigma associated with having an SUD, this is of utmost importance to
obtain accurate information. Clients should be asked if they believe they have an SUD and
can be informed of how the social worker typically helps those with SUDs. Social workers
need to educate themselves about the clinical and community resources in their area
available for the treatment of SUD and refer to these resources when indicated. This
includes outpatient substance abuse programs, methadone clinics, intensive outpatient
programs, detoxification, and residential settings as well as self-help meetings.

Most social workers are mandated reporters so this can present an ethical issue for those
who work with individuals with SUDs, especially those with dependent children. Many
patients know this and may withhold information about their substance use out of fear of
being reported to Child Protective Services. Mandated reporters should disclose this role to
their clients and be specific about what circumstances require reporting, while also
emphasizing they will do everything they can to assist clients in obtaining the help they
need. Being honest in this way helps establish rapport. Social workers should be aware of
their own biases, if any, regarding substance abuse. Only if clients feel a positive therapeutic
rapport and trust the social worker will they disclose substance use.

SUDs affect families and children in every area of their development. Social workers have
opportunities to intervene and change the trajectory of these potential problems at many
junctions. When assessing any client is it essential to inquire about substance use history in
the family, in the individual, and current use. There is a way to do this that is sensitive and
does not put the person on the defensive. Motivational interviewing strategies can be
employed to build rapport, increase motivation for change, and decrease resistance (Miller

& Rollnick, 2002; W. R. Miller & Rose, 2010). In addition a variety of objective measures
can be presented as part of your normal evaluation (Michigan Alcohol Screening Test
[MAST; Selzer, 1971], Drug Abuse Screening Test [DAST; Skinner, 1982], and Substance
Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory for Adolescents [SASSI-A2; Miller, 1999]). Assessment
not only of the individual in front of you but of their family members as well such as
parents, siblings, and extended family members may be needed. One way to approach this is
with a genogram (McGoldrick & Gerson, 1985). Genograms can reveal SUD patterns in a
visual way and help to obtain family details of substance use without directly asking about
the problem thereby decreasing defensiveness.

Once a substance use problem has been identified, educating the client about what it means
to have a SUD, the treatments available, and the stages of recovery can be useful. Clients
can be encouraged to share the impact of the substance use on themselves and on their
family system. Encouraging clients to share their feelings related to their experiences in the
family is important as it helps them to break the silence so often associated with living with
an SUD, and it can also increase their awareness about cognitive and behavioral patterns that
contribute to the SUD. If through the assessment it becomes clear that your client or
someone in the family would benefit from treatment specifically for his or her SUD,
facilitating a formal evaluation or referral to treatment will be helpful. An undetected SUD
can cause treatment of any type of problem to be ineffective.

Following are some specific steps that social workers can take to be helpful when a SUD is
suspected or identified:

1. Routinely assess for SUD problem and refer the individual to a specialty clinic for

further assessment or treatment when indicated.

2.

If problem is identified, educate about SUD, treatment, recovery, and relapse.

4. Know the structure of the family that the individual you are working with comes

from (i.e., blended family, single-parent family).

5. Know the developmental stage of the family that the individual you are working

with comes from (family with teenagers, aging family).

6. Provide treatment referrals for family, members (children, spouses, adult parents)

where appropriate.

a. Family therapy, couples therapy

b. Play therapy, social skills training

c. Parent training

d. Psychiatric services

7. Coordinate with school systems to help clients access school-based services, after-
school care, and tutoring. Help parents with advocating in the school system for
their children if psychoeducational/neuropsychological testing is needed or the
development of an Individualized Education Plan.

8. Facilitate referrals to specialized courts is indicated: adult drug court, teen drug

court, family court.

9. Educate clients with SUDs about pregnancy prevention and provide education

about risks of drug exposure on fetus.

10. Inform about AA, NA for the patient with a SUD and Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, Alateen

for family members. Provide location and times of meetings in their area.

11. If there are safety issues with regard to children or the elderly, Child Protective

Services or Elder Protective Services referral may be needed.

12. Ask questions about if the current living situation is physically safe or if there have

been past or present incidences of domestic violence.

SUMMARY

Individuals with SUDs cannot be understood and treated effectively without considering the
impact on the whole family. Addictions researchers have confirmed the reciprocal
relationship between the disease of addiction and the environment. All persons influence
their social environment and in turn are influenced by it. The family system must be factored
into the understanding of the disease development and maintenance as well as be included in
the efforts necessary for successful ongoing treatment. The earlier we can intervene in the
progression of an SUD, the better the outcomes for all family members. For further readings
on this topic SAMHSA TIP #39 (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2004) provides an
overview of substance abuse treatment and how to incorporate the family, and TIP #24
(Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2004) is a guide to substance abuse services for
primary care clinicians.
