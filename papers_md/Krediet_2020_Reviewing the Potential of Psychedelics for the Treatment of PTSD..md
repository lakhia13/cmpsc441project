Abstract

There are few medications with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatment 
guidelines have unequivocally designated psychotherapy as a first line treatment for PTSD. Yet, even after psychotherapy, 
PTSD often remains a chronic illness, with high rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity. Meanwhile, the search for and 
development  of  drugs  with  new  mechanisms  of  action  has  stalled. Therefore,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  explore  not  just 
novel compounds but novel approaches for the treatment of PTSD. A promising new approach involves the use of psychedelic 
drugs. Within the past few years, 2 psychedelics have received breakthrough designations for psychiatric indications from 
the US Food and Drug Administration, and several psychedelics are currently being investigated for the treatment of PTSD. 
This review discusses 4 types of compounds: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ketamine, classical psychedelics (e.g., 
psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide), and cannabinoids. We describe the therapeutic rationale, the setting in which they 
are being administered, and their current state of evidence in the treatment of PTSD. Each compound provides unique qualities 
for the treatment of PTSD, from their use to rapidly target symptoms to their use as adjuncts to facilitate psychotherapeutic 
treatments. Several questions are formulated that outline an agenda for future research.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex disorder with 
a  host  of  neurobiological  alterations  (see  Yehuda  et  al.,  2015; 
Vermetten et al., 2018). During the last 2 decades, only 2 medica-
tions (i.e., paroxetine and sertraline) have been approved for the 
treatment  of  PTSD,  both  of  which  have  demonstrated  limited 

efficacy  (Hoskins  et  al.,  2015;  Cipriani  et  al.,  2018).  Meanwhile, 
the search for and development of drugs with new mechanisms 
of action has stalled (Krystal et al., 2017b). Because of the limited 
efficacy of pharmacotherapeutic interventions, PTSD treatment 
guidelines  (Department  of Veterans Affairs  and  Department  of

Defense, 2017; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 
2018)  have  unequivocally  designated  exposure-based  psycho-
therapy as a first line treatment for PTSD. Yet, even after mul-
tiple modalities of psychotherapy, PTSD often remains a chronic 
illness, with high rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity 
(Steenkamp et al., 2015; Bryant et al., 2016; Kitchiner et al., 2019). 
Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore not just novel com-
pounds but novel approaches for the treatment of PTSD.

The complexity of PTSD makes pharmacological targeting of 1 
specific neurotransmitter system (e.g., targeting stress reactivity 
with  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  or  hyperarousal 
with beta-blockers) insufficient. The treatment of PTSD may re-
quire more than pharmacologically targeting dysregulated mol-
ecules and pathways associated with developing and sustaining 
PTSD symptom severity and may benefit from pharmacologic-
ally induced changes in the capacity to engage with traumatic 
material in psychotherapy (DePierro et al, 2019). This may imply 
an approach to therapy that is conceptually different from the 
currently available treatments.

Most of the currently used psychotherapies for the treatment 
of  PTSD  are  exposure-based  therapies,  which  rely  on  imaginal 
visualization of the traumatic events and exposure to trauma-
related cues that trigger fear responses. The goal is to extinguish 
conditioned fear to cues associated with trauma by desensitiza-
tion to fearful stimuli and learn that the trauma is not reenacted 
in real time. The approach is directive, and the role of the ther-
apist is to instruct the patient to relive the trauma and to pro-
vide a cognitive framework for change (Resick et al., 2016). Many 
patients  experience  a  reduction  in  PTSD  symptoms  after  psy-
chotherapy.  However,  40–60%  of  patients  do  not  respond  ad-
equately  (Haagen  et  al.,  2015;  Steenkamp  et  al.,  2017; Watkins 
et al., 2018). The processing of traumatic memories typically can 
be an emotionally challenging experience for PTSD patients. For 
some patients, emotional detachment, fragmentation of trauma 
memories,  or  an  inability  to  complete  sessions  due  to  the  in-
ability to tolerate reexperiencing traumatic memories can lead 
to nonresponse and treatment dropout (Mott et al., 2014; Goetter 
et al., 2015). Engagement in psychotrauma-focused therapy may 
be difficult for some patients in particular, especially those with 
extreme affect dysregulation or with shame or guilt associated 
with the recall of traumatic memories.

The  integration  of  the  targeted  use  of  certain  psychoactive 
substances within a psychotherapeutic treatment may have the 
potential to address some of these challenges. The psychoactive 
properties  of  psychedelic  drugs  may  be  of  particular  interest 
within  such  a  substance-assisted  psychotherapy  approach. The 
rationale  behind  this  approach  is  that  these  drugs  can  catalyze 
the  psychotherapeutic  process,  for  example,  by  increasing  the 
capacity for emotional and cognitive processing through pharma-
cologically  diminishing  fear  and  arousal,  by  strengthening 
therapeutic  alliance  through  increased  trust  and  rapport,  or  by 
targeting processes of fear extinction and memory consolidation.
After a several decades hiatus, psychedelics are increasingly 
being studied for the treatment of a range of psychiatric indica-
tions (Mithoefer et al., 2016; Kyzar et al., 2017). Within the past 
2 years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recom-
mended  2  compounds  (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
and  psilocybin),  which  are  still  on  the  US  Drug  Enforcement 
Administration’s  most  restrictive  schedule,  a  breakthrough 
therapy  designation,  and  approved  esketamine  for  treatment-
resistant  depression.  Currently,  several  psychedelics  are  being 
investigated for the treatment of PTSD. In this article, we review 
the  potential  of  4  types  of  psychedelic  compounds:  3,4-meth
(MDMA),  ketamine,  classical 
ylenedioxymethamphetamine 

psychedelics  (e.g.,  psilocybin  and  lysergic  acid  diethylamide 
[LSD]), and some cannabinoids.

Psychedelic Drugs in the Treatment of PTSD

The use of psychedelics as medicines has recently been called 
a new emerging paradigm (Nichols et al., 2017). Although many 
questions remain about the mechanisms of action and efficacy, 
psychedelic drugs have seen a renaissance in research on their 
therapeutic potential, ranging from the treatment of depression 
to substance use disorders and PTSD (Kyzar et al., 2017; Curran 
et al., 2018). Psychedelic drugs (sometimes referred to as hallu-
cinogens or entactogens) refer to a category of compounds that 
can induce a wide range of psychological, cognitive, emotional, 
and  physical  effects  (Nichols,  2004; Vollenweider  and  Kometer, 
2010). For this review, we use a broad definition of psychedelic 
drugs, which includes substances such as MDMA, ketamine, and 
cannabis,  whose  pharmacological  profiles  differ  substantially 
from  the  serotonergic  “classical”  psychedelics  (such  as  psilo-
cybin and LSD) but which all share the capacity for inducing an 
altered or opening of the sense of self.

Although  psychedelic  drugs  are  increasingly  being  studied 
for the treatment of PTSD, well-designed clinical studies are still 
scarce. In the following sections, we will summarize the avail-
able evidence for 4 types of psychedelics, providing background 
information  and  addressing  the  therapeutic  rationale  for  each 
substance, the setting in which they are administered, and the 
current state of evidence for the treatment of PTSD. For an over-
view, see Table 1.

MDMA

Background
MDMA  was  first  synthesized  in  1912  as  an  intermediate  sub-
stance  in  the  synthesis  of  a  hemostatic  drug  (Freudenmann 
et al., 2006). It only started gaining attention since the discovery 
of  its  psychoactive  effects  in  the  1970s,  after  which  several 
psychotherapists started using it as an adjunct to psychotherapy 
(Passie, 2018). In 1985, after MDMA became widely known as a 
“party  drug,”  the  US  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  placed 
it on schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, and its thera-
peutic  use  became  illegal  (Passie,  2018).  In  spite  of  its  initial 
therapeutic use, no clinical trials were conducted until the year 
2000. Since then, MDMA has been investigated for the treatment 
of PTSD (e.g., Mithoefer et al., 2010, 2018), alcohol use disorder 
(Sessa et al., 2019), and social anxiety in autistic adults (Danforth 
et  al.,  2018).  Because  of  the  promising  results,  in August  2017, 
the FDA designated MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a “break-
through therapy” for the treatment of PTSD. A multicenter phase 
3 trial is ongoing with several sites in the United States, Canada, 
and  Israel,  and  another  multicenter  phase  2/3  trial  has  just 
started in several European countries.

Therapeutic Rationale
The  main  rationale  behind  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  is 
that  MDMA  acts  as  a  catalyst  to  psychotherapy  by  reducing 
the  fear  response  to  anxiety-provoking  stimuli,  including  pre-
vious trauma and traumatic memories. In addition, MDMA en-
hances  introspection  and  increases  interpersonal  trust,  which 
can benefit the therapeutic alliance. From a clinical perspective, 
MDMA  alters  cognition  very  slightly,  produces  only  mild  sen-
sory  alterations,  and  does  not  induce  a  clouding  of  conscious-
ness, while patients sustain a clear memory of the experience 
(Passie, 2012). MDMA’s fear-reducing effects and “trust-boosting”

properties  aid  in  opening  new  avenues  for  therapeutic  repro-
cessing.  These  effects  may  be  used  to  facilitate  imaginal  ex-
posure, cognitive restructuring, and corrective attachment.

Several  papers  have  been  published  on  the  thera-
peutic  mechanisms  of  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  (e.g., 
Mithoefer et al., 2016; Feduccia and Mithoefer, 2019). Both pre-
clinical and clinical studies provide evidence for some of the 
proposed mechanisms. For example, MDMA has been shown 
to  increase  emotional  empathy  (Kuypers  et  al.,  2017),  pro-
social behavior (Hysek et al., 2013), pleasantness of affective 
touch  (De  Wit  and  Bershad,  2019),  and  subjective  ratings  of 
closeness to others, openness, and trust (Schmid et al., 2014). 
MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  has  shown  the  ability  to  in-
duce  lasting  changes  in  some  personality  traits  (Mithoefer 
et  al.,  2018).  Preliminary  data  indicate  that  increases  in  the 
trait  of  openness  play  a  moderating  role  between  treatment 
with  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  and  reductions  in  PTSD 
symptoms (Wagner et al. 2017).

On a neurobiological level, MDMA attenuates amygdala ac-
tivity  while  activating  the  frontal  cortex  (Gamma  et  al.  2000; 
Carhart-Harris  et  al.,  2015),  the  activity  of  which  is  often  im-
paired  in  patients  suffering  from  PTSD  (see  Francati  et  al., 
2007;  Dahlgren  et  al.,  2018).  MDMA  also  increases  oxytocin 
levels,  which  is  a  potential  contributing  factor  to  experi-
enced  increases  in  interpersonal  trust  (Vizeli  and  Liechti, 
2018).  Oxytocin  levels  have  been  shown  to  mediate  the  pro-
social  effects  of  MDMA  in  animal  studies  (Thompson  et  al., 
2007),  and  a  recent  study  found  that  a  single  dose  of  MDMA 
in mice reopens the critical period for social reward learning, 
which required activation of oxytocin receptors in the nucleus 
accumbens, and endures beyond the acute effects of the drug 
(Nardou  et  al.,  2019). The  effects  of  MDMA  on  fear  extinction 
and memory consolidation may be another contributing factor 
to  its  therapeutic  potential  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  (Young 
et  al.,  2017;  Feduccia  and  Mithoefer,  2018).  Ongoing  research 
is testing whether these findings translate to humans as well 
(e.g., NCT03181763).

Setting
Typically, the use of MDMA is embedded within a psychothera-
peutic  treatment,  with  several  non-drug  preparatory  sessions 
preceding  and  multiple  integrative  therapy  sessions  following 
each  MDMA  session.  MDMA  is  administered  in  a  clinical—but 
aesthetically  pleasant—setting,  with  sessions  lasting  5  to  8 
hours.  Patients  are  accompanied  by  2  therapists  whose  role  is 
to  facilitate  an  introspective  process  in  which  the  patient  may 
revisit  past  experiences.  An  important  difference  with  regular 
pharmacotherapeutic treatments of PTSD is that MDMA is used 
as an adjunct to psychotherapy. The role of MDMA is to occasion 
a  mental  and  emotional  state  conducive  to  fuller  engagement 
in the therapeutic process. Another important distinction is the 
nondirective  approach.  This  approach  emphasizes  the  import-
ance  of  allowing  the  patient’s  own  process  to  unfold. Although 
verbal  interactions  between  the  patients  and  therapists  can  be 
an important part of the sessions, patients are often encouraged 
to  lie  down,  close  their  eyes,  and  go  inwards  while  listening  to 
a music playlist specifically selected for this therapy. Music has 
shown  to  play  a  central  role  in  psychedelic-assisted  psycho-
therapy (Kaelen et al., 2015; Barrett et al., 2018), and several play-
lists have been composed to assist and enhance the therapeutic 
process  (Kaelen  et  al.,  2018). The  psychotherapeutic  procedures 
and interventions follow a standardized treatment manual that 
has been developed for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD 
(Mithoefer, 2017).

Administration
MDMA is typically administered orally in doses ranging from 75 
to 125 mg (Mithoefer et al., 2019). In most studies, 1 to 2 hours 
after administration, a booster dose containing one-half of the 
initial dose is offered to prolong the effects. The duration of ef-
fects  is  4  to  6  hours,  often  with  some  lingering  effects  in  the 
hours afterwards (Mithoefer et al. 2010). MDMA is typically ad-
ministered  2  to  3  times  over  the  course  of  several  months  of 
nondrug psychotherapy.

Evidence in the Treatment of PTSD
The  first  clinical  trial  into  the  use  of  MDMA-assisted  psycho-
therapy  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  was  conducted  in  Spain 
from 2000 to 2002 in 6 women with chronic PTSD secondary to 
sexual assault (Bouso et al., 2008). Patients received a low dose 
(50 or 75 mg MDMA) combined with several 90-minute nondrug 
psychotherapy  sessions  before  and  after  the  MDMA  sessions. 
Reductions  of  PTSD  symptoms  were  observed  in  both  MDMA 
groups, but the small number of patients did not allow for stat-
istical  analysis. The  most  important  conclusion  that  could  be 
drawn from this study was that the administration of MDMA in 
this population seemed both physically and psychologically safe.
The  results  of  the  first  randomized  placebo-controlled  trial 
(RCT) of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD were published 
in  2010  (Mithoefer  et  al.,  2010). Twelve  treatment-resistant  pa-
tients received 2 sessions with 125 mg MDMA (plus an optional 
booster of 62.5 mg), while 8 patients received a placebo. The re-
sults  showed  that  83%  of  the  patients  in  the  MDMA  group  did 
not meet the criteria for PTSD anymore, according to Clinician-
Administrated  PTSD  Symptoms  Scale  (CAPS-IV)  cutoff  scores, 
compared with 25% in the placebo group. A long-term follow-up 
demonstrated that treatment effects were stable over a 3.5-year 
period (Mithoefer et al., 2013). These results were replicated in 2 
other studies (Mithoefer et al., 2018; Ot’alora et al., 2018) in which 
MDMA-treated patients also showed increases in posttraumatic 
growth. A pooled analysis on 105 patients from 6 RCTs (Mithoefer 
et  al.,  2019)  showed  that  patients  who  received  MDMA  experi-
enced significantly greater reductions in PTSD symptom scores 
than patients in the control group (Cohen’s d = 0.8). After 2 MDMA 
sessions,  54.2%  of  patients  no  longer  met  PTSD  diagnostic  cri-
teria compared with 22.6% in the control group. Compared with 
data  used  for  the  FDA  approval  of  paroxetine  and  sertraline, 
MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  showed  higher  effect  sizes  and 
significantly lower dropout rates (Feduccia et al., 2019). Based on 
these  results,  the  FDA  granted  MDMA  a  breakthrough  therapy 
designation for the treatment of PTSD.

Safety and Potential Side Effects
Frequently reported side effects of MDMA include anxiety, tight 
jaw, headache, and fatigue (Feduccia et al., 2019; Mithoefer et al., 
2019).  Episodes  of  anxiety  can  occur  when  the  first  effects  of 
MDMA become noticeable and can easily be coped with by psy-
chotherapeutic support (Passie, 2012). In some cases, a slightly 
depressed mood has been reported (Liechti et al., 2001). MDMA 
is  known  to  increase  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  in  a  dose-
dependent  manner  (Vizeli  and  Liechti,  2018).  Therefore,  some 
forms  of  hypertension  and  severe  cardiovascular  pathology 
are  seen  as  contraindications.  Slight  hyperthermia  as  induced 
by MDMA presents no problem when used in a medical setting 
(Holze et al., 2020). Some authors (e.g., Parrott, 2014; Schenk and 
Newcombe, 2018) have raised concerns over a potential neuro-
toxicity  and  abuse  liability  of  MDMA  (e.g.,  Roger  et  al.,  2009; 
Biezonski and Meyer, 2011; Heal et al., 2018). However, neither of

those have occurred in medically supervised use of MDMA (e.g., 
Feduccia et al., 2019; Mithoefer et al., 2019).

Ketamine

Background
Ketamine,  a  noncompetitive  N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor 
antagonist,  was  first  synthesized  in  1962  and  approved  as  an 
anesthetic  in  1970.  It  is  often  categorized  as  a  “dissociative 
psychedelic” (e.g., Sanz et al., 2018). Since the 1990s, ketamine-
assisted psychotherapy has been used in the treatment of al-
coholism and heroin addiction based on an aversion approach 
(Krupitsky  and  Grinenko,  1997;  Krupitsky  et  al.,  2007).  During 
the  last  2  decades,  ketamine  has  been  receiving  increasing 
interest  for  the  treatment  of  a  variety  of  psychiatric  indica-
tions.  In  the  early  2000s,  several  clinical  trials  reported  the 
rapid  antidepressant  properties  of  ketamine  (Berman  et  al., 
2000;  Zarate  et  al.,  2006).  Since  then,  there  has  been  an  ex-
ponential  growth  in  studies  investigating  its  antidepressant 
effects  (see  Fond  et  al.,  2014  for  a  meta-analysis)  and  its  ef-
fects on suicidal ideation (see Wilkinson et al., 2018 for a meta-
analysis).  In  March  2019,  the  FDA  approved  esketamine  (1  of 
2  enantiomers  of  ketamine)  for  the  treatment  of  treatment-
resistant  depression.  Ketamine  has  also  been  proposed  as  a 
candidate for targeting emotional memories (Veen et al., 2018), 
and  it  is  increasingly  studied  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  (e.g., 
Feder et al., 2014; DePierro et al., 2019).

Therapeutic Rationale
In the treatment of depression, ketamine has very rapid effects, 
acting  through  glutamatergic  and  other  signaling  pathways 
(Murrough et al., 2013a). Although there is limited empirical evi-
dence  for  mechanisms  through  which  ketamine  might  reduce 
PTSD symptoms, several neurobiological mechanisms have been 
proposed. One hypothesis is that PTSD is a “synaptic disconnec-
tion syndrome” (e.g., Li et al., 2011; Duman et al., 2016; Krystal 
et  al.,  2017a). The  therapeutic  effects  of  psychedelic  drugs  like 
ketamine might be partially explained by their ability to rapidly 
increase synaptic and neuronal plasticity (Ly et al., 2018).

Ketamine  could  also  target  PTSD  symptoms  by  its  effects 
on  glutamate  signaling.  The  glutamate  system  has  shown  to 
play an essential role in several memory processes, such as re-
consolidation  and  extinction  learning  (Nader,  2015).  Ketamine 
enhances  fear  extinction  in  rodents  (Girgenti  et  al.,  2017)  and 
has  also  shown  the  ability  to  block  memory  reconsolidation 
(Das et al., 2013; Duclot et al., 2016). Ketamine’s effects on these 
memory  processes  suggest  a  potential  role  for  its  use  within 
a  substance-assisted  psychotherapy  framework.  Due  to  its 
plasticity-enhancing effects, ketamine may also increase the re-
ceptiveness to psychotherapeutic interventions in the days fol-
lowing administration.

Administration  of  a  subanesthetic  dose  of  ketamine  could 
then  be  considered  an  augmentation  strategy  for  trauma-
focused  psychotherapy  (Veen  et  al.,  2018),  suggesting  that  the 
integration  of  ketamine  within  a  psychotherapeutic  treat-
ment  could  result  in  long-term  remission  of  PTSD  symptoms. 
A  small  number  of  practitioners  have  used  ketamine  within 
such  a  framework  before,  with  promising  results  in  the  treat-
ment of alcohol and heroin addiction (Krupitsky and Grinenko, 
1997; Krupitsky et al., 2007), and in some other indications (e.g., 
depression and anxiety; Dore et al., 2019). Within a substance-
assisted  psychotherapy  approach,  the  acute  psychoactive  ef-
fects  of  ketamine—ranging  from  sensory  distortions  and 

390

hallucinations,  to  transformations  in  the  self-concept,  emo-
tional  attitudes  to  aspects  of  self  and  others,  and  changes  in 
life values and purposes (Krupitsky et al., 1997)—could catalyze, 
deepen, or increase engagement in a psychotherapeutic process 
and  facilitate  reflections  on  psychological  material  presented 
during the acute subjective experience.

Setting
Different  from  the  therapeutic  use  of  MDMA,  the  current  ad-
ministration  of  ketamine  is  typically  not  approached  from  a 
substance-assisted psychotherapy framework. This is often re-
flected in the setting in which ketamine is applied. It is mainly 
being administered in clinical hospital rooms, without the use 
of  music,  and  with  little—if  any—time  spent  on  psychological 
preparation and integration of ketamine experiences. It must be 
noted that there can be a wide range of settings in which keta-
mine can be administered, from the stand-alone administration 
of ketamine to the use of ketamine with assisted forms of psy-
chotherapeutic preparation and support. When ketamine is em-
bedded within a substance-assisted psychotherapy framework, 
its use might benefit from a similar setting as used for MDMA- 
or psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.

Administration
In  the  treatment  of  psychiatric  indications,  ketamine  is  typic-
ally  administered  intravenously  in  doses  of  0.5  mg/kg  over  a 
period of 40 minutes (e.g., Feder et al., 2014; McGirr et al., 2015). 
Administered  intravenously,  the  acute  effects  of  ketamine  last 
for 40 to 70 minutes. Ketamine can also be administered intra-
muscularly,  intranasally,  or  orally.  For  the  treatment  of  PTSD, 
ketamine  has  been  studied  as  a  single  infusion  intervention 
(Feder et al., 2014) and as a multiple infusion intervention (e.g., 
6 administrations in 2 weeks; Albott et al., 2018). Different doses 
of ketamine can induce qualitatively different psychoactive ef-
fects, which can potentially be used for different treatment ap-
proaches. When its use is embedded within a psychotherapeutic 
treatment, it can be administered at different stages of therapy, 
depending  on  the  therapeutic  approach.  For  example,  when 
the  aim  is  to  enhance  fear  extinction  or  to  influence  memory 
consolidation, it could be administered in low doses at the be-
ginning  of  a  psychotherapy  session.  Because  of  its  ability  to 
increase  neuroplasticity,  ketamine  might  also  increase  the  re-
ceptiveness  to  inpatient  exposure  therapy  when  administered 
in higher doses at the day or several hours before a patient starts 
treatment.

Evidence in the Treatment of PTSD
The only RCT that studied ketamine for the treatment of PTSD 
compared a single i.v. infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine with an i.v. 
infusion of 0.045 mg/kg midazolam in 41 patients with chronic 
PTSD  and  associated  depressive  symptoms  (Feder  et  al.,  2014). 
Ketamine  infusion  led  to  a  significant  and  rapid  reduction  of 
PTSD  symptom  severity,  which  remained  significant  up  until 
7  days  after  this  single  infusion.  These  short-term  improve-
ments  point  to  a  temporary  neurobiological  working  mech-
anism,  as also observed in the use of ketamine for depression 
(see Fond et al., 2014).

As with the use of ketamine for depression (Murrough et al., 
2013b),  research  suggests  that  the  therapeutic  effects  of  keta-
mine  on  PTSD  can  be  enhanced—both  in  strength  and  dur-
ation—with repeated infusions. Albott et al. (2018) administered 
6 i.v. ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg) over a 12-day period in 15 
military veterans with comorbid PTSD and treatment-resistant 
depression.  The  remission  rate  for  PTSD  (defined  as  PTSD 

checklist for DSM-5 scores <33) was 80%, with a median time to 
relapse of 41 days.

To our knowledge, only 1 published study has attempted to 
treat PTSD with ketamine using an approach that is somewhat 
comparable  with  substance-assisted  psychotherapy.  Pradhan 
et al. (2017, 2018) combined the administration of ketamine with 
a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy in patients with refrac-
tory PTSD. Patients received a single i.v. dose of 0.5 mg/kg keta-
mine (or saline) over 40 minutes. Before the infusion, traumatic 
memories were activated in a controlled manner by making pa-
tients reflect on a personalized scripted narrative of their index 
trauma. In addition, during the infusion period, 2 cycles (10 min-
utes  each)  of  a  mindfulness  exercise  were  practiced,  aimed  to 
facilitate the extinction of traumatic memories and the recon-
solidation  of  novel  calming  memories.  Ketamine-induced  re-
laxation and dissociation augmented a state in which patients 
did not react fearfully to the traumatic memories but passively 
accepted  them  as  they  came  (Pradhan  et  al.,  2017).  Patients  in 
the ketamine group showed a significantly more durable reduc-
tion in CAPS-IV PTSD symptoms (for 34 days) than patients in 
the placebo group (for 16 days). This is a 5-times increase in the 
duration of response compared with a single administration of 
ketamine  without  any  psychotherapy  reported  by  Feder  et  al. 
(2014). However, improvement in PTSD symptoms was still rela-
tively short-lived.

Safety and Potential Side Effects
Frequently  reported  side  effects  of  ketamine  include  drowsi-
ness,  dizziness,  nausea,  visual  and  perceptual  alterations,  and 
dose-dependent dissociative effects (Rybakowski et al., 2016). In 
some cases, ketamine can induce short-lived anxiety. Such reac-
tions can be minimized by supportive clinical settings (Aust et al., 
2019; Dore et al., 2019). By its sympathomimetic effects, ketamine 
increases  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure. Therefore,  some  forms 
of  hypertension  and  severe  cardiovascular  pathology  are  seen 
as  contraindications  (Rybakowski  et  al.,  2016). While  acute  psy-
choactive  effects  of  ketamine  are  often  considered  undesirable 
side  effects,  from  the  perspective  of  a  substance-assisted  psy-
chotherapy approach, some of these effects are thought to have 
therapeutic value (Krupitsky et al., 2007; Pradhan et al., 2017).

Classical Psychedelics

Background
Classical psychedelics comprise a group of several compounds, 
including  psilocybin,  LSD,  and  dimethyltryptamine  (DMT), 
which share a common mechanism of action, mainly by agon-
istic action at the 5-HT2A receptor. In the 1950s and 1960s, many 
psychiatrists  judged  classical  psychedelics  as  valuable  tools 
when  combined  with  psychotherapy.  Over  700  scientific  art-
icles were published, and a few thousand patients were treated 
for  several  mental  disorders,  including  neuroses,  trauma,  and 
alcoholism  (Passie,  1997).  In  the  mid-1960s,  most  psychedelic 
drugs were scheduled because of widespread use outside of the 
medical context, and research came to a halt. Since the 2000s, 
there  is  renewed  interest  in  the  therapeutic  potential  of  these 
compounds. The focus varies from pharmacokinetics, mechan-
isms of action, and brain imaging studies to phase 2 trials for the 
treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Psilocybin has been 
studied  for  the  treatment  of  depression  (Carhart-Harris  et  al., 
2016, 2017), tobacco and alcohol addiction (Johnson et al., 2014, 
2017; Bogenschutz et al., 2015, 2018), obsessive-compulsive dis-
order  (Moreno  et  al.,  2006),  and  depression  and  anxiety  in  pa-
tients with life-threatening diagnoses (Grob et al., 2011; Griffiths 

Copyedited by:  

et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016). Based on these studies, psilocybin 
recently  received  breakthrough  designations  from  the  FDA  for 
use in depression. Currently, several trials with psilocybin- and 
LSD-assisted psychotherapy are being conducted in Europe and 
the United States. Although no formal clinical trials have yet in-
vestigated these substances for the treatment of PTSD, the avail-
able evidence (e.g., Leuner, 1981; Bastiaans, 1983) does warrant 
such an investigation.

Therapeutic Rationale
Findings  of  several  recent  studies  suggest  that  the  effects  of 
classical  psychedelics  might  be  useful  for  the  treatment  of 
PTSD.  As  with  ketamine,  classical  psychedelics  induce  several 
neurobiological  changes  that  may  be  relevant  for  a  psycho-
therapeutic  application.  Both  psilocybin  (Catlow  et  al.,  2013) 
and  DMT  (Cameron  et  al.,  2018)  have  been  shown  to  facilitate 
fear  extinction  in  animal  studies  and  to  promote  neural  plas-
ticity  in  vivo  and  vitro,  increasing  neurogenesis,  spinogenesis, 
and  synaptogenesis  (Ly  et  al.,  2018).  The  plasticity-promoting 
properties  of  these  substances  might  contribute  to  their  rapid 
antidepressant  and  anxiolytic  effects.  Classical  psychedelics 
have  also  been  shown  to  decrease  amygdala  reactivity  during 
emotion  processing  (Kraehenmann  et  al.,  2015;  Mueller  et  al., 
2017). As patients with PTSD often show heightened amygdala 
reactivity (see Francati et al., 2007), this may increase the ability 
to process traumatic memories.

Other  acute  effects  that  substantiate  their  potential  thera-
peutic role in the treatment of PTSD include increases in emo-
tional  empathy  (Pokorny  et  al.,  2017),  increases  in  creative 
divergent thinking (Kuypers et al., 2016), enhanced mindfulness-
related capacities (Soler et al., 2015; Sampedro et al., 2017), in-
creased insightfulness (Kometer et al., 2015), reduced avoidance 
and  increases  in  acceptance  and  connectedness  (Watts  et  al., 
2017),  long-term  increases  in  the  personality  trait  of  openness 
(Maclean et al., 2011; Lebedev et al., 2016), and emotional break-
through  experiences  (Roseman  et  al,.  2019),  which  has  shown 
to  be  a  key  mediator  in  long-term  psychological  change  in 
other  mental  disorders.  Classical  psychedelics  are  also  known 
to induce mystical-type experiences (Griffiths et al., 2011). Such 
experiences have shown to mediate therapeutic effects of psilo-
cybin  in  nicotine  addiction  (Garcia-Romeu  et  al.,  2014);  reduc-
tions in anxiety, depression, and existential distress in patients 
with  a  life-threatening  diagnosis  (Griffiths  et  al.,  2016;  Ross 
et  al.,  2016);  and  improvements  in  depression  (Roseman  et  al., 
2018). However, it is currently unknown whether this type of ex-
perience also holds value for the treatment of PTSD.

Setting
The setting in which classical psychedelics are administered is 
very  similar  to  that  of  MDMA. Their  use  is  usually  embedded 
within  an  extensive  psychotherapeutic  treatment  with  mul-
tiple  nondrug  preparatory  and  integrative  sessions.  Typically, 
psilocybin and LSD are administered in a comfortable and aes-
thetically pleasant setting under the guidance of a female/male 
therapist  team.  As  with  MDMA,  the  approach  is  nondirective, 
and interaction with the therapists or guides is often kept to a 
minimum,  especially  during  the  first  few  hours  of  the  experi-
ence. Patients are encouraged to lie down, close their eyes, and 
go  inwards  while  (in  most  treatment  procedures)  listening  to 
specifically  selected  music  (Kaelen  et  al.,  2018).  Classical  psy-
chedelics  have  also  been  used  in  more  interactive  and  group 
settings  with  small  to  moderate  doses  to  weaken  psycho-
logical  defenses,  as  was  done  with  psycholytic  therapy  in  the 
previous  century  (Passie,  1997).  Appropriate  contextualization 

Krediet et al.

within  conventional  psychotherapy  and  safety  measures  as 
well  as  competent  verbal  and  nonverbal  support  are  essential 
when this type of compound will be used when dealing with the 
complex symptoms of PTSD.

Administration
Psilocybin  and  LSD  are  typically  administered  orally  at  the 
beginning  of  a  treatment  session  in  doses  ranging  from  10  to 
25 mg psilocybin or 50 to 200 µg LSD. The psychological effects of 
psilocybin last from 3 to 6 hours (Passie et al., 2002) and those of 
LSD last from 8 to 10 hours (Passie et al., 2008). Both substances 
are usually administered just a few times over the course of sev-
eral months of nondrug psychotherapy.

Evidence in the Treatment of PTSD
Before  PTSD  was  introduced  as  a  psychiatric  diagnosis  in  the 
third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders  in  1980,  LSD  (and  sometimes  psilocybin  and  keta-
mine)  was  used  in  the  Netherlands  as  a  therapeutic  tool  in 
the  treatment  of  what  was  then  called  concentration  camp 
syndrome. The core of this therapy consisted of enabling clients 
to reexperience the traumatic event with appropriate emotional 
abreaction under therapeutic guidance. The main figure working 
with this approach was Dutch psychiatrist Jan Bastiaans (1983), 
who treated hundreds of patients. In a long-term follow-up study 
on 12 patients, all but 1 patient reported moderate to strong im-
provements  after  treatment  with  this  method  (Ossebaard  and 
Maalsté,  1999).  It  is  known  from  the  literature  on  psycholytic 
treatments  in  the  1960s  (Passie,  1997)  that  many  traumatized 
patients have been treated with classical psychedelics; however, 
they were not diagnosed with PTSD due to the lack of this diag-
nosis in the diagnostic systems at the time.

To our knowlegde, since then no studies have investigated 
the  potential  of  a  classical  psychedelic  for  the  treatment  of 
PTSD.  However,  the  DMT-containing  plant  concoction  aya-
huasca recently has been proposed as a candidate for its treat-
ment  (Nielson  and  Megler,  2014;  Inserra,  2018).  Ayahuasca  is 
usually prepared from the combination of the beta-carboline–
containing  Banisteriopsis  caapi  vine,  which  has  monoamine 
oxidase inhibiting properties, and the DMT-containing leaves 
of  Psychotria  viridis.  This  strong  psychoactive  brew  has  been 
used  for  centuries  by  indigenous  people  in  the  Amazon  for 
medicinal,  spiritual,  and  other  purposes  (McKenna,  2004). 
Some researchers are currently collecting survey data on the 
use  of  ayahuasca  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD.  There  are  also 
plans  to  study  ayahuasca  for  this  indication  in  clinical  trials 
(Labate et al., 2014).

Results from both past and recent studies suggest a poten-
tial  role  for  classical  psychedelics  in  the  treatment  of  PTSD. 
However,  there  may  be  specific  challenges  with  this  approach 
due to the heightened arousal and sensitivity induced by these 
substances.  In  sum,  there  is  tentative  clinical  evidence  that 
these substances may be helpful with PTSD, but more rigorous 
studies are needed.

Safety and Potential Side Effects
Side  effects  of  classical  psychedelics  include  occasional  tran-
sient  episodes  of  nausea,  vomiting,  and  physical  discomfort 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016). Classical psy-
chedelics  can  also  induce  psychologically  challenging  experi-
ences,  including  anxiety  and  confusion  (Johnson  et  al.,  2018). 
However, such experiences can be part of the therapeutic pro-
cess. With  experienced  therapists,  they  do  not  cause  any  ser-
ious problems (Grof, 1980; Leuner, 1981). Some patients may feel 

392

emotionally  vulnerable  during  the  days  following  the  experi-
ence,  which  stresses  the  importance  of  psychological  support 
afterwards (Watts et al., 2017). Classical psychedelics can mildly 
increase  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure. Therefore,  some  forms 
of hypertension and severe cardiovascular pathology are seen as 
contraindications  (Johnson  et  al.,  2018).  Classical  psychedelics 
are not toxic to the human organism and do not cause depend-
ence or serious after effects (e.g., flashbacks) when used in med-
ically supervised settings (Cohen, 1960; Malleson, 1971; Johnson 
et al., 2018).

Cannabinoids

Background
Cannabis  has  been  used  in  Asia  and  the  Middle  East  for  me-
dicinal,  spiritual,  and  other  purposes  for  thousands  of  years 
(Haney and Hill, 2018). Medicinal use of cannabis in the Western 
world started in the 19th century for the treatment of rheuma-
tism, convulsions, and other indications (Zuardi, 2006). However, 
the  medical  use  of  cannabis  declined  since  the  early  20th 
century  (Pisanti  and  Bifulco,  2017).  Since  the  1990s,  after  the 
endogenous  cannabinoid  (endocannabinoid)  system  was  dis-
covered, scientific studies into medicinal applications (e.g., pain 
relief,  multiple  sclerosis,  and  epilepsy)  have  been  increasing 
again  (Whiting  et  al.,  2015;  Haney  and  Hill,  2018).  Meanwhile, 
the endocannabinoid system is seen as a promising pharmaco-
logical target for the treatment of several diseases, and its rele-
vance for the treatment of PTSD is increasingly studied (Passie 
et al., 2012; Steenkamp et al., 2017; Hindocha et al., 2019). During 
the  last  2  decades,  several  countries  have  legalized  medical 
cannabis. Recently, the World Health Organization proposed re-
scheduling  cannabis  to  allow  for  medical  applications  (Mayor, 
2019).

Therapeutic Rationale
Cannabis  contains  more  than  100  different  cannabinoids,  of 
which  tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC)  and  cannabidiol  (CBD)  are 
the  most  studied  (Berman  et  al.,  2018).  Several  synthetic  can-
nabinoids  such  as  nabilone  and  dronabinol  have  been  devel-
oped  and  studied  as  well  (Freeman  et  al.,  2019).  Cannabinoids 
act  on  the  endocannabinoid  system,  which  plays  a  central 
role  in  emotional  memories  and  is  a  crucial  mediator  of  the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  response  under  stress  (Ney 
et al., 2019). Exposure to chronic stress causes a downregulation 
of  cannabinoid  type  1  receptors  (Morena  et  al.,  2016),  and  sev-
eral PTSD symptoms such as hyperarousal, sleeping problems, 
and  intrusive  memories  seem  to  be  facilitated  by  decreased 
endocannabinoid signaling (Passie et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2018). 
These  findings  support  the  potential  role  of  cannabinoids  for 
the treatment of PTSD.

Cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids differ from other psy-
chedelic compounds in that they are mainly used and studied 
for  the  temporary  relief  of  PTSD  symptoms.  However,  they 
might  hold  potential  for  use  within  a  substance-assisted  psy-
chotherapy model as well. Several cannabinoids, including THC 
and  CBD,  have  shown  the  ability  to  increase  fear  extinction 
(Passie et al., 2012; Rabinak et al., 2013, 2014) and to disrupt fear 
memory  reconsolidation  (Stern  et  al.,  2017). As  fear  extinction 
processes  are  essential  for  successful  exposure  therapy,  and 
as  PTSD  patients  have  shown  poorer  fear  extinction  learning 
and recall than controls (Norrholm et al., 2011; Zuj et al., 2016; 
Ney  et  al.,  2019),  the  efficacy  of  exposure  therapies  could  pos-
sibly be enhanced with the targeted use of cannabis or certain 

cannabinoids. The  acute  psychoactive  effects  of  cannabinoids 
could also offer benefits that might increase engagement in psy-
chotherapy. For example, it has been shown that THC can reduce 
amygdala  reactivity  to  threatening  stimuli  (Phan  et  al.,  2008; 
Passie et al., 2012), an effect that might facilitate the processing 
of traumatic memories.

Setting
Medical  cannabis  and  synthetic  cannabinoids  are  commonly 
prescribed  as  a  take-home  medication  for  daily  use  to  reduce 
PTSD symptoms. As such, cannabinoids are used in a variety of 
contexts. Although cannabinoids have not been studied within a 
substance-assisted psychotherapy model before, it is reasonable 
to assume this might benefit from a similar setting as used with 
other psychedelics, such as MDMA and psilocybin.

Administration
Cannabinoids can be administered by several routes. Synthetic 
cannabinoids are mainly administered orally, but medical can-
nabis is often administered sublingually as an oil or through a 
method of inhalation (e.g., vaporized or smoked). The duration 
of effects depends on the route of administration. The acute ef-
fects of cannabis or cannabinoids last around 6–8 hours when 
taken orally or sublingually and 2–3 hours when inhaled (Akram 
et al., 2019). The dose depends on the particular cannabinoid or 
cannabis  strain  and  on  the  symptoms  and  particular  needs  of 
the  patient.  Cannabinoids  can  be  used  throughout  the  day  or 
just before sleep.

Evidence in the Treatment of PTSD
Several studies have investigated the use of cannabinoids for the 
treatment of PTSD. In 1 study, 5 mg THC (sublingually) was pre-
scribed twice daily as an add-on treatment to 10 outpatient pa-
tients who were taking another stable medication for their PTSD 
symptoms.  A  significant  improvement  in  global  symptom  se-
verity, sleep quality, frequency of nightmares, and hyperarousal 
symptoms  was  found  (Roitman  et  al.,  2014).  However,  these 
results  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  small 
sample size, lack of control group, and interfering other medi-
cations.  The  only  placebo-controlled  study  with  cannabinoids 
for PTSD has been done with nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid 
that  mimics THC. Ten  PTSD  patients  from  the  Canadian  mili-
tary  who  were  experiencing  trauma-related  nightmares  re-
ceived  nabilone  in  a  placebo-controlled  trial  with  a  cross-over 
design.  After  receiving  nabilone  for  7  weeks,  patients  showed 
significantly stronger improvements on the CAPS Recurring and 
Distressing Dream scores, Clinical Global Impression of Change 
scores, and scores of the General Well Being Questionnaire com-
pared with when they received a placebo for 7 weeks (Jetly et al., 
2015).  These  results  confirm  tentative  findings  from  an  open 
label chart review study of nabilone in 47 PTSD patients (Fraser, 
2009) and a retrospective study on 104 male inmates (Cameron 
et al., 2014) in which nabilone had shown beneficial effects on 
several PTSD symptoms, nightmares, and sleeping problems in 
particular.  A  recent  meta-analysis  has  called  for  high-quality 
studies to further examine the effects of cannabinoids on PTSD 
(Black et al., 2019).

Safety and Potential Side Effects
Frequently  reported  side  effects  of  cannabinoids  include  dry 
mouth, dizziness, and fatigue (MacCallum and Russo, 2018). In 
a few cases, nausea and vomiting can occur. Especially if used 
in higher doses, cannabinoids can induce anxiety (Moreira and 

Copyedited by:  

Wotjak, 2009). The use of cannabinoids might be an additional 
risk factor for the development of psychotic disorders in suscep-
tible individuals (Di Forti et al., 2019; Hamilton and Monaghan, 
2019). Frequent recreational use of cannabis has also been asso-
ciated with cognitive deficits, especially in adolescents (Levine 
et  al.,  2017). There  is  an  ongoing  discussion  about  the  persist-
ence  of  such  effects  (Schreiner  and  Dunn,  2012;  Scott  et  al., 
2018). Another potential risk factor is the development of can-
nabis use disorder in vulnerable individuals (Hasin et al., 2016). 
This emphasizes the importance of appropriate screening and 
monitoring of treatment.

Discussion

Exposure-based  psychotherapy  is  unequivocally  designated 
as a first-line treatment for PTSD. Yet, in many cases, PTSD re-
mains a chronic illness, with high rates of psychiatric and med-
ical comorbidity. Therefore, there has been an urgent need for 
novel interventions that can increase the efficacy of PTSD treat-
ments. As this review shows, psychedelic drugs offer opportun-
ities for a novel approach to the treatment of PTSD. Each of the 
reviewed  compounds  provides  a  unique  potential,  from  their 
use to rapidly target the symptoms of PTSD to their use as ad-
juncts to facilitate psychotherapeutic treatments.

MDMA  may  allow  patients  to  experience  reduced  fear  and 
shame, and, at the same time, feelings of trust and safety, often 
of  great  importance  in  complex  PTSD.  This  enables  them  to 
more  easily  revisit  and  process  traumatic  memories  and  gain 
openness and trust. Patients also feel more empathetic and ex-
perience  an  increased  openness  to  new  and  constructive  per-
spectives on their situation. They may experience an increased 
connection to others, changes in views on life values and pur-
poses, and insights into the moral value of traumatic exposures 
or  around  existential  issues.  Integrated  within  a  psychothera-
peutic  treatment,  2  to  3  sessions  with  MDMA  have  shown  the 
ability  to  induce  significant  and  sustained  reductions  in  PTSD 
symptoms (Mithoefer et al., 2019).

Ketamine  has  thus  far  mainly  been  used  as  a  standalone 
treatment  for  PTSD.  Used  this  way,  it  has  shown  the  ability 
to  rapidly  reduce  the  symptoms  of  PTSD  (Feder  et  al.,  2014). 
A single administration of ketamine seems to lead to relatively 
brief reductions in symptoms up to a week, but multiple infu-
sions over the course of several weeks (Albott et al., 2018), or the 
combination  with  psychotherapeutic  interventions  (Pradhan 
et  al.,  2017,  2018),  may  extend  therapeutic  effects. The  proper 
integration  of  ketamine  within  a  substance-assisted  psycho-
therapy  framework  might  hold  promise  for  long-term  effects. 
Moreover, ketamine’s ability to alter memory processes, such as 
increases in fear extinction or the disruption of memory recon-
solidation,  offers  an  exciting  opportunity  for  an  application  in 
combination with exposure therapy (Veen et al., 2018). Currently, 
at  least  2  studies  (NCT03960658;  NCT02727998)  are  exploring 
such an approach.

Classical  psychedelics  such  as  psilocybin  and  LSD  have 
shown promising results for the treatment of a variety of psy-
chiatric indications, but clinical trials focusing on the treatment 
of  PTSD  are  still  lacking.  Observations  from  clinical  use  in  the 
previous century (Leuner, 1981; Bastiaans, 1983; Ossebaard and 
Maalsté,  1999)  and  several  of  their  acute  psychoactive  effects 
suggest a significant potential for treating PTSD. However, their 
partially  unpredictable  psychological  effects  might  not  make 
them the best candidates compared with other substances re-
viewed here. For example, compared with MDMA, their effects 
are more variable and instable and harder to predict and handle. 

Krediet et al. 

|  393

Their  sensitizing  and  affect-intensifying  effects  as  well  as  the 
labilization  of  the  general  psychological  state  could  be  detri-
mental for at least some patients with PTSD. Although the fear 
response  can  also  be  reduced  by  classical  psychedelics,  this 
may be much more dependent on the psychological state of the 
patient. The  psychological  condition  of  many  PTSD  patients  is 
unstable,  and  they  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  increases  in 
anxiety  when  reexperiencing  traumatic  memories,  which  in 
some cases can be amplified by classical psychedelics. Another 
difference from MDMA, which produces a relatively stable pat-
tern of effects, is decreases in the sense of self and self-control. 
While alterations in the sense of self and self-control are mild 
with  MDMA,  classical  psychedelics  can  reduce  ego  integrity 
and  self-control  more  strongly,  although  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner.

For these reasons, classical psychedelics might have less po-
tential  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  than  MDMA. Their  potential 
might  be  maximized  by  a  stringent  patient  selection,  the  use 
of lower doses, and specifically structured settings. In addition, 
clinical  observations  suggest  that  classical  psychedelics  may 
be more easily and effectively handled after patients have pre-
viously  experienced  MDMA  (Gasser,  1996;  Passie,  2012).  MDMA 
can help patients experience an altered state of consciousness 
with  reduced  anxiety  and  an  only  mildly  altered  sense  of  self, 
which could help patients to become accustomed to an altered 
state  of  consciousness  before  a  classical  psychedelic  might  be 
considered. However, there has not been any formal research on 
such an approach.

Cannabinoids  have  mainly  been  used  for  the  symptomatic 
treatment of PTSD. The only placebo-controlled trial has focused 
on the use of nabilone and demonstrated efficacy for treatment 
of insomnia and nightmares (Jetly et al., 2015). However, larger 
RCTs  into  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  cannabinoids  (and  whole 
plant cannabis in particular) are necessary. There are important 
unknowns regarding dose, cannabinoid ratios, routes of admin-
istration,  long-term  risks,  and  side  effects.  Some  clinical  trials 
are  currently  being  conducted  (NCT02759185;  NCT02517424) 
in  which  different  strains  of  medical  cannabis—with  varying 
ratios  of  THC  and  CBD—are  compared  for  treatment  efficacy 
and safety in PTSD. As some cannabinoids have shown similar 
effects  on  extinction  learning  and  memory  reconsolidation  as 
other psychedelics (Rabinak et al., 2013, 2014; Stern et al., 2017), 
they might hold promise for the use within a substance-assisted 
psychotherapy framework as well.

PTSD  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for 
developing  cannabis  use  disorder  in  some  cases  (Hasin  et  al., 
2016). Such extensive use of cannabis may have negative effects 
on PTSD symptoms (e.g., Bonn-Miller et al., 2013; Wilkinson et al., 
2015). A possible explanation is that cannabis use can serve as 
a way to avoid unpleasant experiences (Bonn-Miller et al., 2007; 
Bordieri  et  al.,  2014). Whether  such  use  should  be  classified  as 
problematic or as self-medication probably depends on the spe-
cific  circumstances  of  each  unique  case.  Chronic  use  of  high 
amounts  of  cannabis  has  also  been  associated  with  reduced 
fear extinction learning (Papini et al., 2017). Although monitored 
prescription  of  medical  cannabis  in  controlled  dosages  cannot 
be compared with excessive unsupervised use of cannabis from 
unknown  sources,  this  does  call  for  caution  when  prescribing 
cannabinoids on a daily basis. In such cases, close monitoring of 
the treatment is advised.

From  the  substances  reviewed  in  the  present  paper,  only 
cannabinoids  have  been  studied  as  a  take-home  prescription 
for  daily  symptom  control.  In  contrast,  MDMA,  ketamine,  and 
classical psychedelics are only administered in a clinical setting 

394

under  direct  supervision  of  a  clinician,  while  patients  with 
certain  medical  or  psychological  risk  factors  (e.g.,  high  blood 
pressure, history of psychosis or bipolar disorder) are excluded 
through  a  specific  screening  process. When  administered  this 
way, using proper treatment and safety protocols, risks can be 
easily controlled (Johnson et al., 2018; Mithoefer et al., 2019).

The  use  of  psychedelic  compounds  within  a  substance-
assisted  psychotherapy  framework  offers  a  novel  method  for 
the integration of pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies. As 
shown  in  this  review,  these  substances  may  increase  engage-
ment  with  and  the  effectiveness  of  psychotherapeutic  inter-
ventions  due  to  a  variety  of  psychological  and  neurobiological 
effects, such as an increased capacity for emotional and cogni-
tive processing through pharmacologically diminished fear and 
arousal,  increased  insightfulness  and  introspection,  strength-
ened therapeutic alliance through increased trust and rapport, 
increases in synaptic plasticity, or by targeting processes of fear 
extinction and memory consolidation.

The  quest  for  optimization  of  these  methods  opens  new 
areas for clinical and scientific exploration. One such area is the 
implementation of psychedelics in different psychotherapeutic 
treatment  modalities.  Most  of  the  recent  studies  have  used  a 
relatively nondirective approach during drug sessions in which 
therapists  follow  each  patients’  unique  unfolding  inner  pro-
cess. It has yet to be tested whether more directive approaches, 
such  as  cognitive  processing  therapy,  prolonged  exposure,  or 
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, could also be 
used when patients are under the influence of psychedelics like 
MDMA or psilocybin.

Which therapeutic approach is the most appropriate might 
be dependent on several variables. For example, the use of keta-
mine  or  classical  psychedelics  in  a  dose  that  is  high  enough 
to significantly decrease the sense of self might benefit from a 
more nondirective approach, while the use of a lower dose that 
keeps the sense of self sufficiently intact for verbal interaction 
could potentially benefit from more directive psychotherapeutic 
approaches.  Another  variable  to  consider  is  the  timing  of  the 
psychotherapeutic  intervention  relative  to  the  administration 
of the psychedelic drug. During the acute drug effects, patients 
might  benefit  from  particularly  nondirective  methods  of  psy-
chotherapeutic  interventions  and  support,  while  there  could 
be more flexibility in the use of directive and nondirective ap-
proaches in the sessions before the administration of a psyche-
delic drug, when the acute effects of the drug are diminishing, or 
during sessions in the days and weeks following administration.
An  example  of  a  mixed  approach  is  the  combination  of 
MDMA  with  cognitive  behavioral  conjoint  therapy  for  PTSD 
(CBCT; Monson and Fredman, 2012), a therapeutic approach in 
which  a  PTSD  patient’s  close  relatives  are  directly  involved  in 
the  treatment. Adding  MDMA  sessions  to  this  approach  could 
be particularly useful, as MDMA has shown to increase empathy 
(Kuypers  et  al.,  2017)  and  interpersonal  trust  (Schmid  et  al., 
2014). A pilot study on this approach added 2 MDMA sessions to 
CBCT during which the patient took the drug together with their 
partner. The nondrug sessions followed the relatively structured 
and directive CBCT protocol, while the MDMA sessions followed 
a more nondirective approach. Preliminary results of this study 
suggest that this is a promising approach (Wagner et al., 2019).

Other  psychotherapeutic  approaches  that  are  increasingly 
being  explored  for  the  use  in  combination  with  psychedelic 
drugs are third-wave therapies such as acceptance commitment 
therapy (Walsh and Thiessen, 2018). These third-wave therapies 
represent a movement away from challenging or changing the 

content of internal experiences towards nonjudgmental accept-
ance of such experiences by emphasizing experiential methods. 
As  Walsh  and  Thiessen  (2018)  report,  these  novel  approaches 
are informed by concepts and practices that are rooted in con-
templative spiritual practices and share potential mechanisms 
with  acute  effects  of  psychedelic  drugs,  including  enhanced 
mindfulness, decentering, emotion regulation, and distress tol-
erance. These  are  all  important  elements  for  the  treatment  of 
PTSD. Exploring the use of psychedelic drugs within these new 
approaches might open a range of new possibilities to improve 
the efficacy of PTSD treatments.

To  increase  our  understanding  of  the  use  of  psychedelic 
drugs  in  the  treatment  of  PTSD,  we  will  lay  out  an  agenda  for 
future research. It is essential to generate more data regarding 
the safety and efficacy of psychedelics and to identify patients 
for  whom  these  treatments  might  be  indicated  and  effective. 
Contraindications in respect to specific symptom constellations 
and/or personality dispositions are another important area for 
research. There  also  is  a  need  for  an  increased  understanding 
of the diverse psychological states that these psychedelic com-
pounds can induce from both a clinical and neurobiological per-
spective. These new studies will allow us to better understand 
putative biological mechanisms of action as well as to evaluate 
how these changes may augment the psychotherapeutic treat-
ment  of  PTSD. The  effects  of  these  drugs,  and  neurobiological 
data  obtained  before  and  after  treatment,  may  prompt  a  re-
verse translation to the biology of PTSD and increase our under-
standing  of  specific  neurotransmitter  trajectories  and  brain 
circuits involved in this approach to treatment and in recovery 
(DePierro et al., 2019; Heifets and Malenka, 2019). We also need 
to deepen our understanding of the role of psychotherapy and 
the setting in which these compounds are being administered 
to  maximize  safety  and  efficacy.  In  addition  to  considering 
their clinical efficacy, research on cost-effectiveness is required. 
Substance-assisted  psychotherapy  can  be  an  expensive  inter-
vention, especially in terms of therapist time. Therefore, efficacy 
studies  should  include  a  health  economic  evaluation  to  allow 
informed  future  choices  to  be  made  with  respect  to  funding 
and adoption by clinical services. Moreover, it will be important 
to  consider  where  in  the  treatment  trajectory  these  therapies 
might potentially be indicated and whether they should only be 
considered for treatment-resistant patients or also as first-line 
treatments. Lastly, there will be a need for specialized therapist 
training  and  supervision  to  work  safely  and  effectively  with 
these compounds and the complex psychological states they in-
duce. If these drugs will be approved for use in licensed centers, 
they will require a new mental health care infrastructure that is 
capable of administering powerful psychoactive substances and 
integrating the intense inner experiences they produce.

When  properly  applied,  according  to  published  treatment 
manuals,  new  models  of  substance-assisted  psychotherapy 
may  offer  a  valuable  contribution  to  the  spectrum  of  existing 
pharmacological  and  psychotherapeutic  treatments  for  PTSD. 
These  interventions  may  not  easily  become  a  first-line  treat-
ment  anytime  soon,  as  they  require  specific  expertise  and  en-
vironments, but they may boost explorations to implementing 
novel  approaches  to  mental  health  infrastructures.  For  the 
large number of patients for whom PTSD has become a chronic 
illness, these approaches can be of immense value. If success-
fully implemented, many patients with PTSD could potentially 
recover, and the availability of psychedelics could herald a new 
era in the evidence-based care options that are available to pa-
tients with PTSD.
