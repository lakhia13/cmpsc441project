Abstract
Psychological well-being, characterized by feelings, cognitions, and strategies that are associated with positive functioning 
(including hedonic and eudaimonic well-being), has been linked with better physical health and greater longevity. Importantly, 
psychological well-being can be strengthened with interventions, providing a strategy for improving population health. But 
are the effects of well-being interventions meaningful, durable, and scalable enough to improve health at a population-level? 
To assess this possibility, a cross-disciplinary group of scholars convened to review current knowledge and develop a research 
agenda. Here we summarize and build on the key insights from this convening, which were: (1) existing interventions should 
continue to be adapted to achieve a large-enough effect to result in downstream improvements in psychological functioning 
and health, (2) research should determine the durability of interventions needed to drive population-level and lasting changes, 
(3) a shift from individual-level care and treatment to a public-health model of population-level prevention is needed and 
will require new infrastructure that can deliver interventions at scale, (4) interventions should be accessible and effective in 
racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse samples. A discussion examining the key future research questions follows.

Numerous  studies  have  documented  a  rise  in  deaths  of 
despair, deaths arising from suicide, drug overdose, and 
alcoholism (Case & Deaton, 2015). Despite the recogni-
tion of the critical interplay between mental and physical 
health, much research has focused on risk factors and defi-
cits. Recent work, however, suggests the enormous value of 
examining positive health assets as well (Kubzansky et al., 
2018; VanderWeele et al., 2020). Psychological well-being, 
characterized by feelings, cognitions, and strategies that are 
associated with positive functioning (including hedonic and 
eudaimonic well-being), is important in its own right, but 
accumulating evidence suggests it also uniquely contributes

to better physical health and longer lives (Kubzansky et al., 
2018;  Levine  et  al., 2021;  Ryff, 2014;  Seligman, 2008; 
Steptoe, 2019; VanderWeele, 2017).1 For example, a 2017 
meta-analysis of 76 prospective studies found higher levels 
of optimism, sense of purpose in life, positive affect, and life 
satisfaction are consistently associated with reduced mortal-
ity risk (Martín-María et al., 2017). An emerging literature 
has identified potential underlying mechanisms including 
reductions in harmful health behaviors (e.g., cigarette smok-
ing, physical inactivity, poor diet) and biological processes 
(e.g., elevated inflammation) through which psychological 
well-being leads to health benefits (J. K. Boehm et al., 2018; 
Feig et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2019; Kubzansky et al., 2018; 
Ryff, 2014; Seligman, 2008; VanderWeele, 2017).

1  We note ongoing discussion about terminology; the workshop was 
convened using the term “psychological well-being.” However, since 
the convening, investigators have proposed using the term “emotional 
well-being” when discussing a similar construct. For the current arti-
cle, we continue using the term “psychological well-being” as this is 
the  term  used  in  the  convening,  but  refer  readers  to  the  article  Park 
et al., 2023, describing the use of the term “emotional well-being.”.

Because various dimensions of psychological well-being 
can be modified (Carr et al., 2021), investigators have pro-
posed interventions targeting psychological well-being as 
one strategy for improving physical health in both the gen-
eral population and individuals with medical conditions 
(van Agteren et al., 2021). However, such proposals rely on 
the assumption that these factors are not only modifiable, 
but also meaningful, durable, and scalable. To explore the 
exciting possibility that psychological well-being interven-
tions can also contribute to improving population health, the 
Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health hosted a 2-day 
cross-disciplinary workshop, “Interventions to Modify Psy-
chological Well-Being: What Works, What Doesn’t Work, 
and an Agenda for Future Research.”

This workshop builds on prior work in the Science of 
Behavior Change (SOBC). Starting in 2009, researchers 
in the SOBC network developed an understanding of how 
to create and sustain effective change in adaptive health 
behaviors such as diet, exercise, and medication adherence 
(Nielsen et al., 2018). The SOBC approach follows four 
steps: (1) identify the hypothesized mechanism underlying 
behavior change, (2) measure it accurately and precisely, 
(3) influence or intervene to impact the mechanism, and (4) 
evaluate if the intervention-induced changes in the mecha-
nism translates into behavior change. Our workshop focused 
on psychological well-being as one mechanism that may be 
harnessed to drive behavior change, as well as to trigger 
other biobehavioral changes that lead to improved physi-
cal health. In addition, we noted that the SOBC principles 
outlined for changing behaviors can be applied to changing 
psychological well-being itself. Our overarching aim was 
to create a research agenda for developing and evaluating 
scalable psychological well-being interventions that are suf-
ficiently powerful to improve physical health at the popula-
tion level.

The workshop began with a recognition that subjective 
interpretations of well-being have generally been consid-
ered in the context of hedonic (i.e., involving pleasure and 
happiness) or eudaimonic (i.e., involving optimal psycho-
logical functioning and self-realization) well-being (Keyes 
et al., 2002). Workshop attendees noted that psychological 
well-being is separate from states of psychological distress 
and related disorders (e.g., absence of anxiety does not nec-
essarily equate to high levels of joy and meaning). Thus, 
interventions designed to enhance psychological well-being 
need to go beyond simply reducing symptoms of psycho-
logical distress, and evaluation of these interventions should 
reflect this understanding; additionally, researchers should 
separate boosts in psychological well-being from decreases 
in distress by including and measuring both outcomes care-
fully. Attendees presented examples of interventions with 
documented success in modifying psychological well-being 

and then considered a set of related issues, including the 
magnitude of effect sizes from well-being interventions and 
whether these reflect changes in psychological well-being 
that are large enough to influence downstream health behav-
iors and processes, the scaling of interventions, barriers to 
developing durable and scalable interventions, and strategies 
that might overcome these barriers. Below, we summarize 
insights from the convening.

Summary of the Workshop

The workshop included presentations around select inter-
ventions with demonstrated effects on psychological well-
being. For example, Eric Loucks presented his work on 
mindfulness-based interventions, oriented toward the ques-
tion of what allows people to make shifts in life to promote 
psychological and physical well-being (Loucks et al., 2019, 
2022). Specifically, he described mindfulness-based stress 
reduction (MBSR) techniques tested in clinical trials, which 
showed that MBSR leads to improved psychological well-
being (de Vibe et al., 2017) and physical health as demon-
strated in more recent studies among medical populations 
(Loucks et al., 2019). Richard Davidson described findings 
demonstrating that mindfulness-based interventions can 
affect neuroplasticity and epigenetics and suggested these 
biological alterations can elucidate whether and how MBSR 
leads to improved physical health (Chaix et al., 2020; David-
son & McEwen, 2012). Further, based on epigenetic find-
ings, he raised the intriguing possibility of intergenerational 
transmission of well-being, which could be viewed as a par-
ticularly durable intervention effect.

Jeff Huffman, Judy Moskowitz, and Sonja Lyubomirsky 
each discussed their research on positive psychological inter-
ventions (PPIs)—interventions that explicitly target psycho-
logical well-being (Fritz & Lyubomirsky, 2018; Lyubomir-
sky & Layous, 2013). Meta-analyses of PPIs demonstrate 
these interventions have consistent, albeit relatively mod-
est, effects on psychological well-being (Carr et al., 2021; 
Koydemir et al., 2021; van Agteren et al., 2021). However, 
evidence that PPIs may ultimately influence physical health 
outcomes is more limited, likely due to time and budget con-
straints that restrict studies to relatively brief follow-up time 
and smaller sample sizes which can make it more difficult to 
detect effects on many more distal physical health outcomes.
Katey Warran discussed research on the role of arts-
based interventions in improving health and well-being. 
Drawing  on  the  2019  WHO  Health  Evidence  Network 
synthesis report, Warran defined arts activities as includ-
ing performing arts activities, visual arts participation, 
literature engagement, digital arts activities, and cultural 
engagement (e.g., going to museums and galleries). She 
characterized the evidence regarding the benefits of the 

1 3176 

Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184

arts as substantial and described numerous observational 
studies that have demonstrated an arts-health association. 
To illustrate, she described a study that showed engaging 
in arts activities was associated with reduced depression 
(Bone et al., 2022). She further noted that arts activities 
are considered complex interventions because they com-
bine multiple components to initiate non-linear mecha-
nisms of action that influence mental and physical health 
outcomes (Fancourt et al., 2021; Warran et al., 2022).

Tyler VanderWeele provided an overview of forgive-
ness interventions (Wade & Tittler, 2019). VanderWeele 
modified existing interventions for large-scale application 
(i.e., distilling established protocols into a 2–3-h work-
book that can be administered on-line or in-person) and 
to global audiences (e.g., Indonesia or South Africa). Cur-
rent research suggests these interventions lead to increased 
forgiveness and hope, as well as reduced depression and 
anxiety  (VanderWeele,  2018;  Wade  &  Tittler,  2019). 
VanderWeele further noted that forgiveness interventions 
may also lead to higher community levels of forgiveness, 
which could contribute to healing community and political 
divides. However, research has not yet established whether 
these interventions are sufficiently potent to induce subse-
quent changes in physical health. Given the potential ease 
of disseminating forgiveness workbooks, such interven-
tions may have an important role in promoting population 
health (VanderWeele, 2018).

Noting  that  numerous  effective  interventions  already 
exist, Stephen Schueller expressed concern that transla-
tion into widespread dissemination has been slow. He sug-
gested progress will require moving beyond repeated pilot 
and efficacy trials toward greater investment in implemen-
tation. Such efforts should include identifying facilitators 
and barriers to successful implementation across contexts 
and then using this information to inform the design and 
evaluation of effective implementation strategies (Bauer & 
Kirchner, 2020). The research agenda for PPIs should con-
sider stage of evidence to determine unanswered questions 
in implementation (Lane-Fall et al., 2019) and use appro-
priate study designs to explore these questions (Wolfenden 
et al., 2021). Schueller further noted that mode of deliv-
ery is important when implementing scaled-up versions of 
interventions. Promising approaches include digital delivery, 
single-session interventions, and micro-interventions (i.e., 
highly focused low-burden brief interventions delivered in 
the context of a person’s daily life; Baumel et al., 2020; Hir-
shberg et al., 2022).

Based on the workshop discussions, we see several excit-
ing directions for research to provide greater insight into 
whether and how we might create scalable interventions to 
modify psychological well-being in ways sufficiently pow-
erful to influence downstream health outcomes. In the fol-
lowing section, we highlight four key topics, then discuss 

additional substantive issues that emerged, and conclude 
with thoughts on the future.

1) What Are Meaningful Effect Sizes?

Many existing interventions rely on either “light-touch” brief 
activities (e.g., writing a gratitude journal) or more intensive 
delivery methods (e.g., positive psychotherapy, meditation 
training; J. Boehm et al., 2012). Whereas “light-touch” inter-
ventions are more scalable, it remains unclear if they have 
sufficiently durable or potent effects to catalyze meaningful 
improvements in downstream health endpoints. A recent sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of interventions designed 
to improve psychological well-being considered not only 
PPIs developed within the field of positive psychology but 
also non-PPIs such as mindfulness meditation and more tra-
ditional therapeutic approaches (van Agteren et al., 2021). 
The review found psychological well-being can be enhanced 
across varied interventions and effects differed according 
to target population (e.g., general population versus physi-
cally ill patients) and, most notably, intervention intensity 
(e.g., multi-component versus single element interventions). 
Less well studied is how large an increase in psychological 
well-being is needed to observe meaningful downstream 
effects on physical health, and this likely depends on which 
physical health outcomes are considered. Moreover, attend-
ees suggested large samples may be needed to detect effects 
in randomized trials, particularly if intervention effects on 
psychological well-being and subsequent effects on physical 
health are both modest.

Important to note is that whereas meta-analyses show 
promising average effect sizes, effects are also highly het-
erogeneous. Understanding the heterogeneity of effects (e.g., 
where and with whom each intervention works) is critical 
for assessing whether any given effect appears small because 
interventions were incorrectly targeted to some subgroups 
or did not fully account for the context in which they occur. 
Without understanding this heterogeneity, it is difficult to 
appropriately power studies.

Ultimately, workshop attendees noted that even if changes 
in psychological well-being lead only to small changes in 
downstream behaviors and physical health, such effects are 
still valuable—especially if the interventions are easy to 
deploy, scale, and adopt at the population level. Given most 
health outcomes are multiply determined, any one variable 
likely contributes only modestly. For example, associations 
between aspirin and prevention of heart attacks (r = 0.03) 
or cardiac patient education and exercise (r = 0.09) appear 
small (Götz et al., 2022). However, these interventions are 
important because small effect sizes translate into meaning-
ful changes at the population level under particular circum-
stances (e.g., if many small effects act in concert to create 

1 3Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184 

177

larger substantive composite effects) or as they accumulate 
across the lifespan (Götz et al., 2022).

The impact of PPIs also differs depending on context. 
Investigators must carefully consider the population under 
study and the social environment in which interventions are 
implemented (Bryan et al., 2021). A new “moderation as 
mediation” framework illustrates how contextual factors 
can act like a switch that turns mechanistic pathways on or 
off. For example, one study examined effects of a growth 
mindset intervention (i.e., bolstering beliefs that abilities are 
learnable and can be improved through effort) delivered to 
students on their math performance. Investigators first evalu-
ated teachers’ mindsets. If a teacher believed that abilities 
are inherently stable and unchangeable, then the effect of 
growth mindset interventions on students’ math GPAs was 
minimal. However, when teachers themselves had a growth 
mindset, then the intervention successfully enhanced stu-
dents’ performance (Yeager et al., 2022).

2) How Durable Are Effects of Psychological 
Well‑Being Interventions?

If psychological well-being influences physical health, it is 
likely because relevant psychological states are enduring and 
thereby lead to recurring effects on health-relevant habits 
and biological processes. Interventions seeking to change 
psychological well-being sufficiently to impact downstream 
biobehavioral processes related to physical health will need 
to produce sustained effects. However, durability of effects 
is less well-understood (Miller et al., 2017). In one of the 
largest meta-analyses of PPIs, most studies tracked outcomes 
for < 6 months and none for > 12 months (Carr et al., 2021). 
Thus, it remains unclear if effects of PPIs are sustained over 
periods long enough to lead to changes in physical health. 
Moreover, studies including longer follow-up time will need 
to consider carefully how to capture the durability of inter-
vention effects, including deciding how and at what inter-
vals investigators should measure changes in psychological 
well-being, as well as how to retain study participants over 
longer periods.

Several substantive issues are also relevant. First, inves-
tigators should evaluate whether interventions create a habit 
(e.g., teach skills that become habitual to repeatedly boost 
effects over time) or crystallize a new way of thinking (e.g., 
“wise interventions” that target psychological processes con-
tributing to core underlying thought processes and recur-
sive dynamics that compound over time; Cohen et al., 2017; 
Miller et al., 2017; Walton & Wilson, 2018).

Second, developmental theory suggests there are points in 
the life course when exposures to certain risk factors are par-
ticularly harmful (i.e., sensitive periods like before a major 
life transition), and also when health interventions may be 

most effective (Bailey et al., 2020; Berkman, 2009; Meyer 
et al., 2012). Scholars should seek to identify these optimal 
points or “signature moments.” Of note, optimal timing for 
delivering interventions may also depend on which facet of 
psychological well-being is targeted. For example, purpose 
in life interventions might be particularly helpful during 
identity development, “midlife crises,” and retirement—
destabilizing periods due to the many substantial changes 
in life patterns; at such times, developing or re-discovering 
a sense of purpose may mitigate potential derailment.

Third, if psychological well-being interventions need 
repeated administration for durable effects, it will be impor-
tant to embed these interventions into systems and social 
practices. For example, clear evidence that psychological 
well-being interventions enhance health and reduce health-
care costs motivate healthcare systems to adopt and maintain 
these interventions. To facilitate development of sustainable 
financing models we might encourage creating healthcare 
system classification codes that facilitate tracking and reim-
bursement of evidence-based interventions.

3) Delivery and Scalability of Psychological 
Well‑Being Interventions

Psychological well-being interventions that demonstrate 
the strongest effects are often complex (involving multiple 
components), time-intensive to deliver, and require in-per-
son attendance. Moreover, following a biomedical model, 
many psychological well-being interventions target individu-
als who are either high-risk or already have disease. A key 
activity for future work following a public health model of 
prevention is to determine if existing labor-intensive inter-
ventions developed in medically high-risk populations can 
be adapted for use in the general population and delivered 
at a manageable cost. Investigators will also want to con-
sider whether existing “light-touch” interventions, which 
are easier to deliver on a larger scale but often demonstrate 
smaller (and perhaps less durable) effects on psychologi-
cal well-being, can be modified to enhance both size and 
durability of effects. Some work suggests rigorously opti-
mized simpler interventions can have more durable effects, 
including findings from studies of single session interven-
tions (Schleider & Weisz, 2016). Attendees also noted that 
“light-touch” interventions targeting domains like a sense of 
belonging and academic performance have shown large and 
durable effects (e.g., lasting 6–11 years; Brady et al., 2020; 
Goyer et al., 2017). Important next steps include linking 
these interventions to physical health.

One possible concern with shifting intervention work to 
the general population is that healthy individuals may be 
less likely to participate as they are not motivated by a spe-
cific illness or problem that needs attention. By anticipating 

1 3178 

Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184

this potential concern ahead of time, those who deliver the 
intervention should carefully consider how to present these 
interventions to the public. Further, when conducting inter-
ventions in healthy populations, the metric of health would 
not be survival or improvement in disease status, but rather 
delayed onset of disease, a more difficult outcome to capture, 
especially in the short term.

These concerns notwithstanding, workshop attendees 
noted the COVID-19 pandemic spurred development of 
innovative methods of synchronous and asynchronous inter-
vention delivery that can now be leveraged to advance the 
field. Discussions around scalability often focus on the role 
of technology (e.g., smart watches, app-based delivery), 
and the COVID-19 pandemic drove wider adoption of these 
methods. Examples from behavioral health can inform think-
ing on how to scale PPIs. For example, a successful treat-
ment for individuals with substance use disorders relied on 
administering cognitive behavioral therapy. While effective, 
delivering the intervention widely was not feasible due to 
high cost. A computerized version of the intervention was 
developed, and subsequent evaluations found it was equally 
as effective as in-person delivery (Carroll et al., 2009, 2014). 
Other exciting possibilities for digital interventions were 
also  identified.  For  example,  workshop  attendees  noted 
micro-interventions that sprinkle 30–90 s doses of interven-
tion content throughout the day via mobile devices should 
be further evaluated.

Our  discussion  also  highlighted  potential  pitfalls  of 
these intervention dissemination methods. Barriers to quit-
ting digitally delivered interventions are lower, resulting in 
higher drop-out. A recent review of mental health app usage 
by people in the real world observed that across 93 men-
tal health apps, median retention rate at 15 days was 3.9% 
(Baumel et al., 2019). Newer methods of enhancing reten-
tion have somewhat improved these numbers. For example, 
one study of a game implementing mental health therapy in 
real-world conditions (7,782 users) reported 10% retention 
at 15 days which was a doubling of the previously reported 
retention rates. Despite this improvement, it is still the case 
that 90% of those who started therapy were not retained 
(Ferguson et al., 2021). Moreover, participants who drop 
out are often those who are most in need of the intervention 
or who are the least motivated, so failure to retain them can 
produce a biased understanding of efficacy. Digital formats 
may also render it more difficult to deploy features demon-
strated to promote continued engagement in interventions, 
such as developing relationships with participants. Finally, 
some interventions may not translate easily to digital formats 
resulting in a loss of their potency.

Workshop attendees reiterated the value of creating a 
“science of engagement” to help identify not only different 
profiles of intervention participants (digital or otherwise) 
but also an accounting of active ingredients and optimal 

dosages that work best for different individuals. Investiga-
tors should consider when and how interventions can incor-
porate elements of fun to promote retention and continued 
engagement. For all modes of intervention, interpersonal 
connection or “human touch” is likely critical for promot-
ing and maintaining engagement. Investigators should con-
sider how they might embed interventions into the existing 
infrastructure of relationships individuals already have. For 
example, studies could capitalize on existing social relation-
ships to enhance social support, collaboration, or competi-
tion (e.g., Patel et al., 2021). Additionally, in the realm of 
healthcare, researchers might work with general practition-
ers, nurses, or social workers who could then provide their 
clients with strategies to improve psychological well-being 
(see Kubzansky et al., 2018). This type of engagement could 
lower participation barriers for people who are less digitally 
connected.

4) Do Psychological Well‑Being Interventions 
Work in Diverse Populations and Settings?

Tailoring and contextualizing interventions for minoritized 
and underserved populations are critical. The same inter-
vention may work differently depending on gender, race, 
ethnicity, and other characteristics of the population. Inter-
ventions are less often tested in disadvantaged individuals 
including those with severe financial constraints, limited 
access to technology, or extreme time scarcity. Interventions 
developed for individuals who are already ill may need sub-
stantial adaptation (or simply not apply) for use with healthy 
individuals for whom the ultimate goal is to prevent illness. 
Interventions can backfire when administered in settings and 
populations for which assigned activities have poor “fit.” For 
example, gratitude interventions can be problematic when 
delivered to members of cultures where gratitude is expe-
rienced as indebtedness or guilt, or to severely depressed 
individuals, for whom expressions of gratitude can increase 
feelings of being a burden on others (Fritz & Lyubomirsky, 
2018).

Prior to implementing any intervention on a large scale, 
investigators should gain as much insight as possible into the 
populations targeted for intervention. One strategy for doing 
this might be to conduct pre-implementation focus groups 
with members of the community and other key stakehold-
ers; these can provide critical information regarding fit of 
a planned intervention with the target population. Admin-
istrative data (i.e., zipcode, neighborhood characteristics) 
and more detailed individual-level data may also be needed 
to design interventions that are appropriate and relevant. 
Efforts to obtain this kind of information are particularly 
important  when  developing  interventions  for  tradition-
ally minoritized or underserved groups for whom fewer 

1 3Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184 

179

interventions have been developed, and whose needs are less 
well understood by most investigators. To ensure interven-
tions are both effective and sustainable, investigators will 
need to work directly with these groups through an iterative 
process to create protocols and principles that most directly 
serve the group’s needs (Hernandez et al., 2016, 2018; Lau, 
2006).

Investigators will also need to move away from conveni-
ence samples and use varied strategies to increase the like-
lihood that individuals in specific populations participate. 
A key approach will be to develop novel ways to integrate 
interventions into everyday contexts and develop partner-
ships with institutions like schools, workplaces, or healthcare 
settings. Other possibilities include implementing interven-
tions through partnerships with health insurance companies 
or other organizations (e.g., older adult advocacy groups like 
AARP). Such partnerships may increase the sustainability of 
interventions for continued implementation in the real world. 
Several workshop attendees provided examples of success-
ful partnerships. For example, effective interventions devel-
oped and tested in the Army (e.g., Army Wellness Centers) 
have had broad reach across soldiers, their family members, 
retirees, and others. However, non-academic partners may 
have the sense that researchers are less interested in taking 
the time to gain the expertise and competence needed to 
work with specific groups or on questions that are of direct 
interest to the community. For academics, it can be difficult 
to ensure sufficient rigor and transparency in the research, 
advance scientific knowledge in non-proprietary ways, and 
align timelines with their non-academic partners.

Additional Research Issues

Several cross-cutting research issues were also identified. A 
key debate is the conceptualization and measurement of psy-
chological well-being, as well as the content and contours of 
psychological well-being relative to other factors (see EWB 
article this issue). It will be important to seek consistency in 
outcome assessment across studies (Moskowitz et al., 2021). 
Second, researchers might consider identifying a core set of 
well-being questions that can be applied consistently across 
studies. This would make it easier to compare results for dif-
ferent interventions conducted in different populations and 
settings. Another way to enhance comparability across stud-
ies is to harness the “megastudy” experimental paradigm, 
in a massive field experiment where many different treat-
ments are tested synchronously in one large sample using 
a common, objectively measured outcome. For example, a 
consortium of 30 scientists from 15 different universities 
worked in small independent teams to design and test a total 
of 54 unique digital interventions aimed at promoting gym 
attendance among 61,293 members of an American fitness 

chain (Milkman et al., 2021). This experimental paradigm 
has several advantages including: (1) the ability to compare 
diverse interventions in an “apples-to-apples” manner by 
reducing the inherent heterogeneity that arises when stud-
ies are conducted independently, (2) enabling economies of 
scale, and (3) accelerating the pace of science (e.g., enhanc-
ing the ability to publish null results).

Third, creating optimal control groups presents signifi-
cant challenges (Freedland et al., 2011). It is often difficult to 
create an activity for the control group that permits isolating 
the active ingredient of an intervention. For example, a study 
aiming to demonstrate that engaging in prosocial acts leads 
to improved psychological well-being would need to assess 
if prosociality per se is the active ingredient, versus simply 
engaging in a social activity (Regan et al., In Press). An 
appropriate control activity would have participants perform 
acts that are social but not prosocial; however, identifying 
clear boundaries between similar activities can be difficult.
Fourth, managing expectations in control groups is criti-
cal, as is measuring participant beliefs and expectations to 
understand how intervention and control procedures are 
received (Haeck et al., 2016). To make these more nuanced 
comparisons, larger samples are often needed, but this raises 
additional dilemmas regarding resource allocation. It may 
not be clear if comparing an intervention to a sham interven-
tion or active control is better than running competing inter-
ventions against each other to establish which is more effec-
tive (Hameiri & Moore-Berg, 2022). For example, one study 
compared effects of a PPI (i.e., writing about three things 
that went well each day, for seven days) with a positive pla-
cebo (i.e., writing about a positive memory for seven days) 
and found no difference in depression between the interven-
tion and placebo, although some differences in happiness 
were evident (Mongrain & Anselmo-Matthews, 2012). One 
challenge with this comparison is that writing about a posi-
tive memory may also be considered a PPI. More broadly, 
this work suggests the importance of carefully considering 
the content of control conditions that allow for differentiat-
ing between positive interventions and positive expectancies.
A fifth issue relates to whether and which specific dimen-
sions of psychological well-being should be targeted when 
aiming to enhance physical health. A recent narrative review 
evaluated articles examining various facets of well-being in 
relation to mortality, including only those that featured large 
sample sizes with robust adjustment for covariates; purpose 
in life, optimism, and life satisfaction were most consist-
ently associated with reduced mortality risk, independent 
of covariates, followed by ikigai, positive affect, mastery, 
and sense of coherence (Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 2021). The 
review found inconsistent relationships of mortality with 
happiness, personal growth, and autonomy, or there was 
too little research to draw firm conclusions. Ideally, future 
research will be able to include these facets within the same 

1 3180 

Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184

study and then compare effect estimates of each dimension 
of psychological well-being on the health outcome of inter-
est to determine if some dimensions should be prioritized for 
intervention. Future research might also consider whether 
dimensions of psychological well-being that have not yet 
been considered in relation to physical health (e.g., self-
acceptance, joy, awe) are promising (Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 
2021). In fact, with regard to interventions seeking to modify 
psychological well-being, many studies have targeted overall 
well-being non-specifically (e.g., via cash transfers; Dwyer 
& Dunn, 2022; Kushlev et al., 2020; McGuire et al., 2022). 
Whether gains achieved by improving a specific facet of 
psychological well-being in relation to physical health are 
greater than simply aiming to improve overall well-being 
(or any single facet) has not yet been determined. However, 
some research suggests that targeted approaches may be 
more effective (Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 2021).

Sixth, it is also critical to evaluate mechanisms by which 
interventions lead to improved psychological well-being. 
Studies may want to consider repeated assessments of psy-
chological states over time as well as measures of poten-
tial mediators or explanatory factors to facilitate tests of 
mediation. Recent work suggests the value of considering 
dynamic processes as mechanisms or pathways. For exam-
ple, a recent paper identified a set of dynamic psychosocial 
processes through which PPIs may enhance psychological 
well-being, including: (1) attention and awareness, (2) com-
prehension and coping, (3) emotions, (4) goals and habits, 
and (5) virtues and relationships (Rusk & Waters, 2015). 
Such work can guide for future work seeking to examine 
and test mechanisms of PPIs more explicitly. Similar work 
can be done to identify mechanisms by which emotional 
well-being improves physical health, another critical issue 
for the field.

Several additional activities will further enhance pro-
gress. Investigators should explicitly evaluate whether some 
features of interventions make them more robust to inevita-
ble differences in how they are implemented in real-world 
settings. Administering combinations of single interventions 
may be more effective than administering any one singly. 
Exploring methodological innovations may also help address 
limitations in existing studies. For example, integrative data 
analysis is a recently developed method by which studies 
using similar approaches can be combined (Graham et al., 
2022). Applying these methods will allow for greater power 
to detect small effects.

What Does the Future Hold

After an intensive and rich exchange of ideas, workshop 
attendees identified several important lessons that inform 
next steps. They noted the need for sustained funding to 

support this research. While the NIH SOBC initiative has 
been an important source of funding, investigators also 
need to develop other partnerships. Foundations may have 
more appetite for piloting interventions that have “good 
enough” evidence to accelerate what is currently a long 
timeline  for  taking  interventions  from  development  to 
demonstrations of efficacy and implementation. Elevating 
the importance of the issues identified in the workshop 
regarding effect sizes, durability, and scalability will also 
be useful.

Diverse and transdisciplinary teams are needed for this 
work to succeed. Ideally, teams would possess diverse 
lived experiences and viewpoints, gather experts in basic 
science, intervention research, implementation science, 
and complexity science and incorporate input from key 
stakeholders to inform development of the most effective 
interventions. Such teams may be easier to find and build 
with the shareable resources and the creation of networks. 
Further discussion revolved around increasing political 
will to invest in psychological well-being. One way would 
be to survey public opinion and attitudes on psychologi-
cal well-being and its importance in health and lever-
age the findings to engage and build partnerships with 
policy-makers and economists. Several other countries 
have developed high level positions aimed at fostering 
greater policy engagement with research in this domain, 
including the United Arabic Emirates and the UK, and 
U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is advocating this 
approach (Murthy, 2022).

Another strategy may be to link psychological well-
being to other endpoints of significant concern to policy 
makers and funders. For example, recent work has identi-
fied the economic value of targeting and delaying aging 
(Scott et al., 2021). Additionally, the psychopathology 
literature  has  estimated  the  economic  costs  of  several 
psychological illnesses and the potential cost savings by 
implementing interventions that aim to decrease these ail-
ments (Knapp & Wong, 2020). More generally, research in 
this area might adopt methods developed in other domains 
using cost-effectiveness analysis to prioritize interven-
tion strategies based not only on cost and effectiveness, 
but also on feasibility and projected population impact. 
For example, research on physical activity promotion and 
obesity prevention in childhood has taken this economic 
evaluation approach, first using a systematic review to 
identify key interventions with evidence of effectiveness 
and then using microsimulation models of the U.S. popu-
lation to project effects of nationally implementing each 
intervention on physical activity and childhood obesity, 
drawing on current population health and health care cost 
data (Cradock et al., 2017). Similar methods might be 
effectively applied to evaluating interventions to modify 
psychological well-being. Knowing how psychological 

1 3Affective Science (2023) 4:174–184 

181

well-being might impact trajectories of aging and costs 
would  generate  interest  in  investment  and  sustainable 
funding for interventions to increase population-levels 
of psychological well-being. More generally, attendees 
agreed that given current trends in population health and 
particularly mental health, it is more important than ever 
to think creatively about ways to improve psychological 
well-being at the population level. We hope that sharing 
this discussion and the creativity, energy, and passion in 
the meeting will inspire continued work in this area and 
draw new investigators at all levels to the endeavor.
