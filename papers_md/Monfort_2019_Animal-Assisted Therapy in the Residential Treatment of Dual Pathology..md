Abstract: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a complementary intervention of therapy that has shown
positive results in the treatment of various pathologies. This study assesses the viability of the
implementation and the eﬀectiveness of an AAT program in patients diagnosed with substance abuse
disorder and associated mental disorders (dual pathology). For the study, a dynamic prospective
cohort was used, consisting of 43 patients in residential treatment. The program consisted of
10 sessions with a duration of about 60 min, where data was collected in the 3rd, 6th and 10th sessions.
The Life Skills Proﬁle questionnaire (LSP) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) were used for
subsequent evaluation. Patients who participated in the program showed an improvement in daily
skills, which favoured a better quality of life and decreased impulsiveness, enabling them to regain
self-control. These results suggest that the dog can be a multi-sensory stimulus that captures attention,
and improves motivation, cooperation and patient involvement in therapy. It was concluded that
AAT can serve as an adjunctive therapy in the rehabilitation processes of people diagnosed with
dual pathology.

1. Introduction

Finding the origin of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is not an easy task, since throughout
history it has been supposed that interactions with animals may have beneﬁts to human beings for a
variety of reasons. The genesis of AAT goes back to the Neolithic period, with the emergence of the
domestication process that signiﬁcantly transformed the relations of human society with nature [1].
Originally, the interaction between humans and other animals was limited to cohabitation and rivalry
for daily food. As human–animal coexistence advanced, it evolved towards the role of humans as the
domesticator, a quality that indicated greater social and economic development, because man fed and
was served by animals [2].

The coexistence and creation of emotional ties of humans with various tamed animals consolidated
in this stage, and the therapeutic beneﬁts that animals provided to humans progressively manifested [3].
Thus, in the 5th century BC, horse riding exercise was used for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers [4],
and the belief that dogs could heal wounds persisted until well after Christianity arrived in Europe [5].
Galen also argued that the practice of riding improved rational thinking and that the practice of sports
with animals decreased episodes of hypochondria and hysteria [4]. In the Enlightenment period,
new theories were introduced highlighting the socializing inﬂuence of interaction with animals [6].
At the York Retreat hospital, England, therapeutic contact was introduced for people diagnosed
with mental illnesses with small farm animals, in order to promote self-control. In the 19th century,

animals such as cats, birds, squirrels, dogs and ﬁsh were included in the Bethlem psychiatric hospital
as items of therapy [5]. In the 20th century, AAT was applied in the US for the treatment of hospitalized
wounded adults and children, with the therapeutic purpose of improving their quality of life [5,7].

Therapeutic interventions that are complemented by AAT provide well-being and promote the
health of patients [8]. AAT is an intervention that seeks to achieve a specific objective through participation
and interaction with an animal [2]. AAT programs are planned to encourage the improvement of
physical, social, emotional and cognitive human functioning. They can be implemented individually
or in groups, and the development of the program is always evaluated and documented [9]. One of
the main beneﬁts of AAT is the interaction with the animal as a space where the patient’s therapeutic
relationship and adherence to the treatment is improved. An emotional and protected environment is
promoted through the animals for the development of therapeutic programs [10,11] in order to achieve
rehabilitation [12]. Nevertheless, presenting AAT as a therapy in itself is a mistake. AAT features among
treatment alternatives, always as a complement to prototypical psychotherapeutic and pharmacological
interventions [13]. It is not conceived as a sole treatment but as a complementary option that facilitates the
therapist’s work [14]. The animal is used as an instrument that helps, through interaction with the patient,
to achieve the therapeutic objectives of the treatment, promoting various activities to address rehabilitation
targets such as cognitive, emotional–affective, social or linguistic improvement [15].

AAT can be performed with various animals, be they dogs, cats or other pets, or larger animals such
as horses and dolphins [16]. It should be noted that dogs are the most commonly used because of the
diversity of their breeds and their ability to be trained [7], encouraging communication and acting as a
positive reinforcement for patients [8]. The main environments for intervention are neuro-rehabilitation,
education, mental health, geriatrics, gerontology and prison or hospital contexts [17].

Intervention in substance abuse disorders is characterized by the use of various techniques to
achieve patient rehabilitation. There is an additional diﬃculty in achieving this, in that substance abuse
is often associated with various negative aspects of patient health [18]. Dual pathology is deﬁned as the
presence of a mental disorder and a substance abuse disorder in the same patient [19]. This comorbidity
has important implications at clinical and therapeutic levels [20], resulting in poorer prognosis and
therapeutic outcome and increased likelihood of relapse in mental or addictive diseases [21]. AAT is

used as therapeutic instruments to deliver various objectives such as enhancing creativity, emotional
management, empathy, self-control, social skills training, self-esteem, concentration, and reduction of
stress and anxiety and aggressive behaviours through confronting the consequences and working on
internal processes that facilitate the assumption of new behaviour [23]. Intervention in dual pathology
through AAT helps to overcome one of the main diﬃculties the therapist has, namely the sustaining of
a therapeutic alliance [24]. AAT helps patients become involved and participate in a more active way
in their own therapy process. When an animal is included in the treatment, it helps introspection and
internalization, increases conﬁdence in the therapeutic environment, provides security and conﬁdence
in therapy, and motivates the patient to share their feelings [2,25].

One of the contexts where all these aspects can be observed, while at the same time attempting
intervention, is the residential environment, speciﬁcally the Therapeutic Community (TC). There has
been an increase in TC patients with dual diagnosis in recent years [26,27]. This residential
therapeutic–educational scenario maintains the traditional intervention techniques focused on the
rehabilitative/psychosocial context, while, at the same time, it has been shown to be a suitable framework
for the application of an AAT program with a view to reducing psychopathology, and improving quality
of life and adherence to treatment, because the patients enjoy a certain level of clinical permanence
with it [28].

The objectives of this study were (a) to demonstrate the viability of the implementation and (b) to
evaluate the eﬀectiveness of an AAT program in patients diagnosed with substance abuse disorder and
associated mental disorders (dual diagnosis). For the evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of AAT, we take
into account the impulsivity and life skills of patients in a residential context.

2. Materials and Methods

Study design: The study was carried out in a semi-experimental, prospective context,

with evaluation at 3, 6 and 10 weeks.

Sampling method: The sample consisted of a prospective dynamic cohort of people over 18,
admitted for treatment due to a substance abuse disorder and residentially admitted to the therapeutic
community. They were recruited by consecutive sampling over a period of 12 months.

The inclusion criteria were: (a) Meeting DSM-5 criteria [29] for substance abuse disorder and
the presence of any other mental disorders. (b) Total withdrawal from alcohol and other substances
from the beginning of treatment. All patients received a detoxiﬁcation treatment and were stabilized
with medication before they were included in the study.
(c) Treatment carried out inside the
therapeutic community.

The exclusion criteria were: (a) Patients whose functioning could be altered by factors not
speciﬁcally related to addictive pathology or mental disorder (severe cognitive impairment, intellectual
deﬁciency or language barrier). (b) Animal-speciﬁc phobia.

Initially, 65 subjects were recruited but, after completing the AAT, a ﬁnal sample of 43 subjects
who ﬁnished the study was obtained. All patients leaving the study were due to the termination
of admission to the therapeutic community, nine of them (40.9%) due to recovery, the rest due to
voluntary discharge.

AAT description: The AAT was implemented by a therapist who completed a postgraduate diploma
in “Animal Assisted Therapies: Foundation and Practice” from the University of Valencia (Spain).
The AAT was carried out with one dog, understood as a therapeutic tool, in a group therapy with
10 patients. Regarding the stress of the animal, only one weekly group was made and after each
session the dog had a walk, distraction and play session with the therapist. The program consisted of
10 sessions with a duration of about 60 min, carrying out one session per week. Table 1 details the
AAT scheme. Patients undertook two types of exercise with the animal. The ﬁrst sought to create a
therapeutic environment suitable for the completion of the second exercise, where patients worked
on the designed content in a more speciﬁc way with the dog. Table 2 details the contents of each of
the sessions.

Data collection: was carried out three times during the program with evaluations at Sessions 3, 6

and 10. The clinical instruments used were:

•
•

•

Ad hoc questionnaire of socio-demographic, psychopathological and health variables;
The Life Skills Proﬁle questionnaire (LSP) [30]. This questionnaire evaluates aspects of
functioning that aﬀect daily activities and the adaptation of people with mental illnesses in
the community. It contains 39 items that are grouped into self-care, social-interpersonal behaviour,
communication-social contact, non-personal social behaviour and autonomous life;
Barrat impulsiveness scale (BIS-11) [31]. This instrument is composed of 30 items distributed into
three sub-scales: nonplanning, motor and attentional [32]. The total impulsiveness score was
also obtained.

Ethics aspects: participants signed the relevant informed consent after the six month duration AAT
program [33]. This study complies with the principles of the Ethics Committee of the Universidad
Católica de Valencia San Vicente Mártir as well as those of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Council
of Europe Convention. Conﬁdentiality of the participants and the data was guaranteed according to
Organic Law 15/1999 on Personal Data Protection (LOPD).

Data analysis: was performed with the SPSS v.21 program. After the exploratory and descriptive
analysis, ANOVA of repeated measures was used to assess the diﬀerences in the dependent variables
between the three time points of evaluation (Sessions 3, 6 and 10).

3. Results

In relation to the sociodemographic characteristics obtained, the average age of the patients was
34.4 years (SD = 7.4), with a gender distribution of 86% (N = 37) men and the remaining 14% (N = 6)
women. Regarding marital status, 46.5% (N = 20) were single, 37.2% (N = 16) divorced/separated,
2.3% (N = 1) had a common-law partner and 14% (N = 6) were married. When evaluating the level of
education, the distribution was as follows: 2.3% (N = 1) university graduates, 11.6% (N = 5) without
education, 34.9% (N = 15) basic education, 32.6% (N = 14) with secondary education. Of the total
sample, 59% (N = 25) were employed prior to treatment and 93% (N = 40) had the support of their
family in their treatment.

Regarding variables related to the state of physical health, we found that 7% (N = 3) had a
diagnosis of hepatitis C, 4.7% (N = 20) tested positive for hepatitis B and C, and 2.3% (N = 1) had HIV.
In the psychopathological variables, we found a percentage of hospital admissions after mental health
emergency care of 14.4% (N = 6), 27% (N = 11) with autolytic history and an average of 24.4 years of
substance abuse (SD = 8.2).

Regarding the substances abused, most of the patients (60.4%; N = 26) were polydrug abusers,
cocaine together with alcohol and THC, 13.9% (N = 6) of the patients consumed alcohol, 9.3% (N = 4)
heroin and cocaine and the same percentage only cocaine. A total of 4.6% (N = 2) of the patients
consumed heroin and 2.3% (N = 1) THC (Hash/Marijuana). In relation to dual pathology, the mental
disorders with the highest prevalence were mood disorders at 39.5% (N = 17), followed by Schizophrenia
spectrum disorders (25.5%; N = 11) and personality disorders (23.2%, N = 10). A total of 4.6% (N = 2)
of the patients suﬀered from bipolar disorder, and, ﬁnally, 6.9% (N = 3) had other mental disorders.
Table 3 shows the results obtained by the participants in the LSP questionnaire, diﬀerentiating the
various evaluation times. There were statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences after the AAT intervention
in the self-care scales (F = 76.09, p < 0.001) interpersonal social behaviour (F = 68.2, p < 0.001),
communication (F = 45.04, p < 0.001), non-personal social behaviour (F = 68.73, p < 0.001) and
autonomous life (F = 54.03, p < 0.001).

4. Discussion

The magnitude of the psychological, physical health and social impact of substance abuse disorders,
especially when they coexist with a mental illness (dual pathology), demands more research, as well
as the design of possible intervention or treatment strategies, with the aim of increasing the quality,
reliability and eﬀective management of this reality [34]. Our sample is representative of this impact,
because all suﬀered from dual pathology, with mood disorders being the most comorbid mental illness,
and 14.4% having had at least one hospital admission in a mental health unit. These data reﬂect
that substance abuse is closely related to the mental health of the consumer, without forgetting that
health deterioration is presented only as a consequence and not as a predisposing factor for substance
use [35]. The results obtained on the state of physical health also show a deterioration, with an elevated
prevalence of hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV infection. Regarding the social impact, the most striking
ﬁnding was that over half the subjects evaluated were not working, and it was also interesting to
note that 93% of our subjects had some type of family support. We consider that this factor may have
had some relationship with the psychological consequences for our subjects, namely the possibility of
accessing treatment and receiving emotional support [36]. All these repercussions of addiction, and the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 120

severity of the addiction itself—polydrug abuse was the norm in our sample—could be the reason for
the necessity of a residential setting instead an ambulatory one.

Following the demands of more research, as well as the design of new treatment strategies for
patients with dual pathology [37], we have evaluated the viability of implementing an AAT program,
with the aim of reducing the psychological, physical health and social consequences of addiction.
Speciﬁcally, we have evaluated impulsivity in the psychological area and the eﬀectiveness of AAT for
life skills for the social area. Regarding the results obtained from the BIS-11 questionnaire, a decrease
in impulsiveness was found, in the planning area and as a global factor. From the data obtained,
and taking into account other studies [38], it can be concluded that the implementation of AAT resulted
in an encouraging improvement in impulsiveness, which is linked to improvement of psychopathology
and, speciﬁcally, substance abuse disorders themselves. The decrease in impulsiveness in patients
reﬂects the results obtained in research derived from other applications of AAT, such as studies in
attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), where AAT is applied in a complementary way,
obtaining a positive reduction in symptoms and impulsiveness [39,40]. Regarding the improvement in
life skills obtained after the implementation of AAT in patients with dual pathology, other studies have
demonstrated similar results. In one such study, AAT was shown to improve social skills in a group of
young people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resulting in a decrease in functional
problems and reduction in the aﬀective symptoms of the disease [41].

AAT’s eﬀectiveness in patients with dual pathology requires time, as the decrease in impulsiveness
was found to occur between the 6th and 10th AAT sessions.
It is considered as an appropriate
longitudinal approach in our study, to evaluate the predictive power of the intervention related
to its global clinical evolution and, as far as possible, in diﬀerent therapeutic scenarios [42,43].
This conjunction, far from being ambitious, enables a treatment design involving AAT that is applicable
to the reality of residential patients [42,44]. After its implementation and eﬀectiveness demonstration,
it is proposed that it may be interesting to analyse the possible mechanisms that are linked to a good
clinical evolution of patients [45], as well as the shortage of studies regarding the application of AAT in
dual pathology [46,47].

The main limitation of the study is the absence of a control group. As semi-experimental study,
the possible eﬀect on the results by the residential treatment itself has to be taken into account.
Nevertheless, the results obtained seem to follow the line of other studies that denote the usefulness
of AAT with minors [48], substance abuse disorders [46,49], ADHD [39], neuro-rehabilitation [47]
and ASD [41]. We did not register past dog ownership; it should be considered in future studies as
a covariant.

5. Conclusions

As has already been demonstrated in other types of patients, with diﬀerent diseases and in
diﬀerent settings, the authors consider that this study and its results demonstrate that AAT can be
implemented in patients with dual pathology in the therapeutic community.

This study demonstrated that AAT, carried out in patients with dual pathology in a residential
setting, reduces impulsiveness as well as improving diﬀerent life skills. Nevertheless, it is worth
mentioning that it would be wrong to use AAT as the sole intervention for improving symptoms.
AAT should be used as a complement to approaches that use cognitive-behavioural, pharmacological
or other types of therapeutic interventions.
