Abstract

N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an indole alkaloid widely found in plants and animals. It is 
best known for producing brief and intense psychedelic effects when ingested. Increasing evidence 
suggests that endogenous DMT plays important roles for a number of processes in the periphery 
and central nervous system, and may act as a neurotransmitter. This paper reviews the current 
literature of both the recreational use of DMT and its potential roles as an endogenous 
neurotransmitter. Pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action in the periphery and central nervous 
system, clinical uses and adverse effects are also reviewed. DMT appears to have limited 
neurotoxicity and other adverse effects except for intense cardiovascular effects when 
administered intravenously in large doses. Because of its role in nervous system signaling, DMT 
may be a useful experimental tool in exploring how brain works, and may also be a useful clinical 
tool for treatment of anxiety and psychosis.

1. Introduction

N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an indole alkaloid widely found in nature. It is an 
endogenous compound in animals (Saavedra and Axelrod, 1972; Christian et al., 1977, 
Hollister, 1977) and in a wide variety of plants found around the globe. Major plant genera 
containing DMT include Phalaris, Delosperma, Acacia, Desmodium, Mimosa, Virola, and 
Psychotria, but DMT has been found even in apparently innocuous sources, such as leaves of 
citrus plants (Servillo et al., 2012), and in the leaves, seeds, and inner bark of mimosa 
tenuiflora, which has become a source of livestock poisoning (Gaujac et al., 2012).

DMT has become of interest because when ingested, it causes brief, episodic visual 
hallucinations at high concentrations (Stoff et al. 1977; Strassman and Qualls, 1994; 
Strassman et al., 1994, Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997). DMT is one of the major psychoactive 
compounds found in various shamanistic compounds (e.g., ayahuasca, hoasca, yagé) used in 
South America for centuries (Pochettino et al., 1999) and has, more recently found its way 
into Europe and North America as a recreational drug (Tupper, 2008).

1.1. Recreational use of DMT

Most hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-
methylamphetamine (DOM) cause sensory distortion, depersonalization at high doses, and 
at least one (N,N-Diisopropyltryptamine, DiPT) causes auditory distortions, whereas some 
compounds such as DMT (found in ayahuasca), psilocybin (mushrooms) or mescaline 
(peyote) cause episodic visual effects. In the late 1990s, Rick Strassman conducted the first 
human research with hallucinogens in 20 years, examining the physiological effects and self-
reports from people receiving DMT in carefully controlled settings (Strassman et al., 1994; 
1996). A book describing these results was published in the popular press (Strassman 2001). 
Strassman concluded that DMT is a powerful tool for self-discovery and understanding 
consciousness, which may have helped to drive interest in recreational use of DMT and 
related tryptamine hallucinogens. In recent years, recreational use of DMT has been 
increasing; for example, Cakic et al., (2010) reported that 31% of recreational DMT users 
endorse psychotherapeutic benefits as the main reason for consumption. Similar to 
ayahuasca, recreational users have made similar concoctions referred to as pharmahuasca. 
These are of capsules containing free-base DMT and some monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOI) such as synthetic harmaline (Ott, 1999) or Syrian Rue (rich in beta-carbolines; 
Brierley and Davidson, 2012).

It is unclear what proportion of users of hallucinogenic tryptamines have adverse events 
serious enough for hospitalization, but it seems that the synthetic hallucinogenic compounds, 
such as 25I-NBOMe may be more dangerous than the plant-derived compounds (Hill et al., 
2013; Lowe et al., 2015). Databases derived from Poison Control and Emergency 
Department visits (via the Drug Abuse Warning Network) only sparing differentiate between 
hallucinogenic compounds taken and lack adequate records of DMT-specific cases. Street 
drugs mostly contain powdered DMT, whereas ayahuasca also contains harmine-related 
compounds, which limit toxic effects (Lanaro et al., 2015). However, aside from the acute 
cardiovascular effects there have been no consistent reports of toxic effects of long-term use 
of DMT in the literature. In fact, there has been a report that DMT is neuroprotective 
(Frecska, 2008). Without more data on the recreational use of this class of compounds, it is 
not possible to conclude whether the synthetic hallucinogens are indeed more toxic or 
whether the social context may contribute to the effects.

It is likely that most adverse effects of hallucinogens are psychological effects, such as 
intense fear, paranoia, anxiety, grief, and depression, that can result in putting the user or 
others in physical harm or danger (Carbonaro et al., submitted). Anecdotal reports describe 
psychologically challenging experiences with DMT and other psychedelic compounds. The 
rates of occurrence for these effects have not been properly accounted for. However, in the

case of psilocybin, about 30% of laboratory experiences include psychologically challenging 
experiences (Carbonaro et al, submitted). Even though DMT may not produce physical 
toxicity, severe psychological adverse effects can occur.

1.2. Endogenous roles of DMT

Although widespread biological presence of DMT is acknowledged, the biological function 
of DMT remains a mystery. DMT is found in low concentrations in brain tissue (Saavedra 
and Axelrod, 1972; Christian et al., 1977; Hollister, 1977). DMT concentrations can be 
localized and elevated in certain instances, for example, DMT production increases in rodent 
brain under stress (Barker et al., 1981). Formerly, endogenous DMT was thought to exist at 
concentrations too low to produce pharmacological effects, but two discoveries changed that. 
First, trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) are activated by DMT and other molecules 
(Bunzow et al., 2001) and second, DMT can be locally sequestered in neurotransmitter 
storage vesicles at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, thereby being able to active 
other pharmacological receptors, e.g. serotonin (Nagai et al., 2007; Cozzi et al., 2009). 
These findings suggest that DMT may have a role in normal physiological and/or 
psychopathology. What that role may be has not yet been established.

Although the serotonin system has been thought to be the main contributor to the 
psychedelic effects of DMT, other behavioral effects have been observed which do not 
involve the serotonin or other monoaminergic systems; such as jerking, retropulsion, and 
tremors (Deliganis et al., 1991; Jenner et al., 1980). In addition, molecular effects of DMT 
have been identified that are not mediated by serotonin receptors. For example, DMT-
enhanced phosphatidylinositol production is not blocked by 5-HT2A receptor antagonists 
(i.e., ketanserin; Deliganis et al., 1991). More recent hypotheses for molecular roles of 
endogenous DMT have developed over the last decade, and include the potential 
involvement of TAAR (mentioned above) and sigma-1 receptors. Interactions of both TAAR 
and sigma-1 receptors will be discussed in detail in subsequent sections.

There has been a great deal of speculation about the role of DMT in naturally occurring 
altered states of consciousness, such as psychosis, dreams, creativity, imagination, religious 
and/or spiritual phenomena, and near-death experiences (Callaway, 1988, Strassman 2001). 
Additionally, DMT may play a role in waking reality (Wallach, 2009). Waking reality is 
created in a similar way to altered states except that the normal state correlates with event in 
the “physical” world. Thus, waking reality can be thought of as a tightly regulated 
psychedelic experience and altered states arise when this regulation is loosened in some 
fashion. This model predicts that the sensory-altering effects of administered psychedelics 
are a result of the compound acting directly via neuropharmacological mechanisms in 
regions of the CNS involved in sensory perception. More simply, DMT may potentially act 
as a neurotransmitter to exert a signaling function in regions of the CNS, which are involved 
in sensory perception (Wallach, 2009).

Other theories propose that DMT may be important in psychiatric disorders. Data from early 
studies of DMT suggested that DMT may be a schizotoxin, and various authors 
hypothesized that DMT was a key factor in causing schizophrenia (Osmond and Smythies, 
1952; Gillin et al., 1976, reviewed by Szara 2007). This hypothesis is no longer accepted,

but it is still thought that DMT may play a role in psychotic symptoms (Daumann et al., 
2010; Warren et al., 2012). Similarly, DMT was thought to be neurotoxic, but more recent 
research suggests that DMT may actually be neuroprotective (Frecska et al., 2013).

More recently, Jacob and Presti (2005) proposed that endogenous DMT may have an 
anxiolytic role based on the reported subjective effects of DMT administered in low doses, 
which would result comparable concentrations and biological actions to those of endogenous 
DMT. Sensory alterations commonly described by people taking DMT occur only when 
relatively high concentrations of DMT are administered. These high concentrations are 
similar to those observed in the synapse when endogenous DMT is released (review, 
Wallach, 2009).

The putative roles of DMT will be explored in more detail in subsequent sections of this 
review. The review will begin by addressing the basic mechanisms of action of DMT, both 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic. It will then examine evidence regarding the 
neuropharmacological effects of DMT, from both behavioral studies of the exogenous 
effects of DMT, and from molecular studies of sites of action of endogenous DMT. Next, the 
review will turn to the use of DMT both as a model for various disorders and the use of 
DMT to treat some of these disorders. The review will conclude with the effects of DMT on 
other organ systems besides the central nervous system.

2. Pharmacokinetics of DMT

Intravenous administration of radio-labeled DMT in rabbits produces entry into the brain 
within 10 s and excretion via the kidneys, such that no traces of DMT or metabolite was 
measured in urine 24 h post administration. However, DMT could still be detected at 2 and 7 
days (0.1% of initial dose) post administration (Vitale et al., 2011). In the same study, 
tryptamine was eliminated within 10 min. These findings show that even after complete 
clearance of a dose of DMT from the blood, DMT is still present in the CNS, and imply that 
DMT is being produced in the CNS. The subjective effects of intravenous administration of 
DMT (typical dose 0.1 – 0.4 mg/kg; Strassman et al., 1996) peak at about 5 min and are 
gone by 30 min. Intramuscular effects of DMT hydrochloride or DMT fumarate (reported 
dose 0.2- 1 mg/kg; Szara, 2007) have a rapid onset within 2 – 5 min and can last 30 - 60 
min, and the effects are generally less intense than intravenous or inhalation routes of 
administration. The hallucinogenic effects of DMT in the formulation of ayahuasca (0.6 - 
0.85 mg/kg DMT; Riba et al., 2003) generally appear within 60 min, peak at 90 min and can 
last for approximately 4 h (Cakic et al., 2010). Typical doses of smoked or inhaled free-base 
DMT are 40 - 50 mg, although dose may be as high as 100 mg (Shulgin and Shulgin, 1997). 
The onset of these doses of smoked DMT is rapid, similar to that of i.v. administration, but 
lasts less than 30 min. Smoked DMT effects are extremely intense (Strassman, 2001; Turner, 
1994). Intranasal free-base DMT was inactive (0.07 – 0.28 mg/kg; Turner and Merlis, 1959) 
as was DMT administered rectally as 1.7 mg/kg of the bioxalate salt (de Smet, 1983).

To establish that DMT acts as a neurotransmitter rather than merely being a by-product of 
the metabolism of other bioactive molecules, it is necessary to establish that it is 
synthesized, stored, and released. It is of interest that DMT can pass through three barriers

with the help of three different mechanisms so that it can be compartmentalized and stored 
with the brain (described in detail below). These three mechanisms may yield high 
intracellular and vesicular concentrations within neurons (Frecska et al., 2013), which 
suggests that DMT may have a biological role. Processes for the transport of glucose and 
amino acids are given similar biological priority, which may suggest that DMT is present in 
the body for more than its psychedelic effects, such as an adaptive role in biological 
processes, or a universal role in cellular protective mechanisms.

2.1. Synthesis

Endogenous DMT is synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is 
decarboxylated to tryptamine. Tryptamine is then transmethylated by the enzyme 
indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) (using S-adenosyl methionine as a substrate), 
which catalyzes the addition of methyl groups resulting in the production of N-
methyltryptamine (NMT) and DMT. NMT can also act as a substrate for INMT-dependent 
DMT biosynthesis (Barker et al., 1981). INMT is widely expressed in the body, primarily in 
peripheral tissue such as the lungs, thyroid and adrenal gland. INMT is located in 
intermediate levels in placenta, skeletal muscle, heart, small intestine, stomach, retina, 
pancreas, and lymph nodes. It is densely located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord 
(Mandell and Morgan., 1971; Mavlyutov et al., 2012; Morgan and Mandell, 1969; 
Thompson et al, 1998, 1999; Wyatt et al., 1973). Within the human brain, highest INMT 
activity has been found in uncus, medulla, amygdala, frontal cortex (Mendell and Morgan, 
1971), and in the fronto-parietal and temporal lobes (Saavedra et al., 1973). Cozzi et al. 
(2011) has shown INMT is also located in the pineal gland. Based on rodent brain cellular 
fractionation studies 70% of INMT activity is found in the supernatant and 20% in the 
synaptosomal fractions, suggesting the enzyme is located in the soma of cells, which are 
fractured during the homogenization process (Saavedra et al., 1973). The wide distribution 
of INMT implies a wide distribution for DMT.

The enzymatic activity of INMT is closely regulated by endogenous inhibitors (Lin, 1974; 
Marzullo et al., 1977). DMT at high concentrations (10-4 M) yields a 90% inhibition of 
rabbit lung INMT (Thithapandha, 1972). In addition, the same tissues that contain INMT 
also contain enzymes that metabolize DMT. Only a small fraction of DMT made 
intracellularly is actually released into the blood. This process helps explain the inconsistent 
detection levels assessed in many studies discussed below (Karkkainen et al., 2005; Barker 
et al., 2012; see endogenous section). DMT production is increased under stress in rodent 
brain and adrenal gland (Christian et al, 1977; Beaton and Christian, 1977). Whether the 
stress-induced mechanism for increasing DMT is due to increasing INMT activity, or a 
decrease in DMT metabolism remains unknown.

2.2. Accumulation and storage

As previously mentioned, it has been hypothesized that high, local concentrations of DMT 
can occur within neurons (Frecska et al., 2013) and potentially widely produced in 
peripheral organs, especially in the lungs. Frecska and colleagues (2013) summarized a 
three-step process by which DMT is accumulated and stored. In step 1, DMT crosses the 
blood brain barrier by active transport across the endothelial plasma membrane, which is

accomplished via Mg2+ and ATP-dependent uptake (Christian et al., 1977; Cohen and 
Vogel, 1972; Cozzi et al., 2009; Sangiah et al., 1979, Barker et al., 1982; Sitaram et al., 
1987; Takahashi et al., 1985; Yanai et al., 1986). In step 2, uptake of DMT into neuronal 
cells is accomplished via serotonin uptake transporters (SERT) on neuronal plasma 
membrane (Berge et al., 1983, Nagai et al., 2007, Whipple et al., 1983). In step 3, facilitated 
sequestration of DMT into synaptic vesicles from the cytoplasm is accomplished by the 
neuronal vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; Cozzi et al., 2009). DMT inhibited 
radiolabeled 5-HT uptake via the serotonin transporter (SERT) and VMAT2 with Ki values 
of 4 and 93 μM, respectively ( Nagai et al., 2007; Cozzi et al., 2009). DMT that has been 
taken up and stored within cells via SERT and VMAT2 and exhibit high binding-to-uptake 
ratios, >11 for SERT and >10 for VMAT2. High binding ratios suggest that there are 
separate substrate and inhibitor sites for SERT and VMAT2 and further supports that DMT 
(and other tryptamines) are substrates for both transporters.

The high levels of DMT concentration found in vesicles are needed for various 
pharmacological actions including activation of sigma-1 receptors and TAARs as described 
below. Once uptake and storage of DMT has been completed, it can remained stored in 
vesicles for at least 1 week and can be released under appropriate stimuli (Vitale et al., 
2011). Through these three steps, peripheral synthesis of DMT, consumption of DMT-
containing plant matter, or systemic administration of DMT can influence central nervous 
system functions (Frecska et al., 2013).

2.3. Bioavailability of exogenous DMT

DMT is not orally active. This is likely due to rapid degradation by peripheral monoamine 
oxidase (MAO), the enzyme (located in mitochondria) responsible for catalyzing the 
oxidative deamination of endogenous biogenic amines (McKenna et al., 1984). For 
hallucinogenic or psychedelic phenomena to occur, plasma concentration must be between 
12 – 90 μg/L with an apparent volume of distribution of 36 – 55 L/kg ( Callaway et al., 1999; 
Riba et al., 2003; Yritia et al., 2002), which roughly corresponds to a plasma concentration 
of 0.06 – 0.50 μM. In order for DMT to be bioavailable, oral formulations such as ayahuasca 
contain Banisteriopsis caapi and other beta-carboline harmala alkaloids that act as MAOIs 
(Schultes, 1972; Shulgin, 1976; Der Marderosian et al., 1968; Agurell et al., 1968). MAO-A 
inhibitors such as iproniazid prolongs the half-life of DMT in rat brain (Lu et al., 1974), and 
can extend the time course effects of DMT in drug discrimination from 30 min to 60 min 
(Gatch, unpublished data). Exogenous DMT formulations containing a reversible MAOI 
(such as ayahuasca) can result in blood levels up to 1.0 mg/ml or higher (Dos Santos, 2011). 
On average a 100 mL dose of ayahuasca contains about 24 mg of DMT (Callaway et al., 
1996). Interestingly, DMT is itself a short-acting monoamine oxidase inhibitor at high doses 
(maximum effects at 50 mg/kg), and is selective for MAO-A (Reimann and Schneider, 1993, 
Smith et al., 1962; Waldmeier and Maitre, 1977). In these studies, DMT decreased serotonin 
and dopamine deamination in rat striatum concomitantly with rapid onset (15 min). 
Normalization occurred 2 hours later with an ED50 of 25 mg/kg for degradation of both 
serotonin and dopamine.

2.4. Degradation and elimination

A small fraction of exogenous DMT is excreted in urine as the parent compound (Barker et 
al., 1981). DMT is primarily metabolized by MAO, although there is evidence that DMT can 
also be metabolized by peroxidases, leading to a variety of other metabolites. In both human 
and rodent models, none of the metabolites produced DMT-like effects (Szara, 1956; Szara 
et al., 1961; Rosenberg et al., 1964; Barker, 1978). From the MAO pathway, several indole 
compounds are produced: N-methyltryptamine (NMT), 6-hydroxy-DMT (6-OH-DMT), 6-
OH-DMT-N-oxide (6-OH-DMT-NO), DMT-N-oxide (DMT-NO), and indole-3-acetic acid 
(IAA) (Fish et al., 1955; Szara, 1956). The major metabolites of DMT are DMT-NO, and 
IAA (Fish et al., 1955; Barker et al., 2013). In rabbit liver microsomal fractions pretreated 
with MAOI iproniazid, five indole compounds were found: DMT, NMT, 6-OH-DMT, 6-OH-
DMT-NO, and DMT-NO; however, in rabbit brain microsomal preparation again with 
iproniazid pretreatment, no 6-hydroxy metabolites were identified (Szara, 1956). These 
findings suggest that metabolism of DMT is somewhat different in brain and in the 
periphery.

Formation of IAA was thought to be likely due to oxidase deamination of NMT (Barker et 
al., 1980), but was later established to be also in part by direct deamination by MAO (Barker 
et al., 1982). Pretreatment with the MAO-I iproniazid in rat whole brain homogenates 
inhibited IAA formation by 83%, NMT and DMT-NO formation were inhibited by 90%, 
suggesting that the increase in behavioral half-life of DMT is due to MAO-inhibition and 
inhibition of the enzymes responsible for demethylation and N-oxidation as well (Barker et 
al., 1980).

Erspamer (1955) first recorded IAA as a metabolite of systemically administered DMT in 
rodent urine, which represented less than 3% of the injected dose of DMT. In human 
volunteers, 8.3% of the administered dose of DMT was recovered as IAA (Szara, 1956). 
Around 50% was recovered as IAA but also as DMT-NO (10%) and other MAO-
independent compounds (Riba et al., 2012). Neither the Erspamer nor Szara study detected 
unchanged DMT in urine. Little DMT is found unchanged in the urine of ayahuasca users 
despite taking it with harmala alkaloids (MAO inhibitors) (McIlhenny et al., 2011). In 
another study in humans, 0.16% of DMT (injected intramuscularly) was recovered as DMT 
following a 24-hour urine collection, (Kaplan et al., 1974). In both of these studies, DMT 
concentration peaked in blood within 10-15 minutes and was essentially undetectable by one 
hour. Approximately only 1.8% of the injected dose was present in blood at any one time.

Oxidative deamination of DMT by MAO may not be the sole metabolic pathway in humans 
(Riba et al., 2012). A study by Gomes et al. (2014) suggests that a different metabolic 
pathway by which DMT can be oxidized by peroxidases may be responsible for increasing 
cytotoxic activity of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (Tourino et al., 2013). Metabolites 
in this pathway include hydroxy-DMT, N,N-dimethyl-N-formyl-kynuramine, and N,N-
dimethyl-kynuramine. Barker et al. (1980) suggest other possible metabolites of DMT 
include 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC) and 2-methyl-THBC.

2.5. Detection of endogenous DMT in blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid

DMT as an endogenous compound can be measured in human body fluids, including blood, 
urine and cerebral spinal fluid. Levels of endogenous DMT do not appear to be regulated by 
diet or gut bacteria (Barker et al., 2012). Infrequent and inadequate sampling methods used 
over time make it difficult to determine specific details pertaining to DMT production in the 
body. For example, we still do not know if DMT is produced in phasic or diurnal cycles. 
Measureable concentrations seem to only occur intermittently (Oon et al., 1977), and exact 
tissue source or sources of DMT is still unclear. It is commonly thought that the adrenal 
gland and lungs are the most common places for the highest amount of DMT production, 
since this is where highest levels of INMT have been reported (Thompson and 
Weinshillboum, 1998; Thompson et al., 1999).

A review by Barker in 2012 assessed 69 studies that reported endogenous DMT detection 
and quantities reported in urine (29 studies), blood (11 studies), and cerebrospinal fluid (4 
studies) from 1955 – 2010 primarily comparing detection levels within healthy controls and 
schizophrenic patients. DMT in urine was examined in 861 individuals (635 patients), 276 
patients and 145 controls were positive for DMT. Throughout the studies, there were 
inconsistent sampling methods, including various of amounts of urine used in assays, and a 
range of techniques and analytical approaches were used. Some studies took dietary 
influences into consideration, but found no associations with endogenous DMT levels. 
Inconsistent units of measurement were also used across studies. Concentrations in urine 
range from 0.02 to 42.98 +/-8.6 (SD) ug/24h, and from 0.16 to 19 ng/ml. In blood, data from 
417 (300 patients) individuals were examined, 44 patients and 28 controls were positive for 
DMT. One study was responsible for 137 of the negative samples. Like detection in urine, 
extraction methods and analytical approaches were highly inconsistent. Testing procedures 
included discrepancies of samples coming from plasma, serum and/or whole blood, while 
others had limit detections of 0.2 DMT/ml. Higher concentrations of DMT are extracted 
from whole blood compared to plasma (Riceberg et al., 1978), but there is no difference in 
venous and arterial blood (Walker et al., 1979). When concentrations were reported, not just 
whether it was present or not present, it ranged from 51 pg/ml (HPLC-radioimmunoassay) to 
55 ng/ml (direct fluorescence assay of extracts). DMT was detected in cerebrospinal fluid in 
4 studies, which tested 136 individuals (82 patients). Of those, 34 patients and 22 controls 
were positive for DMT. Concentrations ranged from 0.12 to 100 ng/ml. DMT can be 
detected as an endogenous compound in urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. Even with 
inconsistent detection methods, DMT does not appear to be related to the onset of 
schizophrenia, since it seems to be detected more so in healthy controls compared to 
patients.

3. Pharmacodynamics

3.1. Clinical effects

Oral dosing of DMT via ayahuasca produces both behavioral and neurochemical effects, 
such as decreases in motor activity (Pic-Taylor et al., 2015), impairment of cognitive 
function (Alonso et al., 2015; Bouso et al., 2013), sympathomimetic effects, increased 
prolactin and cortisol levels, and decreased lymphocytes increased natural killer cells (Dos

Santos, et al., 2011). Doses of ayahuasca 15 or 30-fold higher than commonly used ritual 
doses increased serotonergic neurotransmission (Pic-Taylor et al., 2015). Long-term use of 
DMT in ayahuasca produces measurable brain changes. Long-term ayahuasca users show 
difference in midline brain structures using MRI versus matched controls (Bouso et al., 
2015). Interestingly, whereas ayahuasca produced modest impairment of cognitive function 
in inexperienced users, little or no impairment was observed in experienced users (Bouso et 
al., 2013).

3.1.1. Tolerance—Several early studies demonstrated that DMT does not produce 
tolerance. When DMT was administered to squirrel monkeys (2 mg/kg, i.m.) for 36-38 days, 
it failed to elicit tolerance to the disruption of responding maintained on a fixed-ratio 
schedule of food reinforcement (Cole and Pieper, 1973). Similarly in cats, Gillin et al. 
(1973) demonstrated that DMT (3 mg/kg, i.p.) did not produce tolerance when administered 
7-15 days twice daily or every 2 or 24 hours to its effects on EEG, pupil dilation, 
coordination, posture, and other physical signs. To the contrary, an increase in sensitivity to 
repeated injections were observed. However, following administration of higher doses of 
DMT and more frequent injections, partial tolerance to DMT in rats occurred with dose 
ranges of 3.2 – 10 mg/kg every 2 hours for 21 days (Gillin et al., 1973). Cross-tolerance to 
LSD (0.1 mg/kg) after tolerance to 3.2 mg/kg DMT was established; however, only slight 
tolerance to LSD was established following 10 mg/kg DMT (Koviac and Domino, 1976).

In humans administered 4 repeated doses of DMT 30 minutes apart, Strassman et al. (1996) 
observed no tolerance to the subjective effects of intravenous DMT as measured by the 
Hallucinogen Rating Scale. However, tolerance did develop to change in body temperature 
and other physiological factors. These findings will be discussed in more detail in the 
paragraph on cardiovascular effects in section 5. Mild cross-tolerance to DMT was reported 
in humans made tolerant to LSD (Rosenberg et al., 1964; Jenner et al., 1980). Taken 
together, these findings suggest that tolerance can develop to the cardiovascular and other 
peripheral effects of DMT, although little or no tolerance develops to the subjective effects.

3.1.2. Subjective effects of DMT—Because the subjective effects of hallucinogens seem 
to drive their use rather than effects on the reward/ reinforcement areas of the brain, drug 
discrimination is often used as an animal model for testing the behavioral effects of 
hallucinogens. A compound can be tested for its ability to “substitute”, that is, produce drug-
appropriate responding in test subjects trained to discriminate a psychoactive compound 
from its vehicle or from other psychoactive compounds. Typically, drug-appropriate 
responding greater than 80% is considered “full substitution”. Conversely, novel compounds 
can also be trained as discriminative stimuli if they have psychoactive effects, and known 
compounds can be tested for substitution or antagonism of the novel compound. 
Asymmetries in cross-substitution (i.e., compound A substitutes for compound B, but 
compound B does not substitute for compound A) can indicate that the two compounds may 
have overlapping, but not identical mechanisms of action (e.g., Grant, 1999). Drug 
discrimination can be useful in investigating potential mechanisms of action of the trained 
discriminative stimulus by utilizing selective agonists and antagonists to either mimic or

block the effects. Subsequent paragraphs will examine discrimination studies assessing 
potential mechanisms of action of DMT.

DMT produced discriminative stimulus effects similar to those of the classic serotonergic 
hallucinogens DOM and LSD, as DMT fully substituted in DOM-trained rats (Glennon et al. 
1983; Glennon 1986) and produced full or near-full (78% drug appropriate responding) 
substitution in LSD-trained rats and pigeons (Appel et al. 1999; Helsley et al. 1998; Jarbe, 
1980). The effects of DMT seem to be mostly hallucinogen-like, as it produced only 50% 
drug-appropriate responding in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-trained 
rats, and produced a maximum of 37% drug-appropriate responding in methamphetamine-
trained rats (Gatch et al., 2009). In rats trained to discriminate between the 5-HT2A 
antagonist ketanserin and the 5-HT2A agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), 
DMT produced DOI lever-responding 80% or more of time (Smith et al., 1998), indicating 
that DMT acted more like a 5-HT2A agonist than a 5-HT2A antagonist.

Despite its very short duration of action, DMT can be trained as a discriminative stimulus 
(Gatch et al., 2009). A wide range of synthetic phenethylamine hallucinogens fully 
substitute for DMT, including DOM, DOC, LSD, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine 
(2C-D), 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine (2C-E), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-
iodophenethylamine (2C-I), whereas 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-C) and 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-2) produced a maximum of only 75% 
DMT-appropriate responding (Eshleman et al., 2014). In contrast, other tryptamine 
hallucinogens produced more equivocal effects, with DiPT and 5-methoxy-diethyl 
tryptamine (5-MeO-DET) producing full substitution, 4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyl 
tryptamine (4-OH-DiPT) and 5-methoxy-N-isopropyl-N-methyl tryptamine (5-MeO-IMPT) 
producing partial substitution, and 5-methoxy-α-methyl tryptamine (5-MeO-αMT) 
producing little if any DMT-like effects (Gatch et al. 2009; 2011). In addition, although 
DiPT fully substituted in DMT-trained rats (Gatch et al., 2011), DMT only produced 65 % 
DAR in DiPT-trained rats (Carbonaro et al., 2013). Taken together, these findings indicate 
that serotonergic hallucinogens largely produce discriminative stimulus effects similar, but 
not entirely identical to those of DMT.

3.2. Pharmacological Mechanisms

The mechanisms of action for hallucinogens are currently not well understood. The 5-HT2A 
receptor is thought to be necessary, but not sufficient for hallucinogenic effects, and 5-HT2C 
and 5-HT1A receptors may play important roles as well (see review by Nichols, 2004). DMT 
interacts with a variety of serotonin receptors, but also with ionotropic and metabotropic 
glutamate receptors, dopamine, acetylcholine, TAAR, and sigma-1 receptors. Current 
information on the roles of these receptors in mediating the effects of DMT is reviewed in 
the following paragraphs.

3.2.1. Serotonin—Most studies to date focus on DMT (and most classic psychedelics) as 
a partial agonist of serotonin (5-HT) receptors, primarily the 1A, 2A, and 2C receptor 
subtypes, with predominant interest at 5-HT2A receptors. DMT binds 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-
HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors with affinities

ranging from 39 nM to 2.1 μM ( Keiser et al., 2009). The 5-HT2A receptor is thought to be 
the primary target of classic serotonergic-mediated psychedelic compounds, such as LSD, 
DOI, psilocin, and mescaline, although 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors may also play some 
role (Aghajaian and Marek, 1999a, 1999b; review Nichols 2004). DMT has been reported to 
bind to all three of these receptors in a variety of studies, including the 5-HT1A (Pierce and 
Peroutka, 1989; McKenna et al., 1990), 5-HT2A (Lyon et al., 1988; Pierce and Peroutka, 
1989, McKenna et al., 1990; Smith et al. 1998), and 5-HT2C receptors (Smith et al., 1998; 
Nagai et al. 2007; Cozzi et al. 2009; Gatch et al., 2011).

Agonistic properties and affinities for 5-HT1A receptor vary among the classic psychedelics. 
Interestingly, agonist activity at the 5-HT1A receptor opposes the subjective effect of 5-
HT2AR agonists (Araneda and Andrade, 1991; Strassman, 1996; Jacob and Presti, 2005). 
DMT's affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor is higher compared to 5-methoxy-dimethyl 
tryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), 6.5 +/- 1.5 nM and 170 +/- 35 nM, respectively (McKenna et al., 
1990). A 5-HT1A antagonist significantly increased the reported psychological effects of 
DMT (Strassman, 1996). DMT, like other tryptamine hallucinogens, but not 
phenethylamines, inhibits dorsal raphe cell firing. This mechanism is hypothesized to be an 
underlying basis of psychedelic-like effects (Aghajanian et al., 1970), which may be 
mediated by stimulation of 5HT1A somatodendritic receptors (Sprouse and Aghajanian, 
1987; 1988).

DMT does bind to 5-HT1D receptor (Hamik and Peroutka, 1989; Heuring and Peroutka 
1987; Pierce and Peroutka 1989) and 5-HT3 receptor (Carbonaro, unpublished data), 
however little has been investigated to follow these results up. Delgado (2005) shows that 5-
HT1 and 5-HT3 receptors exert anxiolytic effects, which does correspond to some reports of 
DMT use. DMT is an agonist at 5-HT2C receptors. In drug discrimination, the DMT-like 
effects were partially blocked by a selective 5-HT2C antagonist, SB242084 (Carbonaro et al., 
2015). The 5-HT2C receptor is likely less significant in the psychedelic effects since 
tolerance develops to the 5-HT2C receptor (Smith, 1998). Little or no tolerance is developed 
to the subjective effects of DMT in clinical studies (Strassman, 1996).

DMT binds to the 5-HT2A receptor with relative high affinity IC50 75 +/- 1 nM (McKenna 
1990), yet other psychedelics that lack visual effects have a higher affinity for the 5-HT2A 
receptor (5-MeO-DMT; 14+/- 1 nM; McKenna et al., 1990). The 5-HT2A receptor seems to 
be necessary, but is not sufficient to account for the visual phenomenon common of the 
classic hallucinogens. Psychedelics and psychedelic-like compounds including MDMA, 5-
MeO-DMT, DET (review Wallach 2009), and DiPT (Gatch et al., 2011; Carbonaro et al., 
2015) are 5-HT2A receptor agonists. Subjective effects for these compounds are reported to 
be solely emotional, devoid of visual phenomenon common in other psychedelics such as 
DMT, except in rare circumstances where individual differences in biology seem to be the 
regulating factor (Wallach reviewed, 2009).

Head twitch response in rodents is thought to be a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavior 
produced primarily by psychedelics, although it is likely that other receptors play a role in 
this behavior, including 5-HT2C and glutamatergic receptors. Like other classic 
psychedelics, DMT does induce this head twitch response in C57Bl/6 mice, which is

blocked by 5-HT2A inverse agonist, MDL100907 (Carbonaro et al., 2015). However, the 
overall number of head twitches induced by DMT is much smaller compared to most other 
psychedelic compounds. DMT failed to produce this head twitch response in Swiss Webster 
mice (Fantegrossi et al., 2006) These discrepancies may be due to the rapid degradation of 
DMT or other peculiarities specific to DMT.

Functional selectivity on how psychedelic compounds modulate the 5-HT2 receptor family is 
not well understood. The 5-HT2 family of receptors are Gq/11 mediated and primarily use the 
phospholipase C second messenger system pathway (Brown and Tracy, 2013), but also an 
phospholipase A2 (Nichols, 2004). Phospholipase C hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 
membrane lipids generating inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerate. 
Diacylglycerate remains bound to the membrane and leads downstream activation of protein 
kinase C and increases the release of calcium from intracellular stores (Conn and Sanders-
Bush, 1984; Brown and Tracy, 2013). In particular, protein kinase C can mediate 
desensitization (Roth et al., 1995) of 5-HT2A receptors during drug exposure. Phospholipase 
A2 stimulation can lead to formation of arachidonic acid (Nichols, 2004). DMT stimulates 
arachidonic acid release (max 5-HT effect = 93%; EC50 = 260 nM) and less inositol 
phosphate formation (metabolite of IP3, max 5-HT effect = 39%; EC50 = 269 nM) via the 5-
HT2A receptor. Whereas inositol phosphate formation via the 5-HT2C receptor seems to be 
more efficacious and more potent (max 5-HT effect = 99%; EC50 = 114 nM; Eshleman et 
al., 2014). Stimulation of phospholipase A2 does not seem to directly related to the 
subjective effects of psychedelic compounds (Halberstadt, 2015; Kurrasch-Orbaugh et al., 
2003). Other pathways such as the phospholipase D may play a role, but DMT-mediated 
effects had not been thoroughly investigated. The importance of each second messenger 
pathway is an important area of future investigation.

DMT, like other classic hallucinogens increase 5-HT levels and/or decrease the turnover of 
5-HT (review Nichols, 2004). DMT increases excretion of IAA and 5-hydroxy IAA in 
humans (Szara, 1956). Other studies have reported an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in 5-
hydroxy IAA after DMT administration (Freedman et al., 1970; Randic and Padjen, 1971). 
DMT seems to have no effect on tryptophan hydroxylase (Andén et al., 1971), but produces 
a main effect on the rate of 5-HT turnover (Gillin and Wyatt, 1976). DMT inhibited SERT 
transport and VMAT2, acting as a substrate and not as an uptake blocker.

3.2.2. Glutamate and 5-HT/glutamate interactions—An approach gaining increasing 
interest within the last decade is to examine interacting roles of serotonin and glutamate in 
mediating the effects of DMT. Of particular interest are the roles of group II metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3), the NMDA receptor, and 5-HT2A receptors in modulating 
the levels of glutamate in the synapse. These group II glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) may 
also be potential target sites for mediating hallucinogenic effects (Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 
2007, 2008; Delille et al. 2012; Moreno et al. 2011; Winter et al. 2004).

mGlu2/3 receptor agonists can act presynaptically to suppress glutamate release, although 
the significance of this effect in mediating the effects of DMT has not been systematically 
studied. In contrast, mGluR2/3 antagonist increases the amount of glutamate in the synapse, 
creating a potentiation of hallucinogenic or psychedelic effects (Cartmell et al. 1999;

Forsythe and Barnes- Davies 1997; Ohishi et al., 1994; Shigemoto et al., 1997). The 5-HT2A 
receptor inverse agonist, MDL100907, fully blocked the discriminative stimulus effects and 
head twitched produced by DMT, whereas the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (SB242084) 
produced little or no effect on the discriminative stimulus effects of DMT. A mGlu2/3 
receptor agonist (LY379268) produced modest decreases in the discriminative stimulus 
effects of DMT, whereas a mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist (LY341495) facilitated the effects of 
low doses of DMT (Carbonaro et al., 2015). Comparatively, a mGluR2 agonist blocked the 
discriminative stimulus effects of LSD, whereas a mGluR2 antagonist facilitated the 
discriminative stimulus effects of LSD (Winter et al., 2004). Further, mGluR2 knockout 
mice showed little or no head twitch following 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-amphetamine (DOI), 
and some signaling was disrupted, which may mean that mGlu2 receptors are necessary for 
hallucinogenic activity (Moreno et al., 2011). Systematic administration of DOI increases 
glutamate efflux in ventral tegmental area (Pehek et al., 2006).

Electrophysiological studies suggest that stimulation of 5HT2A receptors in the medial 
prefrontal cortex increases pyramidal cell activity and may stimulate corticotegmental 
glutamatergic projection neurons (Aghajanian and Marek, 1997). A possible explanation for 
these effects is that mGlu2 receptors co-localize with 5-HT2A receptors to form 
heteroreceptor complexes (Delille et al. 2012; Gonzalez-Maeso et al. 2007; 2008). It has 
been suggested that the heteroreceptors induce a psychedelic-specific second messenger 
cascade (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007; 2008), although this has not been definitively 
established (Delille et al., 2012).

There has been some evidence that NMDA receptors may also play a role in mediating the 
effects of DMT. DMT partially blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of phencyclidine, 
which produces hallucinations through its actions at NMDA receptors (West et al., 2000). In 
addition, activation of sigma-1 receptor by DMT may lead to potentiation of NMDA 
receptors (Cozzi et al., 2009).

3.2.3. Dopamine—DMT lacks direct dopaminergic properties, since it did not stimulate 
dopamine (DA)-sensitive adenylate cyclase (von Hungen et al., 1975). This finding is in 
agreement with data from a behavioral technique often used to assess direct dopamine 
agonist effects, which records turning behavior in unilateral nigro-striatal lesioned rats. If a 
compound stimulates dopamine receptors directly, the animal will rotate toward the intact 
side (contralateral turning), otherwise if a compound induces dopamine release in the 
striatum from the nerve terminals of the intact side induces a rotation toward the lesion side 
(ipsilateral turning). As reviewed by Barker (1981), Pieri et al., (1974) suggest that DMT 
appears to have no dopamine receptor agonist effects, although higher doses of DMT (10 
mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) does produce ipsilateral turning, although were not indicative of a very 
potent dopamine releasing effect (Trulson et al., 1977; Stern and Dalsass, 1975). Another 
indication that DMT does not act directly at dopamine receptors is the lack of adenylate 
cyclase activity in the dorsal striatum of rats (von Hungen et al., 1975).

DMT-induced EEG activation in rabbits can be antagonized by neuroleptics (DA receptor 
blocking compounds (Moore et al., 1975). This may be due to blockade of downstream 
sequela. For example, DMT releases dopamine from presynaptic stores (Smith, 1975). This

release of dopamine in combination with the effects of MAO causes an indirect 
dopaminergic stimulant activity (Waldmeier and Maitre, 1977). DMT (20 mg/ml) caused 
42% decrease in concentration of dopamine in rat forebrain (5 - 60 min) while 
norepinephrine was not affected, no change in the levels of the dopamine metabolite 
homovanillic acid (HVA, a common marker for dopamine levels) was observed in corpus 
striatum. This decrease in concentration of dopamine may be caused by a stimulation of the 
release of dopamine or by inhibition of its synthesis (Haubrich and Wang, 1977). This 
decrease in dopamine levels is likely not related to change in synthesis, because no change 
in norepinephrine levels or turnover rate in the diencephalon were observed (Smith, 1977). It 
appears as if DMT increases central dopamine turnover and enhances striatal dopamine 
synthesis in rats (Smith, 1977).

Acute and chronic administration of DMT significantly increased endogenous levels of 
striatal 3-MT (3-methoxytyramine, a dopamine extraneuronal metabolite) (Waldmeier et al., 
1976). Dopamine steady state concentrations remained unchanged. Further, DMT increased 
accumulation of 3HDA and 3H3MT newly formed from 3HDOPA (Waldmeier and Meitre, 
1977). 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC, a major metabolite of dopamine) more 
efficiently lowered by DMT rather than HVA (Waldmeier and Meitre, 1977) in the striatum 
and whole brain. This is distinct from the effects of classic MAOIs, which decrease both 
DOPAC and HVA (Maitre et al., 1976; Waldmeier et al., 1976). After acute administration 
striatal dopamine synthesis was increased, yet there was no effect on steady state conditions. 
Dopamine degradation must be enhanced proportionally and is likely done so 
extraneuronally, due to the increase in 3-MT (Rech et al., 1971; Smith, 1977). No change in 
the increase of DA turnover over one month treatment (5 mg/kg, Smith, 1977), with 
consistent rises in 3-MT is observed.

3.2.4. Acetylcholine—Little investigation has occurred in reference to DMT's effect on 
acetylcholine. DMT significantly decreases concentration of acetylcholine in corpus 
striatum, which may be due to a direct release of acetylcholine, thus reducing concentration 
of striatal acetylcholine (Haubrich and Wang, 1977). Generally, acetylcholine levels in brain 
are reduced when its rate of release or turnover are increased (Haubrich and Wang, 1977). 
DMT had no effect on the level of acetylcholine in the cortex.

3.2.5. Trace Amine-Associated Receptors—Trace amine-associated receptors 
(TAARs) are a more recently discovered class of receptors which may play a role in 
mediating DMT and other psychedelic drug effects. The rat trace amine-associated receptor 
– 1 (rTAAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor with homology with members of the 
catecholamine receptor family. Trace amines p-tyramine, and p-PEA stimulate cAMP 
production, are commonly measured to assess activation of the TAAR. DMT binds to the 
rTAAR-1 with high affinity and acts as an agonist, causing activation of adenylyl cyclase 
and resultant cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells transfected with rTAAR1. Other 
psychedelics such as (+/-)DOI, d-LSD, and 5-MeO-DMT, and non-psychedelics such as 
R(+)lisuride, (+/-)MDMA and amphetamine also stimulate cAMP production through their 
effects at rTAAR1. This second-messenger cascade does not seem to be selective for any of 
these compounds as these effects occurred at approximately 1 μM concentration (no other

concentrations tested). rTAAR1 seems to be located in the intracellular puncta, and not at the 
plasma membrane in vitro; it is not known if this is the case in vivo (Bunzow et al., 2001).

Because TAARs were discovered long after research had on DMT (and other psychedelic 
compounds) had been initiated at the 5HT2AR, there is a paucity of research on the role of 
TAAR, which makes it difficult to discern what role this class of receptor may play in 
mediating the effects of endogenous and exogenously administered DMT. It is unknown 
whether the typically used 5-HT2AR antagonists ketanserin and/or risperidone have any 
antagonist effects of TAAR as well. This is an area where more research needs to be done to 
fully understand the importance of TAARs and psychedelic effects.

3.2.6. Sigma-1 receptor—The sigma-1 receptor was once thought to be a subtype of an 
opioid receptor. It has been implicated to have a role in several neurobiological diseases and 
conditions such as addiction, depression, amnesia, pain, stroke, and cancer (Collier et al., 
2007). It is found widely distributed though out the body including in the CNS, liver, heart, 
lung, adrenal gland, spleen, and pancreas (Hayashi and Su, 2007; Weissman et al., 1988). 
They are localized between endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion (mitochondria-
associated ER membrane; MAM). Sigma-1 receptor agonists signal the receptor to 
disassociate itself form other endoplasmic reticulum chaperones, which allows the receptor 
to act as a molecule chaperone to IP3 receptors. This enhances calcium signaling from the 
ER to mitochondria, activates TCA cycle and increase ATP production. Sigma-1 receptors 
can translocate to plasma membrane or sub plasma membrane area when stimulated with 
higher concentrations of agonists or when sigma-1 receptors are over-expressed. Once 
sigma-1 receptors translocate to the plasma membrane they can interact with and inhibit 
several ion channels (reviewed in Cozzi et al., 2009). Sigma-1 receptor activation can also 
lead to potentiation of NMDA receptors.

Psychedelics and non-psychedelics bind promiscuously to sigma-1 receptors. DMT binds to 
sigma-1 receptors at low micromolar concentrations. (EC50 = 14 μM) and appears to have 
agonist-like effects. DMT inhibits cardiac voltage-activated sodium ion channels at higher 
concentration (100 M) in HEK293 cells (inhibited 62 +/- 3%), COS-7 cells (inhibited 22 +/- 
4%; lower concentration of endogenous sigma-1 receptor), and neonatal mouse cardiac 
myocytes (inhibited 29 +/- 3%), induces hypermobility in wild-type mice, which is blocked 
in sigma-1 receptor knock-out mice (Fontanilla et al., 2009). DMT modulated current 
(patch-clamp) in sigma-receptor-mediated Na+ channels, which was reduced by sigma-1 
receptor knockdown and by progesterone (Johannessen et al., 2013). In addition, DMT 
synthesizing enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase is co-localized with sigma-1 
receptor in C-terminals of motor neurons (Mavlyutov et al., 2012), which suggests that there 
may be adequate levels of endogenous DMT to activate sigma-1 receptors.

The main problem with the theory that DMT is an endogenous sigma-1 receptor agonist is 
that it requires concentrations in the micromolar range, whereas selective sigma-1R agonists 
such as (+)-pentazocine have affinities in the nanomolar range (Fontanilla et al., 2009). If 
DMT is only available in trace amount in humans and is rapidly metabolized (Burchett and 
Hicks, 2006), how can DMT levels rise enough to account for sigma-1 receptor-mediated 
effects? One possible explanation for this is the three step process of accumulation and

storage discussed earlier, which includes active transport across the blood brain barrier, and 
DMT may be a substrate for transporters at the cell surface (SERT; Nagai et al., 2007) and at 
the neuron level (VMAT2; Cozzi et al., 2009). Supporting the role of sigma-1 receptor is that 
the SSRI fluvoxamine, has sigma-1 receptor agonist properties with higher affinity than 
DMT. Fluvoxamine works better with patients suffering from psychotic depression 
compared to antidepressants without sigma-1 receptor agonist properties (Stahl, 2008). 
Selective sigma-1 receptor agonists do not cause psychotomimetic effects in animals. At 
best, sigma-1 receptors may partially mediate the subjective effects of DMT (see review by 
Su et al., 2009).

Whether or not the sigma-1 receptor plays a significant role in the psychedelic effects of 
DMT, it may still play an important role in other physiological mechanisms. Sigma-1 
receptors agonists are potentially neuroprotective via several mechanisms (see review 
Frecska et al., 2013). DMT reduced inflammation ostensibly via sigma-1 receptor (Szabo 
and Rajnavdgyi, 2014), and can induce neuronal plasticity, which is a long-term recuperative 
process that goes beyond neuroprotection (Ruscher et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2009; Kourrich et 
al., 2012). Sigma-1 receptors can regulate cell survival and proliferation (Collina et al., 
2013), thus if DMT is an endogenous agonist, this may explain physiological relevance and 
importance of why DMT has 3-step uptake process.

Regulation of intracellular calcium overload, proapoptotic gene expression via Sigma-1 
receptors, can result in neuroprotection during and after ischemia and acidosis. There would 
be further benefit through sigma-1 receptor dependent plasticity changes (review Frecska et 
al., 2013; Kourrich et al., 2012; Ruscher et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2009). Along these lines 
Frecska colleagues (2013) suggest that DMT may be protective during cardiac arrest, 
beneficial during perinatal development, immunoregulation, and aid in reducing cancer 
progression as explained below.

3.2.7. Immediate early gene stimulation—Through second messenger systems, DMT 
can affect the rate of genetic transcription, such that DMT encodes the transcription factors 
c-fos (Frankel and Cunningham 2002), egr-1 and egr-2, which are associated with synaptic 
plasticity (O'Donovan et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007). Increases in expression of 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are also observed after DMT administration 
(Gewirtz et al., 2002). BDNF expression is associated with synaptic plasticity (O'Donovan et 
al., 1999), cognitive process such as memory (Jones et al., 2001) and attention (DeSteno and 
Schmauss, 2008), modulation of efficacy and plasticity of synapses (Soule et al., 2006).

3.2.8. Summary—As previously mentioned, DMT interacts with a variety of ionotropic 
and metabotropic receptors. The subjective effects of large doses of exogenous DMT are 
most likely mediated primarily by 5-HT2A receptors, with 5-HT2C receptors playing little or 
no role. mGlu2/3 receptors have significant modulatory effects, and the interaction of 
serotonergic and glutaminergic receptors may play a central role. DMT does not have direct 
effects on DA receptors, but indirectly alters the levels of dopamine, with resulting 
neurochemical and behavioral effects. Similarly, DMT also alters levels of acetylcholine. 
Finally, DMT may be an endogenous ligand at TAAR and sigma-1 receptors, but at the least, 
the effects of DMT at these receptors may play important physiological roles.

4. DMT as a model of psychiatric disorders

There has been a revival of interest in clinical uses of hallucinogens. Among the first were a 
series of controlled clinical studies on DMT (Strassman et al., 1994; 1996). Those studies 
reported that pure DMT had rapid and extremely strong cardiovascular effects as well as 
profound psychological effects. The cardiovascular effects preclude the use of pure DMT; 
however, ayahuasca and other DMT-containing ritual beverages seem to be less toxic while 
retaining the psychological effects. Based on studies of the health status of ayahuasca users, 
the use of ayahuasca may be safe and even beneficial (e.g., Barbosa et al., 2012; others from 
below).

Recently, a series of studies examined the long-term personal and spiritual significance of 
exposure to psilocybin (Griffiths et al., 2006; 2008; 2011), and others have suggested that 
psilocybin may be useful for anxiety-related disorders (e.g., Grob et al., 2011; Kometer et 
al., 2012). Similarly, ayahuasca and similar DMT-containing mixtures have been proposed 
as treatments for a variety of psychiatric disorders and ayahuasca is mostly well-tolerated. 
For example, long-term ayahuasca users showed less psychopathology, and better 
performance on neuropsychological tests compared to matched controls (Bouso et al., 2012) 
and less substance abuse and fewer psychiatric/psychosocial problems than matched controls 
(Fábregas et al., 2010). The following paragraphs will summarize evidence for medical 
applications of ayahuasca for treatment, and the following section will examine research on 
potential adverse effects of repeated use of ayahuasca.

4.1. Schizophrenia

The classic positive symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions and hallucinogens, so 
hallucinogenic compounds seem an obvious tool for modeling schizophrenia. Given that 
hallucinogens produce their effects primarily through activation of the 5-HT2A receptor 
(review Nichols, 2004), the serotonin system provides an alternative to the dopamine model 
of schizophrenia. The dopamine model has produced a wide range of treatment medications 
which are very useful, but do not fully treat the range of symptoms experienced during 
psychotic episodes and produce substantial adverse effects. Discovery that DMT exists as an 
endogenous compound led to research focusing on DMT as a model of schizophrenia in the 
1960s and 1970s. Reviews of this early research concluded that the data was suggestive but 
not conclusive (e.g., Gillin et al., 1976). These early studies are not reviewed in the present 
manuscript.

Subsequent research reported that levels of endogenous DMT increased in schizophrenic 
patients during psychotic episodes, which declined as their state improved (Checkley et al., 
1980; Murrary et al., 1979). However, no changes in DMT levels were observed in rapidly 
cycling states (manic-depressive) (Checkley et al., 1980). These findings renewed interest in 
the transmethylation hypothesis, which states that schizophrenia may be due to stress-
induced production of psychotomimetic methylated derivatives of catecholamines or 
indolealkylamines in the brain. DMT seems to fits the bill as it is an indolealkylamine, is an 
endogenous compound, and is linked to stress reactivity (see reviews by Myin-Germys and 
van Os, 2007; Grammenos and Barker, 2015).

In addition, DMT was identified as the active ingredient in ayahuasca (Pomilio et al., 1999; 
Ciprian-Ollivier et al., 1997), which produces effects similar to a psychotic episode, 
including thought disorders, delusions, and hallucinations (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, et al., 
2005). When given to human subjects, DMT produces complex visual and auditory 
hallucinations and increases cortisol levels (Strassman 1994; 1996), which supports its 
possible role as a possible mediator of schizophrenia.

More recent studies have examined the effects of DMT on various experimental models of 
changes in cognition in schizophrenic patients. Normal subjects are administered DMT and 
given various cognitive tasks to perform during fMRI scans. DMT slowed reaction time in 
tests of inhibition of return (Daumann et al., 2008; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, et al., 2006), 
decreased alertness (Daumann et al., 2010), but produced less mismatch negativity than did 
the NMDA glutamate channel blocker ketamine (Heekeren et al., 2008), which commonly 
serves as a tool for investigating the glutaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia.

In summary, DMT is still an interesting model of the serotonergic aspects of schizophrenia, 
but there is no conclusive evidence that endogenous DMT is a primary player. In fact, it has 
been argued that DMT is anti-anxiety/anti-psychotic via actions at the trace amino acid 
receptor (TAAR). Jacob and Presti (2005), and others have suggested that the effects of 
endogenous DMT are mediated via sigma receptor roles (see review by Grammenos and 
Barker, 2015 or refer to section in this review).

4.2. Depression

Few studies have investigated the effects of DMT-containing compounds on depression. One 
study investigated the effects of ayahuasca in the forced-swim test, a common animal model 
of depression. In female Wistar rats, ayahuasca increased swimming, which is considered a 
sign of potential antidepressant effects (Pic-Taylor et al., 2015). In a human experimental 
study, long-term ayahuasca users (>10 years) showed reduced ratings of hopelessness while 
under the influence (Santos et al., 2007). Finally, in an open-label clinical trial in in-patients 
suffering from depression, ayahuasca produced marked improvement in depressive 
symptoms with no mania or hypomania for up to up to 21 days after a single dose (Osório et 
al., 2015). Convergent evidence from three different experimental approaches (animal 
model, human experimental study, and a clinical trial) provides stronger evidence for 
potential antidepressant effects of DMT. However, replication of these findings will be 
necessary to confirm whether DMT-containing compounds will be useful for treatment of 
depression.

4.3. Anxiety/aggression

It has been proposed that DMT is an endogenous anxiolytic compound through its actions at 
the trace amino acid receptor (Jacob and Presti, 2005). To date, this hypothesis has generated 
little interest and DMT has been mostly investigated for its hallucinogenic effects. One early 
study did examine the effects of DMT in an animal model of anxiety/aggression in which 
pairs of rats receive shocks while in a test chamber. The shocks produce fighting and anti-
anxiety compounds reduce the shock-induced fighting. LSD increased the amount of 
fighting, whereas DMT suppressed fighting (Walters et al., 1978). However, the effective

doses also produce sedation and reduced locomotor activity, which could also account for 
the effects.

In a case study of a homeless male with multiple convictions for manslaughter and 
diagnosed with antisocial disorder, ayahuasca sessions reportedly produced significant moral 
insights and allowed completion of a rehabilitation program in which the subject had been 
highly resistant (Frecska et al., 2008). No follow up was conducted, so no data is available 
on whether incidences of violent behavior decreased. In two larger scale studies, ayahuasca 
decreased ratings of anxiety in depressive-disorder patients (Osório et al., 2015) and reduced 
ratings of panic but not state- or trait-anxiety, in long-term users (Santos et al., 2007). Taken 
together, these findings do not provide support that DMT is useful for treatment of anxiety 
and/or aggression. It is possible that DMT may be useful in specific settings, similar to the 
successful use of psilocybin to treat anxiety in cancer patients (Grob et al., 2011; Kometer et 
al., 2012), but careful experimental research will be necessary before a strong conclusion 
can be make about DMT's efficacy as an anxiolytic medication.

5. Effects on other organ systems

5.1. Cardiovascular system

Single doses of DMT produced rapid onset of marked sympathomimetic effects including 
increased heart rate and blood pressure (Strassman et al., 1994). When a 5-HT1A antagonist, 
pindolol, was co-administered with DMT, the increase in heart rate was diminished whereas 
the increase in blood pressure was enhanced (Strassman, 1996). Tolerance to the effects of 
DMT was tested by administration of DMT to human volunteers four times at 30-min 
intervals. A progressive decrease in heart rate was observed over the four doses, but not in 
blood pressure (Strassman, et al., 1996). In contrast, two repeated doses of ayahuasca 4-h 
apart reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate (Dos Santos et al., 2012). Long-term use 
of DMT-containing beverages may be of more concern as 14-day exposure to ayahuasca in 
rats altered the structure of the aorta, leading to a thickening of the walls of the aorta relative 
to the lumen diameter (Pitol et al., 2015).

5.1.1. Cardiac arrest—DMT has been speculated to aid in extending the survival of brain. 
A review by Frecska and colleagues (2013), suggests that during physical signals of agony, 
lungs synthesize large amount of DMT (primarily through the removal of INMT inhibitors) 
and can release DMT into arterial blood within seconds. Once in blood circulation DMT is 
safe from degradation as extracellular, circulating MAO enzymes deaminate only primary 
amines (McEwen and Sober, 1967). DMT is a tertiary amine, thus reaching the brain with 
minimal degradation. Through the use of active transport mechanisms already discussed for 
taking DMT from blood into the brain, could potentially keep brain alive longer without the 
brain having to produce DMT on its own. Exogenous DMT-like psychedelic effects are in 
essence similar to subjective reports provided after clinical death and near death experiences. 
Strassman (2001) believes DMT to be very likely involved in the dying process.

5.2. Endocrine system

Page 20

DMT increased levels of corticotropin, cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone when 
administered to human volunteers (Strassman et al., 1994). When DMT was given 
repeatedly to human volunteers (4 times at 30 min intervals), tolerance to the increases in 
various endocrine levels was observed, including corticotropin, prolactin and cortisol 
(Strassman, et al., 1996). Similarly, ayahuasca increased prolactin and cortisol levels in 
human volunteers (Dos Santos, et al., 2011; 2012), whereas repeated doses resulted in lower 
levels of GH secretion (Dos Santos et al., 2012).

5.3. Immune system and neurotoxicity

Ayahuasca has been reported to decrease the percentage of CD3 and CD4 lymphocytes, but 
to increase the number of natural killer cells (Dos Santos et al., 2011). It has been 
hypothesized that DMT might increase activity of the immune system and could prove 
useful as a treatment for cancer. Evidence for this hypothesis is equivocal. DMT increased 
the cytotoxic activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (e.g., lymphocytes and 
monocytes) in the A172 human glioma cell line (Tourino et al., 2013). However, in another 
study, DMT did not exhibit cytotoxicity of KB or HepG2 carcinoma cells (Gan et al., 2008). 
In addition, others have proposed that DMT and related compounds are anti-inflammatory 
and reported that DMT inhibited production of pro-inflammatory compounds IL-1β, IL-6, 
IL-8 and TNFα and increased levels of the anti-inflammatory compound IL-10 through 
actions at the sigma-1 receptor (Szabo et al., 2014).

5.3.1. Immunoregulation—Serotonin plays an important role with immunoregulation 
(Ahern, 2011; Cloez-Tayarani and Changeux 2007). And on cellular immune functions 
critical in the elimination of pathogens or cancer cells (Leon-Ponte et al., 2007; O'Connell et 
al., 2006). It is possible that DMT may also play a role in immunoregulation via its Sigma-1 
and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Sigma receptors are also expressed on many cells of the 
immune system (Gekker et al., 2006). In particular, Dorocq (1995) showed that sigma-1 
receptors can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance the production of anti-
inflammatory cytokine IL-10. DMT through the formulation of ayahuasca increased levels 
of blood circulating natural killer (NK) cells with concentrations as low as 1 mg DMT/kg 
body weight (Dos Santos et al., 2011). In vitro DMT administration has shown an increase 
of secreted interferons (beta and gamma) in vitro in NK cell and dendritic cell cultures. 
Interferons are potent anticancer factors (Caraglia et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Navajas et al., 
2012; Szabo et al., 2012; Windbichler et al., 2000). If DMT does increase interferon 
secretion, it may be beneficial in contributing to or aid in better elimination of malignant 
and/or infected cells.

5.3.2. Perinatal INMT Activity—Levels of INMT in the placenta are higher than in 
adults. It is speculated that activity in fetal lungs compensates for difference. INMT activity 
in rabbit lung is relatively high in fetus, increases rapidly after birth and peaks at 15 days of 
age. It then declines to mature levels and remains constant through life (Lin et al., 1974). If 
INMT levels are paralleled with increased DMT synthesis, it could be possible that DMT-
mediated sigma-1 receptor activity induces neuronal plasticity changes that can be expected 
for newborns. Selective sigma-1 receptor agonists have shown to be protective against

excitotoxic perinatal brain injury (Griesmaier et al., 2012) and ischemic neurodegeneration 
in neonatal striatum (Yang et al., 2012). Expression of INMT seems to be important for 
pregnancy success (Nuno-Ayala et al., 2012). Whether DMT, a product of INMT plays any 
role in these protective and beneficial effects, is unknown.

5.3.3. INMT and Cancer—Down regulation of the expression for the gene responsible for 
INMT production (Inmt) has been associated with cancer (Kopantzev et al., 2008, Larkin et 
al., 2012). It is believe to be a potential candidate gene in prevention of cancer progression. 
Inmt expression has been associated with a dramatic decrease in recurrence of malignant 
prostate (Larkin et al., 2012) and lung cancers (Kopantzev et al., 2008). It is possible that the 
regulating roles of Inmt via its product DMT could potentially have a direct tumor 
suppression effect, but this is role of DMT is unlikely, and highly speculative.

6. Summary and conclusions

DMT is a compound found widely across the plant and animal kingdoms. In mammals, the 
psychoactive effects produced by DMT seem to be largely mediated by the 5-HT2AR, 
although the complex subjective effects reported by DMT users are likely modulated by 
other receptor systems such as the metabotropic glutamate receptors.

The wide use of DMT in the form of ayahuasca for many years has led to a number of 
studies focusing on adverse health effects or potential benefits of ayahuasca use. There have 
been few reports of adverse health consequences (see review by Barbosa et al., 2012). 
Ayahuasca did produce modest impairment of cognitive function in inexperienced users; 
however, little or no impairment was observed in experienced users (Bouso et al., 2013). 
Ayahuasca decreased markers of sleep quality and sleep disturbances are common on the 
night following administration, but the users reported no perception of deterioration of 
quality (Barbanoj et al., 2008). As mentioned previously, there is little sign of tolerance or 
dependence to DMT except to the cardiovascular and endocrine effects, which actually 
could be viewed as the primary adverse effects. Diminution of these effects would preferred 
by long-term users. The greatest concern appears to the possibility of teratogenicity. Large 
doses of ayahuasca 50-fold higher than typical ritual doses (approx. 15 mg/kg DMT) were 
fed to pregnant rats. No lethality was observed, but increased incidence of cleft palate and 
skeletal malformations was observed in their pups (Gardner et al., 2014).

DMT may be an agent of significant adaptive mechanisms that can also serve as a promising 
tool in the development of future medical therapies (Frecska et al., 2013). There have been 
proposals that DMT might be a useful treatment of anxiety, substance abuse, inflammation, 
or for cancer. Experimental studies have been few and it is premature to conclude that DMT 
may have clinically relevant uses.

Highlights

•

•

•

•

N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous compound in both 
plants and animals.

Subjective effects of DMT are mediated by several neurotransmitter 
systems.

DMT may act as a neurotransmitter.

DMT has limited neurotoxicity and may have therapeutic significance.
