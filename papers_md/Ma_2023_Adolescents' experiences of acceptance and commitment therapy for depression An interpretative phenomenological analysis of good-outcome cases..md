Introduction:  Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  has  been  shown  to 
help  treat  depression.  However,  little  is  known  about  the  patient’s  experiences 
with ACT. This study aimed to learn how it was used in adolescents with major 
depressive disorder who have achieved good treatment outcomes.

Methods: Five adolescents with major depressive disorder with good treatment 
outcomes  of  ACT  were  enrolled  in  the  semi-structured  qualitative  interview 
and  analyzed  using  systematic 
interpretative 
phenomenological analysis.

textual  condensation  and 

Results:  Four  primary  themes  emerged  from  the  investigation.  “Therapist 
relationships  and  characteristics”  describes  the  therapist’s  receptiveness  and 
respect  for  adolescents  with  depression  and  having  a  trustworthy  and  sincere 
therapist. “Spaces to explore and experience” describes the ongoing process and 
content  of  acceptance  of  negative  emotions  and  mindfulness  practices  in  the 
healing  process.  “Do  important  things”  refers  to  values  and  committed  action. 
The “time settings” include the frequency and duration of treatment.

Conclusion:  Adolescents  make  positive  changes  with  a  receptive  and  respectful 
therapist by exploring themselves in a genuine and trusting therapeutic relationship. 
Improvement  seems  to  come  from  being  open  to  all  thoughts  and  feelings  and 
developing  the  ability  to  live  in  the  present  moment.  Teenagers  attach  great 
importance  to  value-oriented  behaviour.  Therefore,  treatment  should  target  the 
critical areas of depressed adolescents to guide them towards recovery effectively.

Background

Depressive disorder is a mental illness characterized by poor mood, loss of interest, pleasure, 
and various cognitive, somatic, and behavioral characteristics. Depression is a severe public 
health issue and one of the most common mental illnesses among children and adolescents. 
Depression in childhood and adolescence can disrupt social functioning, family relationships, 
and scholastic attainment, all of which damage career and social position, and major depression 
can lead to suicide (Sagatun et al., 2016; Clayborne et al., 2019).

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of the most representative experiential 
behavior therapies in the third wave of Cognitive and Behavior Therapy (CBT)(Hayes et al., 

Frontiers in Psychology

2013).  Systemic  ACT  treatment  promotes  psychological  flexibility 
through various procedures, characterized by using experiential and 
attentional exercises (mindfulness), metaphors, clarification of values 
and  the  undertaking  of  actions  committed  to  those  values.  ACT 
targets  psychological  flexibility  processes  by  strengthening  the 
following six core skills: acceptance (experiencing both pleasant and 
unpleasant  thoughts,  feelings,  memories  and  impulses  instead  of 
trying to control or avoid them), contact with the present moment 
(consciously engaging in any moment, being mindful of thoughts, 
feelings,  bodily  sensations,  and  potential  actions,  even  during 
distressing experiences), defusion (stepping back and observation of 
ideas as a representation of thought processes, seeing them for what 
they are and not as literal truths), self-as-context (developing a broad 
perspective on thinking and feeling and a nonevaluative, observing 
self), values (clarifying and defining fundamental values and goals to 
pursue  meaningful  work),  and  committed  action  (taking  effective 
action  guided  by  values;  Hughes  et  al.,  2017).  ACT  aims  to  help 
individuals  with  depression  reduce  mental  rigidity,  increase 
psychological flexibility, and adopt behaviors consistent with their 
values (Hayes et al., 2011).

ACT has gained more and more empirical support in treating 
depression (Twohig and Levin, 2017; A-Tjak et al., 2018). Studies have 
shown that ACT significantly improved participants’ psychological 
flexibility  and  emotional  regulation  and  ultimately  reduced  their 
depressive symptoms (Zemestani and Mozaffari, 2020). ACT is an 
effective treatment for depression when assessed in individual, self-
help, and group formats (A-Tjak et al., 2018; Kyllönen et al., 2018). A 
recent  meta-analysis  showed  that  ACT  significantly  reduced 
depressive symptoms compared to controls (Bai et al., 2020).

While these quantitative findings are essential, more research is 
needed to know how patients perceive treatment and the factors that 
influence the treatment effect. Patients’ treatment experiences can 
be  analyzed  qualitatively  to  improve  treatment  approaches  and 
outcomes (Robert, 2008). Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis 
(IPA) is a qualitative approach to the study of how people make sense 
of their lived experiences, with a particular focus on those experiences 
that are significant and particular to the individual (Smith et al., 2009). 
Some  researchers  used  IPA  to  examine  the  effects  of  short-term 
psychoanalytic  psychotherapy  (STPP)  on  the  major  depressive 
disorder in adolescents (Housby et al., 2021). IPA was proposed by 
Smith  and  is  based  on  phenomenological,  hermeneutic,  and  case 
study  theories,  suggesting  that  it  is  most  appropriate  when  one  is 
trying to explore how individuals perceive the particular situations 
they face and how they interpret their world and society, especially 
focusing  on  the  complex  journeys  of  their  cognitive,  linguistic, 
emotional,  and  physical  states  (Larkin  and  Thompson,  2011). 
Accordingly, IPA is an appropriate approach to explore the therapeutic 
experience  of  ACT  for  adolescents  with  depression.  However,  no 
qualitative  studies  have  been  conducted  on  adolescents  with 
depression  treated  with  ACT.  This  study  aims  to  fill  this  gap  by 
investigating the treatment experience of adolescents with depression. 
Therefore, the primary focus of this study is to explore how adolescents 
with depression improve through ACT, by increasing knowledge of

how  treatment  works,  with  the  aim  of  better  understanding  the 
mechanisms that may lead to positive changes in ACT treatment and 
providing a basis for improving clinical outcomes of ACT.

Method

Design

This was a qualitative study. Adolescent patients aged 12–18 years 
in the psychotherapy clinic of a mental health center in Shandong 
Province  were  recruited  for  the  study.  According  to  IPA 
recommendations, a sample size of 4–6 is recommended to adequately 
investigate each participant’s experience and to provide some cross-
case comparisons (Smith et al., 2009). In this study, a sample of five 
case interviews with good treatment outcomes in the act system was 
purposefully selected by the study objectives and empirical principles 
to  gain  an  in-depth  interpretive  understanding  completely  and 
accurately. All of them received systematic ACT therapy 20 times 
based on voluntary participation. The therapeutic experience is then 
analyzed through semi-structured qualitative interviews, systematic 
text enrichment, and phenomenological interpretation.

Data collection

In-depth  interviews  were  primarily  used  to  understand  the 
interviewees’  experiences  of  managing  their  depressive  symptoms 
through ACT treatment. Before the interview, the researcher prepared 
a tape recorder, an interview informed consent form, and an interview 
outline. Before the interview, the interviewer completed three main 
tasks:  self-introduction  and  relationship  building,  explaining  the 
purpose and procedures of the interview, and signing the informed 
consent  form,  emphasizing  the  maintenance  of  the  interviewee’s 
interests and the principle of confidentiality.

Semi-structured  interviews  require  the  researcher  to  design  an 
interview outline as the outline and basic framework of the interview 
according  to  the  questions  and  purposes  of  the  study  before  the 
interview is conducted, and to effectively collect the information and 
data needed for the study by talking with the interviewees. In our study, 
the  interview  outline  included  the  following.  (1)  adolescents’ 
impressions of how things changed after being sent to the psychotherapy 
room; (2) their experiences in therapy; and (3) adolescents were also 
allowed  to  describe  their  therapy  “stories”  in  the  interview,  which 
included some investigation of their interactions with the therapist.

In qualitative research, the researcher himself or herself is the 
research  instrument.  The  researcher’s  professional  background, 
gender,  age,  personal  abilities,  personality  traits,  past  research 
experiences, attitudes and experiences will affect the validity of the 
study. The researcher herself needs to be reflective and aware of her 
own identity at all times: the interviewer in this paper is a professional 
worker and researcher in clinical psychology with systematic training 
in  counseling  and  psychotherapy.  The  semi-structured  interviews 
were  conducted  face-to-face  in  a  psychotherapy  room,  and  each 
interview  lasted  about  60–90 min.  During  the  interview,  the 
interviewer could flexibly handle the interview questions according to 
the actual situation, and was not limited to the interview sequence of 
the  outline,  but  changed  the  focus  and  questions  of  the  interview 

Frontiers in Psychology

Ma et al. 

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1050227

according  to  the  specific  interviewees  and  the  progress  of  the 
interview, depending on the time and place. The interview outline was 
only used as a prompt to follow the interviewee’s emotions and stream 
of consciousness and to follow up and interact with the interviewee at 
the  right  time  to  understand  more  about  the  interviewee’s  inner 
experience. During the interview, the researcher began to hear the 
same conversation over and over again, indicating that data saturation 
had been reached and that it was time to stop collecting data and 
begin work on data analysis.

Participants

Table 1 shows that the participants ranged from 12 to 18 years old 
(mean = 15.28, SD = 1.40). They were chosen based on the following 
criteria: (1) They received systematic ACT treatment; (2) They had a 
successful treatment outcome, as measured by the fact that they no 
longer met the HAMD (Hamilton Depression Scale) (Hamilton, 1960) 
diagnostic  criteria  for  major  depression  at  the  end  of  treatment 
(20 weeks),  and  their  self-reported  MFQ  (Mood  and  Feeling 
Questionnaire) (Angold and Costello, 1987) decreased by at least 5 
points between baseline and end of treatment on the MFQ, which is 
considered to be the slightest clinically significant difference (Goodyer 
et al., 2011). Exclusion criteria: (1) adolescent patients who lacked the 
willingness to participate in the study; (2) concurrently receiving other 
genres of psychotherapy.

Ethics approval and consent to participate

Ethics approval (project ID: 2022YX043) has been granted by 
Weifang Medical University Ethics Committee. Participants and their 
legal  guardians  gave  verbal  and  electronic  informed  consent  to 
participate in this study.

Analysis

The data were analyzed using interpretive phenomenology. IPA is a 
recently developed qualitative study of psychology. Qualitative data 
analysis followed IPA standards. This study follows the three theoretical 
principles of IPA (phenomenology, hermeneutics, and hagiology), the 
research process is clear and transparent enough, reasonably organized, 
and each topic is supported by sufficient evidence.

First, the interviews were transcribed, and the first author read each 
transcript several times. First, the interviews were transcribed, and the

first author read each transcript multiple times. During the multiple 
readings, notes were made in the transcripts, including exploratory 
comments, to understand the participants’ experiences of managing 
depression. Second, the notes taken were turned into emergent themes 
following a thorough inspection of the individual transcripts to develop 
exact phrases at a higher level of abstraction to reflect the material. 
Third,  emerging  topics  were  categorized  based  on  conceptual 
similarities, generating clusters. A descriptive label was assigned to each 
theme. The study team was briefed on these. In practice, each case’s text 
was aggregated and differentially examined first, and then the text was 
aggregated  and  differentially  analyzed  again.  Smith  et  al.  (2009) 
recommend  that  researchers  determine  how  many  participants  an 
urgent theme or superordinate theme must be applied to be included in 
the  final  theme  structure  at  this  stage.  It  varies  depending  on  the 
project’s purpose, with recommendations ranging from one-third to all 
participants. This study aimed to determine what factors contribute to 
improvement in the ACT treatment modality. Therefore, the researcher 
deemed the themes retained to be appropriate in the accounts of most 
participants.  At  the  same  time,  themes  that  were  not  salient  to  the 
research question or did not apply to at least four participants were 
excluded. Finally, the themes were further evaluated and grouped to 
provide a final list of upper-and lower-level themes representing the 
participants’ everyday experiences.

Results

Adolescents experience several factors contributing to treatment 
improvement,  and  their  experience  under  ACT  conditions  is 
summarized into four main themes, as shown in Figure 1. This section 
describes  each  topic  and  provides  data  to  support  analytical 
interpretation. “Therapist relationships and characteristics” represent 
receptiveness and respect from the therapist and having a trustworthy 
and sincere therapist. “Spaces to explore and experience” describes the 
ongoing process and content of acceptance of negative emotions and 
mindfulness practices in the healing process. “Do important things” 
represents values and committed action. “Time settings” describe the 
treatment frequency and duration (see Figure 1).

Theme 1: Therapist relationships and 
characteristics

All treatment models agree that it is essential to establish a good 
therapist relationship, especially for the ACT. Almost all of the teens 
talked about the importance of therapeutic relationships.

FIGURE 1
The figure shows the different themes and main categories that experienced an improvement in ACT for adolescents.

Receptiveness and respect

Warm,  mutually  cooperative  relationships  are  naturally 
established when the therapist is fully present with the adolescent 
depression, receiving any emotional state that arises, dissociating from 
their judgments, and connecting with corresponding core values such 
as relationships. One adolescent said, “In the therapist’s presence, I felt 
I could speak about anything without worrying about how she was 
judging me, let alone trying to play up some supposedly good status 
deliberately.”  Another  patient  said,  “When 
the 
psychotherapist, I can express any emotional feelings and thoughts 
about myself as much as I want because she always receives these 
emotions  and  thoughts,  and  this  receptiveness  from  the  therapist 
makes me feel understood, and it feels great.”

talking 

to 

during the therapy session. As one adolescent said, “The therapist 
always asks for my opinion before each experience or exercise and 
never forces me to do it. “Another patient described it this way, “This 
receptiveness from the therapist would make me feel more and more 
stable, and this receptiveness was very powerful, and it was based on 
a profound understanding of me.” One patient said, “The feeling I get 
from the therapist is in stark contrast to the feeling I get from others 
around me. The family, relatives, and friends around me would always 
create a feeling in me that was so bad that it would make me feel 
wrong, negative, and always denied, and it played out like a terrible 
spell that cycled through my life.”

Trust and sincerity

The therapist brings receptiveness, compassion, and curiosity to 
the visitor with full attention, which is therapeutic. “No one has ever 
listened to me so intensely as she did, without randomly interrupting 
me or judging me for what I said or did, and her eyes made me feel 
warm  and  safe.”  When  describing  how  therapy  contributed  to 
improvement during the session, one patient said it this way, “Instead 
of being impatient with me, the therapist sat steady, and when she 
came to talk to me with a kind, receptive look, with a caring, relatively 
calm tone of voice, I found it helpful.”

The adolescent paid close attention to the therapist’s respect and 
receptiveness to the adolescent, as reflected in their words and actions 

Sincerity means the therapist is honest and open with the visitor 
without deception, pretense, or evasion. One teenager put it this way: 
“When  the  therapist  was  very  sincere  in  expressing  negative 
experiences and feelings about herself, I felt that she was sincere and 
not false, not pretending to be herself because of her role as a therapist, 
which made me trust her more. When I knew that we all need to 
overcome  the  same  struggles  that  we  encounter  in  life,  including 
disappointment,  rejection,  failure,  anxiety,  and  insecurity,  I  found 
myself much more relaxed at that moment when I felt that we were 
comrades in the same boat, easily trapped in our thoughts.”

Ma et al. 

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1050227

One of the adolescents had a previous unsuccessful experience 
with another service where he felt that the therapist was always giving 
him a ‘superior’ attitude, which made him unable to reveal his true 
self. As a result, he found it helpful to have an honest and trustworthy 
relationship in therapy.

Another patient described: “When the therapist asked, ‘Is it okay 
if we try this together, it was as if I was in cahoots with the therapist. 
This expression of hers made me feel that the therapist was helping 
me, was with me, was an invitation to me, not a correction or an order, 
so this part also triggered my motivation to want still to come next 
time.” One adolescent said, “I trust my therapist, which is essential to 
me, both in terms of her professionalism and character, and this trust 
makes me more motivated to engage in therapy.”

Theme 2: Spaces to explore and 
experience: Less talk and more action

This second theme describes the adolescents’ experiences of the 
sessions  themselves.  ACT  is  a  therapy  with  a  strong  emphasis  on 
action.  The  therapist  leads  the  visitors  through  many  experiential 
exercises that range from a dozen seconds to half an hour. When 
discussing how therapy has helped them, most visitors talked about 
the importance of sticking with the various experiences and exercises. 
One adolescent said, “I often receive touches and inspiration during 
some  of  the  experiences  and  exercise,  which  changed  me  a  lot.” 
Another patient said, “Understanding the principles of therapy and 
experiencing  the  process  are  two  completely  different  things,  so 
practice is crucial, and more action is helpful to me.” When talking 
about how exercises have helped her, one adolescent described it this 
way,  “The  therapist  would  sometimes  give  me  simple  homework 
assignments,  such  as  20  sessions  of  positive  breathing  exercises, 
anchoring exercises, to transfer the experiences and exercises in the 
therapy room into my daily life, which I found very helpful.”

Acceptance of negative emotions

Acceptance allows our thoughts and feelings to be as they are, 
whether pleasant or painful, to be open to them, to give up fighting 
them,  and  to  allow  them  to  be.  Permit  ourselves  to  have  painful 
personal experiences if such experiences enable us to follow our values 
and approach unwanted personal experiences with a complete, open, 
unguarded state of mind. One teenager said: “It is not about liking or 
wanting them. It is about making room for them and observing your 
feelings like a curious scientist.” Another patient said: “I will not waste 
my energy trying to get rid of them. Miraculously, I noticed they 
softened when I gave them some space.”

One patient had powerful anger toward herself, and the therapist 
guided her to become aware of her feelings and then visualized them. 
He described it this way: “The therapist asked me to feel the color and 
temperature of the emotion and then rate the intensity of my emotion. 
I  felt  that  the  intensity  of  the  anger  decreased,  so  I  thought  it 
was helpful.”

Another  patient  said:  “When  my  therapist  asked  me  to  try  to 
normalize  my  feelings  by  evaluating  them  on  a  scale  of  1–10  and 
naming them, I found my strained body beginning to relax. “.

Mindfulness practices

Mindfulness means stepping back from the past or a constructed 
future and focusing on the present nonjudgmentally. It enhances our 
conscious  awareness  of  the  present  moment,  enabling  us  to  grasp 
precisely  what  is  happening  at  the  moment,  gather  essential 
information to decide whether to change or persist in the behavior 
and thus help us to fully engage in what we are doing, increasing our 
sense of efficacy and satisfaction.

One adolescent described it this way: “The therapist told me to put 
my feet firmly on the floor, pay attention to the ground under my feet, 
and how I was sitting. I remember that was the first time I noticed that 
the pot of greenery on the table was that bright green color, and as a 
curious  scientist,  I  looked  at  it  closely  and  found  that  one  of  the 
greenery leaves was covered with yellow dots. It turns out that when 
we pay attention, life becomes much richer than what we take for 
granted in our minds.”

One patient said, “Pay attention to your breath, know that you are 
inhaling when you inhale, know that you are exhaling when you exhale 
and  be  aware,  observe,  and  experience  changes  in  your  body’s 
response. Through the practice of watching the breath, observing the 
body, externalizing it, visualizing it, and keeping myself away from it, 
it is still there, not gone, but becoming less of an influence on me. But 
I  can  jump  out,  several  times  with  the  practice  of  breathing,  and 
imagine myself pulling away.” Another teenager said, “When I am in 
a certain situation, I try to experience what my body is feeling and 
how it feels. Through this practice, I try to be with my emotions.”

One patient said how the practice of mindfulness practices had 
helped her: “I find it a seemingly simple but difficult thing to pay 
attention to my breath, always getting carried away by what is going 
on inside my head, but by sticking with it, I find that a certain moment 
frees  me  from  the  endless  thoughts  and  becomes  slightly  calmer 
because the breath is always in me, the breath is always in the present 
moment.  Practicing  positive  breathing  for  10–20 min  daily  is 
very helpful.”

Theme 3: Do important things

Clarify values: Know what is essential

Values  are  statements  about  what  we  want  to  do  in  life,  what 
we want to believe, and how we want to behave on an ongoing basis. 
They are the guiding principles that guide and inspire us forward in 
life. This outcome motivates everything we do in the ACT field: we do 
not  want  someone  to  accept  pain,  practice  defusion,  or  expose 
themselves to challenging situations unless that behavior makes their 
life more prosperous or more fulfilling.

One teenager with severe test anxiety that he felt his life had no 
meaning said through values clarification during therapy, “Maybe 
getting into a good high school is not the end. Being a hard worker is 
the meaning I seek.”

One teenager said, “To be loved and respected by others, I want to 
strive to be a person who makes myself loving and respectable. There 
are many things I can do in this direction.”

One patient said, “It finally became clear to me that what I needed 
to do most was act courageously rather than reduce my feelings of 

Frontiers in Psychology

10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1050227

anxiety. Understanding this has made me feel like I have a choice 
about my life.”

One  teenager,  who  was  always  influenced  by  her  teachers’ 
behavior and liked to judge them, said, after clarifying her values, “I 
want to become a person who learns to be accepting, understanding 
and appreciative.”

One patient chose the value of solidarity and closeness with her 
family, and she was particularly concerned about correspondence 
with  her  mother,  saying,  “I  want  to  adopt  behaviors  that  are 
consistent with the direction of the value–to increase support for 
my family and to reduce harm to my family, any time I can act in 
that direction.”

Committed action

Committed  action  means  adopting  increasingly  effective 
patterns of behavior guided and facilitated by values; it also means 
acting flexibly. Every therapy session requires committed action. 
The  therapy  is  committed  to  action,  conducting  mindfulness 
practices  or  discussing  topics  about  suffering  and  doing  ACT 
homework. One teenager said, “When we commit to practice by 
turning our values into concrete goals, the process is not always 
smooth, and there are always psychological obstacles.” One patient 
said, “Change usually brings discomfort, usually anxiety. We must 
accept  that  discomfort  and  move  on  rather  than  stay  in  our 
comfort zone.”

When we want to change, our brain generates negative thoughts 
such as I’m depressed, I cannot do it, it is too difficult, there is not 
enough time, and so on. Then you can practice defusion exercises. 
One teenager said, “Thank the brain, good reason to give.”

Once an area of life and some core values are identified, learning 
to take small steps is important; as one teen put it this way, “Get clear 
on what your small step forward is going to be in the future and make 
sure it is the easiest and most likely to be done in the next 24 h.”

One patient said, “The therapist asks me to say my commitments 
aloud and accurately, which is a little shy and uncomfortable, but 
makes sure I can make room for those thoughts and feelings.”

Theme 4:Time settings

The time setting refers to the frequency of the sessions and 
duration  of  the  sessions.  For  different  reasons,  adolescents 
expressed satisfaction with the duration of treatment, which was 
initially 20 weeks. One patient talked about the adolescent’s unique 
condition and how they would be treated. Because of the complex 
changes  in  her  life,  she  was  allowed  to  continue  her  effective 
treatment  after  the  first  20 weeks:  “If  the  treatment  had  been 
stopped at the end of the session, I believe I would have felt empty 
inside, and in my situation at the time, I would have been very 
uncomfortable with the changes.” “The ability to receive a lengthy 
enough  therapy  period  was  quite  important  for  me,”  another 
added, “since I do not think a short-term treatment would have 
allowed me to do much.” One adolescent mentioned, “The weekly 
time made aside for continuous treatment has been critical to my 
progress  in  therapy,  and  I  believe  it  is  just  as  important  as  the 

therapy itself. Throughout the process, I always sense the therapist’s 
support and companionship, and that support and companionship 
are consistent and empowering.” Another patient discussed the 
advantages of having weekly appointments for that therapy “It is 
beneficial to have a clear plan to maintain a consistent time each 
week. It is a fantastic method to make daily living easier.”

Discussion

The  study  revealed  four  themes  important  to  adolescent 
progress: “Therapist Relationships and Characteristics,” “Spaces to 
explore  and  experience,”  “Do  important  things,”  and  “Time 
setting.” Our findings are consistent with previous studies of ACT 
interventions  (Østergaard  et  al.,  2020).  Patients  experienced 
improvement  through  extensive  exploration  and  experience 
(acceptance of negative emotions and mindfulness practices) and 
building a relationship with the therapist (therapist relationships 
and characteristics). Doing essential things (values and committed 
action)  motivates  patients  to  change.  Patients  acquire  more 
appropriate internal working patterns and see progress over time 
(time setting). These factors should be considered when treating 
adolescent depression. As seen in Figure 1, the four themes are 
made up of dynamic elements. We refer to them as “improvement” 
and discuss some key components below.

The first theme emphasizes the critical role of the therapeutic 
relationship in treatment. First, therapists help depressed teens by 
communicating receptiveness and respect. This study’s findings are 
consistent with prior research (McCann et al., 2012; Binder et al., 
2016; Jones et al., 2017). Therapist listening and support are crucial 
factors  in  teenagers’  willingness  to  participate  in  therapeutic 
procedures  (Wilmots  et  al.,  2020).  Adolescents  see  therapists  as 
“friendly”  persons,  and  therapists  build  an  equal  and  cooperative 
connection  with  them  through  respect  and  receptiveness.  When 
therapists  take  an  “expert”  stance,  making  assumptions  without 
genuinely listening to the experiences of adolescents, this attitude is 
viewed  as  disrespectful  and  interferes  with  the  development  of 
effective  therapeutic  connections.  Adolescents  who  felt  heard  and 
could talk about anything in a nonjudgmental atmosphere indicated 
a  level  of  freedom  they  did  not  have  access  to  in  other  support 
networks  in  this  study.  It  helps  depressed  teenagers  create  solid 
therapeutic relationships and boosts their motivation to overcome 
obstacles. This key point must be considered by therapists treating 
adolescent depression.

Adolescents are also more likely to participate in the treatment 
process and receive therapeutic experience if they see therapy as a 
collaborative  effort  and  believe  their  therapist  is  a  genuine  and 
trustworthy  individual  who  cares  about  their  emotional  and 
psychological well-being (Marotti et al., 2020). The above findings are 
consistent with this study’s findings in creating positive change. This 
finding  could  be  because  adolescents  are  in  a  unique  period  of 
transition from childhood to adulthood, with a focus on autonomous 
decision-making in collaboration (Noyce and Simpson, 2018), and 
therapists’ sincerity and trust can help improve adolescent depression 
patients’ treatment adherence and willingness to cooperate, as well as 
promote  the  development  of  their  self-awareness.  There  will  be  a 
positive change.

The second theme describes the adolescents’ experiences in 
these programs. According to this research, acceptance of negative 
emotions is critical in treating depression. Research has found that 
experience  avoidance  has  been  identified  as  an  essential 
contributing factor to depression (Shallcross et al., 2010; Rueda 
and Valls, 2016). Empirical avoidance refers to the suppression or 
avoidance  of  unwanted  “personal  experiences,”  usually  in 
rumination, in which people deliberate (Berzonsky and Kinney, 
2019), while acceptance is an alternative to experiential avoidance. 
Acceptance  is  giving  up  the  struggle  for  inner  thoughts  and 
exploring  inner  feelings  and  thoughts,  whether  pleasant  or 
unpleasant, in a positive and curious state of mind (Hayes et al., 
2012).  It  is  an  action  taken  on  inner  experiences  (Twohig  and 
Levin, 2017). In these ACT cases where the treatment is good, the 
therapist guides them to re-recognize the negative emotions; trying 
to eliminate all negative feelings and thoughts is impossible. It may 
be a wrong and ineffective direction. Conversely, when depressed 
adolescents  stop  trying  to  fight  and  eliminate  these  negative 
emotions  and  allow  them  to  exist  naturally,  positive  Change 
occurs, which is generally thought to help improve the effectiveness 
of psychotherapy.

Mindfulness is the ability to take a step back from the past or 
an 
imagined  future  and  focus  on  the  present  moment 
nonjudgmentally  (Zettle,  2007).  This  study  backs  up  previous 
findings, and clinical investigations have shown that Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction can lower emotional discomfort and stress, 
which  is  good  for  mental  health  (Díaz  González  et  al.,  2018). 
Studies  have  discovered  mindfulness  mediates  depression 
outcomes (Kuyken et al., 2010; Spijkerman et al., 2016); Preventing 
lapses  into  verbally  manufactured  judgments,  appraisals,  and 
comparisons  (Luoma  and  Villatte,  2012)  requires  awareness  of 
moment-to-moment sensory and physical experiences. Therapists 
employed  mindfulness  practices  to  teach  depression-stricken 
teenagers how to interact with the present moment in a focused, 
spontaneous, and flexible manner, allowing them to respond more 
flexibly and meaningfully to internal and external obstacles.

The  third  theme  highlights  the  vital  role  that  values  and 
commitment  play  in  the  healing  process.  Loss  of  value  has  been 
highlighted  as  a  fundamental  component  of  the  development  of 
depression, according to Hayes et al. (2012), Ratcliffe (2012), Frankl 
(2014), Chan et al. (2020). A link between values and psychological 
suffering has been discovered in numerous studies (Reilly et al., 2018; 
Grégoire et al., 2021). As a result, the goal of this study is to encourage 
adolescents  to  take  more  explicit  value-based  acts.  It  has  been 
discovered that values-oriented exposure allows the client to truly 
experience  the  meaning  and  effect  of  the  treatment-induced 
discomfort. ACT’s capacity to make significant progress in the action 
stage  is  based  on  helping  clients  articulate  their  true  beliefs.  This 
aspect is something that therapists who work with depressed teens 
should consider.

The fourth theme highlights the element of time setting. Time was 
linked to the experience of getting a sufficient number of therapy 
sessions as a helpful setting, and all five patients in this study had had 
20 sessions. The improvement was aided by fixed weekly visits with 
the  therapist  instead  of  irregular  appointments.  Adjusting  the 
frequency  and  duration  of  treatment  cycles  to  meet  the  changing 

needs  of  adolescents’  daily  lives  can  help  improve.  This  finding  is 
consistent with the findings of Gibson et al. (Gibson and Cartwright, 
2013). Adolescents appear to experience a possibility of maturation 
and growth with the vital aid of their therapist over time, during, and 
between therapy sessions. Well-established therapy period can provide 
the steadiness that an adolescent needs amid the chaotic and stressful 
stages of their life.

Strengths, limitations, and future research

The main strength of this study is the in-depth focus on the 
experiences  of  those  who  engage  in  ACT,  as  no  studies  have 
examined this experience to date. The specific methodology of IPA 
means  that  participants  who  express  less  about  their  therapy 
experience are equally represented in the data, which provides a 
rich  representation  of  convergence  and  divergence  in  their 
backgrounds that is not possible using other methods. However, 
caution  should  be  exercised  when  considering  how  the  results 
transfer to the experiences of other adolescents, whether in impact 
studies  or  different  Settings.  The  fact  that  these  therapies  are 
offered as part of clinical trials also limits the transferability of 
research results. The sample included adolescents interviewed as 
part  of  routine  clinical  psychotherapy  practice,  meaning  their 
particular experiences might set them apart. Because our selection 
had only those who did “well” on treatment, it was impossible to 
extrapolate the experiences of those who did less well. Because the 
sample population is concentrated in Weifang, Shandong Province, 
promotion  to  the  broader  international  population  may  also 
be limited.

In addition, with the development of the Internet and communication 
technology, the combination of ACT with low-cost, easily accessible self-
help treatment is one of the directions for future research.

Conclusion

The study examined the experiences of five adolescents with 
depression in improving ACT. With a therapist who is receptive 
and respectful of adolescent patients, they make positive changes 
by  exploring  themselves  in  a  sincere  and  trusting  therapeutic 
relationship. Progress seems to come through being open to all 
thoughts  and  feelings  and  developing  the  ability  to  live  in  the 
present moment. They attach great importance to value-oriented 
behavior,  using  core  values  to  guide,  motivate  and  encourage 
themselves to change their behavior. Furthermore, we think that is 
the critical thing that therapists need to pay attention to in the 
treatment of depression, and these themes help identify what it is 
about depressed adolescents that makes ACT effective in guiding 
them toward recovery.
