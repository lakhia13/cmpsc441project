Abstract

Since marital distress is a multidimensional phenomenon, research efforts directed at identifying 
meaningful groups of individuals with common characteristics based on their dissatisfaction in 
various relationship domains are important. In addition, it is important to examine this association 
not only among White majority-group couples but also among other ethnic groups, such as 
Mexican American couples, who may differ in terms of cultural values and customs. A latent class 
analysis (LPA) of Caucasian and Mexican American newlyweds’ (N = 278) self-reported marital 
distress identified four such groups. These groups showed a continuum of dissatisfaction as well as 
varying degrees of differences in partners’ views of traditional versus non-traditional gender roles. 
The classes resulting from the LPA were related to individuals’ mental health. Those individuals 
who found themselves in groups with higher distress also experienced higher levels of anxiety and 
depression than those individuals who found themselves in groups with lower distress. Although 
more research is clearly needed among larger and more diverse samples, the present findings 
may be useful to the field of marriage and family therapy in that they may guide prevention and 
intervention efforts in the field of marital distress and mental health.

Romantic relationship health is a commonly underappreciated public health aspect (Cordova 
et al., 2014). This is concerning in light of consistent research findings drawing connections 
between marital distress and an increased risk for other health problems, such as decreased 
physical and mental health (e.g., Whisman, 2007; Whisman & Uebelacker, 2006). Marital 
distress is a multifaceted phenomenon in that individuals may experience dissatisfaction in 
certain dimensions of their relationships (e.g., sexual dissatisfaction) but not others (e.g., 
dissatisfaction with non-sexual intimacy; Snyder, 1979). Thus, a nuanced understanding of 
groups of individuals who experience marital distress on similar dimensions and to a similar

degree has important implications on marriage and family therapy in that this approach has 
the potential to inform targeted marital distress prevention and intervention programs.

Being in a romantic relationship in general and being married in particular has beneficial 
consequences for partners across ethnic groups; however, available evidence suggests that 
marriage is especially highly valued among Mexican Americans. More specifically, Mexican 
Americans tend to be more positive toward marriage, compared to singlehood, than Whites, 
and even other Latina/o groups, such as Puerto Ricans (Oropesa, 1996). The importance 
of marriage is also suggested in some of the statistics surrounding dissolution of marriage 
among Latinas. For example, the median duration of first marriages that end in divorce is 
slightly higher among Latinas/os (8.1 years), compared to Whites (7.8 years), and among 
Latina women, the divorce rate for first marriages overall is lower (34%) than among 
White women (41%) (Kreider & Ellis, 2011). Likewise, the concept of familism among 
Mexican Americans points to the overall centrality of family relationships, including the 
couple relationship (Bean, Curtis, & Marcum, 1977; Sabogal, Marín, Otero-Sabogal, Marín, 
& Perez-Stable, 1987).

Unfortunately, the mental health needs of Mexican Americans, including married couples, 
are underserved, and researchers point to the continuing importance of developing culturally 
competent therapeutic services for this group (Bean, Perry, & Bedell, 2001; McNeill, Prieto, 
Ortiz, & Yamokoski, 2004). As marriage is a central and important component in the lives 
of Mexican Americans, greater attention to how marital distress influences the mental health 
of marriage partners is critical to investigate so that marriage and family therapists can adapt 
the services they provide according to clients’ cultural and ethnic backgrounds.

The goal of this study was to identify meaningful groups of newlywed partners with 
common characteristics based on their self-reported ratings of marital distress in various 
relationship domains. In addition, each of the resulting groups’ risk for mental health 
problems, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, was examined to validate the 
latent classes and to identify those groups that were at particularly high versus low risk.

Profiles of Maritally Distressed Individuals

Marital distress may be evident in multiple dimensions of a romantic relationship and may 
occur to different degrees along these dimensions. Previous research has identified a variety 
of components that make up overall levels of distress, including partners’ dissatisfaction 
with the overall relationship; communication behaviors; aggression and violence; time spent 
together and apart; handling of financial matters; and sexual aspects of the relationship 
(Snyder, 1979). Using cluster analysis, Snyder and Smith (1986) derived an empirically 
based classification system of marital relationships based on a multidimensional self-report 
measure of marital interaction. The authors came up with a five-cluster solution for both 
men and women: Types I and II reflect relatively non-distressed relationships. These two 
groups were distinguished only by the fact that Type II individuals denied even minor 
marital difficulties and described their marriage in unrealistically positive terms as compared 
to Type I individuals. Type IV and Type V clusters for both sexes were characterized by 
extensive marital distress, marked by overall dissatisfaction as well as moderate to high

scores on other scales reflecting communication deficits, discontent with the quality and 
amount of leisure time together, sexual dissatisfaction, and disagreement about finances. In 
addition, Type V individuals were dissatisfied with their children and childrearing in general. 
Finally, Type III individuals were characterized by moderate levels of distress.

An alternative and, in the opinions of some, more advantageous, approach to cluster 
analysis, latent profile analysis (LPA), also allows examination of multiple dimensions 
of distress. LPA, which is a multivariate approach, is more flexible than cluster analysis 
(Hagenaars & McCutcheon, 2009) and allows grouping of individuals based on multiple 
variables simultaneously, thereby creating different “profiles” (Orpinas, Raczynski, Peters, 
Colman, & Bandalos, 2014). LPA can thus be used to identify subgroups of individuals with 
distinct patterns of relationship dissatisfaction that may serve as risk and protective factors. 
LPA is an exploratory method. Therefore, the number of latent classes is not known a priori 
and statistical fit indices, parsimony, and interpretability of results guide the selection of the 
final class solution (Orpinas et al., 2014).

Marital Distress and Mental Health

To validate the profiles resulting from LPA, it is useful to examine their association with 
theoretically relevant external measures. In the present study, we compared the latent 
profiles based on self-reported marital distress in various domains with self-reported 
symptoms of anxiety and depression. Extensive research has documented the relationship 
between marital distress and mental health problems, such as depression (Gabriel, Beach, 
& Bodenmann, 2010; Kouros & Cummings, 2010; Whisman, 2007) and anxiety (McLeod, 
1994; Taft, Watkins, Stafford, Street, & Monson, 2011; Yoon & Zinbarg, 2007). Marital 
distress is also significantly associated with seeking mental health services among those 
who are married (Whisman & Schonbrun, 2010). Furthermore, relationship problems predict 
poorer therapy outcomes for those diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders (Yoon 
& Zinbarg, 2007); conversely, interventions that focus on improving the quality of the 
relationship can lead to improved psychological well-being in both partners and even to 
greater general life satisfaction, at least among women (Pihet, Bodenmann, Cina, Widmer, & 
Shantinath, 2007).

A growing body of longitudinally-based research on marital satisfaction and mental health 
has focused on the directionality of the relationship between these variables. In couples at 
a later stage of marriage and where one partner has a chronic disease, higher depressive 
symptoms in both spouse and patient led to decreased marital satisfaction in both partners 
(Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, & Cartwright, 2009). On the other hand, a meta-analysis 
of both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies that investigated the association between 
marital quality and personal well-being found that the relationship was strongest between 
these two variables when personal well-being was the outcome variable (Proulx, Helms, & 
Buehler, 2007). Other longitudinal research shows that the directionality of effects differs 
by gender—women’s depression is predicted by their marital satisfaction, whereas men’s 
marital satisfaction is predicted by their depression (Fincham, Beach, Harold, & Osborne, 
1997). At this point in time, longitudinal studies that include cross-partner effects between 
marital satisfaction and mental health are not plentiful enough to determine conclusively the

directionality of the relationship between marital satisfaction and mental health (Proulx et 
al., 2007), but the preponderance of data up to now points strongly to the role of marital 
quality in predicting the mental health of marriage partners. Thus, anxiety and depression 
were chosen as outcome variables in the present study.

Despite the large amount of research on the relationship between marital distress and 
mental health among married couples, little of this research includes a focus on diverse 
samples, such as Latinas/os in general, or Mexican Americans in particular. Nonetheless, 
the few available studies that investigate this relationship among Mexican Americans tend 
to show similar results. For example, Santos, Bohon, and Sanchez-Sosa (1998) found that, 
in a sample of Mexican immigrants, conflict in marital relationships was directly related 
to mental health distress. Likewise, in a sample of immigrant Mexican women, Vega, 
Kolody, and Valle (1988) found that marital strain was related to depression, although 
this relationship was moderated by coping skills and cognitive factors. Another study with 
Mexican American women found that marital satisfaction leads to lower depression levels 
(Saenz, Goudy, & Lorenz, 1989). Finally, Sarmiento and Cardemil (2009) demonstrated 
that, in a sample of Latina/o couples from differing Latin American backgrounds, poorer 
family functioning was related to greater depression among women, although this effect 
was moderated by acculturative stress, in that Latinas higher in acculturative stress reported 
greater depression.

Mexican Americans are the largest Latina/o subgroup and they are projected to make up 
30% of the U.S. population by the year 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Therefore, greater 
investigation into how marital distress is linked to mental health among this specific group 
is especially relevant and important to understand. Such research may also contribute to 
development of more culturally appropriate therapeutic interventions for distressed Mexican 
American couples and, thus, may have important implications for marital and family 
therapy.

Studying newlywed couples may be particularly informative when examining factors 
associated with marital distress and mental health as newlyweds find themselves in a 
particularly formative period of their partnership. In the first years of their marriage, couples 
are more likely to experience dramatic changes in relationship quality (e.g., Neff & Karney, 
2005). In addition, newlyweds’ behaviors and changes in their union at the onset of marriage 
foreshadow long-term marital fate, which in turn may be related to other outcomes, such as 
partners’ mental health symptoms (Huston, Caughlin, Houts, Smith, & George, 2001).

The Present Study

The main objective of the present study was to identify meaningful latent profiles of marital 
distress among newlywed individuals based on their self-reported ratings of dissatisfaction 
with various relationship domains. No predictions were made about the specific number of 
latent classes resulting from these analyses. Rather, an exploratory approach, concordant 
with the analytic strategy of LPA, was taken. A second objective was to investigate the 
validity of these latent profiles by examining differences on self-reported symptoms of 
anxiety and depression between groups. We expected that partners in classes with overall

partners in other groups.

Method

Participants and Procedure

Materials

Data from 139 heterosexual couples (N = 278 individuals) were collected. Couples 
were recruited from the community through media advertisements, flyers, and in-person 
solicitation in Southern California. To be eligible for the current study, participants had 
to be 18 years of age or older, within the first 12 months of their first marriage, and 
both partners were required to identify themselves as of the same ethnicity, either both 
Caucasian American or both Mexican American. Upon completion of an initial screening 
questionnaire, each partner was interviewed separately, either in face-to-face, telephone, 
or self-administered interviews. The average interview time was 40.92 minutes (SD=1.96). 
Participants completed measures assessing a variety of dimensions related to marital distress 
as well as mental health. In addition, a brief demographic questionnaire was administered. 
As incentives, participants received $25 for the interview (for a total of $50 per couple). 
In the current sample, men ranged in age from 18 to 62 years (M = 29.04, SD = 8.10) 
and women ranged in age from 19 to 60 years (M = 27.96, SD = 8.35). One hundred and 
twelve participants (40.3%) identified as Caucasian American and 166 participants (59.7%) 
identified as Mexican American.

Marital Distress.—The Marital Satisfaction Inventory-Revised (MSI-R; Snyder, 1997) 
was used to assess participants’ marital quality. The MSI-R consists of 150 True-False 
items (coded as 1 versus 0) that cover different domains of marital interaction. In addition 
to these domain-specific scales, the MSI-R contains two validity scales, the Inconsistency 
(INC) and the Conventionalism (CNV) scales. For the purpose of the present study, these 
two consistency scales as well as the two scales tapping into dissatisfaction connected to 
couples’ children (Dissatisfaction with Children [DSC] and Conflict over Child Rearing 
[CCR]) were not included because 187 participants (67.3%) indicated that they did not have 
children). Thus, a total of nine MSI-R content scales were included in the analyses:

Global Distress (GDS; 22 items; α = .86).: Measures individuals’ overall dissatisfaction 
with the relationship.

Affective Communication (AFC; 13 items; α = .75).: Evaluates the respondent’s 
dissatisfaction with the amount of affection and understanding expressed by his or her 
partner.

Problem-Solving Communication (PSC; 19 items; α = .85).: Assesses the couple’s 
general ineffectiveness in resolving differences, and measures overt discord rather than 
underlying feelings or estrangement.

Aggression (AGG; 10 items; α = .74).: Assesses the level of intimidation and physical 
aggression experienced by respondents from their partners.

Time Together (TTO; 10 items; α = .72).: Evaluates the couple’s companionship as 
expressed in terms of the time they spend together in leisure activity.

Disagreement About Finances (FIN; 11 items; α = .72).: Assesses relationship discord 
regarding the management of finances.

Sexual Dissatisfaction (SEX; 13 items; α = .73).: Reflects the respondent’s level of 
discontent with the frequency and quality of intercourse and other sexual activity.

Family History of Distress (FAM; 8 items; α = .56).: Assesses the disruption of 
relationships within the respondent’s family of origin.

Role Orientation (ROR; 12 items; α = .75).: Evaluates the extent to which the respondent 
professes a traditional versus nontraditional orientation toward marital and parental gender 
roles. The ROR is not a measure of relationship distress per se; the potential of relationship 
conflict regarding marital and parental roles was thus inferred by partners’ differences on 
this scale.

The MSI-R has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties with Mexican American 
couples and shows structural equivalence across both Mexican American and White 
couples (Negy & Snyder, 1997) in both English and Spanish (Negy & Snyder, 2000). 
Furthermore, it has been translated into Spanish and shows utility with Mexican as well 
as Mexican American samples (Negy & Snyder, 2000; Negy, Snyder, & Diaz-Loving, 
2004). After reverse-scoring all reverse-worded items in each content scale, raw scores for 
each individual scale were summed, so that higher summed raw scores indicated higher 
dissatisfaction with the marital relationship. Then, summed scores were converted into 
normalized T-scores (Snyder, 1997). For the ROR scale, the difference between partners’ 
ROR T-scores was calculated with higher scores indicating higher differences between 
partner in regards to marital and parental gender roles. Participants’ T-scores on the nine 
MSI-R content scales were used in the LPA. The latent classes resulting from the LPA 
were used as predictors in an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) examining mental health 
symptom differences between the resulting groups.

Mental Health.—The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI-2; Butcher, 
Graham, Williams, & Ben-Porath, 1990) was used to assess mental health. The MMPI-2 
includes 15 content scales. In the current study, the anxiety (ANX) and depression (DEP) 
content scales were used. The ANX scale contained 23 items (α = .79) and the DEP scale 
contained 33 items (α = .82) in the present study. The ANX and DEP scales have been 
found to be highly correlated with other symptom-based measures of anxiety and depression 
(e.g., Ben-Porath, McCully, & Almagor, 1993; Strassberg, 1997; Whisman, Uebelacker, & 
Weinstock, 2004). After reverse-scoring all reverse-worded items in each of the two content 
scales, raw scores for each individual scale were summed, so that higher summed raw 
scores indicated higher mental health symptoms. Then, summed scores were converted into

as outcome variables in the ANCOVA.

Means, standard deviations, and ranges for all MSI-R content scales T-scores and the ANX 
and DEP T-scores for the overall sample, as well as for men and women and for Caucasian 
Americans and Mexican Americans separately can be found in Table 1.

Analyses

Latent profile analysis.—LPA was used to identify groups (i.e., latent classes) with 
different configurations of marital distress. The goal of this approach is to identify groups 
of individuals who are similar to each other, but different from people in other groups 
(Magidson & Vermunt, 2002; Muthén & Muthén, 2007). LPA is a model-based technique 
that classifies individuals based on likelihoods, whereby a probability that a certain 
individual belongs to a certain group is provided (Orpinas et al., 2014). LPA was conducted 
using Mplus, Version 7. We used ML, the Mplus default setting, as the maximum likelihood 
estimator.

In exploratory applications of LPA, the number of latent groups is not known a priori 
(Orpinas et al., 2014). Thus, we compared models with increasing numbers of latent groups 
to find an appropriate model resulting in the number of classes that fit the data the best. No 
single criterion exists to determine the best solution. Rather, models are compared based on 
interpretability, theory, and statistical criteria (Marsh, Ludtke, Trautwein, & Morin, 2009). 
Parsimony (i.e., adequately accounting for the complexity of the data using the fewest latent 
classes) is a major goal in selecting the model (Orpinas et al., 2014).

In the present study, the 9 content scales from the MSI-R were used as latent class 
indicators. A series of models with the number of classes ranging from two to five was 
fit. To select the model with the most appropriate number of classes, statistical fit indices, 
including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), 
sample-size adjusted BIC (sBIC) and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMRT), 
were compared. For the AIC, BIC, and sBIC, lower values indicate better fit. For the LMRT, 
significant values support the tested model over a model with one fewer classes. Another 
indicator of model fit is entropy. It is an estimate of how distinct the identified classes are 
from one another. Entropy values greater than .80 indicate a good separation of the identified 
groups (Ramaswamy, DeSarbo, Reibstein, & Robinson, 1993). To come up with the most 
appropriate solution, model interpretability based on theory was also evaluated.

Analysis of Covariance.—A series of ANCOVAs was run to examine the association 
between the marital distress classes as specified by the LPA and mental health. All 
ANCOVAs were run using SPSS Version 21. In ANCOVA 1, class was specified as the 
predictor and ANX was specified as the outcome. In ANCOVA 2, class was specified as 
the predictor and DEP was specified as the outcome. In ANCOVA 3, class, gender, and 
the class x gender interaction were specified as predictors and ANX was specified as the 
outcome. In ANCOVA 4, class, ethnicity, and the class x ethnicity interaction were specified 
as predictors and ANX was specified as the outcome. In ANCOVA 5, class, gender, and 
the class x gender interaction were specified as predictors and DEP was specified as the

outcome. In ANCOVA 6, class, ethnicity, and the class x ethnicity interaction were specified 
as predictors and DEP was specified as the outcome. Finally, when a significant interaction 
effect was detected, follow-up simple effect analyses were run to examine where differences 
might lie. Participants’ presence of children, cohabitation before marriage, and income were 
included as covariates in all analyses. In ANCOVAs 1 and 2, as well as in the simple 
effect follow-up analyses, pairwise group comparisons were analyzed whenever the omnibus 
analysis was found to be significant. For all pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni-adjusted 
alpha level of .008 (.05/6) was used.

Results

Model Selection

To select the best model, the fit statistics of the latent profiles from a 2-class solution up 
to a 5-class solution were examined. Table 2 presents the fit indices for each solution. 
Two fit indices (BIC and LMRT) supported the 4-class solution and two fit indices 
(AIC and sBIC) supported the 5-class solution. Thus, the 4-class solution was chosen for 
reasons of parsimony. The 4-class solution also was identified as the most informative for 
understanding marital distress profiles, as this model had classes with clearly distinguishable 
characteristics (please see Table 3 for means on all MSI-R subscales by class). Posterior 
probabilities of the four classes were .18, .47, .27, and .08 for Classes 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively. Entropy was equal to .86.

Class Descriptions

Class 1: The Low Distress/Low Role Orientation Difference Class (n = 47).—
This class had consistently low distress than the other three classes on the individual MSI-R 
content scales. Means on AFC, PSC, TTO, and SEX were low in relation to means on the 
other MSI-R content scales in this class, indicating good communication skills, a lot of 
common leisure activities, and sexual satisfaction. The mean of the FAM scale was high 
in relation to means on the other MSI-R content scales in this class, indicating a possible 
existence of family history of relationship distress among some individuals. Partners were 
found to have relatively similar views with regard to marital and parental roles. Twenty-four 
participants (51.1%) in this class were male and 26 participants (55.3%) were Caucasian 
American.

Class 2: The Medium Distress/Low Role Orientation Difference Class (n = 
130).—This class had consistently low to medium distress as compared to the other three 
classes on the individual MSI-R content scales. Means on AFC, TTO, and SEX were low 
in relation to means on the other MSI-R content scales in this class, indicating similarity to 
the Low Distress/Low Role Orientation Difference Class, with the exception that partners’ 
problem-solving skills may not be as efficient. Means on GDS, AGG, and FIN were high 
in relation to means on the other MSI-R content scales in this class, possibly indicating 
conflicts surrounding finances and aggression in the relationship, which may result in overall 
dissatisfaction with the relationship. Partners were found to have relatively similar views in 
regards to marital and parental roles. Sixty-six participants (50.8%) in this class were male

Class 3: The Medium Distress/High Role Orientation Difference Class (n = 
79).—This class had consistently medium to high distress as compared to the other three 
classes on the individual MSI-R content scales. As among the Medium Distress/Low Role 
Orientation Difference Class, means on AFC, TTO, and SEX were low in relation to means 
on the other MSI-R content scales in this class. Means on GDS, PSC, and FIN were high 
in relation to means on the other MSI-R content scales in this class, possibly indicating an 
inability to resolve problems about financial matters efficiently which may result in overall 
dissatisfaction with the relationship. Partners were found to have relatively different views 
with regard to marital and parental roles. Thirty-nine participants (49.4%) in this class were 
male and 26 participants (32.9%) were Caucasian American.

Class 4: The High Distress/High Role Orientation Difference Class (n = 22).—
This class had higher distress as compared to the other three classes on the individual 
MSI-R content scales. Means on TTO and FAM were low in relation to means on the 
other MSI-R content scales in this class, possibly indicating that partners spent little time 
with one another and did not have a strong family history of relationship distress. Means 
on GDS, PSC, AGG, and FIN were high in relation to means on the other MSI-R content 
scales in this class, possibly indicating conflicts surrounding finances and aggression in the 
relationship, which may result in aggressive tendencies and overall dissatisfaction with the 
relationship. Partners were found to have relatively different views in regards to marital and 
parental roles. Ten participants (45.5%) in this class were male and 6 participants (27.3%) 
were Caucasian American.

Analyses of Covariance

ANCOVA 1: Anxiety on Class.—Controlling for presence of children, cohabitation 
before marriage, and income, overall, the ANX means of the four classes were found to be 
significantly different, F(6, 278) = 13.37, p < .001. Unadjusted (i.e., without considering 
the covariates) and adjusted (i.e., considering the covariates) ANX means and standard 
deviations of the four classes for the overall sample can be found in Table 4. Overall, a 
pattern of increasing ANX mean scores was found when moving from the least to the most 
maritally distressed class (i.e., from Class 1 to Class 2 to Class 3 to Class 4). This pattern 
was preserved when including the three covariates. Pairwise comparisons indicated that all 
pairs of classes’ ANX means were significantly different from one another (F(1, 271) = 
10.08 , p = .002 for Class 1 vs. 2; F(1, 271) = 31.33, p < .001 for Class 1 vs. 3; F(1, 271) = 
50.56, p < .001 for Class 1 vs. 4; F(1, 271) = 12.55, p < .001 for Class 2 vs. 3; F(1, 271) = 
32.71, p < .001 for Class 2 vs. 4; F(1, 271) = 11.54, p = .001 for Class 3 vs. 4).

ANCOVA 2: Depression on Class.—Controlling for presence of children, cohabitation 
before marriage, and income, overall, the DEP means of the four classes were found to be 
significantly different, F(6, 278) = 15.24, p < .001. Unadjusted (i.e., without considering 
the covariates) and adjusted (i.e., considering the covariates) DEP means and standard 
deviations of the four classes for the overall sample can be found in Table 4. Overall, a 
pattern of increasing DEP mean scores was found when moving from the least to the most 
maritally distressed class (i.e., from Class 1 to Class 2 to Class 3 to Class 4). This pattern 
was preserved when including the three covariates. Pairwise comparisons indicated that all

pairs of classes’ DEP means were significantly different from one another (F(1, 271) = 
12.46, p < .001 for Class 1 vs. 2; F(1, 271) = 38.41, p < .001 for Class 1 vs. 3; F(1, 271) = 
62.67 , p < .001 for Class 1 vs. 4; F(1, 271) = 15.27, p < .001 for Class 2 vs. 3; F(1, 271) = 
40.60, p < .001 for Class 2 vs. 4; and F(1, 271) = 14.51, p < .001 for Class 3 vs. 4).

ANCOVA 3: Anxiety on Class x Gender.—Controlling for presence of children, 
cohabitation before marriage, and income, overall, the ANX means of the four classes were 
found to be significantly different when including gender and the class x gender interaction 
as additional predictors, F(10, 278) = 8.13, p < .001. However, the class x gender interaction 
term was not found to be significant, F(3, 278) = 0.57, p = .64, indicating that the effect of 
class on anxiety did not differ by gender.

ANCOVA 4: Anxiety on Class x Ethnicity.—Controlling for presence of children, 
cohabitation before marriage, and income, overall, the ANX means of the four classes 
were found to be significantly different when including ethnicity and the class x ethnicity 
interaction as additional predictors, F(10, 278) = 8.93, p < .001. The class x ethnicity 
interaction term was also found to be significant, F(3, 278) = 2.63, p = .05, indicating that 
the effect of class on anxiety differed by ethnicity.

Since the class x ethnicity interaction was significant, simple effect analyses were conducted 
to examine the effect of class on anxiety and pairwise comparisons between the four classes 
separately for Caucasian Americans and for Mexican Americans. Unadjusted (i.e., without 
considering the covariates) and adjusted (i.e., considering the covariates) ANX means and 
standard deviations of the four classes for Caucasian Americans and Mexican Americans 
can be found in Table 4. Overall, a pattern of increasing ANX mean scores was found when 
moving from the least to the most maritally distressed class (i.e., from Class 1 to Class 2 
to Class 3 to Class 4) for both Caucasian Americans as well as Mexican Americans. This 
pattern was preserved when including the three covariates.

For Caucasian Americans, controlling for presence of children, cohabitation before 
marriage, and income, overall, the ANX means of the four classes were found to be 
significantly different, F(6, 112) = 5.99, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons indicated that pairs 
of classes’ DEP means were significantly different from one another for Classes 1 vs. 4, F(1, 
105) = 24.57, p < .001; Classes 2 vs. 4, F(1, 105) = 18.28, p < .001; and Classes 3 vs. 4, F(1, 
105) = 13.68, p < .001.

For Mexican Americans, controlling for presence of children, cohabitation before marriage, 
and income, overall, the ANX means of the four classes were found to be significantly 
different, F(6, 166) = 8.24, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons indicated that pairs of classes’ 
DEP means were significantly different from one another for Classes 1 vs. 3, F(1, 159) = 
25.93, p < .001; Classes 1 vs. 4, F(1, 159) = 27.71, p < .001; Classes 2 vs. 3, F(1, 159) = 
14.82, p < .001; and Classes 2 vs. 4 F(1, 159) = 16.55, p < .001.

term was not found to be significant, F(3, 278) = 1.84, p = .14, indicating that the effect of 
class on depression did not differ by gender.

Discussion

The present research provides a novel approach to the study of marital distress by 
identifying groups of newlywed individuals who show similar degrees of dissatisfaction 
in a variety of relationship domains. We used LPA to identify four distinct classes that could 
mainly be distinguished by a continuum of dissatisfaction across all relationship domains. In 
addition to identifying this continuum of dissatisfaction, interesting differences were found 
in the extent to which partners differed in their view of traditional versus non-traditional 
gender roles. On one end, the least distressed individuals were relatively similar in their 
gender role views. On the other end, the most distressed individuals were relatively different 
in their gender role views. However, in the middle, we identified two groups of moderate 
distress, one with quite similar gender role views (the most similar views of all four classes), 
and one with quite different gender role views (the most different views of all four classes). 
Furthermore, some domains of distress consistently emerged as playing an important role 
in characterizing the groups. The experience of relationship aggression appeared to result 
in particularly alarming patterns associated with overall relationship distress. Likewise, a 
lack of communication skills stood out among the most distressed groups. These findings 
are consistent with previous research highlighting associations between intimate partner 
violence (IPV), communication, and relationship problems (e.g., Hellmuth & McNulty, 
2008; Panuzio & DiLillo, 2010) and may have the potential to identify partners’ different 
needs that may require distinct prevention approaches.

To further characterize the latent classes, we examined differences between the four groups 
on symptoms of anxiety and depression. As expected, those groups of individuals with 
higher distress evidenced higher levels of both anxiety and depression. In addition, partners’ 
differences in their views on traditional versus non-traditional gender roles also impacted 
their mental health in that the medium distress/low role orientation difference class had 
fewer symptoms than the medium distress/high role orientation difference class. These 
overall patterns generalized across gender and ethnicity. However, only the association 
between class and anxiety was found to significantly differ by ethnicity. Follow-up analyses 
indicated that some differences between Caucasian-American and Mexican-American 
partners existed when comparing pairs of groups. However, these different patterns mainly 
emerged when comparing groups that were on opposing endings of the dissatisfaction and 
gender role orientation continuums.

Although little research is available that investigates the relationship between anxiety 
and marital distress among Mexican Americans specifically, other research demonstrates 
conflictual family relationships may be associated with anxiety in this group. For example, 
Priest and Denton (2012) found that, among Mexican American adult family members, 
family discord was positively related to agoraphobia/with panic, generalized anxiety 
disorder, panic attack, and social phobia. Family cohesion was negatively related to to 
generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, but, as Priest and Denton (2012) suggest, 
family discord may play a larger role in development of anxiety disorders than family 
cohesion. Thus, while the concept of familism is important among Mexican Americans, 
negative family functioning may affect marriage partners’ mental health to a greater extent.

Limitations and Future Directions

Although the present study provides a novel approach to the study of relationship distress 
and offers a variety of strengths in its design and methodology (e.g., sample comprised 
of Caucasian as well as Mexican American couples; validation of latent classes through 
examination of the distress-mental health association), the present findings need to be 
interpreted in light of some limitations. First, the current sample was a community sample 
experiencing relatively low levels of marital distress and mental health symptomatology. 
Thus, it remains unclear whether the current findings will generalize to clinical populations. 
Second, the correlational design of the current study prevents us from inferring cause and 
effect relationships in the association between marital distress and mental health. Third, the 
overall sample size of the present study was relatively small, and the sample sizes of the 
solely Caucasian American and the solely Mexican American samples were even smaller. 
Finally, the present study relied solely on self-report measures, which may bias the present 
findings. Future studies may consider collecting data from more participants and utilizing 
measures other than self-report, such as observational measures or clinical interviews.

In addition to addressing these limitations, future research may be conducted relating the 
profiles of marital distress to other outcomes. The current results underscore that there 
may be different types of distressed couples, including couples that score high on all or 
almost all dimensions of distress, couples that score low on all or almost all dimensions 
of distress, as well as groups of couples who find themselves somewhat in the middle, but 
who may be distinguished from one another based on the ways they feel about traditional 
versus non-traditional gender roles. It would be interesting to examine whether these groups 
of couples differ on other behaviors, such as telling each other the truth, being faithful 
to one another, having children, and ending up in separation or divorce. Furthermore, 
although aggression was one of the domains included in the LPA, the MSI-R’s AGG content 
scale only assessed levels of victimization. Since previous research has identified IPV as 
a consistent correlate of relationship distress (Stith, Green, Smith, & Ward, 2008), it may 
be informative to investigate the usefulness of the present latent classes in determining 
both IPV perpetration and IPV victimization behaviors. In addition to being theoretically 
interesting, such an examination of the four latent classes resulting from the present research 
in relation to additional correlates of marital distress may also provide support to their 
validity. Finally, future studies may also consider examining the use of latent profiles among 
additional ethnic or cultural groups, as well as among varying age groups.

Implication on Marriage and Family Therapy

The present results could help guide the development and implementation of prevention and 
intervention programs for individuals and couples suffering from marital distress or mental 
health problems. Our results indicate that there are certain domains of marital distress that 
are commonly experienced together, such as relationship aggression and communication 
problems. Furthermore, evidencing a pattern of distress in which these dimensions are 
particularly pronounced may set individuals and couples up for especially detrimental 
outcomes, such as more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Thus, clinicians should 
consider placing emphasis on targeting couples’ partner aggression and communication 
deficits in order to alleviate their overall levels of relationship distress as well as their risk 
for break-up or divorce and mental health symptomatology. Several couple interventions that 
place a particular emphasis on teaching relationships skills, such as non-aggressive, effective 
communication strategies, already exist. For example, Integrative Behavioral Couples 
Therapy (ICBT; Jacobson, Christensen, Prince, Cordova, & Eldridge, 2000), an evidence-
based relatively new approach to couples therapy, which integrates acceptance and change 
as positive outcomes for couples in therapy, includes a communication and problem-solving 
training (CPT) component. The main goal of CPT is to teach couples communication skills 
while simultaneously solving some of their specific problems (Christensen, Jacobson, & 
Babcock, 2013). This type of intervention is in line with other approaches to marital therapy, 
which have also emphasized communication training (e.g., Ables & Brandsma, 1977).

Furthermore, the present results provide a first exploration of gender and ethnic differences 
that may be important to the treatment of couples and mental health disorders. The 
association between the different classes resulting from our LPA and mental health 
symptomatology (both anxiety and depression) was not found to differ based on individuals’ 
gender. However, although we also did not detect any differences based on ethnicity 
when looking at symptoms of depression, different patterns in this association were 
found when examining symptoms of anxiety among Caucasian Americans versus Mexican 
Americans. These findings may indicate that marital distress impacts Caucasian Americans’ 
and Mexican Americans’ levels of anxiety differently. Previous research has shown that 
Mexican Americans, coming from a more collectivist culture, may value harmony and 
respect towards others more than individuals from rather individualist cultures (such as 
Caucasian Americans; Flores, Tschann, Vanoss Marin, & Pantoja, 2004). Thus, it may 
be that marital distress, often marked by a lack of harmony and respect, may lead them 
to become more anxious. Such differences could be taken into account when conducting 
therapy with individuals and couples from different cultural backgrounds (Soto-Culp & Del 
Campo, 1994; Welland & Ribner, 2010). Previous research has highlighted the importance 
of cultural adaptations for evidence-based interventions. As outlined in the DSM-5 section 
on Cultural Formulation (APA, 2013), understanding the cultural context an individual is 
in is essential for effective diagnostic assessment and clinical management. Furthermore, 
culture and ethnicity may influence individuals’ relationships with others, including their 
romantic partner (APA, 2013). For Mexican-Americans in particular, it has been found that 
degree of acculturation and acculturative stress might influence the ways individuals interact 
with their partner and might thus impact how satisfied they are with their marriages (Negy 
& Snyder, 1997), which in turn could influence mental health outcomes. Thus, practitioners

in the field of marriage and family therapy should consider adapting interventions based on 
couples’ specific cultural group and, if possible, conduct interventions in couples’ native 
language as these factors have been found to influence therapy outcomes (Griner & Smith, 
2006).

Conclusions

The present study identified four groups of individuals that showed a continuum of 
distress, as well as varying degrees of differences in partners’ views of traditional versus 
non-traditional gender roles. The classes resulting from our analyses were related to 
individuals’ mental health in that those individuals who found themselves in groups with 
higher dissatisfaction also experienced higher levels of anxiety and depression than those 
individuals who found themselves in groups with lower dissatisfaction. Although more 
research is clearly needed among larger and more diverse samples, the present findings may 
be useful to researchers and practitioners in that they may guide prevention and intervention 
efforts in the field of marital distress and mental health. This research has important 
implications for marriage and family therapy in that it highlights the usefulness of taking 
different patterns of marital distress, as well as couples’ cultural and ethnic background, into 
account when providing prevention and intervention efforts.
