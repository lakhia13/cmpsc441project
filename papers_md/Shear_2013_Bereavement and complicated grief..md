Abstract

Bereavement is a common experience in adults age 60 and older. Loss of a loved one usually leads
to acute grief characterized by yearning and longing, decreased interest in ongoing activities, and
frequent thoughts of the deceased. For most, acute grief naturally evolves into a state of integrated
grief, where the bereaved is able to reengage with everyday activities and find interest or pleasure.
About 7% of bereaved older adults, however, will develop the mental health condition of
Complicated Grief (CG). In CG, the movement from acute to integrated grief is derailed, and grief
symptoms remain severe and impairing. This article reviews recent publications on the diagnosis
of CG, risk factors for the condition, and evidenced-based treatments for CG. Greater attention to
complicated grief detection and treatment in older adults is needed.

INTRODUCTION

“Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it… Nor can we know
ahead of the fact … the unending absence that follows, the void, the very opposite
of meaning, the relentless succession of moments during which we will confront
the experience of meaninglessness itself.”

(p. 188–9) Joan Didion The Year of Magical Thinking
(1)

Didion’s book is a vivid and powerful description of her grief following the sudden death of
her 71-year-old husband, her close companion for more than 40 years. She finds the
experience to be (perhaps thankfully) unlike anything she could have imagined. In this,
Didion’s response is not unique. Though bereavement is an event experienced by all
humanity, there are few events as unfamiliar or as unsettling. Clinicians can assist the
bereaved to cope with bereavement and its disruptive consequences. However, treatment of
the bereaved can be controversial because the pain and disruption are universal and intrinsic
to the situation. It can be challenging to distinguish between typical bereavement responses
and more intense reactions that could constitute a mental health disorder.

Bereavement and its care are particularly relevant to older adults because they experience
bereavement at a much higher rate than younger adults; one study found that over 70% of
older adults experienced bereavement in a 2.5 year period (2). Spousal loss is very common
(3), but deaths of friends or non-spousal relatives (especially siblings) may account for the
greatest proportion of losses among older adults (2) (4). In order to be optimally supportive
to bereaved older adults, it is important for clinicians to be knowledgeable. The purpose of
this paper is to provide detail on recent research on bereavement and bereavement care in
older adults that may be useful to clinicians.

We begin by clarifying terminology. We use the term bereavement to refer to the experience
of having lost a loved one, not the response to such a loss. Grief refers to the
psychobiological response to bereavement. Acute grief is the initial response, often intense
and disruptive. Integrated grief is the permanent response after adaptation to the loss, in
which satisfaction in ongoing life is renewed. Complicated grief is a form of prolonged
acute grief, where the term complicated is used in the medical sense of a superimposed
process that impedes healing. Complicated grief is a distinct mental health disorder.
Mourning denotes the array of psychological processes set in motion by the loss to facilitate
adaptation (5).

IS GRIEF AN ILLNESS?

Some say grief should not be pathologized, as though a clinician would choose to create
pathology when our whole purpose is to relieve it. Inflammation is the painful, universal
response to exposure to certain bacteria, yet we do not debate whether a clinician is
pathologizing a natural human experience by diagnosing and treating it. However, mental
disorders carry the added burden of stigma and there is the diagnostic challenge that most
mental disorders exist on a continuum with normal functioning. Perhaps for these reasons, a
diagnosis can sometimes seem like a gratuitous negative judgment rather than a first step in
accessing appropriate treatment.

Again, Didion’s clearly articulated discourse is helpful. She writes: “The power of grief to
derange the mind has…been exhaustively noted…. The mourner is in fact ill, but because
this state of mind is common and seems so natural… we do not call [it] an illness” (p.34,
quoting Melanie Klein). Freud also felt that grief should not be considered a mental disorder
(6), and many clinicians follow Freud and Klein and do not regard any grief response as an
illness. Yet, many bereaved people are suffering. What then is the role of clinicians in the
management of grief? When and how should clinicians provide help?

The answers to these questions are not clear-cut. Dyregrov and Dyregrov (7) stress the
importance of relying on existing social supports for bereaved people, and we concur with
this perspective. Providing comfort and support in the early bereavement period is usually

very natural for family, friends, neighbors and others in the community. There are
prescribed periods of contact such as visitation, funeral, sitting shiva and other ritualistic
gatherings. Others can be helpful as caring listeners who share in reminiscence and join in
seeking answers to unanswerable questions; they must resist the urge to provide answers or
gratuitous advice. As time goes on, though, others can provide gentle encouragement to re-
engage in ongoing life, even when the bereaved person is not well motivated to do so. For
most bereaved individuals, natural social supports will be sufficient.

Dyregrov and Dyregrov (7) point out, however, that certain difficult circumstances of a
death can leave virtually everyone desirous of professional support. For example, after a
suicide, up to 80% of bereaved people say that they want professional help (8). When the
bereaved do seek support, clinicians can add their voices to the chorus of support, bringing
both their professional expertise and their humanity to the encounter. They can educate
people about the rocky uncharted pathway ahead. However, they must be humble in their
expertise. Informed clinicians can provide Sherpa-like guidance to bereaved people, walking
by their side as they navigate the arduous path to rediscovery of meaning and purpose, and
new possibilities for joy and satisfaction.

THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEREAVEMENT IN OLDER ADULTS

It is important that any clinicians working with bereaved older adults be aware that
bereavement in older adults can be associated with a number of negative outcomes. Loss of
a loved one is associated with worsening health, including weight loss, increased rates of
illness and functional impairment (9, 10). Mostofsky et al. (11) analyzed data from the
Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study (mean age 61; MIOS) and documented
a 21.1-fold (95% CI 13.1–34.1) increase in incidence of MI within 24 hours of learning of
the death of a loved one. Incidence declined each subsequent day but remained significantly
elevated for a month. Khanfer et al (12) studied older adults (average age 73) bereaved for 2
months, compared to age and sex-matched non-bereaved. Bereavement was associated with
lower neutrophil superoxide production when challenged with bacteria or a protein kinase
activator, and higher cortisol/DHEAS ratios that correlated with elevated depressive and
anxiety symptoms. Another study assessed cardiovascular and immune functioning at 2
weeks and 6 months post-loss in bereaved relatives (average age 65) of patients who died in
an ICU. The authors found changes in blood pressure, heart rate, sleep, neuroendocrine and
immune functioning (13). Most of these changes normalized by 6 months post-loss,
however.

Bereavement also appears to increase risk for mortality in the early period after the event. In
a large primary care database in the United Kingdom, bereavement was associated with
increased hazard of mortality, 1.25 (CI 1.21, 1.37), highest in the first 90 days. This finding
was stronger for those with no recorded chronic medical conditions prior to the loss, and
among those from high income communities (14). Spouses bereaved by unexpected death
also have a higher rate of mortality (15). These increased mortality rates appear to primarily
be attributed to suicide, accidents, heart disease and cancer (9).

In addition, bereavement is associated with changes in social and emotional factors in older
adults, including a decrease in satisfaction and well-being and an increase in loneliness and
social isolation (9, 16). However, there appear to be substantial variations in these outcomes
based on socioeconomic factors. Arbuckle and De Vries (17) examined functioning, life
satisfaction and hopefulness for the future 2–15 years after older adults lost a child or a
partner. They found bereaved elders experienced less satisfaction and less hopefulness but
greater self-efficacy than controls who were not bereaved. Negative social and health effects
were significantly greater among women, and less education and income were also

associated with worse bereavement outcomes. Another study found that, in households
where married couples had high-loss intra-household financial dependency, after
widowhood, in households with high financial dependency, bereaved men (the
breadwinners) compared to married controls, experienced a significant loss in global well-
being, whereas both widows and widowers experienced greater bereavement-related
psychosocial distress. Bereaved women experienced greater financial distress, regardless of
pre-loss dependency status (18).

COMPLICATED GRIEF IN OLDER ADULTS

For most bereaved older adults, the health and emotional consequences of bereavement
resolve in a few months, and pre-loss functioning is restored (19). However, for a clinically
significant minority, complications derail the natural mourning process and prolong acute
grief, resulting in a mental health condition. There is ongoing debate over what this
condition should be called. Our group has used the term “complicated grief” (CG) because
1) much of the literature has been published using that designation and 2) it is a non-
pejorative yet descriptive term.

George Engel (20) conceived of grief as analogous to infection or injury, and we agree with
this conceptualization (21). Thus, we also use the term “complicated” in the medical sense
of a superimposed condition that impedes the course of another health problem (in this case,
typical acute grief). For some bereaved individuals, the natural healing process is interfered
with by various complications, just as a wound does not heal properly when it becomes
infected. The injury analogy is apt for bereavement because healing requires painful
emotional activation similar to the physical pain of a wound. Grief becomes complicated
when there are problems related to the circumstances, consequences or context of the loss or
by an internal problem with the adaptation process. Didion does not like the term “healing,”
and the analogy is not perfect, but considering a loss to be similar to a serious injury
recognizes the severity of the pain and disruption, the possibility for complications, and the
potential usefulness of clinical attention, without implying an underlying problem.

CG was first proposed as a diagnostic entity for DSM IV by Hartz (22). Horowitz et al. (23)
published a seminal paper testing diagnostic criteria, and Prigerson et al published an
influential series of papers with an evolving set of proposed criteria (e.g. (24, 25)). However,
the Prigerson criteria were based upon results of community studies with a small number of
individuals with CG. Our group (26, 27) proposed a slightly different set of diagnostic
criteria based upon clinical experience and a much larger data set of individuals with CG
who sought help. The recently released 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) includes criteria for CG in the section on
“Disorders Requiring Further Study.” Here, the condition is called “Persistent Complex
Bereavement Disorder” (28). Table 1 outlines the DSM-5 criteria for diagnosis in adults.

While these various criteria sets differ in some respects and consensus still needs to be
reached, all proposals include symptoms of prolonged acute grief, such as frequent intense
yearning, intense sorrow and emotional pain, preoccupation with the deceased and/or
circumstances of the death, excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss, difficulty
accepting the death, feeling alone and empty, and feeling that life has no purpose or meaning
without the deceased person. Identified CG symptoms also meet many of the criteria
outlined by Stein and colleagues (29) needed to confirm validity of a new diagnostic entity.
We and others are currently conducting a field trial of the proposed DSM-5 CG criteria, as
well as alternative proposed criteria. We believe that consensus will be reached in the near
future.

As with all mood and anxiety disorders, the co-occurrence of complicated grief and major
depressive disorder (MDD), (30, 31) is common, with studies finding that 25% of those with
bereavement-related depression have CG, and 36–55% of those with CG have comorbid
depression (32–34). However, CG has been found to constitute a distinct cluster of
symptoms which can be distinguished from depression (23, 35). Table 2 outlines clinical
differences between CG and MDD. It is important to identify CG even when it is comorbid
with depression because CG has unique clinical features and appears to require unique
treatment. Treatment of CG in patients with depression is associated with reductions in
depressive symptoms (36) but the reverse is not true (37). More detail on CG treatment is
provided below.

A recent population-based survey found 6.7% of bereaved individuals develop CG, and
individuals 61 and older had more than double the rate (9%) of younger adults. Older
women, in particular, had a rate of CG (9.6%), much higher than that of younger adults
(2.7%) (38). CG can be chronic and persistent, markedly interfering with functioning. For
example, Stammel et al. (39) surveyed 775 Cambodians who had lost at least one family
member during the Khmer Rouge regime and found 14% endorsed CG 30 years later.

CG can be reliably detected with standardized measures, such as the Inventory of
Complicated Grief (ICG) (40). Reliable measures of CG have also recently been developed
and tested for people with intellectual disabilities (41) and validated in other languages, such
as Japanese (42). Most people with complicated grief (CG) are aware that something is
wrong but don’t know what it is, and are relieved to receive a diagnosis (43).

People with CG show a range of cognitive and affective differences from bereaved people
without CG. Gupta and Bonanno (44) found the ability to flexibly enhance or suppress
emotional expression at will was reduced in CG. Burton et al (45) found CG associated with
less “forward coping”, defined as the ability to think optimistically, attend to the needs of
others, maintain plans and goals, remain calm, reduce painful emotions and be able to laugh.
Golden and Dalgleish (46) studied 3 groups of midlife adults and found significant
relationships between CG symptoms and both self-devaluation and negative self-related
cognitions about the future. Those with CG also had greater negative cognitions about the
future for close others. Bereaved individuals had high rates of self-related counterfactual
thoughts about the death. Consistent with clinical observations, those with CG had these
thoughts significantly more frequently and the thoughts were associated with greater
distress. Also consistent with clinical observations, Boelen (47) asked bereaved individuals
to write a list of 7 goals and found those with CG produced less specific goals, and reported
lower sense of control and lower likelihood of achieving goals.

CG is associated with negative health and mental health consequences in older adults,
beyond that of bereavement itself. Prigerson et al. (48) found that the risk of hypertension is
10 times greater among older adult widowed subjects who met criteria for CG compared to
those who do not, and sleep impairment is associated with CG in older adults (49).
Suicidality is twice as high among widowed older adults with CG than those without CG
(50).

Recent reviews (51–57) summarize possible risk factors, for CG and suggest these are seen
across samples, nationalities and age groups. CG is associated with female gender, low
education, older age, low socioeconomic status, and low social support both before and after
the death. A history of anxiety disorders or depression before the death and past history of
multiple trauma or loss, also appear to be risk fators. Several investigators found that
spiritual belief systems may decrease risk for developing CG (58–60). Denckla et al. (61)
compared ratings on healthy dependency, destructive overdependence and dysfunctional

detachment among a small group of bereaved middle aged people with and without CG and
found that those with CG were more likely to have dysfunctional detachment.

CG also tends to occur after loss of a very close relationship with the deceased, such as loss
of a spouse. Loss of a child poses an espcially high risk (62). Traumatic circumstances of the
death, a lack of preparation, or difficult interactions with medical or other staff at the time of
the death can increase the risk of CG. Chiu et al (60) found CG was associated with
perceived general disapproval from others, longer duration of caregiving, and medical
disease history in the caregiver. Use of hospice care decreased risk. Kramer et al (54) found
higher CG symptoms in caregivers from families with low conflict before the end of life but
higher conflict at the end of life, in those who had family members with difficulty accepting
the illness, and among caregivers with greater fear of death.

COMPLICATED GRIEF TREATMENT

Given that CG can be reliably identified and differentiated from other mental disorders, and
given its prevalence, we believe there is a need for an effective treatment. To meet this need,
we developed complicated grief treatment (CGT), a 16-week individual treatment that is
guided by an attachment theory model of grief. According to this model, the death of a loved
one provokes an acute crisis of attachment with activation of the attachment working model
and associated proximity seeking. This activation results in symptoms of yearning, longing
and preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased that alternate with a desire
to escape from the painful reality. The loss also triggers a natural mourning process that
leads the bereaved person to find a way to make peace with the finality and consequences of
the loss, revise the internal working model and redefine life goals and plans. Sometimes this
process is derailed by complications that impede the natural healing process. CGT seeks to
address these complications and to reinvigorate the natural healing process. A set of loss-
related and restoration-related strategies and procedures are used to do this.

We published the first randomized controlled treatment trial for complicated grief (36).
Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, this study showed CGT was superior to
Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). A replication of this study in older adults is nearly
complete, and a third multi-site study is underway. In a smaller study conducted at multiple
sites, Boelen et al. (63) reported similar findings, comparing Cognitive Behavioral
Treatment (CBT) with supportive counseling for CG and found a significant reduction in
CG symptoms and general psychopathology in the CBT group compared to supportive
counseling. A number of small studies using a similar intervention have now been
published, including Acierno et al (64), Asukai et al (65), Rosner et al (66), Papa et al (67)
and Supiano and Luptak (68). Wagner et al. (69) tested the effectiveness of an internet-based
cognitive behavioral therapy for CG. Taken together, results of these studies are
encouraging and suggest that complicated grief can be effectively treated by identifying CG,
addressing grief complications and facilitating the natural healing process.

Pharmacotherapy might also be helpful to people with CG. Simon et al. (2008) found that
patients taking antidepressants were more likely to complete CGT, with no such effect on
completion rates for IPT. Zygmont et al. (70) also found combination treatment with
Paroxetine or Nortriptyline administered with CGT were effective in reducing grief
symptoms. Results with medication alone are more mixed. Pasternak et al (71) and Reynolds
et al. (37) found treatment with antidepressant medication reduced depression but not CG,
whereas in an open pharmacotherapy trial Hensley et al. (72) found that Citalopram
improved depressive, anxiety and grief symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS

Page 7

Bereavement is a common life experience among older adults. For most, an initial period of
acute grief evolves naturally into integrated grief. The bereaved older adult still has feelings
of yearning and sorrow, but these are not frequent or intense enough to be disruptive. Daily
activities are interesting and life holds the possibility for finding joy and meaning. This
population of bereaved older adults can benefit from psychoeducation and general support
from clinicians. Approximately 7% of older adults will develop complications that derail the
normal mourning process, however, resulting in the syndrome of complicated grief (CG),
also called prolonged grief and persistent complex bereavement disorder. Treatments for CG
have also been tested, with the 16-session Complicated Grief Treatment (CGT) showing the
best evidence of efficacy, including a study in older adults.

There has been important progress in understanding and treating CG in older adults, but
there is still much that needs to be done. Consensus regarding the best name for the disorder
and agreement on a criteria set are important next steps to support both clinical and research
efforts. More must be done to increase the public and professional awareness of CG, in order
to help ensure that those suffering from the condition receive needed help. To this end, we
have established a Center for Complicated Grief at the Columbia University School of
Social Work, with resources accessible at www.complicatedgrief.org. Other areas which
require exploration include better understanding of similarities and differences in treatment
modalities for CG in older adults. Better understanding of how CGT works and for whom
(mediators and moderators of treatment) is also needed. Elucidating what services those with
CG are currently using in the community and whether these are effective is essential as well.
In addition, research on the dissemination of CGT and its acceptability to both clinicians and
older adults with CG is necessary. Prevention and early intervention efforts for CG may also
be helpful and should be tested. In short, research efforts are needed to help reduce the
sizable negative health and mental health burden of CG for older adults.
