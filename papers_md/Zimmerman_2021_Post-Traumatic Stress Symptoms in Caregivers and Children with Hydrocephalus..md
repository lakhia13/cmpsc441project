Abstract

Introduction:  Hydrocephalus is a disorder of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics that has traditionally 
been treated by placement of a ventricular shunt. Shunts are effective but imperfect as they fail in 
an unpredictable pattern, and the patient’s well being is dependent upon adequate shunt function. 
The omnipresent threat of shunt failure along with the potential need for invasive investigations 
can be stressful for patients and caregivers. This study objective is to measure post-traumatic stress 
symptoms (PTSS) in children with hydrocephalus and their caregivers.

Methods:  A cross-sectional analysis of children with hydrocephalus and their caregivers was 
conducted. Caregivers completed a measure of their own PTSS (the Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorders Checklist for the DSM-V (PCL-V)) and resilience (the Connor Davidson Resilience 
Scale (CD-RISC)). Pediatric patients rated their own PTSS and resilience using the Acute Stress 
Checklist for Kids (ASC-Kids) and CD-RISC.

Results:  Ninety-one caregivers completed the PCL-V. Mean score was 17.0 (SD 15.7; median 
13.0). 14% scored 33 and above, suggestive of a preliminary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress 
disorder. There was a statistically significant association between caregiver post-traumatic stress 
and marital status, child’s race, and caregiver education. 52% of caregivers reported their child’s 
hydrocephalus as the most significant source of their PTSS. Children did not have markedly 
elevated levels of PTSS. 41% of caregivers and 60% of children scored in the lowest resilience 
quartile compared to the general population.

Conclusion:  Results from this study suggest that post-traumatic stress affects caregivers with 
hydrocephalus, yet levels of resilience for caregivers and pediatric patients are low.

Introduction

Page 2

Hydrocephalus is a life-altering chronic condition and is the most common reason 
for neurological surgery in children.1 Standard treatment of hydrocephalus is surgical 
placement of a ventricular shunt. However, shunts are not a cure, and frequently become 
obstructed and fail. Shunt failure is an unpredictable event that typically results in painful 
symptoms, requires surgical intervention, and offers a real threat to the patient’s life 
and well-being. Throughout their lifetime, children with hydrocephalus may undergo 
multiple hospitalizations, invasive investigations, and repeated surgeries. Consequently, 
hydrocephalus has an adverse impact on the quality of life for pediatric patients2.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a constellation of symptoms that occurs after exposure 
to a severe or repeated traumatic event. These symptoms are defined in the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and classified into categories of 
intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and marked alterations 
in arousal and reactivity. Symptoms include recurrent, intrusive memories, dissociative 
reactions, avoidance of distressing memories or external reminders, irritable behavior, 
sleep disturbance, and problems with cognition11. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) 
are associated with functional impairment, negative impact on quality of life, increased 
rehospitalization rates, and disease relapses8,12. Previous studies have shown that medical 
complexity places pediatric patients and their caregivers at increased risk for post-traumatic 
stress symptoms.3-10 The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence and severity of 
post-traumatic stress symptoms in children with hydrocephalus and their caregivers.

Methods

Setting

A cross-sectional analysis of children with hydrocephalus and their caregivers was 
conducted between July 2017 to February 2018. This is a convenience sample, with the 
enrollment period determined by the availability of the research assistant. Study participants 
were recruited during the child’s routine neurosurgical clinic visit at a large hospital in the 
southeastern United States.

Study Population

The study population consisted of two groups: caregivers of children with hydrocephalus, 
and children with hydrocephalus. Children were eligible for enrollment if they were ages 
7 to 21 years, had surgically treated hydrocephalus, and were able to complete the study 
instruments independently. Assessment of ability to participate was done by both research 
staff and parent, including consciousness, ability to read or understand survey questions, and 
overall maturity. Caregivers of children (child age 0-21) with hydrocephalus were eligible 
for enrollment. Caregivers were eligible for participation even if their children were not 
eligible or refused and vice versa. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap 
electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham13.

Data Collection

Page 3

Institutional Review Board ethical approval was obtained prior to participant enrollment. 
Consent was obtained by a research assistant trained in research ethics, survey 
administration, and informed consent. Caregivers completed five questionnaires: The Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorders Checklist for the DSM-V (PCL-V) with Criterion A, The 
Child Stress Disorders Checklist (CSDC), the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT 2.0), the 
Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The 
PCL-V is a 20-item self-report of traumatic stress symptoms in response to a person’s most 
traumatic event14. The Criterion A question in the PCL-V is a free-response field that asks 
the responder to identify their most traumatic event. The Child Stress Disorders Checklist 
(CSDC) is a 36-item observer report screening assessment for traumatic stress symptoms in 
children ages 2-21 years15. The CSDC yields a total score on a scale of 0-72, with higher 
scores indicative of more severe traumatic stress symptoms. The PAT 2.0 is a validated 
parent report screen of psychosocial risk in pediatric health16. The Zarit Burden Interview 
(ZBI) is a self-report of burden in caring for a loved one with a medical condition17. ZBI 
was initially designed to study caregivers of dependent adults, but it has been used in 
populations of children with medical needs as well.18 The CD-RISC is a 10-item measure of 
one’s own resilience, defined as the ability to cope in the face of adversity19.

Children enrolled in the study completed two questionnaires: Acute Stress Checklist for 
Kids (ASC-Kids) and the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). The ASC-Kids 
is a 29-item self-report measure of traumatic stress for children20. The ASC-Kids yields 
a severity score on a scale of 0-58, with higher scores indicative of more severe stress 
reactions. The ASC-Kids was completed by all children ages 7-21 years.

Demographic and social variables were collected from the PAT 2.0. These variables included 
caregiver age, child race, caregiver education, marital status of caregiver, child health 
insurance type, and child developmental problems. Etiology of hydrocephalus, number of 
hydrocephalus related procedures, and history of shunt infection were abstracted from a 
prospectively collected institutional database. Child’s gestational age at birth, total number 
of non-temporary hydrocephalus procedures, and total number of external ventricular drain 
placements was collected retrospectively from the electronic medical record. Distance from 
residence to hospital was obtained using patient’s most recent zip code, as obtained from 
the electronic medical record. Recognizing that shunts can fail repeatedly, and that this may 
increase the risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms, we defined a new variable to capture 
those patients who have a history of a shunt failure cluster. The variable, shunt cluster, was 
defined as having three or more hydrocephalus operations within a two-month period.

Statistical Analysis

Categorical demographic characteristics were summarized using counts and percentages, 
while continuous demographic variables and traumatic stress scores were summarized using 
means and standard deviations. The Kruskall-Wallis test was used to compare the continuous 
outcomes and stress scores for different categories of a categorical variables that had small 
numbers in some categories (for example, age of caregivers, etiology of hydrocephalus, and 
ETV-alone hydrocephalus treatment). In these cases, we used non-parametric tests, as tests

for normality may not perform as well as needed with small numbers. For uniformity, we 
used Kruskall-Wallis for all other categorical variables. Scatterplots were examined, and 
Pearson correlation was estimated and tested (null hypothesis: correlation=0) to examine 
the association among pairs of continuous variables. Parametric tests were used for these 
comparisons because the issue of small numbers noted above was not a concern. In all 
tables, unadjusted p-values are presented. Analyses were done using SAS version 9.4.

Results

Study enrollment is shown in Figure 1.

Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms

Ninety-one caregivers completed the PCL-V. Mean score was 17.02 (standard deviation 
15.72; median 13.0), and scores ranged from 0 to 71 (Table 1). Thirteen caregivers (14%) 
scored 33 and above, a score suggestive of a preliminary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress 
disorder. When asked to identify their most traumatic life event, 47 (52%) caregivers 
identified their child’s hydrocephalus diagnosis or related event. Twenty-four (26%) stated 
an “other” event, and 19 (21%) declined to state their most traumatic event. Examples of 
free text responses to PTSD Criterion A question (“Briefly identify your worst event”) 
can be seen in Table 1. PCL-V scores showed statistically significant correlation with 
child race, parental marital and educational status (Table 2). Non-white race, less than 
college education, and marital status of single or without a partner all correlated with 
significantly higher parental PTSS. No other clinical or demographic factor showed 
significant association with PCL-V measure of parental PTSS.

The CSDC provides a parent report of the child’s PTSS. Sixty-nine parents completed the 
CSDC. Median score was 3.0 (range 0-30, mean 5.9, SD 7.3). Of all variables tested for 
association (Table 2), only child history of developmental problems showed a statistically 
significant association with CSDC scores. Children with developmental delay were scored 
by their caregivers as having greater PTSS than those without (total CDSC score 9.0 versus 
2.6, p<0.001).

The ASC-Kids is a child self-report of the child’s PTSS. Forty children completed the 
ASC-Kids. Median score was 5.0 (range 0-44, mean 8.9, SD 9.3). Among all variables 
tested, only gestational age at birth showed a statistically significant correlation with child 
self-assessment of PTSS (Table 2). Children with greater gestational age identified slightly 
higher levels of PTSS (rho = 0.38, p= 0.03). We performed two separate measurements 
of PTSS in children, a self-assessment and a parental assessment. Thirty-two children had 
complete data on both measures. We observed no correlation between caregiver-reported and 
child self-reported PTSS (rho=0.0095, p=0.96).

Resilience and Caregiver Burden

One hundred twenty-three parents completed the CD-RISC self-assessment of their own 
resilience. Scores ranged from 0 to 40, with mean resilience score of 30.0 (SD 8.3). 
CD-RISC scores are reported in quartiles, with cutoff values to compare respondents to 
the general population. Fifty-one caregivers (41%) had a score of 29 or less, placing them

in the lowest resilience quartile compared to the general population (Table 3). Forty children 
completed a self-assessment of resilience with the CD-RISC. The mean score was 24.1 
(range 0-40, SD 12.6). Twenty-four children (60%) scored in the lowest quartile of resilience 
compared to the general population. We used the Zarit Burden Interview to quantify the 
burden experiences by parents in caring for children with hydrocephalus. Median ZBI score 
was 6.0 (range 0-44, mean 8.1, SD 7.8).

Broadly, we observed a weak negative correlation between resilience and PTSS. Among 74 
caregivers who completed both PCL-V and CD-RISC, higher resilience was significantly 
associated with lower severity of PTSS (rho=−0.41, p<0.001). Fewer observations were 
available for analysis of child resilience versus PTSS. In 38 children who completed both 
ASC-Kids and CD-RISC, no significant correlation was observed (rho=−0.24, p=0.15). 
Similarly, no significant association was seen between parent-assessment of a child’s PTSS 
and the child’s self-assessment of resilience (32 pairs of caregivers CDSC and child CD-
RISC: rho=−0.055, p=0.76). Finally, we analyzed the relationship between burden of care 
and PTSS, measured by ZBI and PCL-V, respectively. There was a weak positive correlation 
between caregiver burden and PTSS (rho=0.27, p=0.02).

Discussion

Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms and Pediatric Hydrocephalus

To the authors knowledge, this is the first study of post-traumatic stress in children with 
hydrocephalus and their caregivers. Results indicate that post-traumatic stress is a significant 
problem for caregivers of children with hydrocephalus, as 14% of respondents identified 
post-traumatic stress symptoms significant enough to warrant a formal diagnosis of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, more than half of parents identify their child’s 
hydrocephalus as the most significant traumatic event of their entire lives. Published studies 
of parents in other complex health-care-related scenarios, such as caring for a child with 
cancer, bone marrow transplantation, or experiencing pregnancy loss, have shown similar 
severity of post-traumatic stress symptoms21. These results show that there is an important 
need for psychosocial support for pediatric hydrocephalus caregivers. Single parents, parents 
of minority children, those without a college degree may be at higher risk for significant 
PTSS.

Children with hydrocephalus display post-traumatic stress symptoms as well, though they 
may not be as severely affected as their parents. Unfortunately, few previous studies have 
used the CSDC or ASC-Kids, so there are few data available for comparison. Two studies 
of child self-report PTSS after traumatic injury found ASC-Kids scores higher than our 
sample. ASC-Kids scores of 18-26 were seen in 35 children hospitalized after injury, and 
mean ASC-Kids scores of 13.2 (SD 7.1) in 254 children after hospitalization or injury, 
compared to mean scores of 5.0 in our sample 19,22. Likewise, our sample showed similar 
ASC-Kids scores to the control group (ie. No history of sexual assault) in a study of sexual 
assault victims23. Comparing parent-report of child PTSS using the CSDC, we find similar 
mean score in our population (5.9) compared to a sample of children with single-ventricle 
congenital heart defects (mean score 7.0)24. While these results suggest that PTSS may 
not be as profound of an issue in children with hydrocephalus as in parents, there are

still some children who may benefit from attention to the psychological comorbidities of 
hydrocephalus.

Resilience, Burden, and PTSS

Limitations

Resilience, in the context of psychological response to trauma, is the process by which 
individuals utilize available resources to maintain well-being in the face of stress21. Studies 
of children with illness have shown that children and caregivers can display widely variable 
resilience25-28. In the present study, we find that both children with hydrocephalus and their 
parents are more likely than expected to score in the lowest quartile for resilience, compared 
to the general population. Compared to a sample of children with cancer, children with 
hydrocephalus have lower CD-RISC scores (mean 24 for hydrocephalus, 28 for cancer)27. 
This is particularly important because it has been shown that resilience is a teachable skill: 
Children and parents can undergo training to improve resilience27. Therefore, this may 
represent a specific target for intervention in children with hydrocephalus. Furthermore, in 
our previous study of quality of life, we found that psychological comorbidities were more 
closely associated with health-related quality of life than any clinical or demographic factor. 
Targeting resilience may be part of an approach to improve quality of life for children with 
hydrocephalus as well.

Finally, we observe a weak but statistically significant correlation between measures of 
caregiver burden and post-traumatic stress symptoms in parents. Correlation is not causation, 
so we cannot say if PTSS causes increased perception of burden or vice versa. However, we 
hypothesize that interventions targeted to reduce PTSS may help lessen the perception of 
burden for parents caring for children with hydrocephalus.

This study is a cross-sectional analysis of a single clinic population for which the period 
of observation was limited. The decision to supplement parental metrics for PTSS with the 
PCL-V was made after the study had already commenced because there was no means of 
assessing parental PTSS prior to instituting the PCL-V questionnaire. This is the reason that 
there are more parent responses to the CD-RISC than the PCL-V. While the late addition 
has some potential to introduce some bias, we feel this is unlikely and is offset by a 
markedly more complete assessment of parental PTSS. Recall and expectancy bias must be 
considered. Being asked about stress levels while attending a clinic visit focused on one’s 
child’s hydrocephalus may enhance the recall and perceived importance of hydrocephalus in 
a parent’s answers. Researcher expectancy bias is also a consideration. Our hypothesis was 
that PTSS is a relevant concern. Therefore, subtle non-verbal cues by the research team may 
influence how caregivers respond.

Children with hydrocephalus were only able to participate if they were deemed able 
by parents and researchers. Therefore, capable children with mild cognitive delay may 
have been excluded. However, the parent-report of child PTSS (CSDC) was administered 
regardless of the child’s intellectual abilities and shows results similar to child self-
assessment of PTSS. Therefore, we believe it is reasonable to conclude that post-traumatic 
stress symptoms are less prevalent in children with hydrocephalus than in their parents.

Finally, both the CSDC and ASC-Kids have been used in relatively few previous studies. 
Therefore, we are limited in our ability to interpret results from these metrics.

Conclusion

This is the first study to examine the prevalence and severity of post-traumatic stress 
symptoms in children with hydrocephalus and their parents. While children do not display 
significant PTSS more than control groups from previous studies, parents appear to have 
significantly elevated levels of PTSS. Importantly, when asked what it the most important 
traumatic event of their lives, over half of parents reply that it is their child’s hydrocephalus. 
In addition, we find evidence of low resilience in both parents and children, suggesting a 
potential future target for intervention.
