Objective: Several studies have investigated the negative toll the pandemic has had on
people’s mental health. However, there is limited research on the pandemic’s effect on
positive mental health variables. This article reports on the levels of self-esteem and well-
being (ﬂourishing and happiness)
in a sample of adults living in Ecuador and their
relationships with the characteristics of their personal situation and the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic had on their personal lives.

Methods: A total of 766 adults completed an anonymous online survey between March
and August 2020.

Results: Participants reported average scores in the ﬂourishing scale, the majority
considered themselves to be happy or very happy people, and more than half
presented high levels of self-esteem. Age, education, socioeconomic status,
time
spent using mobile phones and on hobbies, among others, explained self-esteem,
happiness, and ﬂourishing.

Conclusion: The relationships between sociodemographic and situational variables of
conﬁnement during the pandemic are discussed, as well as the possible predictors of
happiness, ﬂourishing, and self-esteem.

Keywords: COVID-19, Ecuador, ﬂourishing, happiness, self-esteem, well-being

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has altered the lifestyle of many people. Since the
beginning of the pandemic, many countries -including Ecuador- adopted various strategies to
their populations and reduce infections and deaths. These measures included

Evidence indicates that the longer people are in isolation
or conﬁnement, the greater the negative effects on their
mental health [2]. Several studies in Ecuador [3, 4] and
around the world [5, 6] report these detrimental effects on
the mental health of people because of the pandemic. Most

negative consequences of restrictive measures,

being and mental health during this health crisis,
imperative to analyze its potential effects on other aspects
of the health spectrum, such as the levels of self-esteem,
happiness, and ﬂourishing. Self-esteem is positively related
to general well-being and negatively related to stress,
anxiety, and depression [7]. Studies during the COVID-19
pandemic have found that self-esteem could be an anxiety-
buffer which can also protect from the impact of other
factors, such as depression and loneliness [8].

Another

in positive psychology is
happiness. Happiness allows noticing and taking advantage
of positive behaviors and circumstances [9] and relates to
better mental and physical health [10]. Studies conducted
during the pandemic show correlations between happiness
and other well-being variables. For example, a longitudinal
study found that a decrease in happiness predicted a decrease
in perceived health and was associated with a decreased
perceived quality of life [11].

study showed that there was a negative relationship between
COVID-19 fear and human ﬂourishing because of self-
isolation and restricted activities, particularly during the
lockdown periods [15].

This article seeks to report the levels of self-esteem and well-
being (ﬂourishing and global happiness) experienced by
people living in Ecuador during the months of quarantine
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider that self-esteem,
global happiness, and ﬂourishing may act as protective factors
against the possible negative consequences of the pandemic.

Instruments
The following information was analyzed in this study:

Sociodemographic Data
This section included self-report questions on sex, age, highest
level of education, as well as employment, socioeconomic,
marital, and relationship status (i.e., with or without a steady
partner).

Personal Living Conditions During COVID-19
This section inquired about the number of people with whom the
respondent was living in the same household and how many of
them were older than 60 years or younger than 12 years of age.
We also inquired about whether the respondent was in the
highest risk group for COVID-19 (due to age or pre- existing
illness), whether there were changes in his/her work situation due
to the pandemic (loss of a job or not), the number of weekly
outings during the quarantine, and the perceived increase in time
spent using cell phones, doing hobbies, and conducting physical
exercise.

COVID-19 Effects
This section included questions on whether the respondent, or
a person close to them had had symptoms, had received a
positive diagnosis, had been hospitalized, or had died from
COVID-19.

Self-Esteem Scale
We used the Rosenberg Scale [16], validated in Spanish [7] in this
study. This questionnaire consists of 10 items using a Likert-type
scale from 1 = not at all to 4 = very much. Some examples of its
statements are “I feel that I’m a person of worthy, at least on an
equal plane with others” and “On the whole, I am satisﬁed with
myself.” After reversing ﬁve items and summing the total score,
responses are classiﬁed into low [10–25], medium [26–29], and
high (30–40) levels of self-esteem. In this study, this scale showed
a reliability of 0.85.

Global Happiness
To explore perceived global happiness, respondents were asked:
“Do you consider yourself a happy person?” Response options
ranged from 1 = not at all to 4 = very much.

Self-Esteem, Happiness, Flourishing, and COVID-19

Flourishing
The Flourishing Scale [17] was used in its Spanish version [18]. This
scale assesses social and psychological ﬂourishing through the
perception of success in relationships, self-esteem, purpose in life,
and optimism. It has eight items with Likert-type response options (1
= not at all to 4 = very much). The overall score indicates the
psychological well-being corresponding to ﬂourishing, and it is
obtained from the sum of all responses. The total score ranges
from 8 to 32. The higher the total score, the higher the levels of well-
being. Cronbach’s alpha of this scale was 0.89.

Procedure
The study received approval from the ethics committee of the
University of Navarra (2020.087) before data collection. The
survey was created in Google Forms and the link was
distributed through the social networks of the researchers and
the research teams involved; an email was also sent through the
distribution lists of the university of the research group in
Ecuador, after obtaining the respective permissions. The
informed consent protocol,
the
research and the voluntariness and anonymity of participation,
was shown on the ﬁrst page of the survey. Data were collected
during the highest peak of the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19
pandemic in Ecuador between March and August 2020.

Data Analysis
Descriptive analyses were performed for the sample and the study
variables. Pearson’s correlations were run for age, number of people in
the same household, number of people over 60 and under 12 years old
living in the same household. In addition, according to the type of
variable, different analyses were performed to determine the
univariate relationships and differences on the study variables (self-
esteem, happiness, and ﬂourishing) based on the sociodemographic
variables (sex, higher level of education achieved, employment,
socioeconomic, marital, and relationship status), the situational
context of conﬁnement (whether the respondent was in the
highest risk group for COVID-19, whether the participant had lost
his/her job, the number of weekly outings, and the perceived increase
in time spent using cell phones, hobbies, and physical exercise), and
the effects of COVID-19 (whether the respondent or a close person
had symptoms, had a positive diagnosis, had been hospitalized, or had
died from COVID-19). Given that self-esteem and happiness were
codiﬁed by levels, Chi-squares were performed to identify potential
differences. Due to its continuous nature, ANOVAs were conducted
when analyzing the ﬂourishing scores. Finally, for each of the three
main variables, linear regressions were performed placing them as
dependent variables and including, as independent variables, those
that were shown to be signiﬁcant in the previous analyses. All analyses
were carried out using SPSS version 25.

Most participants (n = 649, 84.7%) reported spending the
lockdown period with others in the same household. The number
of people they were living with ranged from 1 to 14 (Mdn = 3,
IQR = 2). Of the total number of respondents who indicated living
with people over 60 years (n = 297, 38.8%), the majority reported
living with one or two people. On the other hand, of the
participants who lived with children under 12 years (n = 235,
30.7%), 160 (20.9%) lived with one child, 52 (6.8%) with two
children, and 23 (3.0%) with three children. Table 2 shows the
details of participants’ personal living conditions.

In addition, as seen in Table 3, most participants reported
having family members or acquaintances who had experienced
symptoms of
the disease, or who had received a positive
diagnosis. However, most participants reported not knowing
whether people in their social network had been hospitalized
or had died from COVID-19.

pandemic-related variables. Table 4 indicates the levels of self-
esteem, global happiness, and ﬂourishing according to the
sociodemographic variables and Table 5 shows these key
variables according to the context variables.

Self-Esteem
On average, the sample presented high levels of self-esteem (M =
30.3, SD = 5.4). When analyzing self-esteem by categorial levels,
results shown that slightly more than half of the sample (n = 454,
59.3%) presented high levels of self-esteem, whereas the rest
presented medium (n = 171, 22.3%) and low (n = 141, 18.4%)
levels. When analyzing its relationship to the sociodemographic
variables, sex was not signiﬁcant, but age was positively correlated

(r = 0.22, p < 0.001). It was observed that people between 18 and
22 years of age had lower self-esteem than the rest of the age
groups, χ2 (10, N = 766) = 54.67, p < 0.001. A signiﬁcant
relationship was also observed with the education level. People
with high school education or less (n = 203) had lower levels of
self-esteem (29.06% low, 27.59% medium and 43.35% high) than
those with professional or technical training (n = 83; 13.25% low,
19.28% medium and 67.47% high) and those with higher
education (n = 480; 14.79% low, 20.63% medium and 64.58%
high), χ2 = (4, N = 766) = 32.52, p < 0.001.

In the case of employment status, people who reported only
studying had signiﬁcantly lower levels of self-esteem compared to
those who worked and studied, and those who reported only
working, χ 2 (10, N = 766) = 38.68, p < 0.001. In contrast, people
with a low socioeconomic status presented signiﬁcantly lower
levels of self-esteem compared to people with high and medium
levels, χ 2 (4, N = 766) = 20.39, p < 0.001.

Regarding marital and relationship status, it was observed that
single people without children, χ 2 (8, N = 766) = 29.67, p < 0.001,
and those without a stable partner, χ 2 (2, N = 766) = 16.77, p <
0.001, had signiﬁcantly lower levels of self-esteem compared to
married people or those with a stable partner.

increased their cell phone usage time by “a lot” presented
lower levels of self-esteem compared to those who increased
their usage by “a little” and “quite a lot” χ 2 (6, N = 766) = 12.99,
p = 0.04. People who reported having decreased their time
dedicated to hobbies also showed signiﬁcantly lower levels of
self-esteem compared to those who reported an increase on it, χ 2
(4, N = 766) = 10.54, p = 0.03. On the other hand, knowing people
directly affected by COVID-19 or presenting these effects oneself
(having symptoms, conﬁrmed diagnosis, hospitalization) did not
have statistically signiﬁcant relationships.

Global Happiness
Most respondents considered themselves to be happy people.
Responses on this variable ranged from not at all (n = 10, 1.3%), a
little (n = 129, 16.8%), quite a lot (n = 453, 59.1%), and very much
(n = 174, 22.7%). The sociodemographic variables that showed
signiﬁcant relationships with global happiness levels were age
(r = 0.15, p < 0.001), employment status (χ 2 (15, N = 766) = 37.21,
p = 0.001), socioeconomic status (χ 2 (6, N = 766) = 22.72,

Likewise, retired people reported being signiﬁcantly happier
than unemployed people. On the other hand, people with high
and medium socioeconomic status reported signiﬁcantly higher
levels of happiness than people with lower socioeconomic status.
Finally, married people and those with a stable partner considered
themselves happier than people without a stable partner.

Self-Esteem, Happiness, Flourishing, and COVID-19

Concerning the personal living conditions during lockdown,
although the student’s t-test was not signiﬁcant between living
alone or not, the number of people living in the same household
showed a signiﬁcant negative correlation with ﬂourishing
(r = −0.08, p = 0.02). There were lower levels of ﬂourishing
when participants reported living with more people. On the other
hand, people who had decreased the time spent on their hobbies
presented lower levels of ﬂourishing than those who had
increased it [F (2,763) = 5.91, p = 0.003].

When analyzing the levels of ﬂourishing according to the
COVID-19 effects’ variables, the results indicated that people
who did not know anyone with symptoms presented lower levels
of ﬂourishing than those who had a family member with
those who themselves presented symptoms.
symptoms or
Similarly, people who had a family member with symptoms
had higher levels of ﬂourishing than those who knew someone
(a non-family member) in that situation [F (3,762) = 8.47, p <
0.001]. Regarding COVID-19 diagnosis, people who did not
know anyone with a conﬁrmed diagnosis had signiﬁcantly
lower levels of ﬂourishing compared to those who had a
family member, an acquaintance, or
those who had the
diagnosis themselves [F(3,762) = 8.89, p < 0.001]. Knowing
someone who had required hospitalization or who had died
was not signiﬁcant related to the levels of ﬂourishing.

Finally, when running the linear regression, non-signiﬁcant
variables were excluded, age (β = 0.021, p = 0.62), education (β =
0.059, p = 0.13), sentimental situation (β = 0.052, p = 0.20), number
of people living in the same household (β = −0.051, p = 0.15), and
COVID-19 symptoms (β = −0.034, p = 0.56). The model that
signiﬁcantly explained ﬂourishing [F (4, 761) = 16.33, p < 0.001,
adjusted =0.074] included employment status (β = −0.140, p < 0.001),

socioeconomic status (β = 0.147, p < 0.001), time spent in hobbies (β
= 0.113, p = 0.001), and knowing a person with a diagnosis of
COVID-19 (β = −146, p < 0.001).

DISCUSSION

This
study analyzed the self-esteem and the well-being
(ﬂourishing and happiness) of people living in Ecuador during
lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like studies
conducted before the pandemic in the Ecuadorian population,
our sample presented high levels of self-esteem. For example, one
conducted in 2017 [19] found similar overall levels of self-esteem
(M = 31.7) to those found in our study (M = 30.3), and
highlighted self-esteem as a protective factor against meeting
the criteria for a major depressive episode, panic disorder, and
suicide risk [19].

Regarding happiness, unlike studies that report a decrease in
happiness and optimism [20] and similar to others in the same
cultural context [21], most respondents in our study considered
themselves to be happy people. This result is not surprising given
that the 2021 World Happiness Report shows an increase in
sadness and worry globally, but an stable overall life evaluations
and happiness ranking [22]. Also, according to the World
Happiness Index, in 2020 Ecuador ranked in 58th place of the
149 countries [23].

Unlike a cross-sectional study in the United States that found
that COVID-19 fear signiﬁcantly decreased human ﬂourishing
and that gender moderated the relationship between those two
variables [15], people from our sample showed average levels of
ﬂourishing. Longitudinal research may also support our ﬁndings.
For example, a study that evaluated differences in mental health
before and during the pandemic showed that, although there was
a decline in mental health indicators -including ﬂourishing-
during the initial stages of the lockdown measures, they were
not signiﬁcant when compared to the changes from previous
years [24]. Maybe, during the pandemic, people had to adapt and
learn to manage their circumstances and achieved environmental
mastery
related to
and personal growth,
ﬂourishing [25]. Research also suggests
that people who
experience this growth, highlight the opportunities that may
arise during life transitions [25]. Results from the current
study could show similar pathways.

characteristics

Regarding sociodemographic and context variables, research
shows that there is no deﬁnitive evidence linking them as risk
factors for mental health problems during quarantine [2],
although some have been found that being younger, having
lower levels of education, being female, and having a child
[26] are features related to greater psychological distress.

The results of our study can be contrasted with others
conducted in previous quarantines and with current others
about psychological distress that indicate that younger people
have higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression [27]. In
concordance with this body of research, we found that the
older the age,
the greater the
the higher the self-esteem,
overall happiness, and the higher the levels of ﬂourishing. On
the other hand, lower levels of education were related to lower
self-esteem and lower levels of ﬂourishing. Likewise, people with
low socioeconomic status had signiﬁcantly lower levels of self-
esteem, happiness, and ﬂourishing. Such results highlight the
importance of the socio-cultural determinants of health and the
importance of shifting our perspective to see the COVID-19
situation as a syndemic rather than a pandemic [28]. This way, we
could consider the interaction between social and biological
factors to better face this disease and its consequences.

Single people without children and those without a stable
partner presented lower self-esteem. The latter also considered
themselves to be less happy and present
lower levels of
ﬂourishing. Concerning occupational status, people who were
only studying presented lower self-esteem and overall happiness
than those who had a job. This ﬁnding complements another
study [29] where students presented greater psychological
distress. A possible explanation for this result may be that the
change of
study modality (from face-to-face to virtual)
confronted students with a lifestyle in which not only their
social contact was modiﬁed but also their access to education,
with institutions and teachers not fully prepared for this abrupt
change.

Although social contact is important, the results indicated that
there are lower levels of ﬂourishing when more people live in the
same physical space. This may be due to the long duration of
conﬁnement and restrictions in the country. In addition, it can be
attributed to the fact that being in the same household with many

people means sharing spaces and resources without the possibility
of external distractions or time away from home, which can result
in the emergence of interpersonal conﬂicts. Thus, being in the
same physical space might not translate into having social
support or positive social interactions.

During this pandemic,

there has been an insistence on
voluntary conﬁnement, mandatory lockdowns, and physical
distancing to curb contagion. This shift towards carrying out
daily activities remotely encouraged greater use of technology.
However, we found that people who increased the time they spent
using cell phones had lower levels of self-esteem than those who
perceived that they were using them the same amount of time as
before the pandemic. Although the Internet can be a convenient
way to stay in touch with others, excessive use may have more
negative than positive effects. This result is in line with several
previous studies that relate screen time to lower personal well-
being and depressive [30] and anxious symptomatology [31].

On the contrary, people who reported an increase in the amount
of time spent on hobbies presented higher self-esteem and better
levels of ﬂourishing. These results are consistent with previous
studies that relate leisure activities with better mental health [32]
and lower symptoms of depression [33] and anxiety [34] in the adult
population. They are also related to recommendations made at the
beginning of the pandemic to mitigate the possible negative effects of
social distancing and quarantine [35].

In addition to the conﬁnement and other restriction measures,
many people have directly experienced the effects of COVID-19.
Despite knowing someone with COVID-19 symptoms was a
predictor of lower ﬂourishing, those who indicated that they
did not know anyone with symptoms or with a conﬁrmed
diagnosis had lower levels of ﬂourishing than those who had a
family member with symptoms. Also, knowing someone who had
been hospitalized or someone who had died from COVID-19
were not related to ﬂourishing levels. People who have not
experienced effects on physical health ﬁrsthand, or through
people close to them, might be more uncertain about the
COVID-19 situation and might perceive
the measures
implemented as more restrictive and meaningless. Likewise,

improvement. A possible explanation for these results derives
from the Terror Management Theory [36] which explains the
conscious (proximal defenses) and unconscious (distal defenses)
mechanisms that people use to protect themselves from death
anxiety. Following this theory [8, 37], the higher levels of thriving

Conclusion and Limitations
Mental health is more than the absence of disease and the positive
aspects of life might be more important than the absence of negative
aspects [12]. Thus, this study focused on the positive aspects of
mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that,
in general, participants had high levels of self-esteem, considered
themselves to be fairly or very happy individuals, and had an average
level of ﬂourishing. Age, education, socioeconomic status, time spent
on mobile phones, and hobbies were found to be relevant to
happiness, ﬂourishing, and self-esteem.
