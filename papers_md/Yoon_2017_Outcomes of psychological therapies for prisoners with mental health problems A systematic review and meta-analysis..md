Objective: Prisoners worldwide have substantial mental health needs, but the efficacy of psychological therapy
in prisons is unknown. We aimed to systematically review psychological therapies with mental health
outcomes in prisoners and qualitatively summarize difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials
(RCTs). Method: We systematically identified RCTs of psychological therapies with mental health outcomes
in prisoners (37 studies). Effect sizes were calculated and meta-analyzed. Eligible studies were assessed for
quality. Subgroup and metaregression analyses were conducted to examine sources of between-study heter-
ogeneity. Thematic analysis reviewed difficulties in conducting prison RCTs. Results: In 37 identified studies,
psychological therapies showed a medium effect size (0.50, 95% CI [0.34, 0.66]) with high levels of
heterogeneity with the most evidence for CBT and mindfulness-based trials. Studies that used no treatment
(0.77, 95% CI [0.50, 1.03]) or waitlist controls (0.71, 95% CI [0.43, 1.00]) had larger effect sizes than those
that had treatment-as-usual or other psychological therapies as controls (0.21, 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]). Effects
were not sustained on follow-up at 3 and 6 months. No differences were found between group and individual
therapy, or different treatment types. The use of a fidelity measure was associated with lower effect sizes.
Qualitative analysis identified difficulties with follow-up and institutional constraints on scheduling and
implementation of trials. Conclusions: CBT and mindfulness-based therapies are modestly effective in
prisoners for depression and anxiety outcomes. In prisons with existing psychological therapies, more
evidence is required before additional therapies can be recommended.

What is the public health significance of this article?
This study suggests that CBT and mindfulness-based therapies are modestly effective in prisoners in
treating depression and anxiety symptoms. No clear difference between group and individual-based
treatments were found. Additional psychological treatments need stronger evidence before they could
be considered in jails and prisons.

Keywords: cognitive behavioral therapy, depression, meta-analysis, mindfulness, prison

It is estimated that 10% to 12% of people in jails and prisons have
diagnoses of major depression (Fazel & Seewald, 2012), 4% have
psychotic illnesses (Fazel & Seewald, 2012), and the prevalence of
posttraumatic stress (Goff, Rose, Rose, & Purves, 2007), anxiety and
personality disorders are higher than that of the general population of
similar ages (Butler et al., 2006; Trestman, Ford, Zhang, & Wies-
brock, 2007). With more than 10 million people in jails and prisons
worldwide (Walmsley, 2013), a substantial burden of psychological
morbidity is thus found in prisoners. These mental health problems

are risk factors for a range of adverse outcomes in prison and on
release including self-harm (Hawton, Linsell, Adeniji, Sariaslan, &
Fazel, 2014), suicide (Fazel, Cartwright, Norman-Nott, & Hawton,
2008; Fazel, Grann, Kling, & Hawton, 2011; Haglund et al., 2014;
Pratt, Piper, Appleby, Webb, & Shaw, 2006; Rivlin, Hawton, Mar-
zano, & Fazel, 2010; Verona, Hicks, & Patrick, 2005), and violence
inside prison (Goncalves et al., 2014) and reoffending in re-
leased prisoners (Baillargeon, Binswanger, Penn, Williams, &
Murray, 2009; Chang, Larsson, Lichtenstein, & Fazel, 2015;

YOON, SLADE, AND FAZEL

Shaffer et al., 2007). To address this, many countries have
introduced specialist mental health services in prisons but these
vary considerably within and between countries, including for
psychological therapies. Little is known about which treatments
are based on good quality evidence, which may not be generaliz-
able from community settings because of the particular challenges
of delivering treatment in prisons based on individual characteris-
tics (including comorbidity) and the nature of the environment.

A number of systematic reviews of mental health interventions
for prisoners have been published (Bartlett et al., 2015; Fontan-
arosa, Uhl, Oyesanmi, & Schoelles, 2013; Heckman, Cropsey, &
Olds-Davis, 2007; Himelstein, 2011; Kouyoumdjian et al., 2015;
Leigh-Hunt & Perry, 2015; Morgan & Flora, 2002; Morgan et al.,
2012; Ross, Quayle, Newman, & Tansey, 2013; Shonin, Van
Gordon, Slade, & Griffiths, 2013; Sirdifield, Gojkovic, Brooker, &
Ferriter, 2009). However, they mostly focus on selected popula-
tions and disorders (Leigh-Hunt & Perry, 2015), specific therapies
(Shonin et al., 2013) and combine randomized and nonrandomized
trials (Bartlett et al., 2015; Morgan et al., 2012). Other reviews
have been broader literature reviews that examined different study
designs (including theoretical papers, audits, needs assessments,
and screening; Sirdifield et al., 2009) or included interventions
outside prison (Fontanarosa et al., 2013). One review of English-
language studies that covered a broad range of interventions and
outcomes using dichotomous diagnoses found a strong effect size
(ES (cid:2) 0.87) but did not explore sources of heterogeneity or
compare the outcomes by treatment type (Morgan et al., 2012).
Another recent review covered RCTs to improve health during
imprisonment and a year after release, but this review covered a
wide range of mostly physical health and drug abuse interventions
(Kouyoumdjian et al., 2015), did not metaanalyze findings, and
used a search strategy that was not optimized for identifying
psychological treatments. Thus, previous reviews have been lim-
ited in examining the efficacy of psychological therapies by either
being too specific or overly broad.

This paper aims to address these gaps by conducting a system-
atic review and meta-analysis on solely RCTs of psychological
therapies of unselected samples of prisoners. For the purposes of
this review, prisoners are considered to be presentenced (also
known as remand prisoners or detainees) and sentenced individu-
als in jails and prisons, but not persons in police custody or other
forms of administrative detention (such as immigrant detention
centers). We sought to compare effect sizes across different types
of psychological therapies and examine sources of heterogeneity.
In addition, we qualitatively examined the difficulties in imple-
menting RCTs of psychological therapies in prisons in order to
make further recommendations for research.

Method

Protocol and Registration

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed (Moher, Liberati, Tet-
zlaff, & Altman, 2009), and the protocol was prospectively registered
in PROSPERO (n.d.; the International prospective register of system-
atic reviews) to minimize reporting bias through adherence to the
initial protocol and to avoid duplication so that researchers can see
what systematic reviews are in progress before undertaking their own.

Search Strategy

PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Global Health, PubMed, CINAHL, Na-
tional Criminal Justice Reference Service, Scopus, EMBASE, and
Cochrane Library were searched from their start dates until May 30,
2015. Additional targeted searches were conducted by hand-searching
citations and reference lists of other systematic reviews and articles.
Targeted searches on specific authors (identified from previous pa-
pers), mindfulness-based therapies, and treatments for psychopathy
were conducted separately. We corresponded with authors to clarify
data when necessary. Details about keywords are outlined in Appen-
dix A.

Study Eligibility

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as follows:
Study design. RCTs including pilot studies and cluster-
randomized trials were included. Nonrandomized trials (including
pretest/posttest comparisons) and case studies were excluded.

Population. Prisoners (including juveniles, remand, detain-
ees) were included. Samples not currently in prison (e.g., post-
prison release treatments (Sacks, McKendrick, & Hamilton, 2012),
people on parole, and in secure hospitals or therapeutic commu-
nities outside prisons) were excluded.

Interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behav-
ior therapy, Mindfulness-based Therapy, and other group treatments
such as Music Therapy and Art Therapy (including self-help treat-
ments) were included. Studies examining only medication were ex-
cluded.

Outcomes. Studies that reported psychological

improvement
measured by standardized instruments at posttreatment and follow-up
were included. Outcomes restricted to recidivism or substance use
were excluded.

Language. Studies in any language including unpublished
(e.g., doctorates) reports were considered. Studies that did not
provide data to calculate effect sizes were excluded.

Studies treating psychopathy or sociopathy in prisons were not
included because none of the identified studies had standardized
psychological outcomes.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

In addition to effect sizes, 95% confidence intervals, variance of
outcomes, and prespecified study characteristics were recorded. Pri-
mary outcome was selected as being the most commonly used psy-
chological assessment in the included study to facilitate comparisons.
A second extractor (a consultant psychiatrist with prison experience)
extracted data independently, and any disagreements were resolved.
Eligible studies were assessed using the quality checklist used
by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE; see
Appendix B), which assesses internal validity such as the use of
adequate concealment method for participant allocation (conceal-
ing the allocation sequence from research and clinical staff and
participants until permanent assignment of participants into each
study group), blinding of subjects and investigators, and intention-
to-treat analyses. Overall rating was either: (cid:3) (few or no criteria
fulfilled), (cid:4) (some fulfilled), or (cid:4)(cid:4) (all or most fulfilled).

Statistical Analysis

Metaregression and Publication Bias

Effect size calculation. The standardized mean difference (d),
95% confidence intervals, and variance were calculated for each
study (Wilson, 2001). For studies with more than one control
group, the one that received more therapy was chosen over the
waitlist control in order to have a more conservative estimate. For
a study that compared two different treatment groups, each treat-
ment group was independently compared with controls. Double-
counting of the participants did not apply as no studies reported
participants in both intervention groups (Higgins, 2011).

Meta-analysis. Given the clinical heterogeneity between
studies, random-effects models were conducted. The degree of
statistical heterogeneity was assessed using I2, which represents
the percentage of the observed variation in effect size across
studies due to true heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins &
Thompson, 2002) with values of 25%, 50%, and 75% indicating
low, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively (Hig-
gins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003).

Effect sizes were grouped into domains and presented in forest
plots. First, the studies were grouped by comparator type: one
group of studies included no treatment (including no-contact
group) as controls, and another included waitlist as controls. A
final group included active treatment controls, such as treatment-
as-usual or another form of psychological therapy such as individ-
ual supportive therapy, standard prison-based therapeutic commu-
nity, supportive group therapy (SGT), or attention-matched
manualized psychoeducation (Ford, Chang, Levine, & Zhang,
2013; Johnson & Zlotnick, 2012; Messina, Grella, Cartier, &
Torres, 2010; Perkins, 1998; Wilson, 1990).

Second, we stratified studies by treatment type: CBT-based,
mindfulness-based, trauma-based, and ‘other’ therapies. These cat-
egories were chosen so that they included at least 5 studies (the
minimum prespecified number of studies). In the CBT-based cat-
egory, in addition to traditional CBT techniques (Khodayarifard,
Shokoohi-Yekta, & Hamot, 2010), therapies using CBT principles
(e.g., Seeking Safety [Wolff et al., 2015; Zlotnick, 2002; Zlotnick,
Johnson, & Najavits, 2009] and Cognitive Processing Therapy
[Ahrens & Rexford, 2002]) were combined. For the mindfulness-
based category, meditation was included (Abrams & Siegel, 1978).
Trauma-based category included therapies that were trauma-
focused and targeted at improving trauma symptoms (Bradley &
Follingstad, 2003; Cole, Sarlund-Heinrich, & Brown, 2007; Rich-
ards, Beal, Seagal, & Pennebaker, 2000; Valentine & Smith, 2001;
Wolff et al., 2015). In “other,” Interpersonal Psychotherapy (John-
son & Zlotnick, 2012), mother–infant attachment based therapy
(Sleed, Baradon, & Fonagy, 2013), Gender Responsive Treatment
(Messina et al., 2010), art therapy (Gussak, 2007, 2009), music
therapy (Chen, Hannibal, & Gold, 2016; Gold et al., 2014), and
video pretraining (Hilkey, Wilhelm, & Horne, 1982) were in-
cluded. Two therapies that combined CBT and mindfulness
(Lanza, García, Lamelas, & González-Menéndez, 2014; Messina
et al., 2010) were considered “other.”

Test of between-groups heterogeneity of these subgroups by
treatment type were conducted using the mixed-effect analysis
(Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2011).

Subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses investigated treat-
ment format (group, individual, or combination) and individual
outcomes (e.g., depression).

Metaregression analysis was performed to examine sources of
heterogeneity on a range of prespecified factors. For the dichoto-
mous version of the gender variable, more than 90% of male was
classified as male even when total sample included some females.
Because of a large number of U.S.-based studies (n (cid:2) 26) and few
studies from each of the other countries included, the variable of
country setting was analyzed as U.S. versus rest of the world.

In metaregression, variables in univariate analyses with p values
of (cid:5)0.l were included in multivariable models. Multivariable analysis
was conducted with all of the variables simultaneously with either the
dichotomous or continuous version of each variable to avoid col-
linearity (Chatterjee & Hadi, 2006). If there were fewer than 10
studies that reported the explanatory variable(s) of interest, metare-
gression analysis was not performed (Thompson & Higgins, 2002).
To test for publication bias, funnel plot analysis and Egger’s test
were performed (Sterne & Egger, 2001; Sterne et al., 2011; Tacco-
nelli, 2010). As an exploratory analysis, the trim and fill analysis (with
random-effects model) was also conducted with the total sample and
subset of samples (studies with no treatment/waitlist controls) to
identify and correct for funnel plot asymmetry attributable to publi-
cation bias (Higgins, 2011; Peters, Sutton, Jones, Abrams, & Rushton,
2007). Analyses were performed in STATA-IC 14.

Qualitative Analysis

For a qualitative analysis on the difficulties of conducting RCTs of
psychological therapies in prisons, the discussion sections (and in
particular the limitations parts) of included studies were reviewed
through a thematic analysis, which identifies key recurrent messages
from series of studies (Bearman & Dawson, 2013). The identified
factors were organized thematically by the frequency of their appear-
ance in these studies, and those that were mentioned by at least two
independent researchers were extracted for the purposes of this syn-
thesis.

Results

Main Results

Study characteristics. We identified 37 studies from 31 pub-
lications (see Figure 1) between 1979 and 2015 from 7 different
countries (China, India, Iran, Norway, Spain, US, and U.K.). This
included 2,761 prisoners, 59% of whom were male. The mean age
was 31.8 years (adult prisoners: 34.4 years, juveniles: 16.9 years).
All identified studies recruited voluntary participants through in-
formed consent, and none of the studied treatments were manda-
tory. Sixteen studies had either a specific diagnosis such as PTSD
(n (cid:2) 6) and depression (n (cid:2) 2) or specific symptoms in their
inclusion criteria (see Appendix C for details of included studies).
Treatment targets and types of outcome measures. The
included RCTs focused on the following primary outcomes: de-
pressed mood (n (cid:2) 20), anxiety (n (cid:2) 21), trauma symptoms (n (cid:2) 10),
and overall psychopathology (n (cid:2) 17). Secondary outcomes were
somatization (n (cid:2) 9) and hostility/anger (n (cid:2) 11). The most common
primary outcome measures reported were: Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI; Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), BDI-II
(Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), global severity index of the Brief

Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), State–Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, 1989), Youth Self Report
(YSR; Achenbach, 1991), and global severity index of the Symptom
Checklist Revised (SCL-90 –R; Derogatis & Unger, 2010). All pri-
mary outcome measures were validated (see Appendix C for list)
apart from an insomnia checklist (Sumter, Monk-Turner, & Turner,
2009).

Treatment length and quality rating. Treatment length typ-
ically ranged from 10 days to 18 weeks with a mean of 10 weeks.
None of the studies were excluded based on quality rating. How-
ever, seven studies of the 37 studies met the highest quality rating
(Ford et al., 2013; Johnson & Zlotnick, 2012; Messina et al., 2010;
Mitchell et al., 2011; Pardini et al., 2014; Sleed et al., 2013;
Valentine & Smith, 2001; see Appendix D).

In addition, there were 12 studies with a satisfactory fidelity mea-
sure of treatment, 5 with a partial measure, 9 studies without any
measure and 11 studies not reporting. Seven studies used double-
blinding.

Overall effect sizes. Psychological treatments had a pooled
effect size of 0.50 (95% CI [0.34 –0.66]) with high levels of hetero-

geneity (I2 (cid:2) 73%; 95% CI [62%, 80%]). Higher effect sizes were
reported in studies with no treatment controls (ES (cid:2) 0.77; 95% CI
[0.50, 1.03]; I2 (cid:2) 0%, 95% CI [0%, 75%]) and waitlist controls (ES (cid:2)
0.71; 95% CI [0.43, 1.00]; I2 (cid:2) 80%, 95% CI [67%, 87%]) than those
with active treatment controls (ES (cid:2) 0.21; 95% CI [0.01, 0.42]; I2 (cid:2)
63%, 95% CI [36%, 78%]; see Figure 2).

Specific types of outcomes. Twenty studies that measured
depression outcomes had a pooled effect size of 0.60, 95% CI
[0.38, 0.83] with high heterogeneity (I2 (cid:2) 71%, 95% CI [54%,
81%]; see Figure 3). There were higher effect sizes in the trials that
used no treatment and waitlist controls.

Psychological

treatments were effective for other mental
health outcomes including anxiety, overall psychopathology,
trauma, and anger/hostility but not for somatization (see Table
1).

Effect sizes at follow-up. Six studies investigated outcomes at
3 months posttreatment, and reported a nonsignificant pooled
effect size of 0.29, 95% CI [(cid:3)0.05, 0.64]; I2 (cid:2) 62%, 95% CI [8%,
84%]. When one study (Wolff et al., 2015) which compared two
active treatments was removed, there was little difference (ES (cid:2)
0.35; 95% CI [0.09, 0.79]). Five studies that reported outcomes at

6 months after treatment found no effect (ES (cid:2) 0.06; 95% CI
[(cid:3)0.15, 0.26]; I2 (cid:2) 0%, 95% CI [0%, 79%]).

Sensitivity analysis. Removal of one outlier (n (cid:2) 9) with a
large effect size (d (cid:2) 2.27; Cole et al., 2007) did not materially
change the overall effect (ES (cid:2) 0.48; 95% CI [0.32, 0.65]; I2 (cid:2)
73%, 95% CI [62%, 80%]) nor that of the subgroup with no
treatment controls (ES (cid:2) 0.73; 95% CI [0.46, 1.00]; I2 (cid:2) 0%, 95%
CI [0%, 79%]).

Secondary analyses. No clear differences were found be-
tween group therapy and individual therapy (ES (cid:2) 0.43; 95% CI
[0.26, 0.60] vs. ES (cid:2) 0.38; 95% CI [0.02, 0.74]), or combination
therapy (ES (cid:2) 0.72; 95% CI [0.25, 1.19]). When the studies were
stratified by treatment type, effect sizes did not significantly differ
(see Figure 4).

Metaregression Results

Univariate metaregression analysis. Higher attrition rates
and the use of no treatment/waitlist controls correlated with higher
effect sizes (see Table 2).

Multivariable metaregression analysis.

In multivariable
models, the fidelity measure was significant, (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.86, SE((cid:6)) (cid:2)
0.30, p (cid:2) .02. Even when missing data (n (cid:2) 10) were assumed to
not use a fidelity measure, the variable remained significant in 32
studies, (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.52, SE((cid:6)) (cid:2) 0.23, p (cid:2) .03.

Metaregression within subgroups.

In studies with waitlist
controls, sample size (dichotomous) was significant in the univari-
able analysis (p (cid:5) .05). In the studies with no treatment controls,
metaregression analysis was limited because of a small number of

studies and high levels of collinearity between variables (e.g.,
retention rate, sample size). When retention rate, publication year,
and sample size were included in multivariable analysis for waitlist
control studies, retention rate, (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.68, SE((cid:6)) (cid:2) 0.25, p (cid:2) .021,
and sample size (as a continuous variable: (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.006, SE((cid:6)) (cid:2)
0.002, p (cid:2) .032; dichotomous variable: (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:3)0.68, SE((cid:6)) (cid:2) 0.21,
p (cid:2) .007) remained significant.

Difficulties of conducting RCTs in prisons (thematic
analysis). A thematic analysis was conducted on the same 37
studies included in the quantative analysis (Sleed et al., 2013). The

main themes identified were posttreatment follow-up and institutional
constraints. The most common theme was difficulties with posttreat-
ment follow-up (Chandiramani, Verma, & Dhar, 2000; Cole et al.,
2007; Gussak, 2007; Maunder et al., 2009; Perkins, 1998; Valentine
& Smith, 2001) because of high rates of release (Chandiramani et al.,
2000), rapid turnover of prisoners (Sleed et al., 2013), short duration
of stay (Gold et al., 2014), with difficulties in ensuring continuity of
care (Mitchell et al., 2011; Wolff et al., 2015).

The second most commonly identified problem was institutional
constraints which reflected two main subcategories: constraints on the

scheduling of sessions (e.g., scheduling conflicts with other activities
(Ford et al., 2013) and ‘lock-downs’ (Messina et al., 2010), high
attrition rates (Bradley & Follingstad, 2003; Gussak, 2009; Lanza et
al., 2014; Loper & Tuerk, 2011; Sleed et al., 2013; Zlotnick, 2002)
partly attributable to scheduling changes (Cole et al., 2007; Loper &
Tuerk, 2011) and inmate infractions that restricted enrolment into
treatment programs (Loper & Tuerk, 2011). The second subtheme—
constraints on the implementation of proposed individual study char-

ing biological markers or video recording (Bilderbeck, Farias, Brazil,

and controlling for changes in the social environment of the prison
(Biggam & Power, 2002; Chandiramani et al., 2000; Johnson &

Discussion

We have reported a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs
of psychological therapies focused on prisoner mental health out-
comes based on 37 studies involving 2,761 prisoners. Although the
random-effects pooled effect size was 0.50 (95% CI [0.34, 0.66]),
which would represent a medium effect (Cohen, 1977), after limiting
RCTs to those with active controls, the effect size was reduced to 0.21
(95% CI [0.01, 0.41]). This pattern was consistent for specific mental
health problems, such as depression, where there was the most evi-
dence.

Implications

There were four main implications. First, this review suggests that
RCTs of CBT and mindfulness-based therapies have shown moderate
evidence to improve depressive and anxiety symptoms in prisoners
where no preexisting treatments are in place, with mindfulness-based
therapies possibly demonstrating higher effect sizes. The mechanisms
underlying such treatment efficacy need exploration (van der Velden
et al., 2015). Second, trauma-based therapies demonstrated limited
evidence of effect on trauma symptomology. Although the difference
between types of therapy was not statistically significant, both a visual
analysis and a subgroup analysis of trauma symptom outcomes were
consistently lower than other mental health problems such as depres-
sion or anxiety. Improving trauma-based treatments should be prior-
itized given the high prevalence of PTSD in prisons (4 –21%; Goff et
al., 2007). Prisoners not only arrive with high levels of existing trauma
symptoms, but also are prone to traumatic experiences in prison.
Therefore, future research should take into account repeat traumas
while in prison in the treatment delivery and assessment of outcomes.
In contrast, we reported that trauma-based symptoms were reduced
after psychological treatments in prisoners, but this was in trials using
all therapeutic approaches, not only trauma-based ones. This suggests
that reducing trauma symptoms in prisoners may benefit from im-
proving psychological treatments more widely rather than introducing
specific types of therapy. Third, it was difficult to come to conclusions
about action-oriented approaches (such as art and music therapy)
because of the lack of research and the difficulty in interpreting
pooled estimates based on different treatments. These methods are not
widely available to prisoners but may provide alternatives for those
not interested in current treatments and be more cost-effective (Bil-
derbeck et al., 2013), partly because they are more accessible and less
stigmatizing for male prisoners than other psychosocial treatments
(Byrne, 2000). A final implication is based on the finding that par-
ticipation type (group vs. individual) did not significantly differ,
which suggests that group therapies could be considered as a baseline
psychological intervention if resources are limited—although these

will not be appropriate for acute illnesses. Caution is warranted in
interpreting the lack of significant difference in format of therapy as
there may be other explanations. For example, treatment dosage was
different—the average treatment length was 10 weeks for group
therapies, 6 weeks for individual therapies, and 12 weeks for combi-
nation ones (treatments comprised of weekly or biweekly sessions).
Most of the included trials involved short-term treatment with an
average length of 10 weeks. Providing short-term psychological ther-
apies can be efficient, particularly as the review found that the length
of treatment did not alter treatment effects. However, as the mainte-
nance of psychological gains was not found at 3 and 6 months, further
research is needed to clarify ways to retain short-term gains, and
consideration should be given to additional sessions after the ending
of a treatment program. In addition, future research should investigate
combined individual and group treatments.

Qualitative analysis of difficulties in conducting RCTs in pris-
ons suggested that many obstacles would not be overcome by
improving research design as many were secondary to structural
factors (such as following up prisoners and scheduling treatments)
in conducting research in prisons. The early involvement of the
relevant custodial staff and departments in the research design and
plans for implementation may address these problems.

We identified shortcomings in trial design in many of the included
RCTs. Small samples in particular could be overcome by multicenter
trials (Bilderbeck et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016; Sleed et al., 2013;
Wolff et al., 2015). In multisite trials, adherence to the study protocol
must be thoroughly checked to ensure that the results are comparable
in different sites. In addition, few studies utilized a fidelity measure to
ensure consistent quality and delivery of treatment (Bond, Evans,
Salyers, Williams, & Kim, 2000). We found that the presence of a
fidelity measure was associated with lower effect sizes, possibly
because of its association with implementing more stringent study
conditions, and thus less prone to bias such as lack of blinding.

Prison populations exhibit high levels of psychopathology but
also have elevated levels of comorbidity including personality
disorder and substance use. If research and treatment pathways fail
to take these comorbidities into account, any treatment approach
that focuses on a single diagnostic group may encounter difficul-
ties in identifying and interpreting the true clinical effect or may
exclude individuals with notable health and social needs. For
example, a pilot scheme in England extending a community ser-
vice into prison (IAPT) identified that limiting the access for
prisoners with more complex presentations excluded high need
persons (Forrester, MacLennan, Slade, Brown, & Exworthy,
2014). The provision of more specialist and targeted services
should, however, continue to be considered for acute cases and
those who do not respond to available treatment approaches. A
more joined-up approach between the offending and health path-
ways may be warranted. Many jurisdictions provide large-scale
psychological treatment programs that address offending needs,
including in relation to emotional management. These programs
have successfully run for decades and although their impact on
mental health is uncertain, future research on broader psycholog-
ical outcomes could be considered.

Comparisons

Evidence comparing psychological and pharmacological treat-
ments for prisoners is lacking as we did not identify head to head

in the community that appear

trials. In community settings, however, the overall effect sizes for
symptom reduction with antidepressants (0.38, 95% CI [0.34,
0.41]) and antipsychotics (0.51, 95% CI [0.43, 0.59]) are reported
to be at comparable levels to the psychological therapies reported
here (Leucht, Helfer, Gartlehner, & Davis, 2015). Although treat-
ment effects were not sustained at 3-month and 6-month follow-up
for studies that examined longer term outcomes in this review, this
contrasts with trials of antidepressants and antipsychotics for acute
treatment
to be sustained at
follow-up (e.g., for antidepressants at 12 weeks: ES (cid:2) 0.34, 95%
CI [0.25, 0.43] and at 24 weeks: ES (cid:2) 0.34, 95% CI [0.18, 0.50];
for antipsychotics, one review of 12 month outcomes reported risk
ratios of 0.40, 95% CI [0.33, 0.49]; Henssler, Kurschus, Franklin,
Bschor, & Baethge, 2017; Leucht et al., 2012) although informa-
tion on longer term effects of medication are limited to observa-
tional studies in prisoners (Chang, Lichtenstein, Langstrom,
Larsson, & Fazel, 2016), and comparisons will need to take into
account the differential adherence patterns between psychotropic
treatments. A recent review of
medication and psychological
mostly CBT, disorder-specific psychotherapies, and psychody-
namic approaches reported an effect size of 0.58 (Huhn et al.,
2014), similar to our pooled estimate of 0.50. Community-based
trials have also found that studies with no treatment/waitlist con-
trols have higher effect sizes than subgroups with more active
controls (such as those receiving placebo, treatment as usual, and
noneffective therapy; Huhn et al., 2014). This supports the view
that active treatment controls are likely to have better posttreat-
ment outcomes than the no treatment/waitlist controls because of
placebo or other nonspecific benefits from the intervention offered
to the control group. Finally, the current review did not show clear
differences in participation format (individual vs. group), similar
to community studies (Gaudiano & Miller, 2013).

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis
of all psychological therapies for prisoners. It includes 37 trials,
and larger than a previous review of 15 investigations (Morgan et
al., 2012), although the latter was focused on prisoners with
dichotomous diagnoses. The current review also provides a more
conservative estimate of effect (ES (cid:2) 0.50) than the 2012 review
(ES (cid:2) 0.87), likely because of a larger number of included studies.
On the other hand, some limitations need to be considered.
Double-blinding is difficult for psychological treatment studies
(Huhn et al., 2014). Lack of blinding can favorably bias treatment
and imperfect blinding has been a commonly identified issue in
other meta-analyses of psychotherapy studies (Gold, Voracek, &
Wigram, 2004; Huhn et al., 2014; Sensky, 2005). In addition, there
were 8 studies that did not employ intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses
(ES (cid:2) 0.58, 95% CI [0.14, 1.01]), which might favorably bias the
treatment group if noncompleters report lower treatment effects,
and these were not different to those that used ITT analyses (ES (cid:2)
0.46, 95% CI [0.29, 0.63]. A further related limitation were the
analytic strategies employed. Apart from one trial (Johnson &
Zlotnick, 2012), studies did not use analysis of covariance (AN-
COVA) when reporting posttreatment outcomes; using pretreat-
ment scores as a covariate in comparing posttreatment scores
would yield a more precise effect size estimate (Higgins, 2011).
Apart from four investigations (Ford et al., 2013; Wolff et al.,

2015; Zlotnick, 2002; Zlotnick, Johnson, & Najavits, 2009), stud-
ies included in the review relied on self-report measures for
outcomes (Ahrens & Rexford, 2002; Bradley & Follingstad, 2003;
Loper & Tuerk, 2011; Rohde, Jorgensen, Seeley, & Mace, 2004;
Sumter et al., 2009; Wilson, 1990). However, these are appropriate
for many psychological trials; clinical interviews that only check
for presence or absence of a formal diagnosis may not be sensitive
to treatment change, and many trials did not require a baseline
diagnosis. Nevertheless, some triangulation of outcomes (with
clinical and possible biological markers) should be considered in
future work. Furthermore, outcomes of specific disorders were not
examined as a subgroup analysis in this review because of the
limited number of studies that required participants to have a
clinical diagnosis. Future work could consider recruiting prisoners
with certain diagnoses, particularly severe mental disorders that
are overrepresented in custodial populations and whose outcomes
are worse than other prisoners. The shortage of empirically tested
treatments targeting specific psychological diagnoses in prisoners
seems to be largely a result of structural factors such as the
institutional constraints of prison settings discussed in the thematic
analysis in this review (see also Appendix E). However,
the
fundamental purpose of prisons is not the care and treatment of
those with severe mental illness and the emphasis in many juris-
dictions is on transferring them to secure hospitals in order to
access the full range of appropriate care and treatment within an
explicitly therapeutic environment. The interventions that prison-
ers may access in secure hospitals were not included in the review.
We reported high levels of heterogeneity and our overall effect size
should be interpreted with caution. High levels of heterogeneity are
not unusual for meta-analyses of RCTs, and partly reflect the diverse
populations being studied (Higgins et al., 2003). We addressed this
partly by conducting a number of subgroup analyses (by comparator,
treatment type, and outcome) and multivariable metaregression on a
range of prespecified characteristics. For example, metaregression
analyses indicated that higher attrition rates were correlated with
higher effect sizes (both univariately in all studies and also in a
multivariable analysis for waitlist control studies). In studies that did
not complete the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, one explanation is
that participants who drop out do not complete all the treatment
components, and are therefore less likely to benefit. It may also be in
part attributed to other factors that have been shown to correlate with
treatment dropouts such as format of treatment delivery (e.g., in-
person v. self-guided) or number of sessions (Fernandez, Salem,
Swift, & Ramtahal, 2015). Furthermore, the finding that retention rate
and sample size were significantly associated with between-study
heterogeneity in waitlist control studies but not in active treatment
controls supports the view that the contribution of such factors is not
as strong as it is in better designed studies. In addition, heterogeneity
was not high in some of these subgroups such as trials with no
treatment controls and those with trauma outcomes. Subgroup and
metaregression analyses are potentially informative as they identified
some consistent explanations for the variations between studies,
which can be used to conduct and interpret future treatment trials in
prisoners. However, for some subgroups such as ‘other’ therapies that
included a wide range of treatments, clinical heterogeneity means that
the pooled effect size should be interpreted with considerable caution.
Other limitations of the review include that the metaregression was
based on study characteristics that were reported, and there will be
other explanations that we were unable to test, such as environmental

792

factors (prison-related conditions, attitudes of correctional staff and
other prisoners). The alternative—a systematic review without a
meta-analysis—was considered and the information in this review
allows for groups of similarly conducted studies to be reviewed.
Moreover, we incorporated a qualitative analysis of the barriers to
psychological trials in prisons. At the same time, as we have con-
ducted two complementary analyses of heterogeneity, this review is
more than simply a presentation of pooled estimates.

In addition, another limitation is that we examined outcomes
using continuous symptom scores rather than categorical diagno-
ses, which meant they were more sensitive to change, and included
prisoners without diagnoses at baseline. The alternative—to inves-
tigate changes to diagnoses—may be easier to interpret and assist
in planning services, but was not feasible due to the lack of
relevant studies, and future studies could consider including both
continuous and categorical outcomes.

Conclusion

We found that psychological therapies for mental health outcomes
in prisoners were modestly effective when there are no existing
psychological treatment programs. However, effects were weaker
when active treatment controls and a fidelity measure were used in
trials. Whether this level of evidence is sufficiently strong for the
introduction of such therapies in prison requires careful review and
consideration of other factors including cost-effectiveness.

The study addresses an appropriate and clearly focused question.

1.2

1.3

1.4

1.5

1.6

1.7

1.8

1.9

The assignment of subjects to treatment groups is randomized.

An adequate concealment method is used.

Subjects and investigators are kept ‘blind’ about treatment allocation.

The treatment and control groups are similar at the start of the trial.

The only difference between groups is the treatment under investigation.

All relevant outcomes are measured in a standard, valid and reliable way.

What percentage of the individuals or clusters recruited into each treatment arm of the

study dropped out before the study was completed?

All the subjects are analyzed in the groups to which they were randomly allocated

(often referred to as intention-to-treat analysis).

1.10

Where the study is carried out at more than one site, results are comparable for all sites.

Additional Qualitative Research Findings

Theme 1: Sample Size

Limitations included small sample sizes (Cole, Sarlund-Heinrich, & Brown, 2007; Ford et al., 2013; Gussak, 2007; Johnson & Zlotnick,
2012; Lanza et al., 2014; Perkins, 1998; Wilson, 1990; Zlotnick, 2002) as a result of difficulty in participant recruitment (Cole et al., 2007;
Pardini et al., 2014), and in one juvenile study, parental non-consent (Mitchell et al., 2011).

Theme 2: Follow-Up Difficulties

One author commented that a combination of small sample, volunteer participants, and time constraints prevented the collection of
post-test follow-up measures (Cole et al., 2007). Non-attendance after release (Mitchell et al., 2011) and short treatment period (Perkins,
1998) were related limitations as a longer period may have been needed to better capture the treatment effects.

Theme 3: Environmental Constraints

Control group participants were more likely to drop out of a study (Zlotnick, 2002), and one author commented that establishment
disruptiveness may have increased the attrition rate (Gussak, 2009). Potential contamination of treatment and control conditions was
suspected due to the closed communal setting of the prison wing (Zlotnick, Johnson, & Najavits, 2009). Reliance on self-report measures
was also repeatedly identified as a problem (Ahrens & Rexford, 2002; Bradley & Follingstad, 2003; Loper & Tuerk, 2011; Rohde et al.,
2004; Sumter, Monk-Turner, & Turner, 2009; Wilson, 1990). One study mentioned the possibility that “inmates wanted to ‘fake good’
in order to be considered for parole or placement evaluation,” even though the authors believed it unlikely (Bradley & Follingstad, 2003).
Not being able to blind the participants to treatment condition (Rohde et al., 2004) was a further constraint on the study validity. Finally,
in some cases, the prison clinical staff were not expected to be able to re-produce the conditions of safety and confidentiality provided
by the treatment facilitators in the study (Wolff et al., 2015).
