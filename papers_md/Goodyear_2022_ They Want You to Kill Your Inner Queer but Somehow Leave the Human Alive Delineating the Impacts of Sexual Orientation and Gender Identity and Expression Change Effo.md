Abstract

Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression change efforts (SOGIECE) aim to 
suppress the sexual and gender identities of Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and other 
queer (2SLGBTQ+) people. Exposure to SOGIECE is associated with significant psychosocial 
morbidity. Yet, there is a dearth of knowledge specifying the ways in which these psychosocial 
impacts are produced and experienced. This qualitative interpretive description study aims to 
delineate the impacts of SOGIECE. To do so, we thematically analyzed data from in-depth 
interviews, conducted between January and July 2020, with 22 people with lived experience of 
SOGIECE. Study participants indicated that feelings of shame and brokenness related to their 
sexual and gender identities were deeply implicated in and shaped by experiences with SOGIECE. 
SOGIECE also had socially isolating effects, which had restricted participants’ opportunities for 
meaningful connection with others, including romantic partners and 2SLGBTQ+ communities. 
Further, SOGIECE had contributed to experiences of profound emotional distress, mental illness 
(e.g., anxiety, depression), and suicidality. These findings underscore the need for several 
responsive policy and programmatic interventions, including legislation to prevent SOGIECE,

Introduction

In Canada and internationally, communities of Two-Spirit1, lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and other queer (2SLGBTQ+) people and allies have rallied together in long 
and hard-fought movements to be recognized, accepted, and celebrated in society (Mulé et 
al., 2009; Pruden & Salway, 2020; Smith, 1999; Warner, 2002). Yet, 2SLGBTQ+ people 
continue to experience significant systemic oppression, including stigma, discrimination 
and violence (Mulé, 2015). This oppression is particularly evident in the historical and 
continued occurrence of sexual orientation and gender identity and expression change 
efforts (SOGIECE), commonly referred to as “conversion therapy” and “reparative therapy.” 
SOGIECE constitute a variety of practices that aim to deny or suppress feelings and 
desires related to non-heterosexual identities, as well as expressions of gender and gender 
identities that differ from one’s sex assigned at birth (Salway, 2020a; Shidlo et al., 2001). 
SOGIECE are known to contribute to significant psychosocial harms, including mental 
health morbidity. For example, recent national surveys of 2SLGBTQ+ people in Canada and 
the United States have indicated that exposure to SOGIECE is associated with loneliness, 
regular illicit drug use, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide (Salway et al., 2020; 
Turban, Beckwith, et al., 2019). Despite these well-documented harms, SOGIECE remain 
critically under addressed in public health research and policy spheres and continue to 
occur internationally – affecting an estimated 3–18% of 2SLGBTQ+ people, according to 
population-level surveys in the United States and Canada (Green et al., 2020; Mallory et al., 
2019; Meanley et al., 2019; Caitlin Ryan et al., 2020; Salway et al., 2020; Trans PULSE 
Canada, 2019; Turban, Beckwith, et al., 2019; Turban, King, et al., 2019).

SOGIECE became more pervasive in North America following the American Psychiatric 
Association’s removal of homosexuality as a mental disorder from its 1973 edition of 
its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Shidlo et al., 2001). This 
institutional change, alongside improving societal attitudes and discourses related to 
gender and sexuality, signaled important advancements in 2SLGBTQ+ people’s rights and 
recognition. However, reforms such as these also incited and catalyzed efforts to scale 
up SOGIECE across a variety of contexts (e.g., faith-based, healthcare; from unregulated 
counsellors) (Salway et al., 2020; Shidlo et al., 2001). SOGIECE were initially promoted 
under the guise of interventions that could suppress or repress same-sex attraction, 
but they are also often targeted toward denying and/or subduing gender identities and 
expressions that do not align with one’s sex assigned at birth (Byne, 2016; Minister of 

1Two-Spirit” is an umbrella term and community organizing tool intended to encapsulate a range of diverse Indigenous genders and 
sexualities (Pruden & Salway, 2020). There is no singular definition of this term, as its use varies among Indigenous Peoples.

Justice, 2020). These efforts, regardless of their forms and “targets,” both stem from and 
assert the erroneous ideology that being queer and/or transgender (trans) is fundamentally 
incompatible with leading a healthy and fulfilling life (Salway, 2020b).

SOGIECE draw on a number of ineffective and discredited techniques, including aversion 
therapies (e.g., electric shock), psychodynamic therapies (i.e., which intend to identify and 
address the perceived etiology of one’s sexuality and/or gender, such as overbearing or 
distant parent and sibling relationships), biomedical and clinical practices (e.g., hormonal 
treatments, denial of gender-affirming care and surgeries), and religious and spiritual 
practices (e.g., guided prayer, Bible reading, exorcisms) (Salway et al., 2020; Shidlo et 
al., 2001). Forms of SOGIECE also vary in intensity and scope. And, while SOGIECE 
are directly related to and constitutive of more organized and sustained sexual and gender 
identity suppression efforts (e.g., “conversion therapy”), SOGIECE may also include 
practices that are less well defined, advertised, and/or sustained (Salway, 2020a). At present, 
data are lacking on the precise settings, scale, and manners in which SOGIECE are 
conducted. Nonetheless, we do know that experiences of SOGIECE are ongoing and highly 
prevalent among 2SLGBTQ+ people (Green et al., 2020; Mallory et al., 2019; Meanley 
et al., 2019; Caitlin Ryan et al., 2020; Salway et al., 2020; Trans PULSE Canada, 2019; 
Turban, Beckwith, et al., 2019; Turban, King, et al., 2019).

Public awareness of and response to the continued occurrence of SOGIECE in Canada and 
internationally has tended to lag behind scientific research into its prevalence and impacts 
(Salway et al., 2019). Indeed, a recent international report (Bishop, 2019) detailed that 
SOGIECE continue to occur nearly everywhere in the world; yet, only five countries – 
Brazil, Ecuador, Malta, Taiwan, and Germany – have national conversion therapy bans in 
place (Bishop, 2019; OutRight Action International, 2020). Fortunately, enhanced efforts 
to ban conversion therapy are presently underway in many countries and sub-national 
jurisdictions (Bishop, 2019). For example, in Canada, four of the country’s 13 provinces 
and territories and several additional municipalities have banned conversion therapy 
(d’Entremont, 2020), and there are ongoing efforts to introduce a national ban through 
amendments to Canada’s Criminal Code (Department of Justice Canada, 2020). In tandem 
with such efforts, however, is a critical need to identify and implement strategies for 
supporting the health and wellbeing of people who have experienced and/or who are still 
experiencing SOGIECE.

Few studies have undertaken in-depth investigation into how SOGIECE may impact mental 
health and social wellbeing. The available qualitative evidence related to SOGIECE is 
largely focused on the United States context (Flentje et al., 2014; Johnston & Jenkins, 2006; 
Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002), but nonetheless suggests that people who have experienced 
SOGIECE tend to view these practices as ineffective and harmful. These studies identified 
that a minority of people find some benefit in SOGIECE, such as finding connection and 
support with peers in similar situations (Flentje et al., 2014; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002), but 
that these benefits are vastly outweighed by the harmful aspects of SOGIECE, including 
experiences of shame, self-loathing, and deterioration in mental health (Flentje et al., 2014; 
Johnston & Jenkins, 2006; Shidlo & Schroeder, 2002). Still, less is known about the distinct 
ways in which these harms are produced and experienced – a prudent knowledge gap,

given that SOGIECE continue to occur across the globe. Action-oriented and community-
led research efforts that center people with lived experience are needed to fill existing 
knowledge gaps and, ultimately, to redress the harms of SOGIECE. The aim of this study 
is therefore to delineate the emotional, social, and mental health impacts associated with 
SOGIECE, as well as the significance and meaning ascribed to these impacts, as described 
by people with lived experience.

Method

Positionality

We approach this study as public health researchers and clinicians (e.g., nursing, social 
work), and also as people with lived experience of being queer and/or of allyship to 
2SLGBTQ+ communities. It is from this liminal standpoint that we hold the evidence- 
and equity-informed assumption that SOGIECE are fundamentally harmful, though we 
recognize this stance may be counter to the experiences and perspectives of others. It 
also from this standpoint that we seek to foster health equity by accentuating the adverse 
impacts of SOGIECE, and, responsively, to identify strategies for promoting equitable 
health, healthcare, and social wellbeing for people who have experienced SOGIECE. We 
aim to do so by drawing on the knowledge and resilience of a sample of 2SLGBTQ+ people 
with lived experience of SOGIECE, which we seek to mobilize into critical public health 
action through our own research activities, interpretations, and data-driven and community-
informed policy and programmatic recommendations.

Study overview

This qualitative study was guided by interpretive description, an inductive and pragmatic 
methodology for constructing and synthesizing practice-oriented findings (Thorne, 2016). 
Interpretive description approaches are well suited to developing an understanding of what 
should occur to advance policy and practice within situation- or phenomenon-specific 
healthcare contexts (Thorne, 2016). This study draws on interpretive description to first 
elucidate a nuanced understanding of the impacts of SOGIECE described by those who have 
experienced it firsthand, and, second, to draw from these interpretations to identify priorities 
for improving health policy and practice within this substantive context. We also draw 
on a social constructivist epistemology (Charmaz, 2014; Weaver & Olson, 2006), which 
enables us to provide rich descriptions of these impacts while preserving the complexity 
of the social contexts in which they occur. This paradigmatic approach facilitates a more 
fulsome exploration of the social meaning participants ascribe to the impacts of SOGIECE, 
the social conditions and processes through which these impacts unfold (e.g., when, how, 
with whom, to what effect), and the socio-political and subjective contexts in which we, as 
researchers, situate and interpret these impacts. Here, we also employ a critical theoretical 
framework underpinned by values of health equity and social justice (Browne & Reimer-
Kirkham, 2014; Varcoe et al., 2014) to direct attention to the structurally embedded nature of 
SOGIECE. It is through this lens that we view SOGIECE as a product of societal inequities 
(e.g., queerphobia, stigma, violence) facing 2SLGBTQ+ people, and, further, that we seek to 
interpret the impacts of SOGIECE within the structural contexts of participants’ lives (e.g., 
related to: community belonging, employment, health and healthcare access).

Sampling and recruitment procedures

We purposively sampled (Palinkas et al., 2015) 2SLGBTQ+ people with lived experience of 
SOGIECE to obtain a comprehensive and multifaceted account of the impacts associated 
with these practices. Study participants were recruited from across Canada through 
advertisements shared via community and research partner social media posts. We engaged 
partner organizations (e.g., Generous Space, Community-Based Research Centre) with 
specific foci and/or service-user demographics to share our study advertisements, with a 
view to both facilitate recruitment and maximize the gender, sexual orientation, and racial/
ethnic diversity of participants with lived experience of SOGIECE. It is noteworthy that 
our recruitment strategies and study advertisements reflected our research team’s stance that 
SOGIECE are harmful; for example, our advertisements indicated our desire to hear from 
“survivors” of SOGIECE. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were 19 years of 
age and older, lived in Canada, spoke and understood English or French, and had directly 
experienced SOGIECE at any time in their life.

All participants provided informed consent prior to data collection activities. Participants 
were remunerated with a CDN $50 honorarium. Approval for this study was obtained 
from Research Ethics Boards at Simon Fraser University (#2019s0394) and Université de 
Montréal (#CERSES-20–048-D).

Data collection

Between January 31 and July 29, 2020, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews 
that lasted 60–120 minutes each. Participants also completed a 13-item socio-demographic 
questionnaire. We held a subset of interviews in person at our research offices in Vancouver 
and Toronto, though most interviews were conducted remotely using audiovisual platforms 
(e.g., Skype, Zoom). Interview questions were designed to elicit rich and comprehensive 
discussions of participants’ perspectives, experiences, and contexts of SOGIECE. We 
approached the interviews with a sense of openness and flexibility, including when we asked 
participants to describe any health and social impacts they attributed to SOGIECE. Here, the 
primary interview question underpinning the current analysis was: “How do you feel your 
experience with SOGIECE has affected you?” As participants responded to this question, 
they were encouraged to elaborate on the ways in which SOGIECE may have affected 
their relationships with various people and communities in their lives, including their 
biological families, faith-based communities, 2SLGBTQ+ communities, and romantic and 
sexual partners. Likewise, participants were prompted to describe how various social and 
contextual features of their lives (e.g. relationships, health and social service engagement, 
employment, moving and other life transitions) influenced their experiences before, during, 
and following SOGIECE. Reflexive field notes were completed following each interview.

Sample demographics

We recruited a diverse sample (Table 1) of 22 participants who ranged from 20 to 64 
years of age. Participants lived across Canada, including in the provinces of British 
Columbia (9.1%), Alberta (18.2%), Manitoba (4.6%), Ontario (45.5%), Quebec (18.2%), 
and New Brunswick (4.6%). In the socio-demographic surveys, participants identified as 
cisgender (77.3%), trans (18.2%), and – for one participant – “not sure” (4.6%). Participants

also reported a spectrum of gender identities, including man (77.3%), woman (18.2%), 
non-binary (13.6%), and/or genderfae (4.6%), with some participants reporting multiple 
and/or fluid gender identities (e.g., one participant identified as both a woman and as a non-
binary person; another participant identified as non-binary, genderfae, and a woman). Most 
participants identified as gay (68.2%) or queer (22.7%), though participants also identified 
as bisexual, pansexual, and/or straight. One participant described his sexual identity as 
“attracted to men, but not gay.” One participant identified as Two-Spirit. Participants tended 
to describe having experienced SOGIECE within faith-based and/or healthcare contexts, 
with 72.7% of participants reporting that their experiences with SOGIECE had lasted 
more than one year. The majority (86.3%) of participants also indicated that they had first 
experienced SOGIECE in adolescence and/or as young adults (<30 years of age).

Data analysis

Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked for accuracy, and 
anonymized. We then organized and managed the transcripts using NVivo 12 software. Data 
analysis followed the logic of interpretive description (Thorne, 2016) in that our approach 
was iterative and oriented toward constructing findings that have implications for policy 
and practice. Our reflexive field notes and guiding analytic questions therein prompted 
intentional engagement with the data as they were being collected. Further, this field noting 
facilitated critical self-reflection into pertinent aspects of the interviews (e.g., emergent 
and unanswered questions, interviewer ruminations, novel and/or contrasting findings), 
which informed subsequent data collection and analysis, such as through the inclusion of 
additional interview questions and prompts. Preliminary data immersion and analysis also 
included reading and re-reading participant transcripts, and debriefing participant interviews 
at research team meetings. We matured our analysis by coding the data, which occurred 
nearly simultaneously with data collection, with some lag time for transcription. Here, three 
research team members open-coded an initial subset of the transcripts by organizing the 
data into patterns, creating substantive codes that reflected key aspects of the phenomena 
described by study participants (e.g., “mental health,” “identity,” “shame”), and discussing 
and reconciling the codes used, including through debriefing processes with the broader 
research team. Remaining transcripts were coded thereafter.

The analysis drew on social constructivist techniques used within interpretive description 
and grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014; Thorne, 2016) to gradually transform the coded 
data into thematic findings. This process included a series of inductive strategies, including 
collapsing our codes, reflecting on our study research questions, returning to the data 
for nuance and context, engaging with relevant empirical and theoretical literature, and 
revisiting the content and questions posed in our field notes. We also engaged with the 
following guiding analytic questions to focus and refine the analysis: (i) How do participants 
describe the impacts of having experienced SOGIECE? (ii) In what ways are the impacts 
of SOGIECE differentially characterized across and within participants’ stories (e.g., 
immediacy, duration, and severity of impacts)? (iii) How do SOGIECE and their impacts 
interact with the social contexts of participants’ lives? This focused engagement with the 
data supported us to further synthesize and construct the findings into central themes. Below, 
we summarize our findings holistically and subsequently provide an in-depth presentation of

Results

The deleterious emotional, social, and mental health impacts of SOGIECE

The way participants perceived and described the impacts of SOGEICE can be divided into 
three interconnected themes: (i) feelings of brokenness and wanting to be whole, (ii) social 
and relational consequences, and (iii) impacts on mental health and wellbeing. We describe 
these themes sequentially; however, movement through and between them is intended to be 
nonlinear, given their interconnectedness. First, participants described how SOGIECE had 
reinforced feelings of brokenness and wanting to be whole, which, for many participants, 
contributed to challenging starts to their adult lives. Second, participants described how 
life within non-affirming contexts of SOGIECE had precipitated significant social and 
relational hardships, including, in particular, social isolation and challenges connecting 
to others (e.g., romantic and sexual partners, 2SLGBTQ+ communities, families). Third, 
participants described how SOGIECE had been particularly harmful with respect to mental 
health and wellbeing, including through reinforcing feelings of guilt and shame related to 
one’s sexual and gender identities. Here, participants indicated that the profound mental 
health consequences of SOGIECE, including suicidality and debilitating mental illnesses 
(e.g., depression, anxiety), had been long-lasting and, in many cases, were still present. 
Taken together, it is our interpretation that the impacts of SOGIECE are predominantly 
negative and severe, to a point of being life threatening.

It is noteworthy that only one participant in this sample described their experience 
with SOGIECE favourably. Whereas this participant described himself as a “conversion 
therapy thriver,” due to the perceived support and religious affirmation he received during 
SOGIECE, all other participants characterized SOGIECE as ineffective and detrimental to 
their mental health and social wellbeing. This outlier participant also indicated that his 
experience with SOGIECE had not been “effective,” as he still experiences “same-sex 
attraction” but fills this desire with his religious faith. This participant nonetheless described 
being staunchly supportive of SOGIECE, particularly with regard to an individual’s right to 
choose whether or not to attend SOGIECE. Given the unique disposition of this participant, 
and the research questions posed, we have excluded this data from the present analysis, 
while acknowledging that his experience and those of other “conversion therapy thrivers” 
may merit a separate investigation.

Feelings of brokenness and wanting to be whole: “Something wrong that needs to be 
fixed”

Participants in this study described having experienced various “types” of SOGIECE, 
including formalized individual and group counselling sessions (e.g., with faith leaders 
and/or healthcare providers; at conversion therapy camps and/or retreats), other faith-
based practices (e.g., guided prayer sessions, exorcisms), and more general experiences 
of queerphobia in which participants were pressured to repress their sexual and gender 
identities. Taken together, participants described how SOGIECE had induced feelings of

shame and confusion related to their sexual and gender identities – feelings that, in many 
cases, participants indicated were ongoing. Participants further described how SOGIECE 
had caused them to feel inferior or “broken” because of their non-normative sexual and 
gender identities. Participants often described how, even before they had experienced 
SOGIECE, the process of coming to understand and accept their sexual and gender identities 
had been both challenging and distressing – particularly, for participants who had grown 
up in highly cisheterosexist and non-affirming contexts. Regardless of when participants’ 
“struggles” began and the intensity of cisheterosexist messaging they had encountered 
in their early lives, SOGIECE were described as having greatly exacerbated feelings of 
distress. As one participant described:

[Growing up], the single message that I kept tucked away in my soul, I guess, was 
that I was broken and needed to be made complete and whole. So, then of course, 
as long as I am having gay thoughts, I’m still broken. [SOGIECE] doesn’t do a 
lot for one’s self-image, one’s recognition, it doesn’t do much even for a person’s 
understanding of being a Christian (60- to 64-year-old man who identifies as gay).

Participants also described how SOGIECE had been deeply detrimental to their self-
image and self-esteem, as illustrated in above quotation. Here, participants described how 
SOGIECE practitioners (e.g., healthcare providers, faith leaders) had consistently told them 
that their sexual and gender identities were incompatible with the norms, values, and 
expectations of the communities in which they lived. This sort of messaging throughout 
participants’ experiences with SOGIECE was described as exceedingly harmful in that it 
had precipitated intense feelings of confusion and isolation. Often, participants described 
how SOGIECE had sparked feelings of being “damaged” and like an “outsider.” Participants 
often juxtaposed this SOGIECE-induced dysphoric mindset with the sexual and gender 
identity-related affirmation and “healing” they had hoped to secure. For instance, one 
participant described how:

[I had] that concern within me, that what I’m feeling is wrong, I’m broken, and 
this needs to be healed. […] But, [I was] never really getting any resolution [in 
SOGIECE]. It just created more turmoil within me (40- to 49-year-old person who 
identifies as queer, gay, non-binary, and a woman).

Participants offered rich descriptions of the ways in which SOGIECE had aggravated 
feelings of inner turmoil and “brokenness”. Here, participants described having held the 
belief that there was something fundamentally “wrong” with them – something they had 
been coerced into thinking was in need of repair for them to feel “whole.” Frequently, 
participants described how SOGIECE practitioners and organizations had positioned 
themselves as being capable of effectively supporting participants to subdue their sexual and 
gender identities. Many participants described feeling as though they had been given a sense 
of “false hope” because SOGIECE had not, in fact, been “helpful;” rather, SOGIECE were 
described as having been acutely damaging with respect to overall health and wellbeing. In 
this regard, one participant offered:

[What] really stuck out to me is this idea, not necessarily about solely sexual 
orientation, or gender identity, or those things, but about this idea that you are 
teaching a person that there is something wrong with them that needs to be fixed.

And that the [SOGIECE] therapist is the one who can do that (30- to 39-year-old 
woman who identifies as bisexual and trans).

Participants also described how SOGIECE had evoked intense feelings of shame and 
guilt, which further reinforced feelings of “brokenness.” Participants tended to describe 
a distinct sense of self-blame and regret over having “voluntarily” attended SOGIECE. 
Indeed, although participants described that SOGIECE necessitated some degree of support 
or coercion from outside influences (e.g., family members, healthcare providers, religious 
leaders, societal pressures), many nonetheless identified their own perceived role in 
attending SOGIECE as a particularly painful source of regret and injury. Here, participants 
often described having hoped that SOGIECE would help them to feel “whole” or “normal.” 
Yet, as participants elaborated, they described how SOGIECE had had the opposite effect in 
that these practices had only reinforced feelings of inferiority. One participant described the 
complex and lasting nature of the detrimental impacts associated with SOGIECE, including 
with regard to SOGIECE-related expectations and shortcomings:

I was very, very involved. I really wanted it [SOGIECE] to work, and I think that’s 
why it was so damaging for me, because I put everything I had into it… And I 
put all my hope and my belief into it, and moving away from that was also very 
difficult, because the shame and the guilt lingered for a very long time (20- to 
29-year-old non-binary person who identifies as queer).

Participants described the ways in which their experiences with SOGIECE had intersected 
with key transitional periods in their lives, including times in which they had been “coming 
out” (i.e., disclosing their sexual and gender identities to others) and, more generally, 
growing into adulthood and themselves (i.e., “coming in”). Here, participants described 
how certain SOGIECE-related harms, and periods of SOGIECE and harm, were more 
lasting and more difficult to remedy than others. Among participants who identified as 
trans, many described how SOGIECE generally, and denial of access to gender-affirming 
care (e.g., hormone replacement therapy) and surgeries specifically, had led to enduring 
physical consequences. Of note, a subset of participants described how being refused 
gender-affirming care during adolescence was particularly damaging, as this precipitated the 
development of unwanted and long-lasting physiological changes associated with puberty 
and the sex they had been assigned at birth. This description of how SOGIECE can result 
in a mismatch between participants’ physical bodies and their gender identities offers, quite 
literally, a poignant illustration of how these practices inhibit opportunities for participants 
to truly feel and be “whole.” In recounting having been compelled to undergo sex-related 
bodily changes that did not align with her gender identity and expression, one participant 
described:

I’d had this continued growth and this change, and that I had asked him [the 
psychiatrist] to stop this [puberty, through puberty-blocking medications], but he 
had refused to do so. And, this is honestly one of the hardest parts of the aftermath 
of the conversion therapy to deal with. And, the usual term I use is that I think of 
my body as a prison, because it was the conversion therapist’s deliberate inaction 
that forced me into a body that doesn’t fit me and that I’m going to be stuck in for 
the rest of my life (30- to 39-year-old woman who identifies as bisexual and trans).

Social and relational consequences: “Lost time” and “feeling unclean”

Participants described the ways in which SOGIECE had precipitated a series of unfavourable 
effects across their social contexts and interpersonal relationships. Pervasive experiences of 
having their identities discredited and suppressed through SOGIECE had led participants to 
experience social isolation and feelings of lack of belonging. Participants often described 
how this “outsiderness” had largely begun in early childhood and with their families and 
communities of origin, but was later amplified and/or solidified through their experiences 
with SOGIECE. As participants elaborated, many referenced the specific processes through 
which SOGIECE practitioners had endeavoured to suppress participants’ sexual and/or 
gender identities, including through the (mis)use of faith-based messaging that positioned 
religion and queerness as incompatible. This bombardment with anti-2SLGBTQ+ messaging 
was described by participants as having intensified pre-existing feelings of loneliness and 
lack of belonging. In describing this sense of disconnect and “othering,” one participant 
offered this analogy:

I always identified with those [biblical] characters that had leprosy, because they 
were left out on the fringe of town, they weren’t allowed to touch anyone, they 
weren’t allowed to get close to anyone. And, if they did go into town, they had to 
announce that they were unclean the whole time that they were there, and I always 
felt that that was a powerful metaphor (40- to 49-year-old man who identifies as 
bisexual).

Relatedly, participants described feeling as though SOGIECE had, to varying degrees, 
impaired their motivations and opportunities for social connection with 2SLGBTQ+ 
communities. Participants frequently described how SOGIECE-associated key messages 
that equated 2SLGBTQ+ identities with undesirable “lifestyles” or even “diseases” had 
undermined their capacity to meaningfully connect with other 2SLGBTQ+ people, despite 
their strong desire to do so. Here, participants tended to describe how internalized 
anti-2SLGBTQ+ sentiments – particularly, those reinforced through SOGIECE – had 
contributed to participants’ active rejection of 2SLGBTQ+ communities. Indeed, although 
the majority of participants described having eventually found meaningful connection with 
other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, they nonetheless described how affiliating themselves with 
2SLGBTQ+ communities and events (e.g., Pride, nightclubs, sport and other hobby groups) 
had, at times, precipitated intense feelings of shame, guilt, and fear. Participants further 
described how these adverse feelings had precipitated a sense of social isolation and 
disconnect from 2SLGBTQ+ communities, which was described as having persisted for 
years following SOGIECE, preventing participants from living full and authentic lives:

I’m just thinking of, I guess, the years I just spent in fear and not pursuing 
relationships. I remember having this vivid idea of, I guess, as this person who 
was very in the closet, I felt like I was standing at a door. There was a window in 
the door, there was this party going on, you know this LGBTQ party, and I’m just 
standing there at this door looking in and terrified to enter and, you know, there’s 
this party happening and I kind of want to go in but I’m terrified, and if I go in, it’s 
a slippery slope and am I on my way to hell in a handbasket, kind of a thing! So, all

those years I spent at that door looking in. (40- to 49-year-old man who identifies 
as gay).

Many participants elaborated that, as a result of SOGIECE, they experienced significant 
challenges initiating and sustaining romantic relationships. Non-heterosexual participants 
described how SOGIECE had suppressed and limited their opportunities to learn about and 
experiment with relationships that aligned with their sexual orientations. Often characterized 
within these descriptions were feelings of shame, fear, and concern related to the acceptance 
and outward display of participants’ queer sexualities. SOGIECE deeply accentuated these 
emotions, as one participant described:

I find it difficult, particularly in my relationship with my partner, I think, to be open 
and honest and communicate what my [sexual and romantic] preferences are, in 
certain ways, because I don’t know what they are! I feel like conversion therapy 
basically said what I want or desire should not be engaged in, like, you shouldn’t 
do that, like, you have the same-sex attraction but you should not go forward 
in that. That needs to be repressed in some way (40- to 49-year-old person who 
identifies as queer, gay, non-binary, and a woman).

Amidst these descriptions, participants highlighted that, after having been exposed to 
SOGIECE, sexual activity could sometimes be challenging and emotionally triggering. 
Participants described instances in which sexual and intimate encounters following 
SOGIECE were tainted by the unwelcome provocation of strong, SOGIECE-driven feelings 
of guilt and shame. This emotional distress was characterized as having stemmed from the 
negative and sexually repressive messages to which participants were repeatedly exposed in 
SOGIECE. As one participant explained:

The last boyfriend that I had, he cried a lot when I told him about it [my experience 
with SOGIECE], right. But then, when I was like, “No, we can’t like fool around 
tonight,” or, “I can’t let you like give me a blowjob tonight, because I can’t deal 
with what will happen to me mentally afterwards,” that’s different. So, it’s one 
thing to know that like the person that you love, from their perspective, has gone 
through this. It’s another thing to have it impact you in the bedroom. (40- to 
49-year-old man who identifies as gay).

More generally, participants tended to describe an opportunity cost in which they had 
experienced “lost time” as a result of experiences with SOGIECE and therefore had 
fewer opportunities to pursue romantic relationships. Amidst these descriptions, participants 
frequently referred to the ways in which SOGIECE had pressured them to repress their 
sexual and gender identities, which, in many cases, included an emphasis on abstaining 
from “same-sex” relationships and sexual activities. Many participants described how this 
repression of sexual and relational desires had persisted internally for years after exposure 
to SOGIECE. At the time of our interviews, participants even described an apprehensiveness 
that they may not be “successful” in terms of pursuing and settling into supportive, 
romantic partnerships in the years ahead. Characterized within these descriptions was 
a sense that, after extensive exposure to anti-2SLGBTQ+ messaging during SOGIECE, 
some participants went on to perceive themselves as too ashamed, afraid, and/or “broken” 
to become romantically involved with others. These relational barriers tended to surface

amid participants’ descriptions of their relationship-related hopes and goals, wherein many 
participants also perceived romantic partnerships to be fundamental to realizing life quality 
and fulfillment. Here, the prospect of continued experiences of loneliness and social and 
romantic isolation following SOGIECE was described as particularly disheartening. When 
asked about his hopes and plans for the future, one participant described:

[I worry that], in later age, I would be alone, miserable, and there will be no 
one here to look after [me]. So, these consequences, these repercussions, or the 
period of time as I get older, [they] haunt me most of the time, you know? (40- to 
49-year-old man who identifies as gay).

Impacts on mental health and wellbeing: “A very dark period in my life”

Participants offered rich descriptions of the ways in which SOGIECE had negatively 
impacted their mental health and wellbeing. Characterized within these descriptions was 
a common perception that one’s overall sense of self, including with regard to core beliefs 
and identities targeted by SOGIECE, is intricately connected with how one experiences 
health and quality of life. Thus, while SOGIECE were described as having been targeted 
toward “fixing” various aspects of participants’ sexual and gender identities (e.g., romantic 
attraction, sexual desires, gender identity and expression), such efforts were also perceived 
to have had tangible and deleterious health impacts, particularly in relation to mental 
wellbeing. In drawing attention to the intersection between SOGIECE and health, one 
participant succinctly described:

It ties into that [belief], like, how basically this sin in your life was what Christ had 
to die for. And that’s why you have to die to this sin, and so you basically have to 
kill it in you. Like, they want you to kill your inner queer but somehow leave the 
human alive! (40- to 49-year-old man who identifies as bisexual).

Participants described how claims related to the effectiveness of SOGIECE, as well 
as the tactics and approaches used in SOGIECE themselves, had instilled feelings of 
inadequacy and a sense of personal failure (implied by the above participant’s assertation 
that SOGIECE practitioners put the onus on the individual to “kill [their] inner queer”) that 
were greatly distressing. Many participants further described feeling as though they were 
a disappointment to others (e.g., family members, faith-based communities), whom they 
perceived to be “letting down” as a result of their sexual and gender identities, and also due 
to ceasing attendance in or not being “successful” (i.e., at subduing their sexual and gender 
identities) in SOGIECE. Here, participants described how SOGIECE-reinforced perceptions 
of being a “failure” and/or “broken” (i.e., because of their sexual and gender identities) had 
deleteriously impacted their self-esteem, self-confidence, and overall mental wellbeing. In 
underscoring the emotional hurt caused by efforts to suppress his sexual orientation, one 
participant described:

It makes you feel like so much more of a failure. It’s like, oh, other people could do 
it, they prayed hard enough, why can’t I pray hard enough? (20- to 29-year-old man 
who identifies as queer and gay).

Many participants also described how their experiences with SOGIECE had provoked 
a great deal of anxiety and dread. Here, participants tended to describe how attending

SOGIECE was, by and large, an energy-draining and damaging experience. For the majority 
of participants, the stress induced by SOGIECE was exacerbated by broader efforts to 
conceal their sexual and gender identities from family members and their communities. 
Participants detailed a variety of coping strategies for managing these negative emotions, 
including some maladaptive strategies such as using alcohol, cannabis, and cigarettes as 
means for coping with the effects of SOGIECE. One participant described the relationship 
between his sexuality, SOGIECE, and substance use:

There was sort of a level of tension and energy sort of like, I don’t know, 
maintaining a facade or trying suppress it [my sexuality], exactly, I don’t know 
how much I tried to suppress it. I guess there was a level of tension and anxiety 
that just, sort of, just [was] kind of a constant state of being. […] I drank a lot, I 
struggled with alcohol I guess most of my adult life on and off, and I don’t know 
how directly, I’m sure that they’re related, but there are probably other things that 
have impacted that (50- to 59-year-old man who identifies as gay).

Participants also described the ways in which SOGIECE had contributed to feelings of 
hopelessness and despair, both with regard to their present circumstances in SOGIECE 
and their future outlooks on life. Here, participants described how the heavy emotional 
burden of life within a SOGIECE context had taken a toll on their mental health. Indeed, 
participants overwhelmingly characterized SOGIECE as having contributed to significant 
mental distress through repeated instances of disaffirmation. Participants further described 
how this emotional distress had deeply impacted their life-course trajectories, including 
with regard to access to educational and employment opportunities. For example, a subset 
of participants described how the emotional damage done through SOGIECE had been so 
burdensome that, even after their experiences with SOGIECE had come to an end, they 
remained too unwell to work and/or pursue their educations. One participant described her 
mental health-related disability following SOGIECE:

A lot of it was depression and anxiety arising from that. So, I was a mental 
health case who needed help. […] I just hit rock bottom and just stayed there, in 
a severe depression, for probably about a good half decade honestly. There was 
a half-decade of my life where I was just living in my mom’s basement. I was 
completely disabled – I would spend most days just in bed. I was not good or useful 
or able to function in any way (30- to 39-year-old woman who identifies as bisexual 
and trans).

For a subset of participants, experiences with SOGIECE were described as key contributors 
to specific healthcare provider-diagnosed mental illnesses, including anxiety disorders, 
mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Most commonly, participants described 
experiencing depression and depressive symptoms due to the cumulative emotional toll 
of SOGIECE. Participants with brief exposure to SOGIECE tended to characterize this 
depression as acute and short-lived, while those with longer or more traumatic exposure 
to SOGIECE often described having become depressed for prolonged periods of time. In 
describing their emotional state following an intensive series of SOGIECE, one participant 
reflected:

They made me really, really depressed. They made me feel like I was failing, they 
made me feel like I’m not trying hard enough, because to me it all made sense and 
I just had to kind of apply myself to this program. But, it wasn’t working! And so, 
it was kind of like my last little glimmer of hope was dissipating and I had nothing 
else to rely on, and I was just going to be super unhappy for the rest of my life, 
because I couldn’t do this… So, I kind of took it as a personal failure. Eventually, 
that led to a very dark period in my life where I was suicidal and just things were 
not going well (20- to 29-year-old non-binary person who identifies as queer).

Several participants experienced suicidal thoughts before, during, and after their SOGIECE 
experiences. The suppression of one’s sexual and/or gender identities through SOGIECE 
was revealed to be a particularly influential contributor to suicidality. Participants often 
characterized feelings of social isolation, hopelessness, and despair related to their 
experiences with SOGIECE as key causes of their desire to end their lives. Participants 
tended to associate their experiences with suicidality to SOGIECE in a broad sense. Here, 
many participants indicated that severe declines in mental health – to a point of being 
suicidal – had been the “final straw” that led them to cease taking part in SOGIECE. 
Participants also went on to describe how specific SOGIECE-related moments, periods, 
and methods had been especially egregious in terms of provoking thoughts of suicide. This 
“out” through suicide was sometimes even described by participants to be more fathomable 
than the alternative of abandoning SOGIECE. In recounting a time in which outside efforts 
to suppress her gender identity and expression had intensified, one participant described a 
corresponding intensification in her intent to kill herself:

I risked dying several times because I could not talk about my [true] gender 
identity. […] They [family members and faith-based SOGIECE practitioners] really 
wanted me to present myself to the world as a man, which I am not, at all! And 
that, that really was the realization that affected the most and that really hurt the 
most, knowing that I couldn’t affirm my identity, in any way, and that I just had 
to keep it locked inside of me. It was really, really hard. […] I felt so, like, being 
put back in a prison that I had just left, like, the only thing I was thinking about 
in that moment – at that time, the hall was, and is still near the river, so the river 
was the only thing I could see in front of me when I left – was that it would be 
better to die than to not able to live my life fully, without restrictions, and with 
the happiness that I deserved to have (30- to 39-year-old person who identifies as 
pansexual, trans, non-binary, genderfae, and a woman).

Discussion

This study with people with lived experience of SOGIECE identified that these practices 
create and/or exacerbate multiple adverse health and social impacts, including feelings 
of “brokenness,” social and relational consequences, and impaired mental health and 
wellbeing. Critically, our findings show that SOGIECE contribute to serious mental distress 
and illness, including diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders, in addition to experiences 
of suicidality. These findings situate the continued occurrence of SOGIECE as both a 
product of, and contributor to, societal inequities facing 2SLGBTQ+ people.

In this study, participants frequently described the ways in which their sexual and gender 
identities had been rejected, pathologized and devalued by SOGIECE practitioners and 
through cisheterosexist and non-affirming messaging. Participants described how this 
“othering” had contributed to pronounced feelings of social isolation and lack of belonging, 
in addition to a series of other lasting impacts (e.g., challenges engaging in romantic 
relationships, lost opportunities in relation to education and employment). In considering 
these social and relational challenges, our findings align with existing research that 
underscores the need for family and community members to support and affirm 2SLGBTQ+ 
people, particularly in ways that foster positive personal and sexual and gender identities, 
rather than compounding experiences of minority stress marked by victimization, rejection, 
and internalized stigma (Green et al., 2020; Meyer, 2003; Caitlin Ryan et al., 2020). Further, 
because the parents and support persons (e.g., religious leaders, healthcare providers) of 
people with lived experience of SOGIECE are typically motivated by doing what they 
think is best for those in their care (C Ryan, 2009; Caitlin Ryan et al., 2020), targeted 
educational efforts are needed to assist families and broader communities in understanding 
the relationship between rejection/acceptance and health and wellbeing for 2SLGBTQ+ 
people. Alongside such efforts, however, is demand for concerted research and policy efforts 
to account for and address the structural determinants of inequities faced by 2SLGBTQ+ 
people, particularly as they permit and drive SOGIECE (e.g., laws related to the rights 
of 2SLGBTQ+ people; societal and religious discourses surrounding the acceptability of 
2SLGBTQ+ “lifestyles”).

Findings from this study underscore the extent to which SOGIECE disrupt opportunities for 
2SLGBTQ+ people to experience mental and social wellbeing. For example, participants in 
the current study offered rich descriptions of the ways in which SOGIECE had contributed 
to poor self-image and self-esteem. Moreover, participants described deep-seated feelings of 
guilt and shame related to their sexual and gender identities, in addition to their experiences 
with SOGIECE (e.g., due to: their perceived role in attending SOGIECE, feelings of “letting 
down” others by not suppressing their sexual and gender identities). These findings align 
with prior research wherein sexual orientation change efforts were overwhelmingly found 
to elicit feelings of shame, guilt, and self-hatred (Cramer et al., 2008; Flentje et al., 2014). 
In addition, findings of this nature contextualize anecdotal reports from our community 
and policy engagement efforts related to SOGIECE (Salway, 2020a), wherein community 
members have described a hesitancy to share their SOGIECE stories due to feelings of 
shame and concern that they may be judged by others. These findings have considerable 
implications for advocacy work, as they both underscore the need to meaningfully engage 
people with lived experience to share their stories in SOGIECE-related policy discussions, 
and, further, to scale-up and de-stigmatize everyday conversations and educational efforts 
related to SOGIECE and their impacts.

The adverse SOGIECE-related mental health impacts highlighted in this study are similar 
to those reported in the extant SOGIECE literature – namely, loneliness, substance use, 
depression, anxiety, and suicidality (Flentje et al., 2014; Green et al., 2020; Caitlin Ryan et 
al., 2020; Salway et al., 2020; Turban, Beckwith, et al., 2019). The current study adds to

internalized sense of brokenness, disrupted or destroyed social supports and opportunities 
for personal growth, and a sense of failure or shame at having undertaken ineffective 
SOGIECE. Participants attributed a spectrum of mental health-related harms to SOGIECE – 
ranging from feelings of isolation and shame to more pronounced manifestations of mental 
distress (e.g., the development of anxiety, mood, and post-traumatic stress disorders). Of 
particular concern, many participants in our study also disclosed having become suicidal 
during and following their experiences with SOGIECE. A plausible association between 
SOGIECE and these adverse mental health outcomes can be conceptualized through 
the minority stress framework (Brooks, 1981; Meyer, 1995, 2003; Rich et al., 2020; 
Turban, Beckwith, et al., 2019), wherein stigma-related stress from exposure to SOGIECE 
and broader cisheterosexist influences are thought to increase emotional dysregulation, 
interpersonal dysfunction, and risk for mental health problems. Indeed, SOGIECE have been 
called “the sharpest edge of minority stress” (Salway, 2019).

To facilitate efforts to address the poor mental health experiences identified in this study 
and in previous research in this area (Salway et al., 2020), we urge all people with 
lived experience of SOGIECE to have discussions with their healthcare and peer supports 
regarding any lasting psychological sequelae related to SOGIECE. Concomitantly, we agree 
with elsewhere-documented appeals (Green et al., 2020; Meanley et al., 2019) for healthcare 
providers to proactively screen 2SLGBTQ+ clients for exposure to SOGIECE, and, if 
such exposure is present, to assess and support their mental health in a trauma-informed, 
non-judgmental, and person-centered manner. It is of paramount importance that healthcare 
providers be aware of and responsive to the mental health and societal inequities facing 
this priority population, if we are to meaningfully advance equity in health and healthcare 
access for 2SLGBTQ+ people in the context of SOGIECE and more generally. Further 
to these strategies, there is critical demand for upstream measures that prevent SOGIECE 
from occurring in the first place. We therefore join calls for the immediate design and 
implementation of comprehensive policy interventions (e.g., healthcare profession-specific 
regulatory measures; legislative efforts) to ban SOGIECE across Canada and the globe 
(Department of Justice Canada, 2020; Mallory et al., 2019; Salway, 2020b). The successful 
advancement of interventions such as these will also benefit from judicious research and 
evaluation efforts, including concerted investigation into what survivors of SOGIECE 
themselves deem to be the most needed and effective supports – insights that are presently 
lacking in the extant literature.

This study has strengths and limitations that should be noted. This study captured 
highly contextualized descriptions of the health and social impacts of SOGIECE from 
the standpoints of a pan-Canadian sample of people with lived experience. Yet, social 
desirability bias may have contributed to inaccurate or incomplete reporting of the stigma-
laden topics under study (e.g., 2SLGBTQ+ identities, mental illness). Furthermore, while 
our stratified purposive sampling strategy had intended to recruit a diverse group of people 
with lived experience of SOGIECE, our study sample predominantly included cisgender 
gay men. Additional research is needed to explore how the experiences and impacts of 
SOGIECE vary within and across 2SLGBTQ+ populations, with particular attention to those 
who tend to be underrepresented in sexual and gender minority health research (e.g., queer 
women, trans people; queer and trans Black, Indigenous, and people of colour). Similarly,

future research should explore how the diverse social positionalities of people with lived 
experience of SOGIECE (e.g., with respect to: age, ethnocultural identity, religiosity, 
culture, socioeconomic status) interact with various contexts and systems of oppression in 
ways that may shape experiences and trajectories of SOGIECE.

Conclusion

There is mounting evidence of the ineffectiveness of and harms caused by SOGIECE; 
however, these practices remain prevalent across Canada and the globe. Our study provides 
a highly contextualized investigation of the ways in which SOGIECE result in adverse 
health and social outcomes among people with firsthand experience of these practices. In 
particular, our findings underscore that SOGIECE contribute to interconnected, deleterious 
experiences of guilt, shame, social isolation, poor mental health, and suicidality. Taken 
as a whole, these findings identify SOGIECE as both a key consequence and driver of 
societal inequities facing 2SLGBTQ+ people in Canada. Equity-oriented interventions to 
end SOGIECE and support the health and wellbeing of those who have experienced it are 
needed at the individual, community, healthcare, and structural policy levels. Specifically, 
findings from this study underscore the need for comprehensive policy and legislation 
to prevent SOGIECE, enhanced sexuality- and gender-related educational efforts with the 
families and support persons (e.g., religious leaders, healthcare providers) of 2SLGBTQ+ 
people, and targeted mental health screening and supports for people with lived experience 
of SOGIECE. To more fulsomely realize the potential of these policy and programmatic 
recommendations, we concomitantly urge that people with lived experience be centered in 
all efforts to redress the far-reaching harms associated with SOGIECE.
