REVIEW

 CURRENTOPINION Schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic

Stefano Barlatia,b, Gabriele Nibbioa and Antonio Vitaa,b

Purpose of review
The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a critical impact on healthcare systems across
the world, as well as on mental health in the general population; however, evidence regarding the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with schizophrenia and on the onset of psychotic symptoms is
currently emerging.

Recent findings
People living with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of COVID-19 and present worse COVID-19-
related outcomes, including mortality. They show low levels of information and of concern regarding the
possibility of contagion and infection but presented substantially stable levels of psychotic symptoms and
even increased subjective well being during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as well as the prolonged social
isolation and the spread of misinformation, appear to be responsible in some cases for the onset of
psychotic symptoms.

Summary
Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to avoid contagion. Particular attention should be
devoted to maintaining the continuity of care, especially in frail patients. Telemedicine might represent a
valid support, but face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential. The hypothesis of a direct role of viral
infection on the onset of psychotic disorders is currently debated, as viral involvement of central nervous
system appears to be rather infrequent in COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

Background
The first known cases of COVID-19, the illness
caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appeared in December
2019 [1]: since then, the outbreak has interested
many countries across
leading the
WHO to declare it a pandemic on 11 March 2020
and many governments to orient their public health
efforts in attempts to slow the spread of the disease
[2]. As of January 2021, more than 79 million indi-
viduals have been infected by the virus SARS-CoV2,
which has been deemed responsible of more than
1.7 million deaths worldwide [3].

the globe,

Economic and ethnical disparities appear to
have a relevant impact on the incidence and on
the outcomes of COVID-19: marginalized groups
present worst morbidity and mortality [4,5], and
individuals affected by severe mental
illnesses
(SMIs) might be disproportionately affected by the
disease [6&,7]. In particular, people living with schiz-
ophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) appear to be at a

high risk of infection [8] and of adverse outcomes, as
they typically present poorer physical health,
greater social and economic disadvantage, and, even
before the outbreak, shorter life expectancy and
higher excess mortality, mainly due to noncommu-
nicable diseases [9,10].
On the contrary,

the relationship between
COVID-19 and mental disorders in general appears
to be biunivocal, as psychiatric diagnosis might

KEY POINTS

(cid:2) Individuals diagnosed with SSD show higher risk of

COVID-19 and worse COVID-19 outcomes, including
mortality, however, during the course of the pandemic,
psychotic symptoms remained substantially stable in
these individuals, and subjective well being was also
stable or even improved.

(cid:2) SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in the absence of COVID-

19 symptoms, as well as prolonged social isolation and
the spread of misinformation, have been deemed
responsible of the onset of psychotic symptoms in
individuals without previous psychiatric history in
several well documented cases.

(cid:2) As lockdowns were issued in many countries in order to
slow the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, providing adequate
mental healthcare and ensuring continuity of treatment
in individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
presented some problematic issues, especially in low-
income contexts, with negative clinical repercussions.

(cid:2) Clinicians should inform and educate their patients on
the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-
19 and on the precautions that they should adopt to
avoid contagion, relying on telemedicine when
possible, but knowing that face-to-face visits in some
cases remain essential.

(cid:2) Potential adverse events and drug interactions of
antipsychotic medications have to be carefully
considered in the context of the pandemic, and in
particular in SARS-Cov2-positive individuals.

represent an independent risk factor for COVID-19,
and COVID-19 survivors appear to be at increased
risk of psychiatric sequelae [11&] Moreover, the stress
resulting from isolation and societal disruption dur-
ing a pandemic and in particular during lockdown
periods might have a negative effect on anxiety and
depressive symptoms [12]: in this perspective, the
impact of COVID-19 on the severity and even on the
incidence of psychotic disorders might represent a
relevant issue [13,14].

Aims
Although some previous work already discussed the
impact of COVID-19 on the lives of people affected
by psychotic disorders, providing recommendations
on this topic, these are largely based on literature
predating the COVID-19 outbreak, as they were
issued as experts opinions in the earliest stages of
the pandemic [15&,16].

This review aims to present recent evidence on
the direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion and of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with
schizophrenia and provide a discussion on how

mental health services and professionals might con-
tribute to overcome the emerging needs related to
this particular situation.

INCIDENCE AND OUTCOMES OF COVID-19
IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

Incidence of COVID-19 has been found to be higher
in patients with a recent diagnosis of schizophrenia,
compared with those without psychiatric diagnoses
(adjusted odds ratio 9.89, corrected for medical
comorbidities 7.34, P < 0.001 in both cases), in a
study conducted on a large USA database including
61783 950 individuals, of which 15 110 were
COVID-19 patients [17&&]. The same study also
found a higher death rate for patients with a recent
(8.5 vs. 4.7%,
diagnosis of mental disorders
P < 0.001) and a higher hospitalization rate (27.4
vs. 18.6%, P < 0.001).

A Korean nationwide retrospective case-control
study including 219 961 individuals, 7341 of which
were COVID-19 patients, also found schizophrenia,
among other medical and psychiatric illnesses, to be
independently associated with higher risk of COVID-
19 (odds ratio range 1.61–1.72, P < 0.001) [18]. Psy-
chiatric disorders, however, were not included in
analyses on COVID-19 severity and outcomes.

A French study including 50 750 hospitalized
individuals and focused on COVID-19 outcomes in
individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia not only
found an increased in-hospital mortality in this
group (25.6 vs. 21.7%; adjusted odds ratio 1.30,
P ¼ 0.009) but also, interestingly, a decreased ICU
admission rate (23.7 vs. 28.4%; adjusted odds ratio
0.75, P ¼ 0.006) [19&], substantially replicating the
results of a study on a much smaller sample con-
ducted by the same research group [20]. These
results underline not only that individuals diag-
nosed with schizophrenia could suffer from more
severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but also that
important disparities might exist in the quality of
healthcare that they receive, even in relation to
COVID-19. This finding however might be influ-
enced by the characteristics of the healthcare system
and care setting: in fact, a study conducted in the UK
unexpectedly found that patients with a diagnosis
of psychiatric disorder were tested for COVID-19
more frequently, and globally were less likely to
emerge as positive to the test. However, individuals
with previous ‘psychotic experiences’ represented
an exception, being positive more frequently than
controls [21].

Of note, it is important to take into account that
subjects with SSD often represent the majority of the
residents of long-term care psychiatric rehabilita-
tion centres, and in these facilities, the diffusion

of SARS-CoV-2 can be quite fast and difficult to
control: a study has found that, despite closely
following the local shelter-in-place order and symp-
tom-based testing issued in March 2020, 40 (74%) of
the 50 facility residents in March and April 2020
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with a doubling time
of 3.9 days [22].

IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE
CLINICAL SITUATION OF PEOPLE LIVING
WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
clinical situation of individuals diagnosed with
SMI, including schizophrenia, is the focus of a grow-
ing body of scientific literature.

A study conducted in Spain on 625 patients
contacted with an anonymous online questionnaire
has found that, although most of the responders
with a diagnosis of severe mental disorders were able
to enjoy their free time during the COVID-19 pan-
demic lockdown period, they reported higher anxi-
ety, stress and depression responses than the general
population [23].

Another survey study conducted in India on 210
individuals diagnosed with SMI, of whom 105 had a
diagnosis of SSD, found that during lockdown one
out of five patients stopped their medication regi-
men and 30% of the sample suffered from a worsen-
ing of psychiatric symptoms. Individuals with SMI
also showed low knowledge about COVID-19 symp-
toms and precautions to avoid infection, and three
out of four did not report any worry of contracting
the disease [24&].
However,

uals fares during the pandemic.

taking

A study conducted in Spain comparing 206
individuals with self-reported mental illnesses to
413 community controls found that those with
anxiety or depressive disorders showed significantly
worse psychological distress (P < 0.001), negative
expectations about the future (P ¼ 0.013) and sleep
disturbances (P ¼ 0.007) than those with a diagnosis
of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [25].

Similar results were found on a sample (n ¼ 139)
of patients in Germany, where individuals with
diagnoses of affective disorders reported greater
COVID-19-related stress (ANOVA P < 0.001 on both
the adopted scales, even after controlling for poten-
tial confounding factors) than individuals with a
diagnosis of SSD, leading the authors to hypothesize
a potential protective role of the preoccupation with
serious intrinsic issues on the stress level increase
related to the pandemic situation [26&].

Schizophrenia during the COVID-19 pandemic Barlati et al.

Another German study investigating the per-
ceived impact of the pandemic in people with var-
ious self-reported psychiatric disorders, compared
with healthy controls, has found that psychosocial
stress levels were higher across the whole sample,
and people with mental disorders showed higher
personal worries regarding COVID-19 and fear of
contagion. However, although a worsening of clin-
ical symptoms was also reported for patients with
generalized anxiety disorder, illness anxiety disor-
ders, and body dysmorphic disorder, this was not
observed in subjects with SSD [27].

A recent longitudinal observational study inves-
tigated through a phone survey the changes in
affective experiences and in symptoms severity
between April and June 2020 in a well characterized
sample of 148 USA individuals clinically diagnosed
with SMI (92 diagnosed with SSD, 55 with bipolar
disorder and one with major depressive disorders
with psychotic features). The results of this study
showed that the severity of affective experiences, of
psychotic symptoms and of sleep disturbances
remained substantially stable across time for indi-
viduals diagnosed with SSD (P > 0.05, Cohen’s
d < 0.20 for all measures). Although in this subsam-
ple subjective well being increased across time
(P < 0.05, Cohen’s d ¼ 0.35), an increase was also
observed in substance use (P < 0.05, Cohen’s
d ¼ 0.13) [28&&].

Interestingly, one narrative article reported that
in a specialized psychiatric rehabilitation unit, the
lockdown was perceived positively by the patients,
as this improved the relationship with the staff of
the unit, encouraging a greater feeling of commun-
ity and emphasized self and treatment awareness.
Some patients also perceived the lockdown as help-
ful, as it brought the cessation of visits from family
members with whom they had ambivalent relation-
ships [29].

Two Chines

studies compared hospitalized
patients diagnosed with schizophrenia isolated for
close contact with COVID-19 positive individuals or
for suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection to those not iso-
lated and, as expected, found higher levels of depres-
sion and anxiety and worse sleep disturbances in
isolated patients. However, both studies found no
between-groups differences in schizophrenic symp-
toms severity as measured by the Positive and Neg-
ative Syndrome Scale (P ¼ 0.52 in one and P ¼ 0.248
or P ¼ 0.463 if corrected for potential confounders in
the other) [30,31]. One study also compared the
clinical condition of patients before and after iso-
lation, and again, no difference was observed in
schizophrenia symptoms severity (P ¼ 0.36) [30].

However, SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to
symptoms relapse in clinically stable patients: the

virus has been deemed responsible, in the absence of
COVID-19 symptoms, of psychotic and confusional
symptoms in a 65-year-old man with diagnosis of
schizophrenia whose clinical picture had been sta-
ble for a very long period (20 years) [32]. His clinical
situation worsened into a case of catatonia that
was successfully treated with electroconvulsive ther-
apy [33].

IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE
INCIDENCE OF PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS

As regards the impact of COVID-19 and of the
pandemic on the incidence of new cases of psy-
chotic disorders, available evidence is composed
essentially by case series and reports.

One well described case of persistent psychotic
symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection is avail-
able. The 55-year-old female patient developed post-
COVID-19 delirium, which was followed by perse-
cutory delusions, complex visual and auditory hal-
lucination and Capgras Syndrome for about 40 days.
Although the authors did not ascertain a cause for
this clinical picture, they hypothesize an inflamma-
tory cause on the basis of the observed high levels of
tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the absence of
hypoxia [34].

One interesting article reports a case of a 34-
year-old man, positive for SARS-CoV-2 but with very
mild symptoms (anosmia and headaches), who
started showing increasingly severe disturbances
and later presented a full-blown picture of schizo-
affective disorder. All his laboratory and neuroimag-
ing tests resulted substantially normal, and his
symptoms subsided, albeit gradually, with relatively
low dose of antipsychotic treatment [35&].

Another case report describes a brief psychotic
disorder in a individual with negative personal and
family history of psychiatric disorders after COVID-
19. Psychotic symptoms improved with treatment
and subsided after the resolution of COVID-19
symptoms [36].

Other interesting reports of psychotic symp-
toms following SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals
without previous psychiatric history include a case
series of three individuals without COVID-19 symp-
toms and high levels of C-reactive protein [37],
another case series of three individuals whose psy-
chotic symptoms remarkably improved with anti-
psychotic treatment in 2 days [38], a case of brief
reactive psychosis with paranoid delusions and
auditory hallucinations in a 30-year-old male indi-
vidual [39], a case of affective psychosis in a 43-year-
old male individual [40], a case of psychotic and
confusional symptoms leading to a suicide attempt
in a 34-year-old male healthcare worker [41] and a

case of catatonia that responded to intravenous
benzodiazepines in another 43-year-old male indi-
vidual [42].

The COVID-19 pandemic could represent in some
individuals a precipitating factor even in the absence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection: prolonged social isolation,
fear of contagion and the uncontrolled spread, espe-
cially online, of pandemic-related conspiracy theories
and delusion-like beliefs, dubbed by some authors as
the ‘infodemic’, might be linked not only to high
levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms and sleep dis-
turbances, but also to psychotic symptoms.

In fact, a study conducted in Spain on 174
individuals recruited in the general population
found that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psy-
chotic
symptoms and pseudoscientific beliefs
increased across the total social quarantine imposed
to control the viral spread [43].

An interesting case series reported that three
individuals with negative psychiatric history (a
23-year-old man, a 30-year-old woman and a 37-
year-old man), all testing negative to SARS-CoV-2,
developed delusions specifically related to the
COVID-19 pandemic: in each of these cases, the
psychotic symptoms led to a first psychiatric hospi-
talization [44].

Another case series reports of six first-episode
psychoses, confirmed later as brief psychotic disor-
der or acute transient psychotic disorder, of individ-
uals with negative psychiatric history and advanced
age. All patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and
had religious-spiritual delusions and hallucinations;
half of the individuals had somatic delusions of
being infected. All patients required hospitalization
but were rapidly discharged with remission of symp-
toms and good insight after relatively low-dose anti-
psychotic treatment [45].

IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON
TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

The outbreak of COVID-19 represents a relevant
issue as regards the safety profile of psychotropic
medications, as some relevant drug-drug interac-
tions might be present with drugs used for
COVID-19 treatment, and some psychotropic med-
ications might produce adverse effect that could be
seriously dangerous in COVID-19 patients. A sys-
tematic review providing important experts recom-
mendations has been conducted on this topic [46&&]:
main recommendations regarding antipsychotic
drug use are to check for potential drug interactions
and avoid dangerous associations, carefully assess
respiratory function, avoiding molecules that could
cause respiratory depression particularly in the long
term, and carefully monitor cardiac parameters

including QTc, the risk for secondary infections and
the risk of thromboembolism.

Individuals treated with long-acting injectable
(LAI) antipsychotics should continue receiving this
form of treatment, as it has a considerable positive
impact on relapse prevention, even if in-person
visits, which are required for administering the
injection, might represent a potential source of
contagion as they require close physical proximity
[15&,47]. An interesting retrospective observational
study conducted in Romania shows an important
reduction of LAI antipsychotics prescriptions during
the pandemic in favour of oral formulations [48].
The authors comment that this could be due to the
reduction of in-person visits, to their cost and to
delays in pharmacies supply, and might lead to a
higher incidence of relapses in the near future. This
represents a relevant issue, that could be particularly
problematic in less wealthy countries. In fact, a
study reports that in Pittsburgh, USA no similar
decrease in the prescription of LAI was observed.
However, the authors also report that their region
was not a hot-spot of SARS-CoV-2 transmission [49].
Clozapine treatment in particular represents an
issue, both because it increases susceptibility to
infections and because monitoring of absolute
white cell blood count might become difficult to
implement
in accordance with the restrictions
adopted in various countries to slow the spread of
contagion. An expert consensus has considered this
issue and recommended that in stable patients the
frequency of neutrophils count can be reduced to
once every 3 months; in patients with any symp-
toms of infection, urgent physician assessment and
complete blood count should be immediately car-
ried out; in patients presenting fever or flu-like
symptoms, clozapine dose should be lowered by
as much as half [50]. Some authors have argued that
this reduction might not be enough in patients who
are probably facing COVID-19 symptoms, and rec-
ommend lowering the dose to a third or stopping it
completely [51]; other suggest to provide Vitamin D
supplementation in all patients treated with cloza-
pine to increase protection against respiratory infec-
tions [52]. The use of clozapine has also been
associated with increased risk of COVID-19 in a
retrospective cohort study conducted in the UK
including 6309 participants [53].

On the contrary, an interesting series composed
of seven cases from the UK reports that, with some
caution and clinical attention, clozapine can be
safely used in individuals affected by COVID-19,
effectively preventing relapses of psychotic symp-
toms, after ruling out that clozapine might be
responsible of some of the observed symptoms
[54]. Telephonic monitoring, including telematic

transmission of absolute neutrophils count, might
also represent a possible and viable solution to
maintain treatment continuity in individual treated
with clozapine [55].

Telemedicine-videoconferencing and e-mental
health represent important tools to keep continuity
of care in individuals diagnosed with SMI without
increasing the risk of viral spread with in-person
visits [47,56].

Some studies have shown that enhancing evi-
dence-based interventions, such as assertive com-
munity treatment, with mobile-based interventions
had a positive effect on clinical outcomes in indi-
viduals with SMI including schizophrenia [57], or
that digital health interventions designed to
improve relapse prevention in individuals with first
episode psychosis are deemed feasible and appreci-
ated by both patients and clinicians [58]. However,
the actual effectiveness of such interventions is not
yet supported by solid evidence, and some authors
consider face-to-face interventions essential in the
psychiatric care of SSD, especially for new cases with
suspected psychosis or for individuals with techno-
logical delusions or phobias [59].

DISCUSSION

Current and solid evidence attests that people diag-
nosed with schizophrenia, compared with the gen-
eral population, show higher COVID-19-related
mortality and increased risk of
contracting
COVID-19 [17&&].

The first might be due to the higher frequency of
comorbid medical conditions [10] and, to a certain
extent, to discrepancies in the quality of care, which
result from stigma [19&,60]; the latter might prob-
ably be related to the low level of information
regarding COVID-19 and of concern regarding the
possibility of infection that have both been observed
in individuals diagnosed with SMI [24&].

Both the increased risk of COVID-19 and the
higher mortality could be also related to the unheal-
thy lifestyle that is frequently observed in subjects
living with schizophrenia; in particular, the habit of
tobacco smoking could have a negative impact on
prognosis in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The low level of information regarding COVID-
19, in turn, could be determined by various factors,
such as the lower level of education or the cognitive
deficits; the low level of concern may be linked not
only to the lack of information, but also to cognitive
deficits and autistic features, such as preoccupation
with intrinsic issues, that represent central elements
of the disorder [61].

The low level of awareness and concern regard-
ing the virus and the pandemic, however, might be

associated with the substantially stable psychotic
symptoms and stable or even improved subjective
well being, which have been observed in some stud-
ies [28&&].
In this context, some authors also
hypothesized a protective role of intrinsic preoccu-
pation in patients with SSD [26&].

These correlations (see Fig. 1), however, at
present remain hypothetical and should be con-
firmed with more evidence derived from methodo-
logically appropriate studies.

in
COVID-19 has been deemed responsible,
some cases, of the onset of psychotic symptoms
and disorders or of the exacerbation of psychotic
symptoms in subjects with a stable clinical picture
[32,34,35&,36]. Some of these cases however might
indicate a direct neurological involvement, since
they had a clinical presentation including atypical
and confusional symptoms, closer to delirium than
to SSD [32,41].

Although the hypothesis of a role of viral or
immuno-mediated mechanisms in the pathophysi-
ology of psychotic disorders is of great potential
interest [35&], the current literature regarding this
aspect of SARS-CoV-2 is still anecdotal and this
interesting issue remains debated [62,63].

Of note, the potential impact of prenatal and
perinatal SARS-CoV-2 infection on individual’s neu-
rodevelopment represents an issue requiring close
scientific and clinical attention in the forthcoming
years [64–66].

Despite in the last year a substantial number of
papers regarding COVID-19 and psychiatric disor-
ders, including schizophrenia, have been published,
the vast majority of this wealth of scientific litera-
ture is composed by studies with relevant intrinsic
methodological
limitations, case series and case
reports, or experts’ opinions and consensuses. In
this context, beyond some recent and noteworthy
exceptions, there is the need to acquire a more
robust body of scientific evidence on this topic.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Clinicians should inform and educate their patients
on the risks related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19 and on the precautions that they should
adopt to avoid or reduce the risk of contagion.
Particular attention should be devoted to maintain-
ing the continuity of care, especially in frail patients.
Telemedicine might represent a valid support, but
face-to-face visits in some cases remain essential,
and have to be conducted with all the necessary
precautions to avoid infection for both patients and
clinicians. More solid evidence should be gathered
on the effects of COVID-19 and of the pandemic in
people living with schizophrenia, on the potential
risk of psychosis related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as
well as on the safety and the possible interactions of
antipsychotic medications and drugs used to treat
COVID-19.
