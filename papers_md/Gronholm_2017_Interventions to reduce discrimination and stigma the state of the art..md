Abstract 
Background  There  is  a  rich  literature  on  the  nature  of 
mental  health-related  stigma  and  the  processes  by  which 
it  severely  affects  the  life  chances  of  people  with  men-
tal  health  problems.  However,  applying  this  knowledge  to 
deliver and evaluate interventions to reduce discrimination 
and  stigma  in  a  lasting  way  is  a  complex  and  long-term 
challenge.
Methods  We  conducted  a  narrative  synthesis  of  system-
atic  reviews  published  since  2012,  and  supplemented  this 
with  papers  published  subsequently  as  examples  of  more 
recent work.
Results  There  is  evidence  for  small  to  moderate  positive 
impacts  of  both  mass  media  campaigns  and  interventions 
for target groups in terms of stigma-related knowledge, atti-
tudes,  and  intended  behaviour  in  terms  of  desire  for  con-
tact. However, the limited evidence from longer follow-up 
times suggests that it is not clear whether short-term con-
tact interventions have a lasting impact.
Conclusions  The  risk  that  short-term  interventions  may 
only  have  a  short-term  impact  suggests  a  need  to  study 
longer  term  interventions  and  to  use  interim  process  and 
outcome data to improve interventions along the way. There 
is  scope  for  more  thorough  application  of  intergroup  con-
tact theory whenever contact is used and of evidence-based

Introduction

Mental health-related discrimination and stigma are global, 
multifaceted  problems.  Research  and  intervention  in  this 
field have applied a variety of definitions, targets and out-
comes. An overview of these means of describing, clarify-
ing  and  classifying  the  stigma  concept  is  provided  by,  for 
example,  Pescosolido  and  Martin  [1].  They  outlined  two 
broad  perspectives—experiential  and  action-orientated—
through which stigma can be categorised.

The  experiential  perspective  distinguishes  between 
whether stigma is (1) perceived (a belief “most people” are 
considered  to  hold),  (2)  endorsed  (expressing  agreement 
with  stereotypes/prejudice/discrimination),  (3)  anticipated 
(expecting  an  experience  of  prejudice/discrimination),  (4) 
received (overt experiences of rejection or devaluation), or 
(5) enacted (exhibiting discriminatory behaviours).

The action-oriented view considers who (or what) gives 
or  receives  the  stigma.  From  this  perspective,  distinctions 
are made between (1) public stigma (stereotypes, prejudice 
and discrimination as endorsed by the general population); 
(2) structural stigma (prejudice and discrimination through 
laws,  policies,  and  constitutional  practices);  (3)  courtesy 
stigma (stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination acquired 
through  a  connexion  with  a  stigmatised  group/person); 
(4)  provider-based  stigma  (prejudice  and  discrimination 
by  occupational  groups  designated  to  provide  assistance 
to  stigmatised  groups),  and;  (5)  self-stigma  (when  people

who belong to a stigmatised group legitimise publicly held 
stereotypes and prejudice, and internalise these by applying 
them to themselves).

As  expected  for  such  a  multifaceted  phenomenon,  the 
impacts  of  experienced  and  anticipated  discrimination  in 
combination  are  severe:  poor  access  to  mental  [2,  3],  and 
physical  healthcare  [4];  reduced  life  expectancy  [5,  6]; 
exclusion from higher education [7, 8] and employment [9]; 
increased risk of contact with criminal justice systems; vic-
timisation [10]; poverty and homelessness. For many peo-
ple, these consequences have been described as worse than 
the experience of the mental illness itself [11]. While there 
is  more  than  one  theory  of  stigma,  they  share  an  under-
standing that it constitutes a significant public health con-
cern  [12,  13].  Some  governments  and  non-governmental 
organisations have also recognised this. One of the six key 
objectives of the UK Government’s mental health strategy 
2011–15  specified  the  need  to  ensure  fewer  people  expe-
rience  stigma  and  discrimination  due  to  their  mental  ill-
ness [14]. The World Health Organisations’ Mental Health 
Action  Plan  2013–2020  specifies  that  people  affected  by 
mental illness should be able to participate fully in society 
and  at  work,  free  from  stigmatisation  and  discrimination 
[15].

Anti‑stigma interventions: the state of the art

In  common  with  any  public  health  intervention,  pro-
grammes  to  reduce  discrimination  and  stigma  must  be 
based  on  a  series  of  decisions,  in  this  case:  the  scope  to 
mental  disorders  to  be  included,  whether  explicitly  or 
implicitly;  the  level  of  intervention,  whether  structural, 
interpersonal, or self-stigma; whether to take a whole pop-
ulation approach versus choosing target groups, and if the 
latter,  which  groups  are  priority  targets  in  terms  of  either 
the frequency and/or severity of the impact on people with 
mental health problems; what approach an intervention for 
a given group and at a given level should take; and how to 
evaluate the impact.

It  is  to  be  hoped  that  these  decisions  will  be  based  on 
existing  evidence  and  developmental  work  carried  out  by 
those  delivering  a  programme.  However,  it  seems  likely 
that  decision-making  will  also  reflect  who  the  decision-
makers  are.  Traditionally,  anti-stigma  programmes  were 
conducted  by  or  with  considerable  involvement  from 
groups representing psychiatric expertise such as the World 
Psychiatric Association and Royal College of Psychiatrists 
(regarding programmes in the UK). However, more recent 
programmes have greater leadership from advocacy groups 
and mental health charities. These groups have often identi-
fied mental health professionals as a source of stigmatisa-
tion  and  question  whether  they  are  therefore  in  a  credible 

position  to  lead  anti-stigma  programmes  [16].  Another 
potentially  important  influence  on  decision-making  and 
credibility is the source of programme funding. For exam-
ple,  pharmaceutical  company  involvement  may  be  per-
ceived as a self-interested attempt to expand the market for 
psychotropic  medicine  as  a  result  of  increased  help-seek-
ing,  on  which  stigma  has  a  negative  impact  [2].  Govern-
ment  funding  may  be  perceived  as  affecting  the  choice  of 
targets or methods for a programme; this will be discussed 
later  when  we  consider  interventions  to  reduce  structural 
discrimination.

Anti-stigma  strategies  have  been  categorised  in  terms 
of  education  (replacing  myths  about  mental  illness  with 
accurate knowledge), contact (using direct or indirect—i.e. 
parasocial—interactions with people who have a mental ill-
ness  to  challenge  prejudice),  and  protest  (attempts  to  sup-
press  stigmatising  attitudes  and  representations  of  mental 
illness)  [17].  Education  and  contact  have  been  found  to 
be  the  most  commonly  used.  However,  it  should  be  noted 
that  educational  approaches  vary  widely  in  terms  of  what 
information they aim to convey. For example, mental health 
literacy programmes aim to increase knowledge of mental 
health  problems,  improve  attitudes,  and  stimulate  helping 
behaviours,  [18–20],  while  rights-based  programmes  such 
as  See  Me  in  Scotland  (https://www.seemescotland.org/
our-movement-for-change/change-networks/human-rights/) 
focus  on  the  legal  rights  of  people  with  mental  health 
problems.

Early  anti-stigma  efforts  often  used  educational 
approaches.  For  example,  work  in  the  1950s  by  Cum-
ming  and  Cumming  in  a  town  in  Canada  [21]  attempted 
to  reduce  stigma  through  providing  mental  health  educa-
tion  via  group  discussions  and  films.  Also  in  the  UK,  the 
‘Defeat Depression’ campaign in the early 1990s aimed to 
reduce stigma through provision of information on depres-
sion for the public and professionals [22]. Interventions for 
health  professionals  often  rely  on  educational  approaches 
[23]. Over time, the use of intergroup contact has increased, 
especially  following  a  meta-analysis  by  Corrigan  and  col-
leagues  in  2012  which  highlighted  its  effectiveness  [24]. 
Below,  we  discuss  how  these  approaches  have  been  used 
both  separately  and  together  in  population-level  interven-
tions and those targeted to specific groups.

Anti‑stigma interventions for the general public

At  the  time  of  writing,  there  has  been  a  proliferation  of 
national  and  regional  programmes  which  have  either 
recently  finished  or  are  ongoing.  The  summary  below 
exemplifies  the  state  of  the  art  rather  than  providing  a 
comprehensive  description.  ‘Beyondblue’  is  a  depression-
specific programme in Australia which has been associated

with  improved  public  attitude  and  knowledge  [25],  with 
greater effects associated with greater exposure to the pro-
gramme  [26].  The  ‘Like  Minds,  Like  Mine’  anti-stigma 
programme in New Zealand resulted in reduced overall lev-
els  of  discrimination  [27],  and  there  have  also  been  indi-
cations  of  improved  knowledge  and  attitudes  following 
this work. ‘See Me’ is a national programme aiming to end 
mental  health-related  stigma  and  discrimination  running 
in  Scotland.  When  the  findings  of  cross-sectional  popula-
tion  surveys  of  public  attitudes  towards  people  with  men-
tal illness between 1994 and 2003 were compared between 
Scotland  and  England  (where  no  comparable  programme 
was  underway),  attitudes  in  England  were  significantly 
deteriorating whereas no comparable pattern was noted in 
Scotland where attitudes remained largely unchanged [28]. 
The ‘Hjärnkoll’ programme in Sweden started in 2010; by 
2014,  its  contact-based  strategy  had  achieved  a  positive 
impact  on  mental  health  literacy,  attitudes  and  intended 
social contact with people with mental illness [29].

The ‘Time to Change’ programme in England (launched 
in  2008)  and  ‘Opening  Minds’  in  Canada  (launched  in 
2009) [30] allow comparison of two programmes adhering 
to different frameworks. Whereas the Time to Change pro-
gramme  used  a  public  health  perspective,  defining  stigma 
in  terms  of  problems  relating  to  knowledge,  attitudes  and 
behaviours  [11,  31],  the  Opening  Minds  programme  used 
a  sociological  framework  where  stigma  is  considered 
reflective  of  the  co-occurrence  of  labelling,  stereotyping, 
separation,  status  loss  and  discrimination  [32,  33].  Both 
programmes  were  built  on  evidence-based  approaches  to 
stigma reduction, with an emphasis on contact-based edu-
cation strategies. There were, however, differences in how 
these  strategies  were  delivered.  Time  to  Change  primarily 
aimed to target the general population via large-scale mass 
media social marketing campaigning. The initial focus was 
on  education-based  “myth  busting”,  followed  by  a  focus 
on reducing prejudice and changing behaviours. Addition-
ally,  Time  to  Change  involved  local  initiatives  and  work 
with target groups such as medical students and employers 
[34, 35]. In contrast, Opening Minds did not include a mass 
media  element,  after  a  short-term  media  campaign  sug-
gested  little  or  no  impact  on  stigma-related  knowledge  or 
desire for social distance [36]. Rather, it focused solely on 
intensive, targeted  work with specific target groups  across 
the country—young people, healthcare providers, the news 
media  and  the  workforce—through  grassroots  input  and 
community programmes [36].

Systematic  academic  evaluation  has  been  carried 
out  on  several  programme  components  of  both  Time  to 
Change  and  Opening  Minds,  and  on  the  overall  impact 
of  Time  to  Change  among  the  general  population  and 
among  users  of  mental  health  services  [30].  The  results 
of  these  evaluations  indicate  that  both  programmes  have 

been successful in reducing stigma. In England, following 
Time  to  Change,  benefits  were  observed  in  terms  of  pop-
ulation-level  improvements  in  stigma-related  knowledge, 
attitudes, social distance and reported contact with people 
having mental illness, albeit some of these effects emerged 
slowly [37, 38]. Positive changes were also evident in men-
tal  health  service  users’  reduced  reporting  of  experiences 
of  discrimination  [39].  Population-level  changes  were  not 
achievable  in  Canada  as  the  programme  was  conducted 
on a local level. Evaluation of these local efforts did, how-
ever, indicate positive changes. For example, interventions 
focusing on high school students were generally successful 
in  improving  students’  intended  behaviour  towards  peo-
ple  with  a  mental  illness  [40],  and  similarly,  programmes 
amongst  healthcare  providers  generally  produced  posi-
tive results in terms of their attitudes [41]. The goal within 
Opening  Minds  is  to  replicate  successful  programmes 
nationally; this work currently involves a national scale-up 
underway with the efforts focusing on young people.

Regarding identifying mechanisms of successful stigma 
change,  albeit  Time  to  Change  included  smaller  efforts 
with  a  local  or  target  focus,  the  intended  population-level 
exposure  to  the  mass  media  elements  of  the  programme 
makes  it  impossible  to  examine  the  impact  of  these  com-
ponents  separately.  In  contrast,  Opening  Minds  built  on 
community-based  efforts  only,  which  were  all  based  on 
contact-based education strategies but were heterogeneous 
in nature [30]. This variability has enabled identification of 
how  to  effectively  tailor  stigma  interventions  for  different 
populations [41], and what the effective programme ingre-
dients are [42]. These findings are discussed further below 
in relation to work focused on key target groups.

Anti‑stigma interventions for key target groups

Stigma  reduction  within  specific  groups  can  in  theory 
advance  life  opportunities  for  people  with  mental  illness 
[11, 43]. Target groups have been identified on the basis of: 
high levels of contact with service users (healthcare profes-
sionals),  position  of  power  (law  enforcement  officers),  or 
potential for changing the future (students and young peo-
ple) [43].

Healthcare professionals

Evidence  regarding  anti-stigma  efforts  amongst  health-
care  professionals  has  been  discussed,  for  example,  by 
Henderson and colleagues [23]. Their review identified 16 
intervention  studies  examining  stigma  reduction  in  rela-
tion  to  mental  health  generally  or  specific  mental  health 
conditions  (e.g.  borderline  personality  disorder,  substance 
misuse)  amongst  various  groups  of  healthcare  and  mental 

1 3252

healthcare  professionals.  Most  interventions  were  educa-
tional but examined attitudinal outcomes which were gen-
erally reported to have improved following the intervention. 
Some  studies  also  reported  improved  knowledge,  behav-
ioural intentions and/or clinical competence. When follow-
up  assessments  were  conducted  these  generally  indicated 
that the positive changes had been sustained (e.g. [44, 45]), 
however, only a few studies had examined this.

Two studies had examined internet-based stigma reduc-
tion in relation to mental illness in general. In the first, sig-
nificantly lowered scores for social distance were reported 
amongst Turkish psychiatrists randomly assigned to receive 
an  instructional  email  about  stigma,  compared  to  controls 
who received a questionnaire on social distance [46]. How-
ever,  this  study  did  not  include  any  baseline  measures;  a 
major  methodological  weakness.  The  other  intervention 
comprised  internet-based  education  on  mental  illness  to 
professionals  working  in  long-term  care  facilities  in  the 
USA, following which significant positive differences were 
found  for  all  outcomes  including  measures  of  knowledge, 
attitudes  (stereotype  endorsement),  empathy,  self-efficacy 
and intended behaviour [47].

Face to face stigma reduction training for healthcare pro-
viders was conducted within Canada’s Opening Minds anti-
stigma programme [48]. Thirty-seven contact-based educa-
tion  programmes  were  evaluated  using  a  mixed  methods 
approach,  to  identify  the  key  ingredients  associated  with 
attitude  change  [42];  no  behavioural  measures  were  used. 
Table  1  provides  a  summary  of  these  findings;  multiple 
forms of contact and an emphasis on recovery were identi-
fied as the most critical ingredients.

Police officers

Criminal  justice  professionals  are  another  key  group  for 
stigma  reduction  interventions  [43].  The  deinstitution-
alisation  of  mental  health  services  has  led  to  a  significant 
increase  in  contact  between  the  police  and  those  with 
mental  illness,  and  it  has  been  argued  that  police  officers 
should  be  provided  education  and  training  to  improve  the 

outcomes  of  their  interaction  with  people  with  mental  ill-
ness. Few studies have been conducted in this area, but evi-
dence from two is summarised below.

Pinfold  and  colleagues  [49]  evaluated  a  training  inter-
vention  with  one  police  force  in  England.  Police  officers’ 
(n = 109)  knowledge,  attitudes  and  behavioural  intentions 
in relation to mental illness were assessed before and after 
attending  two  educational  workshops  delivered  by  ser-
vice users, carers and people working in the field of men-
tal  health.  The  results  indicated  no  changes  in  perceived 
knowledge. Also, although the intervention produced some 
improvements  in  reported  attitudes,  the  stereotype  linking 
people  with  mental  health  problems  with  violent  behav-
iour  was  not  successfully  challenged.  However,  a  third  of 
the  participants  reported  positive  impacts  on  police  work 
at follow-up, particularly improvements in communication 
between officers and persons with mental health problems.
Hansson  and  colleagues  [50]  examined  the  effective-
ness of an anti-stigma intervention in a police officer train-
ing  programme  in  Sweden  (n = 120),  through  a  controlled 
pre-post intervention study design with a comparison group 
and  6-month  follow-up  of  the  intervention  group.  They 
found  that  the  intervention  improved  police  officers’  atti-
tudes,  mental  health  literacy  and  intentional  behaviours. 
These  changes  were  generally  still  present  6  months  later. 
The  intervention  was  well  received  amongst  the  trainees, 
and  some  of  its  key  elements  have  been  retained  in  the 
regional police training programme.

Students

A  systematic  review  of  the  overall  effect  of  variety  of 
interventions  delivered  to  student  groups  [51]  identified 
35  studies  (involving  4257  students)  covering  a  range  of 
interventions  including  contact  with  a  person  with  mental 
health  problems,  and  education  via  text,  lecture,  film  or 
role  play.  Narrative  synthesis  indicated  that  live  or  video-
based  contact  with  people  with  mental  health  problems 
were the most effective interventions in improving attitudes 
and reducing desire for social distance. Evidence from one

receive both interventions.

Research on anti‑stigma interventions: the state 
of the art

Several  reviews  using  systematic  search  strategies  and 
either meta-analytic or narrative synthesis together provide 
a  valuable  summary  of  both  the  evidence  for  anti-stigma 
interventions  and  the  state  of  the  art  in  terms  of  evalua-
tion  methods.  Reviewers  have  variously  chosen  to  catego-
rise  interventions  based  on  the  anti-stigma  strategy  [24]; 
medium used [53]; type of stigma and mental disorder [54]; 
and  length  of  follow-up,  outcomes  measured  and  setting 
[55].  While  the  scope  of  these  reviews  leads  to  extensive 
overlap  in  the  papers  included,  this  variety  of  categorisa-
tions makes their results difficult to compare. The various 
terms  used  for  contact  which  is  other  than  direct  face  to 
face contact obscures their broad similarity as forms of par-
asocial contact [56]. We therefore use this term in Table 2, 
which  summarises  the  evidence  from  systematic  reviews 
and,  where  not  covered  by  systematic  reviews,  individual 
studies.

A  narrative  review  [57],  conducted  at  the  same  time 
as  one  of  the  aforementioned  systematic  reviews  [55]  but 
using a broader search strategy, summarised what is known 
about  evaluation  methods  for  anti-stigma  interventions.  It 
was  noted  that  studies  are  heterogeneous  and  commonly 
have  methodological  limitations  (e.g.  weak  study  designs, 
small  samples);  Low  and  Middle  Income  Country  data  is 
notably missing; and long-term follow-up data and insights 
on how improvements can be sustained are needed, as are 
studies  considering  service-user  perspectives  and  dis-
crimination  and  behaviour  change.  Last,  many  national 
programmes  target  both  the  general  public  and  specific 
target groups without control groups, making it difficult to 

Overall,  anti-stigma  interventions  appear  to  result  in 
small-to-moderate-sized effects (as assessed using Cohen’s 
interpretation; [58]), and strategies based on direct or par-
asocial  contact.  At  the  population  level,  evidence  points 
towards  anti-stigma  interventions  resulting  in  improved 
attitudes,  at  least  in  the  short  term.  There  is  also  some 
evidence  for  improvements  in  knowledge.  For  anti-stigma 
efforts amongst specific target groups, interventions based 
on contact likewise seem to result in short-term benefits in 
terms  of  improved  attitudes,  but  there  is  less  evidence  for 
achieving changes in knowledge.

Directions for future interventions and research

Intervening to reduce stigma and discrimination requires a 
long-term, sustained commitment [59]. However, the need 
to  improve  the  evaluation  methods  and  the  interventions 
themselves is urgent.

While  contact-based  education  has  become  the  most 
popular  method  for  work  with  target  groups,  the  evidence 
for  its  long-term  impact  is  limited  [55]  and  there  is  evi-
dence  that  education  is  relatively  more  effective  for  youth 
[24]. To try to increase the effectiveness of both direct and 
parasocial  contact,  closer  attention  could  be  paid  to  exist-
ing  literature  on  intergroup  contact  when  designing  and 
evaluating  such  interventions.  For  example,  Knaak  and 
colleagues  identified  six  ingredients  for  contact-based 
education  with  health  professionals  [42],  without  relating 
these to the ingredients previously identified by intergroup 
contact  theory.  In  contrast,  another  study  [60]  examined 
changing  negative  attitudes  amongst  students  towards  a 
confederate classified as a ‘former mental patient’, with an 
approach  explicitly  informed  by  Allport’s  theory  on  inter-
group attitudes and contact [61]. Allport’s ‘contact hypoth-
esis’ proposes that for contact between members of in- and

out-groups  to  lead  to  favourable  outcomes  for  the  out-
group  member,  the  two  groups  need  to  be  afforded  equal 
status  during  the  interaction,  and  the  interaction  needs  to 
involve a mutual goal. The study followed these principles, 
and incorporated other conditions identified in existing lit-
erature  as  necessary  for  successful  intergroup  contact:  the 
opportunity  to  get  to  know  the  out-group  member  during 
the  interaction;  interaction  disconfirming  negative  stereo-
type; active co-operation; and interaction including a guid-
ing structure. After co-operative contact activities, initially 
prejudiced students not only described the ‘mental patient’ 
confederate  more  positively,  but  these  improvements  also 
generalised beyond this specific individual to the out-group 
overall.

Intergroup contact researchers in the UK [62] have dis-
cussed the application of intergroup contact theory to men-
tal health-related stigma. This work examined the influence 
of  different  types  of  imagined  contact  with  people  with 
schizophrenia, and concluded that imagined contact might 
in in this case increase intergroup anxiety (and thus desire 
for  social  distance)  unless  it  was  purposefully  structured 
to  reflect  a  positive  imagined  contact  experience.  When 
designing  anti-stigma  interventions,  it  is  therefore  impor-
tant  to  consider  what  factors  mediate  the  effectiveness  of 
intergroup  contact-based  strategies.  A  meta-analysis  of 
over  500  studies  [63]  confirmed  that  contact  can  dimin-
ish  prejudice  through  resulting  in  reduced  anxiety  about 
contact,  and  increased  empathy  and  perspective  taking.  A 
further  key  factor  was  enhanced  knowledge  regarding  the 
outgroup, however, the mediational value of this influence 
was  weaker  than  that  of  reduced  anxiety  and  increased 
empathy.  More  recently,  the  importance  of  threats,  both 
realistic  and  symbolic,  perceived  by  one  group  about  the 
other  have  been  identified  as  important  mediators  [56]. 
Realistic  threats  include  that  of  violence  or  loss  of  access 
to  resources  as  a  result  of  increased  contact  with  another 
group; symbolic threats are those to the values and beliefs 
of a group.

These  mediators  should  be  considered  when  designing 
interventions for target groups. Anxiety and perceived real-
istic threat are likely to be high in groups with little prior 
contact  or  knowledge,  such  as  the  general  population  and 
in particular young people. These were found to be impor-
tant mediators in a study of the relationship between con-
tact  and  desired  avoidance  among  students  [64].  On  the 
other  hand,  groups  with  frequent  contact  are  unlikely  to 
have high levels of anxiety. Studies of stigma among health 
professionals  have  been  suggested  to  show  that  clinical 
contact may not reduce stigma, however the circumstances 
of  the  contact  have  rarely  been  examined  in  relationship 
to  intergroup  contact  theory.  Equal  status  is  not  typical  in 
clinical encounters with health professionals but is impor-
tant for contact to succeed [65]. Intergroup contact theory 

likewise highlights the importance of stereotype disconfir-
mation and acquaintanceship; aspects which may be harder 
to achieve when mental health professionals see only those 
most  severely  affected  by  mental  illness  and  at  the  times 
when  they  are  most  ill,  and  over  short  periods  of  time. 
Loss  of  empathy,  for  example  due  to  short  term  stress  or 
longer term burnout [66], may be a relatively more impor-
tant  mediator  in  this  and  other  groups  with  contact  under 
circumstances  which  are  not  ideal,  such  as  emergency 
services  personnel.  Further,  the  type  of  knowledge  which 
is  effective  may  vary  depending  on  the  target  group.  Bio-
logical knowledge has been suggested as potentially having 
a  positive  effect  on  doctors’  attitudes  [67],  while  a  meta-
regression of public attitudes surveys suggested that agree-
ment with biological causal explanations of mental illness 
among  the  general  population  may  have  a  negative  effect 
[68].

A  warning  note  to  programmes  planning  or  delivering 
contact-based  interventions  regards  a  possible  unintended 
consequence, namely lack of progress in addressing struc-
tural  discrimination.  Anti-stigma  programmes  may  try  to 
target  structural  level  discrimination  through  inclusion  of 
target  groups  such  as  employers  or  health  professionals. 
However, governmental funders of anti-stigma programmes 
may  prefer  to  pay  for  contact  and  educational  interven-
tions with the aim of reducing interpersonal stigma rather 
than face the possible financial implications of addressing 
structural  discrimination;  likewise,  stakeholders  such  as 
employers may prefer to receive interpersonal stigma inter-
ventions. While providing contact-based education may be 
effective in improving the experience of people with mental 
health problems either as employees or service users, there 
is a danger that this results in reduced attention and effort 
in  relation  to  structural  change  [56].  Measuring  structural 
discrimination  is  complex  but  a  number  of  approaches 
have been recently reviewed along with the evidence for its 
impact and the effects of addressing it [69].

The  effectiveness  of  intergroup  contact  is  exploited  by 
anti-stigma  programmes  in  several  ways.  For  those  with 
no  familiarity,  they  provide  parasocial  contact.  They  may 
also  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  pre-existing  face  to  face 
contact  through  familiarity  with  a  friend,  relative  or  col-
league;  raising  awareness  or  increasing  mental  health  lit-
eracy  may  cause  people  to  realise  they  know  someone 
with  a  mental  health  problem,  and  the  existence  of  such 
campaigns  reflects  institutional  support  for  this  contact, 
an important ingredient for successful contact [61]. Strate-
gies such as Time to Change’s ‘Time to Talk Day’ (http://
www.time-to-change.org.uk/timetotalkday)  may  encourage 
extended contact, that is, the effect of having a friend who 
knows someone with a mental illness. Extended contact has 
been  shown  to  be  associated  with  lower  prejudice  regard-
ing other groups [56]. However, the influence of extended 

1 3Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol (2017) 52:249–258 

255

contact  also  has  potentially  negative  consequences.  Selec-
tive description of people with mental illnesses or of events 
involving  them  such  as  by  health  professionals  or  emer-
gency  services  personnel  may  act  to  confirm  stereotypes, 
for  example  anecdotes  of  violent  incidents  or  severe  disa-
bility. On the other hand, these professionals are also poten-
tial  anti-stigma  agents  through  extended  contact  should 
they give others a more balanced view of their work. To our 
knowledge,  this  potential  has  not  so  far  been  exploited  by 
anti-stigma programmes.

We identify three further means to maximise the effec-
tiveness  of  interventions  for  target  groups.  First,  prepara-
tory  work  can  increase  the  understanding  of  the  target 
group and the context of their contact with the stigmatised 
group [70], for example using qualitative interviews or eth-
nography  to  inform  intervention  design.  This  can  inform, 
for  example,  the  choice  of  contact  type  between  face  to 
face  versus  parasocial  contact,  which  is  more  appropriate 
in settings in which disclosure poses risks for people with 
mental illness and/or their family members. These methods 
could also elucidate the influences of structural and organi-
sational  level  discrimination  on  individual  level  interac-
tions and the experience of people with mental health prob-
lems [32, 71], allowing the identification of structural level 
interventions. Second, it should be noted that in both Eng-
land  and  Canada,  there  were  gender-based  differences  in 
responses to the anti-stigma programmes, with men report-
ing  less  contact  with  people  with  a  mental  illness  than 
women. As such contact is important for improved stigma 
reduction outcomes, future efforts might benefit from gen-
der-based  approaches  [30].  Last,  those  with  pedagogical 
expertise could be involved to ensure the use of evidence-
based  teaching  and  assessment  methods  when  conducting 
skills training.

Regarding  evaluation  methods,  our  general  design  rec-
ommendations  include:  randomised  designs  for  inter-
ventions  tailored  to  specific  groups;  improved  reporting 
of  study  procedures;  validated  and  appropriate  outcome 
measures  which  match  the  intervention  content,  including 
measures  of  behaviour  and  impact  on  people  with  mental 
health problems; better controlling for confounding factors 
and potential social desirability bias [72]; increased sample 
sizes;  better  sampling  procedures  to  increase  representa-
tiveness, and follow-up data collection beyond the immedi-
ate end of the intervention. Process evaluation to assess the 
context, implementation and mechanisms of action [73] of 
interventions would facilitate the delivery of more effective 
interventions  in  future.  An  example  is  the  process  model 
developed  by  Knaak  and  colleagues  [74].  As  it  seems 
that  short-term  interventions  often  only  have  a  short-term 
impact, the implication is that we need to study longer term 
interventions  and  to  use  the  interim  process  and  outcome 
data to improve the interventions along the way.

Evidence  on  the  long-term  impact  of  longer  term 
interventions  such  as  national  anti-stigma  programmes 
using mass media is hard to obtain; however, it is hard to 
show  a  causal  association  in  these  circumstances.  While 
it is not usually possible to conduct randomised studies of 
population-based interventions, other quasi-experimental 
designs [75] should be considered to examine the extent 
to  which  change  is  attributable  to  the  campaign  rather 
than  to  secular  changes.  Otherwise,  the  use  of  repeated 
surveys  can  be  used  not  just  to  assess  changes  in  out-
comes  over  time,  but  to  examine  whether  the  outcomes 
are  associated  with  campaign  awareness  on  the  part  of 
the target group [76, 77].

The  many  directions  which  could  be  taken  by  anti-
stigma  interventions  and  their  evaluation  make  this  an 
exciting  and  challenging  field.  For  those  working  in  this 
field,  there  is  a  balance  to  strike  if  we  are  to  better  iden-
tify  effective  and  replicable  interventions.  On  one  hand, 
we  must  acknowledge  that  the  goals  of  those  who  deliver 
programmes  and  those  who  evaluate  them  overlap  only 
partially; while evaluators want to find positive results they 
must  work  independently  so  that  their  results  are  credible 
and informative. On the other, collaboration is essential if 
we  are  to  realise  the  potential  of  developing  and  applying 
theory-based interventions and evaluation designs.
