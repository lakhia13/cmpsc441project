Editorial on the Research Topic
Mental-health-related stigma and discrimination: Prevention, role, and
management strategies

Stigmatizing attitudes toward patients suﬀering from mental illnesses and their caregivers,
psychotropic medications, mental health institutions and stakeholders, remain a common public
health concern, with major repercussions across countries and cultures worldwide (1). Indeed,
a negative attitude toward mental health can lead to avoiding approaching mental health
providers, delaying timely diagnosis, poor treatment adherence, and worst disease prognosis and
patients’ quality of life (2). This phenomenon is particularly evident, but not limited, to patients
suﬀering from mental disorders and has ampliﬁed following the COVID-19 pandemic (3–6).

In the Research Topic entitled “Mental-Health-Related Stigma and Discrimination:
Prevention, Role, and Management Strategies,” we collected 15 articles discussing several aspects
of mental-health-related stigma and discrimination from diﬀerent perspectives and countries,
with a particular focus on strategies tackling them. Our editorial aims to summarize their
key-points and invite the audience to read this collection.

Several articles highlight the role of psychiatric stigma amongst medical students from
various perspectives and how this negative attitude could impact patients with mental illness,
particularly those aﬀected by challenging diseases such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
Movahedi et al. assessed the attitudes of Iranian specialty trainees, who are frontliners dealing
with this group of patients, toward providing psychiatric services to patients and their families.
They conclude that internal medicine and cardiology residents have more stigmatizing attitudes
while psychiatric residents show a more positive behavior toward their patients. In another study
conducted in Iran, Zare-Bidaki et al. evaluated the eﬀect of virtual reality on stigma, empathy,
and knowledge of medical students toward patients with psychotic disorders. They concluded
that this novel tool can be a potential eﬀective instrument in decreasing stigma and increasing
empathy and knowledge among medical students (Zare-Bidaki et al.). Moreover, Rezvanifar
et al. introduced an educational package for improving the attitude of medical students toward
patients with mental disorders based on a scoping review and an expert consensus conducted
through a Delphi panel. The developed package contained four interactive interventions: (1)

showing a movie and discussing it, (2) implementing psychiatric
training including contact with patients living with psychiatric
disorders, (3) adopting social communication with patients with
psychiatric disorders, and (4) setting up a group discussion
on deﬁning stigma and personal experiences (Rezvanifar et al.).
Moreover, Mohebbi et al. performed a systematic review to determine
Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) medical students’ attitudes toward
psychiatry, concluding that EMR medical students generally have
positive attitudes and predispositions toward the ﬁeld. On the
other hand, Porfyri et al. studied stigma among Greek healthcare
professionals and reported that, despite the high level of familiarity,
the employees displayed a rather poor willingness to interact with
patients with mental
illness, and endorsed signiﬁcant prejudice
toward them.

Another group of articles investigated mental-health-related
stigma among some inﬂuential groups in societies, and which
interventions may improve their attitudes toward patients. Taghva
et al. performed a two-day training workshop to improve the attitude
of clergymen toward patients with mental disorders. Findings showed
that the awareness and attitude of ecclesiastics toward mental health
and its consequential stigma were relatively good, and signiﬁcantly
improved upon holding the workshop (Taghva et al.). In addition,
Eissazade et al. investigated the attitude of a group of Iranian theater
artists toward patients with mental disorders, as well as their own
mental health. Participants’ strongest fears were to allow an individual
with a severe mental disorder to take care of their children and
the possibility of patients in this group to obtain a hunting license.
Twenty-ﬁve percent of participants were at risk of moderate to severe
anxiety, and 17.3% participants were at risk of moderate to severe
depression (Eissazade et al.).
Several other articles

investigated stigma among general
populations, as well as some strategies to ﬁght this issue. Ruiz
et al. reported ﬁndings of a survey on stigma among university
students in Valencia, Spain. They found that women show fewer
stigmatizing attitudes than men but similar stereotypes and prejudice
toward people with mental disorders. The survey as also found
students of medicine, psychology, and teaching to have fewer
stigmatizing attitudes than students of economics and data science,
but diﬀerences between degrees were more subtle in terms of
stereotypes and prejudice toward people with mental disorders
(Ruiz et al.). In an opinion piece, Saboury Yazdy et al. shared their
experience using a smartphone application called “Be my Voice” to
break social stigma against domestic violence in Iran. Sawaguchi
et al. reported their ﬁndings on COVID-19-related stigma and its
relationship with mental wellbeing using a cross-sectional analysis of
a cohort study in Japan. They concluded that people aged ≥ 70 years
are more likely to exhibit COVID-19-related stigma. Additionally,
the results indicate that COVID-19-related stigma negatively impacts
quality of life secondary to the underlying psychological distress
(Sawaguchi et al.).

Two other articles focused on the relationship between stigma
and suicide as a major public mental health problem. In a perspective
piece, Shoib et al. raised concerns on the relationship between suicide,

stigma, and COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries. The
article particularly addresses the potential link between social stigma
and suicide in the wake of the current coronavirus pandemic and
proposes some practical ideas for reducing mental-health-related
stigma (Shoib et al.). Masoomi et al. in another perspective piece, also
raised the issue of stigma as a barrier to suicide prevention strategies
in Iran.

Two other publications evaluated psychometric properties of
stigma-related questionnaires. Dinmohammadi et al. evaluated
psychometric properties of the Self-Stigma Inventory for Iranian
families of persons who use drugs, and concluded that it is a valid
and reliable scale with three factors and 14 items. Additionally,
Burzee et al. re-evaluated Stuart’s Police Oﬃcer Stigma Scale and
their ﬁndings imply that this scale is reliable but needs to include two
components rather than one.

Last but not the least, de Filippis et al. performed a clinical study
on internalized-stigma and dissociative experiences in a sample of
patients aﬀected by bipolar disorder in a clinical outpatient setting in
Catanzaro, Italy. Their ﬁndings suggest that self-stigma is associated
with dissociative symptoms, reducing overall quality of life. Thus,
authors recommended the early identiﬁcation of at-risk patients with
previous lifetime abuse and high perceived stigma, which could lead
the way for an ever more precise tailoring of treatment management
in bipolar disorder (de Filippis et al.).

All

in all,

the articles collected in this Research Topic
reemphasize the importance of mental-health-related stigma as a
major public health issue. Due to ongoing substantial research
in this ﬁeld, “Community Series in Mental-Health-Related Stigma
and Discrimination: Prevention, Role, and Management Strategies –
Volume II” has been launched for further submissions and we are
looking forward to continue exploring this topic.
