ABSTRACT
Objectives  To identify the prevalence, methods, 
associations and reported reasons for self- harm 
among in- school and street- connected adolescents in 
Ghana.
Design  A cross- sectional survey. We applied multi- 
level regression models and model- based cluster 
analysis to the data.
Setting  Three contexts in the Greater Accra region 
were used: second cycle schools, facilities of charity 
organisations and street census enumeration areas 
(sleeping places of street- connected adolescents, 
street corners, quiet spots of restaurants, markets, 
train and bus stations, and lorry and car parks).
Participants  A regionally representative sample 
of 2107 (1723 in- school and 384 street- connected) 
adolescents aged 13–21 years.
Outcome measures  Participants responded to a 
structured self- report anonymous questionnaire 
describing their experience of self- harm and eliciting 
demographic information and social and personal 
adversities.
Results  The lifetime prevalence of self- harm 
was 20.2% (95% CI 19.0% to 22.0%), 12- month 
prevalence was 16.6% (95% CI 15.0% to 18.0%) 
and 1- month prevalence was 3.1% (95% CI 2.0% to 
4.0%). Self- injury alone accounted for 54.5% episodes 
and self- poisoning alone for 16.2% episodes, with 
more than one method used in 26% of episodes. 
Self- cutting (38.7%) was the most common form of 
self- injury, whereas alcohol (39.2%) and medications 
(27.7%) were the most commonly reported means of 
self- poisoning. The factors associated with self- harm 
were interpersonal: conflict with parents (adjusted 
OR (aOR)=1.87, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.81), physical abuse 
victimisation (aOR=1.69, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.47), 
difficulty in making and keeping friends (aOR=1.24, 
95% CI 0.85 to 1.80), sexual abuse victimisation 
(aOR=1.21, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.87) and conflict between 
parents (aOR=1.07, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.56).
Conclusions  Self- harm is a significant public health 
problem among in- school and street- connected 
adolescents in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Its 
origins are very largely in social and familial adversity, 
and therefore prevention and treatment measures 
need to be focused in these areas.

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► A larger sample of greater diversity and more het-
erogeneity  in  exposures  than  any  previous  study 
related to self- harm in Ghana.

 ► First primary study from Africa to include in- school 
and  street- connected  adolescents  in  an  integrated 
way.

 ► We measured self- harm using a single item on the 
questionnaire, and its associated risks were similar-
ly unelaborated.

 ► Over- representation  of  the  school  sample  (81.8%) 
compared with the street- connected sample (18.2), 
is likely to have skewed the findings of the statistical 
modelling.

 ► Cross- sectional design precluded causal interpreta-

tion of findings.

INTRODUCTION
There  is  no  universally  accepted  definition 
of  self- harm.  This  study  follows  the  WHO’s 
definition:

‘an  act  with  non- fatal  outcome  in  which 
an individual deliberately initiates a non- 
habitual behaviour, that without interven-
tion from others will cause self- harm, or 
deliberately ingests a substance in excess 
of the prescribed or generally recognised 
therapeutic  dosage,  and  which  is  aimed 
at  realising  changes  that  the  person  de-
sires  via  the  actual  or  expected  physical 
consequences’.1 2

Self- harm  among  adolescents  has  received 
little  research  attention  in  low- income  and 
middle- income  countries3–5;  much  of  our 
understanding comes from research in high- 
income  contexts  (the  UK,  the  Oceania  and 
North  America),  where  self- harm  is  associ-
ated  with  many  negative  health  outcomes 
including  suicide.6  7  Recent  reports  of 
Global  Burden  of  Disease  have  underscored

self- harm  as  an  emerging  non- communicable  disorder 
with  a  strong  link  to  suicide  in  low- income  and  middle- 
income countries, including those in Africa.8

Our  recent  systematic  review  found  a  12- month  prev-
alence  of  16.9%  for  self- reported  self- harm  among 
adolescents  in  sub- Saharan  Africa.5  Factors  associated 
with  self- harm  were  depression,  hopelessness,  psychi-
atric illness, conflict with parents, physical and emotional 
abuse  in  the  family,  academic  failure,  romantic  rela-
tionship  problems  and  lack  of  social  support.  Although 
adolescents  generally  reported  diverse  methods  of  self- 
harm,  clinical  samples  of  adolescents  predominantly 
reported  overdose  of  medication  whereas  adolescents 
in the community mostly reported self- cutting. However, 
the  majority  of  the  studies  reviewed  were  conducted  in 
South  Africa:  we  found  no  study  on  self- harm  in  non- 
clinical  adolescent  samples  from  Ghana.5  The  present 
study describes a cross- sectional self- report questionnaire 
survey  that  is  novel  in  reporting  results  from  in- school 
and  street- connected  adolescents  in  the  Greater  Accra 
region of Ghana.

Aim and research questions
We  wanted  to  estimate  the  self- reported  prevalence 
and  describe  some  of  the  common  sociodemographic 
factors  and  life  events  associated  with  self- harm  in  two 
non- clinical  adolescent  populations  (in- school  and 
street- connected  adolescents:  the  present  study  adopts 
the definition of street- connected adolescents provided 
by  Ghana’s  Department  Social  Welfare  and  collabora-
tors:  a  young  person  who  is  aged  between  10  and  25 
years, is born on the street and lives with parent(s) on 
the  street;  migrated  to  the  street  or  is  an  urban  poor 
child  or  street  mother  who  survives  working  in  the 
street.  Department  of  Social  Welfare  (DSW),  Ricerca  e 
Cooperazione, Catholic Action for Street Children, et al. 
Census on street children in the Greater Accra region, 
Ghana. Accra, Ghana: DSW, 2011.) in the Greater Accra 
region of Ghana. Our research questions were, for these 
populations:
1.  What  is  the  self- reported  lifetime,  12- month  and 

1- month prevalence of self- harm?
2.  What are the methods of self- harm?
3.  What reasons do adolescents report for their self- harm?
4.  Which sociodemographic factors and life events are as-

sociated with self- harm?

5.  Are  adolescents  (in  this  study,  we  define  adolescents 
as young persons aged between 10 and 25 years) who 
self- harm  a  homogenous  group,  in  terms  of  certain 
common  sociodemographic  factors  and  negative  life 
events?

METHODS
We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Obser-
vational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommen-
dations to design, conduct and report this cross- sectional 
study.9

Design
Cross- sectional  survey  design  involving  the  use  of  an 
anonymous self- report questionnaire.10

Setting
Three  contexts  in  the  Greater  Accra  region  were  used: 
selected  second  cycle  schools  (the  system  of  education 
in  Ghana  is  organised  in  three  progressive  levels:  basic 
education, second cycle education and tertiary education. 
Basic  education  comprises  basic  schools—kindergarten, 
primary  schools  and  junior  high  schools;  second  cycle 
education takes place in second cycle schools (i.e., senior 
high schools, technical and vocational schools and busi-
ness schools) and tertiary education involves universities, 
polytechnics and training colleges. Ghana Education Act: 
Act  778  of  Ghana,  2008.  Accra,  Ghana:  Assembly  Press; 
2008),  facilities  of  charity  organisations,  and  selected 
street  census  enumeration  areas  where  the  survey  was 
administered  at  the  work  and  sleeping  places  of  street- 
connected adolescents, on street corners, in quiet spots of 
restaurants, markets, train and bus stations, and in lorry 
and car parks.

Population and study sample
For a priori study sample size determination, the total size 
of the population of interest in the Greater Accra region 
was  taken  as  the  sum  of  second  cycle  school  students 
(n=79 297)  reported  by  the  Ghana  Education  Service, 
and  the  total  number  of  street- connected  children  and 
youth reported in the latest official census report for the 
Greater Accra region (n=61 482).11 12 We used a formula 
by  Krejcie  and  Morgan  to  derive  a  sample  size  of  2360, 
plus 5% (n=118) to provide for non- response or missing 
data.13 14 This sample size (n=2478) was large enough to 
allow  for  reasonable  precision  in  prevalence  estimates 
and logistic regression modelling.15 16

Sampling and procedure
Stratified random sampling was used to identify a school- 
based sample, with random sampling within facilities for 
the homeless and street connected adolescents. Details of 
sampling and questionnaire administration are provided 
in online supplemental eAppendix1, eFigure 1 and eTable 
1. The completion of the questionnaire lasted between 22 
and 45 min. The data collection took place between May 
and September 2017.

Measures
Exposures
Sociodemographic variables and lifestyle factors
Participants were asked 19 questions assessing their social 
and demographic backgrounds and lifestyles factors, for 
example, age, sex (female or male), living arrangement, 
alcohol use, family structure and sexual orientation (see 
online supplemental eTable 2).

Negative life events
Participants were asked categorical questions (24 items) 
about negative life events and social adversities occurring 

Quarshie EN- B, et al. BMJ Open 2021;11:e041609. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041609during the previous 12 months—in the family and school 
contexts  and  within  other  interpersonal  relationships 
outside  the  family  and  school  environment.  The  items 
were  mainly  adapted  from  the  Child  and  Adolescent 
Self- harm  in  Europe  (CASE)  studies,17  and  the  2012 
WHO–Global  School- based  Student  Health  Survey  in 
Ghana.18  For  example,  conflict  with  parents,  parental 
divorce, bullying victimisation, sexual abuse victimisation, 
breakup and knowledge about a friend’s suicide (online 
supplemental  eTable  2  provides  the  list  of  all  exposure 
variables and specific survey questions asked).

Outcomes
Self-harm prevalence
For lifetime self- harm prevalence, we asked participants a 
binary response- rated question (coded No (0) or Yes (1)): 
“Have  you  ever,  actually,  intentionally  harmed  yourself 
(eg,  cutting,  burning  or  poisoning  yourself,  or  tried  to 
harm yourself in some other way, for example, hanging, 
jumping from height, etc)”. Similarly, to assess 12- month 
self- harm  prevalence,  participants  were  asked  a  dichot-
omous  response- rated  question  (coded  No  (0)  or  Yes 
(1)):  “Have  you,  actually,  intentionally  harmed  yourself 
(eg,  cutting,  burning  or  poisoning  yourself,  or  tried  to 
harm yourself in some other way, for example, hanging, 
jumping from height, etc) during the past 12 months?”

Self-harm methods
Participants  responded  to  a  checklist  of  16  frequently 
reported  methods  of  self- injury  and  self- poisoning 
methods  adopted  from  various  sources—the  CASE 
studies17; the Self- Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Inter-
view19 and the Suicide Attempt Self- Injury Interview.20 For 
example, medications, drugs, burning, cutting, stabbing, 
suffocating,  jumping  from  a  height  and  so  on.  Notably, 
in keeping with the principle of parsimony and for ease 
of readership and interpretability of results, we dichoto-
mised reported reasons for self- harm into self- injury and 
self- poisoning.

Reported reasons/motivations for last episode of self-harm
As  shown  in  the  ‘Results’  section  (‘Stated  Reasons  for 
last Episode of Self- Harm’), we also provided a checklist 
of  15  frequently  reported  reasons/motivations  for  self- 
harm, adopted from the CASE studies17 and the WHO/
EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour.21 22 The 
last section of the questionnaire had one project- specific 
open- ended question regarding the adolescents’ opinions 
about what roles young people, families, friends, schools, 
organisations and government could play to prevent self- 
harm among adolescents in Ghana.

Repetition/frequency of self-harm in the previous 12 months
Participants were asked to provide their best estimate in 
response  to  the  question,  “During  the  past  12  months 
how many times have you, actually, intentionally harmed 
yourself  (eg,  cutting,  burning  or  poisoning  yourself,  or 
tried  to  harm  yourself  in  some  other  way,  for  example, 
hanging, jumping from height, etc)?”

Open access

The  questionnaire  was  in  English,  the  lingua  franca, 
language of instructions in schools and official language 
in  Ghana.  The  questionnaire  was  expert- reviewed  in 
Ghana prior to administration to the participants.

Statistical tools and analysis procedure
Analyses were performed in SPSS V.25 and the R Statis-
tical  Package  (V.4.0.0).  We  used  the  listwise  deletion 
approach to deal with missing data,23 since missing data 
were <5% of observations which implies that biases and 
loss of power are both likely to be inconsequential, partic-
ularly,  for  regression  models.23  24  Online  supplemental 
eTable 2 shows the list of variables included in the anal-
ysis,  proportions  of  missing  data  and  the  coding  and 
re- coding of variables for the analyses.

Ages  15  and  17  years  were  used  as  cut- off  points  to 
re- categorise ‘age’ into three groups: 13–15 years, 16–17 
years and 18–21 years. In Ghana, persons aged 16 years 
or older can give sexual consent,25 whereas persons aged 
18  years  or  older  are  legally  considered  adults  who  can 
marry and qualify to vote in national elections.

In  all,  there  were  24  negative  events  included  in  the 
study. Since self- harm in adolescents has been associated 
with the combination of multiple negative life events,26–28 
an  additional  variable,  ‘total  negative  life  events’  was 
created  by  taking  the  sum  of  all  individual  negative  life 
events  endorsed  by  each  participant  to  obtain  an  index 
of  the  total  negative  life  events  experienced  during  the 
past year. This was further placed into three categories: ≤5 
negative events (coded 0), 6–10 negative events (coded 1) 
and >10 negative events (coded 2); for ease of interpreta-
tion of the results.

After initial univariate and bivariate analyses (see bivar-
iate results in online supplemental eTable 3), multilevel 
logistic  regression  was  used  to  build  models  examining 
the associations between occurrence of self- harm (binary 
outcome) and the exposure variables. Negative binomial 
regression  and  multilevel  negative  binomial  regression 
analyses were used to assess the associations between the 
exposure variables and frequency of self- harm during the 
past 12 months.29 30

Multilevel modelling with random intercept
The data in this study were nested: basically, the in- school 
adolescents  were  nested  within  schools,  and  the  street- 
connected adolescents were nested in the street context. 
Thus, each of the multilevel analyses (multilevel logistic 
regression  and  multilevel  negative  binomial  regression) 
focused  on  two  levels—the  context  (school/street)  and 
individual  level  factors.  The  strength  of  multilevel  anal-
ysis  lies  in  accounting  for  data  nested  within  clusters,31 
thereby  reducing  the  likelihood  of  overstating  statisti-
cally  significant  results,  as  SEs  of  regression  coefficients 
are  not  underestimated.31  32  Negative  binomial  analyses 
were deemed appropriate because the outcome variable 
(frequency of self- harm) was overdispersed, with inflated 
zeros—higher  than  the  mean  of  the  counts  within  the 
distribution.29  33  Over  80%  of  the  participants  in  the

overall sample of this study reported no self- harm during 
the  past  12  months,  a  situation  which  satisfies  the  key 
assumption of negative binomial regression.29 33 Statistical 
significance  in  the  regression  models  was  determined 
using the p<0.05 threshold; we cautiously chose this crite-
rion  in  order  to  avoid  reporting  multiple  possible  but 
rather  weak  associations  when  the  interpretation  of  the 
results is based on CIs.34 35

To determine whether the participants could be differ-
entiated  based  on  profiles  of  sociodemographic  vari-
ables, negative events and self- harm, cluster analysis was 
used.  Clustering  helped  to  identify  distinct  profiles  to 
which participants might belong, hence we may be able 
to  develop  appropriate  interventions  for  each  cluster. 
Model- based  (in  model- based  clustering,  it  is  assumed 
that the dataset of interest contains various clusters with 
different  distributions)  and  non- model- based  clustering 
algorithms,  where  each  cluster  is  described  by  a  density 
function,  were  used  to  explore  various  cluster  solutions 
from  very  few  simple  two- cluster  solutions  to  a  more 
complex six- cluster arrangements, describing further the 
associations  between  exposures  and  self- harm.36  Model- 
based  and  non- model- based  clustering  algorithms  are 
represented through a finite mixture of probability distri-
butions to estimate parameters for each cluster using the 

4

expectation- maximisation  (EM)  algorithm.37  Then  each 
observation is assigned to the corresponding cluster using 
the  maximum  a  posteriori  probability.  This  approach  is 
applied  till  no  further  reduction  in  Akaike  Information 
Criterion  (AIC)  is  achieved.  Variables  possessing  clus-
tering  information  (showing  different  relative  distribu-
tion between clusters) were used in the detection of the 
group structure.

RESULTS
Demographic and background characteristics of participants
In all, 2424 adolescents were invited to participate in the 
survey  (see figures  1–2),  with  2107  completed  question-
naires  included  in  the  final  analyses,  representing  an 
overall  response  rate  of  87%.  Of  the  2107  participants, 
82%  (n=1723)  were  adolescents  in  school  and  18% 
(n=384) were street- connected adolescents. The majority 
of  the  street- connected  adolescents  (53%)  had  been  in 
the street situation for >1 year.

It  was  not  one  of  the  aims  of  our  study  to  compare 
in- school  and  street- connected  adolescents,  but  rather 
to include both in our sample as a way of reducing bias. 
Differences  between  the  two  groups  illustrate  the  likeli-
hood of such bias, and are shown in online supplemental 
eTable 3.

acteristics of the study participants. More street- connected

than in- school adolescents self- identified as employed and 
Muslim and reported that their father had more than one 
wife and they had more than four siblings. Nearly half of 
the street- connected adolescents reported that they lived 
alone or with another person and they endorsed ‘myself 
or other person’ as their primary caretaker.

Prevalence estimates of self-harm
Table 2 shows the lifetime, 12- month and 1- month preva-
lence estimates of self- harm as reported by the adolescents 
in  this  study.  For  in- school  adolescents  the  prevalences 
(15%–20% 12 months and lifetime) were similar to those 
reported  from  high- income  countries,  with  a  predomi-
nance of girls and young women. Lower prevalences were 
reported by street- connected adolescents (lifetime=12.2% 
(95% CI 9.0% to 15.0%), 12- month=9.4% (95% CI 6.0% 
to  12.0%)  and  1- month=1.0%  (95%  CI  0.0  to  3.0%)), 
than  by  in- school  adolescents  (lifetime=22.0%  (95%  CI 
20.0%  to  24.0%),  12- month=18.2%  (95%  CI  16.0%  to 

20.0%) and 1- month=3.5% (95% CI 3.0% to 5.0%)). An 
age  gradient  for  12- month  and  lifetime  prevalence  was 
noticeable for the in- school but not the street- connected 
adolescents.

For  the  total  sample,  the  age  at  first  onset  of  self- 
harm varied between 8 and 20 years, with a mean age of 
14.4  years  (SD:  1.93)  and  a  modal  age  of  14  years.  The 
minimum ages at first onset of self- harm among the age 
groups were 9 years (13–15 years old), 8 years (16–17 years 
old)  and  10  years  (among  the  18–21 years  old).  There 
were no differences in age at onset according to gender.

Methods of self-harm
The methods of self- harm as reported by the participants 
were  categorised  into  ‘self- injury  only’,  ‘self- poisoning 
only’,  ‘other  methods  only’  and  ‘multiple  methods’. 
Results  are  provided  in  table  3.  Self- injury  (54.5%) 
was  commoner  than  self- poisoning  (16.2%).  More 
adolescents  in  school  (58.8%)  than  street- connected

Self- poisoning (only): any one of: alcohol, medications, illicit drugs, poison/caustic substances.
Other method (only): any one of: drowning, stopped required medication/treatment, ingestion of foreign object, starvation, non- reporting of ill health, 
indiscriminate unprotected sex.
Multiple methods of self- harm: simultaneous use of self- injury and self- poisoning and/or other method.
*Denominator for computation=lifetime self- harm frequency.

adolescents  (19.1%)  reported  self- injury,  but  self- 
poisoning was comparable between females (16.7%) and 
males (15.4%), and similar between in- school (16.4%%) 
and  street- connected  (14.9%)  adolescents.  However, 
more street- connected adolescents (38.5%) than adoles-
cents  in  school  (24.4%)  and  more  females  (35.8%%) 
than males (12.3%) reported that they used medications 
as a means of self- poisoning. Alcohol (39.2%) and medi-
cations  (27.7%)  were  the  commonly  reported  means  of 
self- poisoning. Results of the specific means of self- injury 
and self- poisoning are presented in online supplemental 
eTables 4, 5 and 6.

Stated reasons for last episode of self-harm
Reported reasons for the last episode of self- harm were cate-
gorised into intrapersonal reasons such as own thoughts, 
and  interpersonal  reasons  such  as  family  disputes  (see 
table 4). More street- connected adolescents than adoles-
cents  in  school  indicated  intrapersonal  reasons,  while 
more females than males reported interpersonal reasons 
for  the  last  episode  of  self- harm.  The  total  negative  life 
events endorsed by the participants ranged from 0 to 22 
(overall  sample  (mean=6.6,  SD=4.1,  median=6),  school 
sample (mean=6.1, SD=3.9, median=6), street- connected 
sample (mean=9.0, SD=3.6, median=9)).

Notably, 32% of the overall sample reporting a self- harm 
history indicated “I wanted to die” as at least one of the 
reasons for the last episode of self- harm (28% in- school 
adolescents and 64% street- connected adolescents), with 
13% of the participants (11% adolescents in school, 24% 
street- connected adolescents) reported “I wanted to die” 
as the sole reason for the last episode of self- harm.

the null multilevel model with a null single- level model; 
the results showed strong evidence that variation between 
clusters  in  terms  of  self- harm  was  significantly  not  zero 
(LR=61.33,  p<0.001)—see  also  caterpillar  plot  online 
supplemental eFigure 2. In the next step, all the poten-
tial  exposure  variables  were  entered  into  two  models: 
model  1  assessed  the  associations  between  adolescents’ 
sociodemographic characteristics and individual negative 
events, and self- harm during the past 12 months; model 
2 examined the associations between adolescents’ socio-
demographic  characteristics  and  total  number  of  nega-
tive events, and self- harm during the past 12 months (see 
table 5).

Model 1 showed that history of self- harm prior to the 
past  12  months,  non- heterosexual  orientation,  knowl-
edge  about  a  friend’s  attempted  suicide,  having  knowl-
edge about a family member’s attempted suicide, having 
conflict with parents, being physically abused, being in a 
romantic relationship, weekly alcohol use and reporting 
schoolwork  problems  were  more  likely  to  be  associated 
with self- harm. However, having more than four siblings, 
having relationship problems and primary caretaker being 
myself or other person were associated with lower risk of 
self- harm. In model 2, adolescents with non- heterosexual 
orientation, and with any weekly alcohol use, were more 
likely to report self- harm during the previous 12 months.
In both model 1 and model 2, having a history of self- 
harm prior to the past 12 months increases the odds of 
self- harm by 28 times, whereas gender and age showed no 
statistically significant associations with self- harm during 
the previous 12 months.

Factors associated with self-harm: multilevel logistic 
regression analysis
Only  the  multilevel  logistic  regression  analyses  are 
reported  here.31  32  The  participants  were  clustered  by 
school and street contexts. To test the significance of the 
clusters’  effects,  a  likelihood  ratio  test  (LR)  compared 

Associations between exposure variables and frequency of 
occurrence of self-harm during the past 12 months: multilevel 
negative binomial regression analysis
A  LR  test  comparing  the  null  multilevel  model  with  a 
null single- level model showed that the variation between 
clusters,  in  terms  of  the  counts  of  self- harm  during  the

Similar to the findings from the Child & Adolescent Self- harm in Europe (CASE) Study17:
“My thoughts were so unbearable, I could not endure them any longer’, ‘It seemed that I lost control of myself, and I do not know why I did it’, ‘The 
situation was so unbearable that I could not think of any other alternative’, ‘I wanted to get away for a while from an unacceptable situation’,‘I wanted 
to sleep for a while’, ‘I wanted to punish myself’ and ‘I wanted to die’ are categorised as ‘intrapersonal reasons”.
“I wanted to show someone how much I loved him/her’, ‘I wanted others to know how desperate I felt’, ‘I wanted to get help from someone’, ‘I 
wanted to know if someone really cared about me’, ‘I wanted others to pay for the way they treated me’, ‘I wanted to make someone feel guilty’, ‘I 
wanted to persuade someone to change his/her mind’ and ‘I wanted to make things easier for others’ are categorised as ‘interpersonal reasons”.
‘It was the work of the devil’ was categorised as ‘other’ reason.

negative  events,  and  frequency  of  self- harm  during  the 
past 12 months, and model 2 examined the associations 
between  adolescents’  sociodemographic  characteristics 
and total negative events, and the frequency of self- harm 
during the past 12 months.

In model 1, as shown in table 6, having a history of self- 
harm  prior  to  the  past  12  months,  living  alone  or  with 
another  person,  knowledge  about  a  friend’s  attempted 
suicide,  having  one  or  more  alcoholic  drinks  weekly, 
experiencing other negative events, being in a romantic 
relationship, experiencing conflict between parents and 
having  difficulty  making/keeping  friends  were  associ-
ated with higher frequency of self- harm during the past 
12  months.  In  model  2,  female  gender  and  having  one 
or  more  alcoholic  drinks  weekly  were  associated  with  a 
higher frequency of self- harm during the past 12 months.
In both model 1 and model 2, weekly alcohol use and 
having  a  history  of  self- harm  before  the  previous  12 
months showed a statistically significant association with 
higher frequency of self- harm during the past 12 months.

Clustering of adolescents
From  the  various  cluster  solutions  identified  in  the  R 
statistical  package,  the  model- based  three- cluster  solu-
tion  showed  the  lowest  AIC  (the  AIC  asymptotically 
selects  a  model  that  minimises  mean  squared  error  of 
prediction,  hence,  minimises  maximum  plausible  risk 
in  fixed  sample  sizes).  Lower  AIC  value  suggests  better 
model fit.37 38 The final three- cluster solution included 14 
sociodemographic variables (adolescent groups, gender, 
age  groups,  religious  groups,  employment  status,  living 
arrangement,  primary  caretaker,  primary  caretaker’s 
employment  status,  sexual  orientation,  family  structure, 
sibling size, school residential status, in romantic relation-
ship and weekly alcohol use), eight negative events (the 
eight negative events during the previous 12 months were 
conflict with parents, knowledge about a family member’s 
attempted  suicide,  schoolwork  problems,  conflict  with 
friends,  knowledge  about  a  friend’s  attempted  suicide, 
bullied,  physically  abused  and  sexually  abused)  and 
self- harm  ‘before’,  and  ‘during’  the  past  12  months. 

Inspection  of  the  final  three- cluster  solution  showed 
that  these  24  variables  had  higher  density  and  as  such 
provided  a  clear  descriptive  separation  within  the  three 
clusters. Table 7 provides a summary of the characteristics 
of the three clusters.

Cluster 1 (n=837)
All the adolescents were in- school and cared for by one 
or both parents, who were employed. Most of the adoles-
cents were males, aged 16–17 years, not involved in any 
paid work. They were not in romantic relationships, never 
drank alcohol and self- identified as Christian and hetero-
sexual. Fewer than 10% of the adolescents in this cluster 
responded  ‘yes’  to  four  or  more  of  the  eight  negative 
events enquired about during the previous 12 months.

Four per cent of the adolescents in this cluster reported 
a history of self- harm prior to the past 12 months, and 5% 
reported self- harm during the past 12 months. Cluster 1 is 
thus described as a low adversity cluster with low self- harm 
prevalence.

Cluster 2 (n=481)
Predominantly, adolescents in this cluster were in- school, 
aged between 18 and 21 years, self- identified as Christian, 
heterosexual and the majority never drank alcohol. Seven 
per cent identified as street- connected, 1 in 10 lived alone 
or with another non- family member. Regarding negative 
events experienced during the previous 12 months, >10% 
reported: bullying victimisation, conflict with parents or 
sexual  abuse  victimisation;  30%–50%  reported  conflict 
with friends, schoolwork problems and having been phys-
ically abused in the last 12 months.

Fewer  than  10%  of  the  adolescents  in  this  cluster 
reported a history of self- harm during the past 12 months 
(6%)  or  self- harm  prior  to  the  past  12  months  (5%). 
Thus, cluster 2 is described as a moderate adversity group 
with low self- harm prevalence.

Cluster 3 (n=413)
The  majority  of  the  adolescents  in  cluster  3  were 
in- school,  female,  aged  16–17  years,  self- identified  as

Christian and heterosexual and not involved in any paid 
work. Three- quarters lived with one or both parents, who 
were  employed.  Over  25%  of  this  cluster  reported  that 
they had one or more alcoholic drinks weekly and more 
than  half  were  in  a  romantic  relationship.  With  regard 
to  the  negative  events  experienced  during  the  previous 
12 months, more than half reported conflict with friends, 
being  physically  or  sexually  abused,  schoolwork  prob-
lems, bullying victimisation and conflict with parents.

In this cluster, half reported self- harm during the past 
12  months.  Cluster  3  is  therefore  described  as  a  high 
adversity group with high self- harm prevalence.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of self- 
harm (defined without regard to purpose) in a regionally 
representative non- clinical sample of both in- school and 
street- connected  adolescents  from  Ghana.  Overall,  one 
in  five  adolescents  reported  having  self- harmed  in  their 
lifetime—approximately 1 out of 5 in- school, and 1 in 8 
street- connected adolescents. Similarly, 1 in 6 adolescents 
reported an episode of self- harm during the previous 12 
months—approximately 1 out of 5 in- school, and 1 in 11 
street- connected adolescents. The reported prevalence of 
self- harm increased with age, at least among the in- school 
adolescents.

These  prevalence  estimates  are  comparable  to  those 
reported  by  recent  systematic  reviews  of  the  global 
literature  and  add  to  the  evidence  that  self- harm  is  an 
important  global  public  health  problem  among  adoles-
cents.39–43  As  has  been  found  in  other  populations,  the 
prevalence  estimates  were  higher  among  females  and 
older  adolescents.44  However,  a  striking  finding  was  the 
low prevalence among the street- connected adolescents, 
especially  given  their  experience  of  high  rates  of  social 
adversity.

Although  self- injury  and  self- poisoning  were  the 
common methods of self- harm reported, self- injury, typi-
cally  self- cutting,  was  the  most  frequently  used  method; 
alcohol  and  medication  were  the  main  methods  of 
self- poisoning,  with  males  reporting  use  of  drugs  and 
alcohol, and females using medication. Street- connected

adolescents in this study tended to report methods of self- 
harm that involved higher risk of death, and though self- 
harm  frequency  was  lower  in  this  group  they  were  also 
much more likely to report that their last episode of self- 
harm was associated with a wish to die.

We  found  many  associations  with  self- harm  in  the 
previous  12  months,  mainly  in  the  sphere  of  interper-
sonal  adversity,  although 
intrapersonal  reasons  for 
self- harm  (primarily  seeking  relief  from  unbearable 
thoughts) also featured, particularly for street- connected 
adolescents. This difference might reflect greater relative 
levels of distress, as evidenced by the wish to die, coupled 
with the looser social network (family) strictures experi-
enced by street- connected young people compared with 
those by in- school adolescents, where often the interper-
sonal reasons focused on the family. Female adolescents 
reported  more  of  both  intrapersonal  and  interpersonal 
reasons for their self- harm, possibly a reflection of greater 
emotional literacy and an inclination towards the need to 
explain and communicate their self- harm behaviour.45–47
Modelling revealed that having a history of self- harm in 
the preceding 12 months, knowledge about a friend’s or 
a  family  member’s  attempted  suicide,  non- heterosexual 
orientation  and  experience  of  multiple  negative  life 
events were associated with reports of self- harm and more 
frequent  self- harm.  One  possibility  is  that  direct  experi-
ence  of  others  attempting  to  manage  distress  through 
self- harm  provided  a  viable  but  worrying  model  for 
young  people  experiencing  difficult  circumstances.48  49 
Frequency  of  self- harm  was  associated  with  problems  in 
romantic  and  friendship  relationships,  suggesting  that 
difficulties  in  these  areas  make  adolescents  especially 
vulnerable to self- harm.

Cluster analysis suggested three groups of adolescents. 
The  largest  group  was  characterised  by  low  adversity 
and low prevalence of self- harm. An intermediate group 
had  moderate  levels  of  adversity  and  low  prevalence  of 
self- harm.  This  cluster  included  the  highest  proportion 
of  street- associated  adolescents,  who  reported  a  high 
frequency  of  wish  to  die  associated  with  their  last  self- 
harm episode. It is plausible that street- connected adoles-
cents are more resilient, but when coping fails the impact

is relatively greater.50 The cluster with the highest preva-
lence of adversity and self- harm contained more in- school 
older females who experienced multiple negative events, 
were in romantic relationships, used alcohol weekly and 
had a history of self- harm prior to the previous 12 months. 
The  use  of  alcohol  may  reflect  an  additional  means  by 
which to cope with their circumstances.51

Strengths of the study
With  a  larger  and  more  varied  sample  than  previous 
surveys  and  in  securing  street- connected  participants 
from  charity  facilities  and  across  census  enumeration 
zones,  our  study  has  a  sample  of  greater  diversity  and 
more heterogeneity in exposures than any previous study 
related  to  self- destructive  behaviours  in  Ghana.52  53  In 
this study, we did not aim to compare the in- school and 
street- connected adolescents, but to obtain a comprehen-
sive or unbiased sample and therefore less biased view of 
the  problem  of  self- harm  among  adolescents  in  Ghana. 
Comparisons are designed to show the bias that results if 
you only study the easily accessible. For example, as shown 
in  table  2,  the  prevalence  estimates  of  self- harm  were 
substantially  higher  among  in- school  adolescents  (life-
time=22.0%, 12- month=18.2% and 1- month=3.5%) than 
among  street- connected  adolescents  (lifetime=12.2%, 
12- month=9.4%  and  1- month=1.0%).  This  result  (and 
others shown elsewhere in this study under methods of self- 
harm,  reported  reasons  and  associations)  illustrate  the  bias 
that would have ensued by excluding the street- connected 
adolescent  sample.  Given  that  knowledge  and  practices 
related to value systems and sociocultural norms, educa-
tion,  family  life  and  street  living  are  more  similar  than 
different  in  countries  within  sub- Saharan  Africa,5  54  our 
results  can  be  applicable  to  both  the  context  of  Ghana 
and  the  situation  in  other  countries  within  sub- Saharan 
Africa.

Limitations of the study
We measured self- harm through the use of a single item on 
the questionnaire, and any items about risks were similarly 
unelaborated. Non- disclosure of self- harm behaviours in 
anonymous self- report surveys has been reported among 
young people.55 In Ghana, non- heterosexual orientation, 

16

illicit drug use and self- harming behaviours are culturally 
proscribed and criminalised which might have led some 
participants  to  provide  guarded  or  socially  desirable 
responses  to  some  of  the  survey  questions.25  The  over- 
representation  of  the  school  sample  compared  with  the 
street- connected sample, with more adolescents in public 
than private second cycle schools, is likely to have skewed 
the findings of the multivariable modelling.

The cross- sectional nature of this study does not permit 

causal interpretation of the findings.10

The structured questionnaire did not allow for detailed 
exploration  of  the  reasons  for  self- harm  and  especially 
more socially or culturally specific reasons that might lie 
behind  the  rather  high- level  categories  represented  in 
the survey. More detailed exploration of the experience 
of self- harm in Ghana as compared with other countries 
would  be  likely  to  reveal  differences  that  are  concealed 
by the similarities indicated by our findings. Similarly, we 
could not explore why the adolescents chose self- harm as 
an appropriate response rather than another behaviour, 
such as seeking help. Also, we did not assess the mental 
states  of  our  participants  (e.g.,  depressive  and  anxiety 
symptoms  or  disorders),  which  have  been  found  to  be 
associated with self- harm in young people.26

The design of the current study does not readily allow 
for  further  exploration  of  a  number  of  our  findings. 
Friend/family  member  suicide,  which  is  known  to  be  a 
strong risk factor for self- harm in high- income countries, 
was not found to be associated with self- harm in this study. 
CIs around these estimates were wide, indicating limited 
power to answer the question, but risk estimates were for 
the most part not in the expected direction. Also, having 
more  than  four  siblings,  having  relationship  problems 
and  primary  caretaker  being  myself  or  other  person 
were associated with lower risk of self- harm in this study. 
Future research using more robust approaches, including 
carefully  designed  qualitative  studies,  may  be  useful  in 
exploring  personal  and  meaningful  explanations  for 
these findings.

The high response rate in our study is within the range 
of  response  rates  reported  by  previous  school- based 
health  surveys  from  Ghana,42  52  however,  the  ‘captive’

nature  of  school  sampling  and  the  Ghanaian  (and  the 
general  African)  mores  that  young  people  must  submit 
to and obey their parents and respect their elders might 
have created a sense of compulsion to participate, despite 
emphasis that participation was voluntary.54

CONCLUSION
Self- harm  is  a  significant  public  health  problem  among 
in- school and street- connected adolescents in the Greater 
Accra region of Ghana. The prevalence estimates of self- 
harm  are  higher  among  females  and  in- school  adoles-
cents  than  in  males  and  (surprisingly)  street- connected 
adolescents.  At  the  level  of  abstraction  represented  in 
the  questions  asked,  the  reported  reasons  for  self- harm 
are  very  similar  to  those  found  in  other  countries.45  46 
The  implications  for  prevention  and  treatment  is  that 
specialist  mental  healthcare  alone  is  less  a  priority  than 
interventions  aimed  at  ameliorating  social  and  familial 
adversity—mental healthcare services need to be supple-
mented with family/social interventions. Further studies 
are needed to explore the individual, social and cultural 
meanings  of  self- harm—to  inform  evidence- based  inter-
vention and prevention efforts aimed more specifically at 
young people in Ghana.
