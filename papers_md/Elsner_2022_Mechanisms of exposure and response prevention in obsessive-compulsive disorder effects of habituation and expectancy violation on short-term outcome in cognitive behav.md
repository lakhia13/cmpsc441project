prevention in obsessive-compulsive disorder: 
effects of habituation and expectancy violation 
on short-term outcome in cognitive behavioral 
therapy

Abstract 
Background:  Exposure and response prevention is effective and recommended as the first choice for treating obses-
sive-compulsive disorders (OCD). Its mechanisms of action are rarely studied, but two major theories make distinct 
assumptions: while the emotional processing theory assumes that treatment effects are associated with habituation 
within and between exposure sessions, the inhibitory learning approach highlights the acquisition of additional asso-
ciations, implying alternative mechanisms like expectancy violation. The present study aimed to investigate whether 
process variables derived from both theories predict short-term outcome.

Method:  In a university outpatient unit, 110 patients (63 female) with OCD received manual-based cognitive-
behavioral therapy with high standardization of the first two exposure sessions. Specifically, therapists repeated the 
first exposure session identically and assessed subjective units of distress as well as expectancy ratings in the course 
of exposure sessions. Based on these data, individual scores for habituation and distress-related expectancy violation 
were calculated and used for prediction of both percentage change on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale 
(Y-BOCS) and remission status after 20 therapy sessions.

Results:  In a multiple regression model for percentage change, within-session habituation during the first exposure 
was a significant predictor, while in a logistic regression predicting remission status, distress-related expectancy viola-
tion during the first exposure revealed significance. A path model further supported these findings.

Conclusions:  The results represent first evidence for distress-related expectancy violation and confirm preliminary 
findings for habituation, suggesting that both processes contribute to treatment benefits of exposure in OCD, and 
both mechanisms appear to be independent.

(CBT)  for  OCD  proved  to  yield  symptom  reduction  in 
numerous randomized controlled trials [3, 4] and under 
routine  care  conditions  [5,  6].  There  is,  however,  a  sub-
stantial  number  of  patients  who  show  insufficient  treat-
ment  response  or  fail  to  maintain  initial  benefits  [4, 
7,  8],  and  it  is  unknown  why  some  patients  benefit  and 
others  do  not.  Efforts  to  predict  treatment  response  by 
clinical  or  sociodemographic  patient  characteristics 
yielded  inconsistent  findings  [9,  10].  Research  on  neu-
robiology and psychophysiology did not identify predic-
tors  for  treatment  response  [11,  12]  but  rather  revealed 
treatment-independent endophenotypes [13]. As predic-
tion  of  treatment  outcome  by  pre-treatment  variables  is 
limited,  focusing  on  processes  and  mechanisms  during 
treatment may bear good prospects for identifying addi-
tional  predictors  of  symptom  change.  First  approaches 
to  predict  treatment  response  by  fear  extinction  learn-
ing  in  OCD  [14]  are  promising  but  still  rare.  Moreover, 
it  has  been  shown  that  frequency  of  and  adherence  to 
ERP [15–17] is associated with outcome, suggesting that 
the intervention technique itself rather than non-specific 
variables  are  crucial  for  symptom  reduction.  Neverthe-
less, different strategies to augment the effects of ERP, e.g. 
with D-cycloserine [18, 19] or motivational interviewing 
[20], yielded only small effects.

Further improvement appears to be impeded by insuf-
ficient  knowledge  on  mechanisms  underlying  ERP  [21]. 
Two  major  theories  describe  putative  mechanisms  of 
action,  but  empirical  evidence  is  limited  for  both.  First, 
emotional  processing  theory  (EPT  [22–24])  assumes 
that extinction of conditioned associations (such as ‘dirt 
– fatal disease’ turning into ‘dirt – no fatal disease’) is a 
key  component  of  exposure.  In  addition,  extinction  is 
considered to rely on within-session and between-session 
habituation, i.e. the decline of fear or distress within one 
exposure  session  and  across  multiple  sessions,  respec-
tively.  Accordingly,  both  components  are  inevitable  for 
successful  ERP  treatment.  However,  empirical  research 
indicated  that  habituation  may  not  be  necessary  to 
achieve  treatment  benefits  [25–27].  Inhibitory  learn-
ing  theory  (ILT  [25,  28])  on  the  other  hand,  assumes 
that  patients  learn  new  associations  during  exposure 
(e.g.,  ‘dirt  –  no  fatal  disease’),  which  then  inhibit  exist-
ing associations (such as ‘dirt – fatal disease’). Although 
habituation  may  be  involved,  it  is  not  considered  a  nec-
essary  prerequisite  for  learning  [28].  Acquisition  of  new 
associations  is  rather  enabled  by  expectancy  violation, 
i.e.  a  mismatch  between  expectancy  and  outcome  [28, 
29]. An exposure session might thus contribute to treat-
ment success if fear or distress constantly remains on the 
same  level,  but  the  experience  should  involve  some  sort 
of  mismatch  with  prior  expectancies  or  surprise.  Taken 
together,  both  theories  overlap  in  referring  to  Pavlovian 

learning  as  the  major  account  of  explaining  effects  of 
ERP,  but  they  emphasize  different  processes  as  key  fac-
tors of change during ERP.

Habituation  and  expectancy  violation  have  been  sub-
ject  to  a  large  variety  of  experimental  laboratory  stud-
ies  [30–32]  and  clinical  studies  on  phobias  and  other 
anxiety disorders [33–38] and evidence is mixed for both 
mechanisms.  However,  these  mechanisms  have  rarely 
been  investigated  in  clinical  studies  on  ERP  for  OCD 
and  results  of  previous  research  are  conflicting.  Con-
cerning  EPT,  an  early  study  by  Foa,  Grayson  [39]  inves-
tigated the relationship between treatment outcome and 
the decrease of Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs [40];) 
which  served  as  indicator  for  habituation.  The  results 
suggest  a  relation  between  outcome  categories  (“much 
improved”,  “improved”  and  “failures”)  and  both  within-
session habituation (WSH) and between-session habitu-
ation (BSH [39]) with higher levels of improvement when 
stronger habituation was observed. Another study found 
correlations between treatment outcome on the one hand 
and  BSH  indexed  by  both  heart  rate  reduction  across 
sessions  and  SUD  reduction  on  the  other  hand  [41]. 
Yet,  WSH  measured  by  SUDs  and  various  physiological 
parameters  (heart  rate,  skin  conductance  level)  showed 
no  association  with  treatment  outcome  [41].  Both  early 
studies  were  limited  by  a  small  sample  size  (n = 37  and 
n = 14,  respectively)  and  using  averaged  assessor  rat-
ings  but  no  standard  instruments  for  assessing  OCD 
symptom severity. Taken together, early research did not 
consistently  confirm  habituation  as  core  mechanism  of 
action for ERP. However, recent research on contamina-
tion-based OCD with a sample of forty-one participants 
found  within-session  fear  decline  to  be  associated  with 
post-treatment symptom reduction [42].

Other  recent  studies  investigated  habituation  param-
eters  together  with  mechanisms  suggested  by  the  ILT, 
thereby  focusing  on  expectancy  violation.  In  a  study  by 
Kircanski and Peris [43], treatment outcome in childhood 
OCD  was  neither  consistently  predicted  by  expectancy 
violation  nor  WSH.  However,  they  found  that  greater 
BSH  was  significantly  associated  with  improvement  at 
mid-term assessment on the Clinical Global Impression-
Improvement  scale  (CGI  [44])  and  the  Children’s  Yale-
Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (CY-BOCS  [45]).  In 
line  with  these  results,  in  a  more  recent  study  on  child-
hood  OCD  [46],  expected  versus  perceived  post-expo-
sure  SUDs  did  not  predict  symptom  reduction  on  the 
CY-BOCS.  Variability  in  prediction  accuracy  (i.e.,  fluc-
tuations in mismatch of actual vs. expected SUDs), how-
ever,  moderated  stronger  OCD  symptom  reduction.  In 
the two studies sample size was restricted to 35 [43] and 
33 [46] participants, respectively.

In  summary,  surprisingly  little  is  known  about  the 
mechanisms of action that are linked to outcome of ERP 
for  OCD.  However,  theory  based  assumptions  about 
mechanisms influence therapist training and impact how 
therapists  implement  ERP  [26,  47,  48],  entailing  con-
sequences  for  short-  and  long-term  outcome  [26].  For 
example,  therapists  may  wonder  whether  it  is  a  prob-
lem  if  a  patient  does  not  show  habituation  during  ERP. 
Therefore, it is necessary to intensify research on mecha-
nisms  of  ERP.  Specifically,  research  on  clinically  defined 
ERP mechanisms associated with treatment outcome for 
OCD in adults with large sample size is missing.

The present study aimed to investigate whether and to 
what  extent  theoretically  claimed  mechanisms  of  action 
relate to the outcome of exposure-based CBT. Therefore, 
we  defined  selective  clinical  indicators  of  mechanisms 
suggested by EPT or ILT and tested their predictive value 
for outcome in a large sample. In line with previous stud-
ies in OCD [39, 41, 43, 46], we focused on clinical indica-
tors of habituation as well as distress-related expectancy 
violation.  Although  expectancy  violation  is  often  meas-
ured  as  the  discrepancy  between  expected  and  actu-
ally  occurring  events,  we  refrained  from  this  approach 
for  three  reasons.  First,  many  patients  with  OCD  know 
that the events they fear are unlikely (e.g., fire as a conse-
quence of not checking the stove) or do not report feared 
events  at  all  (e.g.,  fear  of  touching  dirty  objects  without 
expecting  illness  or  other  dangerous  events,  disgust, 
or  not  just  right  experience).  Second,  several  concrete 
fears  in  OCD  are  not  testable  during  exposure  because 
they are long-term (e.g., “I will get cancer in  ten years”) 
or  unknowable  (e.g.,  “I  will  go  to  hell  when  I  die”  [49]). 
Third, explicit testing of feared events (e.g., returning to 
one’s  house  to  check  whether  it  is  on  fire)  can  be  simi-
lar to typical compulsions and thus undermine response 
prevention.  Based  on  clinical  characteristics  of  OCD 
(e.g.,  [50])  and  in  line  with  previous  studies  [43,  46],  we 
assumed  that  distress-related  expectancy  violation,  i.e. 
the discrepancy between expected and actually perceived 
distress, is more likely to predict outcome in OCD.

The study was implemented in the research setting of a 
university  outpatient  clinic,  which  combines  a  first  treat-
ment  phase  of  manualized  ERP-based  CBT  and  a  second 
phase of individually tailored CBT which is open to address 
other clinical problems. We hypothesized that both habitu-
ation  and  distress-related  expectancy  violation  individu-
ally predict improvement at the end of the first phase, i.e. 
after twenty sessions. We selected this short-term outcome 
because  its  temporal  proximity  to  the  assessment  of  pre-
dictor  variables  was  expected  to  facilitate  the  detection 
of  effects.  Short-term  outcome  was  measured  in  terms  of 
both symptom reduction and remission status [51], which 
proved to be a clinically meaningful outcome category [6].

Methods
Participants

Study  participants 
received  manual-based  cogni-
tive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  including  exposure  and 
response prevention at a psychological university outpa-
tient unit based at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Ger-
many,  and  were  admitted  between  April  2017  and  May 
2019. Referrals to the outpatient unit were made accord-
ing to routine clinical care procedures. During the study 
period,  454  potential  participants  contacted  the  outpa-
tient  unit  and  321  of  them  fulfilled  the  following  inclu-
sion  criteria  of  the  study:  primary  diagnosis  of  OCD, 
age  between  18  and  70 years,  a  pre-treatment  Y-BOCS-
score of at least 12, and a measured verbal IQ of at least 
85.  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  did  not  speak  Ger-
man,  were  not  capable  of  giving  consent,  suffered  from 
a  neurological  or  organic  mental  disease,  schizophrenia 
or another psychotic disorder, severe depressive episode, 
bipolar disorder, pathological hoarding, substance abuse 
(last three months), borderline personality disorder, or if 
they  took  benzodiazepines  on  a  regular  basis  (last  three 
months).  Ten  patients  did  not  provide  written  informed 
consent  and  another  108  patients  declined  participation 
after  admission  and  before  the  first  therapy  session.  Of 
those  who  declined  participation,  41  patients  were  not 
contactable and 67 patients declined for mostly unknown 
reasons; known reasons were: no more interest in partici-
pation in a research project (n = 2); no more motivation 
for engaging in CBT (n = 3); patients did not see indica-
tion for therapy any longer or do not suffer from symp-
toms anymore (n = 2); inpatient treatment (n = 6); found 
another therapy placement (n = 6); moved to another city 
(n = 2). Thus,  203  patients  participated  in  the  study,  but 
for  56  of  them  the  study  protocol  was  violated  (n = 12 
did  not  meet  the  time  criterion  to  terminate  the  first 
phase  of  treatment  comprising  20  manualized  sessions 
within  maximally  14 weeks,  n = 20  did  not  meet  criteria 
for time interval between the first two ERP exercises, for 
n = 22 therapists did not provide complete formal adher-
ence checklists, n = 1 interrupted treatment due to inpa-
tient admission, n = 1 did not want to engage in exposure 
therapy; see Treatment and Study Protocol) and another 
twelve  patients  did  not  complete  therapy.  135  patients 
received  treatment  according  to  the  study  protocol.  25 
of them had missing data either in the primary outcome 
variable  or  in  one  of  the  exposure  process  variables. 
Therefore,  110  patients  terminated  the  trial  with  com-
plete data (Fig. 1). The final sample (n = 110) and the sam-
ple of participants enrolled but not included in the final 
sample (n = 93) did not differ regarding demographic or

clinical characteristics, however, participants in the final 
sample  had  significantly  more  often  comorbid  mental 
disorders (Table 1).

The final sample (n = 110, 63 female) had a mean age of 
33.8 years  (SD = 10.8).  Eighty-eight  (80.0%)  of  them  suf-
fered  from  at  least  one  comorbid  mental  disorder.  Most 
common  diagnoses  were  current  or  remitted  affective 
disorders and anxiety disorders (Supplementary Table 1). 
At  the  time  of  admission,  62  participants  (56.4%)  were 
free  of  psychotropic  medications  and  48  participants 
(43.6%) took at least one psychotropic medication. Most 
common  medications  were  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants (Supplemen-
tary  Table  1).  During  the  study  period,  most  medicated 
participants were medication stable (n = 40) and few dis-
continued  medication  (n = 8).  Seven  participants,  who 
were unmedicated at admission, started medication dur-
ing the study period.

The  study  protocol  was  approved  by  the  local  review 
board of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (protocol num-
ber 2016-33) and met the criteria of the revised Declara-
tion  of  Helsinki.  All  study  participants  provided  written 
informed consent.

Clinical assessment
Routine  assessment  at  admission   (t0)  included  the  Ger-
man  version  of  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for 
DSM-IV  mental  disorders  and  personality  disorders 

[55]), 

(Y-BOCS 

[53,  54],  the  Yale-Brown  Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale 
interview 
the  Montgomery-Åsberg 
Depression  Rating  Scale  (MADRS  [56]),  and  the  Global 
Assessment of Functioning (GAF [57]). Additionally, the 
Obsessive Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R [58]), 
the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II [59]), the Brief 
Symptom Inventory (BSI [60]), and a Y-BOCS-self-rating 
version  [61]  were  administered  as  self-rating  question-
naires.  Y-BOCS  interview,  Y-BOCS  self-rating  scale, 
OCI-R,  MADRS,  BDI-II,  BSI,  and  GAF  were  repeated 
at  the  time  of  the  first  therapy  session   (t1)  and  after  the 
twentieth  therapy  session   (t20)  in  order  to  assess  the 
course  of  obsessive-compulsive,  depressive  and  general 
psychological symptoms, respectively. To check whether 
OCD symptom severity already changed prior to the first 
exposure,  the  Y-BOCS  self-rating  scale  was  additionally 
assessed immediately before the first EPR session  (tERP1).

All interviews at all assessment points were conducted 
by  trained  clinical  psychologists  who  were  not  involved 
in treatment.

Treatment and study protocol

Treatment  was  delivered  by  21  clinical  psychologists 
(diploma or masters degree) who had additional two- to 
five years formal training in CBT and most of them were 
licensed  psychotherapists  according  to  German  psycho-
therapy  law.  Treatment  consisted  of  a  first  phase  with  a 
largely standardized, manual-based procedure optimized 
to meet study requirements (internally devised lab man-
ual based on [62, 63]), and a second phase of individually 
tailored CBT, which allowed addressing individual needs

like  continuing  ERP  treatment  or  addressing  comorbid 
disorders.  Treatment  termination  was  based  on  clinical 
decisions,  so  that  total  treatment  duration  was  variable. 
For the present analyses, we chose to predict the end of 
the  first  phase  (after  20  sessions),  because  this  period 
comprised  homogenous  ERP  procedures.  Moreover,  we 
expected  to  increase  the  chance  of  detecting  process-
outcome effects if the temporal relationship between pre-
dictors and outcome variables is close and uniform for all 
patients.  Post-treatment  outcomes  (after  termination  of 
phase  2)  are  still  collected  and  are  not  analyzed  for  the 
purpose of this paper.

The  first  phase  comprised  20  therapy  sessions  (50 min 
each) with face-to-face consultations twice a week. In ses-
sion one through eight, mandatory manual contents were 
psychoeducation,  defining  individual  therapy  goals,  and 
conveying  an  ERP  rationale  on  the  basis  of  a  cognitive-
behavioral OCD model emphasizing the role of negative 
reinforcement and prevention of corrective experience by 
avoidance  and  compulsions.  Therapists  were  instructed 
to  refer  neither  to  habituation  nor  to  expectancy  viola-
tion as possible mechanisms of action. Session nine to 20 
were conducted as double sessions with a total duration 
of  100 min,  including  at  least  four  therapist-guided  ERP 
exercises  that  followed  a  gradual,  hierarchically-driven 
course.  In  addition,  therapist  and  patient  planned,  ana-
lyzed  and  monitored  self-guided  ERP  exercises  (con-
ducted  between  sessions)  and  response  prevention  in 
daily routine. Phase 1 had to be terminated after a maxi-
mum  duration  of  14 weeks.  Therapists  indicated  adher-
ence  to  the  study  protocol  by  formal  checklists  where 
accomplished  elements  of  therapy  were  recorded  after 
each session.

Specifically,  the  first  two  ERP  exercises  were  highly 
standardized: The first exposure task was repeated identi-
cally in the second session within one to four days. There-
fore,  assessed  exposure  process  parameters  are  likely  to 
be  comparable  between  the  two  sessions.  The  first  ERP 
exercise was conducted on average at the eighth session, 
but the actual session number varied across participants 
(range  5–15).  The  exposure  task  had  a  medium  level  of 
difficulty as indicated by the participant prior to the first 
exposure  session.  In  order  to  create  this  individual  dif-
ficulty  level,  participants  ordered  different  symptom-
eliciting  situations  hierarchically  ranging  from  0  (“not 
difficult  at  all”)  to  10  (“highest  imaginable  difficulty”). 
Medium  difficulty  was  defined  across  participants  by  a 
level of 4–6. The level of difficulty was not changed dur-
ing  the  two  standardized  exercises,  which  always  lasted 
exactly 45 min. Participants were excluded from the study 
(n = 15) in case no or short fear levels during the exercise 
impeded  conducting  ERP  for  the  entire  duration  as  this 
was a failure to comply with the study protocol. In these 

cases, the exercise was terminated prematurely if an a pri-
ori defined cutoff criterion (SUDs of 0 or 1 over a period 
of at least 15 min) was met. Both ERPs were terminated 
according to the study protocol regardless of the fear lev-
els at the end of the session. No homework or self-guided 
exposure was assigned between the first two ERPs. Ther-
apists recorded several data during both EPRs on a pro-
tocol sheet: immediately before conducting the exposure 
task, participants rated on a 0 to 10 Likert scale what they 
expected  to  be  (1)  the  highest  subjective  level  of  fear  or 
distress  [0 = none,  10 = highest  imaginable];  [40]  during 
the  ERP  task,  and  (2)  the  level  of  fear  or  distress  at  the 
end  of  the  session  (after  45 min).  Moreover,  therapists 
assessed (3) the pre-exposure level of confidence in con-
ducting  the  exposure  task  as  planned  (0 = not  confident 
at all, 10 = most confident). During ERP, therapists asked 
participants  (4)  to  rate  their  SUDs  every  three  minutes 
(minute 0 through 45) on a 0 to 10 Likert scale. Immedi-
ately after the end of the ERP task, therapists recorded (5) 
the participant’s rating on how high fear or distress was 
during  ERP  compared  to  their  expectancy  prior  to  ERP 
on  a  0  to  10  Likert  scale  (0 = much  less  than  expected, 
5 = as expected, 10 = much higher than expected), thus 
assessing  a  direct  self-rating  for  expectancy  violation  in 
both ERP sessions  (EVselfERP1,  EVselfERP2). Moreover, (6) 
participant’s  post-session  confidence  in  conducting  the 
same exposure task again was recorded on a 0 to 10 Lik-
ert scale.

Exposure process variables
Within‑session habituation

We calculated a difference score between the maximum 
SUD  level  and  the  ensuing  minimum  SUD  level  during 
the  ERP  exercise  (4)  in  order  to  assess  within-session 
habituation  (WSH).  A  comparable  operationalization 
was applied before by Foa, Grayson [39] using the change 
between  the  highest  and  the  following  lowest  anxiety 
level  of  the  same  session,  while  other  studies  calculated 
WSH as the difference between the maximum score and 
the  final  score  at  the  end  of  exposure  (e.g.,  [64]).  In  the 
present  study,  the  minimum  SUD  rating  corresponded 
to  the  final  SUD  rating  for  79  patients  (71.8%)  and  was 
lower  than  the  final  rating  for  31  patients  (28.2%)  in 
exposure 1. During exposure 2, minimum and final score 
were  equal  for  82  patients  (74.5%)  and  minimum  scores 
were  lower  than  the  final  rating  for  28  patients  (25.5%). 
As  proposed  by  Kircanski  and  Peris  [43],  we  applied  a 
continuous  measure  of  SUD  levels  in  order  to  examine 
“more  nuanced  fluctuations  in  distress”  [43],  and  there-
fore it was possible to determine the individual minimum 
following  the  maximum  SUD  level.  Thus,  greater  differ-
ence scores represented stronger habituation (minimum 
score  subtracted  from  maximum  score).  The  difference 

Elsner et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:66 

Page 7 of 16

score was applied to the first two standardized ERP ses-
sions,  resulting  in  individual  parameters  for  both  ses-
sions   (WSHERP1,   WSHERP2).  While  the  difference  score 
may be an easy and intuitive way of approximating WSH, 
the  course  of  SUDs  over  time  might  not  be  represented 
appropriately  by  this  score.  As  WSH  was  continuously 
measured  during  the  two  standardized  ERP  sessions, 
more than two data points were available and it was pos-
sible to model individual slopes across the SUD scores of 
an exposure as an alternative predictor of outcome. This 
was not possible for all other exposure process variables 
because  only  two  data  points  (e.g.  prior  distress-related 
expectancy vs. final SUDS score) were available. We cal-
culated  individual  linear  slope  parameters  for  each  par-
ticipant  using  R  linear  mixed-effects  models  package 
nlme [65] in order to create growth curves with random 
intercepts and random slopes for SUDs over time. Nega-
tives slopes represented higher SUD levels at the begin-
ning  than  at  the  end  of  exposure.  Again,  linear  slopes 
were  calculated  for  the  first  two  standardized  exposure 
sessions  (SlopeERP1,  SlopeERP2).

Between‑session habituation

As  an  indicator  for  between-session  habituation  (BSH) 
we  calculated  the  SUD  reduction  from  the  first  to  the 
second  standardized  ERP  regarding  their  maximum 
scores  during  the  exposure  task  (4). Thus,  higher  scores 
represent stronger SUD reductions.

Expectancy violation towards the maximum SUD score

In  order  to  assess  distress-related  expectancy  violation 
regarding  the  highest  SUD  level  during  ERP,  we  calcu-
lated  a  difference  score  between  the  prior  expectation 
towards the maximum SUD level (1) and the real maxi-
mum SUD level during the exposure task (4) for the first 
two standardized EPR sessions  (EVmaxERP1,  EVmaxERP2). 
Positive scores indicated higher expected maximum SUD 
levels  than  experienced  maximum  SUD  levels  (overes-
timation  of  fear)  and  negative  scores  indicated  lower 
expected  than  real  maximum  SUD  levels  (underestima-
tion of fear).

Expectancy violation towards the end SUD score

Distress-related expectancy violation regarding the SUD 
level  at  the  end  of  ERP  (after  45 min)  was  assessed  by  a 
difference  score  between  the  prior  expectation  towards 
the end SUD level (2) and the experienced SUD level at 
the  end  of  the  exposure  task  (4)  for  the  first  two  stand-
ardized  EPR  sessions  (EVend  ERP1,  EVend  ERP2).  Positive 
scores  indicated  higher  expected  end  SUD  levels  than 
experienced end SUD levels (overestimation of fear) and 

negative  scores  indicated  lower  expected  than  experi-
enced end SUD levels (underestimation of fear).

Direct self‑rating of expectancy violation 
towards the maximum SUD score

This  measure  was  assessed  immediately  after  the  two 
standardized ERPs (5), directly resulting in two exposure 
process  variables   (EVselfERP1,   EVselfERP2).  In  these  varia-
bles, higher scores indicated higher than expected SUDs. 
As this was inverse to the direction in EVmax and EVend, 
where higher scores indicated lower than expected SUD 
scores, all EVself scores were inverted (i.e., multiplied by 
− 1).

ERP‑related self‑efficacy change

As  it  is  possible  that  expectancy  changes  during  ERP 
may  also  relate  to  beliefs  about  prospective  events,  for-
mer research recommended to assess coping self-efficacy 
[46]. Moreover, van Hout and Emmelkamp [36] found a 
relation  between  overestimation  of  the  level  of  distress 
during exposure and subsequently increased self-efficacy. 
There  is  also  first  evidence  that  self-efficacy  mediates 
outcome of self-guided ERP [17, 66]. In order to account 
for self-efficacy change (SEC) as a control variable in the 
present  study,  we  calculated  a  difference  score  between 
the  confidence  in  conducting  exposure  as  planned  prior 
to  ERP  (3)  and  the  post-ERP  confidence  in  conducting 
the same ERP task again (6) for the first two standardized 
ERP sessions  (SECERP1,  SECERP2). Higher sores indicated 
an  increase  in  self  efficacy  from  pre-  to  post-exposure 
assessment.

Primary outcome variables

Using the exposure process variables, we predicted short-
term  outcome  after  twenty  therapy  sessions   (t20)  by  the 
time  of  termination  of  the  manual-based  treatment,  i.e. 
the  first  phase.  Primary  outcome  variables  were  (a)  the 
percentage  change  of  the  Y-BOCS  interview  scores  and 
(b) the achievement of remission status from the first  (t1) 
to  the  last   (t20)  manual-based  treatment  session.  Remis-
sion  was  defined  according  to  international  expert  con-
sensus  criteria  [Y-BOCS  total  score ≤ 12;  [51]  without 
applying the CGI Improvement scale [6, 67].

Data analysis

Data  was  analyzed  using  R  version  3.5.1.  While  multi-
ple  regression  is  appropriate  in  order  to  predict  metric 
outcomes, logistic regression can be used to predict cat-
egorial data. Thus, a multiple regression model served to 
predict  the  percentage  change  of  the  Y-BOCS  interview 
score  and  a  logistic  regression  model  was  calculated  to 
predict remission status, respectively. In both regression 
models,  the  Y-BOCS  score  assessed  at   t1  was  included

in  order  to  control  for  pretreatment  symptom  sever-
ity.  Due  to  the  pilot  character  of  the  study,  no  power 
analyses  were  conducted  before  the  study,  but  post-hoc 
analyses  showed  that  the  final  sample  size  allowed  to 
detect  the  hypothesized  effects  with  a  power  of  96.7% 
(multiple  regression)  and  99.7%  (logistic  regression), 
respectively.  We  further  repeated  both  regression  mod-
els including a variable indicating medication during the 
study  period  (n = 47)  versus  no  medication.  In  a  second 
step,  we  selected  significant  predictors  from  the  regres-
sions  and  applied  R  package  lavaan  [68]  to  calculate  a 
path  model  accounting  for  the  temporal  sequence  of 
the  assessed  variables.  Two  further  exploratory  analyses 
were  conducted.  First,  we  explored  whether  the  values 
of  significant  predictors  differed  between  remitters  and 
non-remitters. Second, we investigated whether the theo-
retically  distinct  self-report  measures  actually  reflected 
the  same  psychological  construct.  Hence,  we  conducted 
a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in order to evaluate 
whether parameters of habituation and expectancy viola-
tion reflect a single underlying dimension.

Results
Treatment outcome after 20 sessions

None  of  the  participants  terminated  treatment  before 
the  end  of  the  manual-based  treatment  phase,  i.e.  until 
 t20. However, twelve  patients terminated  treatment after 
only  five  or  less  additional  sessions.  Seventeen  patients 
(15.5%)  reached  remission  status  (Y-BOCS  ≤  12)  until 
 t20.

Average Y-BOCS interview scores significantly reduced 
from   t1  to   t20  with  a  large  effect  size  (Table  2).  Consid-
ering  secondary  outcome  variables  for  OCD  symp-
toms, average Y-BOCS-self-rating scores reduced across 
the  assessment  points,  F(1.79,176.95) = 77.45,  p < .001 
(Fig. 2). On group level, self-rated OCD symptoms were 
not reduced significantly from  t1 to the time immediately 

before  the  first  ERP   (tERP),  t(206.68) = − 0.68,  p = .496. 
However,  there  was  a  significant  mean  symptom  reduc-
tion  from   tERP  to   t20,  t(203.82) = 6.84,  p < .001  and  from 
 t1  to   t20,  t(207.70) = 5.97,  p < .001  (Fig.  2).  Moreover,  we 
observed  a  significant  mean  reduction  on  the  OCI-R 
from  t1 to  t20 (Table 2).

Also,  depressive  symptoms  reduced  significantly  from 
 t1  to   t20  as  indicated  by  the  BDI-II.  However,  MADRS 
mean  scores  did  not  reflect  improvement  from   t1  to   t20, 
(Table  2).  General  psychological  symptoms  as  indicated 
by  the  Global  Severity  Index  of  the  BSI  were  also  sig-
nificantly  reduced  from   t1  to   t20  (Table  2),  and  the  GAF 
increased significantly from  t1 to  t20 (Table 2).

Correlations

Intercorrelations among exposure process variables were 
predominantly  small  to  moderate,  see  Supplementary 
Table 2. Correlations between exposure process variables 
and  primary  outcome  variables  are  shown  in  Table  3. 
Notably, WSH, EVmax and EVend from ERP1 correlated 
significantly  positive  with  the  percentage  change  of  the 
Y-BOCS score from  t1 through  t20, whereas no significant 
association  could  be  observed  for  variables  from  ERP2. 
Regarding  remission  status,  the  only  significant  correla-
tion emerged with EVend of ERP1.

Prediction of percentage change of the Y‑BOCS score

The  multiple  linear  regression  model  with  habituation 
and  distress-related  expectancy  violation  variables  pre-
dicting  the  percentage  change  of  the  Y-BOCS  interview 
score  was  significant  overall,  F(12,97) = 2.24,  p = .015, 
R2 = .217,  adjusted  R2 = .120.  Apart  from  the  Y-BOCS 
score at  t1, the only significant predictor was within-ses-
sion habituation during the first ERP (Table 4). Repeating 
the  regression  with  medication  status  during  the  study 
period did not change the pattern of results and medica-
tion  was  not  a  significant  predictor,  β = − 0.04,  p = .651.

An alternative model with WSH being estimated by ran-
dom intercepts and random linear slopes for time across 
the  course  of  SUDs  during  ERP  was  also  significant, 
F(12,97) = 2.32,  p = .012,  R2 = .223,  adjusted  R2 = .127, 
and  yielded  the  same  pattern  of  results  (Supplementary 
Table  3).  The  two  different  WSH  estimations  correlated 
negatively (ERP1  r = −.61,  ERP2 r = −.71), because neg-
ative  slopes  indicate  a  higher  reduction  of  SUDs  across 
time.

Prediction of remission status

The logistic regression model predicting remission status 
after  20  therapy  sessions  with  the  same  set  of  exposure 
process variables was significant, Χ2(12) = 39.50, p < .001, 
Nagelkerke R2 = .523. As opposed to the multiple regres-
sion model, parameters for WSH did not predict remis-
sion status. Distress-related expectancy violation towards 
the end SUD score (EVend), however, predicted remission 
status  significantly  (Table  5).  Interestingly,   EVendERR1 
predicted  remission  positively  (Odds  Ratio,  OR = 2.03) 
while   EVendERP2  revealed  a  negative  relationship  with

Path model

As the regression models revealed within-session habitu-
ation  and  distress-related  expectancy  violation  towards 
the  end  SUD  score  to  be  significant  predictors  for  out-
comes, we included both exposure process variables in a 
path model predicting percentage change of the Y-BOCS 
score  and  remission  status  at   t20  (Fig.  3).  This  model 
included the same variables as the regression model but 
enabled  us  to  put  them  into  an  appropriate  temporal 
order. All variables predicted the final outcomes (remis-
sion  and  reduction),  but  all  previous  time  points  were 
only  predicted  by  directly  preceding  measurements 
to  model  a  hypothetical  causal  flow.  The  model  fit  was 
adequate  as  reflected  by  several  fit  indices;  χ2(2) = 1.17, 
p = .556;  CFI = 1.00;  RMSEA = 0.00;  SRMR = 0.02  [69]. 
In  accordance  with  the  regression  models,  a  significant 
direct  pathway  from   WSHERR1  to  percentage  change  on 
the  Y-BOCS  emerged;  and   EVendERR1  predicted  remis-
sion status. In conclusion, the effects found in the regres-
sion analysis still held when controlling for their temporal 
succession.

Exploratory analyses

While  remitters  and  non-remitters  did  not  dif-
fer  in  within-session  habituation  during  the  first  ERP 
(t(21.13) = 1.13,  p = .272),  remitters  showed  significantly 
stronger  distress-related  expectancy  violation  towards 
the  end  SUD  level  of  the  first  ERP  (M = 1.76,  overesti-
mation  of  fear)  compared  to  non-remitters  (M = − 0.22, 
underestimation of fear), t(21.2) = 2.89, p = .009.

Conducting  confirmatory  factor  analysis  on  the  vari-
ables   WSHERP1,  BSH,   EVmaxERP1,   EVendERP1,   EVselfERP1 
and 
 SECERP1  revealed  that  a  one-dimensional  CFA 
model  yielded  an  inadequate  fit  (χ2(9) = 39.34,  p < .001, 
CFI = 0.66,  RMSEA = 0.18,  SRMR = 0.11)  with  signifi-
cant loadings only for parameters of expectancy violation 
(Supplementary Table 5).

Discussion
This  study  aimed  to  identify  mechanisms  of  exposure 
with  response  prevention  (ERP)  that  predict  short-term 
outcomes  in  CBT  for  obsessive  compulsive  disorder. 
We  focused  on  exposure  process  variables  derived  from 
emotional processing theory (EPT) and inhibitory learn-
ing theory (ILT [22–25, 28]), and assessed different types 

of  distress-related  expectancy  violation  and  habituation. 
Our  results  indicate  that  both  habituation  and  distress-
related  expectancy  violation  during  the  first  exposure 
have capacity to predict outcomes, depending on the out-
come measure applied.

Regarding  habituation  parameters  our  analyses 
revealed  that  within-session  habituation  during  the  first 
standardized  ERP   (WSHERP1)  significantly  predicted  the 
percentage  change  on  the  Y-BOCS  from   t1  to   t20.  Thus, 
a  stronger  decline  of  subjective  fear  or  distress  during 
the first exposure session was associated with a stronger 
decrease of OCD symptoms after twenty sessions of CBT. 
This  finding  was  consistent  across  two  different  opera-
tionalizations  of  within-session  habituation.  Regardless 
of  whether  the  parameter  was  calculated  as  a  difference 
score  between  the  maximum  SUD  level  and  the  ensu-
ing  minimum  SUD  level   (WSHERP1,  Table  4,  Fig.  3)  or 
whether  mixed-effect  models  were  applied  in  order  to 
extract  random  linear  slopes  of  the  SUD  course  across 
time   (SlopeERP1,  Supplementary  Table  3),  the  first  expo-
sure  within-session  habituation  remained  a  significant 
predictor.

However, neither within-session habituation during the 
second  standardized  ERP  nor  between-session  habitua-
tion predicted percentage change on the Y-BOCS. Taken 
together, these findings are partially consistent with pre-
vious research that found WSH to be predictive for treat-
ment  outcome  [39,  42].  However,  Kircanski  and  Peris 
[43] did not find this association. One possible explana-
tion  refers  to  the  operationalization  of  WSH:  while  Foa, 
Grayson  [39]  applied  operationalizations  comparable  to 
the present study, Kircanski and Peris [43] assessed WSH 
as the decrease in distress across different exposure tasks 
within one session and not within the same task. Further, 
we  failed  to  replicate  an  association  between  BSH  and 
treatment outcome, which has been suggested by earlier 
studies [39, 41, 43]. Yet, we repeated the first ERP identi-
cally in order to assess BSH without possible contamina-
tion by new exposure tasks, which has not been done in 
previous studies. If BSH would indeed be a mechanism of 
action our strictly standardized study setup would be well 
suited to reveal its effect.

Despite  its  predictivity  for  percentage  change  on  the 
Y-BOCS,  WSH  during  the  first  exposure  did  not  pre-
dict remission status (Table 5, Fig. 3). On the other hand, 
expectancy violation towards the end SUD score (EVend) 
in  the  first  ERP  session  significantly  predicted  remis-
sion  status  at   t20  (early  remission,  Table  5,  Fig.  3),  but 
not  percentage  change  on  the  Y-BOCS  (Table  4,  Fig.  3). 
These  results  consistently  indicate  a  positive  relation-
ship  between  remission  status  and  lower  experienced 
than expected SUDs at the end of the first ERP (Table 5, 
Fig. 3). The Odds Ratio of 2.03 (Table 5) indicates that the 
chance to remit early during treatment doubles if the dis-
crepancy between expected and experienced SUDs rises 
by  one  unit.  However,  the  same  type  of  distress-related 
expectancy  violation  negatively  predicted  remission  sta-
tus  if  present  during  the  identical  repetition  of  the  ERP 
task in the next session (Table 5, Fig. 3).

As EVend during the first exposure was the only signifi-
cant  predictor  for  early  remission,  an  overestimation  of 
fear expected for the end of exposure may represent a key 
measure of expectancy violation in OCD: achieving a sur-
prise driven by a lower actual end distress level than was 
expected  might  initiate  learning  mechanisms  connected 
with rapid achievement of subthreshold symptom sever-
ity. However, apparently this must take effect during the 
first  ERP  session  for  when  repeating  the  session  identi-
cally, the same mechanism tends to yield negative effects 
on remission status. This reversal of effects is surprising. 
But the negative association between early remission and 
distress-related  expectancy  violation  in  the  second  ERP 
session  may  be  explained  by  an  overestimation  of  fear 

in the second ERP session that might reflect insufficient 
learning from experience in the first ERP session.

Previous studies on OCD did not find significant rela-
tions  between  distress-related  expectancy  violation  and 
treatment  outcomes.  However,  these  studies  did  not 
apply  expectancy  violation  towards  the  end  SUD  score, 
but measured the difference between expected and actual 
maximum  or  average  SUD  scores  [43,  46].  In  the  pre-
sent  study,  similar  parameters  (EVmax,  EVself )  neither 
predicted outcome, but the difference between expected 
and actual fear levels at the very end of the exposure ses-
sion did. Notably, remitters showed significantly stronger 
expectancy violation towards the end fear level in terms 
of  overestimation.  Hence,  an  overestimation  of  fear 
regarding  the  terminal  point  of  exposure  is  associated 
with early remission.

Taken  together,  we  found  two  significant  predictors 
for  treatment  outcomes  during  the  first  exposure:  while 
WSH  predicted  percentage  change  on  the  Y-BOCS, 
EVend  predicted  remission  status.  Although  these  pre-
dictors  correlate  moderately,  our  models  consider  both 
variables  and  demonstrate  their  differential  capacity 
for  prediction.  In  particular,  a  one-dimensional  CFA 
model  yielded  inadequate  fit  indices,  suggesting  that 
the  assessed  parameters  are  not  indicators  for  the  same 
construct.  In  addition,  our  path  model  suggests  that 
theoretically  distinct  variables  relate  differently  to  early 
remission on the one hand and percentage change on the 
other  hand.  As  remission  appears  to  reflect  more  sus-
tainable change in OCD symptoms [6], it appears tempt-
ing  to  speculate  that  expectancy  violation  is  of  higher 
relevance  for  full  recovery.  However,  it  is  also  possible 
that  initial  within-session  habituation  induces  processes 
of  change  that  are  slower  and  take  somewhat  longer  to 
enable remission. Further insight is expected from future 
analyses of long-term outcome. Considering the present 
results,  we  assume  that  process  variables  derived  from 
both  EPT  and  ILT  are  related  to  outcomes  of  ERP  in 
OCD.

Our  data  further  suggest  an  extraordinary  relevancy 
of  the  first  exposure  experience  compared  to  an  identi-
cal  repetition.  Therefore,  planning  and  conducting  the 
first ERP might be of particular importance, and should 
be  optimized  to  allow  both  habituation  and  expectancy 
violation.  Therapist  might  consider,  for  example,  that 
the  fear  level  expected  for  the  situation  is  high  enough 
to  allow  for  noticeable  violation.  This  may  suggest  to 
omit extensive cognitive interventions prior to exposure 
that  might  reduce  the  discrepancy  between  expected 
and  actual  outcome  and  to  deepen  reflection  about  the 
observed  discrepancy  after  exposure  [28].  Also,  expo-
sure  tasks  could  be  planned  to  last  long  enough  for 

Elsner et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2022) 22:66

habituation  to  take  place,  for  instance  until  fear  lev-
els  have  reduced  significantly  as  it  is  often  suggested  in 
clinical practice. However, our study was not designed to 
investigate how to achieve or optimize expectancy viola-
tion or habituation, respectively.

In this study we focused on clinical indicators of habit-
uation and distress-related expectancy violation assessed 
in  manual-based  CBT  that  can  be  assessed  easily  and 
conveniently  during  ERP.  However,  the  discrepancy 
between  expected  and  actual  ability  to  tolerate  distress 
could  be  an  alternative  measure  that  was  not  assessed 
in the present study. Moreover, the current analysis was 
restricted  to  short-term  outcome  after  a  first  manual-
ized phase of treatment and therefore the results are not 
readily transferrable to outcome at the end of treatment. 
Accordingly, the size of treatment effects was lower than 
the  average  effect  size  of  outcome  studies,  which  usu-
ally refer to complete treatments [3]. Follow-up analyses 
and  future  studies  will  have  to  show  whether  the  cur-
rent  findings  on  outcome  prediction  by  habituation  and 
expectancy  violation  also  hold  for  outcome  assessments 
at  post-treatment  and  follow-up  time  points.  Accord-
ing  to  inhibitory  learning  theory,  expectancy  violation 
is expected to be especially beneficial for long-term out-
comes (e.g., [25]).

Notably,  the  present  study  was  done  under  natu-
ralistic  conditions  and  no  experimental  variation  was 
applied.  While  effectiveness  studies  have  advantages 
regarding generalization of finding to real-world condi-
tions [70], the present study deviates from routine care 
treatment by applying a manual designed to assess clini-
cal  indicators  during  exposure.  For  example,  therapists 
do  not  typically  repeat  the  first  exposure  within  few 
days  in  clinical  practice.  Further,  the  duration  of  ERP 
exercises  is  usually  not  fixed  and  exercises  are  often 
adaptively  changed  within  the  same  ERP  session.  This 
was not the case in the present study because standardi-
zation  appeared  necessary  to  investigate  mechanisms 
of  exposure  and  response  prevention.  Thus,  data  was 
missing for exercises that were terminated prematurely. 
On the other hand, standardization was also limited in 
the  present  study  as  adherence  was  only  controlled  by 
checklist-based  therapist  ratings,  but  not  by  independ-
ent  video-based  ratings.  Additionally,  medication  was 
not  stable  for  all  participants  during  the  study  period 
and  the  rather  strict  study  protocol  yielded  a  relatively 
large amount of missing data due to protocol violations. 
Moreover, the timing of the first ERP varied within the 
range of session five to 15 as a result of skipped optional 
or repeated mandatory manual contents. Despite a mul-
titude  of  potential  influences  on  outcome  even  during 
the  first  twenty  therapy  sessions  in  the  present  study, 

we were able to demonstrate potential impacts of theo-
retically founded clinical indicators by significant albeit 
small  effects.  Of  course,  correlational  data  do  not  per-
mit firm conclusions on causality. However, the putative 
processes preceded the outcome assessment and empir-
ical correlations correspond to theoretical assumptions. 
Nevertheless,  further  research  is  needed  to  investigate 
whether  other  variables  like  adherence,  motivation 
or  therapeutic  alliance  might  explain  the  relationship 
between  the  process  variables  and  outcome,  and  test 
a  causal  relationship  using  experimental  methods,  for 
example  in  randomized  controlled  trials.  The  present 
data  can  help  to  specify  the  target  variables  of  experi-
mental variations.

Although  we  found  a  significant  correlation  between 
expectancy violation and short-term outcome, the study 
might have been limited in detecting even larger effects. 
First,  the  therapeutic  procedures  were  not  optimized 
to  maximally  violate  expectancies  as  suggested  by  pro-
ponents  of  inhibitory  learning  theory  (e.g.,  applying 
multiple  fear  cues  or  a  variable  order  of  exposure  tasks; 
see  [71]).  Second,  we  chose  to  focus  on  distress-related 
expectancy  violation,  although  theoretical  conceptions 
primarily  suggest  measuring  the  discrepancy  between 
feared  and  actually  occurring  events  [25,  28]. The  selec-
tion  was  justified  by  clinical  considerations  and  consist-
ent  with  other  OCD  studies,  but  precludes  conclusions 
on event related expectancies. Although the latter should 
be considered in a more comprehensive representation of 
inhibitory  learning  theory,  the  present  data  point  to  the 
utility  of  measuring  expectancy  violations  concerning 
distress.

The  relationship  between  distress-related  expectancy 
violation and outcome also highlights a putatively promi-
nent  role  of  distress  management  in  the  maintenance 
of  OCD  symptoms.  It  has  been  suggested,  for  example, 
that  reduced  distress  tolerance  might  contribute  to  the 
development or maintenance of OCD and other psycho-
pathological symptoms (e.g., [72, 73]). Although distress 
tolerance  and  distress-related  expectancy  violation  are 
distinct  constructs,  they  may  not  be  independent  from 
each other. It appears possible, for example, that distress-
related  expectancy  violation  leads  to  changes  in  distress 
tolerance or reflects the individual’s pre-existing ability or 
willingness to tolerate distress to some degree. As we did 
not  assess  distress  tolerance  in  the  present  study,  future 
studies  should  investigate  the  relationship  between  dis-
tress-related expectancy violation and distress tolerance. 
In  addition,  the  discrepancy  between  the  expected  and 
the experienced ability to tolerate distress should be cap-
tured as another facet of expectancy violation [47].

As  for  expectancy  violation,  conceptual  issues  might 
also  be  discussed  for  habituation.  Although  we  found  a 
relationship  between  within-session  habituation  and 
short-term  reduction  of  OCD  symptoms,  it  remains 
unclear  whether  habituation  can  be  considered  a  mech-
anism  of  action  during  ERP  or  whether  it  should  rather 
be  considered  an  indicator  of  extinction  [28].  Recent 
research  made  efforts  to  clarify  the  exact  conditions  of 
extinction  learning  in  OCD  and  its  relation  to  therapy 
outcome [14, 74, 75].

Importantly,  our  data  derive  from  routine  clinical 
procedures  and  the  indicators  of  habituation  and  dis-
tress-related  expectancy  violation  can  be  assessed  and 
computed  easily  by  therapists.  This  is  highlighted  by 
virtually  no  differences  in  regression  models  consid-
ering  minimum  versus  maximum  scores  on  one  hand, 
and  random  effects  linear  slopes  on  the  other  hand 
(Supplementary  Tables  3  and  4).  Thus,  our  findings 
might  be  of  high  clinical  utility  and  external  validity. 
This  is  also  true  because  ERP  in  routine  clinical  prac-
tice  is  usually  conducted  without  the  assessment  of 
psychophysiological  measures  like  skin  conductance 
response, heart rate, or others. However, a comprehen-
sive  scientific  evaluation  of  constructs  needs  to  inte-
grate  this  level  of  measurement,  especially  in  the  case 
of emotional processing theory. Therefore, future stud-
ies should also examine the predictive value of psycho-
physiological  measures  for  treatment  outcome,  and  its 
relation to subjective fear reports.

Conclusions
Exposure  and  response  prevention  has  proven  to  be 
the  central  treatment  element  of  CBT  for  OCD.  The 
course  of  the  mean  Y-BOCS-self-rating  score  in  the 
present study underlines this notion since mean symp-
tom  severity  remains  unchanged  until  the  time  imme-
diately  before  the  first  ERP  and  thereafter  declines 
significantly  (Fig.  2).  Theoretical  approaches  presume 
habituation  or  expectancy  violation  as 
important 
mechanisms of change in exposure-based therapy. The 
processes underlying ERP, however, are rarely specified 
empirically.  In  the  present  study,  we  provide  first  data 
from  exposure-based  CBT  with  a  large  sample  of  110 
adult  patients  with  OCD.  Notably,  we  are  the  first  to 
find evidence of a relationship between distress-related 
expectancy  violation  and  outcome  in  OCD.  How-
ever,  our  results  are  reconcilable  with  both  theoretical 
approaches. If our findings can be confirmed by future 
research  including  experimental  approaches,  they  may 
guide training, implementation and evaluation of expo-
sure-based treatment of OCD.
