The hypothesis that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disturbances are the hallmark of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), proposed by Ross and colleagues in 1989, has stimulated a
wealth of clinical, preclinical, and animal studies on the role of sleep in the pathophysiology of
PTSD. The present review revisits this influential hypothesis in light of clinical and experimental
findings that have since accumulated. Polysomnographic studies conducted in adults with PTSD
have yielded mixed findings regarding REM sleep disturbances, and they generally suggest
modest and nonspecific sleep disruptions. Prospective and treatment studies have provided more
robust evidence for the relationship between sleep disturbances and psychiatric outcomes and
symptoms. Experimental animal and human studies that have probed the relationship between
REM sleep and fear responses, as well as studies focused more broadly on sleep-dependent
affective and memory processes, also provide strong support for the hypothesis that sleep plays an
important role in PTSD-relevant processes. Overall, the literature suggests that disturbed REM or
non-REM sleep can contribute to maladaptive stress and trauma responses and may constitute a
modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric outcomes. Clinicians need to consider that the chronic
sleep disruption associated with nightmares may affect the efficacy of first-line PTSD treatments,
but targeted sleep treatments may accelerate recovery from PTSD. The field is ripe for prospective
and longitudinal studies in high-risk groups to clarify how changes in sleep physiology and
neurobiology contribute to increased risk of poor psychiatric outcomes.

Freud first suggested that posttraumatic nightmares are compulsions to master the anxiety
and guilt associated with a traumatic experience (1). Subsequent theorists, e.g., Hanlon (2)
and Kavaler (3), shared Freud’s central notion that chronic posttraumatic nightmares
represent an effort to assimilate a traumatic experience into one’s psyche during sleep, when
usual defense mechanisms are absent or weakened. Although psychodynamic theories of
posttraumatic nightmares have been replaced by cognitively and physiologically oriented
hypotheses, more recent hypotheses continue to consider chronic posttraumatic nightmares
as failed attempts to adapt to and recover from traumatic experiences (4–6). They generally
posit that sleep plays a central role in both affective and memory processes that promote
either resilience or recovery from challenging waking experiences.

The discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (7) offered a unique window into the
potential physiological and neural mechanisms subserving brain-mind interactions. REM
sleep is a dynamic physiological state in which bursts of rapid eye movements (REMs) are
concomitant with low-amplitude, fast-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity
similar to levels observed during wakefulness in the presence of muscle atonia (Figure 1).

Increased sympathetic dominance and vagal withdrawal, cardiorespiratory irregularities, and
the cessation of active thermoregulation also characterize REM sleep (8). REM sleep recurs
cyclically through the sleep period, in alternation with non-REM (NREM) sleep (Figure 2).
NREM sleep is a state of decreased arousal and overall reduction of neural activity relative
to wakefulness and REM sleep. NREM sleep is composed of both lighter sleep (N1 and N2
sleep stages; Figure 2, top) and slow-wave sleep (N3 sleep stage; Figure 2, bottom), which is
conceptualized as a restorative neural state.

REM sleep is regulated primarily by cholinergic cells of the pedunculopontine and
laterodorsal pontine nuclei and modulated by inhibitory reciprocal interactions with
noradrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic cells of the locus coeruleus, raphe, and
tuberomammillary nuclei, respectively. In contrast to wakefulness and NREM sleep, REM
sleep is characterized by the absence of noradrenergic and serotonergic activity and
represents a state of heightened cholinergic activity.

While dream recall can be elicited from NREM sleep awakenings, dreaming is more
prominent, vivid, and detailed during REM sleep. Nightmares are conceptualized as a
phenomenon of REM sleep (9). However, dreaming is independent from the integrity of
REM-regulating pontine regions. Lesions to associative visual or occipitotemporal cortices
or to the mesocortical and mesolimbic tracts in humans have been found to be associated
with dreaming cessation or with vivid dreaming and altered distinction between dreaming
and reality (10).

Freud’s original suggestion that nightmares and sleep are involved in the adaptation to and
recovery from trauma exposure and the discovery of REM sleep and the prominence of
dreaming during this sleep state provided the foundation for the hypothesis, proposed in
1989 by Ross and colleagues (11), that sleep disturbances, with an emphasis on REM sleep
disturbances and nightmares, constitute “the hallmark of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).” This hypothesis was based on the observations that 1) nightmares are a unique and
core symptom of PTSD, 2) nightmares usually occur in REM sleep, 3) REM sleep is a state
of increased arousal, and 4) prior laboratory-based studies have shown signs of heightened
or attenuated REM sleep in PTSD, such as a greater number of REMs per REM period (an
index known as REM density), higher percentage of REM sleep, and shorter latency
preceding REM sleep in relation to values for comparison groups.

In the present review I aim to revisit the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are the hallmark
of PTSD in light of findings derived from animal, preclinical, and clinical studies that have
accumulated since 1989. After reviewing findings from clinical sleep studies in adults with
PTSD, I will discuss observations derived from animal and experimental human studies
focused on sleep-dependent emotion and memory processes. A more general assessment of

index of maladaptive stress responses in the face of adversity and trauma exposure will then
be provided. The review will conclude with clinical implications and potential future
research directions.

REM Sleep Disturbances in PTSD: Hallmark or Not?

Nightmares are primarily a REM sleep phenomenon, but they may also occur during NREM
sleep in patients with PTSD (12). These dysphoric dreams often depict themes, images, and
emotions that can be related to traumatic events. Nightmares may trigger short or prolonged
awakenings from sleep. However, not all distressed awakenings are associated with
nightmare recalls. Other sleep complaints reported by adults with PTSD are also more likely
to arise from REM sleep. These include bad dreams unrelated to traumatic events, disruptive
behaviors (such as acting-out dreams), and sleep-disordered breathing (see, for instance,
references 13 and 14). Insomnia is one of the most commonly endorsed PTSD symptoms
and is thought to arise primarily from NREM sleep disruption. Other NREM sleep
disturbances often observed in trauma-exposed individuals and patients with PTSD include
nocturnal panic attacks and sleep terrors (13, 15). Thus, clinical observations focusing on the
nature of sleep complaints in PTSD point to a dysregulation in both REM and NREM sleep.

Findings from polysomnographic studies support the clinical reports. Polysomnography
refers to the collection of physiological EEG, electromyographic (EMG), and electro-
oculographic (EOG) signals used for sleep staging and is the gold standard for sleep
measurement. Polysomnographic studies conducted in adults with and without PTSD have
yielded inconsistent findings regarding the presence or nature of REM sleep disturbances in
individuals with PTSD. Some studies have reported indices of REM sleep attenuation and
disruption (16–18), whereas other studies have shown REM sleep changes consistent with
an intensification of REM sleep (19–22) in PTSD when compared with other clinical groups
or with good sleepers without PTSD. NREM sleep disturbances have also been reported
(23–25), but other studies have shown no detectable differences (19, 26, 27). A meta-
analysis of polysomnographic studies conducted with military veterans and civilian adults
with PTSD found modest indices of objective sleep disruption in PTSD (28), as indicated by
more stage 1 (light) sleep (weighted effect size d+=0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02
to 0.46), less slow-wave sleep (weighted effect size d+=−0.28, 95% CI: −0.47 to −0.09]),
and greater REM density than in subjects without PTSD (weighted effect size d+=0.43, 95%
CI: 0.13 to 0.73). Examples of these findings are depicted in Figure 3.

Some of the polysomnographic differences observed in adults with PTSD overlap with those
reported in adults with major depressive disorder, and no unique objective sleep profile has
yet been identified when comparing different psychiatric disorders (29).

Other objective sleep measurement methods have been used in PTSD studies. Quantitative
EEG (qEEG) refers to the spectral analysis of EEG signals. qEEG-derived slow-wave
activity (0.5–4.0 Hz) is used as an index of sleep pressure or sleep depth (30, 31), whereas
high-frequency beta activity (16–32 Hz) and gamma activity (32–50 Hz) are considered to
be indices of central arousal during sleep (32, 33). Some studies have shown greater than

normal beta activity during NREM sleep in PTSD (34, 35). Others, however, have indicated
less beta activity during REM sleep in adults with PTSD relative to comparison subjects (36,
37). Like polysomnography, qEEG may not be adequate to capture indices of changes in
subcortical circuits during REM sleep and NREM sleep that may contribute to PTSD
reliably.

Sleep neuroimaging methods have identified neurobiological differences in REM and
NREM sleep between adults with depression, primary insomnia, or PTSD and healthy good
sleepers, even in the absence of group differences on polysomnographic or qEEG measures
(38–41). In a preliminary study, my colleagues and I recently observed that the increase
from wakefulness to REM sleep in regional brain glucose metabolism in limbic and
paralimbic regions was greater in adults with PTSD than in adults with major depression,
whereas depression was associated with state-independent hypermetabolism in both
wakefulness and REM sleep in these brain areas, relative to the patients with PTSD (42).
Replication in larger groups and direct comparisons among diagnostic groups are needed in
order to clarify the specificity of neurobiological changes observed in REM sleep relative to
wakefulness in PTSD. Comparisons of the neural correlates of NREM sleep across
psychiatric diagnoses are not yet available.

In sum, findings on the nature and magnitude of polysomnographic and qEEG indices of
REM sleep disturbances in PTSD are equivocal. Both subjective and objective REM and
NREM sleep disturbances have been reported and may be the product of a common
underlying disruption of sleep regulatory mechanisms. Whether the heterogeneity of PTSD
symptoms contributes to distinct sleep profiles remains unknown. Sleep neuroimaging
methods are well suited to detect neurobiological changes across sleep/wake states in PTSD
or indices specifically related to nightmares, insomnia, or other disruptive nocturnal
behaviors that are common in PTSD. REM sleep provides an endogenous milieu of
heightened limbic activation, and NREM sleep is an endogenous milieu of attenuated
arousal. Thus, both states provide unique biological states to study the potential mechanisms
that contribute to sleep complaints, the pathophysiology of PTSD, or resilience.

The physiological or neural correlates of nightmares in PTSD remain largely unexplored,
mainly because nightmares are rare under laboratory conditions. A comparison of objective
sleep measures in adults with PTSD-related nightmares and in adults with idiopathic
nightmares (i.e., nightmares unrelated to concurrent psychiatric or medical conditions
without an identifiable trauma-related onset) did not show REM-specific differences
between the two groups or between these groups and good sleepers (23). Rather, adults with
PTSD-related nightmares showed a greater duration of nocturnal awakenings than the other
two groups. Additionally, both groups of nightmare sufferers showed more motor activity
during REM and NREM sleep than did comparison subjects (23). Nielsen and colleagues
used REM sleep deprivation to unmask potential REM sleep indices that may characterize
adults with idiopathic nightmares. Instead of the expected higher values on REM sleep
measures indicative of a heightened propensity for REM sleep, adults with idiopathic
nightmares had a lower propensity for REM sleep than good sleepers before deprivation
(43), a blunted response to REM sleep deprivation (43), and slightly greater sympathovagal
balance during REM sleep than the good sleepers after REM sleep deprivation (44). These

observations suggest that idiopathic nightmares may relate to altered REM sleep physiology.
However, the cross-sectional nature of these polysomnographic studies and the absence of
nightmare episodes in the laboratory make it difficult to determine the direction of the
relationship between nightmares and differences in REM propensity and autonomic balance
or the effects of frequent nightmares, mild levels of PTSD symptoms, and/or unspecified
history of trauma exposure. Nevertheless, the REM deprivation paradigm offers a method to
probe REM sleep (and potentially elicit nightmares under laboratory conditions) and to more
closely evaluate the relationships between nightmares and REM sleep measures in PTSD.

Prospective Sleep Studies and Sleep Treatment Trials in PTSD

Although objective sleep findings in PTSD are mixed, there is some evidence that REM
sleep disturbances are a threat to psychological resilience. REM sleep fragmentation, REM
sleep autonomic imbalance, and nightmares measured within weeks following exposure to
traumatic events have been associated with an increased risk for the development and
persistence of PTSD (36, 45, 46). Polysomnographic studies are costly and often impractical
in large study groups. Consequently, several studies have used self-report measures of sleep
disturbances in order to explore the relationships among trauma exposure, sleep complaints,
and psychiatric outcomes. To date, published studies have consistently demonstrated that
poor sleep and nightmares occurring soon after trauma exposure predict the onset and
persistence of PTSD and other stress-related disorders, including other anxiety disorders,
major depression, and addictive disorders (47–51). Similarly, preexisting complaints of poor
sleep increase the risk of PTSD and other stress-related psychiatric disorders following
trauma exposure (52). Although these observations provide limited information regarding
the possible neurobiological underpinnings of the sleep complaints, they all strongly suggest
that sleep disturbances are an indicator of heightened risk for poor psychiatric outcomes
following trauma exposure. More important, and unlike other risk factors for poor
psychiatric outcomes (e.g., age, sex, prior trauma, and psychiatric history), sleep disturbance
can be modified, through sleep-focused treatments.

Indeed, a number of sleep treatment trials have shown that improvements in nightmares and
insomnia following targeted treatments are accompanied by improvements in the severity of
daytime symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Subjective sleep complaints can be
reduced with recommended PTSD treatments (53), but nightmares and insomnia are often
treatment resistant. A number of pharmacological and behavioral treatments targeting sleep
disturbances in PTSD have been used (see reference 54 for review; see also reference 55).
To date, prazosin (an alpha-1 antagonist) (56, 57) and imagery rehearsal therapy and its
variants (58, 59) are the recommended treatment options for PTSD-related nightmares and
are associated with improvements in nightmares and insomnia (60), although there have also
been negative results (61). Combined behavioral treatments for nightmares and insomnia
applied to PTSD patients have also yielded promising findings (62, 63). Overall, treatment
studies suggest that the normalization of sleep disturbances has beneficial effects on other
disrupted neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to daytime PTSD symptoms.

Only a few clinical trials have combined polysomnography and other objective sleep
measurement methods to evaluate whether sleep treatments are associated with detectable

improvements in sleep. One study found that prazosin was associated with greater total sleep
time, greater REM sleep duration, and shorter REM latency than placebo in a crossover trial
with adult civilians who had chronic PTSD and psychiatric comorbidities (64). Thus, REM
sleep disruption induced by hypernoradrenergic activity during sleep may be normalized by
noradrenergic blockade with prazosin, which facilitated REM sleep consolidation and may
mediate improvements in sleep complaints. Changes in REM sleep were not observed after
an 8-week double-blind randomized trial that compared prazosin, placebo, and a behavioral
sleep intervention targeting nightmares and insomnia in a group of 50 military veterans with
symptoms of posttraumatic stress (63). The same was true after a 12-week open-label trial
with nefazodone in 12 military veterans with chronic PTSD (65). Modest increases in the
percentage of REM sleep and REM density concurrent with a reduction in REM sleep
latency (together suggesting increased REM sleep pressure) have been reported following
imagery rehearsal therapy (66). The changes in REM sleep were paralleled by improvements
in nightmares, sleep complaints, and daytime symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression.
The effects of sleep treatments on the neurobiology of PTSD during wakefulness and REM
remain unknown.

Sleep-Dependent Emotion and Memory Processes: Animal and Human

Studies

The relationships of sleep to learning and memory (67, 68), emotional processing (69, 70),
and adaptation to stress (71–73) in animals and humans have long been recognized. These
have provided further support to the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may contribute to the
pathophysiology of PTSD.

Classical fear conditioning and extinction paradigms have been used in both animal and
human studies in order to evaluate the role of sleep (and sleep disturbances) in fear
responses as an experimental model of PTSD. Classical (or Pavlovian) cued or contextual
fear conditioning arises when a neutral stimulus (e.g., light, tone, specific environment)
closely precedes in time the occurrence of an aversive, emotionally significant event (e.g.,
shock) that elicits a fear response (e.g., freezing, increased skin conductance response). The
neutral stimulus or environment is referred to as the “conditioned stimulus,” and the
aversive event is referred to as the “unconditioned stimulus.” With repetition of the
association, the conditioned stimulus alone can elicit the fear response, now called the
“conditioned response.” Fear extinction refers to a competing learning process that parallels
the attenuation and loss of the conditioned response following repeated presentations of the
conditioned stimulus alone. Contextual fear conditioning follows a similar paradigm, except
that the context in which the unconditioned stimulus is presented is used as the conditioned
stimulus.

In rodents, fear conditioning decreases REM sleep latency, decreases REM sleep duration
and number of REM bouts, and increases ponto-geniculo-occipital waves (74–76).
Alternatively, REM sleep is increased following safety conditioning (where animals learn
that they will not be exposed to aversive stimuli in a given environment or given a specific
cue never paired with the aversive stimulus) (76) or shuttle-box avoidance training (where
the animals learn that they can terminate the unconditioned stimulus by escaping to a

different compartment of the training cage (67–77). Depriving rats of REM sleep before
conditioning impairs both cued and contextual fear conditioning, as well as learning and
recall on a discriminative avoidance task (78, 79). Alternatively, postconditioning REM
sleep deprivation impairs extinction of cued but not contextual fear conditioning (80), and
extinction of contextual conditioned fear is associated with increased sleep (81). Thus,
animal studies suggest that fear responses affect and are affected by REM sleep, as well as
indicating a more general relationship between sleep and memory processes.

Currently, there is no animal model in which to study the effects of nightmares or re-
exposure to the conditioned stimulus during sleep. Such models are necessary in order to
unravel the possible distinct and additive effects of REM sleep abnormalities and nightmares
on the onset and persistence of PTSD. Of course, these models will require the use of
physiological outcome measures analogous to those captured in humans (e.g., blood
pressure, heart rate) to assess the magnitude of fear responses upon representation of the
conditioned stimulus during REM (or NREM) sleep, as the behavioral measure of freezing
has obvious limitations in the sleeping animal.

Fear conditioning, extinction, and extinction recall have been studied in humans, and the
results suggest that fear responses can affect and be affected by REM sleep. In one study,
overnight sleep following fear conditioning and extinction facilitated generalization of
extinction to unextinguished stimuli more than did a comparable period of wakefulness (82).
It remains unknown, however, whether REM sleep mediated this effect. Subjects who
exhibited REM sleep during a nap following fear conditioning and extinction showed lower
skin conductance response and greater activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in
response to the extinguished stimulus when compared with subjects who did not achieve
REM sleep during the nap (83). Additionally, those who exhibited REM sleep during their
nap also had lower skin conductance response and activation of neural activity in the
laterodorsal tegmentum in response to electrical shocks during conditioning. These findings
suggest that individual differences in REM sleep propensity modulate both fear conditioning
and extinction recall.

Human studies that have probed the role of sleep in affective and memory processes further
support the hypothesis that sleep disturbances may contribute to the pathophysiology of
maladaptive stress responses, including PTSD. Extensive and elegant reviews of this
literature are available elsewhere (84–86). Work by Walker and colleagues highlighted the
relevance of these studies in understanding the potential role of sleep, and more specifically
REM sleep, in PTSD. Specifically, their studies revealed that overnight sleep deprivation
enhanced neural response to negative emotional stimuli, by simultaneously potentiating
amygdala activation and reducing activation of the medial prefrontal cortex in response to
negative stimuli. Furthermore, sleep deprivation reduced the connectivity between the
amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (87). In another study, they showed that napping
after an emotion task reduced reactivity to anger and fear-related stimuli and increased
reactivity to positive stimuli (88). It is possible that these effects may be mediated by REM
sleep during naps. REM sleep during naps has also been associated with increased emotional
memory consolidation (86). Together, these findings reinforce the hypothesis that sleep
disturbances play an important role in PTSD by compromising sleep-dependent affective

and memory processing. Similar experimental paradigms applied to trauma-exposed
individuals with and without PTSD could clarify the relationship of sleep or REM sleep to
neural responses to trauma-relevant or general emotional cues. Such findings may inform
how sleep (or napping) may be scheduled in relation to cognitive-behavioral treatment
sessions to enhance therapeutic effects.

Sleep Disturbances: A Marker of Compromised Psychological Resilience?

Disturbed sleep may constitute a risk factor for poor psychiatric outcomes following trauma
exposure, as suggested by the aforementioned observation that survivors of motor vehicle
accidents who showed autonomic and polysomnographic REM sleep disturbances were at a
higher risk of developing PTSD over time (36, 45). Additionally, preexisting and posttrauma
sleep complaints increased the risk for PTSD and other stress-related disorders (52).

There are other indications that sleep disturbances, including REM sleep disruption, may
indeed be sensitive indices of compromised resilience. Individual differences in REM sleep
propensity have been observed in both animals and humans, and they moderate the effects of
stress and/or trauma exposure on behavioral and physiological outcomes (83, 89).
Furthermore, REM sleep is most prominent prenatally and over the first 2 years of life.
Challenges or significant adversity during this developmental period may have a more
significant impact on the physiology of REM sleep. Exposure to acute or chronic stressors or
trauma during childhood or adolescence can affect brain development (90) and REM sleep
physiology. Consistent with this suggestion are findings indicating that childhood adversity
is strongly associated with adult sleep complaints (91, 92) and is prevalent among adults
with insomnia who also show elevated indices of objective sleep disruption (93).
Additionally, REM sleep fragmentation in adult combat-exposed military veterans was
strongly associated with exposure to adversity before age 18, as well as with adult self-
reported disruptive nocturnal behaviors (94). These findings raise the possibility that the
robust predictive relationship between insomnia and an increased risk for subsequent mood,
anxiety disorders, and addictive disorders (51, 95) may be closely related to early exposure
to adversity.

To date, studies focused on sleep in PTSD have all been conducted with adults exposed to
trauma or with chronic PTSD. Whether objective sleep disturbances precede trauma
exposure and/or the onset of PTSD and whether the nature of sleep disturbance changes over
time remain undetermined. However, there is rapidly growing evidence that individual
difference in sleep or in REM sleep may be a marker of vulnerability to poor psychiatric
outcomes following trauma exposure or, alternatively, of resilience.

Since Ross and colleagues proposed the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are the hallmark
of PTSD and emphasized REM sleep disturbances, several human and animal studies have
provided evidence supporting a role for sleep in PTSD-relevant emotion and memory
processing, even in the absence of robust objective profiles indicative of REM sleep
disruption. Prospective follow-ups of trauma-exposed individuals and sleep treatment
studies reinforce the relationship between sleep disruption and poor psychiatric outcomes

and between sleep restoration and improvements in daytime symptoms. However, the
biological mechanisms underlying these relationships remain unknown. There is evidence
that individual differences in REM sleep may mediate the effects of stress or trauma on
behavioral, physiological, and neural responses to stressors in both animals and humans.
These effects, however, may not be limited to REM sleep alone. Rather, both animal and
human studies provide strong support for the notion that sleep, more generally, is directly
involved in PTSD-relevant emotion and memory processes. These findings have important
clinical implications and provide directions for future research.

Clinical Implications

The finding that sleep disturbances preceding or following traumatic experiences contribute
to poor psychiatric outcomes offers new strategies for prevention and early detection efforts
in high-risk populations and for individuals exposed to traumatic events. Specifically,
regular sleep assessments in high-risk populations and in trauma-exposed individuals may
facilitate the provision of management strategies aimed to enhance resilience through the
delivery of sleep-promoting habits. Unless sleep-disordered breathing is suspected,
ambulatory or laboratory-based sleep studies are not necessary for the evaluation and
treatment of nightmares, insomnia, or other complaints of poor sleep. However, clinical
interviews, validated self-report measures, and/or sleep diaries can effectively guide the
diagnostic process and development of comprehensive treatment plans that address trauma-
related sleep complaints. Early delivery of effective pharmacological and behavioral
treatments to enhance sleep consolidation and/or to accelerate the restoration of sleep in the
early aftermath following trauma exposure may ultimately accelerate recovery.

Currently, there is no consensus or guideline regarding the inclusion of evidence-based sleep
treatment strategies in the context of trauma and PTSD management, nor is it the case in the
context of conditions frequently comorbid with PTSD, such as depression, suicidality, and
addictive disorders. In addition, there are no empirical data available at this time to
determine the order in which PTSD and sleep treatments should be delivered. Until ongoing
studies clarify this question, clinicians need to consider that the chronic sleep disruption
associated with nightmares and insomnia may affect the efficacy of first-line PTSD
treatments. This is especially the case for cognitive-behavioral approaches that rely on
habituation (or reduction of reactivity to fear-provoking stimuli and situations) or on
cognitive processing, which are two brain functions markedly affected by sleep loss.

Finally, there is a need to facilitate education about effective pharmacological and
behavioral sleep treatments for mental health care providers involved in the treatment and
management of patients suffering from PTSD. Conversely, there is a considerable need to
educate sleep clinicians on the potential effects of trauma exposure on sleep.

Future Directions for Sleep Studies of PTSD and Other Stress-Related

Psychiatric Disorders

Since 1989, there has been a growing interest in understanding how sleep contributes to the
interactions among physiological, neural, and psychological mechanisms that underlie the

pathophysiology of PTSD. The vast majority of the work to date has been cross-sectional,
with the exception of a few small prospective studies in trauma-exposed study groups and
treatment studies. A minority of the latter have included objective sleep measurement
methods that may provide insights into the physiological or neural underpinnings of the
relationships of sleep to clinical gains and PTSD symptoms. The field is ripe for prospective
and longitudinal studies in high-risk groups in order to understand how changes in REM
sleep (or more generally, sleep physiology and neurobiology) contribute to increased risk of
poor psychiatric outcomes.

Much of the previous work on sleep and PTSD has also been limited to adults, often with
chronic PTSD and high rates of psychiatric comorbidities and use of psychotropics. Findings
from animal and human studies converge to suggest that early adversity during critical
developmental periods can have long-lasting effects on REM sleep and brain development
(96). Assessing the impact of stress and trauma on sleep in children and adolescents and
their relationships to psychiatric outcomes later in life may yield significant insights into
pathways to prevention.

Animal models that have been used as analogues of human PTSD have provided
information on the effects of trauma exposure on sleep and the effects of pre- or
postconditioning sleep deprivation on subsequent fear responses. Human studies have used
total sleep deprivation or REM sleep deprivation as probes, but these models have not yet
been applied to individuals with PTSD. Similarly, studies of sleep-dependent emotion and
memory processes have yielded highly relevant findings for PTSD, but these methods have
not been applied to trauma-exposed groups with or without PTSD. Extensions of these
findings to clinical groups are awaited. The combination of high-density EEG and other
approaches to assess brain connectivity in these individuals have the potential of clarifying
the direction of the relationship between fear responses and REM sleep. Finally,
translational efforts are needed to accelerate the identification of risk and protective factors
and the development of novel treatment targets to accelerate normalization of trauma
reactions, as well as recovery from PTSD.

In conclusion, the hypothesis that sleep disturbances are the hallmark of PTSD has
stimulated a wealth of animal and human studies to clarify and examine the role of sleep and
sleep disturbances in stress responses. Data accumulated to date suggest that sleep
disturbances are the hallmark not only of PTSD but also of a heightened vulnerability to
maladaptive stress responses. Disturbed sleep is a modifiable risk factor, and sleep
restoration through effective targeted sleep treatments may accelerate recovery from trauma
exposure and PTSD. Identifying the relationships between sleep and affective and memory
processes and clarifying the neural underpinnings of these relationships can provide novel
directions for the development of innovative strategies for risk management and treatment.

Clinical Guidance: Sleep Disorder Treatment May Speed PTSD Recovery

Alleviating insomnia or sleep disruptions with pharmacological or behavioral treatment
may itself reduce daytime symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety,
and depression. It may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments, especially
cognitive-behavioral approaches relying on habituation or cognitive processing, which
are markedly affected by sleep loss. The antihypertensive prazosin and imagery rehearsal
therapy are recommended for PTSD-related nightmares. Combined behavioral treatments
for nightmares and insomnia in PTSD patients may also be effective. Germain
recommends clinical interviews, self-report measures, or sleep diaries for evaluating
sleep complaints unless sleep-disordered breathing is suspected.

FIGURE 1. Electrophysiological Characteristics of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleepa
aREM sleep is characterized by a high-frequency, low-amplitude electroencephalographic
(EEG) signal resembling that of wakefulness. Synchronized rapid eye movements (REMs)
are easily identified by electro-oculography (EOG) signals. Muscle atonia can be observed
on the electromyography (EMG) channel. REF, voltage difference from reference
electrodes; C3, left central EEG signal; C4, right central EEG signal; O1, left occipital EEG
signal; O2, right occipital EEG signal; LOC, left EOG signal; ROC, right EOG signal.

aREF, difference from reference electrodes; C3, left central EEG signal; C4, right central
EEG signal; O1, left occipital EEG signal; O2, right occipital EEG signal; LOC, left EOG
signal; ROC, right EOG signal; EMG, electromyography channel.
bCharacterized by the presence of sleep spindles (S) (trains of alpha waves lasting at least
0.5 sec) and K-complexes (K) (negative sharp waves immediately followed by positive
components). Ocular activity is minimal, and EMG levels are higher than in REM sleep.
cCharacterized by a low-frequency, high-amplitude EEG signal.

FIGURE 3. Hypnograms for Two Combat Veterans With and Without PTSDa
aBoth men served in Operation Iraqi Freedom; one was 25 years old, and the other was 26.
Sleep characteristics were determined with polysomnography, and baseline measurements
appear on the right. REM sleep periods are denoted by thicker horizontal bars. The asterisk
on the left side of each graph denotes the latency between the beginning of the time in bed
and the onset of sleep, and it is shorter in the veteran without PTSD. Vertical lines after
sleep onset reflect awakenings from sleep. In these examples, the veteran without PTSD
shows greater sleep efficiency (total sleep time divided by total time spent in bed) despite
also showing more frequent brief nocturnal awakenings and a longer wake time after sleep
onset than the veteran with PTSD. The percentage of N3 sleep (stages 3 and 4 in the figure)
is rather high in both veterans and is higher in the veteran without PTSD. The percentage of
REM sleep is slightly higher in the veteran with PTSD.
