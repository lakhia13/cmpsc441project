Abstract

Mindfulness meditation is increasingly incorporated into mental health interventions, and 
theoretical concepts associated with it have influenced basic research on psychopathology. Here, 
we review the current understanding of mindfulness meditation through the lens of clinical 
neuroscience, outlining the core capacities targeted by mindfulness meditation and mapping them 
onto cognitive and affective constructs of the Research Domain Criteria matrix proposed by the 
National Institute of Mental Health. We review efficacious applications of mindfulness meditation 
to specific domains of psychopathology including depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and substance 
abuse, as well as emerging efforts related to attention disorders, traumatic stress, dysregulated 
eating, and serious mental illness. Priorities for future research include pinpointing mechanisms, 
refining methodology, and improving implementation. Mindfulness meditation is a promising 
basis for interventions, with particular potential relevance to psychiatric comorbidity. The 
successes and challenges of mindfulness meditation research are instructive for broader 
interactions between contemplative traditions and clinical psychological science.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

The family of practices known as mindfulness meditation (MM) has attracted increasing 
cultural and scientific interest during the past three decades. A remarkable range of MM-
related resources are available to the general public (Cavanagh et al. 2014, Spijkerman et al. 
2016). Meanwhile, the incorporation of MM into clinical interventions has inspired a wave 
of scientific and scholarly activity.

Why have these practices attracted such strong interest for mental health treatment? One 
reason may be versatility. The capacities trained by MM appear applicable to a broad range 
of conditions and contexts, offering approaches for addressing transdiagnostic factors and 
comorbidities. A second reason may be diversity: novel, well-validated treatment approaches 
may reach patients who do not respond to established treatments. A third reason may be 
interest among patients, which enhances their likelihood of engagement and adherence. 
Finally, MM practice may extend beyond treating clinical psychopathology to supporting 
resilience and well-being in the population at large (for a comprehensive review of 
mindfulness interventions see Creswell 2017; see also Dahl et al. 2015, Davidson & 
McEwen 2012).

While clinical research on MM began in the 1980s, a tremendous expansion in its scope and 
pace paralleled the rise of cognitive neuroscience. Accordingly, a neurobehavioral 
perspective has been integral to research on MM (Davidson 2003, Lutz et al. 2007, 2015). 
Throughout the past two decades, early exploratory studies on MM have given way to 
programmatic lines of experimental research and large-scale randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs). Recently, sufficient evidence has accumulated to allow for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses in an expanding range of areas (e.g., Goldberg et al. 2017, 2018b). 
Meanwhile, echoing broader concerns across the fields of psychology and medicine, 
growing attention has focused on methodological rigor and critical evaluation of the 
accumulated evidence for MM (Davidson & Kaszniak 2015, Van Dam et al. 2018).

In this review, we summarize the current status of research on MM and psychopathology in 
terms of theory, experimental evidence, and clinical outcomes, and we identify important 
gaps in understanding and priorities for the field in the coming years. We approach the 
challenge of synthesizing a now-extensive literature by emphasizing convergent and well-
replicated neurobehavioral findings and conceptually rigorous theoretical models. To 
contextualize this work within the broader fields of clinical psychology and cognitive 
neuroscience, our overview is guided by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix 
developed by the National Institute of Mental Health (Insel et al. 2010).

What is Mindfulness Meditation?

In a clinical setting, most mindfulness meditation–based interventions (MMBIs) rely upon 
an approach first articulated in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course 
developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn and colleagues beginning in 1979 at the University of 
Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts (Kabat-Zinn 2011). MBSR 
emerged as a means of addressing debilitating stress in ambulatory patients, often those with 
chronic pain. Since that time, MBSR and its many derivatives, such as mindfulness-based 
cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal et al. 2002), have been used in numerous therapeutic 
contexts.

Intervention structure.—The basic structure of an MBSR course, which is generally 
retained in its derivative forms, consists of an 8-week program of one 2.5 to 3.5 hour session 
per week in a class typically consisting of 10 to 20 participants, although larger and smaller 
classes are possible (Santorelli 2014, Santorelli et al. 2017). A single, daylong (8 hour) silent 
retreat focused on MM practice is held, usually after the sixth week. During class sessions, 
participants learn the techniques for MM practice through instruction and meditation 
sessions. MBSR and its derivatives also include considerable didactic instruction in relevant 
topics, such as the physiology of stress. Participants are expected to engage in approximately 
45 minutes of daily homework, which always includes MM practice (Parsons et al. 2017). In 
addition to formal MM, participants are also encouraged to cultivate mindfulness through 
informal practices, during which they are engaged in tasks of daily living, but in a manner 
that draws on the capacities trained by MM (Kabat-Zinn 1990, Santorelli et al. 2017).

Sources in contemplative traditions.—The techniques and instructions for MM found 
in MBSR are drawn primarily from Buddhist contemplative traditions that seek to cultivate 
mindfulness, an English term chosen in the nineteenth century as a translation for the Pali 
term sati. In its most technical sense, sati refers to a form of mental stability that prevents 
attention from being captured by distractors. The cultivation of that stability runs across the 
diverse styles of Buddhist mindfulness practices, and despite significant differences, these 
Buddhist traditions target similar capacities, including those discussed in the section on 
Targeting Core Capacities (Dunne 2015, Gethin 2015). In creating the style of MM found in 
MBSR, Kabat-Zinn and colleagues were influenced by the long-standing engagement 
between Buddhism and psychotherapy (Harrington & Dunne 2015), and in keeping with the 
syncretic nature of that engagement, their secularized style of MM drew from multiple 
Buddhist traditions (Kabat-Zinn 2011). Thus, the style of secularized MM found in MBSR is 
a unique blend of contemplative techniques that, while rooted in Buddhist traditions, is 
clearly a new formulation of mindfulness practice.

Technique and instruction.—In MBSR and its derivates, the instructions and techniques 
for MM practice follow a typical protocol. In terms of posture, MM practice is most 
commonly conducted in a seated, upright position that can ideally be maintained stably for 
the meditation session without excessive tension. However, in some types of MM such as the 
body scan, practitioners lie on their backs; likewise, MM can be practiced while walking 
slowly or while engaging in yoga postures. In MBSR, practitioners work up to a session of

seated meditation that is 20 to 30 minutes in length, sometimes supplemented with practices 
such as the body scan (Kabat-Zinn 1990, Santorelli et al. 2017).

Sessions of seated MM generally begin with a focal object of meditation, usually the 
sensations of breathing. Practitioners are reminded to adopt a nonaversive stance toward 
experience, with instructions encouraging a “curious,” “friendly,” or “open” quality of 
attention. Within this stance, practitioners are instructed to attend moment-by-moment to the 
object in a “nonjudgmental” way—that is, without becoming caught in conceptual 
elaborations about the object—while also maintaining a relaxed vigilance for distractions, 
which inevitably arise. Practitioners are taught that when attention is captured by a 
distractor, they should recognize that the distraction has occurred and without judgment or 
reactivity (including reactivity about their performance in meditation), they should return 
their attention to the object. When the distractor consists of a chain of thoughts, practitioners 
are encouraged to recognize that the thoughts are merely thoughts. The goal is not to 
suppress thoughts, but rather to observe them as mental events (Kabat-Zinn 1990, Santorelli 
et al. 2017).

Targeting Core Capacities

As noted above, these typical instructions for secularized MM emerge from a complex 
interaction with multiple contemplative traditions, and this complexity may be one reason 
for the lack of a clear scientific consensus on the precise mechanisms or ingredients of MM. 
Nevertheless, nearly all formulations involve a core set of therapeutically relevant and 
interrelated capacities that are enhanced through MM training (Lutz et al. 2015).

Meta-awareness refers to the capacity of an individual to monitor the current contents and 
processes of the mind in a way that permits a report thereupon (Schooler et al. 2011). A 
paradigmatic instance of meta-awareness occurs when one notices that one has been 
thinking about some task-irrelevant content, as when one becomes aware that one has been 
daydreaming about a vacation while trying to read an article. Meta-awareness of distraction 
makes it possible to correct for the deviation and redirect attention back to the task at hand. 
Additionally, meta-awareness provides a means to monitor the quality of attention and notice 
its context, such as the affective states occurring with attention.

Present-centered awareness refers to sustaining the focus of attention in the present moment. 
This stands in contrast to becoming caught up in a chain of thoughts about the past or the 
future, especially in ways that involve mental time travel, or prospective and retrospective 
episodic memories (Suddendorf & Corballis 2007), for example, thinking about tonight’s 
dinner or reminiscing about a pleasant vacation. In MM, present-centered awareness is often 
facilitated by attending to sensory perceptions and body sensations, such as those of the 
breath (Farb et al. 2015), with practitioners encouraged to recognize that physical sensations 
occur only in the present.

Nonreactivity to experience refers to the suspension of habitual affective valuation of the 
current contents of experience, and in MM it is generally facilitated by adopting a stance 
toward experience that is nonaversive (Lutz et al. 2015), characterized in MBSR as 
“curious,” “accepting,” and “nonjudging” (Kabat-Zinn 1990). Within MM, a crucial role of

this stance is to reduce avoidance of internal stimuli and thereby facilitate more accurate 
perception of mental contents (Dunne 2015; Lutz et al. 2008b, 2015).

Dereification refers to a shift in the practitioner’s relationship with thoughts, such that 
thoughts are no longer experienced as reified—that is, they are not experienced as real 
objects in the world. This shift is often described in terms of decentering, or psychological 
distancing, by which practitioners position themselves apart from the phenomena being 
observed (Bernstein et al. 2015, Kross et al. 2012), but a more precise description may be 
the reduction of experiential fusion (Dahl et al. 2015, Lutz et al. 2015). Much as a 
moviegoer might become immersed in the contents of a film and lose awareness of the 
distinction between film images and reality, an individual may experience thoughts as 
identical, or fused, with the objects that they represent (Dahl et al. 2015). When fused in this 
way, the thoughts about an impending final examination, for example, are experienced as 
real depictions of what will happen during the exam. Dereification refers to the opposite 
stance, such that thoughts and perceptions are no longer perceived as inherent 
representations of reality, but rather as mental objects that are subject to examination in their 
own right.

MM is also often understood to facilitate a shift in self-related processing away from a 
conventional and potentially maladaptive perception of the self as a discrete and unchanging 
entity (Lin et al. 2018). Relatedly, changes in self-related processing may reduce narrative or 
autobiographical thought while enhancing an awareness of the current-moment state of the 
self (Farb et al. 2007). Importantly, some styles of MM, especially in traditional Buddhist 
contexts, explicitly target such shifts as a primary goal of practice (Dunne 2015), but the 
form of secular MM provided in widely used MMBIs typically does not; thus, in the latter 
context, such shifts are understood to occur implicitly via cultivation of the other capacities 
described above (e.g., Hölzel et al. 2011, Vago & Silbersweig 2012).

Finally, some accounts also include compassion, a motivation to relieve suffering, as a 
capacity trained by MM. Compassion towards self and others may be an explicit object of 
focus for meditation practice (Kirby 2017, Lutz et al. 2008a). Some therapeutic interventions 
also introduce a notion of self-compassion—that is, a compassionate stance toward one’s 
own experience and suffering. While the cultivation of compassion holds significance for 
psychopathology (for a review, see Hofmann et al. 2011), it is not consistently integrated 
into widely adopted MMBIs for mental health. Accordingly, in this review, we consider it as 
part of the broader contemplative context for MM.

Development Through Structured Training

Over the course of MM training, practitioners are meant to develop the capacities 
summarized above. In principle, these capacities also become increasingly available over 
time for use outside of formal meditation contexts. Some changes observed following 
MMBIs undoubtedly emerge from factors not specific to MM, such as the socially 
supportive effects of a group intervention. Nevertheless, a series of hypotheses about the 
development of the core capacities gained through MM training can be stated as follows: (a) 
The capacity to sustain present-centered awareness is facilitated by the moment-by-moment 
focus on the meditation object; (b) meta-awareness is cultivated primarily through

monitoring for distractions; (c) when, as is frequently the case, a distracting chain of 
thoughts captures attention and pulls it away from the object, dereification is trained by 
recognizing that the thoughts are just thoughts and not reality; (d) nonreactivity to 
experience is cultivated by rehearsing the nonaverse—or “curious” and “nonjudging”—
stance toward experience; and (e) changes in self-related processing occur through 
dereification of self-concept and a decrease in autobiographical, narrative thinking.

The formulation of MM presented above is compatible with a range of practice styles. 
Neuroscientific research has often used a heuristic distinction between Focused Attention 
(FA) and Open Monitoring (OM) styles of MM (Lutz et al. 2008b, 2015). In an FA style, the 
practitioner seeks to sustain focus on a chosen object of meditation, and the emphasis is on 
sustaining that focus. OM styles, in contrast, emphasize sustaining present-centered 
awareness and monitoring experience without restricting attention to a single object of 
focus. MBSR training begins with focus on an object, but an OM style—usually called 
“choiceless awareness” (Kabat-Zinn 1990)—is introduced as training progresses.

Mindfulness as a Psychological Construct

Some research has investigated mindfulness as a psychological construct, conceptualized in 
both state and dispositional trait forms. The proposed mindfulness construct has been 
operationalized via self-report instruments such as the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale 
(Brown & Ryan 2003), Toronto Mindfulness Scale (Lau et al. 2006), and Five Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al. 2006). These instruments have shown responsiveness 
to mindfulness interventions, associations with positive psychological outcomes, and 
incremental validity relative to measures of related constructs such as attentional control 
(Quaglia et al. 2015). However, the aforementioned lack of definitional consensus 
complicates the straightforward use of a singular mindfulness construct (Grossman & Van 
Dam 2011). External validity has been an additional challenge, with mindfulness measures 
showing signs of demand characteristics (Grossman & Van Dam 2011) and not responding 
selectively to mindfulness training (Goldberg et al. 2015). The interpretation of items and 
the constructs tapped also appears to vary across populations; for example, cross-study 
comparisons of one scale revealed higher ratings in binge drinkers than experienced 
meditators, driven partially by items related to somatic sensations (Grossman 2008). Thus, 
while work continues to address these issues, we opt here to emphasize the investigation of 
MM via neurocognitive constructs and measures.

Clinical and Research Paradigms

The majority of evidence presented in this review derives from one of three research 
paradigms, each offering distinct contributions. The first is the study of structured, secular 
MMBIs that incorporate formal meditation practice into a format similar to MBSR, as 
described above. The effects of such interventions are important because they are the most 
widely disseminated and influential in mental health treatment, and they form the primary 
basis for investigating the impact of MM on clinical outcomes (Goldberg et al. 2018b, Goyal 
et al. 2014). A second paradigm includes brief MM trainings and laboratory-based tasks. 
This approach allows for more flexiblility in the format and setting of delivery and more 
detailed experimental study of cognitive and affective processes in MM (e.g., Tang et al.

2015). A third paradigm is case–control research on long-term MM training undertaken in 
both secular and nonsecular practice communities. Evidence from such training offers 
insights into the effects of sustained practice (e.g., Gotink et al. 2016) and may also reveal 
changes that are undetectable or absent during earlier stages of MM practice (Davidson & 
Kaszniak 2015, Zeidan & Vago 2016).

Another family of mindfulness-informed psychotherapeutic interventions incorporates 
primarily informal training and conceptual material from mindfulness traditions without a 
substantial component of formal meditation. Acceptance and commitment therapy 
incorporates the principles of mindfulness practice into a broader model based on behavior 
theory that emphasizes the role of context and linguistic framing in psychological problems 
and aims to increase psychological flexibility (Hayes et al. 2006). In dialectical behavior 
therapy (DBT), principles of mindfulness form a common thread supporting the 
development of capacities for emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal 
effectiveness (Linehan 1993). Notably, DBT has shown efficacy in the treatment of 
borderline personality disorder, a condition for which effective treatments were previously 
lacking (Lynch et al. 2007). We do not identify borderline personality disorder as a target for 
MMBIs: The informal approach in DBT is taken specifically because of Linehan’s (1993) 
observation that such patients typically find formal meditation difficult to tolerate. However, 
the success of DBT in treating patients with borderline personality disorder and as a 
treatment for other refactory populations (Lynch et al. 2007) demonstrates the broader 
potential for integrating principles and concepts from contemplative traditions to contribute 
to advances in psychological treatment. Although we do not attempt an in-depth review of 
acceptance and commitment therapy, DBT, and other mindfulness-informed 
psychotherapies, their rich relationship with formal MM training and Buddhist 
contemplative traditions has inspired substantial discussion elsewhere (e.g., see Dimidjian et 
al. 2016).

COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE MECHANISMS

Psychopathology is now widely understood to originate in the dysregulation of underlying 
cognitive and affective systems whose functions cut across standard categories of psychiatric 
diagnosis (Insel et al. 2010). Therefore, understanding how MM influences these core 
neurobehavioral systems is critical to modeling its effects on mental health. Accordingly, we 
next discuss how the effects of MM training may map onto the RDoC domains of cognitive 
systems, positive valence systems, and negative valence systems at multiple levels of 
analysis, including neural circuits, behavior, self-report, and standard laboratory paradigms.

The range of mechanisms of action proposed in theoretical accounts of MM is substantial 
enough that cataloguing them fully would be infeasible (see, e.g., Baer 2003; Chambers et 
al. 2009; Creswell & Lindsay 2014; Garland et al. 2014a, 2017; Hölzel et al. 2011; Lutz et 
al. 2015; Teasdale & Chaskalson 2011a,b; Vago & Silbersweig 2012). However, robust 
evidence bearing on these proposals, particularly in the context of MMBIs for mental health, 
remains comparatively more limited (see, e.g., Alsubaie et al. 2017, Gu et al. 2015, van der 
Velden et al. 2015). Accordingly, we focus on a subset of potential mechanisms that have

particular relevance to psychological disorders and for which relevant neurobehavioral 
findings are available.

Cognitive Systems

The core capacities targeted by MM are intimately linked with cognitive function. For any 
meditative practice, working memory is needed to maintain a task set throughout the session, 
and styles involving a specific object of focus further require the maintenance of sustained 
attention toward that object. A central aspect of MM in particular is responding to 
attentional capture by distracting thought processes. Attentional control is needed to 
maintain sufficient awareness of mental processes that distraction is detectable; cognitive 
control circuits must be involved to detect the discrepancy between mental contents and the 
meditative task set; and inhibitory systems must be enlisted to disengage and return mental 
focus to the intended task (Lutz et al. 2008b, 2015).

Considerable research has been conducted to examine the effects of MM practice on 
cognitive systems at the neural level. Tang et al. (2015) note that MM practice relies on 
multiple high-level mental functions, and, thus, changes in neural function are likely to 
manifest across large-scale networks in the brain. Lutz et al. (2015) identify three networks 
with particular relevance for the cognitive aspects of MM training. The first of these is a 
central executive network (CEN) that is involved in the top-down regulation of attention and 
includes nodes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex. Second, a salience 
network, involved in bottom-up attentional orienting, incorporates the anterior insula, dorsal 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, and dopaminergic midbrain regions. Third, the 
default mode network (DMN) is concentrated in midline cortical regions, with the posterior 
cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial PFC as two hub regions. Initially identified by increased 
activation during rest relative to task-oriented states, the DMN is also linked with 
spontaneous thought (e.g., mind wandering; Schooler et al. 2011) as well as self-referential 
thought (Lin et al. 2018).

Altered function has been observed within all of these networks, both during MM practice 
itself and during the performance of cognitive tasks subsequent to MM training. A recent 
meta-analysis of functional activations across multiple styles of meditation (Fox et al. 2016) 
found multiple clusters of consistent activation and deactivation associated with MM-style 
practices: Among meditation techniques, both FA and OM styles of practice were associated 
with increased activation in the anterior insula and uniquely activated regions of the dorsal 
ACC and midcingulate cortex; FA was further distinguished by deactivations in the PCC; 
and OM was distinguished by activations in the mid–anterior insula and lateral regions of the 
PFC. The DMN has been a particular focus of investigation (Brewer & Garrison 2014). 
Functional connectivity within subnetworks of the DMN appears to increase with MM 
practice, while connectivity between major DMN hubs appears to decrease (Mrazek et al. 
2014). Finally, experienced MM practitioners have shown reduced DMN activation during 
OM-style practice as well as increased resting-state functional connectivity between regions 
of the DMN and CEN during rest, consistent with greater capacity to regulate self-referential 
discursive thinking (Brewer et al. 2011, Mrazek et al. 2014).

Executive functioning.—Given the neural changes observed, is it possible that MM 
training could address psychopathology by modulating or enhancing core cognitive 
functions? The answer to this question has strong implications for MM-based clinical 
intervention since virtually all forms of psychopathology are characterized by deficits or 
dysfunctions in cognitive processing.

With regard to MM-related changes in performance on standard neurocognitive tasks, 
findings have been modest. Chiesa et al. (2011) reviewed 23 studies of MM effects on 
cognitive abilities and found effects primarily on attentional performance: MMBIs, mostly 
in health samples, were associated with some improvements in the selective and executive 
components of attention, while in case–control studies of longer-term practitioners, MM 
training was associated with improvements in sustained attention. Gallant (2016) examined 
MM training and executive functioning across the subdomains of response inhibition, 
working memory updating, and mental set shifting. Among 12 studies (10 intervention, 2 
case–control) that included measures of executive function, Gallant (2016) noted positive 
effects in 5 of 6 studies on inhibition; and working memory updating was improved in all 3 
studies that tested it, albeit using measures that depend on sustained attention. However, 
only 1 of 5 studies examining set shifting showed performance improvement. Using more 
restrictive criteria, Lao et al. (2016) reviewed neuropsychological outcomes associated 
specifically with standardized 8-week MMBIs. Among 18 qualifying studies, Lao et al. 
(2016) found minimal support for improvements in attentional performance or executive 
functioning, noting that positive findings on inhibition were potentially confounded with 
changes in motivation and task strategy.

In light of these findings, expectations should be tempered for MMBI-related enhancement 
in classical measures of cognitive function, although studies of experienced meditators, 
while correlational in nature, suggest that improvements may emerge with longer-term 
training (e.g., Lutz et al. 2008b). The possibility that MM protects against degradation in 
cognitive abilities due to stress, as observed in predeployment military personnel by Jha et 
al. (2010, 2015), also deserves further investigation. Critically, evidence in clinical 
populations remains sparse and was not examined separately in the above reviews. Thus, it 
remains important to include carefully selected neurocognitive measures in clinical MMBI 
research designs.

Targeted capacities.—In contrast to conventional executive functioning measures, 
training effects have been more apparent on tasks and measures more directly linked to the 
capacities trained in MM. For example, Lao et al.’s (2016) review of cognitive performance 
measures did observe MMBI-related improvements on behavioral tasks designed to assess 
meta-awareness, cognitive flexibility, and memory specificity. Findings on meta-awareness, 
in particular, accord with a separate line of experimental studies on mind wandering in the 
form of task-unrelated thought (Schooler et al. 2011). In paradigms that combine 
spontaneous and timed probes of participants’ mental focus on task-relevant versus task-
unrelated thought, validated by their successful prediction of behavioral indicators of 
distraction, MM training has been associated with both reduced mind wandering and 
increased meta-awareness of distraction (Mrazek et al. 2014).

Attentional capture.—Developing the capacity to detect and disengage from attentional 
capture by future- or past-orienting thinking (mental time travel; Suddendorf & Corballis 
2007) holds a special theoretical relevance for psychopathology. Task-unrelated thought, 
neurally subserved by the DMN, is known to be biased toward negative affect and self-
relevant content, both hallmarks of maladaptive thinking patterns (Watkins 2008). The 
inability to disengage from such patterns leads to repetitive negative thinking, which is 
believed to contribute substantially to depression, anxiety, addictive craving, and pain-
related distress among other pathologies (e.g., Miloyan et al. 2014, Tapper 2018, Zeidan & 
Vago 2016). As we discuss applications of MM to specific clinical targets, we detail the 
empirical findings that provide relatively robust support for reductions in attentional capture 
as an important transdiagnostic mechanism by which MM practice can ameliorate 
psychiatric symptoms.

Affective Systems

The RDoC matrix (Insel et al. 2010) distinguishes between negative valence systems that 
drive responses to aversive stimuli and positive valence systems underlying responses to 
motivational stimuli. Negative valence processes potentially impacted by MM include loss, 
acute threat, and sustained threat (Garland et al. 2017, Hölzel et al. 2011, Tang et al. 2015). 
MM also may impact positive valence–related processes including approach, responsiveness 
to reward, reward anticipation, and habit (Garland & Howard 2018, Hölzel et al. 2011, Lutz 
et al. 2015, Tang et al. 2015). Four key ways in which MM may modulate these systems are 
enhanced emotion awareness, altered emotional reactivity, promotion of cognitive 
reappraisal, and altered reward processing. Notably, in recent meta-analyses (Fox et al. 2014, 
2016), MM practice was consistently associated with changes in the structure and function 
of regions integral to emotion appraisal, reactivity, and regulation, including the amygdala, 
ACC, ventromedial PFC, and hippocampus.

Enhanced emotion awareness.—Through cultivating meta-awareness of mental 
processes and contents and maintaining present-focused attention, MM may improve the 
ability to detect and recognize emotional states, thus allowing for their regulation via 
conscious executive control and entrainment of automatic regulatory circuits (Lutz et al. 
2015). One way this may occur is through improved interoception, or the perception of 
internal bodily states (Farb et al. 2012, 2015), although evidence for MM-related 
improvements in interoception has been mixed (Farb et al. 2015, Haase et al. 2016, Khalsa et 
al. 2008).

Altered emotional reactivity.—Cultivation of nonreactivity and dereification may alter 
the coupling between perception and the appraisal of environmental stimuli (Lutz et al. 
2015). Clinicians familiar with exposure therapy for panic disorder know that on its own, 
heightened perceptual awareness of stimuli such as bodily sensations can, in fact, heighten 
emotional reactivity and exacerbate anxiety symptoms (McNally 2007). However, it is 
proposed that the incorporation of dereification and nonreactivity in MM training reverses 
this effect (Creswell & Lindsay 2014). In particular, the repeated experience of affective 
states without avoidance or distraction by elaborative thoughts may constitute a form of 
exposure, leading to habituation or extinction of conditioned emotional reactions (Baer

2003, Phelps et al. 2004, Tang et al. 2015). Notably, reduced amygdala activation during an 
affect-eliciting task has been observed in experienced MM practitioners relative to 
nonmeditating controls (Kral et al. 2018). Similar effects were seen for participants in 
MBSR relative to an active control intervention, who furthermore, exhibited increased 
connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial PFC (Kral et al. 2018), a key circuit in 
extinction learning (Phelps et al. 2004).

Cognitive reappraisal.—Cognitive reappraisal involves adopting an altered mental 
interpretation of a situation or stimulus to promote a more adaptive emotional response. MM 
training does not explicitly target cognitive reappraisal (Lutz et al. 2015), but it has been 
proposed to facilitate it indirectly in several ways (e.g., Garland et al. 2014a). Specifically, 
practicing nonreactivity by decoupling a stimulus from its habitual appraisal value may 
promote cognitive flexibility and, thus, facilitate more adaptive appraisals (Lutz et al. 2015). 
Present-centered awareness may also promote reappraisal of inaccurate valuations via the 
gathering of novel information from the environment (Garland et al. 2014a). While 
behavioral evidence associating MM training with increased cognitive reappraisal is lacking, 
reductions in self-reported stress have been shown to be mediated by self-reported 
reappraisal use among MMBI participants (Garland et al. 2011).

Altered reward processing.—Evidence regarding the effects of MM on reward 
processing has emerged from the study of reward-related disorders. For example, a brief, 
lab-based instruction to mindfully attend to smoking images reduced craving, activation of 
the subgenual ACC, and ACC connectivity to the insula and ventral striatum compared with 
passively viewing the images (Westbrook et al. 2013). MM training was also associated with 
lower activation of the amygdala and insula during exposure to a personally relevant 
stressful stimulus compared with a standard cognitive behavioral treatment for smokers, and 
lowered stress-related activation in these regions was associated with reduced smoking 
among participants (Kober et al. 2017). Finally, experienced MM practitioners have shown 
altered neural activity relative to nonmeditators during reward anticipation, with reduced 
caudate activation and connectivity with bilateral insula during the anticipation of monetary 
reward and reduced activation of the ventromedial PFC at reward receipt (Kirk et al. 2015).

Research on the cognitive and affective mechanisms of MM is still at a preliminary stage, 
and generating a robust evidence base will require overcoming methodological limitations in 
the literature. One obstacle is the reliance on self-reported measures for key mechanistic 
constructs, which allows for potentially confounding demand characteristics. Such measures 
also frequently rely on participants’ capacities for accurate introspection, which may be 
confounded with MM practice expertise (Davidson & Kaszniak 2015). Interpretations of the 
neural evidence of the mechanisms of MM also strongly depends on reverse inference, from 
brain activity to behavior, a practice that can easily mislead (Van Dam et al. 2018). Both of 
these obstacles can be addressed by developing and using robust behavioral tasks to assess 
components of MM training, such as those developed for the study of meta-awareness and 
distraction (Mrazek et al. 2014). Nevertheless, enough evidence has accumulated to suggest 
that MM does have significant effects on at least some mechanisms of action that are 
directly relevant to psychopathological processes.

APPLICATIONS TO PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

Depression

MM has been studied extensively for the treatment of depression, pain, anxiety, and 
substance use. For these areas, we briefly review the conceptual relevance of MM, the 
clinical and translational evidence for the applicability of MMBIs, neurobehavioral evidence 
regarding the potential mechanisms of action from an RDoC perspective, and priorities for 
future research. In discussing outcomes, we feature findings from a recent meta-analysis by 
Goldberg et al. (2018b), which addresses the transdiagnostic nature of MM by examining 
effect sizes on disorder-specific symptoms across diagnostic conditions and differentiates 
effects by control condition [wait-list, specific or nonspecific active control, or evidence-
based treatment (EBT); see Figure 1]. While Goldberg et al. (2018b) confirmed that the 
MMBI literature appears to be affected by the common issue of publication bias (Coronado-
Montoya et al. 2016), the application of bias correction through trim-and-fill analyses did 
not alter the direction or statistical significance of the observed effects.

Research on the application of MMBI to the treatment of depression, most notably the 
prevention of relapse in major depressive disorder, is arguably the most robust research 
corpus focused on a specific psychiatric condition. The early development and codification 
of MBCT (Segal et al. 2002) has facilitated a series of RCTs coupled with basic research on 
the mechanisms of MBCT.

Clinical applications.—MBCT has been shown to reduce the risk of depressive relapse 
for patients with recurrent depression at 60-week follow-up when compared with patients 
not receiving MBCT (hazard ratio = 0.69; Kuyken et al. 2016). It also appears that MBCT 
may be effective for treating current depression relative to wait-list conditions at 
posttreatment (d = 0.71 across ten studies) and similar to other active therapies (d = 0.002 
across six studies; Goldberg et al., in press), although less is known about its effects at long-
term follow-up. Evidence examining the efficacy of MMBIs in general for depression 
suggests superiority to no treatment (d = 0.59) and other active therapies (d = 0.38) and 
equivalence to gold-standard EBTs, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or 
antidepressant medications (d = −0.01; Goldberg et al. 2018b), with similar results at long-
term follow-up. An exemplar of rigorous RCTs in this area is a trial conducted by Kuyken et 
al. (2015) that compared MBCT to antidepressant medications (n = 424), finding no 
differences between the treatments in regard to depressive relapse or cost-effectiveness. A 
significant strength of research on MMBIs for depression is the frequency of comparison 
with frontline EBTs (e.g., k = 10 comparisons in 1,064 participants treated with EBTs in 
Goldberg et al. 2018b).

Implicated mechanisms.—Mechanistic research supports the efficacy of MBCT in 
targeting depressogenic cognitive processes. MM training is designed to help practitioners 
exit depressive rumination by returning attention to the present moment, with dereification 
also reducing the emotional salience of ruminative thought processes. Indeed, in reviews of 
mechanistic and mediational evidence, both self-reported and laboratory measures of 
rumination have been predictive of treatment response (Alsubaie et al. 2017, van der Velden

et al. 2015). MBCT has also been found to reduce overly generalized autobiographical 
memory (Williams et al. 2000) and increase the ability to suppress irrelevant mental sets 
(Greenberg et al. 2017). Neurally, this account is supported by findings of MM-related 
decreases in DMN activation and increases in DMN connectivity with the dorsolateral PFC, 
with associations of the former with self-referential and discursive thought and of the latter 
with top-down attentional control (Brewer et al. 2011).

Research priorities.—With a substantial body of clinical trial research supporting MM 
for preventing depressive relapse, dissemination and implementation studies may be 
particularly relevant at this stage. Work on technology-augmented or technology-based 
forms of MBCT has begun (e.g., Dimidjian et al. 2014) and may help increase access. The 
mood components of medical conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes; Tovote et al. 2014) may also 
be a fruitful avenue for further MMBI development. Research linking MM with the neural 
circuitry underlying physical health and illness may also be particularly valuable, as MM has 
been found to modulate inflammatory and endocrine processes that are implicated in many 
chronic physical illnesses (e.g., Rosenkranz et al. 2013).

Despite early interest in the application of MM to anxiety disorders (Kabat-Zinn et al. 1992), 
significantly less research has evaluated MM for anxiety relative to depression. No single 
MMBI has emerged as a dominant MM-based treatment approach for anxiety, although 
trials have evaluated both MBCT (e.g., Kocovski et al. 2013) and MBSR (e.g., Goldin et al. 
2016) for this purpose.

Clinical applications.—MMBIs appear to reduce anxiety symptoms in patients when 
compared with no-treatment controls (e.g., d = 0.89; Goldberg et al. 2018b). However, their 
efficacy relative to other active interventions is less clear. MMBIs appear similar to other 
therapies (d = 0.15) and frontline EBTs, which include exposure-based therapies (d = −0.18; 
Goldberg et al. 2018b). Here, while MMBIs show efficacy, further work is needed to clarify 
the specific benefits of this approach to treatment. An exemplar in this regard is a study by 
Hoge et al. (2013) that randomly assigned 89 participants to either MBSR or a stress 
management psychoeducation group. Both groups showed comparable reductions in 
clinician-rated anxiety. However, relatively larger reductions were found in the MBSR 
condition on measures of clinician-rated global severity, self-reported anxiety, and stress 
reactivity in response to a laboratory-based social stress task (the Trier Social Stress Test).

Implicated mechanisms.—As with depression, a primary candidate mechanism for the 
effects of MM on anxiety is a reduction in repetitive negative thinking (Gu et al. 2015). For 
example, one RCT of MBSR for social anxiety also found indications of changes in self-
related processing: Among MBSR participants, the reduction in negative self-related beliefs 
and associated activity in the dorsomedial PFC (a structure associated with self-relevant 
cognition) were both predictive of treatment response (Goldin et al. 2012). Another obvious 
candidate mechanism is exposure leading to reduced reactivity in individuals exposed to 
both cognitive and physiological symptoms of anxiety during MM practice (Baer 2003, 
McNally 2007). Decreased self-reported anxiety in anxiety patients following brief MM

Pain

training was associated with increased activation in regions of the brain that are important in 
affective appraisal and responding (the ventromedial PFC, ACC, and insula) during 
meditation compared with rest (Zeidan et al. 2014). Facilitation by MM training of top-down 
regulation of reactivity to ambiguous stimuli is consistent with an observed correlation 
between increased PFC–amygdala connectivity and reduced symptoms in patients 
withgeneralized anxiety following an MBSR course (Hölzel et al. 2013). Dereification of 
anxiety-related cognitions may contribute to both of these processes, with self-reported 
dereification having been shown to mediate the effects of MBSR on symptoms of 
generalized anxiety (Hoge et al. 2015).

Research priorities.—Paralleling MBCT for depression, it may be valuable to develop 
and test MMBIs specifically designed for anxiety. Efforts to customize MMBIs to anxiety 
symptoms would be consistent with meta-analytic evidence that symptom-focused 
psychotherapies for anxiety are most effective (Yulish et al. 2017). Other important 
questions for future research include determining the degree to which MMBIs are acceptable 
vis-à-vis frontline exposure-based treatments with known risks for drop out (Imel et al. 
2013), although the evidence does not suggest that attrition differs between MM and 
comparison conditions (Hedman-Lagerlöf et al. 2018).

Because the first MBSR curriculum was designed to address the challenges of coping with 
pain in clinical settings (Kabat-Zinn et al. 1985), pain syndromes have been important 
targets for MMBIs. This emphasis can be traced further back to traditional MM instructions 
on the use of mindfulness training to decouple pain sensations from emotional distress 
(Thanissaro Bhikkhu 1997).

Clinical applications.—Reduced pain symptoms and improved quality of life in response 
to MM training were first reported in empirical trials of MBSR (Kabat-Zinn et al. 1985). A 
recent quantitative review of pain-related outcome measures across 24 studies with a 
cumulative total of 1,534 participants found MMBIs superior to no intervention (d = 0.45) 
and on par with active controls (d = 0.03) (Goldberg et al. 2018b). These conclusions were 
consistent with a previous comprehensive meta-analysis of meditation-based interventions 
(Goyal et al. 2014). MMBIs have shown significant benefits for quality of life and more 
limited evidence for reductions in pain across multiple pain-related syndromes including 
fibromyalgia, migraine, and chronic pelvic pain (Hilton et al. 2017). Prominent among 
recent studies is a large (n = 342) RCT of MBSR for low back pain, which found 
improvements in functioning and pain-related distress relative to treatment as usual (TAU) 
that were equivalent to those observed in a CBT comparison condition and were sustained at 
2-year follow-up (Cherkin et al. 2017).

Implicated mechanisms.—MM practice appears to have neural and behavioral effects 
on pain processing distinct from opioids, placebo expectancy, or sham interventions (Zeidan 
et al. 2015, 2016). After brief MM training, reductions in perceived pain intensity and 
unpleasantness have been associated with activation in appraisal circuitry including the 
orbitofrontal cortex, ACC, and anterior insula (Zeidan & Vago 2016). Among experienced

MM practitioners, the selective reduction in pain unpleasantness relative to intensity (Lutz et 
al. 2013, Perlman et al. 2010) also suggests decreased affective reactivity. The deactivation 
of sensory gating circuitry in the thalamus during pain suggests that the present-centered 
awareness cultivated in MM may also modulate pain signaling at a perceptual stage (Zeidan 
et al. 2015). Present-moment awareness may also contribute to the inhibition of aversive 
anticipatory cognition: Experienced MM practitioners exhibit reduced activity in the 
amygdala and salience network regions (the ACC and anterior insula) between cue and onset 
of painful stimuli (Lutz et al. 2013). Together, these findings indicate that MM-related 
changes in sensory processing reactivity, appraisal, and pain-related cognition all may 
contribute to the amelioration of pain-related distress.

Research priorities.—While RCTs have established the efficacy of MMBIs for pain, and 
experimental studies of brief training suggest that MM provides pain relief via distinctive 
mechanisms, mechanistic studies of fully developed MMBIs are still needed to combine 
these two lines of evidence. In particular, because pain-related syndromes are characterized 
by a variety of pathogenic alterations in neural pain processing (Bushnell et al. 2013), it will 
be important to carry out mechanistic studies of MMBIs in specific clinical populations. 
Finally, for public health reasons, transdiagnostic applications of MMBIs to chronic pain in 
the context of long-term opioid use should be a high priority (see Garland et al. 2014c for 
one such initiative).

Substance Use

During the past decade, there has been increasing interest in applying MMBIs to substance 
use disorders, including the development of several novel MMBIs targeted at treating these 
disorders [e.g., mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) for alcohol and drug use 
disorders (Bowen et al. 2014); mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement (MORE) for 
opiate use disorder (Garland et al. 2014b)].

Clinical applications.—MMBIs for substance use disorders have typically joined content 
and structure similar to MBSR with CBT-derived addiction treatment components (e.g., risk 
assessment for relapse prevention; Bowen et al. 2014). Evidence for MMBIs for substance 
use disorders is generally promising. Li et al. (2017) evaluated 34 RCTs, finding that MM 
treatments were superior to control conditions (e.g., TAU, CBT) in reducing substance use 
frequency, use-related problems, and craving. Goldberg et al. (2018b) reported that MMBIs 
were superior to other active therapies (d = 0.27), with MM outperforming EBTs for 
smoking cessation (d = 0.42). These findings contrast with Goyal et al.’s (2014) report of 
insufficient trials to assess these outcomes. This discrepancy may be due, in part, to 
additional studies having been published in recent years. One exemplar study in this area is a 
trial conducted by Bowen et al. (2014) comparing MBRP to relapse prevention (based on 
CBT) and TAU (12-step-based treatment) in 286 participants with substance use disorders, 
with MBRP showing fewer days of substance use compared with both relapse prevention 
and TAU at 12-month follow-up.

Implicated mechanisms.—Proposed mechanisms underlying the efficacy of MMBIs for 
substance use disorders include response inhibition and extinction (Tapper 2018), as well as

changes in reward processing (Garland & Howard 2018). MM-related reductions in smoking 
have been associated with lower amygdala and insula activation in response to stress cues, 
and MM training reduced stress-related activation in these brain regions compared with CBT 
(Kober et al. 2017). It has also been proposed that MM may increase top-down regulation, 
reducing automaticity (or autopilot) associated with substance use and decreasing drug-use 
attentional bias (Brewer et al. 2013). Moreover, the reduction in smoking behavior following 
brief MM training has been associated with increased resting activation within the ACC and 
medial PFC, thus linking the activation of these emotion-regulatory brain regions to relevant 
behavioral outcomes (Tang et al. 2016).

Research priorities.—MMBIs may be promising candidates for incorporation into 
recently developed adaptive interventions that harness mobile technology to deliver 
contextually tailored treatment (e.g., in response to situations with high relapse risk; 
Gustafson et al. 2014, Nahum-Shani et al. 2018). Given strong neuroscientific models of 
substance use (Koob & Volkow 2016), the use of mechanistic clinical trial designs 
combining neural and behavioral measures will be especially valuable in this area.

EMERGING TARGETS

Attention Disorders

Interest in the application of MMBIs to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has 
increased in recent years (Cairncross & Miller 2016). Given that MM involves the 
cultivation of specific attentional capacities (Lutz et al. 2008b), the pairing of MM with 
ADHD is a logical clinical application. However, much of the research on MMBIs for 
ADHD has been limited to non-RCTs. Cairncross & Miller (2016) reviewed 10 studies (4 
with wait-list control, 6 with pre-and posttest design) with adult, child, and adolescent 
samples, and they reported moderate effects on inattention (d = −0.66) and hyperactivity (d 
= −0.53). Both of the RCTs in adults included in this meta-analysis (Hepark et al. 2015, 
Mitchell et al. 2017) reported improvements in self-rated and clinician-rated ADHD 
symptoms in the MM group relative to wait-list controls, with moderate effect size. Mitchell 
et al. (2017) found no group differences on neurocognitive tests of attention and executive 
function, albeit within a small sample (n = 20). Therefore, one potential mechanism of 
action of MMBIs for ADHD may be improved meta-awareness leading to a reduction in 
attentional capture by task-unrelated thoughts, given findings of MM-related improvement 
in these capacities in both laboratory tasks and samples of experienced meditators (Lao et al. 
2016, Mrazek et al. 2014). Currently, there is a dearth of RCTs assessing the impact of 
MMBIs on ADHD. Mechanistic RCTs that examine how performance on meta-awareness 
tasks relates to behavioral symptoms of ADHD may be particularly valuable.

Posttraumatic Stress

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related syndromes are characterized by 
hyperactivation and context-insensitivity of negative affective systems, accompanied by 
avoidance of trauma-relevant stimuli. The cultivation of present-centered awareness in 
formal MM has the potential to improve the regulation of negative affective systems by 
modulating immediate emotional reactivity and facilitating exposure to unpleasant stimuli.

Meanwhile, reduced cognitive elaboration and increased flexibility in appraisal due to 
dereification may facilitate the restructuring of maladaptive trauma-related cognitions.

Because tolerability, adherence, and retention are challenges in trauma-focused treatment 
(Imel et al. 2013), adapting MMBIs to PTSD requires paying particular attention to these 
areas. Suitability must be considered as well: For individuals presenting with extreme 
emotion dysregulation, attempting to engage nonreactively with internal stimuli for 
sustained periods in formal MM practice may prove excessively challenging, and using an 
intervention focused on informal (i.e., not meditation-based) mindfulness practices 
accompanied by self-regulation skills has been recommended as an effective alternative 
(Linehan 1993).

The RCT evidence base for trauma-focused MMBIs remains limited. However, an initial 
meta-analytic review of 18 clinical trials supports their effectiveness relative to a wait-list 
control in a broad range of conditions (Hedges’ g = −0.44; Hopwood & Schutte 2017), with 
symptom reduction further associated with the extent of MM training. Neuroimaging of 
military veterans participating in a mindfulness-based exposure therapy (MBET) protocol 
developed by King et al. (2016b) found that MM practice was associated with increased 
activation of the medial PFC and reduced activation of the amygdala during the viewing of 
angry faces, consistent with the inhibition of socioemotional threat signaling. Participants in 
the MBET intervention, but not those in a group psychotherapy control intervention, showed 
increased connectivity between regions of the DMN (PCC) and CEN (dorsolateral PFC), 
once again suggesting improved regulation of negative repetive thought (King et al. 2016a). 
A critical issue for ongoing research on trauma-focused MMBIs is to explore their role in 
multicomponent treatments; for example, MMBIs may have particular value for enhancing 
emotion regulation skills prior to exposure therapy, for addressing comorbid and residual 
symptoms, and for relapse prevention (King & Favorite 2016).

Disordered Eating and Obesity

The majority of the research on MMBIs for disordered eating has focused on applications to 
unrestrained eating (i.e., binge eating and obesity) rather than restrictive eating (i.e., 
anorexia nervosa). The most widely studied MMBI in this area is mindfulness-based eating 
awareness training (MB-EAT; Kristeller et al. 2014). Within MB-EAT, MM is included to 
bring increased awareness to eating experiences (e.g., awareness of satiety cues); increase 
hedonic pleasure from smaller amounts of food; disrupt the link between harsh self-
judgment, eating behavior, and negative affect; and increase self-acceptance (Kristeller & 
Wolever 2010). Three recent meta-analyses have examined the effects of MMBIs on weight 
and eating outcomes, two of which failed to find evidence for MMBIs on weight loss or 
body mass index (BMI), although positive effects of MMBIs were noted on measures of 
eating attitudes and behaviors (Rogers et al. 2017, Ruffault et al. 2017). Of note, analyses 
may have been underpowered to detect small effects on BMI (e.g., g = 0.30 to 0.34; Rogers 
et al. 2017). Goldberg et al. (2018b), who combined eating- and weight-related outcomes, 
reported a large effect when MMBIs were compared with no treatment (d = 0.79) and no 
difference when compared with other active therapies (d = 0.08). While several potential 
mechanisms of action have been proposed (e.g., enhanced emotion regulation and self-

regulatory abilities, increased awareness of interoceptive cues; Alberts et al. 2012, Kristeller 
et al. 2014), few studies have examined these mechanisms of change directly. One recent 
study found that changes in reward-driven eating (i.e., eating due to loss of control, lack of 
satiety, and preoccupation with food) mediated the effects of MM-based treatment on weight 
loss at 12-month follow-up (Mason et al. 2016). Given the often-lengthy course of metabolic 
changes and evidence that treatment effects are moderated by the length of follow-up 
(Ruffault et al. 2017), studies including long-term follow-up are crucial.

Serious Mental Illness

The possibility that MM may be safe and efficacious for treating serious mental illness, 
including psychotic and bipolar disorders, has only recently been proposed. Given the public 
health costs associated with serious mental illness, along with the side effect profiles of 
many antipsychotic and mood stabilizer medications, there is a recognized need for effective 
behavioral therapies (Murray et al. 2017). As with other disorders, interventions have been 
developed combining MM training with elements from standard CBT-based treatments (e.g., 
identifying negative schemata; Chadwick et al. 2016). Goldberg et al. (2018b) included 
seven studies (n = 456) in a meta-analysis examining the effects of MMBIs relative to no 
treatment on symptoms of psychosis, finding moderate effects at posttreatment (d = 0.50) 
and large effects at follow-up (d = 1.18). Chu et al. (2018) reported no effects of MMBIs on 
depression or anxiety symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder across three RCTs in 
another meta-analysis, although effect sizes were in the moderate range (g = 0.46 and 0.58 
for depression and anxiety, respectively). MMBIs for psychosis have emphasized the 
application of mindful awareness to psychotic experiences (Chadwick et al. 2016, Wang et 
al. 2016), with the intention of reducing distress and disturbance associated with these 
experiences rather than reducing their frequency. While evidence does suggest that distress 
and disturbance associated with psychosis reduces following MMBIs (Chadwick et al. 
2016), it has not been established that these changes predict reductions in psychotic 
symptoms. There are few studies that specify unique mechanisms of action in MMBIs for 
bipolar disorder, although mechanisms proposed for treating depression and anxiety (i.e., 
improved emotion regulation, reduced repetitive negative thinking) may be relevant. It will 
be important to assess the potential iatrogenic effects of MM on psychotic symptoms, given 
evidence that some forms of intensive meditation practice have been associated with 
psychotic experiences (Lindahl et al. 2017).

PRACTICAL CONCERNS

Demonstrating the efficacy of MMBIs in research settings does not ensure their effectiveness 
in real-world clinical practice. Important considerations and potential stumbling blocks 
associated with bringing MMBIs to health-care consumers include issues of implementation 
and dissemination; training and treatment fidelity; questions regarding format, duration, and 
setting; and issues of access and cultural fit.

Implementation and Dissemination

As noted by Dimidjian & Segal (2015), the vast majority of research on MMBIs has been 
focused on intervention generation and refinement (i.e., National Institutes of Health Stage I

research). For several disorders reviewed here, numerous efficacy studies (i.e., testing 
interventions in research settings; Stage II) have been conducted, many including desirable 
design features, such as active comparison conditions, lengthy follow-up periods, and large 
sample sizes (Goldberg et al. 2017). In contrast, few studies have examined the process or 
impact of implementing MMBIs in actual clinical practice, either through efficacy trials in 
community clinics (i.e., testing in community settings while maintaining a high level of 
control and oversight; Stage III), effectiveness studies (i.e., implementation by community 
providers in routine conditions; Stage IV), or explicit implementation and dissemination 
research (i.e., studying methods for deployment in community settings; Stage V). Indeed, 
MBCT appears to be the only MMBI for which there is implementation and dissemination 
research.

Due to the rigorous research that has been done evaluating MBCT, it may serve as a valuable 
test case for the implementation and dissemination of other MMBIs. MBCT has been 
recommended for preventing depressive relapse by the United Kingdom’s (UK) National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE 2018). Yet despite this approval and even 
within a single-payer health-care system, implementation and dissemination has not been 
straightforward. Crane & Kuyken (2013) discuss a host of barriers identified by stakeholders 
(e.g., clinicians and MBCT teachers working in the UK’s National Health Service) 
associated with the implementation of MBCT. The majority (59%) of respondents reported 
that MBCT services either do not exist within their organization or do not play a major part 
and operate with limited organizational support. Respondents also identified structural, 
cultural, educational, physical, and technological challenges. It is likely that similar barriers 
will be relevant for other MMBIs that garner empirical support warranting their 
implementation and dissemination within health-care systems.

Training and Treatment Fidelity

One implementation challenge highlighted by Crane & Kuyken (2013) is the training of MM 
teachers. While many of the clinical competencies required for the effective delivery of 
MMBIs likely overlap with general clinical skills (e.g., the ability to form a strong 
therapeutic alliance with clients; Wampold & Imel 2015), it has been repeatedly asserted that 
a depth of MM experience is vital for MM teachers (Kabat-Zinn 2011). While routes to 
certification exist for MBCT and MBSR (Crane et al. 2013), the associated time and 
financial costs will likely be infeasible for many clinicians delivering MMBIs. Thus, 
carefully investigating the impact of teacher variables on clinical outcomes will be critical in 
setting pragmatic standards for MM teachers’ background and training.

One advancement in the area of training has been the development and validation of 
measures of MMBI adherence and competency. In psychotherapy research, adherence has 
been defined as “the degree to which therapists are delivering the theory-specified 
techniques or methods of the intervention” and competence as “the skill with which these 
techniques or methods are implemented” (Webb et al. 2010, p. 201). Three measures of this 
kind have been developed that are specific to MMBIs, and they have varying degrees of 
supporting reliability and validity evidence (Chawla et al. 2010, Crane et al. 2013, Segal et

al. 2002). However, the adoption of fidelity assessment remains limited (32.4% of RCTs for 
psychiatric disorders; Goldberg et al. 2017).

It may also be worthwhile exploring MM teachers’ behaviors and characteristics that go 
beyond adherence and competence, particularly given the inconsistent (or null) link between 
adherence and competence with treatment outcome in psychotherapy (Webb et al. 2010). 
MM researchers may consider exploring other psychotherapy process variables related to the 
MM teacher, such as the therapeutic alliance, that have been linked to outcome in MMBIs 
(Bowen & Kurz 2012, Goldberg et al. 2013) and in psychotherapy generally (Flückiger et al. 
2018). Such explorations would be in keeping with broader efforts within the field of 
psychotherapy research that are aimed at leveraging therapists’ contributions to outcome 
(i.e., therapist effects; Baldwin & Imel 2013, Goldberg et al. 2018a).

Duration, Format, and Practice Setting

Treatment dosage, the format of training, and the practice setting are key practical 
considerations for implementing MMBIs. While MMBIs are derived from Buddhist 
contemplative traditions that have historically been practiced intensively for decades (e.g., in 
monastic communities), MMBIs have typically matched the MBSR course in duration and 
structure (i.e., 8 weeks in length; Kabat-Zinn 1990). Many consumers of MMBIs find this 
structure acceptable. Yet for others, this intensity of intervention is not feasible or desirable. 
Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of 43 studies assessing the relationship between practice time 
and outcome indicated that, on average, MBSR and MBCT participants complete only 64% 
of the recommended amount of home MM practice (i.e., 29 minutes per day; Parsons et al. 
2017). The continued engagement with home MM practice postintervention is less clear (a 
maximum of 18.7 minutes per day for studies reviewed by Vettese et al. 2009). Additionally, 
no systematic study has yet been conducted to determine the optimal duration and density of 
practice. For example, if an individual were to practice for 20 minutes per day, is it best to 
complete the practice in one 20-minute period, two 10-minute periods, or five 4-minute 
periods? The answer to this question is likely to vary for different types of individuals. How 
to determine the optimal regimen for a particular individual is a critical question that 
requires dedicated study.

Currently, the amount of course instruction necessary to confer benefits is not clear. 
Clarifying this area is vital, as effective, brief MMBIs could significantly increase 
penetration. The potential for more intensive intervention modalities (e.g., meditation 
retreats) should also be explored. Preliminary meta-analytic evidence suggests that 
meditation retreats are associated with moderate to large effects on measures of anxiety, 
depression, stress, and quality of life (Khoury et al. 2017).

There are additional underexplored settings in which (or through which) MMBIs may be 
implemented. In particular, the increasing ubiquity and sophistication of mobile technologies 
offer the possibility for vastly increased reach. Several models for the mobile delivery of 
MMBIs have appeared in the literature, including the development of treatment-specific 
mobile applications and web-based delivery platforms (Davis et al. 2014, Dimidjian et al. 
2014) and delivery in real time through telehealth technology (Niles et al. 2012). Initial 
research in this area suggests that MMBIs delivered online show small but significant effects

on depression, anxiety, and well-being (Spijkerman et al. 2016). It is imperative that 
technologies that purport to promote mindfulness include meaningful MM training (i.e., they 
are not mindfulness in name only). Ideally, technology development will be paired with 
efficacy research (as has been done for Headspace; https://www.headspace.com/), which 
appears far from the current norm (Mani et al. 2015).

Access and Cultural Fit

The availability of high-quality MMBIs delivered in-person or through mobile technologies 
represents a central aspect of treatment access. But for access to translate into treatment 
engagement, health-care consumers must also find treatments culturally accessible and 
treatment providers culturally competent (Betancourt et al. 2003). It is difficult to determine 
the cultural accessibility of standard MMBIs within underrepresented populations (e.g., 
racial and ethnic minorities, individuals from lower socioeconomic status backgrounds) due 
to the limited research on this topic (Waldron et al. 2018). Nonetheless, there is reason to 
believe that MMBIs may be effective for underrepresented populations, with a meta-analysis 
combining mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for underrepresented groups 
reporting treatment effects in the moderate-to-large range (overall g = 0.69; Fuchs et al. 
2013). Future research could explore cultural adaptations of traditional MMBIs, given that 
culture-specific modifications have been shown to improve outcomes in psychotherapy 
(Benish et al. 2011). While promising theoretical work has begun at this juncture (e.g., 
Woods-Giscombé & Black 2010), intervention development and testing are sorely needed.

CHALLENGES AND CAUTIONS

Mindfulness Hype

As popular awareness of MM has grown, articles and books in the popular press have made 
increasingly ambitious claims about its clinical benefits, frequently while citing support 
from research literature (Van Dam et al. 2018). The phenomenon of inflated expectations 
associated with a trendy field of research is not unique to MM, but nevertheless is cause for 
concern. When enthusiasm outstrips empirical support, MM interventions may be deployed 
prematurely in contexts in which they are untested, ineffective, or even contraindicated, as 
discussed in the next section. For MMBIs to be considered credible evidence-based 
interventions, their adoption must be paced and tied to clear standards, such as those 
developed by Crane et al. (2013), while claims regarding safety and efficacy must accurately 
reflect the extent and quality of the evidence base.

Risks, Adverse Events, and Contraindications

As the practice of MM becomes more widespread, so does the potential impact of any 
adverse responses. MM is widely perceived as benign, but adverse events that may have 
been induced by MM have been documented. Most concerning are case reports gathered by 
Van Dam et al. (2018) and Lindahl et al. (2017) involving the onset of psychosis, mania, or 
suicidal ideation. Multiple factors could contribute to such incidents—especially prior 
psychiatric morbidity—and the incidence of such events relative to the population rate 
remains unclear. The practice environment may also have a role, especially in the context of 
intensive retreats, during which conditions such as restricted sleep time and reduced social

contact may have a destabilizing effect for some individuals. As with any clinical 
intervention, the possibility that MM could exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in some 
circumstances must be taken seriously and addressed appropriately. First, the delivery of 
MMBIs targeting psychiatric symptoms should be supervised by clinically trained 
personnel. Second, guidelines could be developed regarding MM interventions and 
populations that may be at increased risk or for whom the interventions may be 
contraindicated. Finally, formal reporting systems for adverse events are needed to improve 
systematic data gathering.

Responses to MM involving anxiety, panic, and trauma-related symptoms may deserve 
distinct consideration. Enhanced exposure to internal stimuli, both pleasant and aversive, is 
an intended component of MM practice (Lutz et al. 2015) and, moreover, has been proposed 
as a mechanism for improved affect regulation in MM (Tang et al. 2015). Even in a 
therapeutic context, exposure to aversive stimuli remains distressing, by definition. However, 
when planned and controlled, exposure is also a well-established, effective 
psychotherapeutic technique (McNally 2007). Thus, this aspect of MM practice may be best 
addressed by ensuring the quality of instructional guidance and appropriateness of dosage 
and setting.

Methodological and Theoretical Concerns

The increasingly high profile of MM practices has brought increased scrutiny to the rigor of 
research in this area. Some of the challenges facing MM are common to all psychological 
research. For example, concerns about replicability and publication bias (Coronado-
Montoya et al. 2016) are relevant across psychological (DeCoster et al. 2015) and medical 
research (Begley & Ellis 2012). Nevertheless, a recent systematic review of RCTs of MM 
for psychiatric conditions found discouraging evidence regarding changes in methodological 
rigor over time (Goldberg et al. 2017). Across 142 studies, none of the six features examined 
(sample size, length of follow-up, use of active control comparison conditions, assessment of 
instructor training, assessment of treatment fidelity, use of intention-to-treat analyses) were 
increasing in frequency. It is vital that future studies include relevant and well-implemented 
active control interventions, ideally EBTs. In addition to establishing when to recommend 
MMBIs as frontline interventions, this practice can also address potential sources of bias, 
such as researcher allegiance (Munder et al. 2013) and participant expectancies.

MM research also continues to grapple with long-standing conceptual issues (Davidson & 
Kaszniak 2015, Van Dam et al. 2018). Diversity in the definitions and theoretical 
formulations of mindfulness has been widely accepted as inevitable (Van Dam et al. 2018), 
but it can generate confusion in empirical findings (Goldberg et al. 2015) and intervention 
design (Crane et al. 2017). Robust behavioral measures remain limited for key elements of 
MM, such as nonreactivity and dereification (Grossman & Van Dam 2011, Lutz et al. 2015). 
It is important to consider that the kinds of definitional and measurement challenges 
encountered in MM research are not unprecedented and have proven tractable in other areas 
of psychology, for example, in the development of rigorous research on anxiety (Davidson & 
Dahl 2017). In the case of MM, optimal responses include mapping components of MM 
training onto well-established constructs and measures; emphasizing convergent evidence

from neural, physiological, behavioral, and subjective levels of analysis; and prioritizing as 
intervention outcomes changes in observable behavior, stable personality traits, cognitive 
capacities, and clinical symptomatology (Davidson & Kaszniak 2015, Van Dam et al. 2018).

CONCLUSIONS

MM can be understood as a coherent yet adaptable family of practices that targets multiple 
neurobehavioral systems implicated in psychopathology. The evidence base for MMBIs, 
while having significant limitations, shows consistent patterns. Properly designed and 
delivered, MMBIs perform comparably to established treatments for multiple clinical targets 
including depression, anxiety, pain, and substance use. Preliminary evidence also suggests 
effectiveness in disordered eating and PTSD, with mixed results for attention disorders, and 
possible applicability to serious mental illness. Importantly, MMBIs have not thus far been 
found to outperform established disorder-specific treatments for short-term symptom 
reduction. Therefore, the clinical relevance of MM practice does not appear likely to be 
achieved via competition with such treatments. Rather, the distinctive aspects of formal MM 
practice relative to other treatment approaches may prove valuable in a clinical setting. 
Because the development of core capacities in MM targets the transdiagnostic cognitive and 
affective processes underlying multiple disorders, MM may provide a means for efficiently 
addressing the widespread occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity. Additionally, MM can be 
engaged as a self-guided health-related lifestyle behavior, similar to physical exercise, for 
cumulative benefit and preventive effects.

The field of MM research has reached a threshold of maturation from its early exploratory 
stage. To meet established standards for EBTs, future research will need to address 
methodological shortcomings and meet the standards typical for any area of clinical 
development, for example, by consistently using randomized trial designs with rigorous 
control conditions, replicating findings, and ensuring there is follow-up with studies of 
effectiveness and implementation. Consideration must also be given to the potential 
contribution of common factors across psychotherapies, such as a supportive group and 
instructor contact, in cases in which MM does not evince distinct mechanisms relative to 
active control interventions. Finally, ongoing efforts are needed to improve the coherence, 
clarity, and testability of constructs and theories that relate MM to clinical constructs, such 
as those found in the RDoC matrix.

Assessing if, where, when, and how MM-based treatments offer comparative advantages 
will be a priority for implementation research. This will require increased attention to the 
dose and setting of practice, as well as to the medium of delivery. MM training requires 
tailoring for specific targets, as with MBCT for depression relapse, MBRP and MORE for 
substance abuse, and MBET for PTSD. Ultimately, a modular intervention design might be 
optimal, with core training in MM accompanied by symptom-specific components matched 
to an individual patient’s presentation. Meanwhile, mobile technology holds great potential 
for scaling-up the availability of MMBIs; developing an evidence base for smartphone-based 
intervention should be a high priority for maximizing impact.

Theoretical models for psychopathology and practical approaches to mental health treatment 
have evolved rapidly and continuously since the establishment of a scientific approach to the 
field. Basic questions remain open regarding the mechanisms underlying psychopathology 
and effective clinical practice, especially how to address the scale, range, and complexity of 
mental health treatment needs. At its best, research on the interventions and theory 
associated with MM contributes generatively to this process, enriching the tool set available 
to clinicians and the conceptual landscape for researchers. More broadly, the contemplative 
traditions from which MM is drawn, as with many others around the world, are intellectually 
rich and highly developed, with large reserves of material unexplored in their potential for 
translation into secular contexts. Thus, the scientific study of MM and psychopathology may 
also serve as a valuable model for adapting elements from our global inheritance of 
contemplative traditions into secular, empirically validated treatments for psychopathology.

Glossary

Mindfulness meditation (MM)
a family of meditation practices that shares emphasis on reducing distraction and enhancing 
awareness of mental experience

RCT
randomized controlled trial

Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
a framework for neuroscience-driven psychopathology research based on studying 
transdiagnostic constructs across levels of analysis, from molecules to behavior

Mindfulness meditation–based intervention (MMBI)
a secular clinical intervention involving a significant component of formal mindfulness 
meditation practice

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
an 8-week program involving mindfulness meditation, discussions, and home 
practice;MBSR underlies most contemporary clinical interventions that use formal MM

Meta-awareness
the capacity of individuals to monitor and report on the current contents and processes of 
their mind

Present-centered awareness
sustained attention to current mental content, as contrasted with retrospective or prospective 
thinking (i.e., mental time travel)

driven (top-down) regulation of attention

PFC
prefrontal cortex

Salience network
a network of brain regions associated with stimulus-driven (bottom-up) attentional orienting

ACC
anterior cingulate cortex

Default mode network (DMN)

SUMMARY POINTS

Mindfulness meditation (MM) does not describe a singular technique but 
rather a family of practices, adapted from contemplative traditions to a secular 
context, which share a focus on reducing distraction and enhancing awareness 
of mental experience.

Diverse formulations of secular MM practice share a common emphasis on 
developing the core capacities of meta-awareness, present-centered 
awareness, nonreactivity to experience, and dereification, along with changes 
to self-related processing.

Converging neurobehavioral evidence suggests that the enhancement of a 
practitioner’s ability to exit unwanted attentional capture by past- and future-
orienting thinking is an important transdiagnostic mechanism by which 
training in MM alleviates psychopathology.

Preliminary evidence supports multiple additional mechanisms by which MM 
may improve functioning in positive and negative affective systems, including 
increased emotion awareness, altered emotional reactivity, exposure and 
extinction, and facilitation of cognitive reappraisal.

Substantial evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that properly 
designed and delivered mindfulness meditation–based interventions (MMBIs) 
can perform comparably to established treatments for symptoms of 
depression, anxiety, pain, and substance use.

Preliminary evidence supports potential applications to disordered eating, 
posttraumatic stress, and serious mental illness, while results have been mixed 
for attention disorders.

Because MMBIs address core processes relevant to multiple disorders, they 
hold particular potential for use in addressing psychiatric comorbidities.

The effective implementation of MMBIs requires addressing significant 
practical challenges and questions related to intervention format, training and 
fidelity, adverse event reporting, and cross-cultural fit.

Significant methodological issues in MM research have been identified, and 
while most are not unique to the field, research quality is an ongoing concern 
that must be addressed.

10.

Research on MM demonstrates the wider potential for drawing on 
contemplative traditions to enrich the field of clinical psychology.

FUTURE ISSUES

How can definitional controversies be settled so that studies of MM can rely 
on a shared set of well-defined constructs?

How can core capacities targeted by MM be more robustly operationalized 
through behavioral tasks?

In clinical populations, can MM enhance broad cognitive functions, such as 
sustained attention, or more training-specific capacities, such as meta-
awareness and cognitive flexibility?

Which of the many mechanistic models best accounts for the beneficial 
effects of mindfulness on emotion dysregulation?

How do factors such as intensity, duration, and practice context influence the 
effects of MM on psychopathology?

How can MMBIs best be tailored to address comorbidity and complement 
existing first-line care?

What formats and settings are the most safe, effective, and efficient for 
delivering MMBIs?

What are the true rates and severity of adverse effects, and how can they be 
best addressed through screening, instruction, and intervention design?

Figure 1. 
Efficacy of mindfulness meditation–based interventions (MMBIs) for well-established 
psychiatric targets, by comparison condition. Across disorders, MMBIs show efficacy 
relative to no treatment; they match or exceed active control interventions; and they perform 
on par with established evidence-based treatment (EBT). Points in the plot are sized 
proportionally to their weight in the meta-analysis by Goldberg et al. (2018b). Summary 
results are presented when at least four studies were available for a given comparison. Figure 
adapted with the authors’ permission from Goldberg et al. (2018b).
