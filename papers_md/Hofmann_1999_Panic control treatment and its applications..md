Panic Control Treatment and 
Its Applications

Panic Control Treatment (PCT) is a widely used,
empirically validated cognitive-behavioral treatment for
panic disorder. Initially developed for the treatment of
panic disorder with limited agoraphobic avoidance,
PCT more recently has been finding broader
applications. It has been used as an aid to
pharmacotherapy discontinuation in panic disorder; in
the treatment of panic attacks associated with other
disorders such as schizophrenia; and, in combination
with a situational exposure component, in the
treatment of patients with moderate to severe
agoraphobia. The authors critically review the evidence
for the clinical efficacy of PCT and recent work directed
at further enhancing the long-term efficacy and
cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Since panic disorder was formally recognized as a dis-

crete  entity  in  DSM-III,  it  has  become  one  of  the
most intensively studied anxiety disorders. By definition,
panic disorder causes significant distress or interference
with the individual’s life, exacting substantial personal
costs. In addition, the disorder imposes high direct and
indirect costs on the nation in medical resources used for
care, treatment, and rehabilitation and in reduced or lost
productivity.1

A growing body of evidence supports both the effi-
cacy  and  effectiveness  (clinical  utility)  of  psychosocial
interventions for panic disorder. For example, a recent
meta-analysis of 43 controlled studies found that cogni-
tive  and  cognitive-behavioral  treatments,  collectively,
had a higher mean treatment effect size and a lower at-
trition rate than pharmacological treatments.2 In addi-
tion, evidence is beginning to appear from naturalistic
studies that cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic dis-
order may be more cost-effective than pharmacotherapy,
even within the first treatment year.3

Yet despite the demonstrated efficacy and favorable
cost  profile  of  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  for  panic
disorder,4 most patients treated in clinical practice set-
tings do not receive it.5–7 That situation is due in large
part to two problems: limited knowledge by physicians
and the general public about the nature and benefits of

cognitive-behavioral therapies, and the lack of an effec-
tive means for disseminating new treatments, resulting
in  reduced  treatment  availability.8  The  present  article
provides  an  overview  of  one  of  the  most  well-studied
forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic disorder,
Panic Control Treatment (PCT),9,10 and reviews the evi-
dence for its efficacy. Also reviewed is some recent work
directed  at  extending  the  application  of  PCT  to  new
populations  and  enhancing  its  long-term  efficacy  and
cost-effectiveness.

DESCRIPTION OF TREATMENT

The general goal of PCT is to foster within patients the
ability to identify and correct maladaptive thoughts and
behaviors that initiate, sustain, or exacerbate anxiety and
panic attacks. In service of that goal, the treatment com-
bines education, cognitive interventions, relaxation and
controlled  breathing  procedures,  and  exposure  tech-
niques. It is usually delivered in 11 or 12 weekly sessions,
either individually to patients or in a small group format.
The PCT protocol includes a variety of information
and  skill-building  components.10  In  early  sessions, pa-
tients are taught about the nature and function of fear
and its nervous system substrates. The fear response is
presented as a normal and generally protective state that
enhances our ability to survive and compete in life. Panic
attacks are conceptualized as inappropriate fear reactions
arising from spurious but otherwise normal activation of
the body’s fight-or-flight nervous system. Like other fear
reactions, they are portrayed as alarms that stimulate us
to take immediate defensive action. Because we normally
associate  fight-or-flight  responses  with  the  presence  of
danger, panic attacks typically motivate a frantic search
for the source of threat. When none is found, affected
individuals may look inward and interpret the symptoms
as signs that something is seriously wrong with them (e.g.,
“I’m dying of a heart attack,” “I’m losing my mind”).

In addition to normalizing and demystifying panic
attacks, the educational component of PCT provides pa-
tients with a model of anxiety that emphasizes the inter-
action between the mind and body and provides a ra-
tionale and framework for the skills to be taught during
treatment. A three-component model is used, in which
the dimensions of anxiety are grouped into physical, cog-
nitive, and behavioral categories. The physical compo-
nent includes bodily changes (e.g., neurological, hormo-
nal,  cardiovascular)  and  their  associated  somatic
sensations (e.g., shortness of breath, palpitations, light-

headedness).  The  cognitive  component  consists  of the
rational  and  irrational  thoughts,  images,  and  impulses
that accompany anxiety or fear (e.g., thoughts of dying,
images of losing control, impulses to run). The behavioral
component contains the things people do when they are
anxious or afraid (e.g., pacing, leaving or avoiding a situ-
ation,  carrying  a  safety  object).  Most  important,  these
three components are described as interacting with each
other, often with the result that anxiety is heightened.

Having laid this foundation, PCT then teaches pa-
tients skills for controlling each of the three components
of anxiety. To manage some of the physical aspects of
anxiety, such as sensations due to hyperventilation (e.g.,
lightheadedness and tingling sensations) or muscle ten-
sion  (e.g.,  trembling  and  dyspnea),  patients  are taught
slow, diaphragmatic breathing or progressive muscle re-
laxation. To reduce anxiety-exacerbating thoughts and
images, patients are taught to critically examine, on the
basis of past experience and logical reasoning, their es-
timations of the likelihood that a feared event will occur,
the probable consequences if it should occur, and their
ability  to cope  with it. In addition, they are helped to
design and conduct behavioral experiments to test their
predictions.

To change maladaptive anxiety and fear behaviors,
patients are taught to engage in graded therapeutic ex-
posure to cues they associate with panic attacks. The ex-
posure component of standard PCT (called interoceptive
exposure) focuses primarily on internal cues(cid:190)
specifical-
ly, frightening bodily sensations. During exposure, pa-
tients  deliberately  provoke  physical  sensations  like
smothering, dizziness, or tachycardia by means of exer-
cises such as breathing through a straw, spinning, or vig-
orous exercise. These exercises are done initially during
treatment  sessions,  with  therapist  modeling,  and  sub-
sequently by patients at home. As patients become less
afraid of the sensations, more naturalistic activities are
assigned, such as drinking caffeinated beverages, having
sexual intercourse, or watching scary movies.

Exposure to external cues (traditional situational ex-
posure) is not systematically addressed in standard PCT,
although as patients begin to apply the techniques they
have learned, they are encouraged to gradually reenter
situations they have been avoiding. The developers did
not include a more systematic situational exposure com-
ponent in PCT because they wanted to focus initially on
the experience of panic attacks, rather than on avoidance
behavior, since this had not been done previously. An
optional agoraphobia supplement was developed later,

for  use  with  patients  who  have  significant  situational
avoidance.11

EFFICACY OF PCT

The practice guidelines published by the American Psy-
chiatric  Association  concluded  that  pharmacotherapy
and cognitive-behavioral therapy are the first-line treat-
ments for panic disorder.4 Moreover, PCT is classified
as a “well-established” intervention for panic disorder by
the Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psy-
chological Procedures of the American Psychological As-
sociation, Division of Clinical Psychology.12 For a treat-
ment to be classified as “well-established,” the following
criteria had to be met: first, the efficacy of the interven-
tion had to be demonstrated in at least two clinical trials
conducted by different investigators or in a large series
of well-designed single case studies; second, treatment
had to be delivered in accordance with a manual; third,
the characteristics of the subject sample had to be clearly
delineated; and fourth, the treatment had to be either as
efficacious as an already established treatment or supe-
rior to a placebo or other treatment.

The efficacy of PCT for the treatment of panic dis-
order with limited agoraphobia has been demonstrated
in numerous clinical trials. In an early study, PCT was
found to be superior to a waitlist condition and a relaxa-
tion  condition.9  In  an intent-to-treat  analysis,  approxi-
mately 80% of patients assigned to PCT were panic free
at  posttreatment,  compared  with  40%  of  patients  as-
signed to applied relaxation and 30% of waitlist patients.
Similar  results  were  reported  by  Klosko  and  col-
leagues,13,14 who demonstrated that PCT was superior to
either the waitlist or drug placebo as well as alprazolam
in the treatment for panic disorder. The authors found
that 87% of patients in the PCT group were panic free
by the end of treatment, compared with 50% in the al-
prazolam condition, 36% in the placebo group, and 33%
in the waitlist group. A 2-year follow-up of PCT com-
pleters  found  that  gains  were  maintained.15,16  Sub-
sequently, Telch et al.17 found that a treatment similar to
PCT  was  effective  when  administered  in  an  8-week
group  therapy  format.  At  posttreatment,  85%  of  PCT-
treated patients were panic free, versus 30% in a waitlist
condition. When a more stringent outcome criterion was
used,  including  measures  of  panic  frequency,  general
anxiety,  and  agoraphobic  avoidance,  63%  of  PCT-
treated  patients  and  only  9%  of  waitlist  subjects  were
classified as improved.

Most recently, M. Katherine Shear at the University
of Pittsburgh, Jack M. Gorman at Columbia University,
Scott Woods at Yale University, and David H. Barlow at
our center at Boston University compared PCT to imip-
ramine, a pill placebo, and combinations of PCT with
imipramine or a pill placebo. The results from that study
suggest  that  PCT  was  comparable  to  imipramine  on
nearly all measures during treatment, with better main-
tenance of gains after treatment discontinuation.18 Fur-
thermore, the results showed that more than one-third
of all eligible patients refused participation in the study
because  they  were  unwilling  to  take  imipramine.19  In
contrast, only 1 out of 308 potential participants refused
the study because of the possibility of receiving psycho-
therapy.19

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS OF PCT

PCT consists of a combination of cognitive and behav-
ioral treatment components, including education, cogni-
tive restructuring, breathing retraining or relaxation, and
interoceptive  exposure.  It  is  not  known  at  present
whether all of those components contribute uniquely to
the efficacy of the treatment. Good outcomes have been
reported for related  treatments that differ in their em-
phasis on the components of PCT.20–22

Direct  comparisons  of  the  various  components  of
PCT are lacking, but some case studies23 and the afore-
mentioned  meta-analysis  of  panic  disorder  treatment
studies2 provide some indirect data relating to active in-
gredients. Among the psychosocial treatments studied,
therapies incorporating both cognitive restructuring and
interoceptive exposure had the highest overall mean ef-
fect size (ES = 0.88, 7 studies). Only three studies evalu-
ated cognitive interventions alone as treatment, and the
results were varied, with effect sizes ranging from –0.95
to 1.10 (mean ES = 0.18). However, other studies suggest
that a combination of interoceptive exposure and cogni-
tive restructuring is not significantly more effective than
either treatment alone.21,24 Until further information is
available, the relative importance of the elements of PCT
remains unclear.

LIMITATIONS OF
EXISTING TREATMENT STUDIES

Although no other type of psychosocial intervention has
been shown to be more effective for panic disorder than
PCT,  several  limitations  of  existing  studies necessitate

J Psychother Pract Res, 8:1, Winter 1999

care in interpreting published efficacy data.

First, as noted earlier, most studies of PCT have en-
rolled panic disorder patients with little or no agorapho-
bia. The efficacy of PCT for patients with greater degrees
of  agoraphobia  is  largely  unknown,  but  it  is  probably
lower than for less avoidant patients.

Second, even in samples with little or no agorapho-
bia, panic-free rates generally are higher than response
rates based on more global measures of improvement.
For example, in the Telch et al. study,17 although 85% of
patients were panic free at posttreatment, only 63% met
a more stringent response criterion including measures
of  general  anxiety  and  agoraphobic  avoidance.  Simi-
larly, a study of subjects treated with variations of PCT
at our center found that 68% were panic free 3 months
posttreatment, but only 40% met broader criteria for high
endstate functioning.25

Third,  the  efficacy  data  from  nearly  all  treatment
studies to date have been based on cross-sectional assess-
ments. Although such assessments show good mainte-
nance of gains on average following cognitive-behavioral
therapy, longitudinal data reveal that many patients have
a fluctuating posttreatment course, with periods of symp-
tom recrudescence. For example, in the Brown and Bar-
low study,25 40% of subjects met criteria for high endstate
functioning  at  3  months  posttreatment  and  57%  at  24
months posttreatment, but only 27% met the criteria at
both 3 and 24 months. These findings indicate that there
still is room for improvement in PCT and similar cogni-
tive-behavioral interventions for panic disorder.

Fourth, it is uncertain how PCT compares with some
of  the  more  recently  investigated  pharmacotherapies,
such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Most of
the  comparative  treatment outcome studies have used
“older” medications, such as imipramine, thus limiting
the generalizability of the results.

Panic Control Treatment and Its Applications

Combining PCT With
Situational Exposure

When PCT initially was developed, the necessary
and sufficient criterion for the diagnosis of panic disorder
was the presence of a minimum number of panic attacks
within a specified period of time. Psychosocial treatments
at the time (e.g., relaxation therapies and situational ex-
posure) tended to focus on general arousal and tension
or situational avoidance. PCT differed in that it specifi-
cally targeted patients’ experiences of panic attacks and
anticipatory anxiety. Consistent with that focus, trials of
PCT were conducted among patients for whom panic
attacks were the principal problem(cid:190)
that is, patients hav-
ing limited agoraphobic avoidance. As discussed earlier,
the treatment was very effective in eliminating attacks in
that group. However, other measures indicated that de-
spite being panic free, some patients continued to evi-
dence functional impairment, largely owing to residual
agoraphobic  avoidance.  Presumably  that  would  have
been even more the case if patients having more marked
agoraphobia were included.

To address that problem, clinicians often combine
PCT  with  in  vivo  situational  exposure  assignments,11
which  require  patients to systematically enter  anxiety-
provoking  situations  and  stay  there  until  their  anxiety
subsides.  Although  such  combinations  have  not  been
well studied, clinical experience and what empirical evi-
dence there is suggest that this approach is effective. For
example,  several  investigators  have  reported  good  re-
sults with combinations of exposure therapy and cogni-
tive interventions like those used in PCT.26–32 Recently,
we have  been experimenting with the combination of
PCT and brief (2 or 3 days) massed exposure for treating
panic disorder patients with moderate to severe agora-
phobia. Preliminary results are encouraging.33

MODIFICATIONS TO PCT

Including Significant Others
in Treatment

In recent years, clinicians and researchers have begun to
experiment with variations of PCT. Some modifications,
such  as  combining  PCT  with  situational  exposure,  in-
cluding significant others in treatment, or adding a re-
lapse prevention component, are intended to extend the
applicability of the treatment or improve its long-term
outcome. Others, such as administering PCT in abbre-
viated or self-help formats, are intended to improve the
cost-effectiveness of treatment or make it more accessible
to patients.

As  a  result  of  early  clinical  observations  that  the
interpersonal systems of individuals with panic disorder
and agoraphobia may be disrupted by treatment inter-
ventions,34 some researchers have tried including signifi-
cant others in treatment. Although the original observa-
tions  have  not  been  supported  consistently,35  data  do
suggest that inclusion of family members in treatment
may enhance the efficacy of PCT and related psycho-
social  treatments,  particularly  exposure  therapy.  For

6

Hofmann and Spiegel

example, Barlow and colleagues36,37 found that including
significant others in exposure therapy significantly im-
proved the outcome at posttreatment and at both 12- and
24-month  follow-ups.  Additionally,  the  inclusion  of
spouses in treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia
(including PCT) has been associated with improvement
in  marital  satisfaction.37–40  Advantages  also  have  been
found for the involvement of mothers in the treatment
of adolescents with agoraphobia.41

Adding Relapse Prevention Strategies

To further improve the long-term outcome of PCT,
we currently are experimenting with the inclusion of a
relapse prevention component, the goal of which is to
teach patients to anticipate and respond constructively
to setbacks that might occur after treatment has ended.
Interventions like these have been shown to be helpful
in various psychiatric disorders.42–44 Other strategies also
may be useful. For example, in a recent case at our center,
the use of psychophysiological recording was helpful in
treating relapse after PCT.45

Abbreviated and Self-Help Formats

A burgeoning area of interest has been the use of
abbreviated or self-help treatments for anxiety disorders,
and evidence is accumulating that such approaches are
viable for panic disorder. For example, Craske et al.46
found a 4-session PCT protocol more effective than an
equivalent amount of nondirective supportive therapy.
Furthermore, Côté et al. found that 10 hours of in-person
and  telephone  therapy  was  as effective as 20 hours of
standard  face-to-face  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  ad-
ministered over the same time period.47 The two groups
combined  (total  N = 21)  had  a  90%  panic-free  rate  at
follow-up.  However,  the  study  is  limited  by  the  small
number of subjects, which might have contributed to the
lack of significant findings.

Promising results also have been reported with self-
help treatments involving minimal therapist contact (e.g.,
3  hours).48–50  Hecker  et  al.,49  for  example,  found  that
self-directed  PCT  was  not  significantly  different  from
therapist-directed PCT. The authors provided panic dis-
order patients (N = 16) with the first edition of the PCT
workbook  Mastery  of  Your  Anxiety  and  Panic51  and  ran-
domly  assigned  participants  to  either  a  self-directed
group or a therapist-directed group. Individuals in the
therapist-directed group met with the therapist weekly

for 12 weeks to work through the materials. Participants
in  the  self-directed  group  met  with  the  therapist  only
three times over 12 weeks to assign readings and answer
questions. Statistical tests revealed no difference between
the  two  groups.  Participants  in  both  groups  improved
with  treatment  and  maintained  their  gains  at  6-month
follow-up. However, the lack of significant findings might
have been a result of the weak statistical power due to
the small number of subjects. Unfortunately, the authors
did not report the necessary information to calculate ef-
fect sizes.

On the other hand, there is also some evidence to
suggest that individuals having severe levels of interfer-
ence and symptomatology may require more therapist
involvement. For example, in a study of panic disorder
patients with severe agoraphobia, therapist-administered
treatment  was  substantially  more  effective  than  a  self-
help manual.52

Further enhancement of the cost-effectiveness and
dissemination of PCT may be possible through the in-
corporation of new technologies into treatment. As early
as 1987, Ghosh and Marks53 demonstrated that exposure
therapy administered by means of a computer program
was as effective as therapist-administered exposure for
the treatment of agoraphobia. Recently, Newman et al.54
used a palmtop computer to administer a portion of the
PCT. Preliminary data suggest that this method can lead
to a significant reduction in the need for therapist contact.
For a review of the current status of computer-aided treat-
ments for mental health problems, see Marks et al.55

Overall,  then,  in  cases  that  do  not  involve  severe
disability, there are effective alternatives to standard out-
patient treatment by a therapist. Moreover, many em-
pirically  validated  treatments  have  been  published  in
manualized  form,  so  that  individuals  can  follow  them
either on their own or in conjunction with a therapist.10
Increased focus on services research will allow practitio-
ners to determine the efficacy of this treatment format.

USE OF PCT IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS

Most studies of PCT have involved patients with a prin-
cipal diagnosis of panic disorder (with limited agorapho-
bia) who were either unmedicated or on a stable dose of
medication. However, researchers have begun to inves-
tigate its efficacy in other populations. Two examples are
panic disorder patients being discontinued from benzo-
diazepine therapy and patients with schizophrenia and
panic attacks.

Patients Being Discontinued From
Benzodiazepine Therapy

The efficacy of benzodiazepine medications in the
treatment  of  panic  disorder  has  been  well  estab-
lished,56,57  and  two  of  these  medications(cid:190)
alprazolam
and clonazepam(cid:190)
are approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of panic disorder. Un-
fortunately, a drawback of these treatments is that a sub-
stantial proportion of patients relapse when drug discon-
tinuation  is  attempted.58,59  Recently,  several  small
studies have found that the administration of PCT con-
currently with drug taper and discontinuation markedly
improved the ability of panic disorder patients to stop
and remain abstinent from benzodiazepine use.

For  example,  Spiegel  et  al.60  assigned  patients
treated  with  alprazolam  to  either  supportive  medical
management  (SMM)  with  slow,  flexible  drug taper or
the same taper procedure done concurrently with PCT.
The taper procedure was highly effective in that 80% of
subjects in the SMM group and 90% in the PCT group
were  able  to  stop alprazolam  use  for at least  2  weeks.
However, by 6-month follow-up, half of the patients in
the SMM group had relapsed, versus none in the PCT
group. In a similar study, Otto et al.61 discontinued panic
disorder patients from alprazolam or clonazepam either
with  or  without  concurrent  PCT,  using  a  somewhat
faster, fixed taper procedure. Seventy-six percent of the
patients who received PCT, versus 25% of those who did
not, were able to discontinue drug use, and at 3-month
follow-up, 77% of those in the PCT group who had dis-
continued the drug were still benzodiazepine free. We
currently are participating in a larger, two-site study to
confirm and extend those findings.

PCT as a Treatment for Panic Attacks in
Patients With Schizophrenia

Patients  with  schizophrenia  often  report  recurrent
episodes of panic attacks.62,63 Most treatment studies of
panic disorder and panic attacks in patients with schizo-
phrenia  have  used benzodiazepines64 or imipramine65
as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication. In addition to
the usual side effect and risk profile of benzodiazepines
(sedation,  cognitive  impairment,  and  abuse  potential),
there is also some evidence of increased risk of behav-
ioral  and social disinhibition in schizophrenic patients
taking some anti-anxiety medications.

For  panic  attacks  associated  with  schizophrenia,  a

Panic Control Treatment and Its Applications

recent preliminary study suggests that PCT may be an
effective alternative to pharmacotherapy.66 In that study,
11 consecutively admitted patients who met DSM-III-R
criteria for schizophrenia and panic disorder participated
in  a  16-week  open  trial  of  group  cognitive-behavioral
therapy for panic disorder. Eight patients completed the
treatment, with the majority of those showing significant
reductions  in  both  the  frequency  of  panic  attacks  and
functional interference due to panic attacks. Encouraged
by those results, our group is currently conducting a con-
trolled trial that is funded by the National Alliance for
Research on Schizophrenia and Depression to evaluate
the efficacy of PCT as a treatment to reduce panic attacks
in patients with schizophrenia.

Combination of PCT With
Pharmacotherapy

In their introduction to the report of the 1992 Con-
sensus  Development  Conference  on  the  Treatment  of
Panic Disorder, Wolfe and Maser67 noted that the modal
clinical treatment for panic disorder at that time was a
combination  of  medication  and  psychosocial  therapy.
More recently, Uhlenhuth68 reported that the consensus
among world experts on pharmacotherapy for panic dis-
order still highly favors a combined treatment approach.
These findings reflect the widely held belief that com-
bined treatment regimens are superior to treatments ad-
ministered alone, but there is very little empirical evidence
to support that impression.69 Considering the added cost
of combined therapy, it would seem important to demon-
strate a sufficient benefit to warrant the expense.

A recent review of published studies combining ben-
zodiazepines and cognitive-behavioral therapy for panic
disorder found little evidence that the combination was
superior to cognitive-behavioral therapy alone for most
patients.64 In fact, some studies have found poorer long-
term outcomes for PCT when it has been administered
in  combination  with  benzodiazepines.25,60  Those  find-
ings are consistent with results from animal laboratories
indicating that benzodiazepines may interfere with the
types of learning that are most important for psychosocial
treatment interventions.35,70 This potentially detrimental
effect  of  benzodiazepines  on  the  outcome  of  PCT  ap-
pears to be minimized if the drugs are discontinued prior
to the conclusion of PCT. Therefore, if benzodiazepines
are to be prescribed in conjunction with PCT (e.g., when
urgent  relief  of  impairment  due  to  panic  symptoms  is
needed), it should be done as a temporary measure with

8

J Psychother Pract Res, 8:1, Winter 1999

Hofmann and Spiegel

the  understanding that the medication will be tapered
during the psychosocial treatment.

The situation is less clear with regard to the combi-
nation of antidepressant medications and cognitive-be-
havioral therapy. Studies have fairly consistently found
a benefit to combining an antidepressant with in vivo si-
tuational exposure therapy for patients with panic disor-
der and agoraphobia.26,71–73 However, there is little in-
formation regarding the combination of antidepressants
with more cognitively focused therapies for patients with
little or no agoraphobia. In the multicenter comparative
treatment study of panic disorder referred to earlier,18
the combination of PCT plus imipramine was compared
to PCT, imipramine, and a pill placebo, each adminis-
tered alone, and to the combination of PCT and a pill
placebo. Preliminary reports indicate that the combined
treatment may be modestly better than either PCT or
imipramine alone on some measures (although not over-
all response) during both acute and maintenance treat-
ment but loses its advantage over PCT when the medi-
cation is discontinued.18 It would appear, on the basis of
these data, that the routine administration of an antide-
pressant with PCT is not warranted; however, whether
there  are  some  patients  for  whom  such  an  approach
would be indicated is presently unknown.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Panic Control Treatment is a brief, structured, cognitive-
behavioral therapy developed initially for the treatment
of panic disorder with limited agoraphobia. The efficacy
of PCT in its intended population has been well estab-
lished,  and  when  PCT  is  combined  with  a  situational
exposure module, its applicability may be extended to
more agoraphobic patients. Follow-up assessments out

to at least 2 years posttreatment show that patients as a
group maintain their improvement, although individuals
may experience some symptom fluctuation. The inclu-
sion of a relapse prevention component may be helpful
for those cases. In addition, there is some evidence that
including a significant other in treatment may improve
compliance with homework assignments and reduce in-
terpersonal  conflict  associated  with  panic  disorder.
Among  its  more  novel  applications,  PCT  has  shown
promise in helping panic disorder patients to discontinue
high-potency benzodiazepines and as an alternative to
pharmacotherapy for treating panic attacks in patients
with schizophrenia.

Given  the  cost-effectiveness  and  clinical  value  of
PCT and related therapies for panic disorder, it is im-
perative that efforts be made to make these treatments
more widely accessible to patients. National probability
samples indicate that only three out of four individuals
with panic disorder seek treatment for their condition.74
Worse still, surveys consistently have shown that only a
small number of those who do seek care receive empiri-
cally supported psychosocial treatments.5–7  As Barlow
and Hofmann8 have noted, this latter situation is due at
least in part to a lack of availability, especially in primary
care settings, of therapists who have been trained in these
interventions. A misguided belief that pharmacotherapy
is less expensive than PCT may also be a factor.

To facilitate its dissemination, PCT has been pub-
lished in manual and workbook formats.10,11,75 In addi-
tion, there have been encouraging trials of self-help and
computer-assisted versions, which may be useful when

under way.
