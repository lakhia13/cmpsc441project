ABSTRACT

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms (OCS) are known to be highly comorbid 
with  bipolar  disorder  and  schizophrenia.  Comorbid  OCD/OCS  influences  the  course  of  schizophrenia  and  bipolar 
disorder. There is also some evidence to suggest that a diagnosis of OCD may be associated with elevated risk for later 
development of psychosis and bipolar disorder. Comorbid OCD/OCS is associated with a greater severity of schizophrenia 
phenotype and poorer prognosis. In addition, certain atypical antipsychotics, clozapine in particular are known to induce 
or  worsen  OCS  in  schizophrenia.  OCD  when  comorbid  with  bipolar  disorder  mostly  runs  an  episodic  course  with 
worsening and improvement of OCD/OCS in depressive and in manic/hypomanic phases respectively. There is limited 
systematic data on the treatment of OCD in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. When OCD presents in the context of 
schizophrenia, management may include treatment with atypical antipsychotics with limited serotonergic properties, 
changing the antipsychotic, reduction in the dose of the antipsychotic, addition of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), or 
a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). When OCD is comorbid with bipolar disorder, mood stabilization is the 
priority. CBT may be preferred over SSRIs to treat OCD/OCS that persist in between the mood episodes because SSRIs 
may induce a switch or worsen the course of bipolar disorder. SSRIs when indicated have to be used judiciously under 
the cover of adequate mood stabilization.

INTRODUCTION

Obsessive–compulsive  disorder  (OCD),  anxiety  disorders, 
and depression are known to be highly comorbid with each 
other,[1] but the comorbidity of OCD with schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder (BD) is understudied. Treatment of OCD in 
the context of schizophrenia and BD is highly challenging.

OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SYMPTOMS 
IN SUBJECTS AT HIGH-RISK FOR 
SCHIZOPHRENIA

Obsessive–compulsive  symptoms 
(OCS)  are  frequently 
observed  during  the  course  of  schizophrenia.  OCS/OCD 
can  manifest  in  those  at  ultra-high  risk  for  psychosis, 
during  prodromal  psychotic  state,  in  the  first  episode  of 
schizophrenia, during the course of chronic schizophrenia 
and  after  treatment  with  atypical  antipsychotics.[2]  The 
occurrence  of  OCS  can  range  anywhere  between  5%  and 
30%.[3]  Although  OCS  are  also  common  in  the  general 
population and in those with other psychiatric disorders,[4,5]  
those at ultra-high risk for psychosis appear to have a higher 
frequency of OCS than the general population.

OCS are more likely to be present among males, in those 
with  insidious  onset  and  long  duration  of  attenuated 
psychosis, more negative symptoms,[6] and in the presence 
of  depression[3]  and  suicidality,[7]  although  their  presence 
and severity may not predict transition to frank psychosis.[8] 
Individuals  with  OCS  and  at  ultra-high  risk  for  psychosis 
had poorer psychosocial functioning than those without[9,10] 
but  interestingly  were  found  to  perform  better  on  tests 
of  neurocognitive  functioning  when  compared  to  those 
without.[7]

The  common  symptoms  in  those  at  risk  for  psychosis 
are  aggressive  obsessions,  checking  compulsions,  and 
hoarding.[3,11] One study also found duration of subthreshold 
psychosis to be longer in those with OCS (15.6 months vs. 
6.2 months)[11] with the highest frequency of OCS in those 
with a family history of psychosis.[11]

Because  of  these  distinct  differences, 
it  has  been 
hypothesized that individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis 
with OCS may constitute a separate phenotype.

OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE DISORDER IN THE 
CONTEXT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA

Prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder in 
schizophrenia
Some  of  the  founders  of  modern  psychiatry  (Westphal, 
in 
clearly 
Mayer-Gross,  Bleuler) 
schizophrenia  and  deemed  them  a  feature  of  the 
disorder’s prodromal or active phases, but initially, they 
were  thought  to  occur  in  a  minority  of  schizophrenia 
patients  only  (1%–3.5%)  and  were  considered  to  be  a 

identified  OCS 

protective factor.[12] However, in one of the early reports, 
Fenton  and  McGlashan  reported  a  high  prevalence 
of  OCS  in  schizophrenia  patients  (12.9%),  along  with 
a  poorer  outcome  for  those  with  OCS.[13]  The  term 
“schizo-obsessive  disorder”  was  suggested  in  order  to 
draw  attention  to  those  schizophrenia  patients  with 
clinically  significant  OCS.[14]  Recent  meta-analyses  have 
shown  that  up  to  30%  of  patients  with  schizophrenia 
report  OCS[15]  and  12%–14%  of  them  meet  diagnostic 
criteria for OCD.[1,15] A study from our center reported OCS 
in  24%  of  200  hospitalized  patients  with  schizophrenia, 
of which 19% had the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) OCD. [16]

OCS in schizophrenia are not merely a result of chronic illness 
or due to antipsychotic treatment, since a high prevalence 
rate  (OCS,  from  2.7%  to  37%;  OCD,  from  1.5%  to  30%) 
reported  in  individuals  at  ultra-high  risk  for  psychosis,  in 
the prodromal phase of schizophrenia, and in first-episode 
drug-naive  schizophrenia  patients  is  considerably  higher 
than in the general population.[9] In a study from our center, 
65% had developed OCS before antipsychotic use.[16]

Obsessive–compulsive disorder as a risk factor for 
schizophrenia
It  is  unclear  if  a  diagnosis  of  OCD  confers  a  risk  for  later 
development  of  psychosis,  but  there  is  some  evidence  to 
suggest  that  OCS  may  enhance  the  risk  of  psychosis.[17-19] 
In  a  study  based  on  Danish  registers,  prior  diagnosis  of 
OCD  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  developing 
schizophrenia  (incidence  rate  ratio  [IRR]  =  6.90;  95% 
confidence  interval  [CI],  6.25–7.60)  and  schizophrenia 
spectrum  disorders  (IRR  =  5.77;  95%  CI,  5.33–6.22)  later 
in  life.[18]  Similarly,  children  of  parents  with  OCD  had  an 
increased risk of schizophrenia (IRR = 4.31; 95% CI, 2.72–6.43) 
and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (IRR = 3.10; 95% CI, 
2.17–4.27). The results were significant even after adjusting 
for family history of psychiatric disorders and the patient’s 
psychiatric history.[18]

registry-based 

A  Swedish 
longitudinal  cohort  and 
multi-generational  family  study  found  that  patients  with 
OCD  had  a  12–13  times  higher  risk  of  having  a  comorbid 
diagnosis of schizophrenia, BD, and schizoaffective disorder 
compared  with  individuals  without  OCD.[19]  Longitudinal 
analyses  showed  that  individuals  first  diagnosed  with 
OCD had a 3-fold higher risk of receiving a later diagnosis 
of  schizophrenia  compared  with  individuals  without  OCD 
during the follow-up period. Similarly, when rates of OCD 
in primary psychotic disorders were studied, patients first 
diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder 
had a 7 and a 5 times higher risk of receiving a later diagnosis 
of  OCD,  respectively,  compared  with  individuals  without 
schizophrenia.  The  risk  of  later  development  of  OCD  was 
only marginally reduced when the use of second-generation 
antipsychotics (SGAs) was corrected for.[19]

Sharma and Reddy: OCD in schizophrenia and bipolar disorderClinical characteristics, onset and course
Schizophrenia and OCD are characterized by similar gender 
distribution, age of onset, and earlier age of onset in men. 
OCS  may  present  across  the  life  span  in  adolescent,  adult, 
and  elderly  patients  with  schizophrenia.[20,21]  Studies  have 
shown that in a majority of patients with comorbid OCD and 
schizophrenia,  OCS  precede  initial  psychotic  symptoms  in 
about  40%  of  patients,  may  succeed  psychosis  in  40%,  and 
occur  concurrently  with  psychotic  symptoms  in  around 
20%.[16]  In  a  5-year  follow-up  of  172  patients  admitted  with 
first-episode schizophrenia and related disorders, 49% had no 
OCS anytime during the course, 15% had OCS only during the 
first assessment, 13% had persistent OCS, 7% developed OCS 
subsequently, and 16% had intermittent OCS, suggesting that 
the course of OCS is variable.[10] The presence of comorbid 
OCD was associated with more severe depression, impaired 
social functioning, and worse premorbid functioning.[10]

The  phenomenology  of  OCS  in  schizo-obsessive  disorder 
is  similar  to  that  in  primary  OCD  patients  and  is  typically 
moderate to severe.[22-25] One study reported good insight 
into OCS in 85% of the patients, a rate comparable to that 
in primary OCD,[26] but in an Indian study, less than a half 
had  good  insight  (46%).[16]  Effect  of  OCS  on  the  clinical 
phenotype  of  schizophrenia 
is  unclear.  Findings  are 
conflicting, but most studies report an earlier age at onset 
of  psychosis,  longer  duration  of  illness,  greater  positive 
and  negative  symptoms,  more  depressive  symptoms  and 
suicide attempts, increased rates of hospitalization, poorer 
neurocognitive  performance,  decreased 
likelihood  of 
being  employed  or  married,  lower  quality  of  life,  greater 
disability, and overall poorer prognosis.[27-29] However, two 
cross-sectional studies from our center have reported lesser 
positive  symptoms,  lower  score  on  anergia  and  higher 
score  on  depression,  higher  comorbidity  with  Axis  II  and 
anxiety  disorders,  somewhat  lesser  disability,  better  QOL, 
and  greater  family  loading  for  OCD.[16,25]  In  one  study, 
patients  with  schizo-obsessive  disorder  tend  to  have  a 
different  pattern  of  comorbidity  from  schizophrenia,  with 
a  preferential  aggregation  of  body  dysmorphic  disorder, 
eating  disorders,  and  tic  disorders  but  not  of  major 
depressive, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders.[30]

Family history
Both  OCD  and  schizophrenia  show  familial  aggregation. 
Relatives  of  patients  with  schizo-obsessive  disorder  and 
schizophrenia,  both  have  a  higher  risk  of  schizophrenia 
spectrum  disorders  (9.4%,  7.5%)  than  community-based 
controls  (0.75%),  comparable  to  the  average  risk  for 
schizophrenia  in  first-degree  relatives  in  family  studies  of 
schizophrenia (6%–9%).[31]

When compared with first degree relatives of schizophrenia 
probands,  relatives  of  schizo-obsessive  probands  had 
a  significantly  higher  morbid  risk  for  schizo-obsessive 
disorder,  obsessive–compulsive  personality  disorder, 

and  (at  a  trend  level)  an  increased  rate  of  OCD,  with  no 
between-group  differences  in  the  rate  of  schizophrenia 
spectrum disorders.[32] In an Indian study of 200 participants 
with schizophrenia, those with OCS/OCD had a significantly 
greater family loading for OCD than those without.[16] Cederlöf 
et  al.,  in  their  Swedish  National  Registry  Study  (2014), 
reported that first-degree relatives of probands with OCD 
had a significantly increased risk for schizophrenia (relative 
risk [RR]: 1.9), schizoaffective (RR: 1.5), and BD (RR: 1.7).[19]

Biological markers
The neurobiological underpinnings of OCS in schizophrenia 
patients are not definitively known, but preliminary reports 
suggest a distinct neuroanatomical profile. Imaging studies 
have  identified  significantly  reduced  volumes  of  the  left 
hippocampus, frontal lobes, and anterior horn of the lateral 
and  third  ventricles  in  a  small  group  of  schizo-obsessive 
patients compared with schizophrenia patients.[33] Patients 
with schizo-obsessive disorder in the prodromal phase had a 
greater ventricle-brain ratio than patients with pure OCD.[34] 
A  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  study  found  a 
significant  negative  correlation  between  the  severity  of 
OCS  and  activation  of  the  left  dorso-lateral  prefrontal 
cortex (DLPFC), similar to the pattern seen in schizophrenia 
patients.[35]

A  neurophysiological  study  using  event-related  potentials 
(ERPs) during a discriminative response task found a distinct 
ERP  pattern,  with  abnormally  increased  target  activation 
and  reduced  P300  amplitude  in  the  schizo-obsessive 
patients  compared  to  that  in  patients  with  schizophrenia 
and  OCD.[36]  Studies  that  have  examined  patterns  of  brain 
activation  during  cognitive  tasks  in  schizophrenia  and 
schizo-obsessive participants have elicited similar reduction 
in activation in the right DLPFC and right caudate, as well 
as  decreased  functional  connectivity  during  performance 
of  the  N-back  task  compared  to  healthy  controls;  these 
patterns seem to be unrelated to severity of symptoms.[37] 
Similarly, impaired language processing, tested by auditory 
verb  generation  tasks,  found  comparable  patterns  of 
lateralization  in  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus  and  diminished 
inter-hemispheric  functional  connectivity  in  schizophrenia 
and  schizo-obsessive  subgroups.[38]  There  is  preliminary 
in  orbitofrontal 
evidence 
cortex (OFC) activation may be significantly associated with 
the  severity  of  obsessions,  with  increased  OFC  activation 
during  performance  of  a  Go-No  Go  task  in  patients  with 
schizo-obsessive disorder.[39]

that  changes 

to  suggest 

Several  studies  report  greater  soft  neurological  signs  and 
neuropsychological  deficits  (abstraction  and  executive 
function)  in  schizophrenia  patients  with  OCS/OCD  than  in 
those without OCS/OCD and in those with primary OCD.[40] 
However, a meta-analysis found impairment only in abstract 
reasoning with no impairment in executive functions.[41] We 
examined  the  neuropsychological  profile  of  schizophrenia 

S142

Indian Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 61 (Supplement 1), January 2019

Sharma and Reddy: OCD in schizophrenia and bipolar disorderwith and without OCD with a comprehensive battery of tests 
of attention, executive functions, and memory but found no 
differences between the two groups.[42] It appears that there 
are  no  consistent  neuropsychological  impairments  typical 
of  schizo-obsessive  disorder;  however, 
larger  studies 
with  uniform  methodology  may  be  needed  to  further  our 
understanding of this area.

Is schizo‑obsessive disorder a subtype of schizophrenia?
Based  on  high  rates  of  OCS/OCD  in  schizophrenia, 
somewhat  unique  clinical  profile  (albeit  with  conflicting 
findings), poorer prognosis, and preliminary neuroimaging 
and  neuropsychological  data,  some  researchers  have 
proposed 
schizo-obsessive  disorder  as  a  distinct 
subtype  of  schizophrenia  that  needs  further  study.[43] 
Accordingly,  diagnostic  criteria  have  been  proposed  for 
schizo-obsessive disorder with emphasis on the presence 
of  typical  DSM  OCD  symptoms  for  a  substantial  portion 
of  the  total  duration  of  illness  that  are  either  time 
consuming, distressing, interfering, or causing significant 
impairment  of  functioning.[43]  If  OCS  are  related  to 
psychotic experiences, the presence of additional typical 
OCS  is  required  for  a  diagnosis.  In  addition,  OCS  should 
not be secondary to antipsychotic drugs, substance abuse, 
or an organic factor.

ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED OBSESSIVE–
COMPULSIVE SYMPTOMS

SGAs  such  as  clozapine,  risperidone,  and  olanzapine,  in 
particular,  are  implicated  in  the  de  novo  emergence  and 
exacerbation  of  OCS  in  patients  with  schizophrenia.[44] 
First-generation  antipsychotics  (FGAs)  are  not  generally 
implicated in the development of OCS, with the exception 
of  a  rare  case  report  of  OCS  induced  by  haloperidol.[45] 
Clozapine is most frequently associated with exacerbation 
of  or  de  novo  emergence  of  OCS  in  schizophrenia,[44,46,47] 
although  there  are  few  contrary  reports.[48,49]  A  review 
estimated  the  frequency  of  de  novo  emergence  of  and 
worsening of preexisting OCS to be 20%–28% and 10%–18%, 
respectively, in those treated with clozapine.[44]

OCS usually manifest within the first few weeks of initiation 
of treatment with a SGA,[50,51] whereas with clozapine, OCS 
emerge  gradually  over  the  first  12  months  or  so.[9]  There 
seems  to  be  some  relation  between  dose  of  risperidone 
and  emergence  of  OCS  with  lower  doses  being  effective 
in  augmenting  the  action  of  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitors  (SSRIs)  in  treating  OCD[52]  and  higher  doses 
causing emergence of OCS.[53]

Arguments supporting the induction of OCS by SGAs include 
increased prevalence of OCS after approval of SGAs, higher 
rates  of  OCS  in  those  with  chronic  schizophrenia  treated 
with SGAs especially with clozapine, marked differences in 
the rates of OCS between those treated with FGAs and SGAs, 

OCS manifesting for the first time after initiating treatment 
with SGAs, correlation of OCS severity with dose, duration 
and  serum  levels  of  clozapine,[54,55]  and  improvement  in 
OCS after reduction in the dose of clozapine or change of 
drug.[46,54-57]

Predominant  anti-serotonergic  profile 
(both  5-HT2A 
and  5-HT2C  receptor  antagonism)  of  certain  SGAs  such 
as  clozapine  and  risperidone  is  hypothesized  to  be 
responsible for inducing OCS.[39,58] Drugs with predominant 
such  as  amisulpride  and 
dopaminergic  blockade 
aripiprazole are not associated with induction of OCS. For 
clozapine,  anti-serotonergic  profile  combined  with  low 
anti-dopaminergic  potency  and  enhanced  glutamatergic 
transmission could explain OCS.[59] Chronic use of clozapine 
is  also  known  to  downregulate  hypersensitive  5-HT2C 
receptors. Polymorphisms of the SLC1A1, BDNF, DLGAP3, 
and GRIN2B and interactions between these genes may also 
confer susceptibility to clozapine-induced OCS.[60-62] Some 
authors  suggest  that  schizophrenia  patients  with  OCS 
might  have  genetic  vulnerabilities  to  both  schizophrenia 
and  OCD,  with  some  common  environmental  factors 
triggering the expression of both OCD and schizophrenia 
genes.[63]

MANAGEMENT OF OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE 
SYMPTOMS/OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE 
DISORDER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA

Although OCD is a common comorbidity in schizophrenia, 
there  is  limited  literature  on  its  treatment.  There  is 
some  evidence  that  monotherapy  with  SGAs  such  as 
olanzapine[53,64] and ziprasidone[65] may help in alleviation 
of  both  psychotic  and  OCS 
in 
schizophrenia.  Antipsychotics  such  as  amisulpride  and 
aripiprazole which have negligible serotonergic properties 
also  appear  to  be  somewhat  useful  in  treating  OCS  in 
schizophrenia.[46,66]

in  preexisting  OCS 

Because of the clinical similarity of OCS in schizophrenia 
and  in  primary  OCD,  attempts  have  been  made  to 
examine the efficacy of SSRIs and clomipramine. The APA 
guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  SSRIs  in  combination 
with  antipsychotics  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia 
with OCS/OCD.[67] SSRIs seem to be beneficial,[68] especially 
escitalopram  at  20  mg/day,[69]  but  not  in  all  cases. 
Addition  of  fluvoxamine[70]  and  clomipramine[71]  has  been 
associated  with  worsening  of  psychosis.  When  adding 
an  SSRI  or  clomipramine  to  an  antipsychotic  regimen, 
pharmacokinetic 
interactions,  particularly  between 
clozapine  and  certain  SSRIs,  need  to  be  kept  in  mind  to 
avoid  side  effects  such  as  seizures  and  sudden  elevation 
in clozapine levels.

There  are  limited  systematic  data  on  the  efficacy  of 
in  treating  OCS/
cognitive  behavioral  therapy 

(CBT)

Sharma and Reddy: OCD in schizophrenia and bipolar disorderOCD  in  schizophrenia.  Reviews  of  case  reports  and  case 
series  suggest  that  CBT  may  be  effective,  but  this  needs 
confirmation  in  well-designed  studies.[72]  The  APA  also 
recommends a trial of CBT in those with schizophrenia and 
OCD who do not respond to adding an SSRI or change of 
antipsychotic.[67]

Treatment of SGA-induced OCS/OCD involves reduction of 
antipsychotic  dose  (e.g.,  reduction  of  dose  of  clozapine  if 
feasible),  change  to  another  antipsychotic  with  minimal 
influence  on  serotonergic  systems  such  as  aripiprazole, 
amisulpride,  or  haloperidol,[55]  addition  of  aripiprazole,[73] 
and addition of SSRI[69] and CBT.[74]

OBSESSIVE–COMPULSIVE DISORDER WITH 
BIPOLAR DISORDER

OCD  and  BD  are  highly  comorbid  with  each  other.  It  is 
not  clear  whether  this  high  comorbidity  represents  the 
frequent  occurrence  of  two  independent  diseases  or 
whether it represents the occurrence of symptoms of one 
kind (e.g., OCD symptoms) in a different disease (i.e., BD). 
Mayer-Gross  and  colleagues  in  their  influential  textbook 
on  psychiatry  stated  the  following:  “Compulsive  symptoms 
are  quite  common  in  manic  depressive  psychoses,  especially  in 
depressions. From time to time one sees the rare cases of recurrent 
endogenous obsessional neuroses. These people who, in time of 
health,  show  no  noteworthy  obsessional  traits,  but  who  have 
phases  in  which  compulsive  symptoms  appear  out  of  the  blue 
and rapidly mount up to complete incapacitation. Nevertheless, 
these illnesses remit and relapse in very much the same way as 
cyclothymic illnesses, may show just as much regularity of timing, 
and  are  probably  to  be  included,  from  the  etiological  point  of 
view, in the manic-depressive disorders.”[75]

Prevalence
Three population-based studies conducted in Italy and the 
USA reported lifetime prevalence rates of comorbid OCD in 
BD patients ranging between 11.1% and 21%.[76] A systematic 
review and meta-analysis reported a pooled prevalence of 
OCD in 17% (95% CI, 12.7%–22.4%) of BD patients, which was 
comparable to the pooled prevalence of BD in 18% of OCD 
patients  (18.35%,  95%  CI,  13.2%–24.8%).[77]  The  prevalence 
of  OCD  was  greater  in  BD  children  and  adolescents  than 
in adults (24.2% vs. 13.5%) and in population-based studies 
rather  than  in  hospital-based  studies  (22.2%  vs.  13.2%). 
Pooled  prevalence  of  BD-I  and  BD-II  in  OCD  has  been 
reported  to  be  3.9%  (95%  CI,  2.4–6.4)  and  13.5%  (95%  CI, 
9.3–19.3),  respectively,  and  pooled  prevalence  of  OCD 
in  BD-I  to  be  21.7%  (95%  CI  4.8–60.3).[78]  A  study  from 
our  center  reported  the  presence  of  OCD  in  35%  of  80 
participants  with  remitted  BD.[79]  Another  recent  study 
from our center reported OCS and OCD in 4% and 8% of the 
396 hospitalized BD patients, respectively, suggesting that 
rates are probably higher in remitted than in symptomatic 
patients.[80] However, BD comorbidity in 171 patients with a 

primary diagnosis of OCD recruited from our specialty OCD 
clinic has been relatively low (4%),[81] when compared with 
the rates reported in systematic reviews.[77,82]

Obsessive–compulsive disorder as a risk factor for bipolar 
disorder
A  Swedish  multigenerational  registry  study  found  that,  in 
individuals  with  BD,  the  risk  of  a  later  diagnosis  of  OCD 
was  approximately  1.2  times  higher,  with  a  median  time 
between diagnoses of 1.1 years (IR = 2.0). The risks were 
generally  higher  among  inpatients  with  OCD.[19]  The  risk 
of receiving a diagnosis of BD after an initial diagnosis of 
OCD (RR 13.7) was much greater than the risk of receiving 
a diagnosis of OCD after an initial diagnosis of BD (RR: 1.2). 
The  association  between  antidepressant  use  and  switch 
to  mania  in  patients  with  BD  is  well  known.  The  risk  of 
receiving a diagnosis of BD after an initial diagnosis of OCD 
was  substantially  reduced,  but  not  eliminated,  when  the 
use of SSRIs (but not other antidepressants) was controlled 
for,  which  indicates  that  the  presence  of  OCD  may  be  an 
independent risk factor for the later development of BD.[19]

Clinical characteristics, onset and course
Studies  on  the  phenomenology  of  OCS  in  OCD-BD  have 
shown  inconsistent  results.  However,  the  presence  of  BD 
comorbidity  has  been  associated  with  greater  incidence 
of  obsessions  of  sexual,  religious,  aggressive,  symmetry, 
and  hoarding-related  themes  and  ordering/arranging  and 
hoarding  compulsions.[83]  Contamination  obsessions  and 
washing  compulsions  have  also  been  associated  with 
OCD-BD;[84]  however, 
the  converse  has  also  been 
reported.[85,86]  A  review  of  18  studies  found  no  conclusive 
evidence  that  BD-OCD  had  more  severe  OCS.[83]  However, 
insight  into  OCD  was  found  to  be  poorer  in  those  with 
comorbidity.[87,88]

OCD  is  more  likely  to  manifest  during  mixed  mania  and 
depressive  episodes.[89,90]  Patients  with  OCD-BD  tended 
to have a greater number of depressive episodes than BD 
alone.[91,92]

In the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study database, 
OCD-BD patients had statistically significant higher lifetime 
rates of death wishes and suicidal thoughts when compared 
with  non-OCD-BD  patients,[93]  which  was  confirmed  by 
subsequent  studies.[88,94,95]  OCD  also  was  associated  with 
a 2.4-fold increase in the odds of suicidal ideation among 
BD  adolescents.[96]  A  large  hospital-based  study  found 
that  BD-OCD  patients  were  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed 
with  substance  and  alcohol  use  disorders,  panic  disorder, 
agoraphobia,  posttraumatic  stress  disorder,  and  eating 
disorders than noncomorbid patients.[97] One report showed 
a  positive  association  between  BD-OCD  comorbidity  and 
sedatives,  nicotine,  alcohol,  and  coffee  use.[98]  The  ECA 
study confirmed the higher rate of drug abuse in OCD-BD 
participants  than  in  noncomorbid  participants  (37.1%  vs.

Sharma and Reddy: OCD in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder28.2%).[93]  Higher  rates  of  attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and oppositional defiant disorder and lower rates 
of  generalized  anxiety  disorder  have  been  reported  in 
BD-OCD patients as compared to noncomorbid patients.[99]

A single study from Italy assessed Axis II comorbidities and 
reported higher rates of at least one Cluster A personality 
disorder,  at  least  one  Cluster  B  personality  disorder, 
and  narcissistic  and  antisocial  personality  disorder  in 
participants  with  OCD-BD  than  in  those  without  OCD 
comorbidity.[100]  Comorbid  OCD-BD  has  consistently  been 
associated with poorer functioning and lower quality of life 
when compared with those with either OCD or BD alone. 
The mean of number of hospitalizations in BD-OCD patients 
is  also  reported  to  be  significantly  higher  than  in  those 
without comorbidity.[83]

The  course  of  OCD  in  the  context  of  BD  has  been 
predominantly  described  as  being  episodic,[85,88,101-104] 
although exceptions (a continuous, chronic course of OCD) 
have  also  been  described.[91,105]  A  study  reported  episodic 
course of OCD to be more common in BD type II than in BD 
type  I.[102]  In  contrast,  two  studies  found  a  chronic  course 
of affective episodes with residual symptoms in those with 
OCD-BD.[91,105]  There  is  evidence  that  SSRIs  cause  more 
mania/hypomania in BD-OCD patients than in noncomorbid 
patients.[83] OCS are reported to worsen during depression 
and remit/improve in manic/hypomanic phases.[83,85,88]

With  regard  to  onset  of  symptoms,  studies  report  either 
BD-OCD  beginning  concomitantly,[98]  with  BD-OCD  cycling 
together,[106]  OCD  preceding  BD  onset,[85]  or  onset  of 
depressive episodes before the onset of OCD.[107]

Family history
Studies  of  patients  with  OCD/OCS-BD  have  shown  family 
loading for mood disorders,[85,98,108] as well as higher family 
loading for OCD.[80] A family history of mood disorders has 
been reported to be more frequent in patients with episodic 
course of OCD than in those with chronic OCD.[102] However, 
a community-based study found no statistically significant 
differences  in  family  history  for  OCD,  depression,  and 
mania in patients with OCD-BD, when compared with OCD 
comorbid with other anxiety disorders.[95]

Biological markers
There  is  scant  literature  on  biological  correlates  of 
OCD-BD  comorbidity.  A  study  reported  higher  5-HTT 
binding  potential  in  OCD-BD  participants  as  compared 
to  non-OCD-BD  in  the  insula,  posterior  cingulate  cortex, 
subgenual  anterior  cingulate  cortex,  and  in  the  dorsal 
cingulate cortex.[109]

Treatment
Challenges in managing comorbid OCD-BD revolve around 
the  risk  of  SSRIs  causing  manic  switch  or  worsening  the 

course of BD. In addition, there are no systematic data on 
the efficacy of CBT or SSRIs in treating OCD when comorbid 
with BD.

A  study  examining  treatment  outcomes  in  OCD-BD  found 
that  clomipramine  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  SRIs  were 
associated  with  a  higher  rate  of  manic  switches  versus 
noncomorbid  patients.  BD-OCD  patients  not  on  mood 
stabilizers  presented  with  more  frequent  mania  when 
compared with non-BD-OCD patients.[98]

Clinicians may encounter three clinical scenarios. If OCD is 
confined to mood episodes only as is often the case, mood 
stabilization  is  a  priority  and  SSRIs  may  be  avoided.[83]  If 
subclinical  OCS  persists  in  the  inter-episodic  period,  CBT 
along with mood adequate stabilization may be preferred 
over SSRIs if OCS are distressing and interfering. Clinically 
significant OCD in between the episodes also needs to be 
treated with CBT first and if CBT is ineffective or not feasible, 
an SSRI may be used under the cover of mood stabilizers 
and/or  atypical  antipsychotics  with  close  supervision  to 
prevent a switch and cycle acceleration.[83,110]

CONCLUSIONS

OCD  is  a  common  comorbid  condition  in  those  with 
schizophrenia  and  BD.  There  is  some  evidence  that  a 
diagnosis of OCD may be associated with a higher risk for 
later  development  of  both  schizophrenia  and  BD,  but  the 
nature of the relationship with these disorders is still unclear. 
It is, however, evident that episodic OCD may be primarily a 
mood disorder and therefore treatment of OCD confined to 
mood episodes primarily involves mood stabilization with 
mood  stabilizers  and  atypical  antipsychotics.  SSRIs  have 
to  be  used  judiciously  when  treating  OCD  comorbid  with 
BD. OCD in schizophrenia may respond to SSRIs and CBT, 
but  there  is  very  limited  literature  on  treating  comorbid 
OCD  in  patients  with  schizophrenia.  OCD  arising  de  novo 
or worsening of preexisting OCD following treatment with 
atypical  antipsychotics  (clozapine  in  particular)  is  well 
recognized.  More  research  is  needed  to  understand  the 
complex relationship between these comorbidities.
