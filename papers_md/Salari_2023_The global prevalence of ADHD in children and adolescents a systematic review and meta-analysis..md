Abstract
Background  Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder is a developmental neurological disorder that has three basic 
characteristics: Attention Deficit, Hyperactivity, and impulsivity. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of 
ADHD in children and adolescents.

Methods  This investigation was carried out using the meta-analysis method under PRISMA guidelines. Until October 
2020, the articles were gathered by scanning PubMed, Scopus, WOS, and Science Direct databases. The second 
version of Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used to run analyses after extracting data from chosen papers. 
At a significance level of 0.05, the I2 test was used to analyze study heterogeneity, and the Egger test was used to 
assess publication bias.

Results  This analysis includes 61 cross-sectional research, with 53 research used to determine the prevalence of 
ADHD in children, 7.6% of 96,907 children aged 3 to 12 years had ADHD (95% confidence interval: 6.1–9.4%), and 5.6% 
of teenagers aged 12 to 18 years have ADHD (95% confidence interval: 4.8-7%). The prevalence of ADHD in children 
and adolescents according to the DSM-V criterion is also higher than previous diagnostic criteria, according to studies.

Conclusion  The findings of this study based on meta-analysis show the high prevalence of attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of management and policy in 
the treatment and control of ADHD in children and adolescents.

Background
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one 
of  the  most  frequent  neurodevelopmental  disorders  in 
childhood and adolescence, which is typically first, diag-
nosed  in  childhood  and  often  persists  into  adulthood. 
It  is  one  of  the  most  prevalent  causes  of  children  being 
sent to psychology and psychiatric clinics [1, 2]. Children 
with ADHD may struggle to focus, lack self-control and 
impulsive  behaviors,  or  exhibit  excessive  activity  [1–3]. 
Hyperactivity, one of the main symptoms of ADHD, can 
lead  to  a  child’s  psychological  and  social  incompatibil-
ity at home, school, and community [2]. The fundamen-
tal  aspect  of  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder 
ADHD,  according  to  the  Fifth  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM5),  is  a  set  of  behav-
iors that disturb social status. Increased motor activity in 
inappropriate  contexts,  excessive  wobbling,  finger  play, 
and  talkativeness  are  examples  of  these  social  circum-
stances,  which  can  interfere  with  personal  and  educa-
tional life [3].

Attention  deficit  disorder  affects  children  differently 
depending on their age and gender, and it is more com-
mon in boys than in girls [2]. The initial signs of hyper-
activity are frequently hard to detect until a child reaches 
the  age  of  four,  and  it  is  most  evident  in  elementary 
school. In early adolescence, the condition normally fol-
lows a predictable pattern. Yet, studies demonstrate that 
the  main  characteristics  of  ADHD  change  with  age,  so 
regardless  of  classification,  ADHD  seems  to  reduce  in 
adulthood.  Throughout  this  age  range,  hyperactivity  in 
particular, though still present, is less evident (Ramtekkar 
et al. 2010). As a result, a thorough history is required for 
the diagnosis of ADHD which then leads to the identifi-
cation of specific symptoms [5].

Symptoms of ADHD are frequent in school-aged chil-
dren and can last far into adulthood. In general, ADHD 
is  usually  characterized  by  impulsivity,  attention  deficit, 
and  hyperactivity.  A  person  with  inattention  may  have 
trouble remaining on task, maintaining focus, and main-
taining organization. A hyperactive person may appear to 
move around frequently or fidget excessively. An impul-
sive person may behave without thinking or struggle with 
self-control.  [2–6].  Patients  may  be  unable  to  pay  close 
attention  to  detail  or  may  be  careless  when  performing 
tasks such as schoolwork, job, or other activities.

As previously mentioned, boys are more likely to mani-
fest  ADHD  symptoms  [6]  with  three  times  more  likely 
to  receive  an  ADHD  diagnosis  than  girls  [9].  Based  on 
a  study  by  Rucklidge,  there  are  significant  differences  in 
how  the  condition  reveals  in  boys  and  girls.  Boys  with 
ADHD  usually  show  externalized  symptoms,  such  as 
running and impulsivity. Girls with ADHD, on the other 
hand,  typically  show  internalized  symptoms  [9].  These 
symptoms  include  inattentiveness  and  low  self-esteem. 

Boys  also  tend  to  be  more  physically  aggressive  and 
externalize their frustrations, while girls tend to be more 
verbally aggressive and turn their pain and anger inward, 
putting them at an increased risk for depression, anxiety, 
and  eating  disorders  [9].ADHD  in  children  is  caused  by 
several factors, including genetics and environment, pre-
mature  birth,  preeclampsia,  hypertension,  overweight, 
and  obesity  in  pregnant  women,  as  well  as  maternal 
smoking  exposure  [7,  8].  Family  history  studies  have 
also shown that drug abuse plays a significant role in the 
development  of  ADHD  [9]  Identifying  whether  a  child 
has ADHD is a multi-step process. There is no single test 
that  can  detect  ADHD.  To  diagnose  ADHD  a  checklist 
for rating the symptoms is provided and a history of the 
child from parents, teachers, and sometimes, the child is 
taken [3–9].

Guardiola  et  al.  carried  out  a  study  in  which  they 
assessed  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  484  pupils  using 
two  criteria:  DSM-IV  and  neuropsychological  criteria. 
The results showed that the incidence of ADHD using the 
DSM-IV  criterion  and  the  neuropsychological  criterion 
were 18% and 3.5%, respectively [10]. Shabani et al. con-
ducted  another  research  wherein  428  elementary  pupils 
were  studied.  According  to  the  findings  of  this  study, 
4.9% of students (or 21 persons) have ADHD [11].

According to a survey conducted by Adonna et al., 8.7% 
of  Nigerian  students  aged  7  to  12  had  ADHD.  In  addi-
tion,  the  prevalence  of  attention-deficit  subtypes  was 
determined  to  be  4.9%,  hyperactivity/impulsivity  sub-
type 1.2%, and hyperactivity and attention deficit subtype 
2.6% in this study [12]. According to research by Mahala 
et  al.,  18.1%  of  Tunisian  youngsters  suffer  from  ADHD 
[13].  ADHD  was  identified  as  the  most  common  disor-
der  among  teenagers  in  another  study  by  Oes  Borg  et 
al., which looked into the prevalence of chronic diseases 
among  adolescents  with  mental  disabilities  aged  18 − 12 
[14].

Another study on the prevalence of ADHD was under-
taken by Maulov et al. A total of 210 Lebanese teenagers 
between the ages of 11 and 17 were studied. 10.2% of per-
sons have ADHD, according to the findings of this study 
[15].

There are several inconsistencies across research on the 
prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents, which 
are influenced by a variety of factors including diagnostic 
criteria  variances.  As  a  result,  this  study  was  conducted 
to  determine  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  children  and 
adolescents based on various diagnostic criteria and age 
groups.

Method
This  research  looked  at  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  in 
children  and  adolescents  by  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis  of  cross-sectional  data.  The  technique  for 

Salari et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics           (2023) 49:48 Page 3 of 12

carrying out the various stages of this study following the 
criteria of Guideline [16] was created and implemented.

Eligibility criteria
In general, the criteria for selecting documents in system-
atic  review  and  meta-analysis  are  within  the  framework 
of  PICOS  (Population,  Intervention,  Comparison,  Out-
comes, Study) [17]. In this study, the eligibility criteria are 
based on these conditions. Population: All people under 
the  age  of  18  were  examined  in  this  study.  Exposure: 
Affected  children  and  adolescents.  Outcomes:  Because 
of  the  differences  in  diagnostic  criteria  for  ADHD  and 
the prevalence of ADHD in different age and gender sub-
groups,  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  was  evaluated  using 
DSM-V, DSM-IV, DSM IV-TR, and ICD10 criteria. Type 
of study: Cross-sectional observational studies were uti-
lized to establish the disease’s prevalence. Other observa-
tional studies and methodologies, such as interventional 
review, were left out of the analysis.

Data sources and search strategy
The authors reviewed four electronic bibliographic data-
bases,  including  PubMed,  Scopus,  WOS,  and  science 
direct,  as  well  as  any  electronic  publications  printed 
before October 2020. Mesh terms and keywords used in 
review studies and previously published studies were uti-
lized  to  choose  the  relevant  keywords,  which  were  cho-
sen  by  one  of  the  authors  (MSH)  and  confirmed  by  the 
first  and  second  authors.  All  keywords  were  selected  in 
English.  The  search  strategy  in  this  study  was  designed 
using  the  terms  “prevalence  OR  outbreak  OR  Global 
prevalence AND ADHD OR ADDH OR “Attention Defi-
cit Hyperactivity Disorder”.

Selection of studies
After  using  Endnote  software  to  remove  duplicate  arti-
cles,  an  author  (MSH)  examined  the  study’s  title  and 
abstract.  Excluded  studies  were  those  that  did  not  meet 
the  entry  and  exit  criteria.  The  whole  text  of  the  paper 
was  then  examined  by  two  writers  (MSH  and  HGH) 
based  on  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  These  experi-
ments  were  carried  out  independently  and  by  blinding. 
Any comments given to affirm or reject the research were 
re-examined  after  the  reviews  were  completed  at  this 
step.  In  the  case  of  a  disagreement,  the  study  was  con-
firmed using the third author’s (MM) reviews. If the full 
text of the study was not available, an email or research 
gate request was submitted to the paper’s lead author.

In this study, the STROBE checklist [17] was used as a 
tool to measure methodological quality in observational 
studies.  According  to  the  various  criteria  of  this  check-
list, the title, abstract, introduction, method, and results 
of observational studies with a minimum score of 0 and a 
maximum score of 32 were considered separately. Studies 

with  a  score  less  than  16  were  considered  at  high  risk 
for bias. However, none of the studies were omitted due 
to  low-quality  or  high  risk  of  bias,  and  all  studies  were 
analyzed.

Data extraction
Information  gathering  was  performed  by  two  authors 
(MSH and HGH). This data was gathered using the meth-
odology and findings of preliminary research. A form was 
created  to  extract  information  such  as  the  first  author’s 
name, year of publication, country, population examined 
by  gender,  diagnostic  criteria,  and  diagnostic  instru-
ments.  Data  were  extracted  by  (MSH)  and  reviewed  by 
(MM).

Statistical analysis

The  heterogeneity  of  the  studies  was  assessed  using  the 
I2 test. The Egger test and its accompanying Funnel plot 
were used to analyze the publication bias due to the large 
number of samples included in the study. Comprehensive 
Meta-Analysis software (Version 2) was used to examine 
the data.

Results
A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  information 
on research on the prevalence of ADHD in children and 
adolescents  around  the  world  was  conducted  in  this 
study,  with  no  time  constraint  until  2020  and  following 
PRISMA principles. 1837 potentially related articles were 
found  and  transferred  to  the  information  management 
software  based  on  an  initial  database  search  (EndNote). 
A  total  of  1837  studies  were  found,  with  170  duplicate 
studies being eliminated. Out of 1667 papers, 1442 were 
eliminated  during  the  screening  phase  after  titles  and 
abstracts were examined for inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria. 164 articles were removed from the remaining 225 
studies  during  the  competency  evaluation  phase  due 
to  irrelevance  after  analyzing  the  full  text  of  the  article 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All 61 articles 
were  approved  in  the  qualitative  evaluation  stage  after 
reading  the  complete  text  of  the  article  and  calculating 
the STROBE score (Table 1).

General prevalence of hyperactivity in children 
(under 12 years)
Based  on  the  I2  test  results  (98.6)  and  the  heterogeneity 
of  the  chosen  research,  a  stochastic  effects  model  was 
utilized  to  combine  studies  and  estimate  overall  preva-
lence.  Study  heterogeneity  can  be  caused  by  differences 
in  sample  size,  sampling  error,  research  year,  and  study 
location. The  funnel  diagram  and  Egger  test  at  a  signifi-
cance level of 0.05 revealed that there was no publication 
bias  in  the  distribution  of  data  in  the  current  investiga-
tion (P = 0.107). (Fig. 1).

Based  on  the  results  of  Table  2  and  the  methods  of 
diagnosing hyperactivity in children under the age of 12, 
the  DSM-IV   diagnostic  criterion  of  ADHD  prevalence 
was 7.7% (95% confidence interval: 6-9.9%).

Page 7 of 12

Other  criteria  used  to  determine  the  prevalence  of 
ADHD  in  children  were  DSM-IV-TR,  DSM-III,  DSM-V, 
DSM-IV,  and  ICD10,  which  were:  8.3%  (95%  confidence 
interval: 
interval:  4.9–13.9%);  10.1%  (95%confidence 
9-11.3%);  11.3%  (95%  confidence  interval:  5.3–22.2%); 
and 4.4% (95%confidence interval: 2.4–8.2%), respectively 
(Table 2).

The  prevalence  of  ADHD  was  also  studied  in  Table  3. 
According  to  the  findings  of  24  studies  on  ADHD  in 
children under the age of 12, the prevalence of the Inat-
tentive  subtype  was  33.2%  (95%  confidence  interval: 
27.6–39.3%),  Hyperactive  impulsive  subtype  was  30.3% 
(95%  confidence  interval:  23.8.37.7%),  and  Combined 
ADHD  was  31.4%  (95%  confidence  interval:  24.6.39.1%) 
(Table 3).

General prevalence of hyperactivity in adolescents 
(12–18 years)
A random-effects model was used to integrate the stud-
ies and estimate the shared prevalence based on the test 
results  (I2:  97.8)  and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  selected 
research. Differences in sample size, sampling error, year, 
or study location can all contribute to the study heteroge-
neity The possibility of bias in the dissemination of data 
was  determined  using  a  funnel  diagram  and  the  Egger 
test  at  a  significance  level  of  0.05  in  the  current  study 
(P = 0.774). (Fig. 3).

In  25  studies  involving  teenagers  aged  12  to  18,  the 
prevalence  of  ADHD  was  determined  to  be  5.6%  (95%

hyperactivity  in  children  aged  12–18  years,  the  ADHD 
prevalence  was  7.1%  (95%  confidence  interval:  4.9–
10.1%).  Other  criteria  used  to  determine  the  prevalence 
of  ADHD  in  children  included  DSM-IV-TR,  DSM-V, 
DSM-IV,  and  ICD10  which  reported  to  be:  7.5%  (95% 
confidence  interval:  1.7–15.2%),  12.7%  (95%  confidence 
interval:  6.7–19.1%),  and  1.7%  (95%  confidence  interval: 
1.1–4.5%), respectively (Table 4).

Table  5  looked  at  the  prevalence  of  different  kinds  of 
ADHD.  According  to  the  findings  of  five  studies  involv-
ing children aged 12 to 18, the prevalence of Inattentive 
Subtype was 37.3% (95% confidence interval: 30–45.4%), 
Hyperactive-Impulsive  Subtype  was  23.1%  (95%  confi-
dence  interval:  13.2-  38.2%),  and  Combined  ADHD  was 
31.1% (95% confidence interval: 15.6 -42.3%) (Table 5).

Discussion
The objective of this paper was to figure out how preva-
lent ADHD is in children and adolescents. According to 
the  findings  of  this  study,  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  in 
children aged 3 to 12 years is higher than in adolescents 
aged  12  to  18.  It  was  also  shown  that  the  prevalence  of 
this  condition  varies  depending  on  the  diagnostic  crite-
ria used. According to studies, the prevalence of ADHD 
in children and adolescents diagnosed using the DSM-V 
criteria  is  higher  than  using  alternative  diagnostic  crite-
ria.  The  prevalence  of  several  forms  of  ADHD  was  also 
measured in this study, and the results show that the per-
centage  of  ADHD-I,  ADHD-H,  and  ADHD-C  is  nearly 
equal  in  children.  Adolescents  with  ADHD-I,  on  the 
other hand, had a slightly higher prevalence of the disor-
der than those with other forms of ADHD.

ADHD  is  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Excessive 
motor activity, inattention, and impulsivity are all symp-
toms  of  this  disease  in  children  and  adolescents  [5]. 
According to the findings, the incidence of ADHD is 7.6% 
in children aged 3 to 12 years and 5.6% in teenagers aged 
12 to 18. The findings of this study are nearly identical to 
those  of  earlier  meta-analysis  studies  on  the  prevalence 
of ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in children has been 
estimated  to  be  between  2  and  7%  in  previous  research 
[75].

Only  one  study  [76]  documented  the  prevalence  of 
ADHD  in  teenagers  other  than  children,  which  is  con-
sistent  with  our  findings.  According  to  the  findings  of  a 
2012 study, the prevalence of ADHD in children aged 6 to 
12 years was 11.4%, and in youngsters aged 12 to 18 years 
was 8%, which was slightly higher than our findings. The 
discrepancy  is  understandable  because  this  study  only 
looked  at  the  DSM-IV  criterion.  Another  study,  which 
looked at the incidence of ADHD in African children and 
adolescents  in  2020,  discovered  that  7.47%  of  children 
and  adolescents  in  Africa  had  the  disorder.  The  preva-
lence of ADHD is higher in boys than in girls, according 
to this study [77]. People under the age of 18 were evalu-
ated in another meta-analysis study conducted in Spain. 
The  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  children  and  adolescents 
was  6.6%  in  this  study,  and  7%  in  children  (participants 
under 12 years old), which is similar to the current study 
[78]. Another study looked at the prevalence of ADHD in 

Page 9 of 12

Chinese children and youths, finding that 5.74% of chil-
dren  and  6.72%  of  children  and  adolescents  had  ADHD 
[79].

Another analysis carried out in this study was to deter-
mine  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  using  various  diagnostic 
criteria. The prevalence of ADHD was higher when using 
the  DSM-V  diagnostic  criterion  than  when  using  other 
criteria, according to the findings. The DSM-V diagnos-
tic  criteria  were  very  similar  to  the  DSM-IV.  However, 
the prevalence and disorder definitions in DSM-V differ 
from those in DSM-IV. Previously, the spread of the dis-
ease  was  determined  by  reviewing  the  symptoms  of  the 
disorder, which in the DSM-V is defined as the presence 
of two or more symptoms of the stated criteria. In  light 
of these circumstances, the rise in the number of patients 
diagnosed with ADHD based on DSM-V diagnostic cri-
teria is reasonable [80].

According to the results obtained in this study, at adult 
ages  and  as  people  get  older  ADHD  appears  to  be  less 
common.  However,  because  no  follow-up  investigations 
have  been  conducted,  this  issue  cannot  be  definitively 
addressed.  Adults  have  lower  rates  of  ADHD  than  chil-
dren, according to previous research [77].

Song P., et al. research was done as a meta-analysis in 
2021.  The  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  adults  with  persis-
tent  (childhood  AHDH)  and  symptomatic  (not  include 
childhood ADHD) ADHD was investigated in this study. 
Around 140 million persons were evaluated for persistent 
ADHD in this study, with only 2.58% having the disease. 
The  study  also  looked  at  symptomatic  ADHD  in  a  pop-
ulation  of  370  million  individuals,  with  6.76%  of  people 
over the age of 18 having the disorder. On the other hand, 
the  findings  of  this  study  demonstrated  that  when  par-
ticipants’  ages  increase  in  both  groups,  the  prevalence 
of  ADHD  decreases,  which  is  consistent  with  our  find-
ings  [81].  Another  study  indicated  that  the  prevalence 
of ADHD was lower in adults over the age of 18 than in 
teenagers [76]. Even though the prevalence of ADHD in 
adults  is  decreasing,  it  is  nevertheless  recognized  as  a 
risk factor for issues such as academic failure, workplace 
challenges,  and  criminality  [75].  Adults  with  ADHD  are 
more likely to commit crimes. As a result, the number of 
people in prison with ADHD is on the rise [82]. Further-
more, because the onset of ADHD symptoms in adults is 
socially problematic, many of these people will be admit-
ted  to  psychiatric  hospitals,  affecting  the  prevalence  of 
ADHD in adults in the general population [82, 83].

Limitation
One of the limitations of this study is the high heteroge-
neity of studies in terms of age group. Since the purpose 
of  this  study  was  to  measure  the  prevalence  of  children 
and adolescents separately, studies that report the preva-
lence  of  ADHD  in  children  and  adolescents  combined 

Salari et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics           (2023) 49:48 were  removed.  Furthermore,  because  this  study  only 
looked  at  cross-sectional  papers,  it  was  impossible  to 
track the participants and measure their symptoms over 
time.

Conclusion
The  findings  of  this  study  based  on  meta-analysis  dem-
onstrate  the  significant  prevalence  of  attention  defi-
cit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)The  results  of  this 
investigation  corroborate  prior  research  and  highlight 
the  importance  of  planning  and  policy-making  in  the 
treatment and control of ADHD in children and adoles-
cents.  Future  research  should  look  into  the  prevalence 
of ADHD in different age groups and how it affects their 
personal and social lives.
