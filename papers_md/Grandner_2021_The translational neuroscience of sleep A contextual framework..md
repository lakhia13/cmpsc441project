Abstract

Sleep is entwined across many physiologic processes in the brain and periphery, thereby exerting 
tremendous influence on our well-being. Yet sleep exists in a social-environmental context. 
Contextualizing sleep health with respect to its determinants—from individual- to societal-level 
factors—would enable neuroscientists to more effectively translate sleep health into clinical 
practice. Key challenges and opportunities pertain to (i) recognizing and exploring sleep’s 
functional roles, (ii) clarifying causal mechanisms in relation to key outcomes, (iii) developing 
richer model systems, (iv) linking models to known contextual factors, and (v) leveraging 
advances in multisensory technology. Meeting these challenges and opportunities would help 
transcend disciplinary boundaries such that social-environmental considerations related to sleep 
would become an ever-greater presence in the clinic.

Sleep is generally defined as a naturally recurring, reversible state of perceptual 
disengagement, reduced consciousness, and relative immobility, the propensity of which 
is patterned by homeostatic and circadian factors. Many studies have described the 
neurophysiology that contributes to sleep regulation, including the neuroanatomy of 
sleep and arousal-promoting circuitry (1); the diffuse, interconnected neurotransmitter 
systems that transition between non–rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), REM sleep, and 
wakefulness (2); and the core molecular clock mechanism and circadian pacemaker activity 
within the brain (3). Additional work has delineated how sleep serves as a prerequisite 
for optimizing the performance of critical biological functions, including those related 
to memory (4), waste clearance from the brain (5), and nutrient metabolism (6). Over 
the past 70 years, sleep has been increasingly conceptualized with deference to these 
findings, promoting an understanding of sleep as a set of interrelated physiological processes 
sometimes devoid of greater biological and social-environmental context.

Sleep is not just a collection of physiologic processes that occur together at the intersection 
of rest and activity and of circadian light-dark rhythms. Sleep is a non-negotiable biological 
state required for the maintenance of human life. It is associated with behaviors, but sleep 
itself is not a volitional behavior. It involves physiologic processes but is more than an

amalgam of them. Sleep is a foundational aspect of our biology—our need for sleep parallels 
those for air, food, and water.

Total sleep deprivation results in death in animal models (7). For obvious ethical reasons, no 
previous scientific work has empirically tested the amount of sleep deprivation necessary to 
induce organ failure and death in humans. Prolonged sleep deprivation in humans has been 
studied, though. When sleep is curtailed, sleep propensity increases, such that individuals 
kept from sleep for extended periods will fall asleep faster and more deeply when sleep is 
no longer restricted (8). Continued wakefulness for several days results in the occurrence of 
involuntary sleep, where individuals fall asleep even while trying to stay awake. Although 
there are no formal studies of human mortality related to in-lab sleep loss, there are many 
reported cases in which sleep propensity was sufficiently high to induce involuntary sleep 
initiation, even during activities when such an event would likely result in death (such as 
while driving a car) (9). Thus, sleep is not a luxury for people with too much free time; it is a 
biological necessity whose many functions are increasingly the interest of study.

Yet, modern society has a complicated relationship with sleep health. The drive for 
productivity has led to spoken and unspoken pressures for minimizing sleep. Incentives 
can be both direct (e.g., rewards for staying awake to perform tasks) or indirect (e.g., 
being perceived as more industrious). Existing evidence suggests that Americans trade sleep 
hours for work or leisure hours (10) and that this trade-off is exacerbated by modern 
sedentary lifestyles and use of electronic media at night. This larger discrepancy between the 
physiologic importance of sleep and its societal devaluing has deleterious consequences for 
health and well-being at the level of the individual, with collective effects that ripple across 
the population.

The field of neuroscience is well positioned to improve our basic understanding of how 
sleep is dynamically regulated and how it relates to other functions in the brain and 
periphery. Neuroscience is also well suited to leverage the translational potential of sleep 
to improve society. The fact that sleep is a fixture within so many aspects of our biology 
presents challenges and complications for the field. However, at the same time, it offers a 
range of opportunities for improving clinical outcomes in areas of medicine that are not 
accustomed to considering the influence of sleep on disease processes or the influence of 
social-environmental factors in shaping sleep health.

Conceptualizing sleep health

Sleep health, like proper nutrition, is not a unitary construct. Borrowing from paradigms 
historically used to define general health, Buysse’s RU-SATED model outlines six 
dimensions of sleep health (11). These include:

1) Regularity. Regularity refers to the degree to which sleep occurs at approximately the 
same time each day. Irregular sleep schedules are an independent predictor of adverse 
health outcomes (12). These associations are thought to arise from decreased circadian 
synchronization across organ and tissue systems, disorganized patterns of cellular and

organismal stress, and weekday-to-weekend fluctuations in sleep timing that may induce 
repetitive episodes of circadian disruption and occasional sleep insufficiency.

2) Satisfaction. Subjective sleep satisfaction remains an important indicator of sleep health. 
Although considered an imprecise measure, it predicts clinical outcomes (13), may reflect 
the presence of sleep impairments that are otherwise difficult to detect and assess, and 
may represent underlying physiologic processes for which there are no validated assessment 
tools, such as subcortical activation and local wakefulness in the brain (14).

3) Alertness. The ability to maintain attentive wakefulness during the day carries important 
safety implications, as well as implications for cardiometabolic health (15). Laboratory 
studies indicate that dulled alertness that stems from sleep loss can be profound and 
cumulative (16).

4) Timing. The circadian system partitions many aspects of sleep to the “biological night,” 
which represents the portion of the 24-hour day that is behaviorally and physiologically 
conducive for sleep and sleep-related restorative activities organized within and between the 
brain and body (17).

5) Efficiency. Sleep efficiency refers to the ratio between the time spent asleep and the 
time available for sleeping. It is a standard metric used in the assessment and treatment 
of insomnia (18). Low sleep efficiency is associated with daytime dysfunction and adverse 
longitudinal health outcomes (19).

6) Duration. Consensus statements from several scientific, medical, and public health 
organizations recommend that adults, in general, should obtain at least 7 hours of sleep 
per night (20). Some statements have further advised that adults should not aim for more 
than 9 hours (20). Recommendations for children and adolescents have also been published 
(20, 21), providing suggested ranges of daily sleep that scale inversely with age (i.e., infants 
require the most sleep, toddlers less sleep than infants, and so on until late adolescence when 
adultlike levels of sleep are recommended). For more than 50 years, self-reported sleep 
duration has been associated with mortality, including 7 of the 15 leading causes of death in 
the US (22).

Sleep and health outcomes

Cardiovascular health

Habitual sleep duration outside of the normative 7- to 8-hour range contributes to an 
increased incidence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality 
(23, 24). Cross-sectionally, habitual sleep duration and quality are associated with 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary disease, vascular disease, myocardial infarction, and 
stroke (23, 25). Primary sleep disorders such as sleep apnea (26), insomnia (24, 27), sleep-
related movement disorders (28), and narcolepsy (29) also influence cardiovascular health. 
The mechanisms that bridge sleep to cardiovascular health remain elusive but seem to 
implicate sympathetic activation, cellular stress, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation 
(23).

Metabolic health

Page 4

Extensive investigation has revealed a cross-sectional relationship between habitual sleep 
duration outside the normative range and obesity-related outcomes (30). Meta-analyses 
of longitudinal studies suggest that the incidence of obesity is elevated in habitual short 
sleepers (≤6 hours) relative to 7- to 8-hour sleepers (31). This is consistent with other 
work showing that sleep loss impairs insulin and glucose homeostasis, disrupts metabolic 
hormones (e.g., leptin and ghrelin), alters adipose tissue function, and contributes to the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (32).

Immunologic health

Sleep deprivation generates a proinflammatory state, as ascertained by tests performed 
in the lab or in the field (33). In laboratory settings, acute deprivation alters the 
expression, production, and/or function of cytokines, antibodies, and leukocytes. Field-based 
investigations suggest that overly short or long sleep duration promotes plasma-level 
markers of inflammation (34). Accordingly, habitual insufficient sleep has been linked to 
increased rates of infection, reduced recovery capacity, and blunted vaccine responses (35). 
The presence of primary sleep disorders also factors into immune health: Sleep apnea and 
insomnia are each associated with constitutive elevations in circulating immune markers 
(36, 37). The relationship between sleep and the immune system is likely bidirectional (via 
homeostatic and neuroimmune interactions), with a deficiency in either poised to negatively 
affect the quality of the other (38).

Mental health

Insomnia is a well-established risk factor for depression and is implicated across several 
neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety, psychotic, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorders (39). Elevated suicide risk is associated with increased insomnia, nightmares, and 
habitual sleep duration outside of the normative range (40). Nocturnal wakefulness—simply 
being awake in the middle of the night—may also represent a risk factor for suicide (41, 42). 
In general, sleep disruption produces basic functional impairments in emotion regulation, 
recognition, reasoning, and memory (43). This may be driven by neurophysiologic changes 
to cortical and subcortical structures that are unduly affected by acute or chronic sleep loss.

Behavioral health

Several studies have correlated differences in sleep to differences in the willingness of 
individuals to engage in unhealthy behaviors (especially those with an impulse-control 
component). For example, insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality have been associated 
with suboptimal dietary health at the population level (44). In the laboratory, acute sleep loss 
provokes increased calorie consumption, particularly late at night (45). Translational work 
in human and animal models suggests that eating during the night impairs metabolism (46). 
Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality are further associated with more sedentary behavior, 
less exercise, more habitual smoking, and greater use of alcohol (47). Adding sleep health 
components to intervention strategies may aid in efforts such as smoking cessation (48).

Cognitive health

Page 5

Connections between sleep and neurocognitive health are documented across the scientific 
literature. In addition to its acute effects on executive function and declarative memory 
(49), poor sleep has been prospectively linked with the development and progression of 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (50). A plausible mechanism linking sleep to AD is the function 
of the glymphatic system, which operates in a sleep-dependent fashion to clear AD-related 
proteins such as amyloid-b (Ab) and tau from the brain’s interstitial space. Sleep contributes 
to the regulation of Ab and tau proteins and discourages their buildup into pathological 
aggregates (51). In the wider population, those who report habitual insufficient and/or poor 
sleep quality evince less work productivity (52), more drowsy driving (53), and increased 
propensity for injuries or errors (54).

Intersecting and interacting influences

Literature that links sleep to health is frequently circumscribed in that individual studies 
typically focus on a singular aspect of sleep health paired to one domain of interest. For 
example, studies of sleep duration and metabolic health do not typically quantify other 
sleep metrics (such as sleep quality, satisfaction, or daytime alertness) or assess multiple 
outcome domains (such as emotion regulation and decision-making). Yet, interactions 
between sleep health variables have been repeatedly demonstrated. For example, many 
individuals who experience insufficient sleep duration also experience insomnia symptoms 
(55). Understanding the isolated and combined effects of multiple domains of sleep health 
can potentially enhance our mechanistic understanding of clinical outcomes in depression, 
obesity, and those pertaining to cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke. 
Furthermore, although cardiometabolic and psychological domains are rarely assessed 
together, poor mental health can adversely affect cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune 
system activity, which are also influenced by neurocognitive processes such as health-related 
decision-making. Part of the mechanistic pathway that links poor sleep to cardiometabolic 
health may indeed be associated with mental health [e.g., emotional eating (56)] and/or 
altered executive function [e.g., decision-making about food choices (57)].

Conceptualizing sleep health in context

As outlined above, sleep health makes important contributions to a wide array of 
clinical outcomes. Additional work has conceptualized determinants of sleep itself. 
Understanding the factors that shape sleep health has the potential to improve intervention 
strategies and identify therapeutic targets applicable to cardiovascular, neurocognitive or 
neurodegenerative, and immune-related disorders such as cancer.

Individual-level factors

The most proximal influences on sleep are individual-level factors. These are factors that are 
embedded within the everyday life of the person—their demographic and personality traits, 
along with their beliefs, attitudes, and habits.

Age. Older adults experience systematic declines in sleep efficiency and time spent in 
slow-wave sleep (58). Age-related increases are observed in the prevalence of primary sleep

disorders such as sleep apnea (59), chronic insomnia (60), nocturia (61), and movement-
related nocturnal disorders [e.g., restless legs syndrome (62)]. Paradoxically, subjective 
measures of general sleep disturbance (63), perceived sleep insufficiency (64), and sleep 
debt (65) all tend to decrease. In a similar vein, short sleep duration is less strongly 
associated—or not associated at all—with obesity and hypertension in later life (66, 67). 
Laboratory studies indicate that the cognitive performance of older individuals may also be 
more resilient to the detrimental effects of sleep loss (68).

Sex at birth. Females are at greater risk for insomnia and will report more dissatisfaction 
with sleep (69), whereas males are at relatively greater risk of sleep apnea (59). Specific 
to females are prolonged episodes of sleep disturbance and daytime fatigue associated with 
menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period, perimenopause, and menopause (70, 71).

Race and ethnicity. Sleep disparities are well characterized in the US population (72–75). 
Black and African American individuals are significantly more likely to report insufficient 
sleep, as well as long sleep duration, relative to non-Hispanic white individuals. Various 
disparities related to sleep health are also seen in Hispanic and Latinx individuals, Asian 
and Asian American people, and multiracial individuals. These associations are reliable 
even after adjustment for socioeconomics and other demographic considerations (76). 
Notably, the relationship between sleep and cardiometabolic health that pervades the general 
population is differentiated by race and ethnicity, which suggests that disparities in sleep 
health may be integral to larger health care disparities (77). Future research priorities will 
aim to elucidate and address the racial and ethnic sleep disparities that figure more and more 
prominently in the literature (78).

Beliefs, attitudes, and habits. Work in this area is still emerging, though evidence suggests 
that individuals with more-positive beliefs and attitudes about sleep or who adopt sleep-
protective behaviors (e.g., good sleep hygiene) are more likely to experience better sleep 
health (79).

Social-level factors

Individual-level factors are embedded within social-level factors. Examples of social-level 
factors that can potentially influence sleep are work and occupation, family and home, 
neighborhood, religion, social networks, and culture. Of these, several have been specifically 
evaluated with respect to sleep health.

Socioeconomic position. Associations abound between socioeconomic position and sleep 
health. Poverty (75, 80) and the trappings of poverty, such as food insecurity (76, 81), 
housing insecurity (82), and lower educational attainment (72, 80), are all associated with 
worse measures of sleep, including insufficient sleep duration and decreased sleep quality.

Work and occupation. Shift work is a well-established impediment to healthy sleep (83). For 
non-shift workers, long commute times, stressful work conditions, and longer work hours 
impair sleep (84, 85). Job loss and unemployment likewise moderate sleep health (86).

Home and family. Caregiving responsibilities present barriers to sleep health (87). Larger 
households may also contribute to patterns of insufficient sleep (64).

Neighborhood. Increased neighborhood light at night, increased traffic, and noise pollution 
are associated with worse sleep outcomes (88). People who live in neighborhoods that are 
more disordered (e.g., with more graffiti and crime) or perceived as less safe experience 
poorer sleep overall (e.g., shorter duration, less efficiency, and more daytime sleepiness) 
(89). Notably, individuals who perceive their neighborhood to be less socially cohesive also 
experience reduced sleep quality (90).

Societal-level factors

Societal-level factors are built from social-level factors. Societal factors include technology, 
public policy (91), geography (92), racism and discrimination (93), globalization and “24/7” 
society (i.e., general lifestyles of work and leisure in which people may be active at any hour 
and do not necessarily sleep consistently at night). Although these factors are not readily 
manipulable, recognizing their influence on sleep health can inform our understanding of 
how sleep is shaped and how this influence has the potential to shape other health- and 
disease-related outcomes.

Social-ecological model of sleep health

The embedded model of individual-, social-, and societal-level factors of sleep health, and 
the mental and physical health effects of sleep, are depicted in Fig. 1. This social-ecological 
model of sleep health was originally described in 2010 (22) and has since been conceptually 
refined (94). This model provides a framework for understanding sleep health in a broader 
biological and social-environmental context. The framework can be leveraged to inform 
better diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic diseases whose progression and 
treatment receptibility are often influenced by sleep.

Sleep health technology

One of the societal-level factors that has profoundly affected population sleep health 
is technological progress, particularly with re gard to the proliferation of portable sleep-
assessment technology, the ubiquitous access to digital media at night, and the cultivation of 
“big data” sources enabling access to sleep health information.

Portable sleep-assessment technology

Over the past few decades, wearable sleep actigraphy has undergone notable innovation, 
with newly built capabilities for multiaxial accelerometry and microelectromechanical 
systems enabling high-resolution detection of movement, as well as detection strategies 
for other peripheral signals (such as heart rate) that can improve assessments of sleep 
when computed alongside movement information (95). These devices are now available as 
consumer devices, some of which may be more accurate than their traditional scientific 
counterparts (96). The increasing use of these devices to assess sleep has led to clinical 
issues such as orthosomnia (97).

Electronic media use at night

Many people bring electronic devices into the bedroom and use them in bed during the 
nighttime hours that overlap with their routine sleep schedule. These trends are a cause

for concern, because electronic media consumption at night prior to sleep can delay sleep 
onset, reduce sleep duration, impair sleep quality, worsen circadian health, and decrease 
daytime functioning (98). The mechanisms behind these disturbances range from exposure 
to short-wavelength light (99) to the cognitive and emotional stimulation caused by engaging 
content (100). These effects are pronounced in younger individuals, who have delayed sleep 
phases (101).

Big data and internet of things

As wearable sensor technology becomes increasingly inexpensive and sensors capable 
of inferring aspects of sleep-wake behavior become better integrated within the built 
environment, broader datasets will be collected to provide actionable knowledge about real-
world sleep and circadian health. For example, large datasets curated from consumer apps 
have been used to describe changing sleep patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic (102); 
electronic medical records are providing insights at the provider, network, and national 
levels (103); and deep repositories of sleep-assessment data are being used to train artificial 
intelligence to better interpret sleep-wake physiology in relation to health (104).

Challenges and opportunities for translating sleep considerations into 

clinical study and practice

Challenges

1) Define the deeper biological context of sleep. Hallmarks for defining sleep include 
electrophysiological changes in the frequency, amplitude, and synchronicity of brain activity 
measured via electroencephalography (EEG) in humans and other mammals or local field 
potential recordings in invertebrates. Implicit within these definitions is that sleep is a 
phenomenon that can be objectively quantified only through networks of cells coordinated, 
in animals, with centralized nervous systems. Thus, these criteria cannot be applied 
universally across simpler organisms, such as those that populate the gut microbiome, or to 
single cells and cell masses involved with tumor growth and metastasis. There may be ways 
to define sleep at the single-cell level within the nucleus that have yet to be fully considered 
(105). The interphase nucleus of cells is a vibrant area, where chromosomes exhibit a 
polarized, multilayered spatial architecture on the basis of their proximity to structural 
elements of the nucleus, subnuclear structures, and one another along topologically 
associating domains and long-range chromatin interactions. These organization motifs—and 
many finer ones—contribute to how genomic expression is circadian-regulated and may 
provide insights into how sleep is expressed at the single-cell level or dysregulated in cancer 
cells or cells situated within various neurodegenerative disease contexts. These changes can 
become treatment targets in their own right.

2) Clarify the neuroscientific mechanisms that underlie different facets of sleep health. 
Although many studies have linked different aspects of sleep to outcomes, there is relatively 
little work that delineates the specific pathways by which this occurs. Perhaps answers 
lie in genetic studies. For example, people with an autosomal dominant mutation in the 
b1-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB1-A187V) (106), a missense mutation in the DEC2 gene 
(BHLHE41) (107), or a point mutation in neuropeptide S receptor 1 gene (NPSR1) (108)

seem to require less sleep than those in the general population. Further characterization 
of these genes may help uncover presently unknown mechanistic pathways for sleep 
duration and increase the impetus to identify genes that influence other dimensions of sleep 
health, such as sleep efficiency and satisfaction. Improved understanding of the overarching 
“genetics of sleep health” would enable clinical investigators to develop genetic (along with 
social-environmental) profiles for the sleep health of trial participants and patients, as well 
as to consider when stronger or weaker associations might be expected between sleep and 
health outcomes of interest.

3) Identify translational models that link sleep and circadian neuroscience to clinical 
outcomes with wider population relevance. Efforts to study other generalizable contexts 
that connect sleep to health are needed. One example is in neurodevelopment: A mother’s 
relative inability to sleep during pregnancy may be linked to increased adiposity in offspring 
(109), along with increased infant snoring (110), worse temperament (mood regulation) 
(110, 111), and more nighttime awakenings before consolidation of the sleep schedule (111). 
Given these observations, work in animal models might explore the biological mechanisms 
by which sleep disruption during pregnancy can influence long-term risk prevalence 
for physical and mental health conditions. Perhaps maternal sleep deficiency leads to 
changes in the uterine environment, thus provoking epigenetic reprogramming of sleep and 
arousal in offspring (112). Consequences related to maternal sleep deprivation have already 
been reported in rodents (113). Greater study of prenatal sleep in parents and neonatal 
sleep in infants may produce insights into conditions with important neurodevelopmental 
components, such as intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia.

4) Integrate the behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of sleep health into 
neuroscientific models that leverage a social-ecological framework. A future challenge in the 
sleep field will be to incorporate what we are learning at the population level, by monitoring 
morbidity reports and the effects of public health policy, and then translate it back to 
preclinical animal models. Such an effort would require closer collaboration between human 
and animal researchers to create reliable paradigms for translating findings between species 
with overlapping, but in many cases separate, determinants of sleep health. This issue is as 
difficult as it is urgent. Attempts at addressing it might start with the simple premise that 
rodent sleep in the lab is often socially impoverished relative to sleep in the wild or the sleep 
of humans. Cosleeping might be a factor that better unmasks relationships between sleep 
and health in lab animals, thus enabling more reliable application of findings to people.

5) Develop better technological strategies for tracking sleep health and translating these 
data into actionable insights (with all due legal and ethical considerations). Many of the 
challenges associated with translating real-world sleep into personalized health interventions 
involve engineering and computational challenges, such as developing better sensors, 
developing better strategies for combining and integrating multimodal time-series data, and 
applying artificial intelligence to predict changes in sleep metrics that will have tangible 
effects on cardiovascular, immune, and brain function. Additional challenges include 
reconceptualizing the role of measurement in interventions, as well as reconceptualizing the 
measurements themselves (95). For example, a better understanding of existing signals (such 
as EEG or photoplethysmography) could lead to additional physiological insights about

sleep under real-world conditions and—within the home environment—could delineate how 
sleep trajectories change upon disease onset and progression, as well as during intervention 
attempts timed to different disease stages.

Opportunities

1) Sleep plays a fundamental role in human physiology. Knowledge about sleep can 
potentially improve pain management, chronic disease treatment, and cognitive outcomes 
in neurodegenerative disorders, along with coordinating drug bioavailability. For these 
indications and others, a new technology model can be envisioned for the bedroom as 
a treatment site within the home that becomes operational as we fall asleep. Applied 
sleep neuroscience should explore how sleep-wake rhythms can empower individuals to 
better respond to clinical interventions, as well as help individuals recover from each day’s 
pressures, thereby preparing them for tomorrow’s disease risk.

2) Sleep is associated with many aspects of mental and physical well-being. Although 
sleep is acknowledged as a major contributor to mental and physical health outcomes, 
this growing understanding has yet to be codified into NIH and other federal guidelines 
that would encourage clinical trial designers to incorporate sleep as a common variable of 
interest and to formalize the scheduling, col lection, and reporting of biosample collection 
with respect to time of day and an individual’s sleep phase. With such mandates in place 
along with open science practices, biomedical research could synthesize information from 
multiple levels of analysis to provide insights into the fundamental contributions of sleep to 
individual organ systems and emergent physiology, as well as how sleep modifies the course 
of disease and response to experimental treatments.

3) Sleep health itself is multidimensional. Many investigations concerning human sleep are 
limited by an overly narrow focus on sleep deprivation and primary sleep disorders, thus 
creating a false dichotomy between typical and atypical sleep. The very concept of sleep 
health, which moves beyond clinical disorders to emphasize the positive contributions of 
sleep to mental and physical well-being, suggests that all sleep gradations are relevant to 
health outcomes. To the extent that this is the case, each aspect of sleep can become a “lever 
arm” in neuroscience to perpetuate good health or improve disease-related outcomes.

4) Sleep health may represent a pathway for reducing health disparities. Structural barriers, 
working independently or collectively, are known to have adverse effects on sleep, with 
likely effects on mental and physical health outcomes that enhance racial and ethnic 
disparities in health care. Reductions in health disparities may be aided with community-
level engagement, investments in social services, and data-driven policies that (i) increase 
awareness of the importance of sleep, (ii) create greater vigilance for primary sleep 
disorders, and (iii) encourage discussion of sleep problems with medical professionals. 
Public campaigns such as these offer the opportunity for sleep neuroscience to make a 
tangible difference in the day-to-day lives of people in greatest need of help.

5) Sleep is becoming easier and less expensive to assess in the real world. The evolution 
of sleep measurement outside the confines of the laboratory presents many opportunities to 
harness an individual’s own data in the service of personalized medical approaches that can

improve the ease with which a person’s sleep is conceptualized in relation to their health. 
Artificial intelligence and other big-data analytics can also examine sleep at the cohort or 
population scale, thus improving the availability and utility of data gathered across multiple 
naturalistic contexts (104).

Conclusion

Future neuroscience research on sleep health presents challenges and opportunities that 
will be difficult to untangle. For instance, many social-environmental determinants of sleep 
health are not presently considered by medical professionals when placing an individual’s 
sleep in context in the clinic, thus creating ambiguity as to whether sleep differences are 
the product of disease or reflect the aggregated circumstances of the individual (e.g., age, 
race, gender, socioeconomic status, work and home environment). Moreover, although sleep 
is acknowledged in the scientific literature as making decisive contributions to normal 
and abnormal physiology, it has yet to be standardized in clinical trial design. Perhaps 
nowhere is this more salient than in AD trials, which exemplify lost opportunities to 
benchmark the effects of amyloid-lowering drugs with respect to a person’s previous and 
recent sleep history. Similar lost opportunities may be realized (in hindsight) for other 
medical conditions. In the present Review, we have attempted to itemize the core aspects 
of sleep health, describe the social-environmental determinants that contribute to each, 
and summarize how sleep ultimately factors into cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, 
mental, cognitive, and behavioral health. Along the way, we have pointed out areas of 
inquiry in neuroscience with the potential to accelerate the translation of sleep research from 
the lab to clinical practice. From distinguishing sleep states in single cells to understanding 
the genetics of sleep health, as well as from creating coherent translational bridges 
between lab animal and human sleep to creating credible and accessible sleep tracking 
technology in the home environment, neuroscience will be pivotal for integrating sleep 
health considerations into how we diagnose, monitor, treat, and test interventions for human 
brain disorders and other diseases. With any luck, the “chimera” of sleep can ultimately be 
leveraged at multiple interconnected levels to improve the mind and body of the individual, 
the collective well-being of society, and the essentially valuable parts of human existence.

Sleep health in context

There are several dimensions to sleep health, such as regularity, satisfaction, alertness, 
timing, efficiency, and duration. Alone and in combination, these dimensions interact 
with many aspects of our general health, including cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, 
mental, behavioral, and cognitive health. Interactions between sleep and health are further 
shaped by individual- and social-level factors operating within larger societal factors. All 
occur in the context of the day-night cycle.

Fig. 1. Social-ecological model of sleep health.
The right side of the image, which depicts a sleeping person, reinforces the importance 
of situational context in sleep physiology (94). The external environment is shown as 
a dawn-to-dusk transition, reinforcing the importance of day-night circadian context in 
sleep physiology (6). Health outcomes associated with sleep—cardiovascular health (23), 
metabolic health (31), immune health (38), mental health (39), behavioral health (24), 
and cognitive health (50)—are listed. On the left side of the image, the levels of the 
social-ecological model are depicted. Individual-level factors that influence sleep include 
age (58), genetics (105), sex and gender (69), beliefs (94), feelings and attitudes (94), race 
and ethnicity (78), and behaviors (94). These are embedded within social-level factors, 
which include neighborhood (88), work and occupation (84), family and home (101), culture 
(80), social networks (90), socioeconomics (76), and safety and security (89). These factors 
are further embedded within those at the societal level, such as such as technology (95), 
globalization (94), racism and discrimination (93), public policy (91), geography (92), the 
physical environment (94), and “24/7” society (83).
