Introduction. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term disorder significantly impairing the somatic, emotional, and psychological
functioning of its sufferers. Previous research has shown that affected individuals are characterized by an increased level of anxiety
and depression. Currently, there are two main treatment schemes for RA; the first uses anti-inflammatory drugs, and the second
utilizes biologic agents. This begs the question whether sufferers differ in intensities of pain, anxiety, and depression depending on
the type of treatment and what the determinants of these affective states in patients treated using different methods are. Methods. The
study comprised 85 patients affected by RA (including 57 receiving biologically inactive medication). Research participants filled out
a set of questionnaires measuring levels of anxiety and depression, intensity of experienced pain, strategies of coping with pain, and
ego resiliency. Results. The collected data was analyzed through intergroup comparisons, calculating simple correlation coefficients,
developing and solving regression equations. The results imply that the choice of treatment differentiates the intensity of pain
experienced by patients. Those receiving biologic agents reported lower levels of pain compared to those taking anti-inflammatory
medication. It has also been noted that there are distinct configurations of conditions conducive to anxiety and depression in both
anti-inflammatory and biologic agent groups. Discussion. The observed constellation of dependencies between variables indicates
that the choice of treatment scheme differentiates pain levels. This confirms the assumption that pain intensity, coping strategies,
and ego resiliency depend on the severity of anxiety and depression.

1. Introduction

Chronic illness is indicated by the World Health Organization
as the leading cause of premature death in the world.
According to WHO’s estimates, it is responsible for 63% of all
fatalities [1]. Chronic illness is defined by its slow progression
and long duration, two traits which force patients to adapt to
new, changed circumstances, and which affect most aspects
of life, usually negatively, consequently significantly lowering
health-related quality of life [2].

One chronic illness severely altering its sufferers’ ability
to function is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is the most com-
mon rheumatic disorder among connective tissue disorders.
It is a persistent, progressive inflammatory process beginning
in the synovial membrane, leading to the deformation and
destruction of articular tissues, and the impairment of artic-
ulatory function [3]. Typical age of onset is between 40 and 60
years and incidence is 3 to 4 times higher in women than in
men. A person affected by rheumatoid arthritis experiences
numerous somatic problems, such as the deformation and

2

deterioration of joints, chronic pain, fatigue, weight loss,
and fever. Besides these, the sufferer must also deal with
psychological hardships, primarily marked by negative affect:
anxiety, depression, feelings of loss, and social difficulties
related to changes in fulfilling social roles [4].

The theoretical approach based on which we can under-
stand the processes of adaptation to chronic disease is the
Transactional Model of Stress and Coping [5]. This approach
assumes that a stress transaction is a complex process in
which a number of consecutive phases can be distinguished:
the occurrence of an event, its cognitive evaluation, dealing
with its consequences. Additionally, the stress transaction
process is modified by the available resources [6]. In this
perspective, resources act as a mediator between the different
stages of a stress transaction. For example, due to its high
mental resilience, a person is able to flexibly adjust coping
strategies to the requirements of the situation [7]. In the
proposed study, we investigated coping (coping with pain),
resources (ego-resilience), and consequences (pain, depres-
sion, and anxiety).

A basic problem that RA patients must cope with is pain.
As the disorder advances, pain levels usually increase [8].
The unpredictability of pain is one trait disrupting well-being;
patients cannot predict the end of an ongoing episode of pain
nor the onset of another one. This negatively impacts the
sufferers’ emotional state and greatly increases their negative
affect.

Among the psychological consequences of RA, in the
foreground are changes in the sufferer’s emotional
life,
considered an effect of pain and growing impairment [9].
Individuals affected by RA experience anxiety and depressive
symptoms to a greater degree than the general population.
It is estimated that between 14% and 62% of those afflicted
with RA also suffer from depression [10–14]. Its occurrence is
explained through either neuroimmunobiological or psycho-
logical mechanisms. The neuroimmunobiological hypothesis
points to proinflammatory cytokines, responsible for dis-
rupting the serotoninergic system, as playing the dominant
role in the development of depressive symptoms [15]. The
psychological approach, on the other hand, assumes that
increasing impairment resulting from gradual deterioration
of joint function causes feelings of helplessness, powerless-
ness, and worthlessness, which contribute to the emergence
and persistence of depressive symptoms.

Research on the consequences of depression in RA
patients indicates that individuals exhibiting complex depres-
sive symptoms are more susceptible to repeated recurrence of
intense pain [16–18]. Experiencing depressive symptoms fur-
ther hinders coping and living with illness, which manifests as
frequent hospitalizations and medical appointments among
other things [19]. The question remains open whether a lower
mood and exhibiting symptoms of depression are antecedents
sensitizing to pain, or consequences of pain [20]. Research
results are inconclusive. A two-way dependency is described:
on one side, the level of depression makes it possible to
predict the degree of future physical and psychological
impairment; on the other, physical limits caused by illness
are predictors of future depression levels [21]. As such, the
dependencies have the properties of a vicious cycle.

Another emotional state typical for RA is anxiety. The
proportion of individuals with an increased level of anx-
iety stands between 21% and 70% of sufferers [13]. Some
researchers suggest that symptoms of anxiety surpass depres-
sion levels in this group [22, 23]. Frequently, the sufferer fears
a relapse of illness accompanied by intense pain. In many
cases, this fear escalates into panic. Since fear and anxiety
function as motivators to avoid threatening circumstances
[24], this may lead sufferers to avoid any situations where
pain could be exacerbated, especially those connected with
professional or everyday activity [25].

Using the transactional model of stress [5, 26], potential
determinants of anxiety and depression are the intensity of
pain (specific element of the stressful life event), strategies
for coping with pain, and ego resiliency. RA sufferers face the
necessity of managing many hardships and problems caused
by the disorder, the most important including experiencing
pain, limited mobility, and uncertainty as to the disorder’s
further development. Among these challenges, pain probably
disrupts the sufferer’s everyday life to the highest degree;
hence one of the most commonly posed research questions
regarding this group is how they cope with pain and how
their coping strategies influence their functioning. Therefore,
it becomes essential to isolate specific coping strategies, which
provide affected individuals with the greatest relief from pain
[27].

One classification of strategies of coping with pain was
proposed by Rosenstiel and Keefe [28]. They distinguished
seven strategies: diverting attention, reinterpreting pain sen-
sations, catastrophizing, ignoring pain sensations, praying
and hoping, coping self-statements, and increasing activity
levels. The strategies are assigned to three factors: cognitive
coping and suppression, diverting attention and substitute
activities, and catastrophizing.

Ego resiliency is another potentially significant condition.
It is the individual’s ability to adapt their level of control
over internal impulses to the requirements of the current
situation [29]. Ego resiliency is considered to be one of the
most important positive strategies for adapting to stressful
situations, as it is assigned the role of managing coping strat-
egy choice [11, 30]. In the context of illness, individuals with
a high level of ego resiliency use more effective (compared to
low-resiliency individuals) crisis-coping techniques; they are
therefore more capable of balancing the positive and negative
emotions that they experience and exhibit a higher overall
degree of self-control. A relationship between ego saliency
and a tendency to choose strategies involving active coping
has also been noted, which translates into increased efficacy
and feelings of agency.

The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is not fully
identified. RA is treated as an autoimmune disorder, wherein
white blood cells attack the organism’s own tissues. This
process manifests in the presence of immune complexes in
the synovial fluid, synthesized with the involvement of the
rheumatoid factor (RF), that is, antibodies against IgG. It is
assumed that the rheumatoid factor initiates and maintains
the inflammatory process in joints, though how and why it
starts and sustains the course of illness remains an unknown.

One popular hypothesis is that of viruses or bacteria trigger-
ing [31, 32].

Because the primary cause of rheumatoid arthritis has
not been discovered, treatment is symptomatic. The goal of
pharmacological therapy is to halt the progress of disease
and so induce remission. The drugs used over the course of
RA largely have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, or immuno-
suppressive properties. They can modify the course of the
underlying condition (most desirable) or merely ease the
symptom-related pain, providing relief to patients. There
are two basic groups of medication. The first are anal-
gesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, including nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticosteroids
(GCs). The second are drugs modifying the course of the
including biologically active substances. Biologic
illness,
agents are currently the newest and most advanced form of
treatment. They are characterized by a decidedly increased
efficacy compared to nonbiologic drugs, as they can more
effectively thwart the organism’s immunological response,
leading to remissions which last several years.

Because there are currently two main methods of
pharmacologically treating RA,
i.e., using either anti-
inflammatory or biologically active drugs, an interesting
question arises: does the pharmacotherapy used differentiate
patients’ pain and levels of anxiety and depression? Addi-
tionally, is the level of anxiety and depression determined by
a different configuration of psychological variables?

2. Methods

2.1. Study Participants. 85 rheumatoid arthritis patients hos-
pitalized on rheumatoid wards took part in the study. They
were aged between 29 and 76 (M=48.94; SD=14.31). An
average of 14.86 years has passed since the initial diagnosis
(SD=9.31). Women, numbering at 68 (80%), dominated the
research group which is consistent with epidemiological data.
The participants were treated using biologic agents (57 partic-
ipants, 67.1%) and standard anti-inflammatory drugs (28 par-
ticipants, 32.9%). A difference in age has been noted between
the treatment groups (MB =45.32; SDB=13.74; MNB=56.32;
SDNB=12.70; t= -3.55; p<0.001; Cohen’s d= 0.83), which was
expected, as biological treatment is suggested for younger
patients. However, no difference was noted in illness dura-
tion (MB=14.35; SDB=8.28; MNB=15.87; SDNB=11.24; t=0.70;
p=0.484) nor in gender (womenNB 25 (29.21%); menNB 3
2
=2.250;
(3.53%); womenB 43 (50.56%); menB 14 (16.50%); chi
p=0.134).

The study was anonymous and voluntary. It used a
questionnaire method. Patients filled out a set of four ques-
tionnaires, including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) [33], the Ego-Resiliency Scale by Block &
Kremen [34]; Polish adaptation: Kaczmarek [30], The Pain
Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) [28], and Visual
Analogue Scale [35]. The basic descriptive statistics of the
variables measured and the reliability factors are collected in
Table 1.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [33]: it
is made up of two independent subscales, estimating the
intensity of anxiety and depression. The scale consists of 14

statements (e.g., “I look forward with enjoyment to things),
7 regarding anxiety and 7 regarding depression. The study
participants respond to each statement by choosing one of
four possible answers (e.g., 0 as much as I ever did; 1 rather
less than I used to; 2 definitely less than I used to; 2 hardly at
all).

The Ego-Resiliency Scale by Block & Kremen [34]; Polish
adaptation: Kaczmarek [30]: the scale is comprised of 14 items
measuring the level of resiliency (e.g., I like to take different
paths to familiar places). Participants estimate how much each
statement applies to them and choose the most appropriate
response on a four-point scale, where 1 indicates it does not
apply at all and 4 indicates it applies very strongly.

The Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) by Rosen-
stiel & Keefe; Polish adaptation: Juczy´nski [34]: the scale
consists of 42 statements describing different ways of coping
with pain, connected with 7 strategies: diverting attention,
reinterpreting pain sensations, catastrophizing, ignoring pain
sensations, praying and hoping, coping self-statements, and
increasing activity levels. Participants respond using a seven-
point scale marking frequency of undertaking the described
action, whose extremes are 0 never do and 7 always do
that (e.g., I don’t think about the pain). Due to the large
number of measured coping strategies, in order to conduct
detailed analyses the strategies were reduced to three general
factors isolated by the method’s authors: cognitive coping
and suppression, diverting attention and substitute activities,
catastrophizing and hoping.

A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) [33] was used to measure
the intensity of pain. Patients estimated what intensity of pain
they felt during the day and at night using two 10-point scales.
They marked the appropriate pain level on a horizontal 10-
centimeter-long line marking the space between 1 no pain and
10 worst pain imaginable.

3. Results

The first step in the analysis was to determine whether RA
patients in biological and nonbiological treatments differ in
the intensity of pain and levels of anxiety and depression
they experience. The choice was motivated by the fact that
pain is one of the most troubling physical symptoms of
RA, while anxiety and depression are the most disruptive
psychologically. To this end, intergroup comparisons were
carried out using Student’s t-test (see Table 2).

The analysis showed that patients undergoing biological
treatment exhibited lower pain levels compared to patients
treated using standard methods. They were characterized
not just by lower overall pain levels, but also lower night
and daytime pain. The value of Cohen’s d suggests that the
observed differences are high.

The second stage of analysis was to ascertain the deter-
minants of anxiety and depression for biological and non-
biological treatment groups, separately for each group. This
was done in two ways: through calculating simple corre-
lation coefficients for the measured variables and through
developing and solving regression equations. Anxiety and
depression were placed on the dependent variable side of
the regression equation, while the independent variables

through diverting attention.

3.1. Determinants of Depression in Patients Undergoing Biolog-
ical and Nonbiological Treatments. The analysis of depression
correlates for biological and nonbiological treatments indi-
cates that there are different factors for either group. Among
patients treated using biologic agents, depression levels are
related to three variables. They correlate positively with
overall (r=.27; p=.043) and daytime pain (r=.28; p=.036),
as well as with ego resiliency (r=-.39; p=.002). For patients
in the nonbiological treatment group, depression correlates
with four variables: positively with daytime (r=.39; p=.039)
and nighttime pain (r=.46; p=.013), but negatively with ego
resiliency (r=-.44; p=.020) and cognitive coping strategies
(r=-.49; p=.008) (Table 3).

Two of the variables under consideration turned out to
be significant for both treatment groups: overall pain and ego
resiliency. Upon comparison, their correlation coefficients
appear similar (pain level z=.57; p=.028; ego resiliency z=.52;
p=.030) (Table 3).

Solving the regression equation for the biological treat-
ment group pointed to the importance of two variables: ego
resiliency (𝛽=-.41; p<.001) and daytime pain levels (𝛽=.30;
p=.014). These two variables combined account for 22% of
the variance of depression (F=8.72
). For patients in the
nonbiological treatment group, cognitive (𝛽=-.43; p=.011) and
nighttime pain (𝛽=.40; p=.018) were significant, accounting
for 35% of the variance of depression (F=8.24

).

3.2. Determinants of Anxiety in Patients Undergoing Biological
and Nonbiological Treatments. Calculating correlation coeffi-
cients made it possible to identify four variables determining
the level of anxiety in patients treated with biologic agents.
Positive correlations were found for overall pain (r=.41;
p=.001), as well as its daytime (r=.35; p=.008) and nighttime
(r=.42; p=.001) components. Negative correlations, on the
other hand, were found for cognitive coping strategies (r=-
.33; p=.012) (Table 4).

Among patients treated with nonbiological therapies,
anxiety was determined by only one variable: daytime pain
(r=.41; p=.032). Experiencing daytime pain turned out to be
the only anxiety predicate shared by both treatment groups
(z=.27; p=.039) (Table 4).

Solving the regression equation for the biological treat-
ment group pointed to the importance of three variables:
daytime pain (𝛽=.36; p=.003), cognitive coping strategies
(𝛽=-.41; p<.001), and coping through catastrophizing (𝛽=.26;
p=.038). This set of three variables accounts for 31% of
anxiety variance (F=9.53
). For patients in the nonbiological
treatment group, only daytime pain proved significant (𝛽=-
.41; p=.032), accounting for 13% of anxiety variance (F=5.14∗)
(Table 5).

4. Discussion

The first conclusion that can be drawn from the analyses
relates to differences found in pain experienced by patients
treated with biologic agents and anti-inflammatory drugs.
Analysis results showed that patients receiving biologic

agents experience lower levels of pain, both during the day
and at night. The noted differences were strong. This shows
that using biologically active medication alleviates one of the
main symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, pain, which lets it
be assumed that a deferred consequence may be a decrease
in depressive symptoms. This assumption is founded on the
observation made by Zautra and collaborators [19], who
noted that different affective systems were linked to different
RA symptoms (pain or impairment). In patients for whom the
dominating symptom was pain, an increase in its level leads
to an increase in negative affect, without any effect on positive
affect. Therefore, using biologic agents should mitigate the
vicious cycle mechanism over time. Based on research, the
mechanism can be expected to run as follows: pain, appear-
ance of negative affect (primarily depressive symptoms),
difficulties in everyday activities including treatment-related
activities, which exacerbates the pain. Disrupting this process
with an effective form of treatment (biologic agents) which
lowers pain levels allows speculation that in the long term,
levels of depression will also be lowered and effective function
will be increased. The pain experience results indicate which
patient group is exposed to greater severity of pain. The
results indicate an increased risk group, which should be a

premise to prioritise specialist pain management in patients
treated with the standard method (anti-inflammatory drugs).
No differences were noted, however, between patients
in biological and nonbiological treatment groups regarding
their levels of negative affect, anxiety, and depression. This
may be related to the study taking place during the treatment
process, while changes in mood could be delayed. As such,
it has been suggested that future studies on the topic be
longitudinal in nature. A different analysis approach may also
be considered; namely, the dependency between pain and
negative affect could be moderated by the time passed since
initiating biological treatment.

The second explored issue dealt with indicators of anxiety
and depression in the two treatment groups. A low pain
level, personality traits, and strategies of coping with pain
were considered potentially beneficial in adapting to chronic
illness [11, 36].

It is assumed that pain, one of the most distressing
symptoms of RA, has critical influence over the experience
of negative emotions, anxiety, and depression. This thesis
has been confirmed in previous research [10]. In the current
study, the intensity of pain increased the likelihood of a high
degree of anxiety and depression both in patients receiving

biologic agents and anti-inflammatory drugs. The time at
which pain was experienced differentiated the groups, how-
ever. For patients treated biologically, pain felt during sleep
predicted anxiety, while daytime pain predicted depression.
In the anti-inflammatory treatment group, the relationship
was inverted;
i.e., daytime pain predicted anxiety, while
nighttime pain predicted depression.

Ego resiliency, understood as a set of subjective properties
governing the ability to flexibly adapt the level of self-control
to existing circumstances [29], was taken to be a personality
trait pertinent to functioning effectively. The assumption is
that it gives sufferers the ability to flexibly choose strategies
for coping with pain while taking into account the demands
of illness. Previous research has shown that ego resiliency is
a key factor in activating positive emotions in difficult situ-
ations [37]. The current study aimed to investigate whether
ego resiliency has a protective function against negative affect,
but the resulting framework of dependencies confirmed
this hypothesis only partially. The correlation coefficients
obtained confirmed dependencies between ego resiliency
and anxiety and depression. However, ego resiliency only
demonstrated protective properties against depression in
the biological treatment group. Why the variable’s positive
characteristics only manifested in this group of patients is
unknown. The result is made surprising by the fact that
previous research on ego resiliency indicated a clear positive
role in inducing positive emotional states; it was reasonable
to expect resiliency to be a protective factor. Since the present
study aimed to describe dependencies between ego resiliency
it may be suspected that
and negative emotional states,
different psychological processes are responsible for arousing
negative and positive emotions in the context of a chronic
condition. The question of ego resiliency’s role in the process
of activating negative emotions remains open.

Strategies of coping with pain were the third factor
considered as a potential determinant of anxiety and depres-
sion. Coping is defined as the individual’s efforts to manage
arising demands [27]. Previous work has shown that using
strategies focused on avoiding and resigning from activity
mediate between perceived symptoms of illness and the
level of consequent disability and mental disorders [38].
These strategies are linked to a higher risk of developing
depression and an increase in the subjective experience of
pain, especially in the long-term duration of illness. On
the other hand, strategies such as seeking information or
support contribute to a higher level of positive affect and
better adjustment to illness in RA patients [39]. The present

study found that using cognitive coping strategies lowers the
likelihood of depression occurring in patients treated with
anti-inflammatory drugs and anxiety in patients receiving
biologic agents. It was also observed that in the latter group
coping through catastrophizing increases anxiety levels. This
constellation of dependencies is in line with previous findings
[4].

The analysis of relationships between variables showed
that the strongest protective function against symptoms is
provided ego-resilience and cognitive coping. Probably the
role of mental resilience is related to the characteristics of
rheumatoid arthritis, which is a very changeable condition. It
is not clear which group of strategies for dealing with anxiety
and depression symptoms will be effective at a particular stage
of the disease, so it is important to be able to adapt to changing
conditions, including the flexible use of those strategies. For
these reasons, it seems particularly important to develop
mental resilience in this group of patients, regardless of the
chosen treatment method. Moreover, it seems worthwhile to
design and conduct experimental studies in which patients
will develop resistance as a result of psychological interven-
tions and check whether its development will help to reduce
the symptoms of the disease.

Despite their scientific value, our research has a number
of limitations that need to be taken into account when
interpreting the results. The limitations of the studies are that
they were conducted on a very specific group of hospitalized
patients. This implies that the results of the study can only
be applied to a group of patients with acute symptoms of
rheumatoid arthritis. In future studies, analyses should also
be carried out on other groups of patients, i.e., outpatient
clinics. In addition, patients were treated as a homogeneous
group in regard to the severity of the disease. In future
studies, it would be worth taking into account the severity
of the disease estimated, e.g., by means of the DAS—Disease
Activity Score—a scale for assessing the level of activity of
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. As well as check if the
disease activity interacts with the other variables studied.
