Child Development
Problems of Discipline. Authority and Rebellion

J. P. KAHN, M.D., San Francisco

THE EARLY EXPERIENCES of a child have a decisive
influence upon the kind of person he will grow up
to be. Paramount among these is the discipline and
authority to which the child is exposed, designed to
enable him to conform to the demands of society
and group living.

The purpose of this presentation is to discuss
broadly the problems of discipline, authority, and
rebellion, as they exist in our culture, as well as
some of the determinants of their origins, develop-
ment and derivatives as they impinge on the child
in his striving toward adult independence, maturity
and socialization. Authority is something that en-
velops us from a very early age, first in the form
of parents, and later in parent substitutes like
teachers. We experience it also in social, cultural
and legal pressures. The word itself for many of us
has unpleasant associations.

The first demands made on a child are from his
parents and the family as a whole. But society, too,
molds the child from birth on. This is because the
parents apply the educational patterns of the society
they live in. In their own personalities, they repre-
sent the character of their society or class. They
transmit to the child the spirit and values of a group
by being representatives of that group. In this sense,
the family is the authoritative agent of society.
Society, however, itself contributes to the aggressions
and confusions which parents face in children and
in themselves. One reason for this is that society
produces for its children one set of values in school,
home and church, and another set in the competitive
world they face outside.

For most children, the discipline associated with
bowel control is the first discipline to which they
are exposed. The child reacts to this as a limitation
of the freedom which he has previously known-
which of course, it is.

Eliminations and the regularization of them pre-
sent the child with life tasks that may create per-
sistent needs. It is easy to forget what a profound
physiological disturbance this whole business of
bowel and bladder training imposes on the child.
The physiological processes of elimination are ex-

* It is only through the love and approval of the
significant adults in a child's life that he is able
to give up his primitive behavior for that which
meets the demands of social living. Conflict over
authority is only one of many conflicts. There
are conflicts which arise inherently in a child's
development. The task of the parents in the ed-
ucation of the child in our society is to enable
the child to tolerate a certain amount of frustra-
tion and also a necessary degree of control of
impulses so that he can live in a group and in
conformity with the required standards.

Increased rebelliousness and defiance are nor-
mally characteristic of certain periods of devel-
opment in healthy children. These are when con-
certed discipline begins, and in early adoles-
cence. But other events also may reactivate or
stimulate attitudes of defiance and rebellion.
Even in his rebellion, a child needs and expects
his parents to stand for order, as well as for love.
He expects that the parent will save him from
the consequences of his own destructive impulses,
which he as yet may not have the strength to
withstand.

Deep-seated or submerged factors in the par-
ents may play a significant role in the discipline
to which they subject their children. True per-
missiveness means allowing a child to develop
according to his own rate of speed and his own
potentialities as a unique individual. It includes
refusing the child any type of behavior that will
bring danger to him or to others.

A parent who uses harsh and rigid forms of
discipline may force a child into submission,
rather than acceptance and understanding. This
produces only surface conformity which hides
insecurity and violent underlying destructive-
ness.

tremely well organized, so that automatically the
muscle sphincters of the bladder and the rectum
respond to accumulated pressure within. When toilet
training begins, the child is asked to surrender this
physiological autonomy. Instead of functioning in
accordance with his needs, he is asked to inhibit the
sphincter muscle response to pressure, responding
instead to an external stimulus-vessel, place, and
so on-presented by the parent or other adult. More-
over, he is asked to respond at a fixed time-not
infrequently whether he needs to or not. In this
training, the child is expected to subordinate his
processes to outside events and times, giving up his
own body autonomy, often months before he is

CALIFORNIA MEDICINE

sufficiently mature to make such an adjustment.
Maturity does not mean chronological age, or weight
or size; it means that the child has had enough of
an activity, such as sucking or unrestricted elimina-
tion, to be able to go on to something else without
a persistent feeling of deprivation or an unsatisfied
infantile longing.

The way the child adjusts to this first discipline
will be important for the attitudes and behavior
toward authority that he has in later childhood and
adult life.

His reaction to this discipline and his willingness
to submit to this limitation will depend in great
measure on his relationship with his parents. It will
depend on how he feels about them and on how
important the continuation of their affection and
approval is to him. It will depend on whether he
feels that what the parents are asking from him is
right and reasonable and for his own good. The
emotional tone or attitude of the parents is the im-
portant thing, not their actions, for the child will
react to the tone or attitude and will feel any tense-
ness or overemphasis or dislike in the parent's voice
and handling. The importance of the manner and
tone of voice lies in the child's feeling that he is
being deprived by this training. Any anger or im-
patience then may become an occasion for him of
anxiety and feelings of guilt.

Many adults may carry over from their own child-
hood a feeling of anxiety or disgust at feces, so that
they are not able 'to treat the child under their care
without emotional strain when faced with this
process, which for the child is entirely normal, and
unconnected with unpleasant emotions, until adult
interference begins.

The child's reaction to this discipline will depend
also on whether his body growth at the time the
demand is made has advanced sufficiently for him
to be able to comply. If training demands are made
before the first year, the child's muscular control is
just not yet ready for this task. Demands that cannot
be met will simply result in frustration for both
child and parent. So there will usually be some
hostility and rebellion, open or hidden, to this first
demand for control, but most children will emerge
from this first experience in discipline-that of
bowel control-feeling that their sacrifices in attain-
ing control have been well repaid by the parents'
approval.

A child who does not have parental affection, or
on whom the demands are made prematurely, feels
outraged and cheated at having to give up part of
his freedom without getting anything in return.

Of course, children can be taught to conform
under fear of punishment, but learning through
fear is not economical; since it brings no pleasure,
the child relapses easily or fails completely.

The effects of training a child too early or too
severely are seen regularly in both the pediatric and
psychiatric clinics.

Constipation, diarrhea and other intestinal com-
plaints are the psychosomatic illnesses that may be
induced by interferences with this phase of growth.
Stubbornness is a common result of the parents'
efforts to force their will on the child; this sometimes
develops even to the point of the child's not talking;
of his being verbally constipated. Or the child may
be made unduly anxious over dirtiness and become
a slave to cleanliness for the rest of his life. Or he
may become so preoccupied with his body functions
that there is no psychic energy left for a productive
life.

During this stage of growth and development the
mother, who was at first only the good indulgent
provider, has to become the interpreter of society's
demands. This means she must not continue to give
in to the child's primitive wishes. She must frustrate
him to an extent, to be a good mother.

Consciousness of the excretory functions presents
the child with a dilemma. As was previously men-
tioned, the child has none of the feeling of revulsion
for his excreta which the adult has developed. This
is a learned reaction. To the child, his stool is part
of him-something he has produced, his own cre-
ation. The odor, texture and color are not unpleasant
to him. He prizes it. His mother's attitude has made
him believe that she also prizes it. She implies this
by her pleasure when he has a bowel movement and
by her concern when he fails to do so. This is even
more pronounced when toilet training actually
begins.

The mother's behavior is confusing. She asks for
the gift; praises him for giving it, as if it were highly
prized, and then proceeds to flush it down the toilet.
Now if a woman asked her husband for a diamond
necklace and then when her husband gave it to her
as a proof of his love, she treated it in a similar
fashion, the husband's anger and surprise would be
considered justified. To the child, the mother's atti-
tude toward his bowel product is just as confusing.
Sometimes the child will indicate this concern by
throwing toys and other objects into the toilet and
then try to retrieve them, as if he were trying to
solve the riddle by finding whether it is possible that
this apparent disappearance of the object might not
actually be a matter of its being stored away, to be
retrieved at will.

His control over his bowels is significant to the
child from another angle. It is dramatic evidence
of his increased power. He is now in a position
where he can either give or withhold. This gives him
a realistic sense of his own strength. With this ca-
pacity to control his excreta, the child has a tool
for direct attack upon the parent, and thus a means

VOL. 86. NO. 5 * MAY 1957

315

of expressing his hostility. Many parents express
such eagerness to have toilet training completed that
the child recognizes that at last he has found the
parent's Achilles heel.

As was mentioned, the confusions of this
period may be manifested in different ways. A child
may develop pronounced constipation. One child
had no bowel movement at all for two weeks. When
placed upon the toilet, he would say: "I won't give
it to you! I won't! Go away! " A child may refuse
to comply with a schedule. He will not urinate or
pass a stool as long as he is on the toilet but will soil
himself immediately afterward. He may hide the
feces, or smear it. He may develop diarrhea, so that
the movements are beyond his control. There may
be many reasons for this kind of behavior. The child
may not understand what is wanted by the parent.
He may be trying to avoid the destructive attitude
the parent manifests toward the "gift" by withhold-
ing his feces, or hiding it in secret places. He may
be unable to give up the narcissistic gratification
the product of his creation offers. He may be ex-
pressing hostility toward the parents, which may
have its origin in the requirements of toilet training
per se, or the parent may be asking him to forego
too many other primitive pleasures at the same time,
thus arousing a defensive anger in the child. Per-
haps the entire emotional relationship with the par-
ent has been frustrating to the child, as. a result of
which he is hostile. Maybe the child for some reason
is not willing to relinquish the helpless state of
infancy, and is therefore resistant to taking over
the responsibility of controlling his behavior. Maybe
the child would rather be powerful than loved. The
point of all this is that because of the physical and
emotional demands of this period, it is not infre-
quently a confused and angry- and stubborn and
resistant period, with temper tantrums and general
behavior indicative of rebellion, and difficulty in
conforming to parental demands. Even in yielding,
a child may repress his mounting anger toward a
parent who demands what the child does not wish
to give, but what he dares not refuse.

In any event it is, significantly, during this phase
of development, when demands are first made on the
child, that an attitude to authority is formed. It is
during this stage that- the roots are laid down from
which develop the child's later attitudes and re-
sponses to discipline ,and authority, even to those
of his adult life. The reaction continues in later
life as an attitude to anyone or anything which
makes demands of him.

In learning bowel control, and also in learning
concomitantly control in other areas, the child
grows and can accept limitations only through his

316

relationships with adults. It is only through their
love and approval that he is able to give up his
primitive behavior for that which meets the de-
mands of social living. If the love is real enough and
strong enough, and the discipline used by the parents
fair and just, the child does grow. He gives up his
untempered behavior and accepts the social need for
conforming, to a reasonable degree. We see, then,
how discipline starts tind an attitude to authority is
significantly influenced by the social need for con-
trolling a physiologic function.

In our culture, the final authority figure is almost
always a man. It can be a priest, a soldier, a judge
or a president. In the family, however, the first
authority is the mother. It is she who does the dis-
ciplining in the early years. When the child is able
to use and understand language, the father then
usually comes in as a disciplinarian. The mother
will say, "I will tell your father when he comes
home." This becomes more frequent as the child gets
older. Gradually, the father comes to supersede the
mother as the one who administers discipline. When
the child is around three or four years old, the father
becomes quite important in matters of discipline
and authority. By that time, all the early feelings
and reactions of the child toward the first authority,
the mother, are transferred to him. So we see that
the figure of the male authority has behind it the
more primary one of the mother. All the defiance,
rebelliousness and resistance originally was directed
toward the mother in her attempts to make a social
being of the child. It is interesting to see that, in
journalism and the movies, there is a great deal of
acknowledgment of the partially hidden female be-
hind the figure of the male authority. For example,
we are always interested in knowing about the
mothers and wives of our presidents.

s a child grows, he is increasingly sub-
jected to' the socializing process. This is necessary
if he is to be able to live in a social group. The
demands of the socializing process make it inevi-
table that his parents will frustrate the child in a
number of areas. There are many things he cannot
be allowed to do. This is both for his benefit and the
benefit of others. The child will react to this with
hostility, aggression and rebellion, just as he did
earlier. A conflict may arise because of the child's
fear that the expression of these feelings will cause
him to lose his parents' love. Because of this reaction
in their children, some parents may feel anxious at
limiting their behavior. But frustration is a very
relative thing. There are unavoidable frustrations
without which nobody would grow up to be a social
human being. There are also frustrations imposed
through false values by parents.

Discipline, of course, should be for the child's
sake, not for the discipline's sake. It is;well known
that the things learned first and earliest are the
most important and the longest retained. Since
parents are the first authorities in the life of the
child, the way they handle the problems of disci-
pline are of crucial importance in the later attitude
of the child toward authority. As the child gets
older and the authority of the parents is replaced
by that of teachers, bosses, political leaders and so
on, the attitude toward authority learned from the
parents will largely determine his reaction to these
others.

The way a parent presents the issue is important.
Was it explained to the child and was he included
in the issue, or did it appear to him as unintelligible,
arbitrary and overwhelming? Did the parent say:
We are doing this or we are asking this because
we are concerned about you? Or did he just say to
the child: This is the way it is! Was the discipline
based on a rigid set of conventional rules or were
the parents guided by the desire to help the child in
his attempts to grow up? Was the discipline handled
as a force outside of the child, to which he must sub-
mit? Or was it an understandable, assimilable dis-
cipline, inviting the cooperation of the child?

Children can stand a great deal of frustration as
long as they are, sure of their parents' love and as
long as they understand somewhat the reasons for
the discipline. As, long as the discipline has a real
purpose behind it, which includes the benefit of the
child, perhaps it need not necessarily lead to undue
aggression, or only to minimal aggression. But al-
most invariably, children will react to a limitation
of their freedom with a certain amount of hostility
and aggression expressed in one way or another.

Parents should not blame themselves for all the
defiance, rebellion or other difficulties of their chil-
dren. For one thing, parents have had their own
pgrehts, who have significantly shaped their char-
acter structure, including the way they react to and
handle their children. The concept of blame is
neither realistic nor fruitful. An erroneous conclu-
sion is that if a child were properly brought up, he
would have no emotional difficulties. But conflict
over authority is only one of many conflicts. There
are conflicts which arise inherently in a child's
development. For parents to understand these con-
flicts may be a help in tolerating their children's
difficulties. This understanding may ease the guilt
of parents who feel responsible for their children's
troubles. It may enable them to deal more wisely
with transient problems and so lessen the risk of
the child's rebellion and defiance turning into settled
attitudes.

Childhood is a time of growing and becoming.
There are no shortcuts in growth. Certain changes

VOL. 86. NO. 5 * MAY 1997

have to be lived through by children-and by par-
ents. Knowing this and accepting it makes it easier
-sometimes-for parents to live through periods
when children can be extremely exasperating. While
it is not possible to give parents a blueprint that
would tell them how to handle each specific problem
in a specific way, we can give to parents and educa-
tors a basic understanding of the child's emotional
struggles and a dynamic orientation toward the prob-
lem of discipline. The task of the parents in the
education of the child in our society is to enable the
child to tolerate a certain amount of frustration and
also a necessary degree of control of impulses so
that the child can live in a group and in conformity
with the required standards. Parents who them-
selves do not accept and are unwilling to conform
with the standards of our society are unable to
achieve this in their children. Particularly difficult
for the child is a situation where each parent takes
a different attitude. In such a case the child behaves
as if pulled all the time in opposite directions.

At all times, it is well to remember that every child

is an individual and proceeds at his own pace.

All children at one time or another and in one
way or another are rebellious and defiant. Some
children are decidedly so throughout the whole of
their development. It becomes their characteristic
way of responding to all adults and authorities. The
extremes of this are delinquent children and habitual
adult criminals.

Increased rebelliousness and defiance
are normally characteristic of certain periods of de-
velopment in healthy children. These develop in the
second and third years of life when concerted disci-
pline begins, and in early adolescence. But other
events also may reactivate or stimulate attitudes of
defiance and rebellion. Circumstances which cannot
be helped may cause increased resistance to au-
thority. Examples are financial trouble in the family,
the birth of a new baby, the illness or death of a
loved adult. Merely being the oldest or the youngest
child may contribute to resentments and frustrations,
leading to increased rebellion. An example may be
an older child who is expected to devote too much
time to his younger brothers and sisters, or a younger
child who has to submit to the authority of an older
brother, as well as to the parents. The interplay of
different children in the same family may enhance
the normal tendency to rebelliousness. The particular
child may not be able to solve the problem in any
other way than by this increased rebelliousness.
Because children of the same family are different.
and because they do have different meanings for
their parents, jealousy between them does exist and
may be manifested by rebellion.

317

There are underlying motives common to all re-
bellion, but there are also many individual mean-
ings. Rebellion may be used to deny the existence
of authority. An example is the small child who
blithely contradicts everything his mother or father
may say. At all times, defiance and rebellion may
be used to see what one can get away with; what
the limits really are. An ordinary example is that
of the small child who refuses to go to bed at his
usual time. He is trying to see just how late his
parents will let him stay up if they are pressed.

Rebellion is also a means of bringing upon him-
self the punishment that the child secretly feels he
deserves because of the bad thoughts he has. An
example of this would be the destructive wishes
aroused in a child by jealousy of a brother or sister.
The child feels a need to confess; to bring to the
notice of the parents these bad wishes, which to him
may be identical with the bad deed. Under this kind
of stress, the child can feel at ease only if he is sure
that his parents know the danger they or others are
in from his secret submerged unacceptable thoughts.
This need to confess is one of the motives in the
small boy for using profane words or, at a later
age, for compulsive stealing or destruction of a kind
that is bound to be found out.

Rebellion may also be a defense against the fear
of parents and other persons. Much of the small
child's defiance springs from a need to test his
parents; to see whether they are what he fears them
to be in his imagination. He wants to know what
they will do to him if he actually does become
destructive and hostile. A child who destroys his
favorite toy may do so because of his need to find
out just what his parents will do to him. He wants
to know the worst.

Rebellion and defiance may even be used as a
defense against all the anxieties which go along with
feelings of love. It may be a safety device, directed
against a feeling of too great closeness to the parent
of the opposite sex. The fear of the adolescent re-
garding his rivalry with his father may lead him to
turn away from home in defiance and rebellion. The
little girl's rivalry with her mother may cause her
to be rebellious and difficult.

Most of these defenses exist in everyone, but their
roots may be more or less deep-seated. Deepest of all
in every person are the anxieties arising from the
first and primary relation with the mother-from
the need and desire for food and love. The infant's
needs for affection and nourishment are intense, and
the two are indistinguishable to him. He is afraid
of losing them. This is the same for him as losing
the mother. This is the first anxiety a human feels.
Some feeding difficulties, for example, may be due
to the child's fear that his taking in food will
diminish the supply of affection and nourishment.

318

It is possible for a fear like this to lead to all kinds
of rebellious, obstinate behavior.

Parents will react in different ways to a child's
difficult behavior, but it is well to remember that
even in his rebellion, a child needs and expects his
parents to stand for order, as well as for love. He
will be bewildered and frightened by a parent who,
perhaps as a reaction against his own upbringing,
indulges the child's lawlessness under the guise of
permissiveness. What the child expects is that the
parent will save him from himself; from the conse-
quences of his own destructive impulses, which he
as yet may not have the strength to withstand.

The other part of this attitude in parents appears
as a subtle but major resistance to gentle or per-
missive discipline on their part. It is the fear that
any liberal attitude toward the child will permit him
to get out of hand. But in fact permissiveness in-
cludes refusing the child any type of behavior that
will bring danger to him or to others. Usually par-
ents who were themselves dominated in their child-
hood will have a need to discipline their children in
a rigid fashion. Parents may see in their child their
own struggle against the unjustness of rigid author-
ity. They had to submerge their resentment against
their own parents which was caused by severe dis-
cipline. So they subject their own child, as they were
subjected, to strict policing. We see, then, that deep-
seated or submerged factors in the parents may
play a significant role in the discipline to which they
subject their children.

here may be times when all parents use
fear or other coercion in shaping their children's
conduct. All may find themselves in positions in
which they threaten and scold, bribe and punish.
This is mostly not good. But there is no reason to
expect parents to be perfect. There are, however,
better ways than fear and coercion. If a child loves
his parents, he will, without even thinking about it,
want to please them, and he will do many things
because doing them wins approval. Gradually he
will learn that these things please him too, and he
will do them for that reason. In time, the parents'
standards will become the child's and it will be his
own developing conscience that guides him.

When all is said and done, whatever devices are
used to get obedience, to enforce discipline, are
pretty unimportant compared to the attitude brought
to bear on the situation. The general attitude, or
feeling-tone in the family is extremely important.
Competitiveness and perfectionism and unreasonable
expectations interfere with permissiveness. Permis-
siveness means allowing a child to develop according
to his own rate of speed and his own possibilities.
It means that the parents realize that he is a unique

CALIFORNIA MEDICINE

individual. But because, as we have said, allowing
a child to get out of hand is frightening to him,
it is important for a parent to maintain authority-
the authority of a person who loves him; who is
just; who the child can see is just; the authority
of a person who is fair with him; honest with him;
understanding of him. For a parent's secure au-
thority is the rock on which for a long time the
child must lean.

A parent who uses harsh and rigid
discipline may force a child into submission, rather
than acceptance and understanding. Such parents
are seen by the child simultaneously as the pro-
viders of one's physical needs and also as capricious,
usually inconsistent arbiters of punishment. The
relationship between such a parent and the child
will usually be lacking in genuine affection. The
pressure to conform to parental authority makes it
difficult for the child to express his aggressive and
other instinctual forces in a constructive fashion.
The result of this sort of background in a child
may lead to a personality which is both narrow and
rigid. A person like this cannot give love because
he received little. And it is unlikely that he can give
of himself in any other creative activities. For this
to be different, more affection and more guidance
on the part of the parents is needed. Since the child
of harsh and rigid parents gets neither affection nor
guidance, he often may be either too inhibited, or
delinquent. These are opposite sides of the same
coin. The delinquent person has not acquired enough
internalized controls to limit his aggressive feelings
to a socially acceptable degree. The inhibited person
is so afraid of his feelings breaking loose that he
keeps a rigid clamp on them, usually by denying
their existence. Sometimes they break loose anyway.
The example that comes to mind is the parson in
Somerset Maugham's Sadie Thompson.

The necessary internalized controls can occur only
as a result of a good relationship between a child
and his parents. The child hears his parents' voices
I won't love you if you do.
saying: Don't do it;
Because the child loves his parents and because
their love is important to him, he pays attention and
accepts the limitations. As he grows older, the child
says these words to himself-even in the absence of
the parents. This is how the conscience grows and
this is what we mean by conscience. At an extreme
level, there may be a failure to develop any con-
science at all. In this case, we have an asocial,
destructive person. In psychiatry, we know this kind
of person as the psychopath. He is the individual
who cannot delay the pleasures of immediate grati-
fication and lives only for the moment. He has no
built-in restraints.

VOL. 86, NO. 5 * MAY 1957

We can go further in examining the developing
personality structure. The child with harsh and
rigid parents may take over their attitude toward
power and control. He has their basic contempt for
the allegedly inferior and weak. This of course is
but a reflection of his parent's attitude toward him.
He feels hostile himself because of his early experi-
ences, and has come to expect from others what he
has learned from his parents-that they will be un-
kind and frightening. His real attitude toward life
is one of fear, and his approach to people, therefore,
will be to exploit them for his own ends. A child
who is forced into an apparent submission to paren-
tal authority will develop hostility and aggression
to an excessive degree. These feelings will be poorly
directed. The feeling of hatred is frequently attached
to minority and other unpopular groups. A child
who does not have to submit to stern authority does
not need to assert his strength against those who
are weaker. The child who is forced into fearful
submission develops into a punishing person. This
mirrors the kind of discipline to which he himself
was exposed. As he grows into an adult, he has a
rigid attitude because this keeps his rage and in-
security under control.

Much of the feelings that originated in the rela.
tionship of the child to a harsh, rigid parent are
covered up over the years, but may show up in
violent opinions about say, political leaders or
foreign countries, which may fulfill his need for a
whipping boy. People like this distort even factual
knowledge. It is for this reason that information
per se does not necessarily lead to greater tolerance.
Rigid discipline can sometimes be masked. Some-
one has said that children learn to walk so that they
can walk away. This is as it should be. But there
are parents who seem to be concerned and sensitive
to their children's needs, when actually this hides
a determination to control them and to keep them
always children. The child may be given everything
-except the right to grow up, to develop to the
point where he can be free and independent, can
walk away. The result here, too, will be a fear of
authority. Authority to the child will imply being
caught and blocked in his desire for growth.

From the standpoint of society, a child's attitude
toward authority is an extremely important problem.
As we can see, forced submission to authority pro-
duces only surface conformity which hides insecurity
and violent underlying destructiveness. This is dan-
gerous to the very society to which there seems to
be this conformity.

In contrast to this fearful person, the child with
permissive, affectionate, unthreatening parents will
have a permissive and trusting attitude toward
others. He will look at the world as friendly, rather

319

than dangerous. He will expect affection from
others, and will be less interested in acquiring power
over them. He can give affection because he has
received it. He fears punishment and retaliation
less. He is better able to identify with the aims of
the society in which he lives. He has the help of his
parents in working out the problems of sex and
aggression. Because of this, he is able to use his
energies for creative and socially useful purposes.
He is more flexible and sees people as individuals
rather than types. As a result he is less prejudiced.

He is able to express disagreement with his parents
in an open fashion. This results in a much greater
degree of independence from them and from authori-
ties in general. Such a child is far more likely to
develop into a person with the qualities we think
of as belonging to a mature person. Such a person
will be able to love and to work productively. He
