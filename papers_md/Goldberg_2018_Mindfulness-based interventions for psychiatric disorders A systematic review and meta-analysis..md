Abstract

Despite widespread scientific and popular interest in mindfulness-based interventions, questions 
regarding the empirical status of these treatments remain. We sought to examine the efficacy of 
mindfulness-based interventions for clinical populations on disorder-specific symptoms. To 
address the question of relative efficacy, we coded the strength of the comparison group into five 
categories: no treatment, minimal treatment, non-specific active control, specific active control, 
and evidence-based treatment. A total of 142 non-overlapping samples and 12,005 participants 
were included. At post-treatment, mindfulness-based interventions were superior to no treatment 
(d = 0.55), minimal treatment (d = 0.37), non-specific active controls (d = 0.35), and specific 
active controls (d = 0.23). Mindfulness conditions did not differ from evidence-based treatments (d 
= −0.004). At follow-up, mindfulness-based interventions were superior to no treatment conditions 
(d = 0.50), non-specific active controls (d = 0.52), and specific active controls (d = 0.29).

Mindfulness conditions did not differ from minimal treatment conditions (d = 0.38) and evidence-
based treatments (d = 0.09). Effects on specific disorder subgroups showed the most consistent 
evidence in support of mindfulness for depression, pain conditions, smoking, and addictive 
disorders. Results support the notion that mindfulness-based interventions hold promise as 
evidence-based treatments.

Keywords

mindfulness; meditation; meta-analysis; psychiatric disorders; relative efficacy; evidence-based 
treatments

Mindfulness-based interventions have experienced a marked increase in scientific and 
popular interest in the past two decades. Recent commentaries have, however, raised 
questions regarding the evidence base for this family of therapies. Farias, Wikholm, and 
Delmonte (2016) voiced several concerns, particularly the use of non-active control 
conditions (i.e., waitlist controls) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mindfulness 
therapies along with a lack of specificity regarding outcomes that these treatments may or 
may not impact. Others have questioned the degree to which selective reporting of results 
may introduce systematic bias into the literature, thereby overstating the efficacy of 
mindfulness-based interventions (Coronado-Montoya et al., 2016).

One recent meta-analysis estimated the effects of meditation-based interventions (including 
mindfulness as well as other meditative techniques) compared to active control conditions 
that, analogous to placebos in pharmaceutical trials, provide non-specific treatment 
ingredients (e.g., expectancy; Goyal et al., 2014). While mindfulness meditation programs 
showed effects on anxiety, depression, and pain when compared with non-specific treatment 
controls, there was no evidence that these treatments were superior to specific active controls 
(i.e., other active treatments).

The current meta-analysis was intended to further interrogate the findings of Goyal et al. 
(2014). We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of RCTs examining the effects of 
mindfulness-based interventions on disorder-specific symptoms across psychiatric 
populations. Rather than restrict our sample to certain types of comparison conditions, we 
aimed to evaluate empirically the degree to which outcomes are influenced by the 
characteristics of the control group. A more nuanced comparison to type of control condition 
may provide clinicians important information regarding when a mindfulness intervention 
should be favored compared to other known interventions. While other comprehensive meta-
analyses have suggested that mindfulness-based interventions can impact clinical outcomes 
(e.g., anxiety, depression; Khoury et al., 2013), and several meta-analyses have examined the 
evidence for specific psychiatric conditions (e.g., Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity 
Disorder [ADHD]; Cairncross & Miller, 2016), no published comprehensive meta-analytic 
review has examined effects on disorder-specific symptoms across psychiatric conditions. 
Our study sought to examine: (1) the degree to which mindfulness-based interventions 
compare with a variety of control conditions, including treatments with established efficacy 
(i.e., evidence-based treatments); (2) for which specific disorders mindfulness-based 
interventions appear most efficacious, and (3) potential sources of bias.

Method

Eligibility Criteria

Page 3

We included all RCTs of mindfulness-based interventions for adult patients with psychiatric 
diagnoses for which there are evidence-based treatments per the American Psychological 
Association’s (APA, 2017) Division 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology; see Supplemental 
Materials Table 1a). To be eligible, samples had to have either a formal diagnosis or elevated 
symptoms of a given disorder (i.e., above a given cut-off on a symptom inventory, e.g., score 
greater than five on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, score greater than 13 on the Beck 
Depression Inventory – II; Asl, & Barahmand, 2014; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996; Black, 
O’Reilly, Olmstead, Breen, & Irwin, 2015; Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 
1989). Samples receiving treatment within a facility focused on a specific disorder (e.g., 
substance abuse treatment) were included. Elevated stress levels alone were not considered 
to reflect a clinical condition.

To qualify, interventions had to have mindfulness meditation as a core component with home 
meditation practice as a treatment ingredient. While interventions combining mindfulness 
with other modalities (e.g., mindfulness and cognitive techniques as in Mindfulness-Based 
Cognitive Therapy [MBCT]; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002) were included, therapies 
emphasizing the attitudinal stance of mindfulness (rather than the formal practice of 
mindfulness meditation) were excluded (e.g., Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [ACT], 
Dialectical Behavior Therapy [DBT]; Hayes, Strosahl, & Wilson, 1999; Linehan, 1993). 
Other forms of meditation (e.g., mantram repetition) were excluded. Interventions had to be 
delivered in real time (i.e., not provided exclusively through video instruction or smartphone 
app) and had to include more than one session (to allow for home meditation practice). 
Studies were also excluded for the following reasons: (1) not published in a peer-reviewed 
journal in English; (2) not a peer-reviewed article; (3) data unavailable to compute 
standardized effect sizes; (4) no disorder-specific (i.e., targeted) outcomes reported; (5) data 
redundant with other included studies; (6) no non-mindfulness-based intervention or 
condition included.

Information Sources

This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) Standards (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group, 
2009). We searched the four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science) and a 
publically available comprehensive repository of mindfulness studies (Black, 2012). 
Citations from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews were also reviewed. Citations 
were included from the first available date (i.e., 1966) until January 2nd, 2017.

Search

We used the search terms “mindfulness” and “random*”. When a database allowed, we 
restricted our search to clinical trials.

Study Selection

Page 4

Titles and/or abstracts of potential studies were independently coded by the first author and a 
second co-author. Disagreements were discussed with the senior author until a consensus 
was reached.

Data Collection Process

Standardized spreadsheets were developed for coding both study-level and effect size-level 
data. Doctoral-level coders were trained by the first author through coding an initial sample 
of studies (k = 10) in order to achieve reliability. Data were extracted independently by the 
first author and a second co-author. Disagreements were discussed with the senior author. 
Inter-rater reliabilities were in the good to excellent range (i.e., ks and ICCs > .60; Cicchetti, 
1994). When sufficient data for computing standardized effect sizes were unavailable, study 
authors were contacted.

Data Items

Along with data necessary for computing standardized effect sizes, the following data were 
extracted: (1) publication year; (2) disorder; (3) intent-to-treat (ITT) sample size; (4) 
whether an ITT analysis was reported; (5) whether a non-self-report measure was included; 
(6) sample demographics (mean age, percentage female, percentage non-Caucasian race, 
percentage with some college education); (7) country of origin; (8) standardized mindfulness 
intervention on which mindfulness condition was based; (9) whether treatment time was 
matched between mindfulness and control condition; (10) quality of the control condition. 
Quality of the control condition was assessed based on a five-tier system with non-
overlapping categories. These included: (1) no treatment (in which the control condition 
received no intervention beyond that which was provided to the treatment condition); (2) 
minimal treatment (very brief or minimal intensity interventions, e.g., five- to 10-minute 
individual counseling sessions for smoking cessation; Vidrine et al., 2016); (3) non-specific 
active control (active conditions in which no mechanism of change or clear rationale for 
treatment was provided, e.g., discussing air travel, shopping, and past residences; Helmes & 
Ward, 2017); (4) specific active control (contained specific therapeutic mechanisms, has a 
theoretical/treatment rationale, e.g., Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy; 
Chavooshi, Mohammadkhani, & Dolatshahee, 2016; Wampold et al., 1997); (5) evidence-
based treatment (EBT, e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia; Garland et al., 2014). 
Comparison treatments were coded as EBTs if they were identified by APA Division 126 as 
an EBT for that particular disorder, or if they were promoted as a first-line treatment by a 
similarly relevant organization (e.g., smoking cessation treatment promoted by the American 
Lung Association, cognitive-behavioral therapy promoted by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse).

Risk of Bias in Individual Studies

Considerations for minimizing bias in individual studies were drawn from both Jadad’s 
criteria as well as the GRADE system (Atkins et al., 2004; Jadad et al., 1996). Based on the 
GRADE recommendation to select relevant study characteristics to quantify (Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality, 2014) and based on the large number of potential study

characteristics for assessing quality in psychotherapy trials, (e.g., n = 185 quality criteria; 
Liebherz, Schmidt, & Rabung, 2016), we restricted our analysis to randomized trials, 
employed intent-to-treat samples (when available), and coded the strength of the comparison 
condition (as described above), whether an ITT analysis was reported (e.g., using multiple 
imputation, last observation carried forward, or conservative assumptions regarding 
outcomes for participants who dropped out of the study [e.g., smoking relapse; Davis et al., 
2014]), and whether a non-self-report outcome was included (e.g., biologically-confirmed 
abstinence, clinician-rated diagnostic status; Davis et al., 2014; Teasdale et al., 2000).

Summary Measures

Our primary effect size measure was the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d). As done 
by Goyal et al. (2014), we first computed a pre-post effect size for both the mindfulness and 
non-mindfulness groups alone. This method has the advantage of accounting for potential 
baseline differences (i.e., it does not rely exclusively on between-group differences at post-
test; Becker, 1988). We then calculated the relative difference in the pre-post effects (i.e., 
change scores) using standard methods (Becker, 1988), including controlling for a small 
known bias in d (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009). Analyses were conducted using the R 
statistical software and the ‘metafor’ and ‘MAd’ packages (Del Re & Hoyt, 2010; 
Viechtbauer, 2010). Cohen’s d was computed both from pre- to post-treatment (or time point 
closest to post-treatment) as well as from pre- to last available follow-up time point. Random 
effects models were used.

Synthesis of Results

When available, effect sizes were computed using pre- and post-test means and standard 
deviations (SD). Other reported statistics (e.g., F, t, p, odds ratios) were used when 
appropriate based on standard meta-analytic methods (Cooper et al., 2009). Data were 
aggregated first within-studies (i.e., across disorder-specific outcomes within a given study) 
using the ‘MAd’ package and then between studies, based on the comparison of interest 
using restricted maximum likelihood random effects analyses. Summary statistics were 
computed in Cohen’s d units along with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was 
systematically assessed using the I2 (measuring the proportion of between-study 
heterogeneity) and the Q-statistic (assessing whether between-study heterogeneity exceeds 
that expected by chance alone).

To answer the question of the degree to which mindfulness-based interventions demonstrate 
relative efficacy with other comparison group types, summary results were first aggregated 
across studies employing a given comparison condition type (e.g., specific active control 
conditions). Although this involved pooling outcomes across a variety of disorders, we 
believe this analysis most directly examines the degree to which mindfulness-based 
interventions compare, on average, with various control group types, including other active 
therapies and evidence-based treatments. Then, in order to examine relative efficacy at the 
disorder level, studies that shared a given comparison type (e.g., no treatment controls) and a 
given disorder (e.g., depression) were analyzed separately. In order to more efficiently and 
reliably summarize results, specific conditions with similar core features were collapsed 
(e.g., anxiety disorders, addictive disorders). Disorder categories were based on the

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). We employed the recommended convention of requiring at least four 
studies within a subgroup for moderator and subgroup analyses (Fu et al., 2011).

Some studies included multiple control groups (k = 22, e.g., Bowen et al., 2014), comorbid 
diagnoses (k = 5, e.g., depression and pain; De Jong et al., 2016), or both (k = 1, e.g., Zautra 
et al., 2008). We attempted to code and analyze these studies in ways that allowed their data 
to be most fully characterized (this was deemed preferable to ignoring data from either 
multiple control groups or on comorbid disorders). Specifically, when multiple control 
groups were included, data from the mindfulness conditions were replicated to allow a 
representation of the unique comparison with each control group. For samples with 
comorbid conditions, separate effect sizes were included for each disorder. In order to assess 
potential bias introduced by this, sensitivity analyses were run excluding multiple 
comparison groups (only the most rigorous of the comparison groups was retained in these 
analyses) and excluding outcomes on comorbid conditions (only one of the two comorbid 
conditions was retained in these analyses).

Risk of Bias Across Studies

We assessed publication bias by visually inspecting funnel plots for asymmetry within the 
comparison of interest and by re-estimating models using trim-and-fill methods that account 
for the asymmetric distribution of studies around an omnibus effect (Viechtbauer, 2010). In 
addition, we ran models within comparison condition assessing whether various features of 
study quality (i.e., based on Jadad and GRADE guidelines; Atkins et al., 2004; Jadad et al., 
1996) were related to outcome. These features included for whether an ITT analysis was 
reported, whether non-self-report measures were included, and whether treatment time was 
matched between the mindfulness and the comparison conditions.

Results

Study Selection

A total of 9,067 citations were retrieved. After 3,485 duplicates were removed, 5,582 unique 
titles and/or abstracts were coded. Following the application of the exclusion criteria (see 
PRISMA flow diagram in Figure 1), 171 studies were retained for analysis representing 142 
independent samples, 172 unique comparisons (some studies included multiple comparison 
groups and comorbid samples), and 12,005 participants. Included studies were published 
between 2000 and 2016.

Study Characteristics

The aggregate effect size (d) and other study characteristics for each study are shown in 
Supplemental Materials. The sample was on average 43.63 years old, 64.38% female, with 
61.27% having some post-secondary education. The largest percentage of trials was 
conducted in the United States (44.44%). The largest proportion of studies used no treatment 
comparison conditions (52.10%). The most commonly studied disorder was depression 
(30.41%; see Supplemental Materials Figure 1a). The majority of studies included a follow-

up assessment time point (k = 79, 55.63%). For studies with a follow-up assessment, the 
average follow-up length post-treatment was 6.43 months (SD = 5.36, range = one to 24).

Risk of Bias Within Studies

All included studies used randomized designs. A minority of comparisons (41.32%) 
matched treatment time between the mindfulness and control conditions. Approximately half 
of the studies reported at least one ITT analysis (54.86%) and included at least one non-self-
report measure (48.61%).

Results of Individual Studies

For each included study, treatment effects on disorder-specific outcomes and confidence 
intervals are reported in Supplemental Materials Table 2a. All included outcome measures 
for each study is listed in Supplemental Materials Table 3a.

Synthesis of Results

Effects at post-treatment—As expected, type of control condition was a significant 
moderator of effects at post-treatment (Q[4] = 51.59, P<.001; Figure 2). Mindfulness-based 
interventions were shown to be superior to no treatment conditions (k = 89, d = 0.55 95% CI 
0.47 to 0.63), minimal treatment conditions (k = 4, d = 0.37 95% CI 0.03 to 0.71), non-
specific treatment conditions (k = 9, d = 0.35 95% CI 0.09 to 0.62), and specific treatment 
conditions (k = 42, d = 0.23 95% CI 0.12 to 0.34). Mindfulness-based interventions did not 
differ from EBTs (k = 28, d = −0.004 95% CI −0.15 to 0.14). Within each comparison 
significant heterogeneity was detected, with the exception of minimal treatment 
comparisons.

Disorder type was next examined as a moderator of effects for studies using the same 
comparison conditions. Disorders were included in this analysis if at least four trials 
employing a given comparison condition were available (Fu et al., 2011). For studies using a 
no treatment comparison, disorder was not a significant moderator (Q[5] = 10.86, p = .054). 
Mindfulness-based interventions showed superior effects on disorder-specific outcomes for 
anxiety, depression, pain, schizophrenia, and weight/eating-related disorders, with ds 
ranging from 0.45 to 0.89 (Figure 3); addictions were the exception (d = 0.35 95% CI −0.06 
to 0.76). Sufficient studies were not available for minimal treatment or non-specific 
treatment comparison types. For specific active control conditions, disorder was not a 
significant moderator (Q[3] = 4.84, p = .305). Mindfulness-based interventions were 
superior to the comparison group for depression and addiction (ds = 0.27 to 0.38) and 
equivalent to the comparison group for anxiety, pain, and weight/eating (ds = 0.03 to 0.15). 
When compared with EBTs, disorder was a significant moderator (Q[2] = 14.51, p = .001). 
Mindfulness-based interventions were superior to EBTs for smoking (d = 0.42) and 
equivalent to EBTs for anxiety and depression (ds = −0.01 to −0.18).

Effects at longest follow-up—At follow-up, type of control condition was a significant 
moderator of effects (Q[4] = 9.85, p = .043; Figure 4). Mindfulness-based interventions were 
shown to be superior to no treatment conditions (k = 37, d = 0.50 95% CI 0.36 to 0.65), 
nonspecific treatment conditions (k = 4, d = 0.52 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99), and specific active

controls (k = 29, d = 0.29 95% CI 0.13 to 0.45). Mindfulness-based interventions did not 
differ statistically from minimal treatment conditions (k = 4, d = 0.38 95% CI −0.05 to 0.82) 
and EBTs (k = 15, d = 0.09 95% CI −0.14 to 0.33). Within each comparison, significant 
heterogeneity was detected (Figure 4), with the exception of the minimal treatment 
comparisons.

Disorder type was again examined as a moderator of effects for studies using the same 
comparison conditions. For studies using a no treatment comparison, disorder was a 
significant moderator (Q[2] = 6.46, p = .040). Mindfulness-based interventions showed 
superior effects for depression, pain, and schizophrenia, with ds ranging from 0.48 to 1.18 
(Figure 5). Sufficient studies were not available for minimal treatment or non-specific 
treatment comparison types. For specific active control conditions, disorder was not a 
significant moderator (Q[3] = 1.22, p = .748). Mindfulness-based interventions were 
superior to the comparison group for depression (d = 0.35) and equivalent to the comparison 
group for addictions, pain, and weight/eating (ds = 0.18 to 0.38). Mindfulness-based 
interventions were equivalent to EBTs for depression (d = 0.04).

Sensitivity Analyses

A series of sensitivity analyses examined the potential impact of duplicating data from 
portions of the sample in order to allow for multiple comparison groups and/or multiple 
disorder-specific outcomes to be fully represented. Results from these models are reported in 
Supplementary Materials and are summarized here. When excluding multiple comparison 
groups at post-treatment, insufficient studies were available to estimate minimal treatment 
comparisons or effects on weight/eating for no treatment comparisons. All significance tests 
remained unchanged, with the exception of effects on addiction for specific active control 
comparisons, which became non-significant, although the effect size increased slightly (ds = 
0.27 95% CI 0.02 to 0.53 and 0.29 95% CI −0.04 to 0.62, for multiple comparisons included 
and excluded, respectively). When excluding multiple groups at follow-up, insufficient 
studies were available to estimate minimal treatment comparisons and non-specific 
treatment comparisons. Insufficient studies were available for estimating effects on 
schizophrenia for no treatment comparisons and effects on addiction for specific active 
controls. All remaining significance tests were unchanged.

For models excluding multiple disorders, the significance tests for all analyses remained 
unchanged with the exception of studies of depression using specific active controls at 
follow-up which became non-significant (ds = 0.35 95% CI 0.04 to 0.67 and 0.15 95% CI 
−0.13 to 0.44, for multiple disorders included and excluded respectively).

Risk of Bias Across Studies

Asymmetric funnel plots suggested evidence for publication bias for several analyses (see 
Supplemental Materials Figures 2a to 7a), with trim-and-fill analyses resulting in modified 
effect size estimates. Of note, the statistical significance of all estimates remained 
unchanged, with the exception of no treatment comparisons for schizophrenia at longest 
follow-up, which was no longer significant. Neither reporting ITT analyses, including non-
self-report outcomes, nor matching treatment time between mindfulness and comparison

conditions predicted outcomes when examined within comparison type significantly 
moderated effects at post-treatment or follow-up (all ps > 0.05, see Supplemental Materials 
Table 7a), with one exception: studies using non-specific active controls and reporting 
objective outcomes had significantly lower effects at follow-up (d = 0.25) relative to those 
not using objective outcomes (d = 1.34, Q[1] = 10.08, p = .002).

Discussion

Several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. At the most basic level, our results 
suggest that there is an empirical basis for mindfulness-based therapies. Mindfulness 
treatments were shown, in general, to be of similar potency with first-line psychological (and 
psychiatric) interventions when compared directly and superior to other active comparison 
conditions (as well as waitlist control conditions), with relatively little variation across 
disorders. These effects were generally robust to accounting for publication bias, study 
quality features, and in sensitivity analyses that restricted our sample to one comparison per 
study. This finding supports continued research exploring the clinical application of 
mindfulness therapies and provides a basis for consideration of these treatments by medical 
providers.

The promising effects demonstrated on psychiatric symptoms in the included studies are 
consistent with several other symptom- or disorder-specific meta-analytic reviews (e.g., 
Cairncross & Miller, 2016; Khoury et al., 2013; Khoury, Lecomte, Gaudiano, & Paquin, 
2013; Piet & Hougaard, 2011) as well as with a comprehensive review in child and 
adolescent samples (Zoogman, Goldberg, Hoyt, & Miller, 2015). The magnitude of the 
effect sizes detected in the current study (e.g., d = 0.55 for mindfulness versus no treatment 
comparison conditions at post-treatment) suggests that mindfulness-based interventions are, 
on average, associated with moderate drops in psychiatric symptoms (based on Cohen’s 
[1988] guidelines). Interestingly, our findings diverge from those of Goyal et al. (2014) who 
reported no differences between mindfulness conditions and specific active control 
conditions. This discrepancy may be due to the current meta-analysis including only 
disorder-specific symptoms and increased statistical power to detect difference through 
including a larger number of trials and examining effects at the level of comparison 
condition type (i.e., not only disaggregated by disorder).

This is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to examine effects of mindfulness-based 
interventions on symptoms specific to clinical disorders. In addition, we have attempted to 
grade the strength of comparison conditions to rigorously examine the relative efficacy of 
mindfulness-based interventions compared not only to no treatment but also to other active 
treatments that may be recommended. We believe that this method addresses the primary 
question facing clinicians who may be themselves providing or considering recommending 
mindfulness-based therapies: How do mindfulness interventions compare with other 
evidence-based treatments?

Our sample included a wide range of psychiatric conditions with behavioral therapies known 
to be efficacious. Overall, mindfulness therapies were superior to no treatment, minimal 
treatment (at post-treatment), non-specific active controls (i.e., psychological placebo

groups), and specific active controls (i.e., other psychological treatments). Further, 
mindfulness-based interventions were on average not different from first-line, evidence-
based therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressant medications.

Subsequent analyses examined the relative performance of mindfulness-based interventions 
within categories of clinical conditions at post-treatment (e.g., anxiety disorders, addictive 
disorders). As analyses were restricted to comparisons that included at least four RCTs, only 
a subset of conditions could be assessed. The clearest evidence was found regarding the use 
of mindfulness for depression. Mindfulness was found to be superior to no treatment, other 
active therapies, and equivalent to EBTs. For pain and weight/eating, mindfulness performed 
on par with other active therapies and was superior to no treatment controls. For 
schizophrenia, mindfulness outperformed no treatment control conditions. For anxiety, 
mindfulness outperformed no treatment control conditions and was equivalent to other active 
therapies, including EBTs. For smoking, mindfulness outperformed EBTs. Effects on 
addictions varied. Mindfulness was equivalent to no treatment controls although superior to 
other active therapies. This apparently contradictory finding is likely due to the small 
number of studies examining addictive disorders using no treatment control groups (k = 5) 
along with the small sample size included in this particular group of studies (mean n = 29.8) 
which yielded a wide confidence interval for this effect size estimate. Examination of effect 
sizes at post-treatment shows the expectedly larger effect on addictions for no treatment 
comparisons (d = 0.35) than for specific active control conditions (d = 0.27), despite the 
contrasting significance tests.

At follow-up, results were similar, although not identical. In these analyses, mindfulness was 
no different than minimal treatment controls, again perhaps due to the small number of 
studies included in this group. Mindfulness was again superior to no treatment and specific 
active control comparisons, and equivalent to EBTs. For specific disorders, mindfulness 
outperformed no treatment comparisons for depression, pain, and schizophrenia (although 
not when accounting for publication bias), and was equivalent or superior to other active 
treatments for addictions, depression, pain, and weight/eating. When compared with EBTs 
for depression, mindfulness was equivalent.

It remains difficult, however, to make firm recommendations based on the literature 
regarding for which particular disorders these therapies hold most promise (Farias et al., 
2016). This is due to the heterogeneity in effects across disorders, the uneven distribution of 
studies across disorders, the relative scarcity of direct comparisons between mindfulness-
based therapies and other first-line treatments (a study design feature that may not be 
improving despite repeated concerns voiced in the literature; Goldberg et al., in press), and 
evidence of publication bias. Based on our findings, it appears that the strongest 
recommendation can be made for mindfulness treatments for depression with evidence also 
supporting the use of mindfulness for treating pain conditions, smoking, and addictive 
disorders.

The uneven distribution of studies across disorders and comparison types is a primary 
limitation of the current study. As is always the case with meta-analyses, we were limited by 
the published literature (and given the scope of the project focused exclusively on studies

published in peer-reviewed journals, i.e., did not include unpublished studies or 
dissertations), and therefore were unable to make firm conclusions regarding disorder groups 
that have received less research attention. In addition, for the purposes of generating reliable 
effect size estimates, related outcomes and related disorders were collapsed (e.g., pain 
intensity and pain functionality, obesity and eating disorders) which limited our ability to 
detect specific effects at the outcome and disorder level.

Several key questions for future research suggest themselves. One concerns the impact of 
practice duration. Insufficient data were available to include this in the meta-analysis but 
other basic research clearly indicates the importance of practice duration on basic biological 
measures (Wielgosz, Schuyler, Lutz, & Davidson, 2016). A second critical question is which 
individuals may be most benefited by mindfulness interventions? Are there certain 
individual difference characteristics that predict the magnitude of change with mindfulness 
interventions (Mascaro, Rilling, Negi, & Raison, 2013)? Again basic research underscores 
the importance of such individual differences. Collectively our findings underscore the 
potential promise of mindfulness-based interventions for psychiatric disorders.

We examined the relative efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions on 
clinical symptoms of psychiatric disorders.

142 randomized clinical trials were included, comprising 12,005 participants. 
Control conditions were coded as no treatment, minimal treatment, non-
specific active controls, specific active controls, and evidence-based 
treatments.

At post-treatment, mindfulness-based intervention were superior to no 
treatment, minimal treatment, non-specific active controls, and specific active 
controls, and equivalent to evidence-based treatments.

At follow-up, mindfulness-based interventions were superior to no treatment 
conditions, non-specific active controls, and specific active controls, and 
equivalent to minimal treatment and evidence-based treatments.

The most consistent evidence for mindfulness-based interventions was seen 
for depression, pain, smoking, and addictions.

Post-treatment effects on disorder-specific symptoms by comparison group and disorder. 
Comp = comparison group; k = number of disorder-specific comparisons; Tx n = 
mindfulness condition sample size; Cont n = comparison group sample size (note that total n 
is larger than the full sample size as some samples are represented in multiple comparisons); 
d = Cohen’s d effect size; Q = Q-statistic; Qp = p-value for Q-statistic; I2 = heterogeneity;
