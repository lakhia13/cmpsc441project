It can be hard to find time to relax. But if you can fit it into daily life, it can help if you feel stressed or worried. And it can allow you to refocus.

There are lots of different ways to relax. Try anything that feels right for you, when you can. If you can practise these techniques regularly, they often give more benefit.

This page covers:

- Take a moment to relax

- Try gentle physical activity

- Focus on your breathing

- Spend time in nature

- Connect with your senses

- Picture yourself somewhere calm

- Take a screen break

- Find support for your mental health

Watch our animation for 8 relaxation tips to help you look after your mental health and wellbeing.


## Take a moment to relax


Relaxation doesn't have to take up lots of time. It can help to step away from something stressful for a few minutes. Or take a moment away from your normal routines and thoughts.

Doing this can give you enough space and distance to feel calmer. For example, you could spend a few minutes reading a book or a magazine.

If you can take a longer break, you could watch a film, play with a pet or try out a new recipe, if these are possible for you.

Whatever you do to relax, try to find somewhere quiet and comfortable where you won't be interrupted, if you can.

- Somewhere comfortable to sit or lie down

- Space where you won't be interrupted

- Lie down or sit with your back straight and your feet on the floor. Close your eyes or focus on a spot in the distance.

- Start by clenching your toes as much as you can for a few seconds then releasing them. Notice the difference between the two feelings.

- Match this to your breathing. Tense your muscles as you take a deep breath in, and relax as you breathe out.

- Move up your body to your thighs, your stomach and all the way to your shoulders and hands, clenching and relaxing each muscle in turn. Take time to notice any parts of your body that feel tense, tight or tired. You can repeat if you still feel tense.

- Take a moment to relax, then slowly and gently begin to move. When you feel ready, you can stand up slowly.

The NHS's Every Mind Matters has anaudio guide to relaxing your body (Youtube link)if you would like someone to guide you through this exercise.


## Try gentle physical activity


Relaxation doesn't have to mean being still. Gentle physical activity can help you relax too.

- If you can, you could take a walk, going at your own pace. You might choose to go for a longer walk. But even a few minutes of walking could help you feel relaxed.

- Look for a class you'd like to try, such as yoga, pilates or gentle stretching.

- Try some seated exercises. You may be able to fit these into your day more easily if you're busy. Or you might prefer them if other types of exercise are more difficult or not possible. Visit theNHS page on sitting exercisesto learn more.

See our pages onphysical activity, exercise and mental healthfor more tips. There are also links to organisations that can help you to find a class or activity in your area.


## Focus on your breathing


Learning to breathe more deeply can help you feel calmer.

You'll get the most benefit if you regularly take time to focus on your breathing. But remember that you can do breathing exercises anywhere. And they only take a few minutes.

- Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed. Place your hand on your stomach – it should rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out.

- Count as you breathe. Start by counting '1, 2, 3, 4' as you breathe in and '1, 2, 3, 4' as you breathe out. Try to work out what's comfortable for you.

Visit theNHS page on breathing exercisesfor more information about this exercise.

Getting in touch with your creative side can help you feel more relaxed. You could try:

- Painting or drawing

- Playing a musical instrument

Try not to worry too much about the finished product. Just focus on enjoying yourself.

- Pencils, pens or crayons

- Sticky tape or masking tape to hold your paper down (optional)

- Make sure you're sitting comfortably with your feet firmly on the floor, your back straight and your shoulders relaxed.

- Take your paper and pencil, and draw a circle that fills most of the page. It doesn't have to be neat.

- Now keep drawing. You could keep going over the circle, or fill it with a pattern, but try not to let your pencil leave the page. Don't worry about creating a finished picture, just keep going.

- Take time to focus on what you're drawing. Focusing on these sensations can help to quieten your mind.

- Once you've done this for a few minutes, try using a different colour or pattern.

- If you're focusing too much on getting the pattern right, try using your other hand.

- If you find it hard to get started, try using a colouring book.

Being distracted by the music always kept me calm. I loved being able to be creative and let my feelings come out into song.


## Spend time in nature


Spending time outside and in green spaces can be great for your physical and mental health.

Take a walk in a green space if you can. Take time to notice any trees, flowers, plants and animals you see on the way.

You could also take part in conservation. This could be digging in your own garden or getting involved in a local green project. You can find outdoor activities to suit your level of mobility.

Our pages onnature and mental healthhave information about how to find projects in your area.

Just yourself and a green space. Try a local park, woodland, nature reserve or garden, if you can access these.

- Find a green space. When you get there, stop for a moment and take a deep breath.

- Start exploring slowly. Try not to focus on getting somewhere in particular. Really focus on any movement you make. If you're walking, notice which part of your foot touches the ground first, and feel the transfer of weight through your foot.

- Notice the ground underneath you. Is it grass or earth? Does the ground feel soft? What colours can you see?

- Think about the rest of your body. How are you holding your arms? Does the air on your face feel cold or warm?

- Listen to the sounds around you. Can you hear birdsong, or wind rustling through the leaves?

- If you can't go to a green space, try opening your window and noticing what's around you. Notice any clouds in the sky, or trees and plants you can see. Can you feel rain, wind or sun on your skin?

- You could try looking after a plant. Spend time focusing on its scent, shape and texture. Try touching some of the leaves or soil and focusing on how it feels.

Even on hard days I would notice the weight of my feet on the ground, whether my breath was shallow or deep, if my mind was full of catastrophe and worry, if I needed to get outside and walk.


## Connect with your senses


Connecting with your 5 senses can ground you in the present moment. This can help if you're starting to feel stressed, overwhelmed or panicked.

Try our exercise to notice what each of your senses is experiencing, and bring your mind into the present.

- Look around you and notice 5 things you can see. It could be a pen, a mark on the wall, or someone's shoes. You can name these in your head or out loud, or write them down.

- Name 4 things you can touch or feel around you. For example, your hair, your nose, the ground under your feet or the air on your skin.

- Name 3 things you can hear around you. This could be something outside, or your own breathing.

- Name 2 things you can smell around you. It doesn't have to be a strong smell, and you can take a short walk around to find something if you want to.

- Name 1 thing you can taste at the moment.

If you can't engage all your senses, just do the ones you can.


## Picture yourself somewhere calm


Sometimes, you might find yourself in a stressful or difficult situation. But your imagination can transport you somewhere calm, even if you can't physically get away. This could help you feel more relaxed.

- Think of somewhere relaxing and peaceful. You might choose a memory of somewhere you've been, or a place you've imagined.

- Close your eyes and think about the details of this place. What does it look like? What colours and shapes can you see? Can you hear any sounds? Is it warm or cool? Let your mind drift and your body relax.

If you struggle to do this activity yourself, you could try a guided exercise. There are lots available online.

Our page onfinding reliable mental health information onlinehas tips for finding safe online support.

Music can connect us to our emotions and distract us from worrying thoughts.

Listening to your favourite songs could help you relax. You could dance or sing along, or just close your eyes and enjoy.

Try to really listen to the music. Can you pick out different instruments? Can you hear a drum beat or a certain rhythm? Focus on the music, and let other thoughts fade away.


## Take a screen break


Technology can be great for helping you feel connected. But if you're using it a lot, it could make you feel more busy or stressed.

Taking a break can help you relax. Even if it's only for a short time.

- Try turning your phone off for an hour, if you can.

- Step away from screens or have an evening where you don't check emails or social networks. Use the time to do something relaxing. You could try some of the ideas on this page.

- Turning your phone off while you do relaxation exercises will help to make sure you're not disturbed.

Visit our page oftips to get a good online/offline balancefor more ideas.
