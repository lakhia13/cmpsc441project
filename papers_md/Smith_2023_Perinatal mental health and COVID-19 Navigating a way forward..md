Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have increased pre-existing inequalities and risk factors for mental disorders in 
general, but perinatal mental disorders are of particular concern. They are already underdiagnosed and undertreated, and 
this has been magnified by the pandemic. Access to services (both psychiatric and obstetric) has been reduced, and in-person 
contact has been restricted because of the increased risks. Rates of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have increased. 
In the face of these challenges, clear guidance in perinatal mental health is needed for patients and clinicians. However, a 
systematic search of the available resources showed only a small amount of guidance from a few countries, with a focus on 
the acute phase of the pandemic rather than the challenges of new variants and variable rates of infection. Telepsychiatry 
offers advantages during times of restricted social contact and also as an additional route for accessing a wide range of digital 
technologies. While there is a strong evidence base for general telepsychiatry, the particular issues in perinatal mental health 
need further examination. Clinicians will need expertise and training to navigate a hybrid model, flexibly combining in person 
and remote assessments according to risk, clinical need and individual patient preferences. There are also wider issues of care 
planning in the context of varying infection rates, restrictions and vaccination access in different countries. Clinicians will need 
to focus on prevention, treatment, risk assessment and symptom monitoring, but there will also need to be an urgent and 
coordinated focus on guidance and planning across all organisations involved in perinatal mental health care.

The COVID-19 pandemic has evolved 
rapidly  and  had  global  impacts  on  all 
areas of our lives. Although restrictions 
have been lifted in many countries, case 
rates have continued to fluctuate with 
significant  surges  in  many  countries 
such  as  Australia  and  New  Zealand 
recently (Burnet Institute, 2022; World 
Health Organization, 2022).

The  pandemic  has  exacerbated 
known  risk  factors  for  mental  disor-
ders  in  general,  but  perinatal  mental 
health  during  and  in  the  aftermath  of 
COVID-19  is  of  particular  concern 
(Hermann et al., 2021; Shuffrey et al., 
2022).  Perinatal  mental  disorders 
occur during pregnancy and in the first 
year after giving birth, and encompass a 
wide spectrum ranging from mild anxi-
ety  and  depression  to  psychosis,  and 
including new episodes of pre-existing 
and 
mental 

disorders 

(Howard 

Khalifeh,  2020).  They  are  among  the 
commonest  morbidities  of  pregnancy 
and  are  associated  with  considerable 
maternal  and  foetal/infant  morbidity 
and  mortality  (Howard  et  al.,  2014; 
Jones et al., 2014), and a significant cost 
burden,  particularly  to  health  and 
social  care  (Howard  and  Khalifeh, 
2020).  Perinatal  mental  disorders 
increase mortality and morbidity from 
causes  such  as  suicide  or  substance 
misuse  but  are  also  associated  with 
increased risks of adverse physical out-
comes, such as preterm births and foe-
tal  growth  impairments,  while  those 
with  severe  mental  illness  also  have 
increased risks of pre-eclampsia, haem-
orrhage,  placental  abruption  and  still-
birth  (Howard  and  Khalifeh,  2020). 
However,  despite  this,  they  remain 
underdiagnosed 
and  undertreated

et al., 2008), and mental health care is 
accessed by only a small proportion of 
women  with  perinatal  mental  disor-
ders (Byatt et al., 2016).

The perinatal period is already one 
of  significant  biological,  psychological 
and social change, and before COVID-
19, perinatal mental health conditions 
of  different  types  and  severity  were 
estimated to affect around 10–20% of 
pregnancies (Stein et al., 2014). A num-
ber of studies across different method-
ologies  and  countries  have  reported 
increased rates of perinatal anxiety and 
depressive  symptoms  and  disorders 
during the pandemic (e.g. Chmielewska 
et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2021; Hessami 
et al., 2020; Iyengar et al., 2021; Kotlar 
et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020; Suwalska 
et  al.,  2021;  Tomfohr-Madsen  et  al., 
2021;  Vigod  et  al.,  2021;  Yan  et  al., 
2020). There are a number of factors 
which  may  have  contributed  to  the 
increased risk for perinatal mental dis-
orders during COVID-19. Public health 
measures including quarantine, physical 
distancing,  closure  of  schools  and 
social 
services  have  exacerbated 
known risk factors for maternal mental 
financial  strain, 
disorders  such  as 
reduced  psychosocial  support  and 
exposure 
violence 
to  domestic 
(Hermann  et  al.,  2021).  In  addition, 
direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
may also contribute to increased rates; 
infection  is  associated  with  increased 
rates  of  neurological  and  psychiatric 
outcomes  in  the  general  population, 
especially  in  those  with  more  severe 
infection  (Taquet  et  al.,  2021),  and  a 
number of case reports have suggested 
a possible increase in postpartum psy-
choses  after  infection,  although  num-
bers are very small (Bider and Coker, 
2021).

There  have  also  been  significant 
disruptions to mental health services. 
Shortages  of  staff  existed  before  the 
pandemic and have continued. Mother 
and  baby  units  (MBUs)  and  specialist 
mental health beds have faced particu-
lar challenges: length of stay has been 
shorter  with  greater  use  of  compul-
sory  admissions,  a  higher  proportion 
of  psychotic  illness  and  overall  acuity 

(Cranshaw  et  al.,  2021),  and  adapta-
tions  have  been  needed  to  manage 
reduced numbers of beds, strict infec-
tion  control  and  isolation  measures 
and the need to implement individual 
COVID-19 management and discharge 
plans 
(https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.
ac.uk/our-work/oxppl/pregnancy-and-the- 
perinatal-period/).

Even  when  available,  women  and 
clinicians  may  have  been  hesitant  to 
access  mental  health  emergency  ser-
vices and inpatient stays when needed. 
This  has  meant  that  more  severe  ill-
ness  has  been  managed  as  an  outpa-
tient  and  often  remotely  (Hermann 
et al., 2021). Mental health support has 
also been restricted in general obstet-
ric  services  (for  example,  by  restric-
tions on partners and visitors, use of 
PPE and reduced length of hospitalisa-
tion  post-delivery  limiting  opportuni-
ties  for  support  and  planning  for 
mental  health  management).  Both 
types  of  service  have  had  some 
replacement  by  telehealth,  and  while 
working well for many women, those 
with increased vulnerability to mental 
illness or high-risk behaviour, domes-
tic violence and social deprivation may 
require  additional  or  alternative 
resources  (Hermann  et  al.,  2021; 
Wilson et al., 2021).

In addition to altered services, preg-
nant  women  have  been  asked  to,  or 
chosen  to,  practice  more  extreme 
social  distancing  during  the  pandemic 
(Hermann  et  al.,  2021).  This  is  not 
without reason: while pregnant women 
have a similar risk of contracting SARS-
CoV-2  infection  to  the  background 
population,  the  risks  of  developing 
severe disease, admission to the inten-
sive  care  unit  and  mortality  are  all 
increased, particularly if the infection is 
contracted  in  the  third  trimester  of 
pregnancy (Nana et al., 2022). Pregnant 
women with COVID-19 are also more 
likely  to  deliver  preterm,  and  their 
babies are more likely to be admitted 
to  the  neonatal  intensive  care  unit 
(Allotey  et  al.,  2022).  While  the 
 restrictions  are  understandable,  they 
inadvertently  conflict  with  the  usual 
guidance  for  behavioural  management 

in  depression  and  anxiety  and  also 
result  in  reduced  opportunities  for 
standard care and for enhanced moni-
toring for at-risk patients.

The  impact  of  the  pandemic  also 
needs  to  be  evaluated  not  only  in 
terms  of  the  mental  health  of  the 
mother but also in potential effects on 
the  neurodevelopment  of  babies,  and 
the  relationship  between  mother  and 
baby. There is a lack of definitive evi-
dence to support direct vertical trans-
mission  of  SARS-CoV-2  or  direct 
effects of in utero viral exposure which 
might  directly  affect  neurodevelop-
ment, but there is some early evidence 
that  maternal  psychological  experi-
ences and increased stress during preg-
nancy in the context of the pandemic 
could  influence  foetal  development 
and functioning (Firestein et al., 2022; 
Kokkinaki  and  Hatzidaki,  2022).  For 
women in the perinatal period, general 
pandemic-related  stresses  are  associ-
ated  with  concerns  about  access  to 
support  in  pregnancy  and  afterwards, 
the  potential  impact  of  COVID-19  in 
pregnancy  and  newborns,  and  the 
emotional  elements  of  the  transition 
to  parenthood  (Bogler  et  al.,  2021; 
Preis  et  al.,  2020).  These  are  in  addi-
tion  to  specific  stresses  associated 
with  perinatal  mental  disorders  when 
these 
Stress-based 
changes in postpartum maternal behav-
iour  and  mother-infant  bonding  may 
affect child outcomes (Bind et al., 2021; 
Firestein et al., 2022). In the mother-
infant  dyad,  maternal  behaviour  pro-
motes  reciprocal  behaviours  in  the 
infant, which in turn elicit or reinforce 
different  parenting  approaches.  The 
pandemic’s  impact  on  these  interac-
tions and the overall well-being of the 
relationship  can  come  from  multiple 
routes. For example, poorer mother–
infant  bonding  was  associated  with 
higher  maternal  depression  and  grief 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (Liu 
et al., 2022; Viaux-Savelon et al., 2022), 
higher  perinatal  maternal  anxiety  at 
delivery  (Provenzi  et  al.,  2021),  deliv-
ery  during  the  pandemic  in  general 
(Mayopoulos et al., 2021) and days of 
separation in infants to mothers with a

SARS-CoV-2  infection  (Wang  et  al., 
2020).

Clinicians and patients in perinatal 
mental health have been faced, there-
fore,  with  particular  challenges  in 
addressing  these  multifactorial  risks 
to  mother  and  child  in  the  perinatal 
period, during and in the aftermath of 
the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Areas  of 
uncertainty  such  as  how  to  organise 
specialist  services,  when  and  how  to 
use  virtual  or  in-person  consultation 
and the assessment of risk particularly 
in women with multiple mental, physi-
cal  and  social  risk  factors  are  key 
issues in this area.

These  extra  challenges  have  been 
on the background of significant varia-
tions  in  perinatal  mental  health  ser-
vices  both  between  and  within 
countries  and  regions,  which  existed 
(Howard  and 
even  pre-pandemic 
Khalifeh,  2020).  General  medical  ser-
vices are key in the early identification 
of perinatal mental disorders, but vary 
by country and region. Specialist men-
tal  health  care  is  accessed  by  only  a 
small proportion of women with peri-
natal  mental  disorders  (Byatt  et  al., 
2019)  and  even  when  available,  ser-
vices such as specialist outpatient clin-
ics  and  MBUs  tend  to  cluster  around 
major cities or urban areas, with geo-
graphical  inequity  of  access  (Howard 
et al., 2022a). In addition, not all coun-
tries  or  areas  within  countries  have 
experienced the same restrictions and 
stressors as a consequence of the pan-
in  Australia, 
demic.  For  example, 
national  containment  measures  were 
used  initially,  but  the  response  to  a 
second wave of COVID-19 infections 
localised.  Melbourne 
was  more 
entered  an  additional  lockdown,  one 
of the longest and most stringent pan-
demic  lockdowns  in  the  world  at  the 
time (Hui et al., 2021; The Washington 
Post, 2020). While effective in contain-
ing the spread of the virus, these meas-
ures and local variations have significant 
economic, social and personal impacts 
including  on  perinatal  mental  health 
(Lequertier et al., 2022).

As the pandemic has evolved from 
an acute crisis and beyond, clinicians, 

patients, and health care organisations 
have  needed  access  to  reliable  and 
pragmatic  clinical  guidance  and  evi-
dence (Smith et al., 2020a). In the ini-
tial phase of the pandemic, there were 
frequent updates and guidelines from 
specialties,  countries  and  world 
organisations,  and  while  the  amount 
of  information  available  for  the  busy 
clinician  could  be  overwhelming,  it 
was  not  always  relevant  to  the  spe-
cific  concerns  of  specialist  mental 
health services. As we are learning to 
live with the virus, clinicians will con-
tinue to need guidance on navigating a 
more  hybrid  and  adaptable  approach 
to management.

As  mental  health  clinicians,  we 
assessed  available  guidance  on  the 
management  of  perinatal  mental  dis-
orders  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic using a validated evidence-based 
approach (Smith et al., 2020a): a team 
of  researchers  with  multidisciplinary 
backgrounds  (including  mental  health 
clinicians,  researchers,  methodolo-
gists, and a pharmacist) systematically 
searched  English  language  websites 
for  guidelines  on  perinatal  mental 
health  in  the  context  of  the  current 
COVID-19  pandemic  and  afterwards 
(updated  June  2022).  References  on 
each website were also searched and 
supplemented  with  Google  searches 
using  keywords  relevant  to  COVID-
19, perinatal mental health and guide-
lines. Queries or disagreements were 
resolved by team discussion, and the 
team collaborated with experts in the 
field  to  keep  the  guidance  global, 
focused  and  comprehensive.  The 
results of the search and synthesis of 
guidelines  on  perinatal  mental  health 
are  available  at  https://oxfordhealth-
brc.nihr.ac.uk/our-work/oxppl/preg-
nancy-and-the-perinatal-period/  and 
show that, in general, the COVID-19 
guidance available for perinatal mental 
health  services  is  relatively  sparse, 
focused mainly on obstetric care and 
almost  entirely  from  a  small  number 
of sources and countries. Much of the 
guidance  is  UK  focussed  (despite  a 
broad  and  comprehensive  search, 
which included also the United States, 

Australia,  New  Zealand,  Canada  and 
Singapore)  and  therefore  not  always 
applicable to other settings.

In particular, the use of telepsychi-
atry in perinatal mental health, partic-
ularly  after  the  acute  phase  of  the 
pandemic, is not specifically addressed 
in  the  current  guidance.  This  is  an 
area  where  clinicians  may  need  to 
navigate  a  hybrid  approach,  and  for-
mal  guidance  would  be  helpful.  Prior 
to the pandemic, there was already a 
strong  evidence  base  for  general  tel-
(American  Psychiatric 
epsychiatry 
Association, 2022), with examples of 
added value in bringing together sub-
specialty  expertise  and  benefits  in 
terms of efficiency and privacy. While 
further targeted research is needed in 
telepsychiatry  for  perinatal  mental 
disorders  (Vigod  and  Dennis,  2020), 
there  is  already  strong  evidence  of 
effectiveness  and  acceptability  across 
other  settings  and  disciplines  in  psy-
chiatry  and  across  different  cultures 
(American  Psychiatric  Association, 
2022).  Living  with  COVID-19  may 
mean a variable and flexible response 
by services to rising and falling rates of 
infection.  In  addition,  telepsychiatry 
itself offers some benefits over in per-
son meetings, and so the learning and 
experience  of  its  use  should  not  be 
abandoned as we move forward after 
the acute crisis. To integrate telepsy-
chiatry  successfully  into  the  post-
COVID-19  plan  for  clinical  practice, 
clinicians,  patients  and  health  care 
organisations  need  access  to  reliable 
and  pragmatic  clinical  guidance  and 
evidence.  Evidence-based  summaries 
of  guidance  on  telepsychiatry  in  the 
context  of  COVID-19  are  available 
(Smith  et  al.,  2020b),  but  there  is  an 
absence of formal guidance specifically 
for perinatal mental health care.

Telepsychiatry  had  already  been 
investigated pre-pandemic as a possi-
ble  route  for  increasing  access  and 
cost effectiveness in perinatal services 
(Shore  et  al.,  2020).  It  offers  some 
specific  advantages  in  this  setting 
including  increased  accessibility  to 
specialised  perinatal  mental  health 
care, which tends to be concentrated

in large urban cities and academic cen-
tres.  Telepsychiatry  may  therefore 
particularly  benefit  perinatal  women 
in rural areas who are known to be at 
a higher risk for anxiety or depression 
(Ginja et al., 2020). It also offers the 
possibility  of  a  more  naturalistic 
assessment  of  the  caregiver–infant 
interaction,  evaluation  of  the  whole 
family  including  other  caregivers  and 
siblings  and  easier  collaboration  with 
the  extended  multidisciplinary  team 
(Gressier et al., 2021). Pre-COVID-19,

The  pandemic  accelerated  the 
adoption of telepsychiatry in perinatal 
care and increased patients’ and clini-
cians’  confidence  in  using  the  various 
platforms  and  media  available,  but 
treatment still needs to be adapted to 
the needs of the individual and not all 
interventions are the same. Small dif-
ferences  in  design,  delivery  and  fre-
affect 
contact 
quency  of 
acceptability, adherence and outcome. 
For  example,  adherence  to  a  web-
based  psychological  treatment  was 
higher with telephone-based coaching 
than with low-intensity online support 
(Loughnan  et  al.,  2019).  In  addition, 
the well-documented ‘digital divide’ is 
also  especially  relevant  in  perinatal 
mental  health  care:  future  research 
should  target  virtual  care  approaches 
that improve access among socio-eco-
populations, 
vulnerable 
nomically 
those with limited access to Internet, 
video  platforms  or  telephone,  and 
those who have difficulty finding a pri-
vate  safe  space  for  virtual  meetings 

(Vigod  and  Dennis,  2020).  Access  to 
video is particularly important in peri-
natal mental health (to assess the par-
ent–infant  interaction  and  evaluation 
of social and family support), but may 
not  be  available.  Many  patients  may 
feel  unable  to  access  digital  health 
because of their lack of skill or confi-
dence.  Training  programmes 
for 
patients  (Hoffman  et  al.,  2020)  have 
been  effective  in  increasing  patients’ 
confidence and competence, but prac-
tical  access  to  relevant  technology 
remains  a  significant  issue.  Finally, 
effectiveness  and  acceptability  across 
different  cultures  and  backgrounds  is 
key  area,  and  standard  interventions 
may require targeted modification.

Not only do patients vary in their 
skills and confidence in accessing digi-
tal  health,  so  do  clinicians.  The  pan-
demic  has  accelerated  the  use  of 
telepsychiatry  in  general,  but  pre-
COVID concerns from mental health 
clinicians  including  lacking  detailed 
knowledge of the wider range of tel-
epsychiatry techniques, experience in 
establishing  rapport  and  therapeutic 
alliance  (Torous  and  Wykes,  2020), 
and key areas of skills such as assess-
ing  risk  and  safeguarding  (Cowan, 
2019)  have  not  yet  been 
fully 
addressed. Training clinicians will be a 
key  area,  with  an  evidence-based, 
training 
focused  and  measurable 
approach to meet the needs of a post-
COVID-19 world (Smith et al., 2022). 
In  perinatal  mental  health  services, 
there  are  extra  challenges  in  assess-
ment  and  delivery  of  interventions 
remotely,  but  there  are  also  already 
examples  of  successful  adaptations, 
for  example,  in  delivering  infant–par-
ent  therapy  via  telehealth  (Ehmer 
et al., 2022; Paul et al., 2022).

Assessment of risk is a priority in 
perinatal  mental  health  services,  and 
this  needs  to  be  managed  safely, 
whether in person or remotely. There 
is evidence that rates of reporting of 
domestic  violence  and  abuse  (DVA) 
fell  during  the  pandemic  (Hildersley 
et al., 2022), and this may be related 
to  the  difficulty  for  some  women  of 
safely disclosing DVA across a virtual 

the 

pandemic, 

interaction  when  they  are  at  home 
with the perpetrator. There is a need 
to  guide  professionals  in  how  to 
screen 
for  and  assess  risk  both 
remotely  and  safely  (Emezue,  2020; 
Howard et al., 2022b). Several organi-
sations  have  produced  guidance  on 
assessing  risk  remotely  (see  https://
oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/our-
work/oxppl/domestic-violence-and-
abuse/  for  summary).  In  addition, 
some new emergency support routes 
which were developed and used dur-
such  
ing 
as  using  existing  public  places  and 
increases 
in  pre-existing  support 
 (helplines and shelters), can be used in 
to  remote  assessments. 
addition 
Techniques  such  as  the  use  of  code 
words or signals during a consultation 
may  also  be  helpful.  However,  for 
some patients who are at higher risk 
of  DVA  or  self-harm,  or  relapse  of 
severe mental illness, in-person meet-
ings  will  be  essential  to  assess  these 
risks.  For  others,  a  hybrid  model  of 
telemedicine  and  in-person  meetings 
may be the optimal solution (Wassef 
and Wassef, 2022).

In  summary,  perinatal  services, 
consistent  with  all  health  care  ser-
vices,  rapidly  shifted  during  the  pan-
demic  to  the  use  of  telepsychiatry. 
Given the clear advantages, we should 
not lose the impetus to integrate tel-
epsychiatry into practice in the post-
COVID-19  world.  Mental  health 
services  should  explore  ways  to  use 
technology to improve integration of 
services  and  facilitate  access  to  peri-
natal mental health treatment. Mobile 
applications are particularly accessible 
and  provide  low-cost  opportunities. 
With the increasing access to smart-
phones,  there  is  the  potential  to 
address some of the urgent challenges 
in  ensuring  prompt  and  equitable 
access and uptake for perinatal health 
services globally. Rigorously designed 
trials are needed to address some of 
the unanswered questions in this spe-
cialist  setting  (Vigod  and  Dennis, 
2020) and approaches will need to be 
individualised according to the needs 
and risks of the patient.

Aside from the use of telepsychia-
try, there are wider issues in perinatal 
care  highlighted  by  the  pandemic 
which  clinicians  and  managers  will 
need  to  consider  and  where  formal 
guidance  would  be  helpful  (Otu  and 
Yaya,  2022).  The  pandemic  and  its 
aftermath  are  still  evolving,  with  dif-
ferent infection rates, restrictions and 
vaccination rates according to region 
and  country.  This  needs  to  be  care-
fully  considered  in  care  planning. 
Clinicians  and  patients  should  agree 
plans for preventive care and immedi-
ate treatment of emerging symptoms, 
including the potential for unexpected 
events,  particularly  separation  from 
usual  sources  of  support.  The  plan 
should include patients and their fami-
lies  in  monitoring  symptoms,  with  a 
safety  plan  of  response  consistent 
with pandemic-specific restrictions at 
the time (Hermann et al., 2021). The 
longer-term impacts of the pandemic 
also need to be considered in service 
planning. Alongside the normal expe-
rience  of  parenting  stress  following 
the  transition  to  parenthood,  new 
parents are now subject to additional 
in  the  context  of  the 
anxieties 
COVID-19 pandemic. Parenting stress 
is  associated  with  longer-term  nega-
tive  impacts  on  the  parenting  pro-
vided  as  well  as  on  infant  outcomes, 
but can be reduced by greater paren-
tal  support  (Brown  et  al.,  2020; 
Taubman-Ben-Ari et al., 2021).

Women with a history of depression 
or anxiety disorders should continue to 
use preventive psychotherapies. These 
may be in person or via virtual health 
platforms  according  to  clinical  need 
and  patient  preference  (Hermann 
et  al.,  2021).  Psychotherapy  is  often 
effective  in  depression  of  mild  and 
moderate  severity,  but  antidepres-
sants may be required in more severe 
depression or when therapy does not 
lead  to  remission.  This  is  already  a 
complex decision for patients and cli-
nicians  in  balancing  potential  benefits 
and harms in each individual situation 
(Brown and Vigod, 2021) and will need 
to also include the additional risks of 
illness 
untreated  or  undertreated 

during  pandemic  and  post-pandemic 
situations.

Many  professional  organisations 
and  treatment  providers  have  devel-
oped psychoeducational materials for 
patients  and  carers  (see  https://
oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/our-work/
oxppl/pregnancy-and-the-perinatal-
period/  for  examples),  and  voluntary 
and community organisations provide 
vital  maternal  mental  health  support 
as  a  key  addition  to  formal  mental 
health  services.  However,  strategies 
are  required  on  all  levels,  and  there 
need  to  be  system-level  changes  to 
address not only the pre-existing defi-
ciencies in care provision in perinatal 
mental health, but also the extra pres-
sures  resulting  from  the  pandemic. 
While clinicians can make a significant 
impact  by  focussing  on  prevention, 
treatment, risk assessment, and symp-
tom monitoring, the task of organising 
perinatal  mental  health  services  for 
the current ongoing crisis and prepar-
ing  for  the  next  needs  guidance  and 
planning  across  organisations  includ-
ing  government  departments,  health 
care  providers,  and  the  voluntary 
sector.
