Abstract
Sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts (SOGICE) are harmful practices, yet who suggests them to young
people and what impacts are associated with these suggestions have received limited attention in the literature. The present
study explored whether certain suggesters, and the frequency of categories of suggesters (including religious leaders, family
members, and health professionals), were associated with suicidality and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The study also
explored whether particular demographics of young people were more likely to report SOGICE experiences. Data were
collected through an online survey of New Zealand gender- and sexuality-diverse youth. The sample (n = 3948) had an age
range of 14–26 (mean age = 18.96), and approximately half (52.4%) were transgender or gender-diverse. Odds of suicidality
and NSSI were highest when religious leaders suggested SOGICE and when more than one type of suggester was reported.
SOGICE was more likely to be reported by transgender and gender-diverse youth, statutory care- and homelessness-
experienced youth, and young people reporting current material deprivation. Implications for targeted mental health services
and education for young people and the community are discussed.

Adolescence and young adulthood have been character-
ized as periods of intense identity development (Water-
man, 1982). To the extent that SOGICE disrupts positive
identity development,
it also threatens gender- and
sexuality-diverse young people’s wellbeing. Young peo-
ple develop in a range of contexts, including families,
schools and religious communities. These are important
contexts where suggestions of SOGICE may have sig-
niﬁcant
impacts on young people’s development and
wellbeing. This study explored the prevalence, demo-
graphics, and effects of SOGICE in a youth-speciﬁc sur-

the frequencies of
SOGICE were associated with harm.

The wellbeing of gender- and sexuality-diverse young
people1 is a pressing issue. Meta-analyses have consistently
demonstrated a higher prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI) and suicidality for gender- and sexuality-diverse
young people compared to cisgender heterosexual young
people in many nations (Plöderl & Tremblay, 2015). Mental
health disparities have also been identiﬁed for transgender
and gender-diverse (Fenaughty et al., 2021a) and sexuality-
diverse youth (Fenaughty et al., 2021b) in New Zealand.
The elevated risks of NSSI and suicidality for young people
in New Zealand and internationally occur in the context of
cisheterosexist stigma and discrimination against people
with transgender and gender-diverse (Tan et al., 2022) and
identities.

this
SOGICE represents a particularly acute aspect of
damaging cisheterosexism.

Conceptualizing SOGICE

Cisheterosexism is a system of beliefs and practices that
center heterosexual cisgender
identities as the norm
(Cowie & Braun, 2021). Cisheterosexism is produced and
the
sustained by heteronormativity. Heteronormativity,
system that constructs heterosexuality as the only normal,
natural and desirable sexuality, is enabled by the cissexist
assumption that gender only exists as a woman/man bin-
ary. Heteronormativity operates through a “heterosexual
matrix” that requires “…a stable sex expressed through a
stable gender

deﬁned through the compulsory practice of hetero-
sexuality” (Butler, 1990, p.151). Departures from het-
eronormative alignment in this matrix (i.e., male assigned
sex, masculine gender, and heterosexual attraction to
women; female assigned sex, feminine gender, and het-
erosexual attraction to men) place people outside of the
heteronorm, where they may be subjected to stigma and
sanctions, including SOGICE. Although sex, gender, and
sexuality are distinct concepts, the pervasiveness of het-
through the action of the heterosexual
eronormativity,
matrix, often leads to the conﬂation of all
three. For

diverse ways outside of dominant cisgender and heterosexual norms.
The use of this term here includes Indigenous and culturally speciﬁc
knowledge of gender and sexuality, while acknowledging this term is
limited in recognising intersecting aspects and histories of identity
(Mizzi & Walton, 2014). The term is used here to emphasise cishe-
terosexism and its effects, yet other oppressions are obscured in this
framing.

homophobic language and “fag discourse” (p.330) can be
used to police gender non-conformity by conﬂating fem-
inine male behaviour with stereotypes of gay males. To

identity distinctly or collectively; however, the American
Psychological Association (2021b) notes that these prac-
tices are not always mutually exclusive.

including structured programs at formal institutions (e.g., a
course at a church), medication (Chan et al., 2022) or
interventions (e.g., electroshock and aversion
medical
therapy), and psychotherapeutic techniques,
including
counselling (Salway et al., 2021). SOGICE also includes
attempting to change or suppress sexual orientation or
gender identity in healthcare settings, including withholding
access to gender-afﬁrming healthcare (Veale et al., 2021).
Although certain SOGICE practices may operate more
insidiously (e.g., ‘theological’ conversations with a reli-
gious leader or group prayer meetings to ‘help/save’ an
absent/excluded individual),
involve pervasive
efforts to reinforce cisgender and heterosexual norms (Sal-
way et al., 2021).

Prevalence of SOGICE

To date, studies with majority-adult populations from
nonprobability samples demonstrate lifetime estimates of
sexual orientation change efforts ranging from 3% in
Korea (n = 2168; Lee et al., 2021) to 22% in Hong Kong
(n = 219; Chan et al., 2022), and gender identity con-
version efforts ranged from 14% in the United States
(n = 27,676; Turban et al., 2019) to 20% in Aotearoa New
Zealand (n = 610; Veale et al., 2021). A Canadian study
explored the prevalence of conversion therapy practices in
9214 sexual minority men in Canada (Salway et al.,
2021). In the Canadian sample, 9.9% (n = 910) of parti-
cipants reported experiencing conversion efforts from a
“licensed healthcare professional (psychologist, psychia-
trist, doctor), unlicensed counselor, camp, faith-based
organization focused on conversion therapy, individual
religious leader (i.e., not through a formal organization),
and/or another religious individual” (Salway et al., 2021,
p.4). However, when asked a broader question about
SOGICE exposure, “have you or any person with
authority (parent, caregiver, counselor, community leader,
etc.) ever tried to change your sexual orientation or gender
identity?” (Salway et al., p. 4), the proportion of partici-
pants reporting lifetime SOGICE experiences doubled
to 20.6%.

There are a few potential explanations for the differences
in the prevalence of SOGICE across these studies, including
the age distribution of a sample, the range of measures used

to identify SOGICE and whether they include subtler forms
of SOGICE, as well as the cultural and political contexts of
each country. Younger adults have reported a higher pre-
valence of change efforts than adults and older adults in
studies in the Southern USA (Higbee et al., 2020) and
Canada (Salway et al., 2021). In New Zealand, transgender
adolescents aged 14–18 years were signiﬁcantly more likely
to be exposed to gender identity change efforts than older
adults aged ≥55 years (25 vs 15%) (Veale et al., 2021).
However, limited work has focused solely on the prevalence
of SOGICE in children and young adults. To date, one large
nonprobability sample (n = 25,791) from the USA found
that 4.2% of gender- and sexuality-diverse youth and young
lifetime
adults reported experiencing SOGICE in their
(Green et al., 2020). In that youth-speciﬁc study, sexual
orientation change efforts were not assessed separately from
gender identity change efforts and participants aged 13–17
years were more likely to report SOGICE than those aged
18–24 (5.1 vs 3.3%).

A broad range of people initiate SOGICE,

including
leaders in religious and spiritual groups, family members
and relatives, and health care providers. Canadian research
found that approximately two-thirds of those who reported
SOGICE said it was initiated by religious leaders or indi-
viduals and faith-based organizations; the next common
initiators were licensed health professionals; and one-ﬁfth
reported SOGICE by unlicensed health professionals (Sal-
way et al., 2021). New Zealand research of transgender and
gender-diverse people’s experiences of gender
identity
change efforts found that SOGICE has also been initiated
by mental health professionals,
including psychiatrists,
psychologists, and counsellors (Veale et al., 2021).

Transgender and gender-diverse participants in New Zeal-
and research who were exposed to SOGICE in health care
settings were more likely to report having been rejected by
their family members for being transgender (Veale et al.,
2021). Indeed, other research has found that
individuals
themselves may initiate SOGICE because they fear being
rejected by their family and religious communities for being
gender or sexuality-diverse (Chan et al., 2022). Hong Kong
research found that the desire to be heterosexual and avoid
gender- and sexuality-diverse stigma were strong drivers for
sexuality-diverse men to undertake sexual orientation change
efforts (Chan et al., 2022). Studies involving sexual- (Chan
et al., 2022) and gender- (Veale et al., 2021) diverse partici-
pants have shown higher levels of internalized homo/bi/
transphobia among those exposed to SOGICE.

Mental Health Harms Associated with SOGICE

Not only do SOGICE lack an adequate basis in scientiﬁc
and ethical principles (Przeworski Peterson & Piedra,
in fact, associated with a range of

they are,

signiﬁcant mental health issues that are most likely pro-

practices. International literature indicates an association
between exposure to SOGICE and detrimental mental
health outcomes among predominantly adult samples,
including anxiety symptoms (Chan et al., 2022), depression
symptoms (Lee et al., 2022), suicidal thoughts (Ryan et al.,
2020); and suicide attempts (Turban et al., 2020). The
psychological impact of SOGICE may be more acute for
young people, given the developmental tasks of identity
development and consolidation that are most salient at this
age (Waterman, 1982). In a youth-speciﬁc study in the USA
(Green et al., 2020), those who reported SOGICE had about
twice the odds of seriously considering suicide (63 vs 38%;
odds ratio [OR] 1.76) and attempting suicide (44 vs 18%;
OR 2.23) than those without such experiences.

SOGICE, though the scopes of the respective legislation vary.
For example, Brazil’s laws only restrict licensed psychologists
from practicing SOGICE; in contrast, the legislation in Malta
prevents both non-professionals and professionals from prac-
ticing SOGICE (Mendos, 2020), and though Germany’s laws
only protect minors, it includes family members within its
scope of people who may be held accountable by the law
(BBC, 2020). Some countries have regional prohibitions,
including Australia, the United States, and Spain. In contrast,
several countries in Latin America and Oceania have laws that
indirectly pose restrictions on forms of SOGICE (such as
prohibiting a mental health professional from diagnosing
someone as mentally ill based on their gender or sexuality) but
do not explicitly name or deﬁne conversion practices in such
laws (Mendos, 2020). In February 2022, Aotearoa New
Zealand’s government voted to pass the Conversion Practices
Prohibition Legislation Bill into law. Several other countries
are considering passing legislation to prohibit these practices.

claim religious leaders’ and parents’ rights to promote and
conduct SOGICE outweigh the need to act in the best interests
of the child (Mendos, 2020). However, the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), relevant to
young people aged up to 18 years, states that the maturing
young person is particularly vulnerable to adversity and
“needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal

protection” (p. 1). The UNCRC emphasizes that decisions
around rights and protected practices must center on ensuring
that the best interests of the child (as opposed to those of
parents or religious leaders) are met. The UNCRC adds a
buttress to gender- and sexuality-diverse young people’s rights
to freedom of expression of their gender and sexuality iden-
tities, freedom from experiences of SOGICE-related torture
(Méndez, 2013), and their right to life (a particular issue
related to the suicide ideation associated with SOGICE).

Current Study

As most of the studies on SOGICE to date have analyzed adult
populations, there is limited understanding of young people’s
contemporary experiences of SOGICE. This is the ﬁrst youth-
speciﬁc study outside the North American region to examine
SOGICE experiences. The study aims to identify whether
particular groups within a gender- and sexuality-diverse youth
sample in Aotearoa New Zealand are more likely to report
SOGICE and whether SOGICE is associated with NSSI,
suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, and suicide attempts in this
age group. The study also aims to examine whether there are
differences in mental health outcomes for those exposed to
SOGICE-suggestion by family members, religious leaders,
medical professionals, and the young people themselves.
Based on the literature, young people exposed to SOGICE are
predicted to be more likely to report NSSI and suicidality.
There has been no prior research examining whether the
relationship between SOGICE and mental health differs by
SOGICE suggestions from family, religious, medical, or self-
suggested SOGICE in young people, so this exploratory study
is not able to make informed predictions about whether any
categories, or frequencies, of SOGICE-suggesters will be more
strongly associated with NSSI and suicidality.

Method

Design and Consultation

Data was used from the Identify Survey, which was open
from February to August 2021. Identify was an anonymous
online survey available to takatāpui,2 MVPFAFF+,3

2 Takatāpui is a traditional Māori term (the indigenous language of
Aotearoa New Zealand), originally meaning “intimate partner of the
same sex” (Kerekere, 2015). It has been reclaimed and is now used to
describe Māori who are gender or sexuality-diverse or who are born
with variations in sex characteristics.
3 MVPFAFF+ is an acronym that encompasses Paciﬁc expressions of
gender and sexuality. It stands for Mahu (Hawai’i and Tahiti), Vaka sa
lewa lewa (Fiji), Palopa (Papua New Guinea), Fa’afaﬁne (Samoa),
Akava’ine (Rarotonga), Fakaleitī (Tonga), and Fakaﬁﬁne (Niue) (New
Zealand Human Rights Commission, 2020).

LGBTQIA+ young people, and friends and allies aged
between 14 and 26 years (inclusive) in Aotearoa New
Zealand. The survey focused on young people’s experiences
across various contexts, including education, employment,
home, and the community. The survey included questions on
protective aspects and challenges in these contexts. A sec-
tion also collected health and wellbeing data,
including
measures of suicide ideation and attempts.

The survey was a collaboration between two national
youth community organizations and researchers who
represented a range of genders, sexualities, ethnicities, and
ages. The survey content, structure,
recruitment, and
branding were informed by nine in-person regional com-
munity consultations in 2020. Questions in this study were
either developed by the research team, often following
community consultation, or were replicated from existing
New Zealand studies with transgender and gender-diverse
people (Veale et al., 2021) and a national youth behavioral
surveillance study (Fleming et al., 2020).

The survey was constructed in Qualtrics and supported
smart logic so that participants were only shown questions
relevant to their previous answers. In-person recruitment
was conducted at community events, including Pride festi-
val events in main cities and existing nightclub events and
community meetings. Posters were placed in prominent
community venues (e.g., queer- and trans-friendly bars and
cafes), schools and tertiary institutions, and in the libraries
of two large cities. Online recruitment was conducted via
advertisements and posts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok,
Twitter, YouTube, and Grindr. Word of mouth, including
via social media and preliminary data “teasers” in main-
stream media stories, also advertised the survey. The study
received ethical approval from the New Zealand Health and
Disability Ethics Committee (20/NTB/276).

Participants

The survey received 6712 initial responses. After ﬁltering
responses that were ﬂagged by Qualtrics as spam (n = 86) or
that did not provide consent (n = 39), did not meet age
requirements (n = 511), were not living in Aotearoa New
Zealand (n = 33), were duplicates (n = 35), were illogical,
including homophobic and transphobic responses (n = 19), or
did not complete more than ﬁve questions after the branching
question on current educational or employment
status
(n = 748), the sample consisted of 5241 valid responses. The
completion rate for the SOGICE section was high (n = 4118;
78.6%). In this study, participants were warned about a range
of sensitive topics before sensitive sections and were given the
opportunity to easily skip each section by selecting the option:
“I ﬁnd this topic upsetting, and would like to skip these
questions.” Of the 4118 participants who began the section on
SOGICE, some responded that they found the topic upsetting

Journal of Youth and Adolescence (2023) 52:149–164

153

and wanted to skip the section (n = 129) and 41 selected “I’d
prefer not to say” when asked the ﬁrst question of this section
about whether they had experienced conversion therapy; these
participants (see Appendix Table 5) were excluded from the
statistical analysis, leaving a ﬁnal sample size of 3948.

The mean age of the sample was 18.96 (range 14–26;
standard deviation [SD] 3.65). About half identiﬁed as cis-
gender (47.6%), and others included nonbinary (16.9%),
unsure if trans/questioning (13.2%), trans boy/man (9.7%),
another gender (8.1%), and trans girl/woman (4.4%). Based on
the concept of total response (i.e., participants can be counted
as more than one ethnic group) (Ministry of Health, 2017), a
majority of participants identiﬁed as New Zealand European/
Pākehā4 ethnicity (84.2%), followed by 14.5% indigenous
Māori, 4.1% Chinese, 2.7% Indian, 2.5% British, 1.9% Fili-
pino, 1.9% Samoan, 1.4% Dutch, and 1.0% Cook Island
Māori. Participants were also able to select multiple responses
to describe their sexuality. About half were queer (46.0%), and
other identities were 43.4% bisexual, 23.5% gay, 23.4%
pansexual, 19.6% lesbian, 14.8% ﬂuid, 14.5% asexual, 9.5%
demisexual, 7.8% unsure/questioning, and 5.9% takatāpui.

Measures

Sociodemographics

Participants’ gender was determined by responses to two
questions on gender and sex assigned at birth. Participants
were asked, “When a person’s gender is different from their
think of themselves as
they might

transgender (or trans). Which of these statements best describe
you? (Please select all that apply).” These statements were, I
am not [emphasis in original] transgender or nonbinary
(cisgender); I am transgender and identity as a girl/woman/
wahine (trans girl); I am transgender and identity as a boy/
man/tāne (trans boy); I am transgender and identify with
another gender (another gender); I am nonbinary (nonbinary);
I’m not sure if I am transgender or nonbinary (unsure). In this
study, participants were assigned into one of the six categories,
following the priority order of unsure, trans girl (assigned male
at birth)/trans boy (assigned female at birth), another gender,
nonbinary, and cisgender. For example, a participant who
selected both “unsure” and “another gender” was categorized
as having an “unsure” gender.

The sexuality of participants was collected with a
question that asked, “Which of the following bestde-
that apply).”

Demisexual; Fluid / it changes; Something else (please
describe); and I’m not sure.

A Canadian material deprivation index developed by the
McCreary Centre (Smith et al., 2019), with local adapta-
tions, was used to assess deprivation. The index provided a
list of resources that are material wellbeing indicators for
young people: money for myself; smartphone; space to hang
out on my own; money to spend on eating out; access to
transport; equipment or clothes for extracurricular activ-
ities; clothes that ﬁt me; a quiet place to sleep; and access to
high-quality internet. Response options were Yes, I have
this; I don’t have this, but I wish I had it; I don’t have this,
but I don’t need it. Participants were classiﬁed as having
material deprivation when they responded I don’t have this,
but I wish I had it to any of the resources.

SOGICE

The research team developed the SOGICE items following
community consultation about the sorts of practices and lan-
guage that young people may recognize or use in describing
SOGICE practices locally. The question asked, “Have you
ever personally experienced ‘conversion therapy’?” with a
description: ‘Conversion therapy’ is a practice or treatment that
tries to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender or stop
them from expressing their rainbow5 identity. It is sometimes
known as reparative therapy, ex-gay therapy, and healing
sexual brokenness. It can also happen in prayer sessions.”
Response options were yes; no; I’d prefer not to say. A further
question was asked of participants who responded yes to the
SOGICE question, “Which of the following people suggested
‘conversion therapy’ to you? (Please select all that apply).”
Response options included A leader in my religious or spiri-
tual community; A medical professional; A family/whānau6
member; myself; and another person (please describe). Text
responses to the another person item were reviewed and
recoded into the above categories if appropriate. Self-
suggested SOGICE was determined by any response that
included “myself” as a suggester.

The SOGICE item used in this study focused on who
suggested SOGICE to young people, rather than who initiated
it. In response to feedback from community consultation
when designing the survey, the word “suggest” was used,
rather than “told”, to recognize both the overt, as well as
covert ways, that people communicated SOGICE to young

5 The term “rainbow” was used throughout the Identify Survey as an
umbrella term to include gender- and sexuality-diverse and intersex
people. It is a term increasingly used in Aotearoa New Zealand to refer
to queer, trans, and intersex communities.
6 Whānau is a Māori word that loosely translates to family; however,
family in this context often includes extended family (i.e., beyond
parents and siblings, to include grandparents, parents’ siblings, and
cousins), and sometimes close friends.

people. By focusing on who suggested SOGICE the item also
recognizes that who suggests SOGICE may be distinct from
who conducts or initiates it, and that the advocacy of sug-
gesters may be an important feature in how these practices are
subsequently viewed and experienced by the young person.
The wording of this item reﬂected a range of experi-
ences and nuances in the context of heteronormativity.
including a youth-speciﬁc study
Some recent research,
(Green et al., 2020), also combined sexual orientation and
identity change efforts in the same question.
gender
Although separating change efforts by gender or sexual
orientation could provide more speciﬁcity as to their
effects, the operation of the heterosexual matrix (Butler,
1990) means it is not always possible, or even intelligible,
to identify whether the change efforts were due to a per-
son’s gender or sexuality. For instance, a cisgender young
man’s sexual attraction to other men may result in others’
reframing his gender identity as feminine, in keeping with
the heterosexual matrix’s requirement of compulsory
‘opposite’ sex, and therefore gender, attraction. Here he
may face policing of his gender (e.g., sissy and ‘fag’ dis-
courses, not being ‘man’ enough, etc.) despite being cis-
gender, making the distinction for SOGICE based on his
sexual orientation versus his gender confounded. While in
some situations, a young person may have a clear under-
standing of a sexual orientation vs gender identity moti-
vation for their SOGICE experience, others may not be
able or wish to untangle others’ motivations. The APA
recently identiﬁed this conﬂation in their 2021 Resolution
on Sexual Orientation Change Efforts, noting that sexual
orientation change efforts “…have not only targeted sexual
and romantic behavior but also gender expressions that do
not conform to stereotypes. In this way, gender identity
change efforts have also been a component of SOCE.”
(APA, 2021b, p.1).

don’t have this, but don’t need it.” Missing values were
imputed using the expectation maximization method
through the estimation of means and covariances of avail-
able data in the index (Enders, 2003).

Differences in proportion for SOGICE exposure across
sociodemographic variables were determined using chi-
squared goodness-of-ﬁt tests. For dichotomous variables
(ethnicity, sexuality, homelessness, and Oranga Tamar-
iki7/statutory care experience), the corrected p-value for a
2 × 2 comparison was reported. Next, regression analyses
in generalized linear models were performed to identify
the associations between SOGICE exposure and different
SOGICE suggesters, with NSSI and suicidality. Ordinal
regression was employed for NSSI and binary logistic
regression for suicide ideation, suicidal plan, and suicide
attempt. Covariates in multivariate models were age,
gender, and material deprivation. An alpha level of
p < 0.05 was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance in
all analyses.

Results

Table 1 displays the proportion of Identify participants who
had ever experienced SOGICE. In total, 124 participants
(3.1%; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 2.6–3.7) reported ever
having experienced SOGICE. As presented in Table 2, a
higher proportion of those exposed to SOGICE was aged
19–26 years (vs 14–18 years), were trans, non-binary, or
another non-cisgender identity, were unsure/questioning
gender, and reported severe deprivation. Table 3 outlines
the associations between SOGICE exposure and NSSI and
suicidality. Participants with SOGICE exposure were more
likely than those without SOGICE experience to report
NSSI, suicide planning, and suicide attempts. After adjust-
ing for age, gender, and material deprivation, SOGICE
exposure was signiﬁcantly associated with increased NSSI
frequency (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.03–2.08), and more than two
times the odds of planning suicide (OR 2.56; 95% CI
1.74–3.78) and attempting suicide (OR 2.73; 95% CI
1.70–4.39).

Participants reporting SOGICE exposure had SOGICE
suggested by family/whānau members (55.6%), religious

the 22 participants who selected “myself,” some also

selected “myself” only (41.0%). Table 4 presents the
association between SOGICE exposure from each sug-
gester type and NSSI and suicidality. In bivariate models,
those who experienced SOGICE suggestion from reli-
gious or spiritual
leaders had a higher likelihood of
reporting a suicide plan and suicide attempt. Similar
ﬁndings were observed for medical professionals and
family/whānau members as SOGICE suggesters. How-
ever, signiﬁcantly higher NSSI frequency and suicide
ideation were found amongst participants whose family/
whānau members suggested SOGICE to them. In multi-
variate models that adjusted for age, gender, and material
deprivation, those exposed to SOGICE-suggestion from
leaders were signiﬁcantly more
religious or spiritual
likely to engage in NSSI, suicidal planning, and suicide
attempts (OR 3.00; 95% CI 1.54–5.84). Having family/
whānau members who suggested SOGICE was also a
signiﬁcant predictor for suicidal planning and at least one
suicide attempt (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.20–4.31).

Participants who reported self-suggesting SOGICE
were separated from those who had been exposed to
SOGICE-suggestion by other individuals. In the sample
of those exposed to other-suggested SOGICE (n = 114),
61.4% (n = 70) of participants had reported one type of
SOGICE-suggester, and 38.6% (n = 44) were exposed to

two or more types of SOGICE suggesters. In bivariate
models, participants exposed to increasing types of
SOGICE suggesters had a higher likelihood of engaging
in NSSI and all
the suicidality variables that were
examined. After adjusting for sociodemographic vari-
ables, an increment of exposure to one SOGICE-
suggester (on a scale of 0 to 2), on average, was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with 29% increased odds of NSSI
frequency, 77% for a suicidal plan, and 71% for a suicide
attempt.

Discussion

Studies on SOGICE, predominantly with adult populations,
have demonstrated associations with adverse mental health
outcomes and highlight that particular groups may be at
higher risk of harm. However, few of these studies have
been explicitly designed to explore young people’s experi-
ences. Young people may face additional challenges when
exposed to SOGICE, as adolescence is the time when
to
identity development and consolidation are central
positive youth development. The effects of SOGICE that
seek to change a key part of young people’s identity at this
developmental stage may therefore be particularly harmful.
to identity development;
Relationships are fundamental
however, there is limited research on whether particular
categories of people who suggest SOGICE to young people
are differentially associated with harm. This study addres-
sed these gaps by collecting mental health and demographic
data, including data on who suggested SOGICE to partici-
pants. The results conﬁrmed that SOGICE is occurring for
an important minority of young people in New Zealand and
that it is often very harmful. Mental health impacts did vary
according to who suggested SOGICE to the young person,
the frequency of categories of people who suggested it, and
young people’s membership in particular demographic
groups that were associated with increased stigma and
distress.

The ﬁndings indicate that at

least 3.0% of a con-
temporary youth sample have experienced SOGICE. Stu-
dies using alternative measures targeting particular SOGICE
behaviors or phenomena have produced higher estimates
among Canadian participants (Salway et al., 2021) and
transgender and gender-diverse participants in New Zealand
(Veale et al., 2021). One potential explanation for the
relatively low reporting of SOGICE in the present study
could be due to the wording of
the question around
SOGICE. The question in the current study was written to
describe experiences and use language that was likely to be
recognizable to the local younger age group of the study.
However,
the question wording may have emphasized
direct SOGICE experiences rather than indirect processes or

As a measure, this may have produced a more conservative
estimate of prevalence than measures that explicitly include
SOGICE through indirect means (e.g.,
the denial of

etc.) (Veale et al., 2021). In addition, the question in the
current study initially required participants to endorse that
their experience was “conversion therapy.” Although the
wording of the question described a range of “practices,”
the initial use of the word therapy may have made it difﬁcult

for participants to reconcile a negative experience with
something that was purported to be “therapeutic.”. As such,
when including participants who reported they were too
upset to answer the initial question or who said they pre-
ferred not to respond once asked the question (see Appendix
Table 5), the prevalence rose to 7.1%, which may be a more
accurate estimate of prevalence in a nonprobability youth
sample.

research predominantly with adults showing increased age-
related prevalence in Hong Kong (Chan et al., 2022) and
South Korea (Lee et al., 2021) but differs from recent US
(Green et al., 2020) and NZ (Veale et al., 2021) research
showing greater prevalence in younger participants. The age
differences in the current study may indicate that older
youth may have had more time to understand and recognize
their SOGICE experiences, and may therefore be more
likely to report such experiences. In addition, older youth
may be more willing to answer questions about experiences
that may now be historic and potentially less distressing
than younger participants who may currently have, or only
recently had, SOGICE experiences. The ﬁndings show that
younger youth were more likely to skip or decline to answer
these questions (see Appendix Table 5), which might mean
that SOGICE experiences for younger youth are under-
represented in the study. Internationally, more research with
youth populations is required to understand these trends and
acknowledge that many presently enduring such experi-
ences may be too distressed to answer these items, leading
to underreporting among younger youth.

Critically, the results align with ﬁndings from interna-
tional literature that show an association between SOGICE
and NSSI and suicidality among adults, as well as among
young people aged ≤24 years (Green et al., 2020). The odds
for suicide attempts in the past year were nearly three times
for participants who had experienced SOGICE compared
with those who had not; this effect size was similar to the
ﬁndings observed among gender- and sexuality-diverse
youth exposed to SOGICE in the USA (Green et al., 2020).
The results are consistent with the hypothesis that
the
effects of SOGICE are particularly damaging to young
people’s mental health. The higher risk of NSSI, suicide
planning, and suicide attempts in the past year highlights
that experiences of SOGICE that may have occurred earlier
in life, even in the relatively short lives of young people,
may produce long-term harm. SOGICE practices are asso-
ciated with life-threatening implications, emphasizing the
importance of prohibiting such practices and providing
trauma-informed mental health support, including for his-
torical experiences.

The ﬁndings show that the prevalence of SOGICE varies
by some sociodemographic features and not others. For

instance, SOGICE was relatively equally reported by par-
ticipants across all ethnicities and sexualities but was more
likely to be reported by young people who were transgen-
der, non-binary or another gender, or unsure whether they
were transgender, than by cisgender young people. The
higher rates reported by transgender and gender-diverse
young people could indicate that they may have experi-
enced change efforts directed at their gender identity and
their sexual orientation, and this may increase the potential
for distress. Service provision and future research should
recognize those young people who are both gender- and
sexuality-diverse may face increased challenges compared
to those who occupy only one of these identities.

Additionally,

transgender and gender-diverse young
people may afﬁrm their non-cisgender identities at an early
age (Fast & Olson, 2018) than sexuality-diverse young
people do their non-heterosexual identities (Bishop et al.,
2022). In this way, they may face increased exposure to
earlier SOGICE than sexuality-diverse young people, and
this earlier age of SOGICE exposure, or the increased
duration of SOGICE exposure, may also explain the
increased associations of SOGICE-related harm for these
young people. Future research is required to explore whe-
ther the age of recognizing one’s gender- and sexuality-
diverse identity, alongside the age of ﬁrst SOGICE expo-
sure, are related, and potentially associated with mental
health outcomes.

that

Transgender and gender-diverse young people may
also be more likely to face SOGICE in healthcare settings
than sexuality-diverse young people because accessing
gender-afﬁrming care requires the disclosure of a gender-
diverse identity. Disclosing a gender-diverse identity may
increase the chances
these young people face
SOGICE by healthcare practitioners. The study shows that
family members are often involved in suggesting SOGICE
to transgender and gender-diverse young people. One way
that they may do this is to delay, discourage and prevent
access to gender-afﬁrming health care. The study under-
scores that transgender and gender-diverse young people
need stronger protections and must have access to
unbiased gender-afﬁrming healthcare without cisheter-
onormative gatekeeping by health care practitioners or
parents and guardians. The study emphasizes that trans-
gender and gender-diverse young people must be expli-
citly named and visible in SOGICE policy, intervention,
and practice outcomes to ensure that their unique and
increased needs are addressed.

Young people reporting severe deprivation were also
more likely to report SOGICE than those reporting less
deprivation. While this may be a byproduct of the increased
rates of homelessness and statutory care experience reported
by those who reported SOGICE experiences, it nonetheless
emphasizes the need for accessible and affordable mental

health supports for gender- and sexuality-diverse young
people and adults. Accessible and affordable mental health
care support is critical in this situation, as those reporting
severe deprivation may not be able to afford treatment
otherwise.

Equally, policies and processes for young people who
are homeless or have experienced homelessness or
involvement with statutory child services must recognize
that SOGICE experiences are statistically more common
this group and respond accordingly. A range of
for
research demonstrates the overrepresentation of gender-
and sexuality-diverse young people experiencing home-
lessness or statutory care (Baams, 2019). SOGICE may be
a direct or indirect cause of homelessness or statutory care
experience, which means that secular statutory care ser-
vices may be essential for young people who may have
been traumatized by religious SOGICE experiences. The
study could not determine whether family members who
suggested SOGICE were foster parents or siblings or
whether the young people were in statutory care because
of such experiences from family members. Given the
prevalence of young people in care reporting SOGICE
experiences, statutory care workers must be educated on
the damaging effects of SOGICE and screened to ensure
such practices are avoided in future.

A sensitivity analysis explored whether a similar pattern
of sociodemographic characteristics was associated with
reluctance to answer the SOGICE items. Appendix Table 5
shows that other than the noted higher prevalence among
younger young people to skip the SOGICE section, the
other differences were higher rates of skipping by nonbinary
young people, Māori, and Cook Island Māori participants.

required when drawing comparisons; however,
research is needed to understand why participants from
these groups were more likely to skip these questions. It
may be that more members of these groups experienced
current or recent SOGICE exposure compared to partici-
pants from other groups in the study. However, the higher
rates of non-binary youth who declined to answer SOGICE
questions, alongside the higher rates of non-binary young
people who reported SOGICE when they did answer these
items, highlights a concerning trend for this group. One
possible reason for the overrepresentation of non-binary
participants in both sets of these results may reﬂect the
largely transnormative nature of gender-afﬁrming care
(Pasley et al., 2022) that may place non-binary populations
at greater risk of SOGICE compared to young people with
other gender identities. More research on these populations,
as well as continued validation and improved under-
standings of Māori, Cook Island Māori and non-binary
identities, are important opportunities that may improve
outcomes.

A wide range of people may suggest SOGICE to a

found a strong association between family member-
suggested SOGICE and suicidality, which reﬂects USA
research showing that participants whose parents had
initiated sexual orientation change efforts had three times
the odds of reporting a suicide attempt than those who had
not experienced this (Ryan et al., 2020). The signiﬁcance
of family members’ suggestions of SOGICE may reﬂect
the fact that the majority of young people rely on family
members for
including
meeting their housing, living and ﬁnancial needs. Many
family members will also meet many of the emotional
needs of young people. Therefore, when such family
members, who often have a lot of power and inﬂuence on
young people, suggest SOGICE, it may be more distres-
sing than when other,
less powerful and intimately
aquatinted adults and peers suggest SOGICE. In contrast,

responses to their child’s gender or sexual orientation can
foster positive outcomes in health (Newcomb et al.,

identity (Katz-Wise et al., 2016). These effects emphasize
the need for family education and support, particularly

research has highlighted that

SOGICE suggested by religious leaders was also sig-
niﬁcantly more likely to be associated with higher NSSI and
suicide planning and attempts in the past year. The sig-
niﬁcance of religious leaders’ role in SOGICE-related harm
may reﬂect that such leaders are often highly trusted by
young people and their families. When such people, who
ostensibly have young people’s best
interests at heart,
suggest SOGICE, a disproven therapeutic activity (Amer-
ican Psychological Association, 2021b), this results in sig-
niﬁcantly increased odds of
suicidality and NSSI.
Prohibiting people in such roles from suggesting or initi-
ating SOGICE is an essential public health response to
protect gender- and sexuality-diverse young people from
harm. Alongside education for parents and families, policy
and practice interventions are required to support the edu-
cation of religious and spiritual communities about the harm
associated with SOGICE to help prevent such experiences
from continuing.

People who self-suggest SOGICE may be particularly
negative about their diverse gender and sexuality. Some
of the increased harm reported for self-suggestion of
SOGICE may represent the increased anguish and shame
at “failing” not only themselves but also others when the
promises of SOGICE are not realized. Understanding

SOGICE experiences, even when self-suggested,
critical public health recommendation from this study, and
young people who seek out such experiences are an urgent
priority for mental health and support services. The
increased risk of NSSI and suicidality for young people
who self-suggest SOGICE also strengthens and broadens
the recommendations for education and support on this
issue. A public health response requires that all young
people, irrespective of their gender or sexuality, receive
comprehensive education about gender and sexuality
diversity to counter destructive norms that devalue and
stigmatize their identities (Fenaughty, 2019).

Half of the young people who self-suggested SOGICE
also reported that another person had suggested SOGICE
to them, indicating that others’ attitudes and beliefs often
inform self-suggestion decisions. Further, Table 4 shows
that harm increased as the frequencies of categories of
suggesters increased. The increased risk associated with
multiple types of SOGICE-suggesters underscores the
power of others to inﬂuence or mitigate SOGICE self-
suggestion and initiation. Further studies are required to
determine the nuances within the relationship between
the number of SOGICE-suggester types and NSSI and
suicidality risks; nonetheless, mental health services are
advised to screen for the frequency of types of suggesters
of SOGICE and to consider the increased risk of harm for
young people who report more than one type of
suggester.

Sample bias is one of the crucial limitations of a non-
probability sample. Recruitment for the study relied on the
internet and social media, as well as regional libraries,
mass media stories, and posters in schools and tertiary
education providers. The call to participate in the research
was also widely shared through rainbow community net-
works and media. Young people connected to rainbow
communities and media may therefore have been more
likely to see the call to participate. Such young people may
differ from those not connected to rainbow communities
and media, as they may have more rainbow-friendly social
connections and supports, which may operate as protective
factors for their mental health. The greater concentration of
more-connected participants in the study means the data
may underestimate the adverse effects of SOGICE
experiences because it cannot account for those who have
fewer connections and, therefore, less supports. Young
people currently undergoing SOGICE may also have been
less likely to be engaging with rainbow communities and
media, and they may have been less likely to see the call to

participate, resulting in a potential underestimate of the
prevalence of SOGICE. Nonetheless, a key strength is the
large sample size, which enabled comparisons within the
sample to tease out effects while accounting for bias to the
greatest degree possible.

that a large population of “converted” young
doubtful
people who are satisﬁed with their SOGICE experience
exist or report positive mental health outcomes due to
SOGICE. The literature demonstrates that SOGICE is
associated with adverse short- and long-term mental health
outcomes, including suicidality. Extrapolating these men-
tal health ﬁndings means that many young people with
SOGICE exposure may experience debilitating mental
health outcomes and may not be able, or even alive, to
participate in research on SOGICE exposure. As such, all
cross-sectional SOGICE survey ﬁndings are more likely to
underestimate the prevalence and adverse effects of
SOGICE.

The question wording may have inadvertently created
barriers to young people reporting a negative “therapy”
experience. A question focusing on practices and with-
holding services may generate a higher prevalence of
SOGICE, including by health practitioners, who were less
implicated than in other studies. While the adverse effects
of SOGICE in the study were comparable to international
studies, the prevalence was lower. For these reasons, the
prevalence data on young people who said they were too
upset to answer the SOGICE item or said they preferred not
to answer further questions on SOGICE after the initial
question is included (see Appendix Table 5). The combined
proportion of participants who requested to skip this ques-
tion due to being upset, alongside those who did report
SOGICE, may better

As a cross-sectional study, the ﬁndings are correla-

are consistent with the literature detailing the harmful
effects of SOGICE among mainly adult participants, as
well as a large non-probability youth sample in the US
(Green et al., 2020), and qualitative ﬁndings (Kinitz et al.,
2021). Furthermore, the outcome measures of NSSI, sui-

these data suggest the potential for long-term harm that
occurs after SOGICE exposure in young people. Further
research is required to understand how SOGICE is asso-
ciated with mental health problems over time, which
might explore whether there are compounding effects of
SOGICE over time.

The

analysis presented focuses on gender-

and
sexuality-diversity but not on variations in sex char-
acteristics. While intersex young people were included in
the analysis, the sample size was too small to separately
analyze young people with variations in sex character-
istics. Further research is required to explore key factors
for young people with variations in sex characteristics in
relation to SOGICE.

Conclusion

Adolescence is characterized as a period of signiﬁcant
identity development, yet few youth-speciﬁc studies have
explored how SOGICE experiences affect people at this
age. Using a survey methodology with a large sample of
gender- and sexuality-diverse young people,
this study
shows that SOGICE occurs in youth and demonstrates
important demographic and mental health associations.
Building on recent research on adult populations, this study
emphasizes the additional challenges facing transgender and
gender-diverse young people, who experience higher rates
of SOGICE suggestion. The ﬁndings highlight the increased
risk of SOGICE for young people experiencing material
deprivation, homelessness, and statutory care. The study
extends the ﬁeld by identifying that SOGICE suggested by
religious leaders and family/whānau members were asso-
ciated with the highest occurrence of reported NSSI, sui-
cidal planning and suicide attempts. SOGICE suggestions
by people whom youth may respect, value, and rely on, like
religious leaders and family members, may be particularly
harmful to their positive identity development and sub-
sequent mental health. Increased rates of harm were also
associated with reports of multiple categories of people
suggesting SOGICE or self-suggested SOGICE. In addition
to prohibiting SOGICE, particularly when suggested by
religious leaders and family members, free and accessible
mental health support is a priority for those exposed to
SOGICE. Particular groups require additional support,
including transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse
young people,
statutory care-experienced youth, and
young people who have experienced homelessness. Edu-
cation for families,
religious leaders and communities,
health and social service providers, and all young people,
regardless of their gender and sexuality identities, is a cri-
tical public health response to address the stigmatizing
attitudes, beliefs, and norms that enable SOGICE sugges-
tion and initiation to continue.
