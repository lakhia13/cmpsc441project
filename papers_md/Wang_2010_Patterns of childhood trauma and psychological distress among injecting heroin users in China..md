Abstract

Background:Childhood trauma has been reported as a possible cause of future substance abuse in some countries. This
study reports the prevalence of childhood trauma and examines its association with psychological distress among injecting
drug users from mainland China.

Methodology:The study was conducted in three government-operated drug rehabilitation facilities in Shanghai, China in
2007. The Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF) was used to evaluate 4 types (general, emotional,
physical and sexual) and severity of childhood trauma, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) to evaluate
psychological distress.

PrincipalFindings:Among 341 injecting drug users who completed the study, about 80% reported one or more types of
childhood trauma, specifically 53% general trauma, 56% physical abuse, 36% emotional abuse and 26% sexual abuse.
Compared to female injecting drug users, males reported significantly higher scores of general trauma and physical abuse,
but lower sexual abuse scores. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that greater physical and emotional abuse in
childhood predict greater current psychopathological distress among these injecting drug users in China.

Conclusions: The results reveal a high prevalence of childhood trauma among injecting drug users in China, and it is
comparable to other similar studies in Western countries. It is important to consider the role of childhood trauma in the
prevention and treatment of substance abuse.

Introduction

in childhood,

Childhood trauma,

including physical abuse, sexual abuse,
and emotional abuse/neglect
is a significant
risk factor for many psychiatric disorders later in life, such as
substance abuse, borderline personality disorder, depression,
and posttraumatic stress disorder [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Rates of child-
hood trauma in the general population of western countries
varied from about 20% to over 40% in different studies and in
different countries [7,8,9,10]. In China, the only available study
showed much lower rates of childhood trauma: 0.1% reported
childhood sexual and physical abuse among a group of Chinese
factory workers, and 7.8% reported childhood abuse among
schizophrenia inpatients in Shanghai, China [11]. The results
may be due to the instrument used in the sutdy— Dissociative
Disorders Interview Schedule [12]— which is not specifically
designed to measure childhood trauma. Such a low estimated
further
childhood trauma in Shanghai warrants
rate of
investigation.

Studies in the United States found that childhood trauma is
related to future substance abuse [13,14,15]. A much higher
prevalence of childhood trauma among cocaine, heroin, and

alcohol abusers, ranging from 60% to 90% [14,15,16,17,18] has
been reported. Since 1990, drug abuse in China has been
worsening—with a 20-fold increase from 70,000 official registered
drug abusers in 1990 to 1.16 million in 2005. In 2005, the number
of all drug users was estimated to reach 3.5 million in China
[19,20]. Furthermore, compared with 1991, more than 4 times as
many drug-related offenses were recorded in 2005 [21]. Thus, to
better understand how childhood trauma may impact drug abuse
later in life and to provide adequate intervention strategies in the
fast growing drug abuse populations, including heroin users in
China, an accurate report of childhood trauma in such
populations is much needed. As mentioned above,
traumatic
experience in childhood could also lead to other psychiatric
conditions, psychological symptoms or disorders later in life
[1,2,3,4,5,6]. However, among Chinese drug abusers,
the
relationship between childhood trauma and psychiatric disorders
has never been explored. This study aims to find the prevalence of
childhood trauma and to examine its potential association with
psychological symptoms among a substance abusing population in
China. We hypothesized that childhood trauma is a common
phenomenon and associated with psychological distress
in
injecting drug users in China.

Methods

Ethics Statement

This research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Shanghai Mental Health Center and written informed
consent was obtained from all study participants.

Participants and setting

This study was conducted as the baseline part of a 5-year
longitudinal epidemiological study of injecting drug users (IDUs) in
Shanghai. The main aim of the five year study is to estimate
gender differences in the prevalence of HIV risk behaviors and the
prevalence of HIV, HCV and HBV among IDUs. The study
design uses convenience sampling to recruit any patients who meet
study inclusion criteria and who were mandated to undergo drug
rehabilitation programs. Once consented, the study participants
will be followed for 5 years. The study samples were recruited from
April to September 2007 according to the following inclusion
criteria: (a) meeting the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for substance
dependence as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) [22]; (b) being at least 18 years
(c) having injected drugs during the 30 days prior to
of age;
admission to a rehabilitation program;
(d) having no severe
physical conditions (such as an acute stage of cardiovascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, or neurodegenerative diseases),
and (e) having the cognitive capacity to give consent.

At each study site, potential participants were identified from a
computerized database of heroin addicts. Individuals over 18 years
of age, who were identified at intake assessment as DSM-IV heroin
dependent, were approached and consented by trained physician
interviewers from Shanghai Mental Health Center, Shanghai Jiao
Tong University School of Medicine. Since this study has been
funded by the National Institute of Health in the United States, the
study is also compliant with their human subject protection
requirements.

After the study procedures were explained, each potential
participant reviewed a consent form and then was asked to repeat
the main points to check for understanding. If he or she did not
clearly understand, interviewers explained again. If the potential
participant still did not understand, he or she was not enrolled. At
baseline, a structured interview was conducted in person by
trained physicians. The interviewers collected each participant’s
information, such as demographic characteristics and drug use
history (such as onset age of drug use and the duration of drug
use), and then administered an additional questionnaire designed
for this study. After the face-to-face interview, participants were
asked to complete a set of
self-administered questionnaires
including ETISR-SF and The Symptom Checklist-90-Revised
(SCL-90-R). Herein, the cross-sectional data at baseline of the
parent longitudinal study were used for statistical analyses. The
response rate of this baseline study is 100%, which is usually
expected in China.

Measures

Childhood trauma was assessed using ETISR-SF [23]. This
instrument contains a total of 27 items, including 11 items for
general trauma, 5 items for emotional abuse, and 6 items for
sexual abuse. Participants responded ‘‘yes’’ ( = 1) or ‘‘no’’ ( = 0) to
each item. Within each of these 4 domains, an index was created
by counting all responses, and a total score was a summation of all
items. Higher scores in each domain indicate more traumatic
experiences. The ETISF-SF has an acceptable
reliability,
indicated by Cronbach’s alphas for these 4 domains ranging from
0.70 to 0.87 [23]. The Chinese version of ETISR-SF, which was

tested among a group of depression patients and drug user shows a
similar range of Cronbach’s alpha values from 0.67 to 0.84 [24].
In the current study, the reliability of ETISR-SF ranged from 0.66
to 0.82.

Psychological distress was assessed by using the SCL-90-R [25],
a 90-item self-report measure of global psychopathological
the SCL-90 has a good
symptoms. The Chinese version of
reliability,
indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.97 [26].
Respondents rated items on a five-point scale reflecting their
distress during the past 7 days. Scores were generated for nine
symptom scales and an overall Global Severity Index (GSI).
Because several SCL-90 subscale scores were highly correlated, we
used only the GSI score, which has been widely considered the
single best global measure of psychological distress.

Covariates include demographic characteristics such as gender,
age, marital status, education, and employment status, and drug
use history, such as onset age of drug use and the duration of drug
use. Then, recent drug use was verified by urinalysis results from
each participant’s admission record. If self-reported drug use
information did not match the urinalysis
result, a positive
urinalysis results would be used for the study.

Statistical Analysis

All data was entered twice and cleaned by checking for expected
ranges, presence of abnormal values, and whether the distribution
of variables met assumptions of statistical tests. Bootstrap t-tests
were used for the comparison because childhood trauma data had
an abnormal distribution. Bootstrap analysis was performed using
STATA 10.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX).

Then SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) was used
for all remaining statistical analyses. Pearson correlation analyses
were used to investigate associations between childhood trauma
and psychological distress. Further, in order to test the contribu-
tion of each domain of childhood trauma to psychological distress,
linear regression analysis was conducted in a
a hierarchical
sequence of two models. In each model, psychological distress,
measured by the SCL-90 GSI score, was the dependent variable.
Model 1 accounted for the effects of covariates, age, gender,
education, marital status, employment, and duration of drug use
were entered into the regression equation. Four types of childhood
trauma were entered in Model 2. Statistical
significance at
P-values less than 0.05 was reported for all analyses.

Results

Participant characteristics

All 341 participants were diagnosed with DSM-IV heroin
dependence. The reported average daily heroin dose of
the
participants prior to being admitted to rehabilitation programs was
0.98 g. Among the participants, 30.3% reported using metham-
phetamine, 39.1% using alcohol, 16.5% using marijuana and
11.5% using other illegal drugs during their life time. Table 1

Correlations between childhood trauma and
psychological distress

The mean SCL-90-R GSI score in this population was 0.7. All
four types of childhood trauma measured by ETISR-SF subscales
were significantly correlated with psychological distress as
measured by SCL-90-R GSI scores (Table 3). The correlation
coefficients between all types of childhood trauma, which are all
under 0.35, are statistically significant (P,0.01).

Hierarchical Linear Regression Analyses

From hierarchical

linear regression analyses, six covariates,
including age, gender, marital status, education, employment
status, and duration of drug use were regressed against GSI as a
first step in analysis (Model 1, Table 4). This model accounted for
0.06% of the variance in higher levels of current psychological
distress (GSI). None of these variables are significantly related to
psychological distress.

In Model 2, four childhood trauma variables were added to
Model 1. Model 2 accounted for an additional 10.9% of the
variance. After controlling for covariates, greater physical abuse
and emotional abuse were significantly correlated with higher
levels of current psychological distress.

Discussion

This cross-sectional study reported a much higher prevalence of
childhood trauma (80%) among injecting drug users when
compared to the rates previously reported in the general
population or other
in China. Furthermore,
greater physical and emotional abuse in childhood was associated
with greater psychological distress later in life in this sample.

subpopulations

In China, childhood trauma has been treatedas an uncommon
phenomenon historically. A previous study suggested that the rates
of physical and sexual abuse were low among the general
population and schizophrenia patients [11]. However,
in the
current study, injecting drug users reported a substantially high
rate 80% of participants reported experiencing childhood trauma.
This rate is comparable to their counterparts’ reports in Western
countries [14,15,18,27]. Because childhood trauma is a prevent-
able phenomenon that occurs early in life and affects psychological

findings highlight

Considering the extremely low prevalence of childhood trauma
reported among the general population of China, individuals who
experienced childhood trauma may tend to be more vulnerable to
substance abuse. One explanation is that poor coping strategies,
such as avoidance, have been demonstrated to exacerbate the

impact of childhood trauma on later substance abuse [28,29]. In
general, Chinese tend to use acceptance and avoidance as ways to
cope with difficult situations [30]. One survey among 512 Chinese
heroin users found that over seventy percent of these patients have
avoidant personality traits [31]. So, avoidance coping may be even
more salient among this underprivileged subpopulation of
injecting drug users who were abused during childhood. However,
further investigation is warranted to determine how different
coping styles may affect Chinese populations, including drug users
dealing with traumatic situations. Furthermore, there are many
other factors contributing to both injection drug use and childhood
trauma, but the current study cannot delineate these factors.

Childhood Trauma and Distress among Heroin Users

Gender differences in childhood trauma were found in this
substance abusing population. Our finding of males experiencing
significantly more physical abuse than females is inconsistent with
what has been reported in previous studies [14,15,17]. The reason
for this inconsistence is not clear because few studies on childhood
trauma have been done in China. One potential explanation may
be cultural differences, but further study is needed. However, our
study found that gender differences in sexual abuse were similar to
those found in Western studies, but the rates of reported sexual
abuse were much lower compared to other countries [16,32].

in adulthood [18,27,33,34,35,36,37].

Childhood trauma is known to be linked to a wide range of
In
negative outcomes
particular, levels of cumulative trauma have been associated with
psychological distress [17]. Further, childhood trauma, including
all types of trauma, may serve as a common etiological factor in
substance abuse and psychological distress [29]. Our study showed
that rather than sexual abuse, physical abuse and emotional abuse,
in childhood are significantly associated with psychological distress
among a drug using population in China. Braver’s (1992) study in
a university counseling center found that physical and emotional
abuse had a greater impact than sexual abuse on subsequent
adjustment. This model of childhood trauma’s impact on human
psychology is in line with our findings. These findings are relevant
to clinical practice because sexual abuse has often been thought to
be the most important type of childhood trauma.

Furthermore, stress, including childhood trauma, can increase
an individual’s vulnerability to addiction and relapse [38,39]. For
example, childhood abuse survivors did not benefit
from
treatments as much as their non-abused peers in psychological
functioning or substance abuse [40]. In addition, identification of
types of childhood trauma and recognition of gender differences in
trauma are important to treatment outcomes. A recent study of a
cocaine-dependent population found that greater severity of
childhood emotional abuse was associated with an increased risk
of relapse in females but not in males [41]. Considering evident
gender differences in types of childhood trauma in our study,
future studies are necessary to explore the interaction of different
childhood traumas, gender, and treatment responses in substance
abuse patients in China.

There are several limitations in this study. First, the validity of
adult retrospective self-report measures of childhood trauma may
be compromised by fallibility of memory and social desirability
bias
[29], even though it has been demonstrated to be a
worthwhile method [42]. Secondly, because all participantswere
abstinent from substance use for almost one year since they had
stayed in the rehabilitation units for one year when they were
recruited, their psychological distress levels may be lower than
those in active drug users. Thus, our findings may not be
generalizable to other substance using populations in China.
Third, although we found a very high rate of childhood trauma
among heroin users, we cannot determine if heroin addiction was
indirectly related to childhood trauma or if the addiction was a
result of childhood trauma because of the cross-sectional nature of
this study. Fourth, since the majority of participants who show
more sexual abuse, but less general trauma and physical abuse in
this
the sexual abuse rate might be
overestimated, where as general trauma and physical abuse rates
might be underestimated. Also the reasons for gender differences
are more complex than what our results showed here.
