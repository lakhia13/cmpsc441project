ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder, with mood swings between depression and mania, may affect up to 1.5% of adults, and increases the
risk of suicide and disability. Most people improve over time, but two thirds may have residual dysfunction, and at least 40% may have re-
current episodes. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions:
What are the effects of treatments in people with mania associated with bipolar disorder? What are the effects of treatments in bipolar de-
pression? What are the effects of interventions to prevent relapse of mania or bipolar depression? We searched: Medline, Embase, The
Cochrane Library and other important databases up to July 2006 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check
our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 60 system-
atic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence
for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following
interventions: antidepressants, carbamazepine, chlorpromazine, clonazepam, cognitive therapy, education, family-focused psychoeducation,
gabapentin,  haloperidol,  lamotrigine,  lithium,  olanzapine,  psychological  treatments,  quetiapine,  risperidone,  topiramate,  valproate,  and
ziprasidone.

the risk of suicide and disability.

Most people improve over time, but two thirds may have residual dysfunction, and at least 40% may have recurrent
episodes.

• Lithium reduces symptoms of mania compared with placebo, and seems as effective as haloperidol, carbamazepine,

and clonazepam, but can cause adverse effects including hypothyroidism.

• Older antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are widely used to treat mania, but few studies

have been done to confirm their efficacy.

Olanzapine, valproate, carbamazepine, and risperidone increase the likelihood of response in people with mania
compared with placebo, and seem to have similar efficacy as each other, with different adverse-effect profiles.

Ziprasidone, quetiapine, and clonazepam may also be beneficial, but few studies have been done to assess the
effects of lamotrigine or gabapentin in mania.

Topiramate is unlikely to be beneficial in mania.

Antidepressants increase treatment response compared with placebo in people with bipolar depression. It is
possible that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are more effective, and less likely to induce mania, compared
with tricyclic antidepressants.

Lamotrigine may increase response rates in people with depression compared with placebo, but can cause
headache.

Quetiapine may also improve depression compared with placebo.

We don't know whether lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, or topiramate improve depression in people with
bipolar disorder.

We don't know whether psychological treatments are effective for people with bipolar depression, as we found
no studies.

• Lithium reduces relapse in bipolar disorder compared with placebo.

Valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine seem as effective as lithium in reducing relapse.

Cognitive therapy and patient or family education may reduce the risk of relapse, but studies have given conflicting
results.

We don't know whether antidepressants can prevent relapse, and they may induce mood instability or manic
episodes.

Olanzapine may reduce relapse, but long-term use may be associated with weight gain.

DEFINITION

Bipolar disorder (bipolar affective disorder, manic depressive disorder) is characterised by marked
mood swings between mania (mood elevation) and bipolar depression that cause significant per-
sonal distress or social dysfunction, and are not caused by drugs or known physical disorders.
Bipolar type I disorder is diagnosed when episodes of depression are interspersed with mania
or mixed episodes. Bipolar type II disorder is diagnosed when depression is interspersed with
less severe episodes of elevated mood that do not lead to dysfunction or disability (hypomania).
Bipolar disorder has been subdivided in several further ways (see table 1, p 33 ). [1]

INCIDENCE/
PREVALENCE

One 1996 cross-national community-based study (38,000 people) found lifetime prevalence rates
of bipolar type I disorder ranging from 0.3% in Taiwan to 1.5% in New Zealand. [2]  It found that
men and women were at similar risk, and that the mean age at first onset ranged from 19–29 years
(average of 6 years earlier than first onset of major depression).

AETIOLOGY/
RISK FACTORS

The cause of bipolar disorder is uncertain, although family and twin studies suggest a genetic basis.
[3] The lifetime risk of bipolar disorder is increased in first-degree relatives of a person with bipolar
disorder (40–70% for a monozygotic twin; 5–10% for other first-degree relatives). If the first episode
of mania occurs in an older adult, it may be secondary mania caused by underlying medical or
substance-induced factors. [4]

PROGNOSIS

Bipolar disorder is a recurring illness, and one of the leading causes of worldwide disability, espe-
cially in the 15–44 years age group. [3]  One 4-year inception cohort study (173 people treated for
a first episode of mania or mixed affective disorder) found that 93% of people no longer met criteria
for mania at 2 years (median time to recover from a syndrome 4.6 weeks), but that only 36% had
recovered to premorbid function. [4]  It found that 40% of people had a recurrent manic (20%) or
depressive  (20%)  episode  within  2  years  of  recovering  from  the  first  episode.  A  meta-analysis,
comparing observed versus expected rates of suicide in an age- and sex-matched sample of the

general population, found that the lifetime prevalence of suicide in people with bipolar disorder was
about 2% — or 15 times greater than expected. [5]

AIMS OF
INTERVENTION

To alleviate mania and bipolar depressive symptoms; to prevent relapse and suicide; to optimise
social and occupational functioning; and to improve quality of life, with minimal adverse effects of
treatment.

OUTCOMES

METHODS

Level of symptoms on rating scales (completed by clinician, patient, or both); proportion of people
with clinically important response to treatment; time to remission; quality of life scores; social and
occupational functioning scores; relapse; hospital admission; rates of suicide; frequency of adverse
effects; and clinical trial withdrawal rates. Commonly used instruments for assessing symptoms
include the Young Mania Rating Scale, which rates 11 manic symptoms with a total score of 0–60;
the Schedule for Affective Disorders Change Mania Sub Scale, which rates 18 manic items with a
total score of 10–65; and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, which has both a 17- and a 21-
item version. On these scales, a clinically important response to treatment is usually defined as a
greater than 50% reduction in score from baseline. [6]  A person is usually considered to be in re-
mission if, at the end of the trial, they score 12 or less on the Young Mania Rating Scale, and 8 or
less on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. [6]  Quality of life is assessed by scales such as the
SF-36, and social and occupational functioning on scales such as the Clinical Global Impression
Scale.

BMJ  Clinical  Evidence  search  and  appraisal  July  2006. The  following  databases  were  used  to
identify studies for this review: Medline 1966 to July 2006, Embase 1980 to July 2006, Psycinfo
1960 to July 2006, and The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 2. Additional
searches  were  carried  out  using  these  websites:  NHS  Centre  for  Reviews  and  Dissemination
(CRD),  Database  of  Abstracts  of  Reviews  of  Effects  (DARE),  Health  Technology  Assessment
(HTA), Turning Research into Practice (TRIP), and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excel-
lence (NICE) clinical guidelines. Abstracts of the studies retrieved were assessed independently
by two information specialists using pre-determined criteria to identify relevant studies. Study design
criteria for evaluation in this review were: published systematic reviews and RCTs in any language,
at least single blinded, and containing more than 20 individuals of whom more than 80% were fol-
lowed up. Some RCTs have been included with less than 80% follow-up, but in whom an intention
to treat analysis was undertaken using the last observation carried forward. There was no minimum
length of follow-up required to include studies. We excluded all studies described as “open”, “open
label”, or not blinded. We also did a search for prospective and retrospective cohort and case series
studies  on  the  harms  of  all  interventions.  In  addition,  we  use  a  regular  surveillance  protocol  to
capture harms alerts from organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the  UK  Medicines  and  Healthcare  products  Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA),  which  are  continually
added to the review as required. We have performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence
for interventions included in this review (see table, p 34 ).

Adverse effects
Lithium can cause a range of adverse effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, fine tremor, renal impairment,
polydipsia, leucocytosis, weight gain, oedema, and hypothyroidism. It is unclear how these adverse effects compared
with those of other antipsychotic drugs.

Note
We found no clinically important results about the effects of lithium compared with clonazepam.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Lithium versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999, 1 RCT, 179 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[7] The RCT compared three treatments: lithium (36 people), valproate (69 people), and placebo
(74 people). It found that lithium significantly increased the proportion of people who responded
after 3–4 weeks compared with placebo (response defined as at least 50% improvement in mania
score on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Change; 18/36 [50%] with lithium
v 19/74 [27%] with placebo; RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.23; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 20).

Lithium versus placebo or versus quetiapine:
See benefits of quetiapine, p 13 .

Lithium versus chlorpromazine:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999, 4 RCTs, 114 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[7]  It found that lithium significantly increased the proportion of people who had remission of
symptoms at 3 weeks compared with chlorpromazine (remission not defined, 3 RCTs that assessed
outcomes at 3 weeks: 23/57 [40%] with lithium v 7/57 [12%] with chlorpromazine; RR 1.96, 95%
CI 1.02 to 3.77 [figures reported from table 5 in paper]; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 9).

Lithium versus haloperidol:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999, 2 RCTs, 50 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[7]  It found no significant difference between haloperidol and lithium in symptom scores at 3 weeks
(assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: effect size –2.14, 95% CI –6.57 to +2.30).

Lithium versus risperidone:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999, 1 RCT, 54 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[7]  It found that risperidone was significantly more effective than lithium in improving symptom
severity score at 4 weeks (assessed by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale: effect size –2.79, 95% CI
–4.22 to –1.36).

Lithium versus olanzapine:
We found no systematic review but found one RCT (30 people with bipolar type I disorder). [8]  It
found no significant difference between lithium and olanzapine in Young Mania Rating Scale score
at 28 days (13.2 with lithium v 10.2 with olanzapine; P = 0.315).

Lithium versus valproate:
We found one systematic review (search date 2002, 3 RCTs, 158 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[6]  It found no significant difference between valproate and lithium in the proportion of people who
failed to respond over 3–6 weeks (response defined as 50% reduction in mania score on the Young
Mania Rating Scale or the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Change; 45/97
[46%] with valproate v 26/61 [43%] with lithium; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50).

Lithium versus carbamazepine:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999, 3 RCTs, 176 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[7] The review could not perform a meta-analysis of all three RCTs because of differences in out-
comes assessed. The first RCT (105 people) found no significant difference in the proportion of
people who responded over 4 weeks between lithium and carbamazepine (15/54 [28%] with lithium
v 14/51 [28%] with carbamazepine; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.88). The other two RCTs (71 people)
found no significant difference in global severity of symptoms over 4 weeks between lithium and
carbamazepine (assessed by Clinical Global Impression scores: effect size +0.44, 95% CI –0.78
to +1.67). [7]

Lithium versus lamotrigine:
We found no systematic review but found one RCT (30 people with bipolar type I disorder). [9]  It
found no significant difference between lithium and lamotrigine in Young Mania Rating Scale scores
at 4 weeks (mean: 13.2 with lithium v 14.3 with lamotrigine; reported as non-significant; no further
data reported).

Lithium versus clonazepam:
We found one systematic review (search date 1999), which found two small RCTs (52 people with
bipolar type I disorder). [7]  However, the RCTs were not of sufficient quality to meet BMJ Clinical
Evidence inclusion criteria.

Lithium in combination with olanzapine:
See benefits of olanzapine, p 11 .

Lithium versus topiramate:
See benefits of topiramate, p 16 .

Harms:

Lithium has a range of adverse effects, many dose related, including gastrointestinal disturbances,
fine tremor, renal impairment (particularly impaired urinary concentration and polyuria), polydipsia,
leucocytosis, weight gain, oedema (may respond to dose reduction), and hypothyroidism.

Lithium versus placebo:
The RCT identified by the review found that lithium significantly increased the proportion of people
who had adverse effects compared with placebo (33/36 [92%] with lithium v 58/74 [78%] with
placebo; RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37; NNH 8, 95% CI 4 to 334). [7]  Adverse effects were not
specified.

Lithium versus chlorpromazine:
The review provided inconclusive evidence on the proportion of people who had adverse effects
with lithium compared with chlorpromazine. [7]  Adverse effects were not specified.

Lithium versus haloperidol:
The review gave no information on adverse effects. [7]

Lithium versus risperidone:
The review gave no information on adverse effects. [7]

Lithium versus olanzapine:
The RCT found no extrapyramidal adverse effects associated with lithium or olanzapine. [8]

Lithium versus valproate:
The review found that valproate significantly reduced the proportion of people who had fever
compared with lithium (1 RCT: 1/69 [1%] with valproate v 5/36 [14%] with lithium; RR 0.10, 95%
CI 0.01 to 0.86). It found no significant difference in the rates of other adverse effects. [6]

Lithium versus carbamazepine:
The review found no significant difference in adverse effects between lithium and carbamazepine
(2 RCTs: 27/73 [37%] with lithium v 35/66 [53%] with carbamazepine; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to
1.02). [7]  Adverse effects were not specified.

Lithium versus lamotrigine:
The RCT found “no significant adverse effects” between lithium and lamotrigine, but it is likely to
have been too small to detect clinically important adverse effects. [9]  One person taking lithium
withdrew because of a seizure, and one person taking lamotrigine withdrew because of aggravation
of diabetes.

Symptoms of mania
Compared  with  placebo Valproate  reduces  the  symptoms  of  mania  compared  with  placebo  after  3  weeks  (high-
quality evidence).

Compared  with  lithium Valproate  is  as  effective  as  lithium  at  reducing  the  symptoms  of  mania  after  3–6  weeks
(moderate-quality evidence).

Compared with haloperidol Valproate is as effective as haloperidol at reducing the symptoms of mania after 6 days
(moderate-quality evidence).

Compared  with  olanzapine Valproate  may  be  less  effective  at  reducing  the  symptoms  of  mania  compared  with
olanzapine after 47 weeks (moderate-quality evidence).

Compared with carbamazepine Valproate is as effective as carbamazepine at reducing the symptoms of mania after
4–6 weeks (moderate-quality evidence).

Valproate  or  lithium  plus  olanzapine  compared  with  placebo Valproate  or  lithium  plus  olanzapine  reduces  the
symptoms of mania compared with placebo after 6 weeks (moderate-quality evidence).

Compared with quetiapine Valproate may be as effective as quetiapine at reducing the symptoms of mania after 28
days (low-quality evidence).

Adverse effects
Valproate is associated with fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects, and with less sedation compared with haloperidol,
but can cause nausea and nervousness.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Valproate versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date 2002, 3 RCTs, 316 people with bipolar type I disorder).
[6]  It found that valproate significantly increased the proportion of people who responded over 3
weeks compared with placebo (response defined as 50% reduction in mania score on the Young
Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] or the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia–Change;
proportion of people who failed to respond: 66/155 [42%] with valproate v 111/161 [69%] with
placebo; RR of failing to respond 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.77). [6]

Valproate versus lithium:

Valproate versus haloperidol:

6 days between valproate and haloperidol (11/21 [52%] with valproate v 10/15 [67%] with lithium;
RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.35).

significance (response defined as 50% reduction in YMRS; proportion of people who failed to re-
spond: 77/123 [63%] with valproate v 57/125 [46%] with olanzapine; RR of failing to respond 1.27,
95% CI 0.99 to 1.62). The subsequent double-blind RCT found that olanzapine (5–20 mg/day)
significantly improved the YMRS score during the course of the trial and at 47 weeks compared
with valproate (500–2500 mg/day) (248 people with manic or mixed episodes; mean difference in
YMRS change over course of trial: 2.38, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.87; mean YMRS score at 47 weeks:
15.38 with olanzapine v 12.50 with valproate; P = 0.03). [12]  It also found that olanzapine signifi-
cantly reduced median time to remission compared with valproate (remission defined as YMRS
12 or less: 14 days with olanzapine v 62 days with valproate; P = 0.05). However, it found no sig-
nificant difference between treatments in rates of remission over the 47 weeks, or subsequent re-
lapse into mania or depression (AR for remission: 57% with olanzapine v 46% with valproate,
P = 0.10; AR for relapse, defined as YMRS 15 or more: 42% with olanzapine v 56% with valproate,

people who withdrew from the trial because of adverse effects (9/158 [6%] with valproate v 5/163
[3%] with placebo; RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 5.71), but found that people taking valproate were
significantly more likely to suffer from dizziness (13/138 [9%] with valproate v 4/141 [3%] with
placebo; RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.88). [6]  No other adverse effects were more commonly reported
with valproate than with placebo. We found one small observational study (80 women) which re-
ported that valproate additionally contributed significantly to the development of menstrual abnor-
malities and an increase in testosterone levels over time when compared with women suffering
from bipolar disorder in general. [13]  Of 58 women on valproate, 14 (24%) women reported new
onset of menstrual abnormalities following treatment with valproate (P = 0.04).

Valproate versus haloperidol:
The RCT found that, compared with haloperidol, valproate caused significantly fewer extrapyramidal
adverse effects (0/21 [0%] with valproate v 8/15 [53%] with haloperidol; RR 0.04, 95% CI 0 to 0.69),
dry mouth (1/21 [5%] with valproate v 3/15 [20%] with haloperidol; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.07),
and was less likely to cause sedation than haloperidol (1/21 [5%] with valproate v 4/15 [27%] with
haloperidol; RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.44). [6]

Valproate versus olanzapine:
The review found no significant difference between valproate and olanzapine in the proportion of
people who withdrew because of adverse effects (1 RCT: 9/126 [7%] with valproate v 12/125 [10%]
with olanzapine; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.70) or had movement disorders (akathisia: WMD –0.02,
95% CI –0.27 to +0.23; abnormal involuntary movement [using Abnormal Involuntary Movement
Scale]: WMD –0.17, 95% CI –0.62 to +0.28). [6]  It found that valproate caused significantly more
nausea than olanzapine (1 RCT: 36/126 [29%] with valproate v 13/125 [10%] with olanzapine; RR
2.75, 95% CI 1.53 to 4.93), but caused less increased appetite (1 RCT: 3/126 [2%] with valproate
v 15/125 [12%] with olanzapine; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.67), less weight gain (WMD –2.14 kg,
95% CI –2.65 kg to –1.62 kg), less dry mouth (8/126 [6%] with valproate v 42/125 [34%] with
olanzapine; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.39), and less sedation (2 RCTs: 44/189 [23%] with valproate

Valproate versus carbamazepine:
One RCT (28 people identified by the review) assessed adverse effects. [6]  It found no significant
difference in adverse effects between valproate and carbamazepine, but it is likely to have been
underpowered to detect a clinically important difference.

See harms of olanzapine, p 11 .

Comment:

Clinical guide:
There are several formulations of valproic acid available, including sodium valproate, valpromide,
and valproate semisodium (divalproex). Valproate semisodium is the only preparation licensed for
treatment of mania in the UK. In this review, we refer to the generic as valproate because this is
the term in common usage.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Haloperidol versus placebo or versus quetiapine:
We found one three-limbed RCT (302 people, bipolar 1 disorder with manic episode) which compared
12 weeks  treatment with quetiapine (fle xibly dosed up to 800 mg/day), placebo, or haloperidol (up
to 8 mg/day). [16]  It found that Young Mania Rating Scale score significantly improved with quetiapine
compared with placebo at day 21 (–12.29 with quetiapine v –8.32 with placebo; P < 0.01). It found
that haloperidol significantly improved Young Mania Rating Scale score compared with placebo at
day 21 (–15.71 with haloperidol v –8.32 with placebo; P < 0.001). A post hoc analysis found that
there was no significant difference in efficacy measures between quetiapine and haloperidol groups
at any assessment except day 21 (P < 0.05 in favour of haloperidol). However, the RCT reported
that the study was prospectively powered to detect differences between haloperidol or quetiapine
versus placebo, but not differences between quetiapine and haloperidol. [16]  Although the RCT
analysed by intention to treat, the numbers of people completing at day 21 were 66/102 (65%) with
quetiapine, 61/101 (60%) with placebo, and 77/99 (78%) with haloperidol, with the analysis using
the last observation carried forward. The high withdrawal rate may limit the generalisability of the
results.

Haloperidol versus valproate:
See benefits of valproate, p 6 .

Haloperidol versus olanzapine:
We found one double-blind RCT comparing haloperidol (3–15 mg) versus olanzapine (5–20 mg).
[17]  It found no significant difference between treatments in remission or relapse at 6 weeks or time
to remission (219 people; remission defined as Young Mania Rating Scale < 12, AR: 46% with
haloperidol v 52% olanzapine, P = 0.15; relapse defined as Young Mania Rating Scale score > 15,
AR: 14.8% with haloperidol v 13.1% with olanzapine, P = 0.56; median time to remission: 29 days
with haloperidol v 34 days with olanzapine, P = 0.98. There was no significant difference in the
proportion of people receiving benzodiazepines at least once (60% with olanzapine v 65% with
haloperidol, P = 0.33).

Harms:

Haloperidol versus placebo:
We found no RCTs.

Haloperidol versus placebo or versus quetiapine:
The RCT reported that the only common adverse effect with quetiapine was somnolence (13/102
[13%] people), and that no adverse effects in the quetiapine group occurred significantly more than
in the placebo group. [16] The RCT reported that, compared with placebo, haloperidol significantly
increased tremor (30% with haloperidol v 6% with placebo; P < 0.001), akathisia (33% v 6%;
P < 0.001), and extrapyramidal symptoms (35% v 6%; P < 0.001). [16]

by adverse effects (11% with haloperidol v 8% with olanzapine; P = 0.27). [17]  It found that
haloperidol significantly increased extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with olanzapine
(akathisia: 30% with haloperidol v 6% with olanzapine, P < 0.001; extrapyramidal syndrome: 24%
with haloperidol v 2% with olanzapine, P < 0.001). Olanzapine significantly increased somnolence

haloperidol, P = 0.04; weight gain: 14% with olanzapine v 4% with haloperidol, P < 0.001).
Drug safety alert:
Since the last update of this review, a drug safety alert has been issued on cardiovascular side-

Benefits:

Risperidone versus placebo:
We found one systematic review, [18]  one subsequent report of an RCT included in the review, [19]
and one subsequent RCT. [20] The review (search date 2004, people with acute mania) found that
risperidone was significantly more effective than placebo in improving the Young Mania Rating
Scale score (mean change in Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] score: 2 RCTs, 537 people; WMD
–5.75, 95% CI –7.46 to –4.04; P < 0.00001). [18]  One RCT included in the review [18]  as an abstract
was subsequently published in full. [19] This RCT (291 people with mania) compared flexible doses
of risperidone (1–6 mg/day) versus placebo for up to 3 weeks. [19]  Remission was defined as
achieving and maintaining a YMRS score 8 or less for the remainder of the trial or until censor. It
found that remission was achieved by 61/146 (42%) of people receiving risperidone compared with
18/144 (13%) of people receiving placebo. After adjusting for psychosis, baseline YMRS score,
sex, number of mood cycles in the previous year, and treatment, it found that the odds of remission
for people receiving risperidone were significantly higher than those for placebo (logistic regression
analysis: OR 5.6, 95% CI 3.0 to 10.4; P < 0.0001). [19] The subsequent 3-week RCT included 290
current manic or mixed episode people with a score of 20 or more on YMRS. [20]  Risperidone
(1–6 mg/day) was allocated to 146 people and placebo to 144 people. It found that significantly
greater improvements were observed with risperidone than with placebo at weeks 1 and 2 and at
the end point (total YMRS: P < 0.01). [20]

See benefits of lithium, p 3 . See also benefits of valproate, p 6 . We found one systematic review.
[18] The review (search date 2004, people with acute mania) found that risperidone was significantly
more effective than placebo as adjunctive treatment to lithium or an anticonvulsant, measured as
mean change on the YMRS compared with placebo (2 RCTs, 238 people, WMD –5.16, 95% CI
–7.99 to –2.32; P = 0.0004). [18]

Risperidone versus placebo:
The most common adverse effect reported among risperidone patients was somnolence.The review
found a significant increase in sedation with risperidone compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 843
people, RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.96 to 5.86; P < 0.0001). [18]  It also found a greater increase in extrapyra-
midal symptoms measured on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale compared with placebo
(1 RCT, 247 people, WMD 0.6, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.20; P = 0.05). [18]  Although Extrapyramidal
Symptom Rating Scale scores were significantly greater in people receiving risperidone, mean total
and subscale scores were low. [21] The subsequent RCT found that extrapyramidal symptoms
were the most frequently reported adverse effects in the risperidone group (35% in the risperidone
group v 6% with placebo; between group significance not reported). [20]

Risperidone versus lithium:

or more adverse effects (1 RCT, 105 people, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02; P = 0.08). [18]  One
included RCT found that extrapyramidal disorders and hyperkinesias, the most commonly reported
adverse effects with antipsychotic use, occurred less frequently with risperidone than with
haloperidol. [22]

Risperidone added to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine:
See harms of lithium, p 3 . See also harms of valproate, p 20 . The review found no significant

people, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.23; P = 0.66). [18]

Comment:

The systematic review noted high withdrawal rates in some of the included RCTs with an intention-
to-treat analysis being performed by the RCTs using the last observation carried forward. [18]  It
noted that the high withdrawal rates may limit confidence in the results. [18]

agitation) compared 1–3 intramuscular injections of olanzapine (10 mg/10 mg/5 mg), lorazepam
(2 mg/2 mg/1 mg), and placebo. [24]  It found that olanzapine significantly increased the proportion
of people who responded at 2 hours after the first injection compared with placebo (response defined

that ziprasidone significantly increased the proportion of people who responded at 3 weeks compared
with placebo (response defined as a 50% or more reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale score
from baseline: 50% with ziprasidone v 35% with placebo; RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; NNT 6,

episode with Mania Rating Scale score 14 or more) randomised people to ziprasidone (40–80 mg
twice daily; 139 people) or placebo (66 people). [26] The main outcome measure was change in
the Mania Rating Scale score at 3 weeks. [26] The RCT found that ziprasidone significantly improved
symptoms compared with placebo (change from baseline in mean Mania Rating Scale score: –11.1
with ziprasidone v –5.6 with placebo; P < 0.01). [26]  Although the RCT used an intention-to-treat

Benefits:

Quetiapine versus placebo as an add on to valproate:
We found one RCT (30 inpatients aged 12–18 years with bipolar type I disorder) comparing queti-
apine up to 450 mg daily as an adjunctive treatment to valproate (divalproex) versus placebo plus
valproate for 6 weeks. [27]  It found that quetiapine significantly increased the proportion of people
who responded at 6 weeks compared with placebo (response defined as 50% or more reduction
in score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS): 87% with quetiapine v 53% with placebo; RR
1.63, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94).

Quetiapine versus placebo or versus lithium:
We found one double-blind RCT (302 people with mania) which compared quetiapine (flexibly
dosed up to 800 mg/day), placebo, and lithium. [10]  More people in the quetiapine (97/107 [91%])
and lithium (84/98 [85%]) groups completed the study at day 21 compared with the placebo group
(67/97 [69%]). It found that the reduction in YMRS score was significantly greater for quetiapine
compared with placebo at day 7 (–8.03 with quetiapine v –4.89 with placebo; P < 0.01) and day
21 (–14.6 v –6.7; P < 0.001). It found that, compared with placebo, significantly more people with
quetiapine fulfilled YMRS response criteria at day 21 (53% with quetiapine v 27% with placebo;

P < 0.001). It found that lithium-treated patients improved significantly compared with placebo-
treated patients at day 21 (–15.2 with lithium v –6.7 with placebo; P < 0.001). [10]  It found no signif-
icant difference between quetiapine and lithium in YMRS score at 21 days (P value not reported).
However, the RCT reported that it was prospectively powered to detect differences between queti-
apine versus placebo, but not differences between quetiapine and lithium.

Quetiapine versus valproate:
We found one small RCT (50 adolescents with bipolar type I disorder, manic or mixed episode,
YMRS score 20 or more at baseline), which compared quetiapine (400–600 mg/day) versus valproate
(divalproex) (serum level 80–120 microg/mL) for 28 days. [14] The RCT found no significant difference
between quetiapine and valproate in YMRS score at 28 days (between-group difference in change
of YMRS score from baseline: 3.3, 95% CI –3.5 to +10.1). [14]  It reported that YMRS scores improved
more rapidly with quetiapine than with valproate (regression analysis: P = 0.01). [14]  In total, 38/50
(76%) completed the trial, and the analysis was by intention to treat using the last observation
carried forward. This may limit the generalisability of the results.

Harms:

Quetiapine versus placebo:
We found no RCTs.

Quetiapine versus placebo as an add-on to valproate:
The RCT found that quetiapine significantly increased the proportion of adolescents who experienced
sedation compared with placebo (12/15 [80%] with quetiapine v 5/15 [33%] with placebo; P = 0.03).
[27]

Quetiapine versus placebo or versus lithium:
The most common adverse effects for quetiapine were dry mouth (24% with quetiapine v 2% with
placebo v 6% with lithium), somnolence (20% v 3% v 9%), and weight gain (15% v 1% v 6%),
whereas lithium was associated with tremor (6% v 4% v 18%) and insomnia (10% v 20% v 16%;
between-group P values not reported). [10] The quetiapine and placebo groups had similar, low
levels of extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse effects. [10]

Topiramate versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date 2001), which identified one double-blind RCT. [33]
The RCT found no significant difference between topiramate (256 and 512 mg/day) and placebo
in symptoms at 3 weeks (97 people with mania; Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score:
19.6 with 512 mg topiramate v 21.1 with 256 mg topiramate v 23.7 with placebo; difference reported
as not significant, P value and CI not reported). We found one subsequent report of four double-
blind RCTs with similar methods, which compared 659 people with bipolar type I disorder and acute
mania taking topiramate (200–600 mg/day) with 429 people taking placebo, which pooled data. [11]
The core study duration in all RCTs was 3 weeks; three trials also had 9-week double-blind exten-
sions. The primary outcome measure was mean YMRS change over 3 weeks. The study found no
significant difference between topiramate and placebo in YMRS scores (mean YMRS reductions
in the 4 RCTs: range 5.1 to 8.2 with topiramate v range 6.4 to 8.4 with placebo; reported as non
significant, P value not provided). The study reported that a similar pattern was observed after 12
weeks of double-blind treatment in studies with double-blind extensions. [11]

Topiramate versus lithium:
We found one report of two double-blind RCTs comparing 336 people taking topiramate
(200–400 mg/day) with 227 people taking lithium (1500 mg/day) which pooled data (see topiramate
versus placebo section above). [11] The report found that improvement in YMRS scores with lithium
were significantly greater than those with topiramate (absolute figures in analysis not reported;
P < 0.001). [11] The study reported that a similar pattern was observed after 12 weeks of double-
blind treatment in studies with double-blind extensions.

[34]

Topiramate versus placebo:
We found three systematic reviews (search dates 2001 and 2003) in people with mood disorders.
[33]

[35] The first systematic review gave no information on adverse effects. [33] The second
systematic review found no RCTs, but data from identified observational studies suggested that
topiramate may lead to weight reduction in people with mood disorders (3 cohort studies; weight
loss at 1 year [56 people]: 0.7–6.2 kg; weight loss at 4 weeks [14 people]: 1–8 kg; mean weight
loss at 10 weeks [15 people]: 4.2 kg). [35]  One large retrospective study identified by the review
(214 people) found that, over 3 months, 65% of people taking topiramate lost weight.The third review
(search date 2001) of topiramate identified no RCTs in people with bipolar disorder. [34]  It found
that, in people with epilepsy, the most common adverse effects associated with topiramate were
fatigue, dizziness, headache, abnormal thinking, confusion, somnolence, ataxia, impaired concen-
tration, nystagmus, double vision, and anorexia. The subsequent study found that paraesthesia,
appetite decrease, dry mouth, and weight loss were more frequently (3% higher incidence rate or
more) associated with topiramate than with placebo (between-group P values not reported). [11]
The incidence of serious effects was 2% with placebo and 2–7% with topiramate (between-group
P values not reported).

ANTIDEPRESSANTS IN BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Symptoms of depression
Compared with placebo Antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine, imipramine, tranylcypromine, and deprenyl) reduce
the symptoms of depression compared with placebo after 4–10 weeks (high-quality evidence).

Tricyclic  antidepressants  compared  with  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  Tricyclic  antidepressants  may  be
less likely to lead to clinical response after 4–10 weeks comapred with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (mod-
erate-quality evidence).

Adding antidepressants compared with adding second dose of lithium or valproate Adding antidepressants (paroxetine)
to lithium or valproate may be as effective as adding a second dose of lithium or valproate after 6 weeks (low-quality
evidence).

Moclobemide compared with imipramine Moclobemide may be as effective as imipramine at reducing symptoms of
depression (low-quality evidence).

Manic switching
Antidepressants compared with placebo Antidepressants have been associated with manic switching, but the increase
in risk may be low compared with placebo (high-quality evidence).

Tricyclic  antidepressants  compared  with  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors Tricyclic  antidepressants  may  be
more likely than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to induce mania (moderate-quality evidence).

Other adverse effects
SSRIs have been linked to suicidal ideation, persistent pulmonary hypertension in infants born to women who had
taken SSRIs during the latter half of pregnancy, congenital malformations in infants born to women taking paroxetine
during the first trimester of pregnancy, and hyponatraemia.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Antidepressants versus placebo:
We found one systematic review. [36]  It found that antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine,
imipramine, tranylcypromine, and deprenyl) significantly increased treatment response at 4–10
weeks compared with placebo (search date 2003, 4 double-blind RCTs, 662 people with depressive
disorder or mixed episode disorder with at least 1 previous episode of mania; RR of response 1.9,
95% CI 1.5 to 2.3; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 7).

Tricyclic antidepressants versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs):
We found one systematic review. [36]  It found that SSRIs increased clinical response at 4–10 weeks
compared with tricyclic antidepressants; the increase was of borderline significance (search date
2003, 2 RCTs, 69 people; RR clinical response 1.67, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.78; P = 0.05). [36]

Adding antidepressants versus adding lithium or valproate:
We found one small RCT (27 people with mania or bipolar depression receiving lithium or valproate),
which compared the addition of paroxetine versus the addition of a second dose of lithium or val-
proate. It found no significant difference between groups in depressive or manic symptoms over 6
weeks (results presented graphically). [37]

Moclobemide versus imipramine:
We found one double-blind RCT comparing moclobemide (450–750 mg/day) versus imipramine
(150–250 mg/day) in 156 people with bipolar depression. [38] The primary outcome measure was
improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. It found no significant difference be-
tween groups in mean improvement of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (P value not
reported). It also found no significant difference between groups in symptoms measured by the
Montgomery–Asberg Scale, Clinical Global Impression, or in those responding to treatment (defined
as reduction of at least 50% in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and/or a final score of
10 or less). [38]

CI 0.83 to 52.5). [36]  However, the review may have been underpowered to detect a clinically im-
portant difference.

Moclobemide versus imipramine:
The RCT found that anticholinergic adverse effects were significantly more common with imipramine
compared with moclobemide (dry mouth: 16% with moclobemide v 49% with imipramine; constipa-
tion: 5% v 17%; increased sweating: 4% v 11%; P < 0.05), and weight gain was also greater with
imipramine, although this did not reach significance (mean: 0.1 kg loss with moclobemide v 1.2 kg
gain with imipramine; P value not reported). Two people (4%) receiving moclobemide and six
people (11%) receiving imipramine were withdrawn because of manic symptoms, with manic
symptoms occurring earlier on imipramine, although these differences did not reach significance.
[38]

Antidepressant adjunct to mood stabilisers:
We found one study of 159 people with bipolar type I disorder or bipolar type II disorder who par-
ticipated in a total of 228 acute (10-week) drug exposures to bupropion, sertraline, or venlafaxine
as an adjunct to a mood stabiliser. [39] The study reported each drug exposure as a “trial”. People
in 87 of these “trials” entered continuation treatment for up to 1 year. The study reported that
threshold switches into full duration hypomania and mania occurred in 11% and 8% respectively
of the acute treatment trials, and in 22% and 15% respectively of the continuation trials. It found
that the rate of threshold switches was higher in the 169 trials in people with bipolar I disorder
(31%) than in the 59 trials in people with bipolar type II disorder (19%). It concluded that adjunctive
treatment with antidepressants in bipolar depression was associated with substantial risks of
threshold switches to full duration hypomania or mania in both acute and long-term continuation
treatment. Of the three included antidepressants, venlafaxine was associated with the highest rel-
ative risk of such switching, and bupropion with the lowest risk. [39]  Limitations to the interpretation
of this study include: the generalisability of data from the academically-based outpatient cohort to
all people with bipolar disease; that 25% of people in the study had a history of rapid recycling;
that some people were taking more than one antidepressant; and the lack of a placebo group. [39]

Suicidal ideation:
We found one cohort study which analysed the first 2000 people who completed 18 months' follow-
up in a systematic treatment enhancement programme for bipolar disorder. [40] The study cohort
comprised 425 people with a prospectively observed new-onset major depressive episode without
suicidal ideation. Of these, 24 (6%) developed new onset suicidality, and two made suicide attempts.
[40] The cohort found no association of new-onset suicidality with increased antidepressant exposure,
or with the initiation of antidepressant treatment. However, these observations were based on only
24 people with new-onset suicidality.

Drug alert:
SSRIs have been linked to suicidal ideation in general (see reporting above). Other alerts and revised
prescribing information regarding SSRIs include the increased risk of persistent pulmonary hyper-
tension in infants born to women who had taken SSRIs during the latter half of pregnancy; the in-
creased risk of congenital malformations in infants born to women taking paroxetine during the first
trimester of pregnancy, and the potential for SSRIs to cause hyponatraemia, especially in elderly
(see review on depression in adults: drug and physical treatments).

Comment:

Clinical guide:
The evidence for treatment of unipolar depression (see review on depression in adults: drug and
physical treatments) is believed to be applicable, although the efficacy of the treatments may be
different, and specific adverse effects such as antidepressant-induced mania should be considered.

in people with bipolar depression (see comment below). [41]

Harms:

We found no good RCTs.

Comment:

The review identified one crossover trial in people with depression (35 people, 24 with bipolar de-
pression). [41]  Participants were randomised to placebo before and after being crossed over to
carbamazepine over 45 days. The trial found that carbamazepine improved symptoms in 62% of
people over a mean 45 days.

LAMOTRIGINE IN BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Symptoms of depression
Compared  with  placebo  Lamotrigine  may  reduce  symptoms,  and  increases  the  response  rate  compared  with
placebo after 7 weeks in people with bipolar type I disorder experiencing a depressive episode (moderate-quality
evidence).

Adverse effects
Lamotrigine 200 mg has been associated with headaches.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

We found one systematic review (search date 2000), [41]  which identified one RCT (195 people
aged 19–75 years with bipolar type I disorder experiencing a major depressive episode). [42] The
RCT compared three treatments: lamotrigine 200 mg daily, lamotrigine 50 mg daily, and placebo.
[42]  It found no significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo in Hamilton Depression
Rating Scale score over 7 weeks, but found that lamotrigine 200 mg daily significantly improved
Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale score (mean reduction: –13.3 with lamotrigine v
–7.8 with placebo; P < 0.05) and increased the proportion of people who responded to treatment
(measured by Clinical Global Impression Scale scores: mean change: 2.6 with lamotrigine v 3.3
with placebo; P < 0.05).

Harms:

The RCT found that significantly more people had headache with lamotrigine 200 mg compared
with placebo (20/63 [32%] with lamotrigine 200 mg v 11/65 [17%] with placebo; P < 0.05). [42]

TOPIRAMATE IN BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Symptoms of depression
Compared  with  bupropion Topiramate  may  be  as  effective  as  bupropion  at  reducing  symptoms  of  depression  in
people also taking lithium or valproate after 8 weeks (low-quality evidence).

Note
We found no direct information about whether or not topicamate is better than no active treatment in people with
bipolar depression.

Adverse effects
Topiramate  is  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  adverse  effects  including  anxiety,  increase  or  decrease  in  appetite,
blurred vision, backache, headache, and nausea.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Topiramate versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date 2001), which identified no RCTs. [34]

Topiramate versus bupropion:
We found one systematic review, which identified no RCTs. [34] We found one subsequent RCT
(36 people with bipolar depression, all taking lithium or valproate) comparing topiramate versus
bupropion. [43]  It found that both topiramate and bupropion significantly improved Clinical Global
Impression scores from baseline at 8 weeks. It found no significant difference between treatments
(P = 0.092; absolute numbers not reported).

Harms:

Topiramate versus placebo:
We found no RCTs. [34]

Topiramate versus bupropion:
The subsequent RCT found that 6/18 (33%) of people taking topiramate and 4/33 (22%) of people

QUETIAPINE IN BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . New

Symptoms of depression
Compared with placebo Quetiapine reduces symptoms of depression compared with placebo after 8 weeks (moderate-
quality evidence).

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

We found one RCT (542 people with bipolar type I [360 people] or bipolar type II [182 people] dis-
order experiencing a major depressive episode), which compared quetiapine (600 or 300 mg/day)
versus placebo for 8 weeks. [44] The primary outcome was mean change in the Montgomery–Asberg
Rating Scale score at 8 weeks. The RCT found that quetiapine at either dosage significantly im-
proved Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale score compared with placebo at all weekly
assessments (either dose of quetiapine v placebo; P < 0.001 at every weekly assessment from
1–8 weeks). [44]  It found that quetiapine at either dosage significantly improved Montgomery–Asberg
Depression Rating Scale score compared with placebo at 8 weeks (mean change from baseline
to 8 weeks: –16.73 with quetiapine 600 mg/day v –16.39 with quetiapine 300 mg/day v –10.26 with
placebo; either dose v placebo, P < 0.001). [44] The number of people completing the study at 8
weeks was 98/180 (54%) with quetiapine 600 mg daily, 121/181 (67%) with quetiapine 300 mg
daily, and 107/181 (59%) with placebo. Analysis was by intention to treat with the last observation
carried forward to the analysis.

Harms:

The RCT reported that treatment-emergent mania rates were low, and similar for the quetiapine
and placebo groups (3.2% and 3.9%, respectively). [44]  It found that, compared with placebo,
quetiapine at either dose significantly increased dry mouth (41% with quetiapine 600 mg/day v
44% with quetiapine 300 mg/day v 8% with placebo), sedation (32% v 30% v 6%), somnolence
(24% v 27% v 8%), dizziness (23% v 17% v 8%), and constipation (11% v 12% v 4%; all P values

Comment:

We found one systematic review (search date 2003, 3 RCTs reporting relapse, see comments),
[45] one subsequent RCT  [46]  and one extended follow up report of one of the included RCTs. [47]
The review did not perform a meta-analysis. In all three RCTs, cognitive therapy was adapted for
bipolar disorder and included advice on medication compliance, self monitoring of symptoms, es-
tablishing routine, and ensuring sufficient sleep to reduce risk of relapse. The first RCT included
in the review (42 outpatients aged 18 years or more with bipolar type I disorder who had experienced
at least 1 episode of mania/hypomania or bipolar depression in the preceding 2 years, most taking
lithium alone or in combination with another mood stabiliser) compared cognitive therapy versus
usual care for 6 months followed by cognitive therapy. [48]  It found no significant difference between
cognitive therapy and usual care in the proportion of people who relapsed over 6 months, although
fewer people receiving cognitive therapy relapsed (1/21 [5%] with cognitive therapy v 2/21 [10%]
with usual care; P = 0.06). The RCT is likely to have been underpowered to detect a clinically im-
portant difference, and the overall the rate of relapse in this RCT was low. The second RCT (103
outpatients, aged 18–70 years with bipolar type I disorder not currently suffering from mania or
bipolar depression, who had experienced 2 or more mood episodes in the preceding 2 years or 3
episodes in the preceding 5 years, all taking lithium, carbamazepine, or valproate sodium) compared
cognitive therapy versus usual care for 1 year. [49]  Cognitive therapy was given for 12–18 sessions
over the first 6 months, followed by two additional sessions in the following 6 months. The RCT
found that cognitive therapy significantly reduced the proportion of people who relapsed over 12
months (21/48 [44%] with cognitive therapy v 36/48 [75%] with usual care; HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21
to 0.74). The third RCT (25 outpatients aged 18–70 years with bipolar type I disorder, not currently
suffering from mania or bipolar depression, who had experienced 2 or more mood episodes in the
preceding 2 years or 3 episodes in the last 5 years) compared 12–20 sessions of cognitive therapy
versus routine care for 6 months (see comment below). [50]  It found that cognitive therapy signifi-
cantly reduced relapse over 6 months compared with usual care (RR 0.23, CI not reported;
P < 0.001, absolute numbers not reported). We found one subsequent RCT involving 253 people
with bipolar disorder, in which treatment as usual was compared with an additional 22 sessions of
cognitive behavioural therapy plus treatment as usual. [46]  People were assessed every 8 weeks
for 18 months. The RCT found that more than half of participants had a recurrence by 18 months
(53% with cognitive behavioural therapy v 51% with treatment as usual), but found no significant
differences between groups (HR 1.05, 95% Cl 0.74 to 1.50). A post hoc analysis found that adjunctive
cognitive behavioural therapy was significantly more effective than treatment as usual in those with
fewer than 12 previous episodes, but less effective in those with more episodes. [46] We found one
extended follow-up [47]  of an already reported RCT. [50]  It presented an additional 18 months of
follow-up data in addition to the initial 12 months follow-up of the original RCT. It found that, although
the cognitive therapy plus usual care group exhibited significantly better mood ratings, social
functioning, coping with bipolar prodromes, and dysfunctional goal attainment cognition compared
with usual care alone, cognitive therapy had no significant effect in relapse reduction over the last
18 months of the study period. [47]

The first RCT identified by the review [45]  found that there was one suicide in the people treated
with cognitive therapy. [48] The review gave no information on adverse effects. [45] The subsequent
RCT did not report on adverse effects. [46]

The systematic review also identified a fourth RCT (28 people taking lithium), which compared
cognitive therapy with standard treatment for 6 weeks, but it only assessed compliance with lithium,
and its reporting of results was unclear. [45]

Benefits:

[51]

We found one systematic review (search date 2003, 2 RCTs) and one subsequent RCT. [45]
The review did not conduct a meta-analysis. The first RCT included in the review (69 outpatients
with bipolar disorder who had relapsed in the previous year) compared an educational programme
to recognise symptoms of relapse versus treatment as usual over 18 months. [52]  It found that
people in the educational programme were significantly less likely to suffer a manic relapse over
18 months compared with people receiving usual care (9/33 [27%] with educational programme v
20/35 [57%] with usual care; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.86; NNT 4, 95% CI 2 to 16), but may have
been more likely to suffer from a depressive episode (18/33 [55%] with educational programme v
13/35 [37%] with usual care; RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.54), although the difference was not signif-
icant. It found that, compared with usual care, the educational programme significantly improved
social function from baseline at 18 months (measured on a 4-point scale assessing 8 areas of social
activity, where 0 = fair/good performance and 4 = inability to carry out function; mean difference in
score 1.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.23). [52] The second RCT identified by the review compared group
psychoeducation plus standard pharmacological treatment versus non-structured group meetings
plus standard pharmacological treatment (control) for 14 weeks. [45]  It found that the psychoeduca-
tional intervention significantly reduced recurrence at 2 years compared with control (single blind
RCT, 120 people in remission with bipolar type I or type II disorder; recurrence during treatment:
38% with psychoeducation v 60% with control, P = 0.01; recurrence during follow-up: 67% with
psychoeducation v 92% with control, P < 0.001). One subsequent RCT compared group psychoe-
ducation plus standard pharmacological treatment versus non-structured group meetings plus
standard pharmacological treatment (control) for 20 weeks. [51]  It is not clear whether the people
in this RCT were a subset of the people in the RCT with 120 people reported above. It found that
the psychoeducational intervention significantly reduced recurrence and hospitalisations at 2 years
compared with control (50 highly compliant people with bipolar type I disorder; recurrence defined
as Young Mania Rating Scale score at least 12, AR: 15/25 [60%] with intervention v 23/25 [92%]
with control, P < 0.01; hospitalisation: 2/25 [8%] with intervention v 9/25 [36%] with control, P = 0.01).

Harms:

The review and the subsequent RCT gave no information on adverse effects. [45]
[51] The first
RCT identified by the review [45]  found that, compared with usual care, education may increase
depressive relapse (see benefits above). [52]

FAMILY-FOCUSED PSYCHOEDUCATION TO PREVENT RELAPSE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Relapse

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

[54]

[55]

We found no systematic review but found two RCTs (reported in three publications). [53]
The first RCT (101 people with bipolar disorder who had recently recovered from an acute episode
recruited from inpatient and outpatient facilities, all taking antipsychotic drugs) compared 21 sessions
of family-focused psychoeducation versus two family sessions plus crisis management over 12
months. [53]  Family-focused psychoeducation involved: education about the symptoms, causes,
and treatment of bipolar disorder; education to recognise symptoms of relapse; preparation of a
relapse prevention plan; and training in problem solving and communication skills. Crisis manage-
ment involved emergency counselling sessions as needed, with a minimum of a monthly telephone
call. The RCT found that family-focused psychoeducation significantly reduced the proportion of
people who relapsed over 12 months compared with family session plus crisis management (HR
1.47, CI not reported; P = 0.042). [53]  Interventions lasted for 9 months, and people remained on
drug treatment for 2 years. Longer-term follow-up of this RCT showed that the significant reduction
in relapse rate with family-focused psychoeducation was also present at 2 years (11/31 [35%] with
family-focused psychoeducation v 38/70 [54%] with control; P < 0.005). [55]  It found that family-fo-
cused psychoeducation significantly increased time to relapse compared with control (HR for relapse
0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.75). The second RCT (53 people with bipolar type I disorder hospitalised
after a manic episode, all taking lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, or a combination with or without
antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs [not specified]) compared family-focused psychoeducation
versus individual-focused therapy for 12 months' treatment. [54]  It found no significant difference
in the proportion of people who relapsed over the 12-month treatment period (46% with family fo-

LITHIUM TO PREVENT RELAPSE. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Relapse of mania
Compared with placebo Lithium reduces the rate of relapse of mania compared with placebo after 2 years (moderate-
quality evidence).

Compared with olanzapine Lithium may be less effective at preventing relapse of mania compared with olanzapine
after 52 weeks (low-quality evidence).

Relapse of depression
Compared  with  placebo  Lithium  does  not  reduce  the  rate  of  relapse  of  depression  after  2  years  compared  with
placebo (moderate-quality evidence).

Compared with olanzapine Lithium may be as effective as olanzapine at preventing relapse of depression after 52
weeks (low-quality evidence).

Relapse of mania or depression
Compared with valproate Lithium is as effective as valproate at reducing relapse rates after 12 months (high-quality
evidence).

Compared with carbamazepine Lithium may be as effective as carbamazepine at reducing relapse rates after 2–3
years (low-quality evidence).

Compared with lamotrigine Lithium is as effective as lamotrigine at preventing relapse (high-quality evidence).

Compared with olanzapine Lithium is as effective as olanzapine at preventing relapse after 52 weeks (moderate-
quality evidence).

Compared with antidepressants Lithium may be more effective than tricyclic antidepressants at preventing relapse
after 1–2 years (low-quality evidence).

Adverse effects
Lithium is associated with adverse effects diarrhoea, somnolence, tremor, and hypothyroidism. Lithium may cause
more adverse effects than carbamazepine or lamotrigine, and increases polyuria, thirst, and diarrhoea, but decreases
sedation and infection rates, compared with valproate.

For GRADE evaluation of interventions for bipolar disorder, see table, p 34 .

Benefits:

Lithium versus placebo:
We found one systematic review in people with bipolar disorder, unipolar disorder, or mixed
unipolar/bipolar disorder, [56]  and three subsequent RCTs, two of which were analysed together
[58] The review (search date not stated, 5 RCTs, 770 people
in a pre-planned pooled analysis. [57]
with bipolar disorder) found that lithium was more effective than placebo in preventing any relapse
(RR 0.65, 95% Cl 0.50 to 0.84) or manic relapse (RR 0.62, 95% Cl 0.40 to 0.95). [56]  Although
there was a trend towards reduction of depressive relapses with lithium, this reduction did not reach
significance (RR 0.72, 95% Cl 0.49 to 1.07). The first two subsequent RCTs recruited people with
bipolar type I disorder who had recently been depressed or manic, but had stabilised (Clinical
Global Impression Severity of Illness score at least 3 for previous 4 weeks) after taking lamotrigine
for 8 weeks. [57] The RCTs compared placebo, lithium (serum level of 0.8–1.1 mEq/L), and lamot-
rigine (50–400 mg/day fixed dose or 100–400 mg/day flexible dose) over 18 months. Pre-planned
pooled analysis of these RCTs found that lithium significantly increased time to intervention for any
mood episode compared with placebo (2 RCTs with 3 arms each, with 638 participants in total;
median time to intervention: 184 days with lithium v 86 days with placebo; P < 0.001). Secondary
analyses suggested that lithium protected against manic but not depressive relapse. The third
subsequent RCT compared three treatments for up to 18 months: lithium (0.8–1.1 mEq/L), lamot-
rigine (50–400 mg/day), and placebo. [58]  Only people who stabilised on lamotrigine after gradual
withdrawal of concomitant drugs during an open-label run-in phase were included. It found that
lithium significantly increased time to intervention for any mood episode compared with placebo

Lithium versus carbamazepine:
We found one systematic review [60]  (search date not reported, 10 RCTs, 572 people with unipolar
or bipolar disorder) and one subsequent RCT [61]  comparing lithium versus carbamazepine. The
review found no significant difference between lithium and carbamazepine in the proportion of
people who relapsed over 1–3 years (60% with lithium v 55% with carbamazepine; reported as
non-significant; no further data reported; see comment below). [60] The subsequent RCT (94 out-
patients aged 18 years and over with bipolar disorder, who had experienced at least 2 mood
episodes in the preceding 3 years) compared lithium (blood level 0.6–1.0 mmol/L) versus carba-
mazepine (blood level 6–10 mg/L) for 2 years of treatment. [61]  It found no significant difference
between lithium and carbamazepine in the proportion of people who relapsed over 2 years (relapse
defined as developing an episode of mania or bipolar depression: 12/44 [27%] with lithium v 21/50
[42%] with carbamazepine; RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.78). A pre-planned subgroup analysis sug-
gested that lithium was more effective in people who were randomised when euthymic.

Lithium versus lamotrigine:
We found no systematic review but found three RCTs, two of which were analysed together in a
pre-planned pooled analysis. [57]
[58] The first two subsequent RCTs were in people with bipolar
type I disorder who had recently been depressed or manic, but had stabilised after taking lamotrigine
for 8 weeks (see benefits of Lithium versus placebo above for details). [57]  Pooled analysis of these
two RCTs found no significant difference between lithium and lamotrigine in the time to intervention
for any mood episode (638 people; median survival: 184 days v 197 days with lamotrigine; P = 0.63).
Secondary analysis found that lithium reduced manic relapse compared with lamotrigine (P = 0.03).
The third RCT (463 people) compared three treatments: lithium, lamotrigine, and placebo (see
benefits of Lithium versus placebo above for details). [58]  It found no significant difference between
lithium and lamotrigine for time to intervention for any mood episode (median: 170 days with lithium
v 200 days with lamotrigine; P = 0.92). [58]

Lithium versus olanzapine:

Lithium versus placebo:
The systematic review found that overall withdrawals were less common with lithium than with
placebo (absolute figures not reported; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.93). [56]  Lithium significantly in-
creased diarrhoea (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.10), nausea (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.92), and
somnolence (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.84) compared with placebo. There was an increase in
hypothyroidism with lithium compared with placebo, but this did not reach significance (RR 9.26,
95% CI 0.03 to 169.91). The pooled analysis of two RCTs comparing lithium, lamotrigine, and
placebo found no evidence that lithium caused affective switch. [57]  It found that lithium significantly
increased withdrawal caused by adverse effects compared with placebo (30/167 [18%] with lithium
v 15/191 [8%] with placebo; P < 0.01). Compared with placebo, lithium also significantly increased
nausea (20% v 11%; P < 0.05), somnolence (13% v 7%; P < 0.05), diarrhoea (19% v 8%; P < 0.05),
and tremor (15% v 5%; P < 0.05). The subsequent RCT (463 people) found no significant difference
between lithium and placebo in withdrawal caused by adverse effects (16% with lithium v 10% with
placebo; P = 0.076). [58] The most common adverse effect was headache, but the incidence was
similar for lithium and placebo (19% with lithium v 21% with placebo; P value not reported). It found
that lithium increased somnolence and tremor compared with placebo (somnolence: 13% with
lithium v 6% with placebo; tremor: 17% with lithium v 5% with placebo; P < 0.05 for both).

Lithium versus valproate:
The review found that valproate was significantly more likely than lithium to cause sedation (1 RCT:
78/187 [42%] with valproate v 24/91 [26%] with lithium; RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) and infection
(type of infection not specified, 1 RCT: 51/187 [27%] with valproate v 12/91 [13%] with lithium; RR
2.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.7), but significantly less likely to cause polyuria (15/187 [8%] with valproate v
17/91 [19%] with lithium; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8), thirst (11/187 [6%] with valproate v 14/91

Lithium versus carbamazepine:
The review gave no information on adverse effects. [60]  One RCT (144 people with bipolar disorder)
identified by the review found that, although more people taking carbamazepine than taking lithium
withdrew from the trials (9/70 [13%] with carbamazepine v 4/74 [5%] with lithium; reported as non-
significant; no further data reported), a significantly higher proportion of people taking lithium
compared with carbamazepine had “slight or moderate” adverse effects over 2.5 years (21% with
carbamazepine v 61% with lithium; P < 0.001). [62] The subsequent RCT found that blurred vision,
difficulty concentrating, thirst, hand tremor, and muscle weakness were more common with lithium
than with carbamazepine. [61]  Increased appetite was more common with carbamazepine.

The pooled analysis of two RCTs found that lithium significantly increased withdrawal caused by
adverse effects compared with lamotrigine (30/167 [18%] with lithium v 23/280 [8%] with lamotrigine;
P < 0.01). It found that lithium significantly increased diarrhoea (19% with lithium v 7% with lamot-
rigine; P < 0.05) and tremor (15% with lithium v 4% with lamotrigine; P < 0.05) compared with
lamotrigine. [57] There was no evidence that either active treatment caused affective switch. The
second RCT found that lithium significantly increased diarrhoea and tremor compared with lamot-
rigine (diarrhoea: 16% with lithium v 7% with lamotrigine; tremor: 17% with lithium v 5% with lam-
otrigine; P < 0.05 for both). [58]

Relapse
Compared with placebo Valproate may reduce relapse rates after 12 months compared with placebo (low-quality

Compared with lithium Valproate is as effective as lithium at reducing relapse rates after 12 months (high-quality
evidence).

Adverse effects
Valproate has been associated with tremor, weight gain, and alopecia. It may cause more sedation and infection
than lithium, but less polyuria, thirst, and diarrhoea.

Harms:

Valproate versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date not reported, 1 RCT, 372 people with bipolar disorder)
comparing valproate, lithium, and placebo. [59]  It found that valproate significantly reduced relapse
over 12 months compared with placebo (relapse defined as withdrawal because of an episode of
bipolar disorder: 45/187 [24%] with valproate v 36/94 [38%] with placebo; RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to
0.9), but found no significant difference in time to relapse (P = 0.33; no further data reported).

Valproate versus lithium:
See benefits of lithium, p 19 .

Valproate versus placebo:
The review found that valproate was significantly more likely than placebo to cause tremor (RR
3.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 5.6), weight gain (RR 2.9, 95% 1.3 to 6.2), alopecia (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.7),
and nausea (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.9). [59] We also found one case control study (32 women
aged 15–45 years with bipolar disorder), which found that 8/17 (47%) women taking valproate had
current menstrual irregularities compared with 2/15 (13%) women not taking valproate. [64]

Benefits:

Carbamazepine versus placebo:
We found one systematic review (search date not stated), which identified one RCT. [65] The small
RCT identified by the review (22 people during remission of bipolar disorder) found no significant
difference in effectiveness between carbamazepine and placebo at 1 year (effectiveness not further

analysis of these RCTs found that lamotrigine delayed time to intervention for any mood episode
compared with placebo (median survival: 197 days with lamotrigine v 86 days with placebo;
P < 0.05). The third RCT (182 people with rapid cycling bipolar disorder (see table 1, p 33 ) found
no significant difference between lamotrigine and placebo in the time to requiring additional medi-

(0.8–1.1 mEq/L), lamotrigine (50–400 mg/day), and placebo. [58]  It found that lamotrigine signifi-
cantly increased time to intervention for any mood episode compared with placebo (median for

Benefits:

We found one systematic review (search date 2000; 4 RCTs, 258 people with bipolar type I or type
II disorder) comparing tricyclic antidepressants versus placebo or lithium. [68] The review did not
perform a meta-analysis or quantify its conclusions. It provided a narrative overview of the studies,
and found no clear evidence that tricyclic antidepressants reduce relapse over 1–2 years compared
with placebo. It suggested that tricyclic antidepressants may be less effective in preventing relapse
over 1–2 years than lithium.

Olanzapine versus placebo:
We found one double-blind RCT (361 people) in which people achieving symptomatic remission
from a manic or mixed episode of bipolar type I disorder following 6–12 weeks of open-label acute
treatment with 5–20 mg daily of olanzapine were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind
maintenance treatment with olanzapine (225 people) or placebo (136 people) for up to 48 weeks.
[69] The primary outcome was time to symptomatic relapse into any mood disorder. The RCT found
that olanzapine significantly increased the time to relapse compared with placebo (median: 174
days with olanzapine v 22 days with placebo; P < 0.001), and significantly decreased the proportion
of people with symptomatic relapse into any mood disorder compared with placebo (105/225 [47%]
with olanzapine v 109/136 [80%] with placebo; OR 4.61, 95% CI 2.81 to 7.58). [69]

Olanzapine plus mood stabiliser versus mood stabiliser alone:
We found one RCT (99 people) in which bipolar patients achieving syndromic remission after 6
weeks' treatment with olanzapine plus either lithium (0.6–1.2 mmol/L) or valproate (50–125 mi-
crog/ml) were randomised to receive lithium or valproate plus either olanzapine 5–20 mg daily or
placebo. [70] They were followed in a double-blind trial for 18 months. [70] The RCT defined syndromic
relapse as meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  IV (DSM-IV) criteria for
a manic mixed, or depressive episode, and symptomatic relapse by using the total score on the
Young Mania Rating Scale (15 or greater) and the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression
(15 or greater). The RCT found that the treatment difference in time to relapse into either mania
or depression was not significant between groups for syndromic relapse (median time to relapse:
94 days with olanzapine plus mood stabilisers v 40.5 days with placebo plus mood stabilisers;
P = 0.742), but was significant for symptomatic relapse (163 days v 42 days; P = 0.023). [70]

Olanzapine versus lithium:
We found one RCT (431 people) of bipolar patients receiving open-label co-treatment with olanza-
pine and lithium for 6–12 weeks. [63] Those meeting symptomatic remission criteria were randomly
assigned to 52 weeks of double-blind monotherapy with olanzapine (5–20 mg/day; 217 people) or
lithium (target blood level 0.6–1.2 meq/L; 214 people). The RCT found that symptomatic relapse/re-
currence (score 15 or more on the Young Mania Rating Scale or Hamilton depression scale) occurred
in 65/217 (30%) of olanzapine treated people compared with 83/214 (39%) of lithium treated people
(P = 0.055). In a subgroup analysis, the RCT found that, compared with lithium, olanzapine had
significantly lower risks of manic episode and mixed episode relapse/recurrence (mania, P < 0.02;
mixed, P < 0.005), but found no significant difference between groups in depression recurrence
(P = 0.15).

Olanzapine versus placebo:
The RCT reported that during the open-label phase, people gained a mean of 3 kg in weight. [69]
After randomisation, people with placebo lost a mean of 2 kg, whereas those on olanzapine gained
an additional 1 kg. We found one further analysis of a 3-week RCT of olanzapine for people with
mania, which was then followed by open continuation treatment with olanzapine for up to a year.
[71]  Among 113 people treated with olanzapine for a mean of 28 weeks, body mass index (BMI)
increased from a baseline mean of 28.8 kg/m2, by 7.9% (P < 0.001), into the obese range (31.0 kg/m2
). It found that BMI increased significantly more among 40 people achieving symptomatic recovery
than in the 73 who did not (P = 0.004). It reported that, on average, serum cholesterol increased
4.8 times more (18% v 4%; P = 0.002) and endpoint cholesterol levels were greater (risk of total
serum cholesterol newly 240 mg/dL or more: RR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.0) in people with above av-
erage BMI gain, and this group also experienced significantly larger increases in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, pulse rates, and non-fasting serum glucose than people who had low BMI gain.
[71]

Olanzapine plus mood stabiliser versus mood stabiliser alone:
The RCT found a similar incidence of adverse effects between groups, with the exception of insomnia
(4% of people in olanzapine group v 27% of people in mood-stabilisers-alone group; risk difference
–23.2, 95% CI –36.8 to –9.5) and weight gain (20% of people in olanzapine group v 6% of people
in mood-stabilisers-alone group; risk difference 13.4, 95% CI 0.5 to 26.2). [70]

Olanzapine versus lithium:
The RCT reported that, compared with lithium, olanzapine significantly increased depression (21%
with olanzapine v 12% with lithium; P = 0.01) and hypersomnia (3% v 0%; P = 0.03), and deceased
insomnia (8% v 22%; P < 0.001), worsening of mania (8% v 21%, P < 0.001), and nausea (0.5%
v 3.7%; P = 0.02). [63]  It found that mean weight gain during open-label co-treatment was 2.7 kg;
during double-blind monotherapy, weight gain was significantly greater with olanzapine than with
lithium (mean: +1.8 kg with olanzapine v –1.4 kg with lithium; P < 0.001). [63]

GLOSSARY
Cognitive therapy Brief (20 sessions over 12–16 weeks) structured treatment aimed at changing the dysfunctional
beliefs and negative automatic thoughts that characterise depressive disorders. It requires a highly trained therapist.
Manic switching involves onset of a manic episode shortly after treatment for a depressive episode. It may be more
likely after treatment with antidepressants.
Relapse A return of symptoms to the extent that the disorder again meets criteria for the full syndromes. In practice,
people with bipolar disorder learn to recognise early warning signs and begin treatment before criteria are met. For
this reason, relapse is often pragmatically defined as the need for drug treatment due to re-emergence of depressive
or manic symptoms.
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is a checklist of 11 manic symptoms, rated on a scale of 0–4 (7 symptoms) or
0–8 (4 symptoms); a higher score indicates greater symptom severity. Individual scores are summed to give a total
score of 0–60. The scale was designed to be administered by clinicians and to measure the severity of manic
symptoms, and to be sensitive to the effects of treatments on manic symptoms. The items were selected based on
the core symptoms of mania and were developed to follow the style of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
High-quality evidence Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Low-quality evidence Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate
of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Moderate-quality evidence Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate
of effect and may change the estimate.
Very low-quality evidence Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
