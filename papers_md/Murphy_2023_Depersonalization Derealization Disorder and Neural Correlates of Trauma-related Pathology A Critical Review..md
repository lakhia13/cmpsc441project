Depersonalization/Derealization 
Disorder and Neural Correlates 
of Trauma-related Pathology: 
A Critical Review

ABSTRACT

by RACHAEL J. MURPHY, MD
Dr. Murphy is with the Department of Psychiatry at Lehigh Valley Health Network in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Depersonalization and derealization refer to an 
estranged state of mind that involves a profound 
feeling of detachment from one’s sense of self 
and the surrounding environment, respectively. 
The phenomena co-occur on a continuum of 
severity, ranging from a transient experience 
as a normal reaction to a traumatic event to a 
highly debilitating condition with persistent 
symptoms, formally described as depersonalization/
derealization disorder (DPDR). Lack of awareness 
of DPDR is partly due to a limited neurobiological 
framework, and there remains a signifi cant risk of 
misdiagnosis in clinical practice. Earlier literature 
has focused on several brain regions involved in the 
experience of depersonalization and derealization, 
including adaptive responses to stress via defense 
cascades comprising autonomic functioning, 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 
and various other neurocircuits. Recent evidence 
has also demonstrated the role of more complex 
mechanisms that are bolstered by dissociative 
features, such as emotional dysregulation and 
disintegration of the body schema. This review 
intends to abridge the prevailing knowledge 
regarding structural and functional brain alterations 
associated with DPDR with that of its heterogenic 
manifestations. DPDR is not merely the disruption 
of various sensory integrations, but also of 
several large-scale brain networks. Although a 
comprehensive antidote is not available for DPDR, 
a holistic route to the neurobiological context in 
DPDR may improve general understanding of the 
disorder and help affl  icted individuals re-establish 
their sense of personal identity. Such information 
may also be useful in the development of novel 
pharmacological agents and targeted psychological 
interventions.

FFirst coined by Ludovic Dugas in 1898,1

the term depersonalization is defi ned as 
detachment from one’s sense of personal 
identity, wherein subjects experience 
themselves as outside observers of their own 
behaviors, emotions, and bodily sensations.2
Likewise, in derealization, one’s environment 
is perceived as “dreamlike, empty, lifeless, 
or visually distorted.”3 Because the two 
states typically co-occur and there is no 
demonstrable evidence to support that they 
exist independently of one another, a single 
identifi cation, called depersonalization/
derealization disorder (DPDR), has been 
formally acknowledged by the American 
Psychiatric Association (APA) and the 
International Classifi cation of Diseases (ICD). 
Patients with DPDR often have great diffi  culty 
putting their experiences into words. There 
is often extremely diminished emotional 
responsivity, or deaff ectualization.3,4 Important 
memories and personal values seem to no 
longer belong to oneself, which can provoke 
intrusive existential ruminations.5 Consider the 
account of one writer with DPDR: “…I viewed 
my actions, my internal and external lives, 
as if observing from the grave. I was visible 
but not present. And I could fi nd no one, 
no other human who felt as I did.”6 Though 
patients with DPDR may have a drastic change 
in their subjective experience, this change 
is challenging to measure on psychiatric 
evaluation. These patients display intact reality 

testing, preserved emotional expression, and 
no evidence of psychosis. Since patients can 
interact and respond appropriately throughout 
the interview, appropriate assessment of the 
severity of the disorder is often missed by 
behavioral health providers.7 Nevertheless, 
patients are acutely aware of their problem. 
One stated, “I was not crazy because I knew 
that something was not right from the 
very moment that it became not right.”6
Interestingly, experimental psychiatrist Oscar 
Janiger described DPDR as the opposite of 
insanity: “It’s like being ’too’ sane, you become 
hypervigilant of your existence and the things 
around you.”6

The phenomenon of depersonalization/
derealization has received some of the least 
attention in psychiatric research, despite 
there being a high rate of lifetime prevalence 
in the general population; epidemiological 
studies show between 26 and 74 percent 
of individuals have short-term symptoms.8
Brief and mild episodes of depersonalization/
derealization, lasting from hours to days, are 
typically not abnormal and may ensue as a 
transient reaction toward excess fatigue and 
stress. Episodes may be apparent when there 
are circadian rhythm shifts, such as with jet 
lag, or during psychoactive drug use, including 
alcohol.9 Although these characteristics might 
be benefi cial in endangering situations, as 
per evolutionary perspectives, they might be 
equally hindering in day-to-day life activities.3

FIGURE 1. Recent studies on dissociation have investigated the neurophysiology of trauma responses. A. Classical or 
nondissociative patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) demonstrate activity associated with hyperarousal; 
the corresponding brain activity is lessened ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) inhibition of limbic activity. B. The 
dissociative subtype of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD+DS) demonstrates the opposite pattern of activity, involving 
overmodulation of limbic activity via vmPFC hyperactivation.

Depersonalization/derealization can emerge 
as a secondary symptom of other psychiatric 
conditions, such as borderline personality 
disorder (BPD), obsessive compulsive disorder 
(OCD), major depressive disorder (MDD), or 
as a dissociative qualifi er of posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD+DS); however, it is only 
classifi ed as DPDR when these symptoms are 
not better explained by another mental illness. 
The distinction of DPDR, as outlined by the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), is assigned 
to individuals who “experience unreality or 
detachment” in respect to themselves (one’s 
thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or action) 
and/or their surroundings, yet the criteria for 
the disorder does not have a specifi c duration 
of symptoms, only that episodes must be 
“persistent or recurrent.”10 Typically, there is 
a chronic, unremitting progression lasting 
months to years, and the disorder is associated 
with signifi cant impairment in social and 
occupational functioning.

The prevalence of DPDR in the general 
population is estimated to be as high as 1 to 
2 percent worldwide.11 Studies of subjects 
with DPDR have revealed that the disorder has 
equal occurrence in both men and women, 
with a mean age of onset in adolescence; only 
fi ve percent of cases start in persons above 
the age of 25 years, and occurrence beyond 
the age of 40 years is rare.12 However, due 
to a lack of recognition among medical and 
mental health professionals, DPDR can linger 
untreated for a long time; a correct diagnosis 

of DPDR takes an average of 7 to 12 years to 
obtain.8,9 Once diagnosed, DPDR typically has a 
poor response to pharmacotherapy.2,7

The current review will revisit the works 
of literature available on the neurobiology 
involved in DPDR. Discerning the diverse 
neural processes that underlie this prevalent, 
yet often-neglected, psychiatric disorder could 
aid in better diagnosis and treatment moving 
forward. 

METHOD OF SEARCH

The methodology of this study is a scoping 

review. It diff ers from systematic reviews 
in both purpose and aim. This approach is 
useful when data on a topic of inquiry has 
yet to be comprehensively reviewed. The 
method is also appropriate when the subject 
of analysis is complex or heterogeneously 
diverse. The scoping review framework has 
several identifi able objectives, including 1) 
clarifying key concepts and defi nitions, 2) 
identifying and locating types of existing 
evidence, and 3) summarizing research results 
and identifying knowledge gaps, which was 
critical to the present study.13 This analysis was 
thus prepared based on existing or secondary 
data. Publications were chosen predominantly 
from 2014 to 2021, although some older 
articles were also included to establish the 
groundwork. PubMed, Google Scholar, Science 
Direct, and Web of Knowledge were used to 
search peer-reviewed articles to identify the 
neurobiological underpinnings of DPDR.

DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION 
AS A RESPONSE TO TRAUMA

Dissociative symptoms, including 

depersonalization/derealization, are thought 
to be the result of a vestigial reaction to events 
perceived as life-threatening.1 It has been 
shown that there exists an especially strong 
relationship between early interpersonal 
trauma and dissociative disorders.14 In one 
study, 198 psychiatric patients, ranging from 
11 to 19 years of age, were administered 
the Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale 
to determine if the degree of dissociative 
experience correlated with childhood trauma, 
which was measured through a checklist of 
various kinds of traumatic events. The study 
revealed that children who had experienced 
a history of neglect, abuse (physical and 
sexual), and stressful life events had a much 
higher degree of dissociative experiences 
than those who did not. Emotional neglect 
was determined to be the most substantial 
pathogenic risk factor.15 It has been suggested 
that these highly stressful encounters fail to fi t 
into the subject’s cognitive scheme regarding 
the self, others, and the world; therefore, they 
split off  from consciousness. When seen in this 
way, dissociation is part of the brain’s eff ort 
to eliminate the salience of painful memories, 
with the unintended consequence of causing 
intrusive thoughts and emotional blunting.16

Recent research exploring disorders 
with a traumatogenic etiology, such as 
PTSD+DS, has shed light on the neural 
processes involved in DPDR.17 When traumatic 
memories surface, nondissociative patients 
with PTSD demonstrate activity associated 
with emotional hyperarousal, such as an 
accelerated heart rate, reduced activation of 
prefrontal regions, and increased activation of 
the amygdala.17,18 In contrast, the dissociative 
subtype of PTSD shows the opposite 
pattern, with slowed heart rate, increased 
prefrontal activity, and decreased activity 
of the amygdala. As a result, it is thought 
that dissociation might be used to regulate 
elevated arousal in PTSD through limbic 
hyperinhibition (Figure 1).18 This strategy 
represents a hard-wired survival response 
meant to reduce anxiety, while inducing 
a state of heightened attention through 
executive brain areas.19 However, when this 
response continues past the threatening 
situation, depersonalization/derealization 

R E V I E W

may persist maladaptively, maintained by 
a negative feedback loop in response to the 
uncomfortable symptoms.20

Psychological trauma has also been 
correlated with psychosomatic dissociative 
or somatoform symptoms (e.g., seizures). 
In epilepsy (ES), repetitive focal excitement, 
or kindling, irreversibly disrupts the balance 
of neural excitation and inhibition, which 
leads to a permanent state of excitability 
and spontaneous convulsions. Likewise, 
it is hypothesized that ongoing traumatic 
stress might play a role in kindling inhibitory 
systems implicated in sustained dissociative 
states, which might therefore bring about 
the development of seizure-like symptoms 
via a lowered excitatory threshold.16
Depersonalization/derealization may be 
a symptom evident in both psychogenic 
nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and ES. A 
mixed-methods, content analysis study 
diff erentiating PNES from ES showed that, 
compared to ES, PNES reported longer 
seizures, more anxiety symptoms, dissociative 
phenomena, and alexithymia, the reduced 
ability to recognize and express emotions.21
Estimates suggest about 75 percent of adults 
with PNES report prior physical, sexual, or 
emotional trauma, with those reporting prior 
sexual abuse having earlier event onset and 
more severe convulsions.21

NEUROBIOLOGY OF DPDR

Early explanations of depersonalization/
derealization theorized that it was a vestigial 
brain response to life-threatening conditions. 
More recent discoveries suggest that it might 
be related to temporal lobe dysfunction. 
However, little is known about its biological 
underpinnings.1,7 Studies have opined that 
depersonalization and derealization might 
have distinct neuroanatomical correlates. 
For instance, one study investigated the 
relevance of the lesion technique in separating 
depersonalization and derealization. The 
study found that asomatognosia (the loss of 
conscious awareness of oneself and bodily 
processes) may serve as the biological 
model of depersonalization, as it can be 
attributed to lesions in several neurological 
conditions.22 Another study concluded that 
depersonalization is a distinct result of 
frontal lobe, as opposed to temporal lobe, 
misfi ring, when comparing depersonalization 

and derealization postictal sequalae in 
ES.23 However, other studies have yielded 
outcomes that postulate left-hemispheric 
frontotemporal activation may be involved in 
both depersonalization and derealization.24
Although the features of depersonalization 
and derealization are phenomenologically 
distinct, little scholarly evidence demonstrates 
that depersonalization can manifest 
independently of derealization.25 As a result, 
this review examines depersonalization/
derealization as an individual pathology. 

FRONTOLIMBIC INHIBITION AND 
EMOTIONAL NUMBING 

First posited by Geschwind,26 and later 

by Sierra and Berrios,1 the concept of 
corticolimbic disconnection is one model 
that explains the neurobiology of DPDR. This 
model presupposes that DPDR occurs because 
of excitatory amygdala circuits that modulate 
ascending arousal systems, leading to right 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) hyperactivation. A 
reciprocal inhibitory element mediated by 
PFC hyperactivation then impedes the limbic 
system, which is involved in experiencing 
emotions, and dampens sympathetic 
outputs.1,26 It is thought that activation of 
PFC functions inhibits the anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC), an area that plays a key role 
in coordinating bottom-up and top-down 
processing within fear regulation circuitry. The 
ACC has extensive connections with cognitive, 
emotional, and motor processing areas.27 The 
sum of these activities is a hyperattentive 
state and a subsequent overmodulation of 
emotions—fi ndings consistent with those 
in patients with PTSD+DS.17,18 Patients with 
PTSD+DS were also found to have enhanced 
top-down connectivity from the ventromedial 
PFC (vmPFC) to another key brain area, 
the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Consistent 
with other studies, patients with PTSD 
without predominant depersonalization and 
derealization showed the opposite pattern 
of connectivity.28 This dissonance between 
cortical and subcortical areas is corroborated 
by neuroimaging of patients with DPDR.

In a functional magnetic resonance imaging 

(fMRI) study, patients with DPDR who 
viewed images meant to elicit revulsion had 
less activation compared to controls in the 
occipitotemporal cortex, amygdala, and insula, 
all areas responsible for perceiving disgust. 

Instead, patients with DPDR showed activation 
of the right ventral PFC. The insula of patients 
with DPDR was shown to be active when 
viewing neutral images. This confi rms that 
in depersonalization/derealization, circuitry 
involved in processing emotionally salient 
imagery may be downregulated by the PFC.29
These results were validated in a similar study 
that showed that patients with DPDR exhibited 
decreased activation of limbic areas, including 
the right amygdala and right hypothalamus, 
with comparatively increased activation 
in various prefrontal regions, compared to 
controls.30,31

What accounts for the feelings of 
unfamiliarity or alienation from one’s 
environment and sense of self in DPDR 
may also be explained by the frontolimbic 
inhibition model. The amygdala is not 
only involved in emotional responses to 
external stimuli, but also stores implicit 
procedural memories. A hypoactive limbic 
system would therefore indicate diffi  culty 
recalling fi rmly etched past experiences. 
Whereas the hippocampus primarily stores 
verbal, declarative memories, the amygdala 
stores their personal salience, or aff ective 
quality.4 When a memory reaches a traumatic 
threshold, the hippocampus cannot store 
an explicit memory trace, as in dissociative 
amnesia, because it cannot contextualize the 
threat.32,33 Furthermore, it is acknowledged in 
the literature that hippocampal volume shrinks 
in PTSD and chronic stress.34

MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION AND 
THE BODY SCHEMA 

It has been established that the 
incorporation of bodily sensations into 
conscious awareness is critical to the 
experience of emotional states.35 This 
fi nding shed light on the relationship of 
aff erent somatosensory signals with the 
production of both subjective feelings and 
interoceptive awareness, or the perception 
of sensations from inside the body, related 
to internal organ functions (e.g., heartbeat, 
satiety, gastrointestinal motility, respiration, 
autonomic activity, etc.).36 Activation of the 
insula has been broadly implicated in a range 
of functional neuroimaging experiments 
involving emotional states and internal and 
external physical sensations. The insula is one 
of the most complex and least understood

brain areas, mainly due to its location 
deep within the lateral sulcus, which 
makes it difficult to assess, as well as a low 
prevalence of lesion studies.37 The structure 
is known to be responsible for a wide array 
of functions, including pain processing, 
salience detection, sensorimotor functioning, 
and the interoceptive inputs implicated in 
generating the body schema.37,38 Reviews 
that have directly queried interoception 
have found anterior insula activity to be 
positively correlated with such awareness, as 
well as self-reported emotional experience.39
The posterior insula has been shown to be 
involved in the initial recognition of internal 
body changes via input from limbic, thalamic, 
and brainstem networks, while the midinsula 
interacts with both the anterior and posterior 
insula to aid in translating visceral sensory 
input into emotions. The core phenomenon 
of DPDR—the overmodulation of the 
subjective experience of emotion—remains 
evident in these studies. According to an 
earlier fMRI study in 2001 examining the 
brain activity of patients with DPDR while 
viewing aversive imagery, the anterior 
insula appears to be underactive during 
emotional stimulation, whereas prefrontal 
activity increases.29 Notably, the insula is 
of particular relevance in understanding 
the universal neurobiological correlates of 
psychopathology. A study examined over 
15,000 MRI brain images with matched 
controls across six diagnostic groups (bipolar 
disorder, anxiety, depression, addiction, 
OCD, and schizophrenia) and found shared 
patterns of decreased gray matter in 
the anterior insula and dorsal anterior 
cingulate.40

Higher cortical areas involved in sensory 

and somatic integration are also likely to 
mediate depersonalization/derealization. 
Hypoemotionality may result from lesions in 
temporal-parietal regions.41 Using positron 
emission tomography (PET), one study 
compared patients with DPDR to healthy 
controls and found that activation in the 
temporal and parietal sensory association 
cortex differed significantly from that of 
the control group. These findings indicated 
abnormal communication between visual, 
auditory, and somatosensory cortices, as well 
as the inability to generate a fully integrated 
body schema.7

With the PTSD-dissociation relationship 

having been established, some studies 
sought to determine the degree to which 
patients with PTSD were vulnerable to 
altered perceptions of bodily ownership. 
For instance, one fMRI study focused on 
the link between PTSD and alterations 
in bodily self-consciousness using the 
Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI).42 RHI involves 
the manipulation of tactile, visual, and 
proprioceptive sensory inputs from a person’s 
hidden hand by brushing the hidden real 
hand and a believable, visible rubber hand 
simultaneously. The illusion is that the rubber 
hand seems to substitute for the hidden real 
hand. This experiment was administered to 
patients with PTSD, patients with PTSD+DS, 
and healthy controls. Patients with PTSD 
showed a lower illusion eff ect, depicting 
rigid body representation as a cognitive 
avoidance strategy that weakened the 
impact of body ownership manipulation, 
whereas the PTSD+DS group showed a state-
dependent body representation, indicating 
higher susceptibility to manipulation of 
embodiment.42

DEPERSONALIZATION/DEREALIZATION 
AND SEIZURES

The link between depersonalization/

derealization and seizures is well-established 
in the clinical literature.24 There are reports 
of depersonalization/derealization across 
other neurological conditions as well, 
such as postencephalitic stage, migraine, 
cerebrovascular disease, and head trauma. 
However, the correlations to neural 
mechanisms remain limited.1 A review of 
studies examining the co-occurrence of 
neuropsychiatric disorders with organic 
disorders found dissociative symptoms, such 
as fugue and trance-like states, delusions of 
possession, delusions of self-misidentification, 
and out-of-body experiences, were dominant 
in migraine and ES, especially of the 
temporal lobe.43 An examination of aura in 
the pathology of temporal lobe ES found 
derealization, dreamy states, altered time, 
and dysmnesic symptoms (déjà vu and jamais 
vu).1,44

The Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II) 
has been a popular tool in uncovering the link 
between depersonalization/derealization, ES, 
and other types of seizures. In patients with 

ES, dissociative symptoms show a positive 
correlation with shorter duration and higher 
frequency of seizures.45 As aforementioned, 
patients with PNES have a longer duration of 
seizures than those with ES; these patients are 
more likely to report a history of interpersonal 
trauma, with earlier life abuse correlated with 
the severity of convulsions.21 In one study, 
the DES-II was administered to patients with 
concurrent ES and PNES. The results showed 
significantly higher DES-II scores in patients 
with both ES and PNES than the other two 
groups (epilepsy-only and healthy controls).46

Factors of the DES-II used in these 
studies comparing ES and PNES include 
depersonalization-derealization (e.g., other 
people and objects do not seem real, feeling 
as though one’s body is not one’s own, not 
recognizing oneself in the mirror, being in 
a familiar place but feeling it is strange and 
unfamiliar), inattentiveness, absorption-
imaginative factors, amnesia, and reality 
distortion.47 In some survey studies, the 
amnesia factor showed evidence of memory 
loss being attributable to solely neurological 
or medical causes, as the ES group had 
higher scores in this domain. An important 
stipulation to point out is that this result is 
noted to have several flaws.48 Two of the seven 
amnesia elements (“approached by people 
who one doesn’t know or who call one by 
a different name” and “feeling of watching 
oneself as if looking at another person”) 
might not solely constitute a lapse of memory, 
but could instead be a profound disturbance 
of self-identity. Furthermore, as mentioned in 
the previous section on frontolimbic inhibition 
in DPDR, the item, “told of one not recognizing 
friends and family people,” might also be 
related to amygdaloid disconnections of the 
dissociative process. Notably, if the survey 
results looking at the DES-II amnesia factor 
indicated memory loss related to ES alone, 
the studies would have revealed a significant 
difference between the PNES and ES groups 
independent of child abuse histories, which 
they did not. 

In summary, the DES-II has separate 

domains that relate distinctively to 
depersonalization/derealization, neurological 
impairment, and childhood and/or 
interpersonal trauma.49 The heterogeneous 
item content of the DES-II is a potential 
confound that should be appreciated when

studying dissociation within neuropsychiatric 
populations. Though dissociative symptoms 
have related processes, depersonalization/
derealization should still be viewed as distinct 
when the scale is used. Overall, there are 
positive correlations between DPDR and 
neurological impairment, which are likely 
mediated by trauma.48

STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND LARGE-
SCALE ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS

Neuroimaging studies on DPDR have also 

revealed variations in cortical thickness. 
Symptom severity was positively correlated 
with gray matter structural alterations.46
Certain structural MRI studies showed 
decreased cortical thickening in the right 
middle temporal region and increased size 
of the gyrus rectus, left dorsomedial PFC, 
and right somatosensory region in these 
patients.46 Further supporting evidence 
showed that severe depersonalization was 
especially correlated with greater precuneus 
volume.50,51 The precuneus is a higher level 
cortical area dedicated to a wide variety of 
integrative complex tasks. It is considered 
a hub for multimodal sensory processing, 
playing a major role in generating visuospatial 
imagery and coordinating goal-directed motor 
movement.52 The structure is thus known to be 
highly implicated in self-referential processing 
operations, such as generating body image 
representation.52,25 In corroboration, another 
study also analyzing cortical/subcortical 
thickness and volume within dissociative and 
functional neurologic disorders showed a 
positive correlation between DPDR severity 
and cortical thickness in visual association 
areas.53

Several studies have demonstrated the 
role of specific DPDR-associated alterations 
in several brain structures and their 
functions.1,23,28,33,54 The first known study 
on aberrations of structural white matter 
connections in patients with DPDR showed 
that, compared to controls, patients with 
DPDR had disrupted connections between 
the left superior temporal gyrus and left 
temporal poles, as well as between the 
right middle temporal gyrus and right 
supramarginal gyrus.55 The degree of 
disconnection correlated with dissociative 
symptom severity in the DPDR group. This 
research strongly points to the role of local 

neuronal changes that may be arbitrated by 
altered interregional connections of white 
matter. These irregularities of communication 
between fiber tracts may not solely be a 
consequence of volume loss concerning 
the gray matter, but rather primary 
pathophysiology. Therefore, the heterogenic 
symptomology of DPDR may be linked to 
network-level dysfunctions representing 
abnormal connectivity of the fiber tracts, 
thereby informing a transdiagnostic 
perspective.55

Studies on the role of the orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC) provide further insight into 
the absence of self-concept in DPDR. This 
region has nerve fibers descending to the 
amygdala and is generally implicated in 
social and emotional reasoning.56,57 In an 
analysis examining functional connectivity 
of the precuneus in 282 patients with MDD 
and 254 controls, 125 patients receiving 
medication for depression demonstrated 
lessening activity between the lateral OFC 
and precuneus to levels similar to those of 
controls.56 Other studies showed evidence that 
connections between the OFC and precuneus 
provide emotional information involved in 
recalling autobiographical memory.52,58 In 
healthy subjects, the OFC responds to many 
punishing stimuli that are typically meant to 
elicit visceral responses of disgust or revulsion 
via the anterior insula. It is important to note 
that, regarding the connections involved in 
autonomic responses, the anterior insula is 
overactive in depression and underactive 
in DPDR. These findings corroborate the 
notion that the lateral OFC’s nonreward 
or penal system has enhanced effects on 
self-representational regions, including the 
precuneus, which might help explain poor 
self-esteem in patients with depression.57
Interestingly, these regions have been shown 
to be underactive in DPDR, which might 
represent an overmodulation effect to these 
same self-representational areas.29

Distorted self-image has been investigated 

within many different regions, including 
the right frontal, orbitofrontal, and medial-
frontal regions, along with the limbic system, 
corpus callosum, and subcortical-cortical 
midline structures, including hypothalamus/
hypophysis, temporoparietal junction, 
bilateral temporal poles, insular cortex, 
frontal region, ventro- and dorsolateral and 

medial PFC, parietal cortex, and frontolimbic 
networks. Other regions evident in self-image 
include the brain stem; PAG; colliculi; sub-, 
pre-, and supragenual anterior cingulate 
cortex; retrosplenial cortex; and posterior 
cingulate cortex.54 This provides evidence for 
the role of large-scale brain networks, most 
notably the default mode network (DMN), for 
the mental expression of one’s sense of self, 
given the multiple processes involved.

One study compared brain activity during 
externalized cognition involving visuospatial 
planning (attention to the environment) to 
brain activity during internalized cognition 
involving autobiographical planning 
(attention to personal information).59 The 
study showed that autobiographical planning 
activated the DMN, whereas visuospatial 
planning engaged another large-scale 
circuit, the dorsal attentional network (DAN). 
The critical finding, however, was that a 
third network, the frontoparietal network 
(FPN), was highly active during both forms 
of planning. It was previously thought 
that the activity of the DMN and DAN had 
an intrinsically competitive relationship. 
However, the FPN is now believed to be 
involved in the mediation of planning across 
different attentional domains.60

Largely found in the posterior parietal 
cortex and dorsolateral PFC, the FPN serves 
as a cortical mediator, guiding goal-directed 
cognition across major neurocircuits.59
Because it interacts with both the DAN 
and DMN, it is responsible for the active 
manipulation and maintenance of working 
memory, utilizing both environmental and 
autobiographical information.60 The DMN 
is located throughout the medial posterior 
cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, medial 
temporal lobe, and vmPFC. It is most active 
during internal mental-state tasks, such as 
interoception and episodic memory retrieval, 
and is suppressed during focused attention 
to external stimuli. Notably, the precuneus is 
a functional core of the DMN.61,62 Though the 
interaction of the DMN and FPN is necessary to 
regulate goal-directed behavior, the literature 
now demonstrates that hyperconnectivity 
between these networks is correlated with 
high degrees of dissociation.59,63–65 This 
represents the maladaptive integration of 
internal mental processes involved in DPDR 
within higher level neurocircuitry.

CONCLUSION

DPDR is thought to be a complex behavioral 

response to psychological trauma. Though 
the underlying mechanisms are not entirely 
understood, several theories using existing 
models of neural circuitry have identifi ed 
mechanisms that are thought to contribute 
to the symptomatic profi le observed in 
those who experience chronic and persistent 
dissociation. It is unlikely that any one of 
these mechanisms alone can fully explain 
DPDR; instead, it is likely that many of these 
neural pathways together contribute to 
its pathogenesis. Currently, no defi nitive 
treatment exists to alleviate symptoms of 
dissociation. Pharmacologic interventions 
should be part of a comprehensive formulation 
of a treatment plan addressing the 
biopsychosocial elements at play. Diff erent 
psychotherapies may endeavor to strengthen 
the relationship between the cerebral cortex 
and subcortical regions by integrating the 
various aspects of the self, bodily, emotionally, 
and representationally. Further research is 
needed on the relevant neural networks 
and neurotransmitters to better understand 
the mechanism behind depersonalization/
derealization.
