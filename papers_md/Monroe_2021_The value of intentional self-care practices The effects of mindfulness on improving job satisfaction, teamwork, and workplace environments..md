Project7, teamwork, job satisfaction 

Background:  Burnout  rates  among  nurses  have  detrimental  impact  on  job  satisfaction,  teamwork,  and  patient 
care. This costs millions of dollars in the healthcare system and challenges nurse leaders to address in order to 
keep  up  with  the  healthcare  demands.  Furthermore,  burnout  is  especially  relevant  in  our  current  healthcare 
climate, as frontline nurses have increased workload and multiple psychosocial stressors during the coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) pandemic (Sultana, Sharma, Hossain, Bhattacharya, &  Purohit, 2019). Literature also sug-
gests that mindful self-care practices  need to be reinforced in order to impact burnout  long term (Chamorro- 
Premuzic  &  Lusk,  2017).  Project7  Mindfulness  Pledge©  is  an  accessible  and  voluntary  mindfulness  tool  that 
nurses  can  utilize  in  their  individual  practice  to  reduce  burnout  and  does  not  require  significant  time 
commitment. 
Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of intentional self-care practices on nurse burnout and workplace envi-
ronment by measuring job satisfaction and teamwork among nurses. 
Methods: Comparisons between inpatient units on data from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators 
(NDNQI) with the Practice Environment Scale (PES), specifically on job enjoyment and teamwork, were done 
utilizing ANOVA. 
Results:  Results  show  that  nurses  in  an  inpatient  unit  that  implemented  Project7  has  significantly  higher  job 
satisfaction as compared to units that did not implement Project7. 
Conclusions: This suggests that this tool provides an effective and accessible mindfulness framework managers 
and directors can utilize to improve job satisfaction, teamwork, and thereby reduce burnout to create healthier 
work environments.   

Background 

Burnout and mindfulness 

The  current  healthcare  environment  is  rapidly  changing  with 
increased demands and fewer resources, leading to chronic stress and 
burnout in the nursing workforce (Cohen-Katz, Wiley, Capuano, Baker, 
& Shapiro, 2005; Lee et al., 2013; Richards, 2016). Burnout, a state of 
physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by a depletion of a 

person’s  ability  to  cope  with  one’s  environment,  is  associated  with 
increased  turnover,  employee  absenteeism,  poor  coworker  support, 
depersonalization,  decreased  performance,  decreased  patient  satisfac-
tion, and difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff (Garman, Corrigan, 
& Morris, 2002; Maslach, 1982; Sundin, Hochw¨alder, & Lisspers, 2011; 
Vahey,  Aiken,  Sloane,  et  al.,  2004).  Burnout  rates  are  significantly 
higher  for  hospital  nurses  than  for  other  professionals,  and  a  recent 
study determined that every fifth nurse reported plans to leave the job 
within  a  year  (Hylton  Rushton,  Batcheller,  Schroeder,  &  Donohue,

Monroe et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

2015). These findings are alarming and have long-term implications for 
the  nursing  workforce  and  health  care  outcomes.  Furthermore,  these 
issues have been compounded with increased demands from COVID-19 
(Sultana, Sharma, Hossain, Bhattacharya, & Purohit, 2019). 

Literature  suggests  that  nurse  burnout  has  significant  impact  on 
employee  engagement  and  retention  of  competent  staff  (Steinberg, 
2017;  Vahey,  Aiken,  Sloane,  et  al.,  2004;  Wolf  et  al.,  1998;  Wright, 
Zakarian, & Blake, 2016). Burnout in the workplace results in increased 
financial  costs  due  to  sickness  and  turnover  rates,  with  replacement 
costs for a nurse being twice the cost of a regular salary (Wright et al., 
2016).  Further,  burnout  can  reduce  morale  and  overall  impact  team-
work within units (Hülsheger et al., 2013). Job satisfaction is critically 
important  to  maintaining  a  sufficient  supply  of  nurses  in  the  United 
States and has a direct impact on the quality care given at the bedside 
(Ritter, 2011). Solutions to reduce burnout among nurses have histori-
cally  been  under-recognized  and  lack  focus  in  translating  research 
findings to practice (Letvak, 2013; Vahey, Aiken, Sloane, et al., 2004; 
Wolf  et  al.,  1998).  Healthcare  environments  are  now  focusing  on  in-
terventions to improve burnout through mindfulness-based strategies. 
Mindfulness is defined as “moment to moment awareness of one’s own 
experience  without judgment”  (Davis &  Hayes,  2011). It is proven to 
reduce levels of stress, enhance coping ability, and promote well-being 
among  healthcare  staff  (Hee  Kim,  Subramanian,  Rahmat,  &  Phang, 
2014). 

Furthermore,  burnout  has  been  correlated  with  poor  patient  out-
comes  and  decreased  satisfaction  scores  (Wright  et  al.,  2016).  Some 
studies  suggest  that  burnout  has  been  linked  to  increased  healthcare 
associated infection rates such as catheter associated urinary tract in-
fections  (CAUTI),  increased  patient falls, as  well  as  decreased  patient 
satisfaction rates (Geiger-Brown & Lipscomb, 2010; Wright et al., 2016). 
Hospitals  in which  burnout was reduced by  30% had  a total  of 6239 
fewer infections, resulting in a $68 million annual cost savings (Cimiotti, 
Aiken, Sloans, &  Wu, 2012). And in one study, researchers found pa-
tients were twice as likely to report higher satisfaction scores in units 
that did not experience nurse burnout compare with units who experi-
ence nursing burnout (Vahey, Aiken, Sloane, Clarke, & Vargas, 2004). 
Mindfulness interventions have been widely studied in patient pop-
ulations as well as other workplace environments but have only recently 
been given attention to healthcare employees. Furthermore, empirical 
research  is  lacking  and  fails  to  demonstrate  the  “why”  and  “how” 
mindfulness relates to nurse well-being and how that affects healthcare 
outcomes.  Those  studies  primarily  used  the  well-validated  model  of 
Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  that  equates  to  eight  sessions  of 
mindfulness-based  training  and  supervision  (Frisvold,  Lindquist,  & 
McAlpine,  2012;  Matthew  &  John,  2012).  Although  effective  in  the 
literature, the cost in training and accessibility may be barriers to its use. 
In  fact,  workplace  wellbeing  initiatives  are  not  always  available  to 
frontline  nursing  staff  and  are  often  utilized  by  employees  in  office- 
based roles (Wright et al., 2016). 

In more recent years, Organizational Psychology literature focuses 
on  how  mindfulness  affects  job  satisfaction  and  teamwork  (Benzo, 
Kirsch, & Nelson, 2017; Botha, Gwin, & Pupora, 2015; Chamorro-Pre-
muzic & Lusk, 2017; Hülsheger et al., 2013). When mindful individuals 
attend to the present moment in a receptive, non-judgmental way, they 
observe stressful events more objectively and refrain from attaching a 
meaning or evaluation to it. This helps individuals not to be influenced 
by biased, negative thought patterns which may lead to an overly dra-
matic  appraisal  of  the  situation.  At  work,  where  individuals  are  con-
fronted  with  challenging  situations  every  day,  mindfulness  may  thus 
facilitate  adaptive  appraisal  of  stressful  events.  To  the  extent  that 
mindfulness affects employees’ appraisal of challenging work events as 
less stressful, these elicit more positive and less negative affective re-
actions, which, in turn, lead to a more positive evaluative judgment of 
one’s work situation (Hülsheger et al., 2013). 

strategies  to  make  mindfulness  interventions  easily  accessible  by  uti-
lizing  a  mindfulness-based  conceptual  framework  named  Project7 
Mindfulness Pledge©  (Project7). Like Jean Watson’s Theory of Caring 
Science, Project7 provides a path for nurses and other health care pro-
fessions to expand their caring literacy by improving connections with 
self  and  others,  building  resiliency,  and  contributing  to  creating  a 
healthy, satisfying work environment. It provides a framework on how 
nurses and other healthcare professionals can more deeply reflect, listen, 
and connect with self and others. Through presence, authenticity, and 
intentionality, nurses are poised to provide the highest form of care for 
themselves and others. 

Project7 Mindfulness Pledge© 

Project7  is  a  mindfulness  intervention  that  includes  a  voluntary 
mindfulness pledge aimed at improving job satisfaction and teamwork. 
Created  by  a  Registered  Nurse,  Robert  Varney,  this  mindfulness  tool 
seeks  to  develop  internal  self-awareness,  emotional  intelligence,  and 
strives to maintain connection and appreciation of others by enhancing 
relationships within the team. 

Project7  contains  seven  agreements  (see  below).  Rather  than 
mandating  participation,  individuals  are  invited  to  commit  to  the 
pledge, staying true to the theoretical propositions of mindfulness.  

1.  I pledge to be here  
2.  I pledge to be prepared  
3.  I pledge to be humble  
4.  I pledge to look at what I have  
5.  I pledge to look at how I can help  
6.  I pledge to aim for excellence  
7.  I pledge to have strength and courage 

Each month an agreement is selected and becomes the lens to foster 
self-awareness and appreciation throughout that month with the team. 
Inspirational  quotes  related  to  the  pledge,  a  sign  in  sheet,  and  visual 
board to celebrate accomplishments encourages participation and foster 
self-awareness on the unit. The structure of the pledges and visuals on 
the unit serve as reminders to carry out the internal mindfulness and 
self-awareness in each of its participants. No formal training is required, 
and the intervention is meant to cultivate an internal mindfulness and 
resilience, which can then inspire others to have a ripple effect within 
the team. 

Research questions 

This  retrospective  study  evaluated  the  effect  of  Project7  on  job 
enjoyment, teamwork, and fall rates (total and injury). Job enjoyment 
and  teamwork  were  evaluated  using  the  relevant  unit-level  results 
extrapolated from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators 
(NDNQI)  2017  Nurse  (RN)  Survey  with  Practice  Environment  Scale 
(PES). Falls were defined per NDNQI definition and calculated as total 
number of falls per 1000 patient days and as total injury falls per 1000 
patient  days.  Our  research  question  was:  Did  the  implementation  of 
Project7 in an inpatient acute care unit affect job enjoyment, teamwork, 
and fall rates? We hypothesized that staff RNs on the inpatient acute care 
unit that implemented Project7 had better job enjoyment and teamwork 
compared  to  other  inpatient  acute  care  units  that  did  not  implement 
Project7 within the same hospital. We further hypothesize that fall rates 
would decrease over time within this unit.

The Project7 Unit is a 25-bed observation acute care unit. Typical for 
observation, this unit sees a wide variety of medical, cardiac, trauma,

and minor surgical patients. Implementation of the Project7 on this unit 
initially began with staff engagement and team building exercises. Ed-
ucation  occurred  through  informal  conversations,  staff  meetings,  and 
huddles. 

The process of developing and implementing Project7 Mindfulness 
pledge began on March 2012. The author of the pledge initially met with 
high-performing  staff  to  request  support  and  to  assist  in  promoting 
mindfulness  ideas  such  as  team  building,  safety,  excellence  and 
compassion. These were informal meetings during regular work shifts in 
between patient care activities. Next, there was a focus on team building 
activities. One such activity entailed a three-month baby board where 
staff posted baby pictures of themselves and other staff were invited to 
guess which picture belong to which staff member. Further, the board 
for compliments and ‘kudos’ was redesigned to make these statements of 
affirmation more public. A mindfulness bulletin board was developed 
and displayed in a highly-trafficked corridor on the unit. The compo-
nents  of  the  bulletin  board  included  a  laminated  copy  of  the  7-point 
pledge, a one-page letter highlighting a single pledge for the month, a 
sheet for staff to sign, and inspirational quotes. The letter describes the 
meaning behind practicing the pledge. The seven agreements are cycled 
month-after-month, enabling the pledge to remain alive and active. The 
agreements  remain  the  same,  but  the  descriptive  content  is  updated 
monthly. Charge nurses utilize huddles and staff meetings to align the 
mindfulness  pledge  to  patient  care  and  priorities  on  the  unit.  During 
2012  and  2013,  the  author  presented  Project7  in  staff  huddles  and 
meetings emphasizing intent of the project. Lastly, continual teaching 
and coaching by the author are conducted on the unit enabling educa-
tion for new staff and reinforcement for current staff. We identified the 
following  periods:  pre-intervention  was  between  January  2009  to 
February 2012; development period March 2012 to August 2013; and 
post-intervention period as September 2013 to December 2016. 

IRB approval 

For this retrospective evaluation of Project7, all necessary permis-
sions and approvals to conduct research activities were obtained from 
the  hospital’s  internal  office  of  research  and  the  Colorado  Multiple 
Institutional Review Board. 

Study outcomes 

This study utilized outcomes obtained from the NDNQI RN Survey 
with PES. This survey is designed to capture RN attitudes toward their 
work  environment.  The  RN  Survey  with  PES  collects  data  biennially 
from direct care nurses and organized by units (NDNQI, 2016). These 
units are compared to and benchmarked against like-units within the 
participating national membership of NDNQI hospitals (NDNQI, 2016). 
Applicable  to  this  research  question  are  the  following:  nursing  work 
index, nurse-nurse interaction, job-enjoyment, work context items, and 
nurse  characteristic  items  (NDNQI,  2016).  Our  study  focuses  on  the 
following:  job  enjoyment  subscale  and  teamwork  question  from  the 
nurse-nurse interaction subscale. 

The Job Enjoyment subscale includes the following questions: 1) As 
RNs, we were fairly well satisfied with our jobs on our unit; 2) RNs on 
our unit would not consider taking another job; 3) I have to force myself 
to come to work much of the time; 4) RNs on our unit are enthusiastic 
about our work almost every day; 5) RNs on our unit like our jobs better 
than the average RN does; 6) I feel that each day on my job will never 
end; 7) We find that real enjoyment in our work on our unit. 

For each of these items, a six-point Likert scale was used for assess-
ment with response options ranging from strongly disagree to strongly 
agree. Raw response values from all participating nurses were used to 
calculate a mean score for each individual item. Individual item scores 
were then averaged to obtain a subscale score that reflects the average 
unit attitude toward the construct being measured. Higher values reflect 
more  favorable  ratings.  Teamwork  was  assessed  using  the  individual 

question  as  part  of  the  Nurse-Nurse  Interaction  subscale:  “There  is  a 
good deal of teamwork among RNs I work with.”  Similar to the items 
within the Job Enjoyment subscale, this item utilizes the six-point Likert 
scale wherein higher values indicate more positive ratings on teamwork. 
Data was collected on the Project7 unit and six other acute care units 
(Units A-Units F). 23 responses (85% of the unit) were collected. Units A- 
Units F and Project7 unit all belong to the same division with the same 
leadership team though they see different types of patients. Often pa-
tients from Project7 units may be admitted to the other acute care units. 
Total  and  injury  fall  rates  for  the  Project7  unit  were  collected  from 
January 2009 to December 2016. Falls were defined per NDNQI defi-
nition with injury falls defined as any minor injury and above. Fall rates 
were calculated as follows: total number of falls per 1000 patient days 
and total number of injury falls per 1000 patient days. We focused on 
falls  as  a  metric  for  quality  of  care  as  this  was  a  consistent  quality 
measurement  followed  by  this  unit.  Furthermore,  we  included  this 
metric to explore the impact of Project7 on falls and its relationship to 
teamwork and engagement. 

Statistical analysis plan 

Mean scores and standard deviations for job satisfaction and team-
work are described for each unit. We utilized an Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) to statistically test the difference in mean scores on the job 
enjoyment and teamwork between Project7 unit and six other acute care 
units.  Post-hoc  testing  using  Tukey’s-Kramer  Honest  Significance  Dif-
ference (HSD) was utilized to detect differences between specific group 
means. For fall rates, medians with interquartile range were calculated 
for  each  time  period:  pre-intervention,  development,  and  post- 
intervention.  Kruskal-Walls  was  conducted  to  compare  fall  rates  be-
tween the three time periods. 

Further, we implemented an interrupted time series (ITS) design to 
further study the impact of the Project7 development period and post- 
intervention  period  on  fall  rates.  ITS  is  a  quasi-experimental  design 
that incorporates real-world contexts into assessing the effectiveness of 
an intervention (Cruz, Bender, & Ombao, 2017; Ewusie, Blondal, Soo-
bia,  et  al.,  2017;  Loresto,  Grant,  Solberg,  &  Eron,  2019).  We  utilized 
segmented regression analysis to incorporate levels and trends into the 
assessment of  impact  (Ewusie et  al., 2017;  Loresto et  al., 2019). This 
incorporation of levels and trends gives an estimate of the effect of the 
development periods and post-intervention on fall rate levels (average 
fall rate for a given time period) and fall rate trends (rate of change of 
falls rates for a given time period). As fall rates (total and injury) were 
not normally distributed, we implemented a negative binomial regres-
sion model. Analysis was conducted using the R software (R Core Team, 
2017). 

Results 

Job satisfaction and teamwork 

Results  demonstrate  a  significantly  higher  mean  score  on  the  PES 
Survey Job Enjoyment subscale for the Project7 unit compared to other 
acute care inpatient units included in this study (mean = 5.37, p-value 
<0.0001). Post-hoc testing using Tukey-Kramer-HSD for multiple com-
parisons  revealed  a  significant  difference  between  Project7  unit  and 
every other unit individually. Results from the RN Teamwork question 
reveal that unit E had the highest score (5.78) and unit D had the lowest 
score  (4.00).  Overall  significance  was  demonstrated  in  the  omnibus 
(F = 73.26, p < 0.0001), therefore post-hoc testing was conducted. Post- 
hoc results indicate that the unit D score was significantly lower than 
every other unit when individually compared. Post-hoc testing did not 
reveal  any  significant  differences  between  the  score  for  unit  Project7 
unit  when  compared  individually  to  other  units.  Table  1  summarizes 
these results.

Total and injury fall rates 

Fig. 1 displays the total and injury fall rates over time. During the 
pre-intervention period, total fall rates had a median of 4.79 (IQR: 5.62) 
and injury fall rates had a median of 1.37 (2.11). Total fall rates were at 
4.83 (2.88) and 2.63 (2.29) during the development period and post- 
intervention  period  respectively.  Injury  falls  were  at  0.0  (1.42)  and 
0.0  (0.40)  during  the  development  and  post-intervention  period 
respectively. These were statistically significant findings. Table 2 sum-
marizes these results. 

Table 3 summarizes the segmented regression results. Total fall rate 
level  had  a  19%  decrease  during  the  development  period  and  a  13% 
decrease during the post-intervention period totaling for an estimated 
32% decrease in fall rate from the pre-intervention period. Total fall rate 
level  decreased  by  2%  overall  from  the  pre-intervention  period.  For 
injury  fall  rate,  there  was  an  increase  in  fall  rate  by  13%  during  the 
development period and 57% during the post-intervention period with 
an overall increase of 70% from pre-intervention period. There was an 
overall decrease of 1% for fall rate trend from pre-intervention. All re-
sults were statistically non-significant.

Discussion 

This work sought to evaluate Project7 effectiveness in job enjoyment, 
teamwork,  and  fall  rates  as  a  means  to  further  describe  mindfulness 
effectiveness  in  reducing  burnout  among  nurses.  It  was  hypothesized 
that  Project7  Unit  would  have  higher  job  enjoyment  and  teamwork 
compared to all other acute care units that did not implement Project7. 
Further it was hypothesized that the Project7 unit would have decreased 
falls over time. Our results suggest that Project7 unit had significantly 
higher scores in job enjoyment compared to all other acute care units 
and  among  the  higher  scores,  though  not  significant,  in  teamwork 
compared to some of the acute care units. These results met one of the 
hypotheses. In terms of teamwork, Project7 unit did not have the highest 
score as compared to the other units. It is noted that scores across all 
other units were particularly high with the exception of unit D, implying 
that Project7 effects may have been masked by the circumstances of the 
hospital.  In  terms  of  fall  rates,  median  fall  rates  (total  and  injury) 
decrease from the pre-intervention period to the post-intervention. Re-
sults from the regression analysis further support total fall decreases.

Nurse  burnout  is  associated  with  higher  turnover  and  lower 
perceived  job  enjoyment  (Guillaumie,  Boiral,  &  Champagne,  2017; 
Labrague et al., 2017; Pang & Ruch, 2019; Vahey, Aiken, Sloane, et al., 
2004;  Wright  et  al.,  2016).  Job  satisfaction  is  a  key  indicator  of 
recruitment  and  retention  in  the  nursing  workforce  (Vahey,  Aiken, 
Sloane, et al., 2004). Although sources of job satisfaction vary within 
nursing, they are broadly defined within domains of working conditions, 
interpersonal  interactions,  and  psychological  factors  (Lu,  Barriball, 
Zhang, &  While, 2012). A healthy working environment is defined as 
including:  collaborative  practice  culture,  communication-rich  culture, 
culture  of  accountability,  expert  team  members,  shared  decision- 
making,  and  recognition  of  contributions  of  others  (Ritter,  2011). 
Organizational development research also provides a strong correlation 
between  organizational  subculture  and  job  satisfaction  (Lok  &  Craw-
ford, 1999). Project7 fosters a culture of ownership over job satisfaction, 
assisting  in  creating  a  healthy  working  environment  and  reducing 
burnout (Horton-Deutsch et al., 2020). 

Developing  self-awareness  and  mindful  practice  reflection  helps 
develop  the  essential  aspects  of  emotional  intelligence  (Freshwater, 
2002; Horton-Deutsch &  Sherwood, 2008; Moran &  Sherwood, 2017; 
Sherwood & Horton-Deutsch, 2008). Through a sense of openness and 
curiosity about our experience, mindfulness leads to greater awareness 
and insight. Similarly, reflection-in-action involves paying attention to 
our moment-to-moment experience, including thoughts, feelings, bodily 
sensations,  and  judgments.  Reflection-in-action  and  mindfulness  help 
nurses develop insight into how perceptions shape actions, identify and 
understand other people’s standpoints, and incorporate this knowledge 
into more deliberate and effective responses. 

Project7 supports transforming behaviors and actions through caring 
literacy and shifts a culture from focusing on accountability to owner-
ship  where  team  members  embrace  shared  values,  mutually  support 
freedom and responsibility, positively and consciously engage with one 
another, and encourage innovative thinking. Self-development to stay 
true to our internal compass helps manage the emotional work inherent 
in  nursing.  Reflective  practice  is  a  key  to  manage  self-care,  develop 
leadership capacity, improve responses through emotional intelligence, 
develop  mindfulness  to  engage  in  work  activities,  and  thus  improve 
safety outcomes (Horton-Deutsch & Sherwood, 2017). 

Segmented regression results showed that injury fall rates increased 
from the pre-intervention period. We note that this is simply the case a 
few  high  injury  fall  months  during  the  development  and  post- 
intervention  period  and  not  a  full  indication  of  the  effect  of  Project7 
on the acute care unit. The rate zero injury falls months were higher 
post-intervention  compared  to  the  pre-intervention  (42%  vs.  75%) 
indicating an improvement in the management of injury falls. Fall rates 

were a consistent metric followed in the acute care division as a whole 
and compared across units. Given that nurse teamwork and environment 
impact quality of care such as falls (Geiger-Brown & Lipscomb, 2010), 
this  data  demonstrates  possible  correlation  with  higher  engagement 
scores on 7A. 

This study did a cross-sectional comparison of units in terms of job 
satisfaction and teamwork, which is a limitation. A better design would 
have  been  to follow 7A  over time and  estimate the  effect  of Project7 
through the utilization of more sophisticated statistical models, such as 
segmented  regression  analysis.  Unfortunately,  not  enough  data  were 
available  for  this  analysis  and  there’s  a  potential  that  Project7  was 
wasn’t  a  robust  enough  intervention  to  affect  change.  However,  this 
study provided some evidence of the positive impact of Project7 on falls. 
Using  ITS  provides  a  more  robust  form  of  evidence  as  it  has  been 
documented  that  ITS  is  a  strong  quasi-experimental  design  (Wagner, 
Somerai, Zhang, et al., 2002). However, we only implemented this on 
one unit. A stronger design would be to compare this with a control unit 
or  perform  a  controlled  trial  with  interrupted  time  series  that  could 
make this discussion more robust. Further work is recommended. Future 
work could include secondary data analysis incorporating more data and 
more sophisticated models, or a prospective randomized control trial to 
fully determine the causal effect of Project7 in terms of job enjoyment, 
teamwork, and other quality metrics such as catheter associated urinary 
tract infections. Additionally, implementing Project7 on other units and 
having a standard rollout procedure with pre and post measurements 
would lend to greater data collection. 

Conclusion 

Project7  is  a  feasible  and  sustainable  mindfulness  program  that 
nursing  leaders  can  reasonably  implement  in  their  units  without  sig-
nificant costs. This work suggests that this program improves job satis-
faction and can reduce burnout leading to improved environment and 
safety  measures.  Project7  creates  a  culture  that  encourages  patient 
safety and ownership promoting these improvements. With increasing 
demands for our healthcare workforce, Project7 may enhance resiliency 
when the culture needs it the most.
