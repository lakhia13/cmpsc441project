Background: This study aimed to examine the effects of a 12-week multicomponent
mobile app-delivered intervention, the Meru Health Program (MHP), on mental health
quality of
life (QoL) and loneliness among the middle-aged and older adults with
depression symptoms.

Methods: The eligible participants (M age = 57.06, SD = 11.26 years) were enrolled in
the MHP, a therapist-supported mobile intervention. Using a non-randomized pre-post
design, change in mental health QoL [WHO QoL Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) psychological
health] and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) from baseline to post-treatment were
examined. Time of enrollment [pre- vs. post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was
included as a between-subjects factor in the repeated measures analyses.

Results: Forty-two participants enrolled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; eight enrolled
after the pandemic began. Among the pre-COVID-19 enrollees, increase in mental health
QoL, F (1,38) = 12.61, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.25 and decreases in loneliness emerged, F (1,38)
= 5.42, p = 0.025, η2 = 0.13. The changes in mental health QoL, but not loneliness,
held for the combined sample, such as post-COVID-19 enrollees, F (1,44) = 6.02, p =
0.018, η2 = 0.12. The regression analyses showed that increases in mindfulness were
associated with the increased mental health QoL and decreased loneliness.

Conclusion: Therapist-supported digital mental health interventions, such as the MHP,
have the potential to improve mental health QoL and decrease loneliness among the
middle-aged and older adults. The ﬁndings for loneliness may not hold during the periods
of mandated isolation. Instead, therapists supporting digital interventions may need to
tailor their approach to target loneliness.

mHealth Intervention Older Adults

INTRODUCTION

Loneliness, a subjective feeling of social isolation, aﬄicts more
than a third (35%) of adults aged 45 and older (1). Furthermore,
loneliness co-occurs with numerous chronic health conditions
(2, 3), increases risk of dementia (4), and leads to increased
morbidity and mortality (5, 6). The health epidemic of loneliness
continues to worsen, most recently due to acute factors, such as
the [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] pandemic that led to
or exacerbated social isolation (7).

The interventions targeting loneliness primarily focus on the
enhancing social skills, providing social support, increasing social
access, and/or targeting maladaptive thoughts (8). The meta-
analytic ﬁndings suggest that the interventions that include
components to target maladaptive thoughts or social cognitions
were most eﬃcacious (8). A review focused on older adults
found that most of
the interventions for loneliness were
delivered in a group-based format (66%) and often utilized
primarily educational interventions (9). The authors concluded
that the interventions that promoted social connections were
most eﬀective (9). Moreover,
information and
communication technology (e.g., social media and email) to
foster connectivity among the older adults is gaining attention.
The studies have demonstrated that greater access to and use
of technology among the older adults is associated with lower
depression, fewer chronic conditions, and greater perceived
social support, health, and subjective well-being (10, 11). These
ﬁndings suggest that the use of technology in late life can alleviate
loneliness as well as support mental and physical health.

the potential beneﬁts of utilizing
technology to promote social connectedness, and the inherent
social connectedness in group interventions, we examined
whether a multicomponent digital intervention may decrease
loneliness. The digital
intervention [Meru Health Program
(MHP)] is a therapist-supported program that incorporates
mindfulness and cognitive behavioral interventions to decrease
depression and anxiety. Furthermore, the MHP is delivered
in a group format with opportunities for social support
through the therapist-moderated discussion among the group
participants. Our previous work with middle-aged and older
adults has demonstrated that
the 8-week MHP program
led to signiﬁcant reductions in anxiety and depression (12)
and subjective improvements in multiple domains, such as
increased activity participation and improved social interactions
(13). Furthermore, other work has shown that
the skills
incorporated into MHP intervention, speciﬁcally mindfulness
skills, are found to reduce loneliness among the younger
adults (14). Additionally, brief behavioral interventions, such
as behavioral activation, are shown to decrease loneliness
among the home-bound older adults with depression (15, 16).

The present study aimed to extend previous ﬁndings on
the beneﬁts of the MHP on reducing depressive and anxiety
symptoms to two important domains: QoL and loneliness. This
study had two aims, which were to examine whether participation
in the MHP resulted in change in (1) mental health QoL and
(2) loneliness in a sample of middle aged and older adults with
the depressive symptoms. In an exploratory aim, we investigated
whether change in mindfulness was associated with change in
mental health QoL and loneliness.

Participants
Recruitment of the participants occurred between April 2019 and
March 2020 and between August 2020 and October 2020. The
advertisements consisted of ﬂyers posted on public community
boards, newspaper advertisements, and digital advertisements
(Craigslist and Facebook) targeting people aged 40 years and
older within the California Bay Area. During the COVID-19
pandemic, digital ads on Craigslist and Facebook linked to a
secure online contact survey became the primary source of
recruitment between August and September 2020.

The eligible participants were the residents from California,
with a smartphone capable of running the MHP app, and
had increased depressive symptoms deﬁned as Patients Health
Questionnaire nine-item Scores ≥7 [PHQ-9; (18)]. Exclusion
criteria applied during the initial telephone screen included
presence of bipolar disorder, potential psychosis assessed using
the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0.2 [MINI; (19)] psychosis
screening questions, substantial alcohol use as measured by the
AUDIT-C [AUDIT-C ≥ 5; (20)], possible cognitive impairment
as determined by the Short-Blessed Test [SBT ≥ 6; (21)],
active suicide ideation [P4 Suicide Risk Screener; (22)], and
participation in ongoing psychotherapy. The participants were
allowed to enroll if taking psychotropic medications as long as
they were on a stable dose for >30 days.

in the treatment studies (26). This measure was administered at
baseline, week 5, week 9, and post-treatment.

WHO QoL-Brief
Developed by the WHO, the WHO QoL-Brief (WHOQOL-
BREF) (27), has a total of 26 items related to ﬁve domains of
quality of life: overall QoL and general health, physical health,
psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Each
item is scored on a scale of one (very dissatisﬁed) to ﬁve (very
satisﬁed), thus higher scores indicated better QoL. Our variable
of interest was the psychological health subscale, which is referred
to as mental health QoL herein. This subscale contains items

related to body image, the frequency of positive and negative
feelings, self-esteem, spirituality, and thinking abilities (e.g.,
learning, memory, and concentration). This measure and its
subscales have demonstrated good psychometric properties, such
as discriminant and content validity, internal consistency, and
test-retest reliability (27). The WHOQOL-BREF was measured
at baseline and post-treatment.

UCLA Loneliness Scale
The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness
Scale (version 3; 28) is a 20-item measure of subjective
feelings of loneliness and social isolation. The items are scored
based on the frequency with which respondents perceive each
statement to be self-descriptive. The scores range from one
(never) to four (often), with higher scores indicating greater
loneliness. The UCLA Loneliness Scale is shown to have good
psychometric properties, such as high internal consistency, test-
retest reliability, convergent validity, and construct validity (28).
This measure was administered at baseline and post-treatment.

Procedures
Baseline Assessment
After determining eligibility through the telephone screen, the
participants attended a baseline visit (in person pre-COVID-19,
n = 42; over the telephone and via internet surveys after the
COVID-19 pandemic began, n = 8). The participants completed
questionnaires and partook in a semi-structured psychiatric
interview (MINI). At the end of the baseline assessment, the
eligible participants were provided with a brief overview of the
MHP enrollment process. After the visit, a research team member
referred the participant to Meru Health for MHP enrollment.
The MHP therapist or clinical coordinator set up a time for
the participant to have a brief intake call with the therapist.
The participant completed standard questionnaires as part of
the Meru Health intake process. The week prior to each group
starting, the participants received an email with instructions to
download the app and a unique link to sign into the app.

Intervention
The MHP v3.0 is 12-week mobile app-delivered intervention
grounded in mindfulness and cognitive behavioral techniques.
The MHP is delivered to a group of patients who work through
the program as a cohort overseen by a therapist. The app delivers
informational videos and guided practices that aim to help
manage depression, anxiety, and burnout (stress). App content
is delivered in the weekly themes that address topics, such as
mindfulness, thinking traps, self-compassion, values, sleep, and
nutrition. Additional program features include therapist (i.e.,
licensed marriage and family therapist or clinical social worker),
and anonymous peer support from other group members. The
therapist uses a dashboard to oversee the MHP progress of a
patient. The therapist interacts with the patients by sending
weekly informational emails, asynchronous secure messaging
within the app, and conducting phone/video calls when needed.
The peer support consists of therapist-moderated discussions
that allow the group members to anonymously share thoughts
and experiences with the practices. The group members can

respond to each other comments by selecting from a menu of
pre-determined responses (e.g., “that sounds hard).” Beyond this
study, MHP is available in the United States and Finland through
employer-based wellness plans, insurance, and university-based
mental health clinics.

Interim and Post-Treatment Assessments
The PHQ-9 and CAMS-R measures were collected at weeks 5 and
9 by phone or through secure online surveys according to the
preference of participants. The measures, such as PHQ-9, CAMS-
R, WHOQOL-BREF, and UCLA Loneliness Scale were completed
after the participants ﬁnished the 12-week MHP (in-person n =
29; by phone/internet surveys n = 17).

Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics were utilized to describe the sample
characteristics. Sample distribution kurtosis and skew were
reviewed. The sample was determined to be normally distributed,
so the parametric statistics were used. Using repeated measures
ANOVA models, we examined change from baseline to 12 weeks
for mental health QoL (WHOQOL-BREF psychological health
scale) and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) for the pre-
COVID-19 enrollees ﬁrst. Next, these analyses were conducted
with the entire sample, such as time of enrollment (pre-
vs. post-COVID-19) as a between-subjects factor. Alpha was
set at 0.05. The uncontrolled eﬀect sizes using hedge’s g
were calculated.

Correlates of change were examined in the exploratory
analyses. Change scores in mental health QoL were calculated
by subtracting the baseline score from the post-treatment
scores. For mental health QoL, positive change indicates
increase in scores), whereas for UCLA
improvements (i.e.,
Loneliness
scores, negative change indicates decrease in
loneliness (i.e., decline in scores). First, single-sample t-tests
assessed whether the changes were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
zero. Second, the linear regression analyses examined whether
the baseline variables were associated with change in the
dependent variables (mental health QoL and loneliness). Third,
the linear regression analyses examined whether change in
depression (PHQ-9) or mindfulness (CAMS-R) were associated
(mental health QoL
with change in dependent variables
and loneliness).

RESULTS

Participant Flow and Characteristics
Fifty-four participants completed the baseline assessments; two
were excluded (due to ineligibility) and two withdrew (due
to improved symptoms and privacy concerns) prior to their
MHP group start date (as shown in Figure 1). Thus, 50
participants with a mean age of 57.06 (SD = 11.26; range:
40–81 years) were enrolled in the MHP. About 60% (n =
30) of enrollees were female and the majority were white,
non-Hispanic (58%, n = 29),
followed by Asian (16%, n
= 8), and Black/African American individuals (10%, n =
5). Mean baseline PHQ-9 scores were 12.28 (SD = 5.47)
and fell in the moderate depressive symptom range (10–14).

Regarding the baseline psychiatric diagnoses, two-thirds (66.7%)
had either current major depressive disorder (28%; n = 14),
an anxiety disorder (16%; n = 8), or both major depressive
disorder and an anxiety disorder (26%; n = 13). Among the
remaining third of participants, 19% (n = 8) had another
current psychiatric disorder and 14% (n = 7) did not have any
current psychiatric disorders. Table 1 displays the participant
characteristics at baseline.

A repeated measures ANOVA examined change in mental

pre-COVID-19. Signiﬁcant
increase in mental health QoL
as measured with the WHOQOL-BREF psychological health
subscale were found with a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of time,
F(1,38) = 12.61, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.25. The uncontrolled eﬀect
size estimated using hedge’s g was 0.44. A second repeated
measures ANOVA was conducted for the combined sample
that included a variable to compare pre-COVID-19 enrollees
and post-COVID-19 enrollees as a between-subjects factor.
In this analysis with the combined sample, the increases in
mental health QoL held, with a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of
time, F(1,44) = 6.02, p = 0.018, η2 = 0.12. Additionally, the
main eﬀect of enrollment was signiﬁcant [F(1,44) = 4.70, p
= 0.036, η2 = 0.10], which demonstrated that the mental
health QoL for the pre-COVID-19 enrollees was higher than
that of post-COVID-19 enrollees (as shown in Figure 2A). The
interaction of enrollment and time was not signiﬁcant [F(1,44)
= 0.09, p = 0.770, η2 = 0.002], suggesting that the increased
mental health QoL were similar for pre- and post-COVID-
19 enrollees.

dashed line shows a non-signiﬁcant increase in loneliness for the post-COVID-19 enrollees. The error bars represent SEM.

Change in Loneliness
A repeated measures ANOVA examined change in loneliness
among the participants who enrolled in MHP pre-COVID-
19. A main eﬀect of time emerged, demonstrating signiﬁcant
decreases in loneliness, F(1,38) = 5.42, p = 0.025, η2 = 0.13.
The uncontrolled eﬀect size estimated using hedge’s g was
−0.24. A second analysis conducted with the combined sample
of participants enrolled pre- and post-COVID-19 found no
signiﬁcant main eﬀects for time [F(1,44) = 0.001, p = 0.977, η2
= 0.00] or enrollment [F(1,44) = 0.49, p = 0.486, η2 = 0.01].
Moreover, the interaction was not signiﬁcant, [F(1,44) = 2.88, p
= 0.097, η2 = 0.06). As seen in Figure 2B, it appears that non-
signiﬁcant increases in loneliness occurred for the participants
enrolled post-COVID-19.

Examining Correlates of Change
The initial step in examining correlates of change was to
determine whether the change scores signiﬁcantly diﬀered from
zero. For the pre-COVID-19 sample, change was signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from zero for both mental health QoL [t(38) = 3.55, p
= 0.001] and for loneliness [t(38) = −2.33, p = 0.025). When
including the post-COVID-19 enrollees, only mental health QoL
was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. Consequently, the linear
regression analyses focused on the pre-COVID-19 sample that
displayed signiﬁcant change in the dependent variables from
baseline to post-treatment. Next, we conducted a regression
model that included the baseline factors (i.e., PHQ-9 scores,
current depression and anxiety diagnoses, gender, and age) as
the independent variables. This analysis was not signiﬁcant,
indicating that the baseline factors were not signiﬁcant correlates
of change in QoL or loneliness (results not shown). Then,
we examined whether change in the depression symptoms
(PHQ-9) and in mindfulness (CAMS-R) from baseline to post-
treatment were predictors of change in QoL and in loneliness.
As displayed in Table 2, the regression analyses demonstrated

that mindfulness had a positive association with improved mental
health QoL (B = 0.43, p = 0.004) and a negative association
with loneliness (B = −0.40, p = 0.007). Change in the depressive
symptoms had a negative association with mental health QoL that
approached signiﬁcance (B = −0.29, p = 0.048). Change in the
depressive symptoms were signiﬁcantly and positively associated
with loneliness (B = 0.34, p = 0.019).

DISCUSSION

These ﬁndings show that the MHP, a therapist-supported digital
mental health intervention, was associated with increased mental
health QoL and decreased loneliness among the middle-aged and
older adults in a non-randomized pre-post study. Notably, the
improvements in mindfulness across treatment were associated
with increased mental health QoL and decreased loneliness. In
contrast, the declines in depression symptoms only corresponded
to the declines in loneliness. Taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest that one mechanism through which the MHP may
impact loneliness and mental health QoL is by improving
mindfulness. The ﬁnding that
the mindfulness component
of this intervention may reduce the subjective experience of
loneliness dovetails with ﬁndings of a recent dismantling study
that demonstrated that the combination of present focus and
acceptance skills from mindfulness resulted in the declines in
loneliness compared with present focus alone (13). Nonjudgment
and acceptance that is trained through mindfulness practice may
help alleviate maladaptive thought patterns and emotions that
accompany loneliness.

Although the future controlled studies need to replicate
these ﬁndings, this investigation extends prior ﬁndings that
support the reductions in psychiatric symptoms (12, 29–31) to
QoL and loneliness. The improvement in mental health QoL
likely correspond to the components of the MHP curriculum

Two regression analyses are displayed. Higher scores on the mental health quality of life (QoL) measure indicate better QoL. In contrast, higher loneliness scores indicate more loneliness.

that target not only depression and anxiety, but also address
the sleep diﬃculties and other mental health-related topics,
such as relationships, self-compassion, values, and eating habits.
Inclusion of therapist support likely contributes to the low
dropout rate found in this study compared with unsupported
digital interventions, which have higher drop-out rates and small
treatment eﬀects (32).

Loneliness negatively impacts physical, cognitive, and mental
health and longevity, particularly among the middle-aged and
older adults (2–6). Thus, the declines in loneliness following
participation in a therapist-supported digital mental health
intervention hold promise. Leveraging digital mental health
interventions may be a critical step in increasing access to the
eﬃcacious interventions that older adults otherwise would not
access due to scarcity of trained geriatric mental health providers
(33). Further research is needed to examine the MHP and similar
interventions in the controlled studies to better understand
variations of intervention outcomes by age.

One important caveat to these ﬁndings is that when a
historical event (COVID-19 pandemic) occurred,
initiating
shelter-in-place requirements for many participants, the decline
in loneliness no longer held. The increase in mental health QoL
remained signiﬁcant regardless of shelter-in-place status, which
highlights the potential beneﬁts of using the digital mental health
interventions for the middle-aged and older adults. It is possible
that restricting opportunities to socialize in person cannot
be overcome by the digital mental health interventions that
otherwise have the potential to decrease loneliness. Therapists
supporting the mobile health (mHealth) interventions may
need to tailor their approach during the COVID-19 pandemic
by encouraging the patients to make video calls and explore
possibilities of online interest groups and virtual meet-ups in
order to mitigate loneliness. The group support aspect of the
MHP has the potential to help participants with the feelings
of loneliness and subjective isolation in their mental health-
related struggles; however, our previous work has demonstrated
that this component was deemed to be less helpful than the
information provided within the app, the daily practices, and
support of the therapists (12). In contrast, for the younger
users, use of the group support feature in MHP predicted the

declines in depression scores (29). It is possible that using
preset responses for group members, while important from
a safety, risk reduction, and conﬁdentiality standpoint, may
limit engagement with this feature and reduce the usefulness
of the group support aspect of the intervention for the older
users in particular. Further consideration into incorporating the
meaningful peer interactions in mHealth interventions targeting
older users is needed.

Several limitations should be noted. First, this study lacked
a control condition,
thereby preventing any analyses or
conclusions regarding the eﬀect of the MHP on mental health
QoL or loneliness compared with other interventions. As our
study was not a dismantling study, it is possible that other
MHP intervention components, such as behavioral activation,
could have led to these improvements as well. Second, our
ﬁndings are limited by the small number of enrollees after the
COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions were enacted. Third, a
measurement of objective social isolation was not obtained,
thus limiting the interpretation of the ﬁndings, particularly
with regard to the diﬀerences among the pre-COVID-19 and
post-COVID-19 enrollees. Fourth, the sample was relatively
homogeneous, consisting of white, non-Hispanic individuals,
thus limiting information that can be gleaned about the eﬀects
of MHP among other groups. Fifth, our study was limited to the
participants who had access to a smartphone, thus potentially
limiting generalizability of the ﬁndings to those with higher
technology proﬁciency and higher socioeconomic status (i.e.,
those who could aﬀord such a device).
this

investigation provides
preliminary support for the eﬀect of a therapist-supported
mHealth intervention on yielding mental-health related QoL
beneﬁts, such as reduced loneliness. The regression analyses
suggest that the components of MHP targeting mindfulness
may be particularly important in yielding these mental health
beneﬁts. This study further demonstrates that older adults may
beneﬁt from the digital mental health interventions, which
may, in turn, increase their access to mental healthcare. Future
studies are needed to examine whether tailored therapist support
targeting loneliness may enhance the eﬀects of digital mental
health interventions on this growing problem.
