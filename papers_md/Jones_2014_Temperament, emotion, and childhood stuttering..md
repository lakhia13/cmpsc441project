Abstract

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief description of temperament and emotion, review 
empirical evidence pertaining to their possible association with childhood stuttering, and discuss 
possible clinical implications. In general, temperament is typically thought of as an individual's 
constitutionally (biologically) based behavioral proclivities. These proclivities often include 
emotional reactivity and self-regulation. Reactivity refers to arousal of emotions, motor activity, 
and attention, and self-regulation refers to the ability to moderate those tendencies.

The trait-like nature of temperament makes it potentially salient to our understanding of the onset 
and development of stuttering because temperamental tendencies may result in greater reactivity 
or difficulty in coping. Emotions, which are more state-like and variable, may influence the 
variation of stuttering commonly observed both within and between speaking situations. 
Temperament and emotion may serve as a causal contributor to developmental stuttering, with 
empirical findings indicating that preschool-aged children who stutter (CWS) exhibit differences 
in temperament and emotion when compared with children who do not stutter (CWNS). Given 
that empirical study of temperament in preschool-aged CWS is nascent, extensive discussion of 
clinical implications is challenging. With that caution, we present some early possibilities, 
including matching treatment approaches with the child's temperamental profile and using 
temperament as a predictor of treatment outcome.

meant to serve as a primer to (re)introduce speech-language pathologists to psychological 
constructs that are receiving increasing empirical investigation relative to speech-language 
development and a variety of disordered populations we serve1. The focus is on childhood 
stuttering, particularly the preschool-age group, the age cohort when speech and language 
abilities are developing and developmental stuttering typically begins. As we describe 
below, this article neither explicates nor implies that temperament and emotion are the sole 
cause of stuttering. Instead, it suggests that temperament and emotion may be importantly 
associated with the onset and development of the disorder for at least some preschool-age 
children who stutter (CWS)2.

Temperament and Emotion: Basic Definition and Characteristics

Temperament

We begin by briefly discussing temperament and emotion, as well as important 
characteristics of these psychological constructs. Most researchers and clinicians do not 
conceptualize temperament as a singular trait itself, but rather as a group of related traits3. 
Rothbart and Derryberry4, similar to Goldsmith and colleagues3, define temperament as 
individual differences in emotional reactivity and self-regulation. More specifically, they 
describe temperament as “…individual differences in emotional, motor, and attentional 
reactivity measured by latency, intensity and recovery of response, and self-regulation 
processes such as effortful control that moderate reactivity”4 (p. 207, as cited by Rothbart5). 
These characteristics are thought to be relatively stable over time, consistent across 
situations, and trait-like6. Further, there is growing consensus that temperamental traits are 
constitutionally- or biologically-based4,6,7 and that individual differences in temperament 
are genetically influenced8. However, Buss and Plomin point out that the biological basis for 
temperament does not necessarily render these characteristics set for life3. Rather, they 
suggest that these individual differences may vary and are open to environmental influences.

Emotional Reactivity and Regulation

Temperament is an overarching term for a collection of traits. With respect to emotional 
reactivity and regulation it can be thought of as an individual's relatively stable proclivity 
toward particular “types” of emotional reactivity (e.g., reaction to novelty) and regulation 
(e.g., shifting attention away from arousing stimuli). As such, temperament can be 
conceptualized as the season, that “sets” the general temperature parameters for a particular 
time of year, whereas emotion reactivity and regulation can be thought of as the temperature 
at a given moment, often following the trend of the season but capable of variability around 
that central tendency. As suggested above, two common components of emotion are 
Emotional Reactivity and Emotion Regulation. Researchers commonly compartmentalize 
these two emotional constructs for scientific investigations9, however, it can be argued that 
emotion and its regulation are inextricable, as they are co-occurring with infinite 
possibilities for interactions10.

For the purposes of this article, we will define both Emotional Reactivity and Emotion 
Regulation in an attempt to establish a common ground for their discussion. Emotional 
Reactivity can be thought of as an individual's tendency to experience frequent and intense

emotional arousal. Both negative and positive emotions are salient aspects of emotional 
reactivity11. Emotion Regulation involves the process of initiating, maintaining, or 
modulating the occurrence, intensity, or duration of emotional arousal12. First, it is worthy 
of noting that emotion and its regulation are not necessarily conscious processes. For 
example, Cole, Martin and Dennis define emotion as a “…process, a constant, vigilant 
process…which periodically reaches a level of detection for the person (i.e., a feeling) or an 
observer”9 (p. 319). A second important consideration is that emotions are often rapidly 
occurring processes (on the order of milliseconds). For example, LeDoux13 describes 
emotional behavior as “unconscious” and “quick,” whereas feelings are “conscious” and 
“slower”.

Measurement of Temperament and Emotion

Numerous methods have been used to empirically study temperament and emotion, although 
an exhaustive coverage of all such procedures exceeds the current space. Certainly, 
caregiver questionnaires have been most widely used to study temperment7. Behavioral 
observations14 have also been used, as well as various physiological methods such as 
salivary cortisol15, skin conductance16, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia17. Recently, 
neuroimaging18 and EEG/ERP19 have both emerged as measures used by researchers to 
study temperament and emotion. The relation among these measures may not always be 
straightforward and each method provides unique insights into temperament and emotional 
processes, with the “ideal” likely a multi-method approach, providing converging lines of 
evidence20, which should, at least in theory, provide a more comprehensive view of 
temperament than any singular means of measurement.

Caregiver rating scales—Caregiver rating scales have been the most widespread tools 
used to study children's temperament. These questionnaires assess various aspects of 
temperament, emotional reactivity and emotion regulation. Commonly used questionnaires 
include the Behavior Style Questionnaire21, The Children's Behavior Questionnaire22, the 
EAS Temperament Survey for Children: Parental Ratings23, and the Dimensions of 
Temperament Survey-Revised24One of the assets of these caregiver reports is that they are 
thought to represent the “average” of repeated observations over relatively long periods of 
time. Thus, when assessing temperament, a construct thought to be relatively stable over 
time, the “averaged” nature of these questionnaires is a strength and is undoubtedly one 
reason such instruments have garnered attention relative to other measures. The downside of 
caregiver rating scales or questionnaires is that they are less sensitive detecting expressions 
of temperament associated with changes in specific environmental contexts or conditions 
(e.g., first experience at a large holiday party). Some researchers have questioned the 
accuracy of parent reports and suggested that parents are biased informants14,25. In contrast, 
Henderson and Wachs26 suggest that “While parent report measures do contain some 
subjective parental components, available evidence indicates that these measures also 
contain a substantial objective component that does accurately assess children's individual 
characteristics” (p. 402).

Behavioral observations—Behavioral observations are another method used to assess 
temperament and emotional processes in children. Such observations can be made during a

variety of home, clinic, and experimental conditions. A major advantage is that this 
approach allows for the observation of temperament and emotion in specific contexts, with 
the downside being less generalizability across contexts and situations. One of the most 
widely used experimental procedures based on behavioral observations is Lab-TAB27, a 
procedure designed for the observation of child behavior during a variety of standard 
experimental situations (e.g., joy, fear, anger, activity level, interest). In general, behavioral 
observations are commonly coded using software designed specifically for the task (e.g., 
PROCODER28, Observer XT29). A major challenge with observations of children's behavior 
is establishing sufficient levels of inter-judge reliability, a time- and labor-intensive task. For 
a more detailed review of this methodology, see Rothbart and Goldsmith30.

Psychophysiology—Psychophysiological measures are a third means by which to assess 
childhood temperament and emotional processes. Methods include electroencephalography 
(EEG/ERP)19, salivary cortisol15, skin conductance31, fMRI18, and respiratory sinus 
arrhythmia32 (for further review see Porges33). These measures are usually thought to be 
among some of the more objective indexes of emotion because they do not rely on parent or 
observer judgments and can be made during a variety of experimental situations; however, 
like behavioral observations, the generalizability of these data to other contexts is less 
straightforward. Another characteristic of psychophysiological measures is that they can be 
made with young children who have had very little experience with their speech-language 
disorders, which may help in better determining the “directionality effect”34 (e.g., disorder 
→ temperament/emotion vs. temperament/emotion → disorder). Using psychophysiological 
methods with preschool-age children poses challenges, such as optimizing participant 
cooperation and limiting movement that may produce artifacts in the data. Lastly, similar to 
behavioral measures, psychophysiological measures require trained individuals to perform 
data collection as well as data reduction and analysis.

Temperament and Emotion: Implications for Speech-Language Development

We begin our discussion of the possible association between temperament, emotion and 
childhood stuttering by first considering how temperament may be associated with general 
speech-language development. Two apparent possibilities involve the notion that 
temperament and emotion may indirectly and/or directly impact speech-language 
development35. As discussed by Salley and Dixon36, a direct influence might consist of “…
children's difficult temperaments…limit[ing] the extent to which they can process 
linguistically relevant information during language acquisition events” (p. 131). They 
suggest that, “…when children are very high in negative affectivity, a relatively greater 
burden is placed on their behavioral control systems, which must regulate this negative 
affectivity. The end result is fewer resources available for linguistically relevant activities 
such as paying attention to word-referent associations when learning novel labels” (pp. 
131-132). As an example of such direct influence, Bloom and Capatides37 reported that 
children who spent more time in relatively neutral affective states exhibited language 
achievements such as first words and vocabulary spurts at younger ages than children who 
spent more time in positive or negative emotional states. Of course, the notion that 
emotional states influence language achievement (i.e., emotion → language achievement) 
does not preclude the possibility that difficulty with language development may also

influence the same emotional states (i.e., emotion ← language achievement). Regarding 
indirect influences, Salley and Dixon suggest that “…the kind and duration of interpersonal 
exchanges entered into by temperamentally difficult children may be different than those 
entered into by easy-going children, and these interpersonal relationships may have 
differential consequences for language acquisition” (p. 132). For example, a shy child may 
engage in fewer communicative interactions, thus decreasing his or her exposure to speech-
language and opportunities to “practice” their emerging language skills. Although the 
impact of temperament/emotion on speech-language development is not well understood, 
empirical findings discussed below suggest that there may be a relation between the two.

Generally speaking, speech-language development involves three inter-related sub-domains, 
that is, syntactic (grammar), lexical (words) and phonological (sounds) processes. Of these, 
vocabulary, or lexical acquisition and storage, has received extensive attention relative to 
childhood temperament38–43. Results from these empirical studies indicate that children with 
stronger receptive and expressive vocabularies, compared to those with weaker 
vocabularies, exhibited greater soothability, longer attention spans, less distractibility, 
greater adaptability, more positive moods, and less emotionality. Dixon and Smith39 
reported that attentional control and positive affect predicted language production and 
comprehension, a finding that led them to suggest that temperament may impact language 
development through attention and positive emotionality. Thus, it is possible that 
temperament-based “skills”, such as attention and emotion regulation, or “characteristics”, 
such as positive emotionality, may facilitate language-learning opportunities thereby 
influencing vocabulary development.

Regarding syntactic processing, Slomkowski, Nelson, Dunn, and Plomin44 reported that 
affect-extraversion (high interest in persons, cooperativeness and happiness, and low 
fearfulness) at age two predicted both receptive and expressive language at age three and 
receptive language at age seven. Relatedly, researchers45 have used measures such as 
latency to the sixth spontaneous comment during conversation with an unfamiliar 
experimenter to assess children's behavioral inhibition (a temperamental characteristic 
expressed as initial avoidance, distress, or subdued emotion when a person encounters novel 
people, places or situations46,47). The “latency to the sixth spontaneous comment” measure 
is based on the notion that behaviorally inhibited children tend to produce fewer 
spontaneous comments in a novel context. Therefore, the relation between language and 
temperament appears to have empirical support. However, the precise nature of the relation 
remains unclear, for example, does temperament predict language development, language 
development predict temperament, or is there a bi-directional relation between the two?

Recently, Conture, Kelly, and Walden1 reviewed issues and empirical evidence regarding 
temperamental characteristics that may be related to (a)typical speech and language 
development. Their overview provides an in-depth description and definition of 
temperament and discusses many ways temperament and speech-language development may 
interact. They review research linking temperament and emotion to specific speech-language 
disabilities including specific language impairment, stuttering, and voice disorders. 
Therefore, whereas the current paper focuses on temperament and stuttering, there is 
mounting evidence that temperament and emotion may play a role in various aspects of

speech-language development as well as speech-language disorders other than stuttering. 
For example, researchers in Australia reported that in a sample of 4,983 children, more 
reactive temperaments predicted speech and language impairment, whereas more persistent 
and sociable temperaments were protective factors48.

Temperament, Emotion and Stuttering

Regarding the relation between early childhood stuttering, temperament and emotion, in 
2012 Kefalianos, Onslow, Block, Menzies, and Reilly49 published a review of extant 
empirical findings in this area and tentatively concluded that there may be a relation 
between the two (for earlier similar discussions, see Conture50; Seery, Watkins, 
Mangelsdorf, & Shigeto51). The cautious nature of their conclusions was based on the small 
number of studies (n = 10) reviewed as well as inconsistencies among reported findings. 
However, there were also consistencies. Specifically, they reported that preschool-age 
(CWS), compared to children who do not stutter (CWNS), exhibit (1) lower adaptability 
(three independent replications), (2) lower attention span/persistency (three independent 
replications), and (3) more negative quality of mood (two independent replications). Despite 
the fact that the above review was published in 2012, in the ensuing year or so at least six 
new empirical studies52–57, to be discussed below, have been published, improving our 
ability to evaluate the possible relation between temperament, emotion and stuttering.

In the following sections, we first discuss findings that have compared the temperamental 
characteristics of preschool-age CWS to their CWNS peers. We then discuss research on the 
association between temperament and emotion and changes in the frequency of stuttering 
(instances of stuttering) within preschool-age CWS. Table 1 summarizes these empirical 
studies on the temperamental and emotional characteristics of young children who stutter.

Temperament and Emotion: Children Who Stutter Compared to Children Who do not 
Stutter

Evidence comparing CWS and CWNS on temperamental and emotional variables has been 
derived from caregiver reports, behavioral observations and psychophysiology. Results 
pertaining to emotion reactivity indicate that preschool-age CWS, compared to CWNS, are 
more emotionally reactive58, more negative in their affect/emotions57,59,60, and higher in 
anger/frustration, approach, and motor activation61. Relative to attentional and regulatory 
abilities, CWS, compared to CWNS, are less able to maintain or shift attention when 
appropriate61–63, more problematic on caregiver ratings of attention64, less efficient at 
orienting attention54 (cf. Johnson et al.55), less able to ignore irrelevant background 
stimuli65, less adaptive to their environment59,66, less able to regulate their emotions or 
attention58, and lower in inhibitory control53,61. (Although not reported to date, to the 
present authors' knowledge, the potential role of blood glucose, possibly one salient part of 
the energy source for self-control or self regulation67–69, has not been studied in children, 
teens or adults who stutter.) In contrast to the above studies, there have been reports that 
CWS, when compared to CWNS, are less negative and more adaptable70, and similar in 
temperament and social-emotional development71. Thus, although there is not perfect 
consensus, there is mounting evidence–based on 12 published studies–that negative affect,

differences in attentional processes, and lower adaptability may be associated with 
childhood stuttering.

The above empirical studies employed caregiver reports and behavioral observations, 
methods that assess more overt aspects of temperament and emotion. Psychophysiological 
means for empirically studying temperament and emotion assess more covert aspects of 
these domains. As an example of this approach, researchers have measured the stress 
hormone cortisol and reported equivocal results indicating that CWS, compared to CWNS, 
exhibited (1) lower levels of cortisol during selected sampling times throughout the day 
(morning, noon, and evening)72, and (2) no differences in cortisol73. At present, however, it 
is difficult to interpret the implications of these findings because they are based on different 
comparison groups (i.e., use of published norms vs. control groups) as well as relatively 
small sample sizes (the latter calling to question a study's ability to reject the null hypothesis 
of no difference between groups). We anticipate that this will be an emerging area of interest 
relative possible associations between temperament and emotion with childhood stuttering.

Temperament and Emotion: The Disfluencies of Children Who Stutter

Findings from recent research indicate an association between the behavior of stuttering 
(stuttered disfluencies) and temperamental characteristics and emotional processes. 
Specifically, for preschool-age CWS, their stuttered disfluencies increased (a) during a 
positive emotion condition (i.e., receiving a desirable gift)60, (b) when duration and 
frequency of regulatory strategies was low74, and (c) when high emotional arousal/reactivity 
was accompanied by lower emotion regulation52. In contrast, stuttering frequency was 
decreased lower in narrative tasks that followed diverting attention away from preceding 
non-speech tasks57. Further, more behaviorally inhibited CWS (i.e., children exhibiting 
strong reactions to novelty, change and difference), when compared to less behaviorally 
inhibited CWS, exhibited more stuttering during a conversation with an unfamiliar 
experimenter56. Therefore, similar to between-group differences (CWS vs. CWNS), some 
consistencies in the data relating temperament, emotion and childhood stuttering are 
beginning to emerge. Specifically, CWS' temperament and emotional processes appear to be 
associated with their frequency of stuttering, a finding similar to that indicating increased 
sympathetic arousal prior to stuttering for adults who stutter (AWS)75,76.

Theoretical Account for the Role of Temperament and Emotion in Childhood Stuttering

Temperament and emotion are included as important causal factors in Conture and Walden's 
recent Dual Diathesis-Stressor Model of Stuttering2. There are three key components of this 
model; (1) the diathesis (vulnerability or predisposition for a given process or disorder), (2) 
the stressor (an event that disrupts the homeostasis or equilibrium of an individual), and (3) 
the interaction of diathesis and stressor, whereby “stress activates a diathesis, transforming 
the potential of predisposition into the presence of psychopathology” (p. 406)1. For 
preschool-age CWS, temperamental characteristics of heightened negative affect, lower 
adaptability to environmental change, and decreased capacity for emotion and attention 

1It should be noted that neither Conture and Walden nor the present authors are suggesting that stuttering is a psychopathology or that 
temperamental/emotional processes are the main/sole “cause” of stuttering

regulation can be thought of as part of the emotional diathesis that may contribute to the 
pathogenesis of stuttering. One might speculate that children with these proclivities or 
tendencies may be at increased risk for developing stuttered speech (onset) as well as 
negative reactions to stuttering and less resilience in coping with the disorder over time 
(development and persistence). Furthermore, relatively frequent and/or intense emotional 
responses during social-communicative situations may divert CWS's attentional resources 
away from speech-language planning and production, particularly during challenging 
conditions.

The above brief overview describes some potentially salient possibilities regarding how 
temperament characteristics and/or emotional processes may act as causal and/or 
exacerbating contributor(s) to the development of stuttering and variations in stuttering both 
between- and within-situations. Alternatively, one may hypothesize that differences in 
temperament and emotion result from experiences with stuttering.

Given the notion that temperament is a set of constitutionally-based individual differences 
(differences, as mentioned above, that may be genetically influenced8), can be observed 
from birth/infancy, and are relatively stable across time, it is unlikely that temperamental 
differences between CWS and CWNS at or very near the onset of the disorder are solely a 
result of experience with stuttering. Of course, this debate will not be settled in the present 
paper. However, the above review provides some insights into a few of the many possible 
ways in which temperament and emotion may be associated with childhood stuttering.

Temperament and Childhood Stuttering: Clinical Implications

How might the various findings and/or issues discussed in this paper inform diagnostic and 
treatment protocols for childhood stuttering? We tread cautiously into the clinical arena 
based on our belief that alterations to clinical practice, as much as possible, should be 
grounded in sound theory, empirical findings, and evidence-based practice as well as 
practice-based evidence. With this in mind, especially given the nascent stage of 
development of empirical support for the association between temperament, emotion and 
stuttering, it is not feasible, possible, nor wise to presently provide extensive implications 
for clinical practice. For example, our present understanding of temperament, emotion and 
stuttering are not such that we can recommend attempting to directly modify or “train” or 
“remediate” emotion processes (e.g., train emotion regulation). That said, we also cannot 
equivocally write-off the possibility that emotion regulatory abilities may be impacted by 
clinical intervention(s) for stuttering and vice versa.

Indeed, one well-reasoned approach to the application of current information/understanding 
of the association of temperament/emotion and childhood stuttering, we believe, would be 
consistent with Ellis Weismer's77 advice to the field of child language remediation to shift 
attention toward identifying “…variables that might predict which programs are relatively 
more efficient in producing specific desired outcomes, which may differ from child to child, 
rather than defend the premise that one type of approach was globally superior to any 
others” (p. 182, as described by Nan Bernstein Ratner78). That said, below are offered some 
tentative suggestions regarding potential areas in which temperament may be relevant to

clinical practice: 1) goodness of fit, 2) the child in therapy versus the type of therapy, 3) 
treatment outcomes, and 4) future directions. This is done with the caveat that additional, 
new information about temperament, emotion and their possible association to stuttering has 
the real potential for further modifying our suggestions for clinical practice.

“Goodness of fit” Between the Child in Treatment and the Type of Treatment

A common question asked by speech-language pathologists is whether treating a child 
exhibiting an apparently vulnerable temperament (e.g., high emotional reactivity or 
behavioral inhibition) would ameliorate the child's stuttering. As mentioned above, we are 
not recommending direct modification of children's temperament and emotional processes. 
There are several reasons for this, and among them is that temperamental vulnerabilities, 
proclivities or tendencies do not represent, based on our present knowledge, a frank 
disorder. Certainly, a child's difference in approach to daily life activities may render their 
behaviors during these activities overtly different from their peers, but this difference, in 
most cases, is neither a clinically significant disorder nor psychopathology. However, a 
temperamental characteristic (e.g., consistently strong reaction to new situations, tasks and 
people) does not have to be clinically significant to impact clinical outcomes, but we 
presently do not know if any temperamental characteristics are important for diagnosis and 
treatment of stuttering (although, it is possible that with further research attentional 
processes, negative affect, inhibitory control and adaptability to novelty, change and 
differences may be found to be salient to our understanding and treatment of childhood 
stuttering). Certainly, at present, there are no empirical data that support the notion that 
systematically “training” selected temperament characteristics (e.g., effortful control) and 
emotional processes (e.g., emotional arousal) would appreciably impact stuttering.

Rather, we cautiously suggest that individuals' temperament be viewed not as a therapy 
target but an important piece of information that can be used to determine which treatment 
regimen might be employed to achieve the best outcome (or to help select another regimen, 
seemingly best suited for a child when their initial treatment, after a reasonable timeframe of 
application, does not result in sufficient improvement). This view is based on a well-known 
concept of “goodness of fit” formulated by Thomas and Chess79 who posited that “goodness 
of fit” results when environmental expectations (e.g., covert/overt parental performance 
requirements) are in accord with the child's expressed temperament (e.g., emotional 
vulnerability).

According to this model, as Rothbart80 suggests, children are considered an “…active agent 
in their own development” (p. 33-34), a perspective in contrast with the notion that 
children's individual differences are solely due to parental influence, or “…the child's history 
of rewards and punishments” (p. 30). According to Thomas and Chess, the issue was not so 
much the “wrongness” of the child's environment or the child's temperament as much as the 
fit or match between the child's temperament and the expectations/requirements of specific 
contexts. To clinically apply or consider such “matching,” the clinician needs to understand 
not only the similarities between the child in treatment and his or her peers, but also how the 
child may differ from other children. Such understanding may inform the clinician's decision 
to adjust the child's treatment regimen accordingly, if and when necessary, particularly when

progress is not being made and/or relapse occurs. For as much as we might like one standard 
form of treatment for all preschool-age, school-age, teenage and adults who stutter, some 
clients' individual differences can and do confound such strictly-adhered to standardization, 
just as they do for aspirin, penicillin and dietary regimens among the patient populations of 
medical practitioners. Or as Rothbart suggests when discussing Escalona's81 notion of 
“effective experience,” “…events in children's lives are experienced only as they are filtered 
through the individual child's nervous system, so that an environmental event is not the same 
for all” (p. 30). For example, one may speculate, indirect therapy2, compared to direct 
therapy, may be more effective in reducing stuttering frequency for emotionally reactive 
children who have greater vulnerabilities for or less resiliency to cope with everyday life 
hassles (e.g., getting out of bed and off to school on time), acute stressors (e.g., having a 
bicycle accident on the way to school) or chronic stressors (e.g., having a school teacher 
who routinely exhibits little tolerance for mistakes, imperfection and/or slowness to learn). 
This may be the case because indirect therapy is thought to impose less communicative/
social requirements on the child, thus better “matching” with the child whose temperament 
is more reactive to stress associated with communication and social interactions (again, 
keeping in mind the notion that an “environmental experience is not the same for all” given 
each child's “filtering” the experience through his or her individual, unique “nervous 
system”). In other words, indirect treatment may represent a better “fit” for the child who 
frequently and relatively strongly exhibits emotional reactions to stress, whether everyday 
life hassles, acute or chronic in nature. Conversely, indirect therapy may not be as efficient 
or effective in reducing stuttering frequency for emotionally less reactive children, who are 
less prone to stress and are known to be less likely to respond strongly to environmentally 
stressful conditions83. For these children, direct therapy that explicitly help the children 
learn how to change their speech and related behaviors may represent the most efficacious 
route to effective change and best “fit” or match the child's temperamental and emotional 
characteristics.

Again, the above suggestions for matching treatment type to child are tentative until further 
empirical studies assess whether indirect therapy for childhood stuttering, compared to 
direct therapy for childhood stuttering, is more effective (short-, medium- or long-term) for 
emotionally reactive CWS and less effective for CWS who are less emotionally reactive. 
That said, the aforementioned suggestions might assist clinicians in their initial 
considerations regarding whether therapy should be direct, indirect or a meld of the two and 
when such treatment should start for the optimal therapy outcome. For example, for a CWS 
known to strongly react to change, the starting point of formal treatment may need to be 
adjusted if, on the basis of parental, teacher and/or SLP input/observations, the child is 
frequently and intensively expressing difficulties adjusting to a new house, new town and/or 
new school. In this case, treatment may need to begin once such expressions of difficulty 
adjusting to changes in his or her environment have subsided. Of course, at present, there are 
few established guidelines available to make such decisions3. This is especially true for 
clinicians who desire to directly treat stuttering at inception, but are reluctant to do so due to 

2Conture82 (p.143-144) described indirect therapy as “any approach that does not explicitly, overtly or directly try to manipulate, 
modify or change the child's speech fluency in specific and oral communication skills in general.” Conture also described direct 
therapy as any approach that “involves explicit, overt, and direct attempts to modify the child's speech and related behavior.”

the possibility that this may make the child inappropriately aware of, concerned, or unduly 
worry about his/her disfluency, which may in turn, for some children, inappropriately focus 
the child on the accuracy, fluency and/or speed of their speech-language planning and 
production. (For further discussion of the unintended, possibly negative, consequences of 
treatment the interested reader is referred to related considerations in the field of 
psychology85.) With the above suggestions as a guide, clinicians may give some 
consideration to providing direct therapy to less reactive CWS but less apt to provide direct 
therapy to more reactive CWS (especially if a direct approach results in relapse and/or less 
than satisfactory outcome). In other words, such considerations could be one means for the 
clinician to provide a therapy best tailored to a child's specific needs.

Striking a Balance Between Focusing on the Child in Treatment and the Type of Treatment

Based on the above discussion, there appears to be potential for the temperamental 
characteristics of preschool-age CWS to have meaningful impact on various clinical issues. 
For example, if a child's temperament “filters” his or her experiences, then perhaps it is 
possible that it may also filter the child's experiences with treatment and hence possibly 
impact treatment outcome. Such impact need not be deleterious, of course. Temperamental 
characteristics may also enhance treatment outcome or even be minimally associated with 
the child's treatment experiences and outcome. At this point we simply don't know. To 
achieve such knowledge, we will need to remember that (1) temperament is an omnibus or 
umbrella term for a variety of constitutionally- or biologically-based characteristics, from 
extraversion to self-regulation, and (2) that “individual differences” (in such characteristics) 
are part of the very definition of temperament.

Accordingly, not all events or experiences, whether during treatment or daily life activities, 
are precisely the same for all children. This is true even if all children receive the same form 
of treatment, individual differences in children's temperament may differentially filter their 
experiences with that treatment. This is not to suggest that we begin to “de-standardize” 
data-based, well-documented treatment protocols for childhood stuttering and start tailoring 
each and every child's treatment to each child's temperamental characteristics. To do so 
would be a rush to judgment until we know more, much more about the association of 
temperament and treatment of childhood stuttering. (Interestingly, there is a growing 
movement in medicine to do something very similar, that is, tailor well-established 
treatment regimens to individual client's genetic/DNA profiles).

Neither are we suggesting that our treatment protocols for childhood stuttering, standardized 
or not, remain treatment-centric. Instead, we are suggesting striking some sort of balance 
between procedural- and child-centricity in our clinical treatment of childhood stuttering. 
This means giving as much focus on the child in treatment as we do the type of treatment. 
Simply put, we need to know much more than we currently do about those temperamental 
characteristics of children who succeed (and fail) in treatments for stuttering, whether those 

3To these authors' knowledge, there is no across-discipline agreement regarding or set formula for making a decision about whether to 
employ indirect, direct or a combination of the two approaches to therapy. Factors commonly used to aid in this decision include: 1) 
the degree of a child's cognitive awareness and/or emotional concern about stuttering, 2) the effectiveness of previously implemented 
indirect therapy84, and 3) the events associated with/characteristics of a child's stuttering (e.g., time since onset, frequency and 
severity of stuttering, and the nature and/or frequency of parents' reactions to or concerns regarding their child's stuttering82).

treatments are based on direct, indirect and mixed models of intervention. Results of future 
empirical studies may indicate that temperamental predictors of success or failure in 
treatment are crosscutting, regardless of the nature of treatment. That would be helpful, 
important information. Unfortunately, at present we lack such information. In particular, we 
need empirical, objective information about temperament that are based on converging lines 
of evidence, that is, full-scale (not short-form or screening) caregiver-report-based 
questionnaires, coded behavioral observations and psychophysiology. This paucity of 
information challenges our comprehensive understanding of this association as well as our 
theoretical and treatment approaches to childhood stuttering. As one initial attempt to 
provide such information, the following section is presented.

Treatment Outcome

In addition to the possibility that clinicians might consider matching children's temperament 
to the type of treatment they receive, there is some evidence that temperamental 
characteristics of preschool-age CWS (obtained at the time of diagnosis) may be useful as a 
tool to predict treatment outcome. This possibility seems consistent with the theoretical 
perspective that temperament and emotions may exacerbate the development and 
maintenance of the disorder86. In essence, through direct or indirect influences of 
temperament and emotion36 on the development of stuttering, preschool-age CWS may 
either be: 1) at greater risk for persistent stuttering (regardless of stuttering intervention), or 
2) less able to benefit from the positive affects of treatment. With continued empirical 
research in this area, the consideration of temperament data (that can be collected during a 
diagnostic evaluation) to predict treatment outcome may be shown to be useful for the 
practicing speech-language pathologist.

Recently, Richels and Conture87 examined various components of diagnostic evaluations 
and their potential utility as predictive measures of short-term (data taken from the first 12 
sessions of treatment) as well as long-term (data taken from a minimum of 12 sessions to the 
end of treatment) treatment outcome, with treatment outcome based on each CWSs 
frequency of stuttered disfluencies. In order to assess short-term change, they used a 
statistical procedure to group the children with different longitudinal trajectories of 
disfluency from the children's first 12 sessions of participation in an indirect treatment 
program. They identified “Improved” (n = 19), “No Change” (n = 10), and “Worsened” 
(n=13) groups. Findings indicated that children in the “Improved”, compared to the 
“Worsened” group, were (a) significantly older, (b) exhibited higher percentages of stuttered 
disfluencies, and consequently higher severity scores, and (c) marginally lower articulation 
scores.

For the analysis of long-term change, these researchers assessed change in stuttered, 
nonstuttered, and total disfluencies over the course of treatment rather than grouping by 
trajectory. Unlike the case with short-term predictors of change, speech disfluencies at the 
diagnostic visit did not predict long-term outcomes. Given this, these researchers used 
“emotional” and “speech-language” variables in attempts to predict long-term change in 
stuttering. A regression analysis indicated that children with more expressive temperaments 
(i.e., lower levels of behavioral inhibition) exhibited the greatest decrease in stuttered and

total disfluencies as a result of treatment. In other words, the CWS who exhibited less 
proclivities to behavioral inhibition, exhibited the greatest decrease or change in stuttering 
(for further discussion of the possible association of behavioral inhibition and childhood 
stuttering see Choi et al56). Further, there was a marginally significant decrease in the ratio 
of stuttered to total disfluencies as a result of therapy for children with lower language 
abilities. These results suggest that when planning for and attempting to predict long-term 
change in children's stuttering, clinicians may want to also consider measures besides those 
related solely to speech disfluency.

As discussed by Richels and Conture, one of the most interesting results of this work (and 
most applicable to the current paper) was that those children with more expressive 
temperaments exhibited the greatest long-term decrease in stuttering as a result of treatment. 
The longitudinal nature of these clinical data indicate that emotional and speech-language 
variables have the potential to differentiate preschool-age CWS with high versus low 
potential for benefiting from treatment, of at least the indirect treatment studied by Richels 
and Conture. Obviously, this area of inquiry needs more longitudinal empirical exploration. 
Of course, whereas these results are seemingly applicable to clinical practice, Richels and 
Conture point out that they are based on two relatively small studies from one clinic and 
must await independent replication.

Future Directions

This overview, and others like it1,49,51 make apparent that temperament is associated with 
early (a)typical speech-language development, at least for some children. What this 
overview does not indicate, because data are not presently available, is (a) what extant 
theory best accounts for this association; (b) which temperamental characteristics, if any, are 
most salient to (a)typical speech-language development, especially stuttering; (c) whether 
the nature of this association is correlational, causal or exacerbating; and (d) what methods, 
if any, for the study of temperament and emotion are, for the purposes of clinical practice 
and empirical research, replicable, reliable and salient to the association of temperament and 
(a)typical speech-language development.

From a research perspective, investigators are encouraged to consider concurrently 
employing several methods to achieve a more comprehensive view of temperament. Such 
multi-methods approaches are not foreign to speech-language pathologists. For example, 
speech-language pathologists use such an approach in the study of speech sound articulation, 
employing perceptual, acoustic and physiological methods to circumscribe the issues under 
study. Investigators are also encouraged to move beyond mean difference comparisons (e.g., 
CWS exhibit greater negative affect than CWNS), and into the realm of within-group 
analysis of subtypes and/or clusters of CWS. Logistic regression analyses are well-suited to 
determine what temperamental characteristics, if any, predict speech-language disorder, both 
when tested by themselves as well as concurrently with other potential predictors (e.g., 
motor, language, etc.). Likewise, there is need to “shift the paradigm” such that 
temperamental characteristics are viewed not merely as risk but also possibly protective 
factors for (a)typical speech-language disorders (for example of such an approach, see 
Harrison & McLeod48).

From a clinical perspective, clinicians should expect empirical findings regarding the 
association of temperament and stuttering to continue to emerge in the coming years. As 
with many lines of investigation, some of these findings will be used to test extant and 
newly-emerging theory, some findings will be mainly descriptive in nature, some findings 
will have no apparent, immediate clinical applicability and some findings will likely 
contradict other findings. How to best evaluate this nascent field of study? Carefully, of 
course, employing a comprehensive, but critical view of the entirety of evidence, to best 
understand the whole as well as its parts.

In advance of published and/or commercially-available tests for discerning between-group 
(i.e., CWS vs. CWNS) as well as within-group (i.e., CWS who persist vs. CWS who 
recover) differences in temperament, clinicians may consider observing CWS who seem to 
improve versus those who do not during treatment. For example, a clinician may observe a 
child struggling in treatment who exhibits seemingly incompatible or contrasting (speech-
language) abilities and (temperamental) characteristics. Specifically, the child may 
concurrently exhibit strong speech-language abilities (based on results of standardized tests 
of speech-language, which suggest the child's has the ability to readily communicate) and a 
temperamental characteristic to strongly react to novelty, change and differences. In this 
example, one might speculate, the child's potential for/ability to engage communicatively/
socially contrasts with his or her temperamental unwillingness to do so. This may be 
particularly apparent when the child enters into new communication/social situations 
involving relatively unfamiliar conversational partners. It may, therefore, behoove the 
clinician to assist the child–as part but not the entirety of the child's treatment program–
through the use of gentle, gradual and supportive procedures, to better deal with novelty, 
change and difference, especially in situations involving communication. This is but one 
possible example of how temperamental characteristics might interact with speech, language 
and fluency skills in young children, with a better understanding of such possible 
interactions awaiting future study.

In conclusion, the field of speech-language pathology has come a long way from early 
speculations that psychoanalytical constructs (e.g., arrested oral needs centering around 
nursing) caused stuttering, speculation that was seldom empirically examined. These early 
conceptualizations have gradually become overtaken by a more contemporary view of the 
association of temperament, emotion and stuttering. This contemporary view suggests that 
childhood stuttering may be associated with constitutionally-based temperamental/emotional 
processes, many of which are believed to be open to environmental influences. A nascent 
line of evidence supports this contemporary view. And although we have come a long way, 
we are still far from the end. More empirical studies, theories and clinical applications will 
need to be put forth before we better understand how, when and whether temperament takes 
its place under the tent of causal contributors to childhood stuttering.
