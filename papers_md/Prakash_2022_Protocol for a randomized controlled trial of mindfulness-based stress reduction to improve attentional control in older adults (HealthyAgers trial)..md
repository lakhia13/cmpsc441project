Abstract 
Background:  Mindfulness meditation is a form of mind–body intervention that has increasing scientific support for 
its ability to reduce age‑related declines in cognitive functioning, improve affective health, and strengthen the neural 
circuitry supporting improved cognitive and affective health. However, the majority of existent studies have been 
pilot investigations with small sample sizes, limited follow‑up data, and a lack of attention to expectancy effects. Here, 
we present the study design of a Phase I/II, efficacy trial—HealthyAgers trial—that examines the benefits of a manual‑
ized mindfulness‑based stress reduction program in improving attentional control and reducing mind‑wandering in 
older adults.

Methods:  One hundred fifty older adults (ages 65–85 years) will be randomized into one of two groups: an eight‑
week mindfulness program or an eight‑week, placebo‑controlled, lifestyle education program. Behavioral and 
neuroimaging assessments are conducted before and after the training. Participants are then invited to booster ses‑
sions once every three months for a period of 12 months with post‑intervention follow‑up assessments conducted 
at 6‑months and 12‑months. The primary outcomes for the study are behavioral measures of attentional control and 
mind‑wandering. Additional, secondary outcomes include network strength in an a  priori defined neuromarker of 
attentional control, fluid and everyday cognition, emotion regulation strategy use, and markers of inflammation.

Discussion:  This study will establish the efficacy of a group‑based, low‑cost mind–body intervention for the inter‑
related facets of attentional control and mind‑wandering in older adults. Strengths of this study include a well‑
designed, placebo‑controlled comparison group, use of web/mobile application to track study adherence, and 
longitudinal follow‑up.

population)  [1].  Maintaining  cognitive  faculties  is  an 
important  public  health  goal  as  cognitive  functioning 
is  highly  related  to  well-established  markers  of  physi-
cal  health,  like  systemic  inflammation  [2,  3],  and  plays 
a critical role in activities that help maintain independ-
ent living, like driving [4], and in emotion dysregulation 
[5–7].  Thus,  cognitive  functioning  has  direct  implica-
tons  for  the  well-being  and  satisfaction  of  older  adults 
[8].  Age-related  declines  in  cognitive  functioning  have 
been  noted  across  the  domains  of  processing  speed, 
working memory, executive control of attention, cogni-
tive control, and episodic memory [9–11], with declines 
in some domains of cognition beginning as early as the 
mid-30s [12]. Moreover, behavioral shifts in measures of 
cognitive functioning are also accompanied by concom-
itant  shifts  in  the  functional  and  structural  integrity  of 
the  aging  brain  with  older  adults  showing  neural  dedi-
fferentiation—the  reduced  recruitment  of  specialized 
canonical  networks  and  nodes  during  cognitive  tasks 
with  increasing  age  [13,  14]. These  age-related  declines 
in  cognitive  functioning,  both  behavioral  and  neural 
representations,  are  thought  to  be  undergirded  by  the 
increase  in  task  irrelevant  observations  with  advanc-
ing age. Older adults demonstrate a failure to maintain 
attentional sets, to computationally prioritize task-rele-
vant  information,  and  to  limit  attentional  overprocess-
ing  of  task-irrelevant  information,  resulting  in  notable 
declines in higher-order control operations [15–17].

However,  despite  a  more  nuanced  and  in-depth 
understanding  of  the  cognitive  and  neural  changes 
associated  with  aging,  the  health  field’s  capacity  to 
translate  these  findings  into  pragmatic,  efficacious 
remediation methods remains limited. Cognitive train-
ing  programs  show  modest  improvements  in  overall 
cognition  with  limited  benefits  to  tasks  of  everyday 
functioning  [18,  19].  Although  studies  of  strategy-
specific  cognitive  training  are  able  to  identify  factors 
that  may  mediate  the  impact  of  the  intervention  for 
changes  in  cognition,  there  have  been  limited  far-
reaching transfer effects [20, 21]. Comparatively, multi-
modal interventions, combining across various training 
modalities  [22,  23]  show  the  most  promising  effects. 
However, in these studies, it has been difficult to isolate 
the  mechanisms  of  action.  Thus,  the  scientific  prem-
ise  of  the  current  study  is  based  on  an  urgent  need  to 
explore  alternative  training  programs  that  provide 
theoretical  promise  for  reducing  age-related  cognitive 
decline,  particulary  in  attentional  overprocessing  of 
task-irrelevant information. This could then have broad 
transfer  effects  on  emergent  cognitive  operations  of 
cognitive control, emotion regulation, and for domains 
of  cognitive  functioning  that  directly  impact  everyday 
functioning, like driving.

Mindfulness  training,  traditionally  offered  as  an  eight-
week program called the mindfulness-based stress reduc-
tion (MBSR) [24], has gained increased popularity for its 
potential to improve cognition [25, 26], ameliorate symp-
toms  of  depression  and  anxiety  [27],  alter  perceived  and 
objective markers of stress [28], enhance emotion regula-
tion [29], and alter the neural circuitry supporting cogni-
tive  and  emotional  functioning  [30,  31].  Mindfulness,  as 
defined  in  the  contemporary  sciences,  is  the  practice  of 
purposefully  directing  attention,  in  a  non-judgmental 
way, to observe the unfolding of each moment as it takes 
place [32]. As such, the various components of attention, 
including  the  fluctuations  in  attention—quantified  via 
the  propensity  to  engage  in  mind-wandering—are  being 
investigated for their malleability as a function of engage-
ment  in  mindfulness  practices.  In  our  recent  scoping 
review of the contemplative sciences literature examining 
the impact of mindfulness meditation for components of 
attention, we found the most robust evidence for mindful-
ness training to impact executive control of attention [33]. 
Moreover,  results  of  a  pilot,  randomized  controlled  trial 
in our lab also provided evidence for mindfulness training 
to  reduce  off-task  thinking,  or  mind-wandering  quanti-
fied using both self-reported thought probes and response 
time variability in healthy older adults [34]. These reduc-
tions  in  mind-wandering  propensity,  replicated  by  other 
clinical  trials  (see  Feruglio  [35]  for  a  systematic  review), 
provide preliminary support that training in mindfulness 
meditation may strengthen the goal maintenance system, 
enhancing  one’s  ability  to  prioritize  task-relevant  repre-
sentations,  and  to  filter  out  irrelevant,  internal  thoughts 
or external stimuili in the environment.

Taken  together,  there  is  a  growing  recognition  for  the 
potential for mindfulness practices to improve attentional 
control—the  biasing  of  task-relevant  representations 
at  the  temporal,  spatial,  and  response  stages.  However, 
this literature is still in its infancy, particularly in the evi-
dence  supporting  mindfulness  meditation  as  a  tool  for 
reducing  age-related  cognitive  decline.  The  majority  of 
studies,  including  our  own  pilot  clinical  trial,  have  had 
limited follow-up data, have relied on self-reported data 
for quantifying adherence to study materials, and did not 
include broad measures of transfer effects. This Phase I/
II  efficacy  trial—HealthyAgers—aims  to  build  on  the 
existing  literature  by  examining  the  immediate  and  lon-
gitudinal impact, relative to an active control group, of an 
eight-week  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  (MBSR) 
program  in  improving  attentional  control  and  reducing 
mind-wandering in older adults. In addition, the control 
group  in  the  study—Lifestyle  Education  (LifeEd)  pro-
gram—has  been  carefully  designed  to  match  the  train-
ing group for non-specific factors that may influence the 
outcomes  of  interest.  Participants  in  both  groups  will

engage  in  a  booster  session  every  three  months  across 
the  12-month  period  following  the  intervention.  Impor-
tantly, we have designed an in-house web/mobile applica-
tion—HealthyAgers—to measure engagement with study 
materials  for  both  groups  to  allow  for  careful  assess-
ments  of  dose–response  relationships.  We  hypothesize 
that  mindfulness  training,  compared  to  lifestyle  educa-
tion training, will improve attentional control and reduce 
mind-wandering.  Secondary  measures  of  this  study  will 
also  assess  the  broad  impact  of  mindfulness  meditation 
for  functional  connectivity,  fluid  and  everyday  cogni-
tion, emotion regulation, and systemic inflammation. We 
hypothesize  that  mindfulness  training  will  additionally 
result in an improvement in these secondary measures of 
healthy aging. The results of this study will establish the 
efficacy  of  this  increasingly  popular,  low-cost  interven-
tion  for  older  adults  with  regard  to  cognitive,  affective, 
and neural health.

Methods/design
Study design

The  proposed  study  is  a  single-blind,  randomized  con-
trolled  trial  (RCT)  designed  to  examine  the  differential 
impact  of  mindfulness  training  compared  to  a  lifestyle 
education group (LifeEd) on behavioral and neural meas-
ures  of  attentional  control  and  mind-wandering.  Sec-
ondary  assessments involve measures  of  fluid cognition, 
everyday  cognition,  emotion  regulation,  and  systemic 
markers of inflammation. One hundred fifty older adults 
(65–85  years  old)  are  being  recruited  for  the  study  and 
randomized  to  either  an  eight-week  MBSR  group  or  an 
eight-week  LifeEd  control  group.  Behavioral,  neuroim-
aging, and inflammation data will be conducted at base-
line  prior  to  randomization  and  again  at  the  conclusion 
of the eight-week intervention. Further, participants will 
be  followed  for  an  additional  12  months,  during  which 
time  booster  sessions  will  be  provided  once  every  three 
months,  with  cognitive  and  affective  assessments  per-
formed  at  6-month  and  12-month  follow-ups.  Neuro-
imaging  and  inflammation  data  will  only  be  collected  at 
the 12-month follow-up. Figure 1 illustrates a timeline of 
study participation.

Setting

Assessments  and  the  intervention  will  be  conducted  in 
the  Psychology  Building  at  The  Ohio  State  University. 
The  Department  of  Psychology  houses  individual  neu-
ropsychological testing rooms to allow for the convenient 
administration of neuropsychological and emotional reg-
ulation measures. All structural and functional MRI data 
will be collected at the Center for Cognitive and Behavio-
ral Brain Imaging housed in the Department of Psychol-
ogy  at  Ohio  State.  Prior  to  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 

pandemic,  all  intervention  sessions  were  provided  in 
the  group  therapy  spaces  housed  in  the  Department  of 
Psychology.  These  spaces  were  specifically  designed  for 
offering  mindfulness  and  LifeEd  sessions.  Intervention 
sessions  have  been  shifted  to  a  virtual  format  following 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  but  assessment  sessions  con-
tinue to be collected in-person.

Participant eligibility

Participants  will  only  be  included  in  the  study  if  they 
satisfy the following criteria: aged between 65–85 years, 
corrected (far) visual acuity of 20/40 or better, have ade-
quate  hearing  for  assessment  purposes,  and  have  self-
reported  proficiency  in  spoken  English  and  in  reading 
comprehension.  Additionally,  we  will  only  include  par-
ticipants if they are able to attend the majority of eight-
week sessions and attend all assessment sessions, have a 
self-reported  interest  in  engaging  in  mind–body  inter-
ventions,  can  commit  to  a  30-min  homework  practice 
five times per week, and have the ability to engage in light 
stretching and toning exercises.

Additionally,  participants  will  only  be  included  in  the 
study if they are classified as cognitively normal or hav-
ing  mild  cognitive  impairment  (MCI)  based  on  a  bat-
tery of neuropsychological measures employed to screen 
individuals  with  dementia  [36,  37].  The  screening  bat-
tery includes the following measures and seven depend-
ent  variables  used  for  exclusionary  determinations:  1) 
total recall and 2) delayed recall from the Hopkins Verbal 
Learning Test—Revised ([38], 3) total score on the Block 
Design and 4) total score on Digit Span subtests from the 
Wechsler  Adult  Intelligence  Scale-IV  [39],  5)  total  score 
on  the  FAS  Verbal  Fluency  Task  [40],  6)  total  score  on 
the Boston Naming Test [41], and 7) perseverative errors 
on the computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sort 
Test [42]. The WAIS-IV subtests are completed between 
the  immediate  and  delayed  recall  tasks  of  the  Hopkins 
Verbal Learning Test. Descriptions of each of these meas-
ures and details on their scoring and norms are provided 
in Supplementary Materials. Participants will be excluded 
from the study due to having impairment levels consist-
ent  with  dementia  based  on  one  of  the  following  crite-
ria:  1)  if  at  least  one  normed  score  in  both  the  memory 
and  non-memory  domains  is < -2  S.D.s  below  the  mean 
(i.e.,  T < 30),  2)  if  the  average  of  their  normed  scores  on 
all  seven  neuropsychological  measures  is < -2  S.D.s  (i.e., 
average  T < 30),  or  3)  if  the  participant  reports  less  than 
intact  function  on  all  items  of  the  Lawton  Instrumental 
Activities of Daily Living [43] (< 8/8 points).

Participants will be classified as having MCI if they do 
not meet the criteria for dementia but have at least one 
normed score < -1.5 S.D.s below the mean (i.e., T < 35) or 
if the average of their seven normed score is < -1.5 S.D.s

(i.e., average T < 35). Participants will be classified as cog-
nitively  normal  if  all  of  their  normed  scores  are  within 
1.5 S.D.s of the mean and they receive a full score on the 
Lawton  Instrumental  Activities  of  Daily  Living.  These 
categorizations are consistent with previous clinical defi-
nitions of MCI and dementia [44, 45] and with previous 
research  in  MCI  and  dementia  classification  [36,  37]. 
However,  an  important  limitation  with  this  approach  is 
that,  although  our  categorization  of  MCI  may  be  con-
sistent with clinical conceptualization, it has been dem-
onstrated  that  a  significant  minority  of  healthy  older 
adults will have at least one “impaired” score < -1.5 S.D.s 
from the mean when given a neuropsychological battery 
[46, 47]. This has been of particular concern when trying 
to characterize MCI [48,  49]. In the event that the nor-
med scores for a participant are not able to be computed 
due to errors in a given test’s administration, the partici-
pant will be assessed for cognitive impairment using an 

electronic version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
[50]  with  its  provided  cut-off  scores  (26/30  or  higher 
denoting normal cognition).

Other  reasons  for  exclusion  of  potential  participants 
include  if  they  have  been  previously  diagnosed  with  a 
neurological  disorder,  an  inflammatory  disorder,  or  a 
terminal  illness.  Participants  with  a  history  of  psychotic 
disorders,  substance  abuse,  or  a  prior  learning  disability 
will  also  be  excluded.  Additionally,  participants  diag-
nosed with a psychiatric disorder in the last two years by 
a  mental  health  professional  and  those  scoring  greater 
than 19 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion  Scale  [51]  will  be  excluded  from  the  study.  Partici-
pants  currently  taking  medications  belonging  to  any  of 
the  following  drug  classes  will  be  excluded:  sedatives, 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, 
barbiturates,  sedative-hypnotics,  anti-inflammatories, 
chemotherapies,  and  any  drugs  altering  brain  function

or  enhancing  cognitive  performance.  Anyone  who  has 
engaged  in  formal  mindfulness  training  within  the  past 
year  will  also  be  ineligible  or  with  current  regular  prac-
tice  of  meditation—defined  as  practicing  any  kind  of 
meditation practice for greater than 10 min per day—will 
be  ineligible.  As  the  study  involves  participants  engag-
ing  with  practices  on  a  web/mobile  platform,  partici-
pants will also be excluded from the study if they do not 
have  access  to  the  internet.  Participants  without  access 
to  computers  but  with  internet  access  will  be  provided 
mini-iPads.

Sample size

In  our  pilot  study  [34],  we  found  a  partial  eta  square  of 
0.088 for the repeated-measures ANOVA examining the 
effect  of  mindfulness  on  Go/No-Go  performance  as  a 
function of working memory index. Based on an alpha of 
0.05, a total sample size of 103 would be needed to yield 
an estimated power greater than 0.80. Given the attrition 
observed in our pilot study (~ 20%), the 12-month dura-
tion  of  the  proposed  intervention,  and  multiple  assess-
ment sessions, we will recruit at least 130 participants to 
account for a potential 25% drop-out rate. Power analysis 
for  the  imaging  data  was  based  on  the  parameter  esti-
mates in the Kilpatrick study [52] examining the impact 
of  mindfulness  training  on  functional  connectivity  of 
resting-state  networks.  The  resulting  effect  sizes  were 
d = 1.29 and d = 0.99 for auditory/salience regions To be 
conservative, we used the effect size of d = 0.99. To detect 
an effect of this size with 90% power, we would need 23 
subjects per group for a total of 46 people. A study by Kil-
patrick  and  colleagues  [52]  compared  their  mindfulness 
intervention  against  a  wait-list  control  group.  It  is  likely 
that the parameter estimates of their study include vari-
ance  that  may  be  accounted  for  by  non-specific  factors. 
In the present study, our mindfulness training group will 

be compared with an active control group that will con-
trol for many of the non-specific factors. Thus, assuming 
an effect size of d = 0.76, we plan on collecting MRI data 
on  75  participants  to  yield  an  estimated  power  greater 
than 0.90.

Study procedures

Participants  are  being  drawn  from  the  greater  central 
Ohio  area.  Recruitment  for  the  study  started  in  August 
2018  and  is  currently  ongoing.  We  are  implementing 
a  multi-medium  recruitment  strategy,  advertising  for 
the  study  using  both  printed  and  online  communica-
tions,  in-person  recruitment,  community  outreach,  and 
other opportunities aimed at our targeted demographic. 
Table 1 provides a list of our primary recruitment sources 
for  the  study.  Participants  interested  in  the  study  will 
either complete a phone screen or an online survey that 
is  designed  to  collect  basic  demographic  information, 
current  medications,  and  history  of  physical  as  well  as 
psychological health. Participants who meet basic inclu-
sionary criteria are then invited to the Clinical Neurosci-
ence Laboratory at The Ohio State University to complete 
an in-person screening session. Those meeting the study 
criteria  as  described  above  are  invited  for  additional 
behavioral  and  imaging-based  assessments.  Table  2  lists 
the measures administered at pre-training, post-training, 
and  at  6-month  and  12-month  follow-up  sessions.  Par-
ticipants are also given a Qualtrics link with the following 
survey  measures  at  baseline,  pre-training,  post-training, 
and  the  two  follow-up  sessions:  the  Mindful  Attention 
Awareness Scale [53], the Difficulties in Emotion Regula-
tion Scale [54], the Perceived Stress Scale [55], the World 
Health  Organization  Quality  of  Life  –  BREF  [56],  the 
Beck Anxiety Inventory [57], the Five Facet Mindfulness 
Questionnaire  [58],  the  Coronavirus  Anxiety  Scale  [59],

Primary outcome

The  primary  outcomes  for  this  study  are  changes  in 
measures  of  attentional  control  and  mind-wandering 
during  tasks  of  sustained  attention.  To  quantify  both 
attentional  control  and  mind-wandering  the  following 
measures are being administered:

task  performance  and  will  be  calculated  using  the  for-
mula  for  logistic  distributions:   dL = ln{[H(1-FA)]/[(1-H)
FA]}, where H refers to hit rates for go trials and FA refers 
to  false  alarms  on  no-go  trials.  The  primary  outcome 
variable  for  mind-wandering  will  be  the  proportion  of 
off-task probes endorsed by the participant. In addition, 
we will compute response-time variability—the trial-by-
trial  fluctuation  in  reaction  time—as  an  indirect  marker 
of mind-wandering.

Go/No‑Go

Conner’s continuous performance test

In  this  task,  participants  are  presented  with  one  of  two 
visual stimuli (“X” and “M”, or “Z” and “/”) for 750 ms fol-
lowed by an inter-trial-interval of 750 ms. They are asked 
to  press  the  corresponding  key  on  frequent  Go  trials 
and  to  withhold  responses  on  the  less  frequent  (occur-
ring  10%  of  the  time)  No-Go  trials  signaled  by  an  audi-
tory  tone.  Participants  complete  six  blocks  of  this  task 
with each block containing 54 Go trials, six No-Go trials, 
and  three  mind-wandering  probes.  The  quasi-randomly 
presented  mind-wandering  probes  ask  participants  to 
categorize  their  immediately  preceding  thought  as:  1) 
“On-task”,  2)  “thinking  about  performance  on  the  task”, 
or  3)  “thinking  about  personal  worries,  day-dreaming, 
fantasizing or just lost in thought.” The primary outcome 
variable  for  attentional  control  will  be  the  signal  detec-
tion sensitivity index  (dL). The  dL provides a measure of 

In  this  task,  participants  are  presented  with  a  series 
of  letters  displayed  one  at  a  time  on  the  screen  and  are 
instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible for 
all  letters  (target),  except  for  the  letter  ‘X’  (non-target). 
Participants  are  instructed  to  withhold  their  responses 
during ‘X’ letter (non-target) trials. Participants complete 
six blocks of 60 trials each in which letters are presented 
for 250 ms and inter-stimulus intervals are 1, 2, or 4 s in 
duration.  Participants’  ability  to  differentiate  between 
non-targets  and  targets  is  reflected  by  detectability  (d’) 
scores and will be the primary outcome assessing atten-
tional  control.  Participant  d’  scores  are  reverse-scored 
such that higher T-scores reflect worse performance (i.e., 
poorer discrimination between targets and non-targets). 
Response  time  variability  (RT  variability),  an  index  of 
mind-wandering  for  this  task,  is  a  measure  of  response

speed consistency and will be calculated as the standard 
deviation  of  each  participant’s  response  time  (ms)  on 
correct  trials.  Higher  RT  variability  scores  is  indicative 
of  varying  attentional  states  and  will  be  employed  as  an 
indirect index of mind-wandering in this task.

The efficacy of the intervention for sustained attention 
will  be  determined  by  improved  performance  on  both 
measures.  Similarly,  we  will  conclude  that  mindfulness 
training  causally  impacts  mind-wandering  if  there  are 
reductions in both self-reported mind-wandering (i.e., on 
embedded probes) and in response time variability.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes in this study include neuroimaging 
assessments,  measures  of  fluid  cognition,  everyday  cog-
nition, and emotion regulation strategy use, and systemic 
markers of inflammation.

Neuroimaging assessment

Functional  MRI  (fMRI)  and  structural  MRI  data  will  be 
collected at pre-training, post-training, and at 12-month 
follow-up. The primary dependent variable from the neu-
roimaging data is the network strength in a connectome-
based  predictive  model  of  sustained  attention  (saCPM; 
[62]).  Figure  2  presents  the  functional  neuroanatomy  of 

the  high  attention  model  (includes  functional  connec-
tions  that  positively  predict  attentional  control)  and  the 
low  attention  model  (includes  functional  connections 
that  negatively  predict  attentional  control).  The  saCPM 
model, combining the functional connections of the high 
and low attention models, will be employed in the current 
study.  Network  strength  in  this  whole-brain,  functional 
connectivity-based model of attentional control predicts 
performance  on  variegated  tasks  of  attentional  con-
trol  [63–65],  generalizes  to  predict  performance  across 
young adults [66], older adults [65], and individuals with 
attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  [62],  and,  criti-
cally,  shows  responsiveness  to  change  following  methyl-
phenidate  treatment  for  attention-deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder [63]. Participants will perform the gradual-onset 
continuous  performance  task  (gradCPT;  [62,  67,  68]) 
while in the scanner. In this task, participants view circu-
lar images of city and mountain scenes. Participants are 
asked to respond to the frequently occurring city scenes 
(~ 90% of images) and to withhold responses to mountain 
scenes. Participants will complete two separate runs with 
each run lasting 13 min and 44 s. Neuroimaging data will 
be  checked  for  quality  control  and  preprocessed  using 
our  lab’s  established  pipelines  [69].  The  preprocessed 
4D data for each participant will be parcellated into 268

contiguous and functionally defined regions using a par-
cellation scheme covering the cortex, subcortex, and cer-
ebellum [70]. The connections between each pair of these 
nodes,  defined  as  edges,  will  be  computed  by  correlat-
ing  the  time-course  of  activity  between  the  nodes.  This 
will  result  in  a  268X268  functional  connectivity  matrix 
with  cells  of  the  matrix  representing  the  magnitude  of 
these  edges  or  correlations.  Using  the  network  mask  of 
the  saCPM  neuromarker  [63],  which  has  been  validated 
in our prior work with older adults [71], we will compute 
the  network  strength  of  the  marker  for  each  participant 
at pre-training, post-training, and at 12-month follow-up.

NIH cognitive toolbox

The cognition battery of the NIH Toolbox was designed 
as part of the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research 
[72]  to  assess  cognitive  functioning  across  multi-
ple  domains  in  a  standardized  format.  The  battery  is 
designed  for  use  with  participants  between  the  ages 
of  3–85  with  alternate  forms  available  for  longitudi-
nal  assessments.  All  tasks  will  be  completed  using  fifth 
generation  iPads  with  set-up  and  administration  stand-
ardized across all participants. We will employ the fully 
corrected  fluid  cognition  T-scores  that  norm  for  age, 
gender,  education,  and  race/ethnicity  for  the  follow-
ing  five  tasks:  Pattern  Comparison  Processing  Speed, 
List  Sort  Working  Memory,  Picture  Sequence  Memory, 
Dimensional  Change  Card  Sort,  and  Flanker  Inhibitory 
Control and Attention. Please see Supplementary Mate-
rials for a detailed description of each of these tasks.

Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) driving scenes

Driving  is  an  important  functional  domain  that  plays  a 
critical role in the independence of older adults. To assess 
the impact of the intervention on functional ability, par-
ticipants are being administered the Driving Scenes sub-
test of the NAB as a proxy measure of everyday functional 
ability. This measure has been shown to serve as a valid 
proxy for real-world driving abilities [73], it can identify 
at-risk drivers [74], and it is associated with global cogni-
tive impairment in older adults with and without cogni-
tive impairment [75]. Participants are presented with one 
driving  scene  for  30  s.  This  is  followed  by  the  presenta-
tion of a new scene for 60 and up to 120 s. Participants 
are asked to identify elements of the new scene that may 
be new, diferrent, or missing compared to the first scene. 
The  main  dependent  variable  from  this  task  is  the  total 
number  of  correctly  identified  elements  as  adjusted  for 
age, sex, and education [76].

Emotion regulation task

Participants complete an adapted version of the Emotion 
Regulation Choice Task originally developed by Sheppes 

and colleagues [77]. Participants are shown a series of 24 
negatively valenced images and are instructed to regulate 
their  emotions  to  each  image  using  one  of  two  emotion 
regulation  strategies,  namely  acceptance  or  suppression. 
Twelve  of  the  trials  consist  of  low-intensity  images  and 
the  remaining  12  trials  consist  of  high-intensity  images. 
All  images  were  taken  from  the  International  Affective 
Picture System [78]. Prior to completing the task, partici-
pants  undergo  a  brief  training  in  which  they  read  about 
each emotion regulation strategy and are asked to verbal-
ize  to  the  experimenter  how  they  are  using  these  strat-
egies  during  the  six  practice  trials.  The  order  for  which 
emotion regulation strategy is learned first will be coun-
terbalanced  across  participants.  Broadly,  acceptance  is 
defined  as  allowing  one’s  feelings  to  come  and  go  with-
out  trying  to  control  or  avoid  them,  and  suppression  is 
defined  as  pushing  one’s  feelings  down  or  out  of  one’s 
mind.  Following  the  practice  trials,  participants  pro-
ceed to the 24 task trials. Overall acceptance use will be 
calculated  as  the  percentage  of  total  trials  (24  trials)  in 
which the participant chooses to use acceptance to regu-
late their emotions. Acceptance use will be quantified as 
the percentage of low- and high-intensity images (12 tri-
als  each),  respectively,  in  which  the  participant  chooses 
to  use  acceptance.  Scores  can  range  between  0  and  100 
percent, and higher scores reflect a greater preference for 
acceptance.

Systemic markers of inflammation

Blood  samples  will  be  collected  between  8:00  am-10:00 
am  by  a  trained  phlebotomist  at  three  timepoints:  pre-
training,  post-training,  and  at  the  12-month  follow-up 
session.  Following  standardized  protocols,  and  imple-
menting  same  control  for  each  participant  at  all  time 
points,  the  frozen  samples  for  each  participant  will  be 
assayed  for  the  inflammatory  markers  at  the  same  time. 
Various  peripheral  inflammatory  markers  exist  which 
may be investigated for their association with cognition; 
however,  there  is  strong  support  for  C-reactive  protein, 
interleukin-6,  and  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  to  be 
consistently associated with cognitive outcomes in older 
adults [79, 80]. Additionally, these inflammatory markers 
appear  to  be  reduced  following  mindfulness  meditation 
interventions in a dose–response relationship [81–83]—
an  effect  with  several  biologically  plausible  mechanisms 
[84–86].  This  relationship  appears  particularly  robust 
in  older  adults  [87].  Although  some  previous  studies 
have  examined  composite  scores  from  multiple  inflam-
matory  markers,  these  composites  are  not  standardized 
across  studies  and  biomarkers  are  implicated  in  unique 
physiological  processes  [88–90].  Therefore,  we  will 

Prakash et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2022) 22:666

examine peripheral inflammation via these three markers 
independently.

Randomization

Eligible  and  consenting  participants  will  be  randomized 
after  completing  baseline  assessments  to  one  of  two 
groups:  MBSR  or  LifeEd.  A  random  permuted-block 
design  (blocks  of  size  2  and  4)  will  be  used,  and  the 
randomization  with  an  allocation  ration  of  1:1  will  be 
stratified  by  sex  assigned  at  birth  (male,  female),  cogni-
tive  status  (cognitively  normal,  MCI),  and  MRI  eligibil-
ity  (eligible,  not  eligible)  to  ensure  balance  across  these 
important factors. The biostatistician on the team, R.A., 
prepared and maintains the randomization sequence for 
the  eight  strata. The  project  coordinator  has  been  given 
concealed  envelopes  and  only  after  a  participant  com-
pletes all pre-assessment sessions and is deemed eligible 
for the study does the project coordinator open the enve-
lope from  the respective stratum and assign  the partici-
pant to either the MBSR or the LifeEd group. The project 
coordinator,  the  study  facilitators  and  supervisors,  and 
the study biostatistician will be the only members of the 
team  who  will  be  unblinded  to  group  assignment.  All 
personnel conducting assessments, behavioral or neuro-
imaging, will remain blind to group assignment.

Study interventions
Mindfulness‑Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program

The  MBSR  program  being  offered  in  this  study  is  mod-
eled  after  the  eight-week  program  developed  and  popu-
larized by Jon Kabat-Zinn to reduce pain and stress [24]. 
The MBSR program is offered in a group setting wherein 
participants  meet  with  trained  facilitators  once  a  week 
for  two  and  a  half  hours  each  (except  for  the  first  class 
which  is  three  hours)  along  with  a  four-hour  retreat 
offered  on  a  weekend  (between  weeks  six  and  seven)—
thus resulting in 24.5 h of face-to-face training. In these 
classes,  facilitators  cover  a  combination  of  experien-
tial  practices,  didactics  and  teachings  on  the  topics  of 
mindfulness,  and  mindful  movement  exercises.  These 
practices  and  teachings  all  center  on  cultivating  present 
moment awareness in a framework that promotes accept-
ance  and  non-judgment.  Moreover,  the  participants  are 
provided  with  several  opportunities  to  engage  in  small 
and  large  group-based  discussions  that  offer  a  platform 
for  social  support,  validation,  and  shared  experiences. 
Supplementary  Table  1  provides  the  agenda  for  each  of 
the  eight  sessions  of  the  MBSR  program  as  well  as  the 
practices  taught  during  the  retreat.  In  addition  to  these 
classes,  all  participants  are  invited  to  engage  in  30  min 
of  formal  homework  practices,  delivered  through  our 
web/mobile-based, in-house application that was named 
after  the  study—HealthyAgers.  Working  with  a  team  of 

inter-disciplinary  experts,  including  certified  mindful-
ness  experts,  psychologists,  wellness  coaches,  and  com-
puter programmers, we have carefully designed this iOS/
Android  mobile/web  application  to  deliver  and  track 
guided  meditation  practices.  This  application  will  allow 
us to collect objective practice data on all our participants 
with  the  application  providing  information  on  minutes 
practiced,  the  frequency  of  engagement  in  mindfulness 
practices  per  week,  and  additional  meta-data,  includ-
ing preferred practices, time of day preference, etc. After 
the  eight  weeks  of  the  intervention,  participants  will  be 
invited  to  continue  engagement  with  mindfulness  prac-
tices  on  their  own,  five  times  per  week,  for  12  months 
with  two-hour,  group-based  booster  sessions  provided 
by the study facilitators every three months. Prior to the 
pandemic, all intervention sessions were provided in our 
group  psychotherapy  rooms  housed  in  the  Department 
of Psychology. Sessions shifted to the Zoom platform in 
March 2020 and continue to be offered virtually.

Lifestyle Education (LifeEd) program

The  LifeEd  program  is  an  active  control  group  against 
which we will compare the effects of the MBSR program. 
Participants  are  provided  with  psychoeducation  on  top-
ics related to healthy living and wellness for older adults. 
The series includes didactics covering the latest evidence-
based  science  on:  sedentary  behavior,  physical  activity, 
cognitively  stimulating  activities,  social  support,  sleep, 
stress  management,  nutrition,  and  hydration.  This  pro-
gram  is  designed  to  control  the  many  active  ingredients 
of a group-based psychotherapeutic program, like MBSR. 
As  such,  it  is  matched  for  setting  (group),  number  and 
training  of  facilitators,  amount  of  time  receiving  in-per-
son instruction, and amount of assigned homework time. 
In addition, to ensure that it is matched with respect  to 
engagement  in  experiential  exercises,  participants  are 
introduced  to  light  stretching  and  toning  exercises  dur-
ing the two-and-a-half-hour class sessions. These stretch-
ing and toning exercises were designed by a certified yoga 
instructor  with  expertise  in  working  with  older  adults. 
Supplementary Table 1 also provides detailed agendas for 
all  eight  sessions  of  the  LifeEd  program.  Moreover,  par-
ticipants  in  the  LifeEd  program  also  have  access  to  the 
web/mobile  application—HealthyAgers—with  partici-
pants  in  this  group  engaging  in  the  following  combina-
tion  of  homework  practices:  light  stretching  and  toning 
exercises  three  times/week,  reading  two  popular  press 
articles  and  answering  questions  related  to  them  once 
a  week,  and  watching  one  to  two  videos  and  answering 
related  questions  once  a  week.  All  homework  materi-
als  are  standardized  to  take ~ 30  min  with  all  readings 
and  videos  delivered  through  the  in-house  applica-
tion.  Finally,  like  the  MBSR  program,  participants  in 

 Prakash et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2022) 22:666

the  LifeEd  group  are  also  being  provided  booster  ses-
sions  once  every  three  months  with  the  encouragement 
to  continue  completing  homework  practices  five  times 
per week. Prior to the pandemic this group also met in-
person with trained facilitators and transitioned to Zoom 
sessions starting in March 2020 because of the COVID-
19 pandemic.

making adaptations consistent with published guidelines 
for  establishing  fidelity  for  mindfulness-based  interven-
tions,  [92]  we  will  assess  the  fidelity  for  both  protocols 
on the five identified components: design, training, deliv-
ery,  receipt,  and  enactment.  Table  3  provides  details  on 
the fidelity assessments being conducted for the current 
study.

Facilitation of MBSR and LifeEd groups and treatment fidelity

Assessing and maximizing adherence

Advanced graduate students in clinical psychology facili-
tate  both  the  MBSR  and  LifeEd  groups.  The  study  PI, 
RSP,  and  her  team’s  mindfulness  instructor,  CR,  pro-
vide  25  h  of  training  for  facilitating  MBSR  groups  and 
another 25 h of training for facilitating LifeEd groups to 
advanced  students  with  prior  training  in  individual  and 
group  psychotherapy.  Detailed  training  manuals,  out-
lining  the  session  agendas  and  transcripts,  are  provided 
to  the  students.  Additionally,  throughout  the  facilita-
tion  of  these  programs,  new  facilitators  receive  weekly 
group  supervision  (1.5  h.)  and  individual  supervision 
(30 min). In accordance with the guidelines proposed by 
the  Treatment  Fidelity  Workshop  of  the  NIH  [91]  and 

Our  lab  has  successfully  conducted  two  RCTs  on  mind-
fulness  training,  and  for  both  those  studies,  we  have 
had  adherence  rates  of ~ 80%  (Whitmoyer  et  al.,  2020; 
Schirda et al., 2020). In the current study, we will imple-
ment  a  number  of  strategies  that  have  been  successful 
in  the  past  to  promote  adherence  to  the  intervention  as 
well  as  the  assessment  sessions.  First,  as  both  groups  in 
the study will engage in training that promotes and dis-
cusses  healthy  aging,  advertising  the  study  as  a  trial  on 
mind–body  interventions  for  healthy  aging  will  help 
recruit  individuals  with  a  genuine  interest  in  making 
these changes. Second, detailing the study requirements

daily  practice  for  eight  weeks,  appears  to  have  a  posi-
tive  influence  on  adherence  to  homework  practices  and 
retention  rates.  All  our  advertisement  materials  detail 
this  time  commitment  on  behalf  of  the  participants. 
Third, once participants are enrolled in the study, weekly 
attendance  at  the  online  sessions  is  being  monitored  by 
course facilitators and communicated to the study coor-
dinator.  For  every  missed  session,  the  study  coordinator 
connects with the participant, and either schedules them 
for an individual appointment with the course facilitator 
or  sends  them  a  summary  from  the  missed  session.  For 
participants who wish to not continue with the interven-
tion, every attempt will be made to complete the assess-
ment sessions.

Data management and analysis

All study data (with the exception of blood samples) are 
being stored in the PI’s laboratory located in the Psychol-
ogy Building at Ohio State. The laboratory is only acces-
sible to approved personnel. Hard data files (e.g., consent 
forms, neuropsychological assessment data) are stored in 
locked cabinets inside the laboratory, whereas electronic 
data  files  (e.g.,  behavioral  data,  self-report  question-
naires, neuroimaging data) are stored on a password-pro-
tected  laboratory  server.  De-identified  participant  blood 
samples are stored at the Clinical Research Center at The 
Ohio State University.

Cognitive  screening  data  will  be  coded  by  two  inde-
pendent  research  assistants  in  the  lab  with  coder  disa-
greements resolved by an experienced research assistant. 
Participants’  performance  scores  from  the  Conner’s 
Continuous Performance Test and the National Institute 
of  Health  Toolbox  Cognition  battery  are  automatically 
generated  from  each  program  and  will  then  organized 
on  the  laboratory  server  via  manual  procedures  and/or 
custom lab scripts. Participant’s behavioral data from the 
Go/No-Go,  Emotion  Regulation  Choice,  Gradual-Onset 
Continuous Performance Task, and the N-back task will 
be  organized  and  coded  by  two  independent  labora-
tory  members  using  custom  scripts.  Neuroimaging  data 
quality will be assessed using a validated quality control 
pipeline  [69]  prior  to  conducting  pre-processing.  Pre-
processing  of  the  neuroimaging  data  will  be  conducted 
by either a postdoctoral researcher or an advanced grad-
uate student in the lab with extensive training in neuro-
imaging analyses. All remaining processing and coding of 
neuroimaging  data  will  be  completed  by  two  independ-
ent graduate students/postdoctoral researchers. Markers 
of inflammation from participant’s blood samples will be 
processed  by  the  Clinical  Research  Center  at  The  Ohio 
State University.

After  preprocessing  of  behavioral  and  neuroimaging 
data,  all  data  will  first  be  tested  for  normality,  outliers, 

and errors. We will then compute summary statistics and 
compare groups’ baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics;  although  randomization  should  balance  the 
groups with respect to these characteristics, with a finite 
sample size, there may be some residual imbalance. Par-
ticular  attention  will  be  paid  to  characteristics  that  may 
be associated with outcomes (e.g., education, depression 
scores) as chance imbalance in these characteristics may 
confound  the  intervention  effects.  All  statistical  analy-
ses conducted as part of the trial will be intent-to-treat. 
The primary outcome variables for this study are indices 
of  attentional  control  and  mind-wandering.  To  examine 
the  immediate  effects  of  mindfulness  training,  we  will 
use a linear mixed model to account for the within-sub-
ject  correlation  arising  from  measuring  each  subject  at 
two  timepoints.  Group  (MBSR,  LifeEd),  Time  (pre  and 
post-training), and the Group X Time interaction will be 
defined  as  fixed  effects,  with  covariates,  when  applica-
ble  (e.g.,  those  identified  as  randomly  differing  between 
groups) included as fixed effects. Each participant’s inter-
cept  will  be  included  as  a  random  effect.  To  determine 
the  maintenance  effects  of  mindfulness  meditation,  we 
will  construct  a  separate  mixed  linear  model  examining 
the  long-term  efficacy  of  mindfulness  meditation  with 
Time  (pre-training,  6-month  follow-up,  and  12-month 
follow-up),  Group  (MBSR,  LifeEd),  and  the  Group  X 
Time interaction effects. Secondary factors of functional 
connectivity, fluid and everyday cognition, emotion dys-
regulation  and  inflammation  will  also  be  examined  by 
constructing linear mixed models.

Adverse event reporting

Adverse events are being graded using the common grad-
ing  scale  proposed  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health: 
(a) No adverse event (event is within normal limits or not 
clinically  significant),  (b)  Mild  adverse  event  that  does

was  resolved  with  treatment,  (d)  Severe  adverse  event 
that  resulted  in  an  inability  to  carry  on  normal  activi-
ties and required professional medical attention, (e) Life 
threatening  or  disabling  adverse  event,  and  (f )  Fatal 
adverse event. All study personnel are trained to monitor 
for  adverse  events,  and,  upon  notification  of  an  adverse 
event,  the  study  PI  (RSP)  determines  the  relationship  of 
the adverse event(s) to the intervention as unrelated, pos-
sibly related, probably related, or definitely related using 
the standard criteria for clinical trials. For every adverse 
event,  a  written  report  of  the  adverse  event  is  submit-
ted to the local IRB within 10 days of the occurrence of 
the  event.  The  IRB  along  with  the  PI  then  determines 
the relationship of these events to the study protocol and 
determines  whether  the  adverse  event  was  related  the 
design of the study. If the adverse event is not related to

the design of the study or is a mild adverse event related 
to the design of the study, these adverse events are docu-
mented along with any changes in the protocol that will 
be implemented to prevent future occurrences. Addition-
ally,  the  event  is  reported  to  the  NIH  and  the  Data  and 
Safety Monitor appointed for this study at the bi-annual 
meeting. If the adverse event is reported to be related to 
the  study  and  is  classified  as  a  moderate  adverse  event 
and  above,  in  addition  to  submitting  a  report  to  the 
IRB, a full report will be prepared and submitted within 
10 days of the adverse event to the Data and Safety Moni-
tor. This report will include a full, detailed description of 
the event as well as the response of the research team. If 
two  participants  experience  the  same  adverse  event,  we 
will immediately stop recruitment for the study, prepare 
a report for the IRB and the Data and Safety Monitor, and 
incorporate any revisions to the study protocol suggested 
by the monitor. Additionally, annual reports will also be 
submitted to the IRB indicating the progress of the study, 
including  information  on  enrollments,  withdrawals  and 
completions, and the occurrence of adverse events.

Discussion
This  ongoing  Phase  I/II  randomized  controlled  trial 
(HealthyAgers)  is  designed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy 
of  mindfulness-based  stress  reduction,  compared  to 
a  carefully  designed,  active  control  group  (Lifestyle 
Education),  in  improving  attentional  control,  reduc-
ing  mind-wandering,  and  strengthening  the  functional 
connections  subserving  attentional  processing  in  older 
adults. With the provision of quarterly booster sessions 
and  the  availability  of  a  web-based  and  mobile  appli-
cation  designed  to  promote  adherence  to  mindfulness 
practices,  this  study  will  also  be  able  to  determine  the 
longitudinal effect of engagement in mindfulness prac-
tices for maintenance of attentional benefits. Addition-
ally,  with  secondary  assessments  involving  global  and 
everyday  measures  of  cognition,  emotion  regulation, 
and  systemic  markers  of  inflammation,  results  of  this 
study  will  also  add  to  our  understanding  of  whether 
mindfulness training has the potential to improve cog-
nitive and affective health of older adults. This system-
atically  designed  trial  of  mindfulness  meditation  with 
its  inclusion  of  an  active  control  group,  assessment  of 
theoretically-driven  behavioral  and  neural  metrics  of 
attentional  control,  and  longitudinal  follow-up  will 
make  a  significant  and  nuanced  contribution  to  our 
understanding  of  whether  and  how  engagement  in 
mindfulness meditation promotes healthy aging.

Mindfulness meditation is becoming increasingly pop-
ular because of its promise to influence several integrated 
metrics of overall health—attentional control [33], emo-
tion dysregulation [93, 94], perceived and objective mark-
ers of stress [95, 96], loneliness [97, 98], systemic markers 
of peripheral inflammation [82], and relationship quality 
[99]. The adaptation of mindfulness programs to a variety 
of  settings  was  also  catapulted  by  the  increasing  rise  of 
stress  and  mental  health  problems  during  the  COVID-
19  pandemic.  However,  many  systematic  and  scoping 
reviews of the mindfulness literature have highlighted the 
heterogeneity  of  findings  within  contemplative  sciences 
and  have  called  for  a  more  systematic  and  controlled 
study  of  mindfulness  meditation  [33,  100].  Our  scop-
ing review [33], examining the effects of mindfulness on 
attentional  control,  surveyed  mindfulness  training  stud-
ies  through  the  lens  of  five  study  design  issues  essential 
for establishing causality [101, 102]: 1) randomization of 
participants  to  groups;  2)  inclusion  of  an  active  control 
group;  3)  explicit  attention  to  the  reduction  of  demand 
characteristics;  4)  detailed  discussion  of  content  of  the 
intervention  and  control  groups;  and  5)  implementa-
tion  of  study  reporting  guidelines  (such  as  CONSORT). 
Of  the  57  studies  included  in  the  review,  only  four  met 
all  five  essential  criteria—thus  necessitating  further 
and  more  rigorous  study  of  mindfulness  meditation  for 

Prakash et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2022) 22:666

attentional  control.  Additionally,  ten  studies  included 
an active control group and, of those, only five explicitly 
discussed  the  procedural  steps  and  the  efforts  made  to 
reduce demand characteristics in study participants.

The  three  most  common  control  groups  included 
across  the  studies  on  mindfulness  meditation  involved 
relaxation  controls,  education  groups,  and  book  read-
ing  groups.  Importantly,  factors  of  social  support,  such 
as  collaborative  discussion  within  group  formats  and 
engagement  in  cognitively  stimulating  activities,  were 
highlighted as key non-specific factors influencing atten-
tion. Our control group—the Lifestyle Education Control 
Group—has been matched with respect to multiple met-
rics. Format of delivery: both protocols were delivered in-
person  before  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  we  shifted 
to  a  virtual  format  (after  the  pandemic),  offering  classes 
synchronously  via  the  Zoom  platform  with  participants 
recruited in groups of six to eight for peer support. Tim-
ing: each of the eight weekly classes (plus the retreats) is 
matched for timing. Content: both protocols have a mix 
of  didactics,  experiential  practices,  social  support,  and 
community  building.  Peer  support:  qualitative  analysis 
of  focus  group  discussions  on  mindfulness-based  inter-
ventions[103–105]  highlight  the  need  for  participants 
to  connect  and  communicate  with  others  engaging  in 
the  interventions.  Both  groups  have  built-in  dyadic  and 
small-group  discussions  on  topics  such  as  weekly  mate-
rials,  challenges  with  homework  practices,  and  overall 
learning  in  the  program.  Homework  assignment:  both 
programs require engagement in daily homework assign-
ments  through  our  in-house  application  for  30  min/day 
for five days/week.

In our study, in addition to the inclusion of this active 
control  group,  we  have  implemented  several  procedural 
steps  to  ensure  that  perceived  expectations—  partici-
pants’ beliefs regarding the efficacy of the intervention for 
outcome  measures  [33,  101]—are  minimally  influenced 
by study design, experimenter bias, and advertising mate-
rials. Inclusion of an active control group that is matched 
with  respect  to  timing,  duration,  content,  and  engage-
ment allows for the study to be advertised using common 
elements for the two groups rather than an explicit focus 
on  mindfulness  meditation.  All  our  recruitment  materi-
als—print-ads,  radio  ads,  flyers,  presentations—describe 
the  study  as  examining  the  effect  of  two  mind–body 
interventions on healthy aging. Employing the definition 
provided by the National Center for Complementary and 
Integrative  Health,  “mind–body  practices  focus  on  the 
interactions  among  the  brain,  mind,  body,  and  behav-
ior,  with  the  intent  to  use  the  mind  to  affect  physical 
functioning  and  promote  health,”  both  our  recruitment 
materials  and  the  content  for  the  active  control  group 
included  elements  of  mind–body  practices.  The  key 

difference  between  the  two  groups  is  the  active  engage-
ment  with  mindfulness  practices  as  opposed  to  a  focus 
on psychoeducation in the control group. In addition to 
reducing  demand  characteristics  through  blinded  asses-
sors,  unbiased  recruitment  materials,  and  the  use  of  an 
active control group can minimize their effects, it is also 
essential to measure these perceived expectations. In the 
present study, participants in both groups are completing 
measures of perceived expectations at the end of the first 
intervention session and after the respective groups have 
been introduced, with the eventual goal of examining dif-
ferential expectations between the two groups. Finally in 
our attempt to examine the impact of demand character-
istics  on  treatment  gains  carefully,  our  primary  analyses 
will also include an association of perceived expectations 
with any observed gains on outcome variables.

An additional strength of this study is the inclusion of 
an a priori validated neuromarker of sustained attention 
to examine the changes in functional connectivity follow-
ing  training  in  mindfulness  meditation.  Although  fMRI 
is  frequently  employed  to  examine  the  effects  of  behav-
ioral  interventions,  the  precise  mapping  of  neuroimag-
ing  features  relevant  to  target  behavior  is  often  missing. 
In  our  prior  work  [65],  we  have  established  the  validity 
of this neuromarker of sustained attention—saCPM— in 
older adults. In this study, network strength in this estab-
lished  biomarker  will  be  examined  for  training-related 
gains, with network strength in the high attention model 
expected  to  increase  as  a  function  of  training  and  net-
work  strength  in  the  low  attention  model  expected  to 
decrease.  Given  the  centrality  of  attentional  control  to 
the  processes  of  mind-wandering  and  emotion  regula-
tion,  we  hypothesize  that  changes  in  this  neuromarker 
will mediate mindfulness-related training gains on these 
metrics.

In conclusion, the HealthyAgers trial will provide data 
on  the  efficacy  of  mindfulness  meditation  to  improve 
older  adults’  attentional  control  abilities,  reduce  mind-
wandering, and strengthen the neural circuitry support-
ing attention. By virtue of enhancing the ability to sustain 
attention,  mindfulness  meditation  may  also  improve 
general  cognition,  increase  the  use  of  acceptance-based 
emotion  regulation  strategies,  and  reduce  overall  levels 
of  systemic  inflammation.  Given  the  aging  of  the  baby 
boomer generation and the impact of reduced attentional 
control  for  activities  of  daily  living  and  quality  of  life, 
training  in  mindfulness  meditation  may,  in  fact,  be  one 
pathway to promote healthy aging.
