Abstract

Purpose: This study evaluated the characteristics associated with sexual orientation disclosure among HIV-
negative Black sexual minority men (BSMM) in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. Survey data were collected
from 475 HIV-negative BSMM from 2017 to 2019 as part of a larger behavioral intervention study focused on
stigma, prejudice, and HIV-testing uptake.
Methods: Participants reported their levels of sexual orientation disclosure globally, to their community, and
to their family. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and multinomial logistic regression to
determine whether demographic, minority stress, substance use, and mental health were associated with sexual
orientation disclosure globally, to community members, and to family members.
Results: Findings revealed that participants with older age, bisexual identity, and higher levels of internalized
homophobia had higher odds of global, community, and family sexual orientation nondisclosure. Furthermore,
participants with higher levels of resilience had lower odds of partial sexual orientation disclosure compared with
their fully disclosed counterparts.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings reveal variations associated with sexual orientation disclosure across varying con-
texts among HIV-negative BSMM, particularly among family member disclosure.

Introduction

Disclosure of sexual orientation among sexual

minority individuals is a life-long and complex pro-
cess.1 Individuals may choose to disclose (e.g., discuss) or
not disclose (e.g., avoid discussing) their sexual orientation
in different contexts; for example, some sexual minority
individuals may strategically choose to disclose their sexual
orientation to their friends but not disclose their sexual orien-
tation to their families and colleagues. Determining who
to disclose to is shaped by several factors such as feelings
of safety, support, and trust.1–4 In addition, nondisclosure of
sexual orientation may be necessary, particularly in areas
where sexual minority individuals are provided minimal

legal protections and may face loss of employment, hous-
ing insecurity, and denial of medical services as a result of
sexual minority status.5–9 There is a need to further explore
disclosure among sexual minority individuals across vary-
ing contexts, including factors associated with disclosure
among community and family members.

Prior literature has documented both negative and posi-
tive aspects to disclosure. Some of the documented negative
outcomes related to disclosure include experiences of phys-
ical and sexual violence, depression, and increased sexual
risk behaviors.10–12 Beneﬁcial aspects of disclosure have
also been identiﬁed, such as reduced psychological distress
and improved self-image.13,14 Despite evidence of both the
negative and positive aspects of disclosure, not all sexual

BSMM when faced with adversity and promote positive
mental and physical health outcomes.43,44

Black sexual minority men (BSMM) are less likely than
their White counterparts to disclose their sexual orienta-
tion.15,16 Much of the literature on sexual minority disclosure
has focused on sexual minority men as a whole; however,
factors associated with disclosure of sexual orientation
among sexual minority men, including BSMM, may differ
depending on personal factors and experiences. Demogra-
phic variables that are indicative of ﬁnancial independence
(e.g., employment and income) may increase willingness to
disclose sexual orientation.17,18

Experiences of minority stressors (e.g., internalized, antic-
ipated, and enacted stigmas from health care workers) and
distrust of organizations in which they experience stigma-
tizing attitudes and discrimination (e.g., health care sys-
tems) may also impact disclosure of sexual orientation of
BSMM.19–23 Literature indicates BSMM are less likely to
disclose their sexual orientation compared with their White
counterparts due to experiences of intersectional stigma
related to Black/African American racial identities and also
identifying as a sexual minority.15,24 In addition, mental
health-related challenges and substance use may be resultant
of negative health consequences related to nondisclosure of
sexual orientation.25,26

Choosing to disclose sexual orientation may be com-
pounded by fear of losing valued support networks, such as
community and family members, which may serve as buffers
to existing race-based inequities and stressors chronically
experienced by Black/African American individuals.27–30
Another factor—resiliency, or the ability to experience
adversity and to adapt and overcome its negative effects—
may serve as a protective factor among BSMM and encour-
age disclosure.23,31–33 As BSMM are more likely to experi-
life events due to intersecting
ence repetitive stressful
racial and sexual orientation identities,23,34,35 research indi-
cates that BSMM with higher resilience levels engage in
fewer HIV-risk behaviors, increased substance use recov-
ery, higher self-efﬁcacy, and better coping strategies when
compared with those with lower resilience scores.36–38 How-
ever, resilience has yet to be studied in relation to disclo-
sure of sexual orientation beyond global disclosure among
BSMM adults.

Although previous studies have examined disclosure as an
independent variable among predominantly White or racially
diverse participants, research regarding variables associated
with disclosure as a dependent variable have yet to be con-
ducted exclusively among BSMM in varied contexts, includ-
ing among community and family members. This study is
exploratory and sought
to examine what factors among
HIV-negative BSMM were associated with three contexts
of sexual orientation disclosure: global disclosure (‘‘out’’ in
general), community disclosure (‘‘out’’ to community mem-
bers), and family disclosure (‘‘out’’ to family members).

As previous studies have indicated that demographics
(e.g., socioeconomic status), minority stress indicators
(e.g., internalized homophobia), and health-related mark-
ers (e.g., substance use and depression) are associated with
disclosure of sexual orientation, we consider these in this
study.10,16,39–42 In addition, we sought to explore the impact
of resilience on disclosure of sexual orientation across these
three contexts, which can serve as a protective factor for

This exploratory study seeks to identify which charac-
teristics are associated with sexual orientation disclosure in
different contexts. As factors associated with BSMM’s dis-
closure of sexual orientation are understudied,16,40 under-
standing disclosure of sexual orientation across different
contexts, particularly for BSMM, is important, as disclosure
among BSMM may be associated with positive and nega-
tive well-being.

Methods

Participants and procedures

Participants included 493 HIV-negative BSMM living in
Atlanta, Georgia, and surrounding areas. Participants were
recruited using Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender,
Queer, and others (LGBTQ+) dating apps, websites, and par-
ticipant referrals. Data were collected from February 2017 to
October 2019 at baseline of a larger behavioral intervention
study for HIV-negative BSMM and their experiences with
stigma, discrimination, prejudice, and HIV testing. Data
from this study come solely from the baseline assessment.
This research involved human subjects and was conducted
with the approval of the University of Connecticut Institu-
tional Review Board and research was conducted in accor-
dance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or com-
parable ethical standards.

Informed consent was obtained from all individual partic-
ipants included in the study. To enroll, participants self-
identiﬁed as at least 18 years old, Black/African American,
reported having sex with a man in the past year, and HIV-
negative/unknown HIV status at the time of screening. Eight-
een participants were removed from analysis because they
either did not identify as male, identiﬁed as heterosexual,
or reported living with HIV at the time of data collection.
All participants received $45 for their participation.

Survey measures

Demographics. Participants were asked to report their
age, sexual orientation (i.e., same gender loving/gay = 0, bisex-
ual = 1), education level (less than high school = 0, high
school = 1, some college = 2, college degree = 3, graduate
school = 4, graduate degree = 5), and income ($0–$10,000 = 1,
$11,000–$20,000 = 2, $21,000–$30,000 = 3, $31,000–$40,000
= 4, $41,000–$50,000 = 5, $51,000–$60,000 = 6, $61,000 or
higher = 7).

(global disclosure),

Disclosure of sexual orientation. Three separate items
asked participants: ‘‘How ‘out’ are you about your sexual
orientation’’
‘‘Thinking about your
community, how ‘out’ are you about your sexuality’’ (com-
munity disclosure), and ‘‘Thinking about your family, how
(family disclo-
‘out’ are you about your
sure). Response options included three levels (deﬁnitely
‘‘closeted’’ = 0; ‘‘closeted’’ some of the time and ‘‘out’’
some of the time = 1; and deﬁnitely ‘‘out’’ = 2). We refer to
these outness contexts as ‘‘not at all disclosed,’’ ‘‘partially
disclosed,’’ and ‘‘fully disclosed.’’

Minority stress-related measures

Internalized homophobia. Participants answered an adap-
ted version of the Internalized Homophobia Scale, which
included four questions on a 6-point Likert scale regarding
how they feel about being attracted to men.39,45 Items
included ‘‘I try not to be attracted to men in general,’’
‘‘I would accept the chance to be completely heterosexual,’’
‘‘I wish I did not want to have sex with men,’’ and ‘‘I feel
alienated for being attracted to men.’’ Responses ranged
from Strongly disagree (1) to Strongly agree (6), with higher
scores indicating greater internalized homophobia. Respon-
ses were created into a mean score (Cronbach’s a = 0.72).

Enacted homophobia. Participants answered three ques-
tions on a 6-point Likert scale regarding how they were trea-
ted by health care workers in the past year.46,47 Questions
included ‘‘In the past year, I have been mistreated by health-
care providers because of my sexual orientation,’’ ‘‘In the
past year, I have been ignored by healthcare providers
due to my sexual orientation,’’ and ‘‘In the past year, my
healthcare has not been as good as others because of my sex-
ual orientation.’’ Responses ranged from Strongly disagree
(1) to Strongly agree (6), with higher scores indicating
greater enacted homophobia. Responses were averaged to
create a mean score (Cronbach’s a = 0.88).

responded

Anticipated homophobia. Participants

to
three questions on a 6-point Likert scale regarding how
they anticipated they would be treated by health care work-
ers in the next year.48,49 Questions included ‘‘In the year
ahead, I will be mistreated by healthcare providers because
of my sexual orientation,’’ ‘‘In the year ahead, I will be
ignored by healthcare providers because of my sexual orien-
tation,’’ and ‘‘In the year ahead, my healthcare won’t be as
good as others because of my sexual orientation.’’ Responses
ranged from Very unlikely (1) to Very likely (6), with higher
scores indicating greater anticipated homophobia. Responses
were averaged to create a mean score (Cronbach’s a = 0.93).

Resilience. Participants completed the 10-item Connor-
Davidson Resilience Scale.50 The scale included questions
such as ‘‘I try to see the humorous side of problems’’ and
‘‘I can stay focused under pressure,’’ with responses on a
6-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly disagree (1) to
Strongly agree (6), with higher scores indicating higher resil-
ience. Responses were averaged to create a mean score
(Cronbach’s a = 0.76).

Substance use and mental health measures

Alcohol Use Disorders

Identiﬁcation Test-Concise
(AUDIT-C). Participants completed the 3-item AUDIT-C
questionnaire to screen for risky alcohol use, adapted to
focus on the past 3 months of alcohol use.51 Questions
included ‘‘How often do you have a drink containing alco-
hol,’’ ‘‘In the past 3 months, how many drinks containing
alcohol did you have on a typical day when you were drink-
ing,’’ and ‘‘In the past 3 months, how often did you have
six or more drinks on one occasion.’’ Response option
anchors varied for each item but always ranged from 0 to 4
with higher values indicating greater risk of problematic

alcohol use. Composite scores range from 0 to 12, with higher
scores indicating increased risk of problematic alcohol use.

Substance use. Participants were asked their frequency
of use of eight substances in the past 3 months (i.e., mari-
juana, crack, cocaine, poppers, speed, Viagra,
injection
drug use, and other drugs) with responses ranging from
Never (1) to About every day (5). Responses for each sub-
stance were dichotomized to indicate whether the participant
reported any substance use (No = 0; Yes = 1). Dichotomized
responses were then aggregated into a sum score, with possi-
ble ranges from 0 to 8; higher scores indicating a greater
number of substances used in the past 3 months.

Depressive symptoms. Participants answered the 10-item
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-
D 10) to screen for depressive symptomology over the past
week.52 The CES-D 10 contains 10 items, including ‘‘I
could not ‘get going’’’ and ‘‘my sleep was restless,’’ with re-
sponses on a 4-point scale ranging from Rarely or none of the
time (0) to All of the time (3). Two items, ‘‘I was happy’’ and
‘‘I felt hopeful about the future’’ were reverse coded. Items
were summed to achieve a total symptomology score with
possible scores ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores in-
dicating greater depressive symptomology (Cronbach’s
a = 0.83).

Data analyses

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square
analyses were performed to determine differences among par-
ticipants who reported fully disclosing their sexual orientation
globally, to their community, and to their family, compared
with those who had partially disclosed or not disclosed.
Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to
determine variables associated with disclosure of sexual ori-
entation, including demographic, minority stress, substance
use, and mental health variables. To retain signiﬁcant covari-
ates and eliminate nonrelevant variables, we utilized a pur-
poseful selection process in which variables with p < 0.10
among one-way ANOVA and chi-square results were
included in multinomial logistic regressions.53 For outcome
analyses, p < 0.05 was used to denote statistical signiﬁcance.

Participant characteristics

Participant ages ranged from 18 to 71 [mean (M) = 31.49,
standard deviation (SD) = 10.1]. Most participants identiﬁed
as same gender loving or gay (73.7%), had completed at least
some college or higher (73.9%), and made >$20,000 annu-
ally (53.4%) (see Table 1 for demographics).

Disclosure of sexual orientation

Most participants reported that they had fully disclosed
their sexual orientation globally (60.1{%), to their commu-
nity (66.5%), and to their family (59.2%). Almost half of
all participants (46.1%) reported full disclosure of sexual

orientation across all three contexts, and 21.7% reported that
they had not at all disclosed their sexual orientation across all
three contexts (Table 2). Sexual orientation disclosure across
all three contexts were signiﬁcantly correlated (Table 3).
Prevalence of full disclosure globally,
to their commu-
nity, and to their family differed by age, sexual orientation,
and education level. No signiﬁcant differences were found
among AUDIT-C, substance use, enacted homophobia, or
anticipated homophobia between groups (Table 4).

Global sexual orientation disclosure. One-way ANOVA
revealed signiﬁcant age differences among disclosure of sex-
ual orientation globally [F(2, 469) = 3.787, p < 0.05]. Tukey
honest signiﬁcant difference (HSD) tests for multiple com-
parisons revealed that participants who fully disclosed their
sexual orientation globally were marginally younger than
those who partially disclosed ( p < 0.10, 95% conﬁdence in-
terval [CI] = (cid:2)4.38 to 0.25) and those who had not disclosed
( p < 0.10, 95% CI = (cid:2)9.5 to 0.52). Same gender loving/gay
participants reported signiﬁcantly higher rates of full disclo-
sure globally when compared with their bisexual counter-
parts [v2 (2) = 53.402, p < 0.001].

Moderate differences were found between group educa-
tional attainment levels [F(2, 471) = 2.364, p < 0.10], with
Tukey HSD tests revealing no moderate or signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between group education attainment. In addition,
Welch tests revealed signiﬁcant differences in internalized
homophobia [F(2, 62.902) = 32.091, p < 0.001]. As homoge-
neity of variance was violated, post hoc Scheffe tests were
performed, and indicated that those who had fully disclosed
their sexual orientation globally had signiﬁcantly lower
internalized homophobia when compared with those who
had partially disclosed ( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)1.21 to (cid:2)0.60)
and not at all disclosed ( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)2.11 to (cid:2)0.82),
respectively (Table 4).

Community

sexual orientation disclosure. One-way
ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant age differences among partici-
pants who disclosed their sexual orientation to their com-
munity [F(2, 470) = 5.561, p < 0.01]. Tukey HSD tests for
multiple comparisons revealed that participants who fully
disclosed to their communities were signiﬁcantly younger
than those who had not disclosed their sexual orientation
( p < 0.01, 95% CI = (cid:2)8.85 to (cid:2)1.51). Same gender loving/
gay participants were signiﬁcantly more likely to fully disclose
their sexual orientation to their community when compared
with their bisexual counterparts [v2 (2) = 33.013, p < 0.001].

Welch tests revealed signiﬁcant differences among partic-
ipant reports of internalized homophobia [F(2, 106.924) =
30.371, p < 0.001]. Post hoc Scheffe tests revealed that
participants who had fully disclosed to their community
reported signiﬁcantly lower internalized homophobia when

compared with
( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)1.21 to (cid:2)0.53) and those who had not at
all disclosed ( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)1.84 to (cid:2)0.88). In addition,
those who had not disclosed their sexual orientation reported
moderately higher internalized homophobia than those who

participants who fully disclosed their sexual orientation to
their families were moderately older than those who had
partially disclosed ( p < 0.01, 95% CI = (cid:2)0.27 to 5.04). Par-
ticipants who identiﬁed as same gender loving/gay were
signiﬁcantly more likely to fully disclose their sexual orien-
tation to their families when compared with bisexual partic-
ipants [v2 (2) = 55.372, p < 0.001].

Signiﬁcant differences were found among participant
[F(2, 472) = 7.837, p < 0.001],

CI = (cid:2)0.79 to (cid:2)0.18). Participants who had not disclosed
their sexual orientation also reported signiﬁcantly lower
educational attainment than those who had partially dis-
closed to their families ( p < 0.01, CI = 0.15–0.94). In addi-
tion, signiﬁcant differences were found among reported
levels of internalized homophobia [F(2, 173.6) = 16.636,
p < 0.001]—with participants who had fully disclosed to
their families reporting signiﬁcantly lower internalized ho-
mophobia
than those who had partially disclosed
( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)1 to (cid:2)0.28) and those who had not dis-
closed ( p < 0.001, CI = (cid:2)1.24 to (cid:2)0.44).

One-way ANOVA and Welch analyses found moderate
to signiﬁcant differences in income [F(2, 471) = 3.031,
p < 0.05], depressive symptomology [F(2, 472) = 3.024,
p < 0.10], and resilience [F(2, 175.285) = 6.276, xp < 0.001].
Tukey HSD tests found participants who had partially
disclosed reported moderately higher income than those
who had not disclosed their sexual orientation ( p < 0.10,
CI = 0.00–1.25). Participants who had fully disclosed their
sexual orientation reported moderately lower depressive
symptomology than those who were partially disclosed
( p < 0.10, CI = (cid:2)3.5 to 0.058). As homogeneity of variance
was violated for resilience, post hoc Scheffe tests were per-
formed and revealed that those who had fully disclosed
reported signiﬁcantly higher resilience levels than those
who had partially disclosed ( p < 0.001, CI = 0.081–0.376)
(Table 4).

Variables associated with sexual orientation disclosure

Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted
to determine which variables were associated with disclo-
sure of sexual orientation (full disclosure, partial disclosure,
and no disclosure) globally, to community members, and to
family among BSMM.

Global sexual orientation disclosure ﬁndings. Older age
participants [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.06, 95% CI =
1.018–1.104] and those with higher levels of internalized
homophobia (AOR = 1.882, 95% CI = 1.356–2.613) had
{higher odds of global (cid:2)nondisclosure. Conversely, participants
who identiﬁed as same gender loving/gay (AOR = 0.106, 95%
CI = 0.04–0.285) had {lower odds of global (cid:2)nondisclosure.

Discussion

This study is one of the few to investigate disclosure
of sexual orientation among BSMM adults globally,
to
their communities, and to their families as a dependent var-
iable. Although previous studies indicate that disclosure of
sexual orientation may result in both positive and negative
outcomes,10,16 factors associated with disclosure varied
depending on the context of disclosure. Identifying as same
gender loving/gay was the only consistent demographic var-
iable associated with sexual orientation disclosure across
all three contexts. This ﬁnding highlights previous research
results, which indicate that BSMM, who openly identiﬁed as
bisexual are more likely to not disclose their sexual orienta-
tion, experience greater minority stressors (e.g., internalized
homophobia), and increased negative health outcomes (e.g.,
depressive symptomology) compared with their same gender
loving/gay counterparts.39,41,54–56

Interestingly, income was not signiﬁcantly associated with
disclosure of sexual orientation among all three groups. Pre-
vious research has found mixed results regarding disclosure
of sexual orientation and income status, in which income is
not related to disclosure of sexual orientation as it relates
speciﬁcally to sexual minority men.42,57 However, ﬁndings

indicate that younger BSMM were signiﬁcantly more likely
to fully disclose their sexual orientation globally and to their
xcommunities. Research has indicated that younger sexual
minority individuals are more likely to disclose their sexual
orientation than older sexual minority individuals.58

In the age of virtual support groups and friends, it is possible
that younger BSMM may have increased access to develop-
ing a more diverse set of social support networks with other
sexual minority populations.59 In addition, disclosure of sexual
orientation is also dependent on experiences of stigma and
discrimination, which may accumulate with age.60 Although
some research has indicated that online communities may
serve as buffers to the potential negative consequences of sex-
ual minority identiﬁcation, there is a need to better understand
younger BSMM’s community members and networks when
compared with older BSMM, and the relationships between
full and partial disclosure among family members.59,61

Similar to other research ﬁndings, higher internalized
homophobia was negatively associated with disclosure of
sexual orientation across all three groups.10,16,39,42,55 The

processes of internalized homophobia include the internal-
ization of negative societal concepts of sexual minority
identities, and must be addressed to develop a healthy self-
concept.62,63 Further,
the structural processes that drive
homophobia must be addressed through public health policy.
A need to address internalized homophobia through cultur-
ally tailored interventions is evident, and may help prevent
the internalization of societal negativity among BSMM.

Our exploration of resilience levels and their association
with disclosure of sexual orientation was only supported in
the context of family disclosure; higher levels of resilience
were associated with full disclosure of sexual orientation to
family, but not globally or to community members. Resil-
ience may serve as an important resource for BSMM—but
perhaps only in certain contexts (family, in this study)—as
disclosure of sexual orientation to family may come with
mixed results. BSMM with higher resilience may possess
the resolve to disclose to their families at the risk of incur-
ring negative reactions.10,39,40 Future research should fur-
ther assess the process of resilience development among
BSMM, as resilience development may be resultant of fam-
ily supports.

Contrary to previous studies, alcohol use, illicit substance
use, and depressive symptomology were not signiﬁcantly
associated with disclosure of sexual orientation across all
three contexts, as BSMM have previously reported higher
rates of all three.64,65 Whereas average reported alcohol
use was not within problematic ranges, participants did re-
port high levels of alcohol consumption. Perhaps among
BSMM, alcohol and illicit substance use may not be associ-
ated with minority stressors to the same extent as White sex-
ual minority individuals.

Lower educational attainment was associated with disclo-
sure to family, but not globally or community, contradictory
to previous research. Previous research indicates that BSMM
with higher educational attainment are less likely to disclose
their sexual orientation compared with BSMM with lower
educational attainment.15 Furthermore, depressive sympto-
mology was not associated with disclosure of sexual orienta-
tion. As this was an exploratory study, there is a need to
further evaluate and understand the associative value of dis-
closure of sexual orientation more fully as it relates to health
markers; particularly, with the coexisting factors of resil-
ience and depression.

collected and may have provided additional insights into sex-
ual orientation disclosure among BSMM. Inclusion of HIV-
positive BSMM may also offer further insight into factors
associated with disclosure. A longitudinal study may have
provided more key insights into ﬁndings, as cross-sectional
data are correlational, not causal. Furthermore, enacted and
anticipated homophobia were asked in the context of health
care utilization, which may not have adequately captured
enacted and anticipated homophobia among participants. In
addition, some analyses may have been underpowered.

Conclusions

Limitations notwithstanding, these ﬁndings provide key
insights into factors associated with sexual orientation dis-
closure among BSMM across three contexts. Our ﬁndings
highlight the impacts of age, bisexual identity, and internal-
ized homophobia across all three disclosure contexts. In ad-
dition, results indicate that disclosure to family involves
more unique characteristics when compared with global
and community disclosure among BSMMs, including both
education and resilience. As LGBTQ+ identities become in-
creasingly visible in mainstream society, understanding what
variables promote mental and physical well-being during
disclosure processes are important to understand and study,
particularly for individuals experiencing intersecting sys-
tems of oppression.

Funding Information

Although this was a cross-sectional analysis to determine
factors associated with disclosure of sexual orientation
among HIV-negative BSMM, these ﬁndings provide key
correlational insights into variables associated with disclosure
among BSMM across three contexts. All three contexts were
measured using single-item variables, which may not have
completely captured the complexities of disclosure.66 How-
ever, there have been several studies that have successfully
utilized single-item variables validly.67–69
Interestingly,
global disclosure of sexual orientation did not translate to dis-
closure to both community and family—underscoring how
this variable may have been interpreted by participants.

In addition, community disclosure could include many
different groups, including virtually and in person, and may
have been too broad. Data on participant religiosity were not
