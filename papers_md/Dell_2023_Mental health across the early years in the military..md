Abstract

Background. The mental health impact of the initial years of military service is an under-
researched area. This study is the first to explore mental health trajectories and associated
predictors in military members across the first 3–4 years of their career to provide evidence
to inform early interventions.
Methods. This prospective cohort study surveyed Australian Defence personnel (n = 5329) at
four time-points across their early military career. Core outcomes were psychological distress
(K10+) and posttraumatic stress symptoms [four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4)] with intra-
individual, organizational and event-related trajectory predictors. Latent class growth analyses
(LCGAs) identified subgroups within the sample that followed similar longitudinal trajector-
ies for these outcomes, while conditional LCGAs examined the variables that influenced
patterns of mental health.
Results. Three clear trajectories emerged for psychological distress: resilient (84.0%), worsen-
ing (9.6%) and recovery (6.5%). Four trajectories emerged for post-traumatic stress, including
resilient (82.5%), recovery (9.6%), worsening (5.8%) and chronic subthreshold (2.3%) trajec-
tories. Across both outcomes, prior trauma exposure alongside modifiable factors, such as
maladaptive coping styles, and increased anger and sleep difficulties were associated with
the worsening and chronic subthreshold trajectories, whilst members in the resilient trajector-
ies were more likely to be male, report increased social support from family/friends and
Australian Defence Force (ADF) sources, and use adaptive coping styles.
Conclusions. The emergence of symptoms of mental health problems occurs early in the
military lifecycle for a significant proportion of individuals. Modifiable factors associated with
wellbeing identified in this study are ideal targets for intervention, and should be embedded
and consolidated throughout the military career.

Introduction

Military life can be extremely rewarding but, for some, equally challenging. A significant body
of literature exists informing the impact of military experiences during/after deployment and
transition out of the military (Cheok, Ang, Chew, & Tan, 2000; Mobbs & Bonanno, 2018);
however, there is a critical gap in understanding the health and wellbeing impacts of initial
enculturation into the military. The first few years of a military career encompass initial train-
ing through to advanced training and into postings and eventually to readiness for deployment
and represents a unique period of time in a military career – one that is unlikely to be repeated.
Understanding what influences wellbeing over this unique period, the risks and protective fac-
tors, is crucial for maintaining a healthy and ready workforce. This study is the first to identify
these key factors and provides an early look at mental health trajectories across the initial years
of a military career, offering an important opportunity to pinpoint how and when to build
resilience and mitigate the development of psychiatric disorder in Defence forces.

Longitudinal studies with military populations have characterized trajectories of post-
traumatic stress

Eekhout, Reijnen, Vermetten, & Geuze, 2016; Karsten, Penninx,
Verboom, Nolen, & Hartman, 2013; Nash et al., 2015; Orcutt,
Erickson, & Wolfe, 2004). These studies provide unique and valu-
able insights about changes in mental health over time, and pro-
vide the opportunity to explore factors that predict such changes.
Historically, trajectory studies on military samples have identified
three to six classes or profiles. Typically, military personnel dem-
onstrate stable, low levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms fol-
lowing deployment (the resilient class); however, three other
classes are also commonly found: a chronic class (high, stable
symptoms indicated of disorder), a worsening class (mild/moder-
ate symptoms that escalate to disorder) and a recovered class
(mild/moderate symptoms
reduce to low symptoms).
that
Additional classes for moderate or subthreshold symptom levels
have been identified,
including a temporary-benefit and pre-
existing symptom class of high symptoms that initially decrease,
but remain fluctuating in the subthreshold zone over time
(Andersen et al., 2014; Berntsen et al., 2012; Nash et al., 2015;
Orcutt et al., 2004). Although comparatively far less literature
has examined symptom trajectory heterogeneity for general psy-
chological distress in military populations, the same core trajec-
tory classes appear to be relevant, with evidence supporting the
existence of resilient, recovery and worsening classes (Cabrera &
Adler, 2021; Palmer et al., 2019).

To date, no studies have examined mental health trajectories
across the initial years of the military career, and whether com-
parable classes emerge at this point in time is unknown. The
early period of a military career will bear its own unique chal-
lenges for individuals, and whilst the transitions and adjustments
are markedly different to those during deployments or transition-
ing out of service, the stress and adjustment associated with inte-
grating into military life will be burdensome for some. The extent
to which this stress is reflected in mental health symptoms is cur-
rently unknown. Addressing this gap is vital in developing our
ability to identify those at risk of developing psychopathology
over the military career, and to inform the development of early
resilience training and at what time-points in order to promote
protective mental health factors.

Previous studies have provided insight into predictors of adjust-
ment to the military, showing that most military members adjust
well but some experience periods of increased stress and adversity,
varying in levels of severity from subthreshold adjustment difficul-
ties to full psychiatric disorder (Booth, Probert, Forbes-Ewan, &
Coad, 2006; Cheok et al., 2000; Nakkas, Annen, & Brand, 2016).
Conscientiousness, emotion regulation, social support and impulse
control are factors that have been shown to promote psychological
adjustment to military life within the first 6 years of voluntary (Lee,
Sudom, & Zamorski, 2013; Sudom, Lee, & Zamorski, 2014) and
compulsory (Choi et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015) basic training
and service, whereas exposure to early life stress, and difficulties
with military peers and superiors can lead to maladjustment
(Cheok et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2012). Integrating into military cul-
ture involves significant cultural, physical, psychological and occu-
pational changes, including moving away from established support
networks, complying with military protocols, values and ethics, and
changing sleeping patterns (Martin, Williamson, Alfonso, & Ryan,
2006; Mobbs & Bonanno, 2018). This indicates there may be
unique individual and/or situational protective and risk factors
that
influence whether service members adjust or experience
increased stress and potentially psychological maladjustment. In
order to build on this extant literature, we need to move beyond
tracking
cross-sectional studies to follow a consistent cohort,

patterns and changes in mental health and wellbeing and to iden-
tify specific factors and for whom that may promote or erode
adjustment in the initial years of service and the risks this poses
for further exacerbation of mental health status.

rigorous

Knowing that

the early career period of military service
exposes members to unique stressors (e.g. moving away from
training, handling weapons,
established supports,
changes in sleep) and challenges (Booth et al., 2006; Cheok
et al., 2000; Nakkas et al., 2016), the purpose of this study is to
explore the mental health trajectories, and subsequent predictors
of psychological resilience and vulnerability as highlighted in the
extant literature, for the first time. This study is an invaluable con-
tribution to our understanding of how to promote wellbeing and
mitigate the development of mental health symptoms or disorder
in military personnel from the very outset of a military career.

This study utilized data from a nationally representative, pro-
spective cohort study of 5329 Australian Defence Force (ADF)
members. This study aimed to (1) identify the trajectories of
key mental health outcomes over the first 3–4 years of a military
career and (2) identify factors, many potentially modifiable, asso-
ciated with these trajectories during these early years.

Methods

Study design and participants

Data were drawn from the Longitudinal ADF Study Evaluating
Resilience (LASER-Resilience), a nationally representative, pro-
spective cohort study. The study used a phased enrolment strategy
with a sampling frame of all new full-time general entry (GE) enlis-
tees with surnames between L–Z and all appointed officers entering
the Australian Navy, Army or Air Force between November 2009
and December 2012 (participant n = 5329). All newly enlisted
GEs with surnames beginning with the letters L–Z were eligible
for inclusion. To avoid over-surveying members in the ADF,
those with surnames commencing A–K were instead recruited
into a separate study that was being conducted concurrently.
Previous analyses (Crane et al., 2012) have confirmed that there
were no systematic differences in common baseline measures
between the two groups of GEs (i.e. A–K and L–Z). Given that offi-
cer appointees comprised a much smaller population than GEs,
there were concerns about dividing this sample and reducing the
capacity to examine officers as a unique sub-population; therefore,
all officer appointees were eligible for this study.

Participants were surveyed over five time points from enlist-
ment/appointment
to 4 years post-enlistment/appointment
between November 2009 and November 2016. T1 data collection
occurred at the point of enlistment for GEs, and within the first
few weeks of training commencement for Officers. For most par-
ticipants, T2 occurred at the completion of initial training (with
Officer Cadets completing T2 12 months into initial training).
At the conclusion of participants’ subsequent employment train-
ing, which qualifies individuals for their chosen profession within
the Armed Forces, participants completed the T3 assessment,
which was approximately one year after T2, and before entering
their first posting. Subsequent time points of data collection
occurred annually after completion of T3, at T4 and T5. There
were a total of n = 5696 survey responses at T1, and n = 5329 par-
ticipants also returned surveys at T2. Subsequently, there were n =
1759 participants that returned surveys at T3 and could be linked
with T2 responses, while comparable numbers were n = 1271 at
T4, and n = 1194 at T5. Across the latter time-points, there

were also surveys that could not be linked with earlier survey

records
Accordingly, these unlinked surveys were not informative for pur-
poses of prospective analyses, and are not considered further here.
Preliminary analyses of the analytic sample (comprising surveys
that could be linked prospectively over time) revealed limited evi-
from study attrition (see online
dence of
Supplementary Table S1). Questionnaires were administered in
paper form at T1 and T2 and from T3 onwards were administered
online using the surveying tool Opinio (Version 6.3.3). Due to the
current study’s focus on early career military service, we examined
data collected from T2 to T5. T2 was selected as the most inform-
ative ‘baseline’ for these analyses as this marked the post-initial
training period, when participants had progressed to being part
of the ‘trained force’. All participants in the LASER-Resilience
study who completed assessments at T2 (n = 5329) were conse-
quently included for analysis. See online Supplementary Fig. S2
for a summary of data collection points throughout the study.
The study was approved by the Australian Defence Human
Research Ethics Committee (protocol number: 556-09).

Measures

The primary outcome measures were psychological distress, mea-
sured using the 10-item K10 (Schuster, Kessler, & Aseltine,
1990) and posttraumatic stress symptomatology measured via the
four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4), a shortened version of the
original PCL-C (Weather, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane,
1993). Total scores are calculated for both core outcomes by sum-
ming items to produce a summed score – possible scores ranged
from 10–50 on the K10 and 4–20 on the PCL-4, with higher
scores signifying higher symptom severity.

Predictor variables included sociodemographic measures (see
Table 1) and service-related factors (rank and ADF service
branch). Additional predictors included social support; measured
via a modified version of the ‘supportive and negative social inter-
actions’ scale (Schuster et al., 1990) which separately measures the
frequency of positive and negative social interactions across two
subscales (modified for the military context by separately examin-
ing colleague and leadership interactions, thus forming four sub-
scales); exposure to potentially traumatic events was examined
from T2 onwards using a 15-item Potentially Traumatic Life
Events Checklist, quantified as the aggregate number of poten-
tially traumatic events experienced; perceived sleep impairment
was measured via a modified four-item version of the Sleep
Impairment Index (SII; retaining items assessing difficulty falling
asleep and staying asleep, problems waking too early and satisfac-
tion with current sleeping patterns), where total summed scores
range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater sleep
impairment; anger was measured via the five-item Dimensions
of Anger Reactions
(Forbes et al., 2014, 2004;
Hawthorne, Mouthaan, Forbes, & Novaco, 2006), where total
summed scores range from 5 to 25, with higher scores indicating
greater severity of anger symptomatology; coping styles were
assessed by an adapted 24-item version of the 28-item ‘Brief
COPE’
inventory (Carver, 1997). Based on previous analyses
(Crane, Kehoe, Reid, & Casetta, 2012), 17 items from the full
scale were grouped to form six coping style variables. One item
from the reappraisal scale was removed from analysis due to prob-
lematic psychometric properties. There was low inter-item correl-
ation (>0.15) within the avoidance and risk-taking subscales, so a
single item with the greatest face validity was used for each coping

(DAR-5)

style (‘I avoid thinking or talking about the situation’ and ‘I engage
in risk-taking behaviour, such as speeding, drinking too much or
risky sexual behaviour’ respectively). As such, the final measure
comprised the acceptance (two items), reappraisal (two items),
self-blame (two items), avoidance (one item), risk-taking (one
item) and support-seeking (four items) subscales. Scores for
each subscale were calculated by summing the scores for each
item, which were measured on a four-point Likert scale describing
the frequency of use for each style (1 = not at all, 4 = a lot).

Preliminary analyses of scale unidimensionality and internal
reliability suggested all final scales had strong psychometric prop-
erties, with strong evidence to support the usage of a single
summed scale score (see online Supplementary Table S3).

Data analysis

Analysis were conducted in MPlus version 8 (Muthén & Muthén,
2017), and used full information maximum likelihood estimation
to utilize all available data. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs)
models were estimated for the two primary outcomes to identify
homogenous subgroups within the sample that followed similar
trajectories over time. An exploratory approach was adopted to
identify the optimal number of
latent classes, and initially
involved the estimation and comparison of models specifying
one through five classes. These were estimated using MLR estima-
tion and were initially compared using statistical indices. These
included the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) (Akaike, 1998)
and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978), for
which lower values indicate better model fit, as well as the
Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ratio Test (LMR LRT), which pro-
vides a direct significance test of the relative improvement in fit
for two nested models. The entropy statistic was also considered
and indicates the classification accuracy of different class models.
Entropy values range from 0.0 to 1.0 and estimates >0.70 are clas-
sified as acceptable. Once models that specified the provisional
number of
tools
(depicting the observed/estimated means and trajectories for
each class) were produced to help interpret classes and inform
final decisions about the suitability of the final class models.

latent profiles were determined, graphical

Conditional LCGAs were then specified in order to examine
the individual and situational variables that were associated
with the patterns of mental health (as identified by unconditional
LCGA models for the K10 and PCL-4) in the context of stressors.
These analyses considered predictor variables that were measured
at T2, including sociodemographic characteristics, service-related
variables, as well as social support, total number of lifetime PTEs,
coping styles, anger and sleep impairment.

For each outcome variable, predictors were considered separately
in a series of ‘bivariate’ analyses comprising conditional LCGA
models that evaluated the predictors of ‘class membership’ using
the three-step procedure in MPlus. The latter analyses are equivalent
logistic models in which class membership is
to multinomial
regressed on the T2 explanatory variable, producing effects compar-
ing each class with a ‘reference category’. Given that the preferred
LCGA models for each outcome identified a large class defined
by consistently low scores over time, this was specified as the refer-
ence category of greatest interest for purposes of interpretation.

bMeasured at T1.

Approximately 70% of participants reported some level of
lifetime exposure to potentially traumatic events at T2, most
frequently involving witnessing someone being badly injured or
killed, natural disasters, and being threatened without a weapon
(see Table 2).

Fit indices from a series of potentially plausible unconditional
LCGAs were estimated for the K10 (see online Supplementary
Table S4). While the AIC and BIC values indicated improvements
across increasingly complex models based on the K10,
the
LMR-LRT suggested no significant improvement in fit between
the three-class and four-class models. Accordingly, the three-class
model provided the most suitable account of subpopulations
underlying the trajectories of K10 scores. These included (1)
low and stable class, or ‘resilient’ (84.0%); (2) low and increasing
‘worsening’ (9.6%); and (3) high and decreasing class,
class,
‘recovery’ (6.5%). Class-specific mean trajectories for the K10
are presented in Fig. 1a.

Fit indices from unconditional LCGAs were estimated for the
PCL-4 (see online Supplementary Table S4), and these indicated
that two-class, three-class and four-class solutions were all statis-
tically plausible descriptions of trajectories underlying PCL-4
scores (in contrast, the LMR-LRT indicated no significant difference
between the four-class and five-class solutions). The four-class
solution was selected as the preferred model given substantive
interest in the specific groups identified by this class model.
These included (1) resilient class (82.5%); (2) worsening class

(5.8%); (3) recovery class (2.3%); and (4) moderate and decreasing
class, ‘chronic-subthreshold’ (9.4%). Figure 1b provides a graph-
ical depiction of the class-specific mean trajectories for the PCL-4.
Table 3 shows results for multinomial regression analyses
comparing the worsening and resilient classes for psychological
distress. Being male was the strongest predictor of belonging to
the resilient group, relative to the group that demonstrated wor-
sening distress symptoms over time. Participants reporting high
levels of social support from family/friends, ADF peers and
ADF superiors, as well as those more frequently using acceptance
and reappraisal coping styles were also more likely to be in the
resilient group. Conversely, the use of self-blame and risk-taking
coping styles was most strongly associated with decreased likeli-
hood of being resilient and increased likelihood of demonstrating
worsening symptoms over time; while high trauma exposure;
negative social interactions with family/friends, ADF peers and
ADF superiors; more frequent use of avoidance as a coping
style; high levels of anger; and sleep problems were also key
predictors.

Table 3 also shows comparisons between the recovery and the
resilient classes. While the resilient group displayed consistently
low symptom severity over time, the recovery group was charac-
terized by initially high symptoms which decreased over time.
Participants who were male; reported high social support from
family/friends, ADF peers and ADF superiors; and used accept-
ance and reappraisal coping styles were less likely to belong to
the recovery group, relative to the resilient category – being
male was again the strongest predictor of belonging to the resilient
group. Participants who reported more traumatic events; negative
social interactions from family/friends, ADF peers and superiors;

group rather than the group with worsening symptoms, while
participants reporting high social support from family/friends
and ADF peers/superiors were also more likely to belong to the
resilient group. Conversely, Navy service (relative to Army), num-
ber of traumatic events, use of self-blame coping, anger and sleep
problems were all associated with increased likelihood of belong-
ing to the worsening class, with Navy service acting as the stron-
gest predictor. Further comparisons between other classes on the
PCL-4 outcome are depicted in online Supplementary Table S6.
Generally similar patterns of association were observed for
comparisons between the recovery and resilient categories, except
that social support from ADF superiors and both acceptance and
reappraisal coping were associated with reduced likelihood of
belonging to the recovery category, while the use of avoidance
and risk-taking coping styles was also associated with increased
likelihood of belonging to this category. Comparable associations
were also observed for comparisons between the chronic-
subthreshold v. resilient classes, except that support-seeking was
weakly associated with reduced likelihood of belonging to the
chronic-subthreshold category. The magnitude of associations,
as indicated by odds ratios, appears larger for the comparisons
between the resilient and recovery groups than for the resilience
and chronic subthreshold groups. This indicates that the predictor
variables more clearly distinguished individuals in the resilient
group from those in the recovery group than from those in the
chronic subthreshold group.

Discussion

Interestingly,

This study is the first to explore the mental health impact of the
early years in the military on its members. It offers a first look into

emerged in this study and the approximate proportion of mem-
bers in each were similar to those found in personnel who had
deployed or were transitioning out of the military (Andersen
et al., 2014; Berntsen et al., 2012; Boasso et al., 2015; Bonanno
et al., 2012; Dickstein et al., 2010; Eekhout et al., 2016;
Karsten et al., 2013; Nash et al., 2015; Orcutt et al., 2004), indicat-
ing that the emergence of mental health symptoms is occurring
very early in the lifecycle of a military member, and in the absence
of events such as deployment. Three clear trajectories emerged for
psychological distress, comprising resilient, recovery and worsen-
ing trajectories with four trajectories emerging for post-traumatic
stress symptoms; resilient, recovery, worsening and chronic sub-
threshold trajectories. It is important to note that although a
‘recovery’ trajectory clearly emerged (symbolic of high scores
that decreased over time),
individuals within this group were
still endorsing a number of symptoms of poor mental health
and as such they should be considered an at-risk group that is
worthy of follow-up and potential intervention.

A number of key factors emerged as predictors of the identi-
fied trajectories, similar across both psychological distress and
post-traumatic stress symptom trajectories. The patterns of pre-
dictor variables largely indicated that prior trauma exposure
and critically specific modifiable factors, including the use of mal-
adaptive coping styles (i.e. self-blame, avoidance and risk-taking),
negative social interactions, increased anger and sleep difficulties
are more closely associated with the worsening and chronic sub-
threshold groups, whilst members in the resilience trajectories
were more likely to be male, report increased social support

scores, and (b) four-class model of PCL-4 scores.

more frequent use of self-blame, avoidance and risk-taking coping
styles; as well as anger and sleep problems, were more likely to
belong to the recovery group; the use of self-blame, risk-taking
and avoidance coping styles were particularly strongly associated
with the recovery trajectory. Further comparisons between
other classes on the K10 outcome are depicted in online
Supplementary Table S5.

Table 4 shows results from conditional LCGA models that spe-
cified predictor variables at T2 in the preferred four-class model
of PCL-4 trajectories. Results from multinomial regression ana-
lyses comparing the worsening and resilient classes indicated
that males and Officers were far more likely to be in the resilient

from family/friends and Defence sources, and use adaptive coping
styles (i.e. acceptance, reappraisal). These findings are consistent
with previous literature in the early military career period,
which indicate that social support (Choi et al., 2012; Kim et al.,
2015; Lee et al., 2013; Sudom et al., 2014) and use of adaptive cop-
ing styles promote psychological adjustment
(Britt, Crane,
Hodson, & Adler, 2016; Nakkas et al., 2016), whilst previous trau-
matic exposure and difficulties with military peers and superiors
predict maladjustment (Cheok et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2012). It
may be that high levels of unit cohesion and interconnectedness
act as a social resource that buffers against unique stressors
experienced in the early years of a military career (Mobbs &
Bonanno, 2018), and given the low autonomy context of the

military, adaptive coping styles such as acceptance may be par-
ticularly beneficial (Britt et al., 2016). It is prudent to note that
the directionality of the relationship between social support and
trauma is complex, with evidence suggesting that greater post-
traumatic stress symptoms predict decreased perceived positive
social support over time (Nickerson et al., 2017) and as such
the causation argument is yet to be clearly defined. Regardless,
intervention to strengthen and enhance social supports seems
imperative in mitigating and managing the emergence of mental
health symptoms. It is additionally notable that membership of
the recovery class relative to the resilient class was predicted by
several known risk factors, such as maladaptive coping styles
and lack of social support – in conjunction with the fact that

their symptom severity post-recovery was still above those in the
resilient class, this may suggest that that individuals in the recov-
ery class may yet remain at risk of symptom relapse over time.

Strikingly, most of the key predictors associated with poorer
mental health trajectories represent modifiable factors (e.g. mal-
adaptive coping strategies, levels of anger and sleep difficulties),
and as such, these factors could be targeted via early mental
health screening,
interventions. A
training and psychological
viable approach may be to more actively involve leadership and/
or command members in managing the wellbeing of their unit,
particularly junior leadership. Perceived good leadership has pre-
viously been associated with lower levels of mental disorder,
including PTSD, in Armed Forces members (Jones et al., 2012)
and given the knowledge of personnel in their command that lea-
ders have,
they are well-placed to identify changes in an
individual’

This study has identified, for the first time, the specific modi-
fiable factors that were associated with poorer mental health tra-
jectories in early career military members. Importantly, there is an
existing evidence base to guide support and intervention of these
factors. Intervention may include; for sleep problems: Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for Insomnia (Troxel et al., 2015);
for anger: CBT-based anger management (Cash et al., 2018;
Deffenbacher, 1999) or expressive writing (Sayer et al., 2015);
and for maladaptive coping styles (including avoidance and
rumination), these can be addressed through traditional CBT
techniques that often combined together in treatments such as
the Unified Protocol (Barlow et al., 2017), which combines cogni-
tive therapy, behavioural therapy and mindfulness (Farchione
et al., 2012).

The findings from this study must be interpreted noting some
methodological limitations, including the use of self-report data
and use of abbreviated measures to accommodate the need for
brevity of the assessment battery. Moreover, as is the case in
many longitudinal studies, there were relatively high levels of
attrition – however, regression analyses indicated few major dif-
ferences across participants who were retained v. excluded from
the sample, thus limiting evidence of systematic bias from study
attrition. It should also be noted that due to the long time-course
of the study, which began recruitment in 2009, the primary out-
come for posttraumatic stress (the PCL-4) has more recently been
updated and replaced with the PCL-5. Additionally, it must be
recognized that the timing of when traumatic events occurred
for participants was not specified and is therefore unknown.

With regards to the analyses, the conditional LGCA models
were all bivariate, and did not control for variance that may be
shared across explanatory variables. This approach was appropri-
ate given the study was the first to consider the predictors of tra-
jectory classes among early career military personnel, and there
were no strong expectations regarding potential causal mechan-
isms including confounding and mediation (the latter of which
variable predictive models).
may
However, it is important to highlight that the conditional analyses
only indicate bivariate correlates of trajectory group membership,
and potential causal mechanisms underlying these associations
(including possible confounding) remain unclear.

The next steps building from the present study should examine
the generalizability of these relationships across subpopulations
divided by factors such as service branch, rank or gender – further
examination of potential differences across service branches and
how the factors which underpin mental health trajectories may
differ accordingly would extend our understanding of how to

tailor early identification and intervention for military members.
This study has identified a key difference between service
branches (Navy compared to Army) but this warrants further
exploration.

This is the first study to explore the trajectories of key mental
health outcomes, and factors associated with these trajectories,
over the early years of the military career. The study provides a
unique lens into data to inform ‘upstream’ early interventions
to influence mental health trajectories and the potential mitiga-
tion of subsequent psychiatric disorder, the significant rates of
which have been extensively documented in international
research. Whilst most members adjusted to their new military car-
eer well, a portion demonstrated psychological maladjustment,
indicating that the symptoms of mental health problems can
begin to emerge as early in the military lifecycle. In the absence
of preventative interventions, these military members’
