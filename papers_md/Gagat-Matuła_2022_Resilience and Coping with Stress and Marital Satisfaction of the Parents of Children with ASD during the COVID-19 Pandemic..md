Abstract: Raising and caring for a child with ASD is a challenge for the parents’ marriage relationship.
Caring for a disabled child changes the functioning of the family and requires greater involvement
in care and specialist therapy. The respondents’ answers show that such parents experience higher
levels of stress related to the upbringing and future of the child. However, parenting challenges need
not be a negative experience if the parents support each other. The process of bringing up children in
the family are related, inter alia, to the quality of their parents ‘marriage, which is inﬂuenced by the
partners’ personal resources. The resilience of the partners and coping with this situation contribute
to marital satisfaction. The aim of the study is to ﬁnd out about the relationship between spouses’
resilience and coping styles and their assessment of marriage satisfaction. In total, 50 married couples
participated in the study—50 mothers of children with ASD and 50 fathers, the partners of these
mothers (N = 100). The following tools were used: the Resilience Scale (SPP-25), the Coping Inventory
for Stressful Situations (CISS) and the Well-Matched Marriage Questionnaire (KDM-2), as well as
a survey questionnaire (data on respondents). The results show that the gender of the parent of a
child with ASD does not differentiate the overall assessment of the quality of marriage (the overall
score on the scale indicates a low level of satisfaction with the relationship). When analyzing in detail
the dimensions of individual scales of satisfaction with the relationship, one statistically signiﬁcant
difference was noted for the sex of the respondents in the disappointment dimension, showing that
the level of disappointment in the quality of the relationship is higher in wives than in husbands. In
the other dimensions of satisfaction with marriage: intimacy, personal fulﬁllment, similarity, there
were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in terms of gender of the respondents. The resilience of
the spouses positively correlates with their assessment of marriage satisfaction, and in particular,
openness, perseverance and determination to act increase the level of Task-oriented coping (SSZ)
with difﬁcult situations. All resilience factors negatively correlate with the emotional coping style
(SSE). In both the studied groups, openness is a signiﬁcant predictor of intimacy, and persistence is a
predictor of self-fulﬁlment in a relationship. A predictor of disappointment in women is managing
using substitute activities (ACZ), while in men it is the Emotion-oriented coping (SSE) style. The
results indicate the need to support married couples raising a child with ASD during the pandemic.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak
of the COVID-19 virus as a public health emergency of international concern, identifying
it as a global pandemic [1]. The resulting situation signiﬁcantly affected every aspect of
human functioning, threatening an individual’s life [2] and limiting their social functioning
through the restrictions introduced, which over time signiﬁcantly worsened people’s mental
condition, leading to anxiety disorders and depression [3].

Families and people with disabilities found themselves in a particularly difﬁcult
situation. Their quality of life, including their ﬁnancial situation, mental condition and

progress in rehabilitation signiﬁcantly worsened [4–6]. Research shows that the level
of stress related to the pandemic is much higher among people with disabilities and
their family members than among non-disabled people [7,8]. The situation of families
raising a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is extremely difﬁcult due to the
nature of the complexity of the disorders that occur in the child. The symptoms of the
autism spectrum focus on permanent deﬁcits in social communication and social relations
in many environments, as well as limited, repetitive patterns of behaviour or activity,
including the presence of numerous difﬁcult (aggressive, autoaggressive) behaviours. The
effect of autism spectrum on the population varies greatly from person to person. This
can be from high-functioning to low-functioning, with high limitations and coexistence
of intellectual disability, hence sufferers and their families require support to a varying
extent. As already mentioned, people with low-functioning ASD have great difﬁculties
in using speech and communicating with others. They often have intellectual disabilities,
stereotypical patterns of behavior and activity, and compulsive behaviors that signiﬁcantly
limit functioning. Unlike people diagnosed with low-functioning autism, those with
high-functioning autism are good at speech but do not understand metaphors, jokes and
irony. Despite the fact that they use speech well, they have difﬁculties in establishing and
maintaining relationships with other people, are at the intellectual norm or even have
above-average intellectual abilities. They have sterotypical interests that consume their
time and activity. Both people with high-functioning and low-functioning autism have
great difﬁculty adapting to changes and are very attached to daily routine. In both cases,
there may be numerous difﬁcult behaviors (physical, verbal aggression, autoaggression),
as well as the coexistence of emotional disorders. Due to the difﬁculties in the functioning
of a person with ASD and their immediate environment, including the family, they require
support [9]. Research shows that isolation during the pandemic signiﬁcantly limited
therapeutic services provided to families and children with ASD, forcing them to look for
other solutions for the guidance and support that is so much needed [10].

The high level of stress associated with the pandemic worsened relationships in
families in which a child with ASD was being brought up [11,12], especially since these
families experienced high levels of stress even before the pandemic. Permanent stress
translates into the quality of the marital relationship. Research shows that parents of
children with ASD have lower satisfaction with their relationship than parents of non-
disabled children or parents of children with other developmental disorders [13–20]. The
consequence of these factors are conﬂicts in the relationship [21] and a higher divorce rate
in the group of married couples with a child with ASD. It is worth pointing out that the
rate of divorce remained high throughout childhood, adolescence and early adulthood for
parents of children with ASD, whereas it decreased in childhood (after about 8 years of age)
in the control group [22]. Hence, it is extremely important to assess the satisfaction with
the marriage of parents of children with ASD during the pandemic.

It is worth noting that this article refers to the concept of marital satisfaction developed
by Plop and Rostkowski. According to this concept, satisfaction with a relationship has a
multidimensional structure, which consists of four basic dimensions:

-

-

-

Intimacy—is associated with a high level of satisfaction resulting from a close rela-
tionship with one’s spouse and the assumption that the partners want to build their
own relationship based on full openness, mutual trust, closeness and honesty. Thus,
intimacy reﬂects how much the spouses feel that they are united by a love that allows
them to fully accept their partner;
self-fulﬁlment—this dimension means that thanks to a satisfactory marriage relation-
ship, partners gain the opportunity to fulﬁl themselves following their own system of
values, as well as speciﬁc life tasks;
similarity indicates the level of agreement of the partners in the realization of essential
marriage and family goals;

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

-

disappointment, which indicates a sense of failure in life caused by the fact of getting
married, as a result of which marriage is perceived and experienced as a factor that
threatens the independence and autonomy of the partners [23].

Conceptualization of satisfaction with marriage leads to the question of the determi-
nants of satisfaction of partners with their mutual interactions. In this area, the variables of
each spouse are analysed—their personal resources (resilience and styles of coping with
stress). In this project, resilience is understood in the category of a personality trait, a
speciﬁc mechanism of self-regulation encompassing cognitive, emotional and behavioural
elements [23], while coping styles are remedial actions undertaken by a person in a speciﬁc
stressful situation, and are the result of the interaction between the features of the situation
and the style of the individual’s coping characteristics. This style is their typical behaviour
in various difﬁcult situations. Endler and Parker distinguish between three types of styles:
task-focused, focused on emotions and focused on avoidance [24].

Since marriage is a relationship that passes through various life situations, the per-
sonal resources of the spouses, which may be decisive for the successful overcoming of
difﬁculties experienced in mutual interactions or may inﬂuence them, are of signiﬁcant
importance. The most important of these are resilience and styles and strategies for coping
with stress [24]. Previous studies conﬁrm and show the relationship between the personal
resources of parents of children with ASD and marital satisfaction [25]. In the process of
coping with stress, the quality of the marriage relationship is of great importance, including,
above all, the support of the spouse [26]. Research shows that the high quality of marital
relations between parents of children with ASD reduces the impact of stress and lowers
the risk of depression [27–30]. Moreover, research results show that a strong bond between
spouses may act as a buffer against the inﬂuence of stress factors related to caring for a
child with ASD [31].

As mentioned earlier, the pandemic can be one such stress factor as it has certain
consequences, such as fear for life and health, isolation, risk of loss of income, problems
with access to health care, including rehabilitation, an increase in difﬁcult behaviour in a
child with ASD, and a lack of progress in therapy. This difﬁcult situation can make parents
exhausted and feel overburdened, so personal resources such as resilience and styles of
coping strategies that affect marriage satisfaction are important.

Hence, the aim of this research is to ﬁnd out about the relationships between the
resilience and coping styles of parents of children with ASD and their assessment of marital
satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The following research questions were posed:

Do, and if so, how do the wives and husbands studied differ in terms of resilience,
coping styles and ratings of marital satisfaction?
If they exist, what are the relationships between resilience and coping styles in the
groups of wives and husbands?
Are resilience and coping styles related to the assessment of marital satisfaction in the
group of wives, and if so, how?
Are resilience and coping styles related to the assessment of marital satisfaction in the
group of husbands, and if so, how?

2. Materials and Methods

The research was conducted in 2020 and 2021 at the Specialist Outpatient Clinic for
People with Autism in Le ˙zajsk. 50 married couples participated in the study—50% were
mothers of children with ASD and 50% of fathers, the partners of these mothers. This was
during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, and related restrictions (including
isolation) and access to the research group was signiﬁcantly limited. The average age of the
parents studied was 44 years (from 21 to 56). The majority of the women had secondary
education (69%), followed by higher (20%) and vocational (11%) education. The men, on
the other hand, had mostly secondary education (62%), followed by vocational (21%) and
higher (17%) education. In the case of origin, a division of the studied population into
three groups can be made: village—40% of respondents, city up to 100 thousand—33% of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

4 of 14

respondents, city 100–500 thousand—27% of respondents. The duration of the relationship of
the respondents can be illustrated as follows: 1–10 years (66% of respondents); 11–20 years
(24% of respondents). The criterion for selecting the married couples was that they had a child
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), communicating non-verbally, with auto aggressive
behavior at the age of 5–8. The children had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder with
level 3 autism spectrum disorder (according to the DSM-5). In the research, the child with
ASD was most often the ﬁrst child (53%), the second child in the birth order (28%), and the
third (19%). Raising a low-functioning child with uncertain prognosis is a very stressful
challenge for parents, and was especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where access to
specialist therapy was limited. Hence, the couples received a set of questionnaires with
instructions and a request to complete and return them within the prescribed period. The
respondents were assured of the anonymity and purely scientiﬁc nature of the research.
Incomplete questionnaires were excluded. The research was approved by the relevant
bioethics committee. The purpose of the study was explained to the participants and they
were informed about its anonymity.

The following tools were used in the study: a questionnaire containing questions on
general information about the respondents, i.e., gender, age, place of residence, education,
years of marriage, age of the child and its functioning.

The Resilience Scale (SPP-25) by Ogi ´nska-Bulik and Juczy ´nski was used to measure
resilience. It contains 25 items and measures the general elasticity index and the ﬁve factors
that make up its structure. The respondent assesses the degree to which a given statement
applies to him on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0—deﬁnitely not, to 4—deﬁnitely yes). The
obtained raw numerical result (both for the general index and for individual factors) is
converted into sten norms in accordance with the diagnostic key. The SPP-25 scale is
characterized by good reliability for the entire scale (Cronbach’s 0.85), and the reliability
indicators of the ﬁve subscales are in the range of 0.67–0.75 [32].

The Coping Inventory for was used to measure coping styles in stressful situations
(CISS) by Endler and Parker, in the Polish adaptation by Strelau, Jaworska, Wrze´sniewski
and Szczepaniak. It consists of 48 items, and the test person’s task is to respond to each
statement by marking the answer on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1—never to 5—very often).
The obtained numerical result was analysed in accordance with a key developed by the
authors of the questionnaire and allows for the measurement of three styles of coping
with stressful situations. The obtained raw results for individual scales are converted into
sten norms for people in three age groups: 16–24 years, 25–54 years and 55–79 years. The
CISS questionnaire is characterized by high reliability—the Cronbach values for individual
scales are 0.72–0.92 [33].

The Well-Matched Marriage Questionnaire (KDM-2), by M. Plopa and J. Rostowski,
was used to measure marital satisfaction. It examines the level of marital satisfaction and is
intended for people who are married. The questionnaire consists of 32 statements, to which
the respondent answers on a 5-point Likert scale (from A—“I completely agree” to E—“I
completely disagree”). The results are calculated in four dimensions representing the level
of satisfaction with the relationship: intimacy, self-fulﬁlment, likeness and disappointment.
The sum of the scores on the individual subscales gives the overall score. The psychometric
indicators of the questionnaire are satisfactory. The reliability for the various dimensions
included is in the range of 0.80 to 0.89. The tested internal validity of the questionnaire
was checked using the following methods: examining the internal structure of the test, and
checking intergroup differences and criterion validity [23].

3. Results

All calculations were performed using Statistica 13 software. For each variable, the nor-
mality of the distribution was veriﬁed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which is recommended
for research groups smaller than N = 100. Analysis of the distributions of the studied
variables indicated the dominance of the normal distribution. In order to check whether
and how wives and husbands raising a child with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

differ in terms of the studied variables, the Student’s t-test was used for independent
groups due to the presence of a normal distribution among the studied variables. The raw
results and the results in sten are given in Table 1 below.

The conducted comparative analysis of the average results obtained by the studied
groups in the measurement of resilience and styles of coping with stress did not show
statistically signiﬁcant differences in the scope of the studied variables. This proves that the
studied wives and husbands do not differ in terms of the level of resilience and styles of
coping with stress. It is worth noting that the level of the researched resources is moderate.
It is difﬁcult to make an unequivocal conclusion on the reason for the obtained similarity
of psychological resources of the surveyed spouses raising a child with ASD. Perhaps the
earlier building of long-term relationships with a life partner allows for mutual similarity
in terms of mental resilience and styles of coping with the hardships of living together. It
cannot be ruled out that jointly struggling with a child’s disability contributes to strongly
supporting one another, similarity of styles in coping with a difﬁcult and stressful situation,
coming to agreement on actions, communication and a feeling of closeness, as well as
mutual trust in terms of help and support from a partner in the upbringing of a child with
ASD and the therapy required.

There were also no signiﬁcant statistical differences between the studied groups in
terms of the perceived general level of marital quality. The mean results range from 4 to
7 sten, indicating low and moderate satisfaction with the marriage. The overall result for
the respondents is low (sten 4), which indicates an unsatisfactory assessment of the quality
of the marriage by the respondents. The scores for the individual scales are also low to
moderate. The only signiﬁcant difference among the studied wives and husbands raising

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

6 of 14

a child with ASD was revealed in terms of disappointment with marriage, which was
high among the wives and average among the husbands. In the wives, this may probably
indicate a sense of failure in life, and may also be a signal of a disturbance in independence
and personal autonomy related to overload and stress related to raising a child with ASD,
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may indicate that marriage, to some extent,
prevents them from realizing themselves, their value system and their life tasks. In the
remaining dimensions, the respondents obtained similar results, which proves a similar
assessment of the quality of the marriage relationship.

Subsequently, the relationship between resilience variables and styles of coping with
difﬁcult situations by wives and husbands was established using Pearson’s r correlation
coefﬁcients (see Table 2). For this purpose, r-Pearson correlation analysis was performed,
and the conditions for the correlation were met (the data interval and distribution were
close to normal and were checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

The above correlation matrix allows for the identiﬁcation of many signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the relationships between resilience and coping styles among the groups of wives
and husbands raising a child with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group of
wives, the following resilience factors increase the level of coping with a difﬁcult situation:
perseverance, openness, competence, tolerance and overall resilience. However, there was
no correlation between the wives’ optimistic attitude and their task-oriented coping style.
All the factors of wives’ resilience reduce their tendency to use the emotional coping style,
although only some to a statistically signiﬁcant degree. These are: openness, competence,
optimistic attitude, as well as general resilience. Nevertheless, in the group of wives, an
increase in the level of the avoidance style is observed, manifested in the search for social
contacts by the following resilience factors: openness, competence, tolerance, optimistic
attitude and general resilience.

In the group of husbands, only some factors of their resilience correlate directly and
proportionally to a statistically signiﬁcant degree with the task-oriented style of coping with
difﬁcult situations. These are: perseverance, optimism and general resilience. Resilience
lowers the level of using the emotional coping style, especially competence, tolerance, an
optimistic attitude and general resilience. A similar regularity is apparent in the relation-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

ship between the husbands’ resilience and their use of the avoidance style—engaging in
substitute activities, and there is a particularly strong relationship between perseverance
and husbands taking substitute activities. The similarity between the two groups is found
in the relationship between perseverance and general resilience and the preference for
the task-oriented style in coping with stress. In turn, the differences between wives and
husbands are in the relationship between resilience and the avoidance style—in women,
resilience increases the search for social contacts, and in men it lowers the style of engaging
in alternative activities.

Analysis was conducted of which factors of resilience and what style of coping with
stress in the group of wives inﬂuenced their assessment of marital quality. The results are
presented in Table 3.

In the table above, the predictors of marital satisfaction in the group of wives were
distinguished. For this purpose, regression analysis was carried out with the progressive
stepwise method, which showed the important role of the following resilience factors:
perseverance, openness to new experiences and an optimistic attitude to life. The listed
factors explain 14–35% of the variance of the dependent variable—marriage satisfaction. A
detailed analysis of the impact of resilience on marital satisfaction shows that openness
directly affects intimacy (14% of variance), persistence and openness to new experiences
directly affect self-realization and similarity (35% and 27% of variance), while an optimistic
attitude to life has the opposite percentage effect on both self-realization and likeness.
Regression analysis conﬁrmed the directly proportional impact of style of coping with
difﬁcult situations (such as engaging in substitute activities) on disappointment in the
relationship. Thus, the predictors of marital satisfaction in the group of wives studied are
three resilience factors: persistence and openness (acting in direct proportion), an optimistic
attitude (acting inversely), and the style of coping with difﬁcult situations, such as engaging
in substitute activities to make up for disappointment in the relationship.

In the group of husbands, regression analysis with the progressive stepwise method
revealed a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of two resilience factors on the assessment of marital sat-
isfaction and two styles of coping with stress. Openness has a directly proportional effect
on intimacy (32% of the variance of the dependent variable). Perseverance and determina-
tion in action show a directly proportional effect on self-actualization (33% of the variance
of the dependent variable), as does similarity (22% of the variance of the dependent vari-
able). Moreover, the predictor of disappointment is the emotional coping style of husbands
(b = 0.145), while engaging in substitute activities (avoidance style) turns out to be a predictor
of self-fulfilment (b = 0.144). None of the styles of coping with stress by husbands turned out
to be a significant predictor for the dimensions of intimacy or similarity.

Summarizing the stepwise regression analysis in both research groups, signiﬁcant
differences in the identiﬁcation of predictors of marital satisfaction should be emphasized.
In the group of wives, the predictors of ties are three resilience factors: openness and
perseverance, which act in direct proportion, and one inversely proportional—an optimistic
attitude to life. One of the studied styles of coping with stress (avoidance), that is engaging
in substitute activities, acted directly in proportion to disappointment—the dimension of
marital satisfaction. On the other hand, in the group of husbands, the predictors of marital
satisfaction are openness, persistence and determination in action, as well as the emotional
and avoidance styles for coping with stress. These explanatory variables have a direct
proportional impact on the dependent variable.

It can be concluded that the gender and social role (wife, husband) of the studied par-
ents of a child with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic are important non-psychological
factors in the struggle caring for a disabled child.

4. Discussion of the Results

The studied spouses bringing up a child with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic did
not differ in terms of the level of resilience and the style of coping with stress. Both groups
achieved an average level of resilience, optimal for constructive psychosocial functioning
(5–6 sten). The spouses perceive the current pandemic reality and raising a child with
ASD in terms of a challenge, and are convinced of their own competence for coping with
the difﬁculty of raising a child with a disability, even in such a difﬁcult period as the
pandemic, when there are limited services related to the rehabilitation of the child. They
use various methods of coping with difﬁcult life situations, while maintaining emotional
stability. Resilience, treated as a personality trait, protects their mental balance, reduces
the likelihood of the spouse’s symptoms related to maladjustment and burnout associated
with raising a child with a disability. The level of their resilience shows the respondents
as people able to ﬂexibly respond to the changing perspectives of a child’s rehabilitation
during the pandemic, temporary isolation and the associated difﬁculties. The results
they obtained, indicate an optimal level of resilience (with the most pronounced being
persistence and determination in action). This is conﬁrmed by previous studies conducted
before the COVID-19 pandemic, where parents had moderate levels of resilience, which
indicates that they are resistant to adversity despite the challenges faced by raising a child
with ASD [34–36].

This is also partially conﬁrmed by research conducted by Freisen et al. (2021) during
the COVID-19 pandemic among caregivers of children with ASD. They show that moderate
resilience was achieved by 32.6% of the studied caregivers of children with ASD during the
COVID-19 pandemic (the second largest group), low resilience in 48.9% of respondents,
and high resilience in only 18.5%. The research shows that this level has not changed
signiﬁcantly and is moderate in a large group of respondents, which can be viewed with
optimism and the belief that parents have the inner strength to overcome adversity [37].
Research has revealed that resilient people learn to cope with stressful situations by adapt-
ing to experienced threats and traumatic experiences. There are no statistically signiﬁcant
differences in the style of coping with stress between the group of wives and their hus-
bands. The results are in the range of average results, and both studied groups show
a moderate tendency to use, ﬁrst of all, the technique of problem-solving by cognitive
reformulation of the acquired information, which they can also use to plan problem-solving
(Task-oriented coping (SSZ)). The remedial activity of the spouses studied is adjusted to
the changing needs of the child with ASD, but also to changes in the situation related to
the pandemic and the related limitations and threats. The controllable and uncontrollable
random elements of both the pandemic and caring for a disabled child force the spouses to
make changes in their preferred coping style. Therefore, in such a difﬁcult situation, the
results they obtained, indicating a moderate level of using the avoidance style of coping
with stress, are not surprising. Women prefer to seek social contacts, while men engage in
substitute activities. Refraining from thinking about and acting on the problem protects
the spouses from excessive fear, despair and hopelessness. It allows to distract attention
from a dramatic parenting situation in which the prognosis for the development of a child
with ASD is uncertain. It can be concluded that the avoidance style of coping with stress
enables the studied wives and husbands to prepare personal resources to deal with the
problem through active, task-oriented coping with caring for a child with ASD during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The general assessment result obtained (4 sten- low result) on the quality of the marital
relationship in the group of wives and husbands indicates a lack of satisfaction with
the marital relationship. However, some of the results of the individual dimensions on
the scale oscillate between 4 and 7 sten, indicating low and moderate satisfaction with
marriage. In terms of the scales of intimacy, self-realization and similarity, no signiﬁcant
statistical differences were found between the spouses, which proves they have a similar
perception of their relationship. It is worth noting that husbands rated the dimensions
of intimacy, disappointment and general satisfaction with the relationship slightly lower

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

10 of 14

than their wives, but rated self-realization and similarity higher. There was one signiﬁcant
difference between the studied wives and husbands raising a child with ASD in terms of
disappointment with marriage, which was high in the wives and average in the husbands.
The wives probably feel more overburdened by caring for a child with ASD, and more
often they may think of their relationship in the category of a sense of life failure, where
independence and personal autonomy are disturbed. The more so because the wives
obtained the lowest result in self-realization, which may indicate that the relationship
and raising of a child with ASD and the required therapy, to some extent prevent them
from realizing themselves, their system of values and their life tasks. In the remaining
dimensions, the respondents obtained similar results, which proves a similar assessment
of the quality of the marriage relationship. The low result in overall marital satisfaction in
this study is puzzling, as spouses have resources that protect them from stress. Perhaps the
overall level of satisfaction with the relationship is lower, but its individual factors are average,
which shows that they accept things as they are, and cope with the emotional, cognitive
and behavioural problems associated with caring for a child with ASD during the pandemic
despite disappointment and a willingness to make their relationship look different. They
appreciate intimacy and closeness, empathy, relationship with a life partner and cooperation
with them that can keep up their spirits and overcome the problems of a changed everyday
life, as evidenced by the results on the average level of intimacy and similarity.

A comparative analysis of the average results obtained in the individual areas studied
did not show any statistically signiﬁcant differences. In fact, research conducted among
parents of children with ASD before the pandemic shows differences in the preferred
styles of coping with stress. The results of the research and analyses by E. Pisuli (2002)
show that parents more often use the avoidance style of coping with stress [38]. Research
by Sekułowicz (2013) showed that mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders
used different coping strategies than fathers. High and continuous stress in mothers also
increased the risk of burnout. The coping strategies used include seeking emotional support,
discharging emotions and denial, and in the case of mothers who are most burned out,
ceasing activities. Fathers declared that they use positive re-evaluation, and they are also
more satisﬁed with the support received than women. In times of family crisis, mothers
cope worse and use emotions and avoidance behaviours [39]. In a similar study by M.
Dudek (2017), among parents of children with ASD, mothers relatively more often than
fathers display the avoidance-focused style (SSU) and the style of engaging in substitute
activities (ACZ) [40].

In this study, it is only the mosaic of dependencies between their properties (traits)
that shows the differences between men and women raising a child with ASD during the
pandemic. Particularly marked differences appear in the relationship between resilience
and the coping styles of wives and husbands. In the group of women, persistence, openness,
personal competence and tolerance towards failure increase the level of the task-oriented
style of coping with stress. In the group of men, only persistence and an optimistic attitude
to life correlate directly with the task-oriented style of coping with difﬁcult situations.
In both women and men, all resilience factors negatively correlate with the emotional
coping style. However, both husbands and wives use resilience for the avoidance coping
style of raising a child with ASD. Women look for social contacts and men engage in
various alternative activities. The picture of the indicated relationships between the studied
variables shows that both wives and husbands use their resilience to deal with the traumatic
situation of raising a child with ASD, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, while
protecting themselves against despair, fear and hopelessness through the use of unique
coping styles. This is conﬁrmed by previous pre-pandemic studies conducted by Byra and
Parchomiuk (2015) among mothers of children with ASD, where a signiﬁcant but weak
relationship between resilience and strategies was found. Positive relationships between
selected resilience indices and task coping, and negative relationships with emotional-
avoidance were established [41]. Other research by Gagat-Matuła (2021) conducted during
the COVID-19 pandemic among parents of children with ASD showed that respondents

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

11 of 14

more often prefer constructive coping with stress using the task focused style (SSZ) if a
spouse assesses both themselves and their spouse as more supportive and engaged in
communication (marriage communication) and less deprecating. Moreover, the greater the
difference between self-assessment and that of the spouse in deprecating communication
(marriage communication), the less often the task-focused style (SSZ) was preferred. The
results are statistically signiﬁcant [42].

Another area showing the differences between wives and husbands is the relationship
between their psychological resources and the assessment of marital satisfaction, calcu-
lated using backward stepwise regression analysis. Openness in both studied groups is a
signiﬁcant predictor of intimacy, allowing spouses to feel close to each other and to feel
emotional contact in difﬁcult life situations. Perseverance is the predictor of self-fulﬁlment
in the relationship for both wives and husbands. In the case of women, this is also true
for an optimistic attitude to life, and in men, the avoidance style—engaging in alternative
activities (ACZ).

Wives and husbands differ in terms of predictors of similarity and disappointment. In
women, openness and an optimistic attitude to life have a signiﬁcant positive impact on the
aforementioned factor of marital satisfaction, that is similarity. In turn, in men, persistence
has a signiﬁcant positive effect on this factor. The predictor of disappointment in women
is the avoidance style—engaging in alternative activities (ACZ), and in men the emotion-
oriented coping style (SSE). This proves that these styles act directly in proportion to the
factor of disappointment in the assessment of marital satisfaction. This result shows that
disappointment in their relationship increased in women raising a child with ASD during
the pandemic. Meanwhile, engaging in alternative activities (watching TV, video games,
getting enough sleep, wishful thinking about pleasure, sometimes overeating) gives them
the opportunity to reduce emotional tension and prevents them constantly thinking about
parental trauma, although unfortunately this translates into disappointment with marriage.
In turn, in men, the predictor of disappointment in a relationship is the emotion-oriented
coping style (SSE), which consists of experiencing and trying to discharge emotions. This
can involve worrying about things, complaining or fantasizing, or using “it’s going to be
all right” wishful thinking without making any particular effort to make it work. Failure to
make an attempt increases disappointment in the relationship over time. It is worth noting
that the preferred avoidance styles limit the spouses’ time together and may lower their
satisfaction with their marriage. Interesting results were found in research conducted by
Bijing He et. al. (2021) during the pandemic among a large population of married couples
with a child with ASD. These show that the time spent raising children had a negative
impact on the quality of the relationship because it directly limited the time parents could
devote to their personal relationship. The longer the time spent by the wives had no effect
on their relationship with their husbands; in fact, the time wives spent on their children
also made their husbands dissatisﬁed. This can be explained by the fact that the husbands
were unhappy because the wives spent so much time with their children, resulting in
husbands feeling neglected [43]. Also, the Gagat-Matuła (2021) study conducted in the
COVID-19 pandemic among married couples with a child with ASD, showed that spouses
more often prefer non-constructive coping with stress using the emotion-focused style
(SSE) or the avoidance-focused style (SSU) if the spouses assesses both themselves and
their spouse as depressed. The greater the difference between their own assessment and the
assessment of their spouse in supportive communication, the more often the respondents
prefer the style focused on emotions (SSE) and the style focused on avoidance (SSU) [43].
This study has some advantages and, at the same time, interpretation limitations. One
of the limitations is the targeted selection of groups of spouses caring for a child with ASD
(selection based on the medical diagnosis of the child), while at the same time this is an
advantage because the selection took place during the pandemic (access to the sample was
significantly limited) and the research was not conducted online. Where we were not sure
if the respondents were the parents of a child with ASD, we had such certainty because
the research was carried out at the Specialist Clinic for People with Autism. The study also

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12372

12 of 14

included only married couples with children aged 5–8 years old with level 3 autism spectrum
disorder (according to the DSM-5), while children with ASD at levels 1 and 2 and at other
stages of the child’s development were not included. The analyses have not been redrawn
with the use of sociodemographic variables, which may turn out to be important, so they
will be used in further analyses of the above-mentioned studies. The sociodemographic
data in this article served to illustrate the research group. It was worth extending and
comparing the results of the study to a control group of married couples without a child
with ASD, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic did not only affect the parents of
children with ASD. It may be interesting to compare these results. It was also worth
broadening the survey to include questions about social behavior that contributed to such
marriage problems during the pandemic. The results of longitudinal studies conducted
before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic could be of interest. Despite the presented
limitations, the results of the study bring new content to the issues of marital satisfaction of
parents who care for a child with ASD in a period of special limitations and threats such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, especially since there are few studies conducted in this area.

5. Conclusions

The conducted comparative analysis of the average results obtained by the studied
groups in terms of resilience and styles of coping with stress did not show any signiﬁcant
statistical differences, and the results of their dimensions were at a moderate level. There
was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between women and men in the general level
of marital satisfaction, which turned out to be low, although the level of the individual
dimensions of intimacy, self-fulﬁlment and similarity was moderate, and the level of
disappointment was high. Wives feel much more disappointed with their marriage than
husbands, which is perhaps related to the difﬁculty of raising a child with ASD in such
an unfavourable period as the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group of wives, the following
resilience factors increase their assessment of marital satisfaction: perseverance, openness,
personal competence, and tolerance of failure increase the level of the task-oriented style of
coping with stress. In the group of husbands, persistence and an optimistic attitude to life
increase the level of the task-oriented style of coping with difﬁcult situations. It is worth
emphasizing that in both women and men, all resilience factors negatively correlate with
the emotional coping style. Although husbands and wives also use resilience to avoid the
coping style of raising a child with ASD, women look for social contacts and men engage
in various alternative activities. The aforementioned relationships show that both wives
and husbands use their resilience for task-oriented coping with the traumatic situation of
raising a child with ASD, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time
protect themselves against despair, fear, burnout and powerlessness through the use of
an avoidance coping style. In both the studied groups, openness is a signiﬁcant predictor
of intimacy, allowing spouses to feel close to each other and to feel emotional contact in
difﬁcult life situations. Perseverance is the predictor of self-fulﬁlment in the relationship for
both wives and husbands. In the case of women, this is also true for an optimistic attitude
to life, while in men, for the avoidance style—engaging in alternative activities (ACZ).
Wives and husbands differ in the predictors of similarity and disappointment. In women,
openness and an optimistic attitude to life have a positive effect on similarity, while in men,
persistence has a signiﬁcant positive effect on this factor. The predictor of disappointment
in women is avoidance-oriented coping (ACZ), and in men—emotion-oriented coping
(SSE). This result shows that disappointment with the relationship increased in women in
the situation of raising a child with ASD during the pandemic. Meanwhile, engaging in
alternative activities gives them the opportunity to reduce emotional tension and avoid
constantly thinking about everyday problems, although unfortunately this translates into
disappointment with their marriage. In turn, in men, the predictor of disappointment with
a relationship is the emotion-oriented coping style (SSE), which consists of worrying about
various matters without making any speciﬁc efforts to resolve them. Failure to make an
attempt increases disappointment with the relationship over time.

The results indicate the need to support married couples raising children with ASD
during periods of isolation. Intervention and social support are needed so that spouses can
draw on personal resources that translate into overall satisfaction with their marriage, thus
easing the hardships associated with care for and therapy of a child with ASD.
