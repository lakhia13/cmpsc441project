Abstract

Introduction:  Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a treatable mental health condition that 
is associated with a range of psychobiological manifestations. However, historical controversy, 
modern day misunderstanding, and lack of professional education have prevented accurate 
treatment information from reaching most clinicians and patients. These obstacles also have 
slowed empirical efforts to improve treatment outcomes for people with DID. Emerging 
neurobiological findings in DID provide essential information that can be used to improve 
treatment outcomes.

Areas covered:  In this narrative review, the authors discuss symptom characteristics of 
DID, including dissociative self-states. Current treatment approaches are described, focusing 
on empirically supported psychotherapeutic interventions for DID and pharmacological agents 
targeting dissociative symptoms in other conditions. Neurobiological correlates of DID are 
reviewed, including recent research aimed at identifying a neural signature of DID.

Expert opinion:  Now is the time to move beyond historical controversy and focus on improving 
DID treatment availability and efficacy. Neurobiological findings could optimize treatment by 
reducing shame, aiding assessment, providing novel interventional brain targets and guiding novel 
pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions. The inclusion of those with lived experience 
in the design, planning and interpretation of research investigations is another powerful way to 
improve health outcomes for those with DID.

Introduction

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a treatable mental health condition affecting 
approximately 1% of adults in the general population [1–4]. A foundational body of 
theoretical and clinical work, and a small but growing body of empirical research supports 
the effectiveness of a phase-oriented psychotherapeutic approach for the treatment of DID 
[5–9]. Psychotropic medications are typically used adjunctively to manage commonly co-
occurring symptoms [10–12], though there is limited support for a psychopharmacologic 
approach targeting dissociative symptoms specifically [13].

Regrettably, historical controversy, modern day misunderstanding, and lack of professional 
education have prevented accurate treatment information from reaching most clinicians and 
patients [9,14]. These obstacles also have slowed empirical efforts to improve treatment 
approaches and outcomes for people with DID. Fortunately, with recent advances expanding 
our knowledge about the neurobiology of DID [15–17], the field is poised to leverage a more 
sophisticated biological understanding of this condition to optimize treatment.

Our objective in this narrative review is to provide a cutting-edge overview of DID treatment 
and to identify novel paths forward for optimizing treatment leveraging neurobiology. 
To accomplish this, we first define DID and its central dissociative symptoms, explicate 
how this condition, like other mental health conditions, can be explained by a diathesis-
stress model, and briefly address historical controversy about DID. Next, we overview 
the current state of DID treatment, including a phase-oriented psychotherapeutic approach 
and adjunctive psychotropic medications for dissociative symptoms that target the opioid, 
serotonergic, and glutamatergic systems. Next, we overview the systems-level neurobiology 
of DID. We end with an expert opinion section in which we propose the novel integration 
of our neurobiological understanding of DID, and the inclusion of the lived-experience voice 
will propel the next wave of DID treatment research forward.

2.  Dissociative Identity Disorder Defined

DID is a psychobiological syndrome. With an onset during early childhood, DID occurs 
in the context of maltreatment perpetrated most often by caregivers [2,9,18], and it 
is delineated by the subjective experience of identity alteration [1]. Typically, children 
gradually develop a felt sense of self that is coherent and stable across time, different

emotional experiences, and contexts [14,19]. However, it is theorized that for children with 
an innate capacity to dissociate at a level significant enough to generate DID, the timing 
and nature of maltreatment influences identity formation in characteristic ways [14]. As 
a result, individuals with DID experience behavioral and emotional states that feel jarring 
[20], discrete, and partially or wholly unconnected to other states [14]. These subjectively 
separate, compartmentalized mental states are termed “dissociative self-states” (see also 
personality states, identity states, alters, parts) [17]. In this section, we provide an overview 
of self-states in all people and then discuss unique qualities of dissociative self-states. Next, 
we describe additional dissociative symptoms occurring in DID, as well as a proposed 
diathesis stress model for DID. Finally, we cover reasons for the historical controversy and 
modern-day misunderstanding surrounding DID.

2.1  Self-states

In all people, self-states are particular “ways of being you” [21,p.66]. Your subjective 
experience in a particular self-state might include your bodily experience, your perception 
of what you look like, characteristics or abilities you have, and how you feel about yourself 
in a certain context [14,17]. For example, in a specific self-state you might feel yourself 
breathing rapidly with a sense of tension in your body. You have the perception that you look 
sturdy in your body as it is poised to hit a tennis ball. You are aware of your ability to be 
a strong, competitive tennis player. You feel a sense of proficiency and pride. In this way, a 
self-state includes perceptions, actions, and internal states (e.g., affect) [17,22].

Moreover, self-states are a dynamic network of brain activity involved in perception, action, 
and internal state experience [22]. The brain activity associated with a particular self-state 
develops over time and is stored in memory. Consequently, it can change over time with 
new experiences [17]. Everyone experiences self-states, and everyone lies on a continuum of 
having collections of more integrated versus dissociative self-states [17].

In DID, a dissociative self-state is also a dynamic collection of perceptions, actions and 
internal states based on past experiences stored in memory (just like a non-dissociative 
self-state). However, what makes a dissociative self-state in DID unique is this: A shift in 
sense of agency and ownership occurs such that you feel as if one self-state becomes an 
observer, while another self-state takes control of the “wheel” and drives on (R. Oxnam, 
personal communication, February 2016). Furthermore, dissociative self-states subjectively 
feel separate – as if they do not belong to you (“not me”), and often as if they belong 
to someone else who lives inside the mind [23,24]. Importantly, individuals with DID 
logically understand these experiences must be their own despite feeling separate and “not 
me.” While they often suffer from self-puzzlement, their ability to reality test is intact and 
they exhibit a high capacity for reflective thinking about self and others [25]. Dissociative 
identity alteration is not akin to psychosis [26–30].

Dissociative self-states often are dominated by a specific collection of memories, affect, and 
behaviors ([31]; see also the related concept of “modes” in [32,33]). An individual with 
DID may also associate a mental image or bodily experience with a particular dissociative 
self-state [23,34–36]. Imagine, for example, you are a woman with a history of chronic 
childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a family member. In a dissociative self-state, you

might feel like a frightened young girl – with a feeling that your body is small like a child’s 
body (despite being an adult woman), and that you are in danger. In another dissociative 
self-state, you might feel numb, perceive yourself to look like an adult woman (as you 
are biologically), but your body feels unreal: “That little girl is not me! Those feelings 
can’t be mine” [17]. These dissociative self-states are often experienced as “intruding” into 
awareness in an automatic and startling way [20]. This can contribute to the subjective 
experience in DID of lacking a cohesive feeling of self and identity [20].

A mind made up of highly compartmentalized, discrete dissociative self-states helps to 
preserve a child’s cognitive and emotional capacities (e.g., humor, empathy, hope, joy), 
and to preserve relational bonds with caretakers despite experiences of maltreatment and 
profound attachment dilemmas [37–41]. It is a powerful, internal coping mechanism when 
the “outside world” offers no other support or help. At the same time, in adulthood, this 
identity alteration can interfere with occupational, relationship, and day-to-day functioning. 
In this way, DID represents a paradoxical condition: it is both a successful survival strategy 
in the context of childhood maltreatment as well as a cause of significant distress and 
impairment in other contexts [14,19,36,42].

2.2  Additional Dissociative Symptoms

People with DID also experience amnesia, or gaps in their memory, for important personal 
information, aspects of traumatic experiences, and day-to-day events [1,43]. This experience 
of amnesia typically is state dependent [44–46]. For example, while experiencing one 
dissociative self-state, a person may hold awareness of thoughts, emotions, and memories 
of severe abuse, whereas when experiencing another dissociative self-state, they feel 
subjectively that they have diminished or even no awareness of those same experiences. 
The degree of amnesia and discrete separation between dissociative self-states can be highly 
variable and may be related to the emotional tolerability of information connected to those 
states [5].

In addition to disruptions in identity and experiences of amnesia, individuals with DID 
also experience other forms of pathological dissociation and identity confusion [47]. They 
frequently experience depersonalization, a subjective sense of detachment from their sense 
of self, mind and body [1]. For example, they may feel as if they are floating above their 
own body or as if they only exist from the neck up. They also frequently experience 
derealization, a sense of disconnection from their surroundings [1]. For example, they may 
feel as if they are in a dream or a movie. These experiences can occur both within and 
outside of stressful moments.

This constellation of symptoms and the resulting discontinuity of experience in DID often 
results in a deep sense of “puzzlement” or confusion about oneself and one’s situation 
(“why am I like this? What is wrong with me?”) [20,48,49]. Tragically, not only is there 
puzzlement about oneself, but people with DID also experience profound levels of shame 
related to their maltreatment and often intense feelings of being unworthy of love and 
belonging [21,50].

2.3  Diathesis Stress Model of DID

A diathesis-stress model of DID predicts this condition occurs only in individuals 
who possess an underlying predisposition or vulnerability toward DID (diathesis) and 
simultaneously experience specific stressful circumstances (stress). Here we briefly 
overview the hypothesized diatheses and the necessary environmental stressors to produce 
DID.

2.3.1  Diathesis—The diathesis in DID is theorized to involve an innate capacity for 
dissociation and/or hypnosis [51–54]. Hypnotic states (also known as trance states) involve 
a particular type of attention in which the person can maintain highly focused, receptive 
concentration coupled with reduced peripheral awareness [55]. Hypnotic states also include 
trance logic [56]. Trance logic is the juxtaposition of mutually incompatible elements of 
experience without anxiety [55]. Prior work suggests that adults with DID have an extremely 
high capacity to enter hypnotic states – and do so on their own without guidance (i.e., enter 
“autohypnotic” trance states) [40,51,57,58].

As with any psychiatric condition [59], the underlying predisposition toward DID, that is the 
capacity for dissociation and/or hypnosis, is likely genetically mediated. There are currently 
no DID-specific molecular genetic studies; however, recent research points to some possible 
links between dissociative symptoms in PTSD and genes related to learning and memory 
function [60,61].

2.3.2.  Stress—As discussed earlier, the “stress” that serves as the catalyst for 
the development of DID involves intolerable, physically inescapable early childhood 
maltreatment often at the hands of caregivers [51–54]. A large body of systematic empirical 
research has found individuals with DID consistently report severe histories of childhood 
neglect and abuse [2].

2.3.3  Diathesis-Stress—Taken together, it is theorized that, as young children 
subjected to maltreatment, individuals with DID automatically used their genetic and brain-
based ability for autohypnosis to compartmentalize overwhelming and conflicting thoughts, 
feelings, sensations, memories, and body images. By way of trance logical interpretations 
of depersonalization experience (out of body experiences), they then personified these 
conflicting thoughts, feelings etc. onto perceived other aspects of self, resulting in 
psychological distancing among self-states and the pseudo-delusion of separateness (i.e., 
“not me” aspects of self) [23]. Individuals who experienced the same maltreatment, but 
who lack the capacity for dissociation and/or autohypnosis, would not develop dissociative 
self-states to cope with their maltreatment.

2.4.  Historical Controversy and Modern-Day Misunderstanding

A wealth of evidence supports the validity of DID as a diagnosis and the significance of 
childhood trauma and maltreatment in the development of DID [2,18,62]. However, DID 
remains a highly stigmatized and underdiagnosed condition due to historical controversy 
and modern-day misunderstanding [9,14,63]. Historically, misunderstanding about DID is 
rooted in an unwillingness to acknowledge the prevalence and impact of child abuse, and in

particular an unwillingness to acknowledge its impact on women and girls [64–66]. In this 
vein, “fantasy models” (see also, “sociocognitive models”) of DID propose that symptoms 
of dissociation, fantasy proneness, and suggestibility lead to false or exaggerated reports of 
child abuse and DID (e.g., [67]). Moreover, these models of DID propose that the condition 
is iatrogenic – created and reinforced by psychotherapists, media influences, and general 
sociocultural expectations regarding the symptoms and causes of DID (e.g., [68]).

There is no empirically derived evidence to support these claims of the fantasy model [18]. 
In contrast, empirical evidence from neurobiological studies, experimental investigations, 
and epidemiological surveys strongly supports the validity of DID diagnosis and the 
importance of maltreatment to its development [2,18,62]. Studies that have sought 
independent corroboration of childhood maltreatment have found compelling evidence 
in most cases [3]. Unfortunately, fantasy models pervade modern cultural understanding 
of DID, media portrayals, psychology textbooks, and clinical training [5]. Historical 
controversies echo into the present and have resulted in concrete harms and prolonged 
suffering for people with DID: underdiagnosis, years-long delays in accessing care, 
stigmatizing responses from some clinicians, treatment barriers, and a stunted body of 
research into empirically based treatments [64,65,69]. Moving forward, it is critical for 
the field to continue combating this misinformation with empirical studies of DID and its 
treatment.

3.  Current Treatment Approaches to DID

Despite barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment access, expert consensus guidelines 
and a small but growing body of empirical work delineate effective psychotherapeutic 
treatment practices. With respect to medication treatments, there are no randomized, placebo 
controlled clinical trials specifically targeting dissociative symptoms in DID. However, 
there are studies evaluating efficacy of psychotropics for depersonalization and derealization 
symptoms in individuals with other psychiatric conditions. First, we cover expert consensus 
guidelines regarding the psychotherapeutic approaches to DID and empirical studies on 
DID treatment, and then we overview studies evaluating medications to target dissociation-
specific symptoms in non-DID samples.

3.1  Psychotherapy.

A long and robust history of clinical work (e.g., [7,40]), as well as a growing body 
of empirical examinations of dissociation-specific interventions, provide evidence for 
the treatability of DID. Expert consensus guidelines recommend long-term relational 
psychotherapy as the main approach to DID treatment [8]. As DID emerges from childhood 
maltreatment in the context of early attachment relationships, the individual loses trust in the 
world and “an Other” [70]. This loss is experienced as part of a profound devaluation of self. 
It results in a seismic hollowing-out of agency, loneliness, and often abjection [71].

From this perspective, said plainly, relationships with other people are the problem, and 
simultaneously people are also part of the solution. Symptoms of DID can be ameliorated 
in the context of a safe enough, but not too safe, long-term therapeutic relationship [72].

The central tenet in a relational approach to trauma treatment is that only in the context of a 
trusting relationship is there enough safety to chance re-engagement in human relationships.

With the trusted therapeutic relationship as the setting, the overarching goal of DID 
treatment is to improve functioning by very gradually – and safely – working to 
support a person’s ability to experience trauma-related thoughts, emotions, memories, 
and body image as their own [8]. The strength of the therapeutic relationship and the 
maintenance of firm boundaries are essential ingredients in successful psychotherapy with 
individuals diagnosed with DID [5,6,21,23,39]. Working through traumatic transference/
countertransference patterns is an integral part of treatment [73,74].

As with other complex trauma-related conditions, treatment of DID occurs in phases [8]. 
Although the phases are described separately, there often is fluid movement between phases 
and safety and stabilization are addressed throughout treatment [8]. In Phase 1, often 
referred to as “safety and stabilization,” the goals are fostering a sense of safety and trust 
in the therapeutic relationship, developing a shared understanding and language around 
the individual’s experiences of dissociation, and enhancing emotion regulation skills [5]. 
This is accomplished by providing psychoeducation about complex PTSD and dissociation 
and by teaching specific skills to maintain safety, increase tolerance of emotions, manage 
dissociation with grounding techniques and posttraumatic intrusions with containment 
techniques.

Brand and colleagues recently have developed a manualized intervention for Phase 1 of DID 
treatment referred to as Finding Solid Ground [5]. This program consists of workbook-based 
educational modules and homework assignments that can be implemented in individual or 
group-based settings [75]. Overall, Phase 1 builds the capacity to tolerate and cope with 
trauma-related emotions and intrusions, as well as support in differentiating the traumatic 
past from the present.

Phase 2 involves more direct confrontation, working through, and processing of trauma-
related memories. However, dissociative symptoms can interfere with effective trauma 
processing (e.g., [76]). Specifically, dissociation can impede the emotional learning that 
is necessary to extinguish fear and shame around these experiences by disrupting immersion 
and attention to the traumatic memories. As such, patients must first decrease reliance on 
dissociation in Phase 1 to prepare for Phase 2 [8].

Trauma processing in Phase 2 of DID treatment emphasizes gradually discussing past and 
current trauma-related events and feelings while consistently keeping within a patient’s 
window of tolerance for affect. Phase 2 can also involve short-term manualized interventions 
for PTSD such as cognitive processing therapy or eye movement desensitization and 
reprocessing therapy, though these can be challenging to implement with fidelity in 
the treatment of DID [5]. For example, the efficacy of some manualized treatments is 
diminished when dissociation is the primary, reflexive manner of coping [76–82], as is the 
case in DID. Additionally, suicidality and self-harm behaviors occur at high rates in DID 
[83] and adhering to the strict pacing of manualized interventions is not always feasible in 
these cases [5]. However, specific techniques associated with manualized treatments can be

useful when integrated into a collaborative, long-term relational framework (e.g., gradual 
building of proficiency through thoughtful in vivo exercises).

Phase 2 can also leverage an individual’s innate capacity for hypnotic experience by 
teaching patients to use self-hypnosis. This can provide not only a boost to a sense of 
self-efficacy and increased capacity for affect regulation, but also can be used therapeutically 
to significant effect [8,84–87]. For example, hypnosis can be used for increasing a sense of 
safety, developing inner resources, as well as helping to regulate abrupt or jarring switches 
between dissociative self-states that are often provoked by overwhelming affect. Overall, 
Phase 2 builds feelings of agency and ownership over trauma-related thoughts, feelings, 
memories, and actions.

Finally, Phase 3 is focused on reconnection. Specifically, this phase centers around 
supporting the individual in reconnecting with themselves and developing new connections 
with others, if they wish [5]. Some may consider that trauma work is complete once trauma 
memories are processed and no longer intrusive. However, such work results in a new way 
of being in the world. This new way of being – in which individuals with DID may no 
longer experience “not me” senses of self but rather believe and understand that “it was 
me, after all, all along” – requires time for acclimation and proficiency in new methods for 
healthy, effective coping [5,6,40,88]. Overall, Phase 3 builds capacity to navigate the world 
and relationships with less reliance on dissociation [8].

3.1.1.  Empirical Research on Psychotherapeutic Interventions for 
Dissociation and DID.—A small, but growing, body of empirical evidence indicates 
that the phased psychotherapeutic treatment model is effective for people with DID [25,89–
93]. Next, we highlight key results from this body of empirical treatment research. First, 
we highlight results from a series of studies conducted over the past decade collectively 
referred to as the “Treatment of Patients with Dissociative Disorders (TOP DD)” studies. 
These studies included individuals with DID and other specified dissociative disorders type 
1 (OSDD; like DID but not meeting full criteria) [1] and have covered a range of designs, 
including naturalistic treatment-as-usual observations, systematic implementation of a Phase 
1 intervention. We end this section with a discussion of two randomized control trials of 
Phase 1 interventions for DID/OSDD.

TOP DD naturalistic studies observed treatment-as-usual standard of care for DID/OSDD 
with no additional interventions from the research team [25,91]. This international endeavor 
collected data from 280 patients and 292 therapists over the course of 2.5 years. Brand 
and colleagues found that when comparing patients first cross-sectionally, individuals 
in earlier phases of treatment had more PTSD and dissociative symptoms, self-harm 
behaviors and psychiatric hospitalizations compared to individuals in later phases of 
treatment [25]. Moreover, compared to baseline assessments, follow-up assessments at 
2.5 years indicated patients had significant decreases in PTSD, dissociative symptoms, 
other psychiatric symptoms, and suicidal behaviors, as well as improved global functioning 
[91]. These follow-up assessments also indicated decreased treatment costs over time [94]. 
A subset of participants completed a long-term, 6-year follow-up assessment revealing 
further improvements in daily functioning, fewer psychiatric hospitalizations and sexual

revictimizations for individuals who remained in treatment [92]. This series of studies 
suggests that the standard of care phased treatment for DID with trained clinicians is 
effective, though a randomized control trial will be needed to establish causality.

To improve access to treatment and address gaps in professional education, Brand and 
colleagues recently developed a standardized Phase 1 adjunctive intervention specifically 
for individuals with DID, OSDD or significant trauma-related dissociation (e.g., dissociative 
subtype of PTSD; TOP DD Network Study) [93]. This intervention consists of self-paced 
psychoeducational videos and written exercises available to both patients and therapists. 
Topics covered include psychoeducation about PTSD and complex PTSD, maintaining 
safety, and how dissociation can interfere with healthy emotion regulation. The content of 
this intervention was iteratively refined based on feedback from people with lived experience 
of DID [93]. Longitudinal assessments demonstrated robust reductions in symptoms of 
depression, PTSD and dissociation, non-suicidal self-injury, and improvements in emotion 
regulation and adaptive capacities [93]. Individuals farther along in treatment trended 
towards fewer hospitalizations and suicide attempts. Participants who reported the highest 
levels of dissociation at baseline were those who benefitted most significantly from this 
online psychoeducational intervention. This finding suggests this Phase 1 intervention may 
best serve those in greatest need.

Of note, participants were not excluded from this Phase 1 online intervention based on 
co-occurring conditions, presence of self-harm or suicidality, recent hospitalization, or 
ongoing traumatization [93]. Historically, individuals with DID have been almost universally 
excluded from treatment studies based on their high rates of co-occurring psychiatric 
conditions, medication usage, and/or difficulties with safety. Given this, this series of studies 
represents a radical step forward in its inclusivity [5,95].

Currently, there are two randomized control trials (RCTs) of treatment for DID and OSDD, 
one completed [96] and one ongoing [97]. Both RCTs focus on Phase 1 “safety and 
stabilization” manualized interventions. The first RCT studied psychoeducational group 
therapy based on an abbreviated version of the Coping with Trauma-Related Dissociation 
manual [98]. In a randomized delayed-treatment design, the group treatment participants 
completed 20 of the 43 modules in this manual over 20 weeks (while continuing individual 
treatment as usual), and the control group continued individual treatment as usual alone [96]. 
Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in psychosocial functioning though 
did not differ from each other in outcomes during this time period. The group treatment 
participants also did not demonstrate improvements in PTSD or dissociative symptoms 
during this period. However, the group treatment participants demonstrated significantly 
greater improvements in psychosocial functioning at a six-month follow-up assessment, 
which may indicate better outcomes following this treatment in the longer-term [96].

A second RCT on Phase 1 stabilization treatment is currently underway focusing on the 
Finding Solid Ground program [5,97]. Participants are being randomized to complete the 
Finding Solid Ground intervention or a waitlist control. As described above, the Finding 
Solid Ground program consists of workbook-based educational modules and homework 
assignments, and in this RCT the program is implemented in individual therapy over

the course of a maximum of one year. Preliminary results indicate that the patients who 
participated in the Finding Solid Ground program showed greater reductions in dissociation 
compared to the waitlist controls [97]. This suggests Phase 1 treatment does successfully 
impact core features of DID/OSDD, though may require a longer time period (e.g., 1 year) 
to impact these symptoms.

The growing body of empirical work on DID treatment indicates a phased approach is 
effective, and individuals with DID can benefit from online adjunctive Phase 1 treatment. 
However, this research also demonstrates that despite years of treatment, impairments can 
remain for some individuals with DID. For example, at the 6-year follow-up assessments 
in the TOP DD naturalistic studies, a significant minority of patients still reported 
substantial relationship, employment, and health difficulties [92]. Relatedly, although the 
expert consensus phase-based model of DID treatment has been the standard treatment for 
decades, some argue that a more immediate trauma memory exposure-based processing 
would be beneficial, without an initial phase 1 stabilization treatment [99,100]. Empirically 
based treatments developed originally for other conditions have been put forth as possible 
treatments for DID with more immediate trauma memory exposure (e.g., [99,101]), although 
concerns have been expressed about further destabilizing these patients, who often struggle 
with suicidality and non-suicidal self-injury [102,103]. An RCT comparing a phased 
approach vs. more immediate trauma memory processing is needed to empirically determine 
the superiority of one approach over the other. These points taken together suggest there are 
many gaps in the empirical literature on DID treatment and clearly opportunities to further 
optimize treatment moving forward.

3.2.  Psychopharmacology

To date, there are no randomized, placebo controlled clinical trials of medications to treat 
DID; however, individuals with DID often are prescribed medications to treat the complex 
pattern of co-occurring, non-dissociative psychiatric symptoms that often accompany DID 
[10,104]. For example, in addition to experiencing symptoms of co-occurring PTSD, 
people with DID frequently experience depression, anxiety, disordered eating, problematic 
substance use, suicidal ideation, and self-injury [2]. Pharmacologic treatments for these 
symptoms are beyond the scope of this review. For reference, we refer the reader to several 
resources [10–12].

Our focus here is on a small body of work examining pharmacological treatments 
specifically targeting pathological dissociative symptoms. It is important to note there 
are no medications to treat the symptoms of identity alteration in DID. There are, 
however, medications targeting other dissociative experiences like depersonalization. These 
medications have been empirically studied in people with depersonalization-derealization 
disorder, borderline personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and PTSD. While 
individuals with DID might also benefit from these medications, this remains to be 
systematically evaluated.

In this section, we briefly overview three neuromodulatory and neurotransmitter systems 
that may play a role in generating dissociative experiences (see [105–107] for reviews, 
and [108] for recent discussion). We then end each section with medication studies

that demonstrate successful reductions in dissociative symptoms likely by targeting these 
neuromodulatory/neurotransmitter systems. Of note, studies here used various measures of 
pathological dissociation – often with a total score that did not differentiate between specific 
types of dissociation (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing etc.). Given 
this, we use the terminology of “dissociative symptoms” in this section in a general sense.

3.2.1.  Opioid System.—Growing evidence obtained across diagnoses suggests the 
opioid system may be important for experiences of dissociation. This neuromodulatory 
system modifies the impact of neurotransmitters [109]. Opioid peptides bind to opioid 
receptors that are expressed widely throughout the brain (e.g., mu, kappa, delta, nociception, 
zeta receptors) – with higher concentrations in the cortex, limbic regions and brain 
stem [110]. The opioid system participates in nociception, analgesia, stress responding, 
respiration, and gastrointestinal, endocrine and immune function [111]. A kappa-opioid 
receptor agonist, enadoline, increased feelings of depersonalization in a small sample of 
individuals with histories of substance abuse [112]. Salvia divinorum also is a kappa-opioid 
receptor agonist [113] linked to depersonalization experiences [114]. These two studies 
suggest the kappa-opioid receptor in particular may be a promising target for regulating 
dissociative experiences [105].

Medication studies focused on drugs that block the effect of opioids have shown some 
promise in reducing dissociative symptoms. One single blind placebo-controlled trial found 
the opiate antagonist, naloxone, reduced depersonalization symptoms in depersonalization 
disorder [115]. Longitudinal and case series studies of naltrexone and nalmefene in 
depersonalization disorder, borderline personality disorder, and PTSD also support opioid 
antagonist administration for reduced dissociative symptoms [116–119]. It may be that 
individuals with DID also experience reduced dissociative symptoms with administration 
of naloxone, naltrexone, or nalmefene though this approach has yet to be systematically 
studied.

While the results in particular of the Nuller and colleagues [115] randomized controlled 
trial are promising, other recent studies are conflicting. For example, neither naloxone 
nor naltrexone performed better than placebo for dissociative symptoms in randomized 
controlled trials in borderline personality disorder samples [120,121]. Moreover, recent 
double-blind crossover work demonstrated naloxone did not block the dissociative 
experiences linked to administration of the dissociogenic drug ketamine [122].

It is difficult to know what implications these findings have for the effectiveness of 
opioid antagonists in DID. It could be that the neurotransmitter cascades associated 
with dissociative experiences in borderline personality disorder or those associated with 
ketamine may be different than those involved with pathological dissociation in DID. 
Moreover, dosage, time course and design characteristics were significantly different 
across all studies, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions about the conditions in 
which opioid antagonists perform better than placebo for reducing dissociative experiences 
transdiagnostically.

3.2.2.  Serotonergic system—Some evidence suggests the serotonergic system may 
be important in the generation of dissociative symptoms. Serotonin binds to metabotropic 
G-protein-coupled 5-HT receptors and ionotropic 5-HT3 receptors expressed widely across 
the entire brain [123]. The serotonergic system is involved with affect, cognition, autonomic, 
appetitive, and motoric functioning, and perhaps more broadly in regulating arousal and 
behavioral activity [124]. Experimental partial agonism at serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C 
receptors induced a broad array of dissociative symptoms in individuals with social phobia, 
borderline personality disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder [125]. More recently, a 
pre-post, positron emission tomography study in an individual with dissociative amnesia 
showed that, as compared to pre-recovery levels, inhibitory HT1A receptor density was 
increased at frontal and temporal regions after recovery [126]. Given these findings, the 
serotonergic system may be a possible target for regulating dissociative experiences.

Medication studies focused on agents promoting serotonergic signaling have had mixed 
results regarding their impact on dissociative symptoms. One RCT demonstrated effective 
reduction of dissociative symptoms in PTSD using a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
(SSRI), paroxetine [127]. However, another randomized controlled trial showed that the 
SSRI fluoxetine did not perform better than placebo in reducing dissociative symptoms in 
depersonalization disorder [128]. Paroxetine may also be effective for reducing certain types 
of dissociative symptoms in DID, though this has yet to be evaluated empirically.

3.2.3  Glutamatergic system—Modest evidence suggests the glutamatergic system 
may be involved in dissociative experiences. This neurotransmitter acts through ionotropic 
AMPA, NMDA, kainite receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors [129]. Glutamate 
functions as an “on” switch throughout the central nervous system, acting as the primary 
excitatory signaling system involved in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity [129]. As 
discussed briefly above, ketamine is a dissociogenic drug [130,131] that acts on NMDA and 
opioid receptors [132], thus pointing toward a role for glutamate in dissociative experiences. 
Moreover, glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex positively correlated with 
dissociative symptoms in a borderline personality disorder sample [133]. These findings 
suggest the glutamatergic system may be a promising target for pharmacological regulation 
of dissociative experiences.

Medications acting to block glutamatergic signaling may be effective at reducing 
dissociative symptoms. However, research is presently limited, and findings are conflicting. 
For example, lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant that reduces the release of glutamate, and 
some evidence suggests administration of lamotrigine can reduce experimentally induced 
dissociative symptoms [134,135]. However, lamotrigine did not perform better than placebo 
to reduce dissociative symptoms in a RCT for depersonalization derealization disorder 
[136]. Of note, a trial of lamotrigine for dissociative symptoms which reported positive 
results was recently retracted [137]. Given the limited studies testing medications that 
inhibit glutamatergic signaling and its relationship to dissociative symptoms, it is difficult 
to say how lamotrigine or other glutamate antagonists would impact dissociation in DID. 
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a noninvasive method of measuring certain metabolites 
and neurotransmitters in the brain, including a proxy of glutamate [138,139]. Prior work 
suggests that neurometabolites measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy were

associated with variability in neurocognitive disorders, such as PTSD [140,141]. Magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy studies in DID could provide further understanding of glutamate’s 
role in dissociative experiences [108].

Only two medications have performed better than placebo for treatment of dissociative 
symptoms in RCTs: the opioid antagonist naloxone and the SSRI paroxetine. 
Pharmacological intervention studies for pathological dissociation symptoms in DID 
have not yet been conducted. Basic neuroscience studies of the neurotransmitter and 
neuromodulatory systems involved in distinct types of dissociative experiences would help 
elucidate future pharmacological targets for these experiences, and nascent attempts at this 
are underway [131,142].

3.3.  Summary

In summary, expert consensus guidelines and a small but growing body of empirical 
research supports a long-term phase oriented psychotherapeutic approach to treat DID. 
A novel, online, dissociation-specific Phase 1 intervention (and ongoing RCT) represents 
an exciting step forward in the broad dissemination and accessibility of DID treatment 
– especially given a mental healthcare landscape in which few treaters are familiar or 
experienced with treating DID. Moreover, while there are currently no pharmacological 
interventions specifically for DID, there are two types of medications showing promise for 
reducing dissociation in other conditions (e.g., opioid antagonists; paroxetine). It may be 
that these medications could impact dissociative experience in DID, though this remains 
to be empirically tested. There is an urgent need in the field for medication trials specific 
to DID given improper psychopharmacological treatment can have a disastrous impact in 
any psychiatric condition. A thorough understanding of the neurobiology of dissociation 
and DID is the key to propelling the next wave of both novel psychotherapeutic and 
psychopharmacological interventions for DID.

4.  Neurobiology of pathological dissociation and DID

To improve treatment leveraging neurobiology, we must first understand neurobiological 
mechanisms in DID. Here, we overview the systems-level neurobiology of pathological 
dissociation and DID to inform our discussion of treatment optimization.

While our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms in DID is limited, seminal work 
over the past two decades has begun to map out robust brain correlates of pathological 
dissociative symptoms. Much of our understanding draws from studies on the dissociative 
subtype of PTSD [105,143]. This landmark work led to inclusion of this subtype in the 
DSM-5 and built a foundation for understanding the more severe forms of trauma-related, 
pathological dissociative symptoms in DID [65]. First, we briefly describe the neurobiology 
of pathological depersonalization and derealization in the dissociative subtype of PTSD (for 
reviews see: [105,144]). Second, we cover recent neurobiological findings specific to DID 
(for recent reviews see [17,106]).

4.1.  Neurobiology of Trauma-related Depersonalization and Derealization.

Under typical circumstances, cortical structures like the ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFC) and limbic regions like the amygdala and periaqueductal grey have a balanced 
relationship and can influence the activity of the other flexibly based on need and context 
[145,146]. The amygdala helps to alert our attention to relevant or salient information in the 
environment so we can act adaptively (e.g., reacting quickly to a threat like a car swerving 
into your lane). The vmPFC facilitates emotion and arousal regulation by exerting “top 
down” control over limbic structures (e.g., managing feelings of frustration when on the 
phone with a customer service agent).

Evidence shows, however, that the balance of activity between the prefrontal cortex 
and limbic structures is disrupted for those who experience pathological dissociation. 
Specifically, depersonalization and derealization are related to an excess of cortical 
(e.g., vmPFC) inhibition exerted on limbic structures (e.g., amygdala) [105]. For 
example, prior work indicates that individuals with the dissociative subtype of PTSD 
have greater activity in regions associated with “top-down” regulation (e.g., prefrontal 
cortex) and diminished activity in limbic regions (e.g., amygdala) when presented with 
emotionally provocative autobiographical trauma-related scripts [147,148]. Similarly, greater 
activity in prefrontal cortex was associated with subjective feelings of dissociation 
(e.g., depersonalization/derealization) across various emotionally provocative tasks [147–
149]. Thus, depersonalization/derealization can be thought of in some contexts as the 
overmodulation of emotion/arousal or an excess of corticolimbic inhibition. Said plainly, 
the “brakes” on emotion/arousal are on “too tightly” in the brain.

In addition to excessive corticolimbic inhibition, pathological dissociation has also been 
linked to brain patterns associated with passive (as opposed to active) responses to threat. 
A small region in the brainstem, the periaqueductal grey, contributes to non-conscious 
emotion perception and reflexive behaviors aimed at helping to escape threatening situations 
[145,150]. Escape or defensive behaviors can be active and linked with hyperarousal (e.g., 
fight-or-flight) or they can be passive and associated with hypoarousal (e.g., unresponsive 
immobility, collapse, stillness). Dorsal and lateral regions of the periaqueductal grey are 
associated with sympathetic nervous system activation and active defense behaviors, while 
ventrolateral regions have been linked with parasympathetic activation and passive defense 
behaviors [151].

At rest, individuals who experienced prominent depersonalization and derealization 
(i.e., PTSD dissociative subtype) demonstrated increased functional connectivity between 
ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and cortical areas involved in threat detection compared 
to classic PTSD (minimal or no depersonalization/derealization) [152]. The PTSD 
dissociative subtype group also had increased functional connectivity between ventrolateral 
periaqueductal grey and areas linked to depersonalization experiences (e.g., temporal 
parietal junction, operculum). Thus, evidence suggests depersonalization/derealization is 
also facilitated by a rapid, unconscious, “bottom-up” threat detection that is wired toward 
passive defensive behaviors.

4.2  Neurobiology of DID

Page 15

Similar to studies on the dissociative subtype of PTSD, research focused specifically on 
DID demonstrates a pattern of excess corticolimbic inhibition. Using the same paradigm as 
described above, individuals with DID were presented with autobiographical trauma-related 
scripts [153]. They listened to these scripts while experiencing two different dissociative 
self-states: one that felt numb, detached and as if trauma-related memories happened to 
“someone else” and one that felt hyperaroused as if trauma-related memories happened to 
them personally. When experiencing the dissociative self-state that felt numb, individuals 
with DID demonstrated greater activity in medial prefrontal cortex regions and less activity 
in limbic regions (e.g., amygdala, insula) [153]. Importantly, this evidence of corticolimbic 
inhibition firmly places DID along a continuum of posttraumatic adaptations with other 
trauma-related disorders like PTSD [65,154].

Recent machine learning research has begun to point toward patterns in brain structure 
and function that are specific to DID and distinguishable at the individual as opposed 
to group-level. Reinders and colleagues utilized a machine learning approach to predict 
whether someone had a diagnosis of DID (vs. no psychiatric diagnosis) based on measures 
of brain structure [155]. The supervised machine learning model was able to discriminate 
between diagnosis groups with relatively high accuracy (72% sensitivity, 74% specificity) 
[155]. Regions that predicted an individual’s membership in the DID group were widely 
distributed across the brain. Specifically, participants with DID had decreased grey and 
white matter volume across broad swaths of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., cingulate cortex and 
precentral gyrus), inferior parietal lobule, temporal lobe regions (e.g., fusiform gyrus), and 
occipital cortex. Further, participants with DID had greater grey matter volume in regions 
that have emerged as highly relevant for dissociation-related processes (e.g., periaqueductal 
grey, precuneus).

Additionally, our group used machine learning to link pathological dissociation symptoms in 
DID with hyperconnectivity (heighted communication) between brain networks involved 
in self-generated thought and executive functioning (i.e., default and central executive/
frontoparietal control network [156]. There is evidence to suggest that these networks 
synchronize to facilitate internally oriented, goal-directed cognition, that is, problem solving 
to accomplish one’s goals [156]. Our results suggest that various brain regions in the central 
executive and default mode networks are more likely to be active at the same time the 
more severe the pathological dissociative symptoms. Though speculative, this may imply 
a dominance of internally oriented, goal-directed cognition in individuals with elevated 
levels of dissociation. Given histories of interpersonal childhood abuse, individuals may 
have learned early on to rely on internal problem solving because caregivers were unreliable. 
In adulthood, however, this childhood adaptation represents a maladaptive integration and 
regulation of self-relevant internal mental processes.

In summary, pathological dissociative symptoms have been linked with excessive inhibition 
of limbic structures (e.g., amygdala) by cortical regions (e.g., vmPFC) and greater bottom-
up activity from regions such as the periaqueductal grey [152]. Studies of DID neurobiology, 
specifically, have identified several brain structures that may distinguish DID from control 
participants [155]. Furthermore, these brain structures overlap with neural networks whose

functional connectivity has been implicated in pathological dissociation, a marker of DID 
[156]. The machine learning studies in DID require replication; however, they provide a first 
step proof-of-concept toward brain-based diagnostic and symptom identification specific to 
DID.

Further elucidation of the neurobiological underpinnings of pathological dissociative 
symptoms and DID are essential to the optimization of treatment approaches. We believe the 
neurobiology of these experiences can be leveraged clinically to help reduce shame patients 
feel about these experiences, aid diagnosis, evaluate the efficacy of currently available 
treatments, monitor recovery, and develop novel interventions. Accordingly, we unpack all 
these possibilities in our expert opinion section.

5.  Conclusion

A strong body of evidence supports the validity of the DID diagnosis, its powerful 
relationship to chronic, early childhood maltreatment, and the effectiveness of phased, 
psychotherapeutic treatment. Currently, psychopharmacologic treatment in DID focuses on 
management of symptoms associated with commonly co-occurring conditions. However, 
a small body of research in other conditions suggests opiate antagonists and serotonergic 
medications may warrant study in DID samples. The goal for both psychotherapeutic and 
pharmacological treatment interventions is to gradually help individuals with DID gain 
a felt sense of agency and ownership over their internal experience and physical body. 
Neurobiological studies are beginning to map out robust brain correlates of DID symptoms. 
Given society’s growing acceptance of the reality of childhood trauma and its psychiatric 
sequalae, the time to leverage this new neurobiological understanding to optimize clinical 
treatment for DID is now.

6.  Expert Opinion

DID has long been one of the most stigmatized psychiatric disorders in the world. This 
controversy stems from both an individual and societal reluctance to accept the prevalence 
and impact of childhood abuse and neglect [65]. Unfortunately, this has stunted empirical 
research on DID and its treatment. It is a human right to have access to the benefits of 
research participation, especially research that develops and optimizes treatment [157]. As 
we emerge from a period concentrated on validating the existence of DID, we can now 
focus our efforts on optimizing treatment availability and efficacy. This is an exciting 
time, as the field is primed to make substantial strides in delivering high-quality, evidence-
based interventions to help ease the suffering of those living with DID. Here we focus 
on two essential areas to address in service of optimizing treatment outcomes in DID: 1) 
neuroscientifically informed treatment; and 2) the inclusion of lived experience voices.

6.1  Leveraging Neurobiology to Optimize DID Treatment

Neurobiological knowledge has already contributed meaningfully to our understanding of 
trauma-related dissociation and DID and is poised to inform promising new interventions. 
As with any other mental health condition, there are many ways in which neurobiology 
could enhance DID treatment, with the aspirational goal of a precision medicine approach.

Here, we highlight four areas in which neuroscience could be used to optimize DID 
treatment: 1) reducing shame; 2) aiding assessment; 3) providing novel interventional brain 
targets; and 4) guiding novel pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions.

First, psychoeducation around brain patterns in DID may help to de-shame the experience 
of trauma and DID [5]. For example, clinicians can educate patients about how subcortical 
areas of the brain can respond rapidly to a potential present-day threat in such a way 
that one is not able to prevent automatic passive defensive reactions [5]. This can help 
someone understand why they reacted a certain way despite knowing intellectually they 
wanted to react differently – for example, experiencing tonic immobility instead of running 
away or fighting back [5]. Critically, it may also be important to pair such brain-based 
psychoeducation with complementary discussion that these brain patterns can be changed 
over time. We emphasize this pairing for the following reason: a growing body of research 
on neuroscientific explanations for mental conditions demonstrates these explanations are 
sometimes associated with a perception that people have a reduced capacity to overcome, 
control, or recover from these symptoms (i.e., a worse prognosis; e.g., [158]). Pairing 
psychoeducation around brain patterns in DID with discussion that these brain patterns can 
be changed may help de-shame these experiences while avoiding the unintended negative 
prognostic perceptions – though this remains to be empirically tested in DID.

Second, neural signatures of pathological dissociation or DID can serve as objective 
biomarkers, leveraged to help assess for the presence and severity of these experiences. 
Relying solely on self-report and interview assessments of dissociation and DID means 
we are dependent on the participant’s awareness, willingness to disclose, and ability to 
articulate these difficult to express and stigmatized experiences. Objective biomarkers can 
provide novel ways to assess for the presence of pathological dissociative symptoms, and 
quantitative, objective ways to track clinically meaningful signals of recovery or relapse 
across time. For example, to progress to Phase 2 of DID treatment, levels of pathological 
dissociation must be decreased so that dissociative symptoms do not interfere with learning 
during trauma-processing [8]. One could measure brain markers of dissociation and their 
change over time to help identify patients with DID who are ready to progress from 
Phase 1 (stabilization/emotion regulation treatment) to Phase 2 (trauma-focused exposure 
interventions). These biomarkers also could be used to stratify patient samples based on 
pathological dissociation severity for future, gold-standard clinical trials. The machine 
learning based structural and functional neural “fingerprint” signatures of DID [155,156] 
are a first step toward precision medicine in this way. However, we have yet to track these 
signatures longitudinally in treatment. This is the critical next step in research that would 
inform what changes in the brain as people recover from DID. We then can target activity 
in these regions to enhance recovery with adjunctive novel neurofeedback, neuromodulatory, 
psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions. Ultimately, a neural signature 
of either DID, its dimensional symptoms or markers of recovery, could be used to predict 
treatment success. These neural signatures could also aid in optimal treatment selection 
based on the neural patterns present at baseline.

Third, we can develop novel neurofeedback or neuromodulatory interventions that directly 
target brain regions involved in dissociation or DID to help alleviate symptoms. For

example, interventions targeting the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala or the bottom-
up connectivity of the periaqueductal grey may be beneficial in addressing dissociative 
experiences. Fortunately, some interventions are beginning to target these very systems. 
Recent evidence points toward an effective neurofeedback intervention for PTSD that tracks 
amygdala activity [159]. Participants received real-time feedback about their amygdala 
activity and learned to down-regulate this activity in 15 training sessions over the course 
of two months. Compared to participants who did not receive amygdala neurofeedback, 
participants in the neurofeedback group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in 
PTSD symptoms [159]. While this neurofeedback intervention has yet to be evaluated in 
people with prominent pathological dissociation, it could be fruitful for learning how to 
down-regulate amygdala activity without using dissociative processes.

Finally, we can develop novel pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions for 
dissociation and DID that are neuroscientifically guided. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 
a non-invasive method of assessing certain brain chemicals and neurotransmitters, may offer 
one path toward development of novel pharmacologic interventions for DID [138–140]. For 
example, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize levels of glutamate or other 
metabolites may point toward pharmacologic targets to address core symptoms of DID.

In terms of neuroscientifically guided psychotherapeutic interventions, Deep Brain 
Reorienting and clinical hypnosis offer two promising examples [160,161]. Deep Brain 
Reorienting targets tension in the neck and face that occurs when humans orient to 
potential threats [160]. The orienting response is mediated by activity in the brainstem, 
including the periaqueductal grey [105,162]. Leveraging this neuroscientific understanding, 
the Deep Brain Reorienting intervention brings conscious awareness and attention toward 
this bodily response (i.e., tension in the neck and face) to help someone stay grounded 
in the face of present-day stressors. A recent RCT suggests this treatment is effective for 
reducing symptoms of PTSD [162], and theoretically could also be effective for dissociative 
symptoms – though this has yet to be examined.

Similarly, as discussed, DID is associated with hyperconnectivity in the central executive 
and default mode networks [156,163]. Clinical hypnosis is a psychotherapeutic intervention 
associated with reduced connectivity between the central executive and default mode 
networks in nonpsychiatric control participants [164]. Thus, the judicious application of 
clinical hypnosis may be valuable in addressing the observed hyperconnectivity of these 
two networks in DID [161]. Indeed, the scholarly literature on DID treatment points toward 
clinical hypnosis as an important and effective tool for treating DID, particularly in light of 
the role that high hypnotizability plays in its etiology (for review, see [53,165]).

Incorporating the neuroscience of DID into treatment through psychoeducation, as objective 
assessment markers, and with the development of novel neurofeedback, neuromodulatory, 
or psychotherapeutic interventions will be key for the next wave of DID treatment research. 
In addition, neurobiological understanding of symptoms and recovery could powerfully 
improve health outcomes for people with DID. With high rates of suicidal behaviors in 
DID, we cannot afford to ignore the power of leveraging neurobiological understanding in 
treatment – millions of human lives are at stake.

6.2  Prioritizing lived experience voices to enhance treatment outcomes

One other powerful way to improve health outcomes is to include those with lived 
experience in the design, planning, and interpretation of research investigations. The concept 
of Participatory Action Research is an established framework that accomplishes this goal by 
including those with lived experience as co-researchers, rather than simply subjects of study 
[166]. The mental health field is strengthened from the inclusion of participatory action 
research approaches and the associated centering of the lived experience voice through 
ensuring research is targeting outcomes aligned with the needs of the community [167–169]. 
Participatory action research also can help improve the experience of research participation, 
study retention, and facilitate effective dissemination of results. Moreover, inclusion of 
people with lived experience in the research process upends traditional hierarchies in 
scientific study that are embedded within systems, polices, practices and engrained beliefs 
that perpetuate stigmatization and exclusion [167].

DID research could benefit enormously from routine inclusion of the lived experience voice 
through a participatory action framework. As part of the TOP DD studies and research 
conducted at McLean Hospital, we have engaged individuals with DID to serve as advisors 
to our research programs. For example, individuals with DID provided invaluable feedback 
on the development and adaptation of the Phase 1 psychoeducational intervention Finding 
Solid Ground [93]. Their feedback led us to refine the psychoeducational material that was 
tested in the TOP DD Network study to the current version being tested in the RCT [93]. 
In addition to patient feedback providing valuable information about the pacing, order, and 
wording of the materials used in the study, patients who participated in the Network study 
reported that one of the valuable aspects of participating in the study was contributing to the 
development of an intervention that would benefit other dissociative individuals [170].

At McLean Hospital, as part of an organization-wide effort to destigmatize psychiatric 
illness, we engaged a group of individuals with DID to serve as an advisory group starting 
in 2016. The group recently was formalized as the Lived Experience Advisory Panel 
(LEAP), providing guidance and feedback on research study development, interpretation 
of results, and clinical programming development. Members have shared in prior work how 
participation in LEAP has provided a meaningful sense of community and an important shift 
in the power dynamic between the traditional roles of patients, researchers, and clinicians 
[169].

When contemplating the importance of grounding DID treatment in neurobiology, LEAP 
members stressed the power of a neurobiological understanding of DID to improve the 
emotional, physical, and mental health of people with DID (Figure 1). Knowing DID has 
robust neurobiological correlates validated and normalized their experience in a landscape of 
doubt from family, friends, and health care professionals. This objective knowledge served 
as a lifebuoy for some to hold onto over the course of treatment – serving to decrease 
self-blame, stigma and provide a greater sense of control. Continued neurobiological 
understanding of DID and treatments guided by this understanding would send a powerful, 
long overdue message counteracting stigma about DID.

6.3  Concluding thoughts and future perspectives

The current state of DID is similar to the state of PTSD in the 1970’s – highly stigmatized, 
misunderstood, underfunded, and understudied [14,65]. We hope that in five years’ time, 
research on DID will have identified neurobiological markers of recovery, begin to leverage 
that knowledge for treatment development and evaluation, and that the inclusion of the lived 
experience voice will become a standard expectation, not a novelty. With these powerful 
forces combined, we believe that the ground is fertile for the optimization of treatment and 
better health outcomes for people with DID. We believe the tide is already turning and 
encourage clinician scientists to approach funding agencies to support investigation of DID 
neurobiology and treatment.

Article Highlights

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a trauma-related psychiatric condition 
with well-characterized symptom profile

A rich literature of case histories, clinical examples, and empirical work 
affirm that DID is treatable

Medications frequently are used to manage co-occurring symptoms (e.g., 
posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety), but few agents are 
supported by research to target dissociative symptoms specifically

Recent advances in the neurobiological understanding of dissociation 
and DID can inform the development of novel psychotherapeutic and 
pharmacological interventions

Prioritizing the voices of those with lived experience in the development, 
implementation, and interpretation of research is essential in optimizing 
treatment outcomes
