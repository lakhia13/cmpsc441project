Abstract: The homeless drop out of treatment relatively frequently. Also, prevalence rates of 
personality disorders are much higher in the homeless group than in the general population. We 
hypothesize that when both variables coexist – homelessness and personality disorders – the 
possibility of treatment drop out grows. The aim of this study was to analyze the hypotheses, that 
is, to study how the existence of personality disorders affects the evolution of and permanence 
in treatment. One sample of homeless people in a therapeutic community (N = 89) was studied. 
The structured clinical interview for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 
(DSM-IV-TR) was administered and participants were asked to complete the Millon Clinical 
Multiaxial  Inventory-II  (MCMI-II).  Cluster  B  personality  disorders  (antisocial,  borderline, 
and narcissistic)  avoided  permanence in  the  treatment  process  while  cluster C disorders,  as 
dependent, favored adhesion to the treatment and improved the prognosis. Knowledge of these 
personality characteristics should be used to advocate for better services to support homeless 
people and prevent their dropping out before completing treatment.
Keywords: MCMI-II, abandonment, personality disorder, homeless

Homeless people are considered to be at the maximum level of social exclusion in 
a modern society. Homeless people make up one of the most vulnerable and disad-
vantaged social groups, living in the city streets and temporarily at shelters because 
of a chained, sudden, and traumatic rupture from family, social, and labor ties, and 
homelessness is associated with a low quality of life and with high physical and mental 
illness rates.1–7

Treatment drop out generates much concern among the working teams. In the case 
of the homeless, this occurs systematically. The way and mode in which they tackle their 
life, their lack of personal resources to face the situation, and their inertia, determines 
treatment abandonment, with higher levels than in other populations.8–10

Studies on withdrawal from treatment in people under addiction treatment have 
been done11–16 and these have analyzed the comorbidity between dropping out and 
personality disorders.17 The reviewed literature concludes that the presence of per-
sonality disorders makes the prognosis of the subjects more difficult; the presence of 
an associated psychopathology itself is a bad prognosis.18–20

A lower prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar and somatic disorders has been 
found  in  homeless  people21  than  in  the  general  population.  However,  other  mental 
pathologies, such as depression, alcohol and drug consumption, or personality dis-
orders22 have an important influence on the dropping out from treatment in homeless 
people.23  Moreover,  psychosocial  aspects,  such  as  the  return  of  contact  with  the

family or a history of use of services for homeless people, 
seem to have positive influence on the drop out rate.24,25

The  working  tools  we  have  for  these  disorders  are 
not likely to appear in clinical guidelines, as effective or 
probably effective treatments. Outcomes, despite the dif-
ferent  techniques  that  have  been  used,  are  limited.  Only 
the dialectic behavioral therapy (in the case of borderline 
disorder),26  cognitive  analytic  therapy27  or  the  exposure 
techniques  (in  the  case  of  avoidant/phobic  disorder) 
have shown some effectiveness.28 These days there is some 
research,  in  homeless  people,  on  the  use  of  community 
assertive treatment, with encouraging outcomes.29,30 With 
respect  to  complex,  state  of  the  art  treatments,  there  is 
some agreement that the coexistence of other pathologies 
or  “comorbidities”  hinders  the  optimal  resolution  and 
treatment of the problem, and this is also true in the case 
of the personality disorders.31–33

The first objective of this study was to establish if there 
is a relation between the personality disorders and the rate of 
drop out from treatment given the high rates of both factors 
in the homeless. The second objective was to identify the 
existence of personality disorders favoring social and labor 
reintegration in the homeless.

One secondary aim was to add to the discussion about 
the  relative  importance  establishing  the  most  efficient 
treatments  of  personality  disorders,  as  this  is  what  men-
tal  health  professionals  have  named  as  the  21st  century 
challenge  –  because  of  the  difficulty  of  approaching  the 
patient, because of the poor pharmacological results, and 
because of the great treatment abandonment rate, in people 
with  this  pathology.34–39 The  research  was  designed  as  a 
prospective  ex  post-facto  study  following  Montero’s  and 
León’s proposal.40

Method
Participants
The  sample  comprised  homeless  persons  (N  =  89)  who 
participated in a reintegration process in a public center in 
Zaragoza city. All participants were men older than 18 years. 
They were chosen from 97 people who participated in a rein-
tegration process, based on the following criteria: (a) being 
homeless;  (b)  voluntary  admission  at  the  center;  (c)  stay 
in the center longer than 2 months; and (d) remaining long 
enough to complete the study.

A minimum of 2 months in the center had been estab-
lished to get some adherence to the treatment. Evaluation was 
not done for the individuals who dropped out of treatment 
before 2 months.41

Assessment measures
The data that were recorded were the following:
–	 Sociodemographic variables: a semistructured interview 
was carried out, in which data were collected regarding 
age, marital status, and education.

–	 Homelessness-related variables: At the initial interview, 
data from the history were collected regarding the age of 
onset as a transient, reasons for that fact, and substances 
consumed.

–	 Personality  variables:  the  Millon  Clinical  Multiaxial 
Inventory-II42 was used. This was administered to people 
with more than 2 months in the center, trying to achieve 
the most truthful answers. The questionnaire consists of 
175 questions, with a true or false structure, which are 
answered  in  25–30  minutes. The  results  provide  rank-
ing  on  ten  basic  personality  scales  (schizoid,  avoidant/
phobic,  dependent,  histrionic,  narcissistic,  antisocial, 
aggressive/sadistic, compulsive, passive/aggressive, and 
self-defeating);  three  pathological  personality  scales 
(schizotypal,  borderline,  and  paranoid);  six  moderately 
severe clinical syndromes (anxiety, somatoform disorder, 
bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder, alcohol abuse, and 
drug abuse); and three high severity clinical syndromes 
(thought  disorder,  major  depression,  and  delusional 
disorder).

Treatment
The  treatment  for  all  of  the  participants  was:  individual 
and  group  cognitive-behavioral  psychotherapy,  and  labor 
instruction courses. The admission at the center was based 
upon interviews that determined the motivation to undergo 
a  treatment  process. The  participants  performed  activities 
at the center, and labor training was carried out externally 
at the end of the process. After the admission at the center, 
the average stay among the ones who completed the treat-
ment was 1 year. The treatment addressed personal aspects, 
mainly self-help and psychological advice, both individually 
and in a group. After the end of the process at the center, 
monitoring was done in an outpatient program, in a halfway 
house  for  6  months,  which  served  as  a  support  for  social 
reintegration.

Procedure
The prior user profile (previous history) was analyzed by a 
semistructured interview, in which mainly the sociodemo-
graphic data and the personal history of homelessness data 
were collected. The MCMI-II was administered and tabulated 
by the clinical psychologist of the center. For the purpose of

the study, the presence of personality disorder was considered 
when the score at the base-rate of the MCMI-II was more than 
84, according to the most conservative criteria of Wetzler.43
For data processing, the Statistical Package for the Social 
Science  (SPSS)  program  for Windows  in  its  15.0  version 
(IBM, Armonk,  NY,  USA)  was  used;  Unilateral  descrip-
tive (maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, and/
or  frequencies  and  percentages),  and  bilateral  correlation 
statistics  were  performed. The  chi  square  (×2)  tests  were 
used for the comparative study, and a P-value , 0.05 was 
considered significant.

Results
The mean age was 38.56, with range between 22 and 54 years 
old (Table 1). It was observed that the 21.3% (N = 19) of the 
subjects were younger than 30 years, 36.0% (N = 32) were 

Table 2 homelessness variables (N = 89)

between 30 and 39 years old, 34.8% (N = 31) were between 
40 and 49 years old; and 7.9% (N = 7) were older than 50 
years.

At the “marital status” section, we observed that 60.7% 
(N = 54) were single, which did not mean that they had not 
had previous partners, even, on some occasion, they had non-
recognized or without maintenance, biological children. We 
found that 36.0% of the study subjects had been married, but 
at the time of treatment, 19.1% (N = 17) were divorced, and 
16.9% (N = 15) were separated. Only a 3.3% (N = 3) had a 
partner at the time of study, and either were married (N = 1) 
or had a de facto partnership (N = 2). But the main result data 
was the number of people who had not established a settled 
relationship with a partner – the 36.0%, one of every three 
people in the study.

The analyses of the education level revealed a low level 
of education: 1.1% had not had the minimum schooling; and 
33.7% (N = 30) had obtained primary school certificate. A 
further 47.2% (N = 42) had completed the secondary obliga-
tory education or equivalent, before leaving school, mainly 
because of their incorporation to the labor market. Just 17.9% 
had  completed  studies  over  the  obligatory  ones;  of  these, 
11.2% (N = 10) had followed technical professional training, 
and 6.7% (N = 6) had a secondary school education. No one 
had reached the university level.

In  relation  to  the  age  at  which  they  became  transient 
(Table 2), 38.2% started before the age of 20 (N = 34); 32.6 % 
became transient between 20 and 29 (N = 29); 27% (N = 24) 
became transient between 30 and 39 and 2.2% (N = 2) were 
older than 40 years when they went out from home and into 
the street. The reasons why they went into the street (Table 2) 
were the following: 27% (N = 24) had addictions and prob-
lems with their family of origin, 14.6% (N = 13) reported 
divorce, 12.4% (N = 11) had labor problems and 9.0% (N = 8) 
had psychological problems. It was surprising that the family 
of origin–problems were the main cause of homelessness and

showed how early this phenomenon started. One of every four 
people placed addictions (alcohol, substances, gambling, etc) 
as their reason for becoming transient. The psychological and 
labor problems had lower presence as the trigger element for 
their pathway to the street.

Referring to adherence to treatment (Table 3), there were 
more people achieving reintegration, 62.9% (N = 56), than who 
abandoned the program, 37% (N = 33). Among those who reinte-
grated, we could differentiate: (a) labor reintegration (they found 
a job); (b) familiar reintegration (return with the family); and (c) 
social reintegration (perception of a financial benefit). Among 
those who abandoned the program, we differentiated between: 
(a) expulsion (because of disruptive behavior with themselves, 
with others, or with the team or the center); (b) voluntary resig-
nation (the person abandons the treatment voluntarily); (c) not 
getting through the trial period (abandoned before 2 months in

the program at the center); and (d) referral (management with 
other resources that best suited their needs).

Referring to the results of the MCMI-II42 (Table 4), it was 
observed  that  the Antisocial  (25.8%,  N  =  23),  Compulsive 
(22.5%, N = 20), Dependent (20.2%, N = 18), and Schizoid 
(19.1%, N = 17) disorders were the ones that obtained the high-
est scores, considering base rate . 84. We highlighted that there 
were subjects showing high scores in one or more subscales.

Considering this fact (Figure 1), it was noted that there 
were subjects in reintegration treatment for the homeless with 
no personality disorder (36.0% of the cases, N = 32), with 
one personality disorder (22.5%, N = 20), with two disorders 
(12.4%; N = 11), with three (10.1%; N = 9), and with four 
or more personality disorders (19.1%; N = 17).

Table  5  shows  the  means  and  standard  deviations  for 
the different scales of the MCMI-II among the participants 
who continued or abandoned the treatment process. Among 
the  people  who  abandoned,  higher  scores  were  observed 
in  all  the  scales,  except  for  the  Dependent,  Histrionic,  and 
Compulsive,  and  great  differences  were  highlighted  in  the 
Schizoid  and Antisocial  disorder  scales.  Nevertheless,  only 
the prognosis for Dependent disorder showed significant dif-
ference (P , 0.05).

The prevalence of personality disorders in the homeless 
is  shown  in Table  6.  Data  from  other  studies  with  similar 
samples were compared; they provided data from the general 
population and from clinical samples.44–46 On the personality 
limit scale only, the scores of our subjects were below the 
values of other samples. On the other pathological personality 
scales, and on the 10 basic scales, the scores obtained by our 
subjects were higher.

Reintegration  and  treatment  abandonment  were  com-
pared with respect to the presence of personality disorders 
(Figure 2). As it can be observed, suffering from an antisocial, 

aggressive,  compulsive  or  paranoid  personality  disorder 
seemed to be related to the treatment abandonment.

Personality disorders were analyzed in people dropping 
out of treatment (Figure 3). It was observed that the percent-
age of abandonment changed in relation to  the presence of 
certain types of personality disorders.

Borderline personality disorder or personality limit and 
passive disorder determined the treatment abandonment in 
100% of those patients. Others, such as antisocial personality 
disorder (92.8%), the aggressive personality disorder (87.5%) 
and  the  narcissist  personality  disorder  (85.7%)  were  poor 
prognostic factors. On the contrary, the dependent personality 
disorder and the self destructive (masochistic) disorder, with 
38.5% and the 40% respectively, had little specific importance 
in program abandonment.

Discussion and conclusion
In the study, a high prevalence of personality disorders was 
observed, well above the epidemiologic data found for the 
general  population.44  Homeless  people  had  great  physical

deterioration  but  also  and  mainly,  mental  deterioration,47 
with pathologies, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
being present.24,35,38,48–51 Likewise, the data corresponds with 
previous studies with similar characteristics.2,15,23,25,52–54

In the analysis of the sample age, two main facts stand 
out. On the one hand, the high number of young homeless 
subjects in the reintegration process; one of every five under 
study  was  younger  than  30-years-old,  which  indicated  an 
early beginning in the homelessness phenomenon. On the 
other hand, the low percentage of persons older than 50 years 
was surprising – just 7.9%. This could indicate a low interest 
of this group in the reintegration process due to deterioration 
suffered during their time on the streets and disenchantment 
with previous programs.55

In the marital status analysis, the number of people who 
had not established a settled relationship was remarkable – 
one  of  every  three. These  data  were  consistent  with  other 
studies.56,57

The examination of the relationship between the abandon-
ment of treatment and the personality disorders showed how the 
personality disorders of the B cluster, also named the dramatic 
or emotional disorders – antisocial, histrionic, borderline, and 
narcissistic  disorder  –  presented  the  worst  prognosis.58 This 
could be due to the presence of interpersonal problems in this 
group; people with these disorders are defined as poorly social-
ized subjects, with emotional imbalance and dependency.59–63
The disorders in cluster C: dependent, compulsive, and 
avoidant  personality  disorders  presented  a  lower  rate  of 
abandonment. Dependent disorder was observed to be a fac-
tor for good prognosis because of the high rate of reintegra-
tion achieved by the subjects with this disorder.64,65

On the other hand, we could not confirm that the disorders 
in the cluster A (schizoid, paranoid, and schizotypal) were 
determinant in the development of the therapeutic process 
of the person, despite the fact that the abandonment rate in 
this group was higher than the reintegration rate.

In synthesis, the personality disorders such as borderline, 
passive, antisocial,  aggresive and narcissistic, seemed to have 
specific importance in the outcomes of treatment processes 
in homeless people.

People with borderline personality disorder abandoned 
treatment, in all cases. This could be due to the characteristics 
of  the  disorder,  which  has  an  irregular  pattern  of  childish 
reaction and a nonequal development of different abilities, 
which  could  increase  the  chance  of  showing  inconsistent 
reactions; abandonment could be due to the low thresholds 
in the neuropsychological and psychochemical systems of 
these patients, which could also be responsible, in part, for 
their hyperactivity and their irritability.60,66

Another disorder that was associated with a high aban-
donment rate was antisocial disorder, which is characterized 
by a pattern of opposition and resistance attitudes towards 
the requests in social and labor situations. People with this 
disorder are irritable and have a low tolerance to frustration, 
and  make  continuous  claims  about  their  misfortune  and 
contempt for authority figures, which, no doubt, influenced 
continuance in the reintegration process.67

In the case of narcissistic disorder, abandonment could 
be related to the disorder characteristics: the arrogant sense 
of self-worth, the indifference to the welfare of others, and 
fraudulent  and  intimidating  social  ways.  Moreover,  those 
with this disorder underestimate others’ rules and opinions, 
which could make their therapeutic processes difficult.68

Otherwise, we had people with a dependent personality 
disorder,  which  seemed  to  favor  remaining  in  treatment. 
This  personality  style,  although  within  the  personality 
styles with interpersonal problems, aims to meet the needs 
of others; they take a passive position, letting others guide 
their lives. To protect themselves, dependents are subjugated 
quickly, hoping to avoid isolation, loneliness, and the horror 
of abandonment. These circumstances can be increased, in 
homeless people, by previous experiences.69 These features 
favored  adherence  to  the  treatment  processes,  where  even 
in the cases of abandonment, participants began, in a short 
space of time, treatment in other centers.

As a main conclusion and guideline for further research, 
we could consider the personality disorder suffered by the 
subject as a prognostic factor in his treatment, so reintegra-
tion processes and prevention strategies have to be clearly 
settled  taking  the  subject’s  personality  as  basic  element. 
Processes should be carried out in a different way, creating 
an individualized therapeutic process, which should favor a 
greater rate of reintegration in people who have a previous 
history of marginalization and years on the street, because

Personality disorders and treatment abandonment in the homeless

the personality disorders in each person seem to determine 
its prognosis. Our results indicated that standard treatment 
processes were not followed by some people in the sample, 
and this possibly could be avoided with more individualized 
work-directed plans in community assertive treatments,52,70,71 
and a new way of organizing homeless services.72,73

As  weaknesses  of  the  study,  we  note  that  although  the 
MCMI-II  is  a  widely  used  test  in  clinical  settings,  this  is 
considered  a  self-test,74  so  it  seems  necessary,  in  future 
research, to use other, complementary tests that address these 
circumstances.38 Furthermore, although the multiple diagnostic 
is an iatrogenic phenomenon linked to all personality disor-
ders and a clear sign of the difficulty of classification in these 
patients,75,76 the MCMI-II seemed to have a tendency to over 
diagnose, giving a high incidence of personality disorders,52,77 
which could have influenced the results found in this study.

However,  this  should  not  limit  the  usefulness  of  the 
MCMI-II in determining the possible presence of personality 
disorders, and it could be used to plan therapeutic aims and 
treatments, depending on the personality characteristics of 
the person.78 Contemplation of new therapeutic directions in 
work with personality disorders could lead to the achievement 
of optimized and proper treatment.79,80

Moreover,  the  size  of  the  sample  of  homeless  persons, 
although relevant from a clinical point of view, was relatively 
small  from  a  statistical  perspective. Therefore,  a  greater 
number of similar studies are required in order to identify the 
specific profile of personality disorders in homeless people.
Finally, evaluation was not finished in those who dropped 
out of treatment before 2 months, though it looks as though 
they  can  be  affected  by  personality  disorders  to  the  same 
or a greater extent than those who stayed in the process.41 
Future  research  should  highlight  personality  disorders  in 
these patients as well.
