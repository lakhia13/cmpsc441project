Aims: Pilot studies applying a humanoid robot (NAO), a pet robot (PARO) and a real
animal (DOG) in therapy sessions of patients with dementia in a nursing home and a day
care center.

Methods: In the nursing home, patients were assigned by living units, based on dementia
severity, to one of the three parallel therapeutic arms to compare: CONTROL, PARO and
NAO (Phase 1) and CONTROL, PARO, and DOG (Phase 2). In the day care center, all
patients received therapy with NAO (Phase 1) and PARO (Phase 2). Therapy sessions
were held 2 days per week during 3 months. Evaluation, at baseline and follow-up,
was carried out by blind raters using: the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), the Severe
Mini Mental State Examination (sMMSE), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE),
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Apathy Scale for Institutionalized Patients
with Dementia Nursing Home version (APADEM-NH), the Apathy Inventory (AI) and the
Quality of Life Scale (QUALID). Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and
non-parametric tests performed by a blinded investigator.

Results:
In the nursing home, 101 patients (Phase 1) and 110 patients (Phase 2)
were included. There were no signiﬁcant differences at baseline. The relevant changes
at follow-up were: (Phase 1) patients in the robot groups showed an improvement in
apathy; patients in NAO group showed a decline in cognition as measured by the
MMSE scores, but not the sMMSE; the robot groups showed no signiﬁcant changes
between them; (Phase 2) QUALID scores increased in the PARO group. In the day care
center, 20 patients (Phase 1) and 17 patients (Phase 2) were included. The main ﬁndings
were: (Phase 1) improvement in the NPI irritability and the NPI total score; (Phase 2) no
differences were observed at follow-up.

Introduction

Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, is expected to aﬀect
to 75.62 million people by 2030 and 135.46 million by
2050. The prevention and treatment of secondary causes
of dementia (hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deﬁciency, Lyme
disease, neurosyphillis. . . ) and the control of risk factors
(smoking, underactivity, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, lack of
education. . . ) may decrease the incidence (Prince et al., 2013).
Research focused on ﬁnding a cure for dementia is key, but
in the meantime, we must bear in mind that patients with
dementia need the most appropriate treatment. New drugs and
non-pharmacological treatments are currently being researched.
Animal-assisted therapy (AAT), the use of animals in therapy
sessions, is one such non-pharmacological tool currently under
investigation. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
published a protocol to study “AAT for people with serious
mental
illness” (Downes et al., 2013). In 2006, the British
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
published guidelines for people with dementia (Fairbairn, 2006)
and included AAT as an approach that may be considered a
non-pharmacological intervention for non-cognitive symptoms
and behavior. AAT seems to calm agitated behavior and has
positive eﬀects on the quality of social interaction and mood
disturbances, although no eﬀect was observed on cognitive
performance (Bernabei et al., 2013).The presence of an animal
involves an increase in the frequency and duration of visual
contact and smiles. Interaction with a real animal, rather than a
stuﬀed one, increases the frequency of verbalization. Studies have
shown a decrease in verbal aggression and agitation with reduced
behavior problems, although the need for drug treatment was not
changed. However, it has been observed that agitation increases
when therapy with animals was withdrawn. The eﬀect of animal
therapy was independent of the severity of the dementia (Filan
and Llewellyn-Jones, 2006).

However, AAT is not always possible. Animals are often
not allowed in nursing homes or day care centers, due to the
risk of injury to patients, staﬀ or visitors, the possibility of
allergic reactions, and the potential nuisance of cleaning up
after the animals. Patients or staﬀ may have undesired reactions
to animals, both negative (i.e., Fear) and overly positive (i.e.,
becoming too attached). Aggressive patients could frighten or
harm the animals. And the cost of animal care (space, time and
money) might exceed the beneﬁts of a few hours of therapy
per day.

Thus, the alternative of replacing real animals with animal-
shaped objects became an object of investigation (Nakajima et al.,
2001). In recent years, social robots have been also used as
reasonable substitutes for animals in therapy for people suﬀering
from dementia (Wada et al., 2008; Shibata, 2012).

Robots have less needs for space, time, or care. Their sensors
can respond to environmental changes (movements, sounds...)
simulating interaction with the patient. They can monitor
patients or be used in the therapy. Other potential beneﬁts of
therapy with robots are that there are no known adverse eﬀects,
specially trained personnel are not required and they can repeat
the script in the same way as many times as it is required.

Social robots in advanced dementia

In 2009, a systematic review examining the literature on the
eﬀects of assistive social robots in health care for the elderly,
especially in the role of providing companions for patients,
was published (Broekens et al., 2009). The main conclusions
were that most of the elderly people liked the robots and the
robots can improve: health (by lowering levels of stress and
increasing immune system response), mood (decreasing feelings
of loneliness) and communication (increasing it). Moreover, the
robots lessened the severity of dementia as measured by speciﬁc
scales in some studies.

Bemelmans et al reviewed the literature in 2012 and found that
the most of the studies reported positive eﬀects of companion-
type robots on (socio) psychological (e.g., mood, loneliness, and
social connections and communication) and physiological (e.g.,
stress reduction) parameters (Bemelmans et al., 2012).

In the present study, animals and robots were added into the
therapy sessions at a center for dementia patients. They were
employed just as any other tool the therapists might use, in order
to discover the potential eﬀect of the tool without changes in the
therapists’ actions, the session content or the environment of the
patients.

Objective

Pilot studies were carried out in order to test the eﬀect of
introducing a humanoid robot (NAO), a pet robot (PARO) and a
real trained animal (DOG) in the therapeutic sessions for patients
with dementia in relation to behavior changes, apathy and quality
of life.

In a nursing home, where institutionalized patients with
dementia are living in controlled conditions, the objective was to
compare the eﬀects of therapy sessions involving:
• (Phase 1) a humanoid robot (NAO), who is able to use
oral language (phrases previously recorded) and move like a
human; an animal-shaped robot (PARO), who does not use
oral language but sounds and moves like an animal; and with
conventional therapy (CONTROL).

• (Phase 2) a trained dog (DOG); an animal-shaped robot
(PARO), who has been used as reasonable substitute for
animals in therapy for people suﬀering from dementia; and
with conventional therapy (CONTROL).

In a day care center, where dementia patients attend for 8 h a day
approximately, the objective was to compare the baseline with the
follow-up eﬀects of therapy sessions involving the robots:
• (Phase 1) NAO and
• (Phase 2) PARO.

Materials and Methods

Patients
All dementia patients being cared for at the Alzheimer Center
Reina Sofía Foundation (ACRSF) (Olazarán et al., 2012), a public
nursing home and day care center, were invited to participate. All
the participants, and their legal guardians or families, received

information and signed an informed consent form approved by
the CIEN Foundation Ethical Committee. Inclusion criteria were
a diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia, being cared for at
ACRSF and possessing a signed consent form. Exclusion criteria
were: fear of the robot or dog and severe acute illness (requiring
hospitalization or intensive medical care).

Therapeutic Tools
The robots used in this study were:

PARO
A social robot with the appearance, movement and sounds of a
baby seal. It has programmable behavior and sensors for posture,
touch, sound, and light. Its eyes, which are big, black and with
long eyelashes, can open and close; it can also move its neck
(laterally and up-and-down), anterior ﬂippers and tail. Although
its movements are silent, it emits short and sharp squeals like
a real seal. It is very soft and white in color, with hard Velcro
covering the access to the mechanism (so it is not easy to access
it during therapy sessions). It cannot move forward or change its
sounds and weighs 2.7 kg.

NAO
A white humanoid robot, measuring 58 cm tall and weighing
4.3 kg. It has sensors for movement, touch, sonar, sound, and
vision. It can talk and sing. It has a robotic voice, but it is
possible to replace it with mp3 recordings of a child-like human
voice that is easier for patients to understand. It can move its
neck and arms, walk, or dance. Software was developed to allow
the robot to act out a script for therapy sessions. These scripts
included eﬀects like speech, music and movements. During the
therapy session, the therapist could control the activation of and
progression through the script using remote control software
installed in an Android device. The therapists were able to pause
the script, repeat sections of it, or jump to another section. It was
also possible to use this software to remotely operate the robot in
order to make it walk or move its head (Martin et al., 2013).

The animals used were dogs: two adult black Labrador
Retrievers. Both had received prior training for therapy. Each dog
participated in half of the sessions with each group. The therapists
received training prior to the sessions on the use of animals,
and the animals were allowed to adapt to the Center before
beginning the research activities. Therapists specially trained to
work with animals attended all the sessions with the dogs, in
order to monitor the course of therapy.

Otherwise, the tools used in the control group were the same
as in the other two groups. It was necessary to adapt certain
tools used in the sessions for its use with the robots and the dogs:
specially designed vests with pockets and Velcro were produced,
and ﬂash cards were laminated.

Design
Nursing Home
trial of parallel groups, randomized
A controlled clinical
by blocks (living units) and stratiﬁed by dementia severity,
comparing therapy with robots and dogs against standard care
was carried out.

One hundred ﬁfty six patients with dementia reside in the
ACRSF nursing home. All patients receive similar care, in terms
of: medical and custodial care, non-pharmacological therapy
and personalized nutrition, therapy programming, and physical
exercise. They live in similarly designed ﬂoors, with natural
lighting and large spaces tailored to their needs. Residents live
on diﬀerent ﬂoors or living units depending on the severity
of their dementia. The ﬂoors with patients of similar severity
were grouped by threes: three ﬂoors of patients with mild-
moderate dementia, three ﬂoors of patients with moderate-severe
dementia, and three ﬂoors of patients with severe dementia. For
each dementia severity group, each ﬂoor was randomly assigned
to one of the three therapies (randomization by blocks). All the
environmental conditions were controlled for, so that the speciﬁc
tool used by the therapist in the sessions was the only diﬀerence
in the sessions experienced by the diﬀerent therapy groups.

The study had 2 year-long phases, carried out during two
consecutive years (2012 and 2013), comparing two diﬀerent
therapies to each other and to
modalities of experimental
standard care. The therapies compared were:
• Phase 1: CONTROL, NAO (humanoid social robot), PARO

(animal-esque social robot).

• Phase 2: CONTROL, PARO (animal-esque robot), DOG (real

animal).

All the patients included were assigned to only one of the
three therapeutic groups, worked with only one tool (Control,
PARO, NAO, or DOG) and were evaluated before and after the
study sessions. Randomization was performed before the baseline
evaluations using a six-sided die.

Day Care Center
Forty people are cared for at the ACRSF day care center. A
pretest-posttest design was used, due to the small number of
participants and the inability to control the diﬀerences between
their medical and nursing care, routines and nutrition. All
patients participated in sessions with only one of the therapeutic
tools: NAO in the ﬁrst phase and PARO in the second.
Patients were divided by the therapists in two therapeutic groups
according to dementia severity: mild-moderate dementia and
moderate-severe dementia.

Therapy
The therapy sessions were performed 2 days a week during 3
months.

All therapeutic sessions were conducted by the same therapist,
with the same structure as the other therapeutic programs, at the
same time of day and for the same duration of time (30–40 min).
The therapists were certiﬁed occupational and physical
therapists, and neuropsychologists employed by the ACRSF.
They received instructions on the implementation and possible
uses of robots and animals as they had no previous expertise
in this area. The animal therapists and robot engineers did not
participate in the therapy; they only monitored the session from
one side of the room, out of the patients’ view. Session guides
were written and followed in every session.

Social robots in advanced dementia

The therapists used the same model of standard therapy,
introducing the experimental tools as one more element of the
therapy. It is important to note that the object of investigation
was the eﬀect of the speciﬁc tools, not the eﬀect of the therapy
itself, so the tools had to be used for the same purpose and in the
same way in the three therapeutic groups if possible. Only one
robot or dog was used in every session.

The patient interacted with the robots, the animals and the
therapists to perform several therapeutic activities, including:
identifying numbers, words, and colors using ﬂash cards;
practicing the use of everyday objects such as combs; sensory
stimulation exercises using diﬀerent textured fabrics. . .

The robots and the animals were wearing specially designed
vests with pockets and Velcro, in order to carry the objects used
in the sessions, and move from patient to patient.

All sessions had the same overall structure: greeting the
group, introduction, therapeutic exercises (cognitive or physical
therapy) and ending.

The introduction included the presentation of the target
tool, orientation activities (spatial,
temporal, and personal
orientation), and motivation to participate in the therapy
session.

Therapeutic exercises were small units of activities, focused
on the stimulation of memory, language, calculation, movement,
praxis, and the use of the diﬀerent senses. Activities involved
physical exercises, questions and answers, music, videos, and
manipulation or touching several objects. Between the exercises,
there were brief pauses to encourage the collaboration and
participation of all users.

At the end of the session, the therapists reviewed what the
group did with everyone, asked whether or not they liked
participating in the sessions, and lead the group in a farewell
song.

Group sessions were employed for patients with mild or
mild-moderate dementia, and individual sessions were used
with patients with moderate-severe and severe dementia. The
group sessions were conducted with 9–15 participants seated in a
circle with the therapist and the tools in the inside, moving from
patient to patient. In the individual sessions, the therapist was
sitting in front of the patient, at the same level, providing stimuli
one by one.

Sessions with four levels of diﬃculty were designed:

1. Mild diﬃculty level (performed with patients from the day
care center). An extensive cognitive session was designed,
and the therapist selected a diﬀerent part of the session each
day to avoid repetitiveness and the participants’ boredom.
The physical therapy session consisted of a complete set of
exercises involving head, neck and upper and lower limbs.
The robot was programmed to move faster, given the better
physical condition of the majority of the patients from the day
care center.

2. Mild-moderate level of diﬃculty. Three sessions were
designed: therapy with music, cognitive therapy and physical
therapy.

3. Moderate-severe diﬃculty level. Two sessions were designed:

cognitive therapy and physical therapy.

4. Severe diﬃculty level. One session was designed using
language stimulation, music, passive movement and sensory
stimuli.

All
therapy sessions were recorded on video for post-hoc
observational analysis. Two cameras with tripods were used and
were placed outside the circle formed by the patients. There were
several recording sessions previous to the start of the study to get
the patients and therapists used to its presence, thereby reducing
the Hawthorne eﬀect.

Assessments
Evaluation was carried out by blinded raters at baseline and
follow-up using the following validated scales:
• The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (Reisberg et al., 1982),

which was given by a neurologist,

• The Severe Mini Mental State Examination (sMMSE) (Harrell
et al., 2000; Buiza et al., 2011) and the Mini Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975; Lobo et al., 1999),
which were given by a neuropsychologist,

• The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Cummings et al.,
1994; Vilalta-Franch et al., 1999; Boada et al., 2005), the Apathy
Scale for Institutionalized Patients with Dementia Nursing
Home version (APADEM-NH) (Agüera-Ortiz et al., 2015),
which was used with patients in the nursing home only, and
the Apathy Inventory (AI) (Robert et al., 2002), which was
used with patients from the day care center only, and was given
by a psychiatrist,

• And the Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID)
(Weiner et al., 2000; Garre-Olmo et al., 2010), which was given
by a sociologist.

When the evaluations required interviewing the nursing staﬀ
about patient functioning, the raters interviewed the same staﬀ
members for each patient at baseline and follow up whenever
possible.

Medical

information was also collected for subsequent
analysis. The wash-out period between phases was 9 months long.

Data Analysis
Statistical analysis, apart from descriptive statistics, included
the Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney
tests
for comparisons, performed by a blinded researcher. Non-
parametric tests were used as the data did not meet
the
assumptions for use of parametric statistics. The statistical
analysis was done using Stata software (Stata©. Stata Corp.,
College Station, Texas, USA version: 15).

In the ﬁrst experimental phase, two people suﬀered acute
illnesses and did not complete the treatment. During the wash
out period, 31 additional people signed the consent forms, 12
patients died, nine people moved to other centers and one person
withdrew consent.

In the second experimental phase, three people did not
complete the treatment due to illnesses or absences from ACRSF
(Figure 1).

Nursing Home
Phase 1
In the ﬁrst phase, 101 patients with moderate/severe dementia
(GDS 4: 2%, GDS 5: 17%, GDS 6: 44% and GDS 7:37%), mean age
84.68 years old (range: 58–100 years), 88% of which were women,
were included.

Dementia diagnosis was: 84.2% Alzheimer disease, 10.9%
mixed dementia, 3% Parkinson’s disease dementia, 1% dementia
with Lewy bodies, 1% Frontotemporal dementia.

There were 38 people in the CONTROL group, 33 in the
PARO group and 30 in the NAO group. Evaluation showed no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups at baseline.

All groups showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in GDS
scores, indicating a decreased functional level (Fisher’s exact <
0.000) at follow-up.

Scores on QUALID, sMMSE, and NPI (total score) showed
no statistically signiﬁcant changes between groups at follow-up
(Figure 2).

In contrast, statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found
after treatment in MMSE scores (a signiﬁcant decrease in
the NAO group), APADEM-NH scores (both the PARO and the
NAO groups had signiﬁcant decreases in total score, and the
NAO group in cognitive inertia score), and several NPI items:
delusions (a signiﬁcant increase in the NAO group), apathy (a
signiﬁcant decrease in the NAO group) and irritability/lability
(a signiﬁcant increase in the PARO group) (Figures 3, 4 and
Table 1).

There were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the

NAO and PARO groups.

Phase 2
In the second phase, 110 patients with moderate/ severe dementia
(GDS 5: 22%, GDS 6: 30%, and GDS 7: 48%), mean age 84.7

FIGURE 1 | All patients whose families/guardians gave consent and who ﬁt inclusion/exclusion criteria were included. Therapy sessions: each group
worked only with a tool (conventional, PARO, NAO, or DOG) in the nursing home; in the day care center all participants worked with NAO in the ﬁrst phase, and PARO
in the second. Assessments were realized before and after the study sessions. The wash-out period allowed the entry of new participants. Randomization was carried
out before the study sessions only in the nursing home.

88.2% Alzheimer

There were 32 people in the CONTROL group, 42 in the
PARO group and 36 in the DOG group. Evaluation showed no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups at baseline, except on the
NPI irritability item (CONTROL group: 3.78 ± 3.3; PARO group:
2.14 ± 3.05; DOG group: 2.13 ± 3.28; p = 0.0215).

All groups showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase in GDS
scores, indicating a decreased functional level (Fisher’s exact <
0.000) at follow-up.

There were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in MMSE,
sMMSE, APADEM-NH, and Total NPI scores between groups
at follow-up (Figure 2).

On the contrary, statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
found after treatment in QUALID scores (a signiﬁcant increase
in the PARO group), and several NPI items: hallucinations
and irritability/lability (a signiﬁcant increase in the PARO and
the DOG groups vs. the CONTROL group than decreases),
disinhibition (a signiﬁcant increase in the PARO group vs. the
DOG group) and night-time behavior disturbances (a signiﬁcant
decrease in the PARO group vs. the DOG group) (Figure 4 and
Table 1).

Day Care Center
Phase 1
In phase 1, 20 patients with moderate/severe dementia, mean age
77.9 years (range: 68–87), 50% women, were included.

Dementia diagnosis was: 75% Alzheimer disease, 15% mixed
dementia, 5% Parkinson’s disease dementia, 5% dementia with
Lewy bodies.

After the sessions with NAO, follow-up evaluation showed:
an increase in GDS scores (changes from baseline to follow-up:
GDS 3:15–10%; GDS 4: 5% (no change); GDS 5: 40–30%; GDS 6:
25–30%; GDS 7: 15–25%). There were no statistically signiﬁcant
changes in sMMSE and MMSE scores.

Signiﬁcant decrease was seen in: NPI-irritability/lability scores

and total NPI scores (Figure 5 and Table 1).

Phase 2
In the second phase, 17 patients with moderate/ severe dementia,
mean age 79 years (range: 69–87), 58.8% women, were included.
Dementia diagnosis was: 82.4% Alzheimer disease and 17.6%

mixed dementia.

At follow-up, after sessions with PARO: GDS scores increased
(GDS 4:5.88–0%; GDS 5: 41.18% (no change); GDS 6: 35.29–
29.4%; GDS 7: 17.65–29.4%). There were no statistically
signiﬁcant changes in sMMSE and MMSE scores, or in any other
variable (Figure 5).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study, in one single center,
where an animal-esque robot, a humanoid robot and trained
therapy dogs were compared as potential tools for therapy for
people with dementia. These new tools were the only change
introduced to the patients by the intervention, because changes in
personnel and environment were carefully controlled for limiting
the eﬀect of possible confounding eﬀects.

In order to control for environmental factors, the regular
therapists performed the sessions, rather than new therapists
trained in the use of robots or dogs who would be unfamiliar to
the patients. However, while there are therapists who specialize in
animal therapy, there are currently no therapists who specialize
in therapy using robots. Additionally, while the application of
animal-esque robots in therapy targeted toward people with
dementia has been documented, to our knowledge this is the
ﬁrst time that the NAO robot has been used for this purpose.
Therefore, although some more training in AAT might have
improved the results, it might have also introduced a bias in favor

of the dog, because there is greater body of knowledge and more
training materials concerning AAT than robot assisted therapy.

The measures used were internationally validated scales which
have proven to be sensitive and speciﬁc measures of the target
symptoms. All evaluations were performed by professionals
trained in the use of the measures. The changes observed after
the introduction of these new tools aﬀected all of the investigated
variables:

Quality of life (QoL), measured with the QUALID scale,
was only studied in the nursing home groups. In the ﬁrst
phase no changes were observed, but
in the second one,
the group of patients who worked with the conventional
therapy showed improvement, while the group who worked
with the animal robot slightly worsened. In 2009 Tapus et al.
proposed a customized protocol for the use of social auxiliary
robots as tools to improve the QoL of people with dementia,

users suﬀering from cognitive changes related to aging and/or
Alzheimer’s disease (Tapus, 2009). A social robot, AIBO, was
used for 7 weeks with community-residing and institutionalized

FIGURE 4 | Mean change at follow-up in NPI scores, by item, for the three patients groups of Phase 1 and Phase 2. CONTROL (green), PARO (orange),
NAO (blue), and DOG (purple) (*): Statistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups at follow-up were observed. P not corrected <0.05. The scales are
represented on the vertical axis and the mean change in the units of measure of each scale is represented on the horizontal axis.

elderly and incapacitated patients. These patients showed
signiﬁcant improvements in QoL as measured by some health-
related QoL questionnaires (Kanamori et al., 2003). In contrast,
our study has barely shown signiﬁcant changes in QoL, with the
only change being a slight decrease in the QoL of patients in the
animal robot group.

Global deterioration scale and cognitive state (measured
the follow-up
with MMSE and sMMSE) worsened in all
evaluations as was expected in a progressive and degenerative
disease. Only one exception was observed: after the use of NAO,
in the nursing home, the sMMSE remained the same. In the
same group and experiment, a signiﬁcant decrease in the MMSE
score was observed. Although the MMSE and the sMMSE are
both screening scales for cognitive decline, the sMMSE is more
appropriate for people with moderate and severe dementia, such
as the people who participated in this program. A literature
review found that animal-assisted interventions with elderly
patients with dementia has a positive eﬀect on communication
and coping ability, but not on cognitive performance (Bernabei
et al., 2013). In 2008, an improvement in dementia patients’
cortical neuronal activity was observed using a 21-channel EEG

after the use of PARO (Wada et al., 2008). Several studies (Tapus
et al., 2009; Chan and Nejat, 2010; Fasola and Mataric, 2010)
describe the use of social robots as a tool for monitoring and
encouraging cognitive activities of the elderly and/or individuals
suﬀering from dementia as improving task performance and
reducing user frustration. Increased cortical neuronal activity or
greater motivation to perform and complete cognitive tasks could
lead to a better cognitive test outcome in social robots groups, but
in this study, changes between groups were not observed.

Twelve neuropsychiatric symptoms were analyzed via the
NPI, the APADEM-NH and the AI. Apathy is a prominent
symptom in dementia. The APADEM-NH scale, a tool developed
at the ACRSF, was used to measure apathy. The scale has the
advantage of accurately measuring apathy independently of the
patient’s degree of dementia or depression. As the APADEM-
NH is not suitable for people who are not living in a nursing
home, the AI was used in the day care center. The apathy
item of the NPI scale was additionally used to examine apathy.
In the nursing home, in the ﬁrst phase, statistically signiﬁcant
improvement was seen in the total scores on the APADEM-
NH of patients in both robot groups, and in the scores on

in the day care center group of
follow-up were

(*) Statistically signiﬁcant differences between the groups at

the apathy item of the NPI scale and the cognitive inertia
item of the APADEM-NH of patients in the NAO group.
This results replicate previous studies were, despite a lack of
methodological rigor, it is apparent that non-pharmacological
interventions have the potential to reduce apathy in dementia
(Brodaty and Burns, 2012). In the second phase, no statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in measures of apathy was found. An
explanation could be that apathy in institutionalized patients
with advanced dementia seems to increase in time (Wetzels et al.,
2010) and therapeutic interventions may have a window in mild
and moderate dementia, but not in advanced dementia (López
and Agüera-Ortiz, 2014). In the day care center, there was no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in apathy.

Analysis of the NPI scores of all patients in this study reveals
a random assortment of changes that were minimal at best.
Statistically signiﬁcant changes were observed in:
• The NAO group:

◦ Impairment in delusions and
◦ Improving in apathy (Phase 1 nursing home), total score
and irritability/lability (day care center)

in irritability/lability

• The PARO group:
◦ Impairment
(nursing home),
hallucinations (Phase 2 nursing home) and disinhibition
(vs. the DOG group)
◦ Improving in night-time behavior disturbances (vs. the
DOG group).
• The DOG group:

◦ Impairment in hallucinations, irritability/lability

Measures of irritability on the NPI item in the nursing home
groups at baseline for Phase 2 showed statistically signiﬁcant

diﬀerences between groups, which casts some doubt on the
signiﬁcance of the follow up results.

The changes observed in hallucinations and in the DOG
group were produced more by the improvement in the other
therapeutic groups, than by its impairment.

A decrease in agitation after the use of animal assisted
interventions has been described in the literature (Churchill et al.,
1999; Richeson, 2003; O’Neil et al., 2011; Bernabei et al., 2013),
as a decrease in behavioral symptoms after the use of a therapy
dog during the day time hours (p < 0.05) with no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences during the evening hours (McCabe et al., 2002).
Behavioral improvement, as deﬁned by a reduction in anxiety
and aggressiveness, has also been previously reported after the use
of PARO (Shibata and Coughlin, 2014). These previous ﬁndings
were not replicated in this study.

Limitations

The study was designed in order to minimize any potential
biases: 3 months of therapy were used in order to decrease the
novelty eﬀect, the raters and statistician were blinded, several
recording sessions were held before the study began to get
the patients and therapists used to the presence of the camera
and decrease the Hawthorne eﬀect, interaction between ACRSF
regular caregivers and the robots and dogs was avoided to reduce
potential informant bias, and while active participation in the
therapy sessions was encouraged in order to decrease selection
bias patients were not forced to interact with the therapist or the
tools.

Throughout the study, several participants left the center or
unit or died, and several patients joined the study late. Most

of these changes did not occur during the interventions. Some
participants were only evaluated once, due to hospitalization,
illness or absence from the center: only 1.6% of participants were
lost to follow up in the ﬁrst year and 2.3% in the second.

This study was a pilot study in a sample, not representative of
the general population, with a low number of participants. The
changes after the use of the three new tools were minimal, and
some of the statistical signiﬁcant changes may be false positives,
due to the high number of comparisons made and to the relatively
small sample sizes. It is not possible to conclusively state that
these tools were the cause of the changes seen, because of several
possible confounding factors (i.e., diﬀerences in participants’
pharmacologic regimens or type of dementia). However, these
factors were controlled for, and will be investigated in future
research.

In the nursing home, randomization was done by unit, not
by individual participant. Although individual randomization
would have been optimal,
it would have required moving
residents to diﬀerent units for the sessions and would have
introduced major changes in the daily routines and environments
of the participants. Additionally, the environments and the
characteristics of the individuals in units of the same dementia
level are very similar. Baseline evaluation showed no diﬀerence
between any of the nursing home groups on any of the measures
(except in irritability in the nursing home in Phase 2), indicating
that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between people who live in
diﬀerent units in the variables analyzed in this study.

Concluding Remarks

In a controlled pilot study of parallel groups in institutionalized
patients with moderate/severe dementia comparing 3 months of
assisted therapy with:
• A humanoid robot, an animal-shaped robot and conventional
therapy, the main ﬁndings were: a decrease in apathy in
the humanoid and animal shaped robot groups; increased
delusions in the group treated with the humanoid robot and
increased irritability in both robot groups; and a decrease
in the
in scores on the MMSE, but not
humanoid robot group. There were no statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the humanoid and animal shaped robot
groups.

therapy sessions

In a study of
for patients with
moderate/severe dementia cared for at a day care center,
participants showed improvements in irritability and global
neuropsychiatric symptoms after participating in sessions with
the humanoid robot, but not after sessions with the animal-
shaped robot.

Future Studies

Randomized controlled trials are needed with a larger amount of
patients, in order to better understand the eﬀects of robots and
dogs on the therapy of people with dementia.

Additionally, new scales that are internationally validated and
more sensitive and speciﬁc are needed, in order to detect the
slight changes in behavior, emotion and cognition that were
observed during the session but were not signiﬁcant enough to
appear in the analysis.

As a result of this study, our team is going to focus on the
use of humanoid robots in cognitive therapy for people with mild
dementia and in the use of pet robots for people with moderate
to severe dementia.
