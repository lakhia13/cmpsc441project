Abstract

Current treatment strategies 
for control of trauma-associated 
symptoms of Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder (PTSD) have 
recently been updated by the 
Veterans Affairs (VA) and the 
Department of Defense (DoD, 
after over a decade of dedicated 
research. The most recent 
evidence is compelling that its 
use of trauma-focused therapies 
such as Cognitive Processing 
Therapy (CPT), Prolonged 
Exposure Therapy (PE), Eye 
Movement, Desensitization, 
and Restructuring (EMDR), 
and others with significant 
trauma focus are the current 
gold standard for treatment. 
Additional medication use may 
be of assistance in treatment 
of symptomology, with special 
avoidance of benzodiazepines 
or other sedative hypnotic 
medications which are causal 
of increased intrusive and 
dissociative symptoms over time. 

Introduction

In his early theories of the 
mind, Sigmund Freud hypothesized 
that the individual has stages of 
psychological development: that 
of forming an unconscious defense 
against pain and shock through 
the turning away from the triggers 
of unpleasure and finally the 
conscious disapproval of an impulse 

through use of judgement.1 Much 
of his early work focused on the 
traumatic shocks that his patients 
had endured through their lifetime; 
many of them through workplace 
accidents, loss of life or loved ones, 
involvement in war, and from 
sexual assault. Despite the efforts 
and work of many before and 
after him, those same traumatic 
experiences have historically elicited 
very similar reactions from those 
who have suffered through them 
and have so far, been difficult 
to appropriately treat. What we 
have known for some time is that 
trauma is no respecter of persons, 
status, or intellectual capacity, and 
that the after effects of trauma can 
significantly impair function in life. 

The Modern concept 
of post-Traumatic 
Stress disorder

The diagnosis of what is now 
accepted as Post Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) has changed 
over the years as we have gained a 
better understanding of the stress 
response and its longer-term impact 
on the body and the brain. During 
the Seven Years War (1756-1763) 
a physician from Austria, one 
Joseph Auenbrugger, observed and 
documented symptoms in some 
troops such as excessive physical 
exhaustion, anger, and irritability 
(angst), and depressed mood. He 
termed the condition “nostalgia”

The diagnosis of what is now accepted as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has changed over the years as we have 
gained a better understanding of the stress response and its longer-term impact on the body and the brain.

after the soldiers being so homesick, and so far distant 
from that which they knew, that their personality and 
the core of who they were was significantly changed. In 
his 1761 book Inventum Novem he wrote: 

“When young men who are still growing are forced to 

enter military service and thus lose all hope of returning 
safe and sound to their beloved homeland, they become 
sad, taciturn, listless, solitary, musing, full of sighs, and 
moans. Finally, these cease to pay attention and become 
indifferent to everything, which the maintenance of life 
requires of them. Neither medicaments, nor arguments, 
nor promises, nor threats of punishment are able to 
produce any improvement.” 2

Granted, the pharmacopeia of that generation was 

severely limited, ineffective for treatment of PTSD as 
it often included laudanum, strong spirits (such as rum 
and whiskey), and certain tinctures that were thought 
to improve the mood such as that of Saint Johns Wort, 
as well as other mild sedatives such as Chamomile and 
Valerian root. His observations though were valid, and 
matched those of the Greeks and Romans who also 

shared a history of documentation of similar symptoms 
among their returning troops. 

While war and violent conflict among nations may 
be historically well documented as a cause of profound 
emotional changes, it is by sheer number alone the 
civilian population that will carry the numerical 
burden of PTSD. By far the most common causes in 
triggering traumatic events among the entire populace 
are motor vehicle collisions and assault (inclusive of 
sexual assault and rape). These trauma experiences are 
fairly common in childhood, with adolescents between 
the ages of 14-17 having a 28% lifetime prevalence 
of sexual victimization with 8% of girls in that age 
cohort with a history of an attempted or completed 
rape against them.3 Approximately 6-7% of the adult 
population in the United States will at some point 
during their lifetime, meet the criteria for a diagnosis of 
PTSD.4 Amongst the U.S. military veteran population 
the variance in studies has ranged from approximately 
30% of the Vietnam era veterans to more recently 13-
14% of veterans serving in the dual wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan over the last 20 years.5,6

We also recognize that the self reporting of 

symptoms from these populations over the most recent 
conflicts is under represented due to fears of stigma 
and concerns over job loss, just as is speculated are 
the numbers from the general populace, who face 
the additional hurdle of potential lack of appropriate 
insurance coverage for appropriate albeit specialized 
treatments. Our primary care physicians are indeed ‘in 
the trenches’ so to speak when addressing mental health 
concerns of this same populace. Among the general 
population in 2010 approximately 20% of all primary 
care visits included treatment for mental health issues 
or diagnoses - making the primary care settings an 
important place to screen for and initiate mental health 
care.7 As all providers become more familiar with the 
diagnosis of PTSD and the current successful treatment 
options, educational barriers to initiation of care 
becomes less problematic – and those we serve can start 
care immediately while waiting on their referral to a 
mental health professional for continued care. 

Over the last two decades a wealth of research has 

been conducted on PTSD, driven primarily by the 
rising suicide completion rates and daily impairment to 
military members with that diagnosis. Funded mainly 
by the U.S. Governmental agencies these projects over 
the years have added to the medical knowledge and 
understanding of the brain, human behavior, the effects 
of persistent stress on the hypothylamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis system, stress change to the limbic-
amygdylar circuitry, as well as more effective treatment 
strategies. Past well thought of treatments have either 
passed the rigorous tests of double blind and placebo-
controlled studies and continue in use, or did not 
– and have been discounted. The amount of research 
was a boon to the mental health community, who at 
the time of late 1990s had only 15 controlled trials on 
treatment for PTSD to draw from.8  

The following decade brought great gains. A large 

meta-analysis in 2013 reviewed all available research 
on efficacy of treatments and interventions for PTSD, 
with a total of 112 non-duplicate studies included. 
This existing body of research was influential in the 
formation and updates to the VA and DoD clinical 
practice guidelines for assessment and treatment of 
PTSD in that same year.

diagnosis 

In 2013 the diagnosis itself received an update 
with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 

548 | 118:6 | November/December 2021 | Missouri Medicine

Disorders (DSM) – V and shifted from an anxiety 
disorder and into a new category of trauma associated 
disorders. This was in part done to provide an updated 
diagnosis representing the underlying pathology of 
the illness and to further differentiate it from anxiety 
and depressive disorders which it does share some 
symptomatology with. At present, to have a diagnosis 
of PTSD a person must have had a significant trauma 
exposure that has caused significant impairment to 
occupational and social function for greater than one 
month. 

Symptoms must include one intrusive (recurrent, 

involuntary, distressing memories and/or dreams, 
dissociative reactions such as flashbacks, intense or 
prolonged psychological distress to triggers, or marked 
physiological reactions to triggers); one avoidance 
symptom (avoidance of memories, feelings, or 
thoughts of trauma or avoidance of external reminders 
of trauma); two negative alterations to cognition 
or mood related to the trauma (dissociate amnesia, 
negative beliefs of self or the world, persistent negative 
emotional state, anhedonia, feelings of detachment 
or estrangement from others, inability to experience 
positive emotions); two symptoms of marked 
alterations in arousal and reactivity (irritability or 
anger outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behaviors, 
hyper vigilance, exaggerated startle response, problems 
with concentration, sleep disturbance). A provider 
may specify if there are persistent dissociative 
symptoms such as depersonalization (feeling detached 
from oneself, as if observing from out of body) 
or derealization (feelings of the unreality of the 
environment). Because of the prevalence of childhood 
trauma and differences in the brain and personality 
development of children at that age, specific criteria 
for children ages 6 and younger are also detailed in the 
DSM-V.9

non-pharmacologic Treatment for pTSd 

Shared Decision Making and Collaborative Care 
(Strong Recommendation for) 

Both are important early interventions which 
have been shown to improve patient-centered care and 
treatment outcomes. Review of the relevant diagnosis 
along with treatment options with consistent use of 
decision aids with patients has been shown to improve 
clinical outcomes, enhance psychoeducation on the 
diagnosis of PTSD, and reduce ambivalence in regards

to accepting the most efficacious treatment strategies.10 
In particular for the collaborative care model (inclusive 
of telehealth modalities to improve access), a stepwise 
treatment approach in the primary care setting has 
been shown to increase patient compliance with 
treatment and to potentially reduce the possibility of 
the patient stopping medication or therapy treatment 
too early.11  

Trauma-Focused Therapy as First Line Treatment 
for PTSD (Strong Recommendation for)

Prior to 2013 there was little evidence to suggest 

that there is a differentiation in treatment with 
pharmacotherapy versus psychotherapy. One of 
the larger changes to the updated clinical practice 
guidelines was to recommend therapy over medication 
for treatment of PTSD, to the recommendation 
now that manualized trauma focused therapies are 
the first line treatments. This change was a result of 
two large meta-analyses which did a head-to-head 
comparison between existing pharmacotherapy and 
manualized psychotherapy with a comparison of 
treatment outcomes. A manualized therapy is one in 
which the therapist or psychiatrist uses a guide manual 
to assist in care delivery, ensuring that all important 
trauma related topics are addressed. Use of a manual 
for trauma therapy is the gold standard for treatment 
delivery. It was noted in both that the psychotherapy 
alone presented a longer duration of symptom 
resolution with a reduction in risk of side effects from 
ongoing medication use amongst the studied patient 
populations.12 

In conjunction with specific positive research 

supporting use of manualized, trauma-focused 
therapies such as PE, EMDR, and CPT have shown 
consistent reduction of symptoms of PTSD with 
completion of 12-16, 60 minute weekly sessions.13,14,15 
While those three ‘main’ trauma therapies have been 
the foundation of trauma-focused therapy research, 
new subtypes of manualized focused therapy such 
as cognitive behavioral therapy for PTSD (CBT for 
PTSD), Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) and 
Written Exposure have also shown evidence to support 
their use in treatment.16,17,18, 19 All of the therapies 
that have shown the greatest treatment benefit have 
been individual therapy, not group. Recent research 
also highlights that therapy through video call is as 
effective as in person and is a cost effective first line 
treatment strategy.20 Use of a manual to guide and 

structure therapy with a patient has been shown in the 
above, and many more studies to improve outcomes 
– both in terms of adherence to and attendance in 
the treatment program, and in improved symptom 
reduction over time as compared to therapy that does 
not use a manualized approach. It in no way limits the 
therapist or reduces their expertise—in fact it has been 
shown to enhance it by providing a scaffolding that 
addresses all core issues of trauma is a systematic way, 
and provides for evidence-based work for the patient 
in treatment outside of the treatment sessions. Of the 
newer researched therapies, written exposure therapy 
has been showing excellent benefit with good treatment 
retention. Especially for people whose learning style 
may be more tactile or experiential, it allows for the 
patient’s written narrative with additional cognitive 
therapy to be the mechanism for improvement, 
rather than a verbal repeated retelling as in Prolonged 
Exposure therapy. 

The verbal with imagining retelling of the 
trauma experience as is performed in PE is effective, 
though described as difficulty at best, by the patient 
undergoing that type of therapy. Drop out rates 
from PE tend to be higher than that of other more 
cognitively-focused therapies such as CPT and EMDR. 
Written exposure therapy provides a mid point 
between the two with emerging data suggesting a much 
improved retention rate in therapy when compared to 
PE.

Pharmacotherapy as a Treatment for PTSD 
(Strong Recommendation for)
As based on the most relevant and recent research, the 
medications fluoxetine, venlafaxine, or paroxetine have 
shown the most benefit as monotherapy in treatment

of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomology. The 
relative benefits of use of the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or selective norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are that the side effect 
profiles are generally well tolerated. In clinical practice a 
psychiatrist will often switch to different SSRI or SNRI 
medications based on patient response, tolerability, 
or other issues of slow or rapid metabolism of those 
particular medications. Specifically, paroxetine is less 
prescribed as it tends to have greater anticholinergic 
side effect profiles than the other SSRIs and has an 
extremely short half-life often requiring twice daily 
dosing. Other medications such as des-venlafaxine 
and duloxetine are both acceptable alternatives, as 
is sertraline in the treatment of post traumatic stress 
disorder. Specifically noted Celexa and Lexapro in the 
research have a less significant impact on reduction of 
symptoms than these other medications.21

There is strong evidence for use of the following 

medications for treatment of PTSD:
•	 Fluoxetine, initial dose 10-20mg daily, response 

range 20-80mg daily.

•	 Paroxetine, initial dose 10-20mg daily, response 

•	

range 20-50mg daily.
Sertraline, initial dose 25-50mg daily, response 
range 50-200mg daily.

•	 Venlafaxine XR, initial dose 37.5mg daily, response 

range 75-225mg daily.

•	 Augmentation Strategies (Weak or Insufficient 

Evidence for)

Augmentation strategies (Weak or Insufficient 
Evidence for)

Augmentation strategies for treatment resistant 
comorbid symptomology can be done in conjunction 
with a primary SSRI or SSRI. The most studied of 
these medications include the short half-life alpha 
adrenergic antagonist prazosin for the treatment 
of PTSD associated nightmares and hyper arousal 
response, though recent research concluded that 
there was only weak evidence for use in some studies 
even in this limited capacity. Typical dose ranges for 
prazosin range from 1-12mg usually nightly, though 
some individuals may respond well to a split dosing 
regimen with a smaller morning dose and larger 
even dose. Another augmentation medication with 
weak evidence for use is mirtazepine, dosed to target 
reduction of sleep latency, improvement of sleep 
duration, and augmentation of the primary SSRI or 

550 | 118:6 | November/December 2021 | Missouri Medicine

SNRI in anxiolytic effects. As a nightly anxiolytic 
this medication not only improves sleep architecture 
but may reduce anxiety symptoms in as early as two 
to three weeks which can be a remarkable benefit to 
those who do respond well to it—especially those not 
with PTSD but with Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
or Panic Disorder, with or without Agoraphobia. 
It is also important to note that all medications 
targeting reduction of anxiety symptoms tend to 
assist in reduction of the active anxiety components 
of PTSD rather than decreasing the avoidant and 
negative symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. 
This again leaves therapy is the primary choice a first 
line treatments in that it can address all aspects of 
symptomology.

Weak or insufficient evidence for augmentation 

with:
•	 Prazosin, for reduction of nightmares/hyper 

arousal symptoms

•	 Mirtazapine, for augmentation with an SSRI or 

SNRI and sleep benefit for PTSD

•	 PTSD Non-Advised Treatments

Given the amount of research conducted over 
the last two decades, and the interest in PTSD as a 
diagnosis due to the active military conflicts over that 
same time period, many medications have also been 
studied. Of particular note, benzodiazepines have been 
found to carry a ‘strong against’ use recommendation. 
In some studies that class of medications carries an 
‘X’ recommendation as well due to evidence that 
they cause harm with long term use with a diagnosis 
of PTSD. This is thought to be due to the strong 
sedative, addictive, and dissociative properties of the 
benzodiazepines (sedative hypnotics) when used to 
attempt to treat a condition in which dissociation 
and hypnotic sedation fosters trauma reliving 
intrusive symptoms which in turn worsened avoidant 
symptoms of PTSD. That said, acute or emergent use 
of benzodiazepines for reduction of imminent risk 
aggression in an emergency room or inpatient setting, 
or to treat seizures or alcohol withdrawals is medically 
indicated and does not worsen outcome of PTSD 
symptoms. Other medications studied included all 
anti-convulsants, which are often used in psychiatry 
as mood stabilizers to treat both subtypes of bipolar 
disorder, and many typical and atypical antipsychotic 
medications which have been shown to be of benefit 
in treatment resistant major depressive disorders, in 
psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and also in 
bipolar disorders.

Additional procedures that have been effective in 

other areas of psychiatry were also well researched. 
While Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and the 
newer repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(rTMS) are effective for treatment of severe major 
depressive disorder and bipolar disorders, there was 
no conclusive evidence that they effectively were able 
to reduce symptoms in PTSD as did on those primary 
mood disorders. Additional procedures showed 
benefit to a small subset of patients but those findings 
were not generalizable to a broad population base. 
The following have been found to not be 
recommended for use in treatment of PTSD:
•	 Risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, and other 

atypical antipsychotics

•	 Divalproex, tiagabine, guanfacine, ketamine, 

hydorcortisone, D-cycloserine

•	 Benzodiazepines (Causes harm)
•	 Cannabis or cannabinoids

There was insufficient evidence to support use of 

the following procedures for treatment of PTSD:
•	 Electroconvulsive Therapy Repetitive Transcranial 

Magnetic Stimulation
•	 Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
•	
Stellate Ganglion Block
•	 Vagal Nerve Stimulation

Summary

There has been a wealth of new and updated 
research into PTSD and its treatment over the last 
15 years. Out of the many treatments researched, 
the trauma-focused therapies, delivered individually, 
with use of a manual by the therapist showed the 
most benefit in treatment. While very effective the 
patient may be limited by access to a therapist who 
has been trained in trauma-focused therapy, who may 
not wish to use a manualized treatment approach, 
or by cost and/or insurance coverage. More research 
needs to be conducted to directly discover and 
address the reasons underlying the lack of broader 
availability of manualized trauma focused therapy by 
therapists.  For those desiring such, or in the absence 
of good access to trauma focused therapy there is also 
strong evidence for use of SSRIs and SNRIs such as 
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine, 
and at appropriate doses will assist with symptom 
reduction.
