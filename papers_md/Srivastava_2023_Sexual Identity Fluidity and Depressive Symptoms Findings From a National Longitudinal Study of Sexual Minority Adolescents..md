Abstract

Purpose:  Sexual minority adolescents (SMA) consistently report elevated risk of mental health 
symptoms, including depression. Sexual identities may change over time (referred as sexual 
identity fluidity), particularly during adolescence. This study examined the effect of sexual 
identity fluidity on depressive symptoms over time.

Methods:  National longitudinal data were analyzed from SMA aged 14–17 years (N = 1,077) 
in the Adolescent Stress Experiences over Time Study (ASETS) during an 18-month period. 
Multigroup time-varying covariate latent growth models were employed to examine the effect of 
sexual identity fluidity on depressive symptoms.

Results:  In the sample, 40% of SMAs reported at least one change in sexual identity during an 
18-month period. Cisgender females reported sexual identity fluidity at a higher rate than their 
male counterparts (46.9% vs. 26.6%, respectively). In our first model (total sample), a change in 
sexual identity was associated with reporting fewer depressive symptoms (b = −0.591, p = .004). 
In our multigroup model (by sex assigned at birth), a change in sexual identity was significantly 
associated with reporting fewer depressive symptoms among cisgender females (b = −0.591, 
p < .01). However, there was no significant effect found among cisgender males. The models 
controlled for age and race/ethnicity.

Conclusion:  The results add to the limited knowledge on the complex relationship between 
sexual identity fluidity and mental health risks over time among adolescents. Our results indicate 
that sexual identity development and change processes differ between cisgender females and 
males. The nuances associated with these sexual identity processes need further investigation.

Introduction

Adolescents who identify as a sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual) 
consistently report higher rates of mental health problems, including depression, compared 
to heterosexual youth [1,2]. Meta-analytic work reported significantly higher rates of 
depression symptoms (standardized mean difference, d = .33) among sexual minority 
adolescents (SMA) compared to their heterosexual peers [2]. Although SMA are at risk 
of multiple mental health problems, depressive symptoms are particularly relevant [3]. 
Depression occurs at an increasing rate during adolescence [4] and can have harmful effects 
on multiple developmental outcomes, including poor mental health and lower educational 
attainment in late adolescence and early adulthood [5–7]. In addition, the literature has 
suggested within-group heterogeneity in depressive symptoms such that some studies noted 
bisexual-identified individuals reported higher rates of depression compared to their gay and 
lesbian peers [8,9]. Hence, not only do SMA present heightened depressive symptoms, but 
these rates of depression also vary across sexual identities.

Complicating our understanding of the relationship between sexual identity1 and health 
patterns among SMA is a recognition that sexual identities are not immutable, and thus, may 
change over time, referred as sexual identity fluidity [10–12]. Sexual identity development 
is a natural part of adolescent development [13,14]; some adolescents report consistency 
in their sexual identity over time, while others report fluidity in sexual identity [10–12]. 
For example, a recent systematic review found that estimates of sexual fluidity during 
adolescence and young adulthood ranged from 6% to 30% across probability samples in 
the United States, Australia, Croatia, and New Zealand [15]. Although studies have reported 
on fluidity in sexual attraction over time [16,17], few have reported on fluidity in sexual 
identities [12,18]. One longitudinal study with 156 sexual minority youth noted that 72% of 
participants reported consistent identities over time, whereas 17% reported changing their 
identities from bisexual to gay or lesbian [19].

Cisgender women have been found to be more likely to report a change in sexual identity 
compared to men over time [15,20,21]. A recent systematic review reported that sexual 
identity change was somewhat more common among cisgender women than men [22]. Some 
differences in sexual identification and change by sex assigned at birth could be associated 
with stricter notions of masculinity and variation in sexual identity development trajectories 

1‘Sexual identity’ is here defined as cognitive and emotional understandings of one’s sexuality, and how one makes meaningful 
sense of sexuality, both personally and socially. This differs from ‘sexual orientation’ which is related to physiological predisposition 
towards patterns of sexual and romantic thoughts, behaviors, and attraction towards member of same-, opposite-, both-, or neither sex.

[22–24]. For example, some evidence suggests that cisgender men typically describe their 
sexuality as continuous and unchanging; however, cisgender women often describe it as 
more fluid, evolving, and contextual [25–27].

Given the established relationship between identity and behavioral health [1,2,8,9], fluidity 
in sexual identity may have implications for mental health. However, whether these changes 
result in positive or negative health patterns over time remains unclear. On one hand, sexual 
identity fluidity may represent a stressful experience as individuals experience a shift in 
their identity [12,28,29]. For example, social identity theory suggests that because identity 
is in part derived from membership in a certain group [30,31], experiencing the loss of 
support from one identity group during a shift in identity would be detrimental to health 
by disrupting self-relevant schemas and social support networks [29,32]. This stress is even 
heightened when one adopts a more stigmatized identity, especially, a plurisexual identity 
(i.e., bisexual, pansexual, queer) compared to monosexual (gay, lesbian) or heterosexual 
identity. Some support for this exists; two studies found that shifts in sexual identity toward 
a more same-sex orientation amd away from heterosexual orientation were associated with 
increased depressive symptoms [33, 34]. On the other hand, a shift toward an identity 
that is more authentic and congruent may act as a protective factor, mitigating stress. The 
sexual minority stress model [35] has argued this point, suggesting that identity integration 
is related to self-acceptance and diminishment of internalized homophobia, wherein an 
individual’s acceptance of and pride in their sexual identity may help in coping with 
stressors. However, another consideration to make is the importance of safety in determining 
one’s ability to adopt, explore or disclose one’s sexual identity [36]. For example, if one 
feels safe and secure to explore one’s authentic self, or unsafe to adopt a more stigmatizing 
identity will impact the direction of this relationship between fluidity and mental health 
[36–38].

Current study

Given the importance of identity formation in healthy adolescent development, the present 
study examined fluidity in sexual identity and its association with depressive symptoms 
in a national longitudinal study of SMA. We asked the following research questions: (1) 
Does prevalence of fluidity in sexual identity differ by sex assigned at birth? (2) How is 
sexual identity fluidity related to depressive symptoms over time? Drawing from the existing 
literature, we hypothesized that fluidity in identity would likely be more commonly reported 
among cisgender females. For the second question, we want to understand if there is an 
association between sexual identity fluidity and depression, and if so, is the association 
positive or negative. Moreover, given some evidence on difference in sexual identity fluidity 
by sex assigned at birth, we explored if this relationship between fluidity and depressive 
symptoms over time may differ by sex assigned at birth.

Measures

rurality to purposefully recruit adolescents from across the United States and in urban 
and rural areas (2018–2022). A brief screener determined study eligibility (aged 14–17, 
identified as cisgender, provided a U.S.-based ZIP code, and reported a sexual attraction 
other than heterosexual or straight). Data come from Adolescent Stress Experiences over 
Time Study (ASETS), a parent study of SMA aimed at understanding experiences of sexual 
minority stress and behavioral health during adolescence. To ensure data integrity, several 
checks for fraud (e.g., duplicate email address or contact information, screening out on first 
attempt and re-entering with false responses to get through the screener), and data quality 
(e.g., unrealistic survey completion times, low validation scores based on attention check 
measures, or decline to answer numerous questions) were completed before respondents 
were included in the final baseline data. Participants considered to be nonfraudulent had 
the opportunity to refer up to three other adolescents to the study. All participants provided 
online assent prior to completing the survey. A total of 1,077 participants completed the 
baseline survey and were contacted for follow-up survey every 6 months. The current 
analyses used four time points (baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months). Participants 
received $15 for completing the baseline survey and could earn another $10 each for up to 
three people they referred to the study (respondent-driven sampling). Participants were paid 
incrementally for their participation in follow-up surveys. All study methods were approved 
by the authors’ university institutional review board.

Demographics.—Demographic characteristics (age, race and ethnicity, sex at birth, sexual 
orientation, and socioeconomic status) were assessed with items created by the authors. 
The race/ethnicity item had six response options (Native American, American Indian, 
or Alaska Native; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black or African American; White; Latino 
or Hispanic; and race and ethnicity not listed); respondents could choose all categories 
with which they identified. Participants who chose multiple racial/ethnic categories were 
coded as multiracial. For analytic purposes, this variable was collapsed into six categories 
(White; Latino or Hispanic; multiracial or multiethnic; Black or African American; Asian 
or Pacific Islander; and Native American, American Indian, or Alaska Native). To assess 
sex, participants were asked: “What was your sex assigned at birth?” Response options were 
“male” and “female.”

Sexual orientation or identity was assessed by asking an open-ended question: “What would 
you say is your sexual orientation or identity?” The research team used prior work with 
sexual identity variables, and a range of responses on this question to design a qualitative 
coding scheme. The responses were coded as gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, bisexual/
pansexual, multiple identities (e.g., gay pansexual, bisexual lesbian), queer, straight or 
mostly straight, asexual, and another identity (e.g., demisexual, agrosexual).

Fluidity in sexual identity.—Fluidity in sexual identity was measured as a reported 
change in sexual identity between two consecutive waves. A different identity reported 
between time point t and t + 1 was coded as 1, whereas reporting the same identity at time 
point t and t + 1 was coded as 0.

Depressive symptoms.—Symptoms of depression were measured using the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Short Form, which contains four items assessing 
the frequency of depression symptoms during the past week (“I felt depressed”; “I felt 
lonely”; “I had crying spells”; “I felt sad”). Participants responded on a Likert scale with 
response options ranging from 0 (rarely or none of the time [less than 1 day]) to 3 (most or 
all of the time [5–7 days]); scores were summed (0–12) [36]. Internal consistency reliability 
was high across waves (α = 0.83–0.85).

Analytic approach—Descriptive statistics is provided for demographic information, 
sexual identity, sexual identity grouping, fluidity, and direction of change (by groupings). 
Chi-square tests were run to explore differences in changes in sexual identity status and 
number of changes in identity by sex assigned at birth (male and female). To address the 
aims of the study, a multistep process was employed to examine the effect of sexual identity 
changes on depressive symptoms. A time-varying covariate latent growth model (Figure 1) 
was used to examine how changes in sexual identity influenced contemporaneous changes 
in depressive symptoms [37]. A taxonomy of models was tested to determine if the effect 
of sexual identity change was a stable effect (i.e., constrained to be equal over time) versus 
a varying effect (i.e., allowed to be estimated freely). In the next step, each time-varying 
covariate latent growth model was modeled in a multigroup analysis framework using sex 
assigned at birth (male [n = 331] and female [n = 684]) to examine if the difference in 
the effect of sexual identity changes on depressive symptoms varied by sex assigned at 
birth. The attrition rate in the study was recorded at 9.9% at 6-month, 12.2% at 12-month, 
and 15.2% at 18-month. Analyses were carried out in the structural equation modeling 
framework; the skewness and missing values of the outcome variables were addressed using 
a robust estimation method, maximum likelihood with robust standard errors in Mplus 8.0 
[38].

Results

Sample description

Table 1 contains demographic information. At baseline, the average age of the participants 
was 15.9 years (SD = 1.0); and 66.8% (n = 720) were cisgender females. In this sample, 
58% (n = 626) identified as White or Caucasian, followed by Latino or Hispanic (13.7%; n 
= 147), multiracial (10.3%; n = 111), Black or African American (9.4%; n = 90), Asian or 
Pacific Islander (6.7%; n = 72), and Native American, American Indian, or Alaska Native 
(2.9%; n = 31). In terms of sexual identity, 38.8% (n = 418) identified as gay or lesbian, 
followed by bisexual (33.5%; n = 361), pansexual (12.4%; n = 133), bisexual or pansexual 
(4.0%; n = 43), multiple identities (3.1%; n = 33), queer (2.7%; n = 29), questioning (1.7%; 
n = 18), asexual (1.6%; n = 16), mostly straight (1.3%; n = 14) and another identity (1.0%; n 
= 11).

Sexual identity fluidity

Around 40% of the sample (n = 401) reported at least one change in sexual identity across 
the four time points. In terms of number of changes, 23.0% (n = 228) reported one change, 
followed by two changes (13.9%; n = 138), and three changes (3.5%; n = 35).

In the chi-square analyses (Table 2), cisgender females were more likely to report at least 
one change in sexual identity (46.9% vs. 26.6%; χ2[1] = 36.9, p < .001), compared to 
cisgender males. Similarly, cisgender females were more likely to report a greater number of 
changes in sexual identity as compared to their counterparts: two and three changes (χ2[3] = 
38.1, p < .001).

Direction of change

We also examined direction of change in sexual identity from baseline to 18-month by 
identity grouping: monosexual (gay, lesbian), plurisexual (bisexual, pansexual, bisexual or 
pansexual, queer, and multiple identities), mostly straight, and another identity (including 
questioning). In our sample, at the baseline, 38.8% (n = 418) identified with a monosexual 
identity, 55.6% (n = 599) identified with a plurisexual identity, 1.3% (n = 14) with a 
mostly straight, and 4.3% (n = 46) with another identity. Among those who identified 
with a monosexual identity at baseline, 82.6% consistently identified with monosexual 
identity at 18-month, while 15.9% reported identified with plurisexual, 0.6% with mostly 
straight, and 0.9% with another identity. Among those who identified with a plurisexual 
identity at baseline, 82.5% consistently identified with plurisexual identity at 18-month, 
while 12.7% reported identified with monosexual, 1.2% with mostly straight, and 3.7% with 
another identity. Among those who identified as mostly straight at baseline, only 11.1% 
consistently identified with mostly straight identity at 18-month, while 77.8% identified 
with plurisexual and 11.1% with another identity. Similarly, among those who identified 
with another identity at baseline, 30.8% consistently identified with another identity at 18 
months, 25.6% identified with a monosexual and 43.6% with plurisexual identity (Table 3).

Effects of sexual identity fluidity on depressive symptoms

We tested both a linear and quadratic model for the growth curve of depressive symptoms, 
which indicated that the linear model (BIC =19426.41, CFI = 0.992, TLI = 0.99, and 
RMSEA = 0.04) was a better fit to the data than the quadratic model (BIC =19443.66, CFI = 
0.997, TLI = 0.982, and RMSEA = 0.06). In the next step covariate model, our model-fitting 
process resulted in a model where the effect of sexual identity fluidity was constrained to 
be equal over time in our time-varying covariate latent growth models. Fluidity in sexual 
identity was significantly associated with reporting fewer depressive symptoms (b = −0.616, 
SE = 0.22, p = .004). The model controlled for sex assigned at birth, age, and race/ethnicity 
(Model 1) (Table 4).

In the next step (Model 2, Table 3), we examined the difference in the effect of a sexual 
identity fluidity on depressive symptoms by sex assigned at birth. Sexual identity fluidity 
was significantly associated with reporting fewer depressive symptoms among cisgender 
females (b = −0.591, SE = 0.020, p < .01). However, there was no significant effect of sexual 
identity fluidity on depressive symptoms among cisgender males (b = −0.718, SE = 0.490, p 
= .15). The models controlled for age and race/ethnicity.

Discussion

Page 7

In our study, 40% of SMA reported fluidity in sexual identity across four points in an 
18-month period. This finding is consistent with the literature, wherein 28%–67% of sexual 
minority youth reported fluidity in sexual identity orientation over time [16,25,39]. The 
higher rate of sexual identity fluidity in our sample could be attributed to (a) utilizing 
only sexual minority adolescent sample, (b) prolonged assessment (18-months), and (c) 
measuring fluidity in reported sexual identity instead on a sexual orientation continuum 
(e.g., exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual) [10,12,15,28].

Regarding our first research question (i.e., whether the rate of fluidity in sexual identity 
differs by sex assigned at birth), we found significant difference in reported fluidity (change 
and number of changes) in sexual identity by sex assigned at birth. This supports our 
hypothesis that adolescents identified as female at birth are more likely to report a change 
in sexual identity compared to their male counterparts. As with prior research [15,20,21], 
in our study, cisgender females were more likely to report sexual identity fluidity compared 
to their male counterparts (46.9% vs. 26.6%). A difference was also found in number 
of changes, with cisgender females reporting a greater number of changes than cisgender 
males. This finding advances our understanding of how identification and labeling may vary 
by sex and supports evidence of sexual fluidity among cisgender females [15,20,21]. These 
lower rates among males could be associated with stricter notions of masculinity, social 
and cultural expectations regarding gender, and more negative attitudes toward gay men 
and homosexuality [23,24]; however, these differences and underlying factors are yet to be 
examined. Although the extant research suggests that sexual identity fluidity is somewhat 
more common among cisgender females than cisgender males, it is difficult to draw reliable 
conclusions about the cause of such differences by sex assigned at birth.

We found that fluidity in sexual identity was significantly associated with fewer depressive 
symptoms over time among SMA. The finding of a negative effect of changes in 
sexual identity on depressive symptoms points to the conflicting evidence on changes in 
sexual identity and mental health outcomes. For example, a study utilizing the National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data found that youth who reported 
changes in sexual identity (towards same-sex identities) were more likely to report an 
increase in depressive symptoms [33]; however, another study suggested that identity change 
toward greater identity integration was associated with decreased depressive symptoms [29]. 
This is in line with Meyer’s model of sexual minority stress, wherein he argued that identity 
integration is related to self-acceptance and a decline in internalized homophobia and may 
help people cope with stressors [34]. However, we believe these underlying mechanisms, 
like minority stress, exposure to community, and support, may drive this reported change, 
and there is a need to further investigate factors associated with fluidity, in order to 
better understand the processes of identity development among adolescents. In addition, 
in our multigroup model, we only found a significant effect of sexual identity fluidity on 
depressive symptoms for cisgender females and not for their male counterparts. However, it 
is important to note that there is a non-significant trend among cisgender males in the same 
direction as observed among cisgender females. The lack of statistical significance is likely

a product of lower statistical power due to smaller number of makes who reported change in 
their identity.

Additionally, we believe that future research is needed to further disintegrate fluidity to 
describe variations in more meaningful ways. Prior work on sexual identity/orientation 
fluidity and mental health included measures that captured sexual identity on continuum 
(exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual). Drawing from a continuum 
framework, studies were able to assess directionality of change (ex. away or towards 
same-sex identity), and present findings on how these directionality impacts mental 
health outcomes [33–34]. However, when utilizing measures on self-reported identities/
labels, it complicates our ability to determine directionality. Building on prior work, 
our findings, and changing landscape of sexual identity development, we believe, two 
important considerations should be made in future work. First, in absence of continuum 
framework, directionality may be measured by identifying changes based on stigmatizing 
groups, for example a change from monosexual (gay/lesbian) to a more stigmatized identity, 
like, plurisexual (bisexual, pansexual, queer). Second, research must contextualize identity 
development/ change in underlying mechanisms of safe disclosure and support [36–38]. 
For example, Diamond and Alley [36] in their recent work have argued the importance 
of insufficient social safety in one’s ability to identify or explore one’s authentic self. 
Understanding one’s ability to safely identify, disclose and adopt a sexual identity has 
important bearing on sexual identity fluidity and associated mental health outcomes.

The results of this study, particularly those regarding fluidity in identities, have important 
public health implications. First, findings challenge the traditional methods of gathering and 
using data on sexual identities. The study aimed to further our understanding of sexual 
identities in non-static ways by examining fluidity in identities over time. Methodological 
lessons from this study would be beneficial in informing measurement development to 
collect information on sexual identities in non-static and multidimensional ways. The 
results add to the limited knowledge on the complex relationship between sexual identity 
fluidity and mental health risks over time among adolescents. Future research with 
adolescents should be cautious of non-static development of sexual identities and understand 
adolescents’ needs related to experiences of sexual identity fluidity.

Limitations and conclusion

This study has several limitations. This study focused on cisgender youth; thus, it did 
not explore disparities experienced by transgender and gender nonbinary adolescents [40]. 
Internet survey research has distinct advantages, especially for reaching marginalized, 
geographically dispersed minority populations using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS, 
based on snowball method). We recruited a large sample of diverse SMA from urban 
and rural areas of the United States. However, internet-based recruitment and RDS also 
have limitations and challenges. In terms of generalizability, our findings are limited to 
adolescents who have access to the internet and online spaces, and limitation around 
representativeness since only those with connections to participants enrolled in the study 
could be invited to participate. Additionally, internet survey research also has validity 
concerns (e.g., duplicate participation). However, our study protocols addressed these

concerns through rigorous validity checks. All data were self-reported; however, anonymity 
was ensured by not collecting any identifying information, which minimized response 
bias. Fluidity in sexual identity were measured as a difference in response to sexual 
identity question between two points; however, this may not be a conscious change on 
the adolescent’s part. We have also presented descriptive information on direction of change 
by identity groupings, and we recognize in doing so, this may mask any variability within 
each of the identity groups (ex, bisexual and queer).

Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the relationship 
between sexual identity fluidity and mental health in a nationwide sample of SMA. 
Given pervasive homonegative climates in many areas, SMA will continue to experience 
sexual identity development in less supportive environments. The expanding evidence that 
sexual identity fluidity are associated with mental health outcomes is essential to how 
we understand sexual identity development among adolescents. Hence, the mechanisms 
underlying the fluidity in sexual identity and subsequent change in health outcomes need 
more exploration, along with research on variations by demographic variables including sex 
and gender.

IMPLICATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

This study examined effect of changes in sexual identity on depressive symptoms in a 
national sample of sexual minority adolescents. This is the first evidence of differences 
in the association between changes in identity and depression by sex assigned at birth. 
Findings can help support identity formation in healthy adolescent development.
