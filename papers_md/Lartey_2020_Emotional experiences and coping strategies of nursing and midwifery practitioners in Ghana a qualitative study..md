Abstract

Background: Emotional regulation forms an integral part of healthcare delivery. In the performance of the core
duties of nursing and midwifery, health professionals are expected to enhance occupationally/organisationally
required emotions. The purpose of this study is to explore.
The meaning nurses and midwives give to emotional labour as well as the coping resources employed by these
professionals in order to manage the emotional demands of their profession.
Method: A qualitative study was conducted using a semi-structured interview guide with fifteen (15) purposively
selected nurses and midwives. Interviews were recorded and simultaneously translated and transcribed. Thematic
analysis was used to analyse the data.
Results: Our findings showed that participants conceptualized emotional labour as display of rules. Sadness, abuse
and bullying, poor incentivisation, emotional exhaustion and emotional mix bag were reported by the participants
as emotional demands and deficits. Nurses and midwives coped with emotional labour through the use of five (5)
main resources: psychological capital, routinisation of emotions, religious resources, social support and job security.

Conclusion: Nursing and midwifery professional duties are accompanied with emotional regulations which tend to
have consequential effects on a myriad of work-related issues. Clinical healthcare training needs to intensify and
equip professionals with the skills of regulating and managing their emotions since managing emotional demands
are central to effective healthcare delivery.

Background
At the heart of nursing and midwifery service delivery
are emotional regulations and management [1, 2]. Thus,
the professional duties of nursing and midwifery are ac-
companied by diverse emotional situations including,
but not limited to, abuse by supervisors and clients,
sadness and chronic
death of clients which elicits

conditions of clients which are both physically and emo-
tionally demanding and therefore, leads to job burnout
[3–5]. Even though there exist various areas of emo-
tional
in professional
healthcare, emotional
labour has become one of the
areas of concern in recent emotional management litera-
ture [6], especially among nurses [7]. To explain emo-
tional labour, nurses and other health professionals, as
part of their job description, are expected to show posi-
tive and organizationally/occupationally desired emo-
tions especially, to clients [7]. Thus, the engagement in

emotional labour by nurses and midwives enable them
to maintain a cordial relationship with clients [5]. It
must be acknowledged that nurses and midwives experi-
ence a wider range of emotional situations including
anger, guilt, helplessness and others, regardless of con-
text [3, 8].

Extant literature has identified two broad strategies
employed by service workers including nurses in the
process of engaging in emotional labour; surface acting
and deep acting [9, 10]. That is when nurses encounter
emotional situations in their line of duties, they are ex-
pected to always show enough external positive emo-
tions
they are
internally not [7]. Surface acting has been explained as
the suppression of internally felt emotions with the pur-
pose of enhancing organizationally or occupationally de-
sired emotions [10, 11]. On the contrary, deep acting is
conceptualised as engaging in emotional expressions
which are consistent with internally felt emotions [9].

such as empathy and happiness

if

There is much evidence in support of the argument
that since surface acting requires suppression of internal
feelings, there exists an inner tension or emotional dis-
sonance when employees engage in surface acting [12–
15]. This, in turn, has a negative bearing on employee
work-related issues, including their job attitudes (job sat-
isfaction and organisational commitment) [16]. However,
the evidence in support of the consequential effects of
deep acting on employee job attitudes is inconclusive
[17–19]. Reasons for this have been pointed to the re-
search approach (mostly quantitative) and context [20].

There is, therefore, a need to employ a research ap-
proach which focuses on unearthing the inconsistencies
in the relationships between emotional labour and job
attitudes. Additionally, empirical studies on the subject
matter in the African context is at the embryonic stage
with most studies tailored towards exploring the nature
of emotional labour [7, 21]. In the same vein, theoretical
arguments in relation to the outcomes of emotional
labour are heavily based on the emotional labour theory
proposed by Grandey [13]. The present study provides a
new perspective and theoretical argument (job demand-
resources model) to gain an understanding of the out-
comes of emotional labour.

The present study is a follow-up to a previous study in
Ghana that revealed that while surface acting was signifi-
cantly related with job attitudes, deep acting did not
[14]. Furthermore, the same study showed that perceived
organisational support moderated the relationship be-
tween deep acting and job attitudes but did not play a
moderating role in the relationship between surface act-
ing and job attitudes [14]. Even though empirical studies
on emotional labour is emerging especially, in the Afri-
can context, a study among media practitioners in
Ghana asserted that emotional labour is conceptualised

as faking (pretense and emotional enhancement) [12].
The same study also reported that emotional
labour
(surface acting and deep acting) had an inconsistent re-
lationship with job attitudes and psychological health
[12]. Another study using hermeneutic phenomenology
found that clinical learning experience among nursing
students is heavily immersed with emotion-related situa-
tions and therefore, emotional labour forms a core part
of nursing learning experience [7]. The same study fur-
ther revealed that nursing requires engaging in varying
emotions due to caring encounters, death of patients as
well as caring-learning relationships expected to be har-
nessed during clinical nursing [7]. Due to the identified
gap in literature, the current study is to explore the rea-
sons for such discrepancies in the relationship between
emotional labour and job attitudes. To achieve this, we
adopted a different methodological approach-qualitative
method, and employed a different theoretical argument.

Theoretical underpinning
Grandey’s [13] conceptualization of emotional labour pro-
vides much theoretical foundation to the present study.
Grandey [13] argues that in line with displaying required
emotions at work, employees,
including health profes-
sionals, engage in either surface acting (hiding or faking
felt emotions) or deep acting (try to experience the desired
emotions). The engagement in surface acting or deep act-
ing is anticipated to have impact on employee work-
related attitudes and outcomes. Besides, theoretical argu-
ments from the job demand-resource model postulate that
work environment is associated with demands which tap
into the physical, emotional, psychological and other re-
sources of the individual [22, 23]. The demanding nature
of work mostly have negative consequences on work-
related factors including, but not limited to, job attitudes,
job performance and job outcomes [22, 23]. Employees
therefore fall on diverse resources available at work in
order to manage and cope with such demanding nature of
work [22, 23] The availability and extent of these re-
sources play a significant role in determining the conse-
quences of the work demands on work-related factors
including job attitudes [23, 24].

On the basis of the theoretical models, the present
study was interested in exploring the following ques-
tions: 1) how do nurses and midwives conceptualize
emotional labour?; 2) what are the emotional demands
of their work?; and 3) what are the coping resources
nurses and midwives adopt in managing the emotional
demands of their work?

Methods
Philosophical orientation
The underlying philosophy to the present study is the
interpretivism (constructivism) which emanates from the

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92 

Page 3 of 12

idealism perspective [25]. Although many grades of con-
structivism exists [26], they all share three main features
postulated by Lincoln and colleagues [27], a relativist
ontology a subjectivist epistemology, and naturalistic
methodological procedures Relativist ontology implies
there is no single reality; instead, there are multiple real-
ities which are based on the construction and the inter-
[25, 28].
pretation of
Consequentially, the interpretation and construction of
issues are based on a co-creation of knowledge attain-
able through researcher-researched cooperation. That is,
‘truth’
is subjective and therefore, multiple. Hence,
knowledge is generated through the interaction between
a researcher and an interviewee. Hence, situating studies
within naturalistic setting brings the context to bear in
the generated knowledge) [25, 27].

Research design
The methodology used in the present study should be
understood as a sequence and a follow-up to an earlier
study see [14]. The study employed an explorative and a
multiple case study design with the purpose of unravel-
ling the nuisances and contradictions that emerged in
the earlier quantitative study [25]. The method for the
present study as indicated earlier is qualitative. It is es-
sentially concerned with meaning and generating new
insights into old problems [29, 30].

Population, sample and sampling technique
The population for the qualitative study involved staff
nurses and midwives, including their managers, in six
public hospitals in the Greater Accra region of Ghana.
The staff nurses and midwives of the various units, de-
partments and health facilities were chosen for this part
of the study because they have been engaged in the
health care profession for a considerable number of
years and have diversified experiences in relation to the
emotional demands of health care. In a qualitative study,
there is an attempt to understand a smaller number of
participants’ worldview rather than testing hypotheses
based on a large sample [31]. Accordingly, a sample size
of 15 was selected for the study. In accordance with the
reflections of Baker and Edwards [32], a sample size of
12–60 is adequate to thoroughly explore a phenomenon
qualitatively. We were further guided by the principle of
saturation where we terminated data collection when we
were not finding any additional information from suc-
cessive interviews [31, 32].

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
In line with the earlier study, only staff nurses and mid-
wives with not less than 6 months of work experience
were targeted for the study. This criterion was used be-
time after
cause job attitudes are developed over

working with an organisation [33]. As well, only nurses
and midwives who were employed by the Ghana Health
Service formed part of the study for the purpose of
homogeneity. Hence, student nurses and midwives, as
well as rotation nurses and nurses with less than 6
months of working experience were excluded from the
study. Further, respondents who were part of the first
phase of the study (quantitative study) served as another
criterion for selection. In addition, all nurses and mid-
wives who were not part of the prior study and/or have
less than six-month working experience were excluded
from the qualitative study. A summary of the demo-
graphic characteristics of the sample used is presented
in Table 1.

Semi-structured interviews
The study used a semi-structured interview guide which
was carved out of the results from the earlier. The inter-
view guide was divided into four main sections. The first
section focused on the demographic characteristics of
the interviewees, including gender, age, job title, job du-
ties, and tenure of work. In the second section, the guide
focused on the meaning interviewees gave to emotional
labour. For example, “does your professional duties re-
quire you to engage in certain emotions?”. The third sec-
tion of
the interview guide elicited the emotional
demands of nursing and midwifery. Typical example of a
question on the guide was “is your profession emotionally
demanding? Can you share some of them with me?”. In
the final section, the researchers focused on unearthing
coping mechanisms used by nurses and midwives to ex-
plain the link between emotional labour and job atti-
tudes. Examples of question on this section are “how are
you able to handle these emotional demands of your pro-
fession” and “do you think engaging in these emotional
requirements of your profession can affect your job atti-
tudes?” (see additional file 1 for the interview guide).
Data was collected via face-to-face interviews with re-
spondents which were recorded on tapes.

Data collection procedure
Data collection began with seeking ethical approval from
the Ethical Committee of the Department of Organisa-
tion and Human Resource Management at the Univer-
sity of Ghana Business School and the various health
facilities where the study was conducted. The ethical ap-
proval paved the way to contact potential respondents
and their consent sought. The purpose of the study was
thoroughly explained to potential interviewees. As well,
the confidentiality and anonymity of interviewees were
assured to them ahead of consenting to the study. Inter-
viewees consented to the interviews by pending their sig-
natures to consent forms. All interviews were conducted
the health facilities with nurses and
face-to-face at

midwives who met the study’s inclusion criteria. The
flexibility of the semi-structured interview, which was
employed allowed the researchers to dig deeper into the
issues of concern. Therefore, where necessary, follow-up
questions were asked to gain further information. All
face-to-face interviews were recorded on a recorder with
each interview lasting between 30 and 45 min.

Data analysis
Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim
and manually analyzed using [34, 35] six phases of the-
matic analysis. The process included (1) familiarisation
with the data; (2) generating initial codes; (3) searching
for themes; (4) reviewing themes; (5) defining and nam-
ing themes; and (6) producing the report. The first step
was to transcribe the data verbatimsince all the inter-
views were conducted in English language. The second
stage was the iterative process (where the researchers
read and reread the data and got deep into the data). In
the third and fourth stages, the researchers identified
themes and codes relevant to the current research’s aims
and objectives. In the fifth stage, identified themes were
restructured and revisited to ensure that the analysed
data were focused and detailed enough. The final step
was where the coded statements were then grouped
under different broad themes. Following recommenda-
tion on improving the validity of qualitative research, we
made attempts to capture exactly what participants
intended (participant validation) by obtaining feedback
from them [36]. Further, each stage of the analysis in-
tensely engaged co-authors discussing initial
themes
until we reached consensus. Such cross-validation and
in increasing inter-
group interpretation are useful

subjective comprehension, analytic rigour, and validity of
the interpretations of the findings [37, 38]. In order to
hide the identities of the participants, we used pseudo-
names to participants narratives for anonymity purposes.
.

Results
The significant relationships between surface acting and
job attitudes but no significant relationship between
deep acting and job attitudes as witnessed by [14] cre-
ated a clear path for the qualitative study. In the qualita-
tive study, the researchers were interested in gaining an
understanding of how the respondents conceptualised
emotional labour, unearthing the emotional demands of
healthcare among nurses and midwives and the under-
lining reason(s) which accounted for nature of the rela-
tionship between emotional labour and job attitudes. A
summary of the themes and sub-themes which emerged
from the qualitative data analysed is also presented in
Table 2.

Conceptualizing emotional labour
Display rules
One of the major themes which emanated from the
qualitative study, as indicated in Table 2, was conceptua-
lising emotional
labour. Even though the concept of
emotional labour is relatively new among the nurses and
midwives, their interpretations and meanings of situa-
tions reflect display rules. Thus, they viewed emotional
labour as part of their job duties; that, it is expected of
them to engage in organizationally/occupationally de-
sired emotions which require them to either enhance

Selected quotes

for example, when a patient or a relative makes you angry or may be verbally he abuses you or
something, there even though displaying emotions is part of you, you are not expected to display that
negative emotion. So when it comes to those negative emotions like attack and things you are
expected to control yourself and not to play along these negative emotions. (A: 09)
So you are always required to show happiness, no sign of remorse, no sign of stress, tension, no-no, you
are always supposed to be happy before your clients because we believe that a happy emotions promote
healing so you are always supposed to show this uhm, create that atmosphere around you so that your
patient get this motivation that he is getting well. (E: 06)

yeah, so many. Come to think about the conditions we go through, people losing their loved ones
and you see some parents acting in quote irresponsibly, may be the child is sick, keeping the child in
the house and reporting in the last minute. All these things, you know, make us to be very emotional
and more especially, when you also think that because of some irresponsibility on the side of parents,
they leave their children to die through accidents, drinking poison, falling into wells and those things,
it also adds up. And then some parents, even though the national health insurance for children is free,
they don’t take advantage of it, they come here, they don’t even have money to do registration, when
you look at all those things they can make emotional about it (A: 07).
The demand is very high, sometimes is so stressful that you can’t even take it. You just go like what, a man
doing this, something that, like, as a man when you do those kinds of job, you feel so down, you feel
demoralize, you doing those kind of work, it’s like let me even put it in a quote you are wearing a vagina,
you feel like you are a woman, you have been dejected, that’s the, it’s beyond explanation emotionally, you
feel so down because even with masks, those who defecate on themselves, even with mask, you can still
inhale it, it’s not easy at all and you have to clean the person to look very-very neat and pleasant (H: 03)
oh, I quite remember one time a patient poured water, bucket full of water on a staff claiming that the
staff looks like “shrek”, she watched some cartoon, but I don’t know the mood of the staff but then she
wept, how can you compared me to shrek (M: 09)
Yes, at times you smile, you can cry. When you see that what a client is doing is not right or something. I
quite remember one time a client came in, she is very beautiful, very educated. When she came here, she
was in a mess so I took her to the washroom, I bathed her, I dressed her and then she came back to
normal and then I told her you are very-very beautiful but in all things remember to give thanks to God. I
started crying when I was talking to her, in fact I cried, seeing such a person in this condition. Then some
too, when they crack jokes, you smile with them and then you also crack jokes especially, to those who are
moody, you do certain things for them to be happy, you do certain things for them (B: 04)
.So for instance, if the motivation is low I have to be looking elsewhere. When I’m talking about motivation
not just salary but maybe something small-small. If you do something and you are acknowledged that
ooh you are doing well, keep it up, then I will be committed in doing more. But when the situation is like
you are doing something and nobody is even appreciating you then I don’t feel the motivation, it means I
won’t do it (K: 12).
yeah, (laughs) no human being is the same, we are all special in our own way therefore I think I’m special
that’s how I’m able to handle these demands. I’m able to stand a lot of pressure even with patients who
are uh, difficult. (F: 13)
You don’t take it personal because if you do you will die early, oh yes, you don’t take it personal because
somebody can just come and stand in front of you and insult you without any cause. You are consulting
with doctors and because they think you are consulting with doctors, you can discharge them so after the
prescribers have left, they will come to you, I want you to discharge me and you will tell them you cannot,
eeii, it’s a different issue altogether. So I think we’ve grown to accept, like it’s the nature of the job so we
don’t really take them personal (O:09)

for me, I see this profession as a calling so I do the work wholeheartedly. My Bible teaches me to love
my neighbor as myself so I try as much as possible to understand and emphatise with other people.
(C: 11)
Ohh, as for family they are always encouraging us. As for my family, they are always by my side and they
encourage me a lot especially my husband and my children. After all, how many years is left, you will soon
go on pension and I’m always happy for that (I: 14)
Because at the end of the day you know that at the end of the month you will receive something, it’s
better than you not working at all but if there is any other chance, any moment from now, it’s just that
they are just keeping me, I want to move, I want to divert totally (L: 12)

positive emotions or suppress negative emotions. The
quotes illustrate this perspective:

Well, it is expected of me to be myself when I’m
on duty, not try to pretend, you understand. So, I
need to feel relaxed in my working environment
it, you
and be myself because come to think of

spend most of your hours here so if you come here
and you are going to be acting throughout then
you yourself you will not be satisfied. So, it is ex-
pected that as I come to work, I need to work in
a relaxed environment. Since I’m the one deliver-
ing the service it is expected that I’m relaxed and
in my best frame of mind and I can give my best

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92

without any compulsion or persuasion. That’s how
I feel about it (D: 04).

The curative capital for patients with such emotional
regulation is deeply expressed by another participant
who has worked for 8 years. As indicated below, the
health worker’s emotion is client-tethered in line with
organizational expectations. It is an intentional emo-
tional regulation that is aimed at promoting the well-
being of
the health
the patient rather than that of
worker:

So, you are always required to show happiness, no
sign of remorse, no sign of stress, tension, no-no, you
are always supposed to be happy before your clients
because we believe that happy emotions promote
healing, so you are always supposed to create that
atmosphere around you so that your patient get this
motivation that he is getting well. (E: 06).

Negative emotion is thus normatively prohibited. The
participant below establishes a connection from a cul-
tural norm of emotional regulation to explain her
current expected organisational emotional behaviour.
Her explanation reveals that the expected organizational
emotional behavior might be accentuated by a cultural
socialisation that is proscriptive of expressing negative
emotions:

For example, when a patient or a relative makes you
angry or may be verbally he abuses you or some-
thing, there even though displaying emotions is part
of you (sic), you are not expected to display that
negative emotion. So, when it comes to those negative
emotions like attack and things you are expected to
control yourself and not to play along these negative
emotions (A: 09).

Emotional demands and deficits
Aside the meaning that nurses and midwives gave to
emotional labour, they also asserted that they encounter
a myriad of emotional situations in the course of their
professional duties. The emotional demands as reported
by these health professionals range from positive emo-
tions (happiness) to negative emotions (sadness, abuse,
and emotional exhaustion). However, the emotional de-
mands of healthcare, as alluded to by nurses and mid-
wives,
(emotionally) by
compensated for
superiors and organisations.

are not

Sadness
Healthcare delivery among nurses and midwives is ac-
companied with emotional
situations which hover
around sadness. This is mostly true because some

patients are lost (die) in the process of receiving health-
care. Emotional attachment nurses and midwives de-
velop toward their clients makes the loss of patients
these
become a more saddened situation. However,
health professionals are not expected to show sadness as
a professional emotional expression. In relation to this,
one of the nurses assert that:

“Yeah, so many. Come to think about the conditions
we go through, people losing their loved ones and
you see some parents acting in quote irresponsibly,
may be the child is sick, keeping the child in the
house and reporting in the last minute. All these
things, you know, make us to be very emotional and
more especially, when you also think that because of
some irresponsibility on the side of parents, they
leave their children to die through accidents, drink-
ing poison, falling into wells and those things, it also
adds up” (A: 07).

Abuse and bullying
Another emotion demands of nursing and midwifery is
emotional and physical abuse. The abusive nature of
healthcare is mostly experienced by psychiatric nurses
due to the kind of patients they take care of. The abusive
nature of caring for patients is expressed by one psychi-
atric nurse as:

“oh, I quite remember one time a patient poured
water, bucket full of water on a staff claiming that
the staff looks like “shrek”, she watched some car-
toon, but I don’t know the mood of the staff but then
she wept, how can you compare me to shrek” (M:
09).

A similar situation is re-echoed by another nurse as:

“Sometimes you the staff too, how the client comes
with the symptoms, you will be insulted from head
to toe (laughs), they will make you less. Sometimes if
it’s not the work per say you will do something that
later you will regret it, you have to hold on to your
anger. So those are some of the emotional things that
we go through” (D: 03).

Some nurses also reported bullying from superiors.

The narrative below is an illustration:

May be there is an issue, we expect them to may be
come to the ground and investigate or try to under-
stand why this happened, but you will just be there,
and they will just call for disciplinary committee,
you will just go and face it, (laughs), they don’t just
come down to really understand what is really on

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92

the ground because working here and there, it’s two
different things altogether (O: 11) .

Poor incentivization
Employees generally, expect their organisations to show
much concern about their wellbeing and also value their
contribution. The absence of organisational support
makes employees feel the negative impact of the emo-
tional demands of their profession and are therefore,
riskier to engage in negative job attitudes. On the con-
trary, the availability of support from organisations serve
as protective factor against the negative impact of emo-
tional demands. However, nurses and midwives in the
Ghanaian context perceive their organisations
/em-
ployers to be less supporting. One of the midwives
attested to this:

..So, for instance, if the motivation is low I have to
be looking elsewhere. When I’m talking about motiv-
ation not just salary but maybe something small-
small. If you do something and you are acknowl-
edged that ooh you are doing well, keep it up, then I
will be committed in doing more. But when the situ-
ation is like you are doing something and nobody is
even appreciating you then I don’t feel the motiv-
ation, it means I won’t do it (K: 12).

Incentivizing through social reinforcement seems to be
what the participant indicates as ‘something small-small’.
She seems to place this on the same weighting scale as
salary. She finds the lack of such emotional support as
demotivating. To further substantiate the assertion, a
general nurse alluded that:

As for me, my life is, when I do something I want to
be appreciated so if I’m not appreciated on what I’m
doing I don’t see the need to continue. I have to go
elsewhere where I will be appreciated for my job and
then my output. Because if you are appreciated you
will be doing more, you understand. When we were
kids and you go to exam and they write 100% keep
it up, aren’t you motivated to do more next time?
But when even the teacher is beating you, then you
are like eii, this teacher “paa”, then I will fail for you
to beat me. So that’s how it is (M: 12).

Emotional exhaustion
Healthcare is noted to be stressful due to varying health
conditions presented to professional workers. The stress-
ful nature of healthcare professional duties tends to have
a consequential effect on emotional wellbeing of the
healthcare workers
they get emotionally
exhausted. In relation to this subject, one of the nurses
who happens to be a male shared that:

such that

“The demand is very high, sometimes is so stressful
that you can’t even take it (sic). You just go like
what, a man doing this, something that like, as a
job, you feel so
man when you do those kinds of
down, you feel demoralized, you doing those kind of
work, it’s like, let me even put it in a quote, you are
wearing a vagina, you feel like you are a woman,
it’s beyond explanation
you have been dejected,,
emotionally, you feel so down because even with
masks, those who defecate on themselves, you can
still inhale it, it’s not easy at all and you have to
clean the person to look very-very neat and pleasant
(H: 03).

The participant above communicates feelings of ex-
haustion arising from an experience of working on a
task considered a stereotypical female job in the soci-
ety and even at the workplace. For example, cleaning
a pregnant woman and other related issues. Given the
patriarchy in Ghana, it is possible that merely work-
ing in a stereotypical female profession (e.g. nursing)
as a man may in itself attract some opprobrium from
segment of the society. However, for the participant
above,
it appears the task of caring for patients in-
cluding cleaning patients up and dressing them was
not only overwhelming but also denigrating in his
worldview.

Emotional mix bag
Even though healthcare is accompanied with negative
emotional situations, it cannot be overlooked that there
are situations which connote a bouquet of emotions
(both positive and negative). Healthcare delivery among
nurses and midwives presents itself with a bouquet of
emotions that are both positive and negative in nature.
The following quotes illustrate the emotional mix bag
nature of healthcare delivery which are alluded to by
nurses and midwives:

Yes, at times you smile, you can cry. When you
see that what a client is doing is not right or
I quite remember one time a client
something.
came in,
she is very beautiful, very educated.
When she came here, she was in a mess, so I took
her to the washroom, I bathed her, I dressed her
and then she came back to normal and then I
told her you are very-very beautiful but
in all
things remember to give thanks to God. I started
crying when I was talking to her, in fact I cried,
seeing such a person in this condition. Then some
too, when they crack jokes, you smile with them
and then you also crack jokes especially, to those
who are moody, you do certain things for them to
be happy, you do certain things for them (B: 04).

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92 

Page 8 of 12

“For example, when a patient looks that bad and
you think that this one 50-50 and you see the patient
recovering, the patient is talking back with you, you
are happy, you are this and then you even share
with them, wow, you scared me to death, I was so
much afraid. You know, those things, they help you
to know that you are doing the work whole heartedly
or even if you cry with the patient when they lose
their loved one, they will know that oh, even the
nurse cried, they will also know that you’ve done
your best, you feel very sorry that you couldn’t save
that love one for them and at the end of the day they
also don’t blame you for what has happened because
you also showing some emotions which means that
you are also a human being, you can also be in the
same soup, that is also what releases comfort in me”
(A: 05).

Coping with emotional labour
Even though engaging in emotional labour mostly gives
birth to negative work attitudes and outcomes, em-
ployees over time develop coping mechanisms or fall on
some resources in order to deal with the emotional de-
mands of their profession. These included psychological
capital, routinisation/normalization, religious resources,
social support and job security.

Psychological capital
intrapersonal unique
individual,
These encompass all
qualities which enable nurses and midwives to deal with
the emotional
the profession. The
quotes below substantiate this:

requirements of

yeah, (laughs) no human being is the same, we are
all special in our own way therefore I think I’m spe-
cial that’s how I’m able to handle these demands.
I’m able to stand a lot of pressure even with patients
who are uh, difficult … …. (F: 13).

Others explained their psychological capital along
temperamental and religious lines. The participant below
measures her personal resource in her ability to effort-
lessly, confront others for a perceived injustice, forgive,
and repair the relationship. It seems that she connects
this aspect of her to her religious faith:

I’m free, I’m very free, when you do something to me,
I will tell you that day, that place, finish! I don’t
send it home, ask them they will tell you. I’m free, if
you do me something I won’t send it home oo, I will
just tell you this is what you’ve done to me, I don’t
like it and there it is finished! Somebody will see me
the following day and not greet me. I will call you,
come here, why are you not talking to me just

because of yesterday? Are you a Christian or a
Muslim, when you went and slept, did you pray? (J:
12).

A participant reported the regulation of her emotion
in a more mechanical fashion: that she could turn it on
and off. Her emotional regulation is thus very intentional
and agentic: Me, I’m able to put my emotions in check so
I decide when I want to get angry then I get angry, I don’t
just get angry (C: 08).

Routinization/normalization
Thus, nurses and midwives mostly see the emotional de-
mands of their work as normal and routine aspects of
the profession. The normalization and/or routinization
of their emotional requirements enables nurses and mid-
wives to handle and manage the emotional circum-
stances of their profession. In the words of a female
general nurse with a 11-year work experience, she al-
luded that:

Errr, it has become a routine thing so as and when it
comes I handle it but I try very hard, yes, I try very
hard to keep more especially, negative emotions
under control but for the positive ones, I try to dis-
play them because I want my patient to see me out-
side and say that this nurse helped me a lot, this
nurse is really good (A: 10).

As indicated above, although emotional regulation is
an integral part of her work, she reports that the nega-
tive aspects are difficult
to manage. Her patient-
orientation seems to be a driving force.

You don’t take it personal because if you do, you will

somebody can just come and stand in front of you
and insult you without any cause. You are consult-
ing with doctors and because they think you are con-
sulting with doctors you can discharge them so after
the prescribers have left, they will come to you, I
want, you to discharge me and you will tell them
you cannot. Eeii, it’s a different issue altogether. So, I
think we’ve grown to accept, like it’s the nature of
the job so we don’t really take them personal (O:
09).

As can be gleaned from the above, the participant de-
privatizes mistreatment from clients as means of man-
aging her emotions. She consigns clients’ misbehavior
to the realm of occupational hazards.
toward her

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92 

Page 9 of 12

Importantly, she indicates that ‘we’ve grown to accept’
as potentially intimating that emotional regulation can
be a by-product of certain organisational cultural
expectations.

Religious resources
these sub-theme addresses all religious resources these
health professionals rely on in attempt to manage the
emotional circumstances of the profession. The world-
view of the Ghanaian is greatly infused with religious be-
liefs and/or
times are
spirituality which in recent
accentuated by Pentecostal beliefs [39, 40]. Religious or
spiritual resources enable nurses and midwives to man-
age the emotional circumstances of their professional
duties. The quotes below demonstrate this:

Well, a lot of faith take place, I’m telling you, and
prayer. A lot of faith because if you want to deal
with this on a mere physical level, there will be a
time you can’t continue, you will feel it’s a bother.
And also, passion for the job, if nursing is not your
field and you come in to make money or look for
position then you will be so disappointed and so
frustrated and that’s where you will end up I mean
doing displacement. You will end up displacing all
your anger on your client. So it’s really an important
thing and so that’s what help us to manage some of
these situations (F: 14).

Faith and prayer are indicated as spiritual resources
that mitigate the stressors related to emotional regula-
tion. Accordingly, she views the nursing profession as re-
quiring commitment that transcends personal ambition.
It is in the light of the above that others reported view-
ing the profession as a ‘calling’ and one whose ethos
seem to find a strong validation within the Judeo-
Christian tradition. The participant below theologizes
the profession and centralizes love and empathy as de-
fining virtues.

For me, I see this profession as a calling, so I do the
work wholeheartedly. My Bible teaches me to love
my neighbor as myself, so I try as much as possible
to understand and emphatise with other people. (C:
11).

Explicitly, others have accepted the professional de-
mands and the emotional hazards that come along with
it as a means to an end- to solicit divine benefits. Such
transcendental posturing reinforces a service-oriented
attitude and organisational commitment:

Me, for instance, one thing about me is I always tell
myself and my colleagues, I don’t do the work for

man per say but I do it to please God, so ask them,
when I come I do my best because at the end of the
day God will reward me, not man because here
whatever you do they don’t appreciate it, but how I
have made my mind, if I rely on them it’s not en-
couraging to me to be committed to the organisation
(L: 10).

rely on support

Social support
Nurses and midwives
from co-
workers, family, friends and significant others to en-
able them to better handle the emotional require-
ments of healthcare delivery. The extent, and richness
of
(either perceived or received)
determine the impact of the emotional demands of
healthcare delivery on job attitudes. As evidenced in
the quotes below, nurses and midwives greatly rely on
social support in the course of performing their pro-
fessional duties:

the social support

Anyway, I think among us, we try to encourage each
other … ……… … oh, for instance, when the water
was poured, we had to caution the client who did
that and we all came together to do that. So you’ll
realise that later she came to apologise so it’s like we
are all onboard together (L: 13).

As indicated below, the management of relationships-
both with superiors and subordinates is an integral part
of the support system for the health workers. Further,
incentives are perceived as important features of the
support from superiors. Generally, these relationships
are presented as ‘primary’ within the purview of organ-
isational support:

Sometimes from colleagues. That’s why I say when
you are working with colleagues and you are working
as a team sometimes you encourage one another.
Even if you are in charge and you are the leader you
have to be in relationship with your subordinates so
that they can come to you and freely share their
problems with you, then when you also have an
issue, they can also support or encourage you. So
sometimes support from one another as colleagues
really help and when you have superiors who will
also give you a listening ear and try to, if not provide
all the incentive packages you need, try to give some
little incentive here and there, it helps (O: 14).

Beyond the social support which emanates from the
colleagues and dynamic interactions between superiors
and subordinates, participants also reported receiving
support from their families:

Lartey et al. BMC Nursing           (2020) 19:92 

Page 10 of 12

yeah, from my family because that’s the only place
I’m able to express myself about what happened to
me at work and they tell me it’s normal, that’s how
your work is, try to reassure you that your reward is
in heaven, that alone is satisfactory, you just get sat-
isfied that you will get some special reward some-
where (C: 13).

We can deduct from the above narrative that the par-
ticipant sees the family as ‘containers’ to dump all her
emotional stressors. The support from the family is
partly rationalizing the demands of her work and also in-
spiring her by virtually sacralizing her profession.

Job security
Apart
from the personal and religio-social resources
which nurses and midwives harness to manage the emo-
tional demands of their profession, they again look up to
secured nature of
the job. Nurses and midwives in
Ghana perceive their job as a secured profession com-
pared to others who are not employed. Most of these
health professionals are assured of employment after
completing their process of training and will hardly lose
their jobs. The assurance of job security keeps them go-
ing in their professional duties. This is evidenced in the
following quotes as proclaimed by some nurses:

“as for that no, I can’t even think of any, the only
support is that at least I’m employed, you know
Ghana here most people are unemployed so if I’m
employed that’s okay, I don’t want to lose my job so
honestly, I don’t receive any other support (O: 16).

This point above is corroborated by another from a

different nurse below.

Because at the end of the day you know that at the
end of the month you will receive something, it’s bet-
ter than you not working at all but if there is any
other chance, any moment from now, it’s just that
they are just keeping me, I want to move, I want to
divert totally (L: 12).

Discussion
As witnessed from the thematic analysis, the health pro-
fessionals’ conceptions of emotional labour reflects a re-
sponse to normative organisational standards. Thus,
nurses and midwives perceive that as part of their pro-
fessional duties, it is expected of them to show certain
emotions while suppressing other emotions. In line with
the conceptualization of emotional labour by Hocshchild
[10, 11] and Theodosius [41], emotional labour denotes
the engagement in display rules by either suppressing
emotions.
emotions

naturally

or

Nevertheless, the finding from the present study contra-
dicts the finding by [12] who disclosed that emotional
labour among media practitioners is conceptualised as
faking. Unlike the study by [12], the professional duty of
healthcare cannot encourage faking emotions because it
deals with handling human lives and therefore, these
health professionals (nurses and midwives) do not per-
ceive their emotional labouring as faking but rather a re-
sponse to normative organisational standards. In line
with Grandey’s conceptualization and theoritisation of
emotional labour, employees engage in emotional labour
as a response to organizationally or occupationally de-
sired emotions (display rules).

Also, the discovery from the present study that nursing
and midwifery require engaging in a bouquet of emo-
tions ranging from negative to positive emotions is not
it corroborates extant literature. For in-
out of place;
stance, empirical studies by [3, 4, 7] point to the fact that
nursing and midwifery involve diverse emotional de-
mands including abuse from clients, supervisors and col-
leagues, work burnout, guilt, anger, chronic conditions
of clients and death of clients. The consequential effects
of negative and positive emotional experiences of health-
care professionals are established in the extant literature
see [14].

In line with the economic context of Ghana, nurses
and midwives perceive their profession as a source of
job security because there are less alternative job oppor-
tunities. Thus, some individuals in this context, may join
the profession not necessarily because of the love of the
job but because there are less alternatives. This orienta-
tion by some nurses and midwives is more likely to
make them prone to surface acting rather than deep act-
ing, as disclosed in the earlier study see [14].

The present study also disclosed routinization or
normalization another coping resource to emotional
laborung. Thus, the routinization and normalization of
the emotional experiences of health professionals tend
to cushion them against the impact of the emotional de-
mands of healthcare profession.

Furtherance to the above argument, the study also dis-
closed other coping resources employed by nurses and
midwives to manage the emotional demands of their
profession. As evidenced,
these health professionals
heavily draw on personal (psychological capital), reli-
gious/spiritual, social and job resources to enable them
deal with the emotional demands of their profession.
Thus, the extent to which these are made available to
these health professionals tend to serve as a protective
factor against experiencing the negative impact of the
profession’s emotional demands.

Situating the findings to the job demand-resources
model, professional healthcare delivery is accompanied
with varying emotional experiences including, but not

limited to, bullying, abuse, emotional exhaustion and
sadness. Nevertheless, healthcare professionals fall on
varying resources at workplace (be it personal, social,
organsiational or religious) to enable them manage the
emotional demands and experiences of their professional
duties. Thus, findings from the present study align with
the job demand-resources model.

Limitation of the study
Even though the study employs a unique methodological
approach to the study of emotional
the re-
searchers acknowledge some potential flaws to the ap-
proach employed. The study design was based on a
cross-sectional one which disregard changing trend over
time as used in longitudinal study. A longitudinal study,
if used, may also indicate some possible changes in the
variables studied and give a more precise association be-
tween them. Nevertheless,

Implications and recommendations
Healthcare delivery is anchored with emotional regula-
conform with
expected
tions which
organizationally or occupationally desired emotional dis-
play. Nurses and midwives are always expected to show
positive emotions such as showing empathy and happi-
ness on their job. Nevertheless, the display of positive
emotions by these health professionals may be consistent
or contradict their inner feelings which will in turn in-
fluence their job attitudes. As witnessed in this study,
the engagement in emotional labour is accompanied by
varying emotional experiences. Hence, nurses and mid-
wives, as part of their training, should be socialized to
develop the necessary emotional
intelligence that will
enable them to manage the emotional experiences and
demands of their professional duties. The development
of emotional intelligence by these health professionals
will sharpen and strengthen their psychological capital
in the event of managing the emotional and stressful na-
ture of their jobs.

The study also provided much evidence in support of
the assertion that nurses and midwives rely on myriad
resources to enable them to handle the emotional de-
mands of their jobs. In regard, health institutions should
be more willing to provide all necessary supports (phys-
ical, emotional, social, mental and others) to its em-
ployees especially, nurses and midwives since these have
been found to buffer and protect employees against ex-
periencing the negative impacts of their work duties.
Further, the work environment of these nurses and mid-
wives should be made friendlier such that coworkers, su-
pervisors and management are able to provide social

support to employees to enable them to better manage
the emotional demands of their profession.

In the same vein, since the average Ghanaian is reli-
gious and/or spiritual, the professional training of nurses
and midwives should acknowledge that healthcare deliv-
ery is a moral issue and should therefore, infuse religious
and/or spiritual dimension. The moral and religious for-
titude of these health professionals, when awaken, will
shield them against the negative consequences of the
emotional demands of healthcare delivery.

Conclusion
The nature of work among nurses and midwives re-
quires them to have an ability of managing and regulat-
ing their emotions. Their display of emotions
is
expected to be in line with organizationally desired emo-
tions which also have consequences on a myriad of is-
sues including their job attitudes. The present study has
provided much evidence in support of the fact that pro-
fessional healthcare is associated with emotional experi-
and
sadness
ences
emotional exhaustion. In addition to the above,
the
study found a number of coping resources employed by
nurses and midwives in managing the emotional de-
mands of the profession. The use of a qualitative re-
search methodology to the study of emotional
labour
and gain better understanding of the phenomenon is evi-
denced in the present study.
