Abstract

Although an inverse relation between social support and psychological distress among chronic 
pain patients has been previously reported, little is known about what mediates this association. 
We examined mindfulness as a mediator of the relationship between social support and 
psychological distress. In this cross-sectional study, chronic pain patients (N=94) completed 
assessments of social support, mindfulness, and psychological distress. Greater social support 
was associated with less psychological distress. Greater mindfulness was associated with greater 
social support and less psychological distress. Mediation analyses demonstrated that mindfulness 
partially mediated the relationship between social support and psychological distress. Findings 
support and extend prior research by demonstrating a potentially important mediating effect of 
mindfulness within chronic pain patients. This suggests an important link between social support 
and mindfulness, and that their integration in the pursuit of mental health should be considered in 
future behavioral interventions.

Introduction

The mental and physical health benefits of social support have been demonstrated among 
various populations, including those with chronic pain (Harandi et al., 2017; Holt-Lunstad 
& Smith, 2012). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the global prevalence of psychological

distress has increased among the general population (Mahmud et al., 2022). Individuals 
with chronic pain appear to be at particular risk for experiencing psychological distress, 
with impaired coping impacting quality of life (Piraccini et al., 2020). Chronic pain patients 
across countries who reported diminished social support during the pandemic reported 
greater distress (Serrano-Ibáñez et al., 2021) and worsened pain symptoms (Hruschak et al., 
2021). There is a gap in knowledge of how social support protects against psychological 
distress among chronic pain patients. Chronic pain is often comorbid with psychopathology 
(Dersh et al., 2002), which can lead to a host of other maladaptive pain-related cognitions 
(e.g., pain catastrophizing) and worsen the experience of pain. Understanding how social 
support serves as a protective factor against psychological distress, especially during times 
of heightened social isolation, is important for identifying ways to promote better mental 
health among individuals with chronic pain.

Researchers have conceptualized an integrative model of social support, suggesting that 
social support can reduce distress through various pathways, three of which are emotional 
state (e.g.,decreased negative affect), appraisals of events (e.g.,positive appraisals), and 
situational-relevant behaviors (e.g.,effective coping strategies) (Feeney & Collins, 2014). 
Mindfulness, as a psychosocial construct that aligns with these three pathways, may 
serve as a mechanistic link between social support and decreased distress (Wilson et al., 
2020). Mindfulness involves awareness of and ability to regulate experiences in the present 
moment, without judgment (Feldman et al., 2007). Mindfulness is consistently associated 
with less psychological distress (Baer, 2003). Importantly, mindfulness is also associated 
with greater social support (Klainin-Yobas et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2020).

Our previous investigation in healthy adults revealed that mindfulness partially accounted 
for the link between social support and less distress, providing initial evidence that 
mindfulness is a mechanism through which social support may exert its psychological 
benefits (Wilson et al., 2020). However, this has not yet been tested among individuals 
with chronic pain, nor has mindfulness been investigated within the context of significant 
COVID-19-related stressors, where social distancing mandates disrupted many systems of 
social support. It is important to further investigate because mindfulness-based interventions 
(MBIs) can be used as stand-alone treatment or in combination with other treatment 
modalities to reduce psychological distress and opioid consumption (Majeed et al., 2018).

This cross-sectional study examined the extent to which social support was related to 
psychological distress in a cohort of chronic pain patients after a year of intermittent social 
distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we explored whether mindfulness 
explained the association between social support and psychological distress.

2.  Methods

2.1  Participants and Procedure

A sample of U.S. adults with chronic pain (N=94) completed an online survey from May 
21-June 7, 2021. Patients were eligible to participate if they had persistent pain (≥ 3 
months), were ≥ 18 years of age and English speaking, and were a resident of Massachusetts

(Hruschak et al., 2021). The majority of patients (Mage=41.77, SD=16.23, range:21–77) 
were female (78.7%) and White (81.9%).

The study was part of a larger study investigating the impact of social distancing guidelines 
on pain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was approved by the Partners Institutional 
Review Board. Patients provided electronic consent before completing validated surveys, 
which took approximately 30–45 minutes. Patients were compensated with a $20 Amazon 
electronic gift code for their participation.

2.2  Measures

Social support was measured using the 12-item Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social 
Support (Zimet et al., 1988). Each item was rated on a scale from (1=very strongly disagree, 
7=very strongly agree). Items were summed and higher scores indicated greater social 
support.

Mindfulness was measured with the 10-item Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale – 
Revised (Feldman et al., 2007). Each item was rated on a scale from (1=rarely/not at all, 
4=almost always). One item was reverse coded, and items were averaged. Higher scores 
reflected greater levels of mindfulness.

Anxiety was measured using the 7-item anxiety short form from the Patient Reported 
Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS; Cella et al., 2010). Patients indicated 
the frequency with which they experienced anxiety symptoms on a scale from (1=never, 
5=always). Items were summed, and higher scores indicated greater anxiety.

Depression was assessed using the 8-item depression short form from the PROMIS. 
On a scale from (1=never, 5=always), patients indicated the frequency with which they 
experienced depressive symptoms. Items were summed, and higher scores indicated greater 
depression.

Stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1994). On 
a scale from (0=never, 4=very often), patients indicated the frequency with which they 
experienced symptoms of stress. Appropriate items were reverse coded, and items were 
summed. Higher scores reflected greater stress.

Ten items from the Brief Pain Inventory (Cleeland & Ryan, 1991) assessed how pain 
interfered with patients’ lives. Each item was rated on a scale from (0=did not interfere 
at all, 10=completely interfered). Items were summed, and higher score indicated greater 
pain interference. Because pain interference is associated with higher levels of psychological 
distress (Ryan & McGuire, 2016), it was explored as a potential covariate.

3.  Results

Means, standard deviations, and Cronbach’s alphas for each variable are reported in Table 
1. Spearman correlations for continuous variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for categorical 
variables assessed the associations among key study variables and potential covariates (Table 
1). Greater social support was associated with higher levels of mindfulness and lower

levels of psychological distress. Greater mindfulness was associated with less psychological 
distress.

The associations between patients’ psychological distress and other variables (pain, 
demographics) were explored for potential covariates. Greater pain interference and younger 
age were associated with greater psychological distress (ps<.05). Additionally, females 
reported greater psychological distress (ps<.05). Race, marital status, and income were not 
significantly related to psychological distress (ps>.11).

3.1  Mediation Analyses

Mediation models were constructed to test whether social support was indirectly associated 
with three aspects of psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress) through mindfulness 
(Figure 1; see Supplemental material for alternative models). Mediation analyses were 
tested using 5000 bootstrapped samples with the PROCESS macro for SPSS. For each 
model, social support was entered as the independent variable (x variable), mindfulness 
as the mediator variable (m variable), and a psychological distress outcome (i.e., anxiety, 
depression, stress) as the dependent variable (y variable). Pain interference, age and gender 
were included as covariates.

3.1.1  Anxiety—There was a significant indirect effect of social support on anxiety 
through mindfulness (b = −0.035, 95% CI [−0.08, −0.004]). The direct effect of social 
support on anxiety was no longer significant (b = −0.050, p=0.199) when mindfulness was 
included in the model.

3.1.2  Depression—There was a significant indirect effect of social support on 
depression through mindfulness (b = −0.029, 95% CI [−0.081, −0.003]). The direct effect 
of social support on depression was reduced (b = −0.146, p=.003) when mindfulness was 
included in the model.

3.1.3  Stress—There was a significant indirect effect of social support on stress through 
mindfulness (b = −0.040, 95% CI [−0.105, −0.004]). The direct effect of social support on 
stress was reduced (b = −0.094, p=.022) when mindfulness was included in the model.

4.  Discussion

The current study examined the protective effects of social support and mindfulness against 
psychological distress among chronic pain patients after living through a year of the 
pandemic. Greater social support and greater mindfulness were associated with less distress. 
Further, our findings suggest that mindfulness partially mediates the relation between social 
support and psychological distress, even when accounting for patients’ pain interference, 
age, and gender.

Consistent with prior research, greater social support was associated with greater 
mindfulness. This finding adds to the limited research linking social support and 
mindfulness (described previously within healthy adults) by demonstrating this association 
within a different sample (chronic pain patients), and within a different context (reduced

social support during social distancing). Greater mindfulness was also related to less 
psychological distress, consistent with previous findings in healthy adults during the 
pandemic (Haliwa et al., 2020). Replication of these associations between social support, 
mindfulness, and distress across samples and contexts demonstrates consistency and 
generalizability.

To our knowledge, only one other study has examined mindfulness as a mechanism 
through which social support can reduce psychological distress, finding that mindfulness 
significantly reduced the association between social support and distress (Wilson et al., 
2020). The current findings replicate these findings, demonstrating that inclusion of 
mindfulness as a mediator weakened the association between social support and three 
assessments of psychological distress among individuals with chronic pain, at a time of 
relatively decreased access to that support.

Because chronic pain is often comorbid with psychopathology (Dersh et al., 2002), it 
is important to investigate ways of protecting against psychological distress. Reducing 
distress has shown to reduce other maladaptive pain-related cognitions and the experience 
of pain. Our findings extend current literature and provide potentially important clinical 
implications that mindfulness skills may be a promising therapeutic target to reduce distress 
among chronic pain. MBIs are increasingly employed as a psychological intervention for 
patients with pain. Group-based mindfulness interventions have shown to reduce depression 
in patients with chronic pain (Khoo et al., 2019). Supplementing social support with 
mindfulness skills may improve patients’ ability to cope with stressors, particularly in times 
of heightened distress and isolation.

There are limitations to consider in interpreting these findings. The observational nature 
precludes inference of causality, and the cross-sectional design limits temporal ordering of 
variables. Future experimental or longitudinal designs are necessary to test for causality 
and the directionality of relationships. Interestingly, we found no evidence that social 
support mediated the association between mindfulness and anxiety or stress (alternative 
model), in contrast to our previous study in healthy volunteers (Wilson et al., 2020), 
where a bidirectional mediating effect was observed. While we replicated findings based 
on healthy adult samples by using a sample of chronic pain patients, our sample was 
from Massachusetts and mostly White and female, which constrains the generalizability 
of these findings. Future studies will benefit from recruiting a more demographically and 
geographically diverse sample. The size of the sample was small, which raises potential 
concerns about Type I error. Future researchers should recruit a larger sample in hopes of 
replicating these findings.

Our results show that social support and mindfulness have protective effects against 
psychological distress in chronic pain patients. Further, mindfulness partially mediates the 
association between social support and distress. Our findings expand upon the limited 
research within this area by demonstrating these associations within a chronic pain sample, 
providing further empirical support for Feeney and Collins’ (2014) model of social support. 
Additionally, our findings suggest that integration of social support and mindfulness may be
