Abstract
The  suggested  overlap  between  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  and  gender  dysphoria/incongruence  (GD/GI)  has  been 
much  disputed. This  review  showed  a  relationship  between ASD  traits  and  GD  feelings  in  the  general  population  and  a 
high prevalence of GD/GI in ASD. Our meta-analyses revealed that the pooled estimate of the prevalence of ASD diag-
noses in GD/GI people was 11% (p < .001) and the overall effect size of the difference in ASD traits between GD/GI and 
control  people  was  significant  (g = 0.67,  p < .001).  Heterogeneity  was  high  in  both  meta-analyses. We  demonstrated  that 
the chances that there is not a link between ASD and GD/GI are negligible, yet the size of it needs further investigation.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
condition  diagnosed  based  on  significant  challenges  with 
social-communication  and  a  restricted,  repetitive  pattern 
of  interests  and  behavior  (American  Psychiatric  Associa-
tion, 2013). It affects approximately 1% of the worldwide 
population  (e.g.,  Lai  et  al.,  2014)  and  is  associated  with 
high rates of co-occurring conditions (e.g., depression and 
anxiety; Joshi et al., 2013; Lever & Geurts, 2016; Vohra et 
al., 2017) as well as with a higher risk of suicide than the 
general population (Cassidy et al., 2014; Hirvikoski et al., 
2016).  In  recent  years,  several  clinicians  and  researchers 
have  postulated  that ASD  overlaps  with  gender  dysphoria 
(GD) or gender incongruence (GI; e.g., Strang, Janssen, et 
al., 2018; van der Miesen, Cohen-Kettenis, et al.,2018).

GD,  formally  known  as  gender  identity  disorder  (GID; 
American  Psychiatric Association,  2000),  is  a  psychiatric 
condition characterized by an incongruence between one’s 
birth-assigned  sex  and  one’s  experienced/reported  gender, 
which  is  accompanied  by  clinically  significant  distress 
about this incongruence (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013).  GI  is  a  more  general  term  that  describes  a  condi-
tion in which a person’s experienced/reported gender does

not  align  with  their  birth-assigned  sex  (Butler,  2020).  We 
should note here that not all GI individuals experience GD 
(Olson-Kennedy et al., 2016). As to the prevalence of co-
occurring mental health conditions, research has shown that 
it is significantly higher in GD/GI adults than in the general 
population (e.g., Dhejne et al., 2016; Zucker et al., 2016). 
Research has also shown that GD/GI children and adults are 
at increased risk of self-harm and suicidality (e.g., Aitken et 
al., 2016; Cerel et al., 2021; de Graaf et al., 2020). Given the 
well-established increased risk of mental health conditions 
and suicidal behavior both in ASD and GD/GI, it could be 
argued that the co-occurrence of these conditions imposes a 
particularly distressful burden on an individual (George & 
Stokes, 2018a; Hall et al., 2020). Therefore, it is important 
to study and understand this link.

The  number  of  publications  on  the  suggested  overlap 
between  ASD  and  GD/GI  has  more  than  doubled  in  the 
last  two  years,  reflecting  the  increased  attention  this  topic 
has received from clinicians, researchers, as well as the lay 
press (e.g., Seaman, 2016; Strang, Janssen, et al., 2018). Yet, 
it remains debated whether evidence supports this hypoth-
esis (Fortunato et al., 2021; Turban & van Schalkwyk, 2018; 
Turban, 2018). Several reviews of the literature on the co-
occurrence  of ASD  and  GD/GI  have  been  conducted,  but 
most of these were based on a very small number of stud-
ies  published  prior  to  2016  (Glidden  et  al.,  2016;  van  der 
Miesen et al., 2016; van Schalkwyk et al., 2015; Wood & 
Halder, 2014).

ORIGINAL PAPER3104

More  recently,  Øien  et  al.  (2018)  identified  and  cata-
logued  studies  on  the  co-occurrence  of ASD  and  GD,  but 
did  not  attempt  to  answer  any  research  questions.  In  con-
trast, Thrower et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review 
of the literature to investigate whether there is an overrep-
resentation of ASD diagnoses/caseness (and attention defi-
cit hyperactivity disorder) in people with GD. They found 
that the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in this population was 
increased (range: 6–26%), but this was not examined statis-
tically. This leaves a critical gap in the literature, which we 
propose to fill in the current article.

To  examine  whether  the  evidence  indicates  a  link  a 
between ASD and GD/GI, we adopted two approaches in the 
current article. In Part 1 we appraised the existing literature 
concerning the co-occurrence of ASD and GD/GI, including 
not only studies conducted among autistic and GD/GI indi-
viduals but also studies that examined the suggested overlap 
in the general population. It is important to note here that the 
features of ASD represent a single continuum that is known 
as  “broad  autism  phenotype”.  People  with  a  diagnosis  of 
ASD fall at the high end of this continuum and people with 
low levels of ASD traits fall at the low end of it (e.g., Bolton

Process

et al., 1994; Goldberg et al., 2005; Le Couteur et al., 1996; 
Murphy et al., 2000; Ronald et al., 2006). On this basis, it 
has been argued that important information about ASD can 
be obtained by investigating individual differences in ASD 
traits and their relationship to other phenomena among peo-
ple from the general population (e.g., Lind et al., 2020). In 
Part  2  we  conducted  the  first  meta-analyses  of  studies  of 
ASD diagnoses and ASD traits. Our aim was to report the 
first pooled prevalence estimate of ASD diagnoses in GD/
GI  people  and  examine  the  hypothesis  that  GD/GI  people 
have elevated levels of ASD traits.1

Part 1: ASD and GD/GI: A Systematic 
Literature Review

Method

To perform the systematic literature review and meta-analy-
ses (see Part 2), we followed the Preferred Reporting Items 
for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA) 
checklist guidelines where possible (Moher et al., 2015). A 
systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Sci-
ence,  Pub  Med,  and  PsycINFO  by  the  first  author  of  this 
article. Studies of interest were those examining the overlap 
between ASD/ASD  traits  and  GD/GI.  To  identify  articles 
published  prior  to  October  2020,  we  used  combinations 
of  the  following  search  terms:  “autism,  autism  spectrum 
disorder, autistic traits, autistic, ASD, Asperger syndrome, 
GD,  transgender,  gender  dysphoric,  GID,  transsexualism, 
transgenderism,  sex  reassignment,  GI,  non-binary/nonbi-
nary, gender variance, gender non-conformity/gender non-
conformity, and gender diversity”, using the Boolean AND 
operator.

Articles  that  were  considered  eligible  were  those  that 
examined  either  the  relationship  between  ASD  traits  and 
GD/GI  in  the  general  population,  the  prevalence  of  GD/
GI in autistic cohorts, or the prevalence of ASD diagnoses/
caseness/traits in GD/GI cohorts. Please note that when arti-
cles reported evidence about the prevalence of ASD diagno-
ses, GD/GI participants had to have—self-report—a formal 
diagnosis of ASD (including Asperger’s syndrome, autism, 
and pervasive developmental disorder). Also, when articles 
reported evidence about the prevalence of ASD traits in GD/

1  Please  note  that  we  tend  to  use  identity-first  (i.e.,  autistic  person) 
language in this article, since this is preferred by a proportion of intel-
lectually high-functioning autistic adults. Nonetheless, there is not a 
universal agreement about this in the community (Kenny et al., 2016). 
Therefore, person-first language (i.e., person diagnosed with ASD) has 
been used in a few isolated places.

GI cohorts, evidence from a control group (either primary 
or  secondary)  should  have  also  been  reported.  Lastly,  to 
be considered eligible, articles should have reported quan-
titative  results,  been  published  in  peer-reviewed  journals, 
and been written in English. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the study 
selection was conducted in two stages.

In the first stage, we screened articles by title and abstract 
for relevance. At this stage, we excluded proceedings papers 
and  grey  literature  articles,  including  dissertations.  In  the 
second  stage,  we  evaluated  the  suitability  for  inclusion 
based  on  the  full-text  articles.  Studies  that  reported  non-
quantitative results, such as reviews, were excluded at this 
stage (see Table S1). Forty-seven articles met all the eligi-
bility  criteria  and  were  included  in  the  current  systematic 
literature review.

Results

We were able to identify 1,019 studies through the database 
search and five studies through other sources. After dupli-
cates were removed, we screened 736 studies and excluded 
irrelevant  ones.  From  the  remaining  108  full-text  articles, 
we excluded 61 studies because they did not fulfil the crite-
ria described in the method section. Hence, 47 studies that 
contained  information  on  the  overlap  between  ASD  and 
GD/GI  were  included  in  the  current  systematic  literature 
review. Of these studies, five were conducted with children, 
13 with children and adolescents, two with adolescents, two 
with children, adolescents, and adults, nine with adolescents 
and adults, and 16 with adults (for a summary of the identi-
fied studies, see Table S2).

Studies in the General Population

Shumer  et  al.  (2015)  were  the  first  to  report  that  elevated 
ASD traits in children or in mothers predicted high gender 
nonconformity  in  children.  Nabbijohn  et  al.  (2019)  found 
a  positive  and  significant  association  between  ASD  traits 
and  gender  variance  in  a  sample  of  non-autistic  children. 
The  greater  the  number  of ASD  traits  reported  by  parents 
in  these  children,  the  more  parent-reported  gender  vari-
ance  in  these  children.  Interestingly,  in  a  sample  of  non-
autistic adults with no clinically significant levels of ASD 
traits,  George  and  Stokes  (2018b)  reported  a  positive  and 
significant association between the number of self-reported 
ASD traits and the number of concurrent GD feelings. Kal-
litsounaki and Williams (2020) successfully replicated this 
finding in cisgender people from the general population and 
they extended this finding further by reporting a significant 
association  between ASD  traits  and  recalled  gender-typed 
behavior  (i.e.,  behavior  that  is  considered  stereotypically 

3105

characteristic of a specific gender and recalled from child-
hood). That is, the higher the number of self-reported ASD 
traits  by  an  individual,  the  more  they  reported  experienc-
ing  current  GD  feelings  and  the  less  they  recalled  child-
hood  gender-typed  behavior.  Results  were  successfully 
replicated in an independent sample by Kallitsounaki et al. 
(2021),  highlighting  the  existence  of  a  robust  and  reliable 
link between ASD traits, on the one hand, and current GD 
feelings and recalled childhood gender-typed behavior, on 
the other hand.

Studies in the Autistic Population

Janssen  et  al.  (2016),  May  et  al.  (2017),  and  Strang  et  al. 
(2014) used the item 110 from the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL) to investigate cross-gender wishes (i.e., wishes to 
be of opposite binary gender). They all found that parents of 
autistic children endorsed this item more frequently, com-
pared to parents of nonreferred (control) children. Adopting 
a similar methodology, van der Miesen, Hurley, et al. (2018) 
examined  cross-gender  wishes  in  autistic  adolescents  and 
adults,  using  item  110  of  the  Youth  Self-Report  and  the 
Adult Self-Report. This item also measures endorsement of 
the wish to be the binary gender opposite to birth-assigned 
sex. The study reported that autistic adolescents were 2.12 
times more likely to endorse this item for themselves than 
were nonreferred adolescents. Likewise, autistic adults were 
2.46 times more likely to endorse the item than nonreferred 
adults.  Although  this  single  item  approach  has  been  fre-
quently used to investigate gender variance in autistic indi-
viduals, it is not entirely free of criticism. It can be argued 
that the item 110 taps ideation rather than behavior. There-
fore, it cannot be considered equivalent to a gender evalua-
tion in which behaviors, wishes, and roles are all assessed. 
Also, Turban and van Schalkwyk (2018) offered an alterna-
tive explanation for the increased prevalence of the wish to 
be the binary gender opposite to birth-assigned sex observed 
in autistic people. They suggested that the well-established 
cognitive  inflexibility  in  ASD  might  trigger  ephemeral 
desires among autistic people to be the binary gender oppo-
site to their birth-assigned sex.

Hisle-Gorman et al. (2019) has published the only study 
on  the  prevalence  of  a  formal  diagnosis  indicating  GD  in 
children with a primary diagnosis of ASD. Collecting infor-
mation  from  medical  records,  they  conducted  a  matched 
case-cohort study and found that autistic children were over 
4 times more likely to have a co-occurring diagnosis indicat-
ing GD than were non-autistic children. Furthermore, Nab-
bijohn  et  al.  (2019)  found  that  parents  of  autistic  children 
reported significantly more gender variance in their children, 
compared  to  parents  of  non-autistic  children.  George  and 
Stokes (2018b) utilized a standardized self-report measure 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:3103–31171 33106

of GD feelings to compare autistic adults with non-autistic 
adults  (i.e.,  Gender  Identity/Gender  Dysphoria  Question-
naire for Adolescents and Adults [GIDYQ-AA]; Deogracias 
et  al.,  2007).  They  found  that  the  autistic  group  reported 
significantly more GD than the control group. However, it 
is  important  to  note  that  the  percentage  of  cisgender  par-
ticipants  was  89.59%  in  the  control  group  and  70.22%  in 
the  autistic  group.  Given  the  difference  between  the  two 
groups, it could be argued that the inclusion of noncisgen-
der people in the analysis could have artificially inflated the 
score of the autism group, creating a significant difference 
in GD feelings between autistic and control people. Repli-
cation of these findings await before strong conclusions can 
be drawn.

Research has also shown that autistic people, on average, 
report a more diverse range of gender identities than non-
autistic individuals (Bejerot, & Eriksson, 2014; George & 
Stokes,  2018b).  In  keeping  with  these  findings,  Cooper  et 
al. (2018) found that autistic individuals were significantly 
more  likely  to  be  GI  and  to  have  or  plan  to  have  a  gen-
der transition than non-autistic people. Indeed, Walsh et al. 
(2018)  reported  that  15%  of  autistic  individuals  who  par-
ticipated in their study reported trans and nonbinary iden-
tities.  Surprisingly,  also  Dewinter  et  al.  (2017)  found  that 
15.4% of the autistic participants who participated in their 
study reported trans, nonbinary, and other/unknown gender 
identities. However, the latter study did not conduct a com-
parison with a population-based control group, so meaning-
ful  conclusions  are  difficult  to  be  drawn  from  the  results. 
Lastly, Pecora et al. (2020) found that autistic females were 
less likely to identify with their birth-assigned sex than non-
autistic females.

Studies in the GD/GI Population

Prevalence of ASD Diagnoses

To investigate the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in GD/GI 
cohorts,  researchers  have  relied  on  (a)  diagnostic  instru-
ments for ASD, (b) information obtained from patient files, 
and (c) self-reported ASD diagnosis. De Vries et al. (2010) 
published  the  first  quantitative  study  on  the  prevalence  of 
ASD diagnoses in GD individuals. To date, this is the only 
study that has employed a clinical diagnostic tool to identify 
clinically diagnosable ASD in a sample of GD/GI people. 
Specifically, de Vries et al. (2010) utilized the Dutch version 
of the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication 
Disorders-10th  revision  (DISCO-10)  in  26  children  and 
adolescents with suspected ASD who had been referred to 
a gender identity clinic for GD. The investigators reported 
that the incidence of ASD was 7.8% in the total sample of 
gender-referred individuals (N = 204).

Interestingly,  among  adolescents  diagnosed  with  GID, 
6.5%  received  a  co-occurring  diagnosis  of ASD,  whereas 
1.9% of children with GID were diagnosed with ASD. Tur-
ban and van Schalkwyk (2018) argued that since ASD is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder that is usually detected early 
in  development,  the  high  rates  of  clinically  diagnosable 
ASD found in adolescents and not children with GID indi-
cate that the diagnostic tool de Vries at al. (2010) used did 
not  tap  “true”  ASD  characteristics.  Instead,  psychosocial 
issues, such as anxiety and depression, that are particularly 
common in adolescents with GD/GI might have artificially 
inflated  adolescents’  scores  on  DISCO-10.  However,  it  is 
important to stress here that in de Vries at al.’s (2010) study 
only 12.7% of the sample received a diagnostic assessment 
for ASD. As  such,  it  remains  unclear  whether  all  autistic 
children and adolescents were detected.

Compared to diagnostic instruments for ASD, the analy-
sis of prerecorded, patient-centered data has been more fre-
quently used for the investigation of the prevalence of ASD 
diagnoses in GD/GI individuals. In chart reviews, the inci-
dence of a diagnosis of ASD ranged from 3 to 21.3% in GD/
GI  children  and  adolescents  (Becerra-Culqui  et  al.,  2018; 
Chen et al., 2016; Chiniara et al., 2018; Holt et al., 2016; 
Khatchadourian et al., 2014; Leef et al., 2019; Nahata et al., 
2017; Peterson et al., 2017; Shumer et al., 2016; Skagerberg 
et al., 2015; Spack et al., 2012) and from 4.8 to 7.8% in GD/
GI adults (Cheung et al., 2018; Fielding & Bass, 2018; Hey-
lens et al., 2018). When researchers relied upon self-reports, 
the percentage of gender-referred children and adolescents 
who reported possession of a diagnosis of ASD was 9.62% 
(Mahfouda  et  al.,  2019),  and  the  percentage  of  GI  adults 
who reported possession of a diagnosis of ASD ranged from 
2.7 to 82% (Jones et al., 2012; Kristensen & Broome, 2015; 
Murphy et al., 2020; Stagg & Vincent, 2019; Warrier et al., 
2020).

Prevalence of ASD Caseness

To  examine  the  prevalence  of  ASD  caseness  in  GD/GI 
cohorts, researchers have relied on cutoff scores from ASD 
screening questionnaires. Studies have shown that the posi-
tive rates for ASD range from 14.5 to 68% in GD/GI chil-
dren and adolescents (Akgül et al., 2018; Leef et al., 2019; 
Mahfouda et al., 2019; Shumer et al., 2016; Skagerberg et 
al., 2015; VanderLaan, Leef, et al., 2015; van der Miesen, 
de  Vries,  et  al.,  2018)  and  from  1.2  to  40.3%  in  GD/GI 
adults (Heylens et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2012; Kristensen & 
Broome, 2015; Lehmann et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2020; 
Nobili et al., 2018; Nobili et al., 2020; Pasterski et al., 2014; 
Stagg & Vincent, 2019; Vermaat et al., 2018). However, the 
incidence of ASD caseness ranges widely depending on the 
cutoff scores used. For example, while Pasterski et al. (2014) 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:3103–31171 3found that 5.5% of transgender adults diagnosed with GD or 
GID scored ≥ 32 on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ-50; 
Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), suggesting clinically significant 
levels of ASD traits, Kristensen and Broome (2015) reported 
that 39% of gender-variant adults should be referred for an 
ASD diagnostic assessment as they scored > 6 on the AQ-10 
(Allison et al., 2012).

Prevalence of ASD Traits

To examine the prevalence of ASD traits in GD/GI cohorts, 
researchers  have  used  parent-/self-report  measures  that 
index  ASD  characteristics.  VanderLaan,  Postema,  et  al. 
(2015) and Zucker et al. (2017) assessed circumscribed pre-
occupations and intense interests (one diagnostic feature of 
ASD) in children referred to a gender identity clinic, using 
the items 9 and 66 from the CBCL or Teacher’s Report Form. 
Both  studies  found  elevated  obsession  in  gender-referred 
children, compared to nonreferred and clinic-referred chil-
dren. A significant increase in compulsion was reported in 
gender-referred children, compared to nonreferred children 
only.

Van der Miesen, de Vries, et al. (2018) used the Children’s 
Social  Behavior  Questionnaire  to  examine  the  prevalence 
of ASD  traits  in  children  diagnosed  with  GID.  The  study 
found  significantly  increased  ASD  traits  in  children  with 
GID,  compared  to  non-autistic  control  children.  Another 
study compared children who satisfied the diagnostic crite-
ria for GD to non-autistic controls, using the Social Respon-
siveness Scale (SRS; Akgül et al., 2018). The study found 
that  the  GD  group  had  significantly  more ASD  traits  than 
the control group. Notwithstanding, when Leef et al. (2019) 
used the same measure to compare children diagnosed with 
GID, GD, or gender identity disorder not otherwise speci-
fied (GID-NOS) with clinic-referred children no difference 
was  found  in  parent-reported ASD  traits.  However,  when 
they employed the Social Communication Questionnaire to 
tap ASD traits, they did find elevated ASD traits in children 
with GID, GD, or GID-NOS. While the results of the afore-
mentioned studies seem to indicate an increased prevalence 
on ASD traits in GD children, the study of this topic in GD/
GI adults is less clear.

In  seven  out  of  the  eight  identified  studies  that  con-
tained  data  on  the  prevalence  of  ASD  traits  in  GD/GI 
adults, researchers have used the AQ to measure ASD traits. 
While  Jones  et  al.’s  (2012)  study  found  that  transgender 
men  reported  significantly  more ASD  traits  than  nonclini-
cal  males  and  females,  no  difference  was  found  between 
transgender women and either nonclinical males or females. 
Nobili  et  al.  (2018)  and  Murphy  et  al.  (2020)  replicated 
these findings. Likewise, Kung (2020) found that transgen-
der men and nonbinary females reported significantly more 

3107

ASD  traits  than  control  females  from  the  general  popula-
tion. However, no difference was observed between either 
transgender women or nonbinary males and control males 
from  the  general  population.  Vermaat  et  al.  (2018)  found 
that birth-assigned females referred for GD reported signifi-
cantly more ASD traits than control birth-assigned females. 
A  significant  difference  in  ASD  traits  was  also  found 
between  birth-assigned  females  referred  for  GD  and  one 
of  the  three  control  samples  of  birth-assigned  males  they 
used  (i.e.,  Dutch AQ  scores),  with  birth-assigned  females 
scoring  higher  than  birth-assigned  males.  Birth-assigned 
males  referred  for  GD  scored  significantly  lower  on  the 
AQ  than  control  birth-assigned  males  and  no  difference 
was  found  between  birth-assigned  males  referred  for  GD 
and  control  birth-assigned  females.  It  is  also  important  to 
mention that in Pasterski et al.’s (2014) study, transgender 
men diagnosed with GD/GID scored higher on the AQ-50 
than  nonclinical  birth-assigned  females,  but  the  difference 
was small (d = 0.31) and nonsignificant. In contrast, Stagg 
and Vincent (2019) reported a significant difference in the 
number  of  self-reported ASD  traits  between  groups,  with 
transgender and nonbinary individuals reporting more ASD 
traits than cisgender adults. The results were replicated by 
Warrier et al. (2020) in the largest study on this topic con-
ducted  to  date.  Using  a  different  self-report  measure  (i.e., 
the SRS), Heylens et al. (2018) also found increased ASD 
traits in adults diagnosed with GD, compared to a normative 
sample.

Part 2: Meta-Analyses of Studies of 
ASD Diagnoses and ASD Traits in GD/GI 
Individuals

Method

Sample of Studies

Our full study selection strategy is described in the method 
section of Part 1 and the inclusion criteria for the meta-anal-
ysis of studies of ASD diagnoses remained the same with 
the ones applied for the literature review (see Part 1). All the 
studies that reported quantitative results on the prevalence 
of  ASD  diagnoses  in  GD/GI  people  were  meta-analyzed. 
Warrier et al. (2020) reported evidence from five datasets, 
all  of  which  were  independent  from  each  other. As  such, 
we  decided  to  include  them  in  the  current  meta-analysis 
as  separate  studies.  Of  the  studies  that  reported  evidence 
about the prevalence of ASD traits, we excluded two stud-
ies  (i.e., VanderLaan,  Postema,  et  al.,  2015;  Zucker  et  al.,

2017) because they did not employ an ASD screening ques-
tionnaire. We also excluded Warrier et al.’s (2020) IMAGE 
and  LifeLines  datasets  because  the  data  reported  did  not 
allow  an  approximation  of  a  standardized  bias-corrected 
effect  size  to  be  calculated.  Lastly,  we  excluded  Leef  et 
al.’s (2019) study because their control group was selected 
from a clinical population. Jones et al. (2012) and Pasterski 
et al. (2014) took the data of their control group from the 
same source (i.e., Baron-Cohen et al., 2001). To satisfy the 
assumption of independence of effects in the current meta-
analysis, we decided to include Jones et al.’s (2012) study 
based  on  temporal  criteria.  Results  of  the  meta-analysis 
did not change substantively when Pasterski et al.’s (2014) 
study  was  included  instead  (see  Supplementary  Material). 
Also, results did not change substantively when we replaced 
Kung’s  (2020)  control  group  from  Baron-Cohen  et  al. 
(2014) with Ruzich et al's (2015), instead (see Supplemen-
tary Material).

Meta-Analytic Procedure

To  estimate  the  prevalence  of  ASD  diagnoses  in  GD/GI 
people, we conducted a meta-analysis of proportions. That 
is  a  widely  used  method  that  aims  to  provide  an  accurate 
estimate of the frequency of a condition (Barendregt et al., 
2013;  Lai  et  al.,  2019).  In  the  current  meta-analysis,  the 
event rate of GD/GI people with a diagnosis of ASD reported 
in each study was transformed into a logit event rate effect 
size  and  the  corresponding  standard  error  was  calculated. 
The transformed logit event rates were meta-analyzed using 
the inverse of the variance of each of the transformed rates 
as their study weight. The calculated pooled prevalence of 
ASD diagnoses in the GD/GI population and its confidence 
intervals were then retransformed into event rates (Lipsey 
& Wilson, 2001).

To conduct the meta-analysis of studies containing data 
on the prevalence of ASD traits in GD/GI individuals, we 
used Cohen’s d as an index of standardized mean difference 
in ASD  traits  between  GD/GI  and  nonclinical/population-
based control participants. Cohen’s d was calculated based 
on means and standard deviations provided by the authors, 
using Lipsey and Wilson’s (2001) web-based effect size cal-
culator. When means and standard deviations were reported 
only  separately  for  birth-assigned  males  at  birth-assigned 
females within each group, combined means and standard 
deviations  were  calculated  using  the  standard  mean  and 
standard deviation formula (Altman et al., 2000). The same 
formula was also used to combine the groups of transgender 
and nonbinary people included in Kung’s (2020) study into 
a single group.

To control for an overestimation of Cohen’s d effect size 
in studies with small sample size, we calculated Hedges’g 

(Hedges,  1981;  Hedges  &  Olkin,  1985). This  is  the  unbi-
ased version of Cohen’s d and is interpreted in a similar way 
as  Cohen’s  d  (i.e.,  g ≥ 0.20 = small  effect,  g ≥ 0.50 = mod-
erate  effect,  g ≥ 0.80 = large  effect;  Cohen,  1988).  Inverse 
variance weights were applied to effect sizes to control for 
sample size differences between studies (Borenstein et al., 
2009;  Lipsey  &Wilson,  2001).  95%  confidence  intervals 
were computed as an index of variation of the estimate and 
the significance of the mean effect size.

The studies we selected to include in the current meta-
analyses  cannot  be  considered  functionally  equivalent, 
as they utilize a range of measures, samples, and settings. 
Therefore,  we  used  a  random-effects  model  to  compute  a 
weighted pooled estimate of the prevalence of ASD diagno-
ses in GD/GI individuals and a weighted mean effect size of 
the difference in ASD traits between GD/GI and nonclinical/
population-based control participants (e.g., Borenstein et al., 
2009; Lipsey & Wilson 2001; Pigott & Polanin, 2020). In 
the meta-analysis of studies of ASD traits, a positive effect 
size  indicates  that  relative  to  nonclinical/population-based 
control people, GD/GI individuals have more ASD traits.

To quantify heterogeneity in effect sizes (or else variation 
in the true effect sizes) a series of measures were employed. 
We used the Q statistic to test the hypothesis that the true 
effect size is the same across studies. A significant p-value 
provides evidence that studies included in the meta-analysis 
do not share a common effect size. To examine what propor-
tion  of  the  observed  variance  reflects  variation  in  the  true 
effect sizes rather than sampling error, we calculated I2 val-
ues  and  to  identify  how  much  the  true  effects  vary  across 
studies we estimated prediction intervals (Borenstein et al., 
2009; Borenstein et al., 2017; Higgins et al., 2003).

To examine potential sources of heterogeneity, we con-
ducted a series of random-effects categorical analyses and 
meta-regression  analyses.  In  the  categorical  analyses  we 
conducted,  we  compared  prevalence  estimates  of  ASD 
diagnoses  and  mean  differences  in  ASD  traits  between 
clinical-based  and  population-based  studies.  In  clinical-
based  studies  participants  were  recruited  primarily  from 
specialized clinics providing care to GD/GI individuals. In 
population-based studies, participants were recruited either 
randomly from the general population or from health care 
consortiums. Prevalence estimates of ASD diagnoses were 
also compared among studies that included people referred 
to  clinics/services  for  gender-related  issues  (mainly  GD), 
studies  that  included  people  who  met  diagnostic  criteria 
or had a diagnosis of GD, GID, or GID-NOS, and studies 
that included GI people. Furthermore, mean differences in 
ASD  traits  were  compared  between  studies  that  used  pri-
mary sources of data for the control group and studies that 
used secondary sources. Lastly, we compared mean differ-
ences in ASD traits between studies that included primarily 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:3103–31171 3children (mean age < 18) and studies that included primarily 
adults (mean age > 18). In the meta-regression analysis we 
conducted, we examined the effect of age (mean) and per-
centage of birth-assigned males in the prevalence estimates 
of ASD diagnoses in GD/GI people.

If data were missing for a potential moderator, that study 
was  excluded  from  the  analysis. When  mean  age  was  not 
reported, the midpoint between the minimum and maximum 
of the age range was calculated (Lai et al., 2019; Loomes 
et  al.,  2017).  If  the  mean  age  was  reported  separately  for 
birth-assigned males at birth-assigned females, a combined 
mean was calculated using the standard mean and standard 
deviation formula (Altman et al., 2000). In the absence of a 
good rationale and a solid theoretical background to assume 
that there will be greater variation in one group compared to 
the other group, we used a pooled estimate of variance com-
ponent to conduct our categorical analyses (e.g., Borenstein 
et al., 2009).

To  detect  the  effect  of  publication  bias,  we  conducted 
a  cumulative  meta-analysis.  Studies  were  added  one  by 
one  based  on  their  N  (largest  to  smallest),  and  a  cumula-
tive meta-analysis was performed with the addition of each 
study. An increase in the mean effect size with the addition 
of smaller studies provide evidence for bias (e.g., Borenstein 
et al., 2009). Lastly, a one-study-removed analysis was con-
ducted to assess the influence of any one particular study on 
the results of the meta-analyses. All the analyses described 
above were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analy-
sis Software Version 3 (CMA; Borenstein et al., 2013), and 
prediction  intervals  were  calculated  using  the  spreadsheet 
prepared by Borenstein (2019).

using  a  random-effects  model  (see  Table  S3).  Of  the  25 
studies, 12 were conducted primarily with adults, three were 
conducted primarily with adolescents, nine were conducted 
primarily with children and adolescents, and one was con-
ducted with children. Results from the analysis revealed that 
the  pooled  prevalence  estimate  of ASD  diagnoses  in  GD/
GI  individuals  was  0.11. The  95%  confidence  interval  for 
the pooled prevalence estimate were 0.08 to 0.16 (z = -9.43, 
p < .001). A forest plot for this meta-analysis is depicted in 
Fig. 2.

The Q-value was 735.61, df = 24, p < .001, indicating that 
the  effect  sizes  included  in  the  analysis  were  significantly 
different  from  each  other.  The  I2  statistic  was  96.74,  sug-
gesting that 96.74% of the variance in the observed effects 
reflects variance in true effects, rather than sampling error. 
The  variance  of  true  effects  (Tau2)  was  1.11,  the  standard 
deviation of true effects (Tau) was 1.05, and the prediction 
interval was 0.01 to 0.54. Results indicate very substantial 
levels  of  heterogeneity.  To  investigate  the  sources  of  this

of ASD diagnoses in GD/GI individuals ranged from 0.10 
to 0.12 (see Fig. S2).

Difference in ASD Traits Between GD/GI and Control 
Individuals

A total of 4,664 GD/GI participants and 494,791 nonclini-
cal/population-based  control  participants  from  11  studies 
were included in the meta-analysis of studies of ASD traits 
using  a  random-effects  model  (see  Table  S4).  Of  the  11 
studies,  three  were  conducted  primarily  with  children  and 
adolescents and eight were conducted primarily with adults. 
Results from the analysis revealed that the weighted stan-
dardized  mean  difference  in  the  number  of  reported ASD 
traits  between  GD/GI  and  nonclinical/population-based 
control  participants  was  moderate,  g = 0.67  (SE = 0.15). 
On average, GD/GI people reported more ASD traits than 
nonclinical/population-based control participants. The 95% 

Moderation Analysis

As Table  1  shows,  both  participant  type  and  study  design 
were significant categorical moderators.

Specifically,  the  prevalence  estimate  of ASD  diagnoses 
was higher among GI participants than among people with 
a  diagnosis  of  GD/GID/GID-NOS  and  people  referred  to 
specialized  clinics  for  GD.  Furthermore,  the  prevalence 
estimate  from  clinical-based  studies  was  lower  than  that 
from  population-based  studies.  However,  the  univariable 
meta-regression analyses we conducted showed that neither 
the mean age of participants (Qmodel = 0.38, df = 1, p = .539; 
Qresidual = 692.73, df = 22, I2 = 96.60, p < .001; R2 = 0.00) nor 
the percentage of birth-assigned males in the sample (Qmodel 
= 0.37, df = 1, p = .542; Qresidual = 84.44, df = 15, I2 = 81.81, 
p < .001;  R2 = 0.00)  significantly  predicted  the  prevalence 
estimate of ASD diagnoses.

Publication Bias

To  examine  the  impact  of  publication  bias  we  conducted 
a  cumulative  meta-analysis.  We  found  that  the  point  esti-
mate increased when studies with smaller sample sizes were 
included (see Fig. S1). Although this provides evidence that 
studies with small sample size introduced bias, it should be 
noted that even if the meta-analysis had been limited to the 
first 10 largest studies (N > 200), the pooled prevalence esti-
mate of ASD diagnoses in GD/GI people would have been 
0.08 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.13).

Sensitivity Analysis

Conducting  a  one  study  removed  analysis,  we  found  that 
none of the studies had a strong influence on the results of 
the  meta-analysis. The  pooled  estimates  of  the  prevalence

confidence  interval  for  the  standardized  mean  difference 
was 0.37 to 0.96 (z = 4.38, p < .001). A forest plot for this 
meta-analysis is depicted in Fig. 3.

The Q-value was 608.03 (df = 10, p < .001), indicating that 
the true effect size is not identical in all studies. The I2 statis-
tic was 98.36, which tells us that the 98.36% of the variance 
in observed effects reflects variance in true error rather than 
sampling error. The variance of true effects (Tau2) was 0.24, 
the  standard  deviation  of  true  effects  (Tau)  was  0.49,  and 
the prediction interval was − 0.50 to 1.83. Results indicate 
very substantial levels of heterogeneity. To investigate the 
sources of this heterogeneity, three random-effects categori-
cal analyses were conducted.

Moderation Analysis

As  Table  2  shows,  none  of  the  categorical  variables  we 
examined were significant moderators.

Specifically, there was not a significant difference in the 
mean  effect  size  between  studies  that  used  secondary  and 
primary  sources  of  data  for  their  control  groups.  In  both 
cases, GD/GI participants showed elevated ASD traits com-
pared  to  nonclinical/population-based  control  participants. 
Likewise,  no  significant  difference in  the  mean  effect size 
was found either between clinical-based studies and popu-
lation-based  studies,  or  between  studies  conducted  among 
children and studies conducted among adult cohorts.

Publication Bias

To examine the impact of publication bias we conducted a 
cumulative meta-analysis. We found that the point estimate 
did  not  increase  when  studies  with  smaller  sample  sizes 
(N < 200)  were  included  (see  Fig.  S3).  This  indicates  that 
there  is  no  reason  to  assume  that  the  inclusion  of  studies 
with smaller sample size has smaller studies has introduced 
bias.

Sensitivity Analysis

Conducting a one study removed analysis showed that none 
of  the  studies  had  a  strong  influence  on  the  results  of  the 
meta-analysis. The overall weighted effect sizes of the dif-
ference in the number of reported ASD traits between GD/
GI  and  nonclinical/population-based  control  participants 
ranged from 0.61 to 0.75 (see Fig. S4).

Discussion

The review of the evidence presented in Part 1 as well as 
the evidence from the meta-analyses presented in Part 2 are 

3111

suggestive of a link between ASD and GD/GI. The literature 
review,  specifically,  provided  consistent  evidence  about  a 
positive relationship between ASD traits and GD feelings in 
the general population (e.g., George & Stokes, 2018b; Kal-
litsounaki & Williams, 2020) and a high prevalence of GD/
GI  in  autistic  individuals  (e.g.,  George  &  Stokes,  2018b; 
Hisle-Gorman et al., 2019; Pecora et al., 2020). However, 
we should note that despite the consistency of the findings, 
research in these populations is sparse. The bulk of research 
has  focused  on  the  prevalence  of ASD/ASD  traits  in  GD/
GI people.

From the studies we reviewed it was estimated that the 
positive  rates  for  ASD  caseness  in  GD/GI  people  range 
from  1.2  to  68%  (e.g., Akgül  et  al.,  2018;  Vermaat  et  al., 
2018).  Nonetheless,  the  variation  in ASD  screening  ques-
tionnaires (e.g., AQ, SRS, etc.) and cutoff points used (e.g., 
AQ score > 26 in some studies, over 32 in other studies etc.) 
across different studies does not allow us to make accurate 
interpretations  of  these  findings.  In  contrast,  the  evidence 
about the rates of  autistic GD/GI  people was  less  obscure 
and  showed  an  increased  prevalence  of  ASD  diagnoses 
in  this  population  (e.g.,  Akgül  et  al.,  2018;  Kristensen 
&  Broome,  2015;  Skagerberg  et  al.,  2015;  Warrier  et  al., 
2020).  Likewise,  the  results  of  the  meta-analysis  we  con-
ducted indicated that ASD frequently occurs in GD/GI indi-
viduals.  Specifically,  the  prevalence  of ASD  diagnoses  in 
this  population  was  11  times  higher  than  the ASD  preva-
lence estimate of approximately 1% in the general popula-
tion (e.g., Lai et al., 2014). We should note, however, that 
the prediction intervals of the prevalence estimate were very 
wide, indicating that not all GD/GI people are affected by 
ASD to the same degree. Based on the characteristics of the 
literature  pertaining  to  the  prevalence  of ASD  diagnoses/
ASD  traits  in  GD/GI  individuals,  as  discussed  hereunder, 
wide prediction intervals were expected.

Furthermore,  the  findings  we  reviewed  indicated  that 
GD/GI  children  have  higher ASD  traits  than  control  chil-
dren  (e.g.,  Akgül  et  al.,  2018;  Skagerberg  et  al.,  2015). 
Yet, mixed evidence emerged about the difference in ASD 
traits  between  GD/GI  adults  and  nonclinical/population-
based  control  adults  (e.g.,  Nobili  et  al.,  2018;  Stagg  & 
Vincent, 2019; Warrier et al., 2020). Results of the second 
meta-analysis we conducted yielded a moderate (g = 0.67) 
and  significant  difference  in  the  number  of  reported ASD 
traits  between  GD/GI  and  control  individuals,  indicating 
a high prevalence of ASD traits among GD/GI people. As 
expected, the prediction intervals were very wide denoting 
that not all GD/GI people report high and clinically signifi-
cant levels of ASD traits.

An  important  point  to  make  is  that  we  investigated  the 
impact  of  a  number  of  potential  methodological  modera-
tors  on  the  prevalence  estimate  of ASD  diagnoses  in  GD/

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:3103–31171 33112

GI  people  and  on  the  mean  difference  in  the  number  of 
ASD traits between GD/GI and control individuals. Results 
showed that the study design and participant type were the 
only significant moderators. The prevalence of ASD diagno-
ses was lower in clinical-based studies than in population-
based studies. Also, the prevalence of ASD diagnoses was 
lower  in  people  who  met  the  diagnostic  criteria  or  had  a 
diagnosis of GD/GID/GID-NOS and people referred to gen-
der clinics than in GI people. We should mention here that in 
clinical-based studies and studies that included people with 
a diagnosis or symptoms of GD information about the diag-
nosis  of ASD  was  collected  through  medical  records  and 
in most of the studies the diagnosis was verified, whereas 
in studies that included GI people from the general popula-
tion information was collected mainly through self-reports. 
This suggests that the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in GI 
people might be overestimated when ASD diagnosis is self-
reported and that clinical-based studies might provide more 
precise  estimates.  Alternative  explanations,  however,  are 
also possible (e.g., underdiagnosis of ASD in gender iden-
tity clinics/services).

To further understand and place the findings of the meta-
analyses in context, a number of limitations are discussed. 
In both meta-analyses, the effect sizes varied substantially 
across  studies.  Although  we  attempted  to  identify  factors 
that  contribute  to  this  variation,  only  two  of  the  modera-
tion analyses we conducted yielded significant results. We 
should note, however, that some of the categorical modera-
tion analyses in this study were underpowered (Borenstein 
et al., 2009; Fu et al., 2011). Therefore, the absence of sta-
tistical  significance  does  not  provide  strong  evidence  that 
the  factors  we  examined  do  not  have  a  contributing  role 
in  the  observed  variation.  Furthermore,  it  is  important  to 
stress that the 95% prediction intervals were wide in both 
meta-analyses. This indicates that some of the future stud-
ies on this topic will find effect sizes that denote an overlap 
between ASD and GD/GI, yet other studies will not find sim-
ilar results. Of course, high heterogeneity does not reduce 
the quality or the importance of a meta-analysis. Rather, it 
determines the conclusions that can be drawn from the find-
ings and provides a better understanding of the phenomenon 
under investigation (Berlin, 1995; Lau et al., 1998).

The  high  heterogeneity  observed  in  the  current  meta-
analyses  was  not  surprising,  as  it  is  common  in  meta-
analyses that focus on ASD or GD/GI (e.g., Arcelus et al., 
2015; Lai et al., 2019; Loomes et al., 2017). It likely reflects 
some  fundamental  limitations  of  the  literature  pertaining 
to  the  prevalence  of ASD  diagnoses/ASD  traits  in  GD/GI 
individuals.  First,  the  targeted  population  cannot  be  con-
sidered  homogeneous,  as  it  includes  transgender  people, 
nonbinary individuals, people formally diagnosed with GD, 
and people who do not conform to the societal expectations 

of their birth-assigned sex and may or may not present GD 
feelings. Future studies might usefully apply stricter eligi-
bility criteria to elucidate which of the aforementioned cat-
egories are most influenced by ASD. Of equal importance 
is  another  limitation  identified  through  the  current  study. 
That is the paucity of studies that have employed standard-
ized  diagnostic  measures  of ASD  to  identify  autistic  GD/
GI individuals. The vast majority of information about the 
prevalence  of ASD  diagnoses  in  this  population  has  been 
collected from patient files or it is obtained by self-reports. 
As such, essential information about the diagnosis itself is 
missing.  In  future  studies,  it  might  be  useful  to  collect  a 
copy of the diagnostic report, or when this is not possible, 
to collect information about the type of clinician who diag-
nosed  ASD,  the  exact  diagnosis  received,  and  the  age  of 
diagnosis. Along with a formal diagnosis of ASD, standard-
ized diagnostic tools (e.g., Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule  and Autism  Diagnostic  Interview-Revised;  Lord 
et  al.,  2000;  Rutter  et  al.,  2003)  could  also  be  used  in  an 
attempt  to  elucidate  the  high  heterogeneity  we  observe  in 
the prevalence of ASD diagnoses in this population.

We should also note that although results of the second 
meta-analysis  indicate  an  increased  prevalence  of  ASD 
traits in GD/GI people, further research is required to exam-
ine whether non-autistic GD/GI people have increased ASD 
traits. To date, only four studies have examined this hypoth-
esis. This was achieved either by excluding GD/GI people 
with  a  diagnosis  of  ASD  and  reanalyzing  the  data  or  by 
including only non-autistic GD/GI people in their samples 
(i.e., Akgül et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 
2020; Warrier et al., 2020). It is also important to examine 
potential sex and/or gender differences in the prevalence of 
ASD traits in GD/GI people.

Taken  together,  results  from  the  literature  review  and 
the  meta-analyses  indicate  that  the  chances  there  is  not  a 
link between ASD and GD/GI are negligible, yet absolute 
conclusions  about  the  size  of  the  link  cannot  be  drawn.  It 
is well established that both autistic and GD/GI individuals 
are at increased risk of mental health conditions and suicidal 
behavior  (e.g.,  Grant  et  al.,  2011;  Hirvikoski  et  al.,  2016; 
Hofvander et al., 2009; Holt et al., 2016). When ASD and 
GD/GI  co-occur  in  a  person,  it  is  possible  that  the  risk  to 
mental health is multiplied. Thus, it is important to under-
stand that link. It is still unclear, for example, whether the 
overlap  between  ASD  and  GD/GI  reflects  true  co-occur-
rence.  As  Williams  (2017,  p.  274)  noted,  “just  because 
behaviorally-defined disorders A and B co-occur in a person 
does not mean that the underlying causes of those disorders 
are the same as the causes of A or B in isolation”.

One explanation for the co-occurrence of ASD with GD/
GI is that some of the core features of ASD predispose an 
individual to develop GD feelings or disidentify with their

between these conditions (e.g., Leef et al., 2019). For exam-
ple, autistic people’s difficulty to representing mental states 
(namely  mentalizing;  e.g.,  Yirmiya  et  al.,  1998)  has  been 
proposed as one of the mechanisms that could explain the 
link between ASD and GD/GI (Glidden et al., 2016; Jacobs 
et al., 2014; van der Miesen et al., 2016). Recent studies have 
provided some tentative, preliminary evidence in support of 
this hypothesis (Kallitsounaki & Williams, 2020; Kallitsou-
naki  et  al.,  2021).  Of  course,  reverse  causal  relationships 
among ASD, GD/GI, and mentalizing are certainly possible 
(R. J. Walsh, personal communication, 8 September, 2020) 
and, therefore, these links need further investigation.

Furthermore,  future  research  might  usefully  investigate 
the development of gender identity in ASD (van Schalkwyk 
et al., 2015). Research on this topic is surprisingly limited 
and  many  questions  remain  unanswered.  For  example,  it 
is  unclear  whether  the  development  of  gender  identity  in 
autistic and non-autistic children follows the same cognitive 
and developmental pathways. This is important, because it 
could  provide  a  unique  insight  into  the  mechanisms  that 
are involved in the formation and consolidation of gender 
identity in cisgender and GD/GI individuals. We also hope 
that  by  establishing  a  link  between ASD  and  GD/GI,  the 
current article will give new impetus to future research on 
the size of the link and on potential mechanisms that could 
explain  this  phenomenon. Although  a  number  of  explana-
tions  have  been  suggested  for  the  co-occurrence  of  ASD 
and GD/GI (see van der Miesen et al., 2016, for a review), 
there is a paucity of research on them. Establishing that the 
link  between ASD  and  GD/GI  is  “real”  at  the  behavioral 
and cognitive level, will allow clinicians to start tracking the 
outcomes of treatment/support at a more fine-grained level 
(i.e., by group), rather than as a whole. Ultimately, this will 
promote the development of tailored services and interven-
tions for autistic GD/GI people.

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  high  co-occurrence 
between ASD and GD/GI is underrecognized among health 
care  professionals  (Murphy  &  Livesey,  2017).  Evidence 
about a link between ASD and GD/GI might stimulate the 
development of appropriate trainings to raise their awareness 
(Strauss,  et  al.,  2021),  so  that  GD/GI  people  are  screened 
for ASD and autistic people for gender related issues (Mah-
fouda  et  al.,  2019;  Strang,  Meagher,  et  al.,  2018).  Gen-
der  related  issues  in  autistic  people  could  be  detected  by 
using self/parent-report measures, such as the GIDYQ-AA 
(Deogracias et al., 2007) and the Gender Identity Question-
naire for Children (Johnson et al., 2004) and by including a 
few gender related questions on a clinical intake form or a 
clinical interview (Strang, Meagher, et al., 2018). We should 
note, however, that these self-/parent-report measures have 
not been validated in the autistic population, so they should 

3113

be  used  with  caution. Autistic  people  with  suspected  GD 
should be referred to gender specialists for further assess-
ment and support (Strang, Meagher, et al., 2018). It is essen-
tial to provide timely support and care to these people, as the 
burden they suffer seems to be doubly distressing (George 
& Stokes, 2018a; Hall et al., 2020).

Conclusions

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  most  up-to-date  systematic 
review of the literature pertaining the overlap between ASD 
and GD/GI, and it is also the first meta-analysis of the prev-
alence of ASD diagnoses and ASD traits in GD/GI people. 
The findings of the current literature review and meta-anal-
yses suggest that there is (a) a positive relationship between 
ASD traits and GD/GI feelings among people from the gen-
eral population, (b) an increased prevalence of GD/GI in the 
autistic population, and (c) an increased prevalence of ASD 
diagnoses and ASD traits in the GD/GI population. Overall, 
these findings suggest the existence of a link between ASD 
and  GD/GI  that  warrants  the  investigation  of  mechanisms 
that could explain that link and the intensification of clinical 
attention to autistic GD/GI individuals.
