Abstract

Background: Readiness to change is a pivotal construct for psychotherapy research and a major target of motivational
interventions. Our primary objective was to examine whether pre-treatment readiness to change moderated therapy
effects of Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology (BRIA), an innovative psychotherapy approach for surgical patients.
This stepped care program aims at motivating and supporting surgical patients with mental disorders to engage in
psychosocial mental health care.

Methods: The major steps of BRIA are two motivational interventions with different intensity. The first step of the
program consists of preoperative computer-assisted psychosocial self-assessment including screening for psychological
distress and automatically composed computerized brief written advice (BWA). In the second step, patients participate in
postoperative psychotherapy sessions combining motivational interviewing with cognitive behavioural therapy (BRIA
psychotherapy sessions).
We performed regression-based moderator analyses on data from a recent randomized controlled trial published by our
research group. The sample comprised 220 surgical patients with diverse comorbid mental disorders according to ICD-10.
The most frequent disorders were mood, anxiety, substance use and adjustment disorders. The patients had a mean age
of 43.31 years, and 60.90% were women. In a regression model adjusted for pre-treatment psychological distress, we
investigated whether readiness to change moderated outcome differences between (1) the BRIA psychotherapy sessions
and (2) no psychotherapy / BWA only.
Results: Multiple regression analyses showed that readiness to change moderated treatment effects regarding the
primary outcomes "Participation in psychosocial mental health care options at month 6" (p = 0.03) and "Having approached
psychosocial mental health care options at month 6" (p = 0.048) but not regarding the secondary outcome "Change of
general psychological distress between baseline assessment and month 6" (p = 0.329). Probing the moderation effect with
the Johnson-Neyman technique revealed that BRIA psychotherapy sessions were superior to BWA in patients with low to
moderate readiness, but not in those with high readiness.

Conclusions: Readiness to change may act as moderator of the efficacy of psychosocial therapy. Combinations of
motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy may be effective particularly in patients with a variety of
mental disorders and low readiness to change.

Background
The transtheoretical model of change (TTM) comprises
five stages that people move through when they experi-
ence behaviour changes, pre-contemplation, contempla-
tion, preparation, action, and maintenance, each of them
contributing to the multifaceted construct of motiv-
ational readiness to change [1–4]. We applied this
central component of the TTM to explore the relations
between pre-treatment stages of change and treatment
outcomes of Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology
(BRIA), an innovative transdiagnostic psychotherapy ap-
proach addressing surgical patients with comorbid men-
tal disorders [5, 6]. This stepped care program aims at
motivating and supporting patients from diverse surgical
fields and with diverse mental disorders to engage in
psychosocial mental health care options. BRIA combines
different therapy elements of computer-assisted screen-
ing for psychological distress and brief intervention [7],
motivational interviewing (MI) [8–10], cognitive behav-
ioural therapy (CBT), and social casework (Table 1). The
two major steps of BRIA are two motivational interven-
tions with different intensity. The first step of the pro-
gram consists
computer-assisted
psychosocial self-assessment including screening for psy-
chological distress and automatically composed comput-
erized brief written advice (BWA). In the second step,
patients participate in postoperative psychotherapy ses-
sions combining MI and CBT (BRIA psychotherapy ses-
sions). Whereas the BRIA psychotherapy sessions have a
strong focus on MI, the computerized BWA can be con-
sidered as a weak motivational intervention because it
does not involve therapy sessions but includes automat-
ically composed detailed, individually tailored feedback
of test results indicating psychological distress and,
if
required, general suggestions concerning therapy and
behavior changes (Table 1). Readiness to change is a
major target of motivational interventions [8, 9], and the
question arises whether these two motivational interven-
tions with different intensity show different efficacy in
patients with varying degrees of motivation to change.

preoperative

of

Numerous psychotherapy studies have shown positive
associations between higher motivation to change and
treatment outcomes [3, 11–18]. Other studies, however,

reported no, ambiguous or even negative associations
[19–27]. The TTM aims to contribute to the development
of interventions that are adapted to the patients’ readiness
to change. Moreover, the stages of change have been con-
ceived as being relevant across diverse problem areas and
mental disorders [3, 28, 29]. Despite this basically trans-
diagnostic approach,
the majority of psychotherapy
research on stages of change has been carried out in the
context of treatment of substance use disorders and eating
disorders; far fewer studies exist concerning psychother-
apy of other mental disorders [3, 13, 15, 16, 18, 30–32].
Theoretical models assume that motivation to change acts
as a moderator of the efficacy of psychosocial therapy.
However, previous treatment outcome research showed con-
flicting results [11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23–25, 27, 32–41].
The findings of several studies suggest that motivational
readiness to change is positively associated with pretreatment
severity of problems and symptoms of those disorders for
which patients seek therapy [21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 31]. Hence,
we argue that the relations between readiness to change and
psychotherapy outcomes may also be influenced by baseline
psychological distress of patients.

This study aims to contribute to the clarification of
the role of readiness to change in transdiagnostic ther-
apy approaches by investigating its moderator effects on
therapy outcomes of BRIA. A previous pilot study con-
ducted by our research group showed feasibility of inte-
grating BRIA into a surgical setting [5]. Afterwards we
recently performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
including 220 participants. In this RCT, BRIA psycho-
therapy sessions proved to be superior to the compari-
son intervention which did not include therapy sessions
and consisted only of brief written computerized advice
(BWA) based on patients’ results of computer-assisted
screening for psychological distress in the first step of
the program [6]. The primary outcome of the RCT was
participation in psychosocial mental healthcare options
at month 6, and the secondary outcome was change of
self-reported general psychological distress between
baseline and month 6, as measured with the Global
Severity Index (GSI) of the questionnaire Brief Symptom
Inventory (BSI [42, 43]) [6]. Concerning the primary out-
come of the RCT, patients of the BRIA psychotherapy

without requiring any input from keyboard
(cid:129) Duration: Approximately 25 min per patient
(cid:129) Items: Standardized psychological screening tests and single items
concerning psychological distress, as well as social, lifestyle and
psychological factors related to mental health and psychosocial therapy

Objective

(cid:129) To offer computerized tailored BWA to all participants of the screening

Topics of BWA

(cid:129) For patients without clinically significant psychological
distress: Positive feedback of screening test results
indicating healthy lifestyle
(cid:129) For patients with clinically significant psychological distress:
Detailed, individually tailored feedback of test results
indicating psychological distress; if required suggestions
concerning therapy and behavior changes
(cid:129) Domains: Depression, anxiety, general psychological
distress, substance use problems (alcohol, illicit drugs,
tobacco), well-being, quality of life, other health factors
like weight, sleep and physical exercise

Step II: BRIA psychotherapy sessions for patients with comorbid mental disorders

Components

(cid:129) Inpatient therapy sessions during hospital stay, outpatient sessions
after discharge
(cid:129) Bedside visits and sessions in therapy rooms
(cid:129) Duration up to 50 min per session
(cid:129) Outpatient BRIA sessions up to 3 months postoperatively, booster
sessions up to 6 months postoperatively

Objectives

(cid:129) To motivate patients with mental disorders and support them in
participating in subsequent psychosocial health care options
(cid:129) To initiate the improvement of patients’ psychological symptoms
and well-being

sessions group demonstrated a significantly increased
engagement in subsequent psychosocial mental health
care options at month 6 with an engagement rate of 30%
compared with 11.8% in BWA only, resulting in a rela-
tive risk reduction of 0.21 and a number needed to treat
of 6. Participants of BRIA psychotherapy sessions and
BWA did not differ regarding the categories of psycho-
social mental health care that they engaged in. The most
frequent category was psychotherapy (52.2%), followed
by psychosocial counselling (41.3%), self-help groups
(4.3%), and psychiatric treatment (2.2%) [6]. Concerning
the secondary outcome, BRIA psychotherapy sessions
had a small but significant effect on the improvement of
psychological distress, as measured with the BSI-GSI,
between
follow-up. To
summarize, first results suggest feasibility and efficacy of
BRIA [5, 6]. As an important next step, moderator ana-
lyses should follow.

clinical characteristics in a semistructured clinical inter-
view and made diagnoses of mental disorders according
to ICD-10. They used the Short Diagnostic Interview for
Mental Disorders (MiniDIPS [44]), a German extended
adaptation of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule
[45]. The MiniDIPS
obsessive-
compulsive, trauma-related, mood, adjustment, somato-
form, eating, as well as substance use disorders. Add-
itionally,
there are screening questions for psychotic
disorders. When the interview results suggested disor-
ders that were not covered sufficiently by the MiniDIPS,
therapists assessed the symptoms as well as time and
impairment criteria by free exploration and made ad-
equate diagnoses according to the ICD-10, e.g. in case of
personality disorders or psychological and behavioural
factors associated with disorders or diseases classified
elsewhere (ICD F54). After having completed postopera-
tive baseline diagnostic procedures, the patients were
randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the

two study interventions: (1) The BRIA psychotherapy
sessions (n = 110); (2) no additional
intervention after
the BWA (n = 110). The full details of the setting, patient
recruitment, randomization, concealment of allocation
and blinding, psychological and medical measurements,
sample size calculation, data collection and analyses, as
well as results of primary analyses are available in our
previous publication [6].

Patients
In total, 220 patients from diverse surgical fields and
with diverse mental disorders were included (Fig. 1). As
shown in Table 3, the intervention groups did not differ
significantly regarding demographic and clinical baseline
characteristics. The mean BSI-GSI score indicating gen-
eral psychological distress was 0.86 in both groups, and
the most frequent mental disorders were mood, anxiety,
substance use, and adjustment disorders.

Concerning preoperative physical health and medical
comorbidity, the majority of the patients was evaluated
as healthy or having mild systemic disease according to
the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
classification (ASA) [46, 47], and as having no or low
comorbidity according to the Charlson Comorbidity
Index (CCI) [48]. Participation in the RCT was not re-
stricted to any specific surgeries, and there was a slightly
lower percentage of patients being treated in neuro-,
head and neck surgery, as compared to abdomino-
thoracic and peripheral surgery. The majority of surgical
procedures was minor and moderate, while about 40% of
surgeries were evaluated as major or major plus according
to the operative severity item of the Physiological and
Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality
and Morbidity (POSSUM) [49, 50].

computer-assisted psychosocial

Interventions and therapists
Brief written computerized advice (BWA)
Surgical patients undergoing preoperative clinical exam-
ination by an anesthesiologist participated in a preopera-
tive
self-assessment.
Immediately after the completion of the self-assessment,
the patients’ data were analyzed automatically and all
patients received a computerized,
individually tailored
detailed feedback on their screening results in the form
of a computer printout. This intervention was computer-
ized and was not performed by psychotherapists. The
BWA included for patients with elevated psychological
distress general suggestions concerning therapy and
behavior changes (Table 1). The screening tests com-
prised the questionnaires World Health Organization 5-
item Well-Being Index (WHO-5, [51]), Patient Health
Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4, [52]), Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS, [53]), Alcohol Use Disorder
[54]), as well as several

single-item questions concerning sociodemographic, life-
style and clinical characteristics which are available from
the authors upon reasonable request
(Table 2). The
BWA was programmed as web application with a tech-
nology using the server scripting language php and the
database system MySQL.

Patients received two printouts, a short written letter
and a page with a table of their individual questionnaire
scores and information on the applied questionnaires
and cut-off values. The automatically composed sections
of the BWA letter were based on the individual self-
assessment responses of the patients, and the text was
explicitly formulated in a careful and considerate way in
order to prevent inducing resistance and anger. In the
main part of the letter, the individual symptoms were
described and explained. Patients with scores above the
cut-off were informed that their current elevated distress
could be temporary and might decrease by itself. How-
ever, in case that it would persist for a longer period of
time, patients were advised to consult
their general
practitioner to get to know and discuss possible treat-
ment options. Finally, they were encouraged to show the
table with their test results in potential appointments
with health care professionals.

BRIA psychotherapy sessions
Major
stepped care
elements of
therapeutic
approach of BRIA are displayed in Table 1. Whereas
patients in the BWA group received only the screening
and brief written advice intervention according to step 1,
the BRIA psychotherapy group had the possibility to
participate in psychotherapy sessions described in step 2.
BRIA sessions were provided by a team of certified psy-
chologists during inpatient hospital stay as well as in an
outpatient setting, either face-to-face or by telephone,
for a period of up to 3 months after discharge, with the
possibility of booster sessions up to 6 months, and a
maximum number of 12 sessions per patient. The inter-
vention was based on the principles and methods of MI
described by Miller & Rollnick (2002) [8] and Arkowitz
et al. (2008) [9]. Therapists explored the patients’ experi-
ence and perspectives concerning their mental disorders,
psychological distress, and problematic behavior, as well
as ambivalence concerning appropriate target behavior
change. The topics included motivation to engage in
subsequent therapy options, as well as change of individ-
ual problematic behavior, e.g. behavioural activation in
mood disorders or substance use reduction in substance
use disorders. Emphasis was placed on a client-centred
therapeutic
way of counselling,
alliance, expressing empathy and explicit activation of
patients’
resources, capacities and self-efficacy. The
treatment concept described therapy practice according
to the overall spirit of MI in terms of acceptance,

recognizing the patients’ autonomy and self-direction,
partnership, evocation and compassion. MI-specific
directive strategies and methods were used to elicit and
strengthen change talk, to prevent and decrease sustain
talk, to support self-efficacy and to roll with resistance.
Therapists switched from MI to more action-oriented
CBT methods when patients’ responses signalized that
they had decided to search for therapy options and
wanted to use the BRIA sessions to start first behavior
changes until the subsequent therapy would begin. In

this phase, therapists used diverse established manuals
for CBT of specific disorders, e.g. standard manuals for
depressive disorders [55], anxiety disorders [56–58], and
substance use disorders [59–61]. They chose basic inter-
ventions

who had decided to search for subsequent therapy, CBT
included also psychoeducation and information on
psychosocial mental health care options and teaching
and training of skills how to apply for treatment pro-
grams. Therapists practiced the CBT methods also in a
general way of the spirit of MI, so that a switch back to
explicit and specific MI strategies was feasible in times
when patients experienced again increased ambivalence.

sessions per patient was 3 with an interquartile range
(IQR) of 1 to 7. The median cumulative time spent in
therapy sessions amounted to 83.5 min per patient (IQR:
28.8 – 285.5), and the median duration of a session was
27.3 min (IQR: 12.3 – 52.1). Out of all sessions, 16%
were face-to-face during inpatient hospital stay, 56%
were face-to-face in an outpatient setting, 27% were by
telephone and 1% was done by email.

Therapists
A team of psychologists certified by diploma delivered
the BRIA sessions. Throughout the recruitment period,
the team consisted permanently of two to three thera-
pists and one supervising therapist. The total number of
therapists was seven, and the percentage of patients per
therapist ranged from 2.7% to 26.4%, with a median of

13.6%. They had a median age of 29 years (25 years to
42 years) and six of them were women. Five therapists
were participants of an advanced training program for
CBT, and one therapist participated in an advanced
training program for hypnotherapy. The supervising
therapist had practiced MI since more than 10 years,
had a licence for CBT for 7 years, as well as experience
in teaching and training of MI for psychotherapists,
medical health care professionals and medical students
for more than 6 years. The six therapists in training had
a median of 27.5 months of practical work experience in
clinical psychology (10 months to 68 months), and a
median of 17.25 months of practical experience in
psychotherapy (10 months to 32 months). They had
applied to an advertisement that described BRIA as a
combination of MI and CBT. In the job interview, po-
tential therapists were introduced to the BRIA concept
and asked to reflect whether they felt like practicing a
client-centred directive method of therapy. The training
took about 1 week. It consisted of a workshop, reviewing
of therapy videos, reading, as well as role-play with feed-
back from the supervisor and advanced therapists.
Throughout the recruitment period, there was a weekly
team meeting of approximately 2 h during which thera-
pists and the supervising therapist discussed relevant is-
sues of all current patients. Furthermore, therapists had
approximately 1 weekly individual supervision session.
During both the training and the supervision sessions,
the therapists and the supervisor discussed the process
of the sessions, the goals of patients and therapists, the
application of MI and/or CBT strategies and methods,
and how to practice a communication style in terms of
the general spirit of MI.

During their practical work, therapists used the basic
textbook of MI of Miller & Rollnick (2002) [8], as well
as the pivotal textbook edited by Arkowitz et al. (2008)
in
which introduced the

approach to apply MI

established CBT manuals for diverse mental disorders,
e.g. depression [55], anxiety disorders [56–58], and sub-

major focus on motivational interventions and to combine
them with CBT interventions as described above.

Measures
Motivational readiness to change
Readiness to change was measured at postoperative
baseline assessment with a German short version of the
University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA)
[62, 63]. The URICA consists of four subscales measur-
ing the change stages pre-contemplation, contemplation,
action, and maintenance; the preparation scale was elim-
inated during the development of the URICA because its
items loaded too high on the components measuring
contemplation and action [28, 29]. The 16-item short
version is a self-report scale with 4 items for each of the
four subscales. Items are rated on a 5-point scale from 1
to 5, with higher scores indicating greater endorsement
of attitudes reflecting the respective stage of change. A
composite measure of readiness to change is calculated
by subtracting the precontemplation subscore from the
sum of
the subscores of contemplation, action, and
maintenance, and it ranges from −2 to 14 [4]. This readi-
ness to change score can also be expressed as a URICA
total sum score, which includes the 12 item scores of
contemplation, action, and maintenance, as well as the
four inverted item scores of the pre-contemplation scale.

Therapy engagement
The original primary outcome of the RCT assessed the
participation of patients in psychosocial mental health
care options 6 months after inclusion in the study.
Participation in psychosocial mental health care was
defined as undergoing, being on a waiting list or having
completed a psychosocial mental health care program
other than BRIA itself during the 6 months after inclu-
sion in the trial, e.g. psychotherapy, psychiatric treat-
ment, psychosocial counselling, substance use treatment
including counselling and smoking cessation services, as

well as self-help groups. A second primary outcome was
defined for this study as having approached psychosocial
mental health care options regardless of whether this
approach resulted in a participation in therapy sessions
or a place on a waiting list.

assistants via a semistructured telephone interview. Be-
fore their first interview, evaluators were trained in the
application of the interview guideline, and during the
16 months of assessment, the evaluators held regular
calibration meetings with supervising researchers. A
major topic of the interview training and the calibration
meetings was the use of measures to prevent response
bias and to detect false positive answers. Concerning
therapy engagement, the evaluators asked the patients to
describe the treatment options that they said they had
asked further
been engaging in. Then evaluators

to distinguish treatment by psychosocial
health care professionals (e.g. psychological counselling,
psychotherapy, psychiatry)
from treatment by other
health care professionals that comprised psychological
topics (e.g. talking about one’s depression with a primary
care physician). Research assistants were unaware of
treatment assignment in order to guarantee rater blind-
ing. At the beginning of the interview, evaluators told
the patients that they were not involved in the therapy
process, and they explicitly asked the patients not to
reveal treatment assignment. During the telephone inter-
views, several patients reported that they had contacted
therapists or psychosocial health care institutions but
were neither put on a waiting list nor invited for a first
session. Reasons for this were, for example, that staff
asked patients to call once more at a later time point
because even waiting lists were overbooked, or that they
used answering machines without calling the patient
back. In order to take account of these first activities of
patients’ therapy engagement, a second primary out-
come was calculated which consists of both participation
in mental health care options and having approached
psychosocial mental health care options without having
managed to be put on a waiting list or to receive a first
session. This alternative outcome reflects treatment
engagement from a less strict perspective because it also
includes those patients who might have participated in
therapy if mental health care programs were more easily
accessible.

General self-reported psychological distress
We measured general psychological distress with the
total mean score Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief
Symptom Inventory (BSI-GSI) [42, 43]. The BSI is a 53-
item short form of the SCL-90-R (Symptom Checklist
90-R), an established and validated self-report scale of
psychological distress. The BSI has proven feasibility in

Krampe et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:417 

Page 10 of 16

patients with medical conditions and it has sound
psychometric properties in both patient and community
samples [42, 43]. The items of the BSI refer to severity
of various psychological symptoms during the past 7 days
and they are rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all)
to 4 (extremely). The GSI is calculated by dividing the
sum of item scores by the number of completed items.
It has shown validity as a measure of general psycho-
logical distress by reflecting both the number and inten-
sity of symptoms of perceived mental distress [42, 64].
At postoperative baseline assessment, patients com-
pleted the BSI as a paper-and-pencil questionnaire in
the first days after surgery, and at 6-month follow-up, as
a paper-pencil-questionnaire sent by post. In this study,
the BSI showed good reliability with Cronbach’s alphas
of 0.95 at baseline and 0.96 at 6-month follow-up.

Medical measures
The preoperative physical health status was assessed by
the evaluation of patients’ perioperative risk according
to the ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists)
physical status classification system [46, 47]. The surgical
field encompassed the categories 1) neuro-, head and
neck surgery, 2) abdomino-thoracic surgery, as well as
3) peripheral surgery [5, 65–67]. The severity of medical
comorbidity was measured with the Charlson Comor-
bidity Index (CCI, [48]), a validated weighted classifica-
tion system of comorbidity to measure cumulative
burden of disease. We assessed the extent of the specific
surgical procedures that patients underwent with the 4-
point item ‘operative severity’ of the POSSUM scoring
system (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for
the enUmeration of Mortality and Morbidity) [49, 50].

Statistical analyses
Descriptive results were expressed as relative frequencies
in percent, as well as means and standard deviations. All
analyses are based on the intention-to-treat data set of
the primary analyses of the RCT of BRIA [6]. Compari-
sons of the treatment groups were performed with Fish-
er’s exact test for categorical data, and with t-test for
continuous data. For all statistical tests, a two-tailed

change composite score of the URICA, the interaction
between treatment and readiness to change, as well as
the baseline GSI-BSI score had statistically significant
associations with three major treatment outcome vari-
ables. Multiple binary logistic regression models were
calculated for the analyses concerning the two outcome

the continuous

variables that were binary: the primary endpoint of the
RCT, ‘Participation in psychosocial mental health care
options at month 6’, and an alternative version of the
primary outcome, ‘Having approached psychosocial men-
tal health care options at month 6’. A multiple linear
regression model was calculated for the analyses con-
cerning the outcome variable that was continuous: the
secondary outcome of the RCT, ‘Change of self-reported
general psychological distress, measured by the BSI-GSI,
between baseline assessment and month 6’. The statis-
tical
interaction between the independent variables
‘Treatment assignment’ and ‘Readiness to change’ indi-
cated whether the outcome differences between treat-
ment groups were moderated by readiness to change. In
order to probe the interactions, analyses using the
Johnson-Neyman technique were conducted for all three
outcome variables [69]. The Johnson-Neyman technique
calculates the statistical significance of the effect of an
independent variable, in this study treatment allocation,
for all values of the moderator variable, in this study
readiness to change. Thus, the Johnson-Neyman tech-
nique can ‘identify points of
transition along the
continuum of the moderator between a statistically signifi-
cant and nonsignificant effect of X’ ([69], page 13). The
resulting ranges of the values of the moderator where the
independent variable is significantly associated with the
dependent variable are called regions of significance.

Results
Pretreatment readiness to change was not associated to
treatment allocation, age, gender, diagnosis of mental
disorder, as well as medical and perioperative character-
istics. However, it was related to pre-treatment general
psychological distress with a correlation between the
readiness to change score and the BSI-GSI of r = 0.429
(p < 0.001).

Table 4 shows the results of multiple regression
models analyzing the prediction of therapy outcomes at
month 6. The models are adjusted for treatment alloca-
tion, motivational readiness to change, the interaction
between treatment and readiness, as well as pre-
treatment BSI-GSI. Treatment allocation, readiness to
change, and the interaction between them had statisti-
cally significant independent effects on ‘Participation in
psychosocial mental health care options’ and ‘Having
approached psychosocial mental health care options at
month 6’. However, they did not show significant effects
concerning the outcome ‘Change of the BSI-GSI be-
tween baseline assessment and month 6’, which was only
significantly predicted by the pretreatment BSI-GSI.

The major results concern the two engagement mea-
sures. They indicate that BRIA psychotherapy sessions
were superior to BWA, that higher readiness to change
was related to better outcomes, and that the treatment

Discussion
The moderator analyses of this study established differ-
ential associations between readiness to change and
therapy
in
Anesthesiology. This transdiagnostic psychotherapy pro-
gram combines elements of MI and CBT in order to
motivate and support surgical patients with diverse men-
tal disorders to engage in psychosocial mental health
care options. The major results suggest that pretreat-
ment readiness to change moderates the treatment ef-
fects of
the two interventions BRIA psychotherapy
sessions and BWA concerning the primary outcomes
‘Participation in psychosocial mental health care options’
and ‘Having approached psychosocial mental health care
options’, but that there is no moderator effect of readi-
ness to change concerning the secondary outcome
‘Change of general psychological distress’.

Readiness to change showed significant conditional ef-
fects in the prediction of the outcomes ‘Participation in
psychosocial mental health care options’ and ‘Having
approached psychosocial mental health options’, and it
moderated the treatment effects of BRIA. These findings
are consistent with previous research showing positive
associations between higher motivation to change and

[19–27].

treatment outcomes of psychotherapy [3, 11–18]. Like in
previous studies readiness was positively associated with
pretreatment psychological distress [21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 31].
This result emphasizes the importance to include baseline
distress as a covariate in the moderator analyses of readi-
ness to change. However, readiness did not have a signifi-
cant association with the decrease of psychological
distress, confirming previous findings indicating that
higher readiness to change is not a unique predictor of
therapy success
Interestingly, pre-treatment
psychological distress was not significantly related with
participating in or having approached psychosocial mental
health care options, but it was positively associated with
decrease of distress after 6 months. This finding might
partially be influenced by the methodological issue that
patients with a higher level of baseline distress have a
higher range of potential decrease. The relationship
between severity of baseline symptoms and therapy results
seems indeed not to be unequivocal since psychotherapy
research has reported relationships between severity of
symptoms and both poor and good treatment response [71].
randomized controlled trials
reported contradictory results concerning the moderat-
ing effects of readiness to change. Several trials did not
find interactions between motivation to change and
treatment assignment [15, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 38, 39].
Whereas some studies reported contradictory results of
moderator analyses [12, 35, 37, 41], other trials showed
that different active interventions worked differently suc-
cessful in patients with low or high readiness [34, 36].
There is also evidence that patients with pain and high
readiness have better outcomes in CBT compared to
standard treatment [32]. Additionally, a recent investiga-
tion of students who smoke marijuana showed that
among those with high readiness, a substance-specific
web-based feedback intervention was more successful
than general health related feedback [24]. Finally, there
are data from three RCT’s of addiction therapy that
found moderating effects with better outcomes among
patients with low readiness to change, whereas among
those with high readiness, the study interventions did
not differ from each other [17, 33, 40]. Barnett et al.

For all readiness values below, the effect of BRIA psychotherapy sessions is statistically significant

(2010) investigated young adult problem drinkers in the
emergency department and found in those with low readi-
ness to change better drinking outcomes at 12-months
follow-up after motivational interviewing versus feedback
only [33]. The results of the Project MATCH Group
(1997) showed that among alcohol dependent patients
with low readiness to change, motivational enhancement
therapy yielded better drinking outcomes at 15-month
follow-up than CBT [40]. In the RCT of Pantalon et al.
(2002), patients with concurrent alcohol and cocaine use
disorders and low readiness had higher percentage of days
of substance abstinence when assigned to psychotherapy
plus disulfiram medication as compared to psychotherapy
only [17]. Several factors may contribute to the equivocal

empirical status concerning the moderating effects of
readiness to change on the efficacy of psychosocial
therapy. On the one hand, the cited studies are rather het-
erogeneous regarding sample sizes, problem severity of
participants, inclusion of additional moderating variables,
type and number of outcomes, as well as type, intensity
and duration of experimental and comparison interven-
tions. On the other hand, most trials are from the addic-
tion field, and moderator analyses of readiness to change
in the treatment of other mental disorders are sparse. In
addition, methodological issues might play a role like lack
of statistical power, artificial results due to multiple test-
ing, overlooking of other important potential moderators,
and under- or overfitting of regression models.

Moderator analyses of the study at hand resulted in
findings that are comparable to the results of Barnett et
al. (2010) [33], the Project MATCH Group (1997) [40]
and Pantalon et al. (2002) [17]. The data revealed that
BRIA psychotherapy sessions yielded significantly better
results in patients with low to moderate readiness to
change concerning the engagement outcome measures.
On the other hand, BRIA sessions were not significantly
superior to BWA in patients with readiness scores above
7.95 and 8.52, respectively, which are noticeably higher
than the mean readiness score of 6.40 (SD 2.22) of the
total sample and can be interpreted as indicating high
readiness to change. Altogether, these findings add to
the research on the relations between motivation to
change and psychotherapy by suggesting that interven-
tions like the BRIA psychotherapy sessions that combine
MI and CBT may especially be effective in those with
low readiness to change. Importantly, the efficacy of mo-
tivational
interventions might particularly affect out-
comes that can be interpreted as possible achievements
of increased motivation, like active search for therapy
and engagement in therapy.

Limitations and future directions
The data of this study are based on the first RCT
comparing BRIA psychotherapy sessions with a weak
comparison group, BWA. In order to guarantee treat-
ment integrity, we took important steps during selection,
therapists, as well as
training and supervision of
concerning the provision of therapy material
for the
therapists. However, we did not assess integrity and ther-
apy processes with measures of
therapist and client
verbal language and nonverbal behavior during therapy,
and we did not collect data on client motivation at
follow-up. Therefore,
it could not be investigated to
which extent participation in BRIA sessions might have
been related to an increase of the patients’ motivation to
change and readiness for subsequent psychotherapy.
Moreover, there are no data on the extent to which the
therapists balanced interventions of MI and CBT during
the specific BRIA sessions. Consequently,
it remains
unclear which specific components of BRIA contributed
to improve patients’ active search for therapy and engage-
ment in therapy, and which components were, in turn,
more related to a decrease of psychological distress.

The moderator analyses of this study could not be
adjusted for therapist allocation, because the BWA pa-
tients were not allocated to therapists. Since BWA was a
computerized intervention without therapists, it is rather
unlikely that the moderator effect of readiness to change
on treatment allocation is due to a therapist effect. How-
ever, we cannot rule out that the findings might have
been different with a more homogeneous or heteroge-
neous therapist team. From a very strict perspective, one

might even argue that the effect of the BRIA psychother-
apy sessions might only be due to the fact that it was
performed by therapists whereas BWA was a computer-
ized intervention. Indeed our data cannot reveal which
ingredients of BRIA contribute to which extent to its
therapy effect. Moreover, until now, there is no validated
therapist-delivered face-to-face intervention for
this
specific setting with which the BRIA psychotherapy ses-
sions could have been compared. Independent from the
question why BRIA sessions are superior to BWA, the
current moderator analyses identified an interesting
interaction effect showing that patients who are less
ready to change profit remarkably from a more intensive
intervention including face-to-face contacts, MI and
basic elements of CBT. In patients with high readiness,
however, the therapy outcomes of BRIA sessions and
BWA do not differ from each other.

It has to be mentioned that the primary engagement out-
comes, participation in or having contacted psychosocial
mental health care options, were based on self-report data
since we could not collect objective data because of profes-
sional discretion and data protection. In order to ensure
the validity of the outcome, the assessment of therapy en-
gagement was done by means of a semi-structured inter-
view including an interview booklet, training of evaluators,
calibration sessions, blinding of evaluators and also mea-
sures to prevent response bias. Furthermore, it can be as-
sumed that there was no reason for patients to answer in
terms of social desirability, because they did not receive
any reward for answering in one specific direction.

Whereas the inclusion of patients with diverse mental
disorders can be seen as an example for the feasibility of
transdiagnostic psychotherapy programs, it is also related
to methodological limitations concerning the measurement
of psychological symptoms. The BSI was chosen as major
secondary outcome measure in order to have a symptom
scale that would be applicable to assess general psycho-
logical distress of all patients. Given the relatively small
GSI-BSI outcome differences between BRIA psychotherapy
sessions and BWA that were found in the primary analyses
of this study [6], the question arises of whether the GSI-
BSI was suitable to measure change of symptoms in a sam-
ple that consisted of small subsamples of patients with het-
erogeneous disorders and the corresponding symptoms.

A formal limitation of this study is that the data sets
are not publicly available because there is no approval of
the study participants.

Taken together, future studies that aim to investigate
the relations between motivation to change and combi-
nations of MI and CBT should assess the behavior of
therapists with appropriate observational
instruments,
e.g. the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC;
[72]), the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity
Code (MITI 4; [73]), or the Cognitive Therapy Rating

It

[74]).

Scale (CTRS;
is also advisable to perform
repeated measurements of patients’ motivation to
change by analyses of within session language during
therapy and by self-report questionnaires at follow-up.
Finally,
the inclusion of patients with homogeneous
groups of disorders would facilitate the assessment of
therapists’ application of specific CBT interventions.

Conclusions
Previous studies of interactions between motivation and
treatment allocation were mainly based on therapy
research of substance use disorders. This investigation
included surgical patients with diverse mental disorders,
and the results suggest that combinations of MI and
CBT are particularly effective in patients with low to
moderate readiness to change. These data contribute to
recent research showing that integrating MI with CBT is
a promising therapy approach for patients with a variety
of psychological problems that are not related to sub-
stance use disorders [75–77]. The results of patients
with high readiness to change are difficult to interpret.
Since they did not achieve significantly better outcomes
in BRIA sessions compared with BWA, the question
arises whether low-intensity interventions might be suf-
ficient for patients with high readiness to change. An al-
ternative interpretation suggests that BRIA sessions
might not have contained enough specific CBT elements
to treat patients with high readiness to change who
might not have profited significantly from MI because
their motivation had already been increased before the
therapy. In order to investigate this topic in more detail,
future research could analyze interactions between
readiness to change and treatment allocation to low-
intensity interventions like BWA, or to high-intensity
MI-CBT combinations focusing either on MI or on CBT
interventions.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest that motiv-
ation to change may act as a moderator of the efficacy of
psychosocial therapy and that combinations of MI and
CBT are particularly effective in patients with a variety of
mental disorders and with low readiness to change. This
efficacy seems to be especially observable in proximal out-
comes that are assumed to be associated with motivation,
like active search for therapy and engagement in therapy.
