ABSTRACT

Proven treatment strategies for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) include pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). A significant proportion of patients (25%–30%) fail to respond to these 
treatment options, necessitating the need for additional treatment options to improve treatment outcomes and quality 
of  life  in  patients  with  OCD. Augmentation  strategies  using  various  glutamatergic  agents  have  been  explored,  with 
diverse outcomes. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the glutamatergic system in the brain with a focus 
on glutamatergic abnormalities in OCD and to review the existing evidence for various glutamatergic agents used for 
augmentation.

Key words: Augmentation, glutamate, N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate receptors, obsessive–compulsive disorder

INTRODUCTION

Glutamatergic system in the brain
Glutamate  is  a  ubiquitous  neurotransmitter,  chemically 
belonging  to  AMINE  group  of  neurotransmitters.  It  is  the 
principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex 
of  humans.  Glutamate  is  present  both  intracellularly  and 
extracellularly, each serving different purposes with respect 
to metabolic functions and signal transmission.[1] Glutamate 
in  the  brain  is  primarily  synthesized  by  pyruvic  acid  and 
alpha-ketoglutarate which receives an amino group donated 
by  “leucine,  isoleucine,  valine,  glutamine,  and  aspartate” 
amino acids.[2] Metabolic studies have shown that all of the 
glucose which enters the brain virtually gets converted into 
glutamate.[3]  Glutamate  release  and  reuptake  are  tightly 
regulated  by  VGlut  and  EAAT  proteins.[1]  Glutamatergic 
neurons  are  found  to  be  extensively  distributed  across

various  psychiatric  disorders 
including  schizophrenia, 
mood disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). 
Specific  polymorphisms 
in  NMDA  receptor  subunits 
(NR1 and NR2a and 2b) and glutamate transporter proteins, 
solute carrier family 1 member 1 (SLC1A1/EAAC1andEAAT3), 
have  been  implicated  in  OCD  risk.[6]  Members  of  SLC1A1 
family function as transporters of extracellular glutamate at 
the postsynaptic region where they stop glutamate action 
and aid in neuroprotection. Mutations in genes coding for 
SLC1A1  are  shown  to  be  associated  with  OCD  in  males.[7] 
NMDA receptors are made up of one obligatory (NR1) and 
two  additional  (NR2,  NR3)  subunits.  Mutations  in  genes 
coding for subunit NR2 have been associated with OCD risk 
and  presence  of  some  specific  symptoms  (contamination 
obsessions and cleaning).[8]

Glutamatergic dysfunction in obsessive–compulsive 
disorder
(CSTC) 
Dysfunction  of  cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical 
circuits  is  a  well-documented  abnormality  underlying 
OCD.  There 
from  genetic, 
is  emerging  evidence 
neurochemical,  and  neuroimaging  studies  that  glutamate 
transmission abnormalities in CSTC may contribute to the 
pathophysiology of OCD.[4]

Cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit and the glutamatergic 
system
Direct  and  indirect  pathways,  operating  by  means  of 
glutamate  and  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA),  exist  in 
CSTC circuit. They work in balance in normalcy/physiological 
(Baxter’s  model).[9]  Glutamatergic  signaling 
conditions 
operates  between  key  regions  of  CSTC,  namely  the 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), 
and striatal structures.

Through the direct pathway, excitatory signals originating 
from OFC and ACC increase inhibitory GABAergic signaling 
to  downstream  inhibitory  nuclei  such  as  globus  pallidus 
interna  (GPi)  and  substantia  nigra  (SNr).[10]  Subsequently, 
there  is  a  reduction  in  signal  transmission  from  these 
nuclei,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  thalamic  output  to  the 
cortex.  The  indirect  pathway  serves  as  a  modulator  of 
glutamatergic transmission by the direct pathway. Through 
striatum, it inhibits GPe (Globus pallidus Externa), resulting 
in  stimulation  of  STN,  GPi,  and  SNr,  leading  to  thalamic 
inhibition.[11]  The  parallel  and  partially  nonoverlapping 
CSTC circuits in OCD might have differential impairment of 
these pathways.[12]

Genetic studies
Dysfunction 
in  the  postsynaptic  glutamate  signaling 
represents  the  most  likely  candidate  mechanism  at  the 
molecular  level  to  explain  the  macrolevel  changes  seen 
in  CSTC  glutamate  transmission.  Several  animal  studies 
and  human  genetic  studies  have  tried  to  investigate  and 
explain  the  changes  at  a  macrolevel  from  a  molecular 

perspective.  In  this  regard,  a  brief  review  of  the  evidence 
from  all  sources  would  be  useful  to  understand  the  basis 
for  glutamate  dysfunction  in  OCD.  Knockout  mice  studies 
have  found  abnormalities  in  genes  controlling  NMDA 
receptor  subunit  composition 
(DLGAP3,  slitrk)  to  be 
associated with increased OCD-like behaviors.[13] In human 
genetic  studies,  genes  coding  for  postsynaptic  glutamate 
transport  proteins 
(EAAC1,  EAAT3),  NMDA  receptor 
subunits (GRIN2B), Kainate receptor subunits (GRIK2/3), and 
members of postsynaptic density units (DLGAP1) have been 
associated OCD and variants. Some studies have also found 
an  association  of  SLC1A1  gene  mutations  with  OCD  in 
males.[7] A similar association has been reported in mutations 
affecting  GRIN2B,[8]  which  also  has  an  association  with 
symptom dimension of contamination and cleaning.[8] Even 
though the SNPs examined have varied, there is a paucity 
of  consistent  replication  studies.[4]  Further,  results  from 
the  OCD  Collaborative  Genetic  Association  Studies  and 
International OCD Foundation Genetic Collaborative GWAS 
studies with large sample sizes have failed to identify any 
SNPs at genome-wide significance level.[14,15] Currently, the 
genetic basis of OCD is less well known, and further studies 
are needed for an in-depth understanding of this condition. 
The  glutamatergic  model  remains  an  attractive  way  to 
explore the genetic basis of this condition.

Neuroimaging studies
Evidence for glutamatergic dysfunction in OCD comes mainly 
from  proton  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopic  studies 
(H-MRS).  Research  has  yielded  mixed  results  so  far.  Some 
studies have found evidence for elevated glutamate levels in 
the caudate nucleus in both medicated adult patients[16] and 
unmedicated pediatric patients.[17] These findings have not 
been  subsequently  well  replicated.  Majority  of  the  studies 
conducted later have either found no striatal glutamatergic 
abnormalities[18-21]  or  reduced  glutamate  levels  in  different 
parts of ACC (rostral and dorsal).[22,23] On the other hand, a 
study by Gnanavel et al.[24] has reported increased GLx levels in 
ACC. However, one needs to interpret the findings from these 
studies keeping mind the variations in image acquisition and 
analysis  factors  such  as  coil  type  employed,  definitions  of 
region  of  interest  used,  the  quantification  method  used, 
voxel  size  and  placement,  strength  of  the  magnetic  field, 
clinical characteristics of the patient population studied, and 
the medication status. Most of the studies[16,20,21,25] were done 
on patients who were either on a stable dose of medications 
or  were  free  of  medications,  suggesting  that  medication 
exposure has happened before the time of scanning, which 
can 
influence  the  neuroanatomy  and  neurochemistry 
in  different  ways.  Only  a  handful  of  studies  have  taken 
medication-naive  patients.[19,26]  These  studies  have  been 
conducted in either children or adolescents, which limits the 
generalizability  of  their  study  findings.  More  studies  with 
rigorous methodology on carefully chosen patient samples 
would be required to assess if glutamate abnormalities are 
due to methodological differences or they represent actual

is  a  method  for 

Augmentation with glutamatergic agents
Augmentation – what do we mean by this?
Augmentation 
improving  treatment 
response.  It  is  achieved  by  administering  medication(s) 
with  a  different  mechanism  of  action  along  with  primary 
medication  to  enhance  its  efficacy.  Augmentation  as  a 
treatment  strategy  is  commonly  used  for  treating  various 
psychiatric  illnesses  as  multiple  neurotransmitters  are 
implicated in the pathophysiology of these illnesses. Multiple 
neurotransmitters are associated with the pathophysiology 
of OCD as well. Hence, there is a theoretical rationale for 
augmentation in the treatment of OCD.[27]

Glutamatergic medications used as augmenting agents in 
obsessive–compulsive disorder
Glutamatergic  medications  that  have  been  used  have  no 
single mechanism of action. Rather, they work in complex 
and varied ways to bring about their effects. They are best 

described  as  glutamate  modulators.  Chemically,  they  can 
be  receptor  antagonists,  glutamate  co-agonists,  reuptake 
inhibitors,  and  ion  channel  modulators  that  act  to  bring 
about  changes  in  glutamate  transmission.  In  general, 
these  medications  are  well  tolerated.  However,  specific 
side  effects  have  been  noted  with  some  of  the  agents. 
Table  2  summarizes  the  various  medications  used,  their 
recommended optimal doses, and specific adverse effects.

Memantine
Memantine  acts  as  a  noncompetitive  NMDA  receptor 
antagonist  that  preferentially  targets  extrasynaptic  NMDA 
receptors, blocking ion channel pores, and reducing calcium 
influx. Research suggests that it may reduce the activity of 
the direct pathway of CSTC, modulate connectivity between 
ACC,  OFC,  and  aberrant  activity  between  amygdala  and 
hippocampus[11] which are implicated in the pathophysiology 
of  OCD.  The  important  studies  examining  the  utility  of 
memantine  in  OCD  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  Whereas 
most  of  the  open-label  studies  have  reported  a  modest 
reduction  in  YBOCS  score  (27%–40%  at  the  end  of  study 
period),  two  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)[28,29]  have

up to 100% in one of the RCTs.[28] In a single-blind study by 
Stewart et al., it was shown that memantine was efficacious 
as an augmenting agent. However, the sample consisted of 
patients who also received cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) 
and other standard OCD medications, which may limit the 
specificity of the impact; memantine might have had on the 
overall  outcome.  Two  recent  RCTs  (both  from  Iran)  have 
demonstrated the efficacy of memantine as an augmenting 
agent for treatment of OCD. Both studies recruited patients 
who may not have been necessarily treatment resistant. In 
addition,  RCT  of  Ghaleiha  et  al.,  fluvoxamine  was  almost 
simultaneously started along with memantine and was hiked

period.  Hence,  it  remains  to  be  seen  if  the  improvement 
reported, actually represents the effect of add-on memantine, 
or it is due to serotonin reuptake inhibitor alone. Memantine 
was  generally  well  tolerated  in  all  the  studies,  and  overall 
body of evidence indicates the potential clinical utility of this 
medication as an augmentation method in OCD.

N‑acetyl cysteine
N-acetyl  cysteine  (NAC)  is  a  drug  conventionally  used  to 
treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning. In addition, 
it  is  used  as  a  mucolytic  in  the  treatment  of  airway 
diseases.  Recently,  studies  have  investigated  the  utility 
of  this  relatively  safe  molecule  across  various  psychiatric 
conditions  including  OCD.  By  virtue  of  its  antioxidant 
properties, it is believed to exert its effects on psychiatric 
conditions in which oxidative stress plays a role. Cysteine 
component of NAC is central to its antioxidant properties 
and  glutamate  modulation.  Availability  of  cysteine  is  a 
rate-limiting  step  in  the  production  of  glutathione,  the 
major  cellular  antioxidant.  Cysteine  is  also  a  substrate  in 
the metabolism of the glutamatergic system. By providing 
cysteine,  NAC  is  believed  to  exert  a  modulatory  influence 
on  glutamatergic 
few 
studies, which have looked into the efficacy of NAC as an 
augmentation strategy in the treatment of OCD and related 
disorders. Earlier trials from Iran have reported a significant 
benefit of adding NAC to ongoing Selective Serotonin Re-
uptake  Inhibitor  (SSRI)  treatment.[31,32]  However,  the  same 
has not been replicated in two recently published, 16-week, 
placebo-controlled  RCTs.[33,34]  Both  studies  did  not  find 

transmission.[30]  There  are  a

Sheshachala and Narayanaswamy: Glutamatergic medications for OCDa  positive  impact  of  NAC  addition  on  YBOCS  scores.  The 
first  of  these  double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled 
trials (DBRPCTs) by Sarris et al. (n = 44) found a temporary, 
albeit  significant,  “time*treatment”  interaction  in  favor  of 
NAC in the form of reduction in “compulsion” subscale of 
YBOCS at the end of week 12, which disappeared at the end 
of the study period (week 16). In another DBRPCT by Costa 
et al. (n = 40), no significant difference was observed at the 
end of the study period (week16) between participants on 
NAC and those on placebo. Therefore, the evidence favoring 
the  use  of  NAC  at  this  stage  is  preliminary  and  needs 
further substantiation. However, given its safety profile and 
possible significant effects in a subset of patients, it remains 
an attractive option for glutamatergic augmentation.

Lamotrigine
Lamotrigine  is  an  antiepileptic  agent,  which  has  also 
been  used  as  a  mood  stabilizer.  It  inhibits  voltage-gated 
calcium channels on presynaptic neurons, thereby reducing 
glutamate  outflow.  Lamotrigine  is  usually  well  tolerated 
except  for  a  rare  possibility  of  causing  Steven–Johnson 
syndrome, subject to various factors.[35] A handful of studies 
have  examined  the  role  of  lamotrigine  as  an  augmenting 
agent to SSRI treatment in treatment-resistant OCD. Benefits 
of lamotrigine augmentation in OCD were reported initially 
in case reports and case series.[36,37] Such benefits were also 
reported  in  patients  with  schizophrenia/schizoaffective 
disorder and bipolar disorder who had comorbid OCD.[38,39] 
Subsequently,  two  DBRPCTs  have  examined  the  efficacy 
of  lamotrigine  augmentation  in  OCD.  In  a  study  by  Bruno 
et  al.  (n  =  33,  16  weeks),  it  was  shown  to  reduce  YBOCS 
compulsion scores together with improvement in affective 
symptoms and semantic fluency in the treatment group.[40] A 
more recent RCT (L = 26; P = 27, 12 weeks) which compared 
addition of lamotrigine (L) to SSRI with a placebo (P) arm, 
a reduction in YBOCS total scores (Mean reduction = 8.73) 
as  well  as  obsessions  (mean  reduction  =  4.15)  and 
compulsions  (mean  reduction  =  4.5)  was  reported.  The 
reduction  was  statistically  significant  when  compared  to 
the placebo group (P = 0.04, 0.03, and 0.01 for obsessions, 
compulsions, and total score, respectively).[41] Hence, at this 
point,  there  is  emerging  evidence  to  support  the  use  of 
lamotrigine as an augmenting agent. However, these results 
need to be replicated in larger samples with a longer period 
of follow-up before any conclusive statement can be made 
about the use of lamotrigine.

Topiramate
Topiramate  was  originally  designed  as  a  hypoglycemic 
drug  that  was  subsequently  known  to  have  antiepileptic 
properties. It interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels 
and  modulates  glutamate  release  from  axon  terminals.  It 
is  known  to  inhibit  glutamate  release  and  enhance  GABA 
release.[42]  Evidence  from  two  out  of  three  double-blind 
randomized placebo-controlled trials[43-45] conducted suggest 
that  topiramate  augmentation  may  confer  modest  benefit 

in the treatment of OCD in a subset of the population. The 
study by Berlin et al. (T = 18; P = 18, 12 weeks) reported 
a significant reduction in compulsions subscale only. Poor 
tolerability  to  topiramate  was  noted,  with  28%  of  study 
participants  discontinuing  due  to  side  effects.  Mowla 
et al.[45] studied the effects of topiramate augmentation in a 
DBRPCT study design among 41 treatment-refractory OCD 
patients with comorbid depression. Nearly 32% reduction in 
YBOCS scores was reported in the topiramate arm, which 
also recorded lower HAM-D scores at the end of 12 weeks. 
It is debatable if the reduction in YBOCS is attributable to 
depression  getting  better  or  to  augmentation  effects  of 
topiramate on OCD itself. In the RCT (12 weeks) by Afshar 
et al., which was conducted in a treatment-refractory OCD 
sample  of  36  patients,  the  reduction  in  YBOCS  scores 
was  similar  across  both  arms.  None  of  the  studies  had  a 
long-term follow-up arm to objectively assess the long-term 
sustainability of the beneficial effects observed. Thus, poor 
tolerability,  comorbid  depression,  and  small  sample  sizes

of findings.

Ketamine
Ketamine  is  an  open-channel  nonselective  antagonist  at 
NMDA  receptor.  At  low  doses,  It  increases  glutamatergic 
activity  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  by  complex  mechanisms, 
despite  being  a  receptor  antagonist.[46]  Ketamine  infusion 
has  been  noted  to  result  in  rapid  resolution  of  depressive 
symptoms  and  suicidality  across  various  studies.[47-49] 
Encouraged  by  the  results  of  studies  in  depression,  the 
efficacy  of  ketamine  augmentation  in  OCD  has  been 
examined  by  a  handful  of  studies.  In  an  open-label  study, 
Bloch et al. reported transient improvement which did not 
persist  beyond  a  week.[50]  Subsequently,  a  cross-over  RCT 
examined  the  effect  of  single-dose  ketamine  compared  to 
saline  infusion  in  medication-naive  patients  with  OCD.[51] 
Fifty percent of the participants receiving ketamine infusion 
met criteria for treatment response as per YBOCS reduction, 
which was maintained at 1 week postinfusion. No participant, 
improvement. 
who  received  saline 
Another  open-label  trial  reported  additional  benefit  of 
adding  exposure-based  CBT  in  extending  the  effects  of 
ketamine infusion.[52] Recently, in an open-label observation 
from  our  center,  2  out  of  11  patients  satisfied  response 
criteria  of  25%.[53]  These  patients  have  also  failed  trials  of 
multiple  SSRIs,  exposure-based  CBT,  and  pharmacological 
augmentation  strategies.  Hence,  it  can  be  seen  that  in  a 
“refractory”  sample,  the  response  rate  is  not  comparable 
to  that  in  the  other  studies.  So  far,  evidence  suggests 
that  ketamine  has  some  benefit  in  less  severely  affected, 
unmedicated patients[51] and needs to be investigated more 
systematically  in  treatment-resistant  OCD.  The  rapidity  of 
onset of effects makes ketamine an attractive augmentation 
strategy  which  requires  more  DBRPCTs  to  explore  the 
evidence. The summary of the studies examining the efficacy 
of ketamine in OCD is shown in Table 4.

Glycine
Glycine  is  a  nonessential  amino  acid,  which  acts  as  an 
obligatory  co-agonist  at  the  NMDA  receptor,  thereby 
regulating the physiological actions at the NMDA receptor. 
Glycine  on  its  own  cannot  modulate  the  NMDA  receptor. 
However,  it  is  essential  for  normal  glutamate  signaling. 
Based  on  this  hypothesis,  glycine  was  investigated  as 
an  augmenting  agent  for  the  treatment  of  OCD  in  one 
controlled  trial  (Greenberg  et  al.,  2009).[54]  However,  the 
results showed that both groups did not have a statistically 
significant difference in terms of reduction in YBOCS score. 
The  requirement  of  large  doses  (~60  gm/d)  and  poor 
tolerability  leading  to  high  dropout  rates  were  a  concern 
noted in this trial. Subsequently, there have been no further 
studies on glycine. However, recent trials using sarcosine – a 
glycine  re-uptake  inhibitor  –  and  rapastinel  –  a  putative 
glycine site co-agonist at the NMDA receptor – have shown 
benefit  in  medication-naive  patients  with  OCD.[55]  At  this 
stage, there is no convincing evidence to recommend the 
use  of  glycine  as  a  glutamatergic  augmentation  strategy 
in  treatment-refractory  OCD.  Further  studies  are  required 
to  establish  glycine  and  glycine  modulators  as  efficacious 
augmenting strategies.

Riluzole
Riluzole  acts  through  various  mechanisms  to  reduce 
glutamate  outflow  in  cortical  neurons  and  potentiates 
reuptake  of  extracellular  glutamate  by  the  glial  cells.[56] 
Case  reports  and  open-label  trials[57-59]  reported  modest 
in  patients  with 
benefits  of  riluzole  augmentation 
refractory  OCD.  In  an  open  trial  in  a  pediatric  population 
with treatment-resistant OCD,[60] riluzole was not found to 
be superior to placebo in reducing YBOCS scores. Results 
from controlled trials[56,61] have been less convincing. Three 
DBRPCTs  have  been  conducted  so  far.  In  the  first  trial  by 
Pittenger et al. (n = 39; 12 weeks), riluzole augmentation 
was  studied  in  outpatients  and  inpatients.  Only  a  subset 
of patients seemed to benefit from riluzole augmentation, 
which  failed  to  reach  statistical  significance  in  the  trial. 
In the trial by Sahra et al.,[61] all patients receiving riluzole 
seemed  to  benefit.  Hence,  the  results  with  riluzole  so  far 
have  been  mixed.  Other  factors,  including  differences  in 

the  patient  population,  clinical  characteristics,  treatment 
setting,  sample  size,  and  methodological  differences  may 
explain the inconsistent results.

D‑cycloserine
D-cycloserine  is  a  D-enantiomer  of  cycloserine,  which  is 
used as a second-line bacteriostatic agent in the treatment 
of  tuberculosis.  By  various  mechanisms  of  actions,  it  is 
believed  to  modulate  glutamate  signaling  and  facilitate 
fear  extinction.[62]  Randomized  trials[63-67]  have  examined 
the  role  of  D-cycloserine  in  facilitating  fear  extinction 
by  preadministering  D-cycloserine  as  an 
intravenous 
infusion (125-mg mean dose)[64] 1–2 h before CBT sessions. 
Results  have  been  largely  unconvincing,  with  no  study 
showing substantial benefit which can be clearly attributed 
to  D-cycloserine  pretreatment.  Perhaps,  it  may  accelerate 
the  effect  of  CBT  initially,  even  though  evidence  suggests 
that it may not influence the outcome.

SUMMARY

The  glutamatergic  hypothesis  of  OCD  is  an  attractive 
proposition  especially  for  patients  who  become  resistant 
to SSRI treatment. A number of glutamatergic agents have 
been investigated for their efficacy in OCD. However, only a 
few have demonstrated benefit as augmenting agents.

These  agents  represent  a  viable  alternative  in  treatment 
refractory patients, where better-proven strategies have been 
exhausted.  Among  these,  memantine  appears  to  be  more 
promising in terms of the number of good quality positive 
trials.  Ketamine  for  OCD  is  still  in  experimental  stages, 
unlike in treatment of depression where encouraging results 
are obtained. However, there is a need to further evaluate 
its efficacy, given the rapid onset of action. It may lend itself 
as a molecule to examine the glutamatergic hypothesis of 
the disorder. Anticonvulsant medications – topiramate and 
lamotrigine  –  have  demonstrated  only  a  modest  benefit. 
However,  they  may  work  in  a  small  subset  of  patients. 
NAC  has  large  RCT  with  positive  results  and  some  recent 
RCTs  with  negative  findings.  NAC  may  be  considered  as 
a  potential  option  for  augmentation  even  though  further

Sheshachala and Narayanaswamy: Glutamatergic medications for OCDstudies  are  required.  At  this  point,  the  Indian  Psychiatric 
Society  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  memantine  and 
lamotrigine with a strength of recommendation-level B (one 
high-quality study, several studies with some limitations).[68] 
Future  research  aimed  at  identifying  a  subset  who  may 
benefit  from  it  may  help  us  understand  the  predictors 
of  response  and  is  likely  to  have  an  important  impact  on 
pharmacological management of treatment-resistant OCD.

Author Help: Reference checking facility

The manuscript system (www.journalonweb.com) allows the authors to check and verify the accuracy and style of references. The tool checks 
the references with PubMed as per a predefined style. Authors are encouraged to use this facility, before submitting articles to the journal.

•	

•	

The style as well as bibliographic elements should be 100% accurate, to help get the references verified from the system. Even a 
single spelling error or addition of issue number/month of publication will lead to an error when verifying the reference. 
Example of a correct style
Sheahan P, O’leary G, Lee G, Fitzgibbon J. Cystic cervical metastases: Incidence and diagnosis using fine needle aspiration biopsy. 
Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2002;127:294-8. 

Enter each reference in new line, without a serial number.

•	 Only the references from journals indexed in PubMed will be checked. 
•	
•	 Add up to a maximum of 15 references at a time.
•	

If the reference is correct for its bibliographic elements and punctuations, it will be shown as CORRECT and a link to the correct 
article in PubMed will be given.
If any of the bibliographic elements are missing, incorrect or extra (such as issue number), it will be shown as INCORRECT and link to 
possible articles in PubMed will be given.
