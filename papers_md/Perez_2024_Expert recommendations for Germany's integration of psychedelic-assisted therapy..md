Abstract 
As clinical trials for psychedelics move into phase III in the USA, Europe must address its lag in integrating profes-
sional education around psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) and supporting psychedelic drug research. This paper 
evaluates the necessary frameworks for implementing PAT in Germany, emphasizing the nation’s potential leader-
ship role within the European Union. With Australia having already approved MDMA and psilocybin for mental 
health indications, the Ukrainian government exploring MDMA treatment for war-related PTSD, and initial clinical 
trials involving MDMA and LSD with patients in Switzerland which restarted the restricted medical use of these 
substances around 2014, the medical authorization of psychedelics in these countries establishes precedent showcas-
ing both the promise and challenges of researching and implementing PAT in nations where the substances were 
formally scheduled as illicit substances. Key challenges include establishing rigorous standards for practitioner train-
ing, accessibility, and defining regulatory oversight. This paper focuses on the development of robust infrastructure 
in Germany, which will support the roll out of PAT, and details ethical considerations, training protocols, and govern-
mental roles in the formulation of treatment frameworks. This approach aims not only to guide Germany in adopting 
PAT but also to influence broader European policy, ensuring that patients receive ethically sound and proficient care. 
The findings suggest pathways for Europe to reclaim its historical lead in psychiatric and therapeutic innovation.

Introduction
Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) is a modality of men-
tal  health  treatment  that  merges  psychotherapeutic 
interventions  with  psychedelic  states,  often  facilitated 
by  substances  such  as  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD),

psilocybin,  and  3,4-Methylenedioxy-methamphetamine  
(MDMA).  The  latter  two  being  in  phase  III  trials. 
Whereas  MDMA  is  considered  an  entactogen  that 
enhances  self-awareness  and  emotional  connectivity, 
psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound 
found  in  certain  mushrooms.  Recent  research  suggests 
that  these  and  other  psychedelics,  all  small  molecules, 
most  with  benzene  or  phenyl  rings,  uniquely  work  by 
reopening  a  "critical  period"  in  the  brain,  allowing  for 
new  learning  within  social  contexts  in  a  process  involv-
ing changes in brain plasticity and oxytocin signaling [1]. 
Despite  their  classification  as  a  Schedule  I  drugs  under 
the  Controlled  Substances  Act  by  the  Drug  Enforce-
ment  Agency  (DEA)  in  the  United  States,  their  thera-
peutic  potential  has  been  increasingly  recognized,  with 
demands  from  the  public  to  make  them  available  for

those  with  treatment  resistant  conditions.  These  among 
other  developments  resulted  in  MDMA  being  granted 
Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA)  for  the  treatment  of  treat-
ment-resistant  PTSD  (TR-PTSD)  in  phase  II,  (phase  III 
studies  were  for  ‘moderate  to  severe’  PTSD).  Psilocy-
bin  (COMP360)  and  a  deuterated  psilocybin  analogue 
(CYB003) were granted FDA Breakthrough Therapy des-
ignation for treatment resistant depression (TRD) [2–4].

Methodologically  rigorous  clinical  research  suggests 
that  PAT  may  offer  substantial  long-term  alleviation  of 
symptoms  in  patients  suffering  from  psychopatholo-
gies  such  as  PTSD,  TRD,  major  depressive  disorder 
(MDD),  end  of  life  anxiety,  obsessive–compulsive  dis-
order  (OCD),  substance  use  disorders  (SUD),  psychotic 
conditions,  and  more  [5,  6].  Notably,  a  single  session  of 
substance-assisted  therapy  has  been  reported  to  lead 
to  significant  symptom  reduction,  with  some  patients 
achieving  remission  that  can  persist  for  at  least  twelve 
months [7]. This enduring effect underscores the poten-
tial  of  psychedelic-assisted  therapy  in  providing  ther-
apeutic  outcomes  that  are  significantly  superior  to 
antidepressant  medications  such  as  SSRIs,  which  often 
have  poor  efficacy  rates  and  unwanted  side-effects  such 
as agitation, weight gain, sexual performance difficulties, 
gastrointestinal issues, and other symptoms [1, 8].

In  February  2024,  Lykos  (formerly  MAPS  PBC)  sub-
mitted  a  new  drug  application  (NDA)  to  the  FDA  for 
MDMA  (Midomafetamine)  capsules  in  combination 
with  psychotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  [9].  Fol-
lowing  the  submission,  a  citizen  petition  was  filed,  rais-
ing  concerns  about  the  integrity  of  the  clinical  trials. 
This  prompted  the  FDA  to  convene  an  advisory  board 
meeting  in  June  2024  to  review  the  claims. The  petition 
raised  several  issues,  including  alleged  bias  in  the  trial 
design,  inadequate  sample  diversity,  insufficient  double-
blinding, underreporting of adverse events such as sexual 
misconduct,  and  confusion  regarding  the  integration  of 
psychotherapy  within  the  study  design  [10].  Despite  the 
principal  view  that  MDMA  trials  are  sound,  and  even 
the  FDA’s  participation  in  the  creation  and  oversight  of 
the  studies  these  concerns  influenced  the  FDA’s  review 
process. Subsequently, in August 2024, the FDA issued a 
final  decision  rejecting  the  NDA  under  the  Prescription 
Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). It is important to note how-
ever that the FDA encouraged ongoing MDMA research 
and asked for another Phase III trial.

This  decision  led  to  additional  actions,  including  the 
Journal  of  Psychopharmacology  retracting  three  arti-
cles  related  to  the  MDMA  clinical  trials  conducted  by 
the  MAPS  research  team  and  the  initiation  of  an  FDA 
investigation.  Lykos  has  since  filed  for  a  reevaluation  of 
their NDA. If approved, MDMA would become the first 

psychedelic-assisted  therapy  officially  recognized  in  the 
United States.

As  unexpected  as  the  August  2024  rejection  of  the 
application  by  Lykos  for  approval  of  MDMA  was  for 
some,  the  hope  based  on  the  phase  II  studies,  remains 
that either MDMA or psilocybin will within the next two 
to three years receive a positive evaluation from the FDA 
although the exact timing remains unknown. Unlike the 
MDMA trials, where the FDA was initially satisfied with 
the blinding process prior to the advisory board meeting, 
Compass’ psilocybin trials were designed to minimize the 
unblinding caused by psychotropic effects, following the 
FDA’s advice to their satisfaction until this day.

Lykos  and  Compass  have  been  the  two  major  compa-
nies  driving  development,  and  although  Lykos  has  yet 
to  submit  a  new  phase  III  proposal,  Compass  continues 
with their phase III clinical trial. In general enthusiasm in 
the field for further research continues as there remains 
a need for novel treatments, and despite the uncertainty, 
the  FDA  seems  generally  favorable  toward  psychedelic 
medicine [10].

This  paper  outlines  the  current  and  required  infra-
structure  for  the  successful  integration  of  PAT,  includ-
ing rescheduling of psychedelic drugs beyond ketamine, 
accessibility,  reimbursement  strategies,  accreditation 
of  practitioners,  ethical  considerations  and  educational 
requirements.  The  role  of  the  German  government  and 
affiliated  agencies  is  pivotal  in  shaping  this  framework, 
ensuring  that  the  setup  not  only  complies  with  regula-
tory standards but also supports the ethical deployment 
of these therapies.

Moreover,  with  the  European  Medicines  Agency 
(EMA)  currently  deliberating  on  the  integration  of 
psychedelics  within  the  European  framework,  Germany 
has  a  unique  opportunity  to  lead  by  example,  showcas-
ing  a  meticulous  approach  to  the  adoption  of  psyche-
delic-assisted  therapies  and  must  therefore  also  prepare 
to  accommodate  these  innovative  treatments  [11].  This 
could serve as a model for other European nations, pro-
moting a harmonized approach to these promising treat-
ments across the continent.

The  first  half  of  this  paper  covers  the  regulatory  envi-
ronment  in  Germany,  as  it  is  impossible  to  understand 
the  steps  required  to  make  PAT  a  reality  without  some 
in-depth  understanding  of  the  country’s  unique  health 
care system. The second half of this paper covers the Ger-
man  provision  of  outpatient  mental  healthcare  and  how 
and where PAT would fit and critically, proposes a train-
ing scheme for the education of PAT facilitators.

Historical roots of psychedelics in Germany

Psychedelic  research  in  Germany  harkens  back  to  the 
1910s  and  1920s  when  the  atypical  psychedelic  MDMA 

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202

was first synthesized, and pioneering research was being 
conducted  on  the  properties  of  mescaline.  During  this 
early period, Beringer and colleagues [12] saw in mesca-
line and similar substances, an opportunity to explore the 
phenomenology  of  psychopathology,  creating  what  they 
described  as  ‘model  psychoses.’  Although  problematic 
in  many  ways,  this  stream  of  research  opened  up  a  new 
dimension of empathy and understanding into the expe-
rience of individuals with chronic psychosis [13]. In fact, 
the research carried out at the University of Heidelberg, 
culminating in Beringer’s habilitation thesis "Der Meska-
linrausch"  from  1927,  can  be  considered  the  first  major 
work  in  the  field  of  psychedelic  psychopharmacology 
in  the  West  [12].  Another  noteworthy  event  in  the  his-
tory of psychedelic drugs in German-speaking Europe is 
Albert  Hoffman’s  accidental  discovery  of  the  properties 
of  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD)  on  April  19,  1943, 
which  accelerated  interest  in  psychedelic  compounds 
throughout  the  Western  world  [14].  In  particular,  this 
landmark  event  led  to  the  widespread  experimental  use 
of  psychedelics  for  a  diverse  range  of  psychiatric  condi-
tions across Europe and North America.

This  period  of  research  during  the  1950s  and  1960s, 
though  short-lived,  would  later  become  known  as  the 
first  wave  of  psychedelic  research  [14,  15].  During  this 
brief  moment  in  history,  Betty  Eisner,  a  German-edu-
cated  American,  first  described  the  implementation  of 
low-dose LSD in combination with psychotherapy, mak-
ing  a  major  contribution  in  the  field  which  still  today 
remains  underrecognized  [16].  Margot  Cutner,  a  Ger-
man psychoanalyst who was leading psychedelic research 
in  England  after  fleeing  from  the  Nazis,  provided  some 
of  the  first  insights  on  the  relevance  of  the  role  of  the 
facilitator  in  psychedelic-assisted  therapy  (PAT)  and  the 
now well-known notion of ‘set and setting’ [16]. Follow-
ing  this,  Hanscarl  Leuner  coined  the  term  “psycholytic 
therapy”  at  the  University  of  Göttingen  underscoring 
the  drug’s  therapeutic  potential  in  a  sub-threshold  dose 
range  [17].  Despite  Leuner  and  colleagues’  extensive 
research  on  LSD  being  among  the  most  comprehensive 
bodies  of  work  on  the  topic  to  date,  it  has  been  largely 
neglected until recently due to never being published in 
English [18].

A  surprising  turn  of  events  occurred  when  in  1961, 
the  United  States  passed  the  seemingly  politically  moti-
vated  US  Controlled  Substances  Act,  which  resulted  in 
an  immediate  and  indefinite  suspension  of  psychedelic 
research throughout the U.S. Europe was quick to follow 
suit, and psychedelics became labeled as potentially dan-
gerous and addictive with no accepted medical use [19]. 
Subsequently, despite early breakthroughs and  extensive 
research,  these  restrictions  ushered  in  a  prohibition  era 
that would last decades, hampering progress and limiting 

the  exploration  of  psychedelic  compounds  through-
out the Western world. Germany was no exception, and 
psychedelic  treatments  now  being  championed  for  their 
therapeutic potential were outlawed.

Economic burden of treating PTSD and depression 
in Germany

The economic and human costs of PTSD and depression 
in  Germany  highlight  an  urgent  need  for  more  effective 
interventions [20]. Trauma-related healthcare costs range 
from  524.5  million  to  3.3  billion  euros  annually  [21], 
while depression adds another 1 to 5.2 billion euros [22, 
23]. Current pharmaceutical treatments, such as seroto-
nin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), offer limited efficacy and 
fail  to  fully  address  the  needs  of  individuals  with  PTSD, 
depression, or their comorbidities [24].

A recent study of German insurance claims highlighted 
both the direct and indirect costs of PTSD (ICD-10-GM 
F43.1)  [20,  21].  PTSD  patients  typically  suffer  for  about 
6  years,  with  a  50–100%  likelihood  of  comorbid  condi-
tions  such  as  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD),  panic 
disorder,  and  substance  use  disorder  (SUD).  Per-patient 
costs were 43,000 EUR, three times higher than for those 
without  PTSD,  driven  by  increased  healthcare  utiliza-
tion, impaired work capacity and reduced quality of life. 
PTSD  also  accounts  for  approximately  200,000  Disabil-
ity-Adjusted  Life  Years  (DALYs)  annually  in  Germany,  a 
metric  that  reflects  both  premature  mortality  and  years 
lived  with  disability,  quantifying  the  overall  burden  of 
disease [25].

Similarly, depression carries significant economic bur-
dens  with  indirect  costs  from  labor  absenteeism,  social 
benefits, and prevention measures estimated at 10 to 16 
billion euros annually, surpassing direct healthcare costs 
[26, 27]. Depression accounts for approximately 470,000 
DALYs  in  Germany  [28],  while  globally,  PTSD  contrib-
utes an additional 3 million DALYs, underscoring its sub-
stantial public health impact.

In short, PTSD and depression remain conditions with 
a high unmet need. SSRIs, first introduced in 1988 (fluox-
etine), are still the primary pharmaceutical treatment for 
many  psychological  disorders,  despite  their  limited  effi-
cacy and adverse side effects, including symptom exacer-
bation and suicidal thoughts [29].

Regulatory landscape

The  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  grants  mar-
keting  authorization  for  new  medicines  across  the  EU. 
The  sponsor  of  the  medication  submits  an  application 
for  approval  to  the  EMA  following  phase  III  trials,  and 
after EMA approval, marketing authorization is granted, 
which  allows  the  medication  to  be  sold  in  all  European 
Union member states. Sponsors then must decide which 

 Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 4 of 20

member  states  they  wish  to  enter,  as,  even  if  the  Spon-
sor  has  marketing  authorization,  each  EU  state  has  its 
own rules about how health insurers will be reimbursed 
for  new  medications.  European  member  states  further-
more  have  country specific processes  and  infrastructure 
around the provision of therapeutic services which are an 
essential part of PAT.

In  Germany,  the  Bundesinstitut  für  Arzneimittel  und 
Medizinprodukte  (BfArM)  oversees  both  clinical  trial 
approval  (pre-  and  post-EMA  approval)  and  the  docu-
mentation  as  well  as  considerations  related  to  safety, 
efficacy,  and  quality,  and  specific  labeling  requirements 
tailored to the German context (Fig. 1).

The German gatekeeper institutes to access 
for psychotherapy

More importantly, as soon as a sponsor decides to enter 
the German market with a newly EMA approved medica-
tion, the process for reimbursement is started [30]. This 
process  is  not  a  federal  process  in  Germany,  rather  is 
managed  by  a  committee  established  in  2004  called  the 
“Federal  Joint  Committee”  (Gemeinsames  Bundesau-
schuss  also  known  as  the  ‘GBA’)  which  negotiates  costs 

to be reimbursed by federal insurers for new medications 
directly with pharma (Fig. 1). A legal reform in 2011 on 
the reimbursement of pharmaceuticals, the Arzneimittel-
markt -Neuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG) governs a process 
that  includes  representatives  from  insurers,  healthcare 
professionals,  and  patients,  who  provide  input  into  the 
GBA  decision  regarding  the  value  of  a  new  medication, 
independently  from  the  government  [31].  Psychedelic 
substances for example if they are to be introduced into 
Germany, will undergo re-evaluation based on the results 
of  EU  based  clinical  studies,  a  process  that  has  already 
taken  place  with  the  atypical  psychedelic  substance 
esketamine [32].

In  its  deliberations,  the  GBA  must  consider  assess-
ments  from  the  Institute  for  Quality  and  Efficiency  in 
Health  Care  (IQWiG),  a  federal  institute  responsible 
for  evaluating  the  quality,  effectiveness,  and  efficiency 
of  medical  treatments,  which  is  funded  through  contri-
butions  from  German  health  insurers  [33].  The  IQWiG 
compares  new  therapies,  such  as  psychedelics  in  com-
bination  with  psychotherapy,  with  standard  therapies 
such  as  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT),  trauma-
focused therapy, EMDR and pharmacotherapy involving

Page 5 of 20

antidepressants such as SSRIs, or serotonin-norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [34–37].

the  IQWiG  may  face  challenges  in  evaluating  a  new 
therapy such as MDMA if there are insufficient compari-
sons  with  standard  therapies  in  the  published  literature, 
in such cases the absence of direct head-to-head data can 
lead the IQWiG to conclude that a therapy’s benefit can-
not  be  adequately  assessed,  potentially  overlooking  its 
actual therapeutic value.

How European institutes influence German regulation—
the UN and EMA

In the EU, the regulation of psychedelics follows a frame-
work where Member States classify drugs and precursors 
based  on  the  three  UN  Conventions  of  1961,  1971,  and 
1988. This classification system is designed to control and 
supervise their legitimate scientific or medical use while 
reducing risks to public health by restricting use of harm-
ful  substances  [38].  Psychedelics  are  subject  to  interna-
tional control as per the 1971 United Nations Convention 
on  Psychotropic  Substances.  This  convention  restricts 
the  utilization  of  these  substances  solely  to  medical  and 
scientific endeavors (articles 5 and 7). While acknowledg-
ing  the  potential  therapeutic  benefits  of  certain  psycho-
tropic substances, it also considers their inherent risk of 
abuse.

Moreover,  the  annex  to  the  1971  Psychotropic  Sub-
stances  convention  categorizes  substances  into  four 
schedules  based  on  their  potential  for  abuse  and  thera-
peutic utility and degree of control required. Schedule I, 
which  includes  psychedelics  and  their  analogues,  com-
prises substances deemed to present a high risk of abuse, 
posing  a  severe  threat  to  public  health  with  minimal  or 
no therapeutic value.

Although  the  EMA  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  interpret-
ing  and  implementing  international  conventions  within 
the  European  Union  (EU),  unlike  the  UN,  it,  does  not 
establish distinct schedules for psychedelics. Each mem-
ber state has its own laws and regulations governing the 
scheduling  classification,  use,  and  distribution  of  psych-
edelics  and  bears  the  responsibility  for  enforcement  of 
these laws.

The  EMA  provides  guidance  on  establishing  a  posi-
tive risk–benefit balance of psychedelics and offers early 
involvement  of  regulators,  qualification  procedures,  and 
scientific advice.

Intellectual property and patent protection for psychedelic 
compounds

In  Germany,  introducing  a  new  medicine  to  the  market 
involves  navigating  several  challenging  regulatory  steps. 
Merck,  the  German  pharmaceutical  company  credited 
with synthesizing MDMA in 1912, did not hold a patent 

on  the  compound,  thus  allowing  MDMA  to  enter  the 
public  domain  without  proprietary  restrictions.  There-
fore, unlike many pharmaceuticals, MDMA lacks patent 
protection,  and  does  not  have  market  exclusivity  under 
regulatory frameworks in any jurisdiction.

Other psychedelic compounds, such as psilocybin also 
lack patent protection due to the fact that the compound 
is not novel. For example, Sandoz did not patent psilocy-
bin as a compound, but instead patented methods of its 
extraction  and  its  use  to  induce  “therapeutic  tranquili-
zation”.  However,  despite  the  inability  to  patent  psilocy-
bin  itself,  many  patents  related  to  psilocybin  have  been 
granted  and  continue  to  be  filed.  These  patents  cover 
areas  such  as  formulations,  methods  of  use,  delivery 
methods  and  manufacturing  processes.  Analogues  and 
novel  polymorphs  derived  from  or  based  on  psilocybin 
could  also  be  patentable,  offering  significant  opportuni-
ties for intellectual property beyond the compound itself 
[39].

Regulatory considerations and access implications

In  the  US,  the  FDA  employs  a  strategy  of  reschedul-
ing  illicit  drugs  demonstrated  in  clinical  trials  to  have 
a  therapeutic  purpose,  by  typically  rescheduling  only 
the formulation utilized in clinical trials and leaving the 
pure  substance  scheduled,  thereby  limiting  user  access 
to only the approved pharmaceutical [40]. This method-
ology,  as  seen  in  the  case  of  CBD  (cannabidiol),  aims  to 
facilitate  access  to  therapeutic  formulations  while  exert-
ing control over the raw substance. It is anticipated that 
the  EMA  may  adopt  a  comparable  scheduling  approach 
to future psychedelics such as MDMA and psilocybin. In 
some cases, drugs may be authorized through alternative 
pathways,  such  as  compassionate  use  or  special  access 
programs,  particularly  if  they  demonstrate  significant 
therapeutic benefits and meet safety standards. Australia 
represents a unique case in this regard.

In  an  unprecedented  move,  the  Australian  Therapeu-
tic  Goods  Administration  (TGA)  made  the  decision  to 
down-schedule MDMA and psilocybin (from “no thera-
peutic use”, Schedule 8 to “potential therapeutic benefits”, 
Schedule  9)  as  of  July  1st,  2023,  permitting  authorized 
psychiatrists to prescribe them for PTSD and treatment-
resistant  depression  [41].  Access  is  regulated  through 
an  Authorized  Prescriber  scheme,  which  facilitates  con-
trolled access to MDMA and psilocybin by granting qual-
ified psychiatrists in Australia the authority to prescribe 
only for specific indications and patient populations.

Such a move does not seem likely by the EMA, particu-
larly in the wake of the August 2024 MDMA rejection of 
the  FDA,  which  seems  to  lean  towards  more  conserva-
tive  approaches  in  drug  regulation  and  is  anticipated  to 
closely  observe  and  potentially  adopt  strategies  similar 

 Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 6 of 20

to the FDA’s approach. Regarding scheduling and access 
considerations,  Australia’s  groundbreaking  decision  to 
down-schedule  MDMA  shifted  the  paradigm  in  psychi-
atry  and  drug  regulation  somewhat,  setting  a  precedent 
for other countries to reconsider their approach to psych-
edelics in therapeutic contexts.

Evolving opinion of the EMA on psychedelics

The EMA aims to create a supportive regulatory frame-
work  to  facilitate  psychedelic  medicine  as  a  novel  form 
of  therapy  and  on  March  16,  2023,  acknowledged  the 
potential  of  PAT  for  various  mental  health  conditions. 
However,  concerns  were  raised  at  that  time  regarding 
the challenges developers may encounter in meeting the 
rigorous scientific and regulatory standards required for 
marketing  authorization  of  these  products.  Despite  a 
plethora of clinical trials in the EU involving psilocybin, 
MDMA,  and  LSD,  the  trials  were  deemed  insufficient 
to  form  a  regulatory  decision.  Further,  complex  study 
designs  were  emphasized  as  essential  for  generating 
robust and comprehensive evidence [42].

Recognizing  the  therapeutic  potential  of  psychedelic 
medicine  and  the  relative  regulatory  gaps  in  this  area 
however,  the  EMA  more  recently  conducted  a  multi-
stakeholder  workshop  on  psychedelics  –  ‘Towards  an 
EU  regulatory  framework’.  Marion  Haberkamp,  repre-
senting  the  BfArM  and  speaking  on  behalf  of  the  EMA, 
covered  the  most  recent  EMA  perspective  on  the  Euro-
pean  implementation,  regulation,  and  scheduling  of 
psychedelics at this public forum conducted in mid-April 
2024  [43].  The  EMA  identified  three  main  categories  of 
challenges in approving psychedelics for use, namely sci-
entific,  legal,  and  implementation  obstacles.  Scientific 
challenges  include  maintaining  double-blind  conditions 
due to the subjective effects of psychedelics, determining 
optimal  therapeutic  doses,  ensuring  long-term  efficacy, 
integrating  psychotherapy  into  therapy,  and  managing 
potential  adverse  effects  such  as  anxiety  and  addiction 
[43].

In terms of regulation, the key consideration, she noted, 
is establishing a positive risk–benefit balance. While clin-
ical  trials  are  yielding  intriguing  results,  they  also  raise 
concerns, necessitating longer and larger studies for thor-
ough  evaluation.  The  integration  of  psychedelic  admin-
istration  with  psychological  support  or  psychotherapy 
is  seen  as  an  issue  that  will  require  careful  considera-
tion.  Finally,  the  EMA  emphasizes  the  importance  of  a 
mechanism-of-action-based  assessment  regarding  the 
safety and potential for addiction. Before these issues are 
addressed, it is not likely that any recommendation for a 
change in scheduling will be considered by the EMA.

However,  to  close  the  identified  data  gaps,  the  EU 
recently awarded a €6.5 million grant for the PsyPal trial, 

a clinical study involving 19 partners from nine European 
countries. While Germany is not represented in the ini-
tial  cohort  of  research  supported  through  this  initiative, 
the  EU-centric  data  generated  through  this  endeavor 
would advance EMA’s decision-making.

Finally, there is a precedent for legal therapeutic access 
at least to MDMA-AT created in the EU through a recent 
report by the Dutch State Commission “MDMA- Beyond 
Ecstasy”  [44].  Across  the  EU  therefore,  the  work  on 
developing capacity for deploying MDMA-AT for PTSD 
treatment  through  a  national-scale  naturalistic  study  is 
underway.

Germany‑specific scheduling of psychedelics

In  Germany,  the  scheduling  of  psychedelics  and  other 
controlled  substances  is  regulated  by  the  Narcotics  Act 
(Betäubungsmittelgesetz,  BtMG)  and  the  Neue-psycho-
aktive-Stoffe Gesetz (NpSG). This legislation categorizes 
substances into various schedules based on criteria such 
as  their  potential  for  abuse,  therapeutic  value,  and  soci-
etal impact.

Psychedelic  compounds  typically  fall  within  the  scope 
of  illegal  substances  as  outlined  in  the  Narcotics  Act. 
Specifically,  they  are  classified  as  "non-prescription  nar-
cotics’’  (nichtverschreibungsfähige  Betäubungsmittel)  and 
the possession, manufacture, distribution, and consump-
tion without proper authorization are prohibited.

Accessibility to psychedelic therapy and barriers

With this in mind, there are currently very few legal ave-
nues  for  patients  to  access  not-approved  psychedelics 
in  Germany.  According  to  the  Narcotics  Act  in  Ger-
many,  psychedelics  including  LSD,  MDMA,  mescaline 
and  psilocybin  are  classified  as  "not  marketable",  mean-
ing that they cannot be used for therapeutic purposes by 
law  (BtMG,  Anlage  I,  §  1  Abs.  1).  Therapeutic  supervi-
sion  of  psychedelic  substance  consumption  for  medica-
tions such as Psilocybin or DMT constitutes a legal gray 
area  according  to  the  German  Narcotics  Act,  for  exam-
ple, in cases in which patients independently obtain and 
consume  the  substances  while  the  consumption  is  only 
accompanied  therapeutically  afterwards  as  integration 
therapy [45].

However,  this  therapeutic  intervention  still  entails 
criminal risks for both patient and therapist as consump-
tion of the aforementioned substances is only allowed in 
scientific studies [46].

Access through clinical trials in the EU

With  the  surge  of  psychedelic  therapy  research  in  the 
US,  and  data  collection  being  advanced  in  progressive 
European  Union  member  states  such  as  the  Nether-
lands,  Switzerland,  and  now  Ukraine,  other  key  players 

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202

such as Germany are starting to reconsider their policies, 
attitudes,  and  approach  towards  psychedelic  interven-
tions. As of April 2024, the EU database for clinical trials 
showed 29 studies for use of psychedelics in CNS condi-
tions,  including  19  for  psilocybin,  7  for  MDMA,  and  3 
with LSD [42].

As  clinical  research  on  psychedelic  therapy  gains 
momentum  across  the  EU,  ongoing  studies  have  the 
potential  to  drive  shifts  in  regulatory  frameworks  and 
public  perceptions  regarding  PAT  in  Germany  [47]. 
Notably,  the  "EPIsoDE"  study  [48]  is  a  key  initiative 
exploring the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in treating 
therapy-refractory  depression  in  Berlin  and  Mannheim. 
This study was funded by the German government (Bun-
desministerium für Bildung und Forschung) initially with 
2.6  million  and  later  topped  up  to  almost  5  million.  If 
successful, this placebo-controlled bi-center study should 
be a major step towards the approval of psilocybin. Cur-
rently,  according  to  the  study  process,  psilocybin  is  in 
phase  3  of  clinical  trials  for  treatment-resistant  depres-
sion [49]. The trial, which began in 2021, was completed 
in the first half of 2024. First results show a 17% response 
rate 6 weeks after dosing (25 mg). Full long-term follow-
up  results  remain  pending  publication.  Other  psyche-
delics are under investigation for the same indication. It is 
also worth mentioning that other psychedelics are being 
investigated  for  TRD,  including  5-MeO-DMT,  which  is 
currently the subject of an international phase IIb study 
conducted  by  Beckley  Psytech,  with  multiple  study  sites 
across Europe including several sites in Germany.

Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin was running a small 
(MAPS-sponsored)  multi-center  pivotal  study  examin-
ing  MDMA-assisted  psychotherapy  for  the  treatment  of 
severe PTSD (Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin, n.d.) 
Critically, patient accessibility to MDMA in compassion-
ate use in Germany depends on the capacity of such trials 
to  accommodate  German  patients  (see  diagram,  Fig.  2). 
Recruitment of participants in Europe however has been 
suspended since 2021.

Compassionate use of non‑approved substances—access 
to scheduled psychedelics after regulatory approval 
in other countries

In  Germany,  patients  may  potentially  access  FDA-
approved  substances  that  are  not  yet  approved  by  the 
EMA through the compassionate use pathway. This pro-
cess  is  regulated  by  the  Compassionate  use  (Arzneimit-
tel-Härtefall-Verordnung  (AMHV)  law  in  the  Medicinal 
Products Act (Arzneimittelgesetz) (AMG §22, Paragraph 
2, No. 6) which applies when patients suffer from a dis-
ease  leading  to  severe  disability  or  are  life-threatening 
and  cannot  be  satisfactorily  treated  otherwise.  Addi-
tionally,  there  is  a  hardship  program  for  patient  groups 

(AMG  §21,  Paragraph  2,  No.  3),  under  which  medicinal 
products may be brought to market without approval or 
authorization.  The  medicinal  product  must  be  provided 
at no cost in these cases.

If  a  psychedelic  is  deemed  necessary  for  a  patient’s 
treatment,  mental  healthcare  providers  theoretically 
could  apply  for  compassionate  use.  According  to  the 
BfArM Compassionate Use flowchart, if there is an ongo-
ing  marketing  authorization  application  or  if  there  is  an 
ICH-GCP Trial ongoing in a 3rd country in the intended 
indication (7), but not accessible clinical trial in Germany, 
then compassionate use may be possible (Fig. 2).

Compassionate  use  is  not  typically  approved  by  the 
BfArM  if  there  is  patient  access  through  a  clinical  trial 
in the country. however unclear how German regulatory 
agencies will navigate access to psychedelics within com-
passionate use programs (Supplementary Table 1).

Current therapy infrastructure—therapy vs 
pharmaceuticals for PTSD treatment

Current  first  line  pharmaceutical  treatments  for  PTSD 
and depression consist of primarily SSRIs and SNRIs (ser-
otonin  and  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors)  which 
purportedly  alleviate  symptoms  by  targeting  serotonin 
reuptake in the brain [29]. Studies have shown that these 
primarily  address  affective  symptoms  such  as  depressed 
mood and psychic anxiety, with weaker or absent effects 
on  other  symptoms  [29].  Recent  studies  have  found  the 
effects  of  SSRIs  &  SNRIs  only  modestly  more  effective 
than placebo [50–52]. These pharmaceuticals have subse-
quently been found to often require concurrent psycho-
therapy for optimal efficacy.

Despite their wide approval and use, it does not appear 
that they are more efficacious than psychotherapy alone, 
and thus far, they do not offer the same immediate effects 
or potential for prolonged relief as PAT [53, 54]. Recent 
publications on the mechanism of action of psychedelics 
demonstrate  moreover  that  psychedelics  bind  with  up 
to  1000×higher  affinity  to  newly  discovered  second-
ary  BDNF  receptor  binding  sites  than  SSRIs,  shedding 
light  on  the  biochemical  differences  [1].  In  spite  of  this, 
they  have  been  widely  prescribed  as  a  standalone  treat-
ment  for  depression,  Notably  SSRIs  were  approved  for 
the treatment of depression without the requirement for 
concurrent therapy [55].

The  historical  approval  processes  for  SSRIs,  coupled 
with  the  changing  understanding  of  the  role  of  therapy 
in  anxiety  disorder  treatment,  is  informing  the  ongoing 
debate  about  to  what  extent  any  regulation  of  therapy 
has  in  the  post-approval  phase  for  psychedelics.  Sev-
eral  psychedelic  drug  development  initiatives  currently 
entail  administering  the  investigational  drug,  followed 
by  psychotherapy  either  during  the  acute  effects  or  in

subsequent sessions, complicating the evaluation of drug 
effectiveness  and  presenting  a  challenge  for  product 
labeling  in  the  future  [56],  p.  9),  the  contribution  of  the 
psychotherapy component to any efficacy observed with 
psychedelic treatment had as of June 2023, not been char-
acterized. Although the FDA has called for it, researchers 
are against conducting trials that omit psychotherapy as 
they consider this unethical.

Regulators  therefore  grapple  with  the  ongoing  ques-
tion  if  such  characterization  is  required  as  the  regula-
tory authorities involved in marketing authorization and 
reimbursement (BfARM, EMA and GBA) do not govern 

psychotherapy.  Should  the  label  for  psychedelic  sub-
stances require administration only in the context of psy-
chotherapy, other regulatory agencies would be required 
to define the necessary parameters of that therapy.

The German experience with PTSD

There  is  data  on  the  Germany-specific  expenses  asso-
ciated  with  PTSD  which  assessed  both  the  direct  and 
indirect  expenses  as  well  as  its  occurrence  rate  within 
Germany  over  a  five-year  period  from  2010  to  2017 
using  national  insurance  claims  [20].  This  study  is  use-
ful as the data also points to the efficacy of interventions 

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 9 of 20

implemented  by  the  insurers  and  the  extent  to  which 
these  interventions  in  the  long  run  reduced  the  severity 
of PTSD.

Relevant to the debate on the centrality of the therapy 
component  of  PAT,  the  finding  that  94%  of  individuals 
with PTSD utilized PTSD-specific outpatient services in 
the  year  after  the  index  diagnosis  implies  that  therapy 
constitutes  an  essential  aspect  of  managing  PTSD  [20]. 
International  guidelines  furthermore  highly  recommend 
psychotherapy  as  the  treatment  option  of  choice  for 
PTSD,  with  empirical  evidence  supporting  its  effective-
ness [57].

Beyond  MDMA,  other  psychedelics,  such  as  psilocy-
bin, have shown promise in the treatment of PTSD. Early 
phase  trials  and  case  studies  suggest  that  psilocybin, 
when  combined  with  psychotherapeutic  support,  may 
significantly  reduce  PTSD  symptoms  [58].  This  expand-
ing  evidence  base  indicates  that  the  therapeutic  poten-
tial  of  psychedelics  for  PTSD  extends  beyond  MDMA, 
underscoring the need for further research into psilocy-
bin and other substances as adjuncts to psychotherapy.

The problem of outpatient psychotherapy in Germany

Outpatient  psychotherapy  has  become  an  essential  part 
of therapy for mental health disorders; and in a study of 
22,000  insurance  claims  from  six  German  insurers,  its 
implementation  has  been  demonstrated  to  result  in  sig-
nificant  reductions  in  work  disability  days,  hospitaliza-
tion  days,  and  inpatient  costs  from  the  first  year  before 
the therapy to the first year following therapy suggesting 
that  cost  savings  are  achieved  by  reducing  the  need  for 
more intensive and costly forms of healthcare utilization, 
such as hospitalization [57]. However, there are issues in 
Germany with access to therapy services which will also 
affect the availability of PAT if and when it is approved.

In  Germany,  access  to  mental  health  care,  includ-
ing  psychotherapy,  is  facilitated  through  a  combination 
of  employment-independent  public  and  private  health 
insurance systems and includes office-based psychother-
apists, psychiatrists, psychiatric hospitals, and outpatient 
clinics,  as  well  as  rehabilitation  centers  and  community 
mental  health  care  facilities  [59].  In  addition,  approxi-
mately  1.9  million  patients  per  year  receive  outpatient 
psychotherapeutic care [60].

However,  despite  the  availability  of  mental  health  ser-
vices,  which  are  free  of  charge,  disparities  in  access  and 
treatment  duration  persist.  Importantly,  in  contrast  to 
the  USA,  Canada,  and  some  other  EU  states,  access  to 
mental  health  care  in  Germany  is  largely  free  of  extra 
charges for most individuals [61]. However, while access 
to  mental  health  care  may  be  theoretically  unencum-
bered,  bottlenecks  in  care  do  persist.  Therefore,  the 
evolving  landscape  of  PAT  will  prompt  considerations 

about  German-specific  accessibility  and  reimbursement 
frameworks.

The  Federal  Joint  Committee  (GBA)  serves  as  the 
central  decision-making  entity  governing  the  provi-
sion  and  reimbursement  of  psychotherapeutic  services 
within  Germany’s  statutory  health  system,  which  covers 
approximately  74  million  individuals  [59].  As  the  apex 
body  of  joint  self-government,  comprising  physicians, 
psychotherapists,  dentists,  hospitals,  and  health  insur-
ance  funds,  the  GBA  plays  a  crucial  role  in  defining  the 
parameters  for  outpatient  therapy.  Through  its  Guide-
lines for Psychotherapy, the GBA ensures that all patients 
receive  qualified  and  adequate  care  in  outpatient  set-
tings,  however,  the  scope  of  psychotherapy,  while  wide, 
remains constrained by the specific diagnoses outlined in 
the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 GM, 
[62]).

Therefore,  questions  remain  regarding  the  GBAs 
potential role in determining the reimbursement frame-
work  for  PAT. The  shortcomings  of  the  entire  system  of 
outpatient therapy are notably encapsulated in three key 
areas: current provision, planning for future demand, and 
the educational training system for psychotherapists.

Health  economic  analyses  have  revealed  a  signifi-
cant  disparity  in  resource  allocation  in  Germany,  with 
a  disproportionate  emphasis  on  inpatient  treatment 
and  outpatient  drug  prescriptions  [59].  This  is  not  only 
inefficient,  but  it  also  does  a  disservice  to  the  increas-
ing  demand  for  outpatient  psychotherapy.  According 
to  the  German  Psychotherapy  Society  (Deutsche  Psy-
chotherapeuten  Verein),  in  2021  inpatient  psychiatric 
treatment  came  to  about  8  billion  Euro/year  while  out-
patient psychotherapy costs totaled about 2.7 billion per 
year. The German mental healthcare system has room to 
allocate  additional  resources  to  outpatient  therapy  ser-
vices, including eventually PAT as cost saving treatment 
modalities, as studies show that every euro invested into 
psychotherapy  pays  off  threefold  for  society  as  a  whole 
within a year [63].

Bottlenecks in access to insured psychotherapy

In theory, every German has the ability to access insurer 
covered psychotherapy (Supplementary Table 2) In real-
ity, accessing psychotherapy services remains a formida-
ble challenge for Germans, as the system is structured in 
a  way  that  limits  access  to  therapists  covered  by  public 
health insurance.

The GBA (Fig. 1) is the entity responsible for estimat-
ing  the  number  of  psychotherapists  a  patient  will  likely 
need  to  see  in  their  lifetime,  a  calculation  that  drives 
the  overall  numbers  of  psychotherapists  necessary  in 
the  country  as  a  whole  [64].  Legally  it  is  the  “Kassenär-
ztliche  Vereinigung  (KV)”  (Association  of  Doctors  who 

 Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 10 of 20

treat  the  publicly  insured),  tasked  with  ensuring  the 
actual supply of health services, with the caveat that the 
supply must remain “in budget”. Both institutions in the 
end conspire in different ways to result in a restriction to 
access of insurance covered psychotherapy services. This 
is because the KV also functions as a lobby group advo-
cating for doctors’ interests while ensuring health service 
provision  is  sufficient,  appropriate,  and  economical  by 
updating  regional  coverage  plans  based  on  local  supply 
and demand evaluations. More importantly, the KV also 
directly determines the numbers of psychotherapy prac-
titioners in a given region by setting the number of avail-
able licenses or “Kassensitze”.

The  scarcity  of  such  psychotherapy  licenses  creates  a 
bottleneck,  forcing  many  patients  to  either  pay  out-of-
pocket for private care or navigate complex bureaucratic 
processes  to  secure  reimbursement  for  therapy.  This  is 
compounded  by  a  lack  of  information  and  represents 
a  major  barrier  to  accessibility  which  is  particularly  rel-
evant in the context of PAT, where timely access is essen-
tial for effective treatment.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  furthermore  intensi-
fied  the  strain  on  mental  health  services,  leading  to  an 
elevated  demand  for  psychotherapy  in  a  system  already 
overburdened  prior  to  the  pandemic,  with  prolonged 
waiting  periods  of  three  to  nine  months  for  outpatient 
psychotherapy,  according  to  a  2019  analysis  by  the  Ger-
man  Psychotherapists  Association  (BtPK)  of  300,000 
insured  patients  [65].  Despite  an  increased  demand  for 
therapy,  faced  with  the  futility  of  finding  rapid  longer 
term psychotherapy services, only half of the patients-ini-
tiated treatment after consultation, with over 80% opting 
for short-term therapy of up to 24 h [65].

The GBA for its part, denies accountability for adjust-
ing license limits, asserting that such decisions lie within 
the  purview  of  regional  KVs.  However,  this  assertion 
belies the GBA’s own authority to increase licenses at the 
federal level, a power wielded in 2019 when around 800 
licenses were added nationwide, still only a third of what 
were estimated to be required [66].

Systemic inertia however prevails. Doubts arise regard-
ing  the  rationale  of  restricting  therapists  from  mov-
ing  out  of  rural  areas,  as  historical  patterns  suggest  it  is 
anxiety about income security among medical therapists 
that  have  influenced  license  restrictions.  The  stagnation 
is symptomatic of a larger issue: a lack of genuine inter-
est among stakeholders, including KVs and public health 
insurers,  in  expanding  capacity  to  meet  the  pressing 
needs of patients.

Politicians  harbor  concerns  regarding  the  prolifera-
tion of therapy services, apprehending that an increase in 
the availability of licenses may lead to a surge in demand 
driven  in  this  case  by  increased  supply,  consequently 

resulting in heightened financial burden on public health 
insurance  companies.  Addressing  these  structural  defi-
ciencies  and  fears  will  be  required  to  foster  an  environ-
ment conducive to the effective integration of PAT.

Insurance coverage and reimbursement 
for psychedelic‑assisted therapy sessions

Another  hurdle  for  therapists  who  provide  PAT  is  the 
lack  of  a  Germany  specific  billing  code  which  reflects 
the  real  costs  of  PAT,  as  this  influences  the  reimburse-
ment  process.  Since  its  introduction  treating  patients 
with Spravato can be reimbursed. Ketamine-assisted psy-
chotherapy  on  the  other  hand  is  not,  as  it  still  needs  to 
be  used  as  an  “off-label-use”  intervention,  billing  codes 
listed  in  a  table  called  the  Gebührenordnung  für  Ärzte 
(GOÄ) are insufficient to adequately code for PAT. Limi-
tations on the number of therapy hours that can be billed 
per week present a significant barrier for therapists aim-
ing  to  provide  PAT  responsively  To  illustrate,  ketamine-
assisted  psychotherapy  involves  preparation  sessions, 
one or up to five substance-assisted sessions followed by 
integration  sessions  taking  approximately  20–26  ther-
apy  hours,  costing  between  1000—5400€  (https:// ketam 
inpro. de/ kosten/). German private health insurance pro-
viders  decide  on  a  case-by-case  basis  whether  there  is  a 
medical  necessity  and  the  number  of  sessions,  whether 
and  which  proportion  of  the  costs  can  be  covered  [67]. 
If,  for  example,  ambulant  PAT  can  be  shown  to  prevent 
a long inpatient stay the insurer may be inclined to cover 
some or all the costs.

Training programs and ethical framework

Emerging research continues to underscore the therapeu-
tic potential of PAT, leading to a notable shift in accept-
ance  among  healthcare  professionals.  While  specific 
numerical  data  from  past  years  are  pending,  the  trend 
indicates a substantial increase in practitioners recogniz-
ing the potential of these treatments [68–70].

In  Europe,  advocacy  groups  such  as  PAREA  have 
been  instrumental  in  promoting  the  recognition  of 
psychedelics  as  legitimate  medicines.  Their  efforts  have 
advanced  to  the  European  Parliament,  where  a  collabo-
ration among the largest associations has resulted in the 
formation  of  an  action  group  (MEP  Action  Group  For 
The Medical Use Of Psychedelics) aimed at the medicali-
zation of these substances.

The  training  required  to  master  the  facilitation  of 
psychedelic-assisted  therapies  is  still  in  its  infancy  and 
remains  difficult  to  quantify  due  to  several  factors.  Eco-
nomic  and  time  constraints  pose  significant  challenges 
to  delivering  comprehensive  training,  and  there  is  sub-
stantial  variability  in  both  practitioners’  expertise  and 
the interpersonal complexities inherent to mental health 

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 11 of 20

disorders.  Given  these  constraints,  it  is  unrealistic  to 
expect training programs to cover all possible scenarios. 
Instead, they should aim to provide a strong foundational 
knowledge  that  can  be  expanded  through  field  experi-
ence,  continuous  education,  and  supervision,  allowing 
practitioners to adapt and grow as they encounter diverse 
clinical situations.

Ketamine—therapy in the context of Germany’s first 
approved psychedelic

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist that also upreg-
ulates  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF),  has 
demonstrated efficacy in reducing symptoms across vari-
ous mental health conditions. While its most extensively 
studied  use  is  in  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD) 
[71], ketamine has also shown promise in substance use 
disorder (SUD) [72] and anxiety disorders [73]. Further-
more,  ketamine  provides  rapid  and  effective  relief  of 
symptoms in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that 
are  refractory  to  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors 
(SSRIs),  with  benefits  extending  to  comorbid  conditions 
such as chronic pain [74].

Esketamine,  the  S-enantiomer  of  ketamine,  has  been 
widely  approved  for  the  treatment  of  major  depression 
and  TRD.  Administered  as  a  nasal  spray  (Spravato®),  in 
combination  with  an  SSRI,  esketamine  produces  rapid 
reductions in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, 
with continued improvement over the course of a month, 
outperforming traditional antidepressant therapies [75].

In  comparison,  psilocybin 

shows  antidepressant 
effects within 24 h, with sustained benefits lasting up to 
12 months [76]. Some studies have suggested that psilo-
cybin may be as effective, if not superior, to escitalopram 
in  treating  depression,  with  long-term  effects  lasting  up 
to six months compared to the SSRI group [77].

Although  ketamine’s  antidepressant  effects  are  rapid, 
its  direct  influence  on  brain  plasticity,  as  observed  in 
experimental  studies,  is  short-lived,  typically  lasting 
between 30 min to an hour, with clinical benefits extend-
ing  up  to  a  week  [1,  7].  In  contrast,  serotonergic  psych-
edelics such as psilocybin and LSD exhibit longer-lasting 
neuroplasticity  and  therapeutic  effects,  with  improve-
ments sustained for weeks or even months. This differen-
tial may be explained by the higher affinity of psilocybin 
and other psychedelics for specific receptor sites related 
to BDNF modulation [1].

While  the  exact  mechanisms  underlying  the  antide-
pressant  effects  of  psilocybin  and  other  serotonergic 
psychedelics  remain  to  be  fully  elucidated,  these  sub-
stances  consistently  demonstrate  more  durable  thera-
peutic  benefits,  likely  due  to  their  phenomenological 
effects and the incorporation of psychotherapeutic guid-
ance [78]. In contrast, ketamine is often studied within a 

"pharmacological  paradigm,"  where  the  subjective  expe-
rience  and  psychotherapeutic  context  are  minimized, 
which may limit its long-term efficacy.

Ketamine,  introduced  as  an  anesthetic  in  1969,  is  the 
only legal medicine with psychedelic properties currently 
available for clinical use in Germany. However, access to 
ketamine therapy is largely restricted to specialized clin-
ics capable of administering it intravenously. The off-label 
use  of  ketamine  in  the  treatment  of  mental  health  con-
ditions,  particularly  TRD,  anxiety  disorders,  and  PTSD, 
has  shown  promise,  but  its  widespread  clinical  use  is 
hindered  by  practical  barriers.  Intramuscular  adminis-
tration,  a  more  feasible  alternative,  has  yet  to  be  widely 
adopted by ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) pro-
viders  in  Germany.  Furthermore,  the  absence  of  keta-
mine lozenges or other oral formulations, which are not 
compounded by German pharmacies, has further limited 
patient accessibility.

The  therapeutic  effects  of  ketamine  are  largely  inde-
pendent  of  the  route  of  administration,  with  outcomes 
being  more  influenced  by  the  preparation,  psychothera-
peutic  guidance,  and  follow-up  care  provided  after  the 
ketamine-assisted  sessions  [78].  Unfortunately,  many 
clinics  that  focus  solely  on  the  pharmacological  aspects 
of  ketamine  administration  often  co-administer  benzo-
diazepines  to  suppress  the  conscious  experience.  This 
approach not only diminishes the therapeutic processing 
of the experience but may also interfere with ketamine’s 
action as an NMDA receptor antagonist.

Current  treatment  protocols  that  rely  on  pharmaco-
logical  intervention  alone,  without  the  integration  of 
psychotherapeutic  support,  overlook  a  critical  compo-
nent of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Studies consistently 
demonstrate  that  the  combination  of  ketamine  or  sero-
tonergic  psychedelics  with  psychotherapeutic  guidance 
significantly  enhances  and  prolongs  their  therapeutic 
effects.

In  Germany,  private  clinics  increasingly  offer  keta-
mine  for  major  depressive  disorder,  trauma-related 
conditions,  and  acute  suicidality.  Some  argue  that  the 
dissociative effects of Ketamine are not to be considered 
psychedelic and remain skeptical of their potential. Ket-
amine-Assisted  Psychotherapy  (KAP),  which  combines 
ketamine´s psychoactive and pharmaceutical effects with 
therapeutic guidance, is gaining traction due to its poten-
tial for longer-lasting benefits, though it remains under-
emphasized. While Esketamine, marketed as Spravato, is 
reimbursed by insurance, its high cost and lack of psycho-
therapeutic integration are points of contention. Expand-
ing access to KAP through proper education and training 
and  emphasizing  its  therapeutic  value  are  essential  for 
maximizing  ketamine’s  potential  in  mental  health  care. 
Unlike  ketamine,  classic  psychedelics  such  as  psilocybin 

 Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 12 of 20

have  shown  a  superior  safety  and  efficacy  profile,  with 
fewer  concerns  regarding  addiction  potential.  To  fully 
realize  the  therapeutic  potential  of  psychedelics,  includ-
ing ketamine, there is a growing need to shift away from 
a purely pharmacological approach toward one that inte-
grates evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, a 
model already established with other psychedelics.

Existing framework for PAT practitioners training 
and certification

There  exists  a  significant  mismatch  between  the  avail-
ability  of  psychotherapists  trained  in  PAT  methods  and 
the  demand  from  patients.  Despite  the  lengthy  training 
required  for  psychotherapists  to  obtain  licensure,  spe-
cialized training for PAT is still nascent, and in Germany, 
there  is  currently  no  established  integration  of  psyche-
delic treatment approaches in the curriculum for psycho-
therapist  training  [79].  Previous  attempts  to  establish  a 
recognized  curriculum  for  this  specialized  therapy  have 
not yet been accredited by official regulatory bodies.

Those  programs  that  do  exist  range  from  informal 
semi-therapeutic  training  to  elite,  expensive  and  time-
extensive  courses  that  encompass  basic  neuroscience, 
supervision  by  experts,  and  experiential  learning  with 
both  pharmacological  and  non-pharmacological  inter-
ventions.  Nonetheless,  none  of  these  programs  have 
achieved  certification  by  German  medical  or  psycho-
therapeutic  boards.  These  courses  might  provide  an 
advantage when applying to be part of clinical trials using 
psychedelics, however they do not provide official certifi-
cation to use these substances in therapy.

struggle  to  justify  the  extensive  time  required  for  these 
sessions  within  a  billing  system  that  limits  the  weekly 
therapy  hours.  Critically,  the  regulatory  agency  lacks 
mechanisms  to  assess  the  qualifications  on  PAT  of  the 
psychiatrists  applying  to  administer  these  sessions.  This 
model,  although  functional  in  a  smaller  country,  raises 
concerns about its scalability and the potential for errors 
as the popularity of these treatments increase.

US framework and experience with provider guidelines 
and training

As  the  country  closest  to  marketing  authorization,  the 
USA  has  a  head  start  in  the  consideration  of  require-
ments for training of PAT practitioners and their accredi-
tation.  [83].  For  the  last  two  years  diverse  voices  from 
academia and industry have attempted to create a licens-
ing  Board  which  would  have  the  political  gravity,  finan-
cial  backing,  and  academic  credibility  to  establish  an 
accepted  national  board  and  a  testing  procedure  which 
could be implemented for the entire country. Some of the 
authors have first-hand experience in these attempts and 
from experience can attest to the difficulty of the task.

Two major issues that have made the creation of such 
a board so difficult is the issue of grandfathering an older 
generation  of  mental  health  professionals  with  limited 
training  in  cultural  competency,  and  how  to  handle  the 
political hot potato of how to integrate knowledge from 
traditional,  and  underground  facilitators,  often  from 
Indigenous people groups in the Americas, who are com-
ing from healing traditions outside of the Western medi-
cal system.

Swiss model for PAT training

US & Canadian training models for psychedelic practitioners

The Swiss model offers an instructive case study. Since its 
inception around 2014, this approach has allowed psychi-
atrists to apply for special permission to use psychedelics 
in therapy [80, 81].

Training  in  PAT,  based  on  the  training  program  of 
the  Swiss  Medical  Association  for  Psycholytic  Therapy 
(SÄPT)  comprises  the  acquisition  of  theoretical  con-
tent  based  on  scientific  research  outcomes,  frameworks 
and  settings,  psychotherapeutic  content  of  the  sessions, 
hands-on  training  in  group  and  individual  exercises, 
supervision, dealing with emergency situations and psy-
chedelic  self-experience  in  order  to  develop  an  under-
standing  of  the  client  while  taking  the  treatment  [82]. 
Alarmingly, this critical course work is not mandatory.

However, despite these inroads, PAT is far from stand-
ard  integration  into  curricula  of  psychiatric  or  psycho-
therapeutic training and while this has enabled access to 
MDMA,  psilocybin,  and  LSD  for  the  Swiss  population, 
it presents numerous challenges: the application process 
must be repeated for each session, and psychiatrists often 

Despite  these  difficulties,  experience  with  PAT  in  the 
MAPS clinical studies and the training provided to thera-
pists participating in the trials have deepened the knowl-
edge of how to work successfully with these substances, 
and  MAPS  practitioners  have  contributed  to  a  frame-
work  which  takes  some  of  the  most  critical  issues  into 
account [84].

The  proposed  framework  from  Rochester  and  col-
leagues [85] outlines a dual-tier approach to practitioner 
credentialing,  comprising  a  primary  facilitator  and  pre-
scriber who holds a license or appropriate credentials in a 
mental health profession, and a secondary facilitator who 
possesses at least a bachelor’s level degree or equivalent. 
In this structure, the secondary facilitator operates under 
the supervision of the primary facilitator [85]. While this 
model aligns with current best practices, it remains sub-
ject to evolution, as ongoing research may explore alter-
native facilitation methodologies.

The development of the Rochester model was a three-
stage process. In stage one, an expert committee outlined 

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202 

Page 13 of 20

and drafted the essential issues. In the second and third 
stages,  the  committee  reached  out  consecutively  to  a 
broad  range  of  scholars,  researchers,  practitioners,  and 
therapists  across  Canada,  all  united  by  a  shared  interest 
in psychedelic medicine. They were united by the recog-
nition that working with the non-ordinary states of con-
sciousness mediated by psychedelics and entheogens can 
carry some risks and requires specialized training.

The  educational  portion  includes  foundational  learn-
ing  about  the  therapeutic,  spiritual,  and  ritual  uses  of 
psychedelics cross-culturally and throughout human his-
tory.  Trainees  would  learn  about  current  and  evolving 
research on psychedelics and the ethics of working with 
people  experiencing  a  non-ordinary  state  of  conscious-
ness  (NOSC).  This  would  also  include  training  in  harm 
reduction,  trauma,  and  addiction,  as  well  as  behavioral 
pharmacology,  including  psychotropic  drugs,  therapeu-
tic  indications,  and  the  societal  impact  of  substances. 
All trainees would be required to engage in multicultural 
study  and  training,  including  theoretical  frameworks 
and  practical  aspects  of  working  with  those  from  mar-
ginalized and racialized communities. Finally, it requires 
training  for  individuals  to  practice  as  skilled  facilitators 
and integration counselors for psychedelic treatment ses-
sions, which includes both didactics and supervised prac-
tice,  as  well  as  personal  supervised  experiences  in  the 
form of fieldwork.

Facilitators require a minimum of 100 h of supervised 
PAT  experience,  inclusive  of  three  completed  cases 

encompassing  diverse  individuals  undergoing  NOSC, 
alongside  48  h  of  direct  client  interaction  and  should 
refrain from practicing beyond their established areas of 
expertise.  The  Rochester  training  model  is  being  imple-
mented in the interdisciplinary approach for psychedelic 
practitioners at the University of Ottawa, where learners 
can receive a MA degree in Psychedelic and Conscious-
ness Studies [86].

This model specifically notes that elders in Indigenous 
entheogen  traditions  or  ordained  clergy  of  recognized, 
licensed  entheogen  religions  have  internal  credentialing 
and do not need additional credentials for the entheogens 
they  are  apprenticed  in,  emphasizing  the  importance  of 
respecting  and  preserving  these  traditions  amidst  the 
establishment of regulatory criteria and standards.

Core competencies and prerequisites—PAT training US Model

The Rochester model sets out a list of core and pre-req-
uisite  competencies  required  for  the  safe  and  effective 
facilitation  of  psychedelic  sessions  safely  and  effectively 
(Table  1).  Both  primary  and  secondary  facilitators  are 
expected to provide evidence of such training, be mem-
bers  of  accountability  groups,  as  well  as  engage  in  con-
tinuing education as appropriate.

Notably,  for  the  MAPS  sponsored  German  localized 
clinical  trials  for  MDMA  in  PTSD  trainers  with  expe-
riences  in  PAT  were  brought  in  from  the  USA,  as  per 
MAPS  protocol,  these  trainers  all  had  been  required  to 
have at least one session where they took MDMA in the

same  conditions  the  patients  would  have  experienced 
MDMA,  or  had  some  other  suitable  supervised  experi-
ence  of  a  non-ordinary  state  of  consciousness  [84]. This 
is a recommendation in the Rochester framework, in line 
with best practices in the field, and may become a consid-
eration in any eventual accreditation process [87].

Self-experience  is  a  standard  component  of  psycho-
therapy  training,  serving  purposes  that  extend  beyond 
merely  enhancing  empathy  or  deepening  understand-
ing of the patient’s experience. It also provides therapists 
with  an  opportunity  for  personal  psychological  main-
tenance.  This  aspect  of  self-care  is  particularly  criti-
cal  for  therapists  working  with  non-ordinary  states  of 
consciousness,  whether  induced  pharmacologically  or 
through non-pharmacological means. Such practices not 
only  prepare  therapists  to  better  navigate  the  therapeu-
tic  process  but  also  help  safeguard  their  mental  health, 
ensuring they remain effective and resilient when engag-
ing  with  patients’  trauma  and’  vulnerable  psychological 
states.

Psychedelic therapy practitioners accreditation—modeled 
on the German certificate for emergency medicine

The  presence  of  two  individuals  during  PAT  sessions 
has  become  typical  practice,  and  it  is  recommended 
that  a  similar  approach  in  the  German  context  be 
adopted  [84,  85].  Having  two  individuals  present  pro-
vides  oversight  and  accountability,  particularly  as  the 
psychedelic takes effect and the patient enters a vulner-
able state. One of these individuals should be a licensed 
practitioner and medical personnel, such as a psychia-
trist  or  psychologist  with  psychotherapy  experience, 

preferably with experience in treatment resistant cases 
and/or  PTSD.  Special  emphasis  is  placed  on  physical 
safety  and  emotional  support  during  the  consumption 
of psychedelics [49].

To  implement  this,  we  propose  a  novel  PAT  training 
program  (Table  2)  adapted  to  the  German  condition, 
called  Bildung  und  Nutzung  von  Traumähnlichen-
zuständen (BuNT) which loosely translates as Training 
and  Kaleidoscope  Dream-like  States,  akin  to  those  in 
emergency medicine, with certification administered by 
local  physicians’  chambers  (Ärztekammer)  or  external 
bodies.

Drawing  parallels  with  Germany’s  “Zusatzbezeich-
nung  Notfallmedizin”  (Emergency  Medicine)  certifica-
tion,  which  provides  training  for  doctors  from  many 
specializations,  this  training  program  provides  a  flex-
ible  but  solid  core  curriculum  for  PAT.  To  qualify  for 
emergency  medicine  certification,  physicians  must 
have  at  least  two  years  of  clinical  experience  and  six 
months  experience  in  the  emergency  room  or  inten-
sive  care  unit.  The  certification  process  includes  an 
intensive  80-h  course.  Upon  completion  candidates 
need to gather a total of 50 cases of supervised practi-
cal  experience  in  emergency  scenarios  followed  by  an 
oral examination by 2 experts (Supplementary Table 3). 
Certification is then granted by the German Landesär-
ztekammer (State Chamber of Physicians). The success 
of this training model in preparing a wide array of phy-
sicians  with  different  specializations  to  handle  acute 
medical emergencies suggests its potential applicability 
to psychedelic therapy for therapists trained in different 
schools of psychotherapy.

Table 2  BuNT: Bildung und Nutzung von Traumähnlichen-zuständen (Kalidescope Dream-like States)—a new comprehensive 100 h 
PAT training model for German practitioners

This model contains all of the content also present in the Rochester Model adapted to a German context and is to be given in primarily in German with certified 
instructors [88]

Perez Rosal et al. BMC Medical Education         (2024) 24:1202

The  BuNT  model  involving  a  medical  doctor  paired 
with  a  nurse  practitioner  or  psychotherapist  mirrors 
the  interdisciplinary  approach  employed  in  emergency 
medicine  involving  paramedics  and  medical  doctors. 
This  method  creates  robust  safety  nets,  benefiting  both 
practitioners  and  patients  by  ensuring  a  comprehensive 
care  environment  where  responsibilities  and  expertise 
are shared. Such interdisciplinary collaboration is essen-
tial  for  maintaining  high  standards  of  patient  safety  and 
therapeutic effectiveness.

In  the  context  of  training  PAT  practitioners,  Com-
petency-Based  Education  (CBE)  emerges  as  the  most 
appropriate educational framework. Although other pri-
vate  trainings  in  Germany  utilize  the  Outcome-Based 
Education  (OBE)  framework,  we  believe  that  Compe-
tency-Based  Education  (CBE)  offers  distinct  advantages 
for training practitioners in PAT.

CBE emphasizes the attainment of specific competen-
cies  that  are  crucial  for  ensuring  the  safe  and  effective 
administration  of  PAT.  This  approach  aligns  seamlessly 
with the Rochester model, which outlines a comprehen-
sive set of core competencies necessary for practitioners. 
CBE’s  flexibility  allows  trainees  to  progress  at  their  own 
pace, ensuring mastery of each competency through ade-
quate assessment and practical application. This method 
is  particularly  effective  in  accommodating  the  diverse 
educational  backgrounds  of  practitioners,  from  those 
with  traditional  psychotherapeutic  training  to  individu-
als  rooted  in  Indigenous  healing  practices.  By  focusing 
on demonstrable skills and knowledge, CBE ensures that 
all practitioners meet consistent, high standards of care, 
crucial for the sensitive nature of work with psychedelics. 
This  structured  yet  adaptable  approach  supports  ongo-
ing  professional  development  and  integration  of  new 
research  findings,  essential  for  the  evolving  field  of  psy-
chedelic-assisted therapy.

In  2018,  the  Bundesärztekammer  (Federal  Chamber 
of  Physicians)  reformed  the  (Model)  Specialty  Training 
Regulations [89] to incorporate a competency-based edu-
cation framework. This reform aligns with our proposed 
training  model,  which  also  adopts  competency-based 
education  principles.  As  such,  our  model  is  particularly 
suited to serve as a guideline for developing the necessary 
competencies for a German certified specialty training in 
PAT. By leveraging the established framework of the Bun-
desärztekammer, our approach ensures that the training 
is robust, standardized, and tailored to meet the specific 
requirements  of  PAT,  thereby  fostering  a  high  level  of 
professional readiness and efficacy among practitioners.

Training in transition

Ketamine,  traditionally  dubbed  a  dissociative  anes-
thetic  known  for  its  ability  to  induce  psychedelic  states, 

is currently approved as an anesthetic and for managing 
acute  pain.  It  is  widely  utilized  in  emergency  medicine 
due to its favorable safety profile. Additionally, a growing 
body  of  research  supports  its  therapeutic  potential  for 
mental  health  disorders,  leading  to  its  "off-label"  use  in 
several German clinics.

Given  that  ketamine  is  accessible  off-label  for  treat-
ing  mental  health  conditions,  a  rising  number  of  clinics 
and  hospitals  offer  it  for  severe  cases,  with  approaches 
ranging  from  basic  pharmacological  intervention  with-
out  therapeutic  guidance  to  comprehensive  psyche-
delic-assisted  psychotherapy  including  all  modalities 
and  follow-ups.  It  is  concerning  that  some  ketamine 
applications  occur  without  standardized  PAT  training, 
posing  risks  and  reducing  its  therapeutic  effects  when 
not  accompanied  by  appropriate  therapeutic  support. 
Conversely,  this  situation  also  presents  an  opportunity 
for  therapists  to  gain  experience  in  psychedelic-assisted 
therapy  under  supervision  as  MDMA  therapy  becomes 
more widely available, bridging the gap during this tran-
sitional period.

Another  viable  method  for  acquiring  the  necessary 
supervision hours to qualify in PAT could involve enroll-
ing as a therapist in research studies that utilize psyche-
delic  substances  to  treat  mental  health  disorders.  With 
the increasing acceptance of the potential of psychedelics 
as  medicine  among  German  psychiatrists,  a  number  of 
studies are currently underway or in the planning stages.

Similar to conventional psychotherapy, and particularly 
with  the  emerging  approach  of  combining  psychedelic 
compounds with therapeutic interventions for the treat-
ment  of  severe  and  treatment-resistant  mental  health 
conditions,  it  is  recommended  that  practitioners  con-
tinually update their knowledge in the rapidly advancing 
field of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. Furthermore, 
it is advisable to seek expert consultation and supervision 
following  the  completion  of  any  certification  program, 
especially regarding complex cases and any special issues 
that may arise, to ensure adherence to best practices and 
the latest scientific developments.

Cultural barriers to therapeutic alliance—when 
not to attempt PAT

One  of  the  significant  causes  of  PTSD  is  in  individuals 
fleeing  from  war  or  persecution  from  places  outside  of 
Europe  [90–92].  Refugees  from  the  Middle  East,  Africa 
and  Asia  who  have  settled  in  Europe  may  have  experi-
enced trauma from persecution in their home countries 
but  once  they  have  settled  in  Europe,  many  have  also 
been  demonstrated  to  be  further  traumatized  by  micro-
aggressions based on their national origin or racialization 
in  their  new  home  [91–95].  This  racialization  also  has 
been found to cause a higher prevalence of PTSD in the

2nd  generation  German-citizen  children  of  immigrants 
and/or BIPOC Germans (who may also have White Ger-
man  parents),  which  is  compounded  by  the  inability  to 
describe  and  quantify  the  degree  of  the  problem.  Invis-
ibility  of  one’s  pain  potentiates  trauma,  and  this  can  be 
seen  in  the  decades-long  refusal  to  acknowledge  that 
racialization (discrimination based on shade of skin and 
presumed heritage) contributes to differences in life and 
health outcomes in Germany [91, 93, 96]. Mental health 
practitioners should expect to encounter such patients in 
their career, considering that 19.3 million people living in 
Germany have immigrant backgrounds, and this number 
does not include the German citizen children of BIPOC 
persons. Furthermore, native German citizens who have 
grown  up  in  Germany  but  who  are  not  racialized  as 
White  may  also  experience  racial  trauma  through  being 
otherized [93, 95, 97].

Racial  trauma  and  how  to  treat  it  has  not  been  tradi-
tionally  a  part  of  the  curriculum  for  European  schools 
of  therapy  and  only  recently  has  a  comprehensive  treat-
ment in the literature [98, 99]. Mental health practition-
ers  should  understand  and  take  note  if  they  have  the 
training required to be able to treat individuals who may 
have experienced trauma resulting from their skin colour, 
ethnic or national origins [96, 98]. For this among other 
reasons, certification of facilitators who are competent in 
the treatment of racial trauma is imperative.

Establishing a therapeutic alliance with patients of dif-
ferent  cultural  backgrounds  and  belief  systems  might 
be  challenging  and  difficult  to  navigate  for  those  who 
do  not  have  experience  in  culturally  informed  therapy. 
Becoming  aware  of  the  epistemology  and  limitations 
of  transcultural  therapy  attempts  should  be  part  of  any 
training,  especially  when  entering  vulnerable  states  of 
consciousness.

Licensed  practitioners  who  do  not  have  competence 
surrounding racial trauma should not attempt PAT alone; 
One  of  the  two  facilitators  must  have  expertise  in  treat-
ing  racial  trauma.  This  may  be  a  new  concept  for  many 
classically  trained  psychologists  in  Europe,  however 
knowledge  gained  in  the  course  of  MAPS  clinical  trials 
has  provided  evidence  for  the  importance  of  experience 
in  this  area  [100].  Licensed  mental  health  practition-
ers  must  complete  training  in  addressing  racial  trauma 
before  attempting  PAT  for  patients  with  this  indica-
tion, as was done with the independent evaluators in the 
MAPS Phase 3 trials [84].

Our  model  designed  for  Germany  includes  a  module 
to provide initial training in this area and includes addi-
tional  cultural  competency  and  racial  trauma  modules 
which in the future should be a component of all psycho-
therapy training curricula, as is currently in the USA and 
Canada.

High unmet needs for trauma therapy drives rapid 
regulatory changes in Ukraine

When  the  full-scale  war  broke  out  in  February  of  2022 
Ukraine’s  policy  around  psychedelics  was  among  the 
most  restrictive  in  the  world.  No  use,  not  even  for 
research,  was  allowed.  Today  accelerated  regulatory 
changes are being made with the prospect of allowing use 
in clinical trials as soon as 2024/2025.

The drivers for these changes are a projected need for 
psychological support for a staggering 15 million Ukrain-
ians,  with  3–4  million  Ukrainians  requiring  extended 
psychiatric care [101, 102]. These projections are in line 
with  large  population  studies  showing  that  wars  cause 
larger proportions of the population to experience clini-
cal symptoms of depression (up to 88.0%) and anxiety (up 
to 80.0%) [103].

In this light the regulators in Ukraine are realizing the 
need for regulatory change that would allow at least some 
form  of  access  to  PAT  as  a  highly  efficacious  form  of 
PTSD treatment. It is likely that the first area of focus will 
be  PTSD  in  the  armed  forces  population.  A  large-scale 
pilot  study  that  would  assess  the  effects  of  MDMA-AT 
in group therapy format is being drafted (Olga Chernoloz 
personal communication).

Ukraine is looking to align its policy with the EU coun-
terparts. The matter of psychological recovery and reha-
bilitation  carries  broad-reaching  socioeconomic  impact 
beyond  borders  because  the  extent  of  the  traumatized 
reaches  across  Europe.  For  Germany  success  in  the 
Ukrainian context could have impacts on practice as 1.13 
million  Ukrainians  fled  to  Germany  because  of  the  war, 
and many will require treatment for trauma.

The trauma of others

Asylum  seekers  and  refugees  experience  sharply  higher 
rates of PTSD (between 20%-59%) in Germany, creating a 
greater need for services in this specific high-need demo-
graphic  [90,  92].  However,  current  German  legislation 
mandates that insurance coverage for psychotherapy for 
refugees  is  only  accessible  after  residing  in  the  country 
for at least 18 months—except for refugees from Ukraine. 
However,  this  coverage  may  still  not  provide  access 
to  necessary  psychotherapy  services,  as  even  Ukrain-
ians must possess fluent German language skills because 
interpreter  costs  are  not  covered  [104].  Furthermore, 
Germany  has  taken  two  additional  steps  in  preventing 
psychotherapy services for non-Germans.

Germany  amended  the  criteria  for  serious  conditions 
which  protect  a  patient  from  deportation  in  2016,  spe-
cifically  removing  PTSD  from  this  list  despite  the  high 
rates  among  this  population.  The  assertion  that  PTSD 
does  not  pose  a  significant  threat  to  life  and  well-being 
is  inherently  flawed.  Specifically,  the  act  of  returning

individuals  to  a  country  where  they  have  previously  felt 
or  still  perceive  their  safety  as  compromised  can  trigger 
suicidal tendencies. It is essential to acknowledge that for 
humanitarian reasons a PTSD diagnosis alone should be 
justifiable  grounds  to  block  deportation  of  traumatized 
refugees.

Secondly,  in  2019,  the  "Ordered  Return  Act"  (Geord-
nete-Rückkehr”-Gesetz)  was  created  which  downgraded 
the  professional  role  of  psychotherapists  in  regards  to 
assessing  whether  a  refugee  may  be  deported  due  to 
a  serious  mental  illness.  The  act  established  that  only 
psychiatrists,  but  not  psychotherapists,  may  prevent 
deportation  under  the  new  law,  a  blow  to  the  centrality 
of psychotherapists in diagnosing serious mental illness. 
This  stipulation,  compounded  by  the  relatively  fewer 
number of psychiatrists available, further reduces access 
to  essential  mental  health  services  needed  to  prevent 
deportation.

This  pattern  of  legislative  changes  and  restrictions  on 
access  to  mental  health  care  raises  significant  concerns 
about  the  prioritization  of  mental  health  services  for 
non-German people in Germany [104].

Conclusion and recommendations
The United States has slowly begun reversing the legisla-
tion  created  to  uphold  the  War  on  Drugs  by  encourag-
ing research into the safety and efficacy of drugs such as 
psilocybin,  LSD,  DMT,  MDMA,  ketamine,  and  others, 
for the treatment of diverse conditions including but not 
limited  to  depression,  anxiety,  PTSD,  and  substance  use 
disorders.

With the several psychedelic compounds being granted 
breakthrough therapy designation, many reaching phase 
III  trials  with  promising  results,  and  the  rescheduling 
of  psychedelics  by  Australia,  the  EMA  is  on  the  path-
way  to  loosen  50  year  old  restrictions  on  psychedelic 
use  and  Germany  must  find  pathways  to  accommodate 
the  research  and  use  of  psychedelics,  which  includes 
ensuring  the  Ministry  of  Health  (Bundesministerium 
für  Gesundheit,  BfArM  and  the  accrediting  bodies  ÄK) 
is ready to grant breakthrough status to provide therapy 
and  study  psychedelics  in  the  same  way  the  FDA  has 
done.

In  addition  to  regulatory  infrastructure,  Germany 
must  also  provide  educational  resources  to  research-
ers  to  promote  safety  and  good  research  practices.  A 
"Weiterbildungsordnung"  (Specialty  Training  Regu-
lation)  by  the  German  Bundesärztekammer  should 
also  be  established  to  ensure  a  nationwide  standard  of 
training  quality  and  offer  official  certification  to  prac-
tice in this modality. Moreover, funding must be made 

available  to  train  practitioners  to  provide  PAT,  for 
racialized populations and those suffering from mental 
health conditions with high unmet needs.

The  implementation  of  PAT  in  Germany  requires  a 
multifaceted  approach  encompassing  ethical  guide-
lines, training programs, cultural competency, and reg-
ulatory oversight. Collaboration between governmental 
agencies, regulatory authorities, and healthcare profes-
sionals  is  essential  for  successful  implementation.  By 
addressing  these  considerations,  Germany  can  ensure 
that  patients  receive  ethical  and  skilled  treatment  in 
psychedelic therapy settings.
