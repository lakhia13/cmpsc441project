Abstract
Comorbidity between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and other mental disorders is common. Although no specific 
pharmacological treatments have been approved for the treatment of BPD, many drugs, including antidepressants such as 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mood stabilizers, second-generation antipsychotics, and even benzodiaz-
epines, are routinely prescribed off label. Nonetheless, recommendations for off-label drugs in these patients are highly varied, 
with a notable lack of agreement among clinical guidelines. The most common reason for pharmacological treatment and 
polypharmacy in these patients is comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. In this context, we reviewed major clinical 
guidelines and the available data on pharmacotherapy in patients with BPD to develop practical recommendations to facilitate 
decision-making in routine clinical practice, thus helping clinicians to select the optimal therapeutic approach in patients with 
BPD who have comorbid disorders. This review confirmed that no clear recommendations for the pharmacological treatment 
are available in clinical guidelines. Therefore, based on the available evidence, we have developed a series of recommenda-
tions for pharmacotherapy in patients with BPD who present the four most common comorbidities (affective, anxiety, eating, 
and drug use disorders). Here, we discuss the recommended treatment approach for each of these comorbid disorders. The 
prescription of medications should be considered only as an adjunct to BPD-specific psychotherapy. Polypharmacy and the 
use of unsafe drugs (i.e., with a risk of overdose) should be avoided. Our review highlights the need for more research to 
provide more definitive guidance and to develop treatment algorithms.

1  Introduction

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental 
illness with an estimated community prevalence of 2.7% 
[1–3]. In individuals seeking treatment at outpatient men-
tal health clinics, the prevalence is approximately 10%, 
with rates as high as 20% in psychiatric inpatients [2, 3]. 
BPD is a heterogeneous disorder that may include emo-
tion dysregulation (intense, rapidly changing emotions),

Key Points 

Comorbidity with other mental disorders is common in 
individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). 
Pharmacotherapy is substantially more common than 
recommended in clinical guidelines.

Several approaches are proposed to guide the pharmaco-
logical management of patients with BPD with the most 
common comorbidities (affective, anxiety, eating, and 
drug use disorders).

The prescription of medications should only be con-
sidered as an adjunct to BPD-specific psychotherapy. 
Polypharmacy and unsafe drugs should be avoided.

Several different treatment algorithms and therapeutic 
recommendations are provided for use in routine clinical 
practice to treat patients with BPD and comorbidities.

impulsivity (with dysfunctional behaviors such as self-
harm, drug abuse, or binge eating), and unstable iden-
tity and interpersonal relationships. Not surprisingly, this 
clinical heterogeneity is often associated with many other 
mental disorders and somatic conditions [1].

Other mental disorders are common in patients with 
BPD, as evidenced by the high comorbidity rates reported 
in  numerous  cross-sectional  and  longitudinal  studies 
[2–5]. The findings of an epidemiological study in the 
USA suggested that BPD is rarely diagnosed alone, with 
high lifetime prevalence rates in these patients for anxi-
ety disorders (84.8%), mood disorders (82.7%), substance 
use disorders (SUD; 78.2%), and eating disorders (ED; 
33.7%) [4, 5]. Similarly, several other mental disorders 
also present high rates of comorbidity with BPD, includ-
ing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and bipolar disorder [5]. 
However, it is important to consider that the symptoms of 
BPD frequently overlap with several disorders that share 
the same features. For example, while impulsivity with 
drug abuse or binge eating is a key marker of BPD, it is 
also a common symptom in other disorders [2].

In patients with BPD, co-occurring psychiatric disor-
ders are often chronic, and may be associated with severely 
impaired social and occupational functioning that requires 
social support; moreover, they are often difficult to treat 
[2, 6]. Since the first randomized control trial (RCT) of 
psychotherapy for patients with BPD was performed in 
1993 [7], more than ten different manualized psychothera-
pies for BPD have been evaluated [8]. Of those psycho-
logical interventions, five—dialectical behavioral therapy 
(DBT),  mentalization-based  treatment  (MBT),  schema 
focused therapy (SFT), transference-focused psychother-
apy (TFP), and systems training for emotional predictabil-
ity and problem solving (STEPPS)—have been established 
as evidence-based treatments (EBT) for BPD. To date, the 
two approaches that have received the most attention, as 
evidenced by the number of clinical trials performed, are 
DBT and MBT [8]. To better manage the complex comor-
bidities  associated  with  BPD,  several  evidence-based 
psychotherapeutic approaches have been adapted for use 
in this challenging patient profile, especially those with 
comorbid SUDs, EDs, and PTSD [8].

Unfortunately, not all individuals have access to these 
intensive, highly specialized treatments, which are difficult 
to implement in most health care facilities due to insufficient 
resources [8–11]. In this context, it is not surprising that 
many clinicians routinely prescribe drugs for the treatment 
of patients with BPD, despite the weak evidence supporting 
the value of pharmacotherapy to improve core BPD symp-
toms, interpersonal impairment, and functional difficulties 
[12].

No psychotropic drugs have been officially approved for 
the specific treatment of BPD. Although some studies have 
been performed, most of these are small, with relatively 
short treatment periods and a wide range of different meas-
ures. In addition, most RCTs excluded patients with comor-
bidities. In short, the evidence to support pharmacotherapy 
in this setting is weak [8, 12].

In routine clinical practice, many drugs are commonly 
prescribed “by default” in patients with BPD, as evidenced 
by data from the USA and some European countries, where 
≥ 80% of patients with BPD are on pharmacotherapy, and 
50% are taking three or more drugs [12–18]. Although some 
clinical guidelines recommend pharmacotherapy to treat cer-
tain BPD symptoms, such as impulsivity, emotional distur-
bances, or cognitive-perceptual symptoms, recent expert rec-
ommendations do not support the use of pharmacotherapy 
as a first-line treatment or for specific domains [2, 9, 19].

The main factor associated with pharmacological treat-
ment or polypharmacy is comorbidity with other mental 
health disorders, most notably—and congruently—affective, 
anxiety, and eating disorders [14, 15, 20]. Nonetheless, phar-
macotherapy in BPD patients is widespread, even in patients 
with no comorbidities. For example, one study involving a 
sample of 457 individuals with BPD found that close to 80% 
of comorbidity-free patients with BPD were also receiving 
pharmacological treatment (62.9% received antidepressants, 
59.7% benzodiazepines, 22.6% mood stabilizers, and 27.4% 
antipsychotics) with 42% on polypharmacy [15].

Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors (SSRI) such as citalopram and fluoxetine, 
are the most commonly prescribed drugs for BPD, despite 
the lack of evidence to support their use [18, 20]. Gunder-
son et al. [21], found that the prescription of antidepres-
sants in patients with BPD was most commonly associated 
with comorbidity for affective disorders (odds ratio 2.77). 
Although the use of benzodiazepines is not recommended 
due to their highly addictive nature and their potential for 
behavioral  disinhibition,  prescription  rates  nevertheless 
remain high, particularly in patients with affective and anx-
ious disorders who do not present SUD [15, 18, 20].

The prescription of mood stabilizers, such as topiramate 
and valproate, in patients with BPD is associated with the 
presence of anxiety and eating disorders; by contrast, antip-
sychotics (mostly atypical ones such as quetiapine and olan-
zapine) are not associated with any axis I comorbidity [18, 
20].

The pharmacological treatment of BPD has been evalu-
ated in clinical guidelines and in several reviews [2, 12, 
19].  However,  no  consensus  on  therapeutic  indications 
has been reached. Importantly, none of those publications 
have addresses the specific question of the pharmacological 
treatment of comorbidities in BPD. This is relevant given 
that comorbidity with other mental disorders is common in 

patients with BPD, which partially explains why many indi-
viduals with BPD receive pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the 
specific drug that should be prescribed for a given comorbid-
ity is not clear, in large part due to the weak evidence base. 
In this context, the aim of the present review was to better 
clarify this question. In addition, we aimed to develop prac-
tical recommendations for the pharmacological treatment 
of patients with the most common comorbidities. Below, 
we discuss each comorbid disorder separately, taking into 
account the course of these disorders in individuals with 
BPD over time.

2   Comorbid Mood Disorders

Mood disorders are one of the most common disorders in 
individuals with BPD. Up to 80% of patients with BPD 
present one or more episodes of major depressive disor-
der (MDD) in their lifetime and 10–30% of patients with 
MDD have co-occurring BPD [2, 3, 21, 22]. BPD is strongly 
associated  with  many  mood  disorders,  especially  MDD 
and dysthymia, with an odds ratio (OR) for any mood dis-
order of 14.93 [4]. Even in BPD patients without MDD, 
depressive symptoms and transient “micro-depressions” 
are common and difficult to clinically differentiate from 
MDD [23]. Skodol et al. [24] found that having BPD was 
the most robust predictor of persistent MDD; that study also 
found that when both of these disorders co-occur, the MDD 
episodes last longer and the interepisodic interval may be 
shorter. Improvement in MDD is often predicted by a prior 
decrease in BPD symptoms; by contrast, the reverse is not 
necessarily true: improvements in MDD are not always fol-
lowed by a reduction in BPD symptoms [21]. Longitudinal 
studies suggest that treatment for BPD may yield positive 
results in both disorders and that remission of BPD is a pre-
dictor of MDD remission [25].

In patients with comorbid BPD and MDD, the available 
clinical evidence for pharmacological treatment is insuf-
ficient to establish any reliable recommendations. Despite 
these limitations, we have developed a practical treatment 
algorithm and recommendations, based on our review of 
the evidence and our clinical experience (Fig. 1). In clini-
cal practice, the first step is to try to differentiate between 
“micro-depressions” in BPD, which are a common compo-
nent of BPD psychopathology, and MDD, which is a clini-
cally distinct entity. Table 1 presents several practical hall-
marks that may indicate the presence of micro-depressions 
in BPD. In these patients, depressive symptoms are usually 
transient and stress related, rarely last for more than a few 
days, and are usually precipitated by stress and interper-
sonal factors. However, given the transitory nature of these 
micro-depressions, the presence of depressive symptoms 
in a cross-sectional assessment could suggest MDD, but 

491

also symptom duration is a key factor to consider [23]. 
In any case, it is essential to prioritize BPD-appropriate 
psychotherapy, rather than polypharmacy alone.

As Fig. 1 and Table 2 show, the recommended first-line 
treatment for a patient with BPD with a mild–moderate 
MDD episode is BPD-specific psychotherapy. Some clini-
cal guidelines on the treatment of MDD episodes (regardless 
of the presence or not of BPD) also recommend psycho-
therapeutic interventions for mild-to-moderate depression 
as a first-line treatment; however, the routine use of anti-
depressants should be avoided due to the poor risk–benefit 
ratio [26]. If the MDD episode is severe or fails to respond 
to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy can be considered. The 
mood disorder should be first treated with antidepressants 
following the recommendations of clinical guidelines for 
MDD [26–28].

A wide range of antidepressants, including SSRIs, selec-
tive norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs), selective ser-
otonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and 
others, are available to treat depressive episodes [26]. SSRIs 
such as fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram 
seem to be the first and most common option prescribed by 
clinicians for BPD [18, 20]. Antidepressants with an unsafe 
profile, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are not recommended 
due to the risk of overdose, lower tolerability profiles, and 
potential adverse reactions [2, 8].

Although mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium, valproate) are 
commonly prescribed in combination with antipsychotics 
in patients with MDD as adjunctive strategies [26,  28], 
there is a notable lack of studies investigating the effec-
tiveness of this approach in patients with comorbid BPD 
and MDD. Nevertheless, valproate in combination with 
antidepressants could be efficacious for treatment-resist-
ant MDD and has also shown some beneficial effects in 
patients with BPD [12, 27]. Lamotrigine was also found 
to  have  beneficial  effects  in  treatment-resistant  MDD 
[26–30]. Two small preliminary studies have suggested 
that this drug may have an effect on impulsivity, anger, 
and behavioral dyscontrol in BPD [12]. However, the large 
(n = 276) randomized clinical trial carried out by Craw-
ford et al. [31] in patients with BPD found no evidence 
to support the use of lamotrigine (400 mg/day) for the 
treatment of BPD symptoms. Similarly, the findings of a 
recent Cochrane systematic review did not support the use 
of lamotrigine for people with personality disorders [12].
Finally, several meta-analyses have found that atypical 
antipsychotics such as aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzap-
ine, and risperidone may be efficacious as an adjunctive 
treatment for individuals with MDD [26]. Some studies 
also suggest that these atypical antipsychotics may be use-
ful in the treatment of patients with BPD [12]. Therefore,

these second-generation antipsychotics could also be use-

Clearly,  pharmacological  treatment  in  patients  with 
comorbid BPD and MDD is important. However, we must 
also keep in mind that in BPD, drug therapy should only 

be considered an adjunct to psychological therapy [2]. In 
addition, the effects of prescription drugs need to be moni-
tored closely; if they are not effective and/or induce exces-
sive side effects, their use should be discontinued. If the 
response to pharmacological treatment is poor, the ineffec-
tive treatment should be discontinued. Additionally, every

risks, most notably those associated with polypharmacy 
(more than half of patients with BPD take three or more 
psychotropic medications) [18]. Although the main reason 
for pharmacological treatment or polypharmacy in BPD is 
comorbidity with psychiatric disorders, it is important to 
underscore the fact that most patients are medicated, even 
those with no comorbidities [15, 18]. A second risk is related 
to patient preferences for pharmacotherapy rather than psy-
chotherapy. Several meta-analyses have shown that the opti-
mal first-line treatment for this condition is BPD-specific 
psychological therapy, and these findings are reflected in 
the recommendations of most clinical guidelines [2, 8, 9]. 
Unfortunately, specialized psychotherapy for BPD is often 
not available, which explains why pharmacotherapy is some-
times used—inappropriately—as an alternative [9].

In short, in patients with BPD and comorbid MDD, anti-
depressant treatment should only be offered as an adjunct to 
psychological therapy. Interestingly, both BPD and MDD 
may respond to BPD-specific psychotherapy, which under-
scores the importance of prioritizing this treatment approach 
over polypharmacy [2, 23, 32].

3   Comorbid Anxiety Disorders

effort should be made to avoid combining several different 
antidepressants. Finally, polypharmacy should be avoided 
whenever possible, as should the use of unsafe drugs that 
have a risk of overdose (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) [2].
Although  antidepressant  treatment  can  be  helpful  in 
patients with comorbid BPD and MDD, it also carries some 

Lifetime comorbidity between BPD and anxiety disorders 
is high (84.8%) and patients with BPD are 14 times more 
likely  to  present  an  anxiety  disorder  [especially  panic 
disorder with agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder 
(GAD), and PTSD] [4, 5]. Some studies suggest that anxi-
ety disorders are relatively unstable over time in patients

with BPD, with a tendency to decrease significantly after 
10 years (although recurrence rates are high) [5].

departments, where benzodiazepines are prescribed to rap-
idly alleviate anger [15, 35].

Anxiety disorders can be treated with psychotherapy, 
pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both [33]. The treat-
ment plan should be chosen only after careful consideration 
of individual factors such as patient preferences, previous 
treatment attempts, and illness severity [33]. In patients with 
comorbid BPD and anxiety, the best approach may be to start 
psychotherapy, which all the main evidence-based treatment 
guidelines agree should be the first-line treatment for BPD 
[2, 10]. The psychological intervention with the highest level 
of evidence for the treatment of anxiety disorders is CBT 
[33]. Nonetheless, MBT or DBT, with specific modules such 
as emotional regulation, mindfulness, and distress tolerance, 
could be also a useful psychological intervention for the 
treatment of anxiety symptoms in BPD [11, 34].

When psychotherapy is unavailable or not as effective 
as expected, or if the patient expresses a preference for 
pharmacotherapy,  drug  therapy  should  be  considered. 
However, the patient must be fully informed about both 
the risks and benefits of the available pharmacological 
alternatives. SSRIs and SNRIs are recommended as first-
line drug therapy for anxiety disorders, mainly because 
drugs these are associated with fewer adverse effects than 
other therapeutic options such as TCAs or MAOIs [35, 
36]. Due to their efficacy and lack of major side effects, 
the SSRIs (escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, 
fluvoxamine, and paroxetine) and one SNRI (venlafaxine) 
have received the highest grade of recommendation [36].
For patients with comorbid BPD and anxiety disorder, 
treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs should only be recom-
mended when combined with BPD-specific psychotherapy. 
If the patient fails to respond to standard treatments, sev-
eral alternative strategies (e.g., atypical antipsychotics or 
anticonvulsants) can be considered, but never as first-line 
treatment and always keeping in mind the need to avoid 
polypharmacy and its attendant risks [9, 11, 35]. Despite 
the common use of low-dose atypical antipsychotics (e.g., 
quetiapine or olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (e.g., pre-
gabaline or gabapentine) as adjunctive treatments, these 
are not recommended in current guidelines as a first-line 
strategy (except for pregabalin for GAD) [36].

All clinical guidelines advise against the use of benzo-
diazepines due to their addictive potential as well as their 
capacity to increase suicidal tendencies and disinhibition 
(2). In real-world clinical practice, however, benzodiaz-
epines are commonly prescribed for the treatment of BPD 
[11, 15, 33]. The prescription of benzodiazepines in this 
patient population is likely attributable to several differ-
ent factors, including comorbidity with anxiety disorders, 
patient demand for sedatives, the tendency of many psy-
chiatrists to treat specific symptoms in these patients, and 
the clinical management of exacerbations in emergency 

4   Comorbid Eating Disorders

Eating disorders also present high rates of comorbidity with 
BPD. In a meta-analysis that examined the prevalence of 
personality disorders among individuals with EDs, BPD was 
present in 28% of patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), 25% 
of those with anorexia nervosa (AN) binge-eating/purging 
subtype (AN–BP), and 10.8% of patients with AN restrictive 
subtype (AN–R) [36]. Similarly, the prevalence of EDs (of 
any type) among individuals with BPD is elevated, ranging 
from 14% to 53%; the most common ED in these patients is 
eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) [5]. For-
tunately, the available data suggest that comorbidity rates 
between BPD and ED decrease significantly over time, with 
one study showing that most individuals with BPD who met 
criteria for ED experienced remission over time [5].

Anorexia nervosa is a serious condition associated with 
high rates of morbidity and mortality. In patients with severe 
AN comorbid with BPD, the general recommendations in 
clinical guidelines for AN should be followed in terms of 
treatment setting, day hospital treatment, psychotherapy, or 
nutritional management independently of BPD comorbid-
ity [39]. As all the clinical guidelines point out, there is a 
notable lack of evidence to support pharmacotherapy for 
AN, and most guidelines strongly recommend caution when 
prescribing drugs in this patient population due to the risk 
of medical complications. Nonetheless, some guidelines 
suggest that short-term treatment with SSRIs or low-dose 
antipsychotics (especially olanzapine) may be justified in 
certain cases, such as in patients with a critically low body 
mass index [39, 40].

For individuals with BPD and less severe, non-life-threat-
ening EDs (AN, BN, or EDNOS), the disorder should be 
managed concurrently with BPD-specific treatment, prefera-
bly coordinated by the BPD therapist [2]. Nevertheless, Car-
mona I Farrés et al. [41] suggested that comorbidity between 
BPD  and  EDs  predicted  early  dropout  from  DBT  skills 
training. In this regard, effective adaptations of DBT have 
been developed for individuals with comorbid BPD and ED, 
which could improve treatment retention in these patients [2, 
41]. For individuals who have difficulty accessing first-line 
psychotherapy or who do not respond to therapy, second-
line psychotherapy may be helpful. Although the current 
evidence base is weak, psychotropic medications, which 
may affect appetite and body weight, could be prescribed as 
an adjunct to psychotherapy [39, 40]. This pharmacological 
treatment includes antidepressants (SSRIs; e.g., fluoxetine), 
antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine), psychostimulants (e.g., lis-
dexamfetamine), and anticonvulsants (e.g., topiramate) [37].

5   Comorbid Substance Use Disorders

BPD is generally characterized by greater impulsivity and 
a preference for short-term rewards. This inability to focus 
on the long term predisposes patients to develop SUD [5]. 
The overall lifetime prevalence of SUD in patients with 
BPD is approximately 78% [2–4]. However, longitudinal 
studies show that despite the high prevalence of SUD in 
this patient population, prevalence rates tend to decrease 
over time [5].

The first-line treatment for patients with comorbid BPD 
and SUD is psychological therapy, although it is important 
to note that the presence of comorbid SUD increases the risk 
of early dropout from psychotherapy for BPD [2, 41, 42]. 
Specific treatment manuals designed to lower the risk of 
treatment dropout and improve efficacy have been developed 
for patients with comorbid BPD and SUD [40]. In these 
patients, there are several potentially effective treatment 
options, including a version of DBT adapted specifically 
for BPD patients with comorbid SUD (DBT–SUD), dynamic 
deconstructive psychotherapy, and schema therapy for addic-
tion (Dual Focus Schema Therapy; DFST) [42–45].

In cases of severe substance use, the treatment of the SUD 
should be prioritized over BPD, especially when psycho-
therapy is not effective or when the patient expresses a pref-
erence to receive treatment for the SUD, which may include 
hospitalization and/or pharmacological treatment. However, 
patients should be informed about the limited evidence for 
the efficacy of pharmacological treatment, as well as the 
risks and benefits of the various pharmacological alterna-
tives. Studies have shown that patients with alcohol use dis-
order (AUD) and BPD comorbidity benefit from pharma-
cotherapy to the same extent as patients with a dependence 
disorder without this comorbidity [46]. Consequently, treat-
ments for AUD, which include disulfiram, naltrexone, and 
acamprosate for relapse prevention, should always be offered 
to these patients [42, 46]. Other off-label medications, such 
as anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabaline, gabapentine, or topira-
mate) or atypical antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine or olanzap-
ine), may be considered [46]. Prescription of these drugs 
should be done cautiously, keeping in mind the need to avoid 
polypharmacy and to limit the use of sedatives.

495

medications are routinely prescribed off label for this con-
dition despite the lack of agreement among clinical guide-
lines. Comorbidity between BPD and other psychiatric 
disorders is considered to be the main factor associated 
with both pharmacological treatment and polypharmacy 
in these patients.

Our review of the evidence leads us to make the fol-
lowing  conclusions  and  clinical  recommendations  for 
the management of patients with BPD and a comorbid 
disorder: (1) psychotherapy should be the first-line treat-
ment for all individuals with BPD, regardless of whether 
a comorbidity is present or not; (2) while some drugs can 
be helpful, their main role is as an adjunct to BPD-specific 
psychotherapy; (3) off-label drug prescription and polyp-
harmacy is common in BPD despite the lack of robust evi-
dence; (4) patients who receive BPD-specific psychother-
apy usually require fewer medications, which can help to 
reduce polypharmacy; (5) BPD-specific treatment should 
be prioritized over the treatment of comorbidities, except 
for severe episodes of MDD, severe substance use, or life-
threatening AN; (6) pharmacotherapy may be useful in 
severe cases, or when psychotherapy is ineffective, but it is 
important to avoid polypharmacy and sedatives. Likewise, 
the patient should be informed about the possible adverse 
side effects of these drugs and about alternative medica-
tions. Doing so allows the patient to take an active role in 
decision-making, which is important given the uncertainty 
surrounding the optimal treatment approach (2).

Finally, we need the identification of new pharmaco-
logical targets in the treatment of BPD and new drug can-
didates to treat BPD and comorbidities with potential ben-
eficial effects, such as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy 
approaches [47,  48]. New clinical trials and naturalistic 
studies are needed to clarify the role of pharmacother-
apy in the treatment of BPD, particularly in patients with 
comorbid conditions. Despite the relatively weak evidence 
base, we believe that clinicians will find the recommenda-
tions and algorithms proposed here for the pharmacologi-
cal treatment of individuals with BPD and comorbidities to 
be of value for the clinical management of these patients.

6   Conclusions

Declarations 

Comorbidity with other mental disorders is common in 
individuals with BPD. The prevalence of these comorbid 
disorders tends to decrease gradually over time in parallel 
with the clinical improvement of the typical symptoms 
that characterize BPD. No drugs have yet been approved 
specifically for the treatment of BPD. Nonetheless, various
