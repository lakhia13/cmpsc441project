Abstract

Objective:  As the population of older adults in the United States continues to rise, understanding 
modifiable risk factors that contribute to cognitive decline and dementia becomes increasingly 
important. This narrative review summarizes existing literature on the association between thyroid 
function in the euthyroid range, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and cognitive outcomes in 
older adults.

Methods:  A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Ovid/Medline databases was 
conducted. Randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational 
studies published in English between January 2000 and December 2023 were included.

Results:  Overall, existing studies yielded conflicting results, failing to delineate a concrete 
relationship between thyroid function and cognitive outcomes and/or dementia in older adults. 
There may be a possible association between higher thyroid stimulating hormone in the reference 
range and lower risk of incident dementia, which may be more pronounced in women. Majority 
of studies elucidated a possible association between low thyroid stimulating hormone and 
incident dementia, with suggestion that duration of hyperthyroidism may contribute to increasing 
dementia risk. Even though evidence on the association of hypothyroidism and cognitive decline 
are disparate, current data do not support treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism to improve 
cognitive outcomes in older adults.

Conclusion:  Despite numerous studies, there is no conclusive evidence that supports a direct 
relationship between hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and cognitive decline. Study limitations 
include heterogeneity in study designs, measurement methodologies, and cognitive assessment 
tools. Future research is needed to better delineate whether an association exists and whether 
treatment of thyroid dysfunction ameliorates cognitive impairment.

Introduction

The United States (U.S.) population aged 65 years and older continues to grow at an 
unprecedented rate, and is projected to nearly double over the next 3 decades, reaching 
almost 95 million.1 Decline in cognitive function is highly correlated with ageing. Nearly 
1 in 5 older adults will develop pathologic cognitive changes, including mild cognitive 
impairment and dementia.2,3 Deteriorating cognitive functioning and dementia also play 
a significant role in the development of functional impairment and disability in this 
population.4 In addition, thyroid function abnormalities are common and affect more 
than 12% of the U.S. population in their lifetime, with subclinical thyroid dysfunction 
particularly prominent among older adults.

Thyroid dysfunction, which includes overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism and 
hypothyroidism, has been recognized as a potentially reversible contributor to cognitive 
decline via several possible mechanisms, and could constitute a modifiable risk factor (Fig. 
1).5,6 Proposed mechanisms of cognitive changes associated with hyperthyroidism include 
accelerated neuronal metabolism and inflammation, neuronal injury and apoptosis, increased 
oxidative stress, and alterations in gene expression.6,7 Neurocognitive manifestations of 
hyperthyroidism include anxiety, emotional liability, impaired concentration, and apathy 
in older adults.7 Hypothyroidism may lead to cognitive changes by a reduction in 
cerebral blood flow and cerebral glucose metabolism, increased risk of stroke due to 
increased atherogenic lipids and hypertension and/or hypercoagulable state, and altered gene 
expression.7 Clinical manifestations may include slowed mentation, short-term memory 
loss, and depressed mood.7 Due to these clinical manifestations, the American Neurologic 
Association recommends checking serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as routine 
workup for adults presenting for evaluation of dementia.8

Despite several studies focusing on the relationship between thyroid dysfunction and 
cognitive impairment and/or risk of dementia, findings have been inconsistent and 
sometimes conflicting. This narrative review aims to summarize evidence from the current 
literature on thyroid function in the euthyroid range, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, 
and their association with cognitive function and dementia.

The PubMed and Ovid/Medline databases were searched from January 2000 until 
December 2023 to gather articles published in English pertaining to thyroid and cognition 
for inclusion in this narrative review. The following search terms were included: 
“thyroid,” “hypothyroidism,” “subclinical hypothyroidism,” “hyperthyroidism,” “subclinical 
hyperthyroidism,” “thyroid dysfunction,” “cognition,” “memory,” “dementia,” “brain,” 
“cognitive function,” and “cognitive decline.” The search was restricted to articles on 
adults aged 18 years and older. Even though the focus of our review is on the older

adult population, in order to be more comprehensive, we also included studies focusing 
on the general population inclusive of older adults that addressed patient age as a 
variable. In addition, studies of higher clinical interest were also prioritized. We included 
randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and observational 
studies. References of selected articles were also reviewed to identify additional pertinent 
studies for inclusion. Case series and case reports were excluded.

Results

Thyroid Function in the Euthyroid Range and Risk of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia

The appropriate reference range for thyroid function in older adults has been a topic of 
debate. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III study suggest 
that both the median TSH as well as the “normal” TSH distribution shift towards higher 
values with increasing age, and may confer a survival benefit in older adults.9,10 The 
possible association of a higher TSH level with longevity may be due to a correlated lower 
bioactivity of thyroid hormone or decreased responsiveness of the thyroid gland to TSH, 
which subsequently leads to a lower basal metabolic rate and may be an adaptive mechanism 
to prevent catabolism in older adults. In order to further evaluate optimal thresholds for 
thyroid hormone treatment in older adults, several studies have examined the relationship 
between thyroid function within the euthyroid range and adverse outcomes in older adults, 
including cognitive impairment and dementia.11-13

In evaluating the association between thyroid function and incident dementia as an outcome, 
a study of 2843 U S. community-dwelling adults 65 years or older enrolled in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study, no association was found between any of the thyroid function 
tests (TSH, free thyroxine (T4), total triiodothyronine) and dementia after adjusting for 
a comprehensive set of confounders.11 However, when examining differences in incident 
dementia rates across quartiles within the reference ranges, individuals with TSH in the 
highest quartile had significantly lower absolute rates of dementia compared with the lowest 
quartile. Dementia status in this study was ascertained by a committee of neurologists, 
psychiatrists and neuropsychologists using data collected at study visits. Similarly, in the 
Rotterdam Study, which is a prospective population-based cohort of 9446 participants with a 
mean age of 65 years, there was a significant association between higher TSH in the normal 
range and lower risk of dementia, independent of cardiovascular risk factors.13 Specifically, 
participants with TSH levels in the upper limit of the reference range (4.0 mIU/L) were half 
as likely to develop dementia than those in the lower limit of the refence range (0.4 mIU/L).

In another landmark study, 1864 cognitively intact and clinically euthyroid participants 
in the Framingham study underwent dementia evaluation via the Mini-Mental State 
Examination (MMSE) biannually over a mean follow-up period of 12.7 years.12 Over 
this period, 209 participants developed Alzheimer’s disease, of which 142 were women. 
Women with serum TSH in the lowest (<1.0 mIU/L) and highest (>2.1 mIU/L) tertiles 
were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a U-shaped 
relationship between TSH level and Alzheimer’s disease risk. Interestingly, this relationship 
was not elucidated in men. Data analyzed from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study 
similarly did not demonstrate associations between TSH or free T4 levels and measures

of cognition in 539 euthyroid U.S. men aged 65 years and older after a mean follow-up 
of 6 years.14 Additional cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between thyroid 
function in the euthyroid range and cognitive impairment in older adults have yielded 
conflicting findings.15-17 In summary, existing studies demonstrate a possible association 
between higher TSH in the reference range and lower risk of incident dementia, which may 
be more pronounced in women.

Overt Hyperthyroidism and Risk of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia

The prevalence of overt hyperthyroidism in older adults is estimated to be 1% to 3%, 
although most of this is due to exogenous thyroid hormone. The prevalence of overt 
hyperthyroidism decreases to 0.4% when individuals on thyroid hormone preparations 
are excluded.18 While Graves’ disease is the most common etiology in the older adult 
population, the prevalence of toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenomas increases with 
age.19 Even though the association between overt hyperthyroidism and cardiovascular 
outcomes, such as atrial fibrillation, and skeletal outcomes, such as osteoporosis, 
has been well-described, the relationship between overt hyperthyroidism and cognitive 
outcomes remains uncertain. Several observational studies to date attempted to elucidate 
the association between overt hyperthyroidism and risk of cognitive impairment and 
dementia.12,20-25

Folkstead et al sought to investigate the risk of dementia in overtly hyperthyroid individuals 
using 2 population-based registry cohorts and matched reference populations, namely the 
Danish National Patient Registry (55 656 hyperthyroid individuals matched to 222 624 
controls) and the OPENTHYRO registry (2689 hyperthyroid individuals matched to 10 756 
controls).20 The primary outcome was all-cause dementia. In the Danish National Patient 
Registry cohort, the incidence of all-cause dementia was significantly higher in individuals 
with hyperthyroidism (4.9% compared to 3.6%). There was no significant difference in rates 
of dementia based on cause of hyperthyroidism, ie Graves’ disease and toxic nodular goiter. 
In the OPENTHYRO registry cohort, 7.1% of hyperthyroid individuals and 4.4% of those 
from the reference population developed dementia during follow up; however, this was not 
statistically significant. When combining data from both cohorts, each 6-month period of 
decreased TSH was associated with an increased relative risk of all-cause dementia by 16%, 
compared with euthyroid individuals, suggesting that individuals with longer duration of 
hyperthyroidism are at greatest risk of developing dementia over time.20

In evaluating cognitive decline as an outcome measured with MMSE or patient 
report, several cross-sectional studies failed to show an association between endogenous 
hyperthyroidism and cognitive decline. A cross-sectional clinic-based study of 154 patients 
with Graves’ disease found no difference in MMSE scores between patients who 
were hyperthyroid compared to those who had reached the euthyroid state following 
thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine or thionamide therapy.21 Shorter disease duration was 
associated with significantly better recall, attention, and calculation.21 In concordance with 
these findings, a smaller case-control study showed that patients in the hyperthyroid phase 
of Graves’ disease reported more cognitive deficits compared to controls, including memory

and concentration problems, but cognitive impairment was not objectively demonstrated by 
comprehensive neuropsychological testing.22

In addition, other studies incorporated patients with both endogenous and exogenous 
hyperthyroidism when evaluating cognitive outcomes. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Neurocognitive Study, 12 481 participants were followed for approximately 
22 years from middle to older adulthood. While most individuals were euthyroid, 3.4% had 
overt hyperthyroidism, most commonly exogenous. Patients with overt hyperthyroidism had 
a 40% increased risk of dementia compared to euthyroid controls overall, but categorical 
TSH levels were not associated with cognitive changes.23 A meta-analysis of 11 studies 
found that higher free T4 or TSH below the normal range were significantly associated with 
increased risk of dementia when adjusting for thyroid medication use.24

More recently, a single institution study of 65 931 patients aged 65 years and older 
leveraged electronic health records to determine whether endogenous and exogenous 
hyperthyroidism were associated with increased risk of cognitive disorders, including mild 
cognitive impairment and all-cause dementia, by conducting a longitudinal time-varying 
analysis.25 Hyperthyroidism was stratified by either low TSH (≥0.1 mIU/L to lower normal 
reference range, or 0.45 mIU/L if laboratory values were missing) or severely low TSH 
(<0.1 mIU/L). Free T4 measurements were not included in the study. The majority of 
low TSH measurements were exogenous (60%), followed by unknown cause (24%) and 
endogenous (17%). Overall, cumulative incidence of cognitive disorder was higher amongst 
patients who were exposed to hyperthyroidism compared to nonexposed (11.0% versus 6.4% 
at age 75 years, and 34% versus 25% at age 85 years). All-cause hyperthyroidism was 
significantly associated with incident cognitive disorder across age groups after adjustment 
for potential confounders. When stratified by cause, exogenous hyperthyroidism remained 
a significant risk factor for incident cognitive disorder, with more severe hyperthyroidism 
having a stronger association.25 By including data on exogenous hyperthyroidism, which is 
the most common cause of hyperthyroidism seen in clinical settings, this study highlights 
potential harm from excess thyroid hormone in older adults and underscores the need to 
reduce overtreatment.

Subclinical Hyperthyroidism and Risk of Cognitive Impairment and Dementia

Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism affects 3% to 8% of older adults.26 In patients 
taking thyroid hormone, exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism has been reported in more 
than 40% of cases.18,27 Existing studies examining the association between subclinical 
hyperthyroidism and risk of cognitive impairment or dementia in older adults have yielded 
discordant results.28-31 In a meta-analysis of 5 prospective cohorts comprising 6410 
participants with subclinical hyperthyroidism followed for a mean of 5.7 years, there 
was a higher relative risk of dementia compared to euthyroidism. Interestingly, a decline 
in MMSE was similar among subclinical hyperthyroid and euthyroid participants.32 The 
authors offered several plausible explanations regarding these discrepant findings, including 
the fact that the follow-up length of studies ascertaining dementia as an outcome was twice 
that of studies examining MMSE as an outcome, heterogeneity of study populations among 
studies included in the meta-analysis, the modest sensitivity of MMSE as a diagnostic tool

and for detecting subtle changes in specific cognitive domains, and the multimodal approach 
in diagnosing dementia. In a prospective cohort study of 2558 adults aged 70-79 years with 
measured thyroid function and no dementia at baseline from the Health, Aging and Body 
Composition (Health ABC) Study, subclinical hyperthyroidism with a TSH <0.1 mIU/L was 
associated with a higher risk of incident-adjudicated dementia and a larger cognitive decline 
as measured by the Modified Mini-Mental State.33

In contrast, in a multicohort individual participant data analysis of 74 565 adults with 
a median age at baseline ranging between 57 and 93 years, subclinical hyperthyroidism 
was not associated with cognitive function, cognitive decline or incident dementia.34 A 
cross-sectional study of patients aged 65 years and older receiving care in primary care 
practices in central England, similarly, did not show an association between subclinical 
hyperthyroidism and dementia after adjusting for medication use and comorbid conditions; 
however, sample size was small and the rates of subclinical hyperthyroidism low.

Overt Hypothyroidism and Cognitive Impairment/Dementia

Prevalence of overt, untreated hypothyroidism using National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey III data from the general U.S. population is estimated to be 0.33% (N = 
17 535).35 Of the 820 participants who self-reported a diagnosis of thyroid disease or use of 
thyroid medications, 2.2% had biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism.36 Data from 
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study which included participants aged 65 years 
and older, showed that the prevalence of overt untreated hypothyroidism in older adults was 
0.82%, while treated hypothyroidism was reported to be 16.9%.37 The association between 
hypothyroidism and cognitive impairment has been investigated in several studies. Some 
studies suggest that older adults are most vulnerable to cognitive effects, with memory being 
the most consistently affected cognitive domain.38-40

Findings from both the Danish National Patient Registry and OPENTHYRO cohorts 
demonstrated that the risk of incident dementia was significantly increased in those 
individuals with hypothyroidism.41 Specifically, in the Danish National Patient Registry 
cohort (N = 111 565 hypothyroid individuals, N = 446 260 euthyroid age- and sex-matched 
controls) the overall risk of dementia was significantly increased in hypothyroid individuals 
compared to the reference population (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17-1.27). However, when 
adjusted for pre-existing comorbidity, the association of hypothyroidism and dementia was 
attenuated (median follow-up 6.2 years; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.79-0.86). Interestingly, when 
stratified by age (≤56 years versus >56 years), age was inversely associated with risk of 
dementia.41 The study authors concluded that this relative risk increase is likely due to the 
low probability of developing dementia at a younger age. Results from the OPENTHYRO 
cohort (N = 233 844) showed that the risk of dementia was significantly increased by 12% 
for each 6 months of elevated TSH (median follow-up 7.2 years), suggesting that the length 
of hypothyroidism may influence risk of dementia.41

In another population-based study, the study on Aging and Dementia in Mexico (N = 1750), 
the authors found that overt hypothyroidism, defined as TSH >4.8 IU/L and FT4 <13 
pmol/L, was significantly associated with mild cognitive impairment as evaluated by the 
MMSE.42

Moreover, a meta-analysis of 8 studies involving more than 1 million individuals 
showed that overt hypothyroidism was not associated with an increased risk of cognitive 
dysfunction, including both all-cause dementia and cognitive impairment (OR 1.13, 95% 
CI 0.84-1.51). However, the risk of cognitive dysfunction was significantly increased when 
not adjusted for vascular comorbidity.43 Similarly, a cross-sectional, population-based study 
which included 1904 randomly selected individuals aged 70–89 years without documented 
prevalent dementia, found no significant association between overt hypothyroidism and mild 
cognitive impairment after adjusting for relevant covariates.44 While the evidence is mixed, 
it would be clinically prudent for clinicians to avoid overtreatment and undertreatment of 
overt hypothyroidism.

Subclinical Hypothyroidism and Cognitive Impairment/Dementia

The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is higher than overt hypothyroidism, 
with estimates between 3.8% and 20%, and prevalence increasing with age.37 Studies 
to date yielded inconsistent findings in regard to the association between subclinical 
hypothyroidism and cognitive dysfunction and/or dementia.

One of the largest studies assessing cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of baseline 
thyroid dysfunction and cognitive function is a multicohort individual participant data 
analysis of 23 cohorts encompassing 74 565 individuals with a median age 57–93 years, 
of which 4167 (5.6%) had subclinical hypothyroidism.34 Subclinical hypothyroidism was 
not associated with global cognitive function, which was primarily assessed via the MMSE. 
In addition, no consistent associations were seen between subclinical hypothyroidism 
and executive function, memory, or dementia risk.34 This study delivers the most robust 
observational evidence to date suggesting that subclinical hypothyroidism is not associated 
with cognitive function or decline.

Interestingly, a meta-analysis of 13 studies evaluated cognitive function as the primary 
outcome, assessed as composite endpoint of incidence or prevalence of dementia or 
difference in MMSE, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Wechsler Memory Scale-
Revised scores, in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. This meta-analysis showed a 
significantly increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in individuals younger 
than 75 years, but no significant effect was found when considering all included participants. 
The increased risk of cognitive dysfunction observed in the younger population was 
positively associated with the degree of TSH elevation. Cognitive function was assessed as a 
composite endpoint derived either by incidence or prevalence of dementia, reduced MMSE, 
Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, total memory quotient, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scaler scores. Serum TSH ranged between 5.5 and 12.0 mIU/L These findings should be 
interpreted with caution, as it was not confirmed when using the mean difference of MMSE 
scores as endpoint in a secondary analysis.45

Additional smaller population-based and cross-sectional studies failed to show an 
association between subclinical hypothyroidism and cognitive function determined by 
MMSE.44,46,47

Finally, a few intervention studies examined the effects of levothyroxine treatment in 
patients with subclinical hypothyroidism on cognitive outcomes.40,48-52 The majority of 
these studies did not find any concrete evidence that levothyroxine treatment confers a 
cognitive function benefit. The largest of these studies, the TRUST trial, included 737 
adults aged 65 years and older with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism and found no 
benefit with levothyroxine in regard to executive cognitive function as measured by the 
letter-digit coding test.48 In a smaller placebo-controlled double-blind trial, 69 individuals 
with subclinical hypothyroidism underwent detailed cognitive testing of multiple domains 
at baseline and after treatment with placebo or levothyroxine for 1 year.50 There was no 
effect of levothyroxine treatment on any of the cognitive measures. Similarly, a double-
blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom examined 
whether thyroid hormone replacement to achieve biochemical euthyroidism, compared to 
placebo, improved cognitive function in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (N 
= 94, age ≥65 years). There were no significant changes seen in any of the cognitive 
function measures and no between-group differences in cognitive scores at either 6 or 12 
months.51 Providing the first functional imaging evidence of a possible specific deficit in 
working memory/executive function in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, Zhu et al53 
observed normalization of frontoparietal brain area abnormalities corresponding to these 
cognitive domains on functional MRI following a 6-month treatment with levothyroxine 
in subclinical hypothyroid patients, similar to euthyroid counterparts. Taken together, these 
data do not support initiating thyroid hormone treatment in older adults with subclinical 
hypothyroidism to improve cognitive outcomes.

Existing Study Limitations

Despite numerous studies attempting to elucidate the association between thyroid 
dysfunction and cognitive outcomes in the past several years, rigorous conclusions cannot 
be drawn, partly owning to existing study limitations, and several knowledge gaps remain 
(Table 1). Studies to date demonstrated significant heterogeneity in study design, with 
the majority of existing studies being observational and cross-sectional, with different 
inclusion criteria and variable adjustment for relevant confounders, such as mood alterations. 
In addition, there was variability across studies in the definitions used for thyroid 
dysfunction, some lacking consistent measurements of free thyroid hormones. Furthermore, 
the determination of a dementia diagnosis was not consistent among studies, and not 
always adjudicated. Finally, there was significant heterogeneity in cognitive function test 
assessments, with some tests not being sensitive enough to detect subtle deficits or target the 
cognitive domains that may likely be affected by thyroid function fluctuations. Specifically, 
reliance of many existing studies on the MMSE as a cognitive screening instrument 
may have yielded high misclassification rates. There are concerns that MMSE has poor 
sensitivity for detecting subtle cognitive deficits and has a ceiling effect, particularly in those 
who are highly educated.54 Comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations can provide 
more detailed assessments of multiple cognitive domains in the older adult population. 
Large prospective studies using repeated measures of thyroid function and comprehensive 
neuropsychological assessments, as well as double-blind placebo-controlled randomized 
trials with detailed cognitive assessments and adjudicated definition of incident dementia

and functional imaging are sorely needed to further elucidate the association between 
thyroid function and cognitive decline in older adults (Table 1).

Conclusion

As the geriatric population continues to grow and cognitive impairment/dementia remains 
one of the leading causes of morbidity in this age group, identifying modifiable risk 
factors including possibly thyroid dysfunction has garnered significant interest in recent 
years. However, despite several studies attempting to elucidate the relationship between 
thyroid dysfunction and cognition, as well as whether thyroid dysfunction is a modifiable 
risk factor of cognitive decline, conflicting evidence remains. Taken together, there is 
currently insufficient information to guide clinical recommendations. Future research should 
focus on whether different thyroid function fluctuations affect distinct cognitive domains, 
and whether treatment of thyroid dysfunction, including subclinical, confers a benefit in 
reducing the risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia.

Highlights

•

•

•

Observational studies have yielded conflicting findings regarding the 
association between thyroid dysfunction and cognition.

Randomized controlled trials to date examining the effect of levothyroxine 
treatment in subclinical hypothyroidism have shown no benefit on cognitive 
outcomes.

Despite several existing studies, there are currently insufficient data to support 
a direct relationship between thyroid dysfunction and cognition to guide 
clinical recommendations.

Clinical Relevance

As the population of older adults in the United States is increasing, understanding 
whether thyroid dysfunction is a modifiable risk factor contributing to cognitive decline 
and dementia is of vital importance.
