Abstract

Background: The association between international migration and mental health is conditioned to several factors,
and discrimination may play a significant role. Currently, Peru is one of the principal Venezuelan migrant-receiving
countries in Latin America. There are around one million Venezuelan refugees and migrants in the country. This
study evaluates the association between self-perceived discrimination and mental health problems in Venezuelan
population living in Peru.
Method: We analyzed data from the Venezuelan Population Residing in Peru Survey 2018, a nationally representative
urban sample aimed at collecting information on several dimensions of Venezuelan population wellbeing. We applied
logistic regression models to assess the association between self-perceived discrimination and mental health problems.
Moreover, we applied the propensity score matching method as a robustness check of our results.

Results: Of 9487 Venezuelans surveyed, 6806 included complete information. From this sample, 6.3% reported mental
health problems related to fear, anger, anxiety, or stress. Logistic regression models showed that Venezuelans who
perceived being discriminated against had 2.4 higher odds of presenting mental health problems than their non-
discriminated counterparts. Moreover, propensity score matching models showed that Venezuelans who perceived
being discriminated against increased by 3.5 percentage points their probability of presenting mental health problems
compared to their non-discriminated counterparts.

Conclusions: There is evidence that self-perceived discrimination is associated with mental health deterioration in
Venezuelan migrants living in Peru. Our findings are relevant in the current geopolitical context and could be useful in
the decision making processes in international health.

Background
International migration is a complex phenomenon that
involves a multiplicity of economic, social and security
contents given an increasingly interconnected world.
The lives of international migrants are challenging and
several social factors can affect their wellbeing during
transit and settlement [1, 2]. Many migrants labor in
informal jobs associated with human rights violations,
undignified wages, and exploitation; and many live in
low quality and overcrowded households [2, 3]. They
have limited healthcare access, and many of them fear
using the healthcare system when required [1]. They also
experience multiple types of discrimination when trying
to integrate into the host society [4, 5]. Consequently,
the study of discrimination as a factor that affects the
health of international migrants is a highly important
matter.

Since the 2000s, international migration flows in Latin
America have shown changes in direction and intensity.
Currently, the “Venezuelan phenomenon” has brought
essential repercussions in the region. The Venezuelan
migration process is based on three phases, shifting from
a migrant-receiving to a migrant-sending country [6].
The first phase began in 2000 after Hugo Chávez won
the presidential election and implemented the “Socialism
the Twenty-First Century”. Venezuelans from the
of
upper classes emigrated to developed countries, given
their disagreements with Chavez’s radical reforms. The
the Latin
second phase corresponds to the end of
American commodity growth. Venezuelan economy
entered a great recession and migrant profile shifting,
people from lower classes migrated to geographically
proximate countries, such as Colombia. Finally, the third
phase of migration began in 2015, after the election of
Nicolas Maduro as president. The collapse of the Venezuelan
economic leads to a severe humanitarian crisis, including a
lack of food security and a broken public health system [6].
The current phase has to Peru as one of the principal
migrant-receiving, with around one million Venezuelan
migrants [7], significantly higher than internal migra-
tion flows [8]. Consequently, the Venezuelan migratory
phenomenon is a unique and novel that deserves special
attention and research.

The association between international migration and
mental health is conditioned to several factors, and self-
perceived discrimination may play a significant role.
International migration has been discussed as a potential
risk factor for mental health illness [9, 10]. Besides
psychiatric illness, psychosocial factors may play a role
in immigrants’ subjective wellbeing [9, 10]. Indeed, the
literature suggests some plausible mechanisms to explain
why there might be a higher prevalence of mental health
illness in some vulnerable migrant groups [11–13]. Con-
flict and migration-related experiences, socioeconomic

disadvantage, social marginalization, and a sense of
sacrifice and sadness are critical elements for explaining
this health disadvantage [12–15]. Evidence suggests that
self-perceived discrimination among migrants pro-
foundly affects their physical and psychological wellbeing
in European and Asian countries [16–21]. In general,
the relationship between the risk of mental illness and
international migration continues to be complicated and
difficult to disentangle. However, for Latin America, dis-
crimination seems to be one of the main factors that
could explain this problem.

Considering the above, this study aims to evaluate the
association between self-perceived discrimination and
mental health problems in the Venezuelan population
living in Peru. The findings may help policymakers in a
context where flows of Venezuelan migration may grow
in coming years, as a complex humanitarian crisis is
taking place in the region due to the largest Venezuelan
exodus in history.

Methods
Design and data sources
We carried out a secondary cross-sectional analysis
based on data from the 2018 Venezuelan Population
Residing in Peru Survey (ENPOVE-2018), designed by
the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics of
Peru. The ENPOVE-2018 included a nationally representa-
tive urban sample of six Peruvian regions (Tumbes, La
Libertad, Arequipa, Cusco, Lima, and Callao), which were
selected since they reported the highest flows of Venezue-
lan migration. Likewise, the survey collected information
on several dimensions of the Venezuelan population’s
wellbeing, such as demographics, socioeconomic status,
immigration status, discrimination, and violence character-
istics. Data were collected from 26 November 2018 to 31
December 2018 through structured questionnaires applied
by trained interviewers at home with every household
member. The response rate was 99.6%.

Population, sampling, and sample
The ENPOVE-2018 survey involved 3611 households
and 9487 Venezuelans residing in Peru. This survey used
a probabilistic, stratified, and region-independent sam-
pling, where sampling units were blocks and households
with Venezuelan residents. Our study included only the
working-age population (aged 14+ years) with health
indicators available, including mental health characteris-
tics. We also excluded the population with missing
labor-income values.

Variables and measures
The outcome variable was the presence of mental health
problems defined by the survey as adverse emotional
and psychological reactions such as fear, anger, anxiety,

Mougenot et al. Globalization and Health            (2021) 17:8

or stress. This self-reported variable was built through a
question with a binary answer (yes/no): “Since your
arrival in Peru: Did you present with any problem asso-
ciated with fearing, anger, anxiety, stress or similar?”

The main exposure was the self-perception of discrim-
ination for being a Venezuelan immigrant. This self-
reported variable was collected through a question with
binary answer (yes/no): “Have you been discriminated
against for Venezuelan immigrant status since your
arrival in Peru?”

Moreover, we included the following control variables:
sex (binary: male/female), age groups (ordinal in tertiles),
marital status (binary: married or living together/other),
minimum wage (binary: yes/no), education level (ordinal:
no education/primary/secondary/tertiary), time spent in
the country since arrival (ordinal: 6 months/6–12 months/+
12 months in Peru), socioeconomic status constructed by
INEI (ordinal:
lower/middle/higher), and perceived social
support (binary: yes/no).

Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in Stata 15.0® (StataCorp,
College Station, Texas, US) considered sampling weights
[22]. We describe numeric variables using mean + stand-
ard deviation and categorical variables using relative/ab-
solute frequencies. We tested a preliminary association
between self-perceived discrimination and mental health
problems by Pearson’s Chi-Squared test. The same
procedure was done to show the association between
control and outcome variables.

To assess the association between self-perceived dis-
crimination and mental health problems, we estimated
prevalence odds ratios with their 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI) using logistic regression models at crude (cOR)
and adjusted (aOR) by statistical (p-value under 0.2 in
bivariate analysis) and epidemiological criteria (accord-
ing to the classic confounding definition) [23]. In ad-
justed models, the minimum wage was not included
due to collinearity with socioeconomic status. More-
over, we estimated marginal effects to measure changes
in the likelihood of mental health problems given self-
perceived discrimination. We considered statistically
significant coefficients for a p < 0.05.

Finally, we performed a propensity score matching (PSM)
[24, 25] approach as a robustness check. PSM approach is a
useful technique to minimize selection bias arising from
observable variables. In our analysis, the PSM allowed us to
compare discriminated and non-discriminated Venezuelan
immigrants with similar characteristics. We used different
matching algorithms [24, 26], namely nearest neighbor
matching, five nearest neighbor matching, radius matching,
and kernel matching. Several studies suggest using kernel
matching as the main statistic estimator and the rest as a
sensitivity analysis [27, 28].

Results
Sample characteristics
Of 9487 Venezuelans surveyed, 7939 were working-age
population, and full information was available for 6806
of them, represented 85.7% of the working-age sample
(Descriptive characteristics of the non-included sample
are in A1 Table). From the final sample, 39% have
perceived discrimination due to their migration status,
and 6.3% reported at least one mental health problem
related to fear, anger, anxiety or stress. The mean age
was 30.8 ± 0.2, 58% were male, 57% were married or
living with their partner, and around 85% completed at
least a secondary educational level. The mean monthly
salary-income was 1116 ± 14.4 soles (approximately
US$329), 33% earn less than minimum wage, around
30% had spent at least one year in Peru, only 1.4% had
received social support from any institution in the
country; and 11.9, 55.3 and 32.7% were qualified in the
lower, middle and higher socioeconomic status, re-
spectively (Table 1).

Differences by mental health problems
We found a significant association between mental
health problems
and self-perceived discrimination.
Venezuelans who perceived being discriminated against
showed a higher prevalence of mental health problems
than their non-discriminated counterparts (p < 0.001).
Moreover, we found a significant association between
mental health problems and sex; female Venezuelans re-
ported a higher prevalence of mental health problems
than male counterparts (p < 0.001) (Table 2).

Association between perceived discrimination and mental
health
In the unadjusted logistic regression model, Venezuelans
who perceived being discriminated against had higher
odds of reporting mental health problems than those
who did not perceive discrimination (cOR:2.50, 95%CI:
1.77–3.53). This result was similar in statistical (aOR:
2.35, 95%CI:1.67–3.30) and epidemiological (aOR:2.39,
95%CI:1.69–3.37) adjusted models
(Table 3). Other
variables associated with mental health problems were
sex and socioeconomic status. Findings from crude
prevalence odds ratios are in A2 Table.

The marginal effects showed that Venezuelans who
perceived being discriminated against had a 5% higher
probability of presenting a mental health problem com-
pared to those who did not perceive discrimination
(p < 0.001) (Table 3).

Effect of perceived discrimination on mental health,

tion bias due to measured confounders from 5 to 1% in

multidisciplinary studies should analyze all phases of the
process: before, during and after transit [1, 14, 29, 30].
There is a growing interest in developing research focused
on post-migration stressors’ psychological effects in the
settlement environment, where discrimination has a
fundamental role [4, 10, 12]. Venezuelans face multiple
challenges in living and surviving out of their country.
Therefore, forced migration has significantly increased in
the last two years [31, 32]. That has led to significant
consequences on both Venezuela and Latin American
countries, including the impacts on health [31, 33]. The
current crisis in Venezuela and the subsequent migration
is unprecedented in the region and Peru is a country that
has received a significant proportion of Venezuelan
migrants [7]. We found a higher prevalence and a higher
probability of presenting mental health problems in
Venezuelans with self-perceived discrimination compared
to Venezuelans without this perception. Our study consti-
tutes one of the first analysis of this association in Latin
America and are relevant to the current geopolitical dis-
cussion. They could also be useful in international health
policy decision-making processes related to international
migration and population health issues.

Our findings are consistent with the literature regard-
ing perceived discrimination, as previous studies found
that it is associated with mental health alterations in mi-
grant population. A meta-analytic review concluded that
perceived discrimination’s pervasiveness has detrimental
effects on psychological wellbeing [34]. A study of seven
European countries reveal that the migrant population
had a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and that
discrimination was associated with this outcome [17]. In
Norway, a study found that perceived discrimination was
not associated with general health; however, it was asso-
ciated with higher odds of mental health problems, even
after controlling for socio-demographic and psychosocial
variables [35]. In England, a study reported that discrimin-
ation experiences were associated with common mental
disorders; however, magnitudes varied by migration status
and race/ethnicity [18]. A Dominican Republic study
suggested that perceived discrimination and humiliation
contributed to Haitian migrant mental ill-health [19]. In
Brazil, discrimination was associated with posttrau-
matic stress disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms

in Haitian immigrants [16]. In summary, international
evidence suggests that discrimination, as a social stressor,
leads to mental health problems in migrant population.
This association must be understood in a complex multi-
factorial context, even more in Latin-America [1, 9, 12].

The association between perceived discrimination and
mental health problems could be influenced by different
mechanisms,
including social, psychological, and bio-
logical dimensions. First, discrimination has been identi-
fied as a post-migration stressor that negatively affects
social integration and poor social integration contributes
to a higher rate of inequality in mental health disorders
[36, 37]. Secondly, acculturation stress increases mental
health problems in immigrants and discrimination is an
essential contributor to this problem [3, 38, 39]. Again,
self-esteem has been recognized as an essential mediator
over the effect of perceived discrimination on depression,
anxiety and psychological wellbeing in migrants [5, 40].
Moreover, perceived discrimination has a direct effect on
physical and mental health. Additionally, it indirectly affects
stress response levels and health behaviors, conditioned by
social support, stigma, and coping style [41]. Moreover,
discrimination induced cortisol dysregulation, especially in
immigrants and other racial/ethnic minorities [42, 43]. This
psychobiological stress interacts with dopamine, serotonin
and other neurotransmitters produce anxious and depres-
sive symptoms [44]. Therefore, discrimination can lead to
mental health problems via an intricate network of interre-
lated mechanisms.

Implications of our findings to policy and practice
The “Venezuelan phenomenon” is complex and challen-
ging. The humanitarian crisis has naturally caused a
massive migratory exodus, with varying degrees of recep-
tiveness to immigrants in different countries of the region
[32]. According to international evidence available, inter-
national migration directly impacts health outcomes in a
population and, in turn, on public health policy decisions
in each locality [3]. This process has essential repercus-
sions in Venezuela and neighboring receiving countries,
affecting several areas: health, education, labor and others
[31–33]. Discrimination has been recognized as a problem
that the migrant population in different latitudes must
deal with [4, 45]. Furthermore, deterioration in mental

Mougenot et al. Globalization and Health            (2021) 17:8 

Page 7 of 9

health is a severe issue among migrant populations
[11–13]. Hence, discrimination and mental health are
essential trace markers of the humanitarian crisis and
constitute indicators of a complex interaction between
strategies implemented by receiving countries, the reac-
tion of the host society and the immigrants’ response.

Approximately one million Venezuelan migrants live
in Peru, 88.8% are formal residents or regularization pro-
cesses for resident status. Most of them constitute an es-
sential flow of human resources (with a high proportion
of them with a higher education level) that have been
reinserted into the Peruvian labor force (mainly at tech-
nical and manual activities) [7]. Among migrant popula-
tions, integration strategies could improve their mental
health while increasing the acceptability of diversity,
reducing discrimination towards immigrants,
thereby
contributing to better mental health [35, 46]. Community-
level interventions providing immigrants opportunities to
increase social networking among members of the same
country and those native-born in a host country may be
helpful resources for improving mental health among im-
migrants [21, 47]. It is plausible that one who has a better
understanding of the host culture might have inspired
opportunities to participate in social activities with host
country members, leading to an improved sense of be-
longing, which are significant predictors of better mental
health. All these considerations should be taken by health
and social authorities at the national level in countries
such as Peru, which are receiving large influxes of
migrants, especially from Venezuela.

Limitations and strengths
Our study has several limitations. First, both mental health
problems and perceived discrimination are self-reported,
so selection and recall bias may affect outcomes reporting.
Although there is controversy about measuring discrimin-
is one valid way [48].
ation experiences, self-report
Second, we included in our analysis only factors identified
in the ENPOVE-2018 survey. Other factors influence the
association between perceived discrimination and mental
health problems that we have not considered. Third, we
do not have information about Venezuelans’ mental
health problems before they arrived in Peru. Finally, with
a cross-sectional survey, we cannot establish a causal ef-
fect of discrimination on mental health problems. Despite
this, the main strengths of our study are that it is based on
an urban nationally representative survey, and, to best of
our knowledge, it is the first study that assesses the associ-
ation between perceived discrimination and mental health
problems in Venezuelan immigrants to Peru. Our findings
are valuable for policymakers, public health and global
health practitioners, as well as health professionals, given
the structural and historical challenges of the Peruvian
health system.

Conclusions
There is evidence that perceived discrimination is associ-
ated with the deterioration of mental health in Venezuelan
migrants living in Peru, a complex and under-researched
topic. Research related to this problem constitutes a highly
relevant tool for health and healthcare decision-making in
Latin American countries. Study findings support the call
for the urgent health protection of Venezuelan migrants
in Peru. This population reports high degrees of self-
perceived discrimination and is struggling to maintain
their mental health. Future research should continue
developing this topic, mainly through a more profound
understanding of mental health needs and protective
strategies for Venezuelan immigrants, using longitudinal
approaches to achieve more robust estimates and under-
standing of underlying causal mechanisms.
