Informal caregivers are critical in the care of individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and spend substantial time providing care,
which may be associated with negative caregiver outcomes such as burden and mental health issues. Although research in the
United States and Europe has generally supported these relations, there is very limited research on PD caregiving in Latin America.
The current study examined the following connections in a sample of PD caregivers from the United States (N = 105) and Mexico
(N = 148): (a) PD-related impairments (motor and nonmotor symptoms) and caregiver burden, (b) caregiver burden and caregiver
mental health, and (c) PD-related impairments and mental health through caregiver burden. Study results uncovered signiﬁcant
relations among PD-related impairments, caregiver burden, and caregiver mental health. Further, caregiver burden fully mediated
the relation between PD-related impairments and caregiver mental health at both study sites. Findings highlight a number of
important intervention targets for caregivers and families, including caregiver burden and mental health.

1. Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
condition that leads to physical disability [1] and cognitive
impairment [2] over time, both of which may limit an individ-
ual’s independent functioning. PD is the second most common
progressive neurodegenerative disease in the United States [3],
aﬀecting approximately 1% of individuals over the age of 60
[4]. Recent estimates suggest that by 2030, there will be
approximately 1.2 million individuals in the United States
living with PD [5]. Similarly, due to its aging population [6],
rates of PD are likely to increase rapidly in Latin America, with
estimates suggesting the prevalence of PD will double in Mex-
ico within 20 years [7] since rates of PD increase with age [8].

There are an estimated 129,124 individuals living with PD in
Central Latin America, 30,717 in Andean Latin America, and
131,748 in Tropical Latin America [9]. However, despite the
high prevalence and increasing rates of PD in Latin America,
very little is known about either PD patient or caregiver expe-
riences in the region and how experiences may diﬀer from
those in the United States.

PD is characterized by its classic motor symptoms, includ-
ing akinesia (loss or impaired voluntary movement), bradyki-
nesia (slowness of movement), resting tremor (shaking while
in a relaxed state), and postural instability [10]. Individuals
may present with additional motor symptoms, including gait
problems [11] as well as reduced facial expression [12]. By
the time an individual is 10 years postdiagnosis, the individual

2

will present with a number of nonmotor symptoms [13] that
can include depression, cognitive impairment, apathy, anxiety,
sleep disruption, dementia, and psychosis [14].

Given the progressive nature of the disease, impairment
increases over time, leading most individuals living with PD
to require the assistance of a caregiver. This care is often pro-
vided by an informal caregiver, an individual who does not
receive ﬁnancial compensation for caregiving and is usually
a family member [15, 16]. Informal caregivers support the
individual with PD by performing a number of physical,
social, and emotional tasks, which may include assisting with
personal care and activities of daily living (e.g., bathing, feed-
ing, and administering medications), transportation and
mobility assistance (e.g., getting in and out of bed), providing
social and emotional support, and ﬁnancially supporting the
individual [17–19]. Providing care may come at a signiﬁcant
cost to the caregiver, such as giving up a career, leisure activ-
ities, or social activities to take care of the individual with PD
[17], and negative consequences for the caregiver may
include having a lower quality of life than the general popu-
lation [20, 21]. These factors contribute to the caregiver
becoming what has been described as an “invisible patient,”
and the toll of caregiving on a caregiver’s life may diminish
the overall eﬀectiveness of the care they provide [14].

These substantial life changes may result in caregiver
burden, a multidimensional construct that has been opera-
tionalized in a number of ways. For example, Zarit et al.
[22] describe caregiver burden as encompassing the adverse
eﬀects caregiving may have on an individual’s emotional,
ﬁnancial, social, physical, and spiritual function which may
engender feelings of discomfort due to the demands, time
constraints, duties, and diﬃculties of providing care. Succes-
sive researchers have built upon this deﬁnition by adding the
internal conﬂict that caregivers may experience when they
are unable to fulﬁll their personal needs due to caregiving
[23], as well as including the reactions informal caregivers
may have to the emotional, social, physical, and ﬁnancial
diﬃculties that result from providing care [24]. Caregiver
burden is critical to examine, as it may lead to a reduced sense
of well-being and burnout [25].

One of the ﬁrst studies to examine motor symptoms
and caregiver burden was conducted by Carter et al.
[26], who found that individuals who were rated by clini-
cians to be in the later Hoehn and Yahr [27] stages of PD
had spousal caregivers with higher caregiver strain than
those in early stages. Other studies generally support the
relationship between motor impairments and burden. For
example, Martínez-Martín et al. [21] examined Hoehn
and Yahr [27] staging and caregiver burden in a sample
of Spanish caregivers and found that PD severity was a
primary predictor of caregiver burden. Increasing attention
has also been given to the nonmotor symptoms of PD [14],
which may be diﬃcult for caregivers to address. Anywhere
from 25 to 40% of individuals living with PD eventually
develop dementia [28] and may experience related deﬁcits
in attention, memory, and executive functioning [14]. Leroi
et al. [29] found that caregiver burden was signiﬁcantly
higher in caregivers who cared for an individual with PD
who had dementia than those without cognitive impairment

or with only mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that
dementia is independently associated with increased care-
giver burden.

The mental health of PD caregivers has been found to be
lower than that of the general population [30], suggesting
that caregiving may take a toll on an individual’s mental
health. Depression and anxiety speciﬁcally may be critical
to examine as they can elicit cognitive biases that engender
greater feelings of caregiver burden [14, 31]. At least one
study has suggested that the link between depression and
caregiver burden may be particularly critical in PD compared
to other neurological diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease [32]).
To date, very little research has examined PD in regions
outside of North America and Europe. The majority of
research conducted outside of these regions has focused on
data derived from medical records or drug consumption data
[33]. This is problematic for low-to-middle-income coun-
tries, as these estimates inherently exclude individuals who
are unable to obtain medical care or prescription drugs to
treat PD [34]. Further, these studies have also not considered
the unique culturally determined treatment practices and
varying access to care for PD throughout the world [35]. As
such, there is a critical need to examine PD caregiving in
diverse regions of the world, such as Latin America. Given
the rapidly aging population in both the United States [5]
and Mexico [7], rates of PD are likely to rise in both coun-
tries, suggesting that the number of individuals providing
informal care will also increase. As a result, the current study
examined the following connections in two samples of
PD caregivers from the United States and Mexico: (a)
PD-related impairments (motor and nonmotor symptoms)
and caregiver burden, (b) caregiver burden and caregiver
mental health, and (c) PD-related impairments and mental
health through caregiver burden. The current study presents
the results of a secondary analysis of data from another man-
uscript comparing PD caregiver and patient characteristics in
the United States and Mexico [36]. This other manuscript
found that caregivers in the United States site were older than
those in Mexico, spent fewer hours per week providing care,
provided care to an older individual with PD, and had pro-
vided care for a longer duration of time, although there were
no diﬀerences in the number of individuals who assisted the
caregiver in providing care. In the current study, it was
hypothesized that caregiver burden would mediate the asso-
ciation between PD-related impairments and mental health
across both sites.

2. Method

2.1. Participants. This study used cross-sectional data that
were collected from PD caregivers from the Hospital Civil
Fray Antonio Alcalde of the University of Guadalajara in
Guadalajara, Mexico, and the Parkinson’s and Movement
Disorders Center (PMDC) at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Henrico, Virginia. Both centers oﬀer inter-
disciplinary models of health care for patients as well as
services for caregivers. The Hospital Civil Fray Antonio
Alcalde also oﬀers education programs and emotional sup-
port groups led by psychologists and lodging and food

support for caregivers. To be eligible for this study, partic-
ipants had to have met the following inclusion criteria: (a)
identify as a caregiver of an individual diagnosed with PD,
(b) be at least 18 years of age, and (c) be ﬂuent in either
English (for the United States site) or Spanish (for the
Mexico site). Please see Table 1 for PD caregiver and
patient characteristics.

In the United States sample (N = 105), the majority of
caregivers self-identiﬁed as women (68.6%). Caregivers had
a mean age of 68.73 (SD = 8:36) and were predominantly
spouses or partners (93.3%) of individuals with PD. On aver-
age, caregivers had provided care for 49.05 months and
individuals self-
60.43 hours per week. The majority of
identiﬁed as White/European American (92.4%), followed
by Asian/Asian American/Paciﬁc Islander (2.9%), Black/-
African American (non-Latino; 2.9%), multiracial/multieth-
nic (1.0%), or other identity (1.0%). Of the sample, 25.7%
had a high school education or equivalent, 2-year technical
degree (11.4%), 4-year college degree (33.3%), master’s
degree (21.9%), or doctorate degree (7.6%).

the individual

In the Mexico sample (N = 148), the majority of care-
givers self-identiﬁed as women (76.4%) and had a mean age
of 53.66 (SD = 14:96). Over half of the caregivers were
spouses or partners of
living with PD
(51.4%). On average, caregivers provided care for 52.38
(SD = 49:22) months and 107.39 (SD = 61:34) hours per
the sample, 4.7% had no formal education,
week. Of
58.1% had an elementary school education, 5.4% had a
high school education or equivalent, 13.5% had a 2-year
technical degree, 16.2% had a 4-year college degree, and
2.0% had a master’s degree.

2.2.1. PD Impairments. PD-related impairments were
assessed using the Movement Disorder Society-Uniﬁed
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS; [37]). Par-
ticipants were instructed to answer this questionnaire based
on their observations and experiences with the individual liv-
ing with PD. Participants responded to two subscales within
the questionnaire: Part I (nonmotor aspects of experiences of
daily living) and Part II (motor aspects of experiences of daily
living). Participants respond to each item on a Likert-type
scale that ranges from 0 (normal: no problems present) to 4
(severe: problems are present and preclude the patient’s abil-
ity to carry out normal activities or social interactions or to
maintain previous standards in personal or family life). In
the present study, total scores for each subscale were created
by summing scores for each item within the subscale. The
nonmotor experiences of the daily living subscale has accept-
able internal consistency (α = :79), and the motor experi-
ences of daily living has good internal consistency (α = :90;
[37]). Additionally, for symptom-based exploratory analyses,
scores were calculated for the following subdomains on the
MDS-UPDRS: cognitive/mental health (items 1.1-1.6), sleep
and fatigue (items 1.7, 1.8, and 1.13), bowel and bladder
(items 1.10 and 1.11), pain (item 1.9), lightheadedness (item
1.12), activities of daily living (items 2.5-2.8), physical
impairment (items 2.9-2.13 and 1.12), and speech/oral (items
2.1-2.4). The Movement Disorder Society (MDS) has also
translated and validated the scale in Spanish, with the non-
motor experiences of daily living demonstrating acceptable
internal consistency (α = :79) and the motor experiences
of daily living demonstrating good internal consistency
(α = :92; [38]). In the current study, the nonmotor subscale
demonstrated good internal consistency in the Mexico
(α = :80) and the United States sample (α = :85). The motor
subscale also demonstrated good internal consistency in the
Mexico (α = :88) and the United States sample (α = :90). No
speciﬁc instructions were given regarding responding when
the patient was “on” or “oﬀ” medication status.

2.2.2. Caregiver Burden. The short version of the Zarit
Burden Inventory [39] was used to assess caregiver burden.
Participants responded to the 12-item version of the ZBI on
a Likert-type scale from 0 (never) to 4 (nearly always), where
higher scores indicate higher levels of caregiver burden. The
full version of the ZBI has previously been validated in care-
givers of individuals living with Parkinson’s disease [21]. The
ZBI has also been validated in Spanish-speaking individuals
and demonstrated good internal consistency (α = :92; [40]).
In the current study, the measure demonstrated good inter-
nal consistency in the Mexico (α = :86) and United States
samples (α = :91).

2.2.3. Mental Health. To compute the mental health variable,
z-scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9;
[41]), assessing for depressive symptomatology, and the
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; [42]), assessing
for anxiety, were averaged.

4

(1) Depression. Participants responded to the 9-item PHQ-9
[41] on a Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day), where higher scores correspond to greater depres-
sive symptomatology. The PHQ-9 has previously been vali-
dated in Spanish-speaking individuals and demonstrated
good internal consistency (α = :92; [43–45]). In the current
study, the PHQ-9 had good internal consistency in the
Mexico (α = :81) and United States samples (α = :82).

(2) Anxiety. Participants responded to the 7-item GAD-7
[42] on a Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly
every day). Participants’ scores may range from 0 to 21, with
higher scores indicating greater levels of anxiety. The GAD-7
has previously been translated and validated in Spanish and
demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = :92; [46]).
In the current study, the GAD-7 demonstrated good internal
consistency in the Mexico (α = :88) and United States
samples (α = :90).

2.3. Procedure. The protocol
for the current study was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards
at both data collection sites, Virginia Commonwealth
University and the Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde. Par-
ticipants were recruited by research assistants at both sites
using written and verbal advertisements, predominantly
from waiting rooms but also via clinician referral after med-
ical appointments. Email advertisements were also sent to a
listserv at the PMDC at Virginia Commonwealth University.
At each data collection location, interested individuals were
provided with information on the study in the respective
clinic and provided informed consent prior to enrolling in
the study. Participants were screened for eligibility, and if eli-
gible, completed all study measures. The protocol was orally
administered at the Hospital Civil Fray Antonio Alcalde site
to collect demographic and questionnaire data in order to
account for higher rates of illiteracy than at the United States
site. The oral interview took approximately an hour. Partici-
pants from the PMDC completed all survey measures inde-
pendently using pencil and paper. Completion of study
measures took participants approximately the same amount
of time.

2.4. Data Analyses. Four mediational models were created to
determine if caregiver burden mediates the relationship
between PD-related impairments and caregiver mental
health. The ﬁrst model used motor impairments as a predic-
tor and a second model used nonmotor impairments as a
predictor. Each of these models was run separately by site
for a total of four mediational models using the PROCESS
macro [47]. This macro utilizes the Preacher and Hayes
[48, 49] asymptotic bootstrapping approach.
In this
approach, a large number of samples are taken from the data,
and by sampling with replacement, the indirect eﬀect from
each sample is calculated. A sample of 5,000 bootstrap sam-
ples was taken as recommended by Preacher and Hayes
[48, 49]. The indirect eﬀect estimate was calculated by taking
the mean of all of the indirect eﬀects across the bootstrap
samples. In this approach, statistical signiﬁcance is deter-
mined by creating a conﬁdence interval surrounding the

indirect eﬀect. The analysis used a 95% conﬁdence interval
with an α level of .05. The null hypothesis is rejected
(i.e., no indirect eﬀect) if the obtained conﬁdence interval
does not contain zero. All predictor variables (motor and
nonmotor impairments, caregiver burden) were mean-
centered prior to running analyses. Finally, an exploratory
step-wise multiple regression was run predicting caregiver
burden, wherein the ﬁrst step included important demo-
graphic variables as predictors and the second step included
symptom clusters of PD (cognitive/mental health, sleep and
fatigue, bowel and bladder, pain, lightheadedness, activities
of daily living, physical impairment, and speech/oral).

3. Results

3.1. Motor Impairments. Please see Table 2 for a summary of
PD motor impairments. For the Mexico site, the overall
signiﬁcant, Fð2, 145Þ = 5:54, p < :001, and
model was
R2 = :07. The direct path from motor symptoms to caregiver
burden was statistically signiﬁcant (b = :32, p < :001), as was
the path from caregiver burden to caregiver mental health
(b = :06, p = :0016). The motor impairment model demon-
strated a mean bootstrap estimate of the indirect eﬀect of
b = :02. The obtained conﬁdence interval did not contain
zero (.01,
.04), suggesting that caregiver burden mediates
the association between motor impairments and caregiver
mental health among caregivers from the Mexico site. Over-
all, this suggests that greater motor impairments predicted
greater caregiver burden, which predicted greater mental
health deﬁcits among caregivers. The direct eﬀect between
motor impairments and mental health was b = −:01 and
was not signiﬁcant (p = :677), suggesting that caregiver bur-
den fully mediated the association between motor symptoms
and caregiver mental health.

Similar results were obtained for the United States
site. The overall model was signiﬁcant, Fð2, 102Þ = 26:48,
p < :001, and R2 = :34. The direct path from motor symptoms
to caregiver burden was statistically signiﬁcant (b = :44,
p < :001), as was the path from caregiver burden to caregiver
mental health (b = :14, p < :001). The motor impairment
model demonstrated a mean bootstrap estimate of the indi-
rect eﬀect of b = :06. The obtained conﬁdence interval did
not contain zero (.04,
.09), suggesting that caregiver bur-
den mediated the association between motor impairments
and caregiver mental health among caregivers from the
United States site. Given that the direct eﬀect between motor
impairments and mental health was b = −:03 and was not sig-
niﬁcant (p = :097), this suggests that caregiver burden fully
mediated the association between motor impairments and
caregiver mental health.

3.2. Nonmotor Impairments. Please see Table 2 for a sum-
mary of PD nonmotor impairments. For the Mexico site,
the overall model was signiﬁcant, Fð2, 145Þ = 6:46, p = :002,
and R2 = :08. The direct path from nonmotor symptoms
to caregiver burden was statistically signiﬁcant (b = :48,
p < :001) and the direct path from caregiver burden to
caregiver mental health was signiﬁcant (b = :05, p = :026).
The nonmotor impairment model demonstrated a mean

4. Discussion

The current study examined PD caregivers in Henrico,
Virginia, and Guadalajara, Mexico, and the relations among
PD-related impairments, caregiver burden, and caregiver
mental health. Results from both the motor and nonmotor
impairments models suggest that caregiver burden fully
mediates the association between PD-related impairments
and caregiver mental health in both caregivers from the
United States and from Mexico. Generally, prior research
has supported the links among PD-related impairments
and caregiver burden [14], caregiver burden and mental
health [31], and PD-related impairments and mental health
[20, 50]. To date, this is the ﬁrst evidence that caregiver bur-
den fully mediates the relations between both PD-related
motor and nonmotor impairments and mental health. One
possible explanation for these results is that as PD-related
impairments become more severe, levels of caregiver burden
increase, which in turn may lead to poorer mental health.

study. Further,

in the current

PD-related impairments, particularly nonmotor symp-
toms, were associated with deleterious outcomes for care-
givers
the exploratory
multiple regression suggested that cognitive/mental health
symptoms had the biggest impact on caregiver burden. These
ﬁndings are similar to those of Schrag et al. [51], who found
that PD caregiver burden was particularly related to nonmo-
tor symptoms including depression, hallucinations, and con-
fusion. The current ﬁndings in light of the previous research
suggest that it may be important for health care providers of
caregivers to be mindful of nonmotor PD-related impair-
ments and how they may aﬀect the psychosocial functioning
and well-being of the caregiver. Interventions that target
PD-related impairments may also be useful
in reducing
caregiver burden and have already received some support
in the literature. For example, interventions that promote
independence and functioning among individuals with PD

may be associated with reduced caregiver burden. Recently,
exercise interventions for individuals with PD have received
attention. Oguh et al. [52] found that individuals with PD
who exercised more than 150 minutes a week had better
quality of life, physical function, and reduced disease pro-
gression, as well as less caregiver burden among their care-
givers than those who were not regular exercisers.

Targeting nonmotor symptoms may also serve to reduce
deleterious outcomes for caregivers, such as caregiver burden
and mental health issues. For example, previous studies have
shown that addressing dementia with cognitive enhancers
has been associated with reduced caregiver burden [53, 54].
Prior research has also demonstrated that tailored cognitive
behavioral therapy for individuals with PD with anxiety is
associated with reduced caregiver burden [55]. Overall, these
studies suggest that there is beneﬁt in considering PD-related
impairments for caregivers, particularly as it may relate to
burden. It is important to note that these studies were not
conducted in Latin America or with diverse samples. As
such, future research should seek to determine if these
interventions are also eﬀective among individuals with
PD and caregivers in other geographic regions and among
racially/ethnically diverse samples.

The current study suggests that reducing caregiver bur-
den is an important target for intervention as it channels
directly into mental health. To date, there have been a num-
ber of interventions that target burden among caregivers of
intervention that
individuals with PD. One educational
addressed the scheduling of pleasant activities, communica-
tion, reducing burden, and managing stress was shown to
signiﬁcantly reduce burden from baseline [56]. Further,
interventions emphasizing education and fellowship with
other caregivers have also been reported in the literature
and have received qualitative support for reducing caregiver
burden [18, 57, 58]. However, again, none of these interven-
tions were conducted in Latin America and did not consist of
diverse samples (in terms of race/ethnicity, languages spo-
ken, etc.). Therefore, it is unclear if these interventions would
be eﬀective in this geographical region. As such, another crit-
ical target for intervention is the development and evaluation
of interventions that may be culturally adapted for caregivers
living in Latin America.

One such cultural consideration would be the inﬂuence
of gender-role expectations as they contribute to caregiver
burden. Links between female PD caregivers and increased
anxiety have been found in some studies [20] while others
have found no diﬀerences in mental health outcomes by sex
[59]. However, there is evidence that Mexican gender-role
expectations inﬂuence the amount and types (e.g., instru-
mental and emotional) of caregiving done by each sex;
women take on markedly more caregiving duties than men,
which may provide insight into potential lower mental health
ratings [60]. Another cultural consideration is that the only
demographic predictor of caregiver burden was education,
such that higher education was associated with greater care-
giver burden. This could be because caregivers with a higher
educational level may have additional work-related duties
that contribute unique stressors on top of heavy caregiving
responsibilities. It would be important to consider whether

8

educational attainment plays a diﬀerential role in caregiving
in the U.S. versus Mexico, as U.S. caregivers have higher edu-
cational attainment. Future cross-cultural studies should
attempt to tease out the contributions of gender roles and
education in PD caregiver burden.

Given the demonstrated associations between mental
health and deleterious outcomes for caregivers (e.g., burden),
caregiver mental health may be an important intervention
target. To date, at least one cognitive behavioral intervention
has been shown to reduce caregiver burden among caregivers
who report emotional distress. Secker and Brown [61] found
that 12 to 14 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy focused
on relaxation, sleep hygiene, accessing support, and challeng-
ing negative beliefs delivered by a clinical psychologist
reduced burden six months postintervention compared to
the control group. Given the lack of mental health interven-
tions for PD caregivers in Latin America, interventions that
are culturally tailored for this population may serve to
address the mental health needs of PD caregivers in a cultur-
ally sensitive manner.

4.1. Limitations and Future Research

4.1.1. Methodological Weaknesses in Data Collection. The
present study is limited in that it only recruited from two out-
patient clinics: a specialty clinic in Henrico, Virginia, and a
clinic in Guadalajara, Mexico. As such, the current study
likely did not capture caregivers of individuals in the later
stages of PD when individuals are likely to be institutional-
ized [62]. Given evidence demonstrating caregiver burden
is highest in stage IV immediately prior to institutionaliza-
tion at stage V [62], the relationships identiﬁed in the current
study among outpatient caregivers may not generalize to all
PD caregivers.

The data in the current study were collected using a
slightly diﬀerent methodology at the Mexico site and the
United States site. At the United States site, caregivers com-
pleted the study measures independently using paper and
pencil. In contrast, at the Mexico site, researchers used oral
interviews to collect data from participants (in order to
account for potential problems with illiteracy), which may
have inﬂuenced the responses of participants. In addition,
the study measures utilized in the current study (apart from
the MDS-UPDRS) were validated for self-report and not for
oral interviews. Therefore, it is possible that caregivers from
the Mexico site responded diﬀerently from caregivers from
the United States site.

Another limitation is that the data in this study were col-
lected exclusively from caregivers. Therefore, the data in the
their perceptions of PD-related
current study represent
impairments and caregiver burden and mental health. Future
studies should also aim to use more objective measures such
as patient medical records to assess PD-related impairments.
It may be particularly helpful to collect objective information
on disease stage, which has been associated with deleterious
outcomes for caregivers such as burden [21] and which
unfortunately was not collected in the current study. Further-
more, collecting data regarding whether or not the patient
is currently taking PD medication may be informative, as

dopamine agonists and L-dopa (which are often used to
address PD symptomatology) may have a number of side
eﬀects. The unintended eﬀects of
these pharmaceutical
agents may include nausea, impulsive behaviors (includ-
ing impulse control disorders), dopamine dysregulation
syndrome, and psychosis [63], which may result in nega-
tive consequences for the caregiver such as lower quality
of life [19, 20].

4.1.2. Cross-Sectional Methodology. Since the current study
was cross-sectional in nature, causal inferences cannot be
made. Future research should utilize cross-lagged panel
designs or other longitudinal methods to infer whether the
relations identiﬁed in the current study may be causal in
nature. Further, it is possible that some of the relationships
are reciprocal. For example, it is possible that mental health
problems also inﬂuence levels of caregiver burden.

4.1.3. Generalizability. Given that the samples in the current
study came from two clinics, it is possible that the experi-
ences of these caregivers may not generalize to the popula-
tion of caregivers of individuals living with PD in the
United States and Mexico. For example, caregivers at the
United States site were recruited from a PD specialty clinic
in a suburban area, suggesting that the individuals they care
for are at least receiving some health care. Similarly, partici-
pants from the Mexico site were recruited from a large, urban
hospital, also suggesting they have at least some access to
health care. The experiences of caregivers without health
care, such as those in rural areas, may diﬀer greatly from
caregivers who do have health care.

5. Conclusions

The current study examined associations among PD-related
impairments, caregiver burden, and caregiver mental health
among caregivers of individuals with PD residing in the
United States and Mexico. Findings from the current study
as well as prior literature highlight the importance of target-
ing critical caregiver outcomes such as caregiver burden and
caregiver mental health.
