Abstract

Objectives

There is a gap between clinical practice guidelines for social anxiety disorder and clinical
practice that needs to be addressed to ensure the delivery of evidence-based treatments.
The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe mental health service utilization in a cohort
of primary care patients with social anxiety disorder; 2) to examine treatment adequacy for
pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy according to indicators based on clinical practice
guidelines; and 3) to explore correlates of treatment adequacy.

Method

The “Dialogue” project (Quebec, Canada) is a large study conducted in 67 primary care clin-
ics. After a mental health screening in primary care (n = 14 833), participants with anxiety or
depressive symptoms took part in a telephone/web structured interview on mental health
symptoms and service utilization (n = 1956). This study included 289 participants meeting
DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder.

Results

Overall, 86.2% of participants reported consulting for mental health reasons over the past
12 months. Only 23.6% of our sample reported the detection of social anxiety disorder by a
healthcare professional in the past 12 months. Approximately 2 in 5 respondents with social
anxiety disorder reported receiving pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy meeting our treat-
ment adequacy indicators. Antidepressant medication was the most common treatment.
Logistic regression models showed that the detection of major depression (OR = 4.651;
95% CI: 2.559–8.453) or other anxiety disorder(s) (OR = 2.957; 95% CI: 1.555–5.625) were
associated with receiving any adequate treatment, but the detection of social anxiety disor-
der itself was not (OR = 1.420; 95% CI: 0.696–2.899).

Treatment adequacy for social anxiety disorder in primary care patients

Conclusion

Low rates of detection and treatment adequacy based on our indicators demonstrate that
efforts must be made to ensure the quality of care for individuals with social anxiety disorder
in primary care.

Introduction

In Canada, the 12-month prevalence of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is estimated to be 3.2%,
whereas lifetime prevalence is approximately 8.1% [1]. Individuals living with SAD experience
intense discomfort when interacting socially due to the fear of acting in a way that could be neg-
atively evaluated and/or lead to humiliation or rejection [2]. SAD is associated with avoidance
behaviour [2] and is known to impair social functioning and to have negative consequences on
educational attainment, occupational performance, relationships and quality of life [3–5].

For the treatment of SAD, whereas some clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) emphasize psy-
chotherapy as the initial treatment when congruent with patient preferences [6], the Canadian
Psychiatric Association considers either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy as a first-line
treatment [7]. The combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is not formally rec-
ommended in the latter CPGs [7] while NICE considers this option adequate for non- or par-
tially responsive patients [6]. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the gold-standard non-
pharmacological treatment of SAD [6,7]. Regarding medication, first-line options include
some SSRIs, venlafaxine and pregabalin, with second-line alternatives adding some benzodiaz-
epines, gabapentin and phenelzine as reasonable treatment options [7]. Despite the availability
of well-established CPGs, the treatment adequacy rates reported in previous studies are gener-
ally low, ranging from 34.1% to 38.7% for SAD [8–10], and from 27.0% to 54.5% for other anx-
iety disorders [8–16]. These studies highlight the gap between treatment guidelines and
current practice, as well as the limited data available to understand this gap for SAD. In order
to improve treatment adequacy rates at the population level, it is necessary to expand our
understanding of the factors involved with receiving evidence-based treatment for SAD.

This study aimed to assess mental health service utilization and correlates of treatment ade-

quacy in a large sample of primary care patients suffering from SAD in Quebec, Canada. Our
specific objectives were: 1) to assess mental health service utilization; 2) to evaluate the ade-
quacy of pharmacological and psychological treatments, based on indicators derived from
CPGs; and 3) to identify correlates of treatment adequacy by investigating the contribution of
conceptually distinct predisposing factors, enabling factors and need for care factors based on
Andersen’s Behavioural Model of Health Care [17].

Methods
Study setting, participants and data collection

This cross-sectional study used data drawn from the "Dialogue" project, a large cohort study
initiated in 2008 which has been described elsewhere (see Roberge et al., 2015) [18]. Fig 1 pres-
ents the flowchart of the recruitment and selection process.

Waiting room interview (T0)

Participants were first approached by a lay-interviewer in the waiting room of one of the 67
participating primary care clinics to fill a brief self-administered screening questionnaire

including socio-demographic, overall health status, consultations with health care providers
and psychotropic medication use questions, as well as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression

Scale (HADS) [19,20]. Participants had to be 1) 18 years or older; 2) consulting a general prac-
titioner for themselves; and 3) able to complete the questionnaire in French or English. A total
of 14 833 participants completed this interview.

Telephone/web interview (T1)

Waiting room interview participants were invited to a telephone/web follow-up interview if
they reported either: elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (�8 [21,22] on the HADS
[19,20]), any anxiety or depression medication use in the previous 12 months, anxious or
depressive disorder diagnosis made by a physician, or consultation for mental health problems
in the previous 12 months. The follow-up interview included the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview–Simplified (CIDIS) [23], a brief structured psychiatric interview for lay-
interviewers tailored to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for common mental disorders [23]. Partic-
ipants were also asked questions on experience of care, service utilization for emotional rea-
sons, medication use for anxiety or depressive symptoms, perceived needs for care and socio-
demographic data if they met DSM-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disor-
der, agoraphobia, social phobia or depression in the last 12 months; or if they reported a high
level of anxiety or depression symptoms combined with any of the following: current medica-
tion use, an anxiety or depressive disorder diagnosis by a healthcare professional, or DSM-IV
criteria for anxiety or depression in the past 24 months. A total of 1956 participants completed
both parts of the phone/web survey and were positive cases for any CIDIS disorder(s) (general-
ized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety and/or major depression).
For this study, we included only the subset of 289 participants aged between 18 and 65 years
old meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD according to the CIDIS.

Variables

Indicators for detection, service utilization and treatment adequacy. Depending on the
timeframe, there were two types of “detection” indicators. First, we collected data on the detec-
tion of SAD, major depression and other anxiety disorders based on participants reporting
having been informed of the diagnosis by a healthcare professional in the previous 12 months.
Secondly, the lifetime detection of any anxiety disorders as well as the detection of chronic
physical disorders were based on participants reporting of a diagnosis by a physician.

Indicators for service utilization included: 1) hospitalization for at least one night for mental

health reasons in the 12 months preceding the interview; and 2) consultation with at least one
health professional for mental health reasons in the previous 12 months (including general
practitioners, psychologists, social workers, counsellors or psychotherapists, nurses, psychia-
trists, or other specialized physicians).

Treatment adequacy included pharmacotherapy adequacy, psychotherapy adequacy and overall

adequacy, which were defined using indicators based on the Canadian CPGs [24] using available
proxies. Our indicator of treatment adequacy for pharmacotherapy was defined as: 1) reporting
using evidence-based medication for SAD with a level 2 or higher level of evidence [24] 2) at an
adequate dosage, while 3) having attended 3 or more visits with a general practitioner or a psychia-
trist in the previous 12 months. Our indicator of treatment adequacy for psychotherapy was
defined as reporting all the following: 1) having attended at least 8 visits with the same healthcare
professional (general practitioner, psychologist, psychiatrist, counsellor, psychotherapist or social
worker); 2) having received at least 15 minutes of counselling or psychotherapy; 3) having attended
psychotherapy including a probable CBT approach. The probable CBT approach indicator was
determined by a set of questions asking the type of received psychological help. Participants were
first asked if they received psychological help in the form of psychotherapy/counselling session

with a professional (�15 minutes) in the past 12 months. Then, they were asked if they had experi-
enced cognitive behaviour therapy (i.e. learning how to change thoughts, behaviours and emo-
tions). These indicators were chosen using the 2006 Canadian Anxiety Guidelines [24], which were
the current guidelines at the time of the "Dialogue" study.

Individual-level patient characteristics.

Individual characteristics were organized

according to Andersen’s Behavioural Model of Health Care [17] which is a conceptual frame-
work operationalizing three types of factors associated with the use of health services: predis-
posing factors refer to an individual’s socio-cultural characteristics; enabling factors facilitate
or support the use of healthcare; and need factors indicate the evaluated or perceived need for
healthcare [17]. Variable selection was made according to previous literature, potential clinical
relevance and the appropriateness of deriving proxies from available self-reported data [8–
16,25,26]. The included three predisposing factors were gender (male; female), age group (18–
24; 25–45; 46–65) and education level (high school or less; college degree; university degree).
The five enabling factors included perception of income (poor/very poor; sufficient; more than
enough), marital status (single; married/living together; separated/divorced/widowed), private
insurance coverage for complementary health services (yes; no), affiliation with a family physi-
cian (yes; no), occupation (working or studying full time: yes; no). The four need factors were
detection of SAD (yes; no), detection of comorbid major depression (yes; no), detection of
comorbid anxiety disorders (yes; no) and comorbid chronic physical illness(es) (yes; no).

Statistical analysis

Participant characteristics, service utilization and treatment adequacy based on our indicators
were described using frequencies and proportions. Variables with insufficient case numbers to
satisfy statistical test postulates were either excluded from further analysis or categories were
combined, if conceptually relevant. Analysis were carried out independently for the following
adequacy indicators as dependent variables: 1) pharmacological treatment; 2) psychological
treatment; and 3) pharmacological and/or psychological treatment. As the definition of ade-
quate psychotherapy for SAD varies considerably between studies, we also ran a sensitivity
analysis using �12 sessions as the criterion for the adequate number of sessions (instead of 8).
All independent variables were kept in each logistic regression model to allow for direct model
comparison between adequacy indicators.

For chronic comorbid illness, we included pain [27,28], pulmonary [27,29], circulatory
[27,29,30] and gastro-intestinal disorder [27,31] on the account of the complex relation that
has been established between anxiety and these illnesses. Other physical comorbidity variables
were added to the model individually to rule out potential unknown associations, but none
were retained as they did not improve the goodness of fit of the model.

Binary logistic regression assumes a dichotomic dependent variable, independent observa-
tions, and little or no multicollinearity among independent variables. Collinearity was assessed in
two steps. First, we used the phi coefficient (for dichotomic variables) and Cramer’s V (for cate-
gorical variables) to estimate binary correlations. Secondly, we used the generalized variance infla-
tion factor statistic to assess multicollinearity, with a threshold of 10. No assumption violation has
been detected. Logistic regression was performed for each dependent variable using α = 0.05. All
analysis were conducted with SPSS version 24. The generalized variance inflation factor has been
obtained through R 3.4.1 using the stepVIF function included in the Pedometrics package [32].
Study participants provided written informed consent at the time of the initial contact in
primary care clinics after a lay-interviewer carefully explained the study aims and ethical con-
siderations. Lay-interviewers received initial training and ongoing supervision, and the capac-
ity to consent was evaluated verbally by the interviewers (without specific psychological tests).

Results
Participant characteristics

The sample characteristics of the T0 and T1 samples have been presented in a previous article
[20] and assessed for selection bias in a previous research report [33; in French]. Respondents
at T0 were more likely to be women and younger than non-respondent. Compared to the non-
respondent, in the T1 sample, there were fewer people aged 65 or more, fewer men, more peo-
ple with a self-reported low or moderate mental health, more diagnosed physical and mental
illness, more people using medication for anxiety or depression and more people who had
consulted a psychologist. Table 1 reports the individual characteristics of the selected subsam-
ple of 289 individuals in the Dialogue project aged between 18 and 65 years old that met
DSM-IV criteria for SAD according to the CIDIS in the past 12 months. The majority of our
sample were females (73.0%). The mean age was 41 (SD: 12.5) years old and half of the sample
was either working or studying full time (51.2%). A large proportion of individuals had private
medication insurance coverage (64.4%) and insurance coverage for complementary health ser-
vices (50.7%) such as chiropractic, physiotherapy or psychotherapy. In our sample, 8 out of 10
individuals reported having a family physician.

In our sample, 57.4% of participants reported detection of a comorbid anxiety disorder by a

healthcare professional in the previous 12 months (at least one comorbid agoraphobia, panic
disorder or generalized anxiety disorder) and 46.4% reported comorbid major depression. For
only 28.4% of the sample, no anxio-depressive comorbidity were detected. Excluding mood and
anxiety disorders, 5.5% of the sample reported having a long-term comorbid mental disorder
diagnosed by a health care professional. The two most frequent amongst these other mental ill-
nesses were attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and personality disorders. On average, par-
ticipants reported experiencing their first social anxiety symptoms at 21 years of age (SD: 10.9)
as part of the CIDIS interview [23] when asked about the first time they experienced intense
and irrational fear of social situations. At least three in four individuals reported being diag-
nosed by a physician with a comorbid chronic physical illness. The most prevalent chronic
physical illnesses reported were back pain (25.3%), migraine (23.2%) and hypertension (18.0%).

Service utilization

Table 2 shows descriptive data concerning mental health service utilization in our sample.
Overall, 86.2% of the sample had consulted at least one professional for mental health reasons
in the previous 12 months. Among service users, 85.1% reported having seen a general practi-
tioner for a median of 4 (interquartile range: 5) visits. As for psychologists, 48.8% of individu-
als had seen one in the last 12 months with a median of 3 (interquartile range: 5.25) visits.
Throughout their life, 63.0% of participants reported at least one anxiety disorder diagnosed
by a physician. In our sample, among participants reporting at least one consultation with a
health professional for mental health reasons in the past 12 months, one in four participants
also reported SAD detection by a healthcare professional in the previous 12 months.

including at least 15 minutes of counselling with a probable CBT approach, with the same

Factors associated with our indicators of treatment adequacy

Table 4 presents results of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showing asso-
ciation between predisposing, enabling or need factors and treatment adequacy based on our
indicators.

Pharmacotherapy adequacy. Neither predisposing nor enabling factors were significantly

associated with pharmacotherapy adequacy based on our indicators. Regarding need factors,
participants with comorbid major depression (OR = 5.492; CI 95% [2.913–10.335]) or comor-
bid anxiety disorders (OR = 3.081; CI 95% [1.545–6.145]) in the previous 12 months were
more likely to receive an adequate pharmacological treatment according to our indicator
based on Canadian clinical practice guidelines [24].

Psychotherapy adequacy. Regarding our indicator of psychotherapy adequacy, there was
no association with selected predisposing factors in multivariate analysis. Among enabling fac-
tors, full-time working or studying was associated with a lower probability of psychotherapy
adequacy (OR = 0.446; CI 95% [0.203–0.981]). Regarding need factors, comorbid major
depression (OR: 3.298; CI 95% [1.599–6.801]) was associated with higher treatment adequacy.
Sensitivity analysis using 12 for the minimal number of sessions as a criterion for adequate
psychotherapy instead of 8 can be found in S1 Table. In sensitivity analysis, comorbid anxiety
disorder(s) was also associated with higher treatment adequacy for psychotherapy (OR: 2.889;
CI 95% [1.183–7.059]).

Overall adequacy. Factors positively associated with our indicators of adequate pharma-

cotherapy and/or psychotherapy were both need factors, namely the diagnosis of comorbid
major depression (OR = 4.651; CI 95% [2.559–8.453]) and anxiety disorder(s) (OR = 2.957; CI
95% [1.555–5.625]) in the past 12 months by a healthcare professional. The predisposing factor
of being between 46 and 65 years old (OR = 0.508; CI 95% [0.260–0.993]) and the enabling fac-
tor of working or studying full time (OR = 0.523; CI 95% [0.275–0.995]) were both associated
with lower treatment adequacy. In the sensitivity analysis using � 12 sessions instead of � 8 as

Discussion

Data from the Dialogue cross-sectional survey in primary care clinics allowed us to assess pri-
mary care mental health service utilization, to evaluate treatment adequacy based on our indi-
cators for SAD and to determine which factors were associated with adequacy using
Andersen’s Behavioural Model of Health Care [17]. Reported mental health service utilization
was high in our sample, estimated at 86.2%. Previous studies have found that only a low pro-
portion of individuals living with SAD seeks help for their condition [34–36]. It has been sug-
gested that some individuals may not recognize having an emotional problem or that they
could benefit from mental health counselling [36]. The high service utilization may be

explained by our primary care sampling strategy and high levels of psychiatric comorbidity
observed among participants with SAD. Recruitment in our study required consulting for one-
self in primary care, and characteristics of respondents in contact with primary health care ser-
vices may differ from SAD in the general population. Furthermore, participants, while not
seeking help for their SAD, could seek help for comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders,
which they may think requires more attention [36]. It has been shown that the presence of
comorbid depression in individuals with anxiety disorders increases service use for mental

health problems [37–39]. It is also possible that using a dichotomic indicator of any visit for
mental health reasons may not be sensitive enough to capture the service utilization differences
among anxiety disorders.

Even if the majority of patients with SAD reported mental health service use, the detection
rate of SAD by a healthcare professional was low, estimated at 23.6%. As a comparison point, we
found a detection rate of 52.5% for participants with generalized anxiety disorder in the Dialogue
Project [18]. Low rates of SAD detection have also been reported elsewhere [40]. When there are
multiple comorbidities, as in our sample, there is a possibility that only the primary diagnosis is
mentioned to the patient by the healthcare professional. In that case, participants might still be
treated simultaneously for multiple conditions as treatments show similarities across conditions,
and undisclosed diagnosis does not necessarily mean lack of treatment, as shown by our treat-
ment adequacy data. It is also possible that SAD symptoms are missed because of patients feeling
uncomfortable or unwilling to talk about their emotional problems from fear of being stigma-
tized or negatively judged [41]. Health care professionals may also dismiss some symptoms, or
attribute them to other conditions or personal attributes, such as shyness.

As expected, treatment adequacy based on our indicators was low to moderate for both
pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, respectively 32.2% and 20.6%. Overall, treatment ade-
quacy rates based on our indicators were within range of what is found in the literature for
SAD [8–10]. However, direct comparisons must be made with caution due to heterogeneous
definitions of pharmacotherapy [8–10] and psychotherapy adequacy [8–10] as well as the dif-
ference between study settings [8,10]. For psychotherapy, while 49.9% reported having had
any form of counselling or psychotherapy, the number of sessions required for our indicator
of adequacy (� 8) has been achieved for less than half of the participants. The low treatment
adequacy for psychotherapy based on our indicators may reflect the difficulty in the continuity
with a sufficient number of sessions, rather than initial access to counselling or psychotherapy
[42]. Interpretation of this finding should be tempered by the cross-dataset; some of the
respondents may be currently undergoing psychotherapy. It is interesting to note that sensitiv-
ity analysis revealed that comorbid anxiety disorder(s) was associated with higher treatment
adequacy for psychotherapy, indicating that more complex clinical presentation may necessi-
tate more extensive treatment plan, as expected.

Comorbid major depression disorder was associated with treatment adequacy for SAD,
which is consistent with other studies on anxiety disorders [9,11,12,18]. Comorbid anxiety dis-
orders were also associated with treatment adequacy for SAD as found in the Canadian Com-
munity Health Survey [12]. Considering that comorbid anxiety disorders and/or major
depression were the most significant factors associated with treatment adequacy, a probable
explanation could be that comorbidity in our sample indirectly increased treatment adequacy
because of shared adequate treatment options between SAD and other common mental disor-
ders. In primary care, the detection rate of major depression have been shown to be higher than
for anxiety disorders, including SAD [40]. Additionally, the absence of association between the
detection of SAD and treatment adequacy in our regression models supports the role of comor-
bidities in treatment adequacy, although it was not possible to differentiate for which partici-
pants SAD was the primary versus a secondary mental health problem. Ruscio et al. (2008),
using the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) data, found that 68.9% of individ-
uals with lifetime SAD reported having received treatment for mental health problems while
only 35.2% of individuals reported having received treatment specifically for their SAD [43].

Although this study provides useful insights on the treatment adequacy for SAD and its deter-
minants, some limitations must be considered in the interpretation of the results. First, our treat-
ment indicators are based on Canadian clinical guidelines and are believed to be adequate from a
population perspective. However, in an evidence-based practice model for individual patients,

they are only relevant when tailored for the patient needs through the clinical judgment of a
healthcare professional, and in light of patient preferences. Accordingly, we did not expect com-
plete agreement of practice with CPGs. Second, this study used data from a cross-sectional sur-
vey, with a possibility of social desirability and recall bias. The social desirability bias could have
influenced the answer given by participants and implies that they may have answered according
to what seemed more favourable to the interviewer. A recall bias could also have affected the
accuracy of the information collected during the interview, particularly for our mental health ser-
vice use indicators. A study by Drapeau et al. (2011) showed over-reporting of mental health ser-
vice use on a 12-month timeframe [44]. Third, our dataset was collected in 2008–2009, and
changes in mental health care policy and clinical practice could have lead to variations in rates of
treatment adequacy for SAD. Access to psychotherapy in the public sector remains difficult in
our health care context [45]. We expect that the treatment adequacy rates are still accurate for
psychotherapy, but we anticipate that treatment adequacy rates for pharmacotherapy may have
increased due to documented trends on antidepressant use [46]. We believe that data on treat-
ment adequacy in our sample could be considered as a baseline to be taken into account in
national quality improvement initiatives aiming at policy or practice change to improve treat-
ment adequacy for anxiety disorders. There is a possibly that the high prevalence of mental health
comorbidity in our sample is affected by a selection bias as, by comparison to the non-respon-
dents at T1, respondents were more likely to be affected by mental illness. Selection bias is also a
possible contributor to the high female:male ratio, although a high proportion of female partici-
pants was expected given the primary care sampling [47–49] and the higher prevalence of
females among people living with SAD [1,2,50–56].Finally, this study was not powered to specif-
ically investigate the subsample of participants suffering from SAD; this could be reflected in the
absence of an association for some variables with either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy ade-
quacy, while being significantly associated with overall adequacy, as it is the case with age.

Conclusion

From a primary care standpoint, our results demonstrate that SAD is under-detected and
under-treated. Both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy adequacy were found to be low in
this study for individuals living with SAD, and antidepressants remain the most prescribed
treatment. Among factors associated with higher treatment adequacy, need factors, specifically
the detection of comorbid anxiety or depressive disorders, show the strongest association with
our treatment adequacy indicators. Since the detection of SAD itself was not found to be inde-
pendently correlated with receiving treatment, one can wonder if treatment adequacy for SAD
might be an artefact of shared treatment options with psychiatric comorbidities. In light of
these results, efforts should be directed toward increasing the recognition and treatment of
SAD to assure adequate treatment in hopes of fostering personal recovery.
