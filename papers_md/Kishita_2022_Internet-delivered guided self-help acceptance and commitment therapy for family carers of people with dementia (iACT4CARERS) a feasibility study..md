ABSTRACT 
Objectives:  The  feasibility  of  research  into  internet-delivered  guided  self-help  Acceptance  and 
Commitment Therapy  (ACT)  for  family  carers  of  people  with  dementia  is  not  known. This  study 
assessed this in an uncontrolled feasibility study.
Method: Family carers of people with dementia with mild to moderate anxiety or depression were 
recruited from primary and secondary healthcare services in the UK. Participants were offered eight, 
guided, self-help online ACT sessions adapted for the needs of family carers of people with dementia 
with optional online peer support groups. Pre-defined primary indicators of success included recruit-
ment of 30 eligible carers over 6 months and ≥70% completing at least two online sessions.
Results: Thirty-three participants (110% of the target sample) were recruited over 6 months and 30 
participants (91%) completed two or more sessions, and thus both indicators of success were met. 
Further, 70% of participants completed seven or all eight sessions, and 27% of participants were lost 
to follow-up, but none of the reasons for early withdrawal were related to the intervention.
Conclusion: This study supports the feasibility, including recruitment and treatment completion. A 
full-scale trial to assess the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the intervention including its long-term 
effects is warranted.

Introduction

In many countries, family members are considered to be an 
essential  workforce  in  caring  for  people  with  dementia. The 
current annual economic cost of dementia in the UK is esti-
mated  at  £26.3  billion  (Prince  et  al.,  2014),  with  health  and 
social care costs outweighing those of cancer, coronary heart 
disease and stroke combined (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2015). 
Forty-four percent of this annual economic cost of dementia 
is contributed by unpaid informal carers such as family mem-
bers (Prince et al., 2014).

Previous systematic reviews demonstrate that the pooled 
prevalence of depression and anxiety in family carers of people 
with  dementia  are  31.2%  and  32.1%,  respectively  (Collins  & 
Kishita, 2020; Kaddour & Kishita, 2020). This prevalence esti-
mate of depression is higher than the pooled prevalence of 
depression among outpatients diagnosed with a medical con-
dition (Wang et al., 2017). The prevalence estimate of anxiety 
is substantially greater than family carers of people with other 
conditions such as cancer (Friðriksdóttir et al., 2011) and stroke 
(Loh et al., 2017).

Despite  the  negative  consequences  of  caregiving,  many 
carers receive no or only minimal support for their own psy-
chological needs due to barriers such as mobility constraints 
and limited availability of skilled therapists (Alzheimer’s Society, 
2014). One way to address the challenges of treatment acces-
sibility  in  this  population,  and  also  scalability,  is  to  design  a 

service that can be delivered remotely, accessed at home, and 
at the time chosen by the participant. Internet-delivered inter-
ventions have a strong potential to overcome these challenges.
A recent meta-analysis concluded that psychotherapeutic 
interventions or interventions that include psychotherapeutic 
components demonstrate the largest effects on reduction of 
depressive symptoms in family carers of people with dementia 
(Cheng et al., 2020). The manualised psychological therapies 
for carers of people with dementia, which have been researched 
so far, are mainly based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) 
and delivered face-to-face. A recent meta-analysis of in-person 
or telephone CBT for family carers of people with dementia 
delivered by trained professionals demonstrated a small overall 
effect of CBT on depression (d = 0.34), while no significant over-
all effect was observed for anxiety (Hopkinson et al., 2019). A 
meta-analysis  focusing  solely  on  internet-  or  DVD-delivered 
self-help CBT for family carers of people with dementia demon-
strated that an overall effect of CBT on depression appeared 
reduced in comparison to in-person or telephone CBT (d = 0.27) 
when a self-help format is used (Scott et al., 2016). The effect 
on carer anxiety was not reported. These figures suggest a need 
for improvement, particularly in terms of the effective provision 
of self-help psychological therapies among this population.

Acceptance  and  commitment  therapy  (ACT)  is  an  evi-
dence-based psychological treatment, which aims to facilitate 
psychological  flexibility  (Hayes  et  al.,  2013).  ACT  aims  to 
improve one’s psychological flexibility through three sets of

skills: stepping back from restricting thoughts and approaching 
or allowing painful emotions; focusing on the present, connect-
ing with what is happening in the moment; and clarifying and 
acting  on  what  is  most  important  to  do  and  building  larger 
patterns of effective values-based action (Hayes et al., 2013).

ACT  has  a  strong  evidence  base  for  improving  outcomes 
such as mood and quality of life in various populations including 
people  with  depression,  anxiety,  chronic  pain  and  somatic 
symptoms  (A-Tjak  et  al.,  2015;  Gloster  et  al.,  2020;  Hann  & 
McCracken, 2014). Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
of ACT for family carers of people with dementia also demon-
strated that in-person ACT delivered by trained professionals 
can reduce depression and anxiety in family carers (Losada et 
al., 2015; Marquez-Gonzalez et al., 2020).

Recent reviews of RCTs of internet-delivered guided or non-
guided  self-help  ACT  demonstrated  that  internet-delivered 
self-help ACT can reduce depression and anxiety, although the 
majority of included studies targeted either general or student 
populations; studies that targeted family carers were not iden-
tified (Brown et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2021). A more recent 
RCT  explored  the  effectiveness  of  internet-delivered  guided 
self-help ACT for informal carers aged 60 and over providing 
care  to  a  spouse  or  child  living  with  or  without  disease 
(Lappalainen  et  al.,  2021). Twenty-six  percent  of  participants 
were caring for a family member with memory-related problems 
and the findings demonstrated that internet-delivered self-help 
ACT guided by trained psychology and gerontology students 
was effective in reducing depression when compared to usual 
care, while no effects were found for anxiety.

Current evidence suggests that internet-delivered, guided, 
self-help ACT may have a considerable potential to treat depres-
sion  and  anxiety  in  family  carers  of  people  with  dementia. 
However, prior to a full-scale RCT, a feasibility study needs to be 
conducted to test the planned methodology and ensure that 
internet-delivered  guided  self-help  ACT  is  acceptable  to  the 
targeted  population.  Therefore,  this  uncontrolled  feasibility 
study aimed to evaluate whether it is feasible to deliver inter-
net-delivered guided self-help ACT within primary and second-
ary care services in the UK, particularly in terms of recruitment 
and  treatment  completion,  and  whether  the  intervention  is 
acceptable to family carers of people with dementia.

Materials and methods

Trial design

This was a multi-site, single-arm feasibility study conducted in 
the UK (ISRCTN trial registration number: 18956412). Three sites, 
one primary care service (i.e. GP practice) and two secondary 
care services (i.e. NHS mental health trusts) were involved in 
participant recruitment and delivery of the intervention. Full 
ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  NHS  London-Queen 
Square Research Ethics Committee (20/LO/0025).

Participants

Recruitment took place between August 2020 and January 2021 
(i.e.  over  6  months).  Participants  were  recruited  via  clinician 
referral from three participating sites and self-referral from the 
community, including public advertisement in local newspapers 
and  advertisement  on  a  national  recruitment  website  (Join 
Dementia Research). The study advertisement was also shared 

with participants who had previously participated in other eth-
ically  approved  non-interventional  dementia  studies  at  the 
university and who had consented to be contacted about future 
studies.

The UK’s NICE guideline for managing anxiety and depres-
sion (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2011) 
recommends the use of a self-help approach for individuals with 
mild-to-moderate clinical presentations. Thus, participants pre-
senting with mild-to-moderate anxiety or depressive symptoms 
were recruited. Eligible participants were: (a) aged 18 and over, 
(b)  an  unpaid  carer  for  a  relative  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of 
dementia, (c) identifying as a primary carer in their family and 
(d)  presenting  with  mild-to-moderate  anxiety  or  depressive 
symptoms as indicated by the score of 6–15 on the Generalised 
Anxiety Disorder-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) or 6–15 on the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (Kroenke et al., 2001).

Participants were excluded if they were currently (a) receiv-
ing psychological treatment, (b) experiencing current difficul-
ties  with  a  severe  and  poorly  controlled  psychiatric  disorder 
(e.g.  schizophrenia)  or  other  conditions  expected  to  impair 
treatment engagement, such as self-reported cognitive impair-
ment or (c) without access to the Internet.

Interventions

Online programme iACT4CARERS
Initially,  the  development  of  the  online  programme  was  dis-
cussed  with  four  public  members  (family  carers).  They  sug-
gested combining some peer support group sessions with the 
online  programme  and  allowing  carers  to  access  the  pro-
gramme from any device including smartphones for improved 
accessibility. These suggestions were reflected in the develop-
ment phase. The structure and content of internet-delivered, 
guided, self-help ACT, which was adapted for family carers of 
people with dementia, were then decided based on the con-
sensus among ACT experts in the research team and the written 
protocol was produced. An administrative staff member with 
no  knowledge  of  any  form  of  psychotherapy  including  ACT 
reviewed  the  protocol  to  ensure  the  terms  and  descriptions 
used were clear for the public. The prototype of the online pro-
gramme was piloted by two public members (family carers) to 
ensure  its  relevance  and  the  user-friendliness  of  the  online 
platform.

The final version of the online programme consisted of eight 
sessions (see Table 1 of Supplemental Material for the detailed 
description of each session). Each subsequent session was made 
available  to  participants  1  week  after  the  completion  of  the 
previous session, and participants were encouraged to com-
plete the next session within the week it was made available. 
Participants were informed that access to the online programme 
would cease after 12 weeks.

Each online session had three sections: self-learning, reflec-
tion and home practice. In the self-learning section, interactive 
exercises to illustrate ACT skills were presented using multiple 
modes: video, audio and text. The reflection section encouraged 
participants to reflect on what was helpful in the session and 
leave questions for the online therapist if anything was unclear. 
Therapists provided individually tailored feedback to normalise 
difficult thoughts and emotions participants were experiencing 
and encourage them to practice ACT skills they found helpful. 
Therapists were directed to provide text-based feedback using 
the  therapist  portal  of  the  online  programme  within  3  days,

where possible, but no later than 7 days (i.e. before the next 
session was made available). In the home practice section, par-
ticipants were encouraged to identify a small step they could 
take that still reflected their value and practise ACT skills offline 
between online sessions.

Optional peer support group
Participants were given the option to join three-peer support 
group sessions via video call alongside the online programme. 
Following  the  screening  session,  eligible  participants  were 
asked  if  they  wished  to  sign  up  for  the  peer  support  group 
option. If three or more participants signed up for this option 
within 3 weeks from the date of the screening session, then peer 
support groups were organised by one of the therapists. If not, 
participants were asked to start the online programme without 
this option, and they were informed that they would be invited 
if  the  option  became  available  before  they  completed  the 
online programme. The aim of peer support groups was to meet 
other participants and encourage each other in completing the 
online programme. A trial therapist facilitated group sessions, 
but there were no specific, planned, therapeutic elements to 
peer support groups and sessions were participant-led.

Therapists
Therapists  did  not  hold  any  formal  qualification  in  Clinical 
Psychology or CBT (e.g. assistant psychologist, social prescribing 
link worker). Three of nine therapists had previously attended 
training sessions on ACT (e.g. 2-day workshop). All therapists 
attended a 2-day training on ACT and online feedback provision 
for the current study. They were also invited to attend monthly 
drop-in group supervision sessions led by the Chief Investigator 
each month via video call during the trial. One allocated partic-
ipant was randomly selected for each therapist, and the online 
feedback provided to them by their therapist across eight online 
sessions was reviewed by two independent ACT experts. The 
same two raters completed a checklist designed for this study 
to  evaluate  intervention  fidelity  for  each  therapist. The  total 
scores  of  three  sub-categories  of  the  checklist  (i.e.  feedback 
consistent with/inconsistent with ACT principles, general ther-
apist competence) were averaged between raters to produce 
an overall score for each category.

Procedure

Participants were asked to provide written consent via post or 
electronically before attending the screening session. Due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, all the screening sessions were con-
ducted  remotely  via  video  call  or  telephone  by  the  assessor 
(research assistant independent from the intervention delivery). 
Participants were given the opportunity to complete question-
naires via post or an online survey platform. Participants who 
met the eligibility criteria were immediately invited to access 
the online intervention.

At  the  end  of  the  intervention  phase,  participants  were 
invited to complete the follow-up questionnaires via post or an 
online  survey  platform.  All  participants  were  also  invited  to 
attend an individual, telephone, semi-structured interview con-
ducted by the assessor to share their experiences and provide 
feedback on online ACT. All therapists were also invited to an 
individual, semi-structured interview to provide their views on 

implementation.  Qualitative  findings  on  acceptability  of  the 
intervention and implementation will be reported elsewhere.

Feasibility and acceptability outcomes

Primary outcomes
The following two pre-defined indicators of success needed to 
be met in order for progression to a full-scale effectiveness trial 
to  be  deemed  feasible:  successful  uptake  (recruitment  of  30 
participants over 6 months) and initial engagement (≥70% com-
pleting  at  least  two  online  sessions).  These  indicators  were 
developed based on the consensus between experienced tri-
alists  in  the  research  team  and  were  agreed  with  the  funder 
before the conduct of the feasibility trial.

Secondary outcomes
The following data were also examined to inform the design of 
a full-scale effectiveness trial.

Recruitment, eligibility and attrition. The number of referrals, 
reasons for refusal, numbers ineligible, reasons for ineligibility 
and numbers lost to follow-up.

Resulting  sample  characteristics.  Descriptive  demographic 
data  for  all  participants  who  attended  the  screening  session 
and those eligible invited to the intervention phase.

Treatment completion and acceptability. The number of ses-
sions completed in the 12-week intervention phase, reasons for 
withdrawal from the intervention and the uptake rate of the 
peer support group option.

Therapist feasibility and acceptability. The time gap between 
the participant leaving a comment and their therapist providing 
a response, the length of time required for therapists to write 
each response and intervention fidelity ratings.

Clinical outcomes

The clinical outcome measures were included at both screening 
and follow-up to examine the feasibility of clinical outcomes 
data  collection.  Follow-up  data  were  collected  immediately 
post-intervention for completers and at the end of the inter-
vention phase for those who were not able to complete all eight 
sessions in 12 weeks. The secondary clinical outcome measures 
were: Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7; Spitzer et al., 
2006), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9; Kroenke et al., 2001), 
Revised  Centre  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale 
(CESD-R;  Eaton  et  al.,  2004),  Acceptance  and  Action 
Questionnaire-II  (AAQ-II;  Bond  et  al.,  2011),  Cognitive  Fusion 
Questionnaire  (CFQ;  Gillanders  et  al.,  2014)  and  Experiential 
Avoidance  in  Caregiving  Questionnaire  (EACQ;  Losada  et  al., 
2014). The frequency of problematic behaviours subscale of the 
Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC; Teri 
et al., 1992) was also used at the screening to characterise the 
care recipient. The detailed descriptions of each scale and data 
on  its  psychometric  properties  are  provided  in  Table  2  of 
Supplemental Material.

Sample size

A  sample  size  of  30  is  consistent  with  recommendations  for 
sample sizes of 24–35 participants for pilot and feasibility stud-
ies when estimating the standard deviation for a continuous 
outcome (Julious, 2005; Teare et al., 2014; Whitehead et al., 2016).

Statistical methods

The aim of a feasibility study is not to assess the efficacy of the 
intervention  and  thus  no  formal  analysis  was  conducted,  as 
recommended for pilot or feasibility studies (Lancaster et al., 
2004; Thabane et al., 2010). Categorical measures were sum-
marised using frequencies and percentages. Continuous mea-
sures were summarised using means and standard deviations 
(SD).  However,  to  look  for  signals  of  effectiveness,  Reliable 
Change Index (RCI) examined whether the observed change in 
key secondary clinical outcomes (i.e. GAD7 and PHQ9 used for 
screening) at the individual level were greater than could be 
explained by errors of measurement. RCIs were thus calculated 
for  each  participant  by  dividing  the  difference  of  the  scores 
before and after the intervention by the standard error of mea-
surement (Jacobson & Truax, 1991); RCI values greater than ± 
1.96 indicate reliable improvement or reliable deterioration. The 
standard error of measurement for each scale was computed 
using SD and Cronbach’s alpha reported in the studies providing 
norms for primary care patients (Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et 
al., 2006). The effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were also calculated for 
each clinical outcome using cases for which both pre-and post-
data were available. These were calculated by subtracting the 
pre-group mean from the post-group mean and divided by the 
SD at pre (Durlak, 2009).

Results

Primary outcomes

of a total of 474 outcome data at the screening) were missing 
across  all  clinical  outcome  measures. The  majority  of  partici-
pants  were  female  with  at  least  secondary  education  com-
pleted. More than half of the participants were in their 60s–70s 
and retired, lived with the person with dementia, provided care 
for more than 41 h per week and had not received any form of 
psychological  therapy  in  the  past.  Of  the  33  participants 
enrolled  in  the  intervention,  22  had  both  mild-to-moderate 
anxiety and depression. The remaining participants only had 
one condition (anxiety alone n = 5; depression alone n = 6).

Participant feasibility and acceptability
Of the 33 participants, 29 participants (70%) completed more 
than 7 sessions and 19 (58%) completed all 8 sessions. The aver-
age number of sessions completed during the 12-week inter-
vention  phase  was  6.24  (SD  =  2.55).  Ten  participants  (30%) 
signed up for the peer support group option. Of these signed 
up, six attended all three-peer support group sessions and two 
did not attend any.

Nine  participants  (27%)  withdrew  from  the  intervention 
before the end of the 12-week intervention phase (Figure 1). 
The reasons for early withdrawal were: decline in the person 
with dementia’s physical health (n = 1), decline in own physical 
health (n = 2), changes in caring responsibilities due to COVID-
19 (n = 3), death of the care recipient (n = 1) and death of a close 
family member (n = 1). One person did not provide a reason.

Thirty-three eligible participants (110% of the target sample) 
were recruited over 6 months and 30 participants (91%) com-
pleted two or more online sessions. Thus, pre-defined indicators 
of success were met.

Secondary outcomes

Recruitment, eligibility and attrition
The number of referrals, reasons for refusal, numbers ineligible, 
reasons for ineligibility and numbers lost to follow-up are pre-
sented in Figure 1. Of those 108 participants referred, 79 (73%) 
were  screened  and  33  out  of  those  79  screened  (42%)  were 
eligible. The final 33 participants enrolled in the intervention 
consisted of 25 participants (76%) who self-referred from the 
community  and  eight  participants  (24%)  who  were  referred 
from primary and secondary care services. Nine of the 33 par-
ticipants (27%) were lost to follow-up.

Resulting sample characteristics

Characteristics of participants are summarised in Table 1. As per 
Table 1, missing data were minimal, only five outcome data (out 

Therapist feasibility and acceptability
In total, 206 online sessions were completed by 33 participants. 
The time gap between the participant leaving a comment and 
their  therapist  providing  a  response  for  each  session  ranged 
from 0 to 24 days, with 96% of responses provided within 7 days. 
Significant delays mainly occurred during the Christmas holiday 
period.  On  average,  therapists  provided  online  feedback  for 
each  session  within  2.72 days  (SD = 3.21). The  length  of  time 
required for therapists to write each response ranged from 5 to 
120 min, with 93% of responses written in less than 30 min. On 
average,  therapists  spent  20.08 min  (SD = 16.61)  to  write  a 
response.

The results of treatment fidelity ratings are provided in Table 
3 of Supplemental Material. There was no variance in the scores 
of  ACT-inconsistent  feedback  and  general  therapist  compe-
tency categories, suggesting the use of ACT-inconsistent feed-
back  was  none  or  minimal  and  all  therapists  were  generally 
competent in providing supportive, well-structured feedback 
tailored to individuals. The scores of the ACT-consistent feed-
back  category  ranged  from  13  to  20  across  nine  therapists 
(M = 16.83; SD = 2.17; possible scale range = 4–20; high score 
means higher fidelity).

outcomes at follow-up and pre-post effect sizes. Table 3 pres-
ents  the  number  of  participants  who  demonstrated  reliable

symptoms at follow-up. Of those 20 participants who presented 
mild or moderate anxiety at screening, 8 (40%) showed a reli-
able improvement in scores on the GAD7 at follow-up. Of those 
19 participants who presented mild or moderate depression at 
screening,  5  (26%)  demonstrated  a  reliable  improvement  in 

scores on the PHQ9 at follow-up. A small number of participants 
(n = 2) showed a reliable deterioration on the PHQ9.

Discussion

The findings demonstrated that it is feasible to recruit partici-
pants and deliver internet-delivered self-help ACT, guided by 
novice therapists, within primary and secondary care services 
in  the  UK  and  the  intervention  appears  acceptable  to  family 
carers of people with dementia. The pre-defined indicators of 
success in terms of uptake (recruitment of 30 participants over 
6 months) and initial engagement (≥70% completing at least 
two online sessions) were successfully met.

Secondary outcomes further demonstrated that 108 referrals 
were received across three-study sites in just 6 months, 70% of 
participants completed seven or all sessions and none of the 
reasons for early withdrawal was related to the intervention. 
These figures further support that the proposed intervention 
was acceptable to family carers of people with dementia who 
were mainly in their 60s and 70s and were older than partici-
pants  mainly  targeted  in  previous  self-help  ACT  studies  (e.g. 
student populations) (Brown et al., 2016).

All study procedures were conducted completely remotely 
due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  however  missing  data  were 
minimal.  The  27%  attrition  rate  was  comparable  to  those 
reported in previous studies on in-person ACT for family carers 
of people with dementia (Losada et al., 2015; Marquez-Gonzalez 
et al., 2020). The current study provides valuable evidence sup-
porting the feasibility of remote delivery of both an ACT inter-
vention  and  a  trial  among  this  population.  Importantly,  this 
mode of delivery enabled us to reach out to carers isolated in 
the community. In this study, the majority of eligible partici-
pants (76%) had self-referred from the community, as opposed 
to  24%  of  participants  who  were  referred  from  primary  and 
secondary care services. This highlights that currently there is 
a great unmet need in the community, and a large proportion 
of carers do not have access to formal healthcare services to 
meet this support need. This may also suggest that family carers 
are more sensitive than healthcare professionals in identifying 
the need for support. Recent literature on carer support needs 
also recommends moving away from traditional, informal, pro-
fessionally led needs assessments and considering the use of 
carer-led  assessment  tools  that  reflect  the  person-centred 
approach (Ewing et al., 2015, 2016).

Although the study was not powered to examine effective-
ness, there was preliminary evidence of improvements in scores 
of anxiety and depression. These improvements were more evi-
dent for anxiety. This is clinically important, as the current evi-
dence suggests that the efficacy of conventional CBT on anxiety 
is limited for family carers of people with dementia (Hopkinson 
et al., 2019) and older people (Kishita & Laidlaw, 2017). There is 
also emerging evidence that in-person ACT can improve late-life 
treatment-resistant  generalised  anxiety  disorder  (Gould  et  al., 
2021),  and  thus  further  investigation  of  the  efficacy  of  inter-
net-delivered guided self-help ACT on carer anxiety in a full-scale 
trial  is  warranted.  Furthermore,  considering  the  proportion  of 
participants who did not present any symptoms at screening, 
future research should examine whether this intervention is ben-
eficial in not only treating but also preventing anxiety and depres-
sive symptoms in family carers of people with dementia.

Two participants demonstrated deterioration in depression. 
These participants had scored 6 and 7 on the PHQ9 at baseline

but  these  increased  to  10  and  12  at  follow-up.  Participant 
recruitment started after the first COVID-19 national lockdown 
ended, and the trial was completed during the second national 
lockdown; the impact of these external factors on deterioration 
cannot be ruled out as a control group was not included in the 
study. An examination of differential effects of internet-deliv-
ered guided self-help ACT on anxiety and depression including 
its long-term effects is required in a full-scale trial.

Findings also reveal that the workload burden on therapists 
was  not  excessive.  Novice  therapists  who  were  not  formally 
trained in clinical psychology or CBT but attended a 2-day train-
ing for the current study were able to provide immediate feed-
back to their participants, in less than 3 days on average, which 
adhered to ACT principles and required an average of 20 min 
of their time to write. The current average cost per recovered 
patient is £1043 for a low-intensity psychological treatment (e.g. 
guided self-help CBT, group CBT) in the East of England, and 
this increases to £2895 per recovered patient if a high-intensity 
psychological treatment is offered (e.g. 16 sessions of in-person 
CBT) (Radhakrishnan et al., 2013). An evaluation of the cost-ef-
fectiveness of internet-delivered guided self-help ACT in a full-
scale  trial  is  critical  to  further  investigate  whether  this 
intervention can save the cost of treatment while maintaining 
effective  outcomes.  Following  further  efficacy  testing,  and 
assuming  this  is  successful,  there  will  need  to  be  a  plan  and 
collaboration, possibly including implementation research, into 
the best way to roll out this technology in a cost-effective and 
sustainable way.

The uptake and attendance rates at the optional online peer 
support sessions were relatively low. Qualitative feedback from 
participants  highlighted  that  feelings  of  uncertainty  about 
other group attendees and inflexible dates and times due to 
the availability of therapists became barriers for them to sign 
up for groups. Although previous studies have demonstrated 
that peer support groups can be delivered either online or face-
to-face and may have potential benefit to carers (Carter et al., 
2020), this part of the programme may need to be reconsidered 
in the future trial.

There  were  some  methodological  limitations.  Participant 
recruitment took place in three countries in the East of England. 
The population of the county that had the largest number of 
recruits is more than 90% White British, thus, the ethnic diversity 
of the sample was limited. This was a single-arm feasibility study, 
and preliminary evidence of improvements in outcomes (which 
was not the aim of the study) is not conclusive and should be 
interpreted  with  caution.  The  single-arm  design  also  might 
overestimate recruitment and retention in an RCT. Due to the 
lack of follow-up beyond post-intervention, whether treatment 
gains are maintained following completion is unknown. Finally, 
due to the nature of the role of therapists (i.e. providing brief 
online feedback and not delivering ACT itself ), it was not pos-
sible to use a standardised ACT fidelity measure. Therefore, a 
non-validated checklist was used.

Conclusion

This study provided evidence for the feasibility and acceptability 
of internet-delivered guided self-help ACT with family carers of 
people with dementia and the methods of testing it. Although 
there were some signs of improvement in anxiety and depres-
sion, this was a single-arm underpowered feasibility study and 
thus this should be interpreted with caution. A full-scale trial

with a diverse sample of carers to assess the clinical- and cost-ef-
fectiveness of the intervention including its long-term effects
