Background: Research shows that many mental disorders begin in childhood but 
are sometimes not diagnosed until later years. School-age children spend much 
of their time in schools and have daily interactions with school teachers.

Aim: Examine school teachers’ experiences of mental disorders in school going 
children and adolescents and their associated mental health training needs.

Method  and  sample:  A  descriptive  cross-sectional  study  was  carried  out  with 
teachers in Infant-Primary and Secondary Education-Baccalaureate schools.

Results: A convenience sample of 685 teachers responded to the online survey. 
Participants  worked  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas  and  in  Infant-Primary  and 
Secondary Education-Baccalaureate schools. Over half of participants reported 
classroom  experiences  of  learner  mental  disorders  such  as  ADHD,  anxiety, 
conduct  disorders  or  autism.  Most  participants  acknowledged  a  training  need, 
both in recognition of symptoms of mental disorders and in care resources and 
processes. However, 80% of respondents reported having not received any training 
in this regard. Participant preferences for training included face-to-face or hybrid 
–  combined  online  learning.  Participants  also  considered  the  management  of 
their own mental health to be deficient, therefore any training should incorporate 
personal mental health awareness and self-help strategies.

Conclusion: In Aragón (Spain), teachers of children and adolescents with mental 
disorders,  recognize  a  need  for  training  in  the  identification  of  symptoms  and 
other  aspects  of  mental  healthcare,  such  as  availability  and  access  to  services. 
Protocols  for  early  identification  and  referral  would  promote  mentally  healthy 
school  environments  and  reduce  stigma  which  could  be  a  barrier  to  timely 
intervention. In addition, any training should include mental health self-care for 
teachers.

Introduction

The  prevalence  of  mental  disorders  in  Spanish  children  and 
adolescents is between 10–20% (1). Mental disorders in children and 
adolescents can have an adverse impact on learning at school, as well 
as  other  areas  of  life  and  childhood  development.  While  the  first 
manifestations of mental disorders may occur at an early age they can 
continue and have further impact in adulthood (2).

Research  in  the  European  Union  suggests  that  50%  of  mental 
disorders in adults begin before the age of 15 and 75% before the age 
of 18 (3). Furthermore, 10% of students between the ages of 6 and 11 
have mental disorders, which would mean that there are an average of 
2–3  children  with  some  degree  of  mental  health  pathology  in  all 
elementary classes (3). Therefore, the school environment is an ideal 
space for early identification and intervention when mental disorders 
may become apparent (4).

With such high prevalence, Sparling et al. (5) point out that 
low-cost community mental health interventions, which seek to 
improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents, are 
a key point in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
Jorm  et  al.  (6)  have  already  discussed  programs  to  increase 
knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders and how these can 
help to recognize, manage or prevent them. However, a systematic 
review  of  mental  health  literacy  programs  for  school  teachers 
found their knowledge and confidence of helping children with 
mental disorders is usually low (7).

On the other hand, physical health disorders in childhood and 
adolescence are easily detected within school environments. Awareness-
raising activities on the importance of physical health are often carried 
out in schools and may be part of school curriculums. However, despite 
the prevalence of mental disorders in school settings, the latter is not 
usually addressed in the school setting with the same frequency (8).

Irarrázaval et al. (9) state that interventions in settings such as 
schools  require  a  multi-sectorial  approach  involving  medicine, 
education, psychology, social work and public health, but go on to 
suggest  that  involvement  of  the  local  community  as  well  is 
important. The involvement of charities and mental health peer 
support groups would provide an opportunity to have an ecological 
approach  to  early  identification  and  intervention  for  the  most 
vulnerable children whose mental health may be impacted by the 
social determinants of mental health such as exposure to violence, 
social deprivation and poverty.

For  Wallander  et  al.  (10),  preventive  school  interventions  can 
improve mental disorders in childhood and adolescence, although 
they  have  a  limited  impact  in  reducing  mental  illness.  Therefore, 
school interventions should be implemented as a complement and not 
as a substitute for other services or care interventions. In addition, 
there is not enough evidence on which type of training programs are 
best suited to facilitate detection or what is the best intervention for 
learner mental disorders at school, but training in mental health for 
teachers would be an essential component of any program (11).

School  teachers  are  also  very  interested  in  improving  their 
knowledge in the early detection and prevention of mental disorders, as 
well as carrying out collaborative work with mental health professionals 
and receiving guidance from health care settings (12). Education and 
training, coupled with closer working with community mental health 
services, primary care and the voluntary sector would enable school 
teachers  to  recognize  and  target  interventions  and  supports.  For 

example, targeted interventions or supports could be tailored to key 
school milestones, e.g., starting school, exam times or year changes (13).
Freţian  et  al.  (14)  point  out  that  while  educational 
interventions  directed  at  students  improve  their  knowledge  of 
mental health, they do not have the desired success on the effects 
of  stigma  or  social  isolation  on  those  who  experience  mental 
disorders.  A  randomised  control  trial  by  Milin  et  al.  (15) 
concerning  a  mental  health  literacy  program  for  Canadian 
secondary school students, confirmed its applicability by teachers 
with positive effects on knowledge and stigma in mental health. 
Research shows that such literacy programs can encourage young 
people to self-seek mental health support (16, 17), and also allow 
teachers  to  identify  potential  mental  illnesses  early  in  their 
students (18).

On the other hand, adequate training of teachers in identifying 
symptoms of mental disorders makes them appear more competent 
in  this  area,  which  results  in  better  interventions  for  those 
affected (19).

This  study  investigates  the  classroom  experience  of  teachers 
regarding mental disorders in their students and their training needs 
for early detection and intervention.

Study methodology

This  is  a  quantitative  descriptive  study  of  primary  and 
secondary school teachers’ knowledge and experiences of mental 
disorders in child and adolescent students. Training needs in this 
area  were  also  explored  as  well  as  attitudes  towards  training  in 
mental health.

Survey development

A survey was created to be completed online, replicating the 
study  by  Nash  and  Granada  (20)  in  which  similar  items  were 
explored in primary school teachers in the Republic of Ireland. 
This  gave  the  survey  content  and  face  validity  for  use  in  the 
similar  context  of  the  Autonomous  Community  of  Aragon 
(Spain).  In  the  current  study,  the  sample  was  extended  to 
secondary school teachers, to capture experiences with mental 
disorders which may appear between the end of childhood and 
adolescence.  The  questionnaire  inquired  about  experiences  of 
mental disorders in the classroom, knowledge of symptoms and 
any perceived training needs in the area of mental disorders in 
school students.

Sample and access

School  teachers  from  public  or  subsidized  centres  teaching 
from infant and primary to secondary and baccalaureate (student 
age between 3 to 18 years old) in Aragon, Spain. The directors of 
the  schools  were  informed,  with  the  collaboration  of  the 
Department of Education, Culture and Sports of the Government 
of Aragon, and they distributed study information via email to all 
the members of the faculty of said schools. The email informed 
potential participants about the study, its objectives and contained

Data analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to analyse sample characteristics 
and types of mental disorders experienced in the classroom. Frequency 
tables were used to analyse the 5-point Likert scale questions.

Ethical considerations and consent

Institutional ethical approval was granted for this study by the 
School  of  Nursing  and  Midwifery  Research  Ethics  Committee  at 
Trinity  College  Dublin.  Survey  results  were  anonymous  and 
confidential,  and  all  data  has  been  processed  in  accordance  with 
current  legislation.  Opening  the  link  to  the  survey  led  potential 
participants to an information leaflet explaining the study’s aim and 
method and making it clear that they could withdraw from it at any 
time up until submission of responses. If they decided to participate, 
the next step was for them to tick a consent box, following which they 
could start completing the survey.

Sample characteristics

There are 14,170 school teachers in Aragon eligible to participate 
in this study. The sample of 685 is acceptable for a confidence level of 
95% and a margin of error of 5%. Teachers working in rural areas, in 
public schools responded at higher rates, regardless of the years of 
experience as teachers. The distribution of the sample by gender is 
similar to that shown by the National Institute of Statistics in Spain 
(67.9% of women teachers in primary, secondary and high school and 
97.7% in infant education).

Self-assessed knowledge of symptoms of 
mental disorders and mental health care 
services

Types of mental disorders encountered by 
respondents

Mental disorders with high frequencies reported by respondents 
were  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  Anxiety, 
conduct  disorders  and  Autism  Spectrum  Disorders  (ASD),  which 
exceeded  50%  of  the  sample.  Less  frequently  reported  mental 
disorders,  but  not  insignificant  illnesses,  include  eating  disorders, 
depression, oppositional defiant disorder, self-harm, substance abuse, 
and Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD), all with a frequency 
greater than 20% (Figure 1).

Serious  mental  disorders  (such  as  schizophrenia  and  bipolar 
disorder) and suicidal ideation appear less frequently, but it should 
be remembered that this is the teachers’ perception of the disorder and 
not the actual prevalence of these disorders in schoolchildren.

The participants valued their knowledge of symptoms related to 
mental disorders, as well as about different issues related to mental 
health care and assistance. To facilitate the assessment of mean and 
standard deviation, values from 1 to 5 were assigned to the items on 
the  Likert-type  scale  from  “Very  bad”  to  “Very  good.”  Frequency 
Tables 2, 3 show the responses.

The knowledge that school teachers self-report as very poor or 
poor  more  frequently  coincides  with  those  disorders  that  they 
identified as less prevalent in their students (attachment disorders, 
suicidal ideation, severe mental illness and personality disorders, self-
harm and post-traumatic stress). Knowledge was reported as better 
for  other  disorders  such  as  depression,  ADHD,  anxiety,  conduct 
disorders, eating disorders, which are more frequently encountered.
Regarding  matters  related  to  mental  health  services  and  care, 
participants  reported  poor,  or  very  poor,  knowledge  in  areas  such  as

medications  used  in  treating  mental  disorders,  writing  protocols  or 
guidelines for mental disorders in schools and how to talk to parents or 
guardians about mental disorders. Participants reported better knowledge 
of types of professionals who work in child and adolescent mental health 
and the work that child and adolescent mental health professionals perform.
The previous tables show participants self-reporting high frequencies 
of low knowledge in many areas, with the exception of participants’ self-
reported knowledge about ADHD and ASD. Furthermore, participants’ 
responses to the category regarding mental health self-care – “how to 
take care of my own mental health” – indicate a lack knowledge in this 
regard also. This is something that will need to be borne in mind when 
developing any mental health care training programs.

Curiously, participants requested more training in areas in which 

they reported being more knowledgeable and experienced in.

It is possible that this is the case because participants perceive 
these  disorders  (ADHD,  anxiety,  conduct  disorders,  eating 
disorders,  and  depression),  as  the  most  prevalent  among  their 
students  and  so  require  more  knowledge  of  them.  However, 
participants did not report a need to increase their knowledge in 
areas  such  as  sleep  disorders,  Asperger  syndrome,  attachment 
disorders,  post-traumatic  stress,  personality  disorders,  bipolar 
disorders,  schizophrenia  and  suicidal  ideation,  items  that  were 
indicated by less than 15% of the participants (Figures 2, 3).

Self-reported training needs on symptoms 
of mental disorders and mental health care 
and services

Respondents were asked to select those areas (with the possibility 
of multiple answers) in which they would like to receive training in 
relation  to  the  symptoms  of  mental  disorders  which  were  already 
explored in Tables 2, 3.

Attitudes towards mental health issues 
related to their professional role

Teachers were asked about their attitude towards various mental 
health issues related to their professional role. Using a Likert-type 
scale participants were asked to record their level of agreement or 
disagreement (on a five-point graduation from strongly disagree – 
strongly  agree)  to  predetermined  areas.  Table  4  summarizes 
the responses.

Participants display very positive attitudes toward any potential 
role they may have in relation to helping with mental disorders in 
school  settings.  There  was  a  high  level  of  agreement  that  helping 
children and adolescents with mental disorders was part of their role 
and also an acknowledgment of their need for training in relation to 
mental disorders in children and adolescents of school age. This makes 
the situation propitious for providing the required training and for the 
structured  implementation  of  early  detection  programs  and 
collaboration with mental health care services (Figures 4, 5).

Discussion

This study explored the mental health care knowledge and 
training needs of primary and secondary teachers in relation to 

mental disorders in the classroom including, symptoms and their 
early detection, knowledge of mental health services and mental 
health  professionals  and  aspects  of  mental  health  care  or 
interventions. The research took place in Aragon, Spain. This will 
go on to inform the design of training programs and strategies to 
implement these in school settings. However, a meta-analysis by 
Yamaguchi  et  al.  (11)  suggests  inconclusive  results  on  the  real 
impact  of  such  mental  health  training  programs  for  school 
teachers  on  the  mental  health  of  students.  This  included 
educational  programs  in  the  areas  of  knowledge  of  mental 
disorders,  attitude  towards  stigma,  confidence  to  help  and 
possible interventions. Yet, Wang (21) reaffirms the importance 
of supporting teacher training in areas related to mental disorders 
due  to  its  impact  on  the  development  of  children  in  the 
school setting.

identifying  and  managing  mental  disorders  in  the  classroom, 
primarily due to lack of training, but also, if school teachers have 
received training, how to put what was learned into practice. For this 
reason, joint training with mental health service providers, including 
the voluntary sector, would increase school teachers’ knowledge and 
confidence and would allow them to identify first symptoms early and 
enable them to facilitate the most appropriate onward referral.

Another  approach  to  this  issue  would  be  more  integration  of 
mental health awareness training into the undergraduate curriculum 
of  school  teachers,  which  has  shown  good  results  in  terms  of 
increasing their knowledge (16, 17). As teachers, participants in this 
study already had a university degree, but 80% of them reported not 
having  received  specific  training  in  mental  health  during  their 
university study.

FIGURE 5
Perceived barriers to training in mental health reported by participants.

The current study has obtained similar results to a study in the 
Republic of Ireland by Nash and Granada (20). Although their study 
had a smaller sample and was located in the area of primary school 
education,  Nash  and  Granada  identified  similar  school  teacher 
experiences in terms of identifying mental disorders in the classroom, 
and similar prevalence in areas such as ADHD, anxiety, ASD, conduct 
disorders  and  depression.  Differences  are  noted  in  the  area  of 
substance abuse disorders because the Irish sample is from a primary 
school cohort where, in such a young population, this issue may not 
yet be manifested. Global epidemiological data shows that up to 20% 
of children and adolescents suffer from a disabling mental disorder, 
among  which  suicide  is  the  third  leading  cause  of  death  among 
adolescents and that up to 50% of all adult mental health disorders 
have their onset in adolescence (23). More specifically, Danielson et al. 
(24) found childhood mental disorders in one in six children, the most 
prevalent being anxiety disorders (7.9–11.2%), oppositional defiant 
disorder (5.7–17.3%) and ADHD (5.1–9.4%).

Participants in this study were clearly in favour of hybrid learning 
– a mix of in person and online methodologies. However, a study by 
Hsu et al. (25) which explored the relevance of mental health training 
for preschool teachers with online methodologies, or in social media 
networks, concluded that, although it is a methodology appreciated 
by  teachers, 
it  should  be  developed  with  caution  because 
multidimensional communicative opportunities could not help school 
teachers find warm and friendly emotional support to promote their 
mental well-being. This would suggest training in mental health self-
care be facilitated in-person.

A  systematic  review  by  Fenwick-Smith  et  al.  (26)  provides 
evidence  that  mental  health  promotion  programs  that  focus  on 

resilience and coping skills have positive impacts on the students’ 
ability to manage daily stressors. These programs can involve weekly 
class sessions delivered by the teachers themselves and aim to both 
increase  knowledge  about  mental  health  and  its  effects  but  also 
increase  awareness  of  mental  health  resources  and  supports.  This 
requires teachers involved in school-based programs to have adequate 
training, especially with programs which prioritise early years, which 
have been shown to be most effective. In this sense, In this sense, Ford 
et al. (27) report that school-level variables, variables such as school 
environment and the quality and character of school life, are factors 
that promote good mental health. Therefore, there exists the potential 
to develop school-based indicators of positive mental health which 
would serve to identify schools that need resources to support the 
mental health of their students, by improving the school environment.
Of the teachers surveyed, almost 40% state that they have little or 
very little knowledge of mental health self-care. This is an important 
finding  as  the  mental  health  of  teachers  can  influence,  and 
be influenced, by the mental wellbeing of their students. For example, 
research by Harding et al. (28) on the association of well-being or 
depression  in  teachers  and  their  students  found  better  teacher 
wellbeing  was  associated  with  better  student  wellbeing  and  lower 
student  distress,  whereas  higher  levels  of  teacher  depression  were 
associated with poorer student wellbeing. Poon et al. (29) suggest that 
teachers’ stress and sleep problems had negative repercussions on the 
academic motivation and in-class satisfaction of students. This shows 
the need to monitor the self-care of teachers’ own mental health when 
designing training strategies for classroom management of mental 
disorders. In addition, as Casañas et al. (30) conclude, school based 
mental  health  programs  must  then  be  aligned  with  the  entire

such as ignorance, fear, or stigma about mental illness.

important time for the educational, social and emotional development 
of children and adolescents. We should endeavour to make them a 
mentally healthy time as well.

Limitations

The use of a convenience sample may represent a sampling bias, 
in  which  only  those  who  are  most  interested  in  the  subject  area 
responded to the survey. The majority of participants were from public 
schools where there may be a disproportionate level of existing mental 
disorders. Furthermore, biases typical of anonymous surveys, such as 
the acquiescence bias (selecting possible options mechanically without 
much  thought)  and  the  social  desirability  bias  (giving  socially 
expected answers and not one’s honest opinion) cannot be ruled out. 
The survey is not validated, it is an online survey was adapted from 
the one used by Nash and Granada (20) in the Republic of Ireland. It 
is  a  questionnaire  designed  ad  hoc  to  obtain  the  information  of 
the study.

Conclusion

This study explored the mental health knowledge and experiences 
of school teachers in Aragon, Spain. The results of this study confirm 
that  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  training  in  the  area  of  mental 
healthcare. Training in areas such as symptom recognition would 
promote early identification of mental disorders (particularly relating 
to serious mental illness), which in turn would lead to rapid referral 
to appropriate mental health services. Participants’ preferred mode 
of  training  was  hybrid  learning  –  a  mix  of  in  person  and 
online classes.

For programs to be sustainable, joint training, between mental 
health professionals, service providers and teachers, would enable the 
development of school protocols and referral pathways for mental 
disorders. Involving parents / guardians and young people in this 
process would show a commitment to co-production and inclusive 
learner centred mental healthcare.

Dealing  with  mental  health  issues  in  vulnerable  groups,  like 
children and adolescents, can be anxiety provoking, therefore, any 
training should also include aspects of mental health self-care for 
teachers, since they consider this an issue that can be improved. The 
school environment should be a protective place for the mental health 
of students, but also for that of teachers. The “school years” are an
