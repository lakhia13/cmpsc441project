Abstract: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral condition found in 
5-10% of school-age children and in 2-5% of adults. Stimulants affecting the dopaminergic, nora-
drenergic and/or serotonergic systems are commonly used for treatment in children and adults, in-
cluding  women  of  childbearing  age.  The  data  on  the  effects  of  stimulants  (methylphenidate  and 
amphetamines) in pregnancy are generally reassuring, but methylphenidate might slightly increase 
the rate of cardiac malformations and of spontaneous abortions, while amphetamines might slightly 
increase the risk for premature birth, low birth weight and other pregnancy complications. Bupropi-
on, a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, when used as an antidepressant, appears to 
be safe in pregnancy. The data on the use of atomoxetine, guanfacine and clonidine in pregnancy 
are scarce. Importantly, there are practically no data on the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of 
most of these drugs. The published data on the development of children born to methamphetamine-
abusing women may be misleading since these women generally use other drugs, including alcohol, 
and  the  home  environment  where  the  child  is  raised  may  not  be  optimal.  The  treating  physician 
should  judge  the  need  for  treatment  during  pregnancy  in  relation  to  the  severity  of  the  clinical 
symptoms.  If  needed,  methylphenidate  is  preferred  over  amphetamines  because  breast  feeding  is 
possible. If one uses non-stimulant medications, bupropion seems to be the preferred drug.

1. INTRODUCTION 

  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD)  is  a 
common  neurobehavioral  disorder  characterized  by  inatten-
tion, poor self-control, disorganization, impulsivity and often 
motor  over-activity  and  restlessness.  Symptoms  typically 
appear at early school age but may be first manifested up to 
12 years of age [1-6]. Common comorbid states are learning 
difficulties  and  underachievement  as  well  as  difficulties  in 
interpersonal  relations  and  a  variety  of  behavioral  and  psy-
chiatric conditions. About half of these children will contin-
ue  to  have  the  symptoms  in  adulthood  [2-6].  Adults  with 
ADHD, if untreated, are often unable to maximize their po-
tential.  They  might  experience  difficulties  at  work  and  un-
employment,  social  dysfunction,  increased  risk  of  antisocial 
behavior  and  an  increased  tendency  towards  substance 
abuse,  problems  to  obey  laws  and  an  increased  rate  of  car 
and  other  accidents  [3-8].  The  economic  burden  of  ADHD, 
especially  if  untreated,  is  very  high  [9,  10].  Hence,  optimal 
pharmacologic  treatment  at  adolescence  and  adulthood  is

generally  advised  (4-6),  increasing  the  number  of  women 
with  ADHD  that  receive  treatment  during  childbearing  age 
and specifically pregnancy. 

  Of  special  importance  is  the  fact  that  adolescents  and 
young  adults  with  ADHD  have  an  increased  tendency  to-
wards  substance  abuse,  and  pharmacologic  treatment  of 
ADHD  may  reduce  that  tendency  [4].  This  association  of 
ADHD  and  substance  abuse  was  the  trigger  for  a  recently 
published  consensus  paper  [3]  to  screen  adolescents  in  sub-
stance  abuse  clinics  for  ADHD  and  use  long-acting  stimu-
lants  for  their  continuous  treatment,  further  increasing  the 
use of ADHD medications by adults. 

  The rate of ADHD among school-age children is 5-10%, 
and  among  adults,  it  is  2-5%  [10-12].  The  DSM  5  [1]  pro-
posed specific clinical diagnostic criteria based on behavioral 
findings. These and other diagnostic criteria are increasingly 
used  for  the  diagnosis  of  ADHD  in  adults  [4-6].  There  are 
also specific questionnaires for children and for adults. Vari-
ous  computerized  attentional  performance  tests  (CPTs) 
might  also  help  in  the  diagnosis,  but  they  are  only  adjunct 
means to the clinical diagnosis. With the improvement of the 
diagnostic means, suggestions for pharmacological treatment

in  adults  with  ADHD  became  more  common  [3-6],  further 
increasing the number of women treated during childbearing 
age. 

  Treatment,  in  both  children  and  adults,  is  primarily 
pharmacological;  various  stimulants  being  the  first-line 
treatment, or non-stimulant drugs given to those that do not 
respond well or do not tolerate stimulants [4-6, 13-15]. The-
se  various  drugs  are  as  follows:  Stimulants:  Methylpheni-
date,  dexmethylphenidate,  amphetamine  combinations:  dex-
troamphetamine  and  lidexamfetamine.  Non-stimulant  drugs 
include  atomoxetine  (norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor), 
clonidine  (alpha2  norepinephrine  agonist)  and  guanfacine 
(alpha  2  norepinephrine  agonist).  Rarely,  especially  with 
depression  as  a  comorbid  state,  antidepressants  (mainly  bu-
propion) are effective treatments. 

  Generally,  all  drugs  used  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD 
cross  the  placenta,  hence  the  developing  embryo  and  fetus 
are exposed to the drugs if taken by the mother during preg-
nancy.  Despite  the  significant  increase  in  the  use  of  ADHD 
medications by pregnant women [11, 12], the data available 
on  the  possible  effects  of  these  drugs  during  pregnancy  are 
still inadequate [17, 18]. 

Stimulants increase the synaptic dopamine concentrations 
while  other  drugs  increase  the  synaptic  concentrations  of 
norepinephrine  (i.e.,  atomoxetine)  or  serotonin  (tricyclic 
antidepressants  -  TCAs)  or  exert  the  beneficial  effects  by 
interference with alpha-adrenergic substances [16-18]. 

  One  of  the  problems  in  the  assessment  of  the  possible 
effects  of  stimulants  in  pregnancy  is  the  fact  that  some  of 
these  drugs  are  used  recreationally  and,  as  such,  may  also 
cause  addiction.  Moreover,  the  data  accumulated  are,  to  a 
large extent, obtained from addicted mothers or from moth-
ers using occasionally high doses. This is especially relevant 
to our data on the effects of amphetamines and non-stimulant 
drugs. 

In view of the increased number of women of childbear-
ing age diagnosed with ADHD, there is a need to bring to the 
attention  of  the  medical  community  the  possible  effects  of 
drugs  used  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD  on  the  developing 
embryo  and  fetus.  Special  emphasis  is  given  to  stimulants 
that are generally preferred over non-stimulant drugs. Table 1 
summarizes the data related to the effects of these drugs on 
the embryo/fetus, course of pregnancy and development. 

2. METHODS 

  We  searched  the  English  literature  related  to  pharmaco-
logical  treatment  of  ADHD  in  pregnancy  in  PubMed  and 
EMBASE.  Since  most  of  the  non-stimulant  drugs  used  for 
the  treatment  of  ADHD  are  used  for  other  indications  (i.e., 
their use as anti-hypertensives, for mood disorders, or for the 
cessation  of  smoking),  we  searched  the  specific  literature 
related  to  the  outcome  of  pregnancy  following  the  use  of 
these  specific  drugs  for  the  different  clinical  indications  us-
ing the name of the specific drug, pregnancy outcome, or the 
specific  drug  and  embryo,  fetus,  development.  In  addition, 
we searched the literature related to the use of amphetamines 
as recreational drugs. We also searched the literature specifi-
cally describing the effects of drugs in pregnancy and lacta-
tion  such  as  REPROTOX  (www.reprotox)  or  books  (i.e., 
"Drugs in pregnancy and lactation" edited by C. Schaefer, P. 
Peters  and  R.K.  Miller,  third  edition),  for  any  relevant  and 
updated data on each one of these drugs related to pregnancy 
and lactation. 

3. STIMULANTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD 

  The more commonly used stimulants for the treatment of 
ADHD  and  narcolepsy  are  amphetamines  and  methylpheni-
date. Amphetamines are also used for recreational purposes. 
Both  drugs  bind  to  the  dopamine  transporter,  inhibiting  do-
pamine  reuptake,  thus  reducing  the  breakdown  of  synaptic 
dopamine.  There  are  a  number  of  different  preparations  of

both  amphetamines  and  methylphenidate  differing  in  the 
length of time they are effective (i.e. immediate release, ex-
tended-release  long-acting  ext.)  and  chemical  configuration 
(i.e., focalin, which is the d-enantiomer of methylphenidate). 

3.1. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) and Dexmethylphenidate 

3.1.1. Congenital Malformations 

  Methylphenidate  is  a  piperidine  derivative  structurally 
related  to  amphetamine.  There  seem  to  be  no  human  data 
regarding  the  placental  transfer  of  methylphenidate,  but  its 
molecular weight of 269.8 Dalton is sufficiently low to sug-
gest transfer. Moreover, methylphenidate was found to cross 
the mouse placenta and concentrate in the fetal brain [19-21]. 

  Data on the possible effects of methylphenidate and am-
phetamines in human pregnancy was summarized in 2005 by 
the  expert  panel  on  the  evaluation  of  risks  to  human  repro-
duction  as  being  insufficient  [19],  but  since  then,  several 
important  studies  have  been  published,  including  several 
meta-analyses [20-24]. 

Several case reports and case series reviewed by Bolea - 
Alamanac  et  al.,  [20]  reported  no  significant  teratogenicity. 
Similarly,  in  a  case  series  of  38  pregnant  mothers  (39  in-
fants)  who  were  abusing  methylphenidate  [21],  there  was 
only  an  increased  rate  of  Small  for  Gestational  Age  (SGA) 
infants,  prematurity  and  withdrawal  symptoms,  the  latter 
being observed in 28% of the newborns. 

  Dideriksen  et  al.  [22]  found  4  cohort  studies,  including 
180 first trimester exposures to methylphenidate, with only 4 
malformed infants; all 4 had congenital heart defects, two of 
them  having  ventricular  septal  defects  (VSD).  This  study 
from the Swedish birth registry was extended to include 208 
first-  trimester  and  98  second  and  third-trimester  pregnant 
women that filled out prescriptions for methylphenidate [23]. 
Five infants had cardiac anomalies, 4 of them VSD (27). The 
rate of cardiac anomalies among all cases from both studies 
was  increased  (9/486  -1.85%).  Although  this  finding  is  in 
line  with  several  later  studies  also  demonstrating  increased 
cardiac malformations, we should remember that there were 
no control groups for comparison. 

In  a  Danish  cohort 

study  of  prescriptions  of 
methylphenidate  from  222  pregnancies  exposed,  compared 
to 2,220 controls, there was no increase in the rate of major 
anomalies or of cardiac malformations [24]. 

In another Danish study on the outcome of 480 pregnan-
cies in which the mothers were prescribed different medica-
tions  for  ADHD  [25],  there  was  an  increase  in  miscarriage 
and induced abortions. There were 3 malformed infants. The 
authors  described  a  constant  annual  increase  in  the  use  of 
these medications in pregnancy. However, there was no data 
for individual medications. 

  A relatively recent cohort study evaluated the outcome of 
382 pregnancies exposed to methylphenidate (343 with first-
trimester  exposure)  and  382  pregnancies  exposed  to  non-
teratogenic  agents  (controls).  In  this  multicenter  study  from 
several  Teratogen  Information  Services  [26],  there  was  no 
increase  in  the  rate  of  major  congenital  anomalies  (10/309 
methylphenidate  vs.  13/358  controls),  but  there  was  an  in-

crease in spontaneous and induced abortions and a reduction 
in live-born infants. The higher rate of spontaneous abortions 
was also associated with a high rate of previous spontaneous 
abortions.  In  addition,  there  were  more  perinatal  complica-
tions among those who took methylphenidate until delivery, 
including  poor  neonatal  adaptation  (13/55  vs.  48/355).  It  is, 
however,  possible  that  some  of  the  data  are  confounded  by 
indication. 

Increased spontaneous abortion was also observed by Bro 
et al. [27] in 186 women who were treated during pregnancy 
with methylphenidate or atomoxetine (adjusted Relative Risk 
1.55,  95%  CI  1.03-2.36),  but  such  an  increase  was  also  ob-
served in 275 women with ADHD without treatment. Thus, 
the increase may be confounded by indication. 

In  a  recent  large  population  study  by  Huybrechts  et  al. 
[28],  the  investigators  used  both  the  US  Medicaid  Analytic 
extract  data  and  the  data  from  the  Nordic  Health  registries 
with  a  total  population  of  4.3  million  pregnancies  of  whom 
3474  had  prescriptions  for  methylphenidate  during  the  first 
90 days of pregnancy. Treatment with methylphenidate dur-
ing pregnancy was associated in both the American and the 
Nordic populations with a small increase in the rate of con-
genital cardiac malformations. In the American registry, the 
adjusted  relative  risk  was  1.28,  (95%  CI  0.94-1.74),  and  in 
the Nordic registry, it was also 1.28 (95% CI 0.83-1.97) with 
a  pooled  RR  estimate  from  both  registries  of  1.28  (95%  CI 
1.00-1.64).  There  was  no  significant  increase  in  the  general 
rate of congenital malformations. It is interesting to note that 
no increase in the rate of cardiac or other malformations was 
observed  among  the  children  of  5662  mothers  prescribed 
amphetamines  during  pregnancy  (only  99  from  the  Nordic 
registry). While the data are convincing, we should remem-
ber  that  this  study  used  prescriptions  the  women  received 
during the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no confi-
dence that the women indeed took the medications. 

In  a  recent  meta-analysis  carried  out  by  us  on  4  cohort 
studies with about 3,000 exposures only to methylphenidate 
during  pregnancy,  we  found  an  OR  of  1.59  (95%  CI  10.2-
2.49)  for  cardiac  malformations  [29].  There  was  no  signifi-
cant increase in the general rate of congenital malformations 
(OR of 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.51). An increased rate of cardiac 
malformations  was  also  reported  by  Andrade  [30]  in  his 
commentary on stimulants during pregnancy. 

3.1.2. Other Complications of Pregnancy 

  Cohen et al. [31] studied the possible effects of treatment 
on  a  relatively  large  population  of  pregnant  women  (1515 
women) with ADHD, comparing the outcome of pregnancies 
in  women  treated  with  stimulants  (amphetamine,  dextroam-
phetamine or methylphenidate) after 20 weeks of pregnancy 
to  a  very  large  group  of  women  not  treated  with  stimulants 
(and  not  having  ADHD).  They  found  a  small  increase  in 
rates  of  preeclampsia  and  preterm  births,  but  no  effects  on 
the  rate  of  placental  abruption or  SGA.  The  authors  did  not 
evaluate spontaneous abortions. 

  A similar study was published by Poulton et al. [32] us-
ing  health  records  from  Australia.  The  authors  compared 
women treated with stimulants (before or during pregnancy) 
to untreated women with ADHD and found a small increase 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Stimulant Treatment in Pregnancy 

Current Neuropharmacology, 2021, Vol. 19, No. 11    1797 

in  the  rate  of  cesarean  deliveries,  preeclampsia  and  preterm 
birth.  The  authors  agree  that  their  study,  however,  does  not 
necessarily  reflect  the  effects  of  a  stimulant  treatment  since 
women  in  the  treated  group  were  either  treated  before  or 
during pregnancy and the group was small - only 175 preg-
nant women. 

  Case reports and retrospective studies reported increased 
rates of cardiac anomalies, limb reduction defects and exen-
cephaly associated with amphetamine exposure during preg-
nancy [19, 37, 38]. However, later prospective studies failed 
to  confirm  any  associations  with  cardiac  or  other  malfor-
mations [28, 39, 40]. 

  Maternal  use  of  stimulants  in  pregnancy  (90%  used 
methylphenidate) increased the rate of admission to neonatal 
intensive care units by 50% [33]. However, the mothers us-
ing  stimulants  had  a  higher  rate  of  smoking,  alcohol  use, 
overweight  and  the  use  of  psychotropic  drugs.  Hence  it  is 
difficult  to  decide  that  stimulants  are  responsible  for  these 
complications. 

It  can  therefore,  be  concluded  that  there  is  inadequate 
proof that stimulants increase the rate of pregnancy compli-
cations,  and  the  slight  increase  observed  may  be  a  result  of 
ADHD. 

3.1.3. Breast Feeding 

  There is relatively little data. Methylphenidate is secreted 
in small to moderate amounts in milk, but the infant receives 
less than 1% of the maternal dose corrected for body weight 
and  methylphenidate  is  generally  undetected  in  the  infant's 
blood  [34-36].  Hence,  there  is  no  contraindication  to  breast 
feeding. 

3.1.4. Neurodevelopmental Outcome 

  Debooyi  et  al.  [21]  examined  the  development  of  21 
children born to mothers who abused methylphenidate at one 
year of age and found that 4 of them functioned below nor-
mal.  However,  since  alcohol  abuse  was  so  common  among 
these  women,  it  is  difficult  to  decide  what  was  responsible 
for the low neurodevelopmental abilities of these 4 children. 
We found no other published data. 

3.1.5. In Summary 

suggests 

exposures 

  The  current  data  on  more  than  four  thousand  first  tri-
mester  methylphenidate 
that 
methylphenidate  is  not  a  major  human  teratogen.  However, 
methylphenidate  may  slightly  increase  the  rate  of  cardiac 
malformations.  Pregnant  women  taking  methylphenidate  in 
the first trimester of pregnancy might be advised to undergo 
fetal  echocardiography.  There  might  also  be  an  increased 
rate of spontaneous abortions, prematurity, SGA and perina-
tal complications, but the data are still insufficient. We could 
find  no  studies  on  the  long-term  neurodevelopment  of  the 
exposed children. Hence, depending on the clinical picture, it 
is  for  the  treating  physician  to  decide  whether  to  stop 
methylphenidate treatment once pregnancy is known. 

3.2.  Amphetamines,  Methamphetamines  (Adderall)  and 
Lisdexamphetamine (Vyvanse) 

3.2.1. Congenital Malformations 

  Amphetamines, of which methamphetamine is a - known 
drug  of  abuse,  increase  the  synaptic  dopamine.  The  data  on 
their  possible  effects  in  pregnancy  are  scarce,  and  many  of 
the published studies report the outcome of pregnant women 
abusing amphetamines [19]. 

  A prospective study on 228 amphetamine-exposed preg-
nancies used as a recreational drug did not find an increase in 
major  malformations  [39].  Kallen  et  al.  [23]  described  the 
outcome of 132 women prescribed amphetamines in the first 
trimester of pregnancy with 4 children (3%) having congeni-
tal malformations 

3.2.2.  Effects  on  the  Course  of  Pregnancy  and  Maternal 
Complications 

Several retrospective studies found a higher rate of prem-
aturity and SGA among women using amphetamines recrea-
tionally.  A  reduction  in  birth  weight  and  increased  rate  of 
prematurity was reported in a retrospective study of 141 in-
fants  exposed  during  different  times  of  pregnancy  to  am-
phetamines.  The  study  was  carried  out  on  amphetamine  ad-
dicted mothers [41]. Eriksson et al. compared the outcome of 
69  pregnancies  of  amphetamine-addicted  mothers;  17  of 
them stopped amphetamine, and the others continued to use 
these  drugs  throughout  pregnancy  [42].  There  was  an  in-
creased  rate  of  prematurity,  maternal  hypertension,  postpar-
tum  hemorrhage,  and  retained  placenta  in  those  using  am-
phetamines throughout pregnancy. 

In  a  prospective  cohort  study  of  204  infants  born  to 
methamphetamine  abusing  mothers  [43]  as  compared  with 
unexposed infants, the infants exposed to methamphetamine 
had a higher rate of growth restriction and earlier delivery. If 
the drug use is discontinued sometime before delivery, these 
complications normalized. 

Smith et al. [44] found in a retrospective study that meth-
amphetamine  exposure  reduced  fetal  growth  in  utero  as  ob-
served  even  in  term  infants.  The  association  with  smoking 
further reduced fetal growth. 

  Kalaitzopoulos  et  al.  [45],  in  their  meta  -analysis  of  8 
studies involving 626 women taking methamphetamine dur-
ing  pregnancy,  as  compared  to  2626  controls,  found  lower 
gestational age at birth, lower birth weight and head circum-
ference,  birth  length  and  Apgar  scores.  These  reinforce  the 
findings described above. 

It can be summarized that perinatal complications include 
higher  rates  of  gestational  hypertension,  preeclampsia,  pla-
cental abruption, intrauterine fetal death, preterm birth, neo-
natal death, and infant death. 

  We should, however, remember that a major problem in 
many of these studies lies in the fact that the pregnancies are 
of  mothers  addicted  to  methamphetamines.  Many  of  these 
women also used other psychotropic drugs, including opioids 
and/or  alcohol.  Hence,  these  important  confounders  should 
be considered in the evaluation of the above-described data. 
In addition, the possible effects of ADHD on these parame-
ters have not been adequately studied. It is therefore difficult 
to assess from these data the possible adverse effects of am-

phetamines  used  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD  or  narcolepsy 
on the course of pregnancy. 

3.2.3. Withdrawal Symptoms 

  Withdrawal symptoms were described in newborn infants 
prenatally  exposed  to  methamphetamine,  manifested  by  jit-
teriness, drowsiness, and respiratory distress [46]. 

3.2.4. Abnormalities in Brain Imaging Studies 

Several  brain  imaging  studies  have  shown  distinct  long-
term morphologic changes in the brain structure of children 
born to mothers who abused amphetamines during pregnan-
cy  using  diffusion  tension  imaging,  proton  magnetic  reso-
nance imaging H-MRI or fMRI [47-49]. 

  Abnormalities in white matter microstructure [47] includ-
ing  motor  pathways  (corona  radiata  and  corticospinal  tract) 
were demonstrated by diffusion tension imaging (DTI); Sex-
dependent structural differences in striatal, parietal, and tem-
poral areas compared to controls was found by MRI as well 
as a reduction in cortical thickness and in the size of subcor-
tical  nuclei  including  the  caudate  nucleus,  striatal,  frontal 
and limbic white matter [47-49].  

3.2.5. Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Studies 

In  contrast  to  the  lack  of  studies  on  the  neurodevelop-
to 
mental  outcome  of  children  prenatally  exposed 
methylphenidate,  there  are  many  studies  on  the  neurodevel-
opmental outcome of children born to amphetamine abusing 
mothers.  A  high  proportion  of  these  mothers  also  abused 
other drugs, cigarettes and alcohol. 

In  contrast  to  the  above-mentioned  descriptions  of 
changes in brain structure evidenced from different imaging 
studies  [47-49],  some  of  the  neurodevelopmental  studies  on 
children born to methamphetamine addicted mothers showed 
only  few  neurodevelopmental  abnormalities.  For  example, 
Chang et al. [50] evaluated 49 children exposed during preg-
nancy  to  methamphetamine  and  examined  at  3-4  years  of 
age, in comparison to 49 control children. There was no dif-
ference in their cognitive abilities compared to sex-matched 
controls,  but  there  were  differences  in  visual-motor  integra-
tion.  In  addition,  the  investigators  found  several  changes  in 
the  composition  of  neuro-metabolites  in  the  brain  of  the 
children  prenatally  exposed  to  methamphetamine,  as  evi-
denced by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [50]. 

  The most important data on neurodevelopmental abilities 
of  children  from  birth  to  7.5  years  of  age  come  from  the 
IDEAL  (Infant  Development,  Environment  and  Lifestyle) 
study  on  neurodevelopmental  follow-up  of  children  born  to 
mothers who were addicted to methamphetamines [51-54]. 

  The  multicenter  controlled  prospective  IDEAL  study 
recruited at delivery methamphetamine-exposed infants born 
in the US and New Zealand between 2002 and 2004 in com-
parison  to  socio-demographically  matched  control  infants. 
The  methamphetamine  addicted  mothers  had  also  been  ex-
posed  to  factors  common  to  methamphetamine  abusers,  in-
cluding  alcohol,  tobacco,  marijuana,  and  maternal  depres-
sion. The study cohorts consisted of 412 mother-infant pairs 
(204  with  prenatal  methamphetamine  exposure  and  208  un-
exposed  controls)  that  were  recruited  in  the  US  and  of  223 

(108  exposed  to  methamphetamine  and  115  controls)  that 
were  recruited  in  New  Zealand.  Findings  regarding  motor, 
cognitive,  behavioral,  and  emotional  development  for  the 
children  followed  from  birth  to  7.5  years  of  age  have  been 
published  in  several  studies  and  summarized  in  2015.  As 
children  of  addicted  parents  also  suffer  from  postnatal  ne-
glect and sometimes even child abuse, one has to remember 
that the neurodevelopmental data is a result of the interaction 
between prenatal exposure and postnatal environmental dep-
rivation. 

3.2.5.1. Data on Neonates 

Prenatal  methamphetamine  exposure  in  the  IDEAL  co-
hort was associated in the neonatal period with a greater like-
lihood  of  admission  to  the  neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  re-
duced birth weight, slightly smaller head circumference and 
shorter  body  length.  The  infants  also  had  poor  suck,  de-
creased arousal, increased physiological stress, and low tone 
[51]. 

3.2.5.2. Developmental Data at the Age of 3-5 Years 

  No differences were found between the exposed and con-
trol  children  in  mental  development,  expressive  and  recep-
tive  language  and  gross  motor  skills.  There  were  some  dif-
ferences in fine motor skills and a higher rate of behavioral 
problems and language delay. However, these were attribut-
ed to adverse home environments rather than methampheta-
mine [52, 53]. 

In an additional study at the same age, prenatal metham-
phetamine  exposure  was  associated  with  behavioral  and  at-
tentional  problems  and  with  some  increase  in  anxie-
ty/depression.  These  deviations,  including  attentional  prob-
lems  and  decreased  inhibitory  control,  seemed  to  be  more 
prominent at 5-6 years [52-54]. 

3.2.5.3. Data at 7.5 Years of Age 

  There  was  a  higher  rate  of  aggressive  and  rule-breaking 
behavior among the exposed children, a higher rate of exter-
nalizing  problems  in  the  Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL) 
and  a  higher  number  of  children  with  some  cognitive  im-
pairment  [54,  55].  There  was  also  a  higher  rate  of  ADHD 
among  the  prenatally  exposed  children.  It  should  again  be 
noted that their mothers were addicted to amphetamines and 
ADHD  is  more  prevalent  in  addicted  persons  [1,  4,  10]. 
Hence, the higher rate of ADHD might be related to the ge-
netic  predisposition  rather  than  to  the  action  of  ampheta-
mines. 

  We  found  no  other  neurodevelopmental  studies  in  chil-
dren born to mothers with ADHD treated with low doses of 
amphetamines during pregnancy. 

3.2.6. Breast Feeding 

  Amphetamines are excreted in human milk and may also 
be  found  in  the  urine  of  nursing  infants  [36,  56-58].  Poor 
sleeping and irritability have been described in some nursing 
infants,  but  long-term  adverse  effects  were  not  described, 
and the data are insufficient. Due to the relatively high milk 
levels and possible effects on the nursing infant, such as irri-
tability  and  agitation,  breast-feeding  is  contraindicated  by 
some sources [36, 58].

3.2.7. In Summary 

Prenatal  exposure  to  amphetamines  does  not  seem  to 
increase  the  rate  of  major  congenital  malformations,  but 
there seems to be a small increase in various perinatal com-
plications  suggesting  some  interference  with  intrauterine 
growth. The data on the neurodevelopmental outcome is also 
reassuring. Most studies were carried out on children born to 
mothers  who  were  addicted  to  amphetamines,  and  were 
therefore  exposed  to  high  levels  of  the  drug.  The  observed 
neurobehavioral  changes,  including  a  high  rate  of  ADHD 
(observed in one study), may also be confounded by exposure 
to other substances such as alcohol or other drugs. Pregnant 
women with ADHD who are in need of amphetamine treat-
ment might be able to continue treatment during pregnancy, 
trying to use the smallest effective dose. It is for the treating 
physician to consider the necessity of treatment and if treat-
ment  is  not  absolutely  needed,  it  may  be  advisable  to  stop 
treatment during pregnancy. Breast feeding is contraindicated. 

4. BUPROPION 

  Bupropion  is  a  non  -  stimulant  drug  acting  as  a  norepi-
nephrine-dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor  (NDRI),  primarily 
affecting the reward-pleasure mesolimbic dopaminergic sys-
tem [59, 60]. In the last several years, it is also used for the 
treatment  of  ADHD  [59].  It  is  marketed  as  an  immediate 
release  (IR),  sustained-release  (SR)  and  extended-release 
(XR) product. 

  Chemically, bupropion has some similarities to stimulant 
drugs as it belongs to the class of aminoketones [60]. Since 
bupropion  is  mainly  used  as  an  antidepressant  or  for  smok-
ing  cessation,  most  data  are  from  pregnant  women  taking 
bupropion for these indications. We found no studies on the 
effects of bupropion on pregnancy in women with ADHD. 

4.1. Effects on Pregnancy 

  Much  of  the  data  on  its  safety  in  pregnancy  come  from 
the  pregnancy  registry  organized  by  the  manufacturer  [61]. 
According to their report on a prospective study of 806 first 
trimester  exposures,  there  were  651  normal  liveborn  infants 
and 18 malformed infants in a cohort of first trimester expo-
sures,  a  rate  not  different  from  the  general  population.  The 
manufacturer also conducted a retrospective cohort study and 
a nested case-control study and reached similar conclusions. 

  Cole et al. [62] studied the outcome of 1,213 infants from 
the GlaxoSmithKline bupropion pregnancy registry exposed 
in utero to bupropion during the first trimester of pregnancy 
and  found  a  rate  of  2.3%  malformations  including  cardiac 
anomalies  among  first  trimester  exposures  [aOR  of  0.95 
(95%  CI  0.62-1.45)  and  1.0  (95%  CI  0.57-1.73)]  compared 
to  the  control  groups.  The  rate  of  cardiovascular  anomalies 
was also similar among the groups [62]. 

In a smaller prospective cohort study of 136 women who 
used bupropion in the first trimester of pregnancy for smok-
ing cessation or depression, infants were followed up to the 
first  year  after  delivery  [63].  There  were  no  major  malfor-
mations  in  the  bupropion-exposed  group  and  no  increase  in 
preterm birth or low birth weight compared with two control 
groups  of  non-teratogenic  exposures  or  of  administration  of 

other  antidepressants.  An  additional  study  from  the  same 
group on 113 pregnant women with first trimester exposure 
to  bupropion  [64]  also  did  not  find  any  increase  in  major 
congenital anomalies. 

In  a  population-based  case  control  study  from  the  Na-
tional  Birth  Defects  Prevention  Study  in  the  United  States, 
the authors found that more mothers of infants with left out-
flow  tract  cardiac  anomalies  were  taking  bupropion  com-
pared to mothers of infants without congenital anomalies or 
with  non-cardiac  anomalies.  However,  exposure  was  based 
on  maternal  retrospective  recall  and  some  of  the  mothers 
taking bupropion had also taken other antidepressants which 
might  have  contributed  to  the  increased  cardiac  anomalies 
[65]. 

  Moreover,  another  case-control  study  from  the  Slone 
Epidemiology  Center  Birth  Defects  Study  [66]  found  in-
creased rate of ventricular septal defects (VSD) with the use 
of bupropion as an antidepressant, but not if used with other 
antidepressants.  Here,  too,  maternal  self-report  was  used  to 
determine first trimester drug exposure. 

  The  issue  of  increased  cardiac  malformations  related  to 
bupropion use in pregnancy is still in debate. In that context 
it  is  worth  mentioning  that  a  study  using  US  Medicaid  data 
from 2000-2007 [67] with 8,856 pregnancies prescribed bu-
propion  -  6,691  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy,  did  not 
find an increase in any cardiac malformation including right 
ventricular  outflow  tract  obstruction,  or  ventricular  septal 
defect. 

Figueroa  found  an  increased  rate  of  ADHD  among  114 
children at 5 years of age that were born to depressed moth-
ers  who  were  given  prescriptions  for  bupropion,  especially 
during  the  second  trimester  of  pregnancy  [68].  No  such  in-
crease was found in depressed mothers treated with SSRI or 
untreated.  A  positive  association  still  remained  after  adjust-
ment  for  several  confounders  including  parental  ADHD. 
However, the small size of the group, the fact that the study 
was based on prescriptions and the relatively low rate cases 
(5/114) weaken these results. 

4.2. Breast Feeding 

  Bupropion  is  secreted  in  human  milk  in  concentration 
higher than the maternal blood level [36, 69, 70]. However, 
in a study on 2 infants nursed by mothers taking bupropion, 
bupropion  or  its  metabolite  hydroxybupropion  were  not  de-
tected in infants’ blood and there were no side effects in the 
infants [69]. The nursing infants are expected to be exposed 
to about 2% of maternal dose-corrected dose [70] thus reduc-
ing the fear of side effects. In spite of reported transient side 
effects [71], depending on the dose, nursing is generally not 
contraindicated [36]. 

  We found no studies on neurodevelopmental outcome of 
prenatally exposed children, except for the data on the preva-
lence of ADHD that may be confounded by maternal disease 
or other factors. 

4.3. In Summary 

  Bupropion,  similar  to  other  antidepressants  [36,  72],  is 
not  associated  with  an  increased  rate  of  congenital  anoma-

lies. Thus, pregnant women treated with bupropion can con-
tinue  treatment  during  pregnancy.  Practically,  there  is  no 
data on long-term development. 

5. ATOMOXETINE 

  Atomoxetine  (Strattera)  is  a  norepinephrine  reuptake 
inhibitor  often  used  in  the  pharmacological  treatment  of 
ADHD.  It  inhibits  the  reuptake  of  norepinephrine  by  selec-
tively  inhibiting  the  presynaptic  norepinephrine  transporter 
[73, 74]. It was also the first non-stimulant drug approved in 
the US for the treatment of ADHD. It is marketed as an ex-
tended-release drug active for 10-12 hours [16-18]. There are 
only few case reports on the possible effects of atomoxetine 
on human pregnancies and several cohort studies. 

5.1. Effects on Pregnancy 

  Kallen  et  al.  [23],  in  their  comprehensive  data  from  the 
Swedish  registry  on  the  effects  of  psychotropic  drugs  in 
pregnancy,  described  the  outcome  of  450  women  that  were 
prescribed  (treated)  with  stimulants,  of  which  34  used 
atomoxetine. Of the 34 women, 22 were prescribed atomoxe-
tine in the first trimester of pregnancy. No congenital anoma-
lies  were  reported  in  these  pregnancies.  Cohen  et  al.  [32] 
evaluated  the  outcome  of  pregnancies  in  453  women  who 
used  atomoxetine  during  pregnancy  and  did  not  find  any 
increase  in  congenital  malformations  or  in  pregnancy  com-
plications. There are no data on the neurodevelopmental out-
come  of  children  prenatally  exposed  to  atomoxetine  or  on 
the possible transfer to the nursing infant. There seems to be 
no data regarding its safety during breastfeeding. 

5.2. In Summary 

  No additional conclusions can be drawn from the human 
studies on the safety of atomoxetine in pregnancy. Due to the 
lack of data, the treating physician should consider the clini-
cal  value  of  atomoxetine  treatment  in  women  with  ADHD 
during pregnancy. 

6. CLONIDINE 

  Clonidine is being used for many years for the treatment 
of  hypertension.  Clonidine  is  an  alpha  2  adrenergic  agonist 
that  may  regulate  norepinephrine  release  from  the  Locus 
Coereleus  in  the  brainstem,  having  similar  effects  to 
atomoxetine. It is known to cross the human placenta, and is 
cleared  more  rapidly  from  the  blood  during  pregnancy  [75, 
76]. No data could be found on possible effects of clonidine 
on pregnancy in women treated for ADHD, and all data are 
therefore  derived  from  the  use  of  clonidine  as  an  anti-
hypertensive  agent.  Generally,  the  doses  used  for  the  treat-
ment  of  hypertension  are  higher  than  those  used  for  the 
treatment of ADHD. 

6.1. Effects on Pregnancy 

  Generally,  the  studies  on  the  treatment  of  hypertension 
during  pregnancy  by  clonidine  demonstrated  the  safety  of 
this  drug  in  pregnancy.  There  are  several  case  reports  on 
malformed  infants  prenatally  exposed  to  clonidine,  but  this 
may  be  a  coincidence.  Rothberger  et  al  [76]  studied  72  hy-
pertensive  pregnant  women  treated  with  clonidine  during 

pregnancy  and  found  that  fetal  growth  was  reduced  in  the 
pregnancies  of  women  who  respond  to  clonidine  treatment 
by reduced cardiac output, but not in women who responded 
to  clonidine  by  reduced  vascular  resistance.  Hence,  reduced 
fetal  weight  was  related  to  specific  effects  of  clonidine  on 
maternal hemodynamics. 

In  a  prospective  study  on  100  hypertensive  pregnant 
women  [77]  half  treated  with  clonidine  hydrochloride  and 
half  with  methyldopa,  there  was  no  increase  in  malfor-
mations  rate.  Similarly,  Tuimala  et  al  [78]  studied  the  out-
come of pregnancies in 82 hypertensive women treated with 
clonidine during pregnancy and found no malformed infants. 

In spite of the fact that the data on the safety of clonidine 
in pregnancy stems from the treatment of hypertension, they 
can  also  be  applied  to  the  treatment  of  ADHD.  The  indica-
tion for what a drug is given makes little differences regard-
ing teratogenicity, unless the doses are significantly different 
or the underlying disease directly affects the developing em-
bryo/fetus, as known for diabetes [79]. 

6.2. Breastfeeding 

  Clonidine  is  secreted  in  human  milk  in  relatively  large 
amounts, and the milk concentrations are higher than in ma-
ternal  blood.  The  concentrations  in  the  infants'  blood  were 
found to be half of those in the mother [80]. There are also 
several  reports  on  cases  of  complications  of  maternal 
clonidine  administered  for  the  treatment  of  hypertension-
induced  in  breast-fed  infants  (e.g.,  hypotonia,  drowsiness, 
episodes of apnea and seizure -like episodes). In spite of the 
fact that these adverse effects disappeared after nursing was 
stopped [36, 81], breastfeeding is contraindicated [81]. 

6.3. Neurodevelopmental Outcome 

  Huisjes  et  al.  [82]  examined  22  children  born  to  hyper-
tensive  mothers  treated  during  pregnancy  with  clonidine 
compared  to  22  children  born  to  hypertensive  mothers  not 
treated  with  clonidine.  They  found  at  early  school  age  a 
slightly higher rate of hyperactivity and sleep disorders com-
pared to those not treated with clonidine. No other neurode-
velopmental studies were found. 

6.4. In Summary 

From  the  little  data  available  on  the  possible  effects  of 
clonidine  treatment  for  hypertension  on  the  developing  hu-
man embryo and fetus, it seems that clonidine is not terato-
genic.  If  needed,  clonidine  can  be  used  in  pregnant  women 
with  ADHD.  Due  to  high  milk  concentrations,  it  is  prefera-
ble to avoid breastfeeding. 

7. GUANFACINE 

  Guanfacine  is  an  alpha  2  adrenergic  agonist  with  an  ac-
tion similar to that of clonidine and is used as an antihyper-
tensive agent and in the last years as a non -stimulant treat-
ment for ADHD, especially in cases of stimulant failure [82, 
83]. The little data on its possible effects in pregnancy comes 
from  its  use  as  an  anti-hypertensive  drug  where  it  seems  to 
be well-tolerated and safe for treatment during pregnancy for 
both  the  mother  and  fetus.  Although  guanfacine  might  de-

crease serum prolactin levels, it does not seem to interfere in 
the course of pregnancy [84]. 

SSRIs

7.1. Effects on Pregnancy 

  No studies were found regarding the use of guanfacine in 
the first trimester of pregnancy. Phillip et al. [85, 86] studied 
the  pregnancy  outcome  of  30  women  with  preeclampsia 
treated with guanfacine in the second half of pregnancy and 
only  for  16-68  days.  There  were  no  malformed  infants,  but 
20%  had  low  birth  weight.  This  could  also  be  attributed  to 
maternal  preeclampsia.  The  newborn  infants  were  reported 
to have normal heart rates and had no specific complications. 
In  addition,  we  could  find  no  data  on  the  development  of 
offspring  exposed  in  utero  to  guanfacine  or  on  guanfacine 
treatment and breastfeeding. 

7.2. In Summary 

  As  long  as  there  is  no  additional  data  on  the  safety  of 
guanfacine in pregnancy, it may be advisable to discontinue 
treatment when pregnant. 

CONCLUSION 

From the currently available data from prospective, retro-
spective  and  case-control  studies,  it  can  be  concluded  that 
none of the drugs used for the treatment of ADHD is a major 
human teratogen. There are only very few long-term neuro-
developmental  studies  on  the  offspring.  Hence,  it  is  advisa-
ble that women with ADHD will plan their pregnancies and 
if possible, depending on the severity of their symptoms, it is 
preferable  to  stop  treatment  before  or  at  the  beginning  of 
pregnancy.  If  treatment  is  needed,  one  should  prefer 
methylphenidate  or  amphetamines  over  other  drugs,  with  a 
slight  preference  to  methylphenidate,  to  enable  breastfeed-
ing.  If  they  are  treated  with  non-stimulant  medications,  bu-
propion  is  the  preferred  drug  since  there  is  more  reassuring 
data on this drug in pregnancy.
