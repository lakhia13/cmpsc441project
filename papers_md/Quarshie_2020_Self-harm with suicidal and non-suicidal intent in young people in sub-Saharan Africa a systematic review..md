Self-harm with suicidal and non-suicidal
intent in young people in sub-Saharan
Africa: a systematic review
Emmanuel N-B Quarshie1*, Mitch G. Waterman2 and Allan O. House3

Abstract

Background: Self-harm, whether attributed to suicidal or non-suicidal motives, is associated with several poor
outcomes in young people, including eventual suicide. Much of our understanding of self-harm in young people is
based on literature from Europe (particularly, the UK), North America, and Australia. We aimed to synthesise the
available evidence on prevalence, the commonly reported self-harm methods, correlates, risk and protective factors,
and reasons for self-harm, in adolescents (aged 10–25 years) in sub-Saharan Africa.
Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, African Journals OnLine, and African Index Medicus for records
from 1950 through August 2019, without language restrictions. We supplemented the database searches by
searching relevant portals for postgraduate theses, reference harvesting, contacting authors for unpublished studies,
and hand searching relevant print sources. We applied narrative synthesis to the evidence.

Results: Seventy-four studies from 18 sub-Saharan African countries met the inclusion criteria. The median lifetime
prevalence estimate was 10·3% (interquartile range [IQR] 4·6% – 16·1%); median 12-month prevalence estimate was
16·9% (IQR: 11·5% – 25·5%); median 6-month prevalence estimate was 18·2% (IQR: 12·7% – 21·8%); and the median
1-month prevalence estimate was 3·2% (IQR: 2·5–14·8%). Studies from Western sub-Saharan Africa reported the
highest 12-month prevalence estimates (median = 24·3%; IQR = 16·9% – 27·9%). Clinical samples commonly reported
overdose, whereas self-cutting was most commonly reported in non-clinical samples. Academic failure, sexual,
emotional, and physical abuse, romantic relationship problems, family conflict, depression, and previous self-harm
were identified as key correlates of self-harm. No study reported protective factors against self-harm.
Conclusion: Variation in estimates was explained by small sample sizes and variation in definitions and measures
used. Exploration of associations, risks and protective factors was based upon concepts and measures derived from
high income countries. More detailed and culturally sensitive research is needed to understand the context-specific
risks and protective factors for self-harm in adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.

Background
The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines self-
harm as “an act with non-fatal outcome in which an in-
dividual deliberately initiates a non-habitual behaviour,
that without intervention from others will cause self-
harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the
prescribed or generally recognised therapeutic dosage,
and which is aimed at realising changes that the person
desires via the actual or expected physical consequences”
[1, 2].

This definition does not distinguish acts of self-harm
according to intent, and for brevity in this review we use
the term “self-harm” to refer to acts that are attributed
to suicidal and non-suicidal motivations. Self-harm
among young people is a recognised problem in the
mental health of populations in high income countries,
where it is associated with a number of poor outcomes
including eventual suicide [3, 4]. By comparison we
know little about self-harm in young people in sub-
Saharan Africa; instead much of our understanding is
based on extrapolation from literature from Europe, par-
ticularly the UK, North America, and Australia [5–8].
Earlier regional reviews have either included only a few
selected studies of young people from Africa, [9–11] or
included only studies involving adult population samples
from the region [12]. Thus, we have found no existing
review that has systematically appraised the available
published and unpublished evidence specifically on self-
harm among adolescents in countries in sub-Saharan
Africa.

The aims of the present review were to:

1) Describe the lifetime, 12-month, 6-month, and 1-
month prevalence estimates of self-harm in young
people (aged 10–25 years) across sub-Saharan
Africa.

2) Describe the commonest methods of self-harm in

3)

young people identified across the previous studies.
Identify the commonest associations, risks, and
protective factors associated with self-harm in
young people observed in previous studies across
sub-Saharan Africa.

4) Describe the self-reported reasons for self-harm in

young people across sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods
This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines [13]
(see Additional files 1 and 2). We searched MEDLINE,
PsycINFO, PubMed, African Journals OnLine, African
Index Medicus, and the South African national Electronic
Theses
(Add-
itional file 3) between January 1950 and August 2019,
without language restrictions. The geographic search filter
included names of the countries in English and languages

and Dissertations

(SA-ETD) portal,

relevant to the countries [14]. When a country’s name had
changed after 1950 [15], both current and earlier names
were included. We searched grey literature, institutional
and organisational reports and national and international
government reports (e.g., WHO, World Bank, UNICEF,
UNDP) [16]. We hand searched edited books, the West
African Journal of Medicine, Ghana Medical
Journal,
South African Medical Journal, Ethiopian Medical Journal,
and the East African Medical Journal. We contacted aca-
demics with a research interest in self-harm and authors
who published two or more articles on self-harm identi-
fied during our review (see Additional file 4). Reference
harvesting used Science Citation Index, Google Scholar,
and manual search. Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of
studies are shown in Table 1.

tool

We used EndNote (version X9.2) to collate and handle
the identified records. All records were screened for eli-
gibility by reading the titles, abstracts, methods, and re-
sults sections by EQ, with consensus discussion of 10–
20% of studies with co-authors. Appraisal of the meth-
odological quality of records used the mixed method ap-
praisal
substantial
heterogeneity across the studies. We applied narrative
synthesis to the evidence in the final set of studies; we
present the prevalence estimates as median values and
interquartile ranges (IQRs). We report pooled estimates
(median and IQR) to aid presentation of the data, but
note should be taken of the substantial heterogeneity in
studies included [18, 19].

Results
Seventy-four studies involving adolescents aged 10–25
years were included after removing duplicates - one na-
tional report on adolescent health behaviour, seven
(9·4%) postgraduate theses, one book chapter and 65
(87·8%) peer-reviewed articles published in indexed aca-
demic journals (see Additional file 5).

Characteristics of included studies
The majority of the studies, 54 (73%), used the terms
“suicide attempt”, “suicidal attempt”, or “attempted sui-
cide”, to describe self-harm. Although included studies
distinguished between suicidal
self-harm and non-
suicidal self-harm in their findings none of the studies
indicated if a definition or explanation of the core ques-
tion was provided to participants [20]. Because we
wanted to include all acts that meet the WHO defin-
ition, which does not include a requirement for a spe-
cific intent, given the contention about the soundness of
the distinction between self-reported suicidal and non-
suicidal acts [21], which is likely to be a particular prob-
lem in countries where suicide is illegal and where dif-
ferent languages may not readily reflect the distinction,
and as individual suicide risk is known to reside in all

self-harm

Include
▪ Studies with clear definitions of self-harm (or alternative term or
concept used) as an intentional act of self-inflicted injury or poi-
soning, in addition to clear means of case identification, assess-
ment or measurement.

Prevalence
estimate

▪ Studies with specified time frames within which prevalence of
self-harm was assessed.

Setting

Participants

Study Designs

▪ Studies with primary focus on self-harm conducted within non-
clinical contexts (i.e., general population, community, school-
based, households / neighbourhoods, street-connected settings
etc.) in countries within sub-Saharan Africa.
▪ Studies conducted in clinical contexts focused on self-harm as
the main presenting condition.
▪ Clinical studies concerned with self-harm as the primary condi-
tion (but not as comorbid condition, e.g., self-harm in HIV/AIDS
or epilepsy).
▪ Studies reporting prevalence estimates of self-harm involving
participants aged between 10 and 25 years.
▪ Studies reporting on the associates, risk and protective factors
related to self-harm, methods of self-harm used, and reported
reasons for self-harm involving participants aged 10 and 25 years
with a personal self-harm history at the time of assessment for
the study.
▪ Studies with wide age range but majority (90% or more) of the
participants are within the age bracket of 10–25 years.

▪ Studies with focus on self-harm which address at least one of
the four specified objectives of this review using: (1) quantitative
methods (i.e., school-based, household-based, population/com-
munity-based cross-sectional survey; census; retrospective or pro-
spective descriptive cohort designs; case controls; case reports;
randomised controlled trials, and analytic cohort designs); or (2)
qualitative methods (e.g., interviews, focus groups etc.); or (3)
retrospective reviews of clinical records.
▪ Cross-national studies involving countries in sub-Saharan Africa
and other countries outside the sub-region, which stratify and
link the results to the included countries. In such instances, the
specified results related to the sub-Saharan African countries
were included in this review.

Exclude
▪ Studies focused on unintended self-harm behaviours (e.g.,
smoking, drink-driving, eating disorders etc.).
▪ Studies focused on intended self-harm with socially sanc-
tioned motives (e.g., scarification, manhood rituals, ‘body en-
hancement’, religious fasting, hunger strikes etc.).
▪ Studies focused on intended self-harm behaviours not ap-
proved by the broader sociocultural context but are sanc-
tioned by the subcultures (e.g., cult groups, Goth subcultures,
Emo subcultures etc.) within which they occur.
▪ Studies focused on suicidal ideations, self-harm thoughts, or
threats, as these do not necessarily translate into or represent
acts of self-harm.
▪ Studies focused on suicide (self-inflicted death).
▪ If prevalence estimates cannot be determined within a clear
time frame;
▪ If there is no clear indication of sample size and population
denominator.
▪ Studies focused on adolescents in prisons or borstal
institutions, unless control groups in such studies allow for
the evaluation of risk and protective factors of self-harm in
adolescents.

▪ Adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders, cancer,
insulin-dependent diabetes, epilepsy or HIV/AIDS adolescent
patients, unless control groups in such studies allow for the
evaluation of risk and protective factors of self-harm.
▪ Studies involving participants within wide age ranges with
the study results not disaggregated by age, making it
impossible to link specific results to participants age 10–25
years, and where participants are stratified by age but with
participants aged 10–25 years constituting less than 90% of
the total sample which did not specifically link the reported
prevalence estimates, identified risks or associates of self-
harm, protective factors, methods of self-harm, or the identi-
fied reasons for self-harm to young people aged 10–25 years.
▪ Studies based on the same dataset reported in an earlier
publication included in this review.
▪ Systematic reviews, commentaries, editorials, opinion pieces,
correspondence, and articles not based on data.
▪ Where full text of the identified article was unavailable or
could not be accessed.
▪ Cross-national studies involving countries in sub-Saharan Af-
rica and other countries outside the sub-region, which did
not stratify or link the results to the respective included
countries.

acts of self-harm regardless of attribution, we have in-
cluded all studies in our estimates of prevalence where it
was clear that self-harm was the question put to partici-
pants, regardless of apparent intent.

Data were available from all four geographical sub-
regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The majority (44·6%)
were from five countries within Southern sub-Saharan
Africa (eSwatini, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,

and Zambia) - South Africa ranked the highest with
more than half (n = 37) of the total
included records;
30·4% were based on data from six Western sub-Saharan
Ivory Coast,
African
Mauritania, Nigeria, and Togo); 1·1% from Congo-
Brazzaville in Central sub-Saharan Africa; and 23·9% of
data obtained from six countries within Eastern sub-
Saharan Africa (Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Seychelles,

Main findings
Fifty-five (74·3%) of the studies reported prevalence esti-
mates,
though none reported lifetime, 12-month, 6-
month, and 1-month estimates, with 12-month estimates
favoured by the majority (n = 30; 54·5%). As shown in
Table 2,
the reported lifetime prevalence estimates
ranged from 1·4% to 48·3% [28, 50]; the 12-month preva-
lence estimates varied between 0·9% and 35·8% [52, 72];
the reported 6-month prevalence ranged from 7·4% to
22·7% [55, 79]; and the 1-month reported prevalence es-
timates varied between 1·9% and 26·4% [31, 58].

The majority of the 55 prevalence studies (n = 46;
83·6%)
focused on suicidal self-harm, seven studies
(12·7%) focused on non-suicidal self-harm [48, 50, 52,
53, 60, 70, 76], while two studies simultaneously re-
ported the prevalence estimates of both suicidal self-
harm (suicidal attempt) and non-suicidal self-harm (self-
injury) [28, 72].

Visual inspection of the forest plots and the I2 value
ranges (98·84% to 99·71%, p < ·001) indicate that het-
erogeneity across each of these summaries is substan-
tial
(see Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). Median values with
interquartile ranges were computed for the overall
and sub-regional reported prevalence estimates (see
Fig. 5). Considerable variability was found across the
ranges of prevalence estimates reported: the median
lifetime prevalence estimate was 10·3% (interquartile
range [IQR] of 4·6% – 16·1%) and the median 12-
month prevalence estimate was 16·9% (IQR: 11·5% –

Tanzania, and Uganda). Seventy-two of the studies were
in English and two were in French.

The majority of the studies (n = 56; 75·6%) utilised a
quantitative cross-sectional design involving question-
naires administered to participants accessed in commu-
nities/households, a charity facility, hospitals, schools
and universities (see Additional file 6). Five studies in-
cluded only female participants [22–26]; and one study
involved only male participants [27]. The majority (n =
49; 66·2%) of the studies sampled students from schools
and universities. Six studies
sampled young
people who were out of the school environment, includ-
ing adolescents living in poor, rural, war-affected com-
munities [28], adolescents in children’s homes [29],
children and youth living in slums and streets [30, 31],
adolescents living in poor urban and rural villages [32],
and out-of-school youth who were unstably housed, liv-
ing in poor urban neighbourhoods [33].

(8·1%)

The total sample covered by the studies was 205,132.
Thirty-nine (52·7%) of the studies used some form of
random selection in recruiting their participants. Across
the 74 studies, only 14 (18·9%) provided information on
the size of their target population and how their sample
sizes were determined.

Six (8·1%) of the studies were rated “average quality”
on the MMAT, 21 studies (28·4%) were rated “above
average quality”; 22 studies (29·7%) were rated “high
quality”, while the remaining 25 studies (33·8%) were
rated to be of “very high quality” (see Additional file 7).

ported the highest 12-month prevalence estimates
(median = 24·3%; IQR = 16·9% – 27·9%), while studies
from Eastern (median = 11·5%; IQR = 11·1% – 18·3%)
and Southern (median = 16·5%; IQR = 10·9% – 24·0%)

sub-Saharan Africa reported relatively similar median
12-month prevalence estimates.

Twenty (27%) of

the 74 studies reported on the
methods of self-harm (Table 3). Overdose of medication
was frequently reported from clinic-based studies, while

Quarshie et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:234 

Page 13 of 26

Fig. 3 6-month prevalence estimates of self-harm

self-cutting was the predominant method reported in
the non-clinic based studies.

Overall, 48 (64·9%) of the 74 studies reported on the
associates, risks and protective factors. The evidence was
organised by reported associates into four main do-
mains: personal, family, school, and interpersonal (non-
family). The interpersonal (non-family) included circum-
stances related to the individuals’ relationships with
peers and neighbours, and other social relationships and
interactions outside the family and school contexts.
Additionally, based on the strong association of abuse
and violence victimisation (within and outside the family
context) and self-harm [11, 92–94], we created a separ-
ate category, abuse and violence, to capture all factors
related to psychological, physical, emotional, and sexual
abuse items.

Results are shown in Table 4. Common examples of as-
sociations included, at the personal
level, depression,
hopelessness and psychiatric illness; at the family level,
conflict with parents, parental divorce; at school level,
academic failure, and for the interpersonal level, relation-
ship breakups and problems, and lack of social support.
Abuse and violence-related factors included sexual abuse,
dating violence, bullying, and physical fights. Only one
study reported risk factors related to self-harm [56], while
no study reported protective factors against self-harm.

Because of the substantial heterogeneity in samples,
definition and measurement of associations, we regard
any attempt at comparison or pooling of the reported

prevalences of these associations (as opposed to simply
their presence or absence) as potentially misleading. We
noted, however, the proportion of included studies that
reported associations in each category as follows: Per-
sonal = 41 / 48; Family = 31 / 48; Interpersonal = 24 / 48;
Abuse and violence = 19 / 48; School = 13 / 48.

We further categorised the self-reported reasons for
self-harm into “intrapersonal” (i.e., reasons intended to
change one’s state or circumstances), and “interpersonal”
(i.e., reasons intended to change the state or circum-
stances of significant others). Eight (10·8%) studies in-
cluded self-reported reasons for self-harm – see Table 5.
Five of these were clinic-based, [22–24, 26, 88] while
three were non-clinic based [27, 29, 50].

Across the eight studies reporting reasons for self-
harm, participants concurrently reported both intraper-
sonal and interpersonal reasons for engaging in self-
harm with no clear pattern discernible.

The findings of the prevalence studies regarding asso-
ciates of self-harm were mixed in terms of age, although
more reported higher estimates among young people be-
tween the ages of 15 and 17 years, compared to those
aged 14 years and below, and 18 years or above [35, 39,
43, 73].

The majority of the prevalence studies reported higher
estimates among female adolescents than in male adoles-
cents [30, 34, 40, 45, 58, 59, 61, 62, 65, 73, 78], although
seven studies (12·7%) found higher prevalence estimates
in male adolescents [33, 35, 37, 52, 55, 67, 77].

Discussion
There are clearly problems with the literature we found.
Despite the number of reported studies, and the ex-
tended search, we identified research from fewer than
40% (18/46) of the countries across the sub-region, and
half of all studies came from one country – South Africa.
This represents a serious gap in our knowledge about
population mental health in those countries from which
research is missing.

the widespread use of

The reported prevalence estimates showed consider-
able variations within and between the countries and
sub-regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Undoubtedly, real
variations are likely to exist but there must also be
methodological reasons to explain, for example, that
estimates of lifetime prevalence appear lower than 12-
month prevalence. One explanation is the origin and
contextual relevance of
the measures used by the
studies, and the lack of consistency in definitions and
choice of measures across studies. In this respect it is
worth noting
term
“attempted suicide” in studies which did not explain
the term to those responding to the question. The
consequence is that studies cannot be reliably cate-
gorised as reporting the prevalence of suicidal or
non-suicidal behaviour. For example – as shown on
Table 5 respondents in a study about “attempted sui-
cide” might report that they intended to die as the
result of an act while others might report that the act
was intended to prevent suicide, or that the act was
designed to change the nature of their relationships
with others. We found no substantial study where
participants were asked in detail about reasons for
self-harm, after responding with an initial affirmative

the

to a question about attempted suicide. Respondent
bias due to the illegality, sensitivity, stigma, and taboo
against suicide and other self-destructive behaviours
in Africa [98] is likely to vary according to how and
by whom inquiries were made.

Even so, the median 12-month prevalence estimate of
16·9% (IQR: 11·5% – 25·5%), and median 6-month preva-
lence estimate of 18·2% (IQR: 12·7% – 21·8%) particularly
had reasonably narrow confidence intervals. What is strik-
ing is that these figures are of the same order as those re-
ported from Europe and North America, as is the finding
that young women report more self-harm than young
men. Similarly, methods of self-harm were similar with
overdose of medication frequently reported in clinic-based
studies, while self-cutting was the predominant method
reported in the non-clinic based studies.

Generally, the studies reported multiple factors to be
associated with self-harm at the personal level - sex, age,
depression, hopelessness, psychiatric illness, alcohol and
illicit drug use, at the family level - conflict with parents,
at school-level - academic failure, bullying victimisation,
truancy, and at the interpersonal level - breakup, sexual
and physical abuse, romantic relationship problems, so-
cial support.

Various forms of abuse and violence victimisation oc-
curring in the family, school, and interpersonal contexts
were also reported. It was not possible to tell from all
the studies we reviewed how often relationship problems
in family, school, or social groups was marked by vio-
lence or abuse, but the circumstances of life in Ghana
suggests the possibility of frequent exposure to such ex-
periences. Relative to high-income countries, these cir-
cumstances are arguably likely to be more common in

sub-Saharan Africa due to poverty, unemployment,
death of parents (to AIDS), physical and sexual abuses –
including (forced) child marriage – displacement by
wars and conflicts, substance use and abuse (due to less
than ideally regulated access to prescription medication),
family conflict, among others [99, 100]. Under the cir-
cumstances, it is surprising that rates are not higher in
African studies.

exploitation, exclusion from education, unemployment,
and exclusion from decision making [11, 101]. Thus, as
found in regional reviews of studies involving adult sam-
ples [11, 12] and psychological autopsy studies of suicide
in Africa [102, 103], self-harm and suicide among women
has been interpreted as protestation against socially sanc-
tioned abuse and oppressive control, while men’s self-
harm and suicide represent a quest for lost masculinity.

Findings from the qualitative studies in this review sug-
gest some reasons for the high levels of self-harm among
young people: entrenched cultural and family rules of
comportment and norms of obedience and respect and
the sense of powerlessness experienced by both boys and
girls as linked to self-harm [22–24, 27, 32]. The higher
prevalence estimates in females have been attributed to
socially and religiously sanctioned oppression and ex-
ploitative normative gender role discrimination against
women and girls [101]. Compared to young males, young
females tend to be victims of more domestic chore bur-
and
dens,

caretaking responsibilities,

sexual

abuse

Strengths and limitations of this review
Our comprehensive search strategy identified a substan-
tial literature in a previously under-reviewed geograph-
ical area. Of
the 74 studies, 12 (16·2%) were peer-
reviewed articles exclusively indexed in the African re-
gional academic databases searched. These 12 papers
represent a valuable addition to previous reports cover-
ing parts of sub-Saharan Africa [10].

Our categorisation of the factors associated with self-
harm into personal, family, school,
level
factors was motivated by the wide variation and the

general lack of meaningful classification of these factors
across the studies and is not without limitations. For ex-
ample, in terms of the factors associated with self-harm,
there is likely to be significant inherent interdependence
between, for example, personal level factors and family
level factors – family factors could be influencing the
onset of the personal level factors and vice-versa – or
between personal, school and interpersonal levels. The
categorisation into intrapersonal and interpersonal fac-
tors too is therefore likely to be subject to considerable
interdependence.

Future directions
Future studies should explore the prevalence estimates
of self-harm among young people in non-clinical con-
texts such as the community and schools [6–8]. Partici-
pants in such prevalence studies should include other
minority and vulnerable groups of young people includ-
ing the homeless, and other out-of-school children and
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)
youth;
youth; orphans, and other children and youth in espe-
cially difficult circumstances including those with dis-
ability
and in juvenile detention, who are often
unrepresented or under-represented in population based
studies on issues affecting young people [27, 33]. Re-
cently, evidence of
from sub-
Saharan Africa – and across the African continent, gen-
erally – indicates that the population of young people
reporting LGBT and other sexual minority orientation is
growing [104]. However, studies on their (mental) health
needs are limited [99, 100].

school-based studies

Recent systematic reviews and primary studies from
high-income countries indicate that street-connected
children and adolescents represent a good case example
of a high-risk group whose self-harm has received inad-
equate attention in the recent research literature [105].
In carrying out future studies, researchers should clearly
define self-harm and more importantly, present to par-
ticipants the operational definition used in the study, in
order to facilitate recall and accurate responses.

should

studies)

qualitative

More examination is needed of risk-factors for self-
harm, not least in attempting to identify the temporal
sequence of reported associations to help clarify inter-
dependence between such factors. Future research (in-
consider
cluding
exploring factors such as social support, parenting styles,
and school climate, which serve to protect young people
in sub-Saharan Africa from engaging in self-harm. Such
research can inform programmes aimed at strengthening
protective and promotive factors within families and
schools, and at local community levels can have signifi-
cant positive effects on improving the developmental
outcomes of vulnerable young people [106].

also

Too much research into risk and protective factors in
self-harm has used concepts and measures developed in
high income countries. We need to know more about
specific features of life in sub-Saharan countries.

Conclusion
Together, the studies in this review suggest that self-harm
is a public (mental) health challenge in young people
across countries within sub-Saharan Africa. Given what
we know about the link between self-harm and poor men-
tal health, impaired social function and increased suicide
risk, more research into the epidemiology, causes and
treatment of self-harm in this setting is justified. Too few
studies from too few countries have examined the
methods of self-harm, risks, protective factors, and the
reasons associated with self-harm from a culturally and
socially sensitive perspective. The findings of the reviewed
studies were overly influenced by the use of pre-existing
Western derived models and measures.
