Abstract

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that disproportionately affects military veterans, 
is associated with heightened rates of aggression and suicide. Although experience with firearms is 
common among this population, virtually nothing is known regarding who is more likely to own a 
firearm and whether firearm ownership is differentially associated with psychological and 
behavioral risk factors among veterans with PTSD. Of 465 veterans (79% male) entering PTSD 
treatment, 28% owned a firearm (median number of firearms among owners = 3, range 1-40). 
Firearm owners reported higher income, were less likely to be unemployed, and were more likely 
to be male, Caucasian, married, and living in permanent housing. Ownership was associated with 
higher combat exposure and driving aggression, yet lower rates of childhood and military sexual 
trauma, suicidal ideation, and incarceration. Ownership was not associated with previous suicide 
attempt, arrest history, number of traumas experienced, PTSD symptoms, or depression. Together, 
among a sample of treatment-seeking military veterans with PTSD, those who owned a firearm 
appeared to demonstrate greater stability across a number of domains of functioning. Importantly 
though, routine firearm safety discussions (e.g., accessibility restrictions; violence risk 
assessments) and bolstering of anger management skills remain critical when working with this 
high-risk population.

Military veterans and individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are at 
increased risk for aggressive behavior and suicide, compared to civilians and those without 
PTSD1-4. Further, compared to other psychiatric populations, veterans with PTSD have been 
found to possess more firearms and to more frequently engage in potentially dangerous 
firearm-related behaviors5,6. This is concerning as, compared to civilians, veterans are more 
likely to complete suicide with a firearm2,7, and access to firearms is associated with higher 
risk of suicide above and beyond the effect of psychiatric illness8. Veterans with PTSD also 
demonstrate higher levels of anger, hostility, and aggression than those without PTSD9, 
which may render firearm possession particularly problematic among this population.

Although firearm experience and ownership is common among treatment-seeking 
veterans10,11, very little is known regarding which individual factors are associated with 
firearm ownership (i.e., demographic characteristics), or whether there are differential 
associations between ownership and psychological and behavioral risk factors. Such 
information is critical to better inform screening practices, risk assessment, [suicide] means-
restriction counseling, and institutional policies among a population who may professionally 
and culturally identify with firearm ownership12. To date, the current study represents the 
first attempt to offer a comprehensive demographic and psychological profile associated 
with firearm ownership among veterans with PTSD.

METHODS

Participants and Procedure

Measures

Participants were 465 military veterans entering a residential PTSD treatment facility at a 
large VA Medical Center. Past month abstinence from alcohol and illicit substances was a 
requirement of treatment intake, during which time patients also completed the 
questionnaires described below.

Demographic Characteristics and Firearm Ownership—Patients completed a 
demographic questionnaire that assessed age, education, race/ethnicity, household income, 
employment, housing, marital status, children, military history (era of service, number of 
deployments), and firearm ownership (number of firearms owned).

Trauma—Combat exposure, childhood trauma, number of traumas personally experienced, 
and PTSD symptom severity were assessed with the Combat Exposure Scale13 Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire14, Life Events Checklist15, and the PTSD Checklist16, respectively. 
Patients also indicated whether they served in a war zone, as well as whether they endured 
sexual harassment and/or assault while in the military.

Legal—Patients were asked whether they had ever been arrested and if so, the number of 
months they had spent in jail or prison.

Depression, Suicide, Driving Aggression—In addition to completing the Beck 
Depression Inventory17, patients were asked whether they had ever attempted and/or 
experienced serious thoughts of committing suicide (i.e., suicidal ideation). Patients also

rated the overall frequency of aggressive driving (which could include verbal outbursts/
gesturing, tail-gating/chasing/cutting-off drivers, driving intoxicated, intentionally hitting 
another object) on a 7-point rating scale (1 = never/rarely, 7 = very frequently).

RESULTS

Pearson chi-square tests, with 2-sided tests of significance, and t-tests were conducted to 
determine whether demographic characteristics and behavioral and psychological risk 
factors differed as a function of firearm ownership. Spearman correlations were performed 
instead of t-tests in the event that continuous variables were not normally distributed and 
skewness and kurtosis could not be corrected with a transformation. See Tables 1 and 2.

Twenty-eight percent of patients reported firearm ownership (median firearms among 
owners = 3, range 1-40). Firearm owners reported higher income, were less likely to be 
unemployed, and were more likely to be male, Caucasian, married, and living in permanent 
housing. Education, age, having children, era of service, and depression severity were not 
associated with ownership. Firearm owners had greater combat exposure, were more likely 
to serve in a war zone, and had a higher number of deployments. In terms of legal history, 
history of arrest did not differ as a function of firearm ownership, though time spent in jail or 
prison was inversely associated with ownership. Number of traumatic events experienced 
and PTSD symptom severity did not differ as a function of firearm ownership, though 
firearm owners had significantly lower levels of childhood trauma and were less likely to 
report sexual assault or harassment during their military service. Finally, history of a suicide 
attempt did not differ between groups, though firearm owners were less likely to have 
suicidal ideation than non-owners.

DISCUSSION

Among a sample of treatment-seeking military veterans with PTSD, those who owned a 
firearm appeared to demonstrate greater stability across a number of domains of functioning. 
Rate of ownership (28%) in the current sample was similar to that reported in a large 
national sample (n = 4,000, one-third owned a firearm)18, though significantly lower than 
reported among outpatient veteran samples (n=208, 52.6% owned a firearm)11. Consistent 
with previous research, ownership was not associated with PTSD symptom severity11 and 
counter to anecdoctal evidence, firearm ownership was not associated with hypervigalience 
symptoms. In fact, firearm ownership was associated with significantly lower levels of 
childhood and military sexual trauma. The current findings may reflect the restrictive 
requirements for obtaining a license to own a firearm, whereby individuals in the sample 
who have been convicted of a felony or placed on a psychiatric hold may have had their right 
to own a firearm limited or revoked. Of note though, firearm ownership was not associated 
with having a previous suicide attempt (p = .054) or a history of arrest, but was associated 
with spending less time in jail/prison. Underreporting of firearm ownership among this 
subset of individuals is thus a possible limitation.

The lower prevalence of suicidal ideation observed among firearm owners may reflect (1) 
increased clinician awareness of the risk that firearm ownership poses among veterans with

PTSD, (2) a subsequent focus on firearm means-restrictions counseling (e.g., restricting 
access to firearms)19 for veterans at higher risk for suicide, or (3) protective factors 
associated with firearm ownership in the current sample (i.e., marriage, stable housing, 
employment). The greater frequency of aggressive driving observed among firearm owners 
warrants concern, and suggests that bolstering anger management skills to curtail anti-social 
behavior is an important treatment target. Given that firearm ownership was associated with 
greater combat exposure, veterans with PTSD and combat experience may benefit from 
additional clinical screening around firearm ownership and keeping practices.

Adjunctive qualitative research efforts may help yield a better understanding of the role of 
firearm possession in the veteran subculture (e.g., protective purposes, recreational uses) and 
potential cultural, legal, and practical barriers to implementing firearm safety measures12. 
Although the current study offers an important first step with descriptive analyses, future 
studies should prospectively examine these demographic and psychological associations, 
with particular focus on the relations between firearm ownership and impulsivity, 
interpersonal aggression, and suicidal ideation. An emphasis on firearm ownership and 
suicide is especially important as the observed lifetime rate of suicidal ideation in the current 
sample was 5.9 times higher than the general population20. Identifying individual risk 
factors for suicide, means restriction counseling, and reducing stigma often associated with 
suicide ideation are known to be efficacious suicide prevention techniques for this high risk 
population (for further information on suicide prevention strategies see 21,22,23).

The current study consisted of treatment seeking veterans and thus may not be representative 
of the larger population of veterans with PTSD. There is some evidence to suggest that 
veterans with PTSD within the VA health care system utilize more health services compared 
to those without PTSD24 and this is also observed in other civilian populations25. Less is 
known regarding whether there are differences in demographic and psychosocial 
characteristics among veterans with PTSD who elect to seek treatment versus those who do 
not (e.g.26). Additional research is needed to replicate and expand these findings in other 
clinical populations, including veterans from different geographical areas and those who are 
not currently treatment seeking. In addition, future research should extend to include firearm 
possession as well as keeping behaviors (i.e., storage and safety practices). In summary, 
institutional violence risk assessment training27, firearm accessibility restriction 
interventions (e.g., storage outside the home; separating ammunition from the firearm), and 
firearm safety discussions (e.g., use of gun locks) remain critical when working with this 
vulnerable, high-risk population.
