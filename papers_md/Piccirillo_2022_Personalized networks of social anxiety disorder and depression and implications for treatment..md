Personalized networks of social anxiety disorder and depression 
and implications for treatment

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are, collectively, the 
most prevalent psychiatric disorders impacting young adults, particularly women (Leach et 
al., 2008; Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994), and typically onset in adolescence and early 
adulthood (Acarturk et al., 2008; Kessler et al., 2005). The cumulative interpersonal risk 
model describes a diathesis-stress model of SAD leading to MDD via maladaptive social 
processes and stressful interpersonal outcomes, such as withdrawal and social rejection, that 
occur during childhood and adolescence (Epkins & Heckler, 2011; Starr et al., 2014).

The comorbidity of these two disorders has been described by the tripartite model and 
the integrative hierarchical models in which SAD and MDD are characterized by higher 
levels of negative affect (Clark & Watson, 1991) and lower levels of positive affect (Mineka 
et al., 1998). These factors plausibly interact with each other over time to maintain the 
comorbidity. For example, researchers have demonstrated that anxious and depressed moods 
broadly predict each other within the day (Jacobson, 2015). However, we are still limited in 
our ability to effectively prevent and treat this cycle of symptomatology. Some research on 
psychotherapy for SAD and MDD comorbidity has demonstrated that successful treatment 
of SAD also mitigates depressive symptoms (Erwin et al., 2002; Moscovitch et al., 2005), 
suggesting that targeting factors specific to social anxiety, such as avoidance of social 
situations (Morrison & Heimberg, 2013), may be of particular use for successfully treating 
this comorbidity. Yet even with well-tested cognitive behavioral therapies for both disorders 
(Beck, 2011; Hambrick et al., 2003), this comorbidity persists, suggesting that more research 
is needed to determine additional methods for assessing and treating this comorbidity.

One barrier to successful treatment of this comorbidity may be in part due to our methods 
that have prioritized the examination of group-level effects. Clinical psychologists have 
historically used cross-sectional or longitudinal designs to identify risk factors for the 
group. Arguably, these risk factors may be non-significant, or even protective, for specific

individuals within the group (see Molenaar, 2004) limiting the utility of prevention and 
treatment efforts based on these factors (Hamaker, 2012; Molenaar, 2004). The use of 
person-specific (i.e., individual-level or idiographic) methods in conjunction with multilevel 
methods advances our potential to provide personalized directives to improve prevention and 
treatment efforts (e.g., Fisher, 2015; Piccirillo et al., 2019; Wichers, 2014).

For example, one of the key elements of cognitive behavioral therapy for SAD focuses 
on reducing social avoidance. If we knew that physical activity was the strongest 
predictor of intra-daily anxiety for a given individual, we could offer them related clinical 
recommendations compared to focusing primarily on their social avoidance. Indeed, clinical 
researchers have demonstrated that person-specific networks vary across individuals with the 
same diagnostic profile (Fisher et al., 2017). Better characterization of the person-specific 
patterns among comorbidity-related factors would advance our ability to design, test, and 
implement personalized assessments and treatments.

With these aims in mind, we constructed both multilevel and person-specific networks of 
cognitive-affective and behavioral constructs for women experiencing comorbid SAD and 
MDD. Network analyses can be used to model the direct relationships between individual 
items in time-series (i.e., ecological momentary assessment; EMA) data. Multilevel and 
person-specific vector autoregression (VAR) models can be used to examine the complexity 
of comorbidity-related factors, respectively (Cramer et al., 2016; Wichers et al., 2015), 
informing the design of future personalized assessments and interventions for comorbidity 
(Fried & Cramer, 2017).

We collected intensive EMA data from women with SAD and a current or past depressive 
episode for 30 days, to allow for a person-specific examination of the dynamic fluctuations 
in cognitive-affective and behavioral factors related to hallmark symptoms of SAD-MDD 
comorbidity. To conduct person-specific VAR models that do not rely on data from the rest 
of the group, it is crucial to collect a sufficiently large number of observations from each 
participant (versus collecting fewer observations from more participants) (Hamaker et al., 
2005); thus we prioritized collecting over one hundred observations from each participant. 
We prioritized recruiting women as women are at increased risk for SAD-MDD comorbidity 
(Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994) and we did not expect to be able to study the differential 
effects of sex or gender due to our limited sample size. Additionally, we recruited women 
with SAD-MDD comorbidity; however, many women also met criteria for additional anxiety 
disorders. Furthermore, we did not recruit women with the full matrix of comorbidity (e.g., 
women with SAD, but not MDD or vice versa). Thus, it important to note that our study 
likely captures symptoms processes central to internalized distress, rather than SAD and 
MDD specifically.

We hypothesized that cognitive-affective factors, such as anxiety and loneliness, as well as 
maladaptive behaviors, such as avoidance of social situations, would predict depressed mood 
on the group level. We also hypothesized that person-specific patterns between these factors 
would emerge, such that no one individual would demonstrate the exact network structure as 
the group-level model. Finally, we compared individual-level estimates across the ML-VAR

and person-specific VAR models to determine the extent to which estimates differed, as 
previous research suggests that these estimates may differ (Fisher et al., 2018).

Methods

Participants

Measures

Cisgender women (N = 35) were recruited from a Midwestern university community. Most 
women (n = 26) were enrolled in undergraduate courses, whereas others were graduate 
students or employees (n = 9). Ages ranged from 18 – 37 years (M = 21.37 years, SD 
= 5.20), and most women identified as White (n = 18; 51.43%), although 10 (28.57%) 
identified as East Asian and six (17.14%) identified as Black. Furthermore, two women 
(5.71%) identified as Hispanic. Most (n =19, 54.29%) identified as heterosexual, although 
12 women (34.29% identified as bisexual and four women (11.43%) identified that they 
were questioning their sexual orientation. Information regarding socioeconomic status was 
not collected. All women met criteria for current SAD and a current (n = 6) or past (n = 
29) major depressive episode. The average woman had at least one comorbid diagnosis (M 
= 1.46, range = 0–6 comorbid diagnoses). Panic disorder was the most frequent comorbid 
diagnosis (n = 12, 34.29%), followed by agoraphobia (n = 8, 22.86%), generalized anxiety 
disorder (n = 8, 22.86%), and alcohol use disorder (n = 8, 22.86%).

MINI Interview – 5 (MINI; Lecrubier et al., 1997).—The MINI-5 is a brief, structured 
diagnostic interview that has demonstrated good concordance with other structured 
diagnostic interviews (Lecrubier et al., 1997; Sheehan et al., 1998) and was used to 
assess psychiatric diagnoses to determine study eligibility. Blinded independent raters rated 
randomly assigned interviews (n = 18; 51.43%) and inter-rater reliability was good for SAD 
(κ = .73); excellent for a MDE (κ = .83).

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) items.—Participants completed 14 EMA 
items during each assessment (see Table 1). Items, such as anxiety, loneliness, and social 
avoidance were selected as they represented hallmark symptoms of SAD (e.g., anxiety), 
were theoretical factors related to comorbidity (e.g., loneliness; Epkins & Heckler, 2011), 
or were treatment-related factors (e.g., social avoidance; Heimberg, 2002). Additional 
items, such as sadness, pleasure, and restlessness were included as they reflect DSM-5 
diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Additionally, physiological or behavioral factors that may impact mood, such as hunger 
and physical activity, were included. Participants rated all questions based on their present-
moment experience (e.g., Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007; Shiffman, Stone, & 
Hufford, 2008). Items were administered using a 0 – 10 integer sliding scale (Hektner et al., 
2007).1 It was estimated that the entire survey took less than three minutes per assessment.

1There was an error in the scale creation of two EMA items that affected two participants in the sample. These participants used a 0 
– 100 integer sliding scale instead of a 0 – 10 integer sliding scale. Responses from these two items were collapsed to form a 0 – 10 
integer scale (i.e., a 70 was converted to a 7).

Procedure

Page 4

Participants were eligible if they were cisgender women who met diagnostic criteria for 
SAD and a current or past MDE, had access to a smartphone, and expected to be able 
to return to the laboratory for a second clinical interview in approximately 2–3 months. 
Participants were excluded if they were imminently at risk for harm to self or others. 
Eligible participants provided informed consent before enrolling and all study procedures 
were approved by the university’s Institution Review Board. Participants first completed 
a brief training protocol for providing EMA assessments before beginning the study and 
completed brief self-report surveys give times a day (i.e., every three hours) during a 
self-selected 12-hour period for 30 days (approximately 150 assessments for each woman). 
Participants received weekly progress emails and received a preliminary version of their 
person-specific model in addition to monetary compensation. Maximum compensation was 
$82.50 for 100% completion of EMA surveys.

Data Analytic Procedure

Our main aim was to examine patterns between SAD-MDD comorbidity-related factors 
using multilevel (ML-VAR) and person-specific VAR models. We also determined the 
influence of each item in network by calculating the weighted sum of paths from one node 
to the rest of the network (node-level expected influence; Robinaugh et al., 2016). Finally, 
we were interested in examining the extent to which individual-level estimates generated 
from the multilevel model differed from the estimates generated from the person-specific 
models. To maintain brevity, we present an overview of our data analytic procedure here and 
provide additional details on our data analytic procedure within the supplementary material.

Prior to all study analyses, linear trends of time were accounted for by regressing the EMA 
items onto the time variables and the residuals from this preliminary model were used in the 
following analyses (e.g., Fisher et al., 2017; Wichers et al., 2020).2 Network analyses largely 
consist of partial correlations and regressions; thus we calculated first order correlations to 
determine the extent to which high overlap or correlations between EMA items may pose 
a concern for multicollinearity within the model (Fried & Cramer, 2017). There were three 
items that were highly correlated – feeling down, feeling happy, and feeling pleased (|r|s = 
.57 – .59). To reduce the effects of multicollinearity, we reverse scored feeling happy and 
feeling pleased and created an average composite between these three items to represent 
depressed mood.

We used two different network analytic techniques to examine partial relationships between 
EMA variables (i.e., residuals from each EMA item predicting the other item residuals) 
within the day. We specified time variables in our model to avoid predicting across night 
periods, given that VAR models assume equal amounts of time between assessments. 
To model group-level relationships, we used ML-VAR (Epskamp et al., 2018). ML-VAR 

2Further inspection of time trends suggested that residualizing data to remove linear trends may not have been necessary, as many 
individuals’ data did not display clear (or linear) trends of time. However, some individual’s data demonstrated trends that were 
nonlinear (e.g., cyclic) in nature. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to remove nonlinear trends by fitting a loess model. Results from 
these models were largely similar to the models in which a linear trend was removed. Thus, we report results from the main analyses 
removing the linear trend and include plots from models removing the nonlinear trend in supplementary material (Figures S2, S3).

disaggregates within and between-person effects by using the within-subjects centered 
variables as predictors for other within-subjects variables and by using the between-subjects 
centered variables (i.e., sample means) as predictors for the other between-subject variables. 
ML-VAR outputs two multilevel models. The first model demonstrates the contemporaneous 
or partial associations between variables. The second model demonstrates the temporal or 
partial regressive relationships (e.g., values from the previous time point) predicting values 
at the next time point (i.e., three hours later). The estimates from contemporaneous and 
temporal models reflect the effect size of these relationships. We also constructed person-
specific VAR models for each participant using the graphicalVAR package (Epskamp, 
2018). Similar to ML-VAR, the estimates from contemporaneous and temporal models 
reflect the effect size of these relationships.

The role and influence of individual EMA variables within the network was characterized 
further by examining network centrality statistics. We calculated the one-step expected 
influence for each variable in the contemporaneous models (the weighted sum of the paths 
between a given variable and the rest of the network) to determine the impact that each 
variable has on the rest of the network (Robinaugh et al., 2016). For the temporal ML-VAR 
network, we calculated both the outward expected influence, which is the weighted sum of 
the pathways between one node predicting other nodes at the next time point, as well as 
the inward expected influence, which is the weighted sum of pathways that predict a given 
node at the next time point. As the temporal models were sparse, we focus our interpretation 
of centrality findings using the estimates from the contemporaneous models. Finally, we 
calculated the node predictability from contemporaneous individual-level networks (see 
supplementary material).

One of the assumptions of multilevel modeling (e.g., ML-VAR) is that each individual is 
part of the same group; the multilevel model borrows information from other participants 
when estimating the effects for specific individuals. Previous researchers have demonstrated 
that group-level models may not adequately reflect individual-level effects (see Molenaar, 
2004), thus. Given that a majority of participants completed over 100 surveys (TMean = 
125.43, TSD = 19.26), we sought to construct person-specific networks for each individual 
that do not rely on the group-level data for their estimation. To further test the extent 
to which individuals differed from the group, we compared the individual-level estimates 
derived from the ML-VAR models to the individual-level estimates derived from the person-
specific VAR models.3 This comparison illustrates the extent to which individual-level 
effects generated from person-specific VAR models correlate with the individual-level 
predictions generated from ML-VAR models (i.e., models that use information borrowed 
from the group). Large overlap or correlation between these estimates would suggest that the 
multilevel model uses assumptions that reflect the underlying group structure.

All study analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2017) and code for all analyses 
is included in the supplementary material. To examine the stability of our ML-VAR model 
(especially given our relatively small sample size), we randomly selected 80% of the sample 

3We calculated unregularized person-specific VAR models and compared the estimates from these models with the individual-level 
estimates from the ML-VAR model as the individual-level estimates from ML-VAR are not regularized.

(n = 28) to construct a ML-VAR network, which we resampled 100 times. We examined 
the correlations between the expected influence centrality estimates from the original and 
resampled networks. Correlations were large, ranging from r = .68 to r = .97, suggesting that 
our results were stable.

Notably, we originally conducted these analyses using a different, but comparable, method 
(dynamic structural equation modeling) achieving largely similar results. We explain the 
differences between the two analytic methods, our rationale for our revised approach, and 
briefly summarize our previous findings in supplementary material.

Results

Aim 1: Examining group-level factors that characterize SAD-MDD comorbidity

In the group-level contemporaneous (i.e., associative) model, feeling lonely exhibited the 
largest expected influence (EI = 0.63), followed by feeling calm (EI = −0.54) and depressed 
mood (EI = 0.52), suggesting that these items exhibited the most connections to other 
nodes in the contemporaneous network and therefore exerted the most influence on the 
rest of the network. For example, feeling lonely was associated with depressed mood, 
feeling drowsy, and greater social avoidance. Feeling calm was associated with feeling more 
drowsy and less restless, anxious, and irritated, as well as lower depressed mood. Finally, 
depressed mood was significantly and positively associated with feeling anxious, irritated, 
and was also associated with greater avoidance of social situations. Depressed mood was 
also significantly and negatively associated with physical activity and feeling accomplished. 
The contemporaneous effects can be found in Table S1 and Figure 1.

Examining the group-level temporal relationships revealed that depressed mood (EI = −0.19) 
and feeling calm (EI = −0.11) exhibited the largest outward expected influence. That 
is, these nodes exhibited the strongest connections to other nodes in the network at the 
following time point. In contrast, social avoidance (EI = 0.13) and feeling drowsy (EI = 
0.13) had the largest inwards expected influence, suggesting that these constructs were the 
most influenced or predicted by other nodes within the temporal network. Furthermore, 
there were significant autoregressive relationships suggesting that most variables predicted 
themselves at the next time point, except for feeling hungry.

Depressed mood predicted several other variables, such as feeling more anxious, more 
irritable, as well as feeling less accomplished, less focused, and less physical activity. 
Social avoidance was predicted by feeling lonely and feeling drowsy; feeling drowsy was 
predicted by feeling hungry and by amount of physical activity. Interestingly, there were no 
statistically significant relationships between feeling anxious and social avoidance over time; 
however, avoiding social situations predicted depressed mood later. The temporal effects can 
be found in Table S2 and in Figure 1.

Aim 2: Examining person-specific factors that characterize SAD-MDD comorbidity

Across all person-specific VAR models, feeling sad appeared to be the item with the 
highest expected influence for the most people (n = 13; 37.14%), followed by feeling 
calm (n = 9; 25.71%). Feeling lonely (the item with the largest expected influence in the

contemporaneous group-level model) exhibited the largest expected influence for only four 
women’s models. All person-specific models are presented in Figures S1, S2.

The most common statistically significant path was a positive association between feeling 
sad and feeling lonely (n = 29; 82.86%). Only about half of the women displayed a positive, 
statistically significant partial association between feeling sad and feeling anxious (n = 10; 
54.29%). Interestingly, only one woman’s model suggested a negative contemporaneous 
association between feeling anxious and avoiding social situations and no person-specific 
temporal models demonstrated a relationship between feeling anxious and avoiding social 
situations. Temporal VAR models were sparse – the most common paths were autoregressive 
effects for feeling sad, feeling accomplished, and avoiding social situations (each n = 3; 
8.57%). To more closely examine person-specific differences, we chose three women who 
completed the most assessments (T = 146 – 148) and have highlighted results from their 
person-specific models below. Their contemporaneous effects are listed in Table S1 and 
models displayed in Figure 2.

The first woman met criteria for SAD, MDD Recurrent, and panic disorder. For her, feeling 
lonely exhibited the highest expected influence (EI = 0.30) followed by feeling focused (EI 
= 0.27), suggesting that these constructs were the most connected to other nodes in the 
contemporaneous network. Feeling lonely was positively associated with depressed mood 
and avoidance of social situations. Depressed mood was negatively associated with feeling 
accomplished and amount of physical activity since the last assessment. Social avoidance 
was negatively associated with feeling less accomplished. Finally, depressed mood exhibited 
a positive autoregressive effect.

The second woman met criteria for SAD, past MDD, and SUD. Feeling calm exhibited 
the largest expected influence (EI = −0.72) on her contemporaneous network, followed 
by depressed mood (EI = 0.54). Her contemporaneous model demonstrated that feeling 
calm was negatively associated with depressed mood, feeling irritable, feeling anxious, 
and feeling restless. Furthermore, depressed mood was positively associated with feeling 
irritable, anxious, lonely, and feeling (less) accomplished. Feeling anxious was associated 
with feeling more irritable and less accomplished. Feeling lonely was positively associated 
with social avoidance and feeling drowsy. Both depressed mood and social avoidance 
exhibited positive autoregressive effects.

Finally, the third woman met criteria for SAD, recurrent MDD, and AUD. For her, feeling 
anxious exhibited the largest expected influence (EI = −0.31), followed by depressed mood 
(EI = 0.25). Accordingly, feeling anxious was negatively associated with feeling calm and 
social avoidance. Additionally, depressed mood was associated with feeling more irritated, 
feeling more drowsy, and feeling less accomplished. Finally, there were no statistically 
significant temporal effects.

Aim 3: Comparing group-level and person-specific model estimates

Finally, we compared the individual-level estimates generated from the ML-VAR model to 
the individual-level estimates obtained from the person-specific VAR models to determine 
the extent to which both methods produced similar person-specific estimates. Larger

correlations or overlap in distributions would suggest that the multilevel model uses 
assumptions about individuals within the group that correspond to the person-specific 
models. Overall, the correlations between the contemporaneous individual-level estimates 
across the two sources for each pathway and for each person were large (rs = .68 – 93; 
see Table 2), as were the correlations between the autoregressive individual-level estimates 
derived from the ML-VAR models and the autoregressive estimates derived from the person-
specific VAR models (rs = .70 – 91). We also examined the correlations between the 
individual-level adjacency matrices from the person-specific VAR models and the ML-VAR 
models; correlations ranged in size but were large on average (rs = .19 – .93, rmean = .75) 
and the strength of this correlation varied as a function of missingness (r = −.79). However, 
these strong correlations do not mean that the parameters were equivalent across methods. 
When plotting the distribution of the estimates across methods, the shape and spread of the 
distribution of autoregressive effects varied across effects (see Figure 3, Figure S5), with 
person-specific methods producing a consistently wider spread of estimated effects.

Discussion

We constructed models of SAD-MDD comorbidity-related factors and demonstrated that 
the relationships between symptoms like depressed mood or anxiety varied greatly for each 
woman with this comorbidity. We hypothesized that factors such as anxiety, loneliness, and 
social avoidance would predict depressed mood over time and that each person-specific VAR 
model would demonstrate individual-level differences. We constructed contemporaneous 
and temporal ML-VAR models to evaluate the intra-daily interactions between cognitive-
affective and behavioral variables that maintain SAD-MDD comorbidity demonstrating 
that depressed mood, feeling lonely, and feeling calm had the highest expected influence, 
accounting for many of the pathways in the contemporaneous model and demonstrating 
stronger connections to other constructs in the temporal model. Furthermore, avoiding social 
situations and feeling drowsy appeared to be the items that were the most influenced by 
other variables in the network over time. Overall, our results largely matched our hypotheses 
and results seen from other network analyses of comorbid anxiety and depression (see Groen 
et al., 2020). Specifically, depressed mood was strongly connected to other mood states (e.g., 
feeling irritated), cognitive states (e.g., feeling accomplished), and behavioral states (e.g., 
physical activity) over time, but avoiding social situations was more influenced by other 
variables (rather than a predictor of other variables) – at least when measured every three 
hours in women with comorbid SAD and MDD.

Examining the contemporaneous ML-VAR model suggested that depressed mood appeared 
to be strongly associated with other affective variables, such as feeling anxious, lonely, 
and irritable, in addition to physiological symptoms (e.g., feeling drowsy) and behavioral 
variables, such as avoiding social situations. These results suggest that the intensity of 
depressed mood within the day – versus the intensity of feeling anxious or the amount 
to which an individual avoids social situations – may carry the most interpretative value 
in understanding what else women with SAD-MDD comorbidity may be experiencing 
at a given point in time. When considering cognitive-behavioral skills for treating SAD-
MDD comorbidity, these results suggest that targeting depressed mood may have a more

widespread effect on related symptoms, versus focusing on anxiety or other related factors in 
isolation.

Additionally, the temporal ML-VAR model revealed that feeling lonely predicted increased 
depressed mood and greater social avoidance later, clarifying our understanding of the 
role of loneliness in understanding SAD-MDD comorbidity. For example, the cumulative 
interpersonal risk model (Epkins & Heckler, 2011) and evidence from additional 
longitudinal work (Lim et al., 2016) highlight the unique associations of loneliness with 
social anxiety and depression, particularly for adolescent women. Our results extend this 
work by demonstrating that loneliness also predicts depressed mood and greater social 
avoidance within the day. Thus, skills targeting loneliness (e.g., interpersonal strategies, 
cognitive restructuring) in addition to skills targeting depressed mood may be more 
impactful at resolving symptoms over time.

It was somewhat surprising that avoiding social situations predicted greater depressed mood 
versus greater anxiety within the day, given that all women in this study were diagnosed 
with SAD and the anxiety-avoidance relationship is considered a hallmark of the disorder 
(Heimberg, 2002; Heimberg et al., 2014). Although there was some variance in the social 
avoidance item, suggesting that women were engaging in avoidance throughout the month, 
an additional reason for this contradictory finding could be due to the timescale with which 
constructs were measured. For example, we measured constructs over the course of three 
hours. However, it is likely that many individuals would experience lower levels of anxiety 
occurring immediately following avoidance on the timescale of seconds or minutes and 
that avoidance would predict greater anxiety later on the timescale of hours or day(s). 
Furthermore, we hypothesize the length of time that this negative relationship persists would 
vary across individuals (based on other trait level characteristics) and within individuals 
(based on the level of anxiety experienced and type of event avoided). Alternatively, our 
EMA item measured anxiety broadly and, thus, this item may have lacked the construct 
validity needed to accurately reflect the relationship with avoidance of social situations 
specifically. Future research using EMA over varying periods of time would be helpful in 
further understanding the dynamics between anxiety and avoidance behavior.

Consistent with our second aim, we found considerable individual-level variability across 
the person-specific VAR models. For example, although loneliness was a highly influential 
item in the contemporaneous group-level network, it was rarely a highly influential item 
within the individual-level models. Furthermore, there was a strong association between 
feeling sad and feeling anxious on the group-level; however, this association was significant 
for just over half of the women, suggesting that for many women, their depressed mood and 
anxiety may not be as closely associated.

Examining the exemplar person-specific models demonstrated that for one woman, engaging 
in more physical activity since the last time point was associated with feeling less sad. 
Thus, her clinician might recommend maintaining a regular activity or exercise routine 
to assist with managing her mood. Furthermore, her model also demonstrated that when 
she avoided social situations, she (understandably) felt less anxious, but also felt less 
accomplished. Her clinician might be able to use this information to help illustrate

cognitive-behavioral principles and validate that avoiding social situations reduces anxiety 
in the moment, while also demonstrating that avoiding social situations is associated with 
feeling less accomplished. Moreover, for this woman, feeling less accomplished was also 
associated with increased depressed mood– building additional rationale for targeting social 
avoidance as a intervention for increasing positive affect and managing mood. These 
findings contribute to a growing field of evidence suggesting that personalized EMA 
feedback can improve outcomes from standard psychological interventions (Kramer et al., 
2014; Simons et al., 2015). Future work is necessary to continue the translational process 
of implementing these findings into clinical practice. For example, clinical researchers have 
developed web-based platforms to integrate client and clinician input into these models 
advancing implementation (PREMISE, Burger et al., 2021; PETRA, Riese et al., 2021). 
Additional implementation efforts could develop mobile platforms to support individuals 
engaging in self-help or fully digital-based interventions.

The comparison between the individual-level estimates generated from the person-specific 
VAR models and the individual-level estimates generated from the ML-VAR model 
also provides some guidance for how clinical researchers can utilize intensive EMA 
to personalize assessment and interventions going forward. Practically, ML-VAR models 
require fewer observations from each individual; therefore, building a multilevel framework 
to provide individual-level estimates to guide personalized assessment and treatment could 
be easier to implement in clinical and applied settings (i.e., patients would be required 
to do less intensive EMA to generate personalized feedback). Accordingly, results from 
the third aim comparing individual-level estimates suggested that, on average, there were 
large correlations between the individual-level estimates obtained from the ML-VAR and 
person-specific VAR models. Similarly, unpublished data from a previous study suggested 
that multilevel models that model individual-level variability with greater specificity (i.e., 
a greater number of random paths and error terms) produce estimates that correlate 
moderately to highly with estimates from person-specific models (Rodebaugh et al., 2020).

However, the shape and spread of the distributions for the individual-level estimates were 
large, suggesting that for some individuals there was a clear difference in the predicted 
individual-level estimates from the multilevel model versus the person-specific model. In 
part, the spread of the distributions for the individual-level estimates from the multilevel 
model were consistently smaller, as is to be expected due to the shrinkage that occurs 
due to assuming a similar probability distribution during the model estimation process. 
Additionally, the larger spread in the individual-level estimates from the person-specific 
models is almost certainly a result of lower statistical power in the person-specific models. 
Still, for some effects (e.g., the contemporaneous effect between depressed mood and feeling 
lonely, autoregressive effect of depressed mood, cross-lagged effect of depressed mood and 
feeling irritable) there seemed to be a clear difference in the shape of the distributions. 
Thus, a complementary hypothesis could be that the multilevel model is making different 
assumptions about the individual when generating their estimates by assuming that all 
individuals are part of a shared distribution. This assumption may not be adequate for 
all individuals within the group, limiting the generalizability of our theoretical models to 
specific individuals and hindering our ability to provide accurate, personalized care.

The limitations of this study assist in outlining next steps for research on intensive EMA 
design and personalization. For example, these results reflect the relationships that are 
demonstrated when items are sampled every three hours; however, the time course of mood, 
symptoms, and emotional experiences likely varies on an individual level (Bosley & Fisher, 
2020; Howe et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is growing increasingly evident that more intensive 
EMA assessment schedules over longer periods of time are needed to construct personalized 
models with sufficient accuracy (Mansueto et al., 2020). It may be that more time points 
are needed to find many person-specific effect; our temporal person-specific models were 
sparse, consistent with results from simulation studies (Mansueto et al., 2020) and previous 
empirical work (Frumkin et al., 2021). Although it was unclear what effects we could have 
used for an a priori power analysis, our results and results from recent work could be used 
for simulations that could properly estimate power for future analyses.

Additionally, we used single EMA items to represent many of the constructs in our 
study and reduce burden. Arguably, a stronger psychometric approach would have been 
to administer several items related to each construct (i.e., similar to the depressed mood 
composite variable). Finally, these results are descriptive in nature from women with a 
similar psychiatric profile. Thus, future research aimed at cross-validation via modeling 
across much larger groups of individuals with the full matrix of comorbid SAD-MDD (e.g., 
SAD but not MDD or vice versa), as well as work with more diverse individuals who 
share key traits or characteristics is needed to examine the robustness of network analytic 
approaches. Additionally pursuing intensive EMA within the context of experimental design 
is sorely needed to determine the extent to which individuals truly differ from the group. 
Pursuing these issues in future work will provide evidence to answer key questions in the 
field of personalization – that is, do group-level models ever fully describe individuals 
within the group, and if so, when and under what circumstances?

Our results illustrate the extent to which women with SAD-MDD comorbidity differ from 
each other and assist with advancing our understanding of how personalized models may be 
used to shape clinical case conceptualizations and treatments for specific individuals. Our 
study underscores the tremendous need for future research in this area as we move towards 
designing and testing future personalized assessments, treatments, and directives for care.

Highlights:

•

•

•

Clinical research evidence supports a call for personalized approaches to care.

Examining SAD and MDD comorbidity revealed person-specific patterns.

We discuss how personalized networks could guide behavioral interventions.

Figure 1. Contemporaneous and temporal multilevel models (ML-VAR)
Note. The contemporaneous model demonstrating partial associations is shown on the left; 
the temporal model demonstrating partial regressions is shown on the right. Blue pathways 
represent positive relationships; orange pathways represent negative relationships; the width 
of the line corresponds to the magnitude of the relationship. The extent to which the ring 
around each node is solid reflects the magnitiude of the expected influence for each node 
–nodes with larger expected influnce on the network have more a greater proportion of the 
ring shaded. For the temporal network, the light grey shading refers to outward expected 
influence; black shading refers to inward expected influence. DwnHapPls = average 
composite of Down, Happy (reverse scored), and Pleased (reverse scored); Accomplish = 
Accomplished; PhysAct = Physical Activity; Avoid = Avoiding social situations.

Figure 2. Contemporaneous person-specific models (graphicalVAR)
Note. The contemporaneous model demonstrates the individual-level partial associations 
from the person-specific VAR models for three exemplar participants. Dark blue pathways 
represent positive relationships; orange pathways represent negative relationships; the width 
of the line corresponds to the magnitude of the relationship. The extent to which the ring 
around each node is solid reflects the magnitude of the expected influence for each node – 
rings with more shading reflect nodes with larger expected influence on the network. Ex. 
= exemplar particiapnt; DwnHapPls = average composite of Down, Happy (reverse scored), 
and Pleased (reverse scored); Accomplish = Accomplished; PhysAct = Physical Activity; 
Avoid = Avoiding social situations.

Figure 3. Density plot displaying the distribution of correlations between the contemporaneous 
individual-level estimates generated from multilevel model and the contemporaneous individual-
level estimates from the person-specific VAR models.
Note. Density curves shaded in lighter grey represent the individual-level estimates from 
the ML-VAR model. Density curves shaded in darker grey represent the individual-level 
estimates from the person-specific VAR models.

Note. These values represent the correlations generated from the individual-level contemporaneous multilevel model and the estimates obtained 
from the person-specific contemporaneous models. The standard deviation for the multilevel pathway between Avoid and Restless was 0 for the 
multilevel model; thus, a correlation value was not able to be calculated for this pathway. DwnHapPls = average composite of Down, Happy 
(reverse scored), and Pleased (reverse scored); Accomplish = Accomplished; PhysAct = Physical Activity; Avoid = Avoiding social situations.
