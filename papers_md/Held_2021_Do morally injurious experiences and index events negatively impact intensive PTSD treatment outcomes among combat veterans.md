HIGHLIGHTS 
•  Treatment-seeking 
veterans  reported  high  rates 
of  morally  injurious 
experiences. 
•  Morally  injurious 
experiences  were  not 
associated  with  intensive 
PTSD  treatment  outcomes. 
•  Veterans  who  did  and  did 
not  experience  morally 
injurious  experiences 
reported  large  symptom 
reductions. 

ABSTRACT
Background:  It  has  been  suggested  that  current  frontline  posttraumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD)  treatments  are  not  effective  for  the  treatment  of  moral  injury  and  that  individuals 
who  have  experienced  morally  injurious  events  may  respond  differently  to  treatment  than 
those  who  have  not.  However,  these  claims  have  yet  to  be  empirically  tested.
Objective:  This  study  evaluated  the  rates  of  morally  injurious  event  exposure  and  morally 
injurious  index  trauma  and  their  impact  on  PTSD  (PCL-5)  and  depression  symptom  (PHQ-9) 
reductions  during  intensive  PTSD  treatment.
Method:  Data  from  161  USA  military  combat  service  members  and  veterans  (91.3%  male; 
mean age  = 39.94 years) who  participated  in  a 3-week Cognitive  Processing Therapy  (CPT)- 
based  intensive  PTSD  treatment  programme  (ITP)  was  utilized.  Morally  injurious  event 
exposure  was  established  via  the  Moral  Injury  Event  Scale  (MIES).  Index  traumas  were  also 
coded by the treating clinician. Linear mixed effects regression analyses were conducted to 
examine  if  differences  in  average  effects  or  trends  over  the  course  of  treatment  existed 
between veterans with morally injurious event exposure or index trauma and those without.
Results:  Rates  of  morally  injurious  event  exposure  in  this  treatment  sample  were  high  (59.0%- 
75.2%). Morally injurious event exposure and the type of index trauma did not predict changes in 
symptom outcomes from the ITP and veterans reported large reductions in PTSD (d = 1.35–1.96) 
and  depression  symptoms  (d  =  0.95–1.24)  from  pre-  to  post-treatment.  Non-inferiority  analyses 
also demonstrated equivalence across those with and without morally injurious event exposure 
and index events. There were no significant gender differences.
Conclusions:  The  present  study  suggests  that  PTSD  and  depression  in  military  veterans  with 
morally injurious event exposure histories may be successfully treated via a 3-week CPT-based ITP.

¿Tienen  las  experiencias  moralmente  dañinas  y  los  eventos  índices  un 
impacto negativo en los resultados del tratamiento intensivo del TEPT 
en  los  veteranos  de  combate?
Antecedentes:  Se  ha  sugerido  que  los  tratamientos  actuales  de  primera  línea  para  el 
trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  (TEPT)  no  son  efectivos  para  el  tratamiento  del  daño 
moral  y  que  las  personas  que  han  experimentado  eventos  moralmente  dañinos  pueden 
responder  de  manera  diferente  al  tratamiento  que  las  que  no  lo  han  hecho.  Sin  embargo, 
estas  afirmaciones  aún  no  se  han  probado  empíricamente.
Objetivo:  Este  estudio  evaluó  las  tasas  de  exposición  a  eventos  moralmente  dañinos 
y  trauma  índice  moralmente  dañino  y  su  impacto  en  las  reducciones  de  síntomas  del 
TEPT  (PCL-5)  y  de  depresión  (PHQ-9)  durante  el  tratamiento  intensivo  para  TEPT.
Método:  Se utilizaron datos de 161 miembros y veteranos del servicio militar de combate de los 
Estados Unidos (91,3% hombres; edad promedio = 39,94 años) que participaron en un programa de 
tratamiento  intensivo  de  TEPT  (ITP  en  su  sigla  en  inglés)  basado  en  la  Terapia  de  procesamiento 
cognitivo  (CPT  en  su  sigla  en  inglés)  durante  3  semanas.  La  exposición  a  eventos  moralmente 
dañinos se estableció mediante la Escala de eventos de daño moral (MIES en su sigla en inglés). Los 
traumas  índice  también  fueron  codificados  por  el  médico  tratante.  Se  llevaron  a  cabo  análisis  de 
regresión de efectos mixtos lineales para examinar si existían diferencias en los efectos promedio 
o  las  tendencias  durante  el  curso  de  tratamiento  en  los  veteranos  con  exposición  a  eventos 
moralmente perjudiciales o trauma índice y los que no.
Resultados:  Las  tasas  de  exposición  a  eventos  moralmente  dañinos  en  esta  muestra  de 
tratamiento  fueron  altas  (59,0%  −75,2%).  La  exposición  a  eventos  moralmente  dañinos  y  el 
tipo de trauma índice no predijeron cambios en los resultados de los síntomas de la ITP y los 
veteranos  reportaron  grandes  reducciones  en  los  síntomas  de  TEPT  (d  =  1.35-1.96)  y  de 
depresión  (d  =  0.95-1.24)  entre  el  pre-  y  post-  tratamiento.  Los  análisis  de  no  inferioridad 
también  demostraron  equivalencia  entre  aquellos  con  y  sin  exposición  a  eventos  moral-
mente  dañinos  y  eventos  índice.  No  hubo  diferencias  de  género  significativas.

1. Background

Litz and colleagues (Litz et al., 2009) define moral injury 
as reactions to ‘perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing 
witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply 
held moral beliefs and expectations’ (p. 697). Situations 
that lead to the violation of deeply held beliefs or moral 
values are referred to as morally injurious events (Nash 
et al., 2013). Morally injurious events may include acts 
of  commission  or  omission,  as  well  as  a  betrayal  by 
others  (Drescher  et  al.,  2011;  Nash  et  al.,  2013). 
Morally injurious events have been predominantly stu-
died in military contexts (cf. Frankfurt & Frazier, 2016). 
Common  examples  include  perpetration-  and  omis-
sion-based  traumas,  such  as  the  harming  or  killing  of 
non-combatants  (Hoge  et  al.,  2004;  Maguen  et  al., 
2010),  and  witnessing  but  failing  to  prevent  adverse 
events (Griffin et al., 2019), which also fit the definition 
of a Criterion A traumatic event according to the DSM- 
5  definition 
for  PTSD  (American  Psychological 
Association, 2013). The experience of morally injurious 
events 
is  associated  with  PTSD  and  depression 
(Williamson,  Stevelink,  &  Greenberg,  2018)  and  is 
thought  to  be  a  risk  factor  for  the  development  of 
various  mental  health  problems  (Castro  &  McGurk, 
2007;  Held  et  al.,  2018b;  Litz  et  al.,  2009).  An  initial 
examination  of  the  prevalence  of  morally  injurious 
experiences based on a nationally representative sample 
of veterans suggested that approximately 10.8% of com-
bat veterans reported having committed transgressions 
themselves,  25.5%  reported  having  witnessed  others 
transgressions,  and  25.5%  endorsed 
committing 
betrayal (Wisco et al., 2017).

Many have argued that posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and moral injury meaningfully differ from one 
another  (for  review  see:  Griffin  et  al.,  2019).  Recent 

research has suggested that PTSD and moral injury do 
share  overlap  in  presentation  (e.g.,  depression,  anger, 
substance use, sleep issues), but still they have distinct 
symptom  profiles  (Bryan,  Bryan,  Roberge,  Leifker,  & 
Rozek,  2018).  Moral  injury  has  been  uniquely  asso-
ciated with guilt, shame, social alienation, and anhedo-
nia. Similarly, PTSD has been uniquely associated with 
physiological responses (e.g., startle), memory loss, and 
flashbacks.  Although  some  have  discussed  the  idea  of 
a  separate  diagnosis  of  moral  injury,  there  is  not  cur-
rently  a  category  in  the  DSM-5  to  account  for  this 
presentation  (Bryan  et  al.,  2018).  Many  individuals 
who  experience  moral  injury  are  diagnosed  with 
PTSD,  yet  no  study  has  directly  tested  if  the  current 
frontline treatments used for PTSD can be effective for 
those with moral injury.

Given  the  unique  symptom  profiles  of  PTSD  and 
moral  injury,  it  has  been  suggested  that  frontline  evi-
dence-based treatments for PTSD may not be as effective 
among  veterans  with  morally  injurious  experiences 
(Gray et al., 2012; Griffin et al., 2019; Steenkamp, Nash, 
Lebowitz,  &  Litz,  2013).  Moreover,  meta-analyses  have 
shown  that  military  populations  demonstrate  overall 
poorer  outcomes  to  evidence-based  psychotherapies 
compared  to  civilians  (Straud,  Siev,  Messer,  &  Zalta, 
2019),  possibly  due  to  morally  injurious  events  within 
military populations. Alternatively, others have suggested 
that moral injury can be conceptualized in a theoretically 
congruent model and current treatments can be effective 
(Currier, Drescher, & Nieuwsma, 2020; Rozek & Bryan, 
2020). Both cognitive and emotional processing theories 
of PTSD argue that exaggerated negative beliefs about the 
trauma play an  important role in the  development and 
maintenance  of  PTSD  (Ehlers  &  Clark,  2000;  Zalta, 
2015). Similarly, negative event-related beliefs may play 

an  important  role  in  moral  injury.  One  cross-sectional 
study has shown that negative posttraumatic cognitions 
that are thought to play a role in the aetiology of PTSD 
mediate  the  relationship  between  morally  injurious 
experiences  and  trauma-related  psychopathology  (Held 
et al., 2017). Additionally, several clinicians and research-
ers have provided theoretical arguments and case report 
data  to  suggest  that  existing  evidence-based  cognitive- 
behavioural interventions, such as Cognitive Processing 
Therapy  (CPT;  Resick,  Monson,  &  Chard,  2017)  and 
Prolonged  Exposure  (PE;  Foa,  Hembree,  Rothbaum,  & 
Rauch, 2019), may be effective for the treatment of moral 
injury-based  PTSD  (Held,  Klassen,  Brennan,  &  Zalta, 
2018a;  Pearce,  Haynes,  Rivera,  &  Koenig,  2018;  Smith, 
Duax,  & Rauch,  2013;  Wachen,  Dondanville, &  Resick, 
2017).  Although  the  justification  for  evidenced-based 
treatments for PTSD being effective or not are the topic 
of  many  academic  discussions,  no  published  study  to 
date has examined whether individuals who have experi-
enced  morally  injurious  events  respond  differently  to 
evidence-based  psychotherapies  for  PTSD  than  those 
who have not.

The purpose of the present study was to fill the exist-
ing gaps in the literature regarding the prevalence of and 
the  impact  of  morally  injurious  events  on  veterans’ 
responses  to  PTSD  treatment.  Individuals  who  have 
experienced  morally  injurious  events  often  believe  they 
should have acted differently and view themselves nega-
tively as a result of their actions or inactions. Identifying 
and  challenging  such  maladaptive  cognitions  which 
drive distress is the key focus of CPT, which may make 
it particularly well suited to address moral injury-based 
PTSD (Held et al., 2018a; Rozek & Bryan, 2020; Wachen 
et  al.,  2017).  Using  data  from  a  3-week  Cognitive 
Processing  Therapy  (CPT)-based  intensive  treatment 
programme  (ITP)  for  PTSD,  we  evaluated  whether 
a history of morally injurious event exposure or targeting 
a  morally  injurious  index  event  during  treatment 
impacted  symptom  severity  and  response  to  treatment. 
Due to our a priori hypothesis that we would not observe 
treatment  outcome  differences  between  veterans  with 
and  without  histories  of  morally  injurious  events,  we 
also conducted non-inferiority analyses.

2. Method

2.1. Participants

The sample (N = 161) consisted of 11 service members 
and 150 veterans (SMVs) who participated in a 3-week 
Cognitive  Processing  Therapy-based  intensive  PTSD 
treatment  programme  (ITP)  between  June  2016  and 
July  2019  (Held,  2020).  The  sample  consisted  of  147 
males (91.30%) and 14 females (8.70%) with an average 
age  of  39.94  years  (SD  =  8.27,  range  =  25–65).  The 
SMVs  in  the  sample  predominantly  identified  as 
Caucasian  (n  =  115,  71.43%)  and  non-Hispanic

(n  =  126,  78.26%).  Specific  deployment-related  infor-
mation was available for 145 of the 161 veterans in the 
present  sample.  Most  SMVs  in  the  present  sample 
(n  =  138;  95.17%)  served 
in  support  of  either 
Operation  Enduring  Freedom  (primarily  Afghanistan; 
reported  by  n  =  58;  40.00%)  and  Operation  Iraqi 
Freedom  (primarily  Iraq;  reported  by  n  =  116; 
80.00%).  The  remaining  4.83%  served  in  support  of 
other  Operations  prior  to  11  September  2001,  such  as 
the Persian Gulf War (primarily Iraq). Additional sam-
ple characteristics are displayed in Table 1.

2.2. Procedures

All  study  procedures  were  approved  by  the  Rush 
University  Medical  Center 
Institutional  Review 
Board  with  a  waiver  of  consent  because  all  assess-
ments  were  collected  as  part  of  routine  clinical  care. 
The  Road  Home  Program  at  Rush  provides  outpati-
ent  and  intensive  outpatient  mental  healthcare  at  no 
cost  to  all  SMVs  regardless  of  their  discharge  or 
service  status.  All  of  the  SMVs  in  the  present  study 
attended  a  3-week,  all-day  Cognitive  Processing 
Therapy-based  ITP  for  PTSD.  Prior  to  their  ITP 
attendance,  all  SMVs  participated  in  an  intake  eva-
luation  which  combined  semi-structured  interviews, 
diagnostic  assessments,  and  the  completion  of  self- 
report  symptom  measures.  Acceptance  into  the  ITP 
was  based  on  a  diagnosis  of  PTSD  verified  by  the 
for  DSM-5 
Clinician-Administered  PTSD  Scale 
(CAPS-5;  Weathers,  Blake,  et  al.,  2013).  SMVs  who 
were actively suicidal/homicidal or engaged in severe 
non-suicidal  self-harm  in  the  past  3  months,  are 
diagnosed  with  mania  or  psychosis,  or  engage  in 
substance use that would require medical observation 
were  not  eligible  for  the  ITP.  During  the  ITP,  SMVs 
received 14 daily 50-min individual CPT and 13 120- 
min  group  CPT  sessions.  CPT  is  considered  a  first- 
line evidence-based treatment for PTSD (Resick et al., 
2017).  Although  not  developed  specifically 
for 
morally  injurious  traumatic  events,  its  mechanism 
(i.e., changes in maladaptive cognitions about oneself, 
others,  and  the  world)  has  been  suggested  to  be 
effective  for  reducing  moral  injury-based  PTSD  (see 
Held  et  al.,  2018a;  Rozek  &  Bryan,  2020;  Wachen 
et  al.,  2017).  In  line  with  recent  suggestions  (e.g., 
Held  et  al.,  2018a;  Rozek  &  Bryan,  2020;  Wachen 
et  al.,  2017),  CPT  was  not  modified  for  individuals 
with  morally  injurious  experiences.  In  treatment, 
clinicians  likely  addressed  maladaptive  cognitions 
associated  with  the  moral  injury  during  treatment, 
when  these  cognitions  were  driving  the  individual’s 
distress.  In  addition  to  CPT,  SMVs  received  13  daily 
75-min  group-based  mindfulness  sessions  and  12 
daily  50-min  group  yoga  sessions,  as  well  as  several 
adjunctive  services  such  as  psychoeducation  (e.g., 
sleep  hygiene  and  meaning  making  of  service)  and

case  management.  The  3-week  ITP  has  been  estab-
lished  to  be  well  tolerated  (Held  et  al.,  2020a). 
Moreover,  participation  in  the  ITP  has  been  shown 
to  produce  large,  rapid  PTSD  symptom  reductions 
that  are  comparable  to  those  reported  in  PTSD  effi-
cacy  trials  (Zalta  et  al.,  2018)  and  maintained  for  up 
to  12  months  following  completion  (Held  et  al., 
2020b).  A  more  detailed  description  of  the  intake 
process,  treatment  services,  and  treatment  outcomes 
can  be  found  in  (Held  et  al.,  2020a).  The  ITP  offers 
tracks  for  PTSD  that  resulted  from  both  combat- 
related  trauma  and  military  sexual  trauma.  In  line 
with  the  existing  literature  on  moral  injury,  which 
has  primarily  focused  on  combat  veterans  (cf. 
Frankfurt  &  Frazier,  2016),  the  present  study  only 
examined  data  from  SMVs  who  participated  in  the 
combat  trauma  ITP  track.

2.3 Measures

2.3.1. Demographic  information
Demographic  information,  including  sex,  age,  ethni-
city,  race,  marital  status,  and  service  status  were  col-
lected  during  the  intake  evaluation.

2.3.2. Moral  Injury  Events  Scale  (MIES;  Nash  et  al., 
2013)
The  MIES  is  a  9-item  self-report  measure  of  exposure 
and  psychological  response  to  potentially  morally 

injurious events and was administered to SMVs at pre- 
treatment. Studies examining the factor structure of the 
MIES have suggested a three-factor solution (Bryan et al., 
2016):  Perceived  Transgressions  by  Others  (two  items; 
e.g.,  ‘I  saw  things  that  were  morally  wrong’),  Perceived 
Transgressions by Self (four items; e.g., ‘I acted in ways 
that  violated  my  own  moral  code  or  values’),  and 
Perceived Betrayals (three items; e.g., ‘I feel betrayed by 
fellow  service  members  who  I  once  trusted’).  Items  are 
scored  from  1  (strongly  disagree)  to  6  (strongly  agree); 
higher  scores  on  the  MIES  subscales  reflect  a  greater 
amount  of  exposure  to  potentially  morally  injurious 
events. The MIES has been shown to have good psycho-
metric  properties  in  samples  of  both  treatment-seeking 
and non-treatment-seeking veterans and active duty ser-
vice  members  (Bryan  et  al.,  2016;  Nash  et  al.,  2013).

sample were .85, .90, .77, respectively.

To  identify  SMVs  who  screened  ‘positive’  for  sig-
nificant  morally  injurious  experiences  based  on  the 
MIES,  we  followed  a  dichotomous  scoring  system 
first  used  by  Wisco  and  colleagues  (Wisco  et  al., 
2017). Based on the scoring system, SMVs who either 
endorsed  Transgressions  by  Self,  Transgressions  by 
Others,  or  Perceived  Betrayal  at  least  ‘moderately’ 
were  considered  as  having  experienced  significant 
morally injurious events during their military  service 

(Wisco  et  al.,  2017).  Given  current  controversies 
around  the  concept  of  betrayal  in  moral  injury,  we 
also  created  a  separate  ‘Transgressions  Only’  score 
based  on  Wisco  and  colleagues’  (Wisco  et  al.,  2017) 
method.  Any  SMV  who  screened  positive  for  having 
experienced 
and 
Transgressions  by  Others  was  classified  as  having 
experienced morally injurious events involving trans-
gressions  during their  military  service.

2.3.3. PTSD  Checklist  for  DSM-5  (PCL-5;  Weathers 
et  al.,  2013)
The  PCL-5  is  a  20-item  self-report  measure  of  PTSD 
symptom severity. The PCL-5 was administered at pre- 
treatment, on ITP days 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, and at post- 
treatment.  Symptom  severity  was  measured  based  on 
the past month on intake and based on the past week at 
each  additional  timepoint.  Individuals  were  asked  to 
rate  their  PTSD  symptoms  in  relation  to  their  index 
trauma that they targeted during CPT on a scale from 0 
(not at all) to 4 (extremely). Scores were summed with 
higher  PCL-5  total  scores  reflecting  greater  PTSD 
symptom  severity.  A  PCL-5  total  score  >33  is  com-
monly  used  as  a  cut-off  to  suggest  ‘probable  PTSD’ 
(Bovin  et  al.,  2016).  The  PCL-5  has  been  shown  to 
have  excellent  psychometric  properties  and  has  been 
used  in  a  large  number  of  studies  involving  veterans 
(cf.  Bovin  et  al.,  2016).  Internal  consistency  reliability 
for the PCL-5 in the present study ranged from .88-.96.

2.3.4. Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9; 
Kroenke,  Spitzer,  &  Williams,  2001)
The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure that assesses 
depression symptom severity over the course of the past 
two  weeks.  The  PHQ-9  was  administered  at  pre- 
treatment  and  ITP  days  3,  5,  6,  8,  10,  11,  and  post- 
treatment.  Items  are  scored  from  0  (not  at  all)  to  3 
(nearly every day) and then added together to generate 
a  total  score  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater 
depression  severity.  A  PHQ-9  total  score  >10  is  com-
monly used as a cut-off to suggest moderate or greater 
depression severity (Kroenke et al., 2001). The PHQ-9 
has strong psychometric properties and is widely used 
for  the  assessment  of  depression  symptom  severity 
(Kroenke  et  al.,  2001).  Internal  consistency  reliability 
for the PHQ-9 in the present study ranged from .80-.88.

2.3.5.
Index  trauma  involving  moral  injury
Following  the  completion  of  treatment,  clinicians 
who  delivered  daily  CPT  were  asked  to  rate  if  their 
SMV’s index trauma was a morally injurious event or 
not. To make this determination, clinicians were pro-
vided with the definition of potentially morally injur-
ious  events  by  Litz  and  colleagues  (Litz  et  al.,  2009): 
‘perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or 
learning about acts that  transgress deeply held moral 
beliefs  and  expectations’  (p.  697).  In  addition  to  the

dichotomous  rating,  clinicians  were  asked  to  briefly 
describe  the  index  trauma  the  SMV  worked  on  dur-
ing  CPT  if  the  trauma  was  categorized  as  morally 
injurious.  Study  staff  compared  the  dichotomous 
clinician  ratings  with  the  descriptions  of  the  morally 
injurious events that the clinicians provided to verify 
the  accuracy  of  the  provided  codes.  There  were  no 
discrepancies  between  the  clinician  ratings  and  the 
provided  descriptions.

2.4. Analyses

Basic  descriptive  analyses  were  performed  to  deter-
mine  sample  characteristics.  Linear  mixed  effects 
regression  analyses  were  conducted  to  determine 
whether  differences  in  average  effects  or  trends  over 
the  course  of  treatment  existed  between  participants 
who  did  and  did  not  report  a  history  of  morally 
injurious event exposure, or were and were not deter-
mined to have worked on an index trauma involving 
moral  injury.  This  approach  was  chosen  due  to  less 
the  variance- 
restrictive  assumptions  regarding 
covariance  structure,  ease  in  accommodating  some 
missing-at-random  measurements  during  the  pro-
gramme,  and  ability  to  model  individual  change 
over  time  (for  review  see  Hedeker  &  Gibbons, 
2006).  P-values  based  on  likelihood  ratio  tests  for 
model  comparisons  are  reported  here,  with  p  <  .05 
considered significant.

Due  to  our  a  priori  interest  in  determining  whether 
SMVs with a history of morally injurious event exposure 
and  SMVs  who  worked  on  index  traumas  involving 
moral  injury  benefited  from  the  ITP  to  an  equivalent 
extent as those who did not experience morally injurious 
events, we also conducted non-inferiority analyses using 
the  two  one-sided  test  procedure  (TOST;  Schuirmann, 
1987) on the differences between the two groups during 
the  post-treatment  assessment.  Unlike  conventional 
comparative analyses, which can probabilistically estab-
lish  group  mean  differences  but  not  equivalence,  the 
noninferiority analyses used here tested a null hypothesis 
that SMVs who reported morally injurious event expo-
sure  histories  or  were  determined  to  have  worked  on 
index  traumas  involving  moral  injury  had  lower  mean 
outcome scores at the post-treatment assessment relative 
to those who did not. Using this procedure, noninferior-
ity  is  established  if  a  90%  confidence  interval  of  the 
difference  between  group  means  falls  fully  within  an 
a  priori  equivalence  margin.  Equivalence  margins  were 
determined to be 10 points for PCL-5 scores and 5 points 
for PHQ-9 scores. A 5-point change on the PHQ-9 has 
previously  been  suggested  to  represent  clinically  mean-
ingful change (Kroenke et al., 2016). There are currently 
no published definitions for clinically meaningful change 
for the PCL-5 (Weathers, Litz, et al., 2013). We adopted 
the  10-point  change  that  has  been  suggested  for

PTSD  when  this  manuscript  was  composed,  assuming 
that  such  a  symptom  reduction  would  be  noticeable  to 
individuals. Analyses were performed using Stata version 
15 (Statacorp; Stata Statistical Software: Release 14, 2014) 
and  Supermix  1.1  (Scientific  Software  International; 
Hedeker, Gibbons, Du Toit, & Cheng, 2007).

3. Results

in 

the  present 

sample  endorsed 

According to Wisco and colleagues’ (Wisco et al., 2017) 
scoring method for the MIES, a total of 95 (59.01%) of 
SMVs 
self- 
transgressions, 121 (75.16%) reported witnessing other- 
transgressions,  and  102  (63.35%)  endorsed  betrayal. 
Using the same scoring, 129 (80.12%) SMVs endorsed 
either  committing or witnessing  transgressions during 
military  service.  The  SMVs  in  the  sample  reported 
mean  scores 
the  MIES  subscales  of  self- 
transgression,  other-transgression,  and  betrayal  as 
14.87  (SD  =  6.72),  9.12  (SD  =  3.16),  and  11.31 
(SD  =  4.82),  respectively.  Using  clinician  ratings,  82 
(50.93%)  of  the  SMVs  in  sample  worked  on  an  index 
trauma involving moral injury.

for 

At  intake,  neither  moral  injury  history  nor  index 
trauma  type  was  associated  with  ratings  of  trauma- 
related psychopathology, including PTSD and depression 
(see  Table  2).  There  were  no  differences  in  programme 
completion  rates  (ps  from  .124  to  .689)  or  number  of 
treatment  days  completed  (ps  between  .139  and  .951) 
based on moral injury history or index trauma type (see 
Table 2). Symptom reduction based on PCL-5 and PHQ-9 
change  scores  from  pre-  to  post-treatment  also  did  not 
differ based on moral injury history or index trauma type 
(see Table 3), or any of the demographic variables in Table 
2 (all ps > .20).

Initial longitudinal mixed effects model examination 
suggested  that  random  intercepts  models  were  prefer-
able to linear models (ps < .001), and that inclusion of 
a random trend led to significantly greater fit as well for 
all outcomes (ps < .001). Based on Akiake Information 
Criterion  (AIC)  analysis,  first-order  autoregressive 

structure was deemed most appropriate for PCL-5 and 
PHQ-9 models, which was supported by examination of 
correlation structure of measurements over time. Both 
linear (ps < .001) and quadratic (ps < .001) time effects 
were significant in models predicting PCL-5 and PHQ- 
9  (see  Table  4),  suggesting  symptom  reduction  across 
time for all outcomes and acceleration in PCL-5 reduc-
tions  over  time  but  deceleration  in  PHQ-9  reductions 
over  time.  Both  unadjusted  models  and  models  that 
adjusted for sex and age were explored. In unadjusted 
and adjusted mixed-effects models, moral injury history 
and index  trauma type  were not  significant  predictors 
of  overall  differences  or  changes  in  depression  and 
PTSD symptoms over time (see Table 4; Figures 1 and 
2).  We  then  evaluated  whether  morally  injurious 
experiences  predicted  whether  individuals  were  above 
or  below  established  clinical  cut-offs  on  the  PCL-5 
(score of 33) or PHQ-9 (score of 10) at post-treatment 
(i.e.,  achieved  probable  remission).  Neither  moral 
injury  history  nor index trauma  type predicted remis-
sion status at post-treatment (PCL-5 ps > .393; PHQ-9 
ps > .570).

Non-inferiority analyses at post-treatment indicated 
that  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  differences 
between  the  moral  injury  history  and  index  trauma 
type  groups  fell  within  the  established  equivalence 
margins  for  both  PCL-5  and  PHQ-9  (see  Table  5). 
This  suggests  that  changes  in  PTSD  and  depression 
symptoms were not inferior for SMVs with a history of 
morally  injurious  event  exposure  or  SMVs  who 
worked  on  an  index  trauma  compared  to  those  with-
out  these experiences.

4. Discussion

Overall,  we  found  high  rates  of  morally  injurious 
experiences  in  this  sample;  80.12%  of  the  SMVs 
reported  either  committing  or  witnessing  transgres-
sions  on  the  MIES  and  50.9%  of  SMVs  were  deter-
mined  to  have  worked  on  an  index  trauma  involving 
moral  injury  by  their  treating  clinician.  Rates  of

were  higher  than  those  previously  reported  for 
a  nationally  representative  sample  of  SMVs.  When 
applying  the  same  scoring  method  of  the  MIES  as 
used  by  Wisco  and  colleagues  (Wisco  et  al.,  2017), 
59.0%  reported  self-transgressions 
to 
10.8%  in  the  nationally  representative  sample),  75.2% 
reported witnessing other-transgressions (compared to 
25.5%  in  the  nationally  representative  sample),  and 
78.9%  reported  betrayal  (compared  to  25.5%  in  the 
nationally  representative  sample).  The  mean  scores 
for  the  MIES  self-transgression,  other-transgressions, 
and  betrayal  subscales  were  comparable  to  those 
reported  in  other  treatment-seeking  samples  (e.g., 
Bryan  et  al.,  2016),  suggesting  that  treatment-seeking 
SMVs  samples  are  more  likely  to  have  experienced 
morally  injurious  events  than  non-treatment  seeking 

such  as  PTSD 

samples. This is consistent with research showing that 
the experience of morally injurious events is associated 
with  psychopathology, 
severity 
(Williamson  et  al.,  2018).  However,  it  is  also  possible 
that the high self-report rates may have been the result 
of  SMVs  interpreting  the  items  on  the  MIES  as 
morally  distressing  events  rather  than  more  severe 
morally  injurious  events  (see  Litz  &  Kerig,  2019). 
Clinicians  who  work  with  SMVs  who  are  seeking 
mental  health  care,  and  especially  care  for  PTSD, 
may  expect  higher  rates  of  morally  injurious  experi-
ences than those who work with SMVs in primary care 
and other settings where mental health may not be the 
primary  concern  (Currier  et  al.,  2020).  Clinicians  are

cognitions  that  are  driving  distress;  not  assessing  for 
morally injurious experiences may limit the identifica-
tion  of  potential  treatment  targets.  A  multifaceted 
approach  to  the  assessment  of  morally  injurious 
experiences  that  combines  self-report  and  clinician- 
rated  assessments  may  be  particularly  helpful,  given 
the  difference  in  prevalence  of  these  two  types  of 
assessment  strategies  that  was  observed  in  the  present 
sample.

In  terms  of  treatment  outcomes,  our  results  sug-
gested  that  there  was  no  difference  in  response  to 
a  CPT-based  intensive  PTSD  treatment  programme 
based  on  morally  injurious  event  exposure  history  or 
index  trauma  targeted  during  treatment.  SMVs  who 
reported  a  history  of  morally  injurious  events  during 
military  service  and  SMVs  who  worked  on  an  index 
trauma  involving  moral  injury  reported  comparable 
pre- and post-treatment PTSD and depression severity 
scores to their counterparts and showed nearly identical 
symptom trajectories over the course of treatment. The 
percentage  of SMVs in  each  group who  fell below  the 
suggested cut-off scores for probable remission also did 
not significantly differ between groups for either assess-
ment  approach.  Moreover,  our  results  showed  that 
treatment attendance and completion rates were extre-
mely high and did not differ between the groups. The 
present findings are consistent with previous theoretical 
postulations and case reports demonstrating that moral 
injury-based  PTSD  can  be  effectively  treated  with  evi-
dence-based  cognitive-behavioural  treatments  (Held 
et  al.,  2018a;  Pearce  et  al.,  2018;  Smith  et  al.,  2013; 
Wachen et al., 2017). However, it is important to note 
that  the  intensive  PTSD  treatment  programme  in  this 
study  consisted  of  a  multitude  of  interventions  rather 
than just CPT. Although CPT is considered the primary 
intervention  and  was  delivered  daily  via  groups  and 
individual  sessions,  SMVs  also  received  wellness  and 
other adjunctive interventions, such as mindfulness and 
yoga. These integrative interventions may contribute to 
a  more  holistic  recovery,  which  may  be  especially 
important  for  SMVs  exposed  to  morally  injurious 
events  (Walser  &  Wharton,  2021).  For  example,  it  is 
possible  that  the  focus  on  non-judgemental  self- 
awareness  in  mindfulness  may  be  particularly  helpful 
for  those  struggling  with  moral  injury  (Walser  & 
Wharton,  2021).  Future  research  should  explore 
whether 
cognitive- 
behavioural  interventions  for  PTSD  in  the  absence  of 
adjunctive  treatment  services  can  achieve  similar 

evidence-based 

standalone 

outcomes for SMVs exposed to and affected by morally 
injurious events.

Several  limitations  should  be  noted.  First,  the 
group  classifications  used  in  this  archival  post-hoc 
observational  study  were  made  after  SMVs  had 
already  completed  treatment.  Second,  a  diagnosis 
of  PTSD  was  a  requirement  for  admission  to  the 
treatment  programme.  As  morally  injurious  events 
do  not  always  involve  Criterion  A  traumas,  we  are 
not  able  to  speak  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  treat-
ment  for  moral  injury-related  psychopathology  that 
is  not  manifested  as  PTSD.  Third,  all  staff  who 
delivered  clinical  services  had  an  advanced  under-
standing  of  both  moral  injury  and  CPT.  It  is  pos-
sible  that  provider  knowledge  of  moral  injury  and 
provider  CPT  skill  may  account  for  the  similarity 
in  outcomes  for  the  two  groups.  Fourth,  although 
SMVs’  PTSD  diagnosis  was  established  using  the 
CAPS-5  during  the  intake  process,  only  self-report 
measures  were  used  to  track  treatment  response. 
Fifth,  study  findings  may  be  limited  in  their  gen-
eralizability  due  to  the  relatively  unique  nature  of 
intensive  PTSD  programme,  which 
the  3-week 
combines 
evidence-based 
PTSD treatment with numerous adjunctive services. 
Lastly,  the  present  study  distinguished  between 
those  SMVs  who  endorsed  and  did  not  endorse 
exposure  to  morally  injurious  experiences  in  gen-
eral;  there  is,  however,  emerging  evidence  that  dif-
ferent  kinds  of  morally  injurious  experiences  may 
overlap  with  each  other  and  that  different  kinds  of 
morally  injurious  experiences  may  result  in  differ-
ent  clinical  sequelae  (Nieuwsma  et  al.,  2020). 
Future  clinical  studies  of  moral  injury  should  take 
these  differences  into  account.

intensively  delivered 

Despite these limitations, the present study is one 
of  the  first  to  examine  the  impact  of  exposure  to 
morally  injurious  events  on  PTSD  treatment  out-
comes.  Overall,  the  present  study  illustrates  that 
treatment-seeking  combat  SMVs  with  PTSD  appear 
to  have  high  rates  of  morally  injurious  event  expo-
sure.  Thus,  it  is  quite  possible  that  previous  clinical 
trials of evidence-based treatments for combat veter-
ans  included  many  individuals  exposed  to  morally 
injurious events  even  though  this  construct  was  not 
assessed.  The  present  study  also  demonstrated  con-
sistent  results  across  two  assessment  strategies; 
neither a history of morally injurious event exposure 
nor  working  on  an  index  trauma  involving  moral 

injury  negatively  impacted  intensive  PTSD  treat-
ment  outcomes.  Future  research  should  evaluate 
whether these findings hold true for standalone evi-
dence-based 
interventions 
cognitive-behavioural 
and  also  whether  the  delivery  format  (intensive  vs. 
weekly)  affects  treatment  outcomes  for  those  with 
and  without  exposure  to  morally  injurious  events. 
Based  on  the  findings  from  the  present  study,  clin-
icians are encouraged to use these established front-
line  interventions until  additional  research  becomes 
available.  Additionally,  investigating  how  currently 
used  frontline  interventions  can  be  modified  to 
improve  the  effectiveness  of  treatment  for  moral 
injury may be an important area for future research. 
Overall,  the  current  study  provides  initial  evidence 
that  there  are  high  rates  of  morally  injurious  events 
among  SMVs  who  are  seeking  PTSD  treatment. 
Additionally, our results suggest that CPT, especially 
in  the  context  of  intensive  PTSD  treatment,  should 
continue to be used for those who experience symp-
toms  related  to  PTSD  regardless  of  whether  the 
individuals have had exposure to a morally injurious 
event.
