Alcohol use disorder and sleep disturbances: a feed-forward
allostatic framework

George F. Koob1,2 and Ian M. Colrain3,4

The development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) involves binge or heavy drinking to high levels of intoxication that leads to
compulsive intake, the loss of control in limiting intake, and a negative emotional state when alcohol is removed. This cascade of
events occurs over an extended period within a three-stage cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/
anticipation. These three heuristic stages map onto the dysregulation of functional domains of incentive salience/habits, negative
emotional states, and executive function, mediated by the basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and frontal cortex, respectively. Sleep
disturbances, alterations of sleep architecture, and the development of insomnia are ubiquitous in AUD and also map onto the
three stages of the addiction cycle. During the binge/intoxication stage, alcohol intoxication leads to a faster sleep onset, but sleep
quality is poor relative to nights when no alcohol is consumed. The reduction of sleep onset latency and increase in wakefulness
later in the night may be related to the acute effects of alcohol on GABAergic systems that are associated with sleep regulation and
the effects on brain incentive salience systems, such as dopamine. During the withdrawal/negative affect stage, there is a decrease
in slow-wave sleep and some limited recovery in REM sleep when individuals with AUD stop drinking. Limited recovery of sleep
disturbances is seen in AUD within the ﬁrst 30 days of abstinence. The effects of withdrawal on sleep may be related to the loss of
alcohol as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, a decrease in dopamine function, and the overactivation of stress
neuromodulators, including hypocretin/orexin, norepinephrine, corticotropin-releasing factor, and cytokines. During the
preoccupation/anticipation stage, individuals with AUD who are abstinent long-term present persistent sleep disturbances,
including a longer latency to fall asleep, more time awake during the night, a decrease in slow-wave sleep, decreases in delta
electroencephalogram power and evoked delta activity, and an increase in REM sleep. Glutamatergic system dysregulation that is
observed in AUD is a likely substrate for some of these persistent sleep disturbances. Sleep pathology contributes to AUD
pathology, and vice versa, possibly as a feed-forward drive to an unrecognized allostatic load that drives the addiction process.

INTRODUCTION
Sleep is a ubiquitous complex behavior that is necessary to sustain
mental and physical health in humans. The different states of
sleep and transitions between sleep and wakefulness are
supported by a complex set of patterns of neurological activation
and neurotransmitter release [1]. Many of the neurotransmitters
and brain systems that are known to be involved in sleep-wake
[2–4]). Thus,
regulation are also affected by alcohol
unsurprisingly, alcohol affects sleep in several ways. Acute
intoxication can alter sleep, but the effects of alcohol show
tolerance with repeated use and dependence [5, 6]. This tolerance
is accompanied by adaptations of several neurotransmitter
systems, either by modulating their release or modifying the
sensitivity of their response mechanisms [7–10]. Withdrawal from
alcohol
individuals can be associated with
neurological manifestations of a consequent neurochemical
imbalance [5]. Over time, recovery can occur to restore a normal
balance of inhibitory and excitatory systems, but some changes
that are induced by alcohol may be resistant to restoration. The
present review attempts to conceptually place the published

literature that is relevant to the above factors into a three-stage
cycle framework: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect,
and preoccupation/anticipation (“craving”).

Notably, several decisions were made with regard to which data
are reviewed herein and the ways in which they are presented in
the review. First, the salience of having sleep interrupted by
periods of wakefulness is a potential driver of behavior. Therefore,
is
the percentage of wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO%)
reported rather than the more typical inverse measure of sleep
efﬁciency (i.e., the percentage of time in bed spent asleep).
Second, wake and sleep stage data are reported as percentages of
sleep time throughout
than
absolute time spent in each state because of differences between
studies in amounts of time that are available for sleep, the age of
the subjects, and other factors that can inﬂuence absolute time
values. Third, wherever possible, data are presented as difference
scores to normalize data across experiments. This helps address
issues that are related to the fact that the studies that are reported
herein were published over a period of more than four decades.

rules for sleep stages [11] and gradual shifts in those rules and the
ways in which they are applied [12]. If earlier papers tend to over-
or underreport slow-wave sleep (SWS) or rapid-eye-movement

interest are normalized to
appropriate within-subject or between-group control data that
should have the same issue. Finally, several papers in the past have
highlighted REM latency or some measure of the intensity of eye
movements in REM as distinguishing features of sleep in alcoholics
[5]. Although these measures are indeed interesting, we have
chosen to focus on the percentage of REM as a key measure in this
review. This decision was based on the practical consideration that
many more papers report REM% than the other measures.

The term Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is used throughout the

concept. Many of the studies that are cited herein used other
diagnoses, such as “alcohol abuse” or “alcohol dependence” or
even “alcoholism,” based on various research or clinical deﬁnitions
that were available at the time the research was conducted.

DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTUAL
FRAMEWORK OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDER
In AUD, a pattern of oral drug taking evolves that is often
characterized by binges of alcohol
intake that can be daily
episodes or prolonged days of heavy drinking and is characterized
by a severe emotional and somatic withdrawal syndrome. Many
individuals with AUD continue with such a binge/withdrawal
pattern for extended periods of time, but some individuals evolve
into a situation in which they must have alcohol available at all
times to avoid the negative consequences of abstinence. Here,
intense preoccupation with obtaining alcohol (craving) develops
that is linked not only to stimuli that are associated with obtaining
the drug but also to stimuli that are associated with withdrawal
and the aversive motivational state. A pattern ultimately develops
in moderate to severe AUD in which the drug must be taken to
avoid the severe dysphoria and discomfort of abstinence.

Alcohol use disorder can be deﬁned as a chronically relapsing
disorder that is characterized by a compulsion to seek and take
the drug (alcohol), loss of control in limiting drug (alcohol) intake,
and the emergence of a negative emotional state (e.g., dysphoria,
irritability, and hyperkatifeia), reﬂecting a motivational
anxiety,
withdrawal syndrome, when access to the drug (alcohol)
is
prevented. These key elements incorporate most of the symptoms
of AUD as expressed in moderate to severe AUD in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [13].

The diagnostic criteria for AUD and addiction in general, as
described in the DSM, have evolved from the ﬁrst edition that was
published in 1952 [14] to the current DSM-5 [13], with a shift from
an emphasis on the criteria for tolerance and withdrawal to
other criteria that are more directed toward compulsive use. In the
DSM-5 [13], the new diagnostic criteria for addiction merged
the abuse and dependence constructs (i.e., substance abuse and
substance dependence) into one continuum that deﬁnes “alcohol
use disorder” on a range of severity, from mild to moderate
to severe, based on the number of criteria that are met out of
11 criteria.

Alcohol use disorder and addiction in general have been
heuristically framed as a three-stage cycle: binge/intoxication,
withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (“crav-
ing”) [15] (Fig. 1). These three stages represent dysregulation in
three functional domains (incentive salience/pathological habits,
negative emotional states, and executive function, respectively).
While formulated as a heuristic framework, a study that was
designed to identify the domains that drive addiction based on a
factor analysis of a deeply phenotyped clinical sample using a
broad range of human testing scales and neuropsychological tests
supported the existence of incentive salience, negative emotion-
ality, and executive function as domains that are relevant to AUD
[16, 17].

As originally described, the cycle of addiction was hypothesized
to reﬂect a spiral of self-regulation pathology and increasing
motivation for compulsive drug seeking [15]. Motivation that
drives the initial drug seeking from positive reinforcement was
argued to shift to an additional source of motivation that drives
continued drug seeking from negative reinforcement
[18].
Negative reinforcement can be deﬁned as the process by which
the removal of an aversive stimulus (e.g., negative emotional state
of drug withdrawal) increases the probability of a response (e.g.,
dependence-induced drug intake to relieve the negative emo-

emotional state that is a common presentation in most individuals
with AUD during withdrawal and protracted abstinence. Impor-

Fig. 1 Sleep dysregulation during alcohol addiction incorporated into the three-stage conceptual framework for the neurobiological basis of
addiction. In the binge/intoxication stage, reinforcing effects of drugs may engage reward neurotransmitters and associative mechanisms in
the nucleus accumbens shell and core and then engage stimulus-response habits that depend on the dorsal striatum. Two major
neurotransmitters that mediate the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse are dopamine and opioid peptides. In the withdrawal/negative affect
stage, the negative emotional state of withdrawal may engage activation of the extended amygdala. The extended amygdala is composed of
several basal forebrain structures, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and possibly a transition
zone in the medial portion (or shell) of the nucleus accumbens. Major neurotransmitters in the extended amygdala that are hypothesized to
function in negative reinforcement are corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, and dynorphin. There are major projections from the
extended amygdala to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The preoccupation/anticipation (craving) stage involves the processing of conditioned
reinforcement in the basolateral amygdala and the processing of contextual information by the hippocampus. Executive control depends on
the prefrontal cortex and includes the representation of contingencies, the representation of outcomes, and their value and subjective states
(i.e., craving and, presumably, feelings) that are associated with drugs. The subjective effects, termed “drug craving” in humans, involve
activation of the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and temporal lobe, including the amygdala. A major neurotransmitter that is
involved in the craving stage is glutamate that is localized in pathways from frontal regions and the basolateral amygdala that project to the

gical state that is known as addiction [15].

Derived largely from fundamental work in neurobiology, the
thesis argued herein is that AUD is a brain neurocircuitry disorder
and that neuroadaptations within speciﬁc motivational circuits
play an important role in deﬁning and perpetuating the disorder.
As formulated, the excessive engagement of reward circuitry
engages high incentive salience for cues and contexts that are
conditioned to drug seeking (binge/intoxication stage) and drives
pathological habits. These functional changes in reward and habit
circuits set up a series of neuroadaptations that involve core

For the binge/intoxication stage, several major neurotransmitter

reward/anti-reward mechanisms that results in a negative emo-
tional state that contributes to the compulsive use of drugs. This
negative emotional state in AUD has been hypothesized to be
driven not only by the loss of reward function that is mediated by
GABA, endogenous opioids, and dopamine but also by a gain in
brain stress neurotransmitter system function (e.g., corticotropin-
releasing factor [CRF], norepinephrine, hypocretin, and dynorphin)
and neuroimmune function, all of which converge on parts of the

systems that also converge on the extended amygdala (e.g.,
neuropeptide Y [NPY], nociceptin, endocannabinoids, and oxyto-
cin) that may be compromised during the development of alcohol
addiction, also contributing to the malaise of acute and protracted
withdrawal [20, 24].

The neurocircuitry that drives the preoccupation/anticipation or
“craving” stage of the addiction cycle is hypothesized to mediate
relapse in humans not only by the constructs of impulsivity and

ment have primarily focused on a glutamatergic projection from

accumbens [27].

MAPPING THE NEUROSCIENCE MODEL OF ADDICTION ONTO
SLEEP: ALCOHOL INTERACTIONS
Human sleep is deﬁned on the basis of changes in electro-
encephalographic (EEG) activity, augmented by measurements of
eye movements and postural muscle tone to aid in the
differentiation of REM sleep from wakefulness. There is a
continuum of predominant EEG frequencies from wakefulness
through REM sleep to deep SWS. Wakefulness is associated with
very high frequency gamma oscillations (≥~40 Hz) and desyn-
chronized beta activity (~20–30 Hz). Relaxed wakefulness, espe-
cially when the eyes are closed prior to sleep, is associated with
synchronized alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) that are predominant at
occipital scalp sites. This gives way to slower, mixed-frequency
theta activity (4–7 Hz) in stage 1, light non-REM (NREM) sleep (N1)
[12], although N1 is characterized by drowsiness with the waxing
and waning of consciousness that maps onto the waxing and
waning of alpha (consciousness) and theta (unconscious) activity.
REM sleep, constituting 20–25% of the night, exhibits desynchro-
nized activity in the theta and beta ranges, reﬂecting the partial
reactivation of brainstem mechanisms that are fully active in
wakefulness and deactivated in NREM sleep. Stage 2 NREM sleep
(N2) is characterized by theta activity, some delta activity (0.3–2
Hz), phasic sleep spindles (synchronized sigma activity: 12–16 Hz),
and K-complexes
(high-amplitude single delta waves) and
constitutes between 45–55% of the night. Stage 3 and 4 NREM
sleep (N3 or SWS) is characterized by slow delta activity that
comprises ~18% of the night. NREM and REM sleep alternate
in ~90-min cycles. As the sleep episode
across the night
progresses, Stage 2 sleep accounts for most NREM sleep, and
the amount of REM sleep increases.

Acute effects of alcohol on sleep: binge/intoxication domain
Alcohol’s sedative actions on the central nervous system (CNS) can
lead to sleepiness and sleep. The impact of acute alcohol ingestion
prior to sleep can be reasonably assumed to vary, based on a
number of factors, including blood alcohol levels at sleep onset,
the time of the last drink relative to sleep onset, the time taken to
metabolize alcohol and eliminate it and its major metabolites, age,
sex, and body fat percentage. The metabolism of alcohol by liver
enzymes is unaffected by sleep [28]. Thus, over the duration of an
extended period of sleep, blood levels of alcohol and major
metabolites (e.g., acetaldehyde and acetate) vary substantially and
are expected to impact sleep differently at different points in the
sleep cycle. Given the pharmacokinetics of alcohol absorption,
blood alcohol levels may continue to rise during sleep if alcohol is
consumed immediately prior to sleep onset but will eventually fall
after metabolism and elimination, according to the pharmacoki-
netics that are provided by the status of liver function and genetic
factors in the production of liver enzymes [29]. In addition to the
direct effect of alcohol and metabolites on sleep and possible
early withdrawal opponent processes,
it is also necessary to
consider more prosaic secondary effects, such as diuresis, on sleep
disturbances.

A key interrelationship between alcohol intoxication and sleep
is its potential to generate erroneous beliefs about alcohol as an
effective self-administered therapy for insomnia [30, 31]. There is,
however, only a small body of literature that reports laboratory
investigations of the ways in which acute intoxication impacts
sleep. Results have varied between studies because of typical
sources of variance in human physiology experiments, such as
small sample sizes, the lack of consistency in dosing schedules and
amounts, and the gender and age distributions of the subject
populations.

Acute effects of alcohol on sleep: time to fall asleep and
wakefulness after sleep onset
Sleep is a rapidly reversible unconscious state. However, beliefs
about how substances or behaviors inﬂuence sleep quality are
based on conscious experience, either how a person feels the next
day (e.g., sleepy/rested, good/bad mood, etc.) or their remem-
bered experience of wakeful consciousness around the sleep
period (e.g., time taken to fall asleep, time spent awake during the
night, etc.). Thus, such measures as sleep onset latency, time spent
awake after sleep onset, and sleep efﬁciency (time asleep/time in
bed) based on the perception that alcohol accelerates sleep onset
are more salient in terms of developing and reinforcing beliefs
than measures of REM sleep or SWS or how much delta EEG power
is generated during the sleep period. Several studies have used
non-intoxicating doses of alcohol. Reviews of these data can be
found in Colrain et al. [5] and Ebrahim et al. [6].

Table 1 summarizes sleep onset latency (SOL) data, typically
measured as the time from lights out to the onset of stage 1 (N1)
sleep, taken from studies that either had a single night of alcohol
administration, or in the ﬁrst night of several nights [28, 32–42].
The average SOL for the no-dose nights in studies of rested,
healthy controls was around 15 min across studies. Intoxicating
doses of alcohol appear to lead to a modest reduction of SOL by
~5 min at doses ≥0.9 g/kg. Although this effect may seem small,
even zolpidem (i.e., arguably the current gold standard pharma-
cological treatment for insomnia) sometimes shows effects of
similar magnitude when administered to healthy controls [43, 44].
Another sleep variable with high salience is the number of
minutes spent awake after sleep onset (WASO). Table 2 shows
WASO data from a number of studies that split the night into early
and later periods [28, 32, 33, 38, 39, 41, 42] to separate high blood
alcohol levels early in the night from falling blood alcohol levels,
but also possibly still high metabolite levels later in the night.
Data from whole night studies show a small increase in WASO
with high alcohol doses. Data from split night studies show a
tendency toward a decrease in WASO in the ﬁrst half of the night
following intoxicating doses of alcohol but an increase in the
second half of
the night, with a similar effect magnitude
regardless of the intoxicating dose that is administered. Other
sleep continuity variables, such as the number of awakenings and
sleep efﬁciency (i.e., minutes asleep as a proportion of time in
bed), show similar trends [39, 42]. Supplementary Table S1 shows
data from studies that reported across the entire night [32, 34–
40, 45]. Notably, in two studies, Roehrs and colleagues showed
increases in WASO with alcohol in insomnia patients [37] and in
controls who had restricted sleep on the prior night [36]. Thus,
even in cases in which prior sleep is poor, the net effect of an
intoxicating alcohol dose is to worsen sleep by increasing WASO.
There is one other study worth noting [46] that differs from
those reviewed above,
in which alcohol was consumed in the
afternoon, 6 h before bedtime. The 0.55 g/kg dose of vodka that
was administered to subjects led to an initial breath alcohol level
of 0.08 g%, which decreased to zero before sleep onset. No
difference in sleep onset latency was found between control and
alcohol nights, but WASO substantially increased on alcohol nights
(66.9 vs. 38.7 min), and the effect was maximal later in the night.
The data conﬁrm the general trend of the other studies, in which

the effects on SOL are probably attributable to alcohol, and the
effects on WASO are attributable to neuroadaptations to alcohol
or the presence of alcohol metabolites.

In summary, the acute effects of alcohol on the time taken to
fall asleep are highly variable, even at high alcohol doses. The
amount of time spent awake during the sleep period tends to
decrease early in the night and then increase later in the night
when high doses of alcohol are administered prior to bed, leading
increase across the night. Therefore, somewhat
to an overall
paradoxically, despite alcohol’s sedative effects and the strongly
held societal beliefs about its efﬁcacy as a sleep aid, although the
time taken to fall asleep decreases modestly, the amount of time
spent awake during the night increases following the consump-
tion of intoxicating levels of alcohol prior to bedtime.

Binge/intoxication: effects on REM sleep
The consensus view in the literature is that alcohol suppresses
REM sleep, with a rebound increase in REM sleep that occurs when
levels decrease. For the ﬁrst half of the night
blood alcohol
(Table 3),
relative to the no-alcohol condition, studies that
administered 0.50–0.64 g/kg alcohol reported a median 0.7%
increase in REM as a percentage of sleep time. Studies that
administered 0.75–0.80 g/kg alcohol reported a median 6.7%
decrease, and studies that administered 0.90–1.2 g/kg alcohol
reported a median 2.6% decrease. There is some evidence of
rebound in the second half of the night, other than when the
highest doses of alcohol were used.
In the second half of the

tered 0.50–0.64 g/kg alcohol reported a median 5% increase in
REM as a percentage of sleep time. Studies that administered
0.75–0.80 g/kg alcohol reported a median 6.5% increase, but
studies that administered 0.90–1.2 g/kg alcohol reported a median
2.1% decrease.

variable results when data are collapsed over the entire night

(Supplementary Table S2). The percentage of REM sleep across the
entire night in studies of normal controls ranged from 17.3% to
24.2%, with a median of 23.1% on no-dose nights. Relative to the
no-dose condition, studies that administered 0.50–0.64 g/kg
alcohol reported a median 0.7% decrease in REM sleep as a
percentage of sleep time. Studies that administered 0.75–0.80 g/
kg alcohol reported a median 3.5% decrease, and studies that
administered 0.90–1.2 g/kg alcohol
reported a median 2.9%
decrease.

The general conclusion is that intoxicating doses of alcohol do
not suppress REM sleep; instead, they produce a modest decrease
that is most prominent early in the night, with some modest
rebound compensation later in the night. Thus, the effects on REM
than its
sleep are likely mediated by alcohol
metabolites. However, there was a trend in the Landolt et al.
study [46] toward a decrease in REM sleep following afternoon
alcohol administration (17.4% vs. 19.2% of total sleep time [TST],
despite breath alcohol levels of zero at sleep onset.

Binge/intoxication: effects on NREM sleep
The major focus of studies that have examined NREM sleep has
been on evaluating the effect of alcohol intoxication on light stage
1 drowsiness (N1) as a marker of poor sleep and SWS (N3) as a
marker of restorative sleep. Data from studies that reported
N1 sleep across the night are presented in Table 4. The median
for the no-dose condition in healthy controls is ~7 min. Relative
to the no-dose condition, all doses led to median effects of less
than a 2% increase in N1 across the night. Consistent with the
intoxication was slightly

the
studies showed a range of SWS in the no-dose condition
between 12% and 30.5% of TST across the whole night. When
collapsing the data across the whole night of sleep, a modest
dose-related increase in SWS was observed. As shown in Table 5,
however,
this effect was highly variable across the night.
There were increases in SWS following intoxication relative to

the no-dose condition in the ﬁrst half of the night, followed by
decreases in the second half of the night when WASO and N1
increased.

The general conclusion for NREM sleep is that intoxicating
doses of alcohol lead to increases in SWS early in the night but a
deterioration of sleep quality (i.e., an increase in N1 and decrease
in SWS later in the night).

Binge/intoxication: effects on EEG
The impact of alcohol on the sleep architecture measures that are
reported above are based on visual analysis of polysomnogram
(PSG) recordings that are based on a consensus scoring system of
pen chart recorder data that were adopted in 1968 [11] that was
itself based on work from the 1930s [47–49]. Digital recordings
have now replaced analog ink-on-paper records, and digital signal

processing of the EEG can reveal subtle effects of alcohol that may
vary according to brain region and that are not evident from the
manual scoring of PSGs.

Few investigations have examined the acute effects of alcohol
on EEG power spectra, the results of which are summarized in
Table 6. The interpretation of the data is complicated by a number
of factors. Rundell et al. [28] reported data only from a single

central EEG site for delta, theta, and alpha activity and from a
frontal site for higher frequencies. Dijk et al. [50] reported data
only from a single central electrode. Landolt et al. [46] reported
data from several scalp regions and showed frontal and central
EEG effects but only in the ﬁrst sleep cycle and in response to
alcohol that was administered 6 h prior to sleep.

The frontal predominance was supported by Van Reen et al. [38]
in a study of young women who ingested alcohol in the hour prior
to sleep, with an increase in NREM alpha that lasted all night, but
the increase in NREM delta was speciﬁc to the ﬁrst sleep cycle.
Chan et al. [51] conﬁrmed the alpha and delta EEG effects,
in
which both frequencies had larger effects over the frontal scalp
and showed a decrease in the magnitude of both across sleep
cycles.

Similar to SWS, delta power increases early in the night and
can decrease later in the night following intoxication. Thus, for
the low-frequency EEG that is dominant in SWS, the frequency
analysis is consistent with visual scoring. Alpha activity that is
typically seen in relaxed wakefulness does not track WASO.
Alpha increases in the ﬁrst half of the night. Chan et al. [51]
reported that
in the context of background
delta activity as so-called alpha-delta sleep. This pattern, which
has been seen in patients with pain or who awake unrefreshed
[52], could indicate that despite increases in delta activity
and SWS, sleep may be less restorative following alcohol
intoxication.

it can occur

Binge/intoxication: repeated administration over several nights
If a relationship exists between the development of AUD and
sleep issues that are associated with intoxication, then such a
relationship emerges over the course of multiple days of drinking
and may not be reﬂected by data from a single-night study.
Unfortunately, only very few studies have assessed effects of the
repeated administration of intoxicating doses of alcohol on sleep
over several nights. In studies that investigated SOL over multiple
nights of alcohol administration [28, 39], SOL was reduced across
all three drinking nights [28, 39], with no clear evidence of
adaptation of the effect over the three consecutive nights. The
effects of a decrease in WASO in the ﬁrst half of the night showed
little change over three nights in two studies [28, 39] but showed
evidence of increases over nine nights in another study [45]. WASO
in the second half of the night was elevated relative to baseline

across all drinking nights when all drinking nights were assessed
[28, 39] (not reported in [45]).

For REM sleep, neither Rundell et al. [28] nor Feige et al. [39]
reported systematic effects over the three nights for either the ﬁrst
or the second half of the night (Fig. 2). Prinz et al. [45] reported a
decrease on night 1 that was still present on night 9 for the ﬁrst
half of the night but did not present data for the second half. For
SWS, both Rundell et al. [28] and Feige et al. [39] reported initial
increases for the ﬁrst half of the night that appeared to habituate
over the three nights of the study. For the second half of the night,
both studies reported decreases in SWS that stayed ﬂat over the
three nights (Fig. 2). Prinz et al. [45] reported an initial increase
that was not seen on night 9.

Drawing deﬁnitive conclusions from these three studies is
difﬁcult. In terms of WASO, however, drinking over multiple days
does not appear to lead to habituation of the effects that are seen
in studies of a single night of sleep following intoxication.

Binge/intoxication: sleep effects of alcohol administration in AUD
Experimental studies of the impact of alcohol intoxication on sleep
in healthy controls are useful for providing insights into the ways
in which intoxication might impact sleep and the ways in which
the effects on sleep might contribute to the development of AUD.
However, a clearer understanding of this relationship might be
produced by studying the impact of alcohol intoxication on sleep
in AUD patients. Such studies are not currently possible because of
In the early 1970s,
ethical and treatment guidelines for AUD.
however, a few studies were conducted that are useful for review.
These studies were conducted not long after the development of
consensus standards for sleep scoring [11] with equipment that
had recording and analysis limitations relative to equipment that
is available to investigators today. Thus, some caution needs to be
exercised when looking at absolute values of the data, but relative
changes within datasets can still be informative.

Johnson et al. [53] studied 14 alcoholics for two nights following
days in which they consumed bourbon every 2 h starting at
0800 hours. All of the subjects had a blood alcohol level of at least
0.11 g% at 8:00 PM. SOL did not change substantially in recovery
vs. drinking. WASO and N1 (20% and 22%, respectively) appeared
to be slightly higher when drinking compared with the ﬁrst (18%
and 15%) and last (17% and 18%) recovery nights. SWS decreased
from a very low 3.2–2.1% on the ﬁrst
recovery night but

Allen et al. [54] reported data from six male alcoholics, ﬁve of
whom were studied for 3–7 days while drinking 30 ml of 95% pure
alcohol
in juice every 2 h from 0800 to 2200 hours. All of the
subjects were then denied alcohol and studied for the ﬁrst 7 days
of abstinence. Data were then collected after a further week of
abstinence. The sixth subject was withdrawn from alcohol on
admission and studied for 1 week of withdrawal and then after a
further week of abstinence. For the present review, data are
summarized by averaging all of
the drinking nights and
comparing them to nights off alcohol for the ﬁrst ﬁve subjects.

subjects did not permit the recording of SWS. Subjects were
admitted to the study via emergency room admission and were
given their ﬁrst experimental dose of alcohol within 12 h of their
last drink. They were thus studied after a prolonged period of
intoxication. REM sleep was not completely suppressed by
drinking in this context. REM sleep also did not rebound upon
withdrawal. Instead, it presented gradual recovery that began at
around 4 days of abstinence. Somewhat paradoxically, SOL was
very fast on the ﬁrst withdrawal night but
then increased
dramatically, only normalizing after 1 week of abstinence. WASO
and N1 sleep did not appear to be affected much by drinking or
withdrawal (Supplementary Table S6).

Gross et al. [55] studied four alcoholic men after 6 days of in-
patient treated abstinence. The subjects were studied under two
conditions in a counterbalanced design. They spent 15 days in a
“wet” condition in which they had a baseline of 3 days with no
alcohol,
followed by 1 day of alcohol adaptation, 4 days of
“alcoholization,” 3 days of withdrawal, and 4 days of “recovery.”
The alcoholization days consisted of heavy drinking with an
average consumption of 3.1 g/kg. The dry condition consisted of
the number of nights but with no alcohol adaptation or heavy
drinking. Data from the wet and dry conditions were then
compared across the same nights in the sequence. SOL increased
with alcohol and during initial withdrawal relative to baseline and
recovery. SWS increased with alcohol but was lower than baseline
during initial withdrawal and recovery. REM sleep was suppressed
when drinking but did not show a rebound during withdrawal or
recovery relative to baseline (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Lester et al. [56] studied 17 male alcoholics for two baseline
nights after at least 3 weeks of sobriety and for two nights

(alcohol) following days in which they drank from 1300 until
2100 hours with bedtime blood alcohol levels of 0.15 g% and then
for two nights following withdrawal (recovery) and a subsequent
night after a further week of abstinence. Data were reported
separately for the ﬁrst and second halves of the night. WASO and
N1 decreased with alcohol and then returned to baseline. %REM
in the ﬁrst half of the night decreased from 18.6% at baseline to
12.1% while drinking and returned to 19.3% in withdrawal. In the
second half of the night, it decreased from 33.9% at baseline to
12.1% while drinking and partially recovered to 19.3% during
withdrawal. Slow-wave sleep showed a dramatic increase while
drinking and recovery to slightly above baseline for the ﬁrst half of
the night and substantially above baseline for the second half of
the night when measured during withdrawal
(Supplementary
Table S7).

Wagman and Allen [57] studied six male alcoholics who had
been sober for at least 7 days. Data were collected at baseline and
then during 5 days of receiving 18 ounces of 95% proof alcohol,
followed by 5 days of 26 ounces and then at least 1 day of 32
ounces. Data were then collected after 1 week of abstinence. Only
SWS data were reported. The baseline value of ~3% SWS increased
to ~10% at 18 ounces and then to around 13% at 26 ounces and
16% at 32 ounces, dropping back to 5% after 1 week of no alcohol.
Gross and Hastey [58] studied 10 young male alcoholics for a
baseline period of ~3.5 weeks postadmission. Following the
baseline, they received alcohol (1.6 g/kg on day 1 and 3.2 g/kg on
subsequent days) for either 5 or 7 days. They were then denied
alcohol and studied for 7 days of withdrawal. They were
somewhat arbitrarily divided into two groups based on the
percentage of SWS on the baseline nights. The “low” group had
SWS values between 14 and 29%, and the “high” group had SWS
values between 32 and 44%. In both groups, %SWS was elevated
while drinking relative to baseline and dropped to below baseline
levels upon withdrawal from alcohol, with the appearance of a
gradual recovery over days of abstinence (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Although the focus of the study was on SWS, the authors
reported REM data during withdrawal relative to the values that
were seen at baseline and the minimum value that was seen while
drinking. REM sleep dropped to zero in both groups at some point
over the drinking nights and recovered to baseline (or slightly less
than baseline) on the ﬁrst withdrawal night. For the low SWS
group, REM sleep exceeded baseline on the second withdrawal
night (Supplementary Fig. S3).

The general trends of drinking and withdrawal effects on sleep
variables are summarized in Table 7. Although some variability is

Fig. 3 Difference scores between control and AUD values for sleep onset latency (SOL) and the percentage of total sleep time (TST) spent
awake (WASO%), N1 sleep (N1%), slow-wave sleep (SWS%), and REM sleep (REM%). The dashed horizontal line marks the point of no
difference between controls and AUD. The solid vertical line marks the 30 boundary between short- and long-term abstinence. Data are
presented as a function of the length of time abstinent

observed, as with the data above in normal controls, administer-
ing alcohol to AUD patients leads to an increase in SWS that then
subsequently decreases upon withdrawal. Likewise, drinking
decreases (but does not entirely suppress) REM sleep, with some
variability in recovery upon withdrawal. The binge/intoxication
effects on sleep are summarized in Fig. 1.

SLEEP IN RECENTLY SOBER AUD: WITHDRAWAL/NEGATIVE
AFFECT DOMAIN
Withdrawal/negative affect: effects on sleep
In AUD patients, their ubiquitous, chronic, and long-lasting sleep
issues are a cause of negative affect. Some of the reported high
comorbidity of insomnia and alcoholism [59] may be attributable

to poor sleep habits and irregular sleep-wake schedules that are
an inevitable consequence of drinking. Changes in brain structure,
function, and neurochemistry [5] may also play a role. Certainly,
the incidence of insomnia in AUD has been reported to be as high
as 91% [60].

For the purposes of this review, recent abstinence is somewhat
arbitrarily considered to be within the ﬁrst 30 days, the typical
duration of short inpatient treatment programs. Several studies
are available in which AUD patients at different stages of
abstinence (7–30 days) are compared with control subjects
[56, 61–72]. Data that are
(typically non-AUD social drinkers)
presented in this section thus reﬂect differences between AUD
and control data relative to the time of abstinence in the AUD
groups.

SOL for abstinent AUD in these studies ranged from 35.1 min
longer to 8.3 min shorter than controls and was an average of
10.6 ± 12.2 min longer [56, 61–72]. WASO% for abstinent AUD
ranged from 5.7% less to 18.6% more than in controls and was an
average of 4.1% ± 5.1% more. N1% in abstinent AUD ranged from
1.6% less to 9.7% more than in controls and was an average of
3.7% ± 2.9% more. Short-term abstinent AUD individuals take
longer to get to sleep and have more time awake or in N1
drowsiness (Fig. 3). In the same studies, SWS% in abstinent AUD
ranged from 5.6% higher to 8.6% lower than in controls with a
median of 4.5% lower (and 15 of the 17 datasets showed AUD
lower than controls). Finally, REM sleep in abstinent AUD ranged
from no difference to 9% more than in controls and with a median
of 3.1% more. Short-term abstinent AUD subjects took longer to
get to sleep and had more time awake or more time in N1
drowsiness. Figure 3 shows the values for each of these variables
as a function of the average number of days abstinent in each of
the studies from which they were drawn. What is apparent is that
for all of these measures, data are highly variable, and there is no
trend toward recovery within 30 days.

Withdrawal/negative affect: effects on EEG
The spectral analysis of sleep EEG data was conducted within
30 days of withdrawal in fewer studies. Consistent with reports of a
Irwin et al. [66] reported signiﬁcantly lower
reduction of SWS,
NREM delta power (0.75–4 Hz) across the entire night in alcoholics
who were abstinent for ~30 days relative to controls, particularly in
the ﬁrst NREM period. Irwin et al. [67] studied the impact of sleep
deprivation on SWS and delta EEG power in European American
and African American subjects. Both AUD groups (abstinent before
testing for on average of 23 days) showed a decrease in delta
power relative to controls in the baseline condition, an effect that
was more pronounced in the African American AUD group.
Importantly, neither AUD group showed the typical
increase in
delta power during the recovery night following sleep deprivation
(which was observed in their respective control subjects). They also
saw a trend toward higher beta activity in alcoholics across the
entire night at baseline that became a signiﬁcant difference during
a recovery night following a night of partial sleep deprivation.

Feige et al. [70] studied AUD subjects in the third week of an
inpatient treatment program. Subjects with AUD were divided into
two groups based on relapse status at 3 months posttreatment.
The abstaining group had lower delta power compared with the
relapsing group and controls in N2 sleep. They also reported
higher beta activity during REM sleep in the relapsing group
compared with the abstaining group and controls. Both effects,
although signiﬁcant, were small and inconsistent across two
nights of measurement.

Singh et al.

[72] studied AUD subjects after 2–3 weeks of
treatment and a further week of washout from lorazepam. EEG
analysis was conducted during early NREM sleep (N1+N2), SWS,
and REM sleep at left and right frontal, temporal, parietal, and
occipital sites. Delta power was lower in patients during N1+N2
and SWS at the left and right temporal sites and right parietal and
occipital sites. Alpha power increased in patients during N1+N2 at
the left occipital site, where 30–50 Hz activity was also elevated
during SWS. REM sleep displayed higher beta activity in patients
bilaterally at all sites and higher 30–50 Hz activity at right parietal
and occipital sites.

Another approach to measuring the brain’s ability to generate
delta frequency responses is via auditory evoked responses. A
proportion of stimuli will elicit a single delta waveform response,
known as a K-complex [73]. K-complexes behave much like SWS
and delta power, in which their amplitude decreases with aging
[74], and differences between subjects are at
least partially
attributable to differences in cortical gray matter volume [75]. We
recently conducted a study in which 16 AUD subjects were initially
studied at an average of 17 days of abstinence and then 1 month

and 3 months after the ﬁrst assessment [76]. Control subjects were
also studied at each time point. At the initial assessment, both
trials in which K-complexes were elicited
the proportion of

and the amplitude of the averaged K-complex response sig-

LONG-TERM SLEEP EFFECTS IN ABSTINENT AUD:
PREOCCUPATION/ANTICIPATION DOMAIN
Preoccupation/anticipation: effects on sleep
A few studies investigated sleep in AUD subjects who were
abstinent for >30 days [61, 65, 77–80]. These data are also shown
in Fig. 3.

The ideal design for

studying the effects of

long-term
abstinence includes longitudinal assessments that are conducted
within the same subjects at increasing lengths of time sober.
Rundell et al. [61] studied 20 AUD subjects near the beginning
and again near the end of a 13-week treatment program and
compared them to 20 age-matched controls. SOL, N1%, and REM
sleep were elevated, and SWS decreased at both time points
compared with controls. Some evidence of recovery in SWS and
REM sleep was observed at the second time point. A subset of six
subjects was studied 6 months after release from the hospital. For
these subjects, SWS showed further recovery at 6 months but was
still lower than control values. SOL and REM sleep exhibited no
further recovery from 12 weeks to 6 months.

Williams and Rundell [77] studied 46 AUD subjects in two
sessions: the ﬁrst at 35 days sober and the second at 92 days
sober. SOL was elevated relative to controls at 35 days, with
some partial recovery at 92 days. N1% remained elevated at
both time points. SWS% was lower and REM% was higher in
AUD subjects than in controls at 35 days. Both variables showed
only partial recovery to control values at 92 days. Twenty-four
subjects returned for a third session 9 months after entering the
program. Of these, 14 had resumed drinking, and 10 remained
abstinent. These data are difﬁcult to quantify because the earlier
time points were not separated into these groups. At 9 months,
however, the abstaining AUD subjects had reductions of %
WASO and N1% and more SWS than those who were released.
REM sleep in relapsed AUD subjects was lower than in control
subjects.

Drummond et al. [65] studied 29 AUD subjects at 16 days sober
and again at 19 weeks sober and a group of age-matched
controls. SOL was higher in AUD subjects than in controls at both
time points. WASO remained elevated at 16 days but decreased at
19 weeks. REM sleep remained elevated at both time points, and
SWS was suppressed at both time points. Nine sober AUD subjects
returned for further evaluation at 14 months. These subjects
showed no further improvements in sleep values compared with
subjects at 19 weeks.

When these data are combined with those of others with a
single time point [78–80], the following patterns emerge. SOL for
abstinent AUD in these studies ranged from 15.8 min longer to
2.4 min shorter than controls and was an average of 5.44 ± 5.72
min longer. WASO% for abstinent AUD subjects ranged from 5.1%
less to 8.7% more in controls and was, on average, recovered to
control values (0.27% ± 5.1% less). N1% in abstinent AUD subjects
ranged from 3.3% less to 9.0% more than in controls and was an
average of 3.0% ± 4.1% more. SWS% in abstinent AUD ranged
from 2.4% higher to 6.5% lower than in controls and was an
average of 3.7% ± 3.1% lower. Finally, REM sleep in abstinent AUD
subjects ranged from 3.0% less to 4.7% more than in controls and
was an average of 1.9% ± 2.7% more. Figure 3 shows the values
for each of these variables as a function of the average number
of days abstinent
the studies from which they
were drawn.

Preoccupation/anticipation: effects on EEG
EEG spectral analysis was conducted in 14 AUD subjects and
matched controls by Irwin et al. [79] at 31 ± 28 days sober for data
that were collected in the ﬁrst sleep cycle. During NREM and REM
sleep, delta and theta activity was signiﬁcantly less in AUD
subjects. Beta activity was signiﬁcantly less in NREM sleep, with a
trend toward a decrease in REM sleep. Colrain et al. [80] reported
spectral analysis data from multiple EEG sites in male AUD
subjects who had been sober for an average of 156.6 ± 161.8 days
and female AUD subjects who had been sober for an average of
258 ± 217.1 days. Relative to controls, alcoholics had signiﬁcantly
lower NREM sleep across the whole night and in the ﬁrst NREM
period in the slow (<1 Hz) band and in each of the 1 to <2, 2 to
<3, and 3 to <4 Hz delta EEG bands. The slower end of theta
activity (up to 6 Hz) displayed a similar pattern to delta
frequencies. The effects were more prominent in frontal than
posterior scalp derivations in alcoholic men and women. The delta
effects were not seen in REM sleep. They did not report any
differences in alpha or beta activity during sleep.

In a larger study, Colrain et al.

Two studies evaluated sleep evoked delta responses in AUD.
Nicholas et al. [81] studied seven AUD subjects who had been
abstinent for 70–726 days who met the DSM-IV criteria [82] for
alcohol dependence and eight normal control men. Subjects
with AUD were signiﬁcantly less likely to generate a K-complex
in response to a tone and had signiﬁcantly smaller amplitude
responses.
[83] studied 42
abstinent long-term alcoholics (27 men) and 42 controls (19
men). These subjects were the same as those reported in Colrain
et al. [80] above. Subjects with AUD were signiﬁcantly less likely
to produce K-complexes than controls. Frontal (but not poster-
ior) amplitude of the average response was signiﬁcantly smaller
in AUD subjects. A subset of 15 of the AUD subjects was
followed for a further 12 months and had signiﬁcantly higher
amplitudes of the average K-complex response [84]. Finally, in
the Willoughby et al. study [76] above, no further recovery was
observed in either the proportion of trials in which K-complexes
were elicited or
the average K-complex
response at 3 months sober over that seen at 1 month sober.

SEX DIFFERENCES IN SLEEP INTERACTIONS WITH ALCOHOL
AND AUD
Few studies have investigated the inﬂuence of sex differences on
the ways in which drinking to intoxication, withdrawal, and
protracted abstinence affect sleep. Sex differences have been
reported in drinking patterns and pharmacokinetics of alcohol.
Women tend to have less body water and more body fat than
men and thus tend to have higher blood alcohol levels than men
after consuming the same amount of alcohol because of alcohol’s
hydrophilic properties [85]. Historically, AUD has been around ﬁve-
times more prevalent among men than among women, but the
gender gap is decreasing with regard to both alcohol consump-
tion and AUD, at least in the United States [86, 87], including binge
drinking [88]. Women are more vulnerable to the development of
alcohol-related diseases, such as liver cirrhosis [89], cardiomyo-
pathy [90], and cancer [91]. Alcohol-dependent women have
worse quality-of-life scores than alcohol-dependent men [92].
However, although the risk of developing insomnia is 1.41-times
higher in women [93], no sex differences were found in the
frequency of
insomnia in men and women who underwent
treatment for alcohol dependence [94].

As shown in Table 1–6, most studies of the effects of acute
alcohol on sleep either did not investigate female subjects or had
sample sizes that were too small
to evaluate possible sex
differences in the data. The two studies with sufﬁcient numbers
of men and women reported different results. Arnedt et al. [40]

found that drinking to intoxication resulted in more sleep
disturbances (i.e., decrease in sleep efﬁciency and increase in
wakefulness) but a similar impact on sleep architecture (i.e., %SWS
and %REM sleep)
in healthy women compared with men.
However, Chan et al. [42] found no sex differences in the effects
of alcohol on sleep in older adolescents.

Most studies of early withdrawal and extended abstinence have
also either used only male subjects or did not evaluate sex
differences. Colrain et al. [80] reported that women had better
sleep efﬁciency and more delta activity during NREM sleep than
men, regardless of diagnosis, and that men with AUD appeared to
present a more pronounced reduction of delta activity during
NREM sleep than women with AUD. Furthermore, estimated
lifetime alcohol consumption predicted the percentage of SWS in
men with AUD but not in women with AUD. Estimated lifetime
alcohol consumption was higher
in alcoholic men than in
alcoholic women, and the women had longer periods of sobriety
prior to testing.

With the growing prevalence of AUD in women, studies need to
include larger samples of men and women with AUD to further
evaluate possible sex differences in the effects of drinking to
intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, and protracted abstinence
on sleep.

POSSIBLE NEUROCHEMICAL MECHANISMS OF THE EFFECTS
OF ALCOHOL ON SLEEP, PARALLELED BY NEUROCHEMICAL
CHANGES ACROSS THE ADDICTION CYCLE
Sleep is associated with a complex set of interactions between
two major neurotransmitter systems: acetylcholine and norepi-
nephrine (for review, see [95, 96]). For example, NREM sleep is a
period during which cholinergic and noradrenergic brainstem
arousal mechanisms are dramatically reduced. The transitions
between NREM and REM sleep involve a complex interaction
between REM-on and REM-off neuronal groups in the brainstem.
REM-on groups largely consist of cholinergic cells in the lateral
dorsal
tegmentum (LDT) and pedunculopontine tegmental
nucleus (PPT). REM-off cells involve serotonergic neurons in the
dorsal raphe nucleus and noradrenergic locus coeruleus. A set of
reciprocal
interactions between the two groups of neurons,
whereby REM-on neurons are inﬂuenced by a self-excitatory loop
but also have an excitatory link to REM-off neurons, has long been
hypothesized, a model that was originally developed by McCarley
and Hobson [97]. REM-off cells dominate once a threshold of
activation is reached, and they have an inhibitory action on REM-
on cells but are also part of a self-inhibitory feedback loop that
progressively decreases their activity. Eventually, REM-off cell
activity drops below a threshold, and REM-on cells regain
dominance.
Alcohol

interacts with both cholinergic and noradrenergic
brainstem systems but possibly via some of the same neuro-
transmitter circuitry that is involved in mediating the incentive
surfeit, and
salience/pathological habit,
executive function domains that are described above. For the
purposes of this review, we explore the effects of alcohol on the
neurotransmitter systems that are considered key to the addiction
cycle outlined above.

reward deﬁcit/stress

Neurochemistry of sleep relevant to the binge/intoxication stage
GABA. The acute effects of alcohol on decreasing sleep latency,
increasing SWS, and increasing EEG delta power can possibly be
explained by the GABA receptor agonist properties of alcohol.
Alcohol exposure leads to the presynaptic release of GABA
throughout the CNS. Within the thalamus, the hyperpolarizing
effect of GABA causes the opening of low-threshold Ca2+ ion
channels and a pattern of synchronized burst ﬁring that manifests
as sleep spindles on the sleep EEG. The further release of GABA
causes greater levels of hyperpolarization and the production of

Neuropsychopharmacology (2020) 45:141 – 165

delta EEG waveforms [98]. The subsequent withdrawal of tonic
input to the reticular nucleus allows the release of GABA and
inhibition of thalamo-cortical circuits [99]. These effects, plus the
alcohol-induced release of GABA in the brainstem [100], may also
play a role in alcohol’s suppression of REM sleep in the context of
high doses of alcohol.

The increase in delta activity that is produced by acute alcohol
early in the night is also consistent with alcohol’s GABA receptor
agonist properties. EEG delta activity is partially mediated by the
GABA-induced hyperpolarization of cortical and thalamo-cortical
neurons [99]. There is evidence that acute alcohol modulates
metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated slow currents
[2] that are thought to underlie the slow oscillation of thalamo-
cortical cell activity that underlies delta generation [101]. Further
hyperpolarization can lead to the cessation of spindle activity and
the development of delta activity [102]. Sleep spindles (associated
with sigma frequency power) are produced when thalamo-cortical
cells become hyperpolarized, resulting in low-threshold spikes and
the generation of spindle frequency activity in thalamic reticular
cells [102]. Alcohol consumption causes a decrease in sigma
power
[50], but benzodiazepines cause spindle and sigma
facilitation [103]. These ﬁndings are consistent with older
data that show inverse effects of benzodiazepines on sigma and
delta activity [104]. Recent work identiﬁed an important role for
GABAergic interneurons that act to facilitate the REM-off process
[105]. Alcohol may inﬂuence this REM-off process through its
effects on GABA, leading to the suppression of REM sleep in the
short-term.

its

[106]. However,

Dopamine. Historically multiple neurotransmitter systems—nor-
epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, adenosine, hypo-
cretin/orexin, and dopamine—have been studied in the context of
behavioral arousal. Neurons in the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe
nucleus, and tuberomammillary nucleus ﬁre fastest during
wakefulness, slow during non-REM sleep, and nearly stop ﬁring
completely during REM sleep. Cholinergic neuron ﬁring contri-
butes to arousal and REM sleep. However, these neurotransmitter
systems are only indirectly related to the acute reinforcing effects
of alcohol. In contrast, the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system
plays a key role in incentive salience and begins the process of
pathological habits
role in sleep-wake
regulation has been scarcely studied. The dopamine neuron ﬁring
rate varies little between sleep and wake states [107, 108],
although lesions of dopamine cell groups
in the ventral
tegmentum that project to the forebrain signiﬁcantly reduced
behavioral arousal in rats [109]. Parkinson’s disease patients, who
exhibit pronounced dopamine lesions, experience severe sleep
disorders [110, 111]. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors have been
clearly implicated in the induction of hyperarousal [112]. The
existence of sleep state-dependent dopaminergic neurons has
been reported in the ventral periaqueductal gray [113]. The
presynaptic activation of dopamine transmission is a key
pharmacological property that mediates the wake-promoting
effects of stimulants [114, 115]. Thus, dopamine may play a role in
sleep regulation at least indirectly through arousal mechanisms
via the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and possibly more
directly via dopamine networks that are outside of the classic
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.

Opioid peptides. Alcohol at intoxicating doses releases opioid
peptides that interact with the same receptors as opioid drugs
[116]. Opioids increase wakefulness and decrease REM sleep
[3, 117]. In rats, low doses of morphine decrease sleep behavior,
measured by EEGs of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and sleep efﬁciency
[118]. The morphine-induced inhibition of REM sleep was localized
to the medial pontine reticular formation in cats [119]. This
observation was replicated in cats for selective μ but not δ or κ
opioid receptor agonists [120]. In rats, a μ opioid receptor agonist

153

increased wakefulness when injected in the ventrolateral preoptic
nucleus, and infusion of the selective μ opioid receptor antagonist
CTAP in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus promoted sleep,
suggesting that endogenous μ opioid receptor agonists may
participate in maintaining arousal via the ventrolateral preoptic
nucleus [121]. However, the microinjection of μ opioid receptor
agonists in the nucleus of the solitary tract produced SWS [122],
suggesting a μ opioid receptor interaction with other sleep-
regulatory systems.

In terms of how endogenous opioids interact with sleep
disturbances that are produced by AUD, chronic opioid use has
been hypothesized to cause sleep disturbances and excessive
daytime sleepiness and fatigue [123]. Sleep architecture studies
have revealed different effects of morphine-like opioids that
depend on the phase of opioid use [3]. During the induction
phase, the use of morphine-like opioids signiﬁcantly disrupts
sleep, reduces REM sleep and SWS, and increases wakefulness and
arousals from sleep. During the maintenance phase of opioid use,
decreases in SWS and REM sleep and increases in wakefulness
tend to normalize. During the withdrawal stage, signiﬁcant
insomnia is a major complaint during chronic opioid withdrawal,
accompanied by frequent arousals and decreases in REM sleep [3].
During the protracted abstinence phase after chronic methadone
use, TST signiﬁcantly increased with rebound SWS and REM sleep

methadone use [124].

Neurochemistry of sleep relevant to the withdrawal/negative
affect stage
GABA within-system neuroadaptations.
Sleep EEG effects in indivi-
duals with long-term alcohol dependence are opposite to those
after acute alcohol administration. One possible mechanism involves
within-system neuroadaptations even during the course of a bout of
intoxication as discussed above. Chronic alcohol-induced alterations
of the responsiveness of GABA mechanisms include the allosteric
modiﬁcation of GABA receptors [7, 8] and a reduction of GABAA
receptor function [7, 125] in rodent models of alcohol dependence.
Thus, the downregulation of brainstem GABAergic systems following
the development of alcohol dependence leads to the diminished
activity of REM-off systems and subsequently a greater propensity
for REM sleep. The downregulation of GABA systems could also
partially explain the decrease in both delta power and the amplitude
of evoked delta responses in abstinent alcoholics. However, there
are other possible within-system mechanisms that may contribute
to the disruption of sleep architecture during acute withdrawal and
protracted abstinence. For example, the loss of dopamine function
during acute withdrawal may contribute to malaise and hypoarousal
that also could result in rebound sleepiness in late withdrawal.

Hypocretin between-system neuroadaptations. With regard to
between-system neuroadaptations, all of the neurotransmitter
systems that are hypothesized to act in the extended amygdala to
targets for
promote negative emotional states are potential
between-system opponent processes that could contribute to
sleep disturbances in the withdrawal/negative affect stage. These
include (in order of
sleep-related prominence) hypocretin,
norepinephrine, glucocorticoids, and neuroimmune factors.

Hypocretin/orexin peptides have been implicated in sleep-wake
regulation since their initial discovery [126]. They have wide
projections in the brain [127],
interacting with autonomic,
neuroendocrine, and neuroregulatory systems [128–135]. Perhaps
most well known is that the hypocretin system makes a key
contribution to the etiology of narcolepsy. In two different animal
models with impairments in the hypocretin/orexin system (i.e.,
genetic narcoleptic dogs with a mutation of the hypocretin
receptor 2 [Hcrt-2] gene [136] and mice with a null mutation of the
preprohypocretin gene that produces hypocretin-1 and hypocre-
tin-2 peptides [137]), symptoms of narcolepsy were observed,

suggesting that impairment of the hypocretin/orexin system may
underlie the syndrome of human narcolepsy. Human narcoleptic
patients presented dramatic reductions (85–95%) of cerebrospinal
ﬂuid hypocretin-1 [138] and the number of hypocretin neurons
[139, 140],
leading to the hypothesis that narcolepsy could be
related to the ongoing loss of hypocretin neurons [141].

systems

Hypocretins modulate key sleep systems,

including norepi-
nephrine [130, 142–144] and acetylcholine [145]. Hypocretins also
modulate serotonergic [146, 147], histaminergic [148], and
dopaminergic
and the hypothalamic-
[149, 150]
(HPA) axis [151–153]. The hypocretin/orexin
pituitary-adrenal
system stabilizes the ﬁring of brainstem neurons that control
wakefulness and REM sleep (cholinergic in the LDT/PPT, nora-
drenergic in the locus coeruleus). Notably, hypocretin neurons
discharge during waking, especially with movement [154, 155].
Thus, unsurprising is that when these neurons are lost, such as in
narcolepsy, patients present excessive daytime sleepiness and
frequent sleep attacks.

The hypocretin/orexin system is thought to be a key regulator
that stabilizes the ﬁring of brainstem neurons that control
wakefulness [156]. The silencing of hypocretin neurons using
optogenetics or DREADDs that allow the modulation of neural
induces
activity with the temporal resolution of several hours,
sleep during the light phase but not during the dark phase
[157, 158]
(although this approach may also affect other
neurotransmitter systems). This supports the hypothesis that the
hypocretin system acts as a regulator of behavioral states by
modulating the arousal threshold [126] so that the organism can
maintain appropriate and adequate wakefulness to cope with
ﬂuctuations of external and internal environments [156]. The
overactivation of hypocretin/orexin peptides during drug with-
drawal may cause destabilization of the boundaries between
arousal sleep states that are found in acute and protracted
abstinence. Numerous

Norepinephrine between-system neuroadaptations. Norepinephrine
has long been associated with promoting wakefulness. This action of
norepinephrine in vivo likely involves the activation of α1 adrenergic
receptors, in which drugs that antagonize α1 adrenergic receptors
facilitate sleep onset [161]. This is likely a postsynaptic action of
norepinephrine, whereas α2 adrenergic receptor antagonists, which
presynaptically increase norepinephrine release, delay sleep.
In
contrast, α2 adrenergic receptor agonists inhibit norepinephrine
release and decrease wakefulness [161, 162]. Drugs that block the
uptake of norepinephrine increase or prolong wakefulness [163].
Neurochemical microdialysis studies have shown that extracellular
levels of norepinephrine decrease in the transition from wakefulness
to sleep [164, 165], and lesions of neurons in the locus coeruleus
decrease waking [166].

Noradrenergic systems have also long been associated with
alcohol dependence. Adrenergic receptor antagonists decreased
dependence-induced drinking in rats. Although the locus coeruleus
may not be directly implicated in the negative emotional states that
are associated with alcohol withdrawal and protracted abstinence,
sub-coeruleus noradrenergic projections to the bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis modulate negative emotional states that are
associated with opioid withdrawal and protracted abstinence [167].

Glucocorticoids, CRF, and vasopressin between-system neuroadapta-
tions. One of the major bodily responses to acute stress that is
associated with alcohol withdrawal is an elevation of glucocorti-
coids and the concomitant activation of extrahypothalamic stress
systems [10]. The chronic ingestion of alcohol leads to a blunted

hypothalamic control of the HPA axis by CRF. However, at the
same time, glucocorticoids sensitize the extrahypothalamic CRF
system in the extended amygdala [168]. Both of these responses
can contribute to the effects of alcohol in the withdrawal/negative
affect stage of the addiction cycle.

increases cortisol

Excessive activation of the HPA axis induces sleep debt [169],
and sleep debt
levels [170]. Patients with
insomnia without depression presented high levels of cortisol,
mainly in the evening and at sleep onset [171]. In clinical practice,
the use of pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids is associated
with sleep disturbances [172]. When steroids were administered as
a short-term treatment in a multicenter, placebo-controlled study
insomnia was one of the most commonly
for optic neuritis,
reported side effects [173]. Others have seen in humans a marked
drop of cortisol
levels during napping, followed by a transient
increase during the postnap period [174]. The administration of
glucocorticoids in humans can signiﬁcantly suppress REM sleep
[175] and cause a modest increase in SWS [176]. Altogether,
human studies suggest that the HPA axis may contribute to the
initiation and perpetuation of chronic insomnia [170].

An increase in cortisol may also be a marker of CRF and
norepinephrine activity during the night, particularly because
glucocorticoids can drive extrahypothalamic CRF activation. The
intracerebroventricular administration of CRF increases EEG
frequency and wakefulness and decreases SWS [177]. Other
studies that reported decreases in SWS with elevated cortisol
levels may indicate excessive glucocorticoid receptor activation in
the amygdala, presumably via CRF. These positive feedback effects
are opposite to the known inhibitory actions on CRF that are
found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and
anterior pituitary [176].

Chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids is a key part of
Cushing’s syndrome. Consistent alterations of sleep (e.g., decrease
in SWS, increase in sleep latency, increase in wake time, decrease
in REM latency, and increase in REM density) have been reported
In Cushing’s syndrome with PSG recordings [178]. Given the
hormonal and affective proﬁles that are common in Cushing’s
syndrome and severe AUD, one could argue that the CRF-HPA axis
may contribute to sleep disturbances that are associated with
AUD, and sleep disturbances may contribute to dysregulation of
the CRF-HPA axis in a feed-forward allostatic framework.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is also involved in the regulation of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and consequent
glucocorticoid release [179]. Similar to CRF, AVP serves extrahy-
pothalamically as a neurotransmitter [180]. A human study reported
the sleep-associated inhibition of stimulated ACTH and cortisol
release, suggesting a period of lower responsiveness of the pituitary-
adrenocortical axis to AVP during early sleep [181]. Given the parallels
between CRF and AVP in controlling the HPA axis and sleep
regulation and given the role of CRF, glucocorticoids, and vasopressin
in excessive drinking that is associated with alcohol dependence
[168, 182], one could speculate on similar parallels in extrahypotha-
lamic control over sleep and possible alcohol interactions.

Neuroimmune between-system neuroadaptations. Cytokines are
intercellular signaling peptides that are released by immune cells,
neurons, and astrocytes and have been hypothesized to be
activated during alcohol withdrawal [95, 183] and also inﬂuence
sleep [161, 184], albeit via actions on possibly different circuits.
During infections, bacterial cell wall products, such as lipopolysac-
charide, may trigger the production of cytokines that then increase
NREM sleep and reduce REM sleep [185]. Several cytokines,
including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-
α), promote sleep [184, 186]. The administration of IL-1β and TNF-α
in the preoptic area in rats reduced ﬁring rates of wake-active
neurons and promoted NREM sleep. IL-1β injections in the locus
coeruleus [187] and dorsal raphe nuclei [188] promoted NREM
sleep [184, 189, 190]. A physiological role for IL-1β and TNF-α

Neuropsychopharmacology (2020) 45:141 – 165

signaling in sleep can be argued based on observations in which
the blockade of IL-1β and TNF-α signaling via the deletion of their
receptors reduced spontaneous NREM sleep [191, 192]. Consistent
with this hypothesis, cytokine levels in young, healthy individuals
peaked during sleep [193], and a temporal relationship was found
between sleep and IL-1β activity [194].
In a study of circadian
patterns in humans, IL-6 was secreted at baseline in a biphasic
circadian pattern, with a late-night peak [195].

A direct interaction between cytokines, sleep, and AUD was
demonstrated by the observation that administration of the TNF-α
antagonist etanercept led to the normalization of REM sleep in 18
abstinent alcoholics [196]. Cytokines have been implicated in
negative emotional states that drive negative reinforcement in
animal models of alcohol dependence [197] and may contribute to
the activation of CRF systems in the extended amygdala during
alcohol dependence [198].

Neuropeptide Y and endocannabinoid between-system neuroadap-
tations. Both NPY and endocannabinoids have been implicated
in neuroadaptations that are associated with the development
and persistence of alcohol dependence. Both neurochemical
systems have been hypothesized to serve as a buffer to the
activation of the brain stress systems during acute and protracted
abstinence in alcohol dependence [24, 199]. Animal and human
studies have reported sleep-promoting effects of NPY [200].
In
animal studies, NPY increased EEG synchronization and increased
sleep continuity [201, 202]. One mechanism that was hypothe-
sized for NPY’s sleep-promoting effects was a decrease in
norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus [201]. Others have reported
increases in wakefulness, activity, and eating with intracerebro-
ventricular and intra-lateral hypothalamic administration of NPY in
rats but an effect that was limited to this behaviorally active state
[203, 204]. In humans, repeated intravenous NPY administration in
young healthy subjects decreased sleep latency, decreased the
ﬁrst REM sleep period, and increased Stage 2 sleep time [205]. The
secretion of cortisol and ACTH was blunted after NPY administra-
tion [205]. The sedative and anxiolytic-like effects of centrally
administered NPY are consistent with its hypothesized anti-stress
buffering role under environmental challenge and its hypothe-
sized hypoactivity during alcohol withdrawal [206].

Marijuana and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol are well documented to
increase sleep in humans [207]. Endocannabinoids also increase
sleep. More speciﬁcally, exogenously administered CB1 receptor
agonists enhance NREM sleep in rats and humans [208, 209]. The
administration of CB1 receptor antagonists increased wake time
and reduced NREM sleep time in rats [210, 211]. Anandamide
administration in the PPT decreased wakefulness and increased
SWS, and these effects were reversed by a CB1 receptor antagonist
[212]. One hypothesis is that endocannabinoids act in the pons
and medulla to enhance the release of acetylcholine [207].

In a study that employed a microanalysis approach to investigate
the role of endocannabinoids in up-state/down-state transitions in
sleep that were recorded from pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal
cortex, the endocannabinoid system was shown to regulate up-
states and sleep, serving as a neuromodulatory system that is
intrinsic to cortical microcircuitry [213]. In this study, CB1 receptor
knockout mice exhibited an increase in wakefulness as a result of
reductions of NREM sleep and NREM bout duration. During recovery
from forced sleep deprivation, the knockout mice exhibited a
reduction of NREM delta power and an increase in sleep
fragmentation, consistent with increases in cortical excitability. The
authors hypothesized that local neuromodulatory systems may tune
network activity by regulating both excitatory and inhibitory
neurotransmission within local cortical circuits,
in which the
activation of CB1 receptor endocannabinoid signaling in layer 5
pyramidal neurons may serve to selectively decrease the efﬁcacy of
a subset of excitatory inputs [214]. Neuropeptide Y and endocanna-
binoids have been hypothesized to buffer increases in stress-like

responses and increases in drinking during alcohol withdrawal in
animal models of alcohol dependence [206, 215, 216], suggesting a
common parallel neurochemical substrate for alcohol withdrawal-
induced changes in sleep and alcohol seeking, albeit through
different neurocircuits. Thus, the same opponent-process neuro-
chemical actions
that are produced during between-system
neuroadaptations in the withdrawal/negative affect stage may be
paralleled by actions on sleep systems that contribute to sleep
disturbances in the withdrawal/negative affect stage.

Neurochemistry of sleep relevant to the preoccupation/
anticipation stage
Glutamate. Glutamate neurons are ubiquitous in the brain and
distributed throughout the forebrain and brainstem. They are
hypothesized, together with GABA neurons, to comprise effector
neurons that are associated with EEG changes that underlie sleep-
wake states. Glutamate has been proposed to be the main
regulator of arousal [1]. For example, the glutamatergic medial
parabrachial nucleus in the dorsal pontine tegmentum that
projects via the basal forebrain to the cerebral cortex regulates
arousal [217]. In REM sleep, REM-on brainstem nuclei that contain
acetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA promote activity in the basal
forebrain and cortex and induce muscle atonia and rapid eye
movements [218]. Fos-labeled neurons in the sublaterodorsal
tegmental nucleus that trigger REM sleep were shown to be
glutamatergic, measured by vGlut2 expression [219]. Finally, based
on the anatomical and biochemical properties of astrocytes,
others have proposed a mechanism by which astrocytes play a
role as an energy provider through the release of lactate that is
used as an energy substrate by glutamatergic neurons [220].
These results indicate that glutamate is a key player that drives the
wake portion of the sleep-wake state.

However, the role of glutamate as a presumed sleep-wake
effector neuron is more complicated, given the functional
heterogeneity and intermingling of glutamate cell
types in
multiple regions, such that
the stimulation of all glutamate
neurons in any region may have opposing effects [221]. Never-
theless, a microanalysis of different effector neurons of sleep-wake
states showed that 20% of Wake-max active (discharge maximally)
cells were entirely glutamate-containing and also assumed to give
rise to projections into the brainstem reticular formation and
possibly spinal cord to inﬂuence behavior and EMG activity
the photo- or chemostimulation of
indirectly [221].
genetically tagged glutamate neurons commonly evokes cortical
activation [222, 223], likely reﬂecting the fact that glutamate is a
prominent neurotransmitter by Wake/Paradoxical Sleep-max
active neurons [221].

Indeed,

Chronic alcohol has long been associated with the dysregula-
tion of glutamate activity, in which increases in glutamate function
are associated with prolonged abstinence [224, 225]. Given the
key role of glutamate in the neurocircuitry of relapse [226], cellular
effects of alcohol on glutamate systems during protracted
abstinence may generalize to the neurocircuits that drive sleep-
wake transitions.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATING INSOMNIA IN AUD AND
ABSTINENCE
Insomnia and AUD
The previous section of
this review focused on laboratory
measures of sleep and showed that some PSG characteristics of
sleep in AUD can persist for months or even years. However,
insomnia is a subjective complaint, and its diagnosis does not
require PSG to be conducted. Indeed, individuals with insomnia
can sometimes have their symptoms masked by sleeping in an
unfamiliar environment, such as a laboratory [227, 228].

The current deﬁnition of “insomnia disorder” is dissatisfaction
with sleep despite having adequate opportunity for sleep that lasts

for 3 months and occurs three or more times per week. Insomnia is
deﬁned by difﬁculties in initiating sleep and/or maintaining sleep
and/or early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep,
and these sleep disturbances must cause clinically signiﬁcant
distress or impairments in daytime functioning. Importantly in the
context of insomnia in AUD patients, the DSM-5 removed the
distinction that was made in previous versions of the DSM between
primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia. Similarly, the recent
International Classiﬁcation of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition [229],
grouped the secondary categories of
insomnia and several
insomnia,” “idiopathic insomnia,”
subtypes (“psychophysiological
“inadequate sleep hygiene,” and “paradoxical
insomnia”) into a
single category of “chronic insomnia disorder.” For both groups, the
diagnosis is made independent of PSG and based entirely on
subjective reports by the patient. Severity can be measured by such
instruments as the Insomnia Severity Index [230], in which subjects
rate the perceived severity of their problems, indicate how much
they interfere with daytime function, indicate how noticeable the
sleep issues are to others, and indicate the extent to which they are
worried by the condition.

There is a higher prevalence of AUD in insomnia patients than
in good sleepers. For example, Ford and Kamerow [231] reported
nearly double the prevalence of AUD in insomnia (7.0%) relative to
those with no sleep complaints (3.8%). Weissman et al. [232]
insomnia patients
reported similar differences, with 3.3% of
having AUD vs. 1.8% of normal sleepers. Notably,
in a cross-
sectional study of 1200 health maintenance organization mem-
bers in Michigan, the prevalence of alcohol abuse or dependence
was found to be 30% in those with insomnia. However, consistent
with Ford and Kerow [231] and Weissman et al. [232], the gender-
adjusted odds ratio for AUD was 2.0 (1.3–3.0) relative to those with
no sleep disturbances [233].

Insomnia has a high prevalence in AUD [30]. Brower [234]
compiled data from 13 studies across 3173 patients to yield a
prevalence of 58.4%, although there was a large amount of
variance in the data that the authors ascribed to such factors as
differences in sample characteristics and the deﬁnitions that were
used for both alcohol problems and insomnia.

Insomnia can precede AUD [233] and is also a symptom of alcohol
withdrawal in both acute and protracted abstinence. Brooks et al.
[235] studied 33 AUD patients on admission, during and 1 week
prior to discharge from a National
Institutes of Health clinical
research inpatient treatment program. Twenty-eight patients also
participated in a postdischarge study visit 4–6 weeks after discharge.
Although the proportion of patients with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index score >5 decreased from predischarge (69.7%) to post-
discharge, both numbers were very high relative to the general
population.
Persistent

insomnia over months of abstinence has been
observed in numerous studies [234]. In a study of 267 alcohol-
dependent patients who entered inpatient and outpatient
programs, 103 (47%) had baseline insomnia based on a
questionnaire [236]. Even at the 6-month follow-up, 25% (26 of
103) showed persistent
the
previous 3 months [236]. Such persistent sleep abnormalities in
AUD have been validated by PSG measures [94]. Sleep architec-
ture, such as an increase in the percentage of Stage 1 sleep (N1 or
light sleep), a decrease in the percentage of N3 or SWS (deep
sleep), and an increase in REM%, was observed up to 27 months
[80, 94, 234]. These alterations of REM sleep, including an increase
in REM% and a decrease in REM latency (minutes from sleep onset
to the ﬁrst REM period), were characterized as an increase in REM

experience an increase in dreaming and/or an increase in vivid

reports also predicted relapse (for review, see [234]), as did the
use of alcohol or hypnotics to help sleep upon admission to
treatment [238].

insomnia despite abstinence for

Sleep interactions may not be restricted to AUD; they may also
extend to risky drinking. Insomnia can precede and predict alcohol
use in adolescents [239]. Poor sleep quality and insufﬁcient TST
have been shown to exacerbate associations between college
drinking and negative drinking consequences of risky drinking
[240–242]. In a 2-month prospective study of 157 college drinkers,
students who reported higher sleep-related functional impairment
experienced consistently high levels of negative drinking con-
sequences, regardless of their risky drinking levels [242]. For a
review of the relationship between sleep problems and adoles-
cent AUD, see Hasler et al. [243]. Alcohol problem severity may
also predict sleep disturbances. For problem drinkers, alcohol
problem severity was predictive of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index global score for sleep disturbance [244].
Intervention
research suggests that targeting sleep problems among college
drinkers may result in a decrease in alcohol use and related
consequences [245, 246].

Treatment of insomnia and AUD
Sleep measures have also been included in numerous treatment
studies and can provide some insights into whether treating
insomnia in AUD contributes to abstinence or whether treating
alcohol addiction improves sleep. One can divide such studies into
two categories: those in which a sleep medication is applied to
subjects with AUD and those in which an AUD medication is
applied to treat AUD. The former category answers the question
about whether treating insomnia contributes to abstinence.

As reviewed by Brower [234] and Chakravorty et al. [31], a
number of randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that
the treatment of insomnia and the treatment of AUD can be
dissociated (Table 8). Some treatments that improve sleep in
alcohol-dependent patients have no effect on drinking [247–249]
or even worsen drinking [250]. Cognitive behavior therapy was
shown to improve sleep but not drinking in two studies [247, 248].
Two drugs that improved sleep but not alcohol drinking include
quetiapine [249] and trazadone [250].

Another rationale for the treatment of sleep disorders in AUD is
that, retrospectively, subjects with AUD reported the presence of
insomnia prior to the onset of AUD [251]. Many sleep studies have
also revealed that sleep disturbances predict subsequent alcohol
consumption in adolescents and adults [233, 252, 253]. One
hypothesis for this association is that subjects may self-medicate
their insomnia with alcohol [254, 255]. Finally, another beneﬁt of
treating insomnia is that it may provide symptom relief, improve
quality of life, and improve functioning [234, 256].

Some investigators have argued that brief behavioral therapies
are the treatment of choice for continued sleep disturbances
during protracted abstinence because they have long-lasting
beneﬁts without causing negative effects on drinking outcomes
[234]. One could argue that medications may work more quickly
but inevitably alter sleep architecture themselves and have side
effects, all of which may worsen drinking outcomes. One approach
would be to use Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
medications with the least risk of side effects,
including abuse
potential, such as ramelteon and low-dose doxepin [234]. Non-
prescription antihistamines may also work for some patients as
alternatives to doxepin, which is also thought to work through the
histaminergic system.

Treatment of AUD and insomnia
One reasonable conclusion is that if risky drinking and AUD cause
insomnia and disturbances in sleep architecture, then successfully
treating AUD would also treat sleep disturbances. However, such
data are limited, largely because of the lack of studies and paucity
of effective treatments for AUD. Acamprosate was approved by
the FDA in 2004 as a medication for the treatment of AUD [257].
European trials of acamprosate for the treatment of AUD found a
signiﬁcant beneﬁt for the maintenance of abstinence following

tive, two of these studies showed that acamprosate improved
sleep continuity, restored Stage 3 sleep, and increased REM sleep
latency, all of which are related to relapse to AUD. There are no
published studies of sleep measures with naltrexone and AUD
[259, 260]. Sleep has not been studied in clinical

Another drug that has been shown to improve sleep and
decrease alcohol drinking is gabapentin [265]. Gabapentin is an
anticonvulsant that is approved by the FDA for neurogenic pain
and restless leg syndrome. It is also on the Veterans Administra-
tion formulary for use as a secondary treatment for AUD (https://

2019). Gabapentin has been studied as a medication for the

showed that subjects who received gabapentin, particularly the

that gabapentin may be particularly helpful for substance use
disorder patients who have an arousal, anxiety, and sleep
disturbance component because it is used to treat restless leg
syndrome and can improve drinking outcomes [234, 265].
Interestingly, the studies above that showed beneﬁcial effects of
gabapentin on AUD outcomes and sleep used immediate-release
formulations, but a recent study that used an extended-release
formulation did not show beneﬁts for either AUD or sleep
outcomes [269].

Nevertheless, given the paucity of data, it is difﬁcult to dissociate
the argument that treating sleep helps to treat alcohol addiction or
that treating alcohol addiction helps to treat sleep disturbances.
Obviously, the latter is a logical extension of considering sleep
disturbances as a key symptom of protracted abstinence and a
trigger for relapse. However, resolving these issues will require larger
trials, more ﬁne-grained analyses of sleep outcomes over time in
clinical studies, the use of sleep-speciﬁc mediations (e.g., hypocretin
receptor antagonists), and the advent of more medications that are
effective in treating AUD. In this context, a clinical trial is about to
begin in Australia,
in which suvorexant, a hypocretin receptor
antagonist, will be evaluated in terms of its ability to positively

Alcohol use disorder is a devastating chronic disease that has
major negative impacts on the lives of patients and their families.
The pathway to the development of AUD often involves binge
drinking to high levels of intoxication that leads to a compulsion
to consume it, the loss of control in limiting consumption, and a
transition to the “negative reinforcement side” when consumption
occurs to stave off the negative consequences of withdrawal. This
cascade of events that occurs over an extended period of time has
thus been framed as a three-stage cycle: binge/intoxication,
withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation (“crav-
ing”). These stages map onto the dysregulation of functional
domains of incentive salience/habits, negative emotional states,
and executive function.

There is a substantial body of scientiﬁc work that supports the
hypothesis that AUD is a brain neurocircuitry disorder and that
neuroadaptations within speciﬁc motivational circuits play an
important role in deﬁning and perpetuating the disorder. During
the binge/intoxication stage, pathological habits are at
least
partially attributable to the excessive engagement of reward
circuitry,
leading to high incentive salience for such factors as
contextual cues that are related to alcohol consumption. The
intoxicating and incentive salience effects of alcohol are

underpinned by circuits that converge on the nucleus accumbens
that involve GABA, glutamate, endogenous opioids, and dopa-
mine. Glutamate and dopamine also act on the basal ganglia to
support the development of pathological habits. The negative
emotional state that is experienced in the withdrawal/negative
affect stage is hypothesized to involve the extended amygdala,
including the nucleus accumbens. The negative emotional effects
may be related to the loss of function of endogenous opioids,
GABA, and dopamine and the recruitment of arousal/stress factors,
such as CRF, norepinephrine, hypocretin, and dynorphin, produ-
cing a gain in stress reactivity. The extended preoccupation/
anticipation stage in AUD that lasts long into abstinence involves
compromised frontal cortical executive function and the dysre-
gulation of substrates that mediate craving. These may be related
to the dysregulation of glutamatergic projections from the frontal
cortex and basolateral amygdala to the nucleus accumbens [27].
They may also be related to irreversible changes in the structure
and function of the prefrontal cortex and neuronal connections
that subserve circuits that link the prefrontal cortex to other parts
of the brain [271, 272].

Sleep disturbances, alterations of sleep architecture, and the
development of insomnia are almost ubiquitous in AUD. During
the binge/intoxication stage, alcohol intoxication leads to a faster
sleep onset, but the quality of subsequent sleep is poor relative to
nights when no alcohol is consumed, with a substantial increase in
wakefulness during the sleep period, especially later in the night.
REM sleep is reduced early in the night, with some limited
compensation later in the sleep period. Slow-wave sleep and EEG
delta frequency increase early in the night following alcohol
intoxication, but the normal beneﬁts of SWS may not occur
because of an increase in alpha activity that can be seen
concurrently with an increase in delta (i.e., so-called alpha-delta
sleep). The reduction of SOL and increase in delta activity may be
related to the acute effects of alcohol on GABAergic systems that
are associated with sleep regulation. The GABA receptor agonist
properties of alcohol may also be at least partially responsible for
the initial suppression of REM sleep.

Sleep effects in the withdrawal/negative affect stage are highly
variable. Although there is a trend toward a decrease in SWS and
some limited rebound in REM sleep when AUD individuals stop
drinking, there appears to be limited recovery in sleep dis-
turbances that are seen in AUD within the ﬁrst 30 days of
abstinence. The effects of withdrawal on sleep variables may also
be related to the loss of alcohol as a positive allosteric modulator
of GABAA receptors and the decrease in dopamine function. The
overactivation of hypocretin/orexin peptides during drug with-
drawal may also destabilize the boundaries between arousal sleep
states that are found in acute and protracted abstinence. Other
neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems, such as norepi-
nephrine, CRF, and cytokines, may also be involved.

The extended preoccupation/anticipation stage in long-term
abstinent AUD individuals is associated with persistent sleep
issues, including a longer sleep latency, more time awake during
the night, a decrease in SWS, a decrease in delta EEG power and
evoked delta activity, and an increase in REM sleep. Some of these
factors, especially the reduction of spontaneous and evoked delta
activity, may be related to the known,
largely irreversible
acceleration of brain shrinkage that is seen in AUD, especially in
the frontal and prefrontal areas of the brain where delta activity is
also predominant [75].

Clinically signiﬁcant insomnia is highly prevalent in long-term
abstinent AUD individuals and has been linked to an increase in
the propensity to relapse. The dysregulation of glutamatergic
systems that is observed in AUD is a likely substrate for some of
the observed protracted and persistent sleep dysregulations.
Several studies have shown that drugs that are used to treat AUD
may also play a role in normalizing sleep in the acute withdrawal
and extended abstinence periods. This is true for acamprosate, a

Fig. 4 Framework for how sleep dysregulation is caused by alcohol use disorder and itself causes or exacerbates alcohol use disorder. In the
binge/intoxication stage, drinking to intoxication or binge drinking is hypothesized to disrupt sleep, and the consequent sleep disruption is
hypothesized to drive further excessive alcohol drinking. In the withdrawal/negative affect stage, withdrawal disrupts sleep and may be a
trigger for excessive drinking to provide relief from insomnia. In the preoccupation/anticipation stage, residual sleep dysregulation may set up
relapse, particularly when paired with stress and/or alcohol-related cues. The treatment of sleep disturbances, particularly in the withdrawal/
negative affect stage and preoccupation/anticipation stage, is hypothesized to help promote abstinence and treat alcohol use disorder

insomnia in abstinence and
withdrawal are clearly warranted, especially in women. One
particular aspect of such studies would be to systematically
evaluate whether modulation of
systems,
including the hypocretin/orexin system, has a positive impact on
alcohol withdrawal and its associated sleep disturbances. The
orexin/hypocretin system is composed of two neuropeptides,
hypocretin-1 (orexin-A) and hypocretin-2 (orexin-B), and two
excitatory G-protein coupled receptors, hypocretin-1 (orexin-1)
and hypocretin-2 (orexin-2). Hypocretin-1 receptors appear to be
more potent as a modulator of sleep and wakefulness [274]. The
antagonism of hypocretin-1 receptors has been shown to prevent
alcohol-seeking behavior in several animal models (for review, see
[275]) and may directly address features in the withdrawal/
negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages of AUD. The
use of dual hypocretin receptor antagonists, such as the FDA-
approved drug suvorexant, could lead to improvements in
abstinence outcomes in AUD.
It is an effective treatment for
insomnia [276] and has shown some promise in impacting
addiction in preclinical models [277]. Other brain stress systems

sleep-inducing systems may buffer

From the perspective of translation to the clinical domain, much
more work is needed to answer key questions about whether
treating sleep disturbances in AUD is a key to treatment,
particularly during protracted abstinence in the preoccupation/
anticipation stage and withdrawal/negative affect stage (Fig. 4).
Sleep pathology clearly contributes to AUD pathology, and AUD
pathology contributes to sleep pathology. This type of
feed-
forward drive to a nonhomeostatic state ﬁts well within an
allostatic view of addiction, in which the hedonic set point resets
at an abnormal, near pathological level that drives further alcohol
seeking in a failed attempt to restore a normal hedonic set
point in the form of misregulaton [15]. Sleep disturbances then
become another part of allostatic load that drives the addiction
process.
