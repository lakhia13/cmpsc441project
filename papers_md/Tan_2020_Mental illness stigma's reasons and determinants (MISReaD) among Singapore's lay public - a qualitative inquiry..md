Abstract

Background: Mental illnesses pose a significant burden worldwide. Furthermore, the treatment gap for mental
disorders is large. A contributor to this treatment gap is the perceived stigma towards mental illness. Besides
impeding one’s help-seeking intentions, stigma also impairs persons with mental illness (PMI) in other aspects of
their life. Studies have found that stigma may manifest differentially under different cultural contexts. Thus, this
study seeks to elucidate the determinants of stigma towards PMI among lay public in Singapore using a qualitative
approach.
Methods: A total of 9 focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with 63 participants consisting of lay public
Singaporeans who were neither students or professionals in the mental health field, nor had they ever been
diagnosed with a mental illness. Topics discussed during the FGD were related to the stigma of mental illness. Data
collected were analyzed with inductive thematic analysis method. A codebook was derived through an iterative
process, and data was coded by 4 different coders. Both coding and inter-rater analysis were performed with NVivo
V.11.

Results: In total, 11 themes for the determinants of stigma were identified and conceptualized into a
socioecological model. The socioecological model comprised 4 levels of themes: 1) Individual level beliefs (fear
towards PMI, perceiving PMI to be burdensome, dismissing mental illness as not a real condition), 2) Interpersonal
influences (upbringing that instills stigma, intergroup bias, perceived inability to handle interactions with PMI), 3)
Local cultural values (elitist mindset among Singaporeans, Chinese culture of “face”, Islamic beliefs about spiritual
possession and reaction towards PMI), and 4) Shared societal culture (negative portrayal by media, Asian values).

Conclusions: The findings of this study improved our understanding of the various reasons why stigma exists in
Singapore. The themes identified in this study concur with that of studies conducted overseas, as some
determinants of stigma such as fear towards PMI are quite ubiquitous. Specifically, the themes elitist mindset
among Singaporeans and perceived inability to handle interactions with PMI were unique to this study. It is highly
recommended that future anti-stigma campaigns in Singapore should incorporate the findings of this study to
ensure cultural misgivings and beliefs are addressed adequately.

Background
Mental illnesses pose a significant burden worldwide. Data
suggests that more than a billion people are affected by
mental illness globally, with these individuals accounting
for 7% of all global burden of disease measured in
disability-adjusted life year (DALY), and 19% in terms of
all years lived with disability [1]. However, despite robust
evidence showing the efficacy of treatment and psycho-
logical therapies for common mental disorders such as de-
pression and anxiety [2, 3], there still exists a wide
treatment gap [4]. Studies have evinced that individuals
illnesses have increased contact
with untreated mental
with the criminal
justice system, are less likely to be
employed, and more likely to die prematurely [5–7]. At a
societal level, untreated mental illness can lead to reduced
productivity, as well as greater spending on healthcare and
other welfare expenditures [8, 9].

and

intentions

help-seeking

There are several factors that contribute to the wide
treatment gap for mental illness, with stigma being ac-
knowledged as a significant reason. Stigma affects an in-
dividual’s
behaviors,
insomuch that a person considering treatment may be
discouraged from doing so due to the anticipation of po-
tential discrimination. Such beliefs may arise from the
stigma that is attached to help-seeking, as they may fear
being labelled with a diagnosis that puts them in the
stigmatized group (label-avoidance) [10]. Besides imped-
ing an individual’s help-seeking intentions, stigma also
impairs an individual’s life in other aspects. As a result
of stigma, a PMI may be denied equal life opportunities
such as employment and housing, discriminated by the
justice system, and suboptimal treatment by the general
healthcare system [11]. Other social impacts of stigma
include social distancing and unwillingness to engage in
close relationships with PMI. Perhaps more troubling is
society’s
the internalization of
stigmatizing notions,
which undermines the self-esteem and sense of self-
worth of PMI, which may in turn, worsen their mental
health [12]. In fact, many individuals with mental illness
have proclaimed that the experience of mental
illness
stigma may be worse than the condition itself [13].

The stigma of mental illness is one that is ubiquitous
and can be considered universal [14]. This is supported
by Thornicroft et al.’s review, which found that the ex-
perience of stigma and discrimination is common [15].
A cross-sectional survey conducted across 35 countries
of individuals with a diagnosis of major depressive dis-
order also generated similar findings, where 79% of re-
spondents reported experiencing discrimination, such as
being treated unfairly by people in their neighbourhood or
challenges in finding a job by virtue of being a PMI [16].
Although stigma may constitute a universal phenomenon,
stigma may manifest itself in different ways under differ-
ent cultural contexts and settings [14]. A case in point

would be the study by Shamblaw et al. (2015), which
found that Asians were associated with greater stigma to-
wards mental illness than Europeans, and the belief that
depression carries familial shame was cited as a mediator
between ethnicity and stigma [17].

Singapore is a multi-ethnic nation in Southeast Asia
whose citizens are comprised of mostly Chinese (74.4%),
followed by Malays (9.0%) who are predominantly Is-
lamic followers [18], Indians (9.0%) and others (3.2%)
[19]. An epidemiological study in Singapore found con-
siderable stigma towards people with mental illness [20].
Although majority of participants in this study expressed
willingness to spend an evening or be friends with a PMI,
a substantial percentage of them expressed unwillingness
to move next door to a PMI (32.4%) and to work closely
with a PMI (42.8%). Additionally, most expressed that they
would not be willing to have a PMI marry into their family
(70.2%). Also warranting concern was that majority of par-
ticipants felt that PMI could get better if they wanted to
(89.4), that PMI were unpredictable (62.5%), and that the
illness was a sign of personal weakness (50.8%).

In Chinese societies, stigma towards mental illness is
intertwined with their cultural norm of “face”, a con-
struct that is central to one’s social identity, representing
one’s power and standing in the social hierarchy among
Chinese. Thus, an onset of mental illness usually brings
about a “loss of face” for both the individual and the as-
sociated family members, because of the pejorative views
on the etiological beliefs of the illness, such as a moral
“defect” among the sufferer’s family [21]. Some other
etiological beliefs of mental illness among Chinese soci-
eties that might lead to stigma includes; the belief that
mental illness is caused by the bite of a rabid dog (which
possibly instills fear of transmission) [22]; a misconduct
by one’s ancestors resulting in punishment in the form
of mental illness [23]; and the beliefs about mental ill-
ness being hereditary in nature which implicates the
family as being pathogenic [24].

The etiological beliefs of mental illness among Indian
culture are seemingly different from that of Chinese so-
cieties, and likely to influence stigma differentially as
well. A study in South India found that among several
non-biomedical etiological beliefs of mental illness such
as karma, black magic, punishment by God and evil
spirits, stigma was associated only with the belief that
illnesses are caused by karma and evil spirits
mental
[25]. Another study in North India revealed that major-
ity of patients had undergone ‘magico-religious’ treat-
ment for their illness, which was likely attributable to
the belief that their symptoms were caused by supernat-
ural influences [26]. A more recent study in Delhi re-
vealed that although participants did endorse biomedical
explanations for causes of mental illness, there were still
considerable endorsements of non-biomedical causes

Tan et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:422

such as “God punishing for past sins”, “witchcraft” and
“loss of semen/vaginal secretion” [27].

Likewise, followers of Islam are susceptible to the mis-
perceptions that mental illness arises from ‘supernatural
activities’, as revealed by a study in Malaysia [28]. This
finding is consistent with an earlier study that elucidated
that Malay Muslims are likely to attribute the cause of
psychiatric illness to fate and religion [29]. The attribu-
tion of mental illness to supernatural causes is prevalent
in Indonesia as well, and PMI often have to cope with
being accused of not being religious enough to fight off
there were
evil spirits and thoughts [30]. However,
mixed findings with regard to the reaction towards men-
tal illness arising from such etiological beliefs. Though
such beliefs can elicit disdainful reactions towards PMI,
Muslims tend to appraise themselves as being “respon-
sible for people with mental health issues”, and failing to
do so is essentially viewed as “defying God’s will”, since
mental illness is regarded as a trial by God to test their
faith [28, 30]. These findings illustrate the importance of
studying stigma in various cultural contexts in order to
gain a better understanding of the cultural influences of
stigma.

According to Kutcher et al., “Mental health literacy in-
terventions need to be contextually developed and devel-
opmentally appropriate”, and such interventions have to
be framed in appropriate domains and delivered in the
context relevant to the target audience [31]. Although
there has been earlier work published pertaining to
stigma in Singapore, none of those were qualitative in
nature [32, 33]. Therefore, this study seeks to elucidate
the determinants of the stigma towards mental illness in
Singapore and to investigate the cultural influences of
stigma if any, from the perspective of the general public,
by utilizing a qualitative approach.

Methods
This qualitative study was part of a bigger study that
aimed to examine the nature of mental illness stigma in
Singapore from the perspectives of
five stakeholder
groups, namely the general public, PMI, caregivers of
PMI, professionals in mental health setting, and policy
makers. The study was approved by the National Health-
care Group Domain Specific Review Board. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all participants
before initiating study related procedures. Each Focus
Group Discussion (FGD) lasted between 1.5-2 h, was
audiotaped and transcribed verbatim by a member of
the study team.

Sample
Members of the public were recruited through conveni-
ence and snowball sampling. The study was advertised
to the public by word of mouth and brochures.

Brochures were given to participants and to the friends
of study team’s member to help advertise the study to
potential participants. Interested participants would then
pass their contact details to the study team. The study
team would then coordinate with the participants and
arrange for a FGD. Inclusion criteria comprised 1) being
21 years and older; 2) able to converse in English as all
the FGDs were conducted in English; 3) not a student or
professional from the mental health field; and 4) not
been diagnosed with a mental illness (as there was a sep-
arate study for PMI).

Data collection
A topic guide comprising open-ended questions (refer to
Table 1) was developed by the research team to make
sure that data collected across the various FGDs would
be as uniform as possible. Each FGD was conducted by
two team members, a facilitator and a note-taker. Writ-
ten informed consent was taken and the participants’
socio-demographic information was also collected. Prior
to the start of the discussion, participants were assured
that data collected would be kept confidential and anon-
ymized, and that there were no right or wrong answers/
opinions.

The first few questions in the guide (refer to Table 1)
were meant to elicit responses from participants on their
thoughts about mental
illness, and to inquire more
about their perspectives on the reasons for stigma. Next,
participants were handed a vignette describing a male
with symptoms of either depression or schizophrenia,
depending on whether the FGDs were assigned either
the depression or schizophrenia vignette (refer to sup-
plementary file 1). Once participants had read the vi-
gnette, a series of questions were asked pertaining to the
vignette to evaluate participants’ recognition of mental

Table 1 FGD Topic List

Thoughts about Mental Illness and Stigma
-Can you describe a PMI? What comes to mind?

-Can you tell me more about such (repeat terms participants used to
reflect stigmatizing attitude to first question if any) that you or other
people have towards mental illness?

Follow-up questions on vignette (30mins)

-What, according to you, would people think about this person?

-Can you describe some of the positive or negative perceptions they
might have?

-Do you think people will be willing to work with the person described
in the vignette?

-Do you think people will be willing to include this person in their social
or friend circle?

Role of culture in stigma

-Some people believe that the culture of the society plays a role in
stigma. Would you agree with that? Can you tell us why you think that
way?

illness, and their opinions of a person exhibiting symp-
toms of mental illness. These were followed by questions
which probed the participants on whether they would be
willing to work with and/or be socially inclusive towards
person described in vignette.

Lastly, participants were asked to opine on whether
culture plays any role towards the stigmatization of indi-
viduals with mental illness (refer to Table 1). Data col-
lection ended after 9 FGDs as no new information
surfaced, indicating that data saturation was reached.

Besides facilitating the discussion, the facilitator also
clarified any comments that were inconsistent, vague or
ambiguous, and provided a summary of the FGD con-
tent at the end of each section, while the note-taker took
careful notes of the entire discussion and seating ar-
rangement. The other responsibility of the note-taker
was to note down if any specific group members (based
on age, ethnicity, gender etc) held notably different views
or had been reluctant to express their views. Each ses-
sion was facilitated by either Mythily Subramniam (MS)
or Shazana Shahwan (SS), both of whom are trained and
experienced in qualitative research methodologies, while
the notetaking was assigned to either of the other 3
members of the study team, namely Chong Min Janrius
Goh (CMJG), Gregory Tee Hng Tan (GTHT) and Wei
Jie Ong (WJO). Immediately at the end of each FGD,
there was a debrief between the facilitator and note-
taker and later with the rest of the research team to en-
sure that problems were identified early and emerging
themes were discussed in terms of overlap with other
sessions or their unique associations with a particular
ethnic group.

Analysis
Transcripts of FGDs were checked through by facilita-
tors to ensure accuracy, and data were analyzed with the
inductive thematic analysis method [34], where content
was coded to identify emerging themes. Each of the
study team members independently conducted a prelim-
inary analysis of a subset of FGD transcript, and the
open coding method was used to identify and generate
key themes [35]. Keeping the original questions in mind,
study team members familiarized themselves with the
data, and quotes of relevance in the transcript were
highlighted, alongside recording of preliminary thoughts
about the highlighted quotes. The study team then dis-
cussed and reviewed the highlighted quotes and sorted
the quotes with similar content into piles of quotes that
were representative of an abstract concept. The themes
were then generated via an iterative process of grouping
concepts into themes based on their common properties,
examining quotes within each theme for congruency
with the theme, and refining of the themes to ensure

minimal overlap between themes that were meant to be
discrete.

Consensus for any disagreements were reached through
discussions and iterative review of the codes and themes,
and a codebook was developed. All the study team mem-
bers (except MS) coded the same two transcripts using
the codebook developed to establish inter-rater scores.
Upon achieving a satisfactory Kappa score, the other tran-
scripts were then disseminated to GTHT, CMJG, WJO
and SS for independent coding. The established Kappa
among the 4 team members ranged from 0.78–0.93, which
can be interpreted as substantial according to Cohen’s
suggestion, where 0.61–0.80 represents substantial, and
0.81–1.00 symbolizes almost perfect agreement [36]. All
analysis and inter-rater reliability tests were performed
using Nvivo V.10. (QSR International. NVivo V.10 Com-
puter software).

Results
A total of 62 participants between the ages of 21 to 60
(mean = 33.5 ± 12.1) were recruited over 9 FGDs with
nearly half of all participants being males (n = 30). Refer
to Table 2 for participants’ sociodemographic informa-
tion. In all, 11 broad themes emerged regarding reasons

In addition to the fear of violence, participants also
talked about a fear of the unknown – feeling of fear that
is triggered by a perceived lack of information at any
level of consciousness [38], which plausibly stems from a
lack of understanding towards PMI and the perception
that they are unpredictable.

"I mean for me; I think every human we are fearful
of the unknown. So like when we don’t know stuff,
we tend to be more wary while approaching that
fear thing." [Age: 21]

Lastly, hygiene-related reasons were also cited as to
why a person would avoid being in close-proximity
with a PMI

"Normally people tend to stay away from them es-
pecially they don’t groom themselves; they start to
smell bad and all." [Age: 43]

Perception that PMI are burdensome
Participants had a perception that PMI are incompe-
tent at work and burdensome to society and this con-
tributed to the stigma in two ways. Firstly, there was
a greater unwillingness to work with a PMI (versus
someone without a mental illness) as they were con-
sidered incapable of carrying their own weight when
it came to work.

for stigma towards PMI. Drawing on Baral et al.’s modi-
fied socioecological model [37], we classified the themes
into 4 broad overarching themes (levels) and proposed
our own socioecological explanatory model for stigma
(SEMS) amongst the general public in Singapore (refer to
Fig. 1). The four levels of the model, in ascending wide-
ness of socioecological network are Individual Level Be-
liefs (person’s internalized beliefs about PMI which drives
stigma),
(stigmatizing beliefs
Influences
about PMI which are possibly influenced by social interac-
tions), Local Cultural Values (stigma towards PMI which
are fostered by local culture) and Shared Societal Culture
(encompasses culture beyond the local
fosters
stigma). To ensure that standard usage of English is main-
tained, minimally corrected verbatim of quotes are pre-
sented. A table was
also included to show the
endorsement of each themes by FGD units (see Table 3).

Individual level beliefs
Fear towards PMI
Participants’ responses indicated some level of fear to-
wards PMI and as a result they expressed aversion to-
wards them. The perception that PMI are dangerous
came across as the most significant explanation for lay
public’s fear and aversion towards PMI

"Sometimes, fear can also come in the fact of maybe
it can be dangerous being beside this person."–
[Age: 45]

"if it is my colleague and we are part of a project
then, then I will feel that…assuming that our bonus
is at stake etc, then I might feel that he might be
a…he might drag the team down and that is my
honest opinion." [Age: 23]

lot of people just say I am depressed very easily, so
this kind of thing I am afraid it becomes a habit…
erm you…actually there’s nothing wrong with you
but you are treating something that is not there"
[Age: 24].

Secondly, PMI were also seen as burdensome to soci-
ety in other ways such as requiring greater resources
(participants did not explicitly mention whether this re-
fers to resources from family or from society in general)
such as money, time spent or effort being dedicated to
them despite them not making any meaningful contribu-
tion to the society.

"I think most importantly is the financial cost, like
the amount of money putting into…trying to re-
habilitate them. And also, the loss in terms of what
they could actually contribute to the society. That’s
the burden." [Age: 23]

Dismissive towards mental illness being a real medical
condition
The repudiation towards mental illness being a legitim-
ate medical condition appeared several times during the
discussion where some participants subscribed to the
weak-not-sick beliefs [39] about mental illness.

"say for example depression or mental illness, the first
thing that people think about you is that you are just
not resilient. “Everybody goes through hardship, wake
up your idea and get on with life." [Age: 43]

Some also expressed the opinion that PMI were just
using mental illness as an excuse for their shortcomings
or to circumvent their way out of their responsibilities.

"the word depression gets thrown around very
loosely nowadays you know, I can say I am just…a

Interpersonal influences
Upbringing that instils stigma
Prior research on prejudice has found that ethnic preju-
dice can be fostered due to upbringing [40, 41]. Consist-
ent with those studies, we found that stigmatizing views
towards mental illness can also be passed down in one’s
family due to upbringing by the older generation which
instilled certain negative preconceived sentiments about
PMI such as the notion that PMI are dangerous.

"it really depends on what is your family upbringing of
you towards mental health. Yah, probably your parents
might say ‘this person is siao (a pejorative term in
Hokkien which means crazy) one, don’t go near, later
you will get killed or you get stabbed". [Age: 25]

Participants cited a lack of mental health literacy
(MHL) on the part of the older generations as the reason
for why this occurred.

"maybe our past generation or whatever, they don’t
have any understanding of mental illness and then
they pass it to their children or all of these. Actually,
I went through a supermarket, I think it was last
weekend. An old lady was like "oh don’t get so
close", was telling the children not to get too close
to the person because the person is siao" [Age: 25]

Intergroup bias
Intergroup bias also surfaced as one of the reasons for
stigma in the study, with PMI recognized as the out-
group. Participants mentioned that stigma towards PMI

Tan et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:422 

Page 7 of 13

may arise because of the general out-group discrimin-
ation towards people who are different.

good about yourself. That’s why people tend to
avoid it” [Age: 23]

"Then a simpler way to look at them being stigma-
tized is because people with mental issues they’re
different. So I feel that we… because you know
when you see someone else acting differently like
not a normal person, people will just go “this one
not normal, this one crazy." [Age: 23]

Local cultural values
Elitist mindset among Singaporeans
Several of the participants remarked that in Singapore,
there is an expectation that one has to be successful/pro-
ductive, and alluded that PMI tend to be ostracized or
looked upon with contempt because of their failure to
conform to these high standards.

Further, participants also mentioned concerns about

associative stigma which leads to an avoidance of PMI.

"I
think because he is mentally crazy so being
friends with someone like this sort of put in like a…
I don’t know how to put it, but in a more negative
light in front of other people." [Age: 23]

Perceived inability to handle interactions with PMI
This theme describes participant’s perspectives on why
they felt that they would rather not be in close contact
with a PMI and consists of 3 sub-themes, and such be-
liefs possibly leads to greater social exclusion of PMI in
the society. The three sub-themes included a perceived
lack of expertise to deal with PMI (characterized by a
feeling of a lack of adequate knowledge or understanding
on how to interact with a PMI),

"I think because dealing with them right, sometimes
we are not trained and we don’t know how to deal
with them. So like maybe we try to help someone
with mental illness and it didn’t work out, then we
just give up because we try and it make them feel
worse you know." [Age: 22]

perceived lack of resources to deal with PMI (character-
ized by one’s supposition that having contact with PMI
will result in a lot of hassle and burden on themselves),

"we just try to live life with less problem so if I put
myself in there, I am going to make that person’s
problems my problems. So like I might have to talk
to…take care of them that kind of thing. Example
will be I might come in for questioning, so I already
have other things that I needed to do and not have
any more extra problems added on." [Age: 27]

and the perceived inability to ward off PMI’s negativity
i.e., that their low moods or negativity would affect the
participants well-being.

“you wouldn’t want to be with someone who has
negative vibes around. Yea, then you also being
pulled into that negative vibe and you don’t feel

“A person with mental illness requires care, he is
not independent and therefore he is deemed as a
loser and you don’t…the society doesn’t allow
you to be associated with because it means you
are a loser too. So I think it is because of this
culture of “No, you have to be successful,” “you
have to be independent to be…for people to want
to believe you.” That’s probably one of the main
reasons why people tend to shun away from
people with mental illness because they have per-
ceived the people who are losers that can’t take
care of themselves.” [Age: 43]

Chinese culture and “face”
Several of the Chinese participants who shared their in-
put on how culture affects stigma stated that mental ill-
ness would lead to shame and loss of respect for one’s
family, which are related to the Chinese cultural con-
struct known as “face”, a construct that is deeply inter-
twined with social standing [21].

“For Chinese I think it is more of the face, like how
much less respect you get if someone in your family
is known to have mental illness.” [Age: 26]

In this case, the stigma towards mental illness may
manifest in the form of denial or the refusal to ac-
knowledge one’s condition, due to the perceived re-
percussion of so doing, such as the loss of social
standing should others find out that there is a PMI
within the family.

“for the Chinese side and the Singaporean culture
on the whole, I think as a Chinese in Chinese
culture, we very hush-hush you know, we don’t
to lose face in the sense…I mean when,
want
when you say you have something wrong or
when you, when you show your shortcomings, it
look down on you, so if I

Islamic beliefs about spiritual possession and reactions
towards MI
Although the attribution of mental
illness to spiritual
possession is not unique to Islam alone, our findings
suggest that this belief was more prevalent among the
Muslims in Singapore

“To me in our society, we are Malay, maybe Malay
Muslim, like what I know from my aunties and un-
cles, they always think these kind of people are pos-
sessed.” [Age: 32]

At the same time, some participants remarked that the
Islamic culture is more accepting towards mental illness
and PMI, although the motivations behind such pro-
social behavior was not elaborated.

“Another thing is that if you see the Malay commu-
nity is more together and they also accept every if
there is a mental, they know…the whole family
knows about this but they still accept it in a way.”
[Age: 54]

Shared societal culture
Negative portrayal of PMI by media
Congruent to the existing literature that evinced the re-
lationship between negative media portrayal of mental
illness and stigma [42, 43], our findings revealed that
participants were exposed to stigmatizing portrayals of
mental
illness, where mental illness is associated with
violence, which led to them endorsing beliefs that PMI
are dangerous.

“The 9PM shows, and then usually the bad per-
son in the movie, maybe something happened to
him or her and then suddenly become depressed,
and it always ends up either killing or injuring
someone. So, when I grew up, my impression is
like when someone is depressed, confirm will
turn violent.” [Age: 21]

Asian conservatism and collectivism
Several participants intimated that the stigma towards
mental illness is harsher in Singapore compared to the
Western world, stating that Asians are more conserva-
tive while Westerners are more liberal. For instance, one
participant made a comparison of Asian culture with the
United States where people are more open about mental
illness

“Like for example in US right, the culture of ther-
apy, seeing a therapist is actually very common and
therapists are celebrated. You know, even normal
people go to therapy.” [Age: 33]

Another participant spoke about how Asians are very
“closed off” whereas those from Western countries are
more outspoken.

“It’s definitely the Asian culture because we, how-
ever we are in Singapore, maybe we don’t have to
look far, it’s just the Asians that we are, we are very
closed off. Maybe if we compare ourselves to like
the Westerns, they are very outspoken like they talk
about these kind of things.” [Age: 26]

One participant also commented about how the Asian
collectivist culture can contribute to in-out group
stigma.

“I think that the Asian culture does play a strong
role in stigma? It also has a very bad footing when it
comes to someone who is outside that regular
group.” [Age: 31]

Non-stigmatizing views of PMI
We have also included some comments made by partici-
pants, although not many, that are non-stigmatizing to
provide a contrast. Participants commented that PMI
can be just like any other normal people, and be as pro-
ductive as well.

“They are highly functional, very bright individuals.
The only difference in fact is like if they don’t come
out or tell you or if you are not trained in the pro-
fession, you wouldn’t have known that they do suf-
fer from certain level, certain degree of mental
illness” [Age: 43]

One participant even remarked that PMI can be the
ones to be spreading positivity, a contrast from our third
theme that PMI are contagiously negative.

“The positive thing about it is that people with
mental illnesses, they want people around them to
be happier than what they are. So they do more to
make the people around them happy so they sort of
feel happier themselves as well.” [Age: 22]

Discussion
Our findings unearthed the various determinants of
stigma among the lay public in Singapore. In all, 11
themes were observed. Drawing from Baral et al.’s work
[37], these themes were categorized into different levels
to better conceptualize a model that elucidates the de-
terminants of stigma among the general public in
Singapore (see Fig. 1). The lowest level in the model rep-
resents the internalized beliefs that an individual has
which incites stigmatizing attitudes towards PMI. The

Tan et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:422 

Page 9 of 13

themes comprising the next higher level in the model
are determinants of stigma which are motivated by the
individual’s interactions with others,
followed by the
local cultural level stigma determinants, and the highest
level encapsulates cultural determinants of stigma that
are more global in their representation.

The boundaries between the various levels in our
model are porous such that determinants of stigma can
have bi-directional influences. For instance, stigma may
be inculcated when an individual who had an “Upbring-
ing that instills stigma” (Interpersonal influences) inter-
nalizes those beliefs and end up fearing PMI (Individual
level beliefs). As one participant puts it, it is due to the
upbringing which instills stigma that people are taught
to perceive PMI as dangerous (see quote in results sec-
tion: 1. Upbringing that instils stigma). At the same time,
local cultural values - one
upbringing can also instill
Influences -such as “face”
level above Interpersonal
which may propagate stigmatizing outlook towards men-
tal illness. Of course, it is also possible for stigma deter-
minants to directly influence levels further than one
level apart. A case in point, “elitist mindset among Sin-
gaporeans” and the perception that PMI are “burden-
some to society” may be interlinked, insomuch that one
might be more disposed to view PMI as burdensome if
they possess an elitist mindset.

There are several generic causes of mental

illness
stigma in our study which are similar to those reported
in studies conducted in other countries. For instance,
the relationship between fear and social distance towards
PMI has been documented by many studies [44]. Link
et al.’s study conducted in Ohio found social distance to
be correlated with participant’s perceived dangerousness
of the mentally ill patient [45], and a review of stigma
towards mental illness in Asia revealed similar findings
to Link et al.’s study [46]. The notion that PMI are in-
competent at work and burdensome is pervasive among
the general public in Europe, as evinced by a review
[47], and this surfaced in our findings as well. Other de-
terminants of stigma that our study has identified such
as upbringing [40, 41],
intergroup bias and concerns
about associative stigma [48, 49], and the perception that
PMI are “weak-not-sick” [39] were also similar to earlier
findings from overseas studies. Hence, this suggests that
there are some causes of mental illness stigma which are
quite pervasive globally.

In contrast, the sub-theme perceived inability to han-
dle interactions with PMI is more unique to our study.
We postulate that an individual’s perceived inability to
handle interactions with PMI may be attributed to a lack
of knowledge and/or awareness about mental illness in
general (perceived lack of expertise) or previous unpleas-
ant experiences of interacting with PMI which evoked
inadequate self-efficacy in socializing with
feelings of

(perceived inability ward off PMI’s negativity).
PMI
Lastly, participants’ perceived lack of resources to deal
with PMI may be attributable to Singapore being a rela-
tively fast-paced society. This hypothesis is inspired by
Levine and Norenzayan’s work (1999) on the pace of life
in 31 countries, which suggested that people in cities
with a faster pace of life were less likely to engage in
prosocial behavior, as they have less time to devote to
factors peripheral to their main goals [50].

Our study also identified a few themes which shed
light on how culture possibly influences stigma. One as-
pect of culture that influenced stigma in Singapore is the
Chinese construct of ‘face’ and its societal importance.
There is a widespread belief denoted by the Chinese cul-
ture that mental illness is a result of some form of moral
“defect” on the sufferer’s part or within their family. This
possibly explains why earlier local studies found Chinese
to have less social tolerance and more negative attitudes
towards PMI as compared to other ethnicities [32, 33]. In
any case, the implications of such cultural beliefs probably
resulted in mental illness being equated to a “loss of face”
for the PMI and the family. Hence, the stigma towards
mental illness among Singaporeans- especially if a family
member is a PMI - may manifest because of the need to
preserve this “face” which is deeply intertwined with one’s
social standing [21]. This postulation is reinforced by the
findings from the previous local nationwide study, which
revealed that Chinese Singaporeans as compared to Singa-
poreans of other ethnicities, reported the highest social
distance scores towards PMI [20].

The attribution of mental illness to spiritual possession,
while not unique to Singapore is an important belief that
can influence stigma. Studies have found that superstitious
beliefs in mental illness being a result of spiritual posses-
sion can evoke feelings of apprehension towards PMI [51].
Further, this misconception may also lead to help-seeking
from inappropriate sources, delaying the PMI from receiv-
ing formal psychiatric treatment [52]. The attribution of
mental illness to spiritual possession is the most apparent
among the Muslims participants. Despite the drawback of
such a belief, participants acknowledged that Muslims are
the most tolerant and accepting towards PMI, though they
did not explicitly elaborate on the reason behind it. A
plausible explanation for this prosocial behavior towards
PMI may be due to the Islamic belief that alienating the
mentally ill equates to defying God’s will [28]. Moreover,
the Qur’an and the Hadith (Islamic religious books) not
only promulgate disabilities as something natural, but also
impart principles and guidance for caring for disabled
people [53]. Alternatively, it could be that mental illness is
sometimes regarded as a trial or test bestowed upon the
individual by Allah to allow the atonement for one’s sins,
and this belief may in turn promote positive acceptance
towards PMI [30].

Our finding on stigma being harsher in Asian as com-
pared Western societies is corroborated by Shamblaw
et al. (2015) study, whereby it was reported that Asians
were associated with greater stigma towards mental ill-
ness than Europeans, with conservative values being
highlighted as one of the underlying factor for such a re-
lationship [17]. Anecdotally, because of conservatism,
Asians tend to avoid discussing subjects which make
them uncomfortable, and mental illness happens to be
one of such topics. This avoidance towards acknowledg-
ing and talking about mental
illness is perhaps com-
pounded by the fact that Asians associate mental illness
with stigma, shame and loss of ‘face’ [54]. As such, men-
tal
illness becomes a highly shunned topic among
Asians, resulting in a vicious cycle eventuating mental
illness into a taboo among the Asian communities.

The reluctance to talk about mental

illness among
Asians could be due also to the greater emphasis on
moral attributions of mental illness. Krendly and Pesco-
solido's (2020) work on global differences in stigma re-
ported higher stigma and greater emphasis on moral
attributions in Eastern countries as compared to West-
ern countries [55]. This resonates with the findings from
our study, where some participants remarked that it’s
harder to talk about mental illness in Singapore as com-
pared to Western countries because individuals are
blamed for their symptoms. As one participant puts it,
“We always kind of blame it on like “oh he’s not doing
so well in school, so he’s kind of feeling down again.” So
we don’t really talk about depression, so I think in that
way, if anyone suffers from depression, we don’t realize
that they are suffering from depression. We just that
think oh life is hard, yea so culture definitely plays a
part, except I think it’s very different from Western cul-
ture, it’s a lot easier to talk about this kind of things.”

is highly

A rather local determinant of stigma is perhaps the
“elitism mindset among Singaporeans” which may be re-
lated to meritocracy. In an earlier study pertaining to the
treatment gap in Singapore, Subramaniam et al. (2019)
discussed how meritocracy
regarded in
Singapore and that people with higher education face
greater inertia towards seeking treatment in order to
conform to societal expectations [56]. In Yang et al. [57]
study which was guided by a framework of “what mat-
ters most”, it was highlighted that mental illness stigma
was contingent on the degree to which participants were
able to achieve “what matters most” in their cultural
context. As there is a strong emphasis on meritocracy in
Singapore, stigma towards mental illness may arise due
to the fact that many PMI have histories of disrupted
academic or vocational careers, both of which happen to
be highly valued in a meritocratic society. Furthermore,
meritocracy facilitates negative evaluations and stereo-
typing towards ‘low status’ groups, as highlighted by a

systematic review [58]. A plausible explanation for this is
that because meritocratic worldviews are typically associ-
ated with the beliefs of a just world (i.e., I get what I de-
serve), it leads to a perception that PMI are responsible
for their own illness and their inability to achieve in life
[59].

The negative portrayal of PMI, such as attributing vio-
lence to mental illness in media reports [42] occurs in
Singapore as well (see results), although in reality, PMI
are more likely to become a victim of violent crime than
be the perpetrator [60]. Nonetheless, media can be a
useful tool to reduce stigma if used strategically [61]. In
Singapore’s context, media could be used to help shift
the stereotypes that the older generation have towards
PMI. By portraying more characters with mental illness
leading a meaningful life, instead of depicting PMI as
(see quote in results),
violent/dangerous characters
media could potentially reduce the stigmatizing attitudes
of the older generation, thus decreasing the likelihood of
them inculcating stigmatizing views upon the younger
generation.

Additionally, media could be a useful tool to destigma-
tize mental illness in Singapore, given that 78% of youths
in Singapore use social media daily to access news and
information, as reported by the National Youth Survey
2016 [62]. According to our findings, the taboo-ness as-
sociated with mental illness in Singapore is attributed to
Asian conservative values. Hence, the utilization of social
information
media platforms
about mental illness can potentially alleviate this taboo-
ness, for it exposes youths to mental illnesses and poten-
tially fosters more conversations about mental illnesses
as well.

to disseminate factual

Another strategy to reduce stigma in Singapore would
be to educate individuals about mental health issues
from young, thus enabling them to understand these
conditions without being clouded by prejudice. This may
also potentially disabuse youths of the stigmatizing views
which may have been imparted by the older generation.
A possible approach would be to introduce MHL mod-
ules in the school curriculum, an approach that has been
considered superior to other school-based interventions
[63]. Importantly, these MHL modules should also en-
lighten students that mental illness is not due to a per-
sonal defect or spiritual possession, but is instead a
legitimate medical condition. Consequently, this may al-
leviate the concern that being associated with someone
with mental illness or having a mental illness would re-
sult in a loss of “face” as mental illness will not be attrib-
uted to a moral defect on the sufferer’s part.

Our findings suggest that Singaporeans are likely to
distance themselves from PMI due to several concerns,
such as their perceived inability to handle the PMI or
the perception that PMI are dangerous, and their

Tan et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:422 

Page 11 of 13

unwillingness to work with PMI is due to the perception
that PMI are burdensome. Anti-stigma campaigns in
Singapore should, therefore, consider incorporating so-
cial contact with PMI as a component. Creating oppor-
tunities for social contact with PMI may help allay some
of the aforementioned misconceptions, as well as reduce
some of the intergroup bias that lay public hold towards
PMI. The effectiveness of diminishing prejudice through
contact has been supported by a meta-analysis of over
500 studies, which found that social contact can enhance
knowledge regarding outgroup bias,
increase empathy
and perspective-taking [64]. A recent local study evalu-
ated an intervention for college students comprising
education and personal contact with a PMI (with a diag-
nosis of depression). The intervention was found to be
efficacious in improving depression knowledge, reducing
social distance and the stigma that persons with depres-
sion are dangerous/undesirable and weak-not-sick [65].
Such findings indicate that incorporating social contact
in campaigns could be beneficial in assuaging the con-
cerns of the lay public and thus reduce the unwillingness
for social contact with PMI.

Lastly, campaigns in Singapore should also advocate
that with proper treatment, PMI can hold down a job
and lead successful/meaningful lives. This is especially
important given the finding from our study which sug-
gests that Singaporeans tend to be condescending to-
wards those who seemingly lack the potential to become
successful. Thus success stories are important to change
this mindset. However, while campaigns can create cog-
nitive shifts, the effects may be ephemeral [64]. Ultim-
ately, to better reduce stigma, there may be a need to
also implement legislative changes that promote inclu-
sivity of PMI in workplaces and schools.

Limitations
There are some limitations in our study that need to be
acknowledged. As this study pertains to the topic of
mental health stigma, the responses by participants may
be affected by social desirability bias especially given the
FGD setting. This was mitigated by the neutral manner
of tone and words which the facilitator adopted in con-
ducting the discussion, and the assurance at the start of
the FGD that there are no right or wrong answers to any
questions. Also, given the convenient sampling, there
may be selection bias: participants who enrolled were in-
dividuals on two polarizing ends, namely those who have
strong views against stigma towards mental illness and
those with strong stigmatizing views towards people
with mental illness. As such, our study’s results may not
be generalizable to all the lay public in Singapore. None-
theless, most of the reasons for stigma uncovered in this
study largely concurred with those in existing literature,
suggesting that selection bias was minimal.

Conclusion
This study elucidated several determinants of stigma
among the general public in Singapore using a qualita-
tive approach. A total of 11 themes emerged, and these
were classified into a socioecological model to illustrate
how stigma is influenced by culture and environment.
Findings from this study suggest that certain factors
which cause stigma are quite pervasive across different
cultures, such as the fear towards PMI, and the percep-
tion that PMI are burdensome. The determinants of
stigma identified which were more culturally-specific
were related to the Chinese concept of “face”, beliefs in
spiritual possession, and Asian conservative values. The
determinants of stigma that surfaced in our study which
were unique were the elitist mindset among Singapor-
eans and the perceived inability to handle interactions
with PMI. Lastly, findings of this study, must be incor-
porated into future anti-stigma campaigns in Singapore
to ensure cultural misgivings and beliefs are addressed
adequately.
