Abstract
Rationale and objectives  Differences among psychedelic substances regarding their subjective experiences are clinically 
and scientifically interesting. Quantitative linguistic analysis is a powerful tool to examine such differences. This study 
compared five psychedelic substance report groups and a non-psychedelic report group on quantitative linguistic markers of 
psychological states and processes derived from recreational use-based online experience reports.
Methods  Using 2947 publicly available online reports, we compared Ayahuasca and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT, ana-
lyzed together), ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin 
(mushroom), and antidepressant drug use experiences. We examined word frequencies related to various psychological states 
and processes and semantic proximity to psychedelic and mystical experience scales.
Results  Linguistic markers of psychological function indicated distinct effect profiles. For example, MDMA experience 
reports featured an emotionally intensifying profile accompanied by many cognitive process words and dynamic-personal 
language. In contrast, Ayahuasca and DMT experience reports involved relatively little emotional language, few cognitive 
process words, increased analytical thinking-associated language, and the most semantic similarity with psychedelic and 
mystical experience descriptions. LSD, psilocybin mushroom, and ketamine reports showed only small differences on the 
emotion-, analytical thinking-, psychedelic, and mystical experience-related language outcomes. Antidepressant reports 
featured more negative emotional and cognitive process-related words, fewer positive emotional and analytical thinking-
related words, and were generally not similar to mystical and psychedelic language.
Conclusion  This article addresses an existing research gap regarding the comparison of different psychedelic drugs on lin-
guistic profiles of psychological states, processes, and experiences. The large sample of experience reports involving mul-
tiple psychedelic drugs provides valuable information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. The results could inform 
experimental research into psychedelic drug effects in healthy populations and clinical trials for psychedelic treatments of 
psychiatric problems.

Psychedelic  drugs  are  commonly  associated  with  rec-
reational, illicit substance use. Consequently, much of the 
scientific and medical literature has examined psychedelic 
drugs in the context of substance abuse and its negative 
consequences. Nonetheless, a small, but growing body of 
research has recognized the therapeutic potential of psyche-
delic drugs like Ayahuasca, ketamine, lysergic acid dieth-
ylamide  (LSD),  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
(MDMA),  or  psilocybin  for  psychiatric  conditions  such 
as depression and PTSD, especially in patients for whom 
standard treatments do not work (aan het Rot et al. 2010; 
Carhart-Harris et al. 2016a; Fuentes et al. 2020; Majumder 
et al. 2012; Nutt & Carhart-Harris 2020; Palhano-Fontes

et al. 2019). As there is no unifying theory of psychedelic 
drug effects (Swanson 2018), some drugs (e.g., MDMA, 
ketamine) are not always considered psychedelic. For the 
purposes of this article, we will treat MDMA and ketamine 
as psychedelic drugs, consistent with the characterization of 
psychedelic drugs as having a “…capacity reliably to induce 
states of altered perception, thought, and feeling that are 
not experienced otherwise except in dreams or at times of 
religious exaltation” (Jaffe 1990; Nichols 2016) and being 
likened to classical psychedelics regarding their fast-acting 
neuroplastic effects (Olson 2018).

In  past  studies,  psychedelic  drugs  have  often  shown 
promise; for example, a small meta-analysis found that a sin-
gle intravenous ketamine infusion quickly reduced suicidal 
ideation in inpatient or emergency care patients with acute 
suicidality (Bartoli et al. 2017). Similarly, a single dose 
of psilocybin produced significant and lasting antidepres-
sant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression 
(Carhart-Harris et al. 2018a; Carhart-Harris et al. 2016a). 
Moreover, early research suggested that MDMA may be 
beneficial in assisting psychotherapy for treatment-resistant 
PTSD (for a review: Morgan 2020). Other psychological 
effects  of  psychedelic  drug  treatment  include  increased 
insights, understanding, self-love, self-worth, and self-com-
passion; altered self-perception/ego dissolution; feelings of 
connectedness; transcendental experiences; and emotional 
spectrum expansion (Breeksema et al. 2020). However, more 
robust research is needed in the future; as much of this work 
involved small, highly select samples and/or blinding issues.
Still, due to decades of restrictions and bans on psyche-
delic drug use (e.g., the 1971 UN Convention on narcotics), 
there is a relative paucity of research data on the effects of 
psychedelic drugs on psychological function in nonthera-
peutic or naturalistic contexts. Furthermore, the rather arti-
ficial laboratory or clinical treatment settings of the extant 
research might have biased effects if one were to  try to 
generalize them to a naturalistic context. Because of this, 
this study adopted an unobtrusive, naturalistic approach to 
studying the psychological effects of different psychedelic 
drugs. Precisely, we used a quantitative semantic-linguistic 
approach to analyze voluntarily and anonymously published 
user experience reports for key psychedelic drugs.

As the legal restrictions over the past half-century have 
not managed to curb recreational drug use (Degenhardt et al. 
2008; Reuter & Trautman 2009), there is a myriad of eve-
ryday recreational experiences, many of which have been 
documented in online databases aimed at researching and 
educating about various kinds of (typically illegal or strictly 
regulated) drugs. This contrasts a relatively low number of 
experimental studies on the effects of psychedelic drugs in 
naturalistic settings, although there are some relevant obser-
vational studies (e.g., Bouso et al. 2012; Forstmann et al. 
2020). The Internet can be a valuable source of information 

in this context, as it provides an easy and low-risk option 
for psychedelic substance users to share their experiences 
with others. This might result in data to complement stand-
ard measures (e.g., questionnaires or clinical interviews), 
which might in some cases be influenced by reporting bias 
(e.g., social desirability effects, reluctance to disclose sen-
sitive information) and the rather contrived testing setting 
of a clinic or laboratory. The latter factor is also relevant in 
shaping the experience itself, as the effects of psychedelic 
drugs are essentially context-dependent (Carhart-Harris 
et  al.  2018b).  Another  strength  of  analyzing  web-based 
experience reports is that one can compare multiple psyche-
delic substances at a time (e.g., ketamine, LSD, psilocybin, 
MDMA), which is rarely achieved in experimental trials. In 
sum, online reports of recreational psychedelic drug experi-
ences have the potential to provide important supplemental 
information beyond experimental trials and provide research 
and therapy considerations. It should be mentioned, though, 
that online reports may also be biased in some ways, which 
is why it is important to examine the convergence between 
results from experimental trials and research relying on 
online experience reports.

The analysis of experience reports by semantic-linguistic 
analysis could be done in different ways. One could ana-
lyze each report for the appearance of words belonging to 
predefined categories, some of which are suggestive of psy-
chological states and processes and have been validated in 
previous research (Pennebaker et al. 2015, 1997). One could 
also examine the semantic structure of the texts, that is, to 
analyze what words tend to co-occur in the reports and to 
calculate the semantic similarity between reports and a refer-
ence text based on this information (Deerwester et al. 1990). 
As these methods allow to quantify written language and 
transform it into psychologically meaningful variables, they 
are very suitable for the naturally occurring large amounts of 
data in experience report databases. They have been used in 
many contexts (Newman et al. 2008; Pennebaker et al. 2014, 
1997), including the study of psychedelic substances (Bedi 
et al. 2014; Cox et al. 2021; Coyle et al. 2012; Martial et al. 
2019; Sapoznikow et al. 2019).

Natural language processing methods have been applied 
in experimental studies of the effects of psychedelic drugs 
such as LSD (Sanz et al. 2021), psilocybin (Carrillo et al. 
2018), and MDMA (Agurto et al. 2020; Baggott et al. 2015; 
Bedi et al. 2014; Carrillo et al. 2018; Corey et al. 2016; Mar-
rone et al. 2010; Sanz et al. 2021). Combined with machine 
learning, they enabled the prediction of the psilocybin treat-
ment response in patients with treatment-resistant depres-
sion (Carrillo et al. 2018). The language of post-traumatic 
stress disorder patients (during therapy) predicted post-
treatment symptoms after treatment with MDMA versus 
placebo, where MDMA produced more treatment-relevant 
utterances  that  were  negatively  related  to  posttreatment 

1 3Psychopharmacology (2022) 239:643–659

symptom severity (Corey et al. 2016). Moreover, natural 
language processing-derived topic models predicted long-
term abstinence outcomes in individuals who reported hav-
ing quit alcohol, cannabis, opioid, or stimulant use after a 
psychedelic substance experience (Cox et al. 2021).

This study sets out to compare different classes of psy-
chedelic substances by means of semantic-linguistic analysis 
on psychological outcomes extracted from online experience 
reports aiming to inform other Internet users and contrib-
ute to harm reduction. Although previous research has used 
online experience reports to compare different psychedelic 
substances, this research did not examine psychological 
outcomes, instead associating the semantic similarity of 
the reports with the structural similarity of the respective 
molecules (Zamberlan et al. 2018). As psychedelic drugs 
impact emotional and cognitive function (Nichols 2016; 
Swanson 2018), we analyzed users’ experience reports for 
the prevalence of different word categories representative of 
various emotional states and cognitive activity (Pennebaker 
et al. 2015; Tausczik & Pennebaker 2010). We examined 
affective words including subcategories for positive emo-
tion, negative emotion, anxiety, and sadness as separate 
outcomes (Pennebaker et al. 2015). Moreover, we exam-
ined words reflective of cognitive processes and analytical 
thinking (Pennebaker et al. 2015, 1997). We also analyzed 
experience reports’ semantic similarity to established scales 
capturing psychedelic or mystical experiences (Hood 1975; 
Studerus et al. 2010). We thereby aimed to uncover differ-
ences and similarities between different psychedelic drugs 
regarding their psychological effect profiles. To provide a 
non-psychedelic reference group of experience reports, we 
also sourced and compared experience reports describing 
the effects of conventional antidepressant drugs like SSRIs, 
SNRIs, or tricyclics.

Method

Participants and procedure

The sample comprised 2947 psychoactive substance expe-
rience reports written by unique report writers. In case a 
writer had published multiple reports about the substances 
of interest, their first report was selected for the analysis, dis-
carding additional reports. The writers were 21.2% female, 
72.6% male, and 6.2% of unreported gender. Report writers’ 
mean age was 25.1 years (SD = 9.1, 70.3% missing). Age 
was missing for a majority of the sample because many of 
the reports were published before the website introduced 
an age reporting option. The mean weight was M = 71.3 kg 
(SD = 16.3 kg, 6.5% missing).

We used the Erowid experience vault (www. erowid. org) 
for sourcing the reports. This website publishes user-created 

experience reports for the purposes of education and harm 
reduction and is curated by staff members who check each 
report before publication (Erowid & Erowid 2006). In this 
process, two internal reviewers and one editor read each 
report and ensure it conforms to the website’s quality stand-
ards and guidelines. In this way, incriminating information, 
incomprehensible content, and advertising or other undesir-
able content are removed or corrected before publication to 
the website. Before linguistically analyzing the reports in an 
automated way, two authors (AH and ME) double-checked 
and corrected the raw text material for typographic errors 
unrelated to slang or sociolect and meaningless word rep-
etitions. Another author (VL) then reads 835 reports (150 
per  psychedelic  substance,  where  available)  and,  where 
necessary, deleted any bits of text that did not describe the 
immediate effects of the substance (the “trip”). We then 
compared these shortened reports against their full-length 
versions to ensure the outcomes of interest were not biased 
by trip-unrelated information in the full reports. In paired-
samples t-tests, there were no significant differences between 
the shortened and full reports on any outcome variable (see 
online supplementary material Table S1), so we analyzed 
the full-length reports in the main analyses.

We collected experience reports for the following psy-
chedelic drugs: psilocybin-containing mushrooms (n = 971 
reports), LSD (n = 671), MDMA (n = 526), N,N-dimethyl-
tryptamine (DMT, n = 312), ketamine (n = 163), and Aya-
huasca (n = 68). For a non-psychedelic drug comparison 
group, we also collected experience reports for conventional 
antidepressant drugs (n = 236). The vast majority of these 
reports described the acute effects of illicit or off-prescrip-
tion use of the reported substances, as opposed to describ-
ing the effects of long-term ingestion of prescribed dosages. 
To reduce the number of necessary statistical comparisons 
and increase statistical power, we analyzed Ayahuasca and 
DMT together (n = 380) due to their considerable overlap 
(Strassman 2001). Thus, there were six drug groups in the 
analyses: psilocybin-containing mushrooms (33.0%), LSD 
(22.8%), MDMA (17.9%), Ayahuasca and DMT (12.9%), 
conventional antidepressants (8.0%), and ketamine (5.5%). 
Table 1 provides descriptive information about each drug 
group.

LIWC analysis

We imported the downloaded Erowid reports in the text 
analysis  software  LIWC2015  (Pennebaker  et  al. 2015). 
LIWC2015 analyzes the occurrence of various pre-defined 
and psychologically meaningful word categories in a body 
of text. For the analyses in this article, we selected the LIWC 
categories “affective processes,” “positive emotion,” “nega-
tive emotion,” “sadness,” “anxiety,” “cognitive processes,” 
and  “analytical  thinking.”  We  deemed  these  categories

relevant because they present psychological outcomes of 
interest that might vary between different psychedelic drug 
experiences; and some of them (anxiety, negative emotion, 
sadness) have been associated with clinical outcomes in pre-
vious research (e.g., depression and anxiety; Eichstaedt et al. 
2018; Sonnenschein et al. 2018). Positive emotion and affec-
tive words (comprising both positive and negative emotion 
words) were selected to complement negative emotion words 
as markers of affective language. The cognitive processes 
variable (“cause,” “know,” “ought”; Pennebaker et al. 2015) 
captures cognitive process words related to insight, causa-
tion, discrepancy, tentativeness, certainty, and differentiation 
and has been associated with anxiety (Alvarez-Conrad et al. 
2001), physical health (Pennebaker et al. 1997), avoidance 
of negative experience (Boals & Klein 2016), and gender 

patterns in language use (Newman et al. 2008). For explora-
tory purposes, we also summarize the results of the analyses 
of the remaining LIWC variables in an online supplementary 
material.

Except for the analytical thinking variable, the LIWC-
derived variables reported here are interpreted as the propor-
tion of corresponding category words (e.g., positive emotion 
words) in the entire text body (i.e., one Erowid report). How-
ever, the analytical thinking variable is based on Pennebaker 
and colleagues’ (2014) categorical-dynamic index, which 
is based on multiple proportions of different word catego-
ries. For this variable, LIWC divides its eight function word 
categories into two groups (articles and prepositions versus 
personal pronouns, impersonal pronouns, auxiliary verbs, 
conjunctions, adverbs, and negations) and then subtracts the 

1 3Psychopharmacology (2022) 239:643–659

647

summed proportions for the second group from the summed 
proportions for the first group (plus a constant), making the 
interpretation more abstract. The analytical thinking variable 
has been found to correlate positively with college grades 
and is thought to reflect heightened abstract thinking (via 
greater article use) and cognitive complexity on the positive 
end (via greater preposition use; Pennebaker et al. 2014). 
On the negative end, the creators interpreted the variable 
as representing a dynamic or narrative language style. This 
might be relevant in the current study because psychedelics 
are thought to impair the evaluative dimension of abstract 
thought (Bayne & Carter 2018). The previously mentioned 
LIWC variables were thus chosen as continuous outcome 
measures to compare substances on.

Latent semantic analysis

Next to the word frequency-based LIWC analyses, we also 
analyzed the reports with latent semantic analysis (LSA), 
a  natural  language  processing  technique  that  quantifies 
the semantic similarity between two given text corpora. 
We examined the semantic similarity between the Erowid 
reports and two reference texts to operationalize the simi-
larity between report authors’ experiences and the expe-
riences that the reference texts were designed to capture. 
Precisely,  the  reference  texts  were  scales  for  measuring 
psychedelic  and  mystical  experiences,  respectively:  the 
OAV scale (Studerus et al. 2010) and Hood’s Mysticism 
scale (Hood 1975). We ran LSA in Python 3.8 (using Spyder 
5.0.5). First, we preprocessed the text materials with the 
nltk part-of-speech tagger and lemmatized the text corpus 
using the WordNet lemmatizer contained in the nltk library 
(Bird et al. 2009). We then ran two LSAs using the gensim 
library (Řehůřek & Sojka 2010) on the Erowid report cor-
pus to determine semantic similarity values for each Erowid 
report with reference to the OAV scale (for psychedelic 
experiences) and Hood’s M scale (for mystical experiences), 
respectively. This allowed for group-level comparisons of 
semantic similarity between report groups, akin to previ-
ous research into the effects of psychedelic substances (Bedi 
et al. 2014; Martial et al. 2019).

Statistical analyses

To examine the association between substance and word fre-
quency, we conducted ANOVAs with each of the selected 
outcomes as dependent variable (continuous; LIWC word 
category frequencies and LSA similarity index values) and 
substance as the independent variable (categorical, i.e., anti-
depressants vs Ayahuasca and DMT vs ketamine vs MDMA 
vs LSD vs psilocybin mushrooms). Significant effects were 
followed up with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc tests. The 
ANOVA  assumptions  were  checked  by  means  of  visual 

inspection of histograms and Q-Q plots (normality assump-
tion) and Levene’s test (homoscedasticity assumption). In 
case of violations, we used appropriate robust alternatives 
(heteroscedastic one-way ANOVA for trimmed means in 
case of heteroscedasticity; Kruskal–Wallis test in case of 
non-normality or both assumptions being violated) and their 
corresponding post hoc tests (Yuen’s test for trimmed-means 
and Dunn test for nonparametric comparisons). We also ana-
lyzed demographic variables in this way, although we used 
a chi-squared test for the analysis of gender by report group 
(with z-tests for independent proportions as potential follow-
up comparisons). We used RStudio (version 1.3.1073) for 
all analyses, and the ggstatsplot package in R for data visu-
alization (Patil 2018; R Core Team 2020). The significance 
level was α = 0.05.

Results

Outcome variable assumption checks revealed problems 
with the normality assumption on negative emotion, anxiety, 
and sadness words and problems with homoscedasticity on 
positive emotion, negative emotion, anxiety, sadness words, 
OAV scale semantic similarity, and Hood’s M scale semantic 
similarity scores. As a consequence, we used ggstatsplot’s 
robust option for positive emotion words, OAV scale simi-
larity index, and Hood’s M scale similarity index and the 
nonparametric option for negative emotion, anxiety, and sad-
ness words and interpreted the results appropriately. Due 
to normality and homoscedasticity violations on age and 
weight, respectively, we also used appropriate alternative 
tests for these variables.

Discussion

The present study analyzed anonymous online experience 
reports linked to the use of various psychedelic drugs. The 
exploratory analyses revealed clear differences between 
report  groups,  which  amounted  to  very  small  (anxiety 
words), small (sadness words), medium (affective process, 
negative emotion, positive emotion, and cognitive process 
words; analytical thinking index), and large (OAV scale 
and Hood’s M scale semantic similarity) effect sizes (Field 
2013; Wilcox & Tian 2011). These effect sizes should be

Fig. 4   Violin plot of analytical thinking index scores by report group 
(significant comparisons denoted by *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001). 
MDMA  reports  featured  the  lowest  mean  analytical  thinking  index 
score; significantly lower than that of Ayahuasca and DMT, psilocy-
bin  mushroom,  LSD,  and  ketamine  reports.  Antidepressant  reports 

featured  significantly  lower  scores  than  Ayahuasca  and  DMT  and 
psilocybin  mushroom  reports.  LSD  reports  featured  a  significantly 
lower analytical thinking index mean score than Ayahuasca and DMT 
reports

kept in mind as the different language profiles of the dif-
ferent report groups will be discussed step-by-step below.
Ayahuasca and DMT reports contained relatively little 
affective language, notably on negative emotion and sadness 
words. They also featured relatively few cognitive process 
words and high scores on the analytical thinking variable. 
Given that some aspects of the Ayahuasca experience (nau-
sea, vomiting, diarrhea, bad taste of the beverage; Hamill 
et al. 2019) would be expected to feel quite unpleasant, it is 
somewhat surprising that this was not reflected in the reports 
via a greater proportion of negative emotional language. 
This counterintuitive finding could be explained with Aya-
huasca reports making up less than a fifth of the reports in 
the Ayahuasca and DMT group. Indeed, when we analyzed 

the proportion of negative emotion words for Ayahuasca 
and DMT reports separately, we found that DMT reports 
featured significantly a lower median proportion of nega-
tive emotion words than the other report groups, whereas 
Ayahuasca  reports  featured  a  higher  median  proportion 
of negative emotion words (albeit not significantly differ-
ent from the other psychedelic report groups; see Fig. S6). 
Hence, despite being a key component of the psychedelic 
effects of Ayahuasca, DMT may not be responsible for Aya-
huasca’s negative side effects. Ayahuasca and DMT reports 
also featured the greatest semantic similarity with the ref-
erential psychedelic and mystical experience scales. This 
might indicate that on average, Ayahuasca and DMT reports 
described the most psychedelic and mystical experiences.

Fig. 5   Violin  plot  of  OAV  scale  latent  semantic  analysis  similar-
ity  index  scores  by  report  group  (significant  comparisons  denoted 
by  ***p < .001).  Ayahuasca  and  DMT  reports  featured  significantly 
more semantic similarity to the OAV scale than each of the remain-

ing  report  groups.  Antidepressant  reports  featured  significantly  less 
semantic  similarity  to  the  OAV  scale  than  each  of  the  remaining 
report groups

The latter would be consistent with the findings of Griffiths 
et al. (2019), who found that complete mystical experiences 
were most frequent, and mystical experience questionnaire 
scores the highest in a group of users who reported having 
had a God encounter after consuming DMT, relative to hav-
ing consumed psilocybin, LSD, or no drug (Fig. S7 shows 
that the finding remains consistent even when examining 
DMT reports separately).

Ketamine reports were associated with relatively little 
affective language, particularly on positive emotion and 
anxiety words. As controlled research has observed facial 
affective  flattening  on  ketamine  (Pomarol-Clotet  et  al. 
2006), one could speculate whether the language and facial 
expressions associated with ketamine’s effects both reflect 
an underlying emotional blunting. Although one review lists 

emotional blunting as a potential side effect of ketamine 
(Caddy et al. 2015), more research is needed to test this 
idea. Ketamine reports also featured relatively many cogni-
tive process words. This might be because report writers 
noticed changes in their cognitive function, which they then 
discussed in their reports. The direction of these changes 
could be positive or negative. For example, affective flat-
tening could lead to less interference of negative emotion 
with cognitive processes (Scheidegger et al. 2016), thereby 
increasing cognitive processing and reports thereof. Con-
trarily, it might also be that ketamine produced cognitive 
impairments (Morgan et al. 2004), and this in turn led to the 
increased cognitive process words observed in the current 
study. As could generally be the case for this study’s results, 
an alternative explanation for the cognitive process words

Fig. 6   Violin  plot  of  Hood’s  M  scale  latent  semantic  analysis  simi-
larity index scores by report group (significant comparisons denoted 
by  **p < .01,  ***p < .001).  Ayahuasca  and  DMT  reports  featured 
significantly  more  semantic  similarity  to  Hood’s  M  scale  than  each 
of  the  remaining  report  groups.  LSD  reports  featured  significantly 

more  semantic  similarity  than  antidepressant,  MDMA,  and  psilo-
cybin  mushroom  reports.  MDMA  reports  featured  significantly  less 
semantic similarity than ketamine and psilocybin mushroom reports. 
Antidepressant  reports  featured  significantly  less  semantic  similarity 
to Hood’s M scale than ketamine and psilocybin mushroom reports

finding could be that the difference was not due to the drug’s 
effects themselves but rather due to some unknown third fac-
tor like selection bias. For example, individuals who choose 
to use ketamine might habitually use less cognitive process 
words than individuals who choose to use other drugs. Given 
that ketamine dosages in these reports were likely greater 
than the low-dose ketamine and esketamine therapeutic use 
in current clinical practice (e.g., Bartoli et al. 2017), these 
results may not apply to clinical settings.

LSD reports featured the highest proportion of nega-
tive  emotion  words  among  the  psychedelic  drug  report 
groups, although only the difference with Ayahuasca and 
DMT reports reached statistical significance, and the pro-
portion was nearly half that of antidepressant reports. The 

same pattern was observed on sadness words and on anxiety 
words; LSD reports were significantly different from keta-
mine only. LSD reports were on neither of the extreme ends 
of the cognitive processes and analytical thinking variables. 
LSD reports were associated with fewer cognitive process 
words than ketamine MDMA, and antidepressant reports, 
lower analytical thinking scores than Ayahuasca and DMT 
reports, and higher analytical thinking scores than MDMA 
reports. The finding of a high negative emotion word propor-
tion in LSD reports might have been due to writers’ direct 
experience of negative emotions, or an analytical focus on 
their own, or others’ negative emotions in other situations. 
The latter explanation would be consistent with experi-
mental findings of enhanced emotional empathy under the 

1 3Psychopharmacology (2022) 239:643–659

655

influence of LSD (Dolder et al. 2016). Interestingly, Dolder 
and colleagues also found that LSD reduced the recogni-
tion of negative emotion, which would support the idea that 
the observed effects in this study may have been due to a 
conceptual-analytical focus on, rather than an increased 
experience of, negative emotion.

MDMA reports were characterized by relatively affec-
tive language. This was consistent with other natural lan-
guage processing-based research (Bedi et al. 2014), and in 
part due to a high proportion of positive emotion words, 
consistent with findings from previous LIWC-based experi-
mental research (Bedi et al. 2014; Wardle & de Wit 2014). 
MDMA reports also featured a relatively high proportion 
of negative emotion words, which is inconsistent with the 
results reported by Wardle and de Wit (2014), who found no 
differences between MDMA and placebo on negative emo-
tion word frequency. In other research, there were mixed 
results as MDMA was associated not only with increased 
anxiety but also with decreased recognition of specific nega-
tive emotions (sadness and anger) in photos of human faces 
(Kirkpatrick et al. 2014). There also were a relatively high 
proportion of cognitive process words and the lowest score 
on the analytical thinking variable. The cognitive process 
words finding is interesting, because previous research has 
demonstrated cognitive decrements due to MDMA (Par-
rott & Lasky 1998). Thus, it could be that writers were 
aware of their cognitive difficulties, and writing about this 
in the reports increased the frequency of cognitive process 
words. The analytical thinking variable finding indicates 
that MDMA reports were associated with language rich in 
personal pronouns, impersonal pronouns, auxiliary verbs, 
conjunctions, adverbs, and negations and low in articles 
and prepositions (Pennebaker et al. 2014). This represents 
a more dynamic and personal, as opposed to analytical and 
impersonal narration style; potentially due to intensified 
emotional states on MDMA. Lastly, of all the psychedelic 
substance report groups, MDMA reports featured the least 
semantic similarity with Hood’s mystical experience scale 
(comparable to antidepressant reports), which seems consist-
ent with previous research results (Lyvers & Meester 2012).
Psilocybin mushroom reports were not on the extreme 
ends of any outcome variable. Notably, they featured less 
affective language than MDMA (also on positive emotion 
words) and antidepressant reports (due to negative emotion 
and sadness words, as the reverse was true for positive emo-
tion words) but more than Ayahuasca and DMT (also on 
negative emotion and sadness words) and ketamine reports 
(also on positive emotion and anxiety words). There also 
was a lower proportion of cognitive process words than in 
MDMA, ketamine, and antidepressant reports and a higher 
analytical thinking score than in MDMA and antidepressant 
reports. There was more semantic similarity to Hood’s mys-
ticism scale relative to MDMA and antidepressant reports 

but less similarity relative to Ayahuasca and DMT and LSD 
reports, as well as less similarity to the OAV scale relative 
to Ayahuasca and DMT reports. One could compare these 
results to those of a survey study of individuals who had 
a God encounter (Griffiths et al. 2019), which found that 
psilocybin-induced God encounters reportedly featured less 
strong and less frequent complete mystical experiences than 
DMT-induced encounters (whereas there was no difference 
to LSD and Ayahuasca experiences; Griffiths et al. 2019).

Antidepressant reports, which were included as a non-
psychedelic substance comparison regarding Erowid users’ 
language, featured a distinct profile. They featured a rela-
tively high proportion of affective language (only outscored 
by MDMA reports), but in contrast to MDMA reports, this 
was due to a significantly higher proportion of negative emo-
tion and sadness words relative to the other report groups, 
the proportion of positive emotion words being lower than 
that in the other reports. This finding might be naturally 
explained  by  antidepressant  users’  higher  prevalence  of 
depression and associated negative emotional biases. Anti-
depressant reports also featured the highest proportion of 
cognitive process words, which one could attribute to cogni-
tive characteristics of depression like increased rumination. 
On analytical thinking, antidepressant reports featured lower 
scores than Ayahuasca and DMT and psilocybin mushroom 
reports, but did not differ from the remaining psychedelic 
drugs (and scored higher than MDMA reports), indicating 
a notable difference between psychedelic substances on this 
dimension. Antidepressant reports also featured less seman-
tic similarity with the psychedelic and mystical experience 
scales than the psychedelic drug report groups.

Though no prior study has compared the present com-
bination  of  psychedelic  substances  on  psycholinguistic 
variables like this study did, previous research used similar 
outcomes or analytic methods. Studies that examined the 
effects of psychedelic drugs on the psychological states or 
processes underlying the psycholinguistic outcomes of this 
study reported emotional effects of psychedelic drugs, such 
as an emotionally intensifying profile on MDMA (Agurto 
et al. 2020; Bedi et al. 2014), decreased negative emotions 
like sadness on ketamine (Hasler et al. 2020), increased 
5D-ASC blissful state and increased emotional excitability 
with a bias toward positive emotion on LSD (Carhart-Harris 
et al. 2016a; Liechti et al. 2017; Schmid et al. 2015), and 
emotional excitability on psilocybin (Hasler et al. 2004). 
Furthermore, some research also observed cognitive disor-
ganization on LSD (Carhart-Harris et al. 2016b). However, 
few studies compared psychedelic drugs against each other. 
Holze et al. (2020) and Liechti et al. (2017) compared LSD 
against MDMA on the Mystical Experience Questionnaire 
and found a seemingly contradictory result to the present 
study, where LSD was associated with higher “deeply felt 
positive mood” and “positive mood” subscale scores than 

1 3656

Psychopharmacology (2022) 239:643–659

MDMA.  Furthermore,  LSD  was  associated  with  higher 
5D-ASC blissful state scores (Holze et al. 2020). Zamber-
lan et al. (2018) compared many different psychedelic drugs 
with latent semantic analysis of Erowid experience reports 
but only correlated the semantic similarity (to other report 
groups) with the molecular structural similarity between 
drugs to infer something about the effects that molecular 
differences might have on psycholinguistic outcomes. These 
results emphasize that ideally, experimental research should 
compare different psychedelic drugs directly on outcomes 
derived from both natural language processing methods 
and validated questionnaires to (a) determine differences 
between psychedelic drugs and (b) the relationship between 
linguistic indicators of psychological variables and self-
report measures of those same variables.

This study was limited in several ways. First, the design 
and analyses of the study did not permit causal inference. 
The fact that there was no control over the administration, 
dosage, and quality of psychedelic substances, nor over the 
time at which the experience was recalled and reported, 
shows  that  these  results  should  only  be  interpreted  as 
indirect indicators of potential substance group effects. 
For example, it is not clear whether the use of the exam-
ined substances produced the differences in language that 
the analyses detected or whether this was due to a third 
variable predisposing individuals toward recreational use 
of a specific substance that also influenced the linguistic 
outcomes. We did, however, check demographic variables 
(age, weight, and gender) and found significant differences 
between substances. For example, Ayahuasca and DMT, 
psilocybin, and antidepressant reports were associated 
with older age than LSD and MDMA reports. Ayahuasca 
and  DMT  reports  were  associated  with  heavier  report 
authors  than  LSD  and  MDMA  reports,  the  latter  also 
involving significantly lighter authors than psilocybin and 
antidepressant reports. Females were underrepresented in 
Ayahuasca and DMT, ketamine, and psilocybin reports 
and overrepresented in MDMA reports. Some of these 
effects  might  be  interrelated,  and  some  of  them  might 
also be related to the findings on the linguistic outcomes. 
For example, the lower weight of MDMA report writers 
might be due to the relative overrepresentation of women 
in this group, which might in turn explain part of the more 
emotional language in this group (Newman et al. 2008). 
Rigid experimental research balancing the proportions of 
men and women per substance could provide insights into 
these relationships, although such research should be very 
difficult to conduct with the combination of substances 
examined here. Future research could also monitor other 
potential sources of bias, such as cultural background or 
socioeconomic status. Another limitation concerns the 
antidepressant report group, which is not an ideal control 

condition, as would be a placebo group in a hypothetical 
controlled experimental version of this study. Given the 
constraints of the study design, though, the antidepressant 
reports did provide useful information about the language 
of Erowid authors who did not use psychedelic substances.
Given the absence of experimental data regarding the 
psycholinguistic effects of different psychedelic drugs, this 
study provided valuable insights. In light of its findings 
and limitations, future research could build on this study 
by conducting a methodologically robust experimental 
trial examining the substances reviewed here, and a poten-
tial control or placebo substance, using free speech tran-
scripts or written texts produced during the experience. 
Another limitation concerns the dearth of demographic 
information about the sample, as more data could help 
explain who uses psychedelic drugs and with what motiva-
tion. The available descriptive information (i.e., age, gen-
der, weight) provided some insight (e.g., women, lighter, 
and younger people being relatively overrepresented in 
MDMA reports; Ayahuasca and DMT report writers being 
relatively old; Ayahuasca and DMT, ketamine, and psilo-
cybin report groups being relatively male), but more vari-
ables might be needed to show that differences between 
substances persist when controlling for individual differ-
ences. Future research could thus examine demographic 
variables not available here (e.g., educational/social status, 
cultural background, substance preference).

Conclusion

This study examined differences in linguistic markers of 
psychological function between different psychedelic drug 
experience reports. These differences indicated certain 
psychological effect profiles, although more controlled 
studies are necessary to more closely examine these pro-
files and replicate the current results. The study indicates 
that some drugs may have an emotionally intensifying 
profile  accompanied  by  many  cognitive  process  words 
and dynamic, personal language (MDMA), whereas oth-
ers are characterized by reductions of emotional language, 
relatively few cognitive process words, and increases in 
analytical thinking-associated language (Ayahuasca and 
DMT), and again others show a mixed effect profile (ket-
amine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms). With this article, 
we hope to contribute to the development of psychedelic-
assisted psychotherapy or psychiatric treatments for psy-
chiatric problems, for example, by optimizing the selection 
of appropriate substances based on patient needs.
