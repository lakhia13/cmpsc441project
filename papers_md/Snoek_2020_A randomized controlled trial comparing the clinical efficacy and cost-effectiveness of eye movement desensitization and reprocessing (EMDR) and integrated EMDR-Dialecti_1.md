Abstract

Background: Comorbidity between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
is high. There is growing motivation among clinicians to offer PTSD treatments – such as Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) - to patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD. However, a large subgroup
with comorbid BPD does not sufficiently respond to PTSD treatment and is more likely to be excluded or to
dropout from treatment. Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) for BPD is well established and although there is some
evidence that DBT combined with DBT Prolonged Exposure (DBT + DBT PE) is twice as effective in reducing PTSD
symptoms than DBT alone, the comparative efficacy of integrated PTSD-DBT and PTSD-only treatment has not been
investigated yet. The current study will therefore evaluate the comparative clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. Moreover, it is not clear yet what
treatment works best for which individual patient. The current study will therefore evaluate neurobiological
predictors and mediators of the individual response to treatment.

Method: A randomized controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated EMDR-
DBT (n = 63) and EMDR-only (n = 63) in treatment-seeking adult patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD.
In addition, neurobiological predictors and mediators of treatment outcome, such as hair cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF
protein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF methylation status, are measured through hair and blood samples.

Discussion: This is the first study to compare the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated EMDR-DBT
and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD, while simultaneously identifying individual
predictors and mediators of treatment response. Results will reveal which treatment works best for which individual
patient, thereby guiding individual treatment choices and personalizing psychiatry.

Background
Psychologically traumatic events like terrorist acts, civil
wars, community violence, and natural disasters are
highly prevalent in people’s lives. During life, 90% of the
population experiences at least one traumatic event [1].
The posttraumatic stress often resulting from such
events poses a significant public health challenge. With a
lifetime prevalence of 10%, posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) is one of the most prevalent DSM-5 disorders
[1]. Symptoms include intrusive memories and night-
mares of the trauma, irritability, hyper vigilance, diffi-
culty
concentration and emotional
withdrawal (DSM-5, 2013). In addition to the clinical
burden, many patients experience relational, occupa-
tional and financial problems [2]. On top of that, PTSD
is associated with greater mental health utilization and
higher health care costs,
including costs for specialist
and primary care [3, 4]. Consequences of PTSD are thus
costly, not only for patients but also to the health care
system and to society as a whole. The high prevalence
along with the significant functional and financial bur-
den makes research into clinically- and cost-effective
treatments for PTSD imperative [5].

desensitization and

reprocessing
(EMDR) is a widely used intervention for the treatment
of PTSD [6]. Although the mechanisms underlying
EMDR have been a source of controversy, its efficacy for
PTSD is now generally supported [7]. More than half of
patients who complete EMDR treatment significantly
improve compared to usual-care or waiting list [8, 9].
However, despite the well-established efficacy of EMDR
for PTSD, a large subgroup of patients does not suffi-
ciently respond to treatment [10, 11]. There is some evi-
dence that patients with a PTSD and comorbid BPD
symptoms are less likely to achieve good end-state func-
tioning after trauma-focused treatment than those with-
out comorbid BPD symptomatology ([12–14] – in
preparation). Moreover, comorbidity between PTSD and
from
BPD might be associated with higher dropout

PTSD treatment than PTSD alone [15]. Lastly, because
of the common confluence of exclusion criteria for sui-
cidality and self-destructive behaviour, a large subgroup
of patients with comorbid borderline personality features
is excluded from PTSD treatment [16].

Comorbidity between PTSD and borderline person-
ality disorder (BPD) is high, with at least a quarter of
PTSD patients also meeting BPD criteria and vice
versa [17]. BPD is characterised by a pervasive pattern
of instability in self-image, affect regulation and inter-
personal relationships [18]. The disorder causes severe
psychological
impairment and is associated with a
high mortality rate due to suicide [19]. This is also
true for patients with subclinical BPD, who are diag-
nosed with a higher number of DSM 5 disorders,
have higher marginal
levels of suicide attempts and
experience more social and professional problems
compared to healthy controls [20]. Dialectical Behav-
iour Therapy (DBT) is a frequently investigated psy-
chological
22]. DBT
intervention for BPD [21,
significantly reduces self-mutilation and suicidal be-
haviour, while improving treatment compliance in
both subclinical and clinical BPD [23]. In line with
this, DBT as a precursor to PTSD treatment reduces
suicidal and self-injuring behaviour in PTSD patients
with comorbid BPD, thereby increasing the inclusion
rate for subsequent PTSD treatment [24]. However,
given the severe physical and emotional distress, it is
far from ideal to have a patient wait for 12 months
before starting PTSD treatment. Besides, successive
DBT and EMDR treatment could take up to 18
months, which does not constitute the most time effi-
cient alternative and may lead to patients dropping
out from treatment prematurely. Simultaneously treat-
ing PTSD and BPD might thus provide a more time-
efficient alternative, given that
such an integrated
treatment would result in considerably shorter treat-
ment duration. Moreover, treating PTSD while simul-
taneously treating borderline symptomology might

and of

reduce exclusion and dropout rates while improving
end-state functioning,
thereby holding promise for
improving clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness at
the same time [25–27]. Although two randomized
controlled trials have already established the clinical
efficacy of integrating DBT with DBT PE as compared
to DBT-only
integrating DBT with
trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural approaches as
compared to waiting-list
[25], much remains to be
learned about the clinical efficacy of integrated PTSD-
DBT compared to PTSD-only treatment (see also the
online study protocol of Bohus et al. [29] who com-
pared an integrated DBT-PTSD treatment, with inter-
ventions derived from cognitive behavioural therapy,
acceptance and commitment therapy and compassion-
focused therapy, to cognitive processing therapy for
PTSD). Moreover, although previous studies found
DBT to have the highest cost-effectiveness compared
to treatment as usual (i.e. weekly individual therapy,
supportive or psycho-educational groups) and com-
the

Although comparing the clinical efficacy and cost-
effectiveness of integrated EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only
might lead to novel insights for the treatment of PTSD
with comorbid (sub)clinical BPD, solely studying the link
between treatments and symptoms would fail to explain
how exactly these treatments potentially affects these
symptoms. Investigating potential predictors and medi-
ating pathways might aid in the identification of causal
mechanisms underlying a certain treatment effect and
thereby assist in the modification of elements that are
crucial for therapeutic change, while dismissing those
found to be redundant. Such variables could thus specify
for whom and under which conditions a treatment
might or might not be effective, thereby maximizing
treatment efficacy and efficiency while minimizing costs.
To the best of our knowledge, to date no randomized
controlled trials have been conducted that incorporate
potential predictors and mediators of the response to
EMDR or DBT treatment in patients with PTSD and
BPD respectively. The current study will therefore in-
corporate three well-known and well-studied neurobio-
logical
factors that have been associated with risk,
resilience and response to psychotherapy in both PTSD
thereby linking our primary psychological
and BPD,

outcomes to disorder-relevant neurobiological outcomes.
As such, the first candidate predictor and mediator con-
stitutes the main stress hormone cortisol. The majority
of research supports an enhanced negative feedback in-
hibition of cortisol on the pituitary gland in individuals
with PTSD, resulting in attenuated baseline cortisol
levels compared to healthy individuals (for a review see:
[31]; Zoladz & Diamond, [26, 32]; for a meta-analysis
see: [33]; for a review and meta-analysis of contradicting
findings see: [34]). Particularly interesting is that patients
with lower initial cortisol levels were found to be more
likely to respond to treatment than patients with higher
initial levels of cortisol [35]. In addition, patients who
responded well to treatment showed an increase in corti-
sol levels over time, while cortisol levels decreased in
non-responders [36]. With regard to BPD findings are
less consistent, possibly because of confounding by rele-
vant patient characteristics such as comorbidity with
other mental disorders [37]. This hypothesis is sup-
ported by previous research demonstrating that cortisol
release in BPD depends on the severity of PTSD symp-
toms, such that more severe PTSD symptoms are associ-
ated with reduced cortisol
levels [38]. On the other
hand, cortisol release in PTSD depends on the presence
of BPD, given that veterans with PTSD and comorbid
BPD had lower cortisol levels than veterans with PTSD
alone [39]. Given that hair cortisol provides a stable,
long-term retrospective month-by-month measure of
cortisol exposure, the current study will assess whether
hair cortisol predicts and mediates the treatment re-
sponse in patients with PTSD and comorbid BPD [40,
41]. A second candidate predictor and mediator of the
treatment response is FKBP5, which is known for regu-
lating cortisol-binding affinity and has been associated
with both PTSD and BPD [42, 43]. Reduced FKBP5 pro-
tein levels, which are associated with enhanced FKBP5
methylation, facilitate enhanced glucocorticoid receptor
(GR) responsiveness, leading to lower cortisol levels in
individuals with PTSD and BPD [35, 44–46]. Of particu-
lar interest is a study of Yehuda et al. [47], demonstrat-
ing that within a sample of PTSD patients, those who
responded to treatment showed a decrease in FKBP5
methylation, whereas non-responders showed an in-
crease in FKBP5 methylation. The same result was found
in PTSD patients receiving a meditation intervention, in-
dicating that FKBP5 protein levels and FKBP5 methyla-
tion status are viable biological correlates of PTSD and
BPD and might therefore hold promise as predictors and
mediators of the response to treatment [48]. A third
candidate predictor and mediator of the treatment re-
sponse is Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). A
recent study suggested that attenuated BDNF protein
levels, which are associated with enhanced BDNF methy-
lation, might contribute to the onset and maintenance of

Snoek et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:396

both PTSD and BPD within the same individual [49]. In
line with this, Perroud et al. [50] found enhanced BDNF
methylation baseline levels in BPD compared to con-
trols, and even higher BDNF methylation baseline levels
in patients who experienced a higher number of child-
hood trauma [50]. Importantly, BPD patients who posi-
tively responded to DBT showed a decrease in BDNF
methylation over time, whereas non-responders showed
an increase in BDNF methylation status [50]. Last of all,
Park et al. [51] found that BDNF protein baseline levels
might also contribute to the therapeutic response of
PTSD patients receiving EMDR, given that BDNF pro-
tein baseline levels of responders were higher compared
to non-responders [51].

In conclusion, previous research demonstrated that
cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5
and BDNF methylation status are viable biological corre-
lates of the (change in) PTSD and BPD symptoms. The
current study will examine whether these factors can
also predict and mediate the response to treatment in
patients with PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD.
Given that previous research investigated these bio-
markers at the group-level, the current study will assess
whether these biomarkers can also predict and mediate
the individual treatment response. It is hypothesized that
cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5
and BDNF methylation status predict and mediate the
individual
response to integrated EMDR-DBT and
EMDR-only, in adults with PTSD and comorbid (sub)-
clinical BPD.

Method
Objectives
Primary objectives
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the
clinical efficacy of integrated EMDR-DBT as compared
to EMDR-only in adults with PTSD and comorbid (sub)-
clinical BPD. It is hypothesized that integrated EMDR-
DBT will result in a higher effect size (d = 1.0) compared
to EMDR-only (d = 0.5), in clients with PTSD and co-
morbid (sub)clinical BPD

Secondary objectives
The secondary objective of this study is to identify pre-
dictors and mediators of the individual treatment re-
sponse. It is hypothesized that neurobiological factors
(i.e. cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5
and BDNF methylation status) predict and mediate the
individual response to treatment in adults with PTSD
and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. Moreover, this study
aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of
integrated
EMDR-DBT as compared to EMDR-only. It is hypothe-
sized that, although more expensive in direct medical

costs, cost-effectiveness will be higher for integrated
EMDR-DBT than for EMDR-only.

Study design and setting
This study is part of an overarching research project in-
vestigating the comparative efficacy of integrated PTSD-
PD and PTSD-only treatment, within two parallel ran-
domized controlled trials (for a detailed description of
the overarching project, see NCT03833453; for a de-
tailed description of the second randomized controlled
trail, see van den End et al. (2009 - under review); for a
detailed description of the fMRI substudy, see Aarts
et al. (in preparation). The study described herein will
follow a randomized controlled design and takes place at
two study sites of Sinai Centrum in Amsterdam and
Amstelveen, The Netherlands, between June 2017 and
June 2022. After a screening visit and obtaining in-
formed consent, clients are randomly assigned to inte-
grated
EMDR-only. Various
psychological and biological factors are assessed over a
total of six measurement time points (i.e. T0, T1, T2,
T3, T4 and a follow-up measure; See Fig. 1 for a flow
chart of the study design). A research assistant who is
blinded to the intervention conducts the clinical inter-
views and blood is collected at the hospital. For a de-
tailed overview of the type and timing of measurements,
we would like to refer to Table 1.

Participants

Recruitment Study participants are recruited from cli-
ents seeking treatment for trauma-related complaints at
Sinai Centrum in Amstelveen and Amersfoort, The
Netherlands.

For inclusion in the study, clients need to (1) be aged
between 18 and 65 years, (2) have sufficient mastery of
the Dutch language, (3) be diagnosed with PTSD accord-
ing to the DSM-5, (4) meet at least four criteria of BPD
according to the DSM-5.

Clients are excluded from study participation in case
of (1) current psychosis, (2) primary diagnosis of para-
noid, schizoid, schizotypal, narcissistic, histrionic or anti-
social personality disorder, (3) mental retardation (i.e.
IQ < 70), (4) comorbidity interfering with treatment or
randomisation (i.e. severe outward aggression, current
addiction disorder without the capacity or intention to
stop for treatment, eating disorders with BMI < 17), and/
or (5) participation in another research project that re-
quires the patient to receive psychotherapy outside of
the current study. In case of acute suicidality, recent sui-
cide attempts and/or non-suicidal self-injury, the possi-
bility to start (or to continue) treatment is assessed by a
the
clinician on an individual basis.

If necessary,

treatment is adjusted according to the clients’ needs. For
instance, the patient can create a patient safety plan to-
gether with a therapist aimed at mentally preparing the
patient for participation in the study. In addition, a
psychiatrist can be involved who may or may not decide
to medically treat the patient. A social worker or a psy-
chiatric nurse can also be involved in order to provide
extra support to the patient. As long as no additional
psychological intervention is added, the patient remains
within the study. If these options deem insufficient (i.e.
the patient remains actively self-harming or at acute risk
for suicide) the therapist may decide to intensify the
EMDR treatment by offering multiple sessions per week
within the outpatient setting, or to continue treatment
within a clinical setting. In the latter two cases, the pa-
tient is excluded from the current study and considered
a dropout. In case of high dose benzodiazepine use (i.e.
equivalent
to 3 × 10 mg oxazepam on a daily basis)
which may inhibit the response to EMDR treatment,

patients are required to be abstinent on the day of the
EMDR session and one day before and after the EMDR
session. Additionally, patients using psychotropic medi-
cation need to have a stable medication regimen for at
least three weeks prior to admission to the study. All
treating psychiatrists are aware of
these medication
guidelines and monitor the patients closely. Psychiatrists
discuss any necessary deviations from the study protocol
with the researchers. In addition, medication use is mon-
itored by means of self-report (i.e. see Methods; TiC-P).
After treatment completion each participant’s medica-
tion record is examined by one of the researchers in
order to record all deviations for later analyses.

Sample size calculation A power calculation was con-
ducted based on Twisk [52], with a two-sided .05 signifi-
cance level and a statistical power of 80%. A small
Cohen’s’ d effect size (i.e. d ≤ 0.5) was estimated for the
EMDR-only condition and a large Cohen’s d effect size

(i.e. d ≥ 1.0) was estimated for the integrated EMDR-
DBT condition, in patients with PTSD and (sub)clinical
BPD [11, 28]. To detect a minimal clinical relevant dif-
ference of 0.5 standard deviations on the CAPS-5 with
two follow-up measurements and an intrapersonal cor-
relation coefficient of 0.5, a sample size of 50 patients is
required for each treatment condition. Taking into
account a dropout rate of approximately 25%, 63 clients
per treatment condition will be included [53, 54]. The ex-
pected participant selection process is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Assessments
Clients are assessed at a screening appointment and dur-
ing the first week of pre-treatment admission (T0), as
well as three months after the start of treatment (T1),
directly after completion of the EMDR treatment (T2),
and nine (T3), twelve (T4) and eighteen months (FU)
after the T2 measurement (see Fig. 1). A doctoral-level
clinician who received initial accredited training (i.e. Arq
Academy, Diemen, Netherlands) will administer the clin-
ical interviews. According to the preference of the client,
online questionnaires are filled in at home or at Sinai
Centrum. A detailed overview of the type, duration and
timing of all measurements is given in Table 1.

Screening As part of the standard care, all clients apply-
ing for
treatment at Sinai Centrum are asked to
complete a series of online questionnaires during the
first week of pre-treatment admission (i.e. Routine Out-
come Measurements (ROM); See Table 1). If the psych-
ologist who performs the intake deems the client eligible
based on the aforementioned in- and exclusion criteria
and if the client meets at least four BPD criteria on the
SCID-5-PD screener, the client receives an information
folder of the study. In case of interest, the psychologist
informs one of the researchers, who in turn contacts the
client by phone to further explain the study procedure.
If the client wishes to participate, the client is invited to
Sinai Centrum for a SCID-5-S and SCID-5-PD interview
of approximately 120 min conducted by the researcher.
If the client meets at least four BPD criteria on the
SCID-5-PD, the client is allowed one week time to re-
flect on the potential benefits and risks and to decide
upon participation in the study. The client is then once
again asked whether he or she wants to participate in
the study. If the client still wishes to participate, an ap-
pointment for randomisation and obtaining informed
consent is scheduled.

Fig. 2 Flow diagram of the expected study progress throughout enrolment and assignment to the interventions

Informed consent, randomisation and blinding After
explanation of the aims, methods, benefits and potential
hazards of the study, the investigator obtains written in-
formed consent from each client participating in the
study. Before random assignment, clients are told that
they have a 50% change of being assigned to either treat-
ment condition. Next, an independent researcher pulls
an envelope from an ordered stack of numbered enve-
lopes to determine the treatment condition. Randomisa-
tion will be based on block randomisation (n = 4 per
block), to guarantee a balance between conditions over
time. Neither researchers, therapists nor study partici-
pants can be blinded to treatment condition given the
nature of the interventions. However, blinding is partly
maintained by ensuring that clients are blinded to re-
search hypotheses and by ensuring that the research as-
sistant who performs the measurements is masked to
the client’s treatment condition, hereafter referred to as
independent evaluator. Last of all, all clients receive a
gift certificate of €10 per measurement.

T0 On arrival at the baseline appointment, an independ-
ent evaluator measures height, weight and resting heart
rate and blood pressure. The independent evaluator then
collects a sample of hair and administers a questionnaire
regarding certain hair characteristics (i.e. natural hair
colour, bleaching, dying, perming and the use of hair

products and corticosteroids). Blood is collected at the
hospital. The CAPS-5 interview is then administered.

A subgroup (approximately 25%) of all patients will be
asked to participate in fMRI research before and after
EMDR treatment. In this subgroup, structural and func-
tional MRI, with resting-state and emotion processing
(face recognition) will be performed. In addition, work-
ing memory and response inhibition are assessed in all
patients at T0, through the computer based N-Back and
the Stop-Signal Task respectively. The fMRI study is not
part of the study outlined in this design paper and will
therefore not be further described (for a more detailed
description of the fMRI study, see NCT03833531.

T1, T3 and follow-up At T1 and T3, clients fill in on-
line questionnaires with a personalized login code (See
Table 1).

T2 At T2, the client is invited to Sinai Centrum for a
CAPS-5 interview by an independent evaluator. Hair and
blood samples are collected from those clients who also
gave these samples at baseline. Lastly, clients fill in on-
line questionnaires (See Table 1).

T4 At T4, the client is invited to Sinai Centrum for a
SCID-5-PD and CAPS-5 interview conducted by an in-
dependent evaluator. Clients also fill in online question-
naires (See Table 1).

Data collection and management
Measurements

PTSD checklist for DSM-5 The PTSD Checklist for
DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a 20-item self-report measure that as-
sesses the presence and severity of the DSM-5 symptoms
of PTSD [55, 56]. The PCL-5 includes a relatively short
criterion A section and the severity of criterion B to E
symptoms is scored on a five-point rating scale, ranging
from not at all (0) to extremely (4). The PCL-5 has
strong internal consistency, strong test-retest reliability
and strong convergent and discriminant validity [57].

Clinician-administered PTSD scale for DSM-5 The
Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-
5) is a structured diagnostic interview to assess the fre-
quency and severity of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms [55, 56].
The interview consists of 30 items (e.g. “In the past
month, have you had any unwanted memories of
counting
(EVENT) while you were awake,
dreams?”). Symptoms in relation to the past month are
examined, with a severity score of two or higher indicat-
ing the presence of a symptom. In addition to symptom
severity, CAPS-5 provides information about the onset
and duration of the symptoms, as well as the dissociative
subtype, response validity and symptom changes com-
pared to a previous CAPS-5 measurement. The CAPS-5
total severity score has high internal consistency and
inter-rater reliability, and good test-retest reliability. In
addition, CAPS-5 diagnosis has strong inter-rater reli-
ability and test-retest reliability, as well as strong corres-
pondence with PTSD diagnoses based on the CAPS for
DSM-4 [58]. Each assessor will receive an accredited
training from ARQ Academy (Diemen, Netherlands) to
administer the interview.

Structured clinical interview for DSM-5 personality
disorders The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5
Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) is a semi-structured
interview to assess the presence and severity of the
DSM-5 personality disorders [59]. Diagnoses are made
either categorically (present or absent) or dimensionally
(summing the ratings for each symptom). Although the
fifth version of the SCID-PD has not been validated yet,
its predecessor SCID-II-PD showed excellent inter-rater
reliability, fair to good test-retest reliability and satisfac-
tory internal consistency [60–62]. Moreover, a pilot
study demonstrated an excellent inter-rated of the Ital-
ian translation of the SCID-5-PD as well [63]. Each as-
sessor will receive an accredited training from ARQ
Academy (Diemen, Netherlands)

to administer

Structured clinical
interview for DSM-5 syndrome
disorders – Dutch version The Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-5 Syndrome Disorders (SCID-5-S) is
a semi-structured interview to assess the presence and
severity of the DSM-5 disorders most commonly seen in
clinical settings ([64]; American Psychiatric Associaction
[65]. Specifically, the following disorders are assessed:
major depressive disorder (current) with or without
(hypo)manic episodes (current); psychotic and related
symptoms (delusions, hallucinations); alcohol use dis-
order (current); substance use disorder (current); panic
disorder (current); agoraphobia (current); social anxiety
disorder (current); generalized anxiety disorder (current);
obsessive-compulsive disorder (current); anorexia ner-
vosa (current) and bulimia nervosa (current). The SCID-
5-S has acceptable to excellent internal consistency and
fair to substantial test-retest reliability [66].

Demographic questionnaire The Demographic ques-
tionnaire assesses basic personal, social and medical
data: 1) gender; 2) age; 3) marital status; 4) daily hous-
ing/living situation; 5) number of children and their age;
6) ethnic background; 7) highest level of achievement in
education; 7) current work and education; 8) religion; 9)
duration of trauma-related complaints; 10) previous in-
dividual
previous
hospitalization; 12) substance abuse or dependence.

Outcome questionnaire 45 The Outcome Question-
naire 45 (OQ-45) is a 45-item questionnaire to measure
clinical outcome [67]. Each item is scored on a five-
point rating scale, ranging from never (0) to almost al-
ways (4). The symptom distress (SD) subscale has 25
items that assess the most common disorders in public
mental health (i.e. depression, anxiety and addiction).
The Interpersonal Relations (IR) subscale contains 11
items that assess relational functioning. The Social Role
(SR) subscale contains nine items assessing functioning
in school, work and leisure. The Dutch version of the
OQ-45 has good criterion validity, sufficient reliability,
adequate concurrent validity and is highly sensitive to
change [68].

Personality assessment inventory-borderline features
scale The Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline
Features (PAI-BOR) Scale is a self-report measure asses-
sing the presence and severity of BPD [69]. The BAI-
BOR consists of four subscales of six items each, reflect-
ing four main characteristics of BPD: affective instability,
negative relationships, identity problems and self-harm.
Each items is rated on a four-point scale, ranging from
false (0) to very true (3). A total PAI-BOR score of 38 or
more indicates the presence of significant BPD features,
typical
whereas a score of 60 or more indicates

Snoek et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:396

borderline personality functioning. The Dutch version of
the PAI-BOR has good internal consistency, satisfactory
reliability and acceptable test-retest reliability [70].

Difficulties in emotion regulation scale The Difficul-
ties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a 41-item
self-report measure to assess clinically relevant difficul-
ties in emotion regulation [71]. DERS items reflect diffi-
culties within four dimensions of emotion regulation:
awareness and understanding of emotions, acceptance of
emotions, the ability to engage in goal-directed behav-
iour and to refrain from impulsive behaviour, and access
to effective emotion regulation strategies.
Items are
scored on a five-point scale, ranging from almost never
(1) to almost always (5). Although the Dutch version of
DERS (DERS-NL) has not been validated yet, the ori-
ginal DERS showed high internal consistency, good test-
retest reliability and adequate construct and predictive
validity [71].

Zelf-analyse Vragenlijst The Zelf-analyse Vragenlijst
(ZAV) is a Dutch version of the original State Trait
Anger Scale (STAS [72, 73];). The ZAV assesses the in-
tensity of state and trait anger through 20 self-report
items, ranging from 1 (almost never) to (4) always. For
the study described herein, only trait anger is assessed
using the 10-item subscale of the ZAV. The STAS has
acceptable to strong internal consistency and psycho-
metric properties for the ZAV trait anger subscale are
adequate [73, 74].

Non-suicidal self-injury screener The Non-suicidal
self-injury (NSSI) screener consists of 7 multiple-choice
items assessing non-suicidal self-injury [75]. In case of
an affirmative responses to the item ‘Have you ever done
any of the following with the purpose of intentionally
hurting yourself?’ engagement in NSSI is determined.
The use of such a single, dichotomous item for assessing
NSSI is common in NSSI research and renders consist-
ent prevalence estimates [76].

Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for costs associated
with psychiatric illness The Trimbos/iMTA question-
naire for costs associated with psychiatric illness (TiC-P)
is a self-report questionnaire assessing direct medical
costs and productivity costs due to absence from work
or reduced efficiency during work in patients with a
mental disorder [77]. The first part of the TiC-P includes
14 structured yes or no questions on the use of medical
resources, each followed by a question on the volume of
medical consumption. The second part includes five
items on work absence, reduced efficiency at work and
related productivity losses. The TiC-P showed perfect to
moderate inter-rater reliability, satisfactory construct

validity and satisfactory test-retest reliability in a clinical
sample of patients with mood and anxiety disorders [78].

five-level

five-dimensional

EuroQol
(EQ-5D-5 L)
questionnaire The EQ-5D-5 L is a self-report question-
naire assessing health-related quality of life [79]. The
EQ-5D-5 L contains two components: health state de-
scription and health-state evaluation. In the description
part, health state is measured through five dimensions:
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort,
and anxiety and depression. Each dimension is scored
on a five-level scale, ranging from no problems (1) to ex-
treme problems (5). Responses to the five dimensions
are weighted and summed to create a total score be-
tween 0 (i.e. deceased) and 1 (i.e. full-health). In the
evaluation part, the client is asked to mark his or her
current health status on a 20 cm Visual Analogue Scale
(VAS) with end points of 0 (i.e. the worst health you can
imagine) and 100 (i.e. the best health you can imagine).
The EQ-5D-5 L has good reliability and good convergent
validity with the World Health Organization 5-item Well
Being Questionnaire [80, 81].

World Health Organization disability assessment
schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) WHODAS 2.0 is a 36-
item self-report questionnaire assessing the daily func-
tion of activity and participation within the 30 previous
including the following six domains: Cognition,
days,
Mobility, Self-care, Getting along, Life activities and Par-
ticipation [82]. The responses on each item range from
no difficulty (1) to extreme difficulty (5). Responses to
the six dimensions are weighted and summed to create a
total score between 0 (no disability) and 100 (complete
disability). The WHODAS 2.0 has excellent
internal
consistency and test-retest reliability. In addition, face,
concurrent and construct validity of WHODAS 2.0 are
supported [82].

Body measures (height, weight) Height is measured
using a Harpenden stadiometer, consisting of a verti-
cal backboard with a weighted horizontal cursor fixed
to it at 90 degrees. A mechanical counter running on
track is placed on the head, after which the height
can be read from the analogue backboard. The stadi-
ometer technique has an excellent intra- and inter-
rater reliability [83].

Weight is measured using the scale technique, which
provides a quantative outcome (kilogram) of the amount
of weight in standing position. The client is instructed to
stand upright on a standard analogue scale ranging from
zero to approximately 150 kg. The analogue scale tech-
nique has an accuracy of ±0.45 kg [84].

Hair cortisol Hair cortisol provides a retrospective
long-term, month-by-month measure of systematic cor-
tisol exposure [41]. A hair sample will be collected by
cutting the most proximal one centimetre segment of
the vertex posterior of the head, thereby minimizing
intra-individual variations
in cortisol concentrations
[41]. Given that hair has an overall growth rate of 1 cm
per month, the most proximal one centimetre segment
to the scalp constitutes last month’s cortisol production.
The second most proximal segment to the scalp consti-
tutes the second to last month’s cortisol production and
so forth. After hair collection, the researcher administers
a questionnaire regarding certain hair characteristics (i.e.
natural hair color, bleaching, dying, perming and the use
of hair products and corticosteroids). Cortisol
levels
might be slightly influenced by hair treatment, but re-
main unaffected by the use of hair products, gender or
age [85]. Hair samples are marked with a subject num-
ber as described in section Declartions – Availability of
data and materials below, and are stored at room
temperature for future analysis of hair cortisol.

Fasting blood sample Fasting blood is collected at
Amstelland Hospital in Amstelveen and Meander Med-
ical Centre in Amersfoort, the Netherlands. Serum and
EDTA vacutainers with a volume of 6 ml (Becton, Dick-
inson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) are centrifuged
within one hour upon blood draw and divided into five
aliquots of 500 μl each. Serum and plasma samples are
labelled with the correct assessment and a unique
subject number as described in section Declartions –
Availability of data and materials below, and stored at
− 80 °C for future assays. A third vacutainer with a vol-
ume of 4 ml is sent to the department of clinical genetics
at the Amsterdam University Medical Center for DNA-
isolation. DNA is isolated within 5 days upon blood
draw, using a method based on magnetic beads with the
Chemagen chemagic MSM1 instrument
(Chemagen,
Baesweiler, Germany), which was replaced by the Qia-
symphony instrument (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) since
January 1st, 2019. DNA samples are stored at − 20 °C for
future epigenetic analyses.

Heart rate and blood pressure Heart rate and blood
pressure are reliable measures of sympathetic and para-
sympathetic autonomic nervous system functioning [86,
87]. Clients are instructed to sit still in a seated position,
during which resting heart rate and blood pressure are
measured using a digital upper arm sphygmomanometer
connected to the non-dominant arm.

Treatment compliance EMDR treatment compliance is
operationalized as completion of the treatment within a
maximum of 20 weeks. DBT treatment compliance is

operationalized as less than 25% missed group sessions,
including no-shows and cancelled appointments.

Therapist adherence In order to measure therapists’
adherence to the EMDR protocol, psychotherapists
videotape each treatment session. Out of all treatment
sessions, a total of 10% randomly chosen videotaped ses-
sions will be independently rated using the EMDR Fidel-
ity Scale [88]. The EMDR Fidelity Rating Scale (EFRS)
ranges from 0 (no adherence) to 3 (very good adher-
ence), with a cut-off score of 2 for acceptable fidelity.

To establish adherence to the DBT protocol, psycho-
therapists audio-record each individual treatment ses-
sions. Of all individual treatment sessions, a total of 10%
randomly chosen audio-recorded sessions will be inde-
pendently rated using the DBT Adherence Coding Scale
[89]. The DBT Adherence Coding Scale consists of 63
items, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 5. A
rating of 4 reflects good DBT adherence.

Interventions
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
The EMDR treatments are performed by certified EMDR
therapists who received accredited training. Therapists
receive biweekly face-to-face supervision with coequal
co-workers. The aim of the supervision is to review cases
and to discuss adherence to the treatment protocol, in
order to maintain quality and homogeneity of the inter-
vention. In addition, treatment progress is evaluated
within a weekly multidisciplinary consultation team.

A minimum of 12 and a maximum of 18 weekly
EMDR sessions are conducted. Each EMDR session has
a duration of 60 min. The entire treatment consists of
the eight phases described below.

During session 1 the focus lies on history taking and
case formulation. Trauma-related complaints are mapped
out and possible targets for EMDR are identified using the
LEC-5. The therapist explains the theoretical background
for EMDR and describes the actual steps in the process. In
consultation with the client, the therapist develops a treat-
ment plan for the following sessions.

During session 2 the traumatic memory is identified.
In case of multiple traumatic memories, the most dis-
tressing traumatic memory is selected as the target
memory. Next, a negative cognition (NC) about the self
that is associated with the target trauma and a replacing
positive cognition (PC) about the self is selected. The cli-
ent assesses the validity of the positive cognition on a
seven-point scale (Validity of Cognition (VoC) scale 1–
7). The client then reports the physical tension associ-
ated with the target event and scales the disturbance
level on an eleven-point scale (i.e. Subjective Units of
Disturbance (SUD) scale 0–10). Next, the desensitization
phase starts. The client is instructed to hold in focus a

Snoek et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:396 

Page 11 of 18

picture of the most disturbing traumatic event, along
with the associated negative self-perception and physical
tension. The client simultaneously engages in the pro-
cessing of a bilateral stimulus (BLS), consisting of rapid
hand movements. After each set of BLS, the client is
asked to comment on whatever comes to awareness.
When the client reports no distress related to the tar-
geted trauma memory (i.e. SUD equals zero) and when
the PC is experienced as being totally valid (i.e. VOC
equals 7), session 2 is completed. If the target memory
was not fully processed during this session (i.e. if SUD
does not equal 0), the therapist provides instructions
and techniques to the client that promote containment
and ensure safety until the next session. The client is
instructed to keep record of new sensations and/or expe-
riences, and to report these at the beginning of the next
session.

At the beginning of session 3 until the second to last
session, the SUD and the PC from the previous session
are revisited, reconfirmed and the validity of the PC is
scaled on the VoC again. Sets of BLS are applied until
the SUD equals zero and the PC is experienced as being
totally valid. Depending on the client’s reports, the ther-
apist chooses the next target memory and its associated
thoughts and sensations (i.e. NG, PC, VoC and SUD),
after which the desensitization phase is repeated as de-
scribed in session 2.

During the last session,

the therapist re-evaluates
whether treatment effects have maintained and checks if
there are still any target-related memories or sensations
that demand attention. The client is instructed to men-
tally scan his or her body to check whether there are still
any target-related sensations or tensions. If there are, the
therapist continues BLS until negative sensations subside
or until positive sensations are fully experienced. If the
SUD does not equal zero or if the VoC does not equal 7,
the cycle begins again at the desensitization phase as
described in session 2.

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive behav-
ioural therapy used to treat individuals with BPD. Its main
focus lies on teaching the client how to cope with dysregu-
lated emotions and how to improve interpersonal relation-
ships. For the current study, an additional objective of
DBT is to reduce BPD symptoms such that clients can
simultaneously receive EMDR treatment. All patients who
are randomised to integrated EMDR-DBT continue to
concurrently receive all modes of DBT (i.e. individual psy-
chotherapy, group skills training and phone coaching; fur-
ther described below) during their EMDR treatment.

DBT treatments are performed by certified DBT thera-
pists who have completed at least the three-day intro-
ductory training in DBT principles administered by

Dialexis (i.e. the training institute of the Dutch DBT as-
sociation, see https://www.dialexisadvies.nl/). To ensure
adherence to the DBT strategies, therapists will receive
biweekly supervision within a consultation group operat-
ing according to the DBT principles [90]. In addition,
there will be 3-h external supervision once in every three
months. In order to ensure treatment confidentiality, the
DBT therapist is never the same person as the EMDR
therapist.

DBT has an overall treatment length of 54 weeks. The
treatment starts with six weekly individual DBT sessions
of 45 min each. During this pre-treatment phase, the
therapist explains the theoretical background for DBT.
In consultation with the client, the therapist develops an
individualized treatment plan for the following sessions.
The client is prepared for group participation by de-
termining personalized treatment goals of which the
client keeps a daily record on so-called diary cards.
The diary cards provide a guideline for the individual
therapy and must
therefore be completed prior to
session. During the pre-treatment
each individual
phase, a crisis plan on how to deal with daily life cri-
ses is made as well.

After the pre-treatment phase, clients receive a com-
bination of individual psychotherapy and group skills
training. Individual DBT therapy sessions have a dur-
ation of 45 min each and take place every other week on
a day when there is no group session. As already men-
the client’s personal diary cards provide the
tioned,
guideline for the individual
therapy sessions. During
these sessions, behavioural skills that are learned during
the group sessions are adapted to the client’s personal
life. After the sixth group skills training session, the
weekly EMDR sessions commence.

The group skills training consists of 48 weekly group
sessions of 150 min each, including a 15-min break. Each
group consists of a maximum of 10 clients led by two
therapists. The group leader makes a video recording of
each session. There are four main types of skills that are
covered in the group skills
training. First of all,
mindfulness-related skills help the client focus on the
present and care for oneself in the moment. Secondly,
interpersonal effectiveness skills teach the client how to
obtain one’s needs while maintaining a healthy relation-
ship, how to be assertive in solving interpersonal prob-
lems and how to decrease social isolation. Thirdly, the
client is taught emotion regulation skills such as identi-
fying and labelling emotions,
inhibiting inappropriate
behaviour related to strong emotions, and increasing
positive emotions. Last of all, the distress tolerance mod-
ule includes crisis survival skills aimed at making healthy
decisions instead of destructive emotional decisions and
reality acceptance skills. Weekly homework is assigned

Snoek et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:396 

Page 12 of 18

in order to encourage generalization of skills taught dur-
ing the group sessions.

Lastly, the client can call his or her therapist outside
of the therapy to receive guidance with difficult at-the-
moment situations, referred to as ‘phone coaching’.
Phone coaching takes place when crisis behaviour has
not yet taken place, when there is a willingness to prac-
tice new skills and when there is a crisis. The purpose of
phone coaching is to reduce suicidal behaviour, to in-
crease generalization of skills and to reduce feelings of
conflict or alienation from the therapist.

Data analysis
The statistical analyses of the primary outcomes will
be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. All sig-
nificance levels will be set at 0.05, with two-sided hy-
pothesis testing. Pre-treatment group differences are
assessed using independent samples t tests for con-
tinuous data and χ2 test for categorical data. Missing
data will be replaced using methods such as multiple
imputations, assuming that the data will be missing at
random [91].

Treatment effects
A random intercepts and slopes multilevel model will be
used to examine the comparative efficacy of the EMDR-
DBT and EMDR-only treatment, in which the measure-
ment time points are nested within clients. At level 1 of
the model, the primary outcome measures (Yijb; scores
on the CAPS-5 and SCID-5-PD) vary within clients over
time (X1ijb) as a function of client-specific growth
curves. At level 2 of the multilevel model, the client-
specific change parameters vary randomly between cli-
ents as a function of the client’s treatment condition
(X2jb). The combination of the level 1 and level 2
models results in a mixed linear model with fixed and
random coefficients. Fixed coefficients include an inter-
cept (y00b; scores on primary outcome measures if time
and treatment condition are set to zero) and a linear or
quadratic slope (y10b; effect of time on primary outcome
measures). Quadratic slopes possibly fit the data better
than linear slopes, because treatment efficacy is generally
a curvilinear function of time (e.g. response to treatment
decreases over time). For each client, random coeffi-
cients are allocated to the client-level intercepts (U0jb;
client-specific deviations from group’s predicted inter-
cepts) and slopes (U1jb; client-specific deviations from
group’s predicted slopes). Lastly, the interaction between
time and treatment is modelled (y11b). A cAR(1) struc-
ture will be used to model
the residual covariance
matrix. Responders will be defined as clients with a
post-treatment score of at least a half standard deviation
below the pre-treatment score.

Level 1 :

Level 2 :

Yijb ¼ β0jb þ β1jb(cid:2)X1ijb þ εijb

β0jb ¼ γ00b þ γ01b(cid:2)X2jb þ U0jb
β1jb ¼ γ10b þ γ11b(cid:2)X2jb þ U1jb

The described random-effects multilevel model pro-
inferences for nested data
vides accurate statistical
within a hierarchical linear model (HLM) structure. By
including random intercepts and slopes, within-subject
correlations can be modelled, thereby minimizing the
chance of underestimating the model’s variance and
falsely rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. Type I error).

Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness
Both the integrated EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only will be
economically evaluated alongside the randomised trial
and will be performed according to the intention-to-
treat principle. We will take into account the CHEERS
statement [92] and the 2015 ISPOR good research prac-
tices task force report on cost-effectiveness analysis
alongside clinical trials [93]. In brief, cost-effectiveness
will be performed taking the societal perspective in the
base case scenario, in order to evaluate whether EMDR-
DBT is cost-effective compared to EMDR-only. Hence,
we will take in account at least the following costs: the
cost of offering EMDR-DBT or EMDR-only, costs of
other healthcare uptake besides EMDR(−DBT) and costs
of productivity losses due to absenteeism or presentee-
ism. Health care costs will be valued based on standard
Dutch cost prices (Zorginstituut [94]). Costs of product-
ivity losses will be based on the gender- and age-specific
labour costs. To facilitate comparison of our findings
with previous economic evaluations in psychiatric re-
search, healthcare costs will be assessed using the Tic-P,
treatment effects will be based on the CAPS-5, and
Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) will be calculated
using the area under the curve method, using the re-
sponses to the EQ-5D-5 L. The time horizon of the eco-
nomic evaluation will be 18 months post-randomisation.
Together, these measures will be re-calculated into in-
cremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as
the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in
mean effects of the two interventions [95]. Secondly,
cost-utility will be assessed in order to evaluate whether
in health-
EMDR-DBT leads to more improvement
related quality of life per euro spent than EMDR-only.
Health care costs and QALYs will be re-calculated to ob-
tain incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs), defined as
the difference in mean costs divided by the difference in
QALYs gained by the two interventions [96]. To esti-
mate stochastic uncertainty around the ICERs/ICURs,
the bootstrap approach will be used. Bootstrapped data
will also be used to plot cost effectiveness acceptability

Snoek et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2020) 20:396 

Page 13 of 18

curves. One-way sensitivity analyses and/or scenario
analyses will be performed to evaluate the robustness of
our findings against misspecifications of key cost drivers.

Prediction effects
It is hypothesized that individual treatment outcome will be
predicted by levels of hair cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF pro-
tein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF methylation status. The
predictive values of these variables will be investigated using
regression analyses with their mean change scores from
pre- to post-treatment and pre-treatment to follow-up as
the dependent variables and treatment condition as the in-
dependent variable (EMDR, EMDR-DBT). Responders will
be defined as clients with a post-treatment score of at least
a half standard deviation below the pre-treatment score.

Mediation effects
The effect of time on the primary outcome measures is ex-
pected to be partially mediated by pre- to post-treatment
changes in levels of hair cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein
levels and FKBP5 and BDNF methylation status. A
mediation analysis will be conducted to estimate direct (i.e.
Figure 3 - path c1) and indirect paths (i.e. Figure 3 - paths
a1, a2, a3, b1, b2 and b3) of casual influence from treat-
ment condition (EMDR, EMDR-DBT) to primary outcome
measures, through the proposed mediators. In order to cal-
culate the direct and indirect effects of this parallel multiple
mediation model, Model 4 in the PROCESS macro of

Hayes (2013) will be used. The independent variable will be
dummy-coded to include the EMDR-only condition (0)
and the EMDR-DBT condition (1). Change scores of the
mediators and the outcome variables will be used, in order
to preserve the expected within-between interaction. The
parallel multiple mediation model is shown graphically in
Fig. 4.

It is hypothesized that the regression of the CAPS-5
and SCID-5-PD scores on treatment condition (i.e.
EMDR, EMDR-DBT),
ignoring the mediators, will be
significant. Secondly, the regressions of the mediators
cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5
and BDNF methylation status on treatment condition
are hypothesized to be significant as well. In addition,
the regression of the CAPS-5 and SCID-5-PD scores on
the mediators are also expected to be significant. Lastly,
it is hypothesized that, when controlling for the media-
tors, treatment condition will significantly predict the
scores on the CAPS-5 and SCID-5-PD, supporting par-
tial mediation.

Discussion
The study described in this design paper constitutes the
first randomised controlled trial investigating the com-
parative clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of inte-
grated EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only in patients with
PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. It is hypothe-
sized that integrated EMDR-DBT will result in a higher

Fig. 4 Relationship between treatment condition (i.e. EMDR, EMDR-DBT) and primary outcome measures (i.e. post-treatment scores on the CAPS-
5 and SCID-5-PD), proposedly mediated by pre-to post-stressor changes in levels of cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF
methylation status. It is hypothesized that the regression of the primary outcome measures on treatment condition, ignoring the mediators, will
be significant (c1). Secondly, the regression of the mediators cortisol, FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF methylation status on
treatment condition are hypothesized to be significant as well (a1, a2 and a3 resp.). In addition, the regression of the primary outcome measures
on the mediators are also expected to be significant (b1, b2 and b3 resp.). Lastly, it is hypothesized that, when controlling for the mediators,
treatment condition will significantly predict the scores on the CAPS-5 and SCID-5-PD, supporting partial mediation

effect size and a higher response rate than EMDR-only.
Moreover, it is hypothesized that, although more expen-
sive, cost-effectiveness will be higher for integrated
EMDR-DBT than for EMDR-only treatment. The sec-
ondary objective of this study is to identify predictors
and mediators of the individual treatment response. It is
hypothesized that neurobiological variables (hair cortisol,
FKBP5 and BDNF protein levels and FKBP5 and BDNF
methylation status) predict and mediate the individual
response to treatment in adults with PTSD and comor-
bid (sub)clinical BPD.

This study has several strengths, including being the
first to investigate the comparative efficacy of integrated
EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and
comorbid (sub)clinical BPD. The inclusion of candidate
predictors and mediators of the response to treatment,
which constitute a necessary prelude to optimizing and
individualizing treatment, further increases the clinical
meaningfulness of the results. Results will reveal which
treatment works best
for which individual patient,
thereby guiding and optimizing treatment choices while
minimizing exclusion and dropout rates. For instance,
treatment type and duration could be specified by the
biological layout of the patient in question. Moreover,
scientific rigor is emphasized through the use of a ran-
domized design, a large sample with adequate statistical
power to detect clinically meaningful effects, validated
outcome measures in both psychological and physio-
logical domains and a follow-up assessment. Last of all,
findings will most likely generalize to other patients with
PTSD and comorbid (sub)clinical BPD, as this study is
conducted in a common clinical setting at two study
sites with a relatively heterogeneous patient population
in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and type of trauma.

While the strengths of this study design are encour-
aging, findings should be interpreted in the light of certain
limitations. The first limitation of the present study is the
lack of a non-active control group, such as a waiting-list
group. The presence of a non-active control group would
allow for the assessment of non-specific factors that might
influence the dependent variables, such as the passage of
time. After all, the hypothesized improvements in PTSD
and (sub)clinical BPD could be caused by the passage of
time rather than by the interventions. However, the fact
that both EMDR and DBT constitute widely used,
evidence-based interventions for PTSD and BPD does not
support this view. Moreover, according to Paragraph 29 of
the Declaration of Helsinki, it would be unethical to with-
hold evidence-based therapies from patients: “The benefits,
risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be
tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diag-
nostic, and therapeutic methods. The World Medical Asso-
ciation hereby reaffirms its position that extreme care must
be taken in making use of a placebo-controlled trial and
that in general this methodology should only be used in the
absence of existing proven therapy” [97]. For these reasons,
it was decided not to include a waiting-list group in the
current study. A second limitation could be the consider-
ably shorter treatment duration of EMDR-only as com-
pared to the integrated EMDR-DBT. Given that the EMDR
treatment is more than twice as short as the integrated
EMDR-DBT, recovery might be faster in the short-term
EMDR condition than in the long-term EMDR-DBT condi-
tion. However, taking into account the whole follow-up
period, the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
long-term EMDR-DBT could still be greater compared to
the short-term EMDR treatment, hence the inclusion of a
long-term follow up assessment [98, 99]. Last of all, given

the clinical nature of the study, blinding of clients and ther-
apists to treatment condition is not possible. Therefore,
blinding is partly maintained by ensuring that clients are
blinded to research hypotheses and by ensuring that the re-
search assistants who perform the measurements are
masked to the client’s treatment condition. The current
randomized controlled design therefore constitutes the
most rigorous and conservative test of the effects of inte-
grated EMDR-DBT and EMDR-only.

In sum, this is the first study comparing the clinical ef-
ficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated EMDR-DBT
and EMDR-only in patients with PTSD and comorbid
(sub)clinical BPD, while simultaneously identifying indi-
vidual predictors and mediators of the treatment re-
sponse. Results will reveal which treatment works best
for this group of patients and will aid in guiding individ-
ual treatment choices, thereby personalizing psychiatry.

Funding
This study is funded by Stichting Steunfonds Joodse Geestelijke
Gezondheidszorg. The funders had no role in study design, preparation of
the manuscript and decision to publish, and will have no role in further
execution of the study, analyses or decision to publish the study results.

Availability of data and materials
The investigator ensures that the client’s anonymity is maintained by assigning
a personal identification code to each client, starting with 45 (year of liberation
after World War II) followed by number 001, resulting in numbers 45001, 45002
etcetera. Blood and hair samples at T0 are also identified with a personal
identification code, starting with a ‘B’ for the blood sample and an ‘H’ for the
hair sample. Personal identification codes at T2 match the T0 codes and start
with ‘T2’. All documents will be identified by this identification code, not by
client’s names or clinical number. The identification codes are matched with
client’s names on a Subject Identification Code List, which the investigator will
keep in confidence. Personal data will be kept separately from the experimental
data acquired. Study outcomes will be reported anonymously. Handling of
personal data will comply with the Dutch Personal Data Protection Act. After
cessation of the whole study the investigator will maintain study records for 15
years after final publication.

Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study will be performed according to the declaration of Helsinki (64th WMA
general assembly; October 2013) and the International Conference on
Harmonisation – Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP). The study protocol has been
approved by the medical ethics committee (METC – case number A2018.428
(2017.335), version 7) was informed about the start of the study and will be
informed about any amendments. A summary of the study progress will be
submitted once a year to the accredited Ethical Review Board (ERB), including the
date of inclusion of the first client, the number of clients included, serious adverse

events, other problems, and amendments. The investigator will notify the
accredited ERB of the end of the study within a period of 90 days. The end of the
study is defined as the last patient’s visit. The investigator will notify the accredited
METC immediately in case of temporary or prematurely halt of the study,
including the reason of such an action. In order to evaluate whether the study is
performed in compliance with the quality standards of the Good Clinical Practise
guidelines, an independent researcher may conduct audits of all aspects of this
study either during the study or after the study has been completed.
Informed consent is obtained before any study-specific procedures take place.
After explanation of the aims, methods, benefits and potential hazards of the
study, the investigator obtains written informed consent from each client par-
ticipating in the study. It is made completely and unambiguously clear to each
client that they are free to refuse to participate in the study, or that they can
withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason, without incurring any
penalty or withholding of treatment on the part of the investigator. Only clients
who are able to give legal consent will be entered into the study. Signed in-
formed consents are kept on file by the investigator, and are documented in a
database management system (i.e. Microsoft Access).

Consent for publication
Study results will be published in accordance to the CCMO statement on
publication policy. Results will therefore be published in international
scientific peer-reviewed journals only.
