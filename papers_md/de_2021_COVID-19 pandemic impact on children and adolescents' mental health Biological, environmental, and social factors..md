1. Introduction 

Since  the  Coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic,  caused  by  Severe  Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was announced, we had an unprecedented change in the way we organize ourselves 
socially and in our daily routine. Children and adolescents were also greatly impacted by the abrupt withdrawal 
from school, social life and outdoor activities. Some of them also experienced domestic violence growing. The 
stress they are subjected to directly impacts their mental health on account of increased anxiety, changes in their 
diets and in school dynamics, fear or even failing to scale the problem. Our aim is to bring up a discussion under 
different aspects and to alert public health and government agents about the need for surveillance and care of 
these individuals. We hope that the damage to their mental health as a result of the side effect of this pandemic 
can be mitigated by adequate and timely intervention.   

The world has been changing at a dizzying speed since Severe Acute 
Respiratory  Syndrome  Coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2),  the  virus  that 
causes coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID-19), promoted a  drastic and 
sudden change in the way we organize ourselves as social human beings. 
In  March  2020,  WHO  declared  that  COVID-19  reached  a  pandemic 
status, putting the planet in a state of maximum alert and grew to di-
mensions that still cannot be measured today (World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO), 2020a). 

The literature has pointed out that older individuals are more sus-
ceptible to develop COVID-19, and those with major comorbidities such 
as diabetes, hypertension and obesity can be more affected and could 
potentially be at higher risk for severe illness and death (Shahid et al., 
2020). Although children apparently present a lower risk of developing 
the  severe  form  of  the  disease  as  well  as  less  hospital  care  and  me-
chanical  ventilation,  they  can  develop  a  multisystemic  inflammatory 
syndrome (Jones et al., 2020; Harahsheh et al., 2020; She et al., 2020). 
Recently, some studies have pointed out that some children and ado-
lescents infected with the newly discovered coronavirus developed skin

lesions  and  a  picture  of  Kawasaki  syndrome.  This  unusual  syndrome, 
initially identified in Japan (1967), is a vasculitis caused by a hyper-
inflammatory state (Jones et al., 2020; Harahsheh et al., 2020; She et al., 
2020). 

Although youngsters appear to be less vulnerable to COVID-19, the 
side effects of the pandemic can be devastating. Children and adoles-
cents may be highly exposed to biopsychosocial stressors generated by 
the pandemic and once population’s containment measures to reduce 
virus  spread  are  required,  they  could  be  potentially  affected  by  the 
disruption in daily life routine as a result of social isolation and their 
unseasoned  ability  to  conceive  and  comprehend  the  short-  and  long- 
term  consequences  of  this  outbreak  (Spinelli  et  al.,  2020;  Crescentini 
et al., 2020). 

Commonly, although children and adolescents have experienced a 
drastic routine disruption due to the closure of schools and the absence 
of outdoor activities, they may not be completely isolated. In most cases, 
parents are at home. In this case, some youngsters may not necessarily 
experience an evident feeling of loneliness, as they may compensate for 
this  by  spending  more  time  with  their  family  members  and  also 
increasing  time  spent  with  social  media  and  the  internet  (Guessoum 
et al., 2020; Keles et al., 2020). However, this situation also brings up 
some  concerns.  It  was  already  observed  that  children  with  parents 
diagnosed  with  some  psychiatric  disturbance  are  more  susceptible  to 
developing psychopathologies (Maciejewski et al., 2018). In the context 
of  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic,  most  parents  had  to  reorganize 
their lives to deal with working at home in addition to children’s man-
agement.  As  a  result,  this  sudden  overload  has  been  putting  parents 
under extra stressful conditions, potentially increasing the risk of chil-
dren face emotional and behavioral problems (Crescentini et al., 2020). 
This  particular  moment  we  are  facing  is  an  unprecedented  global 
situation with numerous idiosyncratic factors. People are being affected 
in  multifaceted  ways,  having  their  physical,  psychological  and 
emotional  well-being  compromised,  along  with  social  and  economic 
problems (Esterwood and Saeed, 2020). The heterogeneity and plurality 
of  biopsychosocial  stressors  bring  a  multifactorial  approach  to  the 
COVID-19 pandemic, which leads to unpredictable consequences on the 
mental  health  of  vulnerable  populations  such  as  children  and 
adolescents. 

Recently, a study has evaluated 1036 quarantined children and ad-
olescents in China in an age range from 6 up to 15 years, of which 112, 
196, and 68 presented depression, anxiety, and both, respectively (Chen 
et  al.,  2020).  Another  study  demonstrated  a  high  prevalence  of  psy-
chological distress in quarantined children and adolescents due to the 
COVID-19  pandemic  in  India.  These  individuals  have  experienced 
helplessness (66.11%), worry (68.59%) and fear (61.98%), compared to 
non-quarantined children (Saurabh and Ranjan, 2020). Moreover, it was 
also reported in China that children and adolescents aged 3–18 years 
presented  symptoms  of  inattention,  clinging,  worry  and  irritability 
during this pandemic (Jiao et al., 2020). 

Accordingly,  in  light  of  a  large  body  of  literature  that  unveiled 
several mechanisms behind the potential harms on brain development 
and/or  behavioral  outcomes  result  from  different  stressors  during 
childhood and adolescence, we proposed herein a reflexive discussion 
addressing the following issues: (i) Stress and neuroinflammation; (ii) 
Social  isolation  and  diet;  (iii)  Brain  plasticity:  social  behavior;  social 
inequalities, neglect and distress; playing and nature environment; and 
(iv) Public health and support, to shed light on points that should be 
considered by governments and health authorities to start a follow-up on 
the young population. It is the nature of human beings to be social and, 
despite  the  need  for  these  restraint  measures,  it  should  be  of  great 
concern  how  this  pandemic  period  can  affect  the  young  brain  that  is 
under development and it is more susceptible to stressors. Therefore, the 
search for strategies to mitigate a harmful long-term impact on it should 
be sought. These points will bring us information and guide us, in the 
future, if we have to face another situation like this COVID-19 pandemic. 

2. Stress and neuroinflammation 

Stress is usually approached under medical or biological aspects. It 
causes  physiological  damages  or  psychological  disturbances  to  an  or-
ganism and is generated by external or internal adverse stimuli (Gunnar 
and  Quevedo,  2007).  The  adequate  body  response  to  stress  helps  to 
preserve  and  achieve  an  allostasis  condition  (Gunnar  and  Quevedo, 
2007). However, uncontrolled or chronic responses to stress may have 
health  harmful  effects.  There  is  already  evidence  of  the  multiple  and 
negative psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on children and 
adolescents quarantined populations (social isolation stressors) (Gunnar 
and  Quevedo,  2007;  Chen  et  al.,  2020;  Saurabh  and  Ranjan,  2020; 
Fegert  et  al.,  2020),  turning  these  individuals  more  susceptible  to 
develop  long-term  psychiatric  disorders.  Although  it  is  still  under 
speculation the extent of the damages caused by the stressors of COVID- 
19  pandemic, 
that  dysregulated 
neuroendocrine-immune  interactions  can be behind  psychiatric mani-
festations observed in quarantined people (Raony et al., 2020). 

recently  proposed 

it  was 

Under  normal  acute  stress  stimuli,  the  hypothalamic-pituitary- 
adrenal (HPA) axis activation leads to a release of glucocorticoids (e.g. 
cortisol) on the bloodstream that regulates the levels of pro- and anti- 
inflammatory molecules, which, in turn, also controls the secretion of 
these hormones by the HPA pathway, a mechanism of negative feedback 
that  prevents  an  exacerbated  inflammatory  response  (Del  Rey  and 
Besedovsky,  2017;  H¨ansel  et  al.,  2010).  However,  persistent  and 
enhanced stressful events during early life (childhood and adolescence) 
can  drive  responses  by  the  immune,  endocrine  and  nervous  systems 
mainly  through  a  dysfunction  of  the  HPA  axis  (Dahmen  et  al.,  2018; 
Juruena et al., 2020) and alterations on inflammatory mediators levels 
in the brain (Brenhouse and Schwarz, 2016), and/or systemically (Jiang 
et  al.,  2018),  predisposing  these  individuals  to  psychopathological 
conditions  in  adulthood  (e.g.  anxiety  and  depression).  Moreover,  the 
stress can be one of the possible triggers for neuroinflammation, a term 
used to designate an imbalance or exacerbation of the immune signaling 
in the brain (Jiang et al., 2018) that can lead to several disorders (e.g. 
aggressive, psychosis, depression, and anxiety disorders) (Calcia et al., 
2016; Ibi et al., 2008; Veenema, 2009). 

During infancy, early childhood or even in adolescence, the central 
nervous  system  (CNS)  is  in  a  vulnerable  developmental  window,  in 
which the occurrence of any stressful challenges at the time of critical 
periods  can  trigger  short-  and  long-term  physiological  (Danese  et  al., 
2009; Gunnar and Quevedo, 2007), cognitive and behavioral damages 
(Danese  et  al.,  2009; Ibi  et  al., 2008; Nugent  et  al.,  2011). The main 
brain  regions  that  respond  to  environmental  stimuli  (e.g.  stress)  are 
amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The response occurs via 
an  intricate  network  of  hormonal,  immune  and  neurotransmitter  re-
sponses, which can, in turn, change the response patterns of glial cells 
and  monoamines  metabolism,  leading  to  cell  death  and/or  mental 
health disturbances (Calcia et al., 2016; Danese et al., 2009). 

Longitudinal  studies  have  significantly  correlated  the  presence  of 
psychosocial  stressors  such  as  social  isolation  during  childhood  and 
adolescence  with  high  levels  of  C-reactive  protein  (an  inflammatory 
biomarker) later in life (Danese et al., 2009; Lacey et al., 2014). More-
over, Danese et al. (2009) also positively associated social isolation in 
childhood  as  a  risk  factor  for  depression  in  adult  life  (Danese  et  al., 
2009). Since dysfunctional systemic inflammation has been extensively 
demonstrated to impair the neurodevelopmental processes and lead to 
cognitive and mood disturbances (Jiang et al., 2018), it seems reason-
able that inflammatory alterations in children exposed to the harmful 
effects of COVID-19 outbreak could lead to long-term physiological and 
psychological damages and should be a public health concern. 

Another important concern comes from the impact of fear in children 
and adolescents. A recent study reported a high prevalence of fear in 
quarantined  children  and  adolescents  during  COVID-19  pandemic,  a 
feeling that was mainly associated  with financial worries or concerns 
regarding  being  exposed  to  COVID-19  or  having  infected  others 

ProgressinNeuropsychopharmacology&BiologicalPsychiatry106(2021)1101712C.S. de Figueiredo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

(Saurabh  and  Ranjan,  2020).  Moreover,  it  is  not  surprising  that 
adolescence represents a stress-sensitive developmental window relative 
to fear regulation (Tottenham and Galvan, 2016). Indeed, there is evi-
dence  showing  chronic  stress  have  a  great  impact  on  amygdala- 
prefrontal cortex connectivity and activity, impairing, for instance, the 
extinction of fear memory (Tottenham and Galvan, 2016). These ques-
tions claim for further studies addressing the harmful fear effects on the 
developing brain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

3. Social isolation and diet: From animals to humans 

The chronic  stress  caused by  social isolation conditions  in mice  is 
also associated with an increased motivation to consume palatable foods 
(Sumis et al., 2016). In this context, studies using animal models suggest 
that intake of caloric foods can act as “comfort food” and would be an 
alternative  to  alleviate  the  negative  effects  of  stress  (Pecoraro  et  al., 
2004; Ulrich-Lai et al., 2010). Chronic high-fat diet, induced by social 
isolation stress, reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in ani-
mal models (Ulrich-Lai et al., 2010; Finger et al., 2011) and in humans 
(Tomiyama  et  al.,  2011).  Moreover,  it  was  rescued  the  memory 
impairment  on  the  object  recognition  test  as  well  as  the  changes  in 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels caused by social isolation con-
ditions in rats (Arcego et al., 2016; Cavaliere et al., 2019). 

Social isolation stress can induce an increased food intake and weight 
gain both in animal models (Krolow et al., 2013) and in humans (Mengin 
et al., 2020), and can be associated with increased hypothalamic pro-
duction of neuropeptide Y (Kuo et al., 2007). Indeed, neuropeptide Y is 
involved with appetite control and insulin resistance in the brain (Kuo 
et  al.,  2007).  Accordingly,  the  relationship  between  a  stressful  envi-
ronment and the consequent increase in the search for such types of food 
early in life may be one of the reasons for an increase in obesity among 
children and young people (Ogden et al., 2016). In addition to obesity, 
access to both high-fat diets during development and social isolation can 
lead to structural synaptic changes (Cavaliere et al., 2019), impacting 
cognitive processes in adult life such as learning and memory in rodents 
(Granholm  et  al.,  2008;  Valladolid-Acebes  et  al.,  2011)  as  well  as  in 
humans (Francis and Stevenson, 2011). 

Furthermore, it has been shown that a short period of social isolation 
during adolescence is able to induce long-term effects on dopaminergic 
pathways in rats (Lampert et al., 2017). However, a high-fat diet has 
controversial  results  on  the  dopaminergic  pathways  due,  in  part,  to 
different dietary lipid compositions. While administering a high- fat diet 
composed of saturated fatty acids leads to perturbations in mesolimbic 
dopaminergic signaling, a diet composed of unsaturated fatty acid does 
not (Barnes et al., 2020; Hryhorczuk et al., 2016). 

A possible relationship between social isolation stress during child-
hood and access to high-fat diets may involve the activation of the HPA 
axis. In this sense, the leptin released by this type of diet can reduce the 
activation of the HPA axis (Bonnavion et al., 2015) and inhibit the hy-
pothalamic neuropeptide Y synthesis and release (Stephens et al., 1995) 
triggered by stress, minimizing the effects of social isolation. However, 
the way, the duration and the localization in the brain of the effects of 
how  caloric  food  intake  acts  to  counteract  stress  effects  in  the  brain 
deserve further investigation. In addition, the intake of highly caloric 
foods and the exposure to a social stressor can also affect the composi-
tion of the intestinal microbiota (Galley et al., 2014; Deshpande et al., 
2019) leading to changes in the brain, since metabolic products of the 
intestinal  microbiota  can  influence  brain  functions  (and  vice  versa) 
during development and adult life (Valles-Colomer et al., 2019). 

Evidently, we must be careful when extrapolating data from animal 
models  to  human  conditions,  since  protocols  of  social  isolation  stress 
with animals mismatch the circumstances produced by the COVID-19 
lockdown.  Yet, studies  with  animal  models  are  useful  when  trying  to 
understand certain molecular mechanisms behind the observed behav-
ioral  changes  in  humans.  In  addition,  we  want  to  highlight  that  the 
nutritional status during neurodevelopment is critical to children and 

adolescents’  proper  development.  It  is  also  important  to  adequate 
nutrition and to enhance the immune system in order to provide effec-
tive  protection  against  possible  diseases,  including  COVID-19,  and  to 
guarantee  the  rapid  recovery  from  the  disease.  As  social  isolation  is 
capable of changing our relationship with food, the importance of social 
ties for  an adequate diet  becomes more evident  during this period of 
quarantine. 

4. Brain plasticity 

4.1. Social behavior 

Humans are inherently social and since early in development they 
have the ability to become apt cooperators with a strong motivation to 
communicate  with  other  individuals  (Tomasello,  2014;  Boyd  and 
Richerson,  2009).  Evolutionarily,  the  formation  of  social  bonds  was 
fundamental  to  both  human  survival  and  to  guarantee  a  healthy 
cognitive, emotional, endocrine and immune development (Ertel et al., 
2008; Miyazaki et al., 2005). In fact, staying close to significant others is 
essential to create and maintain social bonds in humans (Dunbar, 2010). 
In  normal  circumstances  (i.e.  in  the  absence  of  threats),  spatial 
distancing is unnatural for us. This is more pronounced during threat-
ening  contexts,  like  this  COVID-19  pandemic,  where  our  affiliative 
tendencies and the desire to seek physical contact become even stronger 
(Mawson, 2017). In the same vein, a recent paper showed that people 
can crave social cues just like they crave food (Tomova et al., 2020). 

From this perspective, the adolescence period is considered a time of 
deep learning about the social environment when several key aspects of 
social  cognition  continue  to  develop,  including  the  comprehension of 
other people’s emotions, intentions, and beliefs (Blakemore and Mills, 
2014; Blakemore, 2008). It is a time of psychosocial changes between 
childhood and adulthood, and a period of heightened sensitivity to so-
cial  contexts  during  which  adolescents  spend  more  time  with  peers 
(Larson and Richards, 1991; Blakemore and Mills, 2014; Burnett et al., 
2011; Blakemore, 2008). In fact, for most teenagers, school is one of the 
most important social environments and one in which peers increasingly 
affect adolescents’  self-concept, well-being and behavior (Gorrese and 
Ruggieri, 2013; O’Brien and Bierman, 1988). 

Unfortunately, many adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic are 
unable to attend schools which culminated in limited interaction with 
peers, imposing a gap on their social network (Spinelli et al., 2020) that 
has  been  tentatively  supplied  by  virtual  interaction.  It  was  shown  by 
Crone  and  Konijn  (2018)  that  the  use  of  social  media  by  adolescents 
builds not only the connection among peers, but also their brain con-
nectivity.  However,  a  recent  study  showed  that  school  routines  are 
important coping mechanisms specifically for young people with mental 
health  issues  (Lee,  2020).  Furthermore,  it  was  shown  that  periods 
without  school  are  also  associated  with  decreased  physical  activity; 
increased screen time, irregular sleep patterns, and less appropriate diets 
in children and adolescents (Wang et al., 2020). 

The  social  touch  is  essential  to  develop  cognition,  emotions, 
attachment and relationships (Cascio et al., 2019). In addition, it also 
contributes  to  the  physiological regulation  of  the  body’s responses  to 
acute  stressors  as  well  as  other  short-term  challenges.  Gallace  and 
Spence (2010) reviewed the importance of the social touch to human 
development under different aspects. It was discussed that, even when 
virtual relationships are established, they cannot cater to physical needs 
which are essential to improvement of interpersonal connections that 
contribute  to  the  global  development  of  the  individual  (Gallace  and 
Spence, 2010). In the  context of quarantine, the questions  to the dis-
cussion we bring here are if this “virtual contact” will be enough to social 
behavior constructions and if it will change the course of brain devel-
opment. Could social isolation stress and adversities that were installed 
during the pandemic result in a poor relational experience and affect the 
brains under development? What will be the effects of this long-term 
switch to “virtual contact” on human interactions? It is also important 

ProgressinNeuropsychopharmacology&BiologicalPsychiatry106(2021)1101713C.S. de Figueiredo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

to highlight that the impact of COVID-19 is not uniform across adoles-
cents, considering families with medium to high-income resources being 
able  to  provide  adolescents  with  additional  opportunities  to  interact 
with peers through technology, while other families cannot. 

In  addition,  it  should  be considered  that adolescence  is  also char-
acterized by multiple biological changes that include a cascade of hor-
monal and physical changes, leading to a substantial development of the 
brain, burst of activity dynamically strengthening and weakening con-
nections among key brain regions in response to environmental input 
(Galvan,  2014).  Therefore,  the  developmental  transition  between 
childhood and adulthood brains circuits involves maturation in frontal 
cortical neural systems and in social and affective circuitry that occurs in 
response to social experiences (e.g. relationships and interactions that a 
person experiences with others, including that from the same age), so-
cioeconomic  status  and  culture  (Crone  and  Dahl,  2012;  Foulkes  and 
Blakemore, 2018). 

However,  this  benefit  of  increased  plasticity  also  renders  vulnera-
bility to stressors and to mental health issues. In fact, adolescence is the 
peak  age  of  onset  for  the  most  common  psychiatric  disorder  such  as 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  anxiety,  mood  and 
schizophrenia (Kessler et al., 2005), and it is also a time of high risk for 
substance abuse and suicidal behavior. The peak onset of mental illness 
during the teenage years could be explained by the surges of sex hor-
mones and neurobiological changes that target specific brain regions as 
well as cell populations (Casey et al., 2005). During development, the 
CNS  undergoes  an  intense  process  of  formation  and  maintenance  of 
synaptic connections until adulthood. Environmental factors constantly 
act in this process, influencing the formation of individual cognitive and 
emotional aspects (Burggren and Mueller, 2015; Knudsen, 2004; Take-
sian and Hensch, 2013; Vickers, 2014). 

The pandemic situation that we have plunged into showed multiples 
outspread on the individual’s mental health. However, how will it affect 
adolescents’ brains in adulthood, especially those key regions associated 
with action-emotion regulation (e.g. impulsive behavior), empathy, and 
decision-making skills? In pandemic times, there is a pressing need to 
mitigate the impact the young population is subjected to, particularly 
the more vulnerable ones who suffer from social inequalities in which 
families with low income cannot face education, remote learning and 
virtual contact with peers and family members. 

4.2. Social inequalities, neglect and distress 

The pandemic has been widening and exposing the social inequality 
in every country affected by the economic shutdown, especially in un-
derdeveloped countries. Social isolation also brought elevated levels of 
domestic  violence,  including  childhood  maltreatment  or  neglect  as  a 
result  of  parenthood  insecurities  and  inabilities  (Fegert  et  al.,  2020). 
Parenting during the pandemic is an additional challenge to deal with 
remote  learning,  home  office  working,  and  endless  house  chores 
(Spinelli  et  al.,  2020).  Children  at  home  represent  high  costs  from 
feeding to internet access. Moreover, the internet often has to be shared 
with all family members. To those who live in a low-income situation or 
a crowded house, this is even harder to manage. Adding to this scenario, 
children who have special needs, those who have had a previous COVID- 
19  diagnosis,  or  were  already  under  treatment  for  any  condition  are 
more vulnerable (Fegert et al., 2020). 

During childhood, adverse experiences  such as  trauma can induce 
long-term impacts on brain development as well as promote mental and 
behavioral  disturbances  through  neurochemical  and  physiological 
imbalance  related  to  neuroimmunoendocrine  regulatory  mechanisms 
(De Bellis and Zisk, 2014). Copeland et al. (2018) followed children of 
different age groups for 22 years and pointed out that the outcome of 
trauma  during  childhood  results  in  much  more  than  a  mental  health 
issue and it became a public health issue. Moreover, it was shown by 
Copeland  et  al. (2018)  that childhood trauma can trigger mental dis-
orders, including addiction in adulthood. Therefore, it is necessary to 

look at this subject very carefully, in the way people is managing the 
COVID-19  pandemic  stress.  We  need  to  guarantee  that  children  and 
adolescents, as well as their families, receive the proper psychological 
help  to  support  their  mental  health.  If  an  emotional  neglect  already 
exists,  this  will  most  likely  be  intensified  by  the  work  overload  that 
parents  and/or  caregivers  are  subjected  to,  as  well  as  by  social  in-
equalities, that may be related to the economic crash and the employ-
ment discharges around the world. The sum of the trauma effects can be 
devastating, and the damage might not be detected only in a few years 
after-pandemic. 

4.3. Playing and nature environment 

In  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  a  growing  number  of  works 
demonstrating that a direct contact with nature is associated with great 
health  benefits  (McCurdy  et  al.,  2010).  Among  the  suggested  mecha-
nisms by which stimuli from nature can impact on individual well-being 
and mental health include regulation of blood pressure, regulation of the 
immune system, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines after walks in 
a  forest  (outside  urbanized  areas),  regulation  of  autonomous  activity 
(through the reduction of sympathetic activity opposed to an increase in 
the  parasympathetic  activity),  and  a  deep  feeling  of  relaxation  and 
concentration (for review see Kuo, 2015). 

Nature  exposure  can  also  reduce  stress  during  early  childhood  in 
comparison to the ones that did not have much access to similar outside 
stimuli (Wells and Evans, 2003). Children highly exposed to nature also 
present  great  health  and  physical  development  (development  and 
refinement  of  locomotor  skills,  for  example),  improved  self-control 
(reduces  inappropriate  in-class  behaviors),  better  communication  and 
social development (more complex language), besides proper cognitive 
development (multi-sensorial stimuli that raise curiosity and creativity) 
(Kemple et al., 2016). 

Sunlight  exposures  have  also  positive  effects  on  human  health 
(Alfredsson  et  al.,  2020).  Suitable  sunlight  exposure  is  essential  for 
vitamin D synthesis, which is involved in several physiological functions 
(F¨ocker et al., 2017). However, insufficient sunlight exposure along with 
a low status of vitamin D may be responsible for critical public health 
issues  and  neuropsychiatric  disturbances  such  as  cardiovascular  dis-
eases,  metabolic  syndrome,  hypertension,  multiple  sclerosis,  asthma, 
type  1  diabetes,  autism,  Alzheimer’s  disease,  schizophrenia  and 
depression  (Alfredsson  et  al.,  2020;  Brouwer-Brolsma  et  al.,  2013; 
F¨ocker et al., 2017; Humble et al., 2010; Itzhaky et al., 2012). Accord-
ingly, it was demonstrated that adults with depression exposed to low 
sunlight showed a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels, a pro- 
inflammatory cytokine, when compared to adults with depression who 
were exposed to high sunlight (Levandovski et al., 2013), which sup-
ports  the  well  described  benefits  of  proper  sunlight  exposition 
(Alfredsson et al., 2020). Also, there was already observed that increased 
serum  levels  of  IL-6  during  childhood  have  been  associated  with  a 
greater risk of developing depression and psychosis in young adulthood 
(Khandaker et al., 2014). Therefore, we can comprehend the importance 
of appropriate sunlight exposure, mainly during childhood, regarding 
mental health conditions since this prolonged lockdown period may be 
potentially limiting youngsters to have a proper sunlight exposition. 

Unfortunately,  because  of  quarantine,  children  are  not  allowed  to 
play in outdoor areas and explore unstructured play. This means that we 
are switching from the “play-outside mode” to the “play-indoor mode”, 
which includes spending more time on the screen. The negative impact 
of  media  and  technology  use  was  analyzed  in  children  (aged  4–8), 
preteens  (9–12),  and  teenagers  (13–18).  It  seems  that  increasing  the 
screen  time  use  correlates  positively  with  unhealthy  eating,  lack  of 
physical exercise, more total ill-being as well as attention and physical 
problems (Rosen et al., 2014). A meta-analysis review showed a nega-
tive correlation between the amount of screen use and language devel-
opment  in  younger  children.  However,  if  exposed  to  better  quality 
content with an educational bias, the use of screens can be beneficial for 

ProgressinNeuropsychopharmacology&BiologicalPsychiatry106(2021)1101714C.S. de Figueiredo et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

children’s language in an age-dependent manner (Madigan et al., 2020). 
It is undeniable that we might have prejudice on their development, 
including on their mental health, but the results from this switch on our 
modi operandi will be known in years, not now. A follow up from these 
children will determine if we had or not an impact on brain organization 
and changes in social behavior as a consequence of the pandemic. 

5. Public health and support 

In  face  of  this  pandemic  scenario,  children  and  adolescents  are 
exposed to stressful situations such as fear of contracting the disease, 
frustration, boredom, information overload, family financial loss, and 
drastic changes in daily activity patterns, which make clear the multi-
faceted  threats  of  COVID-19  (Brooks  et  al.,  2020).  All  these  issues 
collaborate for future unpredictable damages that could impact not only 
the  own  children’s  health,  but  also  the  health  systems.  For  instance, 
Sprang and Silman (2013) showed a higher incidence of post-traumatic 
stress disorder symptoms in quarantined children than those who were 
not quarantined (Sprang and Silman, 2013), evidencing just one aspect 
of how a pandemic situation may impact on a vulnerable population. 

The government and public health authorities need to consider the 
impact of this unusual situation on children and adolescents by imple-
menting  mitigating  measures  and  making  investments  available  to 
reduce  the  damages.  Notwithstanding  this,  as  the  impact  on  the  in-
dividual’s health is multifactorial, the launched resources and efforts to 
mitigate  these  damages  must  include  health  authorities,  government, 
communities,  organizations,  schools,  and  family  members.  Some  re-
sources currently discussed in the literature address (i) making available 
a proper online environment for students to develop scholar activities (e. 
g. create suitable online platforms), (ii) providing motivational videos 
which  can  help  to  improve  the  daily  lifestyle  (e.g.  how  to  have  a 
balanced diet, practice exercises at home, and regulate the sleep), (iii) 
providing  access  to  adequate  information  (e.g.  how  to  adopt  correct 
hygiene  practices)  and  (iv)  providing  access  to  psychological  profes-
sional support (Wang et al., 2020; Brooks et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). 
Furthermore,  social  support  is  widely  understood  as  the  presence  of 
positive relationships that create a feeling of belonging, stimulate trust, 
and encourage self-care (Uchino, 2004). In this case, despite the external 
essential  support,  the  internal support  in  the family context  is  funda-
mental.  Parenting  has  been  often  described  as  the  best  resource  to 
reduce adverse impacts on children’s social-emotional and behavioral 
development  (Perrin  et  al.,  2016).  In  these  circumstances,  whenever 
parents  are  able  to  stay  close,  to  care,  to  love,  to  play,  and  to  have 
conversations with their children, it is easier to perceive indicators of 
psychological  issues  and,  then,  interfere  appropriately  (Wang  et  al., 
2020; World Health Organization (WHO), 2020b). On the other hand, 
and complementarily, parents should be able to receive psychological, 
financial and logistic support provided by their government. 

Although  all  resources  cited  above  seem  to  have  great  and  real 
applicability, most of them, unfortunately, may be effective only for a 
portion of the children and adolescents’  population. The sad and con-
trasting reality is that we live in a world with a broad social inequality 
and neglect in children’s care (e.g. domestic violence [Marques et al., 
2020]). In this context, some questions are still to be properly addressed 
such as (i) how to deal with the reality wherein quarantined children are 
suffering from more domestic violence? And what will be the extent of 
the psychological damages in these individuals in the future? (ii) How to 
offer educational online support for children that live in rural or sub-
urban areas where there is no or limited access to the internet or even 
technological  devices?  (iii)  How  motivational  resources  can  work  for 
children whose family members have lost their income source and are 
living  in  extreme  poverty,  and  (iv)  how  to  prevent  these  individuals 
from  the  risk  of  infection  when  their  houses  stay  in  areas  with  poor 
sanitary  conditions  and  are  neglected  by  the  government?  All  these 
concerns make part of a major problem of social inequality present in the 
current world and have been aggravated with this pandemic situation. 

To properly address these two faces of reality, we call attention of 
governments  and  authorities  to  also  carefully  look  for  this  younger 
population  that  is  particularly  more  vulnerable  to  develop  a  severe 
mental  illness,  considering  their  hard-living  conditions.  Moreover, 
further efforts must be launched to provide suitable care and protection 
for  them.  In  this  context,  some  strategies  have  been  already  imple-
mented  such  as  the  development  of  a  public  documental  material  on 
how to prevent violence during the social isolation period. It has been 
developed  by  WHO  in  association  with  other  organizations  (World 
Health Organization (WHO), 2020c). The proper financial support for 
families  that have lost their  income sources must be implemented  by 
government policies in order to reduce a worsening of health conditions 
in a population that already is severely impaired by social inequalities. 

6. Discussion 

Previous works demonstrated the importance of quarantine and so-
cial  isolation  to  contain  the  spread  of  the  virus  and  the  overload  of 
health systems. However, the impact of this long-lasting social isolation 
on children and adolescents is still not properly addressed. Moreover, we 
draw attention not only to the multifaceted and heterogeneous feature 
of this pandemic which adds new issues and challenges to the popula-
tion, but also to the fact that this COVID-19 outbreak may heighten pre- 
existing  difficulties  and  problems  in  people  lives,  reaching  the  broad 
spectrum  of  the  biopsychosocial  framework.  Herein,  we  brought  ele-
ments  for  a  more  comprehensive  discussion  around  the  neurobiology 
changes triggered by the stress caused by the different facets of COVID- 
19 outbreak (Fig. 1). We shed light on the effects of stress on the HPA 
axis and the possibility of triggering psychiatric disorders such as anx-
iety  and  depression,  for  example.  We  discussed  neuroinflammation, 
diets,  brain  plasticity,  social  behavior  and  public  health  and  support 
making  an  alert  to  a  long-term  public  health  issue  and  the  need  for 
prolonged governmental support (Fig. 1). 

As discussed throughout the above topics, changes in daily routine 
particularly harm children and adolescents (Wang et al., 2020), and this 
could,  in turn, become  a  critical public  health  problem in  the  future. 
Moreover, we emphasize that youngsters can experience not only short- 
but also long-term consequences of COVID-19 stressors, as they present 
individual  responses.  The  opening  of  cities  and  the  uncontrolled  re- 
establishment of some daily activities led to peaks of new cases, which 
also generates waves of expectations and frustration especially among 
youngsters who do not know how to deal with this. 

It is our obligation to emphasize the notorious urgency of psycho-
logical monitoring of quarantined children and adolescents, for an ex-
pected  long  period,  especially  for  those  who  suffer  domestic  abuse, 
which grows in the same proportion to unemployment, financial bank-
ruptcy and social inequalities. Moreover, we cannot forget the ones who 
lost  their  family  members  to  COVID-19  or  are  separated  from  their 
parents or caregivers for safety reasons, and also those who already had 
a disorder and cannot receive proper health treatment. The withdrawal 
from social life, daily activities, as attending to school, combined with 
fear, anxiety and the feeling of the unpredictable, increase the risks for 
this group to develop psychiatric disorders in the future, even those who 
do not have such histories. Besides, children whose parents are under 
high stressful conditions at home due to pandemic also have a higher 
risk of developing psychiatric disorders (Maciejewski et al., 2018). 

Health  authorities  and  government  have  to  treat  this  as  a  public 
health  issue,  and  not  as  something  whose  outcome  is  short-lived. 
However,  more  investment  to  research  is  needed  to  evaluate  the 
impact  of  COVID-19  pandemic  stressors  on  youngsters  developing 
brains,  so  we  can  prevent  or  mitigate  mental  health  outcomes  by  of-
fering support and/or proper treatment. We reinforce the need to follow 
up these children, adolescents and also their families and caregivers in 
order to develop strategies that will be able to mitigate, in a long term, 
the COVID-19 pandemic effects.

Fig. 1. Possible impacts from COVID-19 pandemic stressors on children and adolescence’s life. Under physiological conditions, activation of the HPA axis 
occurs through production and release of CRH through the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. CRH stimulates the secretion of ACTH by the anterior portion 
of the pituitary gland (adenohypophysis). Therefore, ACTH reaches the peripheral circulation and is transported to the cortex of the adrenal glands, inducing the 
release of glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol) into the bloodstream. In a negative feedback mechanism, cortisol, in turn, inhibits the secretion of CRH and ACTH. However, 
during early stages of life, where the child or adolescent are subjected to situations of long-lasting stress, this axis can have its activity dysregulated by inflammatory 
mediators synthesis and release (e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines), neurotransmitters, hormones, among other molecules which can interfere with different physi-
ological mechanisms. It includes distinct processes since intake regulation to cognition, for example. Moreover, the homeostasis disruption caused by a dysregulation 
of the HPA axis in response to stress induces neuroimmunoendocrine changes, which, if persistent, can induce poor health. All probable harmful effects on an in-
dividual’s health triggered by this imbalance could be related to immune, endocrine, and nervous systems overload, and even a predisposition of these individuals to 
develop psychiatric disorders in adulthood. In the panel on the left we have gathered some of the possible short-term effects from exposure to stressors of COVID-19 
pandemic at this stage of life (e.g. distress and hopelessness, irregular food intake, abuse and trauma, interpersonal and environmental restraint, sensorial deprivation 
and neglect) and on the right, possible long-term consequences (e.g. underdeveloped brain circuitry, obesity, substance abuse, lack of emotional processing, psy-
chiatric disorders, suicidal thoughts). HPA: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; CRH: corticotrophin-releasing hormone; ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone.
