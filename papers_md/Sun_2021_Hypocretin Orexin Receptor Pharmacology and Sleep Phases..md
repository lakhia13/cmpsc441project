Hypocretin/orexin receptor pharmacology and sleep phases

Executive summary

The hypocretins/orexins are two excitatory neuropeptides, alternately called HCRT1 or orexin-A 
and HCRT2 or orexin-B, that are the endogenous ligands for two G protein-coupled receptors, 
HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R. Shortly after the discovery of this system, degeneration of 
hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons was implicated in the etiology of the sleep disorder 
narcolepsy. The involvement of this system in a disorder characterized by the loss of control over 
arousal state boundaries also suggested its role as a critical component of endogenous sleep/wake 
regulatory circuitry. The broad projections of the hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons, along with 
differential expression of the two receptors in the projection fields of these neurons, suggest 
distinct roles for these receptors. While HCRTR1/OX1R is associated with regulation of 
motivation, reward, and autonomic functions, HCRTR2/OX2R is strongly linked to sleep/wake 
control. The association of hypocretin/orexin with these physiological processes has led to intense 
interest in the therapeutic potential of compounds targeting these receptors. Agonists and 
antagonists for the hypocretin/orexin receptors have shown potential for the treatment of disorders 
of excessive daytime somnolence and nocturnal hyperarousal, respectively, with the first two 
antagonists approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014 and 2019 for the 
treatment of insomnia. These and related compounds have also been useful tools to advance 
hypocretin/orexin neurobiology.

ligands for two orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and were named the 
‘hypocretins’ by one group [1] for their restricted localization to the hypothalamus and their 
structural similarity to secretin, and the ‘orexins’ by the other group [2] after the Greek word 
orexis meaning appetite, based on the increased food intake associated with 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of the neuropeptides in rats. Shortly after the 
discovery of the hypocretins/orexins, dysfunction of this neurotransmitter system was 
implicated in animal models of the sleep disorder narcolepsy [3, 4], which subsequently led 
to the discovery of loss of these neurons as the etiology underlying human narcolepsy [5, 6]. 
The link between this neuropeptide system and a disorder of excessive sleepiness also 
suggested a role for this system in the regulation of arousal states [7, 8]. The implication of 
this system as the cause of narcolepsy and in sleep regulation led to immediate interest in the 
potential of agonists and antagonists targeting the hypocretin/orexin receptors for the 
treatment of sleep disorders.

Neuropeptide and receptor pharmacology

The two neuropeptides, alternately called hypocretin 1 (HCRT1) or orexin-A and hypocretin 
2 (HCRT2) or orexin-B, are cleaved from the prepro-orexin precursor. HCRT1/orexin-A is a 
2562 Da polypeptide, 33 amino acids in length, whereas HCRT2/orexin-B is a linear 2397 
Da polypeptide, 28 amino acids in length [2]. Both peptides share a structurally similar 
amidated C-terminal, which is crucial for both the binding of the peptides and activation of 
the cognate receptors, whereas the N-terminal peptide sequence is more variable between 
HCRT1/orexin-A and HCRT2/orexin-B [2]. Hypocretin/orexin receptor 1 (HCRTR1/OX1R) 
and receptor 2 (HCRTR2/OX2R) share 64% sequence similarity in humans [2]. While 
HCRTR1/OX1R shows a selective binding affinity for HCRT1/orexin-A, HCRTR2/OX2R 
has an equal affinity for both neuropeptides [2]. Despite the similarities of both hypocretin/
orexin neuropeptide and receptor subtypes, the two receptors are differentially expressed 
within the brain [9], suggesting they have distinct physiological functions (Figure 1).

GPCRs such as HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R are composed of seven transmembrane 
helices. The C-terminal portion of helices 2–4 of HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R 
confer differential selectivity of the two receptors [10], although the specific differences in 
the structure of HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R that result in receptor specificity are 
subtle. Both receptors also contain an N-terminal amphipathic α-helix that mediates the 
binding of the orexin neuropeptides [11]. A substitution of threonine for alanine at the 3.33 
position and threonine for serine at the 2.61 position within the binding pocket of human 
HCRTR2/OX2R causes a 5% decrease in the volume of the pocket compared with 
HCRTR1/OX1R, a feature that may mediate receptor selectivity and, furthermore, could be 
exploited to confer specificity when designing molecules selective for each of the two 
receptors [11].

Evolutionary insights

Hypocretin/orexin-containing neurons have been identified in the hypothalamic region of a 
variety of vertebrates and the components of the orexin system are highly conserved across 
vertebrates [12]. Two genes encoding peptides with structural similarity to HCRT1/orexin-A 
have been identified in Amphioxus, an extant member of the basal chordate subphylum

Cephalochordata, that is often studied to provide insight into early vertebrate evolution [13]. 
The orexin-A-like peptide is expressed in the neural chord of Amphioxus. Since the neural 
chord is believed to be a precursor to the vertebrate brain, the hypocretin/orexin system 
might have already been present in some form prior to the diversification of the vertebrates. 
The presence of a conserved hypocretin/orexin neuronal system among widespread 
phylogenetic groups indicates strong selective pressure to maintain a vital function sub-
served by this network.

Hypocretin/Orexin receptor antagonists (a.k.a. SORAs and DORAs)

Hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons project to brain regions involved in regulating reward, 
learning, memory, emotion, attention, and arousal states [14]. The innervation of brain 
structures involved in the regulation of these various functions has made the development of 
hypocretin/orexin receptor antagonists an active area of investigation for the treatment of 
addiction, sleep disorders, obesity, mood, anxiety and panic disorders. There are two main 
classes of hypocretin/orexin receptor antagonists, those selective for a specific hypocretin/
orexin receptor known as selective orexin receptor antagonists (SORAs), i.e., selective 
antagonists for receptor 1 (1-SORAs) or receptor 2 (2-SORAs), and those with binding 
affinity for both receptors, the dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs). Most of the 
current hypocretin/orexin receptor-directed drugs have focused on antagonizing the role of 
this system in promoting and maintaining wakefulness for the treatment of insomnia and 
other disorders of nocturnal sleep disruption.

Hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons promote wakefulness through release of 
these excitatory peptides and glutamate at synapses in multiple brain regions involved in the 
regulation of arousal states (Figure 1). Conversely, hypocretin/orexin antagonists promote 
sleep through the inhibition of the waking drive mediated by the hypocretin/orexin system; 
consequently, these drugs are used for the treatment of insomnia and disorders of impaired 
nocturnal sleep. Two DORAs, suvorexant and lemborexant, have been approved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to date and a number are in clinical trials. Although 
almorexant was the first DORA shown to reduce sleep latency in several species (Tables 1 
and 2) and to decrease wake after sleep onset (WASO) in humans [15, 16], clinical 
development was curtailed due to its hepatoxicity.

In 2014, the DORA suvorexant (formerly, MK-4305) was the first hypocretin/orexin 
antagonist approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic insomnia. Suvorexant binds to 
HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R with nanomolar affinity, thereby inhibiting hypocretin/
orexin receptor signaling through the competitive occupation of receptor binding sites [17]. 
The binding of suvorexant to HCRTR2/OX2R also stabilizes a network of extracellular salt 
bridges and blocks transmembrane helix motions needed for receptor activation [18]. This 
inhibition of orexin receptor signaling promotes sleep by attenuating the wake-promoting 
effect of the hypocretin/orexin system, resulting in an increase in the number of transitions 
to non-rapid-eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep in laboratory rodents whose sleep is 
polyphasic (Table 1) [19]. Like almorexant, suvorexant reduces the latency to persistent 
sleep (LPS), decreases WASO, and increases total sleep time (TST; Table 2) in humans [20–
22]. The DORA lemborexant [23, 24] was approved by the FDA for insomnia in 2019 (Table

2). Several other drugs with sleep-promoting effects, for example, the 2-SORA seltorexant 
[25, 26] are in clinical development (Table 2) and a New Drug Application (NDA) for the 
DORA daridorexant, which showed significant improvements in sleep as well as daytime 
functioning in clinical trials [27–29], was submitted to the FDA in January 2021. 
Development of the DORA filorexant (MK-6096) [30, 31] was abandoned by Merck.

HCRTR1/OX1R

Putative roles

HCRTR1/OX1R knockout (KO) mice exhibit mild sleep disruption, increased anxiety, 
depression-like behavior, and startle response, as well as decreased locomotory activity, 
prepulse inhibition, and social interaction, suggesting a diverse role for HCRTR1/OX1R 
[32]. HCRTR1/OX1R signaling has also been implicated in drug, alcohol, and food-seeking 
behavior through modulation of motivational activation (Figure 1) [33]. Studies utilizing 
HCRTR1/OX1R antagonists have described anxiolytic, anti-stress, and anti-rewarding 
properties, further implying a role for HCRTR1/OX1R signaling in these processes [34–38]. 
Although HCRTR2/OX2R and dual OX1R/OX2R null mutant (i.e., KO) mice both exhibit a 
sleep and behavioral phenotype consistent with narcolepsy, the phenotype is more 
pronounced in the dual receptor KO mice [39–41], suggesting synergistic interaction 
between the two hypocretin/orexin receptor subtypes in sleep/wake control.

Selective HCRTR1/OX1R agonists

To our knowledge, no selective HCRTR1/OX1R agonists have been identified to date. ICV 
administration of HCRT1/orexin-A, the endogenous ligand for both HCRTR1/OX1R (IC50 = 
20 nM) and HCRTR2/OX2R (IC50 = 38 nM) [2], results in increased wake and decreased 
NREM and REM sleep compared to control mice receiving vehicle injections [42]. When 
administered intranasally in humans, HCRT1/orexin-A has a REM-stabilizing effect but, 
given the affinity of orexin-A for both HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R, the effects of 
administration of this peptide could be mediated by either or both receptors [43, 44]. While 
sleep regulation is more clearly associated with HCRTR2/OX2R agonism, HCRT1/orexin-A 
administration also triggers drug-seeking behavior, alterations in autonomic physiology, 
increased food intake, and has antidepressant effects which are likely regulated by 
HCRTR1/OX1R activation [34, 45–47]. These results suggest some of the physiological 
effects that might be expected from HCRTR1/OX1R agonists.

Selective HCRTR1/OX1R antagonists (1-SORAs)

SB-334867 was the first 1-SORA to be described [35] and has been shown to reduce reward-
seeking behavior associated with drug addiction and the consumption of high-fat foods [34–
37]. SB-334867 also decreases wake and increases both NREM and REM sleep in rats, an 
effect that is consistent with, but is modest in comparison to, that seen following the 
administration of DORAs (Table 1) [48]. Furthermore, SB-334867 reverses the sleep 
modulatory effects of HCRT1/orexin-A administration [49]. The sleep modulatory effects of 
1-SORAs have not been consistent between studies and compounds; nevertheless, these 
results suggest a modest role for HCRTR1/OX1R signaling in sleep regulation that will 
require further study to fully elucidate [48–50].

Administration of another 1-SORA, JNJ-54717793, reduced panic-induced behaviors and 
cardiovascular responses in preclinical models of panic and anxiety without affecting 
baseline activity patterns, suggesting that HCRTR1/OX1R antagonists might represent a 
novel treatment for anxiety conditions [38]. Several other 1-SORAs have been identified, 
however, their behavioral effects and therapeutic utility have yet to be evaluated [51–53]. 
While DORAs have also shown potential in the treatment of addiction and certain 
neuropsychiatric conditions, 1-SORAs do not have the strong sleep-promoting effect that 
DORAs do, thus giving 1-SORAs a distinct advantage as potential addiction and anxiety 
therapeutics. Two 1-SORAs, ACT-539313 and JNJ-61393215, are in clinical testing [54, 
55].

HCRTR2/OX2R

Putative role in sleep/wake

As mentioned above, HCRTR2/OX2R has an equal affinity for both HCRT1/orexin-A and 
HCRT2/orexin-B [2]. HCRTR2/OX2R is expressed primarily in the cortical layer VI, the 
nucleus accumbens, raphé nuclei, septal nuclei, the subthalamic and paraventricular thalamic 
nuclei, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and many hypothalamic nuclei including the 
tuberomammillary nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, and 
premammillary nucleus (Figure 1) [9]. Landmark studies have demonstrated that loss of 
orexin neurons and the resulting hypocretin/orexin deficiency is associated with narcolepsy 
type 1 (NT1) [5, 6, 56]. Mice lacking HCRTR2/OX2R exhibit a narcoleptic phenotype 
characterized by fragmentation of sleep/wake states and cataplexy-like episodes [39], while 
HCRTR1/OX1R KO mice only display mild fragmentation of sleep/wake cycles, with no 
other overt signs of narcoleptic symptomatology [41]. In the 1970s, several strains of large 
breed dogs were found to display an inherited narcolepsy-like phenotype characterized by 
cataplectic attacks, sleep fragmentation, and other sleep/wake symptoms associated with 
narcolepsy. This phenotype was transmitted as an autosomal recessive gene called canarc-1 
that was later determined to encode a mutation in HCRTR2/OX2R [4]. Together, these 
studies suggested a pivotal role for HCRTR2/OX2R in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, at 
least in animal models. The implication of the loss of hypocretin/orexin-containing neurons 
in the etiology of the human narcolepsy further suggested a sleep/wake regulatory function 
for this system. While HCRTR1/OX1R expression appears to be reduced in the brain of 
human narcoleptics, HCRTR2/OX2R expression remains high [57]. Thus, the 
pharmacological substrate for a hypocretin/orexin therapeutic remains intact, a conclusion 
supported by studies demonstrating the amelioration of sleep symptoms in NT1 patients 
through the intranasal application of HCRT1/orexin-A [43, 44]. Consequently, HCRTR2/
OX2R agonism could be an effective therapeutic strategy to address hypocretin/orexin 
deficiency in NT1, although it is also possible that combined HCRTR2/OX2R and 
HCRTR1/OX1R agonism or OX1R agonism alone might bring some benefit to narcoleptics.

Selective HCRTR2/OX2R agonists

Intrathecal and ICV administration of HCRT1/orexin-A increases wake and suppresses 
cataplexy in hypocretin/orexin neuron-ablated and hypocretin/orexin peptide-deficient 
mouse models of narcolepsy [58, 59] but not in HCRTR2/OX2R-deficient narcoleptic

canines [60], suggesting the potential for selective HCRTR2/OX2R agonists in the treatment 
of narcolepsy and other disorders of excessive sleepiness. The first selective nonpeptide 
HCRTR2/OX2R agonist, YNT185 (EC50 on OX2R = 23 nM, OX1R/OX2R EC50 ratio = 70), 
was described in 2015 [61]. Systemic administration of YNT185 reduced cataplectic attacks 
in hypocretin/orexin peptide-deficient and hypocretin/orexin neuron-ablated mice but not in 
hypocretin/orexin receptor-deficient mice (Table 1) [62]. These results provided a proof-of-
concept for hypocretin/orexin replacement therapy with HCRTR2/OX2R agonists for NT1. 
Peripherally administered YNT185 promoted wakefulness in hypocretin/orexin-deficient, 
hypocretin/orexin neuron-ablated and wild-type mice, suggesting that hypocretin/orexin 
receptor agonists may be useful for treating sleepiness due to NT1 and other causes. No 
rebound was observed in sleep parameters during the active phase after YNT185-induced 
increases in wakefulness in either wild-type or hypocretin/orexin-deficient mice; a results 
that should be more thoroughly investigated [62]. Ultimately though, YNT185 has limited in 
vivo efficacy and thus appears unsuitable for further clinical development.

Takeda described the HCRTR2/OX2R-selective agonist TAK925 (Table 1) with an EC50 on 
OX2R = 5.5 nM and >5,000-fold selectivity over HCRTR1/OX1R [63]. TAK925 has modest 
wake-promoting effects in wild-type mice and nonhuman primates when injected 
subcutaneously or intravenously (Table 1) [64]. In the orexin/ataxin-3 mouse model of 
narcolepsy, TAK925 increased wake and reduced sleep/wake fragmentation and cataplexy 
(Table 1) [65]. The wake-promoting effect of TAK925 was not diminished after 14 days sub-
chronic administration [65]. Preliminary data also showed that TAK925 attenuated body 
weight gain [66], a symptom in human narcolepsy that also occurs in orexin/ataxin-3 mice 
without increases in daily food intake [67]. A Phase 1 study in healthy sleep-deprived adults 
demonstrated that TAK925 was well-tolerated and increased wakefulness at night compared 
to placebo [68]. If these results are confirmed in a broader Phase 2 study and the drug is 
found to be safe and effective, TAK925 could become the first narcoleptic therapeutic 
directed toward the neurotransmitter system whose dysfunction is implicated in the etiology 
of the disorder. However, TAK925 requires intravenous administration, which has driven 
Takeda to pursue development of other orally available agonists more suitable for clinical 
application.

Takeda also described an orally available HCRTR2/OX2R agonist, TAK-994 (Table 1), with 
an EC50 on OX2R = 19 nM and >700-fold selectivity against OX1R [69]. Oral 
administration of TAK-994 during the sleep phase at 5 hours into the light period promoted 
wakefulness in wild type (WT) mice, but not in HCRTR2/OX2R KO mice (Table 1) [69]. 
Oral administration of TAK-994 during the active phase in both orexin/ataxin-3 [67] and 
orexin-tTA;TetO DTA [70] narcolepsy mouse models significantly increased time spent in 
wake and improved wake maintenance while suppressing cataplectic episodes [71]. 
TAK-994 had wake-promoting effects following chronic dosing for up to 14 days in orexin/
ataxin-3 mice without causing a sleep rebound [72]. A Phase 1 trial of TAK-994 in healthy 
volunteers has been completed.

Selective HCRTR2/OX2R antagonists (2-SORAs)

Seltorexant (JNJ-42847922; MIN-202) is an orally-active, high affinity and selective 
HCRTR2/OX2R antagonist under development for the treatment of patients with major 
depressive disorder and insomnia. Seltorexant crosses the blood-brain barrier and quickly 
occupies HCRTR2/OX2R binding sites in the rat brain [73]. In a randomized Phase 2 study 
to evaluate the efficacy of seltorexant in treating insomnia without psychiatric comorbidity 
[25], oral administration of seltorexant facilitated sleep onset and prolonged sleep duration 
while also improving sleep quality, as indicated by decreased WASO over the first six hours 
of the night (Table 2). The improvement of these sleep parameters by seltorexant was 
significantly greater than zolpidem in this study [25]. Several other 2-SORAs have also 
shown promising sleep-promoting effects in preclinical testing (Table 1) [48, 74, 75].

Insomnia is common in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), however, the sleep-
promoting effects of 2-SORAs have not been consistent in studies of MDD patients 
exhibiting insomnia. A Phase 2b trial of seltorexant as adjunct to antidepressant therapy in 
adults with treatment-resistant MDD showed a statistically significant, dose-dependent 
decrease in LPS, increased TST, increased sleep efficiency, and a tendency towards 
subjectively improved mood (Table 2) [76, 77]. In a separate Phase 2 trial of seltorexant in 
MDD patients with insomnia [77], a decrease in LPS and WASO, and an increase in TST 
failed to reach significance. However, antidepressant efficacy was correlated significantly 
with increased delta-power during stage 2 sleep. Hypocretin/orexin neurons project to 
multiple brain regions involved in the secretion and regulation of stress hormones such as 
those involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in animals (Figure 1) (e.g., 
adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol) [78]. The HPA axis is known to be overactive in 
depressed patients, a significant proportion of whom suffer from insomnia. Use of 2-SORAs 
or DORAs for the treatment of insomnia in patients with MDD may also help stabilize the 
HPA axis, but both this potential action on the HPA axis and the efficacy of hypocretin/
orexin antagonists for the treatment of nocturnal hyperarousal in MDD patients requires 
further exploration.

Conclusions and perspective

Therapeutics targeting the hypocretin/orexin receptors for the treatment of addiction, 
anxiety, mood and sleep disorders represent a relatively new principle, with just two 
hypocretin/orexin antagonists approved by mid 2021 by the FDA for use in humans for the 
treatment of insomnia. Given the range of physiological processes in which the hypocretin/
orexin system has been implicated, hypocretin/orexin receptor antagonists/agonists have 
broad therapeutic potential. Several HCRTR2/OX2R agonists (Table 1), most notably 
TAK925 and more recently TAK994, have shown promise in both preclinical and clinical 
studies assessing their potential as treatments for narcolepsy with hypocretin/orexin-
deficiency. Both DORAs and 2-SORAs have been explored primarily for their sleep-
promoting properties in humans, and DORAs along with 1-SORAs have shown promise in 
the reduction of reward in food and drug addiction paradigms in rodents (Tables 1 and 2). 
Polysomnographic (PSG) studies have revealed improved sleep quality and increased

safety profile of the DORA lemborexant is broadly similar to suvorexant, although the half-
life of suvorexant is shorter. Lemborexant improves objective (PSG) and subjective 
measures of sleep onset and sleep maintenance compared with placebo (Table 2), with the 
most commonly reported adverse event being next-day somnolence [23]. There was no 
evidence of significant rebound insomnia or withdrawal effects following treatment 
discontinuation. To our knowledge, suvorexant and lemborexant have not been directly 
compared in humans. Several other hypocretin/orexin receptor antagonists including the 2-
SORA seltorexant [25] are in clinical development and an NDA for the DORA daridorexant 
was submitted in January 2021 (Table 2) [27]. DORAs have also shown promise in the 
treatment of nocturnal hyperarousal associated with other disorders, including insomnia that 
occurs during the clinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease [81].

While the sleep-promoting effect of these compounds is well-established (Tables 1 and 2), 
their influence on sleep architecture is somewhat controversial, with conflicting data on how 
DORAs modulate specific sleep states [15, 80, 82, 83]. While it is well established that 
DORAs increase TST, several studies have found that this effect occurs primarily through an 
increase in REM sleep without a proportional increase in time spent in NREM sleep. By 
contrast, most studies utilizing 2-SORAs report that these compounds proportionally 
increase REM sleep and NREM sleep (Tables 1 and 2) [80]. Since co-administration of an 
HCRTR1/OX1R antagonist with an HCRTR2/OX2R antagonist has been shown to greatly 
attenuate the sleep-promoting effects of the HCRTR2/OX2R antagonist, simultaneous 
inhibition of HCRTR1/OX1R may reduce the sleep-promoting effects mediated by selective 
HCRTR2/OX2R antagonism [74]; however, this is contradicted by preclinical research 
showing that the 2-SORA MK-1064 requires higher receptor occupancy than a DORA to 
achieve the same sleep-promoting effect [84].

If subsequent research supports these observations of differential effects of 2-SORAs and 
DORAs on sleep substates, the clinical utility of these compounds may ultimately depend on 
the sleep phenotype of the target population. While there is a clear advantage in increasing 
TST when treating insomnia, the impact of potentially increasing REM sleep without 
proportionally increasing NREM sleep, which is generally regarded as the more restorative 
sleep state, is unclear and warrants further exploration. On the other hand, this feature of 
DORAs could also be exploited and may ultimately prove advantageous for the treatment of 
disorders associated with REM sleep deficiencies such as post-traumatic stress and anxiety 
disorders. Currently, information regarding the effect of DORAs and 2-SORAs on human 
sleep architecture is very limited; thus, conclusions based on the results reported to date 
should be considered preliminary. Ultimately, a systematic comparison of hypocretin/orexin 
antagonists on the NREM/REM ratio and TST in both pathological and healthy populations 
is needed to more clearly establish how these compounds affect sleep architecture. If the 
reported trend for 2-SORAs to proportionally increase both REM and NREM sleep is 
replicated in future studies and broader clinical trials, such compounds may prove to be very 
advantageous in the treatment of sleep disorders such as insomnia in which the sleep 
disruption is not specific to a particular sleep-stage [54, 85].

Key Take-Home Points

Although the hypocretin/orexin system has been implicated in numerous 
physiological processes, it is most prominently associated with its role in the 
regulation of arousal states.

While HCRTR1/OX1R has been implicated in the regulation of reward, 
motivation, and autonomic processes, HCRTR2/OX2R is most strongly 
associated with sleep/wake control.

HCRTR2/OX2R activation promotes wakefulness whereas HCRTR2/OX2R 
antagonism promotes sleep.

The regulatory role of the hypocretin/orexin system has made HCRTR1/
OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R attractive therapeutic targets and, as of mid-2021, 
two dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs) have been approved for 
treatment of disrupted nocturnal sleep.

Selective HCRTR1/OX1R and HCRTR2/OX2R antagonists (1- and 2-SORAs) 
have shown potential in preclinical testing for the treatment of drug and food 
reward motivation, anxiety, and insomnia.

Hypocretin/orexin deficiency due to degeneration of the hypocretin/orexin-
producing neurons underlies the sleep disorder narcolepsy and hypocretin/
orexin replacement therapy through development of small molecule agonist is 
an active area of research in the treatment of this disorder.

Fig. 1. Hypocretin/orexin-containing neurons and their projections, receptor distributions, and 
downstream behavioral outcomes.
Hypocretin/orexin-producing neurons are located in the hypothalamus (Hy) and project to 
diverse brain regions differentially expressing hypocretin/orexin receptors 1 and 2 (OX1R 
and OX2R; receptor expression is indicated by the background color of each brain region), 
including the cerebral cortex, cingulate cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BNST), 
nucleus accumbens (NAc), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), dorsal raphé (DR), locus 
coeruleus (LC), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG), 
the dorsal deep mesencephalic nucleus (dDPMe), pedunculopontine and laterodorsal 
tegmental nuclei (PPT and LDT), substantia nigra (SN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), 
central area of the amygdala (CeA), and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Through these 
projections, hypocretin/orexin-containing neurons are able to elicit diverse behavioral 
outputs.
