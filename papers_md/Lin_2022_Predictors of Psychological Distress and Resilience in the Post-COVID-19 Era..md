Abstract
Background  The COVID-19 global pandemic has had profound effects on mental health and wellbeing. The present study 
examined trends in distress and recovery in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Predictors that might increase risks or 
provide protections again distress were explored.
Method  Participants were recruited using social media during the COVID-19 pandemic to complete a baseline and 6-week 
follow-up survey (N = 241). The change patterns of PTSD symptoms from baseline to follow-up were characterized using 
latent class growth analysis (LCGA). A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore the differences in the depres-
sive symptoms across trajectory groups. Multinominal logistic regression was performed to investigate potential predictors 
of the outcome trajectories.
Results  Four longitudinal outcome trajectories were identified: chronic (PTSD symptoms remained high; 14.9%), resilient 
(symptoms remained low; 43.2%), recovered (symptoms decreased from symptomatic levels to asymptomatic; 19.5%), and 
delayed (symptoms increased from asymptomatic levels to symptomatic; 22.4%). Hopelessness and maladaptive coping 
strategies were unique predictors of distress and resilience as well as longer-term trajectories.
Conclusion  Individuals evidenced four outcome trajectories of distress in the aftermath of COVID-19 in China. Despite the 
uncertainty and high levels of stress related to the pandemic, the majority of the sample demonstrated resilience and recovery. 
It is essential to identify individuals at risk for chronic and delayed distress in order to build resilience.

Introduction

The global COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has pro-
foundly changed lives. As of August 2021, the World Health 
Organization reported more than 199 million confirmed 
cases across the globe [1]. After peaking in February 2020, 
China had drastic decreases in daily COVID-19 cases [1]. 
Individuals in the context of a global disaster may continue 
to be affected by ongoing post-disaster stressors, like the 
economic effects or concerns about worsening situations in 
other countries, which may add to COVID-19-related dis-
tress [2]. Conversely, surviving the pandemic may improve 
individuals’ resistance to later stressors and promote their 
resilience [3]. Researchers and clinicians have been call-
ing for attention to not just physical health but also mental 
health during the pandemic as research on the high levels of 
distress is emerging [4–9]. Further, as China and other coun-
tries around the world are now seeing another rise in cases 
due to COVID-19 variants [1], chronic and acute stressors

continue to be of concern as people may still be recover-
ing from the initial quarantines while still facing even more 
restrictions in order to halt the spread of the Delta variant 
and high levels of uncertainty about the future. Given the 
protracted nature of the pandemic, longitudinal studies are 
necessary to understand trends in distress and recovery as 
well as long-term psychological adjustment [10].

Psychological Distress and Resilience

Research  has  demonstrated  great  heterogeneity  in  indi-
viduals’ responses to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) 
[11–15]. Although most people are exposed to at least one  
PTE or chronically aversive circumstance throughout their 
lifespans, the majority of people show resilience or may 
quickly  recover  from  the  initial  traumatic  distress  [11]. 
Resilience reflects an individuals’ ability to keep distress 
low and to show psychological adjustment in the face of the 
adversity. In contrast to the resilience and recovery, some 
individuals develop chronic psychological problems such 
as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [16]. Epidemiologic 
research estimates that the lifetime PTSD prevalence is 8.3% 
[17]. However, previous taxonometric investigations sug-
gest that PTSD may be better understood as psychological 
distress varying in severity and duration instead of a discrete 
clinical category suggesting that symptoms, not diagnoses, 
are important to study and further suggesting that the rates 
of distressing symptoms may be much higher than the rates 
of diagnoses [12, 13].

Four theoretical trajectories have been proposed to cap-
ture prototypical patterns of distress following a PTE: resil-
ient, recovered, delayed, and chronic [11]. Resilient individ-
uals are fairly stable with healthy levels of psychological and 
physical functioning in the face of a PTE; this is the most 
common outcome trajectory. Recovered individuals experi-
ence elevated psychological symptoms initially but gradually 
return to pre-trauma levels. In contrast, the delayed trajec-
tory is characterized by initially moderate levels of psycho-
logical distress that increase across time. The chronic trajec-
tory is indicated by consistently high levels of distress across 
time. The four trajectories were demonstrated and replicated 
in numerous studies on various types of PTEs (e.g., war, 
disease, injury, natural disaster, and sexual assault) and dur-
ing previous pandemics, including Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 
[18–27].

Research during the COVID-19 pandemic supports this 
four-trajectory model [11]. Data from a nationally repre-
sentative sample in Spain were categorized into four tra-
jectories: resilient, delayed distress, recovered, and sus-
tained distress based on absence/presence of distress at two 
assessment points (April and May 2020) [28]. Over half of 
the sample evinced resilience whereas around one-fourth 

experienced sustained distress [28]. In another longitudinal 
study of 21,938 adults in England (from March to July 2020) 
[29], four trajectories of depression and five of anxiety were 
identified using growth mixture modeling. Over 70% of the 
sample showed low levels of symptoms and around 10% 
showed severe or moderate levels of symptoms throughout 
the lockdown. Other studies have categorized individuals 
into high, normal, and low levels of resilience [30]. Low 
resilience  individuals  experienced  increases  in  distress 
whereas high resilience individuals maintained a low level 
of distress [30]. These findings suggest that psychological 
responses to COVID-19 are heterogeneous and highlight the 
need to identify individuals who are at higher risk of high 
and chronic distress in order to target those at highest risk 
for prevention and intervention efforts [28, 30, 31].

Predictors of Psychological Resilience and Distress

Resilience and recovery are associated with various protec-
tive and risk factors. Trajectories of psychological distress 
after a PTE vary by factors such as pre-existing mental 
health conditions and demographics [25, 32, 33]. By charac-
terizing different trajectories of psychological distress across 
different phases of the pandemic and examining predictors 
of membership in each trajectory, researchers can identify 
protective and risk factors that discretely predict resilience 
and recovery and help identify at-risk populations in order 
to improve resilience. Two key predictors of distress and 
resilience during PTEs are hopelessness and coping.

Hopelessness

Hopelessness has been found to predict PTSD symptoms 
in the aftermath of PTEs [34]; higher levels of hope are 
associated with greater reductions in PTSD and depres-
sive symptoms [35]. The COVID-19 pandemic and result-
ant lockdowns may induce hopelessness about finances, 
careers, and future plans — as well as when and whether the 
pandemic will end. Research during the current pandemic 
has found that hopelessness is one of the strongest predic-
tors of distress, internalizing symptoms, and anger and is 
negatively associated with resilience [36, 37]. Hope may 
be particularly important because it reflects an individual’s 
expectations about the longer-term effects of the pandemic, 
thereby affecting current-day behavioral and psychological 
responses. However, hope is not a static emotion and given 
the longstanding nature of the pandemic, it may wax and 
wane over time—as may distress levels.

Coping

Coping styles may be implicated in different trajectories of 
distress and there are clear associations between maladaptive 

1 3

coping  and  poor  mental  health  outcomes.  For  example, 
avoidant coping is positively associated with psychological 
distress after trauma and negatively associated with resil-
ience [11, 38]. Further, high reliance on avoidant coping 
strategies predicts more severe PTSD symptoms which, in 
turn, predicts greater use of avoidant coping [39]. However, 
the relationship between adaptive coping and psychological 
distress is less clear. In a 2007 meta-analysis [38], there was 
no association found between approach coping and distress. 
However, recent findings suggest that adaptive coping may 
be associated with resilience [40]. Given the high level of 
psychological distress caused by COVID-19, it is important 
to examine how different coping strategies may predict dis-
crete trajectories of psychological distress. Adding to factors 
known to contribute to psychological distress and resilience, 
unique characteristics of pandemics such as fears of conta-
gion and effects of quarantining may also affect individuals 
[14, 25, 41]. Additionally, health behaviors like substance 
use and pandemic-related worries may heighten stress and 
result in long-term negative mental health effects [25, 42].

This study aimed to investigate psychological distress and 
resilience in China during the COVID-19 pandemic using  
prospectively collected data collected at two timepoints. 
The first wave of data collection occurred in May 2020, 
with a 6-week follow-up. The first aim was to examine the 
trajectories of PTSD symptoms. We hypothesized that the 
trajectories during COVID-19 would be consistent with the 
four theoretical trajectories (resilient, recovered, delayed, 
and chronic) found in other research [11]. Next, this study 
aimed to explore potential predictors of the trajectories. Fac-
tors potentially associated with psychological distress and 
resilience, including hopelessness, coping, and individuals’ 
reactions to the pandemic, were tested.

Methods

Participants and Procedure

Participants were recruited using flyers distributed on social 
media sites (e.g., Zhihu) and through personal networks. The 
first wave of the survey was administered between May 3, 
2020, and May 28, 2020. Six weeks later, participants who 
provided their email address for future follow-ups were sent 
an email to take part in the follow-up survey between June 
18, 2020, and July 7, 2020. Full approval to this study has 
been given by Institutional Review Board. A total of 352 
participants completed the first survey and provided their 
email address for future follow-ups. Of these, 241 partici-
pants responded to the follow-up survey, resulting in a sam-
ple of 241 participants. The mean age of participants was 
20.15 (SD = 2.17; Median = 20; Range = 17–38). The sam-
ple primarily comprised men (70.1%), single (73.9%), and

Some  participants  chose  to  not  disclose  their  demographic  informa-
tion.  Therefore,  the  number  (percentage)  of  individuals  in  each  cat-
egory may add up to less than 241 (100%)

heterosexual individuals (78.8%; Table 1). Most participants 
resided in a small (40.7%) city, in Northwest China (24.5%), 
in a province with 500–599 confirmed cases (36.1%). No 
significant differences were found between the current sam-
ple and those who only completed the first survey in terms of 
PTSD symptoms, coping strategies, hopelessness, COVID-
19 responses, and demographic variables.

Measures

Participants were asked to report demographic information 
including gender, sexual identity, education, and relationship 
status as well as previous mental health diagnosis. The survey  
assessed participants’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(e.g., worries and protective behaviors), depressive and PTSD 
symptoms, hopelessness, and coping strategies at baseline.

509

Depressive and PTSD symptoms, hopelessness, and cop-
ing strategies were measured again at follow-up. The survey 
instrument was adapted for a Chinese population from an 
international survey on COVID-19 and mental health [10].

COVID‑19 Responses

COVID Worries

Participants were asked whether they had been exposed 
to the coronavirus on a 5-point scale (1 = Definitely Not, 
5 = Definitely Yes) and to rate how worried they felt about 8 
pandemic-related factors on a scale of 0 (not worried at all) 
to 100 (extremely worried), for example, how worried are 
you about: (1) being exposed to COVID-19; (2) becoming 
infected in the next 3 months; and (3) running out of money 
(see full list in Supplemental Table 1). The 8-item scale 
demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.909).

COVID Protective Actions

Participants were asked to indicate whether they had used 
each of the 10 recommended protective actions to help pre-
vent the spread of coronavirus in the past 2 weeks (e.g., 
wearing masks; Supplemental Table 1). An index score was  
created  to  reflect  the  total  number  of  protective  actions 
taken by participants (range = 0–10).

COVID Severity

Severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each participant’s 
province  was  indicated  by  the  cumulative  number  of 
COVID-19 positive cases [1].

Health Behaviors

Participants were asked whether they had ever consumed 
alcohol. If yes, they were asked if they had consumed any 
alcohol over the past 7 days. Participants were also asked 
how healthy they felt their eating was on a 5-point scale 
(1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent).

Mental Health

PTSD Symptoms

The Impact of Event Scale (IES) is a 15-item questionnaire 
measuring subjective distress related to a specific event [43]. 
Seven of the 15 items measure intrusive symptoms, and 8 
items measure avoidance symptoms. The scale was adapted 
to measure acute peritraumatic stress (i.e., the tense of all 

items was changed from the past to present to examine PTSD 
symptoms at the time of the PTE). Participants were specifi-
cally asked to rate their levels of stress related to COVID-19 
(e.g., I have dreams about [COVID-19]) in the past 7 days 
on a 4-point scale (ranging from 0 = not at all to 3 = often). 
The IES has been used to screen for PTSD in clinical and 
research settings [44–46]. Previous literature has reported 
strong criterion validity and convergent validity of IES. 
The internal consistency of the overall IES scores based on 
the modified version among the current sample at the first 
assessment was excellent (α = 0.942).

Depressive Symptoms

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) 
scale is a self-report scale with strong internal consistency 
and high specificity [47]. This study used an 11-item version 
of the CES-D with comparable psychometric properties to 
the original version to reduce participant burden [48]. Par-
ticipants were asked to indicate how often they have expe-
rienced each of the 11 items (e.g., felt depressed) during 
the past week from 0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most 
of the time). The internal consistency based on the current 
sample at the first wave of assessment was 0.850.

Hopelessness

The Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) is a 20-item self-report 
scale measuring negative attitudes about the future. Indi-
viduals were asked to indicate whether each item was true 
or false for them (e.g., My future seems dark to me) [49]. 
Each item response was assigned a score of 0 or 1. Total 
scores ranged from 0 to 20 with higher scores reflecting 
higher levels of hopelessness. The scale  had fair reliability 
in this study (0.719).

Coping

The  Brief-COPE  is  a  28-item  self-report  questionnaire 
assessing coping strategies. Participants were asked to rate 
each item on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = I haven’t been doing 
this at all; 3 = I’ve been doing this a lot) [50]. Items are 
categorized into adaptive coping and maladaptive coping 
[51]. Adaptive coping consists of 8 subscales (active coping, 
planning, positive reframing, acceptance, humor, religion, 
emotional support, and instrumental support). Maladaptive 
coping consists of 6 subscales (denial, venting, substance 
use, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and self-
blame). The internal consistency for adaptive coping and 

1 3

maladaptive coping for this sample were 0.890 and 0.837, 
respectively.

Data Analysis

A heatmap of missing values was drawn to visualize the 
patterns of missing values in order to examine the randomi-
zation of the missing values. Missing values were replaced 
with the median value of the item. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to compare the participants who completed both 
waves of survey (N = 241) to those who only completed the 
first survey (n = 111). Specifically, t-tests and chi-square 
tests were performed to compare the two groups in terms of 
mental health outcomes, COVID-19 responses, and demo-
graphical variables.

An unconditional latent class growth analysis (LCGA) 
was performed to examine the trajectories of PTSD symp-
toms using Mplus 8.3 [52]. The LCGA began with a single-
class model and then added one class each time until none of  
the likelihood tests was significant. The conceptual rationale  
and statistical model fit of all models were compared to select 
the best fitting model. The model fit indices include Akaike’s 
Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Crite-
rion (BIC), sample-size adjusted Bayesian information crite-
rion (ssBIC), and VLMR LRT = Vuong–Lo–Mendell–Rubin  
likelihood ratio test (VLMR LRT) [53].

After the best model was selected, a repeated-measures 
ANOVA, with a within-subject factor Time (baseline, follow-
up) and a between-subject factor Trajectory, was performed 
to explore the differences in the depressive symptoms across 
trajectory groups. Additionally, to explore factors potentially 
associated with trajectories, one-way ANOVAs with Bon-
ferroni post hoc pairwise comparisons and Chi-square tests 
were conducted to compare the trajectories on demograph-
ics, COVID-19-related worries and actions, and other mental 
and behavioral health variables measured at the first wave 
of assessment. The Benjamini–Hochberg Procedure with a 

false discovery rate (FDR) of 15% was performed to control 
the FDR. Finally, predictors that significantly differed across 
trajectories groups were entered into a multinomial logistic 
regression simultaneously to examine their associations with 
trajectories. These analyses were performed by using SPSS 
version 26.0 [54].

Results

Trajectory Memberships

The model fit for one- to five-class models improved sig-
nificantly from one to four classes (Supplemental Table 2). 
Although the five-class model showed slightly better model 
fit indices than the four-class model, the improvement was 
minimal and insignificant. Going from the four-class model, 
the five-class model separated one class into two classes that 
shared similar patterns; thus, it was at higher risk of over-
extraction of classes and model instability. The four-class 
model was more parsimonious and aligned with the four 
theoretical trajectories of traumatic distress. Thus, we chose 
the four-class solution for further analyses.

Figure  1  depicts  the  four  trajectories  of  individuals’ 
symptom changes during the pandemic. The majority of 
the sample fit into the resilient trajectory (n = 104, 43.2%), 
characterized by absence of PTSD symptoms at both time-
points. The delayed group, accounting for 22.4% (n = 54) of 
the sample, showed low levels of PTSD symptoms at base-
line and high levels of PTSD symptoms at follow-up. In con-
trast, the recovered group (n = 47, 19.5%) initially reported 
high levels of PTSD symptoms at baseline and low levels of 
PTSD symptoms at follow-up, suggesting recovery. Finally, 
a minority of individuals (n = 36, 14.9%) reported high lev-
els of PTSD symptoms at both baseline and follow-up.

Although the main effect of time was not significant, F(1, 
237) = 1.44, p = 0.232, η2 = 0.006, suggesting no changes in

depressive symptoms from baseline to follow-up for the 
whole sample, the repeated-measures of ANOVA demon-
strated a significant main effect of trajectory group, F(3, 
237) = 30.84, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.281 and a significant interac-
tion between trajectory and time, F(3, 237) = 3.75, p = 0.012, 
η2 = 0.045. Bonferroni post hoc tests suggest that the recov-
ered and resilient groups reported significantly higher levels 
of depressive symptoms than the chronic and delayed groups 
(all p values < 0.001). Further, the recovered and resilient 
groups reported lower levels of depressive symptoms at 
follow-up than at baseline whereas the delayed and chronic 
groups evidenced the opposite change pattern.

Baseline Predictors of Trajectory Membership

The differences among the four theoretical trajectories in 
demographic variables, responses to COVID-19, and mental 
and behavioral health outcomes measured at the first wave 
of assessment are summarized in Supplemental Table 3. 
There were significant differences in hopelessness, coping 
strategies, and past 7-day alcohol use. To examine whether 
these variables uniquely predicted discrete theoretical tra-
jectories after controlling for other variables, all potential 
predictors were examined simultaneously in multinomial 
logistic regressions. Table 2 shows the odds ratios (ORs) for 
each variable in predicting resilient, recovered, and delayed 

versus chronic, recovered and delayed versus resilient, and 
delayed versus recovered group (comparisons were chosen 
to be conceptually meaningful). Individuals’ hopelessness 
and maladaptive coping were found to be unique and con-
sistent predictors of the four trajectories.

Chronic Versus Other Groups

Compared to the chronic group, individuals who were more 
hopeless (p = 0.015) and used more maladaptive coping 
strategies (p < 0.001) were less likely to be in the resilient 
compared to the chronic trajectory. Also, membership in the 
recovered trajectory was less likely among individuals with 
higher levels of hopelessness (p = 0.011). Individuals who 
used more maladaptive coping strategies were more likely to 
remain in the chronic than the delayed trajectory (p < 0.001).

Resilient Versus Recovered and Delayed

Compared  to  the  resilient  group,  individuals  who  were 
more hopeless were more likely to develop delayed dis-
tress (p = 0.003). The probability of being in the recovered 
trajectory versus the resilient trajectory was significantly 
higher among those who used more maladaptive coping  
strategies (p < 0.001).

Recovered Versus Delayed

Compared  to  the  recovered  group,  individuals  who  had 
higher levels of hopelessness and used fewer maladaptive 
coping strategies were more likely to belong to the delayed 
rather than the recovered trajectory.

Discussion

This study provides a preliminary understanding of trajec-
tories of psychological distress and resilience in the after-
math of the COVID-19 pandemic. Four change patterns of 
traumatic distress were identified: resilient (PTSD symp-
toms remained low); chronic (symptoms remained high); 
recovered (symptoms decreased from symptomatic levels 
to asymptomatic); and delayed (level of severity gradually 
increased from asymptomatic to symptomatic). These pat-
terns were consistent with the prototypical trajectories fol-
lowing PTEs [11], thus validating previous research that 
suggests heterogeneity in individuals’ distress and resilience 
during PTEs like the COVID-19 global pandemic. Further-
more, the chronic and delayed groups demonstrated higher 
levels of depressive symptoms, which increased over time, 
whereas the resilient and recovered groups evidenced lower 
levels of depressive symptoms, which decreased over time. 
These findings suggest that depression may be associated 
with, and affected by, traumatic distress, both chronic and 
delayed.

Our data suggest key predictors of psychological resil-
ience and distress as the crisis of the pandemic wanes. Mem-
bership in the resilient and recovered trajectory groups was 
associated with lower levels of hopelessness. Those in the 
resilient group also reported using fewer maladaptive coping 
strategies during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that 
for individuals who have initially high levels of distress, 
those with lower levels of hopelessness may be more likely 
to recover. Hopelessness was also a significant predictor 
of delayed distress. The identification of these predictors 
may help us understand how resilience and recovery were 
achieved and in turn, pertinent precautions can be taken for 
distressed individuals to reduce their distress.

Chronic and Delayed Distress

Although there were no reported cases of COVID-19 in 
the sample, nearly 40% of individuals showed chronic and 
delayed distress and about 20% experienced acute distress 
initially and then recovered. This suggests that the pandemic 
has likely caused severe psychological distress that varies 
in onset and duration. Notably, the current proportion of 

1 3

those in the delayed group (22.4%) was higher than the 
range (5–10%) typically observed in the aftermath of a PTE 
(5–10%) [11]. This may be because, in contrast to typical 
PTEs, pandemics are more prolonged and cause additional 
stressors  (e.g.,  financial  hardships),  potentially  leading 
to anticipatory anxiety and hopelessness for life after the 
pandemic. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic is more wide-
spread and prolonged than other modern pandemics, thus 
potentially affecting people’s ability to find hope.

Despite the decreasing daily new cases in China at the 
time of data collection, it remained unclear when the pan-
demic would end, and the risk of a future outbreak remained 
high. Indeed, hopelessness was prevalent in this sample 
and  was  a  consistent  predictor  of  distress,  both  chronic 
and delayed. Although hopelessness is a typical response 
to extreme adversity, it may lead to deteriorated function-
ing [55] due to worries about long-term negative implica-
tions for the future [56], which may then culminate in psy-
chological distress [56]. Hopeless individuals may be less 
motivated to actively cope with the destructive effects of the 
pandemic and less likely to show healthy adjustment [57], 
thereby potentially maintaining distress and even resulting 
in a delayed onset of distress. Given the current global con-
cerns about the variants (e.g., Delta) and new restrictions 
being put in place in China and elsewhere, we would antici-
pate that hopelessness might be even more prevalent today. 
Our data suggests that this is a sizable risk factor for poor 
mental health and that prevention and intervention efforts 
are needed.

Resilience and Recovery

Despite the severity and prolonged nature of the pandemic, 
the resilient trajectory was the most common outcome with 
over 40% of the sample showing minimal levels of distress 
and roughly 20% recovering from the initial distress in the 
aftermath of COVID-19. As with those in the more dis-
tressed trajectories, hope seems to be implicated in resilience 
and recovery. Both recovered and resilient individuals had 
lower hopelessness than chronic individuals, indicating that 
hope may not only be a buffer against acute distress but may 
also facilitate recovery. Given the protracted nature of the 
pandemic, it is challenging—and yet imperative—to retain 
some hope to avoid unremitting distress.

Coping  plays  an  important  role  in  the  psychological 
adjustment after a PTE [38]. Individuals who used fewer 
maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., denial and repression) 
were more likely to remain resilient. These maladaptive 
coping strategies serve as avoidance which may provide 
short-term relief from stressors but may, in the long-term, 
drain the amount of energy devoted to coping and hinder 
effective adjustment [38]. Our data suggest that avoidant 
coping strategies led to decrements in mental health during 

International Journal of Behavioral Medicine  (2022) 29:506–516

513

the COVID-19 lockdown [58]. Conversely, adaptive coping 
strategies were not associated with trajectories of distress, 
which is consistent with a previous meta-analysis [38]. In 
the face of such a significant and widespread PTE like a 
global pandemic, it may be hard to consistently use adap- 
tive coping. Coping strategies that were previously effec-
tive may not work in current pandemic due to its uncontrol-
lability and high levels of uncertainty [35]. Notably, this 
study only covered a relatively short timespan; the long-term 
positive effects of adaptive coping strategies may not have  
been  captured.  One  reason  for  this  may  be  that  specific 
strategies may be more or less effective. Recent research 
showed that socially supportive coping was associated with a 
faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms whereas 
problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies [58], which 
 are typically considered to be adaptive strategies, were not. 
More research is needed to help us understand the effects 
of different coping strategies and which are important for 
alleviating distress during the current pandemic as well as 
future public crises.

Comparing the currents trajectories to those identified in 
other countries and regions may facilitate our understanding 
of resilience and distress associated with major public health 
disasters. It is noteworthy that the current study identified 
lower rates of the resilient and recovered groups and higher 
rates of the delayed and chronic groups than other trajectory 
studies during the pandemic. This may be because the cur-
rent sample primarily comprised young adults, who have 
been found to be at higher risk of psychological distress 
than older people [59]. Additionally, this study specifically 
examined the trajectories of PTSD symptoms whereas other 
studies have included negative emotions like depression and 
anxiety in their trajectories. Although these symptoms often 
co-occur [16], changes in PTSD symptoms may be more 
similar to the theoretical trajectories of traumatic distress. 
Although  different  methods  have  been  used  to  examine 
mental health trajectories during the pandemic, our study 
and others have consistently demonstrated that individuals 
develop heterogenous patterns of distress and resilience. 
This finding highlights the need to take into account longer-
term mental health trajectories in prevention and interven-
tion efforts.

Implications

At the time of the study, China had entered a post-peak 
COVID-19 era and the long-term psychological effects of 
the pandemic, along with the effects of socially mediated 
events and containment efforts (e.g., grief and loss, manda-
tory quarantining, and reduced access to leisure activities) 
had begun to emerge. Currently, we are experiencing recent 
surges due to the COVID-19 variants and low vaccination 
rates globally, which has resulted in containment efforts in  

some areas, including portions of China. Unfortunately, this 
means we continue to need long-term follow-up to understand 
how the variants and low rates of vaccination worldwide  
— as well as the reinstitution of containment efforts — may 
be affecting mental health. Our findings that hope plays an 
important role in protecting against distress amplify the need 
to understand the impacts of potentially feeling hopeful due 
to a sense that the pandemic is over, and then the impacts of 
possible declines in hope/increases in hopelessness during 
the resurgences and in determining what the “new normal” 
is for the world.

Our findings have several implications specifically for 
researchers, public health officials, and healthcare prac-
titioners. First, our data suggest that reactions to a public 
mental health crisis can be accurately reflected by the four 
theoretical  trajectories  of  distress  following  PTEs.  This 
suggests that a one-size-fits-all policy may fail to address 
the complexities of people’s experiences. Practitioners and 
policy makers should be aware that there may not be one 
simple universal solution to protect at-risk populations and 
that both universal and tailored prevention and intervention 
efforts are needed. Access to supports such as counseling 
and community-based support groups should be promoted 
at the policy and population levels [60]. Published guide-
lines should also consider discrete intervention strategies 
tailored to the different subgroups of the population who 
may be at the highest risk. Secondly, hopelessness and cop-
ing appear to play key roles in responses to the pandemic and 
may provide important intervention targets in order to reduce 
maladaptive coping and help people find hope in highly 
stressful and uncertain situations. Providing accurate infor-
mation about the pandemic may also help reduce fears and 
worries. More research is needed to determine specifically 
what brings hope for people during the pandemic. Further, 
clear and accessible education on the virus, mitigation and 
prevention efforts, and risk factors are needed to help dis-
pel myths and unfounded worries. Finally, given that young 
adults have been found to be most affected by the pandemic, 
our findings may have unique implications for facilitating 
young adults’ adjustment.

Limitations and Future Directions

Despite multiple strengths—including a  prospective design 
and robust validated measures—this study has several limi-
tations. First, there were few demographic differences as 
the majority of participants were college students and thus 
largely homogenous. Despite this, we found that heterogene-
ity in responses to the pandemic in a relatively homogenous 
group is important. Future research should recruit partici-
pants with more diverse demographic and socio-economic 
backgrounds. Second, the current study examined trajecto-
ries based on two waves of data across 6 weeks. Although 

1 3

 
514

the LCGA can be used for exploring trajectories of two-point 
data and can minimize the risk of arbitrary and artificial 
manipulation that commonly occurs in the manual catego-
rization of trajectories [61], it implicitly assumes a linear 
change pattern. Ideal designs should examine individuals’ 
longer-term changes in distress and resilience with multiple 
waves of data—including after the end of the pandemic to 
explore nonlinear change patterns.

Third,  this  study  aimed  to  examine  how  individuals 
adapted to the pandemic and how reactions during the pan-
demic might predict resilience and distress. Although the 
longitudinal design allowed us to investigate the change 
patterns and explore predictors for change, it is unknown 
whether some predictors measured at baseline (e.g., eat-
ing  and  use  of  alcohol)  were  reactions  to  the  pandemic  
that may change over time or if they were pre-pandemic 
traits/behaviors/coping strategies. Prospective studies that 
measure  mental  health  prior  to  the  pandemic  may  con-
trol for the confounding effects and support the determin-
ing of causal associations [19]. Future studies could also 
investigate whether interventions addressing the identified 
predictors could effectively change individuals’  distress 
trajectories. Additionally, some predictors in the current  
study (e.g., eating behavior) were not assessed using vali-
dated scales but with a single item intended to capture per-
ceptions of behavioral change. Objective measures, along 
with  subjective  self-report  measures,  should  be  used  to 
increase external validity. Despite these limitations, as the 
pandemic is likely to last for months or even years glob-
ally, this study provides vital information for understand-
ing its longer-term effects on individuals’ behavioral and  
mental health.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the current study presents data on psycho-
logical distress and resilience in the face of a global pan-
demic. Individuals evidenced four theoretical trajectories 
of distress in the context of COVID-19: chronic, delayed, 
recovered, and resilient. Key factors associated with distress 
and resilience over time were coping strategies and hopeless-
ness. Being hopeful and using fewer maladaptive strategies 
can promote resilience and recovery. Nevertheless, more 
research is needed to understand the underlying processes 
that contribute to resilience and distress. Notably, a not 
insignificant proportion of this sample appeared to be fairly 
resilient and able to maintain some sense of hope despite the 
uncertainty and high levels of stress related to this pandemic.
