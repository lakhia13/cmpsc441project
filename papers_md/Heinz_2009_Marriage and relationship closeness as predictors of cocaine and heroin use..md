Abstract

Marriage has been cited as a protective factor against drug use, but the relationship between marriage
and drug use has not been explored longitudinally during addiction treatment. The current study
assessed individual trajectories of substance use during treatment as a function of marital status and
perceived closeness of the marital relationship. A parallel-process growth model was used to (1)
estimate the rate of change in percentage of cocaine-positive and heroin-positive urine samples, and
(2) examine the relationship between marital status and drug use trajectories over 35 weeks, during
and after treatment. Percent days of use for both drugs were lowest for married participants across
all time points. Among married participants, reporting a close relationship with one’s partner
predicted less cocaine and heroin use. These findings suggest that being married and having a close
relationship with one’s spouse are associated with better outcomes over time. The causal nature of
the association is suggested by previous research that has demonstrated the effectiveness of couples
therapy as an adjunct to methadone maintenance.

Office of National Drug Control Policy, 2001). The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol
and Related Conditions showed that approximately two percent of adult Americans
experienced a drug-use disorder in the past year (2001- 2002) and 10.3 experienced a drug-use
disorder during their lifetimes (Compton, Thomas, Stinson, & Grant, 2007). Given the low rate
of recovery among individuals with chronic drug-use disorders (e.g., Hser, Anglin, & Powers,
1993; O’Donnell, 1972), it is important to determine factors that may facilitate recovery. One
such factor, social support, has been shown to predict a variety of positive treatment outcomes
in substance-abuse programs, including greater treatment retention (Dobkin, De Civita,
Paraherakis, & Gill, 2002), lower rates of relapse (Havassy, Wasserman, & Hall, 1995), and
greater subjective well-being (Beattie & Longabaugh, 1997).

Long-term committed relationships, such as marriage, provide the primary form of social
support for many individuals. Unfortunately, researchers have found that substance use is
related to divorce or separation (Lex, 1994) and remaining unmarried (Kaestner, 1997).
Interestingly, epidemiological data provides evidence to suggest that married individuals are
much less likely to use illicit drugs. For example, Merline and colleagues (2004) analyzed rates
of drug use among 35-year-old adults in the Monitoring the Future study and found that married
individuals were significantly less likely to use cocaine than unmarried individuals: 3.8% of
married men and 2.0% of married women reported cocaine use, whereas 11.4% of unmarried
men and 5.1% of unmarried women reported cocaine use.

Perhaps more important is the possibility that marriage may serve as a protective factor among
those who have already initiated drug use. In an investigation of 8,427 patients who received
substance-abuse treatment through the Department of Veterans Affairs, being married was
significantly related to stable or improved outcomes after treatment (Moos, Nichol, & Moos
(2002). In contrast, patients who were not married were significantly more likely to experience
symptom exacerbation over time. Cessation of cocaine use has also been shown to be
significantly related to marital status; in a community sample, cessation of cocaine use was
three times more common among married individuals than among unmarried individuals
(White & Bates, 1995). As such, marital status may be a proxy for improved treatment outcome.
Additionally, it may also be useful in determining which elements of the relationship contribute
to the above described pattern. In turn, this knowledge may inform interventions and allow
researchers to prospectively evaluate the direction of any causal relationships between drug
use and marital status.

Different types and definitions of social support may be related to treatment outcomes in
different ways. Structural social support represents the extent of supportive resources (Beattie,
2001) whereas functional social support is defined as the perceived or actual support received
(Dobkin et al., 2002). The quality of the marital relationship (a form of functional social
support) may be at least as important a predictor of treatment outcome as marital status per
se (a form of structural social support). In the alcohol-research literature, low marital
satisfaction has been shown to predict poor treatment outcomes (Beattie, 2001; McCrady,
Epstein & Sell, 2003), whereas marital happiness predicts optimal treatment outcomes
(McCrady, Epstein, & Kahler, 2004). Promotion of marital satisfaction through couples therapy
with substance abusers has been shown to reduce drug use, increase treatment retention, and
promote better dyadic adjustment (e.g., Epstein, & McCrady, 1998; Fals-Stewart, Birchler, &
O’Farrell, 1996; O’Farrell, & Falls-Stewart, 2000; Winters, Fals-Stewart, O’Farrell, Birchler,
& Kelley, 2002). Thus, it appears that higher levels of extant marital satisfaction, or increases
in marital satisfaction achieved through counseling, are associated with better treatment
outcomes. Findings from these studies collectively warrant further exploration of the observed
associations between spousal relationships and maintenance of substance use and/or recovery.

Despite the extensive body of literature on alcoholism and marriage, there is little research on
the relationship between marital status and opiate and cocaine use during treatment. Several
researchers (e.g., McCrady, 2004; Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2005) posit that such relationships
should be investigated at the level of the individual substance user because traditional analytical
methods often fail to account for individual heterogeneity. Therefore, the goal of the current
study was to test whether individual trajectories of cocaine and heroin use during treatment are
predicted by marital status and by the perceived closeness (i.e., functional social support) of
the marital relationship. Based on previous epidemiological data, as well as the extant literature
from the alcohol field, we predicted that married individuals would have significantly better
outcomes than nonmarried individuals and that closeness of the marital relationship would
account for additional variance in outcome among those participants who were married.
Furthermore, we examined whether being in a domestic partnership (i.e., living together, but
not married) resulted in better outcomes, compared to being single or separated.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

The current study is a secondary analysis of pooled data from three consecutively run clinical
trials involving contingency management (CM) and methadone maintenance (Epstein,
Schmittner, Schroeder, & Preston, 2003; Preston, Ghitza, Schmittner, Schroeder, & Epstein,
in press; Ghitza, Epstein, Schmittner, Vahabzadeh, Lin, & Preston, in press). Across the three
trials, 635 cocaine-abusing, opiate-dependent individuals were enrolled in a methadone-
maintenance outpatient treatment program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse in
Baltimore, Maryland between the years of 2000 and 2006. Participants qualified for enrollment
if they were between the ages of 21 and 65 and seeking treatment for cocaine abuse and opiate
dependence. Exclusion criteria were: current psychotic, bipolar, or major depressive disorders,
current physical dependence on alcohol or sedatives, unstable serious medical illness, estimated
IQ below 80, and urologic conditions precluding urine collection. For the present analyses,
data from 70 participants were excluded due to missing data.

2.2 Instruments

Demographic information including marital status and living arrangements along with several
relationship variables were derived from the Addiction Severity index (ASI; McLellan,
Luborsky, Cacciola, Griffith, Evans, Barr, et al., 1985). The participant’s relationship status
with sexual partner/spouse was assessed with the item, “Would you say that you have had a
close, long-lasting, personal relationships with your sexual partner/spouse?” to which the
participant responded “yes,” “no,” “I don’t know,” or “Not relevant.”

Urinalysis assays were conducted with an Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique
(EMIT; Syva Corp., Palo Alto, CA) which provided qualitative results (i.e., positive/negative
for the presence of drug or metabolite at the concentration cutoff of 300 ng/ml) for cocaine
(benzoylecgonine equivalents) and opiate (morphine) use. The mean percentage of scheduled
specimens collected was 75% ± 1.7% (range 46% to 98%).

2.3 Procedure

All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation. During initial assessment,
all participants underwent a thorough evaluation, overseen by a licensed medical doctor,
including a detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests of blood and urine,
electrocardiogram, administration of the ASI (McLellan et al., 1985), and several standardized
psychiatric and cognitive assessments and were then enrolled in methadone maintenance
treatment. The duration of each of the three clinical trials was 35 weeks, and each consisted of
4 distinct phases: Pre-Intervention Baseline maintenance (5 weeks), Intervention (12 weeks,

CM in effect), Post-Intervention Maintenance (8 weeks, CM discontinued), and Methadone
Dose Taper (10 weeks). Throughout the study, all participants received daily oral methadone
from registered nurses and were required to attend weekly sessions of individual drug
counseling conducted by licensed therapists. At the end of the Post-Intervention Maintenance,
participants were encouraged to and assisted in transferring to a community treatment program;
the 10-week methadone taper was provided to those participants who chose not to enter another
maintenance program.

To measure drug use, urine specimens were collected under direct staff supervision thrice
weekly for the first 25 weeks (Baseline, Intervention, Maintenance) and weekly for the last ten
weeks of the study (Methadone Dose Taper). During the Intervention Phase, participants were
randomly assigned to a CM schedule reinforcing drug abstinence (reinforcers were delivered
for cocaine and/or heroin negative urine specimens) or to a noncontingent control condition in
which reinforcers were given independent of urine cocaine and heroin drug screens. Briefly,
depending on the trial, reinforcers for abstinence were awarded in the form of a monetary
stipend or with vouchers or prizes that could be “won” though a drawing system. The current
analyses also include participants who were excluded from randomization in the original three
studies due to their not having met prespecified criteria for number of drug-positive urines
during the first five weeks of treatment (Baseline). These participants received noncontingent
reinforcers during the Intervention Phase. Participants were considered completers if they
reached the last week of the Maintenance phase, after which they were encouraged to transfer
to a community methadone program (as noted above).

2.4 Data Analyses

Demographic information and drug use history were drawn from the ASI. A percentage,
representing amount of cocaine and heroin positive urine samples, was calculated in one month
intervals. The number of cocaine and heroin positive urine samples was divided by the total
number of urine samples collected within the respective month, and these variables were used
as observed indicators for both cocaine and heroin growth models. The program Mplus version
4.1 (Muthén & Muthén, 2004) was used to estimate all models. Mplus utilizes the expectation-
maximization algorithm (EM; Allison, 2002) to obtain maximum-likelihood estimation with
robust standard errors (MLR). MLR generates the most likely parameters given the variances
and covariances of the observed data and is a widely accepted approach for handling missing
data, when data are missing at random (MAR; Little & Rubin, 2002; Muthén & Shedden,
1999). To test whether missing data influenced our dependent variables in a non-ignorable
manner, cocaine and heroin slope factors from the latent growth model were regressed on
binary missing variables at each time point. Results indicated that missing data at months 5
and 6 influenced the slope for heroin use (β = .39, p < .05 & β = .22, p < .05, respectively), but
not cocaine use. That is, participants with incomplete data at months 5 and 6 had more heroin
use over time. Hence, in subsequent analyses, “missing” at months 5 and 6 was explicitly
modeled to control for its influence on heroin trajectories (Little, 1995).

With the positive urine samples from baseline and months 1-7 as the observed indicators, three
latent growth factors were then estimated: (a) intercept (i.e., percent positive urine at baseline),
(b) linear slope (i.e., linear rate of change), and (c) quadratic slope (i.e., non-linear rate of
change). Analyses comparing deviance values of an unconditional linear latent growth model
to a quadratic latent growth model indicated that the quadratic model fit significantly better
than the linear model, χ2Δ (2 df) = 526.98. Individuals were allowed to vary in intercepts and
linear slopes so that these growth factors could be regressed on covariates. Variance of the
quadratic slope, however, was fixed at zero (i.e., no random effect for quadratic slope) in order
for the models to converge. Because participants reported high levels of both cocaine and heroin
use coming into the study, we expected a robust association between cocaine and heroin use

throughout the study period. Thus, cocaine and heroin slopes were simultaneously estimated
and correlated with one another to test the extent to which the trajectories of the two drugs
influenced each other (Muthén & Muthén, 2004).

To determine whether a term for CM treatment group (control, cocaine contingent, split
contingent) needed to be included in our models, we regressed cocaine and heroin intercept
and linear slope growth factors on CM treatment, while controlling for several baseline
covariates: (a) age, (b) gender, (c) race, (d) years of education, (e) income, and (f) years of
cocaine and heroin use. Dummy variable coding was used to compare the control group vs.
the cocaine contingent and split contingent groups. Although inclusion of a quadratic improved
model fit, it was not regressed on any covariates because the residual variance was not
significant.

Lastly, marital status was coded as 0 = single and not living with partner, 1 = single or separated
but living with partner, 2 = married, 3 = separated and not living with partner. A latent growth
model was estimated with marital status as a set of dummy-coded variables to examine the
impact of marriage on cocaine and heroin trajectories. In addition, age, gender, income, years
of education, years of cocaine and heroin use, and CM treatment were included as control
variables. To further assess the role of marriage on outcomes, a “close and personal relationship
with partner” variable (CPR; from the Family/Social Relationships section of the ASI) was
included in the model. The CPR variable was nominally coded as 0 or 1; “1” indicated a
fulfilling, close, and personal relationship with one’s partner whereas “0” indicated the
opposite. Hence, a negative regression coefficient between a CPR variable and cocaine or
heroin slope would mean that having a close and personal relationship predicted less drug use
over time.

Finally, an interaction term was created for marital status by CPR, and growth factors were
also regressed on this term. This interaction variable (8 groups; single and no CPR, single and
yes CPR, living with partner and no CPR, living with partner and yes CPR, married and no
CPR, married and yes CPR, separated and no CPR, separated and yes CPR) was created by
combining the marital status variable (4 groups; single, living with partner, married, and
separated) with the CPR variable (2 groups; yes and no CPR with partner). A significant
regression coefficient would indicate that marital status and CPR were synergistic predictors
of cocaine and heroin outcomes.

Participants’ mean age was 41.9 (7.9), and the majority were African-American (57%) and
male (54%). The mean number of days of cocaine and heroin use in the past month was 17.6
(9.8) and 29.2 (3.7), respectively. Thirty-five percent of the sample was employed full time (n
= 196), 43% were unemployed (n = 245), 20% reported working part-time (n = 110), and 2%
were retired or on disability (n = 13). Further descriptive information for the sample is provided
in Table 1. As expected, cocaine and heroin slopes were correlated with each other, r = .32,
p < .01. At baseline, percentage of positive urine samples was 72% for cocaine and 64% for
heroin. During months 1-3 (i.e., intervention), percentage of positive urine samples decreased
for cocaine by 8%, although this reduction in use was not significant (slope = -2.67, p = .37),
and significantly decreased for heroin by 20% (slope = -5.47, p < .01). During months 4-7 (i.e.,
maintenance and the first 8 weeks of the methadone taper), percentage of positive urine samples
steadily increased for cocaine and averaged 78% by the end of the methadone taper. Likewise,
percentage of heroin-positive urine samples increased during months 4-7 and averaged 73%
by the end of the methadone taper.

Figures 1 and 2 display estimated cocaine and heroin trajectories as a function of marital status.
Of our 565 participants, 36% of the participants were single, 29% were living with a partner,
14% were married, and 32% were separated. Examination of both cocaine and heroin
trajectories revealed that married participants had the most favorable substance-use outcomes
over time. For cocaine use, single participants started at 78% positive urine and increased to
80%, participants living with a partner started at 75% and increased to 86%, and separated
participants started at 70% and increased to 74%. Married participants, however, started at
68% and decreased to 57%. For heroin use, single participants started at 74% positive urine
and decreased to 68%, participants living with a partner started at 73% and decreased to 72%,
and separated participants started at 58% and increased to 66%. Married participants, however,
started at 57% and decreased to 45%.

Table 2 presents the beta coefficients of cocaine and heroin slopes regressed on demographic
variables, CM treatment, and the main effects of marital status and CPR (interaction terms are
not included but are described below). Significance was determined by a p-value of less than .
05. For demographic variables, only income and years of cocaine use were significant
predictors of drug use, such that higher income predicted a higher heroin intercept (β = .09)
and more years of cocaine use predicted a higher cocaine intercept (β = .12). In regard to CM
treatment variables, the only significant difference detected was between the cocaine
contingent group and the control group, such that the cocaine contingent group had a lower
cocaine intercept (β = -.18). Several comparisons showed significant differences for main
effects of marital status: (a) married participants had a more negative cocaine slope than single
participants (β = -.12) and participants living with a partner (β = -.19), and (b) separated
participants had a lower heroin intercept than participants living with a partner (β = -.11). There
was no main effect of CPR in either the cocaine or heroin models.

Lastly, to determine if cocaine and heroin growth factors differed across marital status as a
function of having a close and personal relationship with one’s partner, an interaction term
between marital status and CPR was added to both the cocaine and heroin latent growth models,
while also controlling for demographic and CM treatment variables. Income, years of cocaine
use, and cocaine contingent group versus control all remained significant predictors of drug-
use growth factors. Nine interactions were found to be significant at the α = .05 level: (a)
Married and “yes CPR” participants had a more negative cocaine slope than single and “yes
CPR” participants (β = -.14), living-with-partner and “yes CPR” participants (β = -.21), and
married and “no CPR” participants (β = -.47). In addition, married and “yes CPR” participants
also had a more negative heroin slope than separated and “yes CPR” participants (β = -.16);
(b) Married and “no CPR” participants had a more positive cocaine slope than single and “no
CPR” participants (β = .12); (c) Separated and “no CPR” participants had a lower cocaine
intercept than single and “yes CPR” participants (β = -.11) and living-with-partner and “no
CPR” participants (β = -.18). In addition, separated and “no CPR” participants also had a more
negative cocaine slope than married and “no CPR” participants (β = -.31); (d) lastly,
participants living with partner and “yes CPR” had a more positive cocaine slope than single
and “no CPR” participants (β = .19).

4. Discussion

The primary objective of substance-abuse treatment and its associated outcome research has
been to promote and maintain abstinence using various combinations of psychological and
pharmacological treatments. However, given the usually chronic nature of addiction, it is also
important to focus on protective factors that may facilitate lasting change. One such factor,
social support, has been indicated in improved substance-use outcomes. Further, the quality of
social support in a marital relationship (i.e., functional social support) has been associated with
substance-use outcomes in important and meaningful ways. Less is known, though, regarding

how substance-use outcomes are affected by the quality of the relationship. Using latent growth
modeling, the present study investigated how substance use during treatment was related to
marital status and perceived closeness of personal relationships. For both cocaine and heroin
use, the outcome trajectories were most favorable (i.e., fewer days of positive cocaine and/or
heroin urine samples) for married participants across the 35-week studies. The results of the
interaction between marital status and having a close and personal relationship with one’s
partner suggest that being married predicts a greater decrease in cocaine and heroin use over
time, relative to being single, being separated, or cohabiting. This is only true, however, for
married couples who have a close and personal relationship with each other. In the absence of
a close and personal relationship with a partner, being separated actually predicted more
favorable cocaine outcomes over time, rather than being married, single, or cohabiting.

To our knowledge, no prior studies have explicitly examined the link between marital status
and polysubstance use using longitudinal data and a person-centered approach. Our findings
are also important as they are among the first to suggest a potentially significant influence of
marriage on treatment-outcome trajectories for both heroin and cocaine use. Moreover, our
findings suggest that the quality of the marital relationship is particularly important for
predicting substance use. Not only does being married and satisfied (i.e., having a close and
personal relationship) appear to be a protective factor against relapse during treatment, it also
predicts better substance use outcomes compared than being single, separated, or living with
a partner and having a close and personal relationship. Further support for the potential benefits
of marital counseling in conjunction with methadone maintenance is also warranted. Indeed,
a great deal of research has been conducted to determine the effectiveness of family and couples
therapy for substance abusers (see Stanton & Shadish, 1997). Within the context of methadone
maintenance, Fals-Stewart, O’Farrell, and Birchler, (2001) found that male patients assigned
to behavioral couples therapy reported greater reductions in drug use and higher dyadic
adjustment compared to patients who received twice-weekly individual counseling. Some
therapeutic implications may be derived from the finding that separated and single participants
with no close and personal relationship had more negative cocaine slopes compared to married
participants with no close and personal relationship. Specifically, one may speculate that in
the absence of a close and personal marital relationship, separation may increase the chances
for a better treatment outcome.

Some limitations should be mentioned. Firstly, our reliance on one dichotomous measure as a
proxy for relationship closeness poses a serious limitation. Relationship quality and dyadic
adjustment are complex constructs that are typically assessed with a battery of measures. Future
research is therefore needed to assess the relationship between multiple dimensions of
relationship quality and polysubstance use over time. Another substantial limitation in the
present study was the lack of information pertaining to partner substance use: being married
to a nonuser has been shown to predict more positive treatment outcomes (Beattie, 2001). The
current study also did not assess outcome post treatment. To provide a more complete picture
of drug-use patterns as they may relate to protective factors, it is important that future studies
examine drug use after counseling and medication administration have ceased. There is a
possibility that the current findings were affected by selective attrition (e.g., more unhappily
married individuals dropped out of treatment). The small number of married individuals (n =
77, 14%) may have been insufficient to detect an effect of worse outcomes among unhappily
married individuals, which has been shown in previous studies (Beattie, 2001; McCrady,
Epstein, & Sell, 2003). Our data are correlational, precluding firm conclusions about whether
marital factors caused better drug-use outcomes or whether they only served as markers for
other causal variables. That is, participants who are able to maintain a marriage may be different
from those who are not married on a number of other characteristics. Lastly, no data were
