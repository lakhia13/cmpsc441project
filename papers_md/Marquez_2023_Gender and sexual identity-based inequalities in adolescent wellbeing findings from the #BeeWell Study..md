Abstract
Background  Gender and sexual minority adolescents experience greater symptoms of psychological distress than 
their peers, but little is known about broader aspects of their wellbeing. This study examines wellbeing inequalities 
relating to gender and sexual identity among adolescents from Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom.

Method  37,978 adolescents (aged 12–15, attending 165 secondary schools) completed surveys of life satisfaction, 
positive and negative affect (hedonic framework); autonomy, self-esteem, optimism, and positive relationships 
(eudaimonic framework); and, symptoms of distress and mental wellbeing (complete state framework). Structural 
correlated factors models were used to assess gender and sexual identity wellbeing inequalities.

Results  The magnitude of wellbeing inequalities pertaining to gender and sexual identity were routinely 
substantially greater than those concerning other characteristics (e.g., socio-economic disadvantage). Gender identity 
wellbeing inequalities followed a consistent pattern, with the largest disparities evident between gender diverse 
adolescents and boys. Sexual identity wellbeing inequalities also followed a consistent pattern, with the largest 
disparities evident between sexual minority youth (both gay/lesbian and bi/pansexual) and their heterosexual peers. 
Finally, variation was evident across wellbeing domains. For example, observed gender identity (boys vs. girls) and 
sexual identity (heterosexual vs. sexual minority) disparities were substantially greater for symptoms of distress than 
for mental wellbeing in the complete state model.

Conclusions  LGBTQ + adolescents experience lower wellbeing than their peers, and this is evident across a range 
of wellbeing domains. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for the prioritisation of improved prevention and 
intervention efforts that can better meet the needs of gender diverse and sexual minority youth, and future research 
should be conducted to improve understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the wellbeing inequalities 
observed.

Introduction
Inequalities  are  systematic,  avoidable  and  unfair  dif-
ferences  in  outcomes  between  different  populations 
or  groups  [1].  In  this  paper  we  focus  on  inequalities  in 
adolescent  wellbeing  across  gender  and  sexual  identity. 
While much is known about this topic in relation to other 
characteristics  such  as  age,  socio-economic  status,  eth-
nicity and binary categorisations of gender and sex [2–4], 
our understanding of the nature and magnitude of well-
being  disparities  between  gender/sexual  minority  youth 
and  their  peers  remains  limited,  especially  in  early  ado-
lescence  [5].  This  is  an  important  research  problem  to 
address  given  that  this  is  the  developmental  stage  when 
young  people  develop  their  gender  and  sexuality  identi-
ties [6], and wellbeing in this period is known to impact 
outcomes across the lifespan [7].

What do we mean by wellbeing?

A  critical  starting  point  is  the  lack  of  a  universally 
accepted definition of wellbeing in the contemporary lit-
erature [8–10]. It is often conjoined or used interchange-
ably  with  ‘mental  health’  [11,  12],  a  term  that  similarly 
eludes  precise  definition  [13].  Being  precise  about  the 
particular  domains  and  theory  that  are  considered  in  a 
given  wellbeing  study  is  therefore  critical  to  further  our 
understanding.  A  number  of  conceptual  frameworks  of 
wellbeing  have  been  developed.  The  hedonic  approach 
(also  referred  to  as  subjective  wellbeing)  operationalises 
wellbeing  as  comprising  affective  (positive  and  negative 
affect)  and  cognitive  (life  satisfaction)  components,  and 
emphasizes ‘feeling good’. The eudaimonic approach (also 
referred to as psychological wellbeing) can include auton-
omy, environmental mastery, optimism, personal growth, 
positive  relations  with  others,  purpose  in  life,  and  self-
acceptance, and emphasizes ‘flourishing’ [14]. Finally, the 
complete  state  approach  (also  known  as  the  dual  factor/
continuua or complete mental health model) focuses on 
the balance between mental wellbeing and symptoms of 
distress, emphasizing the presence of positive states and 
absence  of  symptoms  [15].  Research  that  draws  upon 
these  wellbeing  frameworks  has  proliferated  in  recent 
years, though to our knowledge, the current study is the 
first to apply them systematically to advance understand-
ing of inequalities in adolescence.

Wellbeing in adolescence: what do we know?

Adolescence,  which  begins  around  age  10,  is  marked  by 
significant  hormonal,  physical,  neurobiological,  psycho-
logical,  social,  and  environmental  changes  [16],  and  is  a 
period  that  confers  significant  vulnerability  in  certain 
aspects  of  wellbeing  [17].  Wellbeing  starts  to  decline  in 
the transition from childhood to adolescence [2]. Adoles-
cence is also the time when the prevalence of significant 
mental  health  difficulties  increases  markedly  [18],  and 

the majority of lifetime cases of mental ill health manifest 
by  the  age  of  24,  with  a  peak  age  of  onset  of  14.5  years 
[19].

Current national data indicates that 17.7% of 11-to-16 
year-olds  in  England  have  a  probable  mental  health  dis-
order  [20].  While  concerning,  these  figures  do  however 
make  clear  the  need  to  also  capture  data  on  wellbeing 
indicators  in  population  mental  health  research  [21]. 
Aside  from  the  alignment  with  the  theoretical  frame-
works outlined above, gathering data on both symptoms 
of  distress  and  broader  wellbeing  likely  captures  greater 
variability than is possible with a solely symptom-driven 
approach,  because  while  most  individuals  are  asymp-
tomatic,  there  remains  considerable  variability  in  life 
satisfaction and other such indicators [22]. Furthermore, 
concerning  trends  have  been  observed  in  relation  to 
these data in multiple countries [23–25], including a clear 
decline  in  adolescent  life  satisfaction  in  the  UK  in  the 
decade from 2009 to 2019 [24], with the four UK nations 
leading  a  worldwide  decline  between  2015  and  2018 
[25]. Given that wellbeing in adolescence is predictive of 
adult  wellbeing,  labour  market/socioeconomic,  physical 
health/health  behaviour,  and  relational  outcomes  [7],  it 
is  vital  that  we  understand  more  about  what  is  clearly  a 
critical period.

What do we mean by gender and sexual identity?

Similar  to  wellbeing,  gender  and  sexuality  concepts 
and  terms  can  be  challenging  to  define,  are  not  univer-
sally  agreed  upon,  often  are  used  interchangeably,  and 
reflect  a  range  of  meanings.  Accordingly,  we  clarify  our 
intended usage/meaning of them for the reader. First, we 
distinguish  between  sex  (classification  as  male,  female, 
or  intersex,  on  the  basis  of  biological/chromosomal  fac-
tors) and gender (the socially and culturally constructed 
norms,  behaviours,  characteristics  and  roles  associated 
with  being  male,  female,  or  somewhere  outside  of  this 
basic binary) [26, 27]. When referring to gender identity, 
we mean the feeling or sense of oneself as being female, 
male, a blend of both, or neither [26, 28]. Thus, sex and 
gender  interact  but  are  different  [28].  To  aid  clarity  and 
precision, throughout the article we use male and female 
when referring to sex, and boy, girl, and terms reflecting 
the  non-binary  nature  of  gender  (gender  diverse)  when 
referring  to  gender  identity.  Following  Ashley  [29],  we 
also  use  the  term  gender  modality,  which  refers  to  how 
an individual’s gender identity stands in relation to their 
assignment as male or female at birth, making two clas-
sifications:  cisgender  (where  these  correspond)  and 
transgender  (where  these  do  not  correspond).  Finally, 
we make reference to sexual identity, by which we mean 
how an individual thinks of themselves in terms of their 
emotional,  romantic  and/or  sexual  attraction  to  other 
people,  often  categorised  in  relation  to  the  gender/sex 

Marquez et al. BMC Public Health         (2023) 23:2211 Page 3 of 19

classifications  noted  above  [30].  At  the  outset,  we  note 
that  categorising  adolescents  in  terms  of  their  gender 
and sexuality is challenging as this is a life stage in which 
identities  are  developing  [6],  and  we  also  acknowledge 
that there are other valid ways to categorise young people 
according to their gender and sexuality that can provide 
useful research insights [31, 32].

Wellbeing among gender and sexual minority adolescents: 
what do we know?

Minority  stress  theory  [33]  suggests  adolescents  who 
are  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender  or  questioning 
(LGBTQ+) are likely to experience lower wellbeing than 
their  peers.  It  predicts  adverse  health  outcomes  among 
gender  and  sexual  minority  youth  as  a  result  of  excess 
stress  emanating  from  experiences  of  prejudice,  dis-
crimination, sexual identity concealment, expectations of 
rejection,  and  internalised  stigma  [34–36].  This  may  be 
compounded  by  punitive  and  traumatic  reactions  from 
parents  and  caregivers  in  response  to  their  children’s 
identity [37].

There is evidence of marked inequalities in relation to 
gender  and  sexual  identity  for  certain  adolescent  well-
being  indicators,  specifically  those  pertaining  to  men-
tal  health  difficulties.  For  example,  a  systematic  review 
by  Plöderl  and  Tremblay  [5]  revealed  elevated  risks  for 
depression,  anxiety,  suicide  attempts  or  suicides  among 
sexual minority adolescents (e.g., those who are attracted 
to  the  same  or  both  sexes).  In  a  recent  illustrative  case, 
Amos et al’s [38] national cohort study in the UK found 
that  sexual  minority  adolescents  were  more  than  five 
times more likely than their heterosexual peers to experi-
ence  high  depressive  symptoms.  Additionally,  a  system-
atic  review  by  Connolly  et  al.  [39]  revealed  significantly 
higher rates of depression, suicidality, self-harm and eat-
ing disorders among transgender youth when compared 
to their cisgender peers.

In  considering  inequalities  pertaining  to  gender  iden-
tity,  it  is  important  not  to  overlook  those  between  boys 
and  girls.  A  major  international  analysis  (> 500,000  ado-
lescents, > 70 countries) by Campbell et al. [4] found con-
sistent  evidence  of  substantial  inequalities  in  relation  to 
indicators of symptoms of distress, life satisfaction, hedo-
nia and eudaimonia, with girls reporting worse outcomes 
than  boys  in  all  cases.  There  are  multiple  sociocultural, 
psychological,  and  biological  factors  underpinning  such 
findings, which likely operate in parallel to create chronic 
stress  for  girls  [40].  Among  these  factors,  gender  norms 
(e.g.,  the  implicit  ‘rules’  that  guide  which  attributes  and 
behaviours  are  valued  and  accepted  for  boys  and  girls) 
may be particularly important, as those adopted in ado-
lescence  arguably  reflect  and  reinforce  inequitable  hier-
archies, with concurrent and consequent negative effects 
on  girls’  health  and  wellbeing  theorised  to  operate  via 

differential  risk  factor  exposures,  health-related  behav-
iours, and access to care [41–43].

The current study

Building  on  the  above,  we  sought  to  examine  wellbe-
ing inequalities relating to gender and sexual identity by 
leveraging  analysis  of  a  unique  contemporary  adoles-
cent  dataset  from  a  project  known  as  #BeeWell,  which 
we  describe  in  more  detail  in  the  following  section  (see 
Method). We aim to provide a deeper, more rigorous, and 
nuanced  analysis  of  the  nature  and  scale  of  adolescent 
wellbeing inequalities than has been possible to date, by 
moving  beyond  those  that  pertain  directly  to  symptoms 
of  distress  (which  have  dominated  the  literature  consid-
ering gender and sexual identity [44]). Moreover, noting a 
critical concern expressed by Green et al. [45], we analyse 
data  on  sexual  identity  and  gender  identity  (with  there 
having  being  large  gaps  in  relation  to  the  latter  in  the 
extant  literature),  permitting  more  granular,  segmented 
analyses  than  are  currently  evident.  Furthermore,  not-
ing  that  a  growing  number  of  young  people  report  gen-
der diverse identities that differ from social and cultural 
norms  relating  to  rigid,  binary  constructs  (e.g.,  boys  vs. 
girls [46]), we use a contemporary dataset in which this is 
more accurately reflected. Finally, given that the majority 
of  studies  of  this  kind  are  US-based  and  typically  focus 
on the latter stages of adolescence (e.g., only 15% of stud-
ies  in  the  aforementioned  review  by  Plöderl  and  Trem-
blay  [5]  were  based  in  Europe,  and  most  studies  in  the 
adolescent  tranche  included  participants  aged  16+),  we 
aim to update and extend the evidence base to England, 
in relation to one of the most neglected stages of devel-
opment: early adolescence [47].

In  sum,  the  aim  of  the  current  study  is  to  establish 
the  nature  and  magnitude  of  early  adolescent  wellbeing 
inequalities, with a particular focus on gender and sexual 
identity. The  research  questions  (RQs)  driving  the  study 
are as follows.

  • RQ1: What is the nature and magnitude of 

adolescent wellbeing inequalities pertaining to 
gender and sexual identity?

  • RQ2: Are there any consistent patterns pertaining 
to the nature and magnitude of gender identity 
wellbeing inequalities?

  • RQ3: Are there any consistent patterns pertaining 
to the nature and magnitude of sexual identity 
wellbeing inequalities?

  • RQ4: Does the nature and magnitude of adolescent 
sexual identity wellbeing inequalities vary by how 
gender identity is categorised (i.e., by gender identity 
vs. gender modality)?

  • RQ5: Do adolescent gender and sexual identity 

wellbeing inequalities vary across frameworks and 
domains (e.g., hedonic, eudaimonic, complete state)?

Design

#BeeWell  uses  a  hybrid  population  cohort  study  design 
[48],  comprising  two  main  elements:  (i)  a  longitudi-
nal  study  in  which  participants  are  tracked  with  annual 
data points from age 12–15 (e.g. from Year 8 to Year 9 to 
Year 10 of secondary school; Sample 1); and, (ii) a serial 
cross-sectional  study  comprising  annual  data  points  for 
participants aged 14–15 (e.g. those in Year 10 of second-
ary school at a given data point; Sample 2). Our analysis 
draws  on  the  first  annual  wave  of  #BeeWell  data  collec-
tion (Autumn 2021), combining data from Samples 1 and 
2.  Further  information  about  the  #BeeWell  study,  data-
set, and publications can be found on the project website 
(www.beewellprogramme.org).

the Greater Manchester city-region are represented in the 
study (63% of all secondary education settings in Greater 
Manchester  in  2021).  A  total  of  N = 37,  978  adolescents

represents more than 50% of all young people in eligible 
year  groups  (i.e.  Years  8  and  10)  living  in  Greater  Man-
chester  in  2021,  was  made  possible  by  the  outstanding 
support offered by project partner organisations, partici-
pating schools, and their pupils. In relation to the latter, 
the  extensive  consultation  process  undertaken  during 
the  #BeeWell  survey  design  phase  should  also  be  noted 
(outlined  below  in  the  Measures  subsection),  given  the 
considerable  effort  undertaken  to  produce  a  survey  that 
was relevant, meaningful, and accessible to young people. 
More  details  about  the  study  sample  are  presented  in 
Table 1.

Measures
Gender and sexual identity

Items  pertaining  to  gender  and  sexual  identity  were 
developed  in  consultation  with  #BeeWell  Young  Peer 
Reviewers  and  national  LGBTQ + organisations.  In  rela-
tion  to  gender  identity,  participants  were  asked  if  they 
were  a  girl  (including  trans  girl);  boy  (including  trans 
boy); non-binary; describe themselves in another way; or, 
prefer  not  to  say.  A  gender  modality  variable  (transgen-
der/cisgender) was created by examining the correspon-
dence  between  self-reported  gender  identity  and  linked 
administrative data on sex (see Covariates section below). 
Sexual  identity  was  probed  by  asking  participants  what 
best described them, from the following options: Bi/pan-
sexual; gay/lesbian; heterosexual/straight; describe them-
selves in another way; or, prefer not to say.

Wellbeing

A range of wellbeing indicators and measures were avail-
able,  spanning  the  aforementioned  major  theoretical 
frameworks.  These  are  summarised  in  Table  2,  which 
also presents information about the internal consistency 
values  of  the  different  scales,  all  of  which  were  accept-
able  (≥ 0.7).  The  correlation  between  these  measures,  in 
addition to mean values and SD for subgroups of interest, 
are presented in Table 3. Measure selection in the #Bee-
Well study was driven by an extensive consultation pro-
cess  in  which  more  than  150  adolescents  were  engaged 
in  a  series  of  workshops  designed  to  elicit  their  under-
standing  of  wellbeing.  These  workshops  were  combined 
with  inputs  from  a  Questionnaire  Advisory  Group  of 
academics,  mental  health  professionals,  healthcare  rep-
resentatives,  education  experts,  parents,  teachers,  and 
adolescents, to inform survey content and measure selec-
tion [49].

When  considering  negative  affect  (hedonic  wellbeing 
framework),  we  used  a  subset  of  ‘pure’  negative  affect 
items (e.g., those pertaining specifically to the frequency 
with  which  negative  emotions,  such  as  feeling  worried, 
are experienced) from the Me and My Feelings scale [52],

whereas  when  considering  symptoms  of  distress  (com-

of  items  (including  those  that  pertain  to  the  frequency 
with which somatic symptoms, such as having problems 
sleeping,  are  experienced).  With  the  exception  of  this 
particular measure, we sought to avoid measure overlap 
across theoretical frameworks in order to avoid uninter-
pretable findings regarding the scope and scale of wellbe-
ing inequalities.

the influence of other characteristics for which there are 
established wellbeing inequalities [58].

Procedure
Ethical  approval  from  the  authors’  host  institution’s 
University  Research  Ethics  Committee  was  sought  and 
granted  prior  to  the  commencement  of  data  collection 
(Ref: 2021-11133-18179). Consistent with the conditions 
of this approval, opt-out parent/carer consent and young 
people’s  assent  to  participate  was  used  in  combination 
for  informed  consent,  leading  to  n = 363  not  completing 
surveys  (0.95%  of  a  total  of  363 + 37,978 = 38,341).  Sur-
veys were administered en masse to adolescents in school 
settings,  supported  by  school  staff  (who  provided  stan-
dardised instructions), via a secure online survey platform 
(Qualtrics). Measures were presented in a random order 
to spread missing data due to item fatigue evenly across 
the survey.

Analytic strategy

Before  estimating  structural  models,  as  a  preliminary 
analysis,  we  first  compared  three  possible  measurement 
structures  (unidimensional,  bifactor,  correlated  factors) 
for  each  wellbeing  framework.  This  preliminary  analy-
sis is explained in detail in Appendix 1 (Part 1). In brief, 
models were compared on a balance of fit, interpretabil-
ity  and  dimensionality  indices  [59,  60].  Based  on  this, 
we  determined  that  the  most  appropriate  measurement 
structure for each model was correlated factors (in which 
theorised wellbeing domains are modelled as distinct but 
correlated  factors).  We  subsequently  adopted  the  fol-
lowing  strategy  to  estimate  structural  correlated  factors 
models  to  assess  gender  and  sexual  identity  wellbeing 
inequalities.  For  each  framework  (hedonic,  eudaimonic, 
and  complete  state),  we  estimated  two  models.  Model 
A  included  all  covariates  (year  group,  FSM,  SEN,  eth-
nicity),  gender  identity,  and  sexual  identity.  Multi-cate-
gorical  variables  (ethnicity,  gender  identity,  and  sexual 
identity)  were  dummy  coded  (e.g.,  white:  no = 0,  yes = 1; 
black: no = 0, yes = 1; et cetera) with the reference category 
(white for ethnicity; boy for gender identity; heterosexual 
for sexual identity) omitted. Comparisons were therefore 
made between each dummy minority group (e.g., gay/les-
bian)  and  the  reference  category  (e.g.,  heterosexual).  In 
Model B we estimated the same model, replacing all the 
gender identity variables with the gender modality (trans-
gender/cisgender)  variable.  The  motivation  for  fitting 
gender  identity  and  gender  modality  in  separate  mod-
els  (and,  indeed,  for  not  including  sex  as  a  covariate  in 
Model A) was to avoid multicollinearity effects because, 
in  our  sample,  the  majority  (nearly  80%)  of  adolescents’ 
self-reported  gender  identity  was  the  same  as  their  sex. 
Figure 1 A and 1B illustrate this for the hedonic Models 
A and B, respectively.

Analyses  were  conducted  in  MPlus  8.7.  The  clus-
tered/hierarchical  nature  of  the  dataset  (adolescents 
nested within schools) was taken into account using the 
‘Type = complex’  function  which  adjusts  standard  errors 
to  account  for  dependence  in  the  data.  It  was  consid-
ered  appropriate  to  treat  measures  as  continuous  given 
that  all  except  Me  and  My  Feelings  (negative  affect  and 
symptoms  of  distress)  had  five  response  categories  or 
more and did not exhibit substantial asymmetry [61]. We 
therefore used the maximum likelihood with robust stan-
dard  errors  (MLR)  estimator.  Where  appropriate,  items 
from different scales were reversed to ensure all of them 
had  the  same  orientation.  Missing  data  were  accounted 
for  using  full  information  maximum  likelihood  (FIML). 
Given  the  response  format  of  the  Me  and  My  Feel-
ings  measure,  we  conducted  sensitivity  analyses  of  the 
hedonic  and  complete  state  models  using  the  weighted 
least square mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) esti-
mator,  with  multiple  imputation  (20  imputed  datasets) 
to  account  for  missing  data  (as  FIML  is  not  available  in 
WLSMV).  These  analyses  (see  Tables  A1.2  and  A1.3  in 
Appendix  1,  Part  2)  produced  very  similar  estimates  to 
those produced using the MLR estimator, with negligible 
differences  in  path  coefficients.  Model  fit  was  judged  in 
line with established cut-offs, with values > = 0.95 for the 
Comparative  Fit  Index  (CFI),  <=  0.06  for  the  root  mean 
square error of approximation (RMSEA), and < = 0.08 for 
the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) con-
sidered indicative of good fit [59].

Finally,  given  the  very  large  sample  size,  most  or  all 
structural  paths  were  expected  to  be  statistically  sig-
nificant  [60].  We  therefore  opted  to  focus  on  the  rela-
tive magnitude of the path coefficients within and across 
models.  Our  interpretation  was  guided  by  overlap/non-
overlap  in  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  between  the  differ-
ent structural path coefficients (see Fig. 2). More broadly, 
in the absence of any agreed thresholds for what size of 
inequality  might  be  considered  to  be  practically  signifi-
cant  or  substantively  important,  we  drew  on  two  very 
large, wide-ranging analyses of predictors of self-reported 
adolescent  wellbeing  [12,  62],  using  these  to  contextual-
ize our findings (see Discussion).

Results
Descriptive information of the study sample and variables 
of interest

The  demographic  characteristics  of  the  study  sample 
are  summarised  in  Table  1,  alongside  national  averages, 
where  available.  From  this,  one  can  surmise  that  the 
study  sample  mirrors  the  national  picture  for  second-
ary-aged  students  with  respect  to  sex,  year  group/age, 
and special educational needs. Ethnicity profiles are also 
similar, with the exceptions of the study sample contain-
ing  a  relatively  larger  proportion  of  Asian  adolescents

and  relatively  smaller  proportion  of  White  adolescents 
than the national average (mirroring the school-level pat-
tern  noted  in  the  preceding  subsection).  However,  the 
study sample mirrors the population of adolescents aged 
11–16  in  Greater  Manchester  very  closely,  with  far  less 
deviation in terms of ethnic composition than that noted 
above [58].

Table  2  shows  information  about  the  internal  consis-
tency  of  the  wellbeing  scales  used  in  this  study.  Inspec-
tion  of  Table  3  (descriptive  statistics)  reveals  that 
expected  correlations  between  wellbeing  domains  were 
borne out in the data, both in terms of direction (all posi-
tively  associated,  with  the  exception  of  negative  affect 
and symptoms of distress) and magnitude (mostly mod-
erate,  or  moderate-to-strong,  indicating  related  but  dis-
tinct constructs). Mean values and SDs for the subgroups 
of  interest  are  indicative  of  a  pattern  in  which  gender 
and sexual identity categories produce the most substan-
tial  disparities,  relative  to  other  characteristics  such  as 
ethnicity.

Key findings

Table  4  provides  fit  indices  for  the  structural  correlated 
factors  models,  which  indicate  good  model  fit.  Tables  5 
and  6,  and  7  present  the  results  of  models  correspond-
ing  to  the  hedonic,  eudaimonic,  and  complete  state 
frameworks,  respectively.  Figure  2  provides  a  visualisa-
tion  of  path  coefficients  and  their  CIs,  with  an  accom-
panying  online  version  available  that  enables  readers  to 
filter  by  outcome  and  group  for  easier  comparison  (see 

Supplementary  Materials).  In  both  the  tables  and  fig-
ure,  the  size  of  structural  paths,  representing  wellbeing 
inequalities,  are  reported  in  standard  deviations  (SD; 
e.g.,  bisexual/pansexual  adolescents  had  estimated  life 
satisfaction scores 0.65 SD lower than their heterosexual 
peers).  In  Fig.  2,  the  size  of  these  structural  paths  are 
also reported in absolute terms to facilitate comparisons 
between measures where paths have opposite signs (e.g., 
negative affect and optimism). Below we note substantive 
patterns derived from the above, presented as a series of 
Key  Findings  that  match  our  research  questions  in  the 
interest of clarity.

Key finding 1: adolescent gender and sexual identity 
wellbeing inequalities are routinely more substantial than 
those pertaining to other characteristics (RQ1)

Across  all  frameworks  and  domains  within  them,  the 
magnitude  of  wellbeing  inequalities  pertaining  to  gen-
der  and  sexual  identity  are  routinely  greater  than  those 
pertaining  to  covariates  (age,  FSM,  SEN,  and  ethnicity). 
Thus, in all but a few cases, the smallest gender identity 
or  sexual  identity  inequality  is  greater  than  the  largest 
covariate inequality. Furthermore, almost all cases where 
a covariate inequality was equivalent to or exceeded the 
magnitude  of  a  gender  identity/sexual  identity  inequal-
ity involved the ‘prefer not to say’ categories in the latter 
(e.g., in hedonic Model A, adolescents who prefer not to 
report their sexual identity had estimated positive affect 
scores of 0.12 SD lower than heterosexual adolescents; in

the same analysis, those in Year 10 had estimated positive 
affect scores 0.22 SD lower than those in Year 8).

Key finding 2: gender identity wellbeing inequalities follow 
a consistent pattern, with the largest disparities evident 
between gender diverse adolescents and boys (RQ2)

Model A in each wellbeing framework reveals that point 
estimates  are  consistent  in  the  order  of  magnitude  for 
gender (though there is some overlap of CIs across pre-
dictors), as follows (with the illustrative example of men-
tal  wellbeing  in  the  complete  state  model):  non-binary 
(largest,  β=  − 0.57);  describe  themselves  in  another  way 
(β=− 0.47); girls (β=− 0.40); and, prefer not to say (small-
est,  β=  − 0.31).  Model  B  in  each  wellbeing  framework 
consistently  reveals  inequalities  for  transgender  adoles-
cents  when  compared  to  their  cisgender  counterparts 
(β=− 0.31 in the case of mental wellbeing). Reading back 
across  to  Model  A,  the  observed  wellbeing  inequalities 
for  transgender  adolescents  consistently  places  them  at 
or around the smallest order of magnitude (e.g., ≈ β= 0.3), 
though of course the difference in reference group should 
be noted (e.g., boys in Model A, cisgender in Model B).

Key finding 3: sexual identity wellbeing inequalities follow 
a consistent pattern, with the largest disparities evident 
between sexual minority adolescents and their heterosexual 
peers (RQ3)

Model A in each wellbeing framework reveals that point 
estimates  are  consistent  in  the  order  of  magnitude  for 
gender (though there is some overlap of CIs), as follows 
(with the illustrative example of self-esteem in the eudai-
monic  model):  gay/lesbian  (largest,  β=  − 0.76);  bi/pan-
sexual (β=− 0.74); describe in another way (β=− 0.27); and, 
prefer not to say (smallest, β= − 0.17). Of note is the fact 
that  the  magnitude  of  wellbeing  inequalities  for  bi/pan-
sexual  and  gay/lesbian  adolescents  are  remarkably  simi-
lar, with overlap between CIs across all domains.

Key finding 4: adolescent sexual identity wellbeing 
inequalities across subgroups of interest are consistent, 
irrespective of how gender identity is categorised (RQ4)

Contrasting  Model  A  and  B  in  each  wellbeing  domain, 
we can see that substituting our gender identity variable 
(A) with our gender modality variable (B) does not sub-
stantively  impact  the  magnitude  of  the  structural  paths 
for  sexual  identity,  with  trivial  coefficient  changes  in  all 
cases except for those who prefer not to report their sex-
ual identity. Using symptoms of distress in the complete 
state models as an example, being gay/lesbian (compared 
to heterosexual) is associated with an estimated 0.91 SD 
increase  in  scores  in  Model  A,  and  estimated  0.94  SD 
increase in scores in Model B.

Key finding 5: adolescent gender and sexual identity 
wellbeing inequalities vary across frameworks and domains 
(RQ5)

Reading across and within our three substantive wellbe-
ing  frameworks  (hedonic,  eudaimonic,  complete  state), 
there are three related patterns. First, the most substan-
tial  inequalities  pertain  to  negative  affect  (hedonic)  and 
symptoms of distress (complete state), both of which are 
derived from the Me and My Feelings emotional difficul-
ties subscale [52], with some shared items (see Measures 
section). For girls, bi/pansexual, and gay/lesbian respon-
dents, there are no CI overlaps between path coefficients 
for  these  versus  other  wellbeing  domains,  with  a  single 
exception (self-esteem for gay/lesbian respondents). Sec-
ond, the eudaimonic framework hosts the smallest well-
being  inequality:  positive  relationships  with  others.  For 
girls,  bi/pansexual,  gay/lesbian,  and  non-binary  respon-
dents,  there  are  only  two  CI  overlaps  between  path 
coefficients for this versus other wellbeing domains (pos-
itive affect for bi/pansexual and gay/lesbian respondents; 
autonomy for gay/lesbian respondents). Third, variability 
is  evident  within  the  three  wellbeing  frameworks,  with 
(for  example)  substantially  greater  disparities  in  symp-
toms of distress than mental wellbeing for girls, bisexual, 
and gay/lesbian adolescents in the complete state models.

Discussion
In  the  current  study  we  sought  to  examine  wellbeing 
inequalities relating to gender and sexual identity among 
adolescents  via  analysis  of  the  #BeeWell  dataset.  Doing 
so enabled a novel contribution to knowledge through a 
wide-ranging  investigation  of  multiple  wellbeing  frame-
works  and  domains  that  went  beyond  the  traditional 
focus  on  symptoms  of  distress;  included  segmented 
analyses  by  sexual  and  gender  identity;  controlled  for  a 
range  of  socio-demographic  covariates  for  which  there 
are  established  wellbeing  inequalities  (something  fre-
quently  not  attended  to  in  comparable  studies  [63,  64]); 
and, updated and extended the evidence base to England, 
in relation to one of the most neglected stages of devel-
opment: early adolescence.

After  determing  the  most  appropriate  measurement 
structure  for  each  wellbeing  framework  (correlated  fac-
tors), our structural models revealed that the magnitude 
of wellbeing inequalities pertaining to gender and sexual 
identity  were  routinely  greater  than  those  concerning 
ethnicity,  socio-economic  disadvantage,  age,  and  special 
educational  needs.  For  gender  identity,  the  largest  well-
being inequalities were evident for those adolescents who 
identified as non-binary, followed by those who described 
themselves  in  another  way,  girls,  and  finally,  those  who 
preferred  not  to  say  (all  compared  to  boys).  In  a  paral-
lel  analysis,  wellbeing  inequalities  were  also  found  for 
transgender  youth  (compared  to  their  cisgender  peers).

Regarding sexual identity, the greatest wellbeing inequali-
ties were apparent for those who identified as gay/lesbian 
or bi/pansexual, followed by those who described them-
selves in another way, and finally, those who preferred not 
to say (all compared to those identifying as heterosexual).
Reading  across  and  within  our  three  wellbeing  frame-
works (hedonic, eudaimonic, complete state), there were 
three related patterns. First, the most substantial inequal-
ities pertained to negative affect (hedonic) and symptoms 
of  distress  (complete  state),  both  of  which  were  opera-
tionalized  using  items  from  the  same  measure  (Me  and 
My  Feelings).  Second,  the  smallest  wellbeing  inequality 
was  for  positive  relationships  with  others.  Finally,  vari-
ability  was  evident  within  the  three  wellbeing  frame-
works, with, for example, substantially greater disparities 
in  symptoms  of  distress  than  mental  wellbeing  in  the 
complete state models.

Adolescents  whose  identities  transcend  traditional 
boundaries  (i.e.,  those  who  are  non-binary  or  describe 
themselves in another way) were subject to the most sub-
stantial  inequalities  when  considering  gender  identity. 
Given that so little is known about the wellbeing of gen-
der  diverse  early  adolescents,  this  is  an  important  find-
ing.  Identity  formation  is  a  crucial  developmental  task 
of  adolescence,  with  identity  expected  to  consolidate 
over  time  [65].  Early  adolescence  is  therefore  a  period 
in  which  we  would  expect  to  see  greater  exploration  of 
identity options. However, this appears to come at a cost 
to wellbeing among those whose emergent identity does 
not conform to social expectations and the conventional 
boy/girl binary [66].

The same can also be said for the inequalities that were 
identified  in  relation  to  gender  modality  (i.e.  among 
transgender  youth).  Here,  our  findings  align  with  what 
earlier research has found regarding mental health diffi-
culties [39], and provide new evidence in relation to other 
facets of wellbeing. We note disparities between cisgen-
der  and  transgender  youth  pertaining  to  all  wellbeing 
domains, which were equivalent in size to that observed 
for symptoms of distress. Thus, attempts to address this 
issue  should  factor  in  the  need  to  increase  feelings  of 
agency,  psychological  functioning  and  other  aspects  of 
wellbeing (e.g., both feeling good and thriving) alongside 
the traditional focus on alleviating distress.

While  the  current  study  focuses  on  outcomes  rather 
than mechanisms, our findings are consistent with what 
would  be  predicted  by  minority  stress  theory  [33],  and 
indeed  early  adolescence  may  be  a  particularly  sensitive 
period  for  exposure  to  such  stressors,  given  the  height-
ened  social  comparison  and  affectivity  that  characterise 
this  period  [67].  Further  research  is  needed  to  examine 
the  extent  to  which  experiences  of  prejudice,  discrimi-
nation,  sexual  identity  concealment,  expectations  of 
rejection,  and  internalised  stigma  [34–36],  and  punitive 

and  traumatic  reactions  from  parents  and  caregivers  in 
response  to  their  children’s  identity  and/or  orientation 
[37], might explain the magnitude of wellbeing inequali-
ties  observed  here  for  gender  diverse  and  sexual  minor-
ity  youth.  The  existing  evidence  base  is  unfortunately 
rather  limited,  being  focused  almost  exclusively  on  dis-
tress  (neglecting  broader  aspects  of  wellbeing),  primar-
ily  cross-sectional  in  nature  (limiting  causal  inference), 
rather  narrowly  focused  on  victimisation  pertaining  to 
sexual identity (neglecting other minority stressors), and 
failing  to  pay  attention  to  how  gender  and  sexual  iden-
tity intersect in relation to minority stress and wellbeing 
outcomes  (limiting  the  precision  of  conclusions  drawn) 
(Authors, under review).

Consistent  with  prior  research  [4],  we  also  found  evi-
dence  of  inequalities  across  the  full  range  of  wellbeing 
outcomes  for  girls  when  compared  to  boys.  However, 
the  magnitude  of  these  disparities  varied  considerably 
across different wellbeing outcomes. Thus, while the gap 
between boys and girls was highly pronounced for nega-
tive  affect  and  symptoms  of  distress  (and,  indeed,  was 
comparable  to  inequalities  for  gender  diverse  youth),  it 
was  considerably  smaller  for  autonomy,  and  negligible 
for positive relationships. Relatedly, it is noteworthy that, 
in  comparison  to  outcomes  in  the  hedonic  and  com-
plete  state  frameworks,  eudaimonic  outcomes  gener-
ally  produced  the  least  prominent  boy-girl  inequalities. 
This finding is consistent with recent research on eudai-
monia  in  emerging  adulthood  [68],  and  underscores  the 
idea that the scale of inequalities can depend very much 
on how one defines and measures wellbeing [69]. Hence, 
while  we  found  that  girls  are  disadvantaged  compared 
to boys in terms of eudaimonic wellbeing, they are more 
disadvantaged  when  their  wellbeing  is  viewed  through 
the lens of complete state or hedonic wellbeing.

In comparing our findings with those of two very large, 
wide-ranging  analyses  of  predictors  of  self-reported 
adolescent  wellbeing  that  span  three  very  large  datasets 
(Monitoring  the  Future,  Youth  Risk  and  Behaviour  Sur-
vey,  and  the  Millennium  Cohort  Study)  [12,  62],  there 
are several points of note that speak to the practical sig-
nificance  and  substantive  importance  of  the  inequali-
ties  noted  above.  First,  the  magnitude  of  inequalities 
observed  for  our  co-variates  is  consistent  with  previous 
work  (e.g.,  small  and  inconsistent  ethnicity  disparities; 
small  but  consistently  negative  gaps  in  relation  to  SEN 
and  socio-economic  deprivation  [62]).  Second,  there  is 
also  consistency  with  other  work  for  the  magnitude  of 
the boy-girl gap for comparable wellbeing domains (e.g., 
symptoms of distress [62]). Third, and most importantly, 
the marked inequalities observed for gender diverse (e.g., 
non-binary, describe in another way) and sexual minority 
(e.g., gay/lesbian, bi/pansexual) adolescents in the current 
study overshadow most of the wide range of factors and

characteristics  previously  shown  to  be  associated  with 
wellbeing  by  a  considerable  margin.  For  example,  con-
sider that being bullied (compared to not being bullied) is 
consistently associated with a ≈ 0.2 SD increase in symp-
toms  of  distress  in  adolescence  [12,  62];  the  association 
between being gay/lesbian or bi/pansexual (compared to 
heterosexual)  and  symptoms of distress  is  more than 4x 
larger (> 0.9 SD, with even the lower CI being > 0.8 SD).

Few would argue that the effects of bullying on wellbe-
ing do not warrant intervention, and indeed its’ preven-
tion and remediation has been rightly flagged as a policy 
and practice priority [68]. Accordingly, we argue strongly 
that the scale of the wellbeing disparities is of such sub-
stantive  importance  to  justify  a  comprehensive  preven-
tion  and  intervention  response,  especially  given  that 
said  disparities  appear  to  have  been  amplified  over  the 
course of the Covid-19 pandemic (e.g., average of 0.39 SD 
increase in symptoms of distress among sexual minority 
youth  in  pre-pandemic  research  [63]).  It  is  this  issue  to 
which we now turn.

Implications

Given  the  findings  of  the  current  study,  a  fundamental 
shift in measurement approaches is warranted. First, our 
analyses  highlight  the  need  to  move  beyond  a  predomi-
nant focus on symptoms of distress, to include a range of 
broader wellbeing indicators. Our analysis show moder-
ate  correlations  between  wellbeing  indicators  -suggest-
ing  that  they  are  not  measuring  the  same  thing-  and  all 
of  them  reveal  highly  important  to  understand  wellbe-
ing  vulnerability  affecting  gender  and  sexual  identity 
minorities. Second, gender and sexual identity should be 
measured in ways that enable adolescents to report iden-
tities  that  differ  from  social  and  cultural  norms  relating 
to  rigid,  binary  constructs  (e.g.,  boy  vs.  girl).  This  point 
is underscored by the fact that in the current study, those 
who  reported  being  gender  diverse  (e.g.,  non-binary, 
describe in another way) were subject to the most marked 
wellbeing inequalities. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that 
although there are now national statistics on adult gender 
diversity and sexual orientation/identity in England [70], 
there are no equivalent figures for young people (hence, 
the absence of these figures in Table 1). Within the NHS, 
guidance exists to improve data collection about gender 
identity  [71],  but  is  often  poor  quality,  leading  to  expe-
riences  of  discrimination  and  unequal  treatment  [72]. 
Finally,  overall,  our  findings  show  the  need  for  effective 
interventions  to  support  the  wellbeing  of  LGBTQ + ado-
lescents,  which  has  also  been  highlighted  in  research 
investigating interventions for gender and sexual minor-
ity groups [73, 74].

Strengths and limitations

Together  with  the  study  strengths  highlighted  above, 
there are numerous limitations that need to be borne in 
mind.  First,  though  self-report  is  arguably  the  optimal 
method  for  assessing  the  wellbeing  domains  that  were 
the focus of our inquiry [75], its exclusive use raises the 
question as to whether common method variance under-
pins  some  of  our  findings  (i.e.,  that  patterns  observed 
across  wellbeing  domains  were  partly  attributable  to 
the  fact  that  all  surveys  were  self-report  and  had  simi-
lar  response  formats).  Second,  despite  the  fact  that  we 
were able to comprehensively model the domains of the 
hedonic  and  complete  state  wellbeing  frameworks,  our 
reliance on an existing dataset meant that some domains 
of the eudaimonic framework could not be included (e.g., 
environmental  mastery,  personal  growth).  Third,  as  the 
#BeeWell dataset only contained a single wave of data at 
the point at which the current study was written, analy-
ses focusing on the development of wellbeing inequalities, 
and indeed the factors theorised to underpin them, were 
not possible. Fourth, the dataset was unbalanced. While 
this  was  to  be  expected,  it  reduced  the  precision  of  our 
estimates for minority gender and sexual identity groups, 
as  evidenced  in  wider  CIs.  Fifth,  caution  is  needed  with 
regards  to  the  generalizability  of  these  results  to  other 
populations,  as  there  is  considerable  variation  across 
societies  in  institutional  (e.g.,  rules  and  laws  affecting 
LGBTQ + young  people,  the  type  of  health  care  services 
available)  and  societal  factors  (e.g.  levels  of  discrimina-
tion,  denial  of  discrimination  among  gender  and  sexual 
orientation/identity  minorities)  that  are  relevant  to 
LGBTQ + young people [76, 77].

Relatedly, we also note the aforementioned discrepan-
cies  between  the  compositional  features  of  participating 
schools  and  those  of  secondary  schools  across  England 
(see Results). However, at least some of these differences 
are attributable to the fact that the study sample included 
31  schools  for  whose  categorisation  (e.g.,  independent, 
pupil  referral  unit,  special  school)  national  data  are  not 
available by phase of education (e.g., primary versus sec-
ondary); hence, national averages reported in the current 
study  are  for  mainstream,  non-independent  secondary 
schools.  Non-mainstream  and  independent  schools  are 
typically  smaller,  and  non-mainstream  schools  contain 
a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  pupils  with  SEN. 
Hence, when focusing on the 134 mainstream, non-inde-
pendent schools in the study sample, size (study average: 
1031 pupils per school; national average 1027.2) and SEN 
(study average: 16.1%; national average 14.1%) are much 
more comparable to the national picture.

Sixth, despite enabling more granular analyses of iden-
tities  than  has  previously  been  possible,  the  underpin-
ning  dataset  used  in  the  current  study  did  not  contain 
information  on  gender  and  sexuality  expression.  The 

Marquez et al. BMC Public Health         (2023) 23:2211 Page 17 of 19

latter  could  feasibly  mediate  the  relationship  between 
gender and sexuality identities and wellbeing (e.g., ‘mas-
culine  girls’  and  ‘feminine  boys’  are  likely  targets  for 
marginalization  and  discrimination,  irrespective  of  their 
gender identity; conversely, an adolescent may identify as 
(for  example)  gay,  but  not  disclose  or  express  their  sex-
ual  identity  publicly).  Future  research  focusing  on  both 
identities  and  expression  could  therefore  significantly 
enhance our understanding of this important issue.

Finally, it should be acknowledged that there are other 
valid ways of conceptualising and coding data relating to 
transgender  participants  that  differ  from  our  approach 
(gender  modality)  [33,  34].  One  option  –  as  opposed  to 
contrasting  gender  identity  to  administrative  data  on 
male/female  assignment  –  is  to  ask  participants  to  self-
report if they consider themselves to be transgender (and 
indeed, such an item is being included in future iterations 
of the #BeeWell survey). A further issue regards the gran-
ularity  of  our  groups  and  the  fact  that  our  approach  to 
coding the data to create these groups may hide further 
wellbeing  inequalities  within  these  aggregated  groups 
–an  issue  that  should  be  examined  in  future  research 
using these data. In this study, it would have been techni-
cally possible to disaggregate our data further (i.e., trans 
boys,  trans  girls,  cis  boys,  cis  girls,  as  opposed  to  sim-
ply transgender, cisgender) in order to identify potential 
further  wellbeing  inequalities  hidden  within  our  aggre-
gated groups. For example, compared to cisgender boys, 
transgender boys likely experience a number of stressors 
and  unique  experiences  related  to  their  gender  experi-
ence in a world that privileges and champions cisgender 
and heterosexual norms [78]; hence, conflating them (as 
in  Model  A)  may  mask  important  differences  between 
these  groups.  Relatedly,  we  acknowledge  the  oppression 
towards cisgender (and transgender) girls in a patriarchal 
society,  which  means  that  aggregating  cis  girls  and  cis 
boys (as in Model B) may be similarly problematic. How-
ever, we opted not to undertake further disaggregation in 
view of both the statistical power implications (i.e., con-
siderably  reduced  power,  potentially  leading  to  spurious 
results) and the fact that to do so would be ‘othering’ (i.e. 
it could be taken to imply that a trans boy’s identification 
as a boy is not the same as a cis boy’s identification as a 
boy).

Conclusion
The  analyses  outlined  in  the  current  paper  demonstrate 
substantial  inequalities  pertaining  to  gender  and  sexual 
identity  across  a  range  of  wellbeing  frameworks  and 
domains in early adolescence, particularly for those ado-
lescents  whose  identities  transcend  traditional  gender 
identity binaries or who identify as gay/lesbian or bi/pan-
sexual. To build on these findings, future research should 
routinely assess both gender and sexual identity in ways 

that  enable  adolescents  to  report  diverse  identities.  An 
intersectional approach to examine how such inequalities 
vary  across  different  socio-demographic  characteristics 
(e.g.,  ethnicity)  would  also  be  welcome.  There  is  a  need 
for longitudinal research that can enable analyses focus-
ing on the development of wellbeing inequalities, and the 
factors  theorised  to  underpin  them  (e.g.,  experiences  of 
discrimination  and  other  mechanisms  espoused  in  the 
minority stress model). In the interim, the evidence pre-
sented here is sufficient to warrant an urgent call for the 
prioritisation  of  improved  prevention  and  intervention 
efforts  that  can  better  meet  the  needs  of  gender  diverse 
and sexual minority youth.
