Ketamine is an open channel blocker of ionotropic glutamatergic N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The discovery of its
rapid antidepressant effects in patients with depression and treatment-resistant depression fostered novel effective treatments for
mood disorders. This discovery not only provided new insight into the neurobiology of mood disorders but also uncovered
fundamental synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie its treatment. In this review, we discuss key clinical aspects of ketamine’s
effect as a rapidly acting antidepressant, synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying its action, as well as how these novel
perspectives in clinical practice and synapse biology form a road map for future studies aimed at more effective treatments for
neuropsychiatric disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Psychiatric disorders and neurotherapeutics are exhibiting a
renaissance of new treatments for mood disorders that engage
novel synaptic signaling mechanisms. The fertility of this moment
is illustrated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approvals of Esketamine (Spravato) and Brexanolone (Zulresso) in
2019. Further, the FDA approval of Esketamine has seemed to

consciousness-altering medications

centration of emerging novel treatments has been unmatched

since 1957,
antidepressants were discovered,
the monoamine transporter
antagonists and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors [1–4]. The
need for these new antidepressants is unquestionable. Despite
over 60 years of antidepressant development, mood disorders
remain among the most disabling medical conditions in the world
and they are associated with shortening of life expectancy by up
to 10 years [5, 6]. Inadequate antidepressant efﬁcacy is clearly a
contributor to the burden posed by mood disorders as the NIMH
STAR*D study indicated that only approximately one-third of
depressed patients

modest incremental beneﬁts were seen with subsequent treat-
ments, approximately one-third of patients remained unremitted
after four
treatments, and the one-year relapse rate among
patients with treatment-resistant symptoms (Steps 3 and 4) was
approximately 75% [7, 8]. While opportunistic observations
contributed to the discoveries of the antidepressants in both the
late 1950’s and the modern era, the scientiﬁc context of the
the antidepressant efﬁcacy of ketamine was
discovery of
fundamentally different
from the earlier discoveries [9]. The
following review will consider the neuroscience framework that
led to the discovery of the antidepressant effects of ketamine and

the resulting explosion in translational neuroscience devoted to
understanding the growing array of synaptic signaling mechan-
isms through which its antidepressant effects are expressed. We
will also synthesize several of the seemingly disparate ﬁndings
regarding ketamine’s mechanism of action including the NMDA
receptor dependence on excitatory neurons compared to
inhibitory neurons, the glutamate surge that has been reported
following NMDAR block, the intracellular signaling pathway, the
requirement for BDNF-TrkB activity, and the role for postsynaptic
AMPA receptors. Other proposed mechanisms for ketamine’s
antidepressant action include ketamine enantiomers [10] and
metabolites [11], the potential role of inﬂammatory processes [12],
and non-neuronal contributions including those from micro-
glia [13], among others.

FROM THE MONOAMINE HYPOTHESIS OF DEPRESSION TO
NMDAR ANTAGONIST TREATMENTS
In the 1970s through the 1990s, Yale University was a hotbed of
preclinical and translational research attempting to characterize
disturbances
in monoamine signaling contributing to the
neurobiology of depression and the mechanisms through which
monoamine signaling-targeting antidepressants produced their
therapeutic effects. Studies led by Dennis Charney, Pedro Delgado,
George Heninger, and others clearly implicated ongoing mono-
aminergic availability in monoaminergic antidepressant efﬁcacy. In
depressed patients who had responded to antidepressant
treatment, depletion of either
serotonin or norepinephrine
prevented or transiently reversed the antidepressant effects of
serotonin transporter antagonists or norepinephrine transporter
antagonists, respectively [14–16]. However, subsequent Yale and
NIMH studies attempting to produce depression in healthy people
by depleting serotonin, norepinephrine, or both were not

successful [17–21]. While other ﬁndings in the ﬁeld suggested that
monoamine signaling was relevant to the biology of depression,
the mixed ﬁndings from the depletion studies suggested that the
framework for the biology of depression needed to be broadened
to encompass other signaling mechanisms [22].

In parallel, one of us (J.K.) developed R,S-ketamine infusion as a
psychopharmacology research platform to probe NMDAR function
relevant to cognitive function, psychosis, and dissociation in
healthy humans [23]. This work was motivated by parallel
broadening of perspective from the “dopamine model” of
schizophrenia to one involving the intrinsic signaling mechanisms

producing delirium or anesthesia,
i.e. a 40-minute intravenous
targeting plasma ketamine levels of
infusion of 0.5 mg/kg,
130–200 ng/ml. At comparable doses of S-ketamine,
its effects
on negative symptoms correlate with in vivo occupancy of
NMDARs [25].

The convergence of the broadening perspective of the biology of
depression with the development of an approach to probe
glutamate synaptic function resulted in the discovery of the rapid
antidepressant effects of ketamine. The initial pilot study used the
previously ketamine infusion strategy to conduct the ﬁrst rando-
mized, placebo-controlled test of ketamine response in depression
[26]. This study built on inconclusive ﬁndings with lower potency
NMDAR antagonists including amantadine and memantine [27].
The investigative team also was aware of earlier studies in animals
that described antidepressant effects of NMDAR partial agonists and
antagonists [28, 29]. However, none of these studies predicted the
distinctively rapid and robust antidepressant effects of a single
ketamine dose in depressed patients observed in the initial pilot
study, nor

depression, bipolar disorder [30] or suicide ideation [31].

the efﬁcacy in treatment-resistant

Subsequent research validated the safety and efﬁcacy of R,S-
ketamine and Esketamine for the treatment of a growing array of
psychiatric disorders. When used to treat depression, ketamine is
dosed with the minimal
frequency possible. Although clinical
practices may vary [32], it is generally started with twice weekly
dosing for the ﬁrst month, weekly for the following month, and then
with reduced frequency thereafter among patients engaged in
maintenance treatment. R,S-ketamine has shown efﬁcacy for
depression in the context of treatment-resistant depression [30],
bipolar disorder [33], OCD [34], and PTSD [35]. R,S-ketamine appears
to have long-term safety and efﬁcacy [36, 37]. Beyond depression,
R,S-ketamine produces clinical response in patients with anxiety
disorders [38] and improvement in social and vocational function in
patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorders [39].
Esketamine studies have documented the long-term safety and
efﬁcacy of Esketamine using randomized placebo-controlled
[40–42] and drug-discontinuation [43] designs.
Importantly, the
drug discontinuation study indicated that among responders to
the combination of a new antidepressant and Esketamine,
maintenance of Esketamine with the new antidepressant halved
the relapse rate relative to maintenance the new antidepressant by
itself. In other words, Esketamine appeared to produce a larger
protective effect against
relative to
antidepressant treatment than antidepressants typically show when
compared to placebo [44]. To date, there have not been well-
powered head-to-head comparisons of R,S-ketamine and Esketa-
mine. Meta-analysis appears to give a small edge to intravenous R,S-
ketamine [45], but cross-trial comparisons must be interpreted very
cautiously due to unaddressed confounds. An observational study
did not ﬁnd differences in efﬁcacy between intravenous R,S-
ketamine and intransal Esketamine, but did suggest that R,S-
ketamine acted more rapidly [46]. Thus, conclusions regarding the
relative efﬁcacy of these treatments are premature.

relapse over one year

NMDAR antagonists studied to date appear to have a narrow
dose window for optimized clinical response. Three randomized

placebo-controlled studies in treatment-resistant depression and
PTSD [35, 47–49] suggest that lowering the dose by approximately
half or more (≤0.2 mg/kg) is associated with loss of antidepressant
efﬁcacy, while doubling the ketamine dose (1.0 mg/kg) increases
the intensity of dissociative symptoms without augmenting
efﬁcacy. At anesthetic doses (doses ≥2.0 mg/kg), ketamine does
not appear to produce antidepressant effects [50]. The sensitivity
of response rates to small dose differences was also evident for
Esketamine, where a study in geriatric patients was ineffective
overall, an outcome that might have been related to starting older
patients on a low ineffective dose of 28 mg. instead of the usual
56 mg dose [51]. Because of the high degree of sensitivity to
ketamine dose, NMDAR antagonist treatment strategies that do
not appear to produce comparable leves of NMDAR antagonism
as the standard ketamine infusion paradigm [52] may not engage
the same forms of neuroplasticity as the antidepressant doses of
R,S-ketamine and Esketamine.

There may be speciﬁc roles for psychotherapies combined with
ketamine or Esketamine treatment. Ketamine, due to its primary
action as a NMDAR blocker, is known to interfere with NMDAR-
dependent forms of Hebbian neuroplasticity [53, 54]. This has led
to studies suggesting a capacity of ketamine to disrupt the
reconsolidation of maladaptive memories contributing to PTSD
[55] and addiction [56].
In other words, by interfering with
memory reconsolidation, ketamine may reduce the negative
impact of trauma memories in PTSD or drug-related cravings in
addiction. These studies build on preclinical research suggesting
that if ketamine is administered in association with the reexposure
to prior threat [57, 58] or rewarding drugs [59], the reconsolidation
of
fear or drug-related memories was attenuated. Rather
unexpectedly, ketamine has also been shown in rodent models
to elicit homeostatic neuroplasticity within an hour following
administration [60], which has been linked to its rapid anti-
depressant action. This raises an intriguing question of whether
ketamine is producing beneﬁcial effects by different neuroplasti-
city processes in patients with depression compared to PTSD or
substance use disorders. Pilot studies have described beneﬁcial
effects where ketamine has been combined with CBT [61] and a
digital
intervention. The combination of ketamine with psy-
chotherapies is an active area of investigation and may broaden
the population of patients who beneﬁt from ketamine treatment.

spectroscopy (1H-MRS) provided the ﬁrst non-invasive measure-
ments of brain glutamate and glutamine levels, generally
reporting reductions
[63],
although there are differing ﬁndings [64]. These measurements
are difﬁcult to interpret mechanistically as these metabolites are
present in all cell types within the virtual box of brain tissue (voxel)
in which measurements are made. Further, the pool of glutamate
available for neurotransmission is a small fraction, perhaps 10%, of
neuronal glutamate [65, 66]. These limitations are somewhat
addressed using 13C-MRS in combination with an isotopically
labeled metabolic substrates (13C-glucose, 13C-acetate), which
enable dynamic tracking of
isotopically-labeled
metabolites of these substrates and the characterization of the

metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, VTCA), and the rate of

related to the rate of glutamate release (VCycle) [67–69]. Using
these techniques, it was ﬁrst shown that frontal cortical VTCA but
not VCycle was reduced in medication-free depressed patients

Functional studies using event-related potentials assessed with

reduced (“energy per cycle”;

A second form of glutamate synaptic dysfunction in MDD and
PTSD is synaptic loss. In animals, chronic stress exposure produces
clear evidence of synaptic pruning [75–77]. Structural MRI studies
of MDD had long described volumetric loss from which many
inferred the existence of synaptic deﬁcits [78–80]. Post-mortem
studies of human post-mortem cortical and limbic tissue also
describe altered expression levels for genes coding for pre- and
postsynaptic proteins [81, 82]. The advent of a radioligand for the
synaptic vesicle protein-2A (SV2A) enabled the ﬁrst
in vivo
descriptions of reductions in synaptic density in MDD patients
with and without PTSD comorbidity who expressed moderate-to-
severe symptoms [83]. In contrast to the presynaptic protein SV2A,
imaging of postsynaptic glutamate synaptic proteins is less well
advanced. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is a post-
synaptic protein and there are variable ﬁndings across studies
[84, 85]. A recent study [86] reported no change overall in MDD,
but reductions in mGluR5 density associated with depression
severity, consistent with synaptic losses in patients with moderate-
to-severe depression. Based on the accumulating evidence for
deﬁcits in glutamatergic synaptic function as well as structural
it is plausible to expect that ketamine’s
plasticity of synapses,
rapid antidepressant action may either counter or mask these
pathological defects.

KETAMINE EFFECTS ON BRAIN CIRCUITS IN MDD PATIENTS
Since the landmark papers on the mechanisms of action of
ketamine [60, 87], there has been a concerted effort to assess the
implications of the preclinical ﬁndings for the antidepressant
effects of ketamine in patients. These two papers put forth
different hypothesis on the mechanism of the rapid antidepres-
sant action of ketamine, which we discuss as well as provide a
perspective on their commonalities.

Research in the Duman laboratory proposed that ketamine
action involves the blockade of NMDARs on inhibitory inter-
neurons [88, 89]. This transient reduction of excitatory drive to
these inhibitory interneuron resident NMDARs is postulated to
suppress tonic release of GABA and disinhibit activity of the
target excitatory neurons. The resulting increase in glutamater-
gic activity produces downstream activation of mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) function to increase dendritic spine
formation and produce the rapid and sustained antidepressant
effects [87, 90] (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). However, it is important to
note that disinhibitory effects similar to ketamine action can also
be elicited by the closely related NMDA receptor blocker
memantine [91], although clinically memantine administration
does not induce rapid antidepressant responses [92]. It should
be noted, however, that a 40 mg dose of memantine [93], twice
the dose of memantine used in the depression trial, still
produces subjective effects (euphoria, stimulation, sedation,
etc.) that are similar but quite less intense than a standard
is not clear
antidepressant dose of ketamine [94]. Thus,
whether sufﬁcient memantine doses have been administered to
depressed patients to enable an adequate evaluation of
its
antidepressant efﬁcacy. However,
increasing the dose of
memantine may result in off-target effects that make it difﬁcult
to discern whether it is NMDAR mediated.

The Monteggia and Kavalali

labs were also investigating the
mechanism of ketamine action and identiﬁed a key role for
synaptic plasticity, speciﬁcally a novel form of rapid homeostatic
plasticity,
in the behavioral effects. Ketamine produces rapid
antidepressant effects that in some patients persist for days to
more than a week in some patients. Following administration,
ketamine has a short half-life suggesting that its antidepressant
effects are due to a form of plasticity that outlast the systemic
presence of ketamine. Although ketamine is a well characterized
NMDA receptor antagonist, rather unexpectedly it was shown to
induce synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus. This potentia-
tion involves block of NMDA receptors and the engagement of
intracellular signaling to increase neurotransmission carried out by
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid (AMPA)
type glutamate receptors that persists for several hours [60, 95].
While NMDA receptor activation by activity dependent release
of glutamate has been traditionally associated with Hebbian forms
of plasticity such as Long-Term Potentiation and Long-Term
Depression, blockade of NMDA receptors has been shown to elicit
a form of homeostatic synaptic plasticity [96]. Unlike Hebbian
forms of plasticity, homeostatic plasticities act in a negative
feedback manner to counter substantive increases or decreases in
activity by re-balancing synaptic strengths. These plasticity forms
involve up- or down-regulation of synaptic weights on a given
neuron by a multiplicative factor in a process commonly referred
to as “synaptic scaling”. Synaptic re-balancing triggered by
homeostatic synaptic scaling maintains
relative weights of
synapses and does not alter the “information” content of synaptic
inputs. This feature of homeostatic synaptic scaling makes it an
ideal form of plasticity to drive ketamine action as the cognitive
functions — that are thought to rely on relative values of synaptic
weights to each other — are expected to be unperturbed.
Moreover, extensive studies have also demonstrated that homeo-
static synaptic plasticity elicited by NMDA receptor block by
ketamine occurs rapidly within hours consistent with the time
course of ketamine action [60, 95, 97]. To date reverse genetic
studies, taking advantage of mice carrying mutations in several
that
signaling nodes along this signaling pathway, suggest
ketamine’s direct effect at synaptic NMDARs is necessary and
sufﬁcient to account for the behavioral effects [60, 95, 98].

KETAMINE EFFECTS ON INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING TO
MEDIATE ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTION
Earlier
studies on the mechanisms of action of classical
antidepressant in preclinical models established a strong causal
link of BDNF and subsequent signaling via TrkB receptors as a key
mediator of antidepressant action [99, 100]. Ketamine’s fast-acting
antidepressant action is also dependent on BDNF, speciﬁcally
rapid translation and synthesis of BDNF protein in hippocampal
dendrites [60]. Mice with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism,
which impairs trafﬁcking of BDNF mRNA to dendrites, also show
attenuated responses to ketamine [101], although ketamine
appears to retain efﬁcacy in humans who are homozygous for
the Met allele of BDNF [49]. The form of synaptic scaling elicited
after ketamine administration discussed above has also been
shown to be strictly dependent on BDNF-TrkB signaling
[60, 95, 98].

The identiﬁcation of a key requirement for BDNF-TrkB signaling
in ketamine action provided a starting point to investigate the
intracellular signaling that produces rapid antidepressant action.
This effort lead to elucidation of the essential role of eukaryotic
elongation factor 2 and its phosphorylation by its dedicated
kinase, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K),
in this
process.

eEF2 kinase is a calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
(also called CaMKIII), which activity is maintained by a high afﬁnity
interaction with calcium-calmodulin complexes. Due to the high

Fig. 1 Converging synaptic signaling pathways underlying ketamine action. The ﬁgure depicts a basic synaptic circuit where an excitatory
pyramidal neuron receives inputs from other excitatory neurons as well as inhibitory neurons. At excitatory glutamatergic synapses onto
excitatory neurons, glutamate release and NMDA receptor activation leads to activation of eEF2 kinase, triggering eEF2 phosphorylation and
silencing of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) translation. Ketamine-mediated NMDA receptor blockade, in turn, ceases tonic eEF2
kinase activity, resulting in a gradual loss of eEF2 phosphorylation and de-suppression of BDNF translation, ultimately triggering TrkB receptor
signaling. TrkB signaling and subsequent rapid homeostatic synaptic plasticity is required to elicit not only rapid effects of ketamine but also
its sustained effects.
In the meantime, ketamine-mediated transient reduction of excitatory drive onto inhibitory interneuron resident
NMDARs is postulated to suppress tonic release of GABA and disinhibit activity of the target excitatory neurons. The resulting increase in
glutamatergic activity produces downstream activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) function to elicit structural plasticity and
produce the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. While the two pathways may act synergistically, it is important to note that mTOR
may also acts as a downstream target for TrkB signaling, which may be a point of convergence of the two pathways. These initial synaptic
plasticity events trigger sustained effects of ketamine via transcriptional processes. This ﬁgure was made by BioRender.

afﬁnity nature of this interaction, even resting levels of calcium
signaling triggered by spontaneous glutamate release mediated
NMDA receptor activation is sufﬁcient to maintain its activity [102].
Detailed analysis of synaptic signal transduction events associated
with ketamine action on NMDA receptors provided evidence that
ketamine blockade of tonically activated NMDA receptors results
in suppression of these resting calcium signals and inhibition of
eEF2K activity, resulting in dephosphorylation of eEF2 and de-
suppression of dendritic protein synthesis in particular of BDNF.
BDNF,
in turn, via activation of postsynaptic TrkB receptors
promotes the insertion of AMPA receptors, that produces the
novel form of synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus that
underlies the rapid antidepressant action [60, 95, 98] (Fig. 1).
Recent studies have speciﬁcally localized BDNF and TrkB to the
CA3-CA1 axis in the hippocampus as necessary for the anti-
depressant effects and underlying ketamine induced synaptic
potentiation [98]. Here, selective deletion of BDNF or TrkB in
presynaptic CA3 or postsynaptic CA1 regions of the Schaffer
collateral pathway, demonstrated BDNF-TrkB signaling in CA1 was
required for the rapid synaptic and behavioral action of ketamine
while revealing a speciﬁc synaptic locus for ketamine’s rapid
antidepressant effects [98]. In separate work, the requirement for
BDNF-TrkB has been proposed to be due to ketamine, as well as
conventional antidepressants, to directly bind to the transmem-
brane region of TrkB and facilitate BDNF release. While this work
suggests a common mechanism for all antidepressant action, it is
not entirely clear how direct binding to TrkB would account for

the differences in timing of
conventional antidepressants [103].

MECHANISMS UNDERLYING LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF
ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS
Recent studies have begun to uncover how intracellular signaling
mechanisms that produce the acute antidepressant action of
ketamine transition to a sustained effect that may last over a week
[104]. This work elucidated several key aspects of sustained
ketamine action. First, the acute translation-dependent effect of
ketamine is required to trigger its sustained effect. Second, the
sustained effect relies on transcriptional
regulation, which is
elicited by the initial synaptic plasticity. Finally, the transcriptional
mechanisms underlying sustained ketamine effect requires the
speciﬁc function of Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2).

Fig. 2 Role of presynaptic disinhibition of glutamate release in ketamine action. The ﬁgure depicts an alternative basic synaptic circuit
where an excitatory pyramidal neuron receives inputs from other excitatory neurons, where inhibitory inputs regulate the extent of glutamate
release from primary excitatory neurons. While this circuit is not mutually exclusive with the one presented in Fig. 1, it highlights the role of
NMDA receptors on inhibitory neurons and their impact on regulation of glutamate release. According to this “disinhibition” model, ketamine
predominantly acts on inhibitory interneurons, curtailing their tonic NMDAR dependent activity and in turn augmenting excitability of
glutamatergic neurons as well as ensuing glutamate release. This increased glutamate release activates postsynaptic AMPA receptors leading
to activation of mTOR signaling. This ﬁgure was made by BioRender.

induce MeCP2 Ser421 phosphorylation in the brain and thereby
regulate MeCP2 dependent functions including spine maturation
[106, 111–113].

As stated above, recent ﬁndings demonstrated a causal
link
between initial homeostatic neuroplasticity events elicited by
ketamine and subsequent transcriptional mechanism that sustains
ketamine’s behavioral effects. According to these results, the
ketamine elicited AMPA receptor dependent synaptic potentiation
induces a subsequent shift in excitation-inhibition balance towards
excitation that ultimately leads to increases in MeCP2 Ser421
phosphorylation. Previous work has shown an increase in MeCP2
Ser421 phosphorylation broadly alters the MeCP2-dependent
transcriptional landscape and thus acts as a global regulator of
transcription, and likely impacts expression of target genes [106]. In
agreement with this premise, in the context of ketamine action
MeCP2-dependent transcription may augment long-term synaptic
adaptations, in particular the magnitude of the synaptic potentia-
tion seen in animal models and augmented ketamine responses
seen in patients after repeated ketamine administration.

Acute subanesthetic ketamine increases MeCP2 Ser421 phos-
phorylation in the hippocampus a week after treatment but not in
the initial hours after injection when the rapid antidepressant
response occurs. These effects were speciﬁc to MeCP2 and were
not paralleled by changes in other transcriptional factors [104].
The requirement
for MeCP2 Ser421 phosphorylation in the
sustained antidepressant action of ketamine was tested speciﬁ-
in which Ser421 was
cally in Mecp2 S421A knock-in mice,
converted to an alanine such that endogenous MeCP2 is no
longer phosphorylated at this site. MeCP2 S421A knock-in mice
administered an acute injection of ketamine displayed rapid
antidepressant-like effects, however, the sustained antidepressant

action was no longer observed. The observation that MeCP2
Ser421 phosphorylation is required for prolonged but not rapid
antidepressant action has a precedent in earlier work on classical
antidepressants [114]. Based on current ﬁndings, one can propose
a mechanistic model in which the initial translation dependent
effects of ketamine [60, 95] are maintained via activation of a
positive feedback loop where enhanced synaptic potentiation
maintains enhanced transcriptional activity to prolong the initial
effect. However, these ﬁndings and the associated models leave
open the question why and how this positive feedback loop
eventually gets broken and the antidepressant effect diminish
with time.

As stated above, this initial and rapid antidepressant protein
translation component involves the rapid increase in BDNF protein
synthesis which drives the downstream intracellular signaling of
MeCP2. Endogenous BDNF is also a potent activator of mTOR,
which had previously been proposed to trigger rapid antidepres-
sant action. Previous work demonstrated that ketamine’s effects
on mTOR are not initial engagement at the synapse but rather
downstream of BDNF and are not
the rapid
antidepressant effects [54]. This data agrees with recent clinical
work showing that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, does not
attenuate ketamine’s rapid antidepressant action but may prolong
it. It is possible that mTOR signaling is linked in some way to the
intracellular signaling pathway that triggers downstream tran-
scriptional MeCP2 processes to produce sustained processes.
Further studies are needed to further dissect this intracellular
signaling pathways and determine whether MeCP2 and mTOR are
linked.

The involvement of MeCP2 is also particularly intriguing as it
plays a critical role in spine maturation [106, 111–113]. A recent

study found that spinogenesis is critical
in sustaining the
antidepressant action of ketamine but not in its rapid effects.
Spinogenesis is well studied in early development, however these
initial spines are not functional and undergo synapse maturation
to become functional. The ketamine mediated structural effect on
spinogenesis requires intracellular signaling, which may involve
MeCP2 processes,
in order to produce functional changes on
neurotransmission that mediate the sustained action. Collectively,
taken together these data strongly support further investigation
into the intracellular signaling of MeCP2 and its links to mTOR and
spinogenesis in order to elucidate potential points for therapeutic
drug discovery. While preclinical studies provide a framework to
investigate mechanisms of ketamine action, clinical studies have
also provided mechanistic insight.

TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES EXAMINING PRECLINICAL
MECHANISMS
Clinical studies showed ketamine transiently increases cortical
glutamate release in a manner that is related to the magnitude of
its antidepressant effects. Ketamine increases nearly every index
of cortical activity in healthy humans including glucose metabo-
lism measured with 18F-deoxyglucose-PET [115, 116] and MR-
based measures of oxygen metabolic rate and cerebral blood ﬂow
[117]. Early!H-MRS studies in healthy subjects described ketamine-
related increases in voxel glutamate or glutamine levels in frontal
cortex that were associated with the transient emergence of
psychotic symptoms or cognitive impairment [118, 119]. Subse-
quently, a 13C-MRS involving the infusion of 13C-glucose as a
metabolic tracer, in a mixed group of healthy subjects (n = 14) and
MDD patients (n = 7), described a 13% increase in 13C-glutamine
enrichment,
i.e., an increase in VCycle, that correlated with the
emergence of dissociation symptoms [70]. This study was not
powered to detect differences in glutamate release in the
depressed patients and healthy subjects. Ketamine increases in
glutamate release were linked to antidepressant response using
PET mGluR5 imaging [120]. The paradigm builds on evidence that
glutamate released by ketamine can reduce ligand (11C-ABP688,
18F-FPEB) binding to mGluR5 in two ways,
through direct
competition of glutamate and the PET ligand and by stimulating
mGluR5 internalization [121]. Consistent with the 13C-MRS study,
ketamine produced a 14% reduction in 11C-ABP688 binding in
depressed patients and an 19% reduction in ligand binding in
healthy subjects. In the depressed patients (n = 13), reductions in
hippocampal ligand binding correlated (r = 0.52, p = 0.035) with
improvement in depression [120].

for

The involvement of BDNF dependent homeostatic synaptic
the observation that extracellular
plasticity may account
glutamate levels surge after ketamine administration [70] and
the increase in glutamate release correlates with the magnitude of
the antidepressant response [120]. Several previous studies have
shown homeostatic synaptic plasticities that elicit rapid dendritic
BDNF synthesis are also coupled to augmentation of presynaptic
glutamate release probability presumably via retrograde action of
dendritically released BDNF [116]. In the hippocampus, there is
also strong evidence that BDNF-TrkB signaling can regulate
presynaptic release probability [122]. Therefore, it is plausible to
that ketamine-induced increases in BDNF levels may
expect
augment presynaptic glutamate release in a manner that scales
with the efﬁcacy of BDNF signaling as postulated by clinical
studies.

In animals, pretreatment with AMPAR antagonists prevents the
emergence of the antidepressant effects of ketamine [123] and is
tied to the induction of a speciﬁc form of homeostatic synaptic
plasticity. While there is much discussion on plasticity as a
mechanisms of ketamine action, there are different types of
plasticities and speciﬁcity is important. For example, psychoplas-
togens is a term coined to highlight fast-acting therapeutics that

produce rapid changes in synaptic plasticity. However, by this
deﬁnition psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine are
psychoplastogens although one would not advocate for their use
as rapid antidepressants for the treatment of depression. Instead,
it is important to focus on the speciﬁcs of the type of plasticity
which could potentially be harnessed by other drugs in advancing
therapeutic options. While there is strong agreement on homeo-
rapid
static synaptic plasticity underlying the mechanism of
antidepressant action, this hypothesis has yet to be tested directly
in humans.

In contrast,

As noted earlier, the antidepressant effects of ketamine in
animals is associated with activation of mTORC1 (increases in
pmTOR/mTOR). When directly injected into the brain, the mTOR
antagonist, rapamycin, attenuates the antidepressant effects of
ketamine [87].

impact ketamine’s rapid antidepressant
rapamycin does not

the rapid
behavioral effects [60]. Rapamycin may produce complex time-
dependent effects on mTOR, including activation [124]. This might
help to explain why pretreatment with a low dose of rapamycin
(6 mg, po) two hours prior to ketamine administration extended
the duration of the antidepressant effects of ketamine rather than
blocked them [125]. The role of mTOR in antidepressant action is
also supported by evidence of antidepressant activity of a direct
mTOR activator [126, 127].

required for

Recent clinical studies have also suggested that the antide-
pressant effects of ketamine may be associated with restoration of
synaptic efﬁcacy. The clearest preliminary signal with respect to
the restoration of synaptic efﬁcacy comes from a MEG study that
showed that a single dose of ketamine failed to modulate the
magnitude of sensory evoked potentials in healthy subjects or
non-responding patients. However, depressed patients who
responded to ketamine showed an increase in the amplitude of
their sensory evoked response [128, 129]. Ketamine also has been
shown to restore deﬁcits in cortical
resting-state functional
connectivity, as assessed with fMRI [130, 131].

To date there has been a single pilot study directly addressing
whether the antidepressant response to ketamine is associated
with restoration of synapse density [132]. This study reported on
three groups of subjects: healthy subjects (n = 7), depressed
patients without synaptic deﬁcits (n = 6), and depressed patients
with synaptic deﬁcits (n = 6). Both groups of depressed patients
improved with ketamine. However, only the deﬁcit group showed
increases in ligand binding to the SV2A tracer suggestive of
increases in synaptic density and SV2A binding increases that
correlated with improvement in depression.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The discovery of ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects in
patients with depression and treatment
resistant depression
fostered a renaissance in clinical as well as preclinical neuropsy-
chiatry. Ketamine’s rapid clinical efﬁcacy indicated that symptoms
of depression can be alleviated in patients with long history of
resistance to conventional treatments within hours. The rapidity of
ketamine action focused preclinical studies on fast synaptic
signaling mechanisms and away from structural alterations
associated with longer treatments such as synaptic rewiring and
neurogenesis. These ﬁndings may suggest that ketamine’s rapid
antidepressant action is due to its ability to induce homeostatic
plasticity and not necessarily to ‘ﬁx’ depression. In other words,
the production of homeostatic plasticity may be a ‘masking’ effect
than ﬁxing the
to alleviate symptoms of depression rather
underlying causes of the disorder.

The requirement for homeostatic plasticity to produce the
behavioral effects of ketamine also provides a potential novel
therapeutic opportunity. Would the identication of compounds
that directly target homeostatic plasticity represent a new avenue

for treatment? In preclinical studies, this hypothesis was tested by
proof of principle experiments. Retinoic acid receptor activaction
produces rapid upscaling of homeostatic plasticity similar to
ketamine but does not
its
intracellular signaling pathway [133]. The retinoic acid signaling
pathway is not required for ketamine mediated antidepressant
action but direct activation of this pathway produced rapid
antidepressant-like effects. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that
compounds that elicit this form of homeostatic upscaling is
sufﬁcient
for antidepressant action although this hypothesis
requires clinical validation.

Another critical aspect of research is sustaining the antidepres-
sant effects of ketamine. One approach may be the administration
of ketamine to elicit the rapid antidepressant effects and then
speciﬁc targeting of the downstream signaling pathway to extend
the antidepressant effects without
repeated
ketamine. This type of approach may prove advantangeous in
avoiding repeated ketamine dosing that may be required for the
treatment of depression in the long-term.

the need for

As this article illustrates, studies aimed at addressing ketamine’s
mechanism of action built a direct bridge between basic synaptic
signaling mechanisms and clinical practice. For decades, neurop-
sychiatric studies have centered around “slow” neurotransmission
predominantly carried out by monoaminergic neurotransmitters
[134]. Today, ketamine action and the role of fast glutamatergic
neurotransmission in the pathogenesis and treatment of mood
disorders present a new set of opportunities and challenges. In
order to fully harness the emerging potential of fast neurotrans-
mission in neurotherapies,
it will be critical to uncover novel
therapeutics to target fast neurotransmission that do not impair its
fundamental function in sensory processing as well as learning
and memory processes. For this purpose, it is essential to tap into
parallel pathways of signaling carried out by distinct forms fast
neurotransmission as well as uncover multiple signaling mechan-
isms that co-exist within single synapses at nanoscale. These
efforts will also continue to inspire and direct future studies aimed
at other effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders,
especially those with fewer side effects, rapid onset and sustained
efﬁcacy.
