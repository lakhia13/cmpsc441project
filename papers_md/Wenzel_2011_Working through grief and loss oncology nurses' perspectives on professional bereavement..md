Abstract

Purpose/Objectives—To determine facilitators and barriers to managing patient loss from the 
combined perspectives of oncology nurses and to extract essential components of a supportive 
intervention.

Research Approach—Qualitative, descriptive.

Setting—The comprehensive National Cancer Institute–designated cancer center of a mid-
Atlantic university teaching hospital.

Participants—34 nurses from inpatient and outpatient adult and pediatric oncology units.

Methodologic Approach—Focus groups were held with oncology staff nurses to identify 
challenges regarding work-related bereavement, current support for managing grief and loss, and 
how to support interpersonal functioning and resiliency.

Main Research Variables—Work-related bereavement, bereavement support, and 
interventions and management strategies for bereavement and loss.

Findings—Two primary themes emerged: dimensions of work-related loss and working through 
bereavement. Participants also provided many concrete suggestions for the creation of a 
supportive self-care environment.

Conclusions—Support issues were numerous, multilevel, and varied. However, addressing 
those concerns can improve job satisfaction and decrease compassion fatigue. The findings lay the 
foundation for appropriate interventions to assist nurses in managing those situations.

Interpretation—Administrators, managers, and individuals interested in furthering the 
multifaceted goals of oncology care, including nurses themselves, are challenged to create and 
maintain mutually supportive environments for providing optimal care to patients and families.

The global demand for highly skilled, experienced oncology nurses continues to grow 
because of increased disease incidence and improved cancer survivorship. However, 
predicted oncology workforce shortages may negatively affect both the quantity and quality 
of cancer care, including related areas such as research, healthcare access, and survivorship 
in the 21st century. To date, staff and faculty shortages have decreased the number of nurses 
receiving specialized oncology education and training (Institute of Medicine, 2009).

In spite of growing evidence that experienced oncology nurses contribute to high-quality 
cancer care and improved patient outcomes, administrators in oncology settings commonly 
face multiple challenges to nurse retention, including inadequate staffing levels, high patient 
acuity requiring complex care delivery, and long work hours (Buerhaus, Donelan, 
DesRoches, Lamkin, & Mallory, 2001). Caring relationships fostered by oncology nurses 
also may be associated with emotional burden (Showalter, 2010; Walton & Alvarez, 2010; 
Yoder, 2010) that can be exacerbated by increased workloads, heightened client acuity and 
complexity, and repeated contacts with patients who are suffering. This burden may become 
overwhelming during situations in which nurses lack experience, skills, or sufficient 
professional and social support to manage their own psychological health (Sabo, 2008). 
Nurses providing care to patients who are suffering or actively dying also may experience 
trust issues, loss of independence, and decreased capacity for intimacy, as well as loss of 
control (Figley, 1995), anxiety, anger, and irritability (Lerias & Byrne, 2003). Stressful 
events experienced by nurses caring for patients in life-threatening situations also can lead to 
intrusive imagery, defined as “fragments of specific autobiographical events or imaginal 
extensions of such events that predominantly possess sensory qualities and enter awareness 
suddenly and unintentionally” (Boelen & Huntjens, 2008, p. 217). Therefore, nurses may 
relive and re-experience traumatic events repeatedly in their minds. Those psychological 
disturbances can have personal and professional consequences (Sabo, 2008). Responsibility 
for delivering therapies that may increase symptoms or negatively affect patients’ quality of 
life, even temporarily, also can increase stress for nurses and may lead to feelings of 
powerlessness, helplessness, and hopelessness (Abendroth & Flannery, 2006; Byrne & 
McMurray, 1997; Medland, Howard-Ruben, & Whitaker, 2004).

Experienced, professional oncology nurses contribute significantly to patients’ well-being 
and clinical outcomes, in addition to advancing the art and science of oncology nursing. 
Replacing those nurses during situations in which they are unable to remain in either their 
specialty or institution is extremely difficult and requires significant amounts of time, effort, 
and financial resources. Therefore, a better understanding of bereavement and sources of 
support to bolster individual and communal coping with acute and chronic loss may be 
important factors in reducing care fatigue and retaining experienced oncology nurses.

Important tasks for nurses who care for dying patients include understanding the process 
related to bereavement and effective assessment of social support for themselves and for 
patients and families (Medland et al., 2004). Oncology nurses must be skilled in those tasks 
while also coping positively with all bereavement-related issues (Medland et al., 2004). 
Dorz, Novara, Sica, and Sanavio (2003) reported higher emotional exhaustion levels among 
oncology staff than in those caring for patients with HIV or AIDS. For nursing staff, the 
difficulty of providing care to dying patients is exacerbated by current and projected 
increases in the aging population and the fact that extensive care is provided to patients and 
families at the end of life (Ferrucci et al., 2003; Given & Sherwood, 2006; Vincent & 
Velkoff, 2010).

Prior research has demonstrated that nurses should be aware of the effects their work can 
have on their own health, as well as the health of their patients (Byrne & McMurray, 1997). 
Adverse effects on health have been noted among care providers working with patients at 
the end of life, but little is known about this work in relationship to the psychosocial health 
and well-being of nurses (Sabo, 2008). Lack of support during periods of this type of job-
induced stress has been shown to lead to psychological distress (AbuAlRub, 2004). 
Concepts such as compassion fatigue and burnout also have been used to describe those 
phenomena in the literature, although factors distinguishing compassion fatigue from 
burnout remain controversial (Aycock & Boyle, 2009). Compassion fatigue is defined as a 
severe malaise that results from caring for patients who are in pain or suffering (Sabo, 
2006). Maslach, Shaufeli, and Leiter (2001) defined burnout as a prolonged response to 
chronic physical or emotional stressors that results in exhaustion and ineffectiveness. 
Although other similar concepts with overlapping definitions also have been used in the 
literature, compassion fatigue most closely reflects the experiences of oncology nurses 
(Aycock & Boyle, 2009). In those instances, increased absenteeism, loss of productivity, and 
the choice to leave the workplace (or the specialty of oncology nursing altogether) may 
occur (Medland et al., 2004). Subsequent losses to institutions, patients, families, and the 
future of the specialty have been noted (Abendroth & Flannery, 2006). Conversely, a 
supportive environment, coupled with an understanding of how to recognize and properly 
manage personal bereavement, can assist nurses to avoid early burnout (Dorz et al., 2003) 
and compassion fatigue (Abendroth & Flannery, 2006). When supported in time-sensitive 
and helpful ways, nurses can create a culture of wellness and self-respect that gives them a 
wider range of interpersonal functioning and greater resiliency.

At the mid-Atlantic university teaching hospital where the current study was conducted, the 
turnover rate of oncology nurses had been increasing steadily from 13.3% in 2001 to 16.7% 
in 2004. The use of agency nurses to fill vacant positions over prolonged periods of time had 
become standard practice for the gynecology-oncology inpatient unit. Nursing 
administration at the hospital was aware of the fact that staff expended significant physical 
and emotional energy in caring for their patients. Administrators also were aware that nurses 
experienced acute or latent feelings of loss, grief, or a perceived loss of meaning in 
situations with undesirable outcomes including, but not exclusive to, death.

The hospital staff understood that strategies to assist oncology nurses in managing the stress 
of work-related bereavement should be tailored to specific work settings, and a need existed

to explore factors to build resilience among nurses at risk for compassion fatigue (Sabo, 
2008). Therefore, administrators, nursing staff, and faculty from the university teaching 
hospital’s National Cancer Institute–designated comprehensive cancer center and the 
affiliated school of nursing collaborated on a study designed to inform a planned program of 
support for oncology nurses encountering situations involving bereavement and loss. The 
current study was designed using focus groups to identify issues surrounding work-related 
bereavement, characterize current support, and elicit participant suggestions for supportive 
interventions for managing bereavement and loss.

Methods

Focus groups were conducted with a voluntary sample of staff nurses recruited from every 
inpatient and outpatient adult and pediatric oncology area in the university teaching hospital. 
In keeping with the specific aims, groups were constructed to help the study team 
characterize challenges regarding work-related bereavement and nurse perceptions of 
existing support for managing loss. Participants also were asked to provide suggestions on 
how to improve existing support in bereavement situations.

Focus groups have become an increasingly popular method for nurse researchers interested 
in eliciting attitudes and opinions of target populations regarding sensitive or 
underinvestigated topics (Barbour, 2005). This highlights the ability of focus groups to 
facilitate efficient data collection and elicit participant views related to experiences 
involving motivations, feelings, attitudes, and opinions on key issues (Burns & Grove, 2005; 
Madriz, 2000). Advantages of using focus groups include (a) being less intimidating than 
one-on-one interviewing but providing more depth than questionnaires, (b) having 
sensitivity to participants’ culture and age by acknowledging participants as experts, (c) 
obtaining insight into participants’ own language and concepts, (d) allowing group 
interactions, (e) permitting researchers to learn more about the degree of consensus on a 
topic (Barbour, 2005; Burns & Grove, 2005), and (f) encouraging dialogue and dialectic 
(i.e., the exchange of ideas, arguments, and counter arguments) between researchers and 
participants to mutually identify, describe, analyze, and attempt to resolve key issues (Agar, 
1999). Those insights can be used to develop programs that strengthen nurses’ coping skills 
to reduce stress, foster supportive work relationships, and reduce burnout (Hellgren, 
Naswall, Sverke, & Soderfelt, 2003; Shaha & Rabenschlag, 2007).

Study Procedures

Electronic, written, and verbal communications were used to encourage nurses to volunteer 
for the focus groups. Staff nurses were encouraged to notify their nurse managers of their 
desire to participate. Nurse managers also identified potential staff nurse participants for 
each focus group based on unit staffing needs and nurses’ years of oncology nursing 
experience. The latter criterion was essential to ensure that the stresses and support needs of 
oncology nurses were appropriately identified across the full spectrum of experience. 
Participants were allowed to count focus group attendance as work hours and were paid 
commensurately, with assurance from their nurse managers that staffing would be provided 
to allow for group participation. Sign-up sheets posted in work areas were helpful for

estimating focus group size, although signing up was not considered binding. A reminder 
notification system for all participating units also was implemented; however, some nurses 
who signed up did not attend.

The seven focus groups that were held consisted of four to eight participants each (N = 34) 
and included staff nurses with varied levels of skill and experience from every inpatient and 
outpatient unit of the cancer center. Optimal group times were soon before or after shift 
changes, in the early afternoon, and around lunch or dinner time. A light meal was served as 
a small incentive. On arrival, participants received an oral consent and a copy of the focus 
group interview guide. Oral consent was obtained following procedures approved by the 
institutional review board. As part of the oral consent process, permission was sought from 
all participants to tape-record the focus groups. Sufficient time was provided to allow all 
participants to carefully read through the consent document and to ask questions before the 
start of focus groups. To ensure confidentiality, study team members who were not likely to 
be in direct contact with participants were selected to lead the groups. Participants self-
selected pseudonyms that were used throughout the focus groups.

Study assistants met prior to the focus groups to strategize group procedures and to assign 
primary responsibilities for running the sessions. Specific procedures and steps followed 
throughout the study have been detailed elsewhere (Shaha, Wenzel, & Hill, 2011). In this 
way, the study members were prepared for and able to appropriately manage issues that 
arose through having nurse participants talk about difficult experiences of loss.

During the focus groups, the moderator began by asking participants to describe a patient 
situation in which they experienced either grief or a sense of loss. Next, participants were 
asked to describe what was helpful and what was less helpful in managing the bereavement 
issue. Finally, the moderator asked participants to describe what they believed would be the 
essential components of a program to help nurses in a similar situation. The moderator 
supplemented each major question by using transition and clarifying, challenging, and 
probing questions to yield more accurate and in-depth responses. Open-ended comments 
also were solicited from participants at the completion of each group. Focus groups lasted 
about 45 minutes to one hour, excluding a 10-minute warm-up.

Data Analysis

Content analysis frequently is applied to focus group data and allows for quantitative 
assessments in conjunction with categorical descriptions of the major ideas and opinions 
expressed (Burns & Grove, 2005; Curtis & Redmond, 2007; Mansell, Bennett, Northway, 
Mead, & Moseley, 2004; Mayring, 2002, 2007). After focus group data were recorded and 
professionally transcribed verbatim, open and selective coding was applied to identify 
categories and themes related to the burden of everyday nursing care (Kean, 2000; 
Rabenschlag & Shaha, 2007; Shaha & Rabenschlag, 2007). Data analysis included the use 
of ATLAS.ti and Folio Views® software packages. Thematic analysis then was applied to 
focus group transcripts to obtain a better understanding of all concepts and issues identified 
by nurse participants. Field notes were maintained to record study team members’ 
observations and perceptions of participants and events as well as insights related to each of 
the focus groups. Pairing content analytic approaches with thematic analyses allowed the

study team to effectively extract themes emerging from the focus group data (Cutcliffe & 
McFeely, 2001).

Findings

Analysis led to the identification of two themes. The first, dimensions of work-related loss, 
was divided into three categories: losing life and hope, job-related factors that exacerbate 
bereavement and loss, and outsider misperceptions and misunderstandings. The second 
theme, working through bereavement, represented resources and relationship issues as being 
subsumed into three categories: individual strongholds, team strength in debriefings and 
dialogues, and renewal through patient and family relationships. Those themes and related 
categories have been presented in order of predominance and emphasis by participants 
across focus group discussions. Finally, participants’ recommendations for improving 
organizational levels of support were provided (see Table 1).

Dimensions of Work-Related Loss

Loss of life and hope—The oncology nurse participants acknowledged that work at a 
large teaching facility was personally, physically, and psychologically demanding (see 
Figure 1). They also perceived that aspects of the care environment were insufficiently 
supportive to meet those higher demands. According to the nurses, patient situations could 
be stressful and demanding and they did not always perceive effective support to be 
available or accessible. Rapid deterioration of a patient’s health condition or sudden death 
was particularly difficult for nurses to accept and manage. Nurses’ descriptions of situations 
in which they experienced patients’ rapid deterioration of health conditions were rife with 
feelings of helplessness and frustration. In those situations, negative emotional states were 
exacerbated by limited time to process and manage feelings of loss. Time typically was 
limited by the pressing needs of other patients and the unit, which could be especially 
difficult to balance because of nurses’ preexisting sense of loss. In addition, nurses 
experienced a loss of hope and feelings of discouragement when patients were diagnosed 
with recurrences. If untempered, those emotional losses were described as negatively 
affecting nurses’ ability to remain positive in subsequent patient-related situations. One 
nurse said, “It is hard to be this person that offers hope in the beginning. . . . It gets harder 
and harder to offer that.”

During situations in which disease progression occurred and patients were perceived to be at 
the end of life, nurses described conflicting feelings regarding perceptions of what one nurse 
referred to as “last-ditch effort(s).” She explained, “They want to try everything they can.” 
Another nurse stated, “I think there’s always that little bit of extra optimism—that little bit 
of extra hope.” Prolonged attempts to sustain the lives of acutely ill patients near death, 
whether directed by the patients themselves, family, or providers, clearly were draining for 
nurse participants, created conflicting feelings about the care delivered, and were associated 
with feelings of dissatisfaction related to patients’ experiences at the end of life.

The last-ditch efforts provoked moments of feeling helpless or overwhelmed for the nurses. 
For example, one nurse recalled, “I think what was difficult in my situation was that we 
were unable to give him [help]. You know, stopping the chemo[therapy] and sending

someone home for a week or two before they die, or helping them through the dying 
process.” One nurse’s statement appeared to capture the overall sentiment of those 
discussions: “I felt kind of helpless in a way.”

Close attachments that developed when caring for patients over time also enhanced feelings 
of grief and loss. When nurses developed close relationships with patients and their families, 
they found it much more difficult to accept the end or to move on to the next patient. In 
remembering a particular patient, one nurse said, “I think everyone had gotten so attached to 
him—we really did feel a loss.” Some nurses reported trying to avoid close attachments. 
Another nurse echoed, “Usually I don’t do that, because it’s not good to get so attached all 
the time.”

Job-related factors that exacerbate bereavement and loss—Nurses perceived 
specific challenges and enhanced burden related to working at a large teaching facility and 
caring for very ill patients, many of whom were at the end of life and still receiving 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One nurse said, “Working in a tertiary university institution 
is stressful and demanding. Little time remains for respite or recreational breaks.”

Coupled with those demands, nurses often reported days that were so busy that they could 
barely find time for a break. One nurse said, “The unit is just so busy that it’s like you don’t 
have time to even sit down and be upset about something and process it.” They described 
how this lack of time to “defuse” and the inability to find the necessary time or space to rest 
exacerbated difficulties related to bereavement. A nurse said, “It would help . . . to have, 
like, time during the day.” Another added, “On the average day, I think people should be 
allowed to leave and not feel guilty.”

Collaborating with ancillary staff and other healthcare professionals within the organization 
occasionally was perceived to be burdensome. One participant explained, “The unfortunate 
part about the ancillary staff is they’re not—they don’t get to see the patients and the 
families and have the humbling experience it is to take care of somebody who is dealing 
with something like a chronic illness.” Nurses believed that improvement in system-level 
processes and interactions with ancillary staff would increase their own work satisfaction 
and decrease frustrations, particularly while simultaneously balancing patient needs and self-
managing work-related losses.

Participants identified nursing care issues involving other healthcare professionals. In one 
nurse’s words, “I think it’s frustrating, too. Sometimes you’re dealing with other 
departments, and you sit there and you think: ‘Do we all work for the same place?’” 
Participants believed that the high demands on their job were not necessarily conducive to 
an efficient and effective work environment. Added worry and time spent to resolve those 
issues was perceived as an additional burden that was detrimental to helping nurses find 
balance between loss and the ever-present demands of caring for patients with cancer.

Although nurses recognized the caring intent of other healthcare professionals, they also 
identified difficulties in communicating with personnel outside of nursing, particularly

medical colleagues. Physicians often were perceived to be distant from the nurses’ 
environment and perspectives, which resulted in misunderstandings and potential conflicts.

Outsider misperceptions or misunderstandings—Overall, nurses found it difficult 
to unburden themselves outside the hospital. Many did not believe that “outsiders” could 
really understand the issues that they had to face at work. In the participants’ experiences, 
outsiders often depicted oncology as alien and extraordinary. In addition, the actual amount 
of work that nurses had to complete and the kind of work they did all day often were 
difficult for others to understand. One nurse explained, “I think it’s more frustrating to talk 
to—it makes me more upset to talk to people who don’t get this.” Another added, “Or they 
say—oh, you work with kids, you play with kids all day.” Therefore, nurses’ ability to 
effectively communicate their experiences with others outside of the profession constituted a 
deficit of support in their personal lives.

Working Through Bereavement

In spite of numerous barriers to effective management of bereavement issues, oncology 
nurse participants also identified a number of perceived facilitators of support. (see Figure 
2).

Individual strongholds—The first category encompassed all individual measures that 
nurses in the study described as beneficial. The nurses’ daily routines constituted a high 
work load with little time left for critical reflection. Lack of time to ponder certain issues 
was considered by some nurses to be beneficial and supportive to their coping.

Participants reported accessing various coping resources, such as religion and faith or sports. 
In one nurse’s words, “I’m also religious and like, I know that [the patient is] going to a 
better place and isn’t suffering so much.” Another stated, “I take a lot of baths. Just other 
things to pamper myself. I do, like, massages and things like that, and just relax. And I do 
have quiet time.” Nurses also reported other coping strategies, such as limiting the amount 
of time spent talking about work at home.

Team strength in debriefings and dialogues—For all nurses, the healthcare team 
was a potential resource for managing bereavement. “So, yeah to have people who are in 
your same situation is very, very helpful,” said one nurse. Another reported, “I had a lot of 
team support, like our unit and everything.” Not only did colleagues experience the same 
situations together, but they also benefited from discussing those events with one another, 
which allowed them to debrief and reduce their collective stress. One participant stated, “I 
have certain people on my unit that I find easier to talk to that I can kind of vent.”

On every unit in this particular cancer center, each nurse had an assigned preceptor or 
mentor. The mentor was another member of the team whom the nurse could turn to for 
guidance and support. The role was considered by some nurses to be beneficial in dealing 
with the rigors and stress of oncology nursing. Nurses also commented on the advantages of 
the multidisciplinary team.

Debriefing sessions with a psychiatric liaison nurse or members of the pastoral care team 
were another helpful source of support identified by some nurse participants. One participant 
stated, “We also have unit debriefings whenever someone passes away. We have our 
bereavement coordinator and things that come and we sit and we talk.”

Depending on the unit, nurses would request pastoral care or ask the psychiatric liaison 
nurse to arrange a debriefing session following a loss. In particular, the psychiatric liaison 
nurse would sometimes hold rounds. During those rounds, nurses were able to bring up 
discussion topics of their own. One participant shared, “I know many years ago we had, like, 
a regular opportunity to have what we used to call psychosocial rounds, and we had a 
regular time and a regular person who used to come to the unit. And I think we all looked 
forward to it.” However, the usefulness of this strategy was individually determined, as 
participants recognized that not everyone found those opportunities to be helpful. Debriefing 
sessions and psychosocial rounds were considered helpful, as described by a nurse who said, 
“It was phenomenal . . . just knowing you would have that outlet [psychosocial rounds] on a 
weekly basis, I just thought that was really valuable. I would love to see something like that 
started again.”

Renewal through patient and family relationships—Nurse participants believed that 
their relationships with patients helped them put their work into perspective and supported 
their ability to derive some meaning from those difficult situations. Nurses also experienced 
support from patients’ families, particularly when the families maintained contact with the 
nursing staff. As one nurse pointed out, “I mean some parents try to keep in touch, and some 
people, some families keep in touch for years.” Another stated: “Even after the family 
member has passed on, the family will come back to the unit.” Those nurses described 
enjoying close associations with the patients and their families.

The nurses also faced certain difficult expectations from patients. A participant said, “They 
want that kind of exuberance and crazy optimism [from you].” Patients did not always want 
a completely realistic presentation of the future from their nurse. Nurses reported the 
challenge of having to be empathetic, supportive, and nonjudgmental while also maintaining 
a sense of the realistic outcomes.

Close attachments to patients fostered relationships. “I think the helpful thing is that you 
know them really well,” said one nurse. Another participant described such a relationship: 
“Just a nice person, close to my age, you know, I think you often put yourself in that 
position and think how you would respond.”

Nurses identified that they were committed to “do the best job” for patients. Their work 
experiences with patients and families reinforced the commitment and also gave nurses 
positive feedback. One nurse said, “I felt like I was the right person there at the right time, 
and I just felt that I did my best job.” Another asserted, “You know you want to give [the 
patient] a positive feeling.” One nurse said, “I think we kind of get our internal kudos by the 
job itself.” Nurses were clear about their motivations, which they described as being a part 
of what attracted them to the specialty and also allowed them to remain in oncology despite 
the hardship of managing professional bereavement and loss.

Suggestions to Implement or Supplement Organizational Support

Participants also were asked to describe various measures of support that the organization 
should provide or that were already in place and perceived to be helpful (see Figure 3). The 
suggestions ranged from individualized support and patient services to the creation of 
meditation rooms or quiet spaces on nursing units. Some nurses suggested that development 
of an inpatient hospice unit would be therapeutic for nursing staff, patients, and families.

Nurses also promoted having a regular opportunity to take a break and leave the floor. “I eat 
and I sit—I try and go outside. I clear my mind, I don’t think about things,” said one 
participant. Those opportunities were not always possible, but they were appreciated. “Last 
week, they [nurse colleagues on the unit] said they finally got off the unit—they were all 
excited—must have been about four or five of them, they were able to go to lunch,” a nurse 
shared. Some nurses took deliberate action to create breaks from the unit. Nurses identified 
currently existing support from the organization with regard to their education and careers; 
they also appreciated opportunities to attend conferences.

Discussion

Oncology care offers rewarding challenges and the opportunity to develop meaningful 
relationships with patients and families, but the rewards are coupled with the reality that 
some patients eventually will pass away (Maree & Wright, 2008; Sehlen et al., 2009). 
Oncology care focuses on providing cure whenever possible, as well as comfort and 
palliative care in cases in which cure is not achievable (Bakitas et al., 2009; Goelz et al., 
2010). In particular, the dilemma of cure and end-of-life care has been found to influence 
oncology nurses and contribute to high burden and stress (Rohan & Bausch, 2009; Sehlen et 
al., 2009). Nurses and other healthcare professionals operate in a high-technology 
environment where they encounter advances in medical and other research on a daily basis, 
which can be both exciting and stressful (Mukherjee, Beresford, Glaser, & Sloper, 2009). 
For all nurses, collaborative relationships with other healthcare professionals must be 
maintained to provide the best and most appropriate care for patients and their families, and 
those interfaces can become another source of stress. For nurses in the current study, the 
stress and difficulty of managing bereavement professionally was offset by their recognition 
of the importance of providing essential assistance to patients and families at critical times. 
However, study participants also commented on the amount of turnover and burnout they 
had witnessed in oncology settings, as well as the detriments to cancer care that occur when 
continuous professional bereavement and loss are not well managed.

Perceived deficits in support emerged as one finding, highlighting the fact that oncology 
nurses’ levels of support may be too low to manage bereavement. Therefore, the participants 
experienced distress and discomfort that paralleled findings from previous studies 
(Mukherjee et al., 2009; Rodrigues & Chaves, 2008; Turner et al., 2007b; Williamson, 
2008). A national survey e-mailed to Oncology Nursing Society chapter presidents (N = 
103) found that the most common form of on-site professional resource for oncology nurses 
was an employee assistance program (60%), followed by the availability of pastoral care 
(50%) and access to a counselor or psychologist (22%) (Aycock & Boyle, 2009). However, 
17% of survey respondents indicated an absence of on-site professional resources for

nursing staff. Among respondents who indicated resources were present at their institutions, 
many reported limitations to use or barriers to access. The finding suggested that even when 
professional resources are made available, institutions may need to ensure that nursing staff 
are aware of them and able to access them when needed (Aycock & Boyle, 2009).

Nurse participants in the current study also emphasized high personal and peer expectations 
for themselves and the quality of care they provided. Those definitions were inferred from 
the nurses’ perceptions of their employing institution. Although the employer does not 
provide a generalized nursing mission statement, the institution has a high ranking in the 
United States. Focus group participants’ elevated expectations for themselves were not a 
surprise given that the nurses worked at an institution globally recognized for its oncology 
care. Although a paucity of research has focused on nurses’ individual perceptions and 
expectations of care delivery and its influence on burnout or resiliency, nurses in the current 
study perceived multiple internal and external pressures to perform. Treatments generally 
necessitate regular visits to the treatment centers, together with regular follow-ups, usually 
across five years. When patients experience recurrence, follow-up visits and treatment 
sequences can extend for long periods of time, and close relationships between patients, 
families, and healthcare professionals often result. In addition, end-of-life care fosters close 
attachments among patients, families, and healthcare providers, independent of time.

Despite the advances in cancer care, oncology healthcare providers are aware that cure and 
patient survival can be limited. A large number of patients encountered by oncology 
professionals will pass away at some point. Therefore, the transitory nature of life is 
highlighted in oncology (Kearney, Weininger, Vachon, Harrison, & Mount, 2009; Lee, 
Cohen, Edgar, Laizner, & Gagnon, 2006; Quinal, Harford, & Rutledge, 2009; Rohan & 
Bausch, 2009; Sinclair & Hamill, 2007; Turner et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2009). However, 
issues of loss and bereavement continue to be insufficiently addressed in the oncology 
workplace. The inclusion of death and dying and content on grief and bereavement has been 
recommended for nursing curricula (Byrne & McMurray, 1997); the current study’s findings 
support the importance of emphasizing those issues for nurses. Despite the 
recommendations, Aycock and Boyle (2009) found that 45% of nurse respondents indicated 
they had not received education or skill-development opportunities addressing work-related 
coping. In addition, only 30% of respondents indicated they had received periodic in-
services related to workplace coping, the most common type of education offered. Although 
End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) courses are considered a mandatory 
requirement for preparing new nurses, no survey respondents indicated that the courses were 
mandatory at their workplaces, and only 17% reported that optional ELNEC courses were 
available. Therefore, nurses across the United States appear to experience a lack of 
educational resources that address their concerns related to workplace coping; the current 
study’s participants also discussed this problem.

Nurses’ experiences with work-related bereavement and grief are complex and different 
from other forms of grieving (Gerow et al., 2010). As demonstrated by the current study’s 
findings, the deficits of support for nurses dealing with loss and bereavement issues in 
oncology settings are numerous, multilevel, and varied. However, evidence shows that 
addressing concerns similar to those described in the current study can improve job

Limitations

satisfaction and decrease the health-impairing consequences of compassion fatigue, such as 
burnout (Quinal et al., 2009).

Discussions with nurse participants concerning perceived deficits of support resulted in a 
number of concrete suggestions to improve the management of bereavement at multiple 
levels. The participants were notably more focused on enhancing personal resources and on 
the general work environment in their recommendations for managing bereavement than on 
educational interventions. Not surprisingly, end-of-life and palliative care issues were a 
distinct and important component of oncology nurses’ discussions in the context of their 
care.

Participants were not individually evaluated or followed over time. Therefore, 
interpretations based on the particular bereavement and loss situations related to each 
participant should be interpreted with some caution. The study had potential for differential 
recall bias among participants because conducting all groups immediately following or at 
the time of a grief or bereavement experience was not possible. Despite limitations to the 
overall sample size, data saturation was observed. Pairing content analytic approaches with 
thematic analyses allowed the study team to effectively extract themes emerging from the 
focus group data (Cutcliffe & McFeely, 2001). The current study focused on the nursing 
staff of one large U.S. teaching hospital, which may differ considerably from other 
healthcare environments. No objective measures of participants’ levels of bereavement or 
underlying depressive or mood distress were collected during the study, but screening for 
underlying depressive or mood disorders should be considered by researchers investigating 
similar topics in the future. Demographic information was not collected to increase 
confidentiality for the nursing staff, which limited opportunities to comment specifically on 
issues such as years of oncology experience, age, and level of education. The inability to 
create groups separated by specialty because of recruitment challenges and limited sample 
size increased diversity in the group discussions but also prevented the authors from drawing 
comparisons between specialties (e.g., differences between pediatric and adult oncology care 
settings). However, although services available might have differed across settings, 
bereavement and loss experiences were very similar in the way they were described by 
participants. In addition, the inclusion of participants from all areas increased the 
transferability of the findings.

Conclusions and Implications for Nursing Practice

The current study’s findings enhance the understanding of the loss and bereavement 
experiences of oncology nurses and lay a foundation for designing appropriate interventions 
to assist nurses in managing those situations. Overall, information from the current study 
may assist nurses, organizations, and policymakers by facilitating a better understanding of 
the challenges and competing issues involved in managing bereavement and loss in 
oncology nursing staff. The current study also specified the types of support nurses should 
be encouraged to access in an effort to pursue professional and life goals while 
simultaneously providing competent and compassionate care to patients, families, and 
communities. Nurses, administrators, managers, and all individuals interested in providing
