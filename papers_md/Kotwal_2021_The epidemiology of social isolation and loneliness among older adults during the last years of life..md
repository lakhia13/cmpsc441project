Measurements: We defined social isolation using a 15-item scale measuring household 
contacts, social network interaction, and community engagement, and frequent loneliness using 
the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine their 
adjusted prevalence by time prior-to-death and by subgroups of interest.

Results: Approximately 19% experienced social isolation, 18% loneliness, and 5% both in the 
last four years of life (correlation=0.11). The adjusted prevalence of social isolation was higher 
for individuals nearer to death (4 years: 18% vs 0–3 months: 27%, p=0.05) and there was no 
significant change in loneliness (4 years: 19% vs 0–3 months: 23%, p=0.13). Risk factors for both 
isolation and loneliness included (p<0.01): low net-worth (Isolation: 34% vs 14%; Loneliness: 
29% vs 13%), hearing impairment (Isolation: 26% vs 20%; Loneliness: 26% vs 17%), and 
difficulty preparing meals (Isolation: 27% vs 19%; Loneliness: 29% vs 15%). Factors associated 
with loneliness, but not social isolation, included being female, pain, incontinence, and cognitive 
impairment.

Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness are common at the end of life, affecting 1 in 4 
older adults, but few experience both. Rates were higher for older adults who were poor and 
experienced functional or sensory impairments. Results can inform clinical efforts to identify and 
address end-of-life psychosocial suffering and health policies which prioritize social needs at the 
end of life.

INTRODUCTION

In the last years of life clinicians have traditionally placed an intense focus on the 
diagnosis and treatment of disease and physical symptoms. Social well-being may be 
equally important to individuals and their families. A national survey found that up to 85% 
of older adults and caregivers prioritized social goals at the end of life, including sharing 
time with close friends, the presence of family, not dying alone, and being able to help 
others.1 Older adults who experience social isolation or loneliness, two distinct markers of 
social well-being, may be less likely to realize these end-of-life goals and are at risk for 
worsened symptoms and quality of care.2–4 A recent National Academy of Sciences report 
highlighted the need for clinicians to be aware of and actively address the health effects of 
social isolation and loneliness.5 Moreover, the 2018 National Consensus Project for Quality 
Palliative Care included social aspects of care as a core domain for the provision of high 
quality medical care to patients with serious illness.6 However, little is known regarding the 
epidemiology of these key markers of social well-being at the end of life.

Older adults may be uniquely vulnerable to experiencing social isolation and loneliness 
(defined in Figure 1) in the last years of life.3 Older adults may become more isolated due to 
widowhood, disability, and cognitive impairment. Those living in isolation may struggle at 
the end of life to access to sources of emotional, financial, and caregiver support to alleviate 
physical or psychological discomfort.7 Similarly, older adults may be less able to cope with 
loneliness in the last years of life, as compared with earlier in the lifespan when loneliness 
can be a transient feeling which motivates individuals to reconnect with relationships or 
the community.8–11 Left unaddressed, loneliness may cause significant emotional, physical 
and existential distress.12, 13 In national surveys, social isolation and loneliness have a low 
correlation (r<0.20), but it is unknown how related these experiences are to one another

in the last years of life.14 A higher correlation between these two markers might indicate 
that an intervention could impact both through similar mechanisms. A low correlation might 
instead suggest a need for separate interventions to address each social need.

A better understanding of the magnitude of isolation and loneliness at the end of life, their 
relationship to one another, and subgroups at risk can highlight the potential for clinical 
and social interventions to reduce social suffering, an underappreciated focus of current 
approaches to medical care at the end of life. In this study, we therefore used a nationally­
representative cohort of older adults, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), to examine 
participants who responded to survey questions on social isolation and loneliness within 
four years of death. Our objectives were to determine: 1) the overall prevalence of social 
isolation and loneliness and their relationship to one another in the last years of life; 2) if the 
prevalence differs by time prior-to-death; and 3) the prevalence among sociodemographic 
and clinical subgroups.

METHODS

Study Sample

The HRS collects data on a nationally-representative cohort of adults ≥51 years old 
who are interviewed biennially until death.15 In 2006, the HRS began administering an 
extensive Psychosocial Leave-Behind Questionnaire (LBQ) which includes measures of 
social isolation and loneliness.16 Our study cohort included HRS participants who died by 
the year 2018 who completed the LBQ within four years of death. Overall, 5,976 primarily 
community-dwelling HRS participants over age 50 were invited to complete the LBQ in one 
of the two HRS waves before death, 3,822 (64%) of whom completed the interview. We 
excluded 209 participants with incomplete responses to the LBQ, resulting in a final sample 
of 3,613 decedent subjects who completed the LBQ within 4 years of death.

Social Measures

Social Isolation was defined based on three dimensions of social relationships as outlined 
by Shankar et al. (2011) and prior published social isolation scales,17–21 with cut-offs 
adapted to assess end-of-life isolation (extensive description in Supplementary Materials 
and Supplementary Figure 1). Each of the three dimensions was standardized to create 
a separate subscale ranging from 0–2 points with more points indicating more social 
connections. First, we measured household and core contacts including: marital status, 
household size, and having nearby children. Local or in-home contacts are important 
to the provision of end-of-life support. Second, we measured social network interaction, 
which assessed the frequency of contact with children, family, or friends through in-person, 
e-mail, or phone interactions.18 Third, we examined community engagement, including the 
frequency of participation in religious services, other community groups, or community 
volunteering.7, 22, 23 Community engagement can contribute to a sense of belongingness 
in the community or the ability to help others, which can improve quality of life among 
seriously ill older adults.1, 24 The three subscales were combined to create an overall social 
connectedness scale which ranged from 0–6 points, with 0–2 points representing social 
isolation.17

Loneliness was measured using the validated 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (Range 0–6 
points),25 which includes three questions asking the frequency participants feel they lack 
companionship, are left out, or are isolated from others (Responses: “Hardly ever or never” 
(0 points), “Some of the time” (1 points), or “Often” (2 points); Range of 0–6 points). We 
categorized loneliness in two ways. First, as “any loneliness” if they scored 1+ points on 
the scale.26 Second, as “frequently lonely” if they scored 4+ points on the scale, requiring a 
response of “often” to at least one of the three questions.25 We focus primarily on frequent 
loneliness as this may represent a more significant source of emotional distress in the last 
years of life.

Time of Death

We used the HRS date-of-death and date-of-interview variables to determine how long prior 
to death the participant responded to survey questions.27 We focused on the last four years 
of life since serious illness might affect quality of life and social activities for multiple 
years prior to the last months or years immediately preceding death. In addition, a larger 
timeframe increased statistical power for subgroup comparisons.

Sociodemographic, Clinical, and Functional Subgroups

Sociodemographic factors included age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, 
and net worth.28, 29 Clinical factors included self-reported chronic conditions (diabetes, 
heart disease, lung disease, cancer, hypertension, and stroke),7, 30 pain, and recent 
hospitalizations.8 Functional status measures included vision impairment, hearing 
impairment, urinary incontinence, ognitive impairment (Cognitive Impairment Not 
Dementia (CIND) and Dementia),31 difficulty performing six Activities of Daily Living 
(ADLs) (bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating, walking across a room), difficulty 
performing five Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) (using a phone, managing 
finances, taking medications, shopping for groceries, and preparing hot meals),32 and 
difficulty walking one block.

Statistical Analysis

For objective 1, we determined the national prevalence of social isolation and loneliness in 
the last four years of life, and used logistic regression to describe the adjusted prevalence 
of loneliness by each dimension of social isolation. In addition, we used Chi-Square tests 
to compare the prevalence of social isolation and loneliness in our sample of decedents to a 
sample of non-decedents (n=3,156) who survived 4 years or longer after the HRS interview, 
matched on age, gender, and race/ethnicity.

For objective 2, we determined the unadjusted prevalence of social isolation and loneliness 
by time prior-to-death by dividing the sample into 3-month serial cross-sections prior to 
death. Evidence suggests the time between interview and death is random,8, 9, 33 and that 
observations at any time point are representative of the underlying sample of older adults at 
that time point. We then used separate multivariable logistic regression models to determine 
the prevalence of social isolation, social isolation sub-scales, and loneliness by time prior-to­
death, adjusting for age at death, sex, race/ethnicity, and education. We did not adjust for 
comorbidities or functional status as we expected these factors to lie on the causal pathway

between time prior to death and risk for each social factor. For each model, we tested 
different functional forms for the time covariate, including linear, quadratic, and restricted 
cubic spline to determine if the prevalence time trend changed at certain points prior to 
death. Based on comparisons using Wald tests, we present the results of linear models.

For objective 3, we determined the adjusted, model-based probabilities of social isolation 
and frequent loneliness by sociodemographic and clinical subgroups for the overall sample 
of decedents. Adjusted models included the following covariates: time before death, age 
at death, sex, race/ethnicity, education, comorbidities, and ADL impairments. We did not 
adjust for multiple comparisons as the goal of the analysis was exploratory in nature.34

We anticipated selection effects to occur over the four years prior to death, since respondents 
are likely to experience more physical or cognitive impairment closer to death, which might 
limit their participation in HRS interviews. To address this, we used inverse probability 
weighting, accounting for age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, net worth, cognitive 
status, functional status, and presence of chronic conditions, in all analyses to adjust for the 
lower response rates among certain subgroups closer to death.35 All analyses accounted 
for the complex sampling design, differential probability of selection, and differential 
probability of response to core and LBQ interviews. The analyses were performed using 
STATA 16.1 and SAS 9.4.36, 37

Demographic and health characteristics of our sample of decedents are summarized in 
Table 1. Overall, the mean age of our sample was 78 years at death and 50% were 
female, 11% African American/Black, and 21% had a net worth of <$6,000. Approximately 
19% were socially isolated, 18% reported frequent loneliness, and 5% experienced both 
(r=0.11). The adjusted association between each social isolation item and frequent loneliness 
is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Frequent loneliness occurred at higher rates 
(p<0.001) among those who were unmarried, lived alone, had low interaction with children 
or friends, and had less engagement with volunteer work, religious services, or community 
groups. In comparing our sample of decedents to a matched sample of those surviving 
longer than 4 years after the HRS interview, decedents were more likely to report social 
isolation (19% vs. 10%, p<0.001) and loneliness (18% vs. 11%, p<0.001).

We next examined the differences in prevalence for social isolation and loneliness by 
time prior-to-death. The adjusted population prevalence of social isolation was higher for 
individuals closer to death, increasing gradually (18% at 4 years to 27% at 0–3 months 
prior to death, p=0.050) (Figure 2A). As expected, this relationship was no longer significant 
after adjusting for ADL impairment and comorbidities. Examining social isolation subscales 
revealed a higher prevalence of low social network interaction (4 years: 57% versus 0–3 
months: 68%, p=0.003) and low community engagement (4 years: 42% versus 0–3 months: 
53%, p=0.01) by time prior to death, whereas household contacts were consistent over time 
(4 years: 45% versus 0–3 months: 47%, p=0.6) (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 2). The 
prevalence of “frequent loneliness” (18% at 4 years to 23% at 0–3 months prior to death,

p=0.13) or “any loneliness” (66% at 4 years to 72% at 0–3 months prior to death, p=0.09) 
did not differ significantly by time prior to death (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 2).

We determined sociodemographic and clinical risk factors significantly associated with 
social isolation and loneliness in the full sample of decedents (p-value of <0.001 unless 
otherwise stated) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Low net-worth was associated with 
isolation (<$6000: 34% vs >$239,000: 14%) and loneliness (<$6000: 29% vs >$239,000: 
13%). Functional or sensory impairments associated with isolation and frequent loneliness 
included difficulty with preparing hot meals (Isolation: 27% vs 19%; Loneliness: 29% vs 
15%), walking one block (Isolation: 25% 18%, p=0.04; Loneliness: 26% vs 15%), and 
hearing impairment (Isolation: 26% vs 20%, p=0.02; Loneliness: 26% vs 17%).

Notably, several factors were associated with feelings of frequent loneliness, but not 
isolation, including sex (female: 23% vs male: 17%, p=0.004), current pain (24% vs 
18%, p=0.02), vision impairment (24% vs 17%, p=0.006), and incontinence (27% vs 16%, 
p<0.001). With higher levels of cognitive impairment, individuals had frequent loneliness 
(Normal: 16%, CIND: 21%, Dementia: 25%, p=0.01), whereas this was not significant 
for social isolation (Normal: 19%, CIND: 22%, Dementia: 25%, p=0.07). Individuals with 
lung disease had higher rates of social isolation (27% vs 20%, p=0.03), but no significant 
difference in loneliness.

DISCUSSION

In a nationally-representative sample of older adults in the last four years of life, we found 
high rates of social isolation and loneliness, two key markers of social well-being, across 
the last four years of life. The prevalence of social isolation had a small, but significant 
increase to over 1 in 4 older adults in the last months of life, suggesting that isolation 
may intensify at the end of life as individuals experience worsening function or health as 
death approaches.9, 38 Nearly 1 in 5 older adults in our sample reported frequent loneliness, 
and over two in three reported any loneliness, substantially higher than the prevalence 
in the general US population of older adults.26 Loneliness is therefore a substantial, and 
potentially unrecognized, source of emotional distress in the last years of life. Notably, 
social isolation and loneliness were generally non-overlapping social experiences, with 
only 5% experiencing both. Study findings highlight the potential for clinicians to improve 
quality of life of older adults in their last years of life by asking about social needs and 
taking initial steps to improve social well-being.

Even with a relatively strict definition of social isolation, over 1 in 4 older adults were 
isolated in the last 3 months of life, substantially higher than the prevalence among matched 
non-decedents in HRS and rates among the general population of older adults.39 We 
hypothesize that those nearer to death may be selectively pruning their social relationships 
to focus on their closest relationships (socioemotional selectivity theory),40 or might 
experience co-occurring life events which lead to social losses (e.g. widowhood or death of 
friends). In addition, declines in functional status or health may contribute to social isolation, 
since the association between isolation and time prior-to-death was no longer significant 
after adjusting for ADL impairment and comorbidities. While some reduction in social

activity is likely normal, the high prevalence of social isolation, as defined in our study, 
suggests older adults are commonly facing challenges associated with isolation at the end 
of life. Examples of such challenges might include a lack of access to end-of-life emotional 
support (e.g. for new onset anxiety or depression),4 instrumental support (e.g. transportation 
to medical appointments), caregiver support (e.g. to access services like home hospice), or 
a health care proxy.41 Future research might examine if socially isolated individuals in turn 
have higher symptom burden, lower hospice use at the end of life, and more ED or ICU 
visits.

Our study similarly suggests that loneliness may be more common in the last years of 
life compared to earlier in the lifespan. Prior national studies found that approximately 
35–40% of older adults experienced “any” feelings of loneliness compared to 70% in our 
study,26 and 11% of non-decedents in HRS experienced “frequent” loneliness as compared 
with 18% in the last four years of life. Yet, the prevalence of loneliness did not increase 
for individuals closer to death when we examined separate time-intervals in the last 4 
years of life. This is consistent with prior literature finding depression, anxiety, and other 
psychological states may not change substantially based on proximity to death.42 We 
hypothesize that individuals may change or downgrade their subjective perception of what 
constitutes an adequate level of social connectedness as they near death.43 In addition, 
end-of-life loneliness may occur through pathways unrelated to the frequency of social 
network interaction, including from existential distress, anticipatory grief, or a feeling of 
disconnection from one’s community;12, 44 these dimensions of loneliness may not have 
been fully captured by the 3-item UCLA scale. Further research including a qualitative 
component might examine how perceptions of loneliness differ among seriously ill older 
adults at high risk of death.

The high overall prevalence of social isolation and loneliness suggests clinicians should 
identify and screen for each marker as a first step to addressing psychosocial suffering 
at the end of life. Asking is particularly important as patients may not raise the issue on 
their own due to the stigma of self-identifying as lonely or isolated.3 Notably, each social 
condition should be identified separately as it is uncommon for individuals to experience 
both loneliness and isolation. Use of the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale or the Berkman­
Syme social isolation scale can help clinicians track changes over time and be aware of 
clinically meaningful thresholds.3, 25

Once identified, clinicians may be unsure how to take steps to appropriately intervene, 
since evidence-based interventions specific to seriously ill older adults are lacking.5 We 
therefore suggest an individualized approach to addressing loneliness, social isolation, or 
both. For loneliness, clinical strategies can start by acknowledging the emotional distress 
patients experience from loneliness, asking whether the patient wishes for more social 
contact, and connecting patients with programs to enhance social connections and support. 
Psychological interventions to address end-of-life loneliness might include dignity therapy 
by chaplaincy,45 art therapy (e.g. the “UnLonely Project”),46 and therapies which address 
maladaptive cognition. Identifying loneliness may inform strategies to address associated 
end-of-life symptoms like pain,4 psychological distress,47 and prior life experiences of 
trauma, which can be amplified by the distress of loneliness.48 Notably, results suggested

cognitive impairment was a significant risk factor for loneliness, possibly due to difficulty 
maintaining social networks and limited emotional coping.22 Further research is needed 
on how interventions might be adapted to the unique needs of older adults with cognitive 
impairment.

In contrast to loneliness, strategies to address end-of-life social isolation may center more 
on mobilizing external clinical or community support services and early advance care 
planning.41 Concerningly, most hospice agencies will not accept isolated patients who do 
not have a caregiver.49 Clinicians should work with social workers to identify alternatives 
such as so-called “bridge” programs that bill the Medicare Home Health benefit, residential 
hospice facilities, and for Veterans, a hospice contract with a skilled nursing facility.

Our results are suggestive of modifiable risk factors common to both end-of-life social 
isolation and loneliness which can be tested in future interventions. Difficulty preparing hot 
meals, for example, was strongly associated with both isolation and loneliness. Connecting 
patients with community centers or food programs which allow for shared experiences 
through cooking, communal dining, and the ability to eat favorite foods may therefore 
be helpful in building social connections and well-being.50, 51 Functional and sensory 
impairments such as difficulty walking, difficulty shopping, and hearing impairment were 
strongly associated with social isolation and loneliness and might be addressed by providing 
assistive devices. Finally, low net-worth, the strongest risk factor in our study for both 
isolation and loneliness, might be considered when making referrals and helping patients 
qualify for community programs.

When possible, it may be better to pursue upstream interventions (in the years rather 
than months prior to death) to maintain or enhance relationships and reduce the risk 
of end-of-life isolation and loneliness. In our study and others,26 social isolation and 
loneliness were highly prevalent in the years prior to death, long before the last months 
of life. Preventative interventions might start with primary care clinicians encouraging the 
maintenance of healthy social behaviors during annual or routine visits, or early referrals 
to community-based programs. Overall, clinical, policy, and public health experts should 
advocate for prioritizing social needs just as traditional medical needs are prioritized; the 
United Kingdom’s national Campaign to End Loneliness serves as a useful model for how 
an integrated national effort can meet this complex challenge.52

Our study has limitations. First, we anticipate a selection bias where respondents 
experiencing physical or cognitive impairment may be less likely to participate in HRS 
in interviews closer to death. We used inverse probability weighting, which might 
reasonably address this limitation.35 Nevertheless, results are primarily generalizable to 
older adults able to respond to survey questions at the end of life. Severely impaired 
individuals less likely to participate in the survey may experience more loneliness or social 
isolation, suggesting our prevalence estimates are conservative. Second, the study is cross­
sectional with each interview occurring at different time points prior to death and roughly 
representative of the general population prevalence at that point before death. Longitudinal 
assessments at frequent time intervals are needed to fully understand the timing and risk 
factors for changes in social isolation and loneliness at the end of life. Third, there is a lack

of consensus on how to best measure social isolation among seriously ill older adults. We 
defined social isolation based on prior measures and used strict thresholds more likely be 
associated with detrimental end-of-life clinical consequences (Supplementary Materials).21 
Fourth, the HRS did not administer social measures to individuals living in nursing facilities 
or individuals with severe enough cognitive impairment to require proxy interviews,53 
populations for whom the impacts of social isolation and loneliness may differ from the 
community-dwelling population studied here.

In conclusion, we found that social isolation and loneliness are common in the last years 
of life and identified sociodemographic and clinical subgroups at risk. Identifying and 
addressing these social needs in health care assessments represent an important clinical 
opportunity to reduce suffering in the last years of life.

Key points:

In a nationally-representative sample of older adults interviewed in their last 4 years of 
life (N=3,613), social isolation and loneliness were common at the end of life affecting 1 
in 4 older adults, although few experience both.
