Abstract
Objective: To provide analysis and commentary on Australian state/territory child and adolescent mental health
service (CAMHS) expenditure, inpatient and ambulatory structure and key performance indicators.
Method: Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Bureau of Statistics were de-
scriptively analysed.
Results: Between 2015–16 and 2019–20, overall CAMHS expenditure increased by an average annual rate of 3.6%. Per
capita expenditure increased at a higher rate than for other subspeciality services. CAMHS admissions had a higher cost
per patient day, shorter length of stay, higher readmission rate and lower rates of signiﬁcant improvement. Adolescents
aged 12–17 had high community CAMHS utilisation, based on proportion of population coverage and number of
service contacts. CAMHS outpatient outcomes were similar to other age-groups. There were high rates of ‘Mental
disorder not otherwise speciﬁed’, depression and adjustment/stress-related disorders as principal diagnoses in com-
munity CAMHS episodes.
Conclusions: CAMHS inpatient admissions had lower rates of signiﬁcant improvement and higher 14-day readmission
rates than other ages. Australia’s young population had a high outpatient CAMHS contact rate. Evidence-based
modelling of CAMHS providers and outcomes may inform future service improvement.

that 13.9% of Australians aged 4–17 had a mental disorder in
the preceding 12 months.4 ADHD was the most common,
affecting 7.4% of the young population, followed by anxiety
disorders (6.9%), major depressive disorder (2.8%) and
conduct disorder (2.1%). A recent meta-analysis found an
average of 44% of children and adolescents with mental
disorders received services in high-income countries.5 In this
context, the 2021 National Children’s Mental Health and
Wellbeing Strategy (NCMHWS)1 recommended increased
funding for public Australian child and adolescent mental
health services (CAMHS).

We investigated recent trends for Australian CAMHS in-
patient and ambulatory services, expenditure and key
performance indicators (KPIs) prior to the NMCHWS. We
examined the most recent CAMHS data (2019–20) to
establish current services and outcomes. We also exam-
ined a 5-year period between 2015–16 and 2019–20, to
allow future research to comment on the effect of the
NMCHWS on CAMHS structure and outcomes.

outpatient services and their KPIs were evaluated, within the
context of AIHW deﬁnitions of services and usage (Table 1).
We analysed data for those aged under 18, excluding spe-
ciﬁcally designated youth mental health services (MHS).

Results
Expenditure

Total CAMHS expenditure increased by an average annual
rate of 3.6% between 2015–16 and 2019–20. Acute CAMHS
expenditure increased by an average annual rate of 4.5%,
whereas expenditure on non-acute CAMHS, including re-
habilitation and extended care services, decreased by 4.9%
during this time period. Per capita expenditure on Australian
CAMHS increased at an average annual rate of 2.2% between
2015-16 and 2019–20, which was higher than the 1.1%
increase for general adult and the 1% decrease for older
persons services. This was less than the increases of 3.6% and
13% for forensic and youth services, respectively (Figure 2).

Methods

We descriptively analysed data from the World Health
Organisation (WHO), the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) and the National Mental Health Establishments Da-
tabase (NMHED), published by the Australian Institute of
Health and Welfare (AIHW).6 Australian CAMHS inpatient,

Between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the number of CAMHS public
hospital beds increased from 278 to 312, with acute beds
increasing from 245 to 272. Despite expenditure de-
creasing for non-acute CAMHS, the number of non-
acute CAMHS beds increased from 34 to 40. CAMHS
had a relatively low number of per capita inpatient

‘Public sector specialised mental health hospital services can be categorised based on program type,

for prolonged dysfunction or risk to self and/or others
Non-acute care refers to all other admitted patient programs, including rehabilitation and extended
care services’
‘Patient days are days of admitted patient care provided to admitted patients in public psychiatric
hospitals or specialised psychiatric units or wards in public acute hospitals and in residential mental
health services. The total number of patient days is reported by specialised mental health service
units. For consistency in data reporting, the following patient day data collection guidelines apply:
Admission and separation on the same day equals 1 day; all days are counted during a period of
admission except for the day of separation; and leave days are excluded from the total’
‘Average cost per patient day is determined by dividing the total recurrent expenditure of the
specialised mental health service by the total number of patient days (as presented in AIHW
Specialised mental health care facilities data)’

population, compared to 31.9 for general adults and
22.1 for older persons. This was greater than the 3.4-
per-100,000 for forensic and 2.4-per-100,000 for youth
services in 2019–20 (Table 2). There were only 9 CAMHS
residential beds in Australia (0.2 per 100,000), all located
within NSW. There were 6.7 youth residential MHS beds per
100,000 (71% of beds located in Victoria).

The number of Australian public hospital CAMHS beds
increased by an average annual rate of 3% between 2015–16
and 2019–20, a rate higher than general adult ((cid:1)0.2%), older
persons ((cid:1)2.6%) and forensic (1.3%), but less than youth
(15.2%) beds (Figure 3).

Ambulatory/community
Children aged 0–4-year-olds (0.2%) and 5–11-year-olds
(1%) had the lowest and second lowest proportion of total

portion of (3.4%) across all age-groups.

Children under 12 years had a low community CAMHS
contact rate per 1000 population in 2019–20, with 15.7
contacts for 0–4-year-olds, and 129.5 for 5–11-year-olds.
This increased for adolescents, with 12–17-year-olds
having a rate of 673.5-per-1000 population, the highest
of all recorded age-groups. Between 2015–16 and 2019–
20, the community CAMHS contact rate for 12–17 years
increased by 4.9%, a larger average annual change than
for 5–11 years (0.1%) and 0–4 years ((cid:1)0.9%) or any other
age-group.
In 2019–20, the most common principal diagnosis for
CAMHS outpatient episodes for all young age-groups was
‘Mental disorder not otherwise speciﬁed (MD-NOS)’
(Table 3). The principal diagnosis for 0–4-year-olds and 5–
11-year-olds were childhood-speciﬁc emotional, behav-
ioural or developmental disorders. Depressive episodes,
anxiety disorders and eating disorders emerged as

Most recent outcome measures
In 2019–20, 57.7% of Australian public CAMHS patients
reported signiﬁcant improvement after an admission,
which was less than the 72.2% for the total population.
CAMHS admissions had higher rates of no improvement
after an inpatient episode (32.8%), compared to all ages
(22.9%). The average length of stay (LOS) for CAMHS
inpatient episodes was 8.8 days, compared to 11.7 days for
general adult and 35.1 for older persons admissions.
CAMHS had a 21-day public hospital readmission rate of
19.5%, higher
forensic
than older persons
(13.2%), general adult (14.9%), but less than youth
(22.6%) services. The average cost per acute admitted
patient day was AUD$2553 for CAMHS, higher than the
AUD$1342 for general adults, AUD$1444 for forensic-
patients and AUD$1158 for older persons.
52.4% of CAMHS patients reported signiﬁcant improve-
ment after a completed ambulatory episode in 2019–20,
compared to 50.7% for all ages. CAMHS also had rate of
signiﬁcant deterioration after a completed outpatient
episode of 5.7%, in comparison with 6.4% for all ages.

Discussion

Despite a decrease in the proportion of Australians aged
less than 18 years, per capita CAMHS expenditure in-
creased at a relatively higher rate in comparison to all
other MHS. Our descriptive analysis shows that inpatient
CAMHS had the highest cost per patient day, with a lower
rate of signiﬁcant improvement, and a higher rate of no
improvement after an episode.
These ﬁndings could be due to increased complexity in
treating young people, for example, managing familial
discord.7 Perhaps young people are receiving longer ad-
missions for conditions that do not necessarily respond
well to inpatient treatment, such as mental distress from
personality related factors, abnormal illness behaviour,
bullying and child protection issues around placement.
This requires further research as to the reasons for these
possible care effectiveness shortfalls.

CAMHS had relatively low per capita bed numbers and
LOS compared to other populations, possibly due to lower
rates of more serious mental illnesses and higher rates of
conditions that do not require prolonged inpatient care.
Young people may have greater at home family/carer
support compared to some other age-groups, perhaps
reducing the requirement for inpatient care.
Australians aged 12–17 had relatively high outpatient MHS
utilisation (proportion of total population seen and service
contacts), and rates of depression and adjustment/stress-related

disorders. The cause of this is likely multifactorial, with social
media and smartphones8 implicated as having a negative effect
on youth mental health. Certain scenarios common in
CAMHS such as weight-monitoring in anorexia nervosa re-
quire frequent contact and so may artiﬁcially inﬂate the
contact rate. Perhaps the trend to broader, and less well-deﬁned
mental health and illness concepts,9 as well as prominent
youth mental health advocacy are also factors in these ex-
tremely high service utilisation rates. Broadly the high contact
rates could also possibly relate to a small proportion of ado-
lescents being seen at high frequency, inﬂating total contact
rates for this age-group.

MD-NOS was the most common outpatient principal
diagnosis for all age-groups. This may be due to increased
diagnostic complexity in young persons, limitations in
diagnostic manuals and/or a reluctance to diagnose due to
fear of inducing stigma.10

Limitations

Australia has many health services with differing structure
and AIHW data may not accurately represent regional
MHS funding and utilisation. Headspace consumers ac-
cess MBS reimbursements, but there’s no reported data
available from AIHW or other sources.

not captured in the AIHW data. Further studies should
examine workforce, models of care and other data col-
lected by the Australian Mental Health Outcomes Col-
lection Network. It would also be useful for the AIHW to
provide a nomogram of service contact rates to determine
if the high contact rates in CAMHS could be related to
a small number of consumers being seen at extremely
high frequency.

Future

We recommend evidence-based modelling of Australian
CAMHS, as well as organisations such as headspace, and
the private sector, to inform policy and system reform.11
Advocacy should be focused on how effective, outcome-
based, services can be implemented. Collection of real-
time, real-world data could inform CAMHS how to better
improve outcomes.12
