Background: Dissociation is a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal, subjective integration of
one or more aspects of psychological functioning, including memory, identity, consciousness, perception, and
motor control. A limited number of studies investigated combat-related dissociation.
Objective: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between dissociative symptoms and
combat-related trauma.
Method: This study included 184 individuals, including 84 patients who were exposed to combat and diagno-
sed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Group I), 50 subjects who were exposed to combat but were
not diagnosed with PTSD (Group II), and 50 healthy subjects without combat exposure (Group III). The
participants were evaluated using the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) to determine their total and
sub-factor (i.e., amnesia, depersonalization/derealization, and absorption) dissociative symptom levels. In
addition, Group I and Group II were compared with respect to the relationship between physical injury and
DES scores.
Results: The mean DES scores (i.e., total and sub-factors) of Group I were higher than those of Group II
(p B0.001), and Group II’s mean DES scores (i.e., total and sub-factors) were higher than those of Group III
(p B0.001). Similarly, the number of subjects with high total DES scores (i.e.,(cid:2)30) was highest in Group I,
followed by Group II and Group III. When we compared combat-exposed subjects with high total DES
scores, Group I had higher scores than Group II. In contrast, no relationship between the presence of bodily
injury and total DES scores could be demonstrated. In addition, our results demonstrated that high deper-
sonalization/derealization factor scores were correlated with bodily injury in PTSD patients. A similar
relationship was found between high absorption factor scores and bodily injury for Group II.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the level of dissociation was significantly higher in subjects with
combat-related PTSD than in subjects without combat-related PTSD. In addition, combat-exposed subjects
without PTSD also had higher dissociation levels than healthy subjects without combat experience.

Dissociation is the process through which indi-

viduals experience a disruption or discontinuity
in one or several aspects of their psychological
functioning. The functions that are affected by dissocia-
tion typically include memory, perception, consciousness,
identity, and motor control (Candel & Merckelbach, 2004).
Dissociation symptoms are believed to play a significant
role in the pathogenesis and continuation of posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and similar conditions (Wolf et al.,
2012). The relationship between PTSD and dissociation

is a clinically important subject; however, there is currently
no consensus regarding the nature of this relationship.

Researchers have proposed different explanations con-
cerning the relationship between PTSD and dissociation.
Waelde, Silvern, and Fairbank (2005) performed a taxome-
tric analysis of the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES)
scores of Vietnam War veterans who had been exposed
to trauma and determined that 32% of the veterans with
PTSD also had discrete dissociation. Putnam, Carlson,
Ross, and Anderson (1996) indicated that the mean DES

scores of PTSD patients were a function of a subset of
participants with very high dissociation levels rather than
a representation of a continuous dispersion of similar
symptoms within the group. Similarly, based on an evalua-
tion of existing neurobiological and psychometric studies,
Lanius et al. (2010) identified evidence for a dissociative
subtype of PTSD. The alternative to the dissociative sub-
type hypothesis is that dissociation represents a primary
facet of PTSD that has an equal distribution among
patients with PTSD and that dissociation is a general
marker for the severity of the condition (Van der Kolk,
Pelcovitz, Roth, & Mandel, 1996). This distinction has
various implications for the revision of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-5) criteria for PTSD. The DSM-5 includes a disso-
ciative subtype for PTSD, which is described as being
characterized by prominent depersonalization (i.e., de-
tachment or feelings of unreality regarding one’s self) and
derealization (i.e., detachment or feelings of unreality re-
garding one’s environment) (DSM-5; American Psychia-
tric Association, 2013; Blevins, Weathers, & Witte, 2014).
This revision reflects a long history of clinical observa-
tions and studies that identified a relationship between
trauma and dissociation. This revision also takes into
account neurobiological studies that demonstrated that
higher levels of differential response patterns occur among
PTSD patients who have predominantly re-experiences in
comparison to patients who have a dissociative response
to trauma (Carlson, Dalenberg, & McDade-Montez, 2010;
Lanius, Brand, Vermetten, Frewen, & Spiegel, 2012).

The main goal of the current study was to evaluate
the existing data and information regarding dissociative
symptoms among patients with combat-related PTSD.
Some previous studies demonstrated that high levels of
dissociative symptoms occur among veterans with combat-
related PTSD (Elhai, Frueh, Davis, Jacobs, & Hamner,
2003; Hyer, Albrecht, Boudewyns, Woods, & Brandsma,
1993; Loewenstein & Putnam, 1988; Marmar et al., 1994;
Stutman & Bliss, 1985; Spiegel, Hunt, & Dondershine,
1988). Many of these studies focused on determining
why some military veterans who are exposed to combat-
related trauma develop dissociative symptoms while
others who experience similar trauma do not exhibit
such symptoms. In addition, widespread evidence indi-
cates that PTSD patients experience considerably higher
levels of dissociative experiences than individuals with-
out PTSD (Bremner & Brett, 1997; Bremner, Steinberg,
Southwick, Johnson, & Charney, 1993; Bremner et al.,
1992; Keane, Kaufman, & Kimble, 2001). Thus, these
studies indicate that dissociation may be a significant
factor that influences the relationship between PTSD
development and PTSD symptoms (Suliman, Troeman,
Stein, & Seedat, 2013). The importance of the relation-
ship between trauma and dissociation was highlighted

again by the identification of a dissociative type of PTSD
in the DSM-5.

Our study is important because it includes healthy
individuals with no history of combat-related trauma as a
comparison group when assessing the level of dissocia-
tion among soldiers with and without PTSD who were
exposed to war-related trauma. Furthermore, this study
aimed to demonstrate that high dissociation levels are
associated with an increased risk of developing combat-
related PTSD. Previous studies that investigated the rela-
tionship between PTSD symptoms and physical injuries
found that high-level dissociation is positively correlated
with physical injury (Koren, Norman, Cohen, Berman,
& Klein, 2005; Kulka et al., 1990; Pitman, Altman, &
Macklin, 1989). The current study also evaluated the rela-
tionship between physical injury and the level of disso-
ciation. However, our findings showed that the increase
in some dissociative symptoms (i.e., depersonalization(cid:2)
derealization) in patients with physical injury was specific
to combat-related PTSD patients; this finding is signifi-
cant and distinguishes our study from previous studies.

Method

Participants
Male subjects aged between 20 and 40 who were currently
serving in the Turkish Armed Forces as professional
soldiers (i.e., officers, sergeants and other mercenaries)
and had a long history of compulsory service (i.e., be-
tween 10 and 15 years) were included in the study. Group
I consisted of 84 subjects who had experienced combat
and were diagnosed with PTSD, while Group II consisted
of 50 subjects who had experienced combat but were not
diagnosed with PTSD. The combat experiences of the par-
ticipants resulted in traumatic events during battle with
terrorist organizations. Group III included 50 healthy
subjects with no combat experience. The subjects were
evaluated by two psychiatrists, who diagnosed the sub-
jects in Group I with PTSD according to the DSM-IV.
In addition, the subjects in this group were required to
have had no Axis I disorder diagnosed during the
6 months preceding the study. Sixteen participants who
had a comorbid Axis I disorder in the past 6 months were
excluded from study. A single psychiatrist performed the
evaluations for the subjects in Group II and Group III.
Based on this evaluation, subjects with a DSM-IV Axis I
disorder, a central nervous system disease, a metabolic
disorder, mental retardation, or substance dependence
were not included in the study. None of the subjects had
used alcohol, any illicit substance, or medication dur-
ing the 4 weeks preceding the study. All subjects were
thoroughly informed about the study procedures. Appro-
val for the study protocol was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of the Gu¨ lhane Military Medical Faculty.

Assessments
Demographic information (e.g., age, education level, and
marital status) and combat-experience-related character-
istics (e.g., type and duration of combat and physical
injuries) were recorded during the psychiatric interview.
These data were verified by consulting the official docu-
ments and medical records of the Turkish Army. PTSD
was diagnosed using the Turkish version of the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
(SCID-I) Form (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 1997;
O¨ zku¨ rkc¸u¨ gil, Aydemir, Yıldız, Danacı, & Ko¨ rog˘lu, 1999).
Dissociation was evaluated using the Turkish version
of the DES, which is a 28-item self-report measure that
assesses the frequency of dissociative experiences, such as
amnesia, gaps in awareness, depersonalization, derealiza-
tion, absorption, and imaginative involvement (Bernstein
& Putnam, 1986; Yargıc¸, Tutkun, & Sar, 1995). The total
DES scores and the three main factor scores (i.e., amne-
sia, depersonalization and derealization, and absorption)
were calculated by averaging the scores for all or related
items. A DES score greater than 30 is considered to
be the threshold point for dissociative disorders in the
Turkish population (Yargıc¸ et al., 1995).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software,
version 16. The variables were investigated using visual
(i.e., histograms and probability plots) and analytical
methods (i.e., Kolmogorov(cid:2)Smirnov/Shapiro(cid:2)Wilk tests)
to determine whether or not the variables were normally
distributed. Descriptive statistics were expressed as the
mean9standard deviation and the percentage. Group
comparisons were performed using the Chi-square test
and ANOVA, where applicable. The Tukey test was used
to perform post-hoc evaluations. As parametric condi-
tions were not normally distributed, the Kruskall(cid:2)Wallis
test was performed to compare the DES scores of the
three groups. The Mann(cid:2)Whitney U test was performed
to test the significance of pairwise differences, using the
Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons.
The Friedmann test was used to determine the effect of

Table 1. Sociodemographic features of the subjects

the DES sub-scores on the total DES scores. The Wilcoxon
test was performed to test the significance of pairwise
differences, using the Bonferroni correction to adjust
for multiple comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was
employed to elucidate the determinant factors among
combat-exposed subjects with DES scores (cid:2)30. p-Values
(cid:2)0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
This study included 184 participating subjects (Group I:
84, Group II: 50, and Group III: 50). The three groups
were similar with respect to sociodemographic character-
istics (Table 1). The DES scores of the participants are
provided in Tables 2 and 3. The mean overall DES scores
(i.e., total and sub-factors) of Group I were comparatively
higher than those of Group II (pB0.001), while Group
II’s mean overall DES scores were higher than those of
Group III (pB0.001). Similarly, the number of subjects
with a total DES score (cid:2)30 differed significantly among
the groups, as follows: Group I (cid:2)Group II (cid:2)Group III
(pB0.001). In addition, subjects who had total DES scores
(cid:2)30 were compared with respect to overall DES scores
(Table 2). In Group I, the depersonalization/derealization
sub-factor scores were higher than the other two sub-
factor scores (i.e., amnesia and absorption) (pB0.001). A
significant difference between the absorption sub-factor
scores and the other sub-factors scores was observed
in Group II (pB0.001) (Table 3). Groups I and II were
similar with respect to bodily injury and other combat-
related characteristics (i.e., armed conflict, mine, or bomb
effects) (Table 4). The factors that affected the DES scores
are listed in Table 5. The presence of PTSD was identified
as the only factor that was significantly related to the
DES scores of the subjects. This factor was also associated
with the number of subjects with a DES score(cid:2)30. In
contrast, no relationship between the presence of bodily
injury and the total DES scores could be demonstrated.
Furthermore, our results demonstrated that high deper-
sonalization/derealization factor
scores were correla-
ted with bodily injury among PTSD patients. A similar

Discussion
In this study, the dissociative symptoms of both healthy
subjects and combat-exposed soldiers with and without
PTSD were evaluated. The study results revealed higher
levels of dissociation among combat-exposed subjects with
PTSD than among combat-exposed subjects without PTSD.
Combat-exposed subjects without PTSD also had higher
dissociation levels than healthy subjects without combat
experience.

The relationship between dissociation and traumatic
experiences has been investigated primarily among World
War II and Vietnam veterans (Banscomb, 1991; Bremner
et al., 1992; Elhai et al., 2003; Hyer et al., 1993). Bremner
et al. (1992) demonstrated previously that for combat-
exposed Vietnam War veterans, the levels of dissociation
are higher among those with PTSD than among those
without PTSD. Those authors also observed that higher
dissociation levels were related to the development of
PTSD. The results of our study were similar; however,
our study also included a control group and demon-
strated that combat-exposed soldiers without PTSD had

higher levels of dissociation than healthy subjects without
combat experience. Thus, combat exposure/experience alone
appears to lead to an increase in the level of dissociation.
Bremner et al. (1992) reported a mean DES score of 13.7
among soldiers without PTSD or any other psychiatric
disorder. The scores reported by Bremner et al. (1992)
were lower than the scores observed in our study. This
difference may be due to the samples, as our study groups
consisted of soldiers who had a long history of compul-
sory service. Thus, these soldiers may have experienced
more traumatic events during their long compulsory ser-
vice period. Furthermore, in the studies described above,
the DES was applied long after the soldiers had left the
traumatic environment (e.g., more than 30 years after
the Second World War or the Vietnam War). Therefore,
distance and separation in time might have affected the
DES scores. Another explanation involves differences
between the countries with respect to beliefs and socio-
cultural features (Tutkun et al., 1998). Yargıc¸ et al. (1995)
reported that dissociative findings were common among
the Turkish population.

Briere et al. demonstrated that persistent dissociation,
peritraumatic dissociation, peritraumatic distress, and
generalized dissociative symptoms are all associated with

PTSD. Similar to our study, the level of generalized dis-
sociative symptoms was measured using the DES in the
study performed by Briere et al. (Briere, Scott, & Weathers,
2005; Briere, Weathers, & Runtz, 2005). Van der Kolk et al.
(1996) previously determined that patients who met the
criteria for lifetime PTSD (but not current PTSD) had
dissociation levels that were significantly lower than those
of patients with current PTSD but significantly higher
than those of patients without PTSD. The results of our
study were similar to those of Bremner and Wolf, as they
also revealed that higher generalized dissociation levels
are associated with PTSD. The main feature that distin-
guishes our study from the study of Bremner and Wolf is
that we also included healthy soldiers who had experien-
ced no combat-related trauma. Many psychiatric patients
and normal subjects may report dissociative experiences.
In general, the mean DES scores of subjects with trauma-
tic lifestyles are higher than those of the general popula-
tion. Ross, Joshi, and Currie (1988) previously reported
a mean DES score of 10.8 for the general population. In
Turkey, this score has been reported to be 7.67 (Akyuz,

Dogan, Sar, Yargic, & Tutkun, 1999). Soldiers have higher
levels of dissociation than many other occupational
groups, primarily because soldiers are exposed to much
higher levels of stress and experience traumatic events
more frequently. Even soldiers who did not experience
traumatic events report higher DES scores than normal
subjects (Gulsum, O¨ zdemir, Celik, Uzun, & Ozsahin,
2009). In this study, we determined that DES scores
(13.3) were higher among healthy soldiers than among
the normal population. This observation is consistent
with the findings of previous studies (Ross et al., 1988).
Our study results also demonstrated that the levels of
dissociation of soldiers with PTSD who experienced trau-
matic events were higher than those of soldiers without
PTSD who experienced similar traumatic events. Thus,
the dissociation levels of PTSD patients were deter-
mined to be higher than those of individuals who did
not develop PTSD, despite exposure to combat-related
stressors. Our study results also demonstrated that the
levels of dissociation remained high among these soldiers.
Based on these observations, it is possible to conclude that
while low dissociation levels occur as part of a defense
mechanism against stressors, high dissociation levels in
response to stress play an important role in the develop-
ment of PTSD (Bowins, 2004; Briere, Scott, et al., 2005).
In the literature, the number of studies that evaluated
the relationship between dissociation and physical injury
during deployment is somewhat limited. Traditional views,
particularly psychoanalytic views, tended to regard bodily
injury as a protective factor against the development
of PTSD (Ulman & Brothers, 1987). At the core of this
assumption is the theory that physical injury absorbs much
of one’s ‘‘free-floating psychic energy,’’ thus reducing
the chance of developing anxious or conflicting feelings
about the traumatic event. In addition, unlike psycholo-
gical wounds, bodily injuries typically engender more
sympathy from the environment. However, over the past
two decades, numerous studies of injured trauma survivors

challenged this traditional understanding of the relation-
ship between PTSD and injury (Kulka et al., 1990; Pitman
et al., 1989). While dissociation is commonly viewed as a
factor that increases vulnerability because it impairs the
integration and reprocessing of the trauma, an interesting
alternative possibility is that the relationship between
bodily injury and dissociation might be reversed. Speci-
fically, people who tend to dissociate under stress might
be at higher risk of getting injured (Koren et al., 2005).
Various studies reported that the occurrence of phy-
injury during deployment is associated with an
sical
increased likelihood of developing PTSD (Hoge et al.,
2008; Kennedy et al., 2007). Hoge et al. (2008) conduc-
ted a study of soldiers returning from deployment and
demonstrated that while 9% of soldiers who did not
sustain any injuries subsequently developed PTSD, this
ratio increased nearly two-fold to 16% for those who were
injured during deployment. A similar ratio was observed
in a study that was conducted by Koren et al. (2005) and
evaluated the increase in PTSD incidence that occurs due
to combat-related injuries. That study included 60 injured
and 40 uninjured soldiers and reported PTSD frequency
values of 16.7 and 2.5%, respectively, for these two groups
of soldiers. In addition, Koren et al. also reported higher
levels of depression, anxiety, and dissociation among
injured soldiers. Thus, physical injuries can play a signi-
ficant role in the development of PTSD and other psy-
chological disorders. Another post-deployment study
identified a relationship between the number of injuries
sustained by soldiers and the incidence of PTSD. Further,
a previous study reported that the occurrence of one,
two, and three or more instances that resulted in injury
to soldiers were associated with PTSD incidence rates of
14, 29, and 51%, respectively (Schneiderman, Braver, &
Kang, 2008). These results are consistent with the PTSD
incidence rates observed among civilians who experienced
major orthopedic trauma (McCarthy et al., 2003; Starr
et al., 2004). Our study results indicated that there was no
relationship between physical injury and total DES scores
in PTSD and non-PTSD patients. In addition, our study

results revealed a relationship between physical injury and
depersonalization/derealization factor scores in Group I.
A similar relationship was found between high absorp-
tion factor scores and bodily injury for Group II. These
findings indicate that physical
injury (rather than the
total DES score)
is associated with an increase in
depersonalization/derealization levels in PTSD patients.
In addition, these findings indicate the existence of a
specific relationship between dissociation and physical
injury in the context of PTSD. Furthermore, these find-
ings may suggest an association between physical injury
and the dissociative type of PTSD that was described in
the DSM-5. The presence of a nearly significant differ-
ence between the total DES scores of patients with and
without injury in Group II may be due to the effects of
the absorption factor in this group. However, because we
did not assess the severity of the subjects’ physical injuries
before obtaining these findings and thus did not deter-
mine whether differences exist between the groups in
terms of physical injury severity, the results could have
been affected; this possibility is a limitation of the study
design.

Our study has several other limitations. First, the size
of our study population was relatively small. Second, the
study subjects were not evaluated with respect to trau-
matic brain injury (TBI). Although it was once assumed
that the loss of consciousness and the memory deficits
that are associated with TBI render the development of
PTSD unlikely, recent studies demonstrated that PTSD
could develop even among patients who have no conscious
memory of the traumatic event (Gil, Caspi, Ben-Ari, Koren,
& Klein, 2005; Harvey, Brewin, Jones, & Kopelman, 2003;
Klein, Caspi, & Gil, 2003; Warden et al., 1997). Studies
among military personnel suggested that conditions that
can potentially cause brain injury, such as TBI, are asso-
ciated with a high PTSD incidence (Kennedy et al., 2007).
A third limitation of our study was the lack of a group
that included patients who had PTSD in association
with traumatic events that were unrelated to combat.
Some evidence suggests that veterans with PTSD caused

by combat-related events experience more severe symptoms
than veterans with PTSD caused by events unrelated to
combat (Brinker, Westermeyer, Thuras, & Canive, 2007).
A fourth limitation of our study was the fact that the
subjects were not evaluated for possible childhood trauma
exposure, adversities, the length of combat exposure,
and peritraumatic dissociation. Previous studies have
indicated that psychiatric disorders, such as depression,
anxiety disorders, and dissociative, somatoform, and psy-
chotic disorders increase the level of dissociation. In addi-
tion, some neurological disorders (e.g., primarily epilepsy,
migraine headache, and spinal cord injury) and organic
disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, uremia, and malaria) in-
crease the level of dissociation (Putnam, 1985; Putnam
et al., 1996). Therefore, participants with comorbid dis-
orders were excluded from the study to clarify the effect
of combat trauma on the dissociation level. Thus, we
aimed to evaluate changes in dissociation levels in the
context of PTSD psychopathology. Simultaneously, we
also aimed to evaluate the effect of physical injury on
the dissociation level independently from other factors.
However, by excluding participants with comorbid dis-
orders, we might have studied with participants who have
lower dissociation levels than typical PTSD patients;
this possibility is the fifth and final limitation of the
current study.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our study results demonstrated that the
level of dissociation is higher among Turkish subjects
with combat-related PTSD than among subjects with-
out combat-related PTSD. In addition, combat-exposed
subjects without PTSD also had higher dissociation
levels than healthy subjects without combat experience.
Further, our results showed that high depersonalization/
derealization factor scores were correlated with bodily
injury among PTSD patients. Future studies should in-
vestigate the effectiveness of various approaches for the
treatment of high dissociation levels in larger samples of
PTSD patients, preferably without any other significant
psychiatric disorders. In addition,
it is important for
future studies to examine specific factors of dissociation
rather than treating dissociation as a single construct.
