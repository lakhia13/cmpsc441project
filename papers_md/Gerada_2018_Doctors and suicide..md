Doctors and suicide

On  Monday  28  April  1902,  Dr  Jeannie 
Charlotte MacLeod (Jeannie) buttoned her 
starched  white  coat,  checked  her  pockets 
for her stethoscope and notebook, took one 
last look at herself in the mirror, and walked 
onto the paediatric ward as the new House 
Officer  at  Aberdeen  Children’s  Hospital. 
She  glowed  with  pride  as  she  introduced 
herself to the Senior Ward Matron, able to 
use the title of Doctor for the first time. By 
the  end  of  that  week,  Jeannie  was  dead. 
At  the  age  of  28  and  alone  in  her  on-call 
room, she had cut her jugular vein and bled 
to death. She was found by the porter who 
had  been  sent  from  the  ward  to  find  her 
(personal  communication,  Dr  Bob  Clarke 
[great  nephew],  December  2017).  Four 
years  later  and  a  world  apart,  a  Russian 
doctor, Dr Veressayev, wrote about the high 
rate of suicide among his classmates, 10% 
of whom died by their own hand.1 Why these 
doctors  chose  to  kill  themselves  can  only 
be surmised. Jeannie did not write a suicide 
note, but we know from her letters to her 
family that she had a tough time during her 
medical school training. As the only woman 
in  her  year,  and  only  the  third  woman  to 
qualify as a doctor in Scotland, she had to be 
taught separately for much of her training, 
was  mocked  and  laughed  at  by  her  male 
colleagues,  and  we  can  only  imagine  how 
she  would  have  been  received  by  the  all-
female  nursing  staff.  Family  folklore  tells 
of Jeannie experiencing the death of a child 
during her first week on duty and the guilt 
being too much for her to bear. In his book, 
Dr  Veressayev  talks  only  in  generalities, 
touching  on  the  unrelenting  workload, 
pressure  of  the  patient  expectations, 
worries about complaints, and low pay. 

Today,  the  problem  of  suicide  among 

doctors is still a cause of concern. 

RISK FACTORS FOR DOCTORS
Throughout  time  and  across  the  world, 
doctors  have  always  had  higher  rates 
of  suicide  compared  with  the  general 
population  and  with  other  professional 
groups.  Female  doctors 
in  particular 
have  higher  rates  —  2.5–4.0  times  the 
rate  by  some  estimates.2  The  reasons 
for  suicide  among  doctors  —  as  in  the 
general  population  —  are  often  related  to 
un- (or under-) treated depression, bipolar 
disorder, or substance misuse.3

However, for doctors the risk factors go 
beyond mental illness.4 As a group, doctors

sacrifice their lives for their profession.”

occupy a privileged position in society. They 
bear witness to the suffering of patients who 
share secrets told to no one else, not even 
their  closest  relatives.  Doctors  are  often 
faced  with  the  futility  of  their  endeavours. 
Without  a  safe  outlet  to  talk  about  the 
emotional  impact  of  their  work,  doctors 
may carry the stress of their work beyond 
the  consulting  room,  putting  them  at  risk 
of depression, substance misuse, and even 
suicide.  Doctors  have  other  specific  risk 
factors, such as access to (and training in 
the use of) dangerous drugs, explaining why 
anaesthetists  have  higher  rates  of  suicide 
than paediatricians.5

The impact of complaints and referral to 
the regulator can also have a major impact 
on doctors’ mental health. In 2015, a newly 
qualified  GP  who  had  been  voted  ‘Trainee 
GP of the Year’, Dr James Halcrow, hanged 
himself. The inquest heard how he feared 
erasure  from  the  medical  register  for 
transgressing  the  conditions  set  down  by 
the General Medical Council (GMC), which 
were  reported  to  dictate  that  he  abstain 
from alcohol.6

On 24 November 2015, Dr Wendy Potts, 
a  GP  and  mother  of  two,  killed  herself.7 
Dr Potts suffered from bipolar disorder and 
kept a blog about her condition. Apparently, 
a patient had complained and Dr Potts was 
suspended and later referred to the GMC. 
The coroner told the inquest:

‘It  seems  to  me  the  suspension  and 
investigation  was  something  of  a 
sledgehammer being used to crack a nut.’8
The theme of losing sight of the person 

behind  the  professional  is  echoed  by 
Mahajan  and  Johnstone  when 
they 
describe how a doctor became ‘lost in the 
system,’ which, in their view, contributed to 
his suicide.9

COMPLAINTS AGAINST DOCTORS
Bourne  et al  conducted  a  large  study 
of  doctors  in  the  UK  and  discovered  the 
deleterious  impact  that  complaints  and/or 
referrals to the regulator have on doctors’ 
mental  state.10  Doctors  who  had  recently 
received  a  complaint  of  any  kind  were 
found to be 77% more likely to suffer from 
moderate to severe depression than those 
who had never had a complaint. They were 
also  found  to  have  increased  incidence 
of  suicidal  thoughts,  sleep  difficulties, 
relationship problems, and a host of physical 
health problems compared with people who 
had not been through a complaints process. 
Over a 9-year period, 21 doctors in the care 
of the NHS Practitioner Health Programme 
(PHP; http://php.nhs.uk/) have died. Among 
living PHP patients, the GMC is involved in 
around 10% of cases, compared with 52% 
(11  out  of  21)  of  patients  who  have  died 
and  56%  (9  out  of  16)  of  the  patients  who 
died from accidents, suicide, or overdoses. 
Between  2005  and  2013,  28  doctors  died 
through suicide or suspected suicide while 
undergoing  GMC  investigation.11  Although 
correlation does not mean causation, being 
under regulatory or disciplinary processes 
nevertheless  increases  the  risk  of  mental 
illness among doctors and a complaint or 
referral to the GMC must be considered a 
red-flag risk factor for both depression and 

“If they [doctors] are to give their all to patients and 
make patients their first concern, then the quid pro quo 
is that the system (the NHS) cares for them and does 
everything morally, ethically, and practically that it can to 
remove or, at the very least, reduce the causes of their 
distress.”

that  even  ‘only’  a  12-month  suspension 
might  result  in  the  doctor  never  being 
able to work again. The ‘multiple jeopardy’, 
where  a  doctor  could  spend  many  years 
defending  themselves  at  different  parts  of 
the medical, legal, and regulatory systems, 
must also be addressed. 

The  days  of  the  doctor  being  the 
superhuman, 
sacrificing 
all-giving, 
individual  are  over.  It  is  now  time  to  have 
a more realistic contract with our patients 
and  with  the  health  systems  in  which  we 
work, a contract where the doctor is cared 
for and can expect the same compassion as 
the patients they treat. 

Don’t suffer in silence; seek help. If you or 
someone you know might need help with a 
mental health concern, including stress or 
depression, or an addiction problem, help is 
available (see Box 1).

suicide. The GMC has since implemented a 
series of changes in their processes to limit 
and  hopefully  reduce  the  mental  health 
impact of a referral to them. 

DOCTORS ARE HUMAN TOO
Though  thankfully  a  rare  event,  the 
repercussions 
following  suicide  are 
immense. Far from being a one-off tragedy 
in itself, suicide can cause guilt, shame, and 
higher  rates  of  suicide  in  loved  ones  left 
behind, as well as the potential of contagion. 
Jeannie,  James,  Wendy,  and  all  the  other 
doctors  who  have  killed  themselves  teach 
us  a  salutary  lesson,  mentioned  by  the 
coroner  presiding  at  Dr Pott’s  inquest. 
Doctors  are  human.  Doctors  should 
not  have  to  sacrifice  their  lives  for  their 
profession.  If  they  are  to  give  their  all  to 
patients  and  make  patients  their  first 
concern, then the quid pro quo is that the 
system (the NHS) cares for them and does 
everything morally, ethically, and practically 
that it can to remove or, at the very least, 
reduce  the  causes  of  their  distress.  This 
means addressing the regulatory process, 
in  particular  the  delays  in  the  system,  the 
disproportionate  sanctions  which  mean
