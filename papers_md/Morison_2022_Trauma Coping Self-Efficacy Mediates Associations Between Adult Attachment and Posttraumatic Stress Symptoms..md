Attachment orientations reﬂect individuals’ expectations for interpersonal relationships
and inﬂuence emotion regulation strategies and coping. Previous research has
documented that anxious and avoidant attachment orientations have deleterious effects
on the trauma recovery process leaving these survivors vulnerable to posttraumatic
stress disorder
(PTSD) symptoms. However, avoidant attachment may be more
complicated. Prior work has also found those high in avoidant attachment but also low
in anxious attachment (i.e., dismissing) may not experience such vulnerabilities. Further,
avoidant attachment individuals often report higher self-efﬁcacy than their anxiously
attached counterparts. The present study examined trauma coping self-efﬁcacy (CSE-T)
as a previously unexamined mechanism of action between adult attachment and PTSD
symptoms. Structural equation modeling results showed that anxious attachment was
associated with lower CSE-T and greater PTSD symptoms six weeks later. Further, a
signiﬁcant indirect effect of anxious attachment on PTSD symptoms through CSE-T was
found. Contrary to hypotheses, avoidant attachment also exhibited an indirect effect
on PTSD symptoms through CSE-T, such that avoidant attachment was associated
with lower CSE-T, which in turn, was associated with greater PTSD symptoms. Also
contrary to hypotheses, the interaction between anxious and avoidant attachment was
not signiﬁcantly associated with either CSE-T or PTSD symptoms. Results suggest that
both anxious and avoidant attachment orientations contribute to poor self-regulation
following trauma, as they undermine perceptions of trauma coping self-efﬁcacy.

INTRODUCTION

Early caregiving relationships inﬂuence how individuals self-regulate in the face of potential threats
and remain inﬂuential into adulthood (Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016). Given the relationship
between attachment orientations and the regulation of distress, researchers have examined the
association between adult attachment and trauma adaptation. Researchers have suggested that
the perceived (and often objective) threat faced by trauma survivors elicits the retrieval of pre-
existing attachment representations that diﬀer depending on previous experiences one has with
close relationships (Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016). The current literature does not provide a clear
understanding of how attachment styles inﬂuence both initial reactions to trauma as well as

posttraumatic adaptation over time. In this paper we argue that
perceptions of coping self-eﬃcacy (CSE) in dealing with the
initial trauma and the recovery process is a key mechanism
by which posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
alleviate or worsen during recovery (Benight and Bandura, 2004).
However, diﬀerent levels of CSE perceptions across attachment
orientations and the potential mediating role of CSE have yet to
be examined. The present study attempts to ﬁll this void.

family)

Adult attachment theory provides a critical framework for
interpersonal relationships with
understanding the role of
various attachment ﬁgures
in the
(e.g., partners,
formation of working models of one’s self and others that
inﬂuences subsequent proximity-seeking behaviors (Bowlby,
1982). A dominant model of adult attachment describes
attachment orientations along two continuous attachment
dimensions – anxious and avoidant attachment (Brennan et al.,
1998; Fraley et al., 2015). Securely attached adults, who are
low on both anxious and avoidant attachment, can maintain
autonomy while also utilizing relational support when needed
(Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016). Those who are anxiously attached
are overwhelmed with concerns about being supported when in
need, whereas avoidantly attached adults tend to distrust others
and maintain distance in close relationships (Mikulincer et al.,
2006). Anxious and avoidant attachment styles are often referred
to as insecure attachment.

Bartholomew and Horowitz (1991) suggested a four-factor
model of adult attachment that allows an additive combination
of scores along the two insecure attachment orientations. Those
high in anxious attachment but low in avoidant attachment
are described as preoccupied, whereas those high in avoidant
attachment and low in anxious attachment are called dismissing.
An individual scoring highly on both anxious and avoidant
dimensions are characterized as fearful. Consistent with the two-
dimensional model of attachment (e.g., Brennan et al., 1998),
individuals low in both anxious and avoidant attachment are
securely attached. These attachment orientations manifest unique
cognitive representations of relationships as well as behaviors
related to support interactions.

Anxiously attached adults generally see the world as unsafe,
supports as unreliable, and themselves as unable to cope with
potential
threats or unworthy of support (Mikulincer and
Shaver, 2016). These individuals may utilize hyperactivating
relational strategies (e.g., overdependence on close relationships,
clinging or attempts to control behaviors of
loved ones)
(Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016).

Avoidantly attached individuals, in contrast, tend to distrust
others and do not perceive seeking support as a viable option
for managing distress. Driven by a desire to control or maximize
distance from close relationship partners, avoidantly attached
individuals attempt to evade intimacy or self-disclosure (i.e.,
referred to as deactivating strategies). Fraley and Shaver (1997)
suggested that those who exhibit a prototypically dismissing
(high avoidant, low anxious) attachment orientation are skilled at
suppressing attachment-related distressing thoughts, as exhibited
by decreases in physiological arousal following instructions to
suppress the thought of abandonment by a partner. Overall, it
is unclear as to whether the deactivating strategies employed

by avoidantly attached individuals are eﬀective methods for
coping with stress.

studies have

similarly demonstrated the
inﬂuence of attachment orientations on PTSD symptoms.
Within the types of insecure attachment, longitudinal results
on the association between insecure attachment styles and
PTSD symptoms were largely consistent, such that anxious
and avoidant attachment were positively associated with PTSD
symptoms (Fraley et al., 2006; Solomon et al., 2008; Franz
et al., 2014; Shallcross et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2016; see also
Besser and Neria, 2010). However, among the two longitudinal
studies to examine the interaction between anxious and avoidant
attachment (Fraley and Bonanno, 2004; Fraley et al., 2006),
ﬁndings
regarding the relationship between a dismissing
attachment orientation (high avoidant, low anxious) and PTSD
symptoms have been mixed. More research on this interaction
between avoidant and anxious attachment orientations and its
inﬂuence on PTSD symptoms, as well as potential mechanisms
of action, is needed.

Longitudinal

An important potential mechanism of action are individuals’
perceptions of their capabilities in the face of external and
internal threat. The perceived ability to cope (i.e., perceived CSE)
in the face of environmental demands is a crucial determinant of
recovery (Benight and Bandura, 2004).

Indeed,

the predictive utility of CSE was demonstrated
by two meta-analytic reviews
(Luszczynska et al., 2009;
Gallagher et al., 2020). Luszczynska et al. (2009) found that,
among longitudinal studies, CSE predicted PTSD symptoms
and general distress (distress, depression, and anxiety) up
to 8 months post-event with medium to large eﬀect sizes
(general distress r = −0.50, PTSD r = −0.62). The eﬀect
sizes were also signiﬁcant but more varied in cross-sectional
studies. Greater CSE predicted lower PTSD symptom severity
(r = −0.36), frequency (r = −0.77), and lower general distress
(r = −0.50). More recently, Gallagher et al. (2020) similarly
found a medium to large eﬀect of CSE on PTSD symptom
(weighted r = −0.49) and
severity among cross-sectional
longitudinal (weighted r = −0.52) studies. Collectively, CSE
demonstrates a relatively stronger eﬀect compared to other
psychosocial predictors of PTSD, such as perceived social support

Trauma Coping Self-Efﬁcacy Mediates Associations

(r = −0.28; Ozer et al., 2003) and emotion dysregulation (r = 0.53;
Seligowski et al., 2015).

As outlined in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT; Bandura, 1997),
the belief that one can exercise control over the challenges
of trauma recovery will inﬂuence how one perceives potential
threats, the choices they make, and how resilient they are to
stressors (Benight and Bandura, 2004). Those with higher CSE
are more likely to utilize adaptive coping strategies and maintain
an active role in shaping their environment to facilitate recovery.
Conversely, lower CSE leads to being more sensitive to possible
environmental threats, and in turn, fears about managing these
threats. The ultimate eﬀect of lower CSE is impaired functioning
and greater PTSD symptom severity.

Previous research on attachment has alluded to potential
relationships between attachment orientations
and CSE.
For example, Mikulincer and Florian (1995) found anxious
attachment to be associated with poor self-eﬃcacy perceptions
regarding the ability to cope with military training. Sheinbaum
et al. (2015) also reported that anxiously attached individuals
reported more negative appraisals about themselves and their
capacity to cope with daily living. Experimental research also
has demonstrated that anxiously attached adults hold less
positive self-appraisals when under distress (Mikulincer, 1998;
Vrticvka et al., 2012). When managing environmental challenges,
anxiously attached adults appear to evaluate themselves as less
capable and, in turn, have diﬃculties self-regulating distress
(Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016). Through the self-regulatory
process involved with managing posttraumatic demands,
it
is reasonable to suggest that anxiously attached individuals
would have lower CSE as they struggle with relational support
(Benight and Bandura, 2004).

Avoidantly attached individuals may have a very diﬀerent
relationship with CSE. Mikulincer and colleagues proposed
that avoidantly attached people may possess greater self-eﬃcacy
regarding their ability to maintain distance through coping
mastery they have achieved without depending upon others
(Mikulincer and Florian, 1998; Mikulincer et al., 1999). If one
has internal working models of others as typically unavailable
and unhelpful when one is distressed, self-reliance may provide
one with more positive appraisals regarding the ability to
cope on one’s own (“I don’t need anyone!”). Interestingly,
avoidantly attached adults have demonstrated positive self-
appraisals (Mikulincer and Florian, 1995; Mikulincer, 1998),
but also negative self-appraisals (Sheinbaum et al., 2015). One
possible answer to these disparate ﬁndings may be the level of
anxious attachment that coexists with avoidant style (e.g., Fraley
and Shaver, 1997).

in the

relationship have been identiﬁed, such as perceived social
support
(Besser and Neria, 2010, 2012), coping strategies
(Mikulincer et al., 1993) and emotion regulation (Benoit et al.,
2010), one could argue that CSE plays a key role in explaining
how these constructs exert an inﬂuence on individuals’ responses
to stress. Perceived social support boosts CSE perceptions
(enabling hypothesis), thus reducing distress (Schwarzer and
Knoll, 2007; Smith et al., 2013, 2017). However, the inﬂuence
of attachment orientations on CSE perceptions and PTSD

symptoms in trauma survivors has yet to be examined. This
study attempts to ﬁll this void.

Thus, we hypothesized that

trauma-related CSE (CSE-
T) perceptions (measured at follow-up) would mediate the
relationship between baseline anxious attachment and PTSD
symptoms six weeks later (see Figure 1). For anxiously attached
adults who experience negative self-evaluations (Mikulincer et al.,
2006), persistent symptoms would result in greater decreases
in CSE-T over time, given that the attempts at coping thus
far have not alleviated symptoms. Low CSE-T would, in turn,
serve to worsen PTSD symptoms (Benight and Bandura, 2004;
Luszczynska et al., 2009; Bosmans and van der Velden, 2017).
For avoidant attachment, we hypothesized that there would be
a signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect on PTSD symptoms through CSE-T,
such that avoidantly attached adults would experience a greater
sense of CSE-T, which in turn would lessen PTSD symptoms.
To examine potential relationships between with CSE-T and
PTSD for those high in avoidant attachment and low in anxious
attachment (e.g., dismissive attachment), an interaction term
was used. A fearful attachment (high anxious, high avoidant),
characterized by both a fear of rejection and avoidance of others
(Bartholomew and Horowitz, 1991), would lack the beneﬁts of
a boosted self-eﬃcacy when faced with distress, thus leading
to the observed relationship between avoidant attachment and
PTSD elsewhere (Fraley et al., 2006; Solomon et al., 2008; Franz
et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2016). Thus, we hypothesized that
survivors whose attachment orientation were more prototypically
dismissing would experience greater CSE-T and less PTSD
symptoms, whereas those more fearful would experience low
CSE-T and high PTSD symptoms. Given the importance of
timing in the measurement of PTSD symptoms (e.g., Galatzer-
Levy et al., 2018), time since the traumatic event was controlled
for by recruiting individuals who had experienced a traumatic
event in the last year and incorporating the time since trauma
as a covariate in the present analyses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants
The inclusion criteria for the present study consisted of (a) having
experienced at least one traumatic event based on the DSM-
5 (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) deﬁnition in
the last year, (b) being at least 18 years old, and (c) ﬂuency in
English. Participants (NT1 = 380, NT2 = 227) were primarily
female (67.3%), White (72.5%), and married (38%; see Table 1).
The present sample was well-educated, with the majority holding
a college degree. Trauma exposure as measured by the Life
Events Checklist (LEC; Weathers et al., 2013) revealed the most
common traumatic events (either experienced, witnessed, learned
of, or as part of job) were transportation accidents (70.7%),
followed by life-threatening illness or injury (62.8%), other (62%),
natural disasters (59.2%), physical assaults (57.3%), unwanted
sexual experiences (55.8%). The least common traumatic events
were causing harm or death to someone else (15.4%) and
captivity (13.9%). A small percentage of participants reported
receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis at any time during the pandemic

(NT1 = 15, NT2 = 9). Six individuals reported receiving a COVID-
19 diagnosis at T2 that was not reported at T1, which may indicate
they became ill during the study. Time since the most currently
distressing traumatic event ranged from 0 to 365 days, with the
average amount of time passed being 197.73 days (SD = 107.48).
Three participants (two healthcare workers, one exposed to
domestic violence) were experiencing ongoing trauma exposure
and were thus coded as “0” for the number of days since the
traumatic event.

Procedure
Community participants were recruited through Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk (MTurk), with data
collection taking
place between June and November 2020 (Morison, 2021).
A longitudinal correlational design was utilized to test study
hypotheses including a baseline survey and a six-week follow-
up assessment. The surveys were created through the Cloud
Research website, which oﬀers a user-friendly interface for
creating longitudinal Mturk surveys (Litman et al., 2017). Based
on sample size recommendations by Weston and Gore (2006),
we aimed to collect a minimum of 200 participants. In order to
reach this minimum sample size, a substantially larger number of
potential participants were screened for inclusion (see Figure 2).
Participants were compensated for each survey, providing $0.02
for the screening survey, $1.00 for the baseline survey, and $2.00
for the follow-up survey.

Prior to informed consent and inclusion in the study, potential
participants completed a brief screener survey with four yes
or no questions to assess eligibility criteria. Those who self-
identiﬁed as having met the inclusion criteria were invited to
complete the baseline survey. Eligible participants completed
self-report surveys on attachment, CSE, and PTSD symptoms at
both baseline (T1) and a follow-up survey six weeks later (T2).
As outlined in Figure 2, about one third of individuals who
completed the baseline survey did not meet the trauma criteria or
did not experience a traumatic event in the timeframe speciﬁed.
The DSM-5 deﬁnition of a traumatic event speciﬁes that the event
must involve exposure to “. . .actual or threatened death, serious
injury, or sexual violence, in one (or more) of the following ways:
(1) Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s), (2) Witnessing,

in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others, (3) Learning
that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member
or close friend. In the case of actual or threatened death, the
event(s) must have been violent or accidental, (4) Experiencing
repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic
event(s)” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013, p 271).
Of the 471 potential participants who did not meet inclusion
criteria, 341 of these reported an event that was inconsistent with
the DSM-5 deﬁnition of a traumatic event. These participants
were not invited to complete the follow-up survey and were not
included in analyses.

As careless responding and automated bots are of concern
in Mturk studies, several checks were utilized to ensure the
quality of the data collected. Duplicate IP addresses were blocked
from completing any survey on multiple occasions through the
Cloud Research service (Litman et al., 2017). However, three
duplicates with matching Mturk user IDs were identiﬁed in
the data cleaning process and responses were discarded. Open-
ended questions regarding trauma exposure were included to
(1) assess the most distressing traumatic event meets DSM-5
criteria and falls within the last year, and (2) provide conﬁrmation
that the survey was being completed by a person and not a
bot. One common example of a rejected response to the open-
ended trauma exposure question was providing a copy-pasted
deﬁnition of PTSD. Blank responses to open-ended questions
were not included in the present analyses as inclusion criteria
could not be veriﬁed.

Measures
Demographics
Participants reported on various demographic information,
including age, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education,
and annual household income. Participants were also asked to
indicate whether they had received a diagnosis of COVID-19
due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the potential
contribution to missing data.

Trauma Exposure
Exposure to a traumatic event in the last year was assessed using
the extended version of the LEC (Weathers et al., 2013). The LEC

lists 17 diﬀerent traumatic events, from which participants are
asked to indicate if they had experienced it themselves, witnessed
the event, heard about the event occurring to a close friend or
family member, was experienced through the course of a job (e.g.,
ﬁrst responder), or was not experienced. The LEC has exhibited
acceptable temporal stability and convergent validity with other
established measures of trauma history, such as the Traumatic
Life Events Questionnaire (Gray et al., 2004). The extended LEC
also included open-ended questions regarding the worst event in
the last year and how much time had elapsed since the traumatic
event. These open-ended questions were carefully reviewed by
the ﬁrst author to ensure the event met DSM-5 criteria and
the event fell within the last year. Corresponding to the DSM-
5 deﬁnition of a traumatic event, participants who indicate any
degree of trauma exposure were considered eligible to participate.
Participants who described an event not meeting criteria, such
as job loss or death of a loved one by natural causes, were not
included in the present analyses.

Adult Attachment
Anxious and avoidant attachment was assessed using the
Experiences in Close Relationships – Relationship Structures
scale (ECR-RS; Fraley et al., 2011a). Participants were instructed
to respond to the same nine statements regarding how they feel
toward diﬀerent attachment ﬁgures, including attachment with
his or her romantic partner, close friend, mother ﬁgure, and
father ﬁgure. For each attachment ﬁgure, the Anxious attachment
subscale items emphasize concerns over abandonment (e.g., “I
need a lot of reassurance that close relationship partners really
care about me”), while the Avoidant attachment subscale items
emphasize a desire to distance from close others (e.g., “I prefer
not to be too close to others”). Items are rated from 1 (Disagree
strongly) to 7 (Agree strongly) and summed on each subscale
to create total scores for Anxious and Avoidant attachment.
Mean composites, using averaged anxious or avoidant scores for
each attachment ﬁgure, have exhibited good reliability (Anxious
α = 0.80, Avoidant α = 0.88; Fraley et al., 2011a). Previous
work by Fraley et al. (2011b) demonstrated that attachment
orientation to each attachment ﬁgure (e.g., partner,
friend,
mother, and father) may be used as indicators for an overall
latent construct representing one’s “global” or “prototypical”
attachment orientation. This approach to estimating global
attachment may result
in less ambiguity as to whom the
participant should be bearing in mind when responding to the
self-report statements. Global scores for attachment anxiety and
attachment avoidance in the present sample demonstrated good
internal consistency (α = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively).

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms
The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013)
was used to measure PTSD symptoms. Items on the PCL-
5 correspond to PTSD symptom criteria from the DSM-5,
including intrusive symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in
cognition or mood, and arousal symptoms (American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 2013). Participants were instructed to
respond to the 20-item questionnaire regarding how bothered
he or she was by symptoms in the past month concerning his
or her experience in the past year (Weathers et al., 2013). Item
responses range from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely). Items were
summed to create a total PTSD symptom severity score. The
PCL-5 has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.95) and
test-retest reliability (r = 0.82) over one week (Belvins et al., 2015).
The PCL-5 total score demonstrates good internal consistency
in the present sample, α = 0.96. Average T2 PTSD symptom
severity exceeded the cut-oﬀ value of 33.0 suggesting probable
PTSD diagnosis recommended by the National Center for PTSD
(M = 47.93, SD = 19.74), suggesting that the present sample was
highly distressed.

Trauma Coping Self-Efﬁcacy
Trauma survivors’ CSE was measured using the Trauma Coping
Self-Eﬃcacy (CSE-T) self-report scale (Benight et al., 2015).
The CSE-T is a 9-item, context-speciﬁc measure of survivors’
perceptions of his or her coping capabilities surrounding trauma
symptoms (e.g., “Control thoughts of the traumatic experience
happening again”) and other posttraumatic demands (e.g., “Get

my life back to normal”). Participants were instructed to indicate
the extent to which they feel capable of coping with these
various posttraumatic demands. Items are rated on a 7-point
scale ranging from 1 (not at all capable) to 7 (totally capable).
The CSE-T has demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.87
to.91), discriminant validity, and test-retest reliability (r = 0.57

good internal consistency, α = 0.92.

Data Analysis
Adult attachment variables were created by averaging avoidant
and anxious scores across the diﬀerent relational contexts
(i.e., friend, mother, father, and partner; Fraley et al., 2011a).
Additionally, an interaction term was formed using the product
of mean-centered global avoidant attachment and global anxious
attachment (Aiken and West, 1991). Latent variables were formed
for CSE and PTSD symptoms, allowing for the removal of
measurement error (Crano et al., 2015). Further, parceling was
utilized to form latent variables, thereby minimizing the number
of paths to be estimated in the measurement model in favor of
parsimony (Matsunaga, 2008). To employ parceling for PTSD,
symptom cluster mean composites were used as indicators for
the PTSD symptom latent variable. Finally, the nine-item CSE-
T was randomly parceled to form three mean composites with
three items each. Details outlining the parcel items, internal
consistency, means, and standard deviations of observed model
variables are included in Table 2.

Model Estimation and Fit
A partially latent structural equation model (SEM) was estimated
using Mplus software version 8.5 (Los Angeles, CA; Muthén and
Muthén, 2017). A two-step process was utilized for estimating
the proposed model (e.g., Mueller and Hancock, 2007). Prior
to estimating the proposed structural model, the measurement
portion of the model was estimated in order to address any
model misspeciﬁcation concerns. Several indices of model ﬁt
were used to determine how well the model structure ﬁt the

underlying data. The model χ2 was examined, which assesses
the discrepancy between the hypothesized model and underlying
covariate structure of the data. Model χ2 uses signiﬁcance testing,
wherein a signiﬁcant χ2 indicates the model is signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the underlying data. However, as a p-value test,
model χ2 is sensitive to sample size (Kline, 2016). Thus, the
adjusted model χ2/df was also examined, using a cutoﬀ value
of less than 3.00 (Kline, 1998). As indicators of goodness-of-ﬁt,
the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; Bentler, 1990) and Tucker-Lewis
Index (TLI; Tucker and Lewis, 1973) were also examined. These
indices compare the proposed model to the independence model
(i.e., model with no estimated parameters). Values of CFI and
TLI over 0.95 represent a good ﬁtting model (Hu and Bentler,
1999). The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA;
MacCallum et al., 1996) and Standardized Root Mean Square
Residual (SRMR; Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1981) were used as
“badness-of-ﬁt” indices, which compare the proposed model to a
saturated model (i.e., all possible parameters estimated). RMSEA
and the accompanying 90% conﬁdence interval utilize a cutoﬀ
of less than 0.08 to identify a good ﬁt, and between 0.08 and
0.10 indicate a mediocre ﬁt (MacCallum et al., 1996). Similarly,
SRMR uses a cutoﬀ of 0.08 to indicate a good ﬁtting model
(Hu and Bentler, 1999).

RESULTS

Preliminary Analyses
Missing Data and Attrition
Item-level missing data and missing data due to dropout from
the study (i.e., attrition) were examined to establish the degree
of missingness and potential mechanisms of missingness. There
was no item-level missing data for T1 or T2 on any model
variables. However, there was 40% attrition. To identify the
proper procedure for handling this degree of missing data due
to attrition, we ﬁrst sought to identify if the data was Missing
Completely At Random (MCAR), Missing At Random (MAR), or
Not Missing At Random (NMAR; Rubin, 1976; Little and Rubin,
2002). There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between completers
and dropouts on gender, ethnicity, annual household income,
T1 COVID-19 diagnosis, time since trauma, T1 attachment
anxiety global score, T1 attachment avoidance global score, T1
CSE-T total score, or T1 PTSD symptom total score. However,
those who completed both T1 and T2 were signiﬁcantly older
(M = 34.62, SD = 10.36) than those who dropped out (M = 31.20,
SD = 11.36), t(380) = −2.98, p < 0.01, Cohen’s d = −0.31.
Given this signiﬁcant group diﬀerence, a MCAR mechanism of
missing data was not supported. Although there is no test to
diﬀerentiate between MAR and NMAR, age was included as an
auxiliary variable in the SEM in order to satisfy the assumptions
of MAR (Enders, 2010). Auxiliary variables, including variables
that are correlates of missingness, are often utilized to enhance
the missing data procedure by reducing bias (Collins et al., 2001).
Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used to
estimate missing data using Mplus version 8.5 (Muthén and
Muthén, 2017). This method does not impute missing data
points, instead it estimates model parameters and standard errors

using all observed variables (Enders, 2001). Maximum likelihood
(ML) methods demonstrate less biased performance as compared
to listwise or pairwise deletion for MCAR or MAR data (Enders,
2001, 2010; Schafer and Graham, 2002), even under conditions
of high rates of missing data (Enders, 2010, p. 95; Schafer and
Graham, 2002). Further, FIML has been found to produce less
biased parameter estimates and ﬁt indices in SEM (Feng et al.,
2012). Importantly, the inclusion of auxiliary variables (e.g., age)
within a FIML estimation procedure make the MAR assumption
more likely, thus yielding less biased estimates.

Normality and Outliers
Normality of observed variables was examined in SPSS 27.
Skewness values for anxious attachment, avoidant attachment,
CSE-T parcels, and PCL-5 parcels indicate these variables
were relatively normally distributed, falling between −0.74 and
0.78. Kurtosis values fell between −1.01 and 0.22, providing
another indication of relative normality. Mahalanobis distances
was used to identify multivariate outliers. Two participants
were identiﬁed as multivariate outliers at p < 0.001 and were
subsequently removed.

Measurement Model
As the ﬁrst step of the estimation process, the measurement
model was examined by covarying latent and non-latent variables
(see Figure 3). Model ﬁt indices suggested the model ﬁt was
acceptable, χ2(33) = 77.08, p < 0.001, χ2/df = 2.34, CFI = 0.98,
TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.03, RMSEA = 0.06, 90% CI [0.04, 0.08].
Modiﬁcation indices consisted of correlated error terms between
the PTSD latent variable indicators and between indicators of
the PTSD and CSE-T latent indicators. Incorporating error
terms in this fashion is undesirable, as the model may simply
become unique toward the speciﬁc sample used resulting in
low replicability (Ho, 2006). Thus, these changes were not
incorporated. Although the model exhibited a signiﬁcant model
χ2, the acceptable χ2/df value and presence of good ﬁt amongst
the other indices led to retainment of the measurement model.

Factor loadings for the CSE-T and PTSD latent variables
were high, ranging from 0.87 to 0.92 for CSE-T and 0.74 to
0.96 for PTSD. Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance
were signiﬁcantly positively correlated (r = 0.62), however,
only attachment anxiety was signiﬁcantly correlated with the
interaction term (r = 0.21). Attachment anxiety was signiﬁcantly
correlated with CSE-T (r = −0.40) and PTSD (r = 0.44). Similarly,
attachment avoidance was signiﬁcantly correlated with CSE-
T (r = −0.45) and PTSD (r = 0.38). Consistent with prior
work, CSE-T exhibited a moderately strong, negative correlation
with PTSD (r = −0.66). Interestingly, time since trauma was
signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with attachment avoidance
(r = −0.12).

Structural Model
Direct and indirect eﬀects of
the structural model were
estimated using 5,000 bootstraps (see Figure 4). Similarly to
the measurement model, model ﬁt indices suggested the model
ﬁt the data well, χ2(33) = 77.08, p < 0.001, χ2/df = 2.34,
CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.03, RMSEA = 0.06, 90%

CI [0.04, 0.08]. Anxious attachment exhibited signiﬁcant direct
eﬀects with both CSE-T (β = −0.18) and PTSD (β = 0.21) in
expected directions. Avoidant attachment was not signiﬁcantly
directly associated with PTSD symptoms (β = −0.02). Further,
avoidant attachment was signiﬁcantly associated with CSE-T
(β = −0.35). Finally, the interaction term between anxious and
avoidant attachment was not signiﬁcantly associated with either
CSE-T or PTSD symptoms (β = −0.02 and 0.01, respectively).
Thus, the hypotheses regarding avoidant attachment and the
interaction term were not supported.

A signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of anxious attachment on PTSD
symptoms via CSE-T was found, β = 0.11, 95% CI [0.01, 0.22].
Consistent with hypotheses, anxious attachment was negatively
associated with CSE-T, which in turn was negatively associated
with PTSD symptoms. Similarly, a signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of
avoidant attachment on PTSD symptoms via CSE-T was found,
β = 0.21, 95% CI [0.09, 0.33]. Speciﬁcally, greater avoidant
attachment was negatively associated with later CSE-T, which
in turn, was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms. No
signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect of the interaction term on PTSD
symptoms was found, β = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.09].

DISCUSSION

The present study sought to integrate attachment theory (Bowlby,
1982) and SCT (Bandura, 1997) to better understand how
adult attachment styles impact self-appraisals and self-regulation
during the recovery process in a national sample of trauma
survivors. CSE-T was a signiﬁcant mediator between anxious
attachment and later PTSD symptoms. In contrast to hypotheses,
CSE-T also played a mediating role between avoidant attachment
and PTSD symptoms. Finally,
it was hypothesized that the
interaction between anxious and avoidant attachment would
be signiﬁcantly associated with CSE-T and PTSD symptoms.

self-regulation outlined by SCT (Bandura, 1997; Benight and
Bandura, 2004), a signiﬁcant indirect eﬀect was also observed
as predicted. Indeed, results suggest that CSE-T is an important
self-regulation mechanism by which anxious attachment relates
to subsequent PTSD symptoms. Findings here are consistent
with prior work ﬁnding negative associations between anxious
attachment and constructs closely related to CSE-T, such as
perceived control over emotional responses (Vrticvka et al.,
2012), military training-related CSE (Mikulincer and Florian,
1995), and CSE in daily life (Sheinbaum et al., 2015). Though
comparable to these related constructs, CSE-T represents a set of
context speciﬁc self-appraisals more proximal to goals of coping
with demands of trauma recovery.

The inﬂuence of anxious attachment on self-regulation plays
an important role in adaptation from traumatic events. Anxious
attachment is characterized by both a distorted fear of being
abandoned in close relationships and negative appraisals of the
self (Bowlby, 1982; Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016). The self-
derogation typical of adults high in anxious attachment feeds into
hyperactivating strategies as the individual attempts to regain
a sense of security. However, such strategies appear ineﬀective
as a method of self-regulation, as distress and appraisals of
threat are high in those highly anxiously attached (Mikulincer
et al., 1993; Mikulincer and Florian, 1995; Sheinbaum et al.,
2015; Silva et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2017). CSE-T may act as
an explanatory mechanism through which these hyperactivating
strategies exacerbate distress among trauma survivors high in
anxious attachment.

From an SCT perspective, as individuals attempt to cope
with posttraumatic recovery demands, those who struggle to
maintain a sense of competence (i.e., low CSE-T) will struggle

with eﬀective coping and increasing levels of distress (Benight
and Bandura, 2004). Indeed, as CSE-T decreases, there is a greater
perception of potential threats over which one feels incapable
of exerting control. CSE-T ﬁlls an important theoretical gap in
explaining the process by which anxious attachment internal
working models maintain distress. Whereas individuals high in
anxious attachment continue to seek out supports (Mikulincer
et al., 1993; Mikulincer and Florian, 1995; Vogel and Wei, 2005),
they tend to perceive social support as less available due to
the negative internal working models of anxious attachment
(Besser and Neria, 2010, 2012). Thus, social supports fail to
provide relational boosts to support individual coping capacity
(e.g., Smith et al., 2013, 2017) driving down CSE-T appraisals
and thereby exacerbating distress. The hyperactivating strategies
exhibited by those high in anxious attachment appear to reﬂect
this continuous unmet need for felt security, with CSE-T acting as
a mechanism to partially explain such strategies’ ineﬀectiveness.
Future work perhaps utilizing ecological momentary assessments
in vivo measurements typically obtained via
(i.e., real-time,
Smartphone or App) that
target relational dynamics may
provide greater clarity concerning how anxiously attached
individuals experience social support eﬀorts and their own self-
evaluative process.

Contrary to hypotheses, avoidant attachment was signiﬁcantly
associated with lower CSE-T instead of higher eﬃcacy beliefs.
Similar to anxious attachment, CSE-T acted as a mechanism
by which avoidant attachment and PTSD symptoms were
longitudinally associated. The role of avoidant attachment in
coping with stress has been conceptualized as both potentially
adaptive and a potential risk factor for greater distress. Indeed,
it has been argued that the defensive responses exhibited by

Trauma Coping Self-Efﬁcacy Mediates Associations

avoidantly attached individuals, including the suppression of
attachment-related concerns (Fraley and Shaver, 1997) and
positive self-appraisals (Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016) may be
eﬀective in minimizing distress. In contrast, others ﬁnd that
both forms of insecure attachment may make one vulnerable to
diﬃculties adapting from trauma exposure (Fraley et al., 2006;
Franz et al., 2014; Shallcross et al., 2014). The results of the
present study lend support to the latter conceptualization.

The relationship between avoidant attachment and self-
appraisals has largely indicated that avoidant attachment is
associated with positive appraisals of one’s self and one’s
capabilities to cope with stress (Mikulincer and Florian, 1995;
Mikulincer, 1998; Mikulincer and Shaver, 2016), with some
exceptions (e.g., Sheinbaum et al., 2015). Individuals high in
avoidant attachment are thought to engage in inﬂated self-
enhancement when faced with stress (Mikulincer and Florian,
1995; Mikulincer, 1998). However, CSE perceptions speciﬁc to
the context of recovery from a traumatic event are distinct from
self-appraisals in other contexts (e.g., Bandura, 1997; Benight and
Bandura, 2004), such as self-eﬃcacy to cope with military training
(Mikulincer and Florian, 1995) or generalized self-appraisals
(Mikulincer, 1998). Self-eﬃcacy in one area of functioning would
not necessarily be expected to have large carry-over eﬀects to
self-eﬃcacy in another area of functioning. Speciﬁcally, a general
sense of mastery in coping independently with other life stressors
may not enhance CSE following trauma exposure.

In one prospective study examining pre-traumatic event
general self-eﬃcacy (GSE) and the relationship with post-
event CSE,
it was found that when survivors experienced
barriers to mobilizing social support, GSE made minimal
impact on post-event CSE (Smith et al., 2017). Thus,
the
conditions characterizing the social-environmental aspects of
the trauma adaptation process moderated the extent to which
prior self-eﬃcacy carried over to self-eﬃcacy perceptions speciﬁc
to trauma recovery. For those high in avoidant attachment,
the internal working model of others as untrustworthy or
unreliable may act as a self-imposed barrier to mobilizing social
supports, diminishing the eﬀectiveness of pre-event self-eﬃcacy
perceptions in preventing distress.

Whereas both anxious attachment and avoidant attachment
are associated with negative perceptions of perceived social
support, they may be distinguished by help-seeking intentions,
with avoidantly attached adults less inclined to seek support
(Vogel and Wei, 2005). In terms of coping strategies, this
avoidant internal working model of others as unhelpful or
untrustworthy may manifest itself through distancing coping
strategies (Mikulincer et al., 1993; Mikulincer and Florian,
1995). Whereas those high in avoidant attachment may have
generally positive self-appraisals, exposure to a traumatic event
may overwhelm crucial internal coping resources, leaving one
with few other options for coping strategies perceived as
viable. Given a suﬃcient level of distress following trauma and
a perceived lack of support, CSE-T would be depleted and
PTSD symptoms exacerbated. Future studies may incorporate
perceived social support, coping strategies and severity of distress
to elucidate the function of CSE-T as an internal coping
resource over time.

The interaction between anxious and avoidant attachment
was not signiﬁcantly associated with either CSE-T or PTSD
symptoms, suggesting that both insecure attachment orientations
have their detrimental eﬀects on self-regulation independent of
each other following trauma exposure. A potential factor driving
this pattern of ﬁndings may be the type of trauma experienced.
Speciﬁcally, the defenses seen in dismissive individuals may be
more eﬀective when faced with a trauma that more directly
challenges the attachment system, such as traumatic loss (e.g.,
Fraley and Bonanno, 2004). Whereas many traumatic events may
activate the attachment-based self-regulatory system (Mikulincer
and Shaver, 2016) or indirectly challenge the attachment system
by straining close relationships (e.g., Taft et al., 2011), other
types of traumatic events may be more uniquely relevant to the
attachment system, such as interpersonal trauma perpetrated by
a loved one or the accidental or violent death of a loved one.

As hypothesized in the present study, some have suggested
that an avoidant attachment orientation reduces risk for
distress only when accompanied by a low level of anxious
attachment (e.g., dismissive attachment; Fraley and Bonanno,
2004; Woodhouse et al., 2015). Those who are prototypically
dismissing in their attachment orientation may demonstrate skill
in suppressing attachment-related thoughts that lead to distress
(e.g., abandonment, rejection, separation; Fraley and Shaver,
1997), which may allow dismissive individuals to maintain
appraisals of one’s self as strong and independent (Mikulincer and
Shaver, 2016). However, such defenses may be less eﬀective under
prolonged stress (Mikulincer and Shaver, 2003) or high cognitive
load (Mikulincer et al., 2004). The present sample of survivors
were highly trauma-exposed, with high percentages of the sample
endorsing exposure items to numerous traumatic events. Further,
data collection occurred in the context of an ongoing potentially
traumatic event, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. One could argue
that having either high anxious attachment or high avoidant
attachment would demonstrate stronger eﬀects during this level
of trauma exposure.

Limitations
Whereas the present study does beneﬁt
from the use of
longitudinal data, the use of two timepoints may fall short
of expectations for mediation analyses. To establish temporal
precedence in a mediational model, it is recommended that
one use three separate timepoints (Kline, 2016). Another
notable limitation is the representativeness of
the present
sample. Although prior work has found self-report measures of
attachment to be invariant across gender (Gray and Dunlop,
2019) and various ethnic groups (Wei et al., 2004), levels of
attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance may vary by
key demographic variables. For example, attachment avoidance
tends to be greater amongst African Americans and Asian
Americans as compared to White Americans (Wei et al., 2004).
As the present sample was majority White, Female, and well
educated, generalizability of ﬁndings to more diverse groups
may be limited. As with any research utilizing self-report
measures, our ﬁndings lack the beneﬁt of originating from
clinician-administered interviews and are subject to participants’
biases in reporting.

Trauma Coping Self-Efﬁcacy Mediates Associations

Finally, the collection of data occurred during the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic. Given the presence of an ongoing threat to
health of one’s self and of loved ones, as well as disconnection
from some attachment ﬁgures (e.g., close friends), our primary
variables may have been impacted. It is possible that distress,
feelings of isolation, and perceived coping ineﬃcacy may have
been exacerbated beyond what would be anticipated following
trauma exposure alone. A number of environmental and social
factors may impact close relationships during the SARS-CoV-
2 pandemic, including (but not limited to) relationship status,
quality of relationships,
the degree of adherence to social
distancing measures, and eﬀorts to maintain contact with friends
and family. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing behaviors
have been found to be associated with greater depression,
anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress in one cross-sectional study
of adults in the United States (Marroquin et al., 2020). We
did identify one study of the Italian general population on
attachment orientation and distress during the pandemic. They
to be a risk factor for greater
found anxious attachment
distress (OR = 1.08), whereas secure and avoidant attachment
orientation was protective against distress (OR = 0.89 and
0.92, respectively) following a government mandated lockdown
(Moccia et al., 2020).

CONCLUSION

Among the sample of survivors exposed to a criterion A
trauma in the last year, global attachment plays an important
role in explaining variance in PTSD symptoms experienced
through CSE appraisals. Appraisals of one’s eﬃcacy to cope
with trauma symptoms and demands of recovery (i.e., CSE)
represent a mechanism by which adult attachment orientations
inﬂuence PTSD symptoms six weeks later. Insecure attachment
orientations, including anxious and avoidant attachment, were
both indirectly associated with PTSD symptoms via trauma
speciﬁc CSE. The interaction between avoidant and anxious

attachment was not signiﬁcantly associated with either CSE-T
or PTSD symptoms. Overall, the present study highlights the
role of appraisals in how adult attachment orientations impact
self-regulation among trauma survivors. These ﬁndings have
implications for interventions, suggesting eﬃcacy enhancing
support through caregivers and psychotherapy for insecurely
attached trauma survivors may be particularly important.
