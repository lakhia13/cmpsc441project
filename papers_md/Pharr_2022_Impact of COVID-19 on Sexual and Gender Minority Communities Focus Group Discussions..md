Abstract: Background: People who identify as sexual and gender minorities (SGM) experienced
disproportionate economic and mental health issues related to COVID-19 when compared to the
general population. The purpose of this study was to better understand how COVID-19 has impacted
the SGM community and ways to address vaccine hesitancy. Methods: Three focus groups were
conducted with 21 members of the SGM community between 5 November and 10 December 2020.
A thematic analysis using the reﬂexive approach was applied to the transcripts of the focus groups.
Results: Four themes emerged: (1) Impact of COVID-19 on the Community, (2) Perceptions of Contact
Tracing and Testing, (3) Perceptions of a Potential COVID-19 Vaccine, and (4) Decreasing Vaccine
Hesitancy. The most relevant subthemes were that social isolation led to anxiety, stress, and fear in
the SGM community during COVID-19; resilience and adaptation were positive outcomes of the
pandemic; histories of medical racism contributed to hesitancy to get tested; and speciﬁc messaging
from trusted messengers may be needed to encourage SGM communities to get vaccinated. These
ﬁndings support other COVID-19 research on the SGM community during the start of the pandemic.
Conclusions: This study provides insight into the impact of the early stages of COVID-19 on the SGM
community, highlighting the unique hurdles faced by SGM individuals with regard to contact tracing
and vaccine hesitancy.

1. Introduction

In December of 2019, COVID-19 raised concerns around the world as patients in
Wuhan, China, reported unknown respiratory illnesses [1,2]. By January 2020, as cases
began to rise and spread, crossing national borders and continents, the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) declared that coronavirus was a public health emergency of international
concern [1,2]. Less than 2 months later, COVID-19 was upgraded to an international pan-
demic. Given its mode of transmission, experts supported wearing masks, social distancing,
and proper hand hygiene to prevent COVID-19, and many states mandated stay-at-home
orders to stop the spread in March of 2020 [2]. Between workplaces and schools closing, the
imposition of travel restrictions, lockdown measures, signiﬁcant illness, and job layoffs, life
for many Americans shifted quickly and dramatically in response to the pandemic [2,3].

These changes precipitated signiﬁcant economic and mental health concerns. Between
March and April of 2020, 22 million unemployment claims were ﬁled in the United States

(U.S.) in an unprecedented wave of job losses [4]. Ultimately, COVID-19 led to record-
high rates of unemployment, with millions of households experiencing food and housing
insecurity; sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals, communities of color, and
families with children faced disproportionate impacts [4–7]. Additionally, the pandemic
led to an increase in mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, suicide ideation,
and substance use, with SGM people, communities of color, women, immigrants, and
households with children indicating worse overall outcomes [8–10].

SGM individuals, or people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer/questioning, intersex, or asexual, also faced severely disproportionate economic
impacts related to COVID-19 when compared to the general population [7,11]. SGM in-
dividuals reported greater rates of job loss and housing and food insecurity, with SGM
people of color indicating both greater infection rates and ﬁnancial hardships [11,12]. These
types of ﬁnancial hardships are well-documented as having a negative impact on mental
well-being and health [13–17]. In addition, minority stress and stigmatization have been
linked to higher levels of mental illness among SGM individuals, and many members
of the community faced disproportionate rates of mental health disorders prior to the
pandemic [18–29]. COVID-19 further exasperated mental health issues among SGM people
and increased depression, anxiety, stress, suicidality, PTSD, identity concealment, and
COVID-19 related worry [10,30–35].

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, culturally competent mental health assistance was a
barrier to care for many within the SGM community, resulting in greater unmet health needs
than those among non-SGM individuals [36–38]. During the pandemic, healthcare and
mental health support systems around the world faced disruption, potentially impacting
SGM individuals’ health and mental health due to declines in service accessibility [37,38].
Given the pandemic-related mental health issues experienced by SGM individuals com-
bined with the disproportionate ﬁnancial and housing insecurity burdens experienced by
this community during COVID-19, focus groups were conducted to further elucidate the
impact of COVID-19 on the SGM community. Capturing community members’ voices
and experiences was necessary to learn more about the issues, concerns, and experiences
of SGM individuals during the height of the pandemic because of the signiﬁcant health,
employment, and economic disparities experienced by the SGM community both prior to
and during the pandemic. Speciﬁcally, the purpose of this study was to understand how
COVID-19 has impacted the SGM community, community members’ perceptions of contact
tracing and of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, and prospective strategies to address vaccine
hesitancy in the SGM community.

2. Materials and Methods

Because this study focused on questions of “how” or “why” rather than “how many”
or “how much”, qualitative methodology was deemed appropriate. This study was part
of a larger project for which the Nevada Minority Health and Equity Coalition (NMHEC)
was awarded a grant to conduct education and outreach in key communities throughout
the state of Nevada that had been greatly impacted by COVID-19. The larger project
included seven different priority populations: Black/African American, Latinx, Asian,
Native Hawaiian/Paciﬁc Islander, Native American, SGM, and the deaf and hard of
hearing community. Here we present the ﬁndings from the SGM community. Focus groups
were conducted between 5 November and 10 December 2020.

2.1. Focus Group Recruitment and Procedures

Flyers were sent out by community partners through social media or via email, as well
as posted in some organizations’ facilities. Flyers included registration links which took
participants to a Qualtrics survey where they could select a session to attend. For those
who registered, emails were sent out by either staff or community partners regarding the
meeting information and tips for utilizing the Zoom video conferencing platform, such as
using a laptop and headphones. Reminder emails were sent out the day of the meeting,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

3 of 14

and if an email was not provided, a reminder phone call was made. For their participation
in a focus group, individuals were offered a 20-dollar gift card to show appreciation for
their time.

The focus groups were facilitated by at least one person from the partner organization
and two staff members were present to support the facilitator. Focus groups were held
via Zoom. Once the session began, participants were given a short summary explaining
the purpose of the focus group and then were asked for their permission to be recorded.
Participants were also reminded that their name would not be connected to any of their
responses. The facilitator addressed a few ground rules, such as staying present dur-
ing the meeting, limiting side conversations, understanding that all responses are valid,
speaking one at a time, welcoming all perspectives, and keeping information shared by
participants conﬁdential.

At the end of the focus groups, a link to a short demographic survey was provided
in the chat box and participants were asked to complete it directly after the focus group.
No identifying information was collected on this form and completion of the form was not
required to receive the incentive. Focus groups typically lasted 1 h and 30 min.

2.2. Focus Group Questions

Staff created a semi-structured interview of 12 questions, as well as additional prompts
that guided each focus group. Questions were sent out to the community partners to
solicit their input on content and phrasing. The questions served as a guide for the fo-
cus groups, but groups were encouraged to let the conversation ﬂow naturally. These
questions included topics related to how COVID-19 has impacted community members,
case investigation, contact tracing, as well as opinions and planned behaviors related to
the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine hesitancy. Key questions focused on the challenges
that communities have faced, speciﬁc barriers related to each community, cultural beliefs
that may prevent them from getting tested for COVID-19 or taking the vaccine, and any
information that could be shared with the community to address negative perceptions
about testing and a potential vaccine. In addition, information was collected about im-
portant factors and messaging that should be considered when speaking with the priority
populations regarding a vaccine. Participants were also asked about trusted sources for
COVID-19 information in each community. Lastly, participants were asked how they were
impacted by the pandemic so that the researchers could identify factors that affected the
community socially, ﬁnancially, at home, at work, and with regard to technology. An
additional question was asked about how they were coping during that time.

2.3. Data Analysis

The data (audio ﬁles and notes) from the three focus groups were transcribed verbatim
and subjected to a thematic analysis using the reﬂexive approach [39,40]. Two investigators
read the transcripts independently and identiﬁed sentences and phrases meaningful to
the research topic using both a deductive and inductive methods. The inductive approach
was data driven, while the deductive approach was guided by the semi-structured in-
terview guide. The coding was done manually. The initial codes were compared, and
differences were resolved by discussion between the two investigators. A codebook was
then created, and the investigators used the codebook to independently complete the
coding of all transcripts. The ﬁnal codes were then aggregated to generate broad themes
for further examination and discussion. The generated themes were used to understand
the perceptions of the SGM community regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequency
distributions for demographic data of the participants were calculated. We also conducted
member-checking for validity of the results by having members of the focus group review
our themes and subthemes so that they could conﬁrm the credibility of the information
and narrative account.

2.4. Ethical Concerns

This study was deemed exempted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Institutional
Review Board because no identifying information was collected. Prior to participating
in the focus group, participants were provided with an informed consent statement and
had to verbally consent to participate. Verbal consent was selected for anonymity to avoid
linking the participants to the study through a written consent form. Participants were
asked to select a pseudo name to use during the focus group discussion to conceal their
identity. The demographic data collection was anonymous and could not be linked to
participants or their answers.

3. Results

Three focus groups with 21 participants were conducted via Zoom. Participants
were from across the state of Nevada. The demographic characteristics of the participants
are shown in Table 1. A majority of the participants identiﬁed as White (33%), Black or
African American (29%), or Hispanic (19%); were between the ages of 18–50 (67%); had
attended some college or graduated from college (71%); had a gender identify of male
(71%); and rented their homes (66%). The income group reported by the largest percentage
of participants was $15,000–$24,999 (29%).

Several themes emerged from the focus groups speciﬁc to the questions around the
impact of COVID-19 on the SGM community, perceptions of contact tracing and testing,
perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine, and ways to decrease vaccine hesitancy. Themes
with corresponding participant quotes are provided below.

3.1. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Community
3.1.1. Subtheme: Fear, Anxiety, Stress, and Social Isolation

Participants in the focus groups reﬂected most on the impact of COVID-19 on the SGM
community, and there were several different concerns raised. Participants mentioned that
there was fear and anxiety related to the situation, which created a lot of stress, coupled
with missing out on certain experiences such as graduation or starting college. They
also discussed the stress caused by not being able to visit family members who were
hospitalized.

“Having your loved one in the hospital, and you cannot visit. And then when he
passes, you cannot have friends over to console you, making it nearly impossible
to get through your day.”

In addition, many expressed a certain level of social isolation because they could not
be with a community where they felt comfortable and where they could be themselves.
Some reﬂected on SGM people having to spend more time with unsupportive family, while
several mentioned feeling like they had been put into a “box”. Over time, these issues
began to have a negative impact on their overall mental well-being.

“For me, with my addiction and in my recovery, I used to isolate myself a lot.
And so, in recovery, I started gaining a lot of friends . . . And it felt like I lost
that again, and so that was almost triggering in a sense, too. So, it deﬁnitely did
impact my mental health a lot more than I thought it did.”

“She is not fully out to her whole family and now she is just kind of stuck with
them and she kind of has to suppress that all down because her dad . . . says some
very nasty things that I could never repeat but you know it is directed towards
the LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender] community . . . She does not have
the chance to move out and be herself . . . Thanks to COVID, she cannot be happy
or herself.”

3.1.2. Subtheme: Impacts on Physical Health

Participants reﬂected on the pandemic’s varied impacts on their physical health. While
no health impacts were discussed by some participants, others reported that they were not
exercising as much as before.

“You cannot get around as much... I mean, you can choose to exercise in your
house, but . . . those four walls tend to get smaller and smaller when you try to
exercise . . . And it gets old after a while.”

Additionally, medical visits shifting from in-ofﬁce to virtual visits was a topic of focus,

and this seemed to be a positive change for some participants.

“I actually prefer all the telehealth. For me, I work Monday to Friday, so business
hours for most ofﬁces. And it is hard to go before work or after work or even on
lunch because it will make me late to anything, so doing it with Zoom or over
the phone, I can just go into my car real quick, get it done, [and] go back to work
without have to worry about missing hours or having to call in or anything like
that.”

3.1.3. Subtheme: Disability and Co-Morbidities as Additional Challenges

Some participants expressed that members of the SGM community were likely to be
at an elevated risk for contracting COVID-19 compared to other groups due to high rates of
underlying conditions, such as being immunocompromised. Other participants reﬂected on

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

6 of 14

how having disabilities or other co-morbidities made living during the pandemic especially
challenging. During the “stay-at-home” period when one of the few options to leave one’s
home was to go outside, some were not able to easily do so due to their disabilities, leading
to a sense of isolation.

“I’m disabled, and it has been really rough to get outside, I cannot go.”

Additionally, it became more challenging to ﬁnd care for other co-morbidities during

the pandemic.

“I am currently battling cancer, and so I am immunocompromised. So being
in a pandemic, and battling cancer, and being immunocompromised, is quite
an ordeal.”

3.1.4. Subtheme: Economic Challenges

Among participants who were not facing pandemic-related lay-offs or job loss, some
mentioned that their employers would ﬁre people if they called in sick, forcing employees to
potentially go to work infected because they were in need of money. Many participants also
commented that their families or themselves experienced the loss of work, which also made
COVID-19 very challenging. This was especially true for those in the performance industry.

“I’m a dancer so a lot of those opportunities have been shut down, especially for
the performers on the [Las Vegas] Strip. I would say [the impact of job loss] has
been more so in the creative arts realm.”

3.1.5. Subtheme: Resilience and Adaptation

Although much of the discussion around COVID-19 focused on challenges, partici-
pants did discuss how they were adapting to the situation and ﬁnding resilience. Partici-
pants talked about trying new things, such as hobbies, with a sense of hope and optimism.

“I went and got myself a sewing machine and . . . I am sewing everything now.
I am ﬁxing my own clothes, I am making masks . . . and that is all because
of COVID.”

“Instead of doing phone interviews [for my podcast], I do them all via Zoom
and record them so it is . . . on the Facebook page, but then it is also audio. So, it
makes it more engaging, and, you know, it gains a . . . broader audience . . . [by]
bringing it visually instead of just hearing.”

“I am having my ﬁrst doctor’s appointment on Zoom . . . so I am excited to try
it out.”

3.2. Perceptions of Contact Tracing and Testing

When discussing different methods of tracking COVID-19, the majority of participants
did not have any concerns. They expressed that they were familiar with methods that are
used for sexually transmitted infections (STI’s), including HIV. However, some participants
still expressed apprehension about using an online application that obtained personal
information and could potentially track one’s location. There was also confusion about how
COVID-19 tracking would be accurate, as it relies on people self-reporting. Three major
themes emerged: cultural attitudes of Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic SGM
people toward getting tested for COVID-19, histories of medical racism, and the stigma
associated with having a positive test.

3.2.1. Subtheme: Cultural Attitudes Contributing to Hesitancy to Get Tested

Participants talked about how culture inﬂuences decisions about seeking medical
care and how that might guide Black/African American and Latinx/Hispanic individuals’
decisions about getting tested for COVID-19.

“It is harder for the Black and Hispanic communities to get on board with testing
just because there are so many barriers in healthcare and access to healthcare. and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

7 of 14

when you ask people in those communities about where they receive healthcare,
a lot of them are very disjointed. It is kind of random. They only go to the doctor
when they are sick . . . it is going to be really important for the medical community
and organizations that serve those communities to reach into those communities
and create messages that resonate—not just that it is safe to get vaccinated and
they can give them the science behind it, like someone said, but also that it is a
safe place to come and get vaccinated where you will not be judged [and] it will
not cost you”.

“I am a Mexican–American, OK? And if you are not [from a] Latino family, you
know some folks be like . . . all you got is just a cough, a sneeze, mild indigestion.
Just put on some Vicks, and you are good. [LAUGHS] They would be saying
stuff like that. And thinking that, oh, it is not COVID, it is just you being you, or
your allergies, or something else.”

3.2.2. Subtheme: Histories of Medical Racism Contributing to Hesitancy to Get Tested

Participants also reﬂected on how past medical racism contributes to hesitancy among
minority SGM people, and particularly Black/African American community members,
toward getting tested for COVID-19 or engaging in contact tracing.

“So, you know, historically mentioning the Tuskegee Airmen . . . Black bodies
have been used in medical experiments, Black women, Black men, and . . . is
there anything related to the LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer]
community that would prevent folks from wanting to get tested or do contact
tracing that is kind of related to the same thing?”

“I think it carries over, it is kind of passed down. I know statistically speaking
African Americans are the most timid to go to the doctors, they are afraid that
they cannot trust the information because of such things that have happened
historically. So, I believe it is carried into the LGBTQ community for Black bodies
because you cannot separate your Black from your LGBTQ so they kind of go
hand in hand, so I think that those cultural beliefs, that have been passed down
historically—they are continuing.”

3.2.3. Subtheme: Stigma against Positive Tests and Testing

Stigma against testing positive for COVID-19 was also identiﬁed as a barrier to getting
tested. Concerns centered around quarantining the household if a person tested positive
and the fear of being ostracized from the community if others found out that a person had
tested positive for COVID-19. One participant talked about the backlash they received after
announcing on social media that they had been tested for COVID-19.

“I’m scared to get tested. Because if I’m tested, and I get positive, then like
everybody in my household is shut down.”

“COVID is also becoming a taboo. And even in the gay community, where, like,
they would not want to tell you because they’re ostracized from the community,
even if it is 2 weeks or a month.”

“When they ﬁrst announced that they were doing free COVID testing, you know.
I made it publicly known on Facebook that I went and got tested and I received
so much backlash. Saying, why did you go get tested?”

3.3. Perceptions of a Potential COVID-19 Vaccine

While some participants were in favor of being vaccinated, some participants in the
focus groups expressed concerns about taking the COVID-19 vaccine, especially during its
initial rollout, as they did not want to be the ﬁrst to try it. The political climate was also
identiﬁed as a barrier to the COVID-19 vaccine.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

8 of 14

Subtheme: Political Climate Inﬂuences on COVID-19 Vaccine and Informational Hesitancy

The political climate was identiﬁed as an inﬂuence on COVID-19 precautions and
vaccines. However, participants felt that things might get better since a new administration
had been elected.

“I just wanted to ask [is there] speciﬁcally anything from a cultural standpoint
from the LGBTQ community that might prevent us from getting the vaccine?
Yeah, while Trump is still in the ofﬁce . . . I would not think about it [vac-
cine] now.”

“Everything that I was worried about was kind of what the president was saying,
or the ex-president, because he was kind of just like not wanting diverse people
to get help, but now that we have a bit of a brighter future. I believe that there
should not be as many problems.”

3.4. Decreasing Vaccine Hesitancy

Participants were asked what they would recommend to reduce vaccine hesitancy
within the SGM community. Four themes emerged as important to reducing hesitancy,
including clarifying what type of information to present to SGM individuals and what
questions should be answered, increasing community understanding about trusted sources
of vaccine information, addressing resources needed to make the vaccine accessible, and
creating potential messages to encourage the SGM community to get vaccinated.

3.4.1. Subtheme: Information Needed to Trust the Vaccine

Participants wanted honest information to be provided to the community, present-
ing both the pros and cons of the vaccine. They also highlighted questions that they
thought needed to be answered for SGM individuals to participate in COVID-19 vaccina-
tion programs.

• How was the vaccine developed so quickly?
•
•

If I am taking hormone treatments, can I still get the vaccine?
If I have HIV is the vaccine less likely to work?

3.4.2. Subtheme: Trusted Sources of Vaccine-Related Information

Participants discussed the sources that they trusted for information about the COVID-

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Family/friends who are health professionals

19 vaccine. These included:
•
•
• World Health Organization
• News on TV or Radio
•

Social media inﬂuencers

3.4.3. Subtheme: Making the Vaccine Accessible

Participants were asked what would be necessary in order for people to have access
to the vaccine. The following were the top recommendations to ensure that people in the
community could obtain the vaccine.

• Needs to be free
• Need to be offered in a close, convenient location, such as:

Clubs
Common gathering spaces like recreation centers
Places that speciﬁcally serve the community
The LGBTQ Center

3.4.4. Subtheme: Potential Messages for the Vaccine

Participants were also asked what type of messages would be most likely to encourage
SGM community members to receive the vaccine. The main messaging recommenda-
tions were:
•
•
•

Do not allow anybody to intimidate or force them to do anything; this is a choice
See friends and family again by getting vaccinated
Vaccine messaging should be relevant to the SGM culture without stereotyping

“I was thinking it is kind of like the, you know, the PrEP messaging. So, the
vaccine . . . could mean that people could go to clubs and be in crowds and hook
up and not worrying about catching COVID so, I would say it gets you back to
normal. It gets you back to normal.”

“[The messages] just seem very redundant and stale, so I would just like to see
something more creative, expressive, colorful, not stereotypical, do not get me
wrong, but something that just encapsulates us, but all different versions of us.
Not the same version of us, either.”

4. Discussion

The results of this study show that the SGM community has been uniquely impacted by
COVID-19. In Nevada, a relatively high proportion of the population (5.5%) self-represents
as a sexual or gender minority individual, and 51% of SGM Nevadans are from diverse
racial or ethnic backgrounds [41]. This intersectionality of identities was present in the
themes identiﬁed by focus group participants. For example, job loss and medical racism
were two of several issues cited by participants.

Notably, SGM people of color were two times as likely as white non-SGM individuals
to receive a positive COVID-19 test result during the early stage of the pandemic [11].
This is signiﬁcant, as SGM people of color faced disproportionate rates of pandemic-
related lay-offs or furloughs, leading to ﬁnancial hardship in acquiring basic needs, and
26% expressed concern about paying for housing [11]. Due to factors including lack of
workplace protections, discrimination, and under-funded schools, SGM people of color
experience disproportionate rates of poverty and unemployment and are some of the most
vulnerable employees in the workforce [42]. These concerns were highlighted within the
focus groups.

Racism and violence have long been present in medicine and healthcare in the U.S.,
resulting in many inequities such as unequal access to care and the barring of Black
Americans from pursuing medical degrees [43]. While most focus group participants were
used to contact tracing, as it has long been used within the SGM community for sexually
transmitted infections such as HIV, others were wary about being part of a biological
database. Some described racism and homophobia in the medical ﬁeld as a constraint to
getting tested for COVID or participating in contact tracing, naming both the Tuskegee
untreated syphilis study and ongoing structural barriers to care and discrimination in
healthcare as injustices preventing communities of color from accessing healthcare [44,45].
Participants also cited racism within the highest levels of government as impacting
health outcomes during the pandemic, describing the Trump administration’s handling of
COVID-19 as harmful to communities of color and a barrier to vaccination uptake. In 2018,
a survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed that
57% of adults—including 80% of Black Americans, 75% of Hispanic/Latinx Americans,
and almost half of white Americans—believed that President Donald Trump was a racist,
with many feeling that he had exacerbated racism against communities of color [46,47].
This sentiment was echoed within focus groups and was named as a barrier to receiving
the vaccine while he was in ofﬁce.

Additionally, focus group participants reported that they, or their loved ones, had
experienced job loss or the threat of it, with entertainers particularly impacted by pandemic
job-related disruptions. Nevada was one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic, as there is

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

a higher percentage of Nevadans employed in the hospitality, leisure, and retail spaces [48].
Despite casinos reopening, many positions have not returned, leaving experts to warn that
Nevada’s economy may take years to fully recover [49]. Respondents said that business
closures affected not only workers, but also those with disabilities/comorbidities and those
who relied on community supports to combat stigma-related alienation and isolation.

COVID-19 disproportionately impacted people with disabilities in many ways, in-
cluding accessing healthcare, education, employment, and mental health services [50].
For example, mask mandates severely hindered communication for those with hearing
impairments, as lipreading became impossible. Further, business closures and stay-at-home
mandates deprived many SGM individuals of their social supports, such as those found in
resource centers and clubs, leaving many stuck with intolerant family or roommates [51].
Focus group participants cited these apprehensions, as well as stigma- and isolation-related
negative impacts on mental well-being over time. This is particularly concerning given
this population’s unduly high rates of discrimination-related mental health issues such as
anxiety, stress, depression, and suicidality [52–58].

While there are signiﬁcant barriers to COVID testing, contact tracing participation,
and vaccine uptake, this study also revealed several silver linings. Firstly, participants
illuminated strategies to address vaccine and testing hesitancy, such as the need for public
health and health communication practitioners to recognize that SGM individuals comprise
a highly diverse community. Accordingly, pandemic-related materials targeting the SGM
community should be representative and applicable, with one participant recommending
that advertisements showcase how vaccination uptake can foster a quicker return to social-
ization. Another participant highlighted campaigns surrounding pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) as effectively reaching and impacting its priority audience. This observation is
backed by data: Chicago’s PrEP4Love campaign was sex-positive and equity-focused,
featuring individuals of all genders and backgrounds. Thanks to its cultural competency
and innovative messaging to target vulnerable populations, the campaign successfully
reached millions of people [59].

Lastly, participants expressed community members’ resilience and adaptability. Whether

learning a new hobby or embracing new technologies, participants found ways to ﬁnd
some brightness in unprecedented times. While this is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding, it should in
no way obscure or minimize that resilience is a concept that must be situated within the
context of structural and social determinants of health [60,61]. Given this community’s
diversity, with many members facing intersectional oppressions, individual determinants
are insufﬁcient.

Limitations

As with any study, this study does have limitations. Participation was not random;
therefore, there could be something different about those who participated in the focus
groups compared to those who chose not to participate. Additionally, participants were only
from Nevada, and perceptions of SGM people from other states may have been different
due to differences in stay-at-home requirements, unemployment rates, state laws protecting
SGM people from discrimination, or the acceptance of SGM community members. This
could limit the generalizability of the results. In addition, given that the majority of the
focus groups were held online, it excluded those who do not have access to technology.

5. Conclusions

This study provides insight into the impacts at the height of COVID-19 on the SGM
community, highlighting the unique hurdles faced by SGM individuals with regard to
contact tracing and vaccine hesitancy. While SGM community members were adversely
impacted by social isolation, which contributed to stress and anxiety, they also found
resilience and the ability to adapt during the early months of the pandemic [62]. Finding
avenues for social inclusion and social connection during stay-at-home mandates were
important for SGM peoples’ health and well-being, especially for those who had to return

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 50

home to live with unsupportive family members [63–65]. Contact tracers were not a new
experience for our (male) participants, as they were familiar with contact tracing for other
diseases such as those that are sexually transmitted. Participants provided insight into
important messaging for the SGM community to help overcome vaccine hesitancy. This
study also suggests that public health practitioners must be culturally competent and
committed to addressing historical and ongoing inequities to improve pandemic-related
health outcomes within the SGM community. Implications of this research for policymakers
include understanding the on-the-ground impact of policies on vulnerable populations
who might be more at risk for mental health issues, unemployment, social isolation, and
discrimination. Additionally, policymakers need to understand the unique needs of diverse
constituents in order to effectively communicate with them during times of emergency,
such as a global pandemic.
