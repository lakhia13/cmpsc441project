Abstract
Numerous placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the ability of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to induce
rapid (within hours),
transient antidepressant effects when administered intravenously (IV) at subanesthetic doses
(0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). However, the optimal antidepressant dose remains unknown. We aimed to compare to active
placebo the rapid acting antidepressant properties of a broad range of subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine among outpatients
with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A range of IV ketamine doses were compared to active placebo in the treatment
of adult TRD over a 3-day period following a single infusion over 40 min. This was an outpatient study conducted across six
US academic sites. Outpatients were 18–70 years old with TRD, deﬁned as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g.,
less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at least two adequate treatment courses during the current
depressive episode. Following a washout period, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the ﬁve arms in a
1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single intravenous dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), a single dose of ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), a
single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), and a single dose of midazolam
0.045 mg/kg (active placebo) (n = 19). The study assessments (HAM-D-6, MADRS, SDQ, PAS, CGI-S, and CGI-I) were
performed at days 0, 1, 3 (endpoint), 5, 7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efﬁcacy. The overall group × time interaction
effect was signiﬁcant for the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6. In post hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for
multiple comparisons, standard dose (0.5 mg/kg) and high dose (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to active
placebo; a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was signiﬁcant only prior to adjustment (p = 0.02, p-adj = 0.14, d = −0.82 at day 1). Most
of the interaction effect was due to differences at day 1, with no signiﬁcant adjusted pairwise differences at day 3. This
pattern generally held for secondary outcomes. The infusions of ketamine were relatively well tolerated compared to active
placebo, except for greater dissociative symptoms and transient blood pressure elevations with the higher doses. Our results
suggest that there is evidence for the efﬁcacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no
clear or consistent evidence for clinically meaningful efﬁcacy of lower doses of IV ketamine. Trial Registration:
NCT01920555.

● Findings: Our results suggest that there is evidence for
the efﬁcacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg subanes-
thetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or consistent
evidence for clinically meaningful efﬁcacy of lower

differences at day 1.

● Meaning: Our results suggest that there is a range of
effective, subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine in TRD.

Introduction

Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a signiﬁcant and
common clinical challenge [1–3]. There are only four
pharmacological treatments that are FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) approved for adjunctive treatment in TRD
patients: aripiprazole [4], quetiapine [5], olanzapine–ﬂuox-
etine combination [6], and brexpiprazole [7]. In addition,
only three non-pharmacological
therapies have been
approved for TRD: transcranial magnetic stimulation [8],
vagus nerve stimulation) [9], and electroconvulsive therapy
[10]. There is a critical need for novel treatments for TRD
patients.

Subanesthetic doses of ketamine— an N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist—have shown pro-
mise for the rapid treatment of TRD patients [11–14]. Over
the last decade, a series of placebo-controlled studies have
conﬁrmed the ability of intravenous (IV) ketamine (0.5 mg/
kg infusion) to provide signiﬁcant symptom amelioration in
TRD patients within a few hours, with symptoms typically
returning within a period of days after discontinuation of the
acute intervention [13, 14]. However, the exact mechanism
of action of ketamine is not yet clear [15]. As pointed out in
a recent review [13], nine meta-analyses of acute-phase
randomized short-term trials of ketamine for depression
have now reported statistically signiﬁcant advantages of
ketamine over placebo or active control conditions, across a
variety of measures of depressive symptoms.

Though ketamine shows promise as a rapidly acting
antidepressant, almost all the previous studies used standard
IV doses of 0.5 mg/kg over 40 min; therefore, the optimal
ketamine dose for the treatment of depression remains
unknown. In this study, we aimed to assess the extent to
which a single infusion of one of four different doses of
ketamine was superior to active placebo in the treatment of
TRD patients over 72 h (day 3), when added to stable,
standard
trial:
NCT01920555). In addition, we explored whether there
were signiﬁcant differences in adverse event rates, dis-
sociative symptoms, and blood pressure changes across this
range of doses.

Methods

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the
acute efﬁcacy of IV ketamine or placebo added to ongoing
antidepressant therapy (ADT) in the treatment of major
depressive disorder (MDD) adults with TRD. Following a
washout period for patients on prohibited psychotropic
agents, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one
of ﬁve 40 min infusion arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single
dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), a single dose of
ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), a single dose of ketamine
0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg
(n = 20), and a single dose of midazolam 0.045 mg/kg
(active placebo) (n = 19) (see Fig. 1) to minimize the
unblinding risk due to adverse events (AEs), as in Mur-
rough et al [16]. Prior to randomization, patients were
grouped by body mass index (BMI) (group I: BMI ≤ 30;
group II: BMI > 30), and were block randomized into each
arm of the study, with the mg/kg ratio being maintained
across all BMIs. The primary endpoint assessments were
carried out over 3 days and all subjects were followed for
30 days to examine the beneﬁt durability (see Fig. 1).

The study assessments were performed at days 0, 1, 3, 5,
7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efﬁcacy of all doses of
ketamine compared to active placebo therapy in depressed
patients demonstrating an inadequate response to at least 2
adequate ADTs during the current major depressive episode
(TRD). This report focuses on the outcome during the acute
phase of the study (days 0 through 3). This trial was con-
ducted across six US academic sites (Massachusetts General
Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine/Michael E. Debakey
VA Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai, Stanford University School of Medicine, University
of Texas Southwestern, and Yale University) according to
the US FDA guidelines and Declaration of Helsinki. Insti-
tutional Review Board (IRB)- and National Institute of
Mental Health Data and Safety Monitoring Board (NIMH
DSMB)-approved written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.

All enrolled subjects were male and female outpatients
between the ages of 18 and 70 years with a diagnosis of
MDD in a current depressive episode of at least 8-week
duration (as deﬁned by the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision
(DSM-IV-TR™)). The diagnosis of MDD was supported by
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Patient Edi-
tion (SCID-I/P). Furthermore, all subjects had TRD, deﬁned
as failure to achieve a subjective satisfactory response (e.g.,
less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at
two adequate treatment courses during the current
least
depressive episode (including the current ADT). All study
participants with MDD were required to be on a stable (for
least 4 weeks) and adequate (according to the

ongoing ADT, with a total treatment duration of at least
8 weeks. Concurrent hypnotic therapy was allowed if the
therapy had been stable for at
least 4 weeks prior to
screening and was expected to remain stable during the
study. Patients were also allowed to continue treatment with
benzodiazepines used for anxiety if therapy had been stable
for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and expected to
remain stable during the study. Patients on exclusionary
concomitant psychotropic medications (e.g., opioids, tra-
madol, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, barbitu-
rates, eszopiclone, stimulants, NMDA receptor antagonists
such as memantine) were included only if they had been
free of the exclusionary medication post-taper for ﬁve half-
lives within the maximum screening period (28 days).
Furthermore, subjects could be in concurrent psychother-
if stable. All subjects had a Montgomery–Asberg

both the screen and baseline visits. All included patients
were required to have a BMI between 18 and 35 kg/m2.

Major exclusion criteria were as follows: failure to

courses of a therapeutic dose of an ADT of at least 8-week
duration in the current major depressive episode, MADRS
total score of <20 at screening or baseline; a primary Axis I
disorder other than MDD; current substance use disorder
(abuse or dependence), with the exception of nicotine
dependence, within 6 months prior to screening; and any
history of ketamine or phencyclidine drug use. All subjects
underwent urine drug testing at screening. Other major
exclusion criteria included a history of bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorders, or any history
of psychotic symptoms in the current or previous depressive
episodes. Furthermore, previous participants in research
studies involving glutamatergic agents for depression were
also excluded.

Following the in-person screen, the diagnosis and ade-
quacy of treatment was conﬁrmed by remote, independent
raters from the MGH Clinical Trials Network and Institute
(CTNI), via a teleconference administration of the Mood
Disorders module of the SCID-I/P, MADRS, and the MGH
ATRQ.

Assessments (outcome and safety measures)

All subjects were evaluated by the study clinicians with
respect to the efﬁcacy and safety measures described below.
The 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-6)
[18–21], with the time frame of the past 24 h, was admi-
nistered as the primary outcome measure at each visit (days
0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 30) by the independent, remote MGH

CTNI raters, as this version of the scale has been shown to
be more sensitive to detect changes with treatment than the
original 17-item version [21]. The intra-class correlation
coefﬁcient for the HAM-D-6 was >0.8 for all central raters,
a reﬂection of the high inter-rater reliability. The follow-up
sessions were conducted according to the method described
by Fawcett et al. [22].

Secondary measures of depression were the MADRS,
administered by the site clinicians, the self-rated Symptoms
the self-rated
of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) [23],
Positive Affect Scale (PAS), the self-rated Snaith-Hamilton
Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) [24] and the global severity and
improvement scales of the Clinical Global Impressions
(CGI-S and CGI-I) [25]. These were administered at days 0,
1 (except for the MADRS), 3, 5, 7, 14, and 30, with a time
frame of the past 24 h for the SDQ, PAS, SHAPS, CGI-S,
and CGI-I, and of the past 3 days for the MADRS. Visual
analogue scales (VAS) components assessing happy, sad,
drowsy, irritated, alert, anxious, and restless [26, 27] were
also administered with a time frame of the past 24 h, both
immediately prior to starting and at 120 min post initiation
of the infusion. We also administered at every visit the
clinician-rated Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-
SSRS) [28], a measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation
and behavior. Dissociative symptoms during the infusion
were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dis-
sociative States Scale (CADSS) [29] at −5, 40, 80, and
120 min in relation to the start of the infusion. Blood
pressure and heart rate were measured at
time 0 (right
before starting the infusion), and at 15–20-min intervals for
120 min following the infusion. Vital signs were measured
at every study visit. Blood pressure was measured while the
patient was supine and sitting. Observations were recorded
pre-, post-, and during the infusion. To capture elevated
systolic and diastolic blood pressure observations above a
speciﬁed value (systolic >155, diastolic >99), each obser-
vation was dichotomously classiﬁed as in or out of range in
our analyses.

At the screen visit and day 14, patients had a physical
examination and at the screen visit, day 0, and day 3, they
had blood drawn for chemistry and complete blood count
(CBC) blood tests, and underwent electrocardiography
(ECG) at day 0 and day 1. The presence of any potential
side effect or adverse event were carefully documented at
screen (for the past week) and at every subsequent visit
(covering events since the last visit) using both the spon-
taneously reported adverse events and the Systematic
for Treatment Emergent Events–Systematic
Assessment
Inquiry (SAFTEE-SI). The SAFTEE-SI [30] is a self-rated
questionnaire assessing possible adverse events during the
course of the trial. The time frame is the past 24 h. Reasons
including intolerable side
for premature discontinuation,
temperature, and
effects, were recorded. Weight, oral

standing and supine pulse and blood pressure (Vital Signs)
were recorded at each visit.

Statistical analyses

The primary aim was to demonstrate that any of the four
doses of ketamine were superior to active placebo in
reducing the HAM-D-6 score among TRD patients within
72 h, when added to stable antidepressant therapy. Sec-
ondary outcomes were changes in scores on the MADRS,
CGI-S, CGI-I, SDQ, and PAS. To this end, we used a
repeated-measures ﬁxed-effects model for the observations
taken at baseline, day 1 and day 3, with terms for visit (i.e.,
days 0, 1, and 3), and visit × treatment, the primary contrasts
of interest being the difference between the four active
treatments and placebo. To account for potential differences
by site, we included SITE and its interaction terms with
VISIT and TREATMENT in the original model, and
removed non-signiﬁcant terms one by one, leaving us with
the basic VISIT, TREATMENT, and VISIT × TREAT-
MENT that we report here. To conduct this analysis, we
used PROC MIXED, with an unspeciﬁed variance covar-
iance matrix. This analysis allowed the possibility of missed
visits and is robust to data missing at random. To protect the
family-wise error rate in the presence of multiple testing
(i.e., each of four groups compared to placebo at days 1 and
3, resulting in 8 contrasts of interest), we used Holm’s
sequentially rejective multiple test procedure [31].

We conducted two types of comparisons: 2-groups:
superiority is demonstrated by a statistically signiﬁcant
greater decrease on the HAM-D-6 total score for patients
receiving any ketamine dose versus active placebo therapy;
5-groups: comparing each of the four ketamine doses to the
active placebo group, using Holm’s method to protect
family-wise error rate in the presence of multiple testing.
Speciﬁcally, Holm’s [31] method was applied to the model-
produced differences of least squares for the a priori iden-
tiﬁed contrasts of interest. In the 2-group model, there were
two such comparisons (i.e., the comparisons between the
combined ketamine group vs. placebo at days 1 and 3); in
the 5-group model, there were eight such comparisons (i.e.,
each of the four ketamine groups compared to placebo at
days 1 and 3). The probability was deemed to be 80% that
the study would detect a treatment difference between each
ketamine dose and the active placebo if the effect size was
greater than 1.

Secondary outcomes

We conducted comparisons of antidepressant efﬁcacy of all
doses of ketamine vs. active placebo on multiple measures
of antidepressant efﬁcacy, such as the MADRS, CGI-S,
the continuous secondary
CGI-I, SDQ, and PAS. For

efﬁcacy variables, the same approach as for the primary
efﬁcacy variable was used for the analyses.

Comparison of response rates on all of ketamine doses or
active placebo at day 3 was carried out, with response being
deﬁned as a 50% or greater reduction in HAM-D-6 score
from baseline. Differences in response rates were compared
by performing an analysis using a generalized linear model
of the repeated measures. A logit link function was used and
the statistical inferences were based on generalized esti-
mating equations (GEE).

We also tested if treatment effects on the primary out-
come variable, HAM-D-6, were sustained through the
follow-up period. To this end, we used the same model
building approach as for the primary outcome analysis, but
focused on assessments made on days 3–30. For parsimony,
we modeled time linearly. In this analysis, the effect of
interest was the main effect of TREATMENT.

We also compared changes in C-SSRS scores, and dis-
sociative symptom levels, using CADSS scores, across all
ketamine doses vs. active placebo. A correlation between
depression outcome and dissociative symptoms was carried
out based on any changes between 0 (−5 min) and 40, 80,
and 120 min in the CADSS data. A correlation between
depression outcome and C-SSRS scores was carried out.

Emergence of abnormal chemistry, CBC, or ECG con-
ditions was tracked and tallied. Percentages of patients in
the two treatment groups who experienced new or exacer-
bated spontaneously reported AEs were presented and
analyzed overall and for each type of event.

Results

We initially planned to randomize 100 subjects, but we
completed the study by randomizing 99 subjects, given the
higher than expected retention. The retention was 96% at
day 1, 95% at day 3 (endpoint), 95% at day 5, 92% at day 7,
88% at day 14, and 87% at day 32. Table 1 summarizes the
sociodemographic and baseline clinical characteristics of
the patients randomized to treatment. Characteristics were
relatively similar across the ﬁve treatment groups, though it
should be noted that, by chance, all the subjects assigned to
the 0.2 mg/kg arm were whites, and there was a nearly 20%
difference in the proportion of women between the ﬁve
groups, with 40% women in the ketamine 1.0 mg/kg group,
and 58% women in the midazolam group. On average, the
0.2 mg/kg group was more treatment resistant, as it had, on
average, a history of one extra failed trial of antidepressants
compared to the 0.5 mg/kg group.

During the study, 4 subjects mistakenly received lower
doses than they were randomized to receive due to calcu-
lation errors. One subject, assigned to the ketamine 0.1 mg/
kg group, was underdosed by 33%, one subject, assigned to

the midazolam 0.045 mg group, was underdosed by 32%,
one subject assigned to the ketamine 0.2 mg/kg group, was
underdosed by 11%, and one subject, assigned to ketamine
1.0 mg/kg group, was underdosed by 6.5%. As per recom-
mendation by the NIMH DSMB, these 4 subjects were
retained in the analyses, as originally randomized.

On the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6, there
was a statistically signiﬁcant day by group interaction effect
(p = 0.0278) in the 2-group analysis between ketamine and
active placebo (see Fig. 2a). Similarly, there was a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant (p = 0.0391) day by group interaction
effect in the 5-group analysis between ketamine (0.1, 0.2,

0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) and active placebo (see Fig. 2b). Table 2
provides the pairwise comparisons of HAM-D-6 changes
between ketamine doses and active placebo (midazolam
0.045 mg/kg), with Cohen’s effect sizes above 0.8 at day 1
for three doses (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) and Cohen’s effect
sizes above 0.4 at day 3 for three doses (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/
kg). Only the 0.5 mg/kg and the 1.0 mg/kg dose remained
statistically superior to placebo after adjusting for multiple
comparisons, and only at day 1.

On the secondary outcomes, statistical signiﬁcance of the
group × time interaction effect was only achieved for the

signiﬁcance of the group × interaction effects, but focuses
on comparisons that were statistically signiﬁcant. Here it
can be seen that, after adjustment for multiple comparisons,
the 0.5 mg/kg dose was superior to placebo on all secondary
outcomes, but only on day 1, with the exception of the
MADRS, which was not assessed on day 1, and which did
have a signiﬁcant difference on day 3. The 1.0 mg/kg dose
was also superior to placebo on day 1 on the CGI-S.
Cohen’s d differences ranged from 0.94 to 1.27 for these
effects.

Additionally, non-signiﬁcant medium to large effects
(i.e., d ≥ 0.50) were observed across all secondary outcomes
(see Supplementary Table 1), and across three of the four
doses (i.e., not for the 0.2 mg/kg dose), with effects ranging
for the 0.1 mg/kg dose from d = 0.50 (day 1 on the CGI-I)
to 0.85 (day 1 on the CGI-S), for the 0.5 mg/kg dose from
0.60 (day 3 on the CGI-I) to 0.75 (day 3 on the CGI-S), and
for the 1.0 mg/kg dose from 0.51 (day 1 on the SDQ) to
0.62 (day 3 on the CGI-S). In line with outcomes on the
primary outcome measure, effects tended to be larger for
day 1 than day 3. Response rates (HAM-D-6 reduction from
baseline score ≥50%) were 31% for 0.1 mg/kg, 21% for 0.2
mg/kg, 59% for 0.5 mg/kg, 53% for 1.0 mg/kg, and 11% for
midazolam on day 1, and 47% for 0.1 mg/kg, 37% for 0.2

ketamine may have maintained lower scores on the HAM-
D-6 throughout days 3–30,
though notably this overall
effect was no longer signiﬁcant when comparing each
ketamine dose to midazolam. Exploration of the per-dose
comparisons suggest that the signiﬁcant effect of the 2-
group comparison may largely be due to effects in the 1.0
mg/kg group (see Supplementary Figure 2). In fact, the
average HAM-D-6 scores across days 14 and 30 were 10.42
for 0.1 mg/kg, 10.14 for 0.2 mg/kg, 10.18 for 0.5 mg/kg,
8.26 for 1 mg/kg, and 11.08 for active placebo (midazolam).
In both comparisons, there was a signiﬁcant main effect of
time (F(1, 92) = 18.93, p < 0.01; F(1, 89) = 18.87, p <
0.01), indicating that HAM-D-6 scores increased from days
3 to 30.

The scores on the CADSS during the infusion are
reported in Supplementary Figure 3. There was a clear dose
response 40 min after the infusion, with both 0.5 mg/kg and
1 mg/kg doses being signiﬁcantly (p < 0.0001) greater than
active placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg); the lower keta-
mine doses were not signiﬁcantly different from active
placebo. There were no statistically signiﬁcant correlations
between CADSS scores 40 min after
infusion
and HAM-D-6 scores at day 1 (r = −0.19; n = 94) and day
3 (r = −0.13; n = 92).

the

Regarding unblinding, both clinicians’ and participants’
guesses of treatment assignment were signiﬁcantly related
to actual treatment group (p < 0.01 for both), where both
groups were able to correctly guess assignment to ketamine
for the 0.5 mg/kg (100% and 77% guessed correctly by
clinicians and participants, respectively) and the 1.0 mg/kg
(95% correctly guessed by both) ketamine doses, but not for
the 0.1 mg/kg (50%, 56%, respectively) and 0.2 mg/kg
doses (55%, 45%, respectively). Assignment to placebo was
guessed correctly 42% by clinicians
and 37% by
participants.

Supplementary Table 2 provides a list of spontaneously
reported AEs divided among the ﬁve groups. When the
four ketamine groups were combined and compared to the
active placebo midazolam (Supplementary Table 3), there
were no signiﬁcant differences in rates of any of AEs.
However, there were higher rates of speciﬁc AEs in the
ketamine-treated patients compared to those treated with
the active placebo midazolam: headache (11.3% vs. 0%),
nausea (10% vs. 0%), vomiting (5% vs. 0%), and
depression (3.8% vs. 0%). Of note, spontaneously repor-
ted suicidal ideation was reported by 2 of the ketamine-
treated patients, but none of the active placebo-treated
patients. On the other hand, the C-SSRS scores during
treatment (see Supplementary Table 4) indicated non-
signiﬁcantly higher rates of wishing to be dead, non-
speciﬁc active suicidal
thoughts, and active suicidal
ideation without intent to act on active placebo (mid-
azolam) than ketamine.

Abnormally high hepatic chemistry values occurred in
one patient (0.2 mg/kg ketamine) during his early termina-
tion visit
(1.7 mg/dL total bilirubin, 47 IU/L aspartate
transaminase, 103 IU/L alanine transaminase).

Blood pressure measurements above the cut-off values
were rare during the medication infusion process, with
systolic blood pressure of ≥155 being observed in 3.8% of
the 1050 total observations, and diastolic blood pressure of
≥99 being observed in 1.2% of the observations. High
systolic blood pressure readings occurred in a total of 21
participants, all of whom were in the ketamine groups. Prior
to infusion, systolic blood pressure ≥155 was recorded in 2
patients, during infusion in 16 patients, and immediately
following infusion in 8 patients. High diastolic blood
pressure readings occurred in a total of 10 participants, all
of whom were in the ketamine groups. Prior to infusion,
diastolic blood pressure ≥99 was recorded in 1 patient,

1600

during infusion in 5 patients, and immediately following
infusion in 5 patients. An examination of average blood
pressure values over
time (as averaged within phase)
showed a phase × group interaction effect for both systolic
(F(8, 94) = 11.14, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure
(F(8, 94) = 8.97, p < 0.001). These effects were driven by
mean level differences during the infusion phase, where
blood pressure values were higher in the ketamine 0.5 and
1.0 mg/kg groups compared to the active placebo mid-
azolam, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Exam-
inations of the group means during the infusion process
suggest a dose–response relationship, with increasingly
higher blood pressure values, for systolic and diastolic,
occurring in groups with increasingly higher ketamine
dosages.

There was one serious adverse event that occurred during
the trial. The participant attempted suicide by overdosing on
day 11 and was subsequently evaluated by the study team
and sent to the emergency room. The patient had received
ketamine 0.2 mg/kg during the study.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed to assess the extent to which a broad
range of subanesthetic IV ketamine doses were superior to
active placebo (midazolam) therapy in the acute (72 h)
treatment of TRD patients, when added to stable anti-
depressant
therapy. The overall group × time interaction
effect was signiﬁcant for the primary outcome measure, the
HAM-D-6. In post hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for
multiple comparisons, standard dose (0.5 mg/kg) and high
dose (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to
active placebo; a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was signiﬁcant only
prior to adjustment (p = 0.02, p-adj = 0.14, d = −0.82 at
day 1). Most of the interaction effect was due to differences
at day 1. Our results suggest that there is evidence for the
antidepressant efﬁcacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg
subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or con-
sistent evidence for clinically meaningful efﬁcacy of lower
doses of IV ketamine. The fact that the lowest dose of IV
ketamine (0.1 mg/kg), which was no different from the
active placebo in terms of blood pressure elevation and
dissociative symptoms, was signiﬁcantly more effective
than active placebo prior to adjustment suggests that its
effects were not enhanced because of functional unblinding.
In fact, both clinicians and patients guessed correctly the
assignment to ketamine 0.1 mg/kg only about half of the
time (despite the fact that the probability of being assigned
to ketamine was 80%), whereas the assignment to ketamine
0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg was guessed correctly almost all the
time, suggesting the possibility of unblinding for those
higher doses.

There was a clear dose–response curve with respect to
dissociative symptoms, as measured by the CADSS. At
40 min after the infusion start, both 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg
doses had signiﬁcantly greater CADSS scores than active
placebo; this signiﬁcant difference was not seen with the
lower ketamine doses. Notably, there were no statistically
signiﬁcant correlations between changes in CADSS scores
40 min after the infusion and HAM-D-6 scores at Day 1 and
Day 3, in contrast to the hypothesis by Luckenbaugh et al.
[32]. Although rates of spontaneously reported AEs were
not signiﬁcantly different between ketamine-treated patients
and active placebo patients, the elevated CADSS scores
suggest the possibility of unblinding at the higher doses and
may contribute to the numerically greater efﬁcacy of
0.5 mg/kg of ketamine compared to 0.1 mg/kg. However, it
does not explain the 0.5 mg/kg dose consistently having the
highest numeric effect over the 1.0 mg/kg dose. Regarding
blood pressure, the lowest ketamine dose (0.1 mg/kg) was
less likely than the standard and high ketamine doses to lead
to blood pressure elevations.

The dose of 0.2 mg/kg of ketamine, which was found to
be effective in a recent trial [33], did not perform as well as
the other doses, and this may be due simply to the relatively
small sample sizes of each treatment group and perhaps to
the fact that, on average, the 0.2 mg/kg group was more
treatment resistant, as it had a history of one extra failed trial
of antidepressants compared to the 0.5 mg/kg group.

Our longitudinal follow-up over 30 days shows that there
is a prominent and rapid loss of efﬁcacy for the single IV
ketamine administration shortly after the day 3 timepoint,
with little evidence of meaningful therapeutic beneﬁt for
most drug doses after day 5. Interestingly, there is a sug-
gestion of greater sustained drug effect at the 1.0 mg/kg
dose as far out as days 15–30, although the effect is rather
modest. This unique ﬁnding is something that should be
examined in future studies.

When the four ketamine groups were collapsed into one
group and compared to active placebo (midazolam), there
were no signiﬁcant differences in rates of any of AEs.
However, there were numerically higher rates of headache,
nausea, vomiting, and depression among ketamine-treated
ideation was
patients. Of note, emergence of suicidal
spontaneously reported by two of the ketamine-treated
patients, but none of the active placebo-treated patients. On
the other hand, the C-SSRS scores during treatment indi-
cated non-signiﬁcantly higher rates of wishing to be dead,
non-speciﬁc active suicidal thoughts, and active suicidal
ideation without intent to act on active placebo (midazolam)
than on ketamine.

A methodological strength of our study was the use of an
active placebo and of blinded, remote raters for the primary
outcome efﬁcacy ratings. However, it is possible that there
may have been functional unblinding of the treatment arms

to both the clinicians and subjects, especially with the 0.5
mg/kg and 1 mg/kg dose groups. This may have contributed
to the results. Another limitation of our study was that each
treatment group had a relatively small sample size (range of
18–22 patients per treatment arm) and the corresponding
conﬁdence intervals around our estimates of effect sizes for
each dose are quite large [34], discouraging in-depth
interpretation of observed small differences. In addition,
the results may have been confounded by the variability in
the degree of responsiveness to ketamine across the treat-
ment groups, as suggested by Loo et al. [14]. Finally, our
study cannot answer the question of whether raising doses
in poor responders to the standard dose of 0.5 g/kg of
ketamine is helpful and tolerated, or if lower doses are
effective in patients who cannot tolerate the standard keta-
mine dose of 0.5 mg/kg.
