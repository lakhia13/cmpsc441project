including psilocybin,
Psychotherapy with the use of psychedelic substances,
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ketamine, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine
(MDMA), has demonstrated promise in treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), anxiety, addiction, and treatment-resistant depression. Psychedelic-assisted
psychotherapy (PP) represents a unique psychopharmacological model that leverages
the profound effects of the psychedelic experience. That experience is characterized
by strong dependency on two key factors: participant mindset and the therapeutic
environment. As such, therapeutic models that utilize psychedelics reﬂect the need
for careful design that promotes an open, ﬂexible, trusting mindset and a supportive
setting. To meet this need, the PP model
is increasingly supplemented by auxiliary
methods, including meditation, relaxation, visualization or spiritual practices. We suggest
virtual reality (VR) as a full-spectrum tool able to capitalize on and catalyze the innately
therapeutic aspects of the psychedelic experience, such as detachment from familiar
reality, alteration of self-experience, augmentation of sensory perception and induction
of mystical-type experiences. This is facilitated by VR’s evidenced capacity to: aid
relaxation and reduce anxiety; buffer from external stimuli; promote a mindful presence;
train the mind to achieve altered states of consciousness (ASC); evoke mystical
states; enhance therapeutic alliance and encourage self-efﬁcacy. While these unique
VR features appear promising, VR’s potential role in PP remains speculative due to
lack of empirical evidence on the combined use of VR and PP. Given the increased
commercial interest in this synergy there is an urgent need to evaluate this approach. We
suggest speciﬁc VR models and their role within PP protocols to inspire future direction
in scientiﬁc research, and provide a list of potential disadvantages, side effects and
limitations that need to be carefully considered. These include sensory overstimulation,
cyber-sickness, triggering memories of past traumatic events as well as distracting from
the inner experience or strongly inﬂuencing its contents. A balanced, evidence-based
approach may provide continuity across all phases of treatment, support transition into
and out of an ASC, deepen acute ASC experiences including mystical states and enrich
the psychotherapeutic process of integration. We conclude that the potential application
of VR in modulating psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy demands further exploration
and an evidence-based approach to both design and implementation.

Treatment Using Psychedelics
Classic
N,N-
dimethyltryptamine (DMT) or lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide
as
(LSD),
3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine
ketamine,
have a long history of medicinal use (Carod-Artal, 2015; Nichols,
2016). The past 10-years has seen a resurgence in the use of and
research into the potential therapeutic beneﬁts of psychedelic
compounds (Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Psychedelics
have primarily been examined as aids to psychotherapy in the
treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (Mithoefer et al.,
treatment-resistant depression (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2019),
2021), and substance dependence (DiVito and Leger, 2020).
Controlled administration of psychedelics can be a tool for
facilitating psycho-behavioral change (Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014,
2016; Barrett and Griﬃths, 2017) and lead to marked, rapid,
and enduring beneﬁts in both healthy volunteers and patient
populations, particularly when accompanied by a supportive
context (e.g., psychological support; Luoma et al., 2020).

The impact of psychedelics upon aspects of mental health and
well-being have been attributed to the phenomenological features
of the psychedelic experience, in particular peak or mystical states
(Griﬃths et al., 2006). Those phenomenological features as well
as the depth of the mystical experience (ME) are aﬀected by
the type of psychedelic drug, dosage, the environment in which
it is administered, and participant’s individual predispositions,
in particular their openness to the experience (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2018). These features, along with the degree to which the
psychedelic experience is integrated into the participant’s psyche,
are thought to regulate the therapeutic outcomes and emergence
of any persisting, positive changes in attitudes and behavior
(Haijen et al., 2018).

Limitations of Psychedelic-Assisted
Psychotherapy
Studies on Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy (PP) are yet to
systematically evaluate the role of context. Whilst it remains
unclear what the most favorable contextual elements are, both
personal consumption and psychedelic retreats favor nature-
immersion models (Kettner et al., 2021; Ruﬀell et al., 2021),
that were promoted by early researchers in the ﬁeld (Hofmann
and Ott, 1980), in contrast to clinical settings in use today.
Nature-immersion models aim to maintain a continuous, relaxed,
multi-sensory engagement throughout the psychedelic journey
(Shanon, 2002; Winkelman, 2021). The clinical approach, largely
due to logistical limitations, departed from this model, resulting
in segmentation into distinct, separate phases of treatment
(preparation, dosing, and integration), which could impede
a ﬂuid transition throughout PP. Moreover, although study
methods in clinical or research settings are carefully designed
in accordance with principles of the set and setting protocol
(Johnson et al., 2008; Hartogsohn, 2017), there is often a lack
of congruence between the dosing session, and the preparation
and integration sessions (Griﬃths et al., 2016). Within individual

trials, preparation and integration phases may be based on
diverse psycho-therapeutic frameworks, including the change of
the role of the therapist from that of supporting facilitator to
that of psychotherapy provider (Johnson et al., 2014) or the
involvement of diﬀerent therapists (Fuentes et al., 2020). This
discontinuity is further perpetuated by diﬀerent phases taking
place in diﬀerent environments (e.g., Griﬃths et al., 2016) and
the variable use of diverse aids, particularly music, which plays
a critical role throughout the dosing session but is not always
formally utilized during integration sessions (Kaelen et al., 2018).
Moreover, profound psychedelic experiences present challenges
for the process of integration, due to their ineﬀable nature
(Neitzke-Spruill, 2019), impaired perception of time (Wittmann
et al., 2007; Wackermann et al., 2008; Yanakieva et al., 2019),
the vast number of thoughts experienced (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2016), overwhelming emotions (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al., 1998)
and impaired recall even shortly after (Barrett et al., 2018; Doss
et al., 2018b). This recall may be further impacted by an internal
resistance to reliving challenging or highly emotionally loaded
experiences in the absence of the psychoactive substance. It is
also recognized that traditional psychotherapeutic approaches
may not be best suited to therapeutic modalities that depend
on intentional induction of a psychedelic-like state. Previously
auxiliary practices such as somatic therapy, breathwork or
mindfulness, are increasingly moved to the forefront of the
therapeutic process (Payne et al., 2021).

Considering that each phase of treatment impacts the course
and the outcome of PP, the lack of congruence throughout
treatment (e.g., Carhart-Harris et al., 2018), could be postulated
as a causative factor in reported psychological side eﬀects
such as paranoia or violent urges (e.g., Studerus et al., 2011;
Johnstad, 2021) and waning of positive outcomes with time
(e.g., Bogenschutz et al., 2015). It is argued that adopting a
more uniﬁed structure, ensuring perceived continuity across all
phases of treatment, could minimize psychological side eﬀects
and sustain positive outcomes of PP for longer. A more congruent
design is also expected to encourage an overlooked phase of the
psychedelic journey, which may follow the integration phase: self-
practice. A clear, uninterrupted structure of PP paves the path for
participants to continue integration privately, at their own pace,
for as long as it is of beneﬁt to them.

Virtual Reality Therapy
The psychedelic state is characterized by a non-ordinary
experience of consciousness, which involves subjective changes
of attention, awareness and/or aﬀect. Therapeutic applications
of non-ordinary states that are similar to those induced
pharmacologically with psychedelic drugs, can also be evoked
physically (e.g., through shamanic dance; Lee et al., 2016),
psychologically (e.g., through meditation; Hanley et al., 2018),
or through sensory stimulation (e.g.,
light ﬂicker; Bartossek
et al., 2021). Virtual Reality (VR) has also emerged in recent
times as having the capacity to disrupt the rigidity of typical
conscious experience (Glowacki et al., 2020). Typically, this
involves providing speciﬁcally designed visual content, viewed
by a participant through a head-mounted display, which may
also include auditory components and less frequently other

sensory input such as haptic feedback (Repetto et al., 2009; Le
May et al., 2021). In this way, VR can be used to alter the
sensory experience of users, including evoking particular mental
states and emotional responses, for example the sense of awe
(Stepanova et al., 2019). It is also possible to simulate visual
hallucinatory experiences (Suzuki et al., 2017). VR’s capacity
to transiently alter a participant’s perspective and disrupt the
rigid patterns of mental experience has also found application
in the treatment of a variety of mood disorders, often alongside
traditional therapies (Fernández-Caballero et al., 2017).

Virtual reality experiences are characterized by several distinct
features, which have been evidenced to confer substantial
beneﬁts to patients undergoing various forms of psychotherapy
(e.g., Boeldt et al., 2019), including augmentation of the sense
of presence in exposure treatment (e.g., Rothbaum et al.,
2001) and acute stress relief in treatment of anxiety (Tarrant
et al., 2018; Donnelly et al., 2021). VR’s capacity to distract
from external cues has been utilized in pain reduction, both
to pharmacotherapy, most commonly with
as an adjunct
opioids (Das et al., 2005), and as its replacement (Schmitt
et al., 2011). VR exposure therapy has also been explored in
combination with other pharmaceuticals, including cortisol in
treatment of acrophobia (Dominique et al., 2011), cognitive
enhancers (yohimbine hydrochloride) in treatment of aerophobia
(Meyerbroeker et al., 2012) and antidepressants (paroxetine or
venlafaxine) in treatment of agoraphobia (Castro et al., 2014).

Whilst

these two diﬀerent

therapeutic approaches have
developed separately, but in parallel, consideration has recently
been given to a composite approach in order to enhance eﬃcacy
(Moroz and Carhart-Harris, 2018). For example, it has been
suggested that VR might be used to optimize the environment
in psychedelic sessions (Aday et al., 2020). Despite the growing
interest in combining VR and psychedelics, which is emerging
predominantly within the commercial industry, there are no
experimental studies to date which investigate this combined
approach. Nonetheless, a large body of research on VR and
the growing body of research on therapeutic application of
psychedelics allow for a theoretical, speculative investigation
of the features of VR that are relevant to an altered state of
consciousness associated with psychedelic use. Here, unique
features of VR and their functional relationship with psychedelics
are discussed, followed by a theoretical exploration of the range of
synergistic outcomes that could be expected from simultaneous
application of VR therapy and PP. To encourage an empirical
exploration, we provide speciﬁc examples of VR models that
could be integrated into various PP protocols, considering
potential advantages against substantial limitations and possible
disadvantages of this synergistic approach.

FEATURES OF VIRTUAL REALITY
RELEVANT TO PSYCHEDELICS

Relaxation
Treatments of aﬀective disorders
(e.g., PTSD, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, addiction) frequently involve relaxation
methods for their signiﬁcant beneﬁts in reducing anxiety and

depression symptoms (León-Pizarro et al., 2007; Manzoni
et al., 2008),
improving physiological markers of the stress
response (Esch et al., 2003) and decreasing physical discomfort
(León-Pizarro et al., 2007). Relaxation techniques have also been
observed to increase patients’ willingness to continue treatment
(Pasyar et al., 2015; Ream et al., 2021) and to ensure extension of
treatment beneﬁts long term (Libo and Arnold, 1983).

A state of relaxation before psychedelic drug administration
is one of
the main predictors of positive self-dissolution
(Dittrich, 1998), underscoring the importance of methods and
environments that promote a relaxed mindset before and during
psychedelic treatment. Despite the common use of mindfulness,
breathwork or visualization techniques during PP (Watts and
Luoma, 2020), stress and anxiety before or during dosing
remain one of the most commonly reported undesired eﬀects
associated with psychedelic use in recreational and therapeutic
settings (Griﬃths et al., 2006; Studerus et al., 2011; Bienemann
et al., 2020). This points to the need for more reliable
relaxation methods for PP.

A recent meta-analysis showed that a wide range of VR
interventions, in particular when using nature-based audio-visual
stimuli, reliably facilitate a state of relaxation (Riches et al.,
2021), highlighting VR’s potential for use in conjunction with
psychedelic therapy, which can be viewed as challenging by some
clients. Although sustained, long term eﬀects of VR relaxation
interventions are yet to be ascertained (Riches et al., 2021),
VR-based relaxation sessions commonly precede VR exposure
treatment (Repetto et al., 2013; Son et al., 2015) due to recognized
beneﬁts of VR in acutely reducing distress symptoms associated
with anticipation of a stressful or emotionally challenging
event (Maples-Keller et al., 2017). VR has also been shown to
outperform a diverse range of control conditions as a stress
relief intervention in acute settings, including desktop-based
relaxation interventions (Liszio et al., 2018), guided meditation
and progressive relaxation exercises (Veling et al., 2021). Those
results indicate that VR may be suitable to promote the state
of relaxation during psychedelic treatment if applied prior to
psychedelic exposure, and to relieve stress acutely if it arises
during the session.

Buffering
The eﬃcacy of VR as a mental health treatment modality can
be partially attributed to its capacity to act as an “immersive
distractor” (Le May et al., 2021). This ability to detach the
participant from other sensory experiences could explain, for
example, why VR leads to signiﬁcant alleviation of pain in acute
(Hoﬀman et al., 2008; Maani et al., 2011) and chronic conditions
(Schmitt et al., 2011). Therefore, whilst VR is recognized
predominantly for its ability to provide sensory stimulation,
its therapeutic utility appears to be equally dependent on its
ability to subtract it.

Virtual Reality and Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy

although blindfolds only allow limited, binary control over
environmental stimuli (no visual stimuli vs. complete visual
stimuli). Moreover, despite recognition of the importance of
environmental design in curating the psychedelic experience,
studies that utilize psychedelic substances rarely exploit the
to create a distinction
potential of using the environment
between the day-to-day and the ethereal (Fuentes et al., 2020).
Clinical and retreat environments are ﬁlled with familiar, even
domestic cues, which may keep the attention rooted in the
mundane, hijacking the experience instead of inspiring deeper
emotional processes (Hartogsohn, 2017). What is more, those
cues are likely to be perceived diﬀerently by the therapist and
the patient who is under the eﬀects of a psychedelic, forming a
wedge in perceptual congruence and in turn perhaps, a barrier to
therapeutic alliance. Finally, current approaches to setting design
have not seen major innovation since the earliest psychedelic
trials (Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1979).

In contrast to the current binary approach, VR allows ﬁne
control over the context and richness of stimuli that is provided.
The virtual world can reduce distraction from the real world
by replacing familiar cues with unfamiliar, fantastical objects
and symbols (Quesnel and Riecke, 2018), that are conducive of
deep immersion into the psychedelic experience (Glowacki et al.,
2020). VR can therefore be used to transport the user out of
the treatment environment and into an alternate reality, acting
as a buﬀer zone, which is equally novel for both therapist and
participant, facilitating awareness of the immediate experience in
a more mindful way.

Mindful Presence
The intensity of
the psychedelic experience, especially the
experience of ego dissolution, can sometimes prove diﬃcult and
patients may resist the eﬀects or attempt to temper them, for
example by using engagement with the therapist as a distraction
(Bourzat and Hunter, 2019). On the other hand, staying engaged
despite the discomfort and surrendering to experiences that are
challenging seems to have a beneﬁcial impact on therapeutic
outcomes (Johnstad, 2021). The capacity to stay engaged with a
challenging sensation may be strengthened by learning to deepen
the sense of presence without judgment, a skill that is commonly
practiced by mindfulness meditators (Baer, 2015).

Mindfulness meditation is a technique that aims to expand
the sense of awareness of diverse physiological and psychological
sensations, without assessment or attachment to any of them
(Kabat-Zinn, 2009). When used in combination with psilocybin,
mindfulness practice has led to a deepening of
the acute
psychedelic experience, in particular a stronger sense of unity,
bliss and spirituality (Smigielski et al., 2019a) and facilitated
including positive changes in
lasting therapeutic outcomes,
psycho-social
functioning (Griﬃths et al., 2018; Smigielski
et al., 2019b). Nonetheless, mindfulness is a challenging practice
that requires time and commitment, and clients may still be
unsuccessful in reaching the mindful state even when both are
abundant (Hunt et al., 2020).

Mindfulness interventions are gaining increasing popularity
among psychedelic practitioners (Payne et al., 2021) and VR has
proven successful in helping people engage with mindfulness

as well as reach the meditative state (Perhakaran et al., 2016;
Seabrook et al., 2020). VR-based meditation interventions lead
to a deep state of mindfulness, that has been reﬂected in
changes of EEG patterns indicative of a relaxed, meditative
state. Those changes, for example a shift of high to low beta
frequencies and reduced beta activity in anterior cingulate
cortex (Tarrant et al., 2018), were not observed in control
conditions such as guided audio meditation (Yildirim and
O’Grady, 2020). Signiﬁcant increase in state mindfulness and
positive aﬀect have also been observed following VR mindfulness
sessions in both clinical (Navarro-Haro et al., 2019) and non-
clinical settings, making it suitable for all types of therapeutic
environments that employ psychedelic substances. Technology
could help mitigate the main barriers to drawing beneﬁts from
a mindful attitude in psychedelic treatment, predominantly the
discouragement caused by uncertainty of achieving suﬃcient
depth of mindfulness, and the need for often unrealistically
lengthy, challenging training.

Augmenting Peak States
In approaching the psychedelic experience, a relaxed, mindful
mindset has been observed to reduce the likelihood of adverse
psychological events (Johnson et al., 2008) and is conducive
to producing a mystical experience (Smigielski et al., 2019a).
The depth of the ME, commonly measured by the mystical
experiences questionnaire (MEQ30), is one of the key predictors
of positive outcomes following psychedelic psychotherapy (e.g.,
Garcia-Romeu et al., 2014),
including a decrease of clinical
symptoms and lasting improvements in well-being (Haijen et al.,
2018). Although the nature of the ME remains enigmatic,
researchers have managed to identify certain phenomenological
characteristics, or dimensions, of those experiences that resonate
with the majority of participants (Barrett and Griﬃths, 2017).
These include:
the sense of awe, unity and sacredness;
timelessness and spacelessness; ineﬀability; as well as a sense of
authenticity and validity of the reality that is being witnessed,
despite its unrecognizable, sometimes even bizarre makeup
(Hood, 2001; MacLean et al., 2012).

Highly immersive VR experiences also demonstrate some
of those same, unique characteristics. The loss of sense of
space, time and even connection to one’s body is a commonly
reported phenomenon (Seabrook et al., 2020). Patients tend to
lose points of reference with reality, which seems to engage them
in the process of contemplation and introspection (Seabrook
et al., 2020). The resultant absorption into VR can counteract
reality-testing mechanisms, tricking our senses into making a
surreal scenario appear real (Suzuki et al., 2017). Witnessing and
believing this alternative reality can lead to a sense of surrender
(Seabrook et al., 2020), resulting in a level of engagement with
VR scenarios, which can be stronger than that with the real world
(Kotler and Wheal, 2017). Additionally, the experience of an
alternative reality can also be ineﬀable (Glowacki et al., 2020).

Virtual reality-induced awe also appears to share functional
(Hendricks,
characteristics with psychedelic mechanisms
2018). Recent ﬁndings on phenomenological aspects of awe
distinguished between the immediately available but
less
impactful “quick boiled awe,” and the deeper, if more diﬃcult

to achieve, “slow simmer awe” (Chirico and Gaggioli, 2018).
VR-based experiential approach allows for eliciting the latter,
more intense form (Gallagher et al., 2015; Chirico et al., 2016,
2017), which has also been proposed as a putative mechanism
of psychedelic eﬀects (Hendricks, 2018). VR, in evoking the
challenging, destabilizing and deep sensations associated with
awe, could act as a medium for a self-transcendental experience
(Chirico and Gaggioli, 2018).

Although psychedelic compounds have been used historically
and in the present to successfully evoke MEs (Griﬃths et al., 2006)
and emerging evidence shows that VR can also be successful in
eliciting such mystical-type experiences (Glowacki et al., 2020),
little empirical work has been performed on joint application
of both methods acting synergistically to deepen the mystical
state. Psychedelics have previously been combined with a range
of other state altering methods, in order to deepen the ME,
for example via the use of LSD with sensory deprivation (Lilly,
1990), psilocybin with meditation (Smigielski et al., 2019a,b), or
hallucinogenic Datura plant with trance inducing dance practices
(Du Toit, 1977). Results of those studies suggest that combining
diﬀerent ego-dissolving or awe-inspiring practices may lead to
an augmented, cumulative eﬀect in producing a more “complete
mystical experience” or “complete ego dissolution,” which are
known to play an important role in the healing process (Haijen
et al., 2018). Given the wide range of shared properties that are
relevant to evoking a ME, the pairing of VR and psychedelics
presents itself as a promising candidate for further exploration
of this capacity for augmentation.

Altered States of Consciousness Priming
MEs are preceded and facilitated by unique changes
in
consciousness that are often referred to in literature as altered
states of consciousness (ASC; Vaitl et al., 2005). An ASC is
a phenomenological experience characterized by changes in
perception of time, space and even oneself, accompanied by
a non-ordinary range of attention, awareness and emotion
(Ludwig, 1966). Here we refer to ASCs that are subjectively
experienced as a form of expansion or transcendence of
normal, wakeful consciousness, and are purposefully induced
by a consumption of a psychedelic compound (Metzner, 1994),
and also, although less reliably, through meditation (Shapiro,
2009; Stapleton et al., 2020), trance (Glicksohn and Ohana,
2011), or practices that induce ﬂow states (Csikszentmihalyi and
Nakamura, 2018), among others.

Interestingly, evidence suggests that the ability to achieve an
altered state of consciousness can be improved through practice
(Kotler and Wheal, 2017). Brain imaging outcomes revealed
that experienced meditators exhibit better control over their
attentional resources (Farb et al., 2007; Hasenkamp and Barsalou,
2012). This has been attributed to lasting changes in functional
connectivity between brain regions responsible for attention and
self-awareness (e.g., between the right insula and the prefrontal
cortex) that seem to be the result of mindfulness practice (Farb
et al., 2007; Hasenkamp and Barsalou, 2012). More experienced
meditators are also more likely to experience ego dissolution,
which is a hallmark of high dose psychedelic experiences (Hölzel
and Ott, 2006; MacLean et al., 2012). What is more, practicing

the ability to attain an ASC seems to be translational across
diﬀerent techniques. This is exploited, for example, in the training
of American Navy SEALs, who practice common ASC methods
(meditation, sensory deprivation, or trance) to optimize their
ability to enter a state of ﬂow during missions (Kotler and Wheal,
2017). In a similar way, prior mindfulness meditation practice
signiﬁcantly increases the depth of the ME induced by psilocybin,
particularly the dimensions of introvertive mysticism and oceanic
boundlessness (Smigielski et al., 2019a), and increases positive
emotions associated with psilocybin-occasioned ego-dissolution.
Finally, the incidence and the intensity of ME have been shown
to be inﬂuenced by a clear intention for a mystical or a spiritual
experience; this intention can be strengthened with practice
(MacLean et al., 2011; Haijen et al., 2018).

The previously presented evidence suggests that practicing
the ability to achieve an ASC using one method may increase
the capacity for achieving it with other methods. Since early
on in its inception, VR has been recognized as a tool capable
of eliciting ASCs (Glicksohn and Avnon, 1997), and has been
used extensively in the entertainment industry to produce an
entire range of ASCs (Weinel, 2018). Moreover, VR has already
been highly successful in facilitating other therapies that entail
the production of ASC, for example meditation (Perhakaran
et al., 2016; Seabrook et al., 2020). Research has also shown
that VR can be used to induce visual alterations that closely
resemble those brought on by classical psychedelics (Suzuki
et al., 2017). It has been suggested that using VR to prepare
clients for perceptual alterations induced by psychedelics may
have beneﬁcial eﬀects on their expectation of hallucination eﬀects
and on pre-trip anxiety (Aday et al., 2020). By providing a
comfortable, reliable and potent rehearsal space, VR can equip
clients with a sense of awareness of initiating and engaging
with an ASC, encouraging a more complete surrender to and
exploration of the psychedelic state.

Therapeutic Alliance
A comfortable and productive relationship between the client
and the therapist, known as positive therapeutic alliance,
can account for as much as 30% of the positive outcomes
of psychotherapy (Hubble et al., 1999). Its value may be
even higher for treatments that use psychedelics, due to the
palpable impact that setting (including the therapist) has on
the hallucinogenic experience (Johnson et al., 2008). Current
manuals for psychedelic practitioners agree that establishing
successful rapport is the therapist’s primary responsibility (Guss
et al., 2020). Moreover, it is essential for that rapport to be
established collaboratively (Greer and Tolbert, 1998). Conversely,
inadequate therapeutic alliance has been suggested as one of the
important factors in participants’ poor response to psychedelic-
based treatment (Nielson and Guss, 2018) and may increase the
likelihood of adverse psychological reactions during the dosing
session (Johnson et al., 2008).

2008) and satisfaction rates (Beck et al., 2007; Baños et al.,
2009) across various therapeutic approaches. Relaxing VR
environments reinforce patient involvement in treatment and
increase positive rapport (Boeldt et al., 2019). VR is especially
eﬀective in facilitating a sense of safety and trust among the
most traumatized or apprehensive patients, who tend to choose
VR over talking to a counselor in person in order to work
through their traumatic experiences (Garcia-Palacios et al.,
2007; Wilson et al., 2008). Lastly, VR scenarios can be designed,
by way of interactivity, to give patients an element of control
and ownership over their surroundings, and as a result a sense
of agency within the experience (Ewalt, 2018). The resultant
collaborative exploration of this alternative world may be able to
foster a better sense of equality by disrupting the therapist-patient
hierarchy (Wrzesien et al., 2011).

Self-Efﬁcacy
One of the key roles of preparation sessions in PP is to promote
a non-avoidant attitude, particularly to challenging components
of the psychedelic experience (Mithoefer et al., 2008; Davis
et al., 2020). A mindset that welcomes challenging thoughts and
emotions, rather than avoiding them, determines the depth of the
psychedelic experience and subsequently its therapeutic impact
(Studerus et al., 2011; Carbonaro et al., 2016; Haijen et al., 2018;
Roseman et al., 2018).

VR has been shown to help patients overcome the fear of
sharing their deepest, most disturbing thoughts, even when
they are unwilling to discuss them directly with their therapist
(Maples-Keller et al., 2017; Prudenzi et al., 2019). Following a
single VR thought-defusion session, clients reported signiﬁcant
improvement in negativity, conviction and discomfort related
to a patient-speciﬁc disturbing thought (Prudenzi et al., 2019).
VR therapies are also thought to facilitate an increase in self-
eﬃcacy and a decrease in negative self-statements (Meyerbröker
and Emmelkamp, 2008), giving patients a sense of agency in
coping with negative self-referential thoughts. As such, VR can
be used during the preparation phase to strengthen self-eﬃcacy
in confronting diﬃcult thoughts or emotions (Premkumar et al.,
2021), thus promoting the ability to surrender to challenging
experiences as they occur.

MODELS OF INCORPORATING VIRTUAL
REALITY INTO
PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED
PSYCHOTHERAPY

Based on the presented parallels in functional properties of VR
and psychedelics, we suggest potential methods of VR application
in a PP protocol, which fall into four categories: expansion,
transition, cohesion and rescue.

Firstly, adequate preparation preceding the psychedelic
experience is necessary to solidify intention for the upcoming
psychedelic journey and prepare clients for unusual psycho-
emotional or bodily sensations that may occur (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2018). While those sensations are often discussed
during preparation sessions, current protocols have limited
means of meeting the need for experiential exploration
(Guss et al., 2020). To bridge this gap, VR scenarios can be
used to practice an ability to achieve an ASC and promote
a sense of ease around obtaining and experiencing those
states,
limited to perceptual alterations
(Suzuki et al., 2017). Additionally, VR has been shown to be
highly eﬀective in optimizing psycho-emotional processes
that also play a role in the phenomenology of the psychedelic
state, such as psychological ﬂexibility (Davis et al., 2020;
for example
Pinilla et al., 2020; Watts and Luoma, 2020),

(Cavazza et al., 2014). By repeatedly inducing meditative-like
or psychedelic-like states during the preparation phase, for
example with hypnotic audiovisual elements or a visually
engaging guided meditation program, VR can be utilized to
prime occurrences of expanded states of consciousness prior to
dosing. After a more relaxed, contemplative or non-ordinary
state is reached, VR scenarios can facilitate psychological
ﬂexibility training, for example by defusing abstract thought
representations of patient-identiﬁed barriers,

Secondly, the depth and the content of the acute psychedelic
experience during the dosing session is of particular importance
to the outcomes of therapy (Studerus et al., 2011). When
profoundly meaningful, those experiences have been reported
to be one of the most or the single most inﬂuential experience
of one’s life (Griﬃths et al., 2006), and have been proposed to
have the potential to lead to pivotal changes in one’s feelings,
attitudes, behaviors and even personality traits (Brouwer and
Carhart-Harris, 2021). Given that psychedelic eﬀects display a
remarkable response to external triggers (Kaelen et al., 2018),
a supportive, spiritual, or inspiring setting is far more likely
to encourage a ME than clinical or laboratory environments
(Strassman, 2000; Hartogsohn, 2017). Sensory stimulation with
music has also been shown to be capable of evoking meaningful
therapeutic experiences during dosing (Kaelen, 2017). The
most eﬀective auditory stimuli during the peak phase of the
psychedelic experience have been described as homogeneous,
with static dynamics, unrecognizable instruments, with regular
and consistent phase structure and mostly cyclical compositional
form (Barrett et al., 2017). Given the ability of VR to
create any environment that can be imagined (Quesnel and
Riecke, 2018), its application has unsurprisingly been uniquely

successful at creating immersive mystical, spiritual or awe-
evoking scenarios (Gallagher et al., 2015). Such models could
be harnessed while drug eﬀects last, to construct an optimal
setting that increases the chances of inducing a mystical-type
experience. On the other hand, any setting provided for the
participant during the dosing session may detract from the
innately derived healing pathway or even highjack the experience.
VR may be best introduced in protocols that already rely
on a form of engagement with the external world during
dosing, for example protocols that involve nature immersion
or group interaction. Within such therapeutic frameworks, VR’s
unlimited potential for setting design could be leveraged to
provide unique, awe-evoking models,
for example, of deep
landscapes. These could be
space or unreachable natural
paired with appropriate auditory stimuli, such as solar system
soniﬁcation (Tomlinson et al., 2017) or a recording of ocean
waves (Erich, 2006), thus unifying the visual and auditory
stimuli into a congruent whole. Other designs may include
personally meaningful links to tribal or spiritual practices or
places of worship, paired with, for example, ritualistic shamanic
drumming (Bensimon et al., 2008).

Lastly,

the noetic quality of ASC experiences is often
the
at odds with the familiar sensations characteristic of
normal, wakeful consciousness, and is therefore diﬃcult to
assimilate into daily life (Kotler and Wheal, 2017), posing
a challenge for integration (Guss et al., 2020; Callon et al.,
2021). During acute drug eﬀects, communication, especially
verbal, can be unappealing,
lacking a cohesive narrative, or
functionally impossible (Neitzke-Spruill, 2019). Insights that
appear obvious and profound during the psychedelic state
can also become less clear even shortly after the experience
concludes. The ineﬀable nature of the psychedelic experience
may explain why current integration procedures, where recall
is based largely on verbal exchange with the therapist (White,
2007), ﬁnd themselves limited. Instead, the evidence of beneﬁcial
outcomes of meditation and spiritual practices on outcomes
of PP points to an important role of non-verbal practices in
mediating integration (Cohen, 2017; Smigielski et al., 2019a).
VR presents as a uniquely suited medium to reliably initiate
ASC experiences during the integration process, thus allowing
exploitation of their beneﬁcial characteristics, such as broadened
awareness or mindful presence (McPeake et al., 1991; Vaitl
et al., 2005). If continuity is maintained between VR models
used in conjunction with the psychedelic substance and those
applied during the integration process, VR may also be able to
facilitate greater recall of psychedelic experiences. For example,
if a speciﬁc natural landscape accompanied by appropriately
paired musical sounds (Barrett et al., 2017) is applied during
the dosing session, introduction of that same scenario during
integration may bring back memories, emotions or insights that
were present during the psychedelic experience. Unfortunately,
not all reinforcement of memories is beneﬁcial (Doss et al.,
2018a, 2020) and any stimulus that is used to trigger recall of the
psychedelic experience puts the participant in danger of having
false or negative memories reinforced. Additionally, whilst VR’s
capacity to increase recall can be advantageous, it also means that
extra care is necessary around its application during integration,

to minimize the risk of inducing a vulnerable, challenging or
anxious mindset.

Transition
The eﬀects of most psychedelic drugs do not emerge nor
dissipate rapidly, but rather follow parabolic-like changes in
intensity (Maji´c et al., 2015), starting with a slow onset (pre-
followed by the core of the experience (peak
peak phase),
phase), and ending with a gradual resolution (post-peak phase;
(Fox et al., 2018). A latency period follows consumption of a
psychedelic substance, after which subjective eﬀects begin to
appear, including changes in arousal and perception (Hollister,
1984; Carhart-Harris et al., 2012). Those initial changes may
be stressful or anxiety provoking (Hollister, 1984), prompting
participants to consciously oppose or subconsciously disengage
from deeper immersion into the psychedelic state. This stressful
response, together with disruptions in thought that emerge
during the pre-peak phase, may also lead to loss of cognitive
focus on the intention, which is often essential to reaping full
beneﬁt from the remaining part of the experience (MacLean
et al., 2011; Haijen et al., 2018). It can be argued that with
appropriately designed environments, cues or symbols, VR can
gently nudge the attention back to the intention, for example
by oﬀering a model that centers around a personalized, patient-
designed totem. Such totems can be constructed as a multi-
sensory experience, combining visual and auditory elements that
are personally signiﬁcant in an attempt to activate or intensify
emotions, thoughts and memories. The audiovisual content may
be created to represent a sense of journey, expanding on one
of the primary utilities of music in PP, the provision of a
sense of guidance (Kaelen, 2017). This process of personalization
would play a critical role in accounting for the inter-person
variability in individual intentions and in avoiding misdirecting
the experience. Nonetheless, such explicit representations may
still be inadequate for a construct as ineﬀable as intention.
Therefore, the use of VR during the pre-peak phase may be
best reserved for those struggling to utilize their intention
as guidance, for example participants who resist the eﬀects
of the psychedelic substance or get lost in a cognitive loop.
In such cases, VR also oﬀers mild stimulation to maintain
alertness and keep focus on the present moment (Seabrook
et al., 2020) whilst displacing familiar cues from the treatment
setting, that may be distracting or negatively triggering, thus
supporting the state of relaxation (Seabrook et al., 2020). Thereby,
application of VR during the onset of an ASC can reinforce the
intention and encourage a deeper immersion into the psychedelic
experience among participants who have previously displayed
diﬃculty in this regard.

When the eﬀects of the psychedelic substance begin to wane,
during the so called “resolution period,” psychedelic experiences
still echo vividly whilst patients slowly begin to reconnect with
the external world (Fox et al., 2018). They may begin to vocalize
the contents of their antecedent psychedelic experience in the
process referred to as “the ﬁrst narrative” (Guss et al., 2020),
which is often disordered but revelatory for patients. In some
models of psychotherapy, the ﬁrst narrative is explored freely,
without explicit guidance from the therapist (Mithoefer et al.,

2008; Guss et al., 2020). While holding an open dialogue around
the psychedelic experience may present a challenge for therapists
(Johnson et al., 2008), a large number of patients naturally
gravitate toward VR for its comfortable and less confrontational
nature than face to face therapy (Garrett et al., 2017; Riva et al.,
2019). What is more, VR provides a wide range of expressive tools
to communicate with the therapist, without having to rely on
language (Hacmun et al., 2018; Kaimal et al., 2020). Compared
to traditional, two-dimensional art, creative expression such
as painting, modeling or designing is less inhibited in VR,
challenges familiar modes of perception and activates full sensory
engagement (Kaimal et al., 2019; King et al., 2019). As such,
VR allows a space that can be used to explore and consolidate
psychedelic experiences before they need to be shared, for
example via creating representations of thoughts, insights or
emotions with expressive art tools, personalized spatial design
of the VR model, or intentional use of symbolism. VR could
serve as a physical representation of a memory library, where any
information which seems of importance during the resolution
period is recorded visually or verbally or both. Such VR models
should be personalized and interactive, allow a large degree
of ﬂexibility, and ideally be built up over numerous sessions.
VR may serve as a blank canvas, with a multitude of available
elements that can be used to build personally meaningful
contexts. Audio input could be adapted to channel appropriate
emotional sentiment, for example grief or hope, drawing on
music’s capacity to increase therapeutic engagement by reﬂecting
autobiographical and personally signiﬁcant content (Kaelen,
2017). Such individually designed models can then be utilized
during the integration process, to further explore and discuss
the elements that were already established, while adding new
insights or actionables, expanding and reconﬁguring the memory
library throughout the integration phase. However, any tools used
to deepen the memory of an experience can aﬀect the process
of memory formation and introduce the risk of consolidating a
false narrative (Doss et al., 2018b). Other concerns include the
following: VR may prove overly stimulating and act as a distractor
rather than an aid in recounting or interpreting the ineﬀable
experience; the virtual aesthetic may be at odds with the internal
experience and therefore impair the process of self-discovery;
predetermined VR input may disengage the participant and
deprive the participant of a sense of agency. To mitigate this,
VR scenarios used at this point in the dosing sessions should be
characterized by a large degree of ﬂexibility and responsiveness,
to allow for a participant-driven process of assembling the VR
model from within the VR space. VR may best be treated as
an advanced tool for self-expression, with the immersive world
created by the participant instead of for the participant.

Cohesion
Therapeutic sessions that revolve around the novel and impactful
nature of the psychedelic experience require a clear and receptive
mindset, that is in contrast to the occupied and distracted
character of day to day cognitive functioning (Davis et al., 2020).
Thanks to its unique ability to act as a buﬀering tool and promote
the state of relaxation and mindful presence, VR can aid the
process of transition from daily life to the therapeutic setting

(Chandrasiri et al., 2020; Seabrook et al., 2020; Riches et al., 2021).
Immersive and deeply engaging VR environments isolate one
from the distractions of the external world, promote detachment
from familiar temporal and spatial reference points, and ground
the attention in the here and now (Seabrook et al., 2020).
Additionally, contextually rich models that are created in VR can
be reapplied in precisely the same manner each time (Maples-
Keller et al., 2017), including nuanced factors such as time of day
and natural lighting conditions, that cannot be accounted for in
real-life environments. Through such repeated use, the sense of
presence and relaxation becomes more pronounced and easier
to achieve with each session (PeÒate et al., 2008). Scenarios that
promote relaxation, mindful presence and buﬀering often use
serene man-made spaces (Järvelä et al., 2021), nature immersion
(Liszio et al., 2018), or outer space models (Chirico et al., 2016).
These examples are predominantly non-directive, characterized
by low to medium intensity stimuli, with wide focal points that
require minimal focus. Perceived continuity across phases may
be achieved not only by repeated use of the same scenario, but
also by the way of a continuous theme (e.g., a forest), repetition
of a key object (e.g., a noticeable large oak tree), or the participant
playing a familiar role in each experience (e.g., going on a walk in
the landscape). These familiar, reliable cues can be returned to at
any time (Repetto et al., 2013), also between formal integration
sessions (for example during challenging moments when the
therapist is not immediately available) or once the integration
process concludes, in order to prolong treatment eﬀects via
self-practice. Ideally, VR scenarios used for self-practice should
maintain continuity with VR models used during dosing, whilst
building on the goals of therapy. For example the same scenery
that was applied during dosing, such as a model of a personally
meaningful natural scenery, could be used as a backdrop for
an interactive training program that targets a desired behavioral
change such as attention training (Li et al., 2020). Interestingly,
VR therapies have one of the highest compliance rates (Thielbar
et al., 2020) and can signiﬁcantly improve adherence to other
treatments when used as an adjunct to therapy (Navarro-Haro
et al., 2019), suggesting that incorporating VR into PP protocols
may make participants more willing to continue integration in
the form of self-practice. What is more, VR’s capacity to reduce
physical discomfort and pain (Hoﬀman et al., 2011; Garrett
et al., 2017), and to distract from unwanted symptoms, for
example addiction withdrawal (Goldenhersch et al., 2020), makes
it particularly promising for clients who experience challenging
psychedelic episodes, which may discourage them from revisiting
these during the integration and self-practice sessions. Lastly,
the process of self-practice does not need to be restricted to
the laboratory, clinical or retreat environments (Bell et al.,
2020), allowing a continued integration to take place at a local
VR studio, VR clinic, or even at home, thanks to increasingly
aﬀordable technological advancements in the ﬁeld.

Rescue
Challenging experiences seem to play an important role in the
psychedelic experience (Johnstad, 2021). Immersing in them
instead of avoiding them seems to be the most eﬀective way
to diminish the anxiety or panic that they may otherwise

cause and to extract the maximum beneﬁt from the integration
process (Carbonaro et al., 2016). Conversely, resisting the diﬃcult
experience could obstruct the therapy’s beneﬁcial eﬀects, impact
the resolution of the issue and catalyze the progression from a
challenging experience to an adverse eﬀect (Vollenweider and
Kometer, 2010). Therapists face diﬃculty in distinguishing when
they should encourage leaning into that challenge, and when it
may become detrimental to the participant and/or the therapist
(Carbonaro et al., 2016). Currently, no tool exists that would
be capable of terminating a potentially adverse progression both
rapidly and transiently. One technique utilized, taking blindfolds
oﬀ and performing relaxation exercises or similar, is a transient
but not a reliable method. On the other hand, pharmacological
interventions, like benzodiazepines, put an end or create an
irreversible disruption to the experience and as a result, any
therapeutic eﬀects (Rey et al., 1999; Lerner et al., 2003; Bounds
and Nelson, 2020).

In situations that impose acute emotional strain, VR is
signiﬁcantly more reliable at overriding stress responses than
current alternative methods, including two-dimensional visual
displays of similar scenarios (e.g., Riches et al., 2021). When
applied during an acutely stressful situation, VR has already been
shown to lead to immediate and signiﬁcant lowering of stress
levels, marked by changes in heart rate variability and cortisol
levels, as well as signiﬁcant improvements in subjective measures
of anxiety and aﬀect (Liszio et al., 2018). The strongly absorbing
nature of immersive VR environments that are designed to act as
an immediate anxiety relief (Valtchanov, 2010; Yu et al., 2020),
oﬀer a competing stimulus (Wiederhold et al., 2014; Nordgård
and Låg, 2021) and may act as a sobering tool during an over-
challenging or otherwise psychologically detrimental psychedelic
experience. Even when not utilized, the knowledge that VR is
available as an immediate rescue tool may act as a safety net for
the participant, aiding the sense of relaxation, trust and surrender
into the experience.

To act as a rescue tool, the VR scenario needs to compete with
the strongly engaging inner experience. Therefore, a rescue VR
tool should be characterized by a very rich contextual design;
immersive sensory stimuli; dynamic, attention-demanding
content and an interactive component, closely resembling
a typical gaming environment. To act in opposition to the
emotionally engaging therapeutic process, the audio content of
a rescue VR scenario should also contrast any musical input
applied up to that point. VR will thus act as a purposeful
distractor from the internal experience, possibly changing the
quality of the experience dramatically and irrevocably. Therefore,
it is critical that the decision to use it is not made lightly.

LIMITATIONS OF VIRTUAL REALITY AND
GUIDELINES FOR SAFETY

Over-Stimulation
Virtual reality allows a wide range of design alternatives,
with an abundance of lights, colors, shapes, motion features
and interactivity options to select from Ewalt (2018). Some
designs can be strongly stimulating, even to the point of

visual discomfort (Saredakis et al., 2020), and the potential
risk of over-stimulation (and in extreme cases, seizures) has
been raised by VR providers (Oculus, 2020). Care needs to
be taken around combining any powerful, external stimulus
with the already intense sensory experiences brought on by
a psychedelic substance. VR content provided to participants
should avoid sudden changes in visual patterns, extremes of
saturation or brilliance and spatial disorientation. Additionally,
although adverse events of VR that involve seizures have not
been documented, even in people with known photosensitive
epilepsy (Tychsen and Thio, 2020), protocols that combine the
use of VR and psychedelics should exclude individuals that may
be at risk of epilepsy, until there is greater understanding of this
potential adverse eﬀect.

Accidental Exposure
A traumatic response can be triggered unexpectedly by any
relevant cue (Van der Kolk, 1998). Highly immersive VR
environments can easily act as a trigger, if their content is
directly related to the traumatic experience (Difede, 2016; Rizzo
et al., 2017), particularly during the vulnerable state induced
by psychedelic substances (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018). Unless
exposure is the intention of treatment, the VR content needs
to be examined for presence of any cues that have personal
resonance or could be associated with traumatic experiences,
both at a generic and individual level. Generically, this should be
achieved by considering and maintaining care around common
triggers, for example heights, dark spaces, narrow or enclosed
spaces, scenarios in or under water, etc. At an individual level,
key triggers need to be discussed with the participant during
preparation and, if possible, the VR scenario should ﬁrst be
examined when sober, if it is later to be used when under the
inﬂuence of the psychedelic substance.

Leading
The expectancy eﬀects associated with psychedelics mean that
selection of VR environments will have a strong impact on
the psychedelic journey (as do environments in the real world;
Carhart-Harris et al., 2018). Therefore,
introducing any VR
input, especially immediately prior to dosing or during the
pre-peak or peak phases, must be treated with utmost care.
A delicate balance needs to be struck between providing
mild stimuli
to block distraction from mundane external
realities and maintaining focus on the intention (guiding),
the experience and dictating
whilst avoiding hijacking of
its content
for
example to strengthen the intention,
if necessary, needs to
be carefully weighed against the risk of overtaking/dictating
the experience completely. As such, VR may be best avoided
as the ﬁrst line of guidance in the particularly vulnerable
parts of
instead, being
better suited for patients who received psychedelic treatment
previously, but gained little beneﬁts from it, or relapsed. Limited
response to PP may be caused by avoidance, anxiety or lack
of clarity around intention (Carbonaro et al., 2016; Davis
et al., 2020), which are the areas of care that VR may be
able to assist with.

Virtual Reality and Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy

Distraction
In many PP protocols, external stimulation during the dosing
session is kept to minimum, and the participant is encouraged
to focus their attention inward, as any sensory input may
cause disruption to the unfolding internal narrative. Therefore,
potential beneﬁts of utilizing VR during dosing, including peak
and post-peak phases, have to be carefully weighed against
potential disadvantages. There is currently no evidence to suggest
that VR may be of added beneﬁt during the peak phase. VR
may be best reserved for the post-peak phase of the experience,
when most of that internal narrative has unfolded. Nonetheless,
it is critical to avoid overly leading this process as an active
engagement with VR may lead to some participants feeling urged
to verbalize their experience before they are ready to do so.
This may lead to vague or even misguided conclusions therefore
the process of recall and sense making should not be rushed.
Additionally, explicit imagery or journey-based scenarios may
replace the internal insights. The use of personalized, patient-
driven design is therefore critical. Lastly, as outlined in the
rescue scenario, interactive VR content is likely to compete with
the eﬀects of the drug and should only be used as a rescue
function. Otherwise, cognitive interaction, for example via task-
oriented activities (da Costa et al., 2021) or physical interaction,
for example via the use of controllers or real-life movement
(Lee et al., 2015), may be best avoided during dosing, as these
may be particularly impactful in distracting from attention to
the internal state. Even in the case of intentional use of VR
as a distracting stimulus, it should not be hastily applied to
“rescue” participants during challenging psychedelic experiences
but should be reserved for when the therapist assessment is of
impending progression to an adverse experience.

Cyber-Sickness and Physical Discomfort
The physical comfort of the patient needs to be considered.
VR stimulus can lead to simulator sickness symptoms, most
commonly fatigue, headache and nausea, (Akiduki et al., 2003;
Norman, 2018), which may be caused by poor coordination
between the visual VR stimulus and the real life movement,
creating the so called “sensory conﬂict” (Du˙zma´nska et al., 2018;
Weech et al., 2019). Although most simulator sickness symptoms
are mild and resolve quickly (Nichols and Patel, 2002), they may
be exacerbated by the simultaneous occurrence of gastrointestinal
eﬀects of psychedelics (Johnson et al., 2012; Reiﬀ et al.,
2020). Cyber-sickness symptoms can be mitigated with careful
consideration of VR design speciﬁcations, for example: avoiding
controller-based movements, minimizing gaming content in
favor of scenic or minimalistic content (Saredakis et al., 2020),
or maintaining an appropriate exposure time (Du˙zma´nska et al.,
2018). Finally, the head mounted visual display, technical glitches
or poor visual quality of
the VR model may cause some
discomfort (Norman, 2018), which may be of particular relevance
when under the inﬂuence of a psychedelic substance, when senses
are heightened and uncomfortable bodily sensations may already
be present (Reiﬀ et al., 2020). Therefore, attention needs to be
devoted to using the highest quality content and equipment
as well as adjusting the VR set-up for maximum comfort of

the participant, including for participants who wear glasses.
Individuals with severe visual impairment or who wear large
glasses that cannot be ﬁtted into the VR headset may need to be
excluded from treatment.

Resource Limitation
Introduction of VR technology into therapy requires the
development of novel protocols and procedures as well as
training of practitioners (McMahon and Boeldt, 2021). Therapists
would be required to upskill to take advantage of VR’s unique
features and, more importantly, to ensure that any VR-related
technological malfunctions or psychological adverse reactions
are mitigated. Additionally, VR becomes a new variable that
the therapist needs to control, potentially distracting them from
being fully present for the patient. A large dose of comfort,
familiarity and control over the VR software and hardware is
required before it can be employed by the practitioner, which puts
additional demand on training time and resources.

Commercial Interests
Virtual reality is currently predominantly used as entertainment
technology (Cipresso et al., 2018). Its use in therapy is largely
unregulated and numerous VR products that target therapeutic,
or well-being applications have not been scientiﬁcally tested
or validated. Such validation is of particular importance when
technology is used in combination with psychoactive substances
that can alter processing of external and internal stimuli as
profoundly as psychedelic compounds. An increasing interest
in introducing VR into PP calls for an urgent need for
careful evaluation, ideally via a scientiﬁc, peer-reviewed process.
Additionally, VR models should always be supplied with
robust protocols that consider application, timing, technical
requirements, mitigation of potential side eﬀects and response to
adverse events, among others.

SUMMARY

Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy presents itself as a promising
and attractive alternative to established psychiatric treatments
(Nichols, 2016; Belouin and Henningﬁeld, 2018). The recent
revival in research on therapies that use psychedelics highlights
a unique set of beneﬁts, along with a unique set of challenges
and limitations of this approach (Wheeler and Dyer, 2020;
Williams et al., 2021). In parallel, VR is reportedly one of the
most enjoyable and comfortable forms of therapy (Garrett et al.,
2017), having one of the highest compliance rates and best
therapeutic alliance across all forms of treatments (Meyerbröker
and Emmelkamp, 2008; Wilson et al., 2008), even among
individuals resistant to other treatments (Riva et al., 2019). It can
be used to provide the most favorable environmental stimulus
with a high level of control and thus reinforce PP with properties
in which current protocols may be inadequate.

In supporting treatments that use psychedelics, VR can be

utilized for its ability to:

1. Mitigate psychological side eﬀects through enhancing the

state of relaxation,

To maximize potential beneﬁts

from profound ASC
experiences, including ME, VR can be used to prime occurrences
of those states by training the capacity to enter them during
preparation; augment their depth and facilitate their profound
emotional impact during dosing; and enhance therapeutic utility
by aiding revisiting of these states during integration. When
working in synergy with changing features of the psychedelic
experience, VR scenarios can oﬀer gentle guidance during
to altered
the delicate process of
consciousness and from altered to normal consciousness (Fox
et al., 2018). When used repeatedly across multiple, diﬀerent
PP sessions, VR can provide continuity to the experience of
treatment, from preparation to dosing, from dosing to integration
and from integration to self-practice. Further, VR may extend the
beneﬁts of PP by enabling and encouraging deeper exploration of
insights that emerged during integration, and inspire continued,
self-paced practice of beneﬁcial activities, for example meditation
or relaxation (Mithoefer et al., 2008). Last but not least, the VR
world is a safe, comfortable and intuitive intervention that, when
needed, can temporarily distract from an overly challenging or
adverse experience, or disrupt the process of being stuck in an
experiential loop without terminating treatment.

Finally,

it is noted that special care needs to be taken
when using VR as a part of psychedelic psychotherapy,
particularly around not
introducing potentially disturbing
or traumatic triggers, distracting from the inner experience,

CONCLUSION

We described features of VR that make it a promising
candidate as a complementary moderator of therapies that
utilize psychedelic substances. Whilst these features are yet to
be empirically explored in relation to psychedelics, we propose
a range of potential synergistic applications of VR and PP and
evaluate their individual advantages and disadvantages aiming
to inspire an informed research practice in this emerging ﬁeld.
We suggest that a comfortable, adaptable, and reliable VR setting
may support treatment with psychedelics via mitigating adverse
psychological states, catalyzing the eﬀects of each phase of the
psychedelic experience and building a cohesive trajectory for
the entire PP. Further research could explore the potential
application of VR to: expand and deepen mystical and peak
experiences; guide transition into and out of an altered state of
consciousness; promote a continuous, multi-sensory experience
through the entire psychedelic journey; and oﬀer a non-
invasive mitigation of adverse events. These potential synergistic
applications need to be empirically validated in the view of
potential limitations prior to commercial application.
