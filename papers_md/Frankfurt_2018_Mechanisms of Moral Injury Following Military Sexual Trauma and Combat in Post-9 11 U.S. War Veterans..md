injury may result from perpetration-based and betrayal-based acts
Objective: Moral
that violate deeply held norms; however, researchers and clinicians have little guidance
about the moral
injury syndrome’s speciﬁc developmental pathways following morally
injurious events. The present study’s objective was to examine the direct and indirect
injury (1) in relation to two
pathways proposed in a frequently cited model of moral
types of military-related traumas [experiencing military sexual trauma (MST) and combat
exposure].

Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted within a sample of post-9/11 veterans
at a Southwestern Veterans Health Care System (N = 310) across two time-points.
Structural equation modeling tested the direct and indirect pathways from MST and
combat to a PTSD-depression factor via betrayal, perpetration, guilt, and shame.

Results: Betrayal accounted for the association between MST and PTSD-depression
(β = 0.10, p < 0.01, 95% CI = 0.01 − 0.11) and perpetration accounted for the
association between combat and PTSD-depression (β = 0.07, p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.02
− 0.14). The indirect path from combat to shame to PTSD-depression was signiﬁcant
(β = 0.16, p < 0.01, 95% CI = 0.07 − 0.28) but the path through guilt was not.
The speciﬁc indirect paths through perpetration or betrayal to shame or guilt were
non-signiﬁcant.

Conclusions: Betrayal and perpetration are associated with PTSD-depression following
MST and combat. Results suggest multiple pathways of moral
injury development
following different military traumas and morally injurious events. Implications for moral
injury conceptualization and treatment are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Moral
injury describes the unique psychological harm of
acting, failing to prevent, or witnessing actions that transgress
one’s deeply held values
(i.e., perpetration-based morally
injurious events) or being betrayed by a trusted authority ﬁgure
in a high stakes situation [betrayal-based morally injurious events
(1, 2)]. It was originally conceptualized to help account for the
poorer functioning among combat veterans whose worst traumas
involved acts of commission (e.g., killing) or omission (e.g.,
failing to prevent atrocities) over those whose worst traumas were
life threat-based (3). Subsequently, Stein et al. (4) proposed that
the construct be expanded to include noncombat betrayal-based
experiences such as experiencing military sexual trauma (MST).
Moral injury is thought to develop when veterans are unable to
integrate the memories of their morally injurious events with
their self-schemas and thus experience unresolved inner conﬂicts
or moral dilemmas. These inner conﬂicts corrode their sense
of self and engender guilt, shame, and rage (i.e., mechanisms
of moral injury), which lead to the moral injury syndrome:
depression, re-experiencing and avoidance trauma symptoms,
substance abuse, spiritual/religious decline, and suicide (1, 3, 5).
There are a number of open questions in the moral injury ﬁeld
that directly impact clinicians’ and researchers’ ability to develop
evidence-based, conceptually grounded assessment tools and
psychotherapies. The boundary conditions of the perpetration-
based or betrayal-based morally injurious event categories, (i.e.,
what counts as exposure to a potentially morally injurious event)
are ill-deﬁned and debated. There is little speciﬁc formulation
about the relationships among perpetration and betrayal and
the mechanisms of moral injury development such as guilt and
shame, or their association with moral injury outcomes such as
depression and PTSD. Thus, there is a great deal of unexamined
heterogeneity in clinical presentations of moral injury and few
empirical data to guide clinicians and researchers in developing
either idiographic case conceptualizations of particular veterans
or nomothetic evidence-based interventions for moral injury.

The current study tested whether the pathways that lead
from two military traumas—combat exposure and MST—to
PTSD and depression conformed to the moral injury framework.
Speciﬁcally, we tested whether appraising MST and combat as
either perpetration-based or betrayal-based morally injurious
events leads to PTSD and depression, and whether guilt and
shame accounted for any association between the military
traumas, morally injurious events, and PTSD and depression.
We conceptualized the betrayal-based and perpetration-based
morally injurious events and guilt and shame as multiple
mediating layers of the moral injury syndrome (here modeled
as PTSD and depression) (1). Our goal was to identify potential
modiﬁable mechanisms of moral injury that can be used to
develop clinical proﬁles and, eventually, targeted treatments to
help veterans relieve the burden of their moral injuries.

Military Sexual Trauma and Moral Injury
MST refers to any experience of sexual assault or repeated,
threatening sexual harassment that occurred during a veteran’s
military service. MST can occur when the veteran was on or oﬀ

Mechanisms of Moral Injury

duty, as well as on or oﬀ base, and could have been perpetrated
by another service member or a civilian [deﬁnition from Federal
law; Title 38 U.S. Code 1720D (6)]. A recent MST prevalence
meta-analysis estimated that 24% of women and 2% of men
reported military sexual assault and 53% of women and 9% of
men reported military sexual harassment (7). MST is a risk factor
for PTSD and depression, two psychological outcomes included
in the moral injury syndrome, in both male and female post-9/11
veterans (8, 9).

Betrayal
Some moral injury researchers suggest that experiencing MST
can be a morally injurious event because it may involve
signiﬁcant perceived betrayal by fellow service members
(via within-rank violence) and military leadership in some
circumstances (4, 10–12). In a sample of Army National Guard
Soldiers redeploying from Afghanistan (N = 935),
lifetime
history of unwanted sexual activity (including pre-military
and military time periods) was signiﬁcantly correlated with
perceived betrayal but not perceived perpetration (10). Two
qualitative studies of morally injurious events in combat veterans’
trauma narratives (4, 11) conceptualized MST as manifestations
of within-rank violence or moral injury by others; however,
neither coding guidelines nor examples of MST-related trauma
narratives were provided. Thus, betrayal qualities of MST were
diﬃcult to evaluate. No studies have directly examined whether
experiencing MST is associated with betrayal or if MST is
associated with moral injury outcomes through its association
with betrayal.

Shame and Guilt
A rich clinical and empirical literature has addressed the shame-
and guilt-based reactions to sexual trauma, albeit in the context
of PTSD and not moral injury (13–16). Shame and guilt have
been described as an inherent reaction to the social subordination
and degradation of being sexually assaulted (13) or as reﬂecting
the internalization of underlying negative beliefs about oneself
as a result of the trauma (15). The extent to which veterans feel
shame vs. guilt after MST or betrayals, and whether shame vs.
guilt accounts for any association between betrayal and PTSD
and depression after MST is an open question.

Combat and Moral Injury
Combat is the primary context in which perpetration- and
betrayal-based morally injurious events occur (3). Prototypical
perpetration-based combat-related morally injurious events are
killing enemies or non-combatants and participating in or failing
to prevent excessive violence or atrocities. Among post-9/11 U.S.
veterans, 40–65% of Army and Marine Iraq War veterans
reported killing an enemy and ∼15% of Army and ∼30% of
Marine Iraq War veterans reported killing a noncombatant
[see (3) for a review]. The prevalence of morally injurious
events have not been systematically assessed in post-9/11
veterans.

Mechanisms of Moral Injury

Perpetration and Betrayal
Perpetration- and betrayal-based morally injurious events are
commonly assessed using the Moral Injury Events Scale [MIES
(17)], which asks about perpetration of morally troubling acts
by oneself or others and being betrayed by others. In a
nationally representative sample of U.S. combat veterans, 10%
reported perpetrations committed by the self, 25% reported
perpetrations committed by others, and 25% reported being
betrayed (18). MIES scores predicted higher odds of a current
mental disorders (generalized anxiety, PTSD, and depression)
and current suicidal ideation. Overall, morally injurious events
are correlated with both PTSD and depression in samples of
combat-deployed Marines (17), combat-deployed Army National
Guard soldiers (10), and mental health treatment-seeking active
duty Airmen (10).

Shame and Guilt
In the moral injury framework, the guilt and shame engendered
by perpetrating morally injurious events are conceptualized as
being, at some level, an appropriate and not irrational response
(19, 20). Both guilt and shame may be salutary in that they
may signal an intact conscience and promote prosocial reparative
behavior and interpersonal reconnection (21, 22). A handful
of studies have tested the associations between combat, guilt,
and moral injury outcomes (23–26). Three found that combat-
related guilt accounted for the association between perpetration-
based combat experiences (e.g., killing in combat, participating
in or observing atrocities) and moral injury-related outcomes
such as PTSD, depression, or suicide (23, 24, 26). One found
that perpetration was associated with state-based guilt, although
guilt was not directly associated with PTSD (25). In general,
few studies have distinguished between guilt and shame or
attempted to parcel their relative contribution to outcomes
following morally injurious events. Further, few studies have
examined the associations among these variables over time.

Summary and Current Study
The current study’s aim was to test proposed developmental
mechanisms (guilt, shame) of moral injury (PTSD, depression)
following two types of military trauma exposure (MST, combat)
and two types of morally injurious events (betrayal, perpetration)
within the context of a longitudinal parent study. Our goal was
to provide empirically grounded preliminary guidance regarding
clinical proﬁles of moral injury and potential modiﬁable factors
that could be targeted in moral injury treatment. Overall, there
are few exhaustive tests of the multiple intervening mechanisms
in the moral injury model (e.g., testing relations from military
trauma to appraisals of perpetration or betrayal to guilt and
injury outcomes). Few empirical data are
shame to moral
available on experiencing MST within a moral injury framework
and no studies have assessed whether experiencing MST is
associated with PTSD and depression via betrayal. Likewise,
few attempts have been made to integrate conceptualizations
of perpetration- and betrayal-related guilt and shame within
existing models of posttraumatic shame and guilt. Because
exposure to combat trauma and MST is not mutually exclusive
and both experiences may contribute to veterans’ cumulative

PTSD and depression (27–29), we included both types of military
traumas in the current study to enhance ecological validity.

The key pathways representing the moral injury model were
the indirect paths: (I) from MST through betrayal to a composite
latent
factor reﬂecting PTSD-depression, (II) from combat
through betrayal to PTSD-depression, and (III) from combat
through perpetration to PTSD-depression. The predicted direct
pathways were numerically labeled to facilitate interpretation, as
follows (see Figure 1). We predicted direct pathways from MST
to betrayal (1), from combat to betrayal (2), and from combat to
perpetration (3). We did not model the pathways from MST to
perpetration because our measure of MST involved victimization
only and thus a pathway through perpetration was neither
conceptually nor clinically appropriate. To account for the guilt-
and shame-based PTSD framework, we modeled the direct paths
from MST to shame (4), from MST to guilt (5), from combat to
shame (6), and from combat to guilt (7). We modeled the paths
from betrayal to shame (8) and guilt (9), and from perpetration
to shame (10) and guilt (11); these were considered exploratory.
Because aﬀective reactions to perpetration and betrayal other
than shame and guilt may contribute to PTSD-depression [e.g.,
anger (25)], we also modeled the direct paths from betrayal
to PTSD-depression (12) and perpetration to PTSD-depression
(13). Given the established relations from guilt and shame to both
depression (30) and PTSD, we modeled the paths from shame
to PTSD-depression (14) and guilt to PTSD-depression (15).
Based on the accumulated body of trauma literature, we expected
signiﬁcant direct pathways from MST to PTSD-depression (16)
and from combat exposure to PTSD-depression (17).

carried out

Participants and Procedures
This
in accordance with the
recommendations of Central Texas Veterans Healthcare
System Institutional Review Board. All subjects gave written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
consent prior to beginning the face-to-face baseline assessment.
U.S. post-9/11 war veterans participated in a parent study of
potentially modiﬁable psychosocial factors impacting adjustment
over time following warzone service. Veterans were recruited
using ﬂyers posted throughout the medical center, letters mailed
to a randomly selected listed of post-9/11 veterans enrolled in
the local VA healthcare system, and through health provider
referrals. Although veterans must have been enrolled in the
VA healthcare system to participate, actual treatment seeking
was variable and was not a requirement of eligibility. Speciﬁc
populations (women, veterans with PTSD and depression)
were over-sampled through targeted mailings; diagnoses for
oversampling were based on the electronic medical record.
Veterans were excluded if they had plans to relocate within the
subsequent 4 months or met criteria for a psychotic or bipolar
disorder. If veterans were receiving psychiatric care at the time
of the baseline assessment, they were required to have reached
treatment stabilization criteria for at least 3 months. Veterans
were included in the current study if they were administered
both the MST measure [DRRI; (31)] and the Moral Injury Events

Scale [MIES (17)] (N = 310). Data were gathered at two time
points: MST and combat exposure were assessed at baseline;
betrayal, transgression, shame, guilt, and PTSD, and depression
were assessed 16 months later. Retention between time one and
time two was extremely high (87%). Participants completed the
self-report questionnaires at a VA medical center at baseline and
by mail or online at the 16-month follow-up.

Measures
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (32) was used
at baseline to screen for the excluded diagnoses of psychotic or
bipolar disorders (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental
Health Disorders, 4th Edition; DSM-IV; APA, 2000).

Combat Exposure was measured using 18-item Full Combat
Exposure Scale (33). Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (never) to 4 (10+ times); the total summed score was used.
In the current study, internal consistency using Cronbach’s α was
0.92.

MST was measured using the 8-item Sexual Harassment
Scale on the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory-2 (31).
Items were scored on a 4-point Likert-style scale (1 = Never to
4 = Many times). In the validation sample of Iraq/Afghanistan
veterans, internal consistency was α = 0.86 (31). In the current
sample, internal consistency was α = 0.89. MST summed scores
were used.

Betrayal and perpetration were measured using the 9-item
Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES; 16). Items are rated on a
6-point Likert-style scale (1 = Strongly agree to 6 = Strongly
disagree) scale. In the validation sample of combat-deployed
Marines, internal consistency for the full measure was Cronbach’s
α = 0.90 (17). In the current sample, the internal consistency
of the betrayal factor was Cronbach’s α = 0.85; and of the
perpetration factor was Cronbach’s α = 0.94.

Shame and guilt were measured using the 10-item State Shame
and Guilt Scale (34). Respondents rated ﬁve guilt-related items
(e.g., I feel remorse, regret) and ﬁve shame-related items (e.g., I
feel that I am a bad person) on a 5-point Likert style scale (1 = Not
feeling this way at all to 5 = Feeling this way very strongly)
scale (see Table 2 for item factor loadings). Estimates of internal
consistency in a prior study of veterans were Cronbach’s α = 0.69
for the guilt subscale and Cronbach’s α = 0.76 for the shame
subscale (35). In the current sample, guilt subscale Cronbach’s α
was 0.91 and shame subscale Cronbach’s α was 0.91.

PTSD symptoms were measured at the 16-month follow-
up assessment using the 20-item Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Checklist for DSM-5 [PCL-5 (36)]. Participants rated how much
they were bothered by each of the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms
over the past month in relation to stressful military experiences
on a 4-point Likert-style scale (0 = Not at all to 4 = Extremely). In
the PCL-5 validation study, internal consistency was Cronbach’s
α = 0.95 with a clinical cut-oﬀ of 33 to indicate probable PTSD
(37). In the current study, internal consistency was Cronbach’s
α = 0.97.

Depressive symptoms were measured at the 16-month follow-
up assessment using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9
(38). Respondents indicated how often they have been bothered
by symptoms of depression over the past 2 weeks on a 3-point

Likert scale (0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day). A PHQ-9
score of 10 is suggested as the cut-oﬀ for moderate depression
(38). In the current study, internal consistency was Cronbach’s
α = 0.91.

Data Analysis Plan
Preliminary analysis of study variables was conducted before
testing our primary and secondary models. Approximately half
of the items on the MST measure were skewed (0.99–5.06) and
leptokurtic (-0.67–25.86) and so summed MST total scores were
used. The summed total MST score was not signiﬁcantly skewed
(2.47) and was leptokurtic (6.05); however, non-normality is
unlikely to aﬀect parameter estimates when maximum likelihood
estimation is used and sample sizes are larger than N = 100 (39).
The pattern of correlations among study variables was
examined (Table 1). Next, we tested the full measurement model.
Lastly, we tested the structural model assessing the direct and
indirect pathways from MST and combat exposure to PTSD-
depression via perpetration and betrayal, and guilt and shame.
Model ﬁt was determined using four indices: χ 2 test of model
ﬁt, comparative ﬁt index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis ﬁt index (TLI),
the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and
the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). CFI and
TLI values >0.90 and RMSEA and SRMR values of ≤0.08 are
considered indices of good ﬁt (40). Indirect paths were evaluated
using the bias-corrected bootstrapped conﬁdence intervals. SEM
was conducted in Mplus Version 7.3, which estimated models
using maximum likelihood estimation. All reported paths were
standardized using the Mplus STDYX procedure.

RESULTS

The current sample was mostly male (76%, n = 235) and
middle-aged (M = 40.67, SD = 8.55). Racial diversity reﬂected
the geographic area: 57% white (n = 177), 32% African
American (n = 99), 5% Asian American (n = 15), 6% American
Indian/Alaska native (n = 18), 1% Hawaiian/Paciﬁc Islander
(n = 3), and 3% other (n = 9). Hispanic veterans (19%, n = 60)
were also well-represented. Participants tended to be married
(66%, n = 205) with some college experience but no degree (45%,
n = 138). On average, participants enlisted in military service at
20.93 years old (SD = 4.49) and the majority served in the Army
(90.3%, n = 280) on active duty (96.8%, n = 300) for an average
of 13.50 years (SD = 7.61). The modal number of deployments
to Iraq or Afghanistan was 2 (SD = 1.11, range = 1–7); 86.8% of
participants had deployed to Iraq (n = 269) and 30% (n = 93) had
deployed to Afghanistan (categories not mutually exclusive). The
average PCL-5 total score was 35.68 (SD = 21.22), and 54.4% of
the sample had PCL-5 scores at or above the clinical cutoﬀ for
PTSD. The average PHQ-9 total score was 11.50 (SD = 7.03),
which is in the moderate depression range.

In total, 42.3% of the sample (n = 131; 28.9% of men, n = 68;
83.8% of women, n = 62; 100% of transgender veterans, n = 1)
reported at least one experience of MST. The most common were
being subjected to crude and oﬀensive sexual remarks (38.1%,
n = 118) and having negative rumors spread about the veteran’s
sexual activities (22.3%, n = 70). For MST involving threat or

into sex involving use of a position of authority; 7.4% (n = 23)
reported being oﬀered a speciﬁc reward or special treatment for
participation in sex; and 8.1% (n = 25) reported being threatened
with retaliation for not being sexual cooperative. Signiﬁcantly
more women than men reported each type of MST. Nearly all
participants (98.7%, n = 306) were exposed to some form of
combat. The combat exposure measure assessed two prototypical
perpetration-based acts: being directly responsible for the death
of an enemy combatant (28.2%, n = 89) and being directly
responsible for the death of a noncombatant (12%; n = 39).

(1070)

Measurement Model
Latent variables in the primary measurement model were
betrayal, perpetration, shame, guilt, and PTSD-depression. First,
the full measurement model was tested. The unmodiﬁed
measurement model ﬁt poorly, X2
= 4959.30, p <0.001,
RMSEA = 0.09, CFI = 0.79, TLI = 0.78, SRMR = 0.07.
Modiﬁcation indices suggested correlating pairs of MIES items
that were correlated in Nash et al. (17). PTSD and depression
were modeled as one latent variable due to the high correlation
between the PCL-5 and PHQ-9 and to reﬂect
the moral
injury syndrome. Modiﬁcation indices suggested signiﬁcant
model ﬁt
improvement by correlating pairs of PTSD and
depression symptom items that either assessed similar aspects
of PTSD symptoms within the same PTSD diagnostic criterion
(B-E) or were a pair of PCL-5 and PHQ-9 items that
assessed diﬃculty falling asleep. Perpetration and betrayal were
correlated, as were shame and guilt, due to shared measurement
variance. The modiﬁed measurement model yielded adequate
ﬁt, X2
= 3510.73, p <0.001, RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.87,
TLI = 0.86, SRMR = 0.06. See Table 2 for factor loadings and
item and factor correlations.

Structural Model Testing Combat and MST
Within Moral Injury Framework
Overall, the structural model provided good ﬁt to the data,
X2
= 3040.18, p < 0.001. RMSEA = 0.07, CFI = 0.86,
TLI = 0.85, SRMR = 0.07 (see Figure 1). We found mixed
support for our primary pathways. MST was indirectly associated
with PTSD-depression via betrayal (β = 0.10, p < 0.01, 95%

(1147)

CI = 0.04 −0.20) and combat was indirectly associated with
PTSD-depression via perpetration (β = 0.07, p < 0.05, 95%
CI = 0.02 −0.13). The indirect path from combat through shame
to PTSD/depression was signiﬁcant (β = 0.16, p < 0.01, 95%
CI = 0.07 −0.27) although the path through guilt was not
(β = −0.04, p = 0.20, 95% CI = −0.13 −0.02). Neither of the
indirect paths from MST to PTSD/depression via moral injury
mechanisms were signiﬁcant (via shame, β = 0.10, p = 0.08,
95% CI = −0.003 −0.23; via guilt, β = −0.003, p = 0.81, 95%
CI = −0.05 −0.01). The speciﬁc indirect paths from combat to
perpetration to shame to PTSD-depression was not signiﬁcant
(β = 0.06, p = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02 −0.16) and neither
was the path through perpetration to guilt to PTSD/depression
(β = −0.01, p = 0.23, 95% CI = −0.01 −0.003). Contrary to
expectation, combat was not indirectly associated with PTSD-
depression via betrayal (β = 0.04, p = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.01 −0.11).
See Figure 1 for all signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁcant direct paths.

DISCUSSION

This study’s purpose was to test a frequently cited model of
moral injury (1): whether MST and combat were associated
with PTSD and depression via perpetration-based morally
injurious events or betrayal-based morally injurious events and
subsequent guilt and/or shame. Our critical test accounted for
pathways suggested by the broader trauma literature; namely,
that guilt and shame may contribute to PTSD and depression
independent of perpetration or betrayal. We found mixed
support for the key pathways of the moral injury model. Betrayal
was a signiﬁcant pathway from MST to PTSD-depression and

depression; unexpectedly, betrayal did not have an indirect
eﬀect from combat to PTSD-depression. Shame, but not guilt,
accounted for some of the association between combat and
PTSD-depression.

Betrayal
Until this study, MST’s betrayal aspects have not been studied
using the moral injury framework, but have been conceptualized
within the institutional betrayal literature. Institutional betrayal
refers to “when institutional action or inaction exacerbates the

an individual who trusts or depends upon that institution”
[p. 578 (41)]. Thus, the deﬁnition of institutional betrayal is
reminiscent of the moral injury ﬁeld’s deﬁnition of betrayal,
i.e., “betrayal of what’s right in a high stakes situation by a
trusted authority ﬁgure” (2, 42). Consequently, MST may be a
prototypical example of several key facets of both institutional
betrayal and moral injury betrayal: failure to protect service
members dependent on the military, disruption of belongingness
in a close community by interpersonal violence, and institutional
priorities that run counter to prosecuting sex crimes (43). In a
sample of 49 male and female veterans, the majority perceived

their MST as involving institutional betrayal and, notably,
perceptions of institutional betrayal signiﬁcantly predicted PTSD
and depressive symptoms (44). To our knowledge, Monteith et al.
is the only study that examined MST within the institutional
betrayal framework. This suggests a largely unexplored and
potentially fruitful lens through which to deepen understanding
of and treatment for MST and the betrayal-like aspects of moral

the

Betrayal was not directly associated with either guilt or
shame. We speculate that betrayal may evoke reactions such
as anger or self-disgust that were not directly assessed in the
current study and that have known relations with PTSD and
depression. In support of this hypothesis, a previous study of
combat-deployed Marines found a signiﬁcant direct association
between betrayal and anger and an indirect association with
PTSD via anger (25). Similarly, in a recent study of Israeli combat
veterans, betrayal-based morally injurious events were associated
with symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depressive attributions,
and self-disgust (45). Thus, these results suggest that additional
“mechanisms” of moral injury such as anger, rage, and disgust
should be examined in future studies and potentially targeted in
treatment.

Perpetration
Perpetration accounted for the association between combat
and PTSD-depression and was associated with both shame
and guilt, although the speciﬁc indirect paths from combat
to perpetration to shame or guilt to PTSD-depression were
not signiﬁcant. Three previous studies have found a path
from prototypical perpetration-type combat events (e.g., killing,
atrocities) to negative mental health outcomes through combat-
related guilt (23, 24, 26); however,
these studies did not
assess shame alongside guilt. Similar to our ﬁnding of a
signiﬁcant association between shame and PTSD-depression
but not guilt and PTSD-depression, one of the few studies
that examined both guilt and shame in combat veterans
found that shame-proneness was positively associated with
PTSD, but guilt-proneness was negatively associated with PTSD
(46). In general, previous studies have examined just combat-
related guilt or guilt-proneness. Our study is one of
the
ﬁrst to compare the relative contribution of guilt vs. shame,
for individual diﬀerences in veterans’
and also to account
appraisals of combat as perpetration-type morally injurious
events.

We also found evidence for a direct path from combat to
guilt distinct from appraisals of betrayal or perpetration. Clinical
literature has described the ways that combat-related guilt can
function: as an “honoring” impulse so that people who were
killed or wronged are not forgotten, or, as a way of assuming
responsibility and thus lessening one’s sense of helplessness

after uncontrollable or chaotic situations (47, 48). A suﬃcient
conceptual and empirical model of moral injury must account
for the non-speciﬁc occurrence of guilt and shame following
traditional
traumas as well as morally injurious
events. Future models of moral injury also need to account
for guilt and shame’s cumulative eﬀects as well as their unique
eﬀects.

life-threat

The role of MST within the moral

injury framework
needs additional theoretical consideration and clariﬁcation. The
current study established that experiencing MST may be a
betrayal-based morally injurious event that may beneﬁt from a
moral injury-focused intervention approach. At the same time,
perpetrating MST, such as rape of civilians or fellow service
members, falls well within the domain of potential perpetration-
based morally injurious event that could lead to moral injury.
Including both experiencing and perpetrating MST within
the morally injurious events domain could raise complicated
theoretical issues and troubling clinical scenarios. In terms of
theory, currently, the moral injury model does not consider guilt
and shame as necessarily irrational or dysfunctional responses
to morally injurious events. A consequence of
including
experiencing MST within the morally injurious events category
will be to make the moral injury model agnostic as to whether
guilt and shame are appropriate or inappropriate responses
to morally injurious events. In terms of clinical approaches,
at face value, guilt, shame, self-disgust, and rage in response
to perpetrating MST would necessitate a diﬀerent treatment
approach than guilt, shame, self-disgust, and rage in response
to the betrayal of experiencing MST. Moreover, there would be
potential for iatrogenic harm if MST survivors were treated in the
same clinical settings as MST perpetrators. Thus, how MST ﬁts
into the moral injury domain remains both a pressing theoretical
and clinical concern for the ﬁeld.

Strengths of the study included the two-time point design,
which diminished potential for ambient measurement variance
contributing to signiﬁcant results, and psychometrically strong
measures of hypothesized constructs. However, interpretation of
results should be tempered by study limitations. Secondary data
analysis limited the range of tested moral injury mechanisms. For
example, the parent study did not include measures of anger or
disgust, which may be additional intervening variables between
betrayal and PTSD-depression (25, 45). We had relatively lower
endorsement of MST compared to combat, and thus future
studies may beneﬁt from oversampling for veterans who have
experienced MST. The parent study did not directly assess
perceptions of
institutional betrayal. Future studies should
include a measure of institutional betrayal, which could clarify
the relation between perpetration and betrayal and moral injury
outcomes; this is relevant given that our sample was comprised
of veterans who were willing to be enrolled in the local VA
healthcare system, which may limit generalizability. Speciﬁcally,
some veterans may not be willing to seek VA services due to
feelings of institutional betrayal, and thus, future research should
include a broader sample of veterans who seek services within
and outside of VA. The combat exposure variable oversampled
potentially fear-based experiences (e.g., experiencing incoming
rocket attacks) and under sampled for potentially morally

what constitutes a traumatic event, how to conciliate objective
and subjective deﬁnitions of trauma, and whether “bracket

this
current study poses directions for future research that can

testing potential mechanisms of moral injury development and
