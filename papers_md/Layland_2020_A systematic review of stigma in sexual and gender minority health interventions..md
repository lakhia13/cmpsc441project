Abstract
Stigma against sexual and gender minorities is a major driver of 
health disparities. Psychological and behavioral interventions 
that do not address the stigma experienced by sexual and 
gender minorities may be less efficacious. We conducted a 
systematic review of existing psychological and behavioral health 
interventions for sexual and gender minorities to investigate 
how interventions target sexual and gender minority stigma 
and consider how stigma could affect intervention efficacy. 
Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-
analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Eligible studies 
were peer reviewed and published in English between January 
2003 and July 2019 and reported empirical results of behavioral 
or psychological interventions implemented among sexual 
and gender minorities. All interventions addressed stigma. We 
identified 37 eligible interventions. Most interventions targeted 
sexual minority men. Interventions were frequently developed 
or adapted for implementation among sexual and gender 
minorities and addressed multiple levels and types of stigma. 
Interventions most frequently targeted proximal stressors, 
including internalized and anticipated stigma. HIV and mental 
health were the most commonly targeted health outcomes. 
A limited number of studies investigated the moderating 
or mediating effects of stigma on intervention efficacy. The 
application of an intersectional framework was frequently absent 
and rarely amounted to addressing sources of stigma beyond 
sexual and gender minority identities. A growing number of 
interventions address sexual and gender minority stigma in an 
effort to prevent deleterious health effects. Future research is 
needed to assess whether stigma modifies the effectiveness of 
existing psychological and behavioral interventions among sexual 
and gender minorities. Further, the application of intersectional 
frameworks is needed to more comprehensively intervene on 
multiple, intersecting sources of stigma faced by the diverse 
sexual and gender minority community.

Health disparities experienced by sexual and gender 
minorities (SGMs; i.e., individuals who do not iden-
tify as heterosexual or cisgender) are widely recorded 
in  scientific  literature  [1–3].  Even  with  advances 
in  social  policy  for  SGM  equality  and  protection, 
SGMs  are  more  likely  to  experience  psychological 
disorders  [4],  physical  illness  [5],  and  barriers  to 
comprehensive, affirming health care [6] compared 

IMPLICATIONS
Practice:  Behavioral  and  psychological  health 
interventions  for  sexual  and  gender  minorities 
should  account  for  experiences  of  stigma  when 
they are designed and adapted.

Policy: Policy makers seeking to reduce psycho-
logical  and  behavioral  health  disparities  among 
sexual  and  gender  minorities  should  support 
sexual  and  gender  minority-specific,  evidence-
based  preventative  interventions  that  intervene 
on stigma.

Research:  Future  intervention  research  with 
sexual  and  gender  minority  populations  should 
investigate  the  impact  of  stigma  on  intervention 
effectiveness and examine the impact of multiple, 
intersecting sources of stigma.

to  heterosexual  or  cisgender  populations.  Minority 
stress  theory  posits  that  SGMs  experience  unique 
and  chronic,  stigma-related  stress  contributing  to 
elevated risk for poor health and reduced access to 
coping resources [7, 8]. Thus, it is critical that inter-
ventions  seeking  to  alleviate  psychological  distress 
and improve health among SGMs take into account 
the role stigma plays in SGM health.

Although  a  recent  review  summarized  evidence-
based  interventions  targeting  stigma  against  sexual 
minorities  [9],  less  is  known  about  how  the  stigma 
experienced  by  SGMs  is  addressed.  Thus,  re-
searchers  are  limited  in  their  ability  to  improve  on 
prior  interventions  systematically  because  the  field 
has  not  yet  summarized  how  existing  interventions 
address  SGM  stigma.  Further,  attention  should  be 
paid to how stigma is operationalized in intervention 
research.  The  stigma  that  SGMs  face  occurs  along 
a  continuum  of  proximity  to  the  individual  from 
distal stressors (e.g., events of discrimination or vio-
lence and lack of legal protection) to more proximal 
stressors  (e.g.,  expectations  of  rejection  or  intern-
alized  stigma).  In  addition,  minority  stress  theory 
emerged  from  research  mainly  focused  on  a  single

tation or gender identity) rather than addressing the 
intersection of multiple, stigmatized social identities 
and  the  interlocking  of  identities  with  social  priv-
ilege and disadvantage [10, 11]. Indeed, SGMs may 
experience SGM-specific stigma (e.g., homonegative 
discrimination)  and  non-SGM-specific  stigma  (e.g., 
HIV  stigma  and  racism).  Intersectionality  pro-
vides  a  framework  for  understanding  the  multiple, 
individuals  embody 
intersecting 
within  interlocking  social  systems  of  privilege  and 
oppression [10–12]. Thus, a summary of SGM inter-
vention  literature  is  needed  to  comprehensively 
document  how  interventions  address  the  multiple 
sources  of the  stigma that  SGMs  face and  whether 
intersectionality  is  considered  in  health  interven-
tions implemented among diverse SGMs.

identities  that 

Current study
The  current  review  investigates  the  integration  of 
stigma  into  interventions  targeting  SGM  psycho-
logical  and  behavioral  health.  We  identified  ways 
in  which  intervention  content  addresses  stigma, 
how interventions directly intervene on stigma, and 
whether  intervention  efficacy  is  mediated  or  mod-
erated  by  stigma.  Finally,  we  reviewed  the  use  of 
intersectional frameworks for intervention develop-
ment  and  implementation  among  SGMs  to  deter-
mine whether these interventions address the many 
intersecting types of stigma SGM experience.

METHODS
We  searched  for  empirical  intervention  studies 
among  SGMs  using  PyscINFO  and  PubMed  data-
bases  in  July  2019  (study  protocol  [registered  at 
Prospero  Record  ID  CRD42020148605]).  Search 
results  included  at  least  one  stigma  keyword  (e.g., 
stigma,  discrimination,  and  minority  stress),  one 
intervention  keyword  (e.g.,  intervention,  clinical 
trial, and pilot), and one population keyword (e.g., 
bisexual,  gender  minority,  and  transgender)  in 
paper titles or abstracts.  The search was limited to 
English  language,  peer-reviewed  papers  published 
between  January  1,  2003  (after  the  publication 
of  Meyer’s  [8]  study  of  sexual  minority  stress)  and 
July 10, 2019. Three authors reviewed titles and ab-
stracts for the following eligibility criteria: (a) SGM 
sample, (b) empirical results of a behavioral or psy-
chological intervention, and (c) inclusion of stigma 
in  intervention  content,  intervention  outcomes,  or 
as a mediator or moderator of intervention effects. 
We  included  all  types  of  behavioral  interventions 
(e.g.,  prevention  programs  and  psychotherapy). 
Strictly  biomedical  or  surgical  interventions  were 
excluded.  Stigma  was  defined  broadly  across  mul-
tiple  levels  [13]  to  include  individual  internalized 
(internalization  of  negative  societal  attitudes)  and 
anticipated (sensitivity to or expectation of stigma), 
interpersonal enacted (expressed by one person to 

SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS

another), and structural stigma (societal, cultural, or 
institutional  norms  and  policies)  and  was  inclusive 
across identity statuses to include both SGM stigma 
(e.g.,  transphobic  discrimination)  and  non-SGM 
stigma experienced by SGMs (e.g., HIV stigma and 
racism). Eligible studies reported either exclusively 
SGM samples or explicit SGM subsample analyses. 
Interventions described in multiple papers were in-
cluded as a single intervention.

Extracted data included sample sexual orientation, 
gender  identity,  race/ethnicity,  age,  and  interven-
tion geographic location. Coded intervention design 
characteristics  included  trial  type,  program  content, 
level (e.g., individual and group), targeted health out-
comes,  adapting  for  SGMs,  and  adapting,  if  any,  to 
additional  identities  or  stigma  beyond  SGM  status 
(e.g.,  intersectional  frameworks  and  adapting  pro-
cedures). To identify integration of stigma, we coded 
how stigma was included in the intervention (content, 
targeted  outcome,  and  mediator/moderator)  and 
identified the stigma level (internalized, anticipated, 
enacted, and structural) and type (e.g., bullying, iden-
tity concealment, and internalized homonegativity).

RESULTS
We  identified  4,581  potentially  eligible  papers 
(Fig.  1).  Thirty-seven  interventions  met  eligibility 
criteria and comprised the final sample. Most were 
published in the last 5 years (75.7%, n = 28; 2015–
2019).  Individual  (32.4%,  n  =  12),  group  (43.2%, 
n  =  16),  community  (13.5%,  n  =  5),  and  multilevel 
interventions  (10.8%,  n  =  4)  were  represented. 
Sample demographics are summarized in Table 1. 
Interventions  most  frequently  included  individuals 
who  were  gay  men  (48.6%,  n  =  18),  bisexual  men 
(37.8%,  n  =  14),  or  men  who  have  sex  with  men 
(MSM;  27.0%,  n  =  10).  Some  interventions  (24.3%, 
n  =  9)  included  transgender  participants,  fewer  in-
cluded gender-nonbinary or gender-nonconforming 
participants (8.1%, n = 3) [14–16], and many did not 
disaggregate gender identities (43.2%, n = 16). Taken 
together, intervention studies included 16,872 SGMs 
(90.7%  men,  9.2%  women,  and  0.1%  nonbinary). 
Transgender  participants  comprised  at  least  0.6% 
of  men  and  14.5%  of  women.  The  unweighted 
average age across interventions was 29.7 years old 
(SD = 9.7). A complete list of interventions with sum-
mary of content, target population, and approach to 
addressing stigma can be found in Table 2.

Stigma in sexual and gender minority interventions
Stigma  was  operationalized  across 
internalized 
(64.8%,  n  =  24),  anticipated  (32.4%,  n  =  12),  en-
acted  (67.8%,  n  =  21),  and  structural  levels  (8.1%, 
n  =  3).  For  internalized  stigma,  interventions  most 
frequently  reported  addressing  internalized  homo-
(27.02%, 
phobia/homonegativity/binegativity 
n  =  10)  [16–27].  Internalized  HIV  stigma  was  the 
most commonly addressed non-SGM stigma (16.2%,

n = 6) [28–33]. HIV stigma, though non-SGM spe-
cific,  was  addressed  across  all  levels  of  stigma. 
Anticipated  stigma  most  frequently  included  rejec-
tion sensitivity and fear (10.8%, n = 4) [18, 34–37], 
concealment (8.1%, n = 3) [17, 27, 37, 38], and HIV 
stigma  (8.1%,  n  =  3)  [30,  39,  40].  Enacted  stigma 
most frequently included sexual minority discrimin-
ation (24.3%, n = 9) [19, 20, 24–26, 34, 41–44], HIV 
stigma (16.2%, n = 6) [41, 45–49], and transgender 
stigma  (8.1%,  n  =  3)  [15,  16,  50].  Structural  stigma 
was  addressed  in  three  interventions  [20,  24–26]. 
Interventions  most  frequently  intervened  on  HIV 
transmission (54.1%, n = 20) and, to a lesser extent, 
mental health concerns (18.9%, n = 7).

Stigma in intervention content 
Interventions  were  developed  for  SGMs  (48.6%, 
n = 18), adapted from non-SGM interventions (13.5%, 
n = 5), adapted from interventions serving other SGM 
subpopulations (e.g., intervention for sexual minority 
men adapted for bisexual people of any gender [27]; 
13.5%, n = 5), or implemented without SGM-specific 
considerations  in  content  design  or  cultural  adapta-
tion (24.3%, n = 9). Novel interventions developed for 
implementation  among  SGMs  relied  on  input  from 
SGM  health  experts,  community  members,  and  ad-
visory  boards.  Among  interventions  not  adapted  or 
developed for SGMs, all addressed HIV vulnerability 
or HIV stigma primarily among sexual minority men 
[28–30, 32, 39, 40, 49, 51, 52].

Intervening on stigma 
Over half (64.9%, n = 24) of interventions intervened 
directly on stigma and measured intervention effect 
on stigma reduction. Individual and group interven-
tions  predominantly  focused  on  reducing  internal-
ized  homonegativity  and  binegativity,  internalized 
HIV  stigma,  and  anticipated  stigma.  Some  inter-
ventions focused on individual’s response to stigma 
(e.g.,  generating  social  support  for  participants  ex-
periencing enacted discrimination) [21, 22, 27, 30]. 
No  interventions  directly  intervened  on  structural 
stigma, though some community-level interventions 
sought  to  create  broader  environmental  change 
through reducing enacted stigma (e.g., [42]). Other 
community-level programs mobilized partners [33], 
developed media campaigns [47], identified discrim-
ination  in  the  community  [49],  or  trained  popular 
opinion  leaders  [46]  to  increase  healthy  behavior 
and reduce stigma through community engagement.

Mediation and moderation 
Only five studies statistically tested stigma as a me-
diator  (5.4%,  n  =  2)  or  moderator  (8.1%,  n  =3)  of 
intervention  effects.  Experiences  of  internalized 
HIV  stigma  did  not  mediate  intervention  effects 
in  one  intervention  [30],  whereas  reductions  in 
condomless anal intercourse in the Socially Optimized 
Learning  Virtual  Environments  (SOLVE)  intervention 
were fully mediated by reductions in experiences of 
sexual  shame  [53].  Discrimination  coping  [14]  and

internalized stigma [23, 37] moderated intervention 
effects.

Intersectional stigma and adaptation 
Less than half (45.9%, n = 17) of interventions con-
sidered additional identities or stigma beyond SGM 
status.  Some  interventions  used  community  evalu-
ation and feedback to develop programs for sexual 
minority  men  of  specific  racial/ethnic  groups, 
including Black [21, 40, 45, 46, 49, 54] and Latino 
men [18, 44] and men of color broadly [51]. Other 
interventions accounted for regional, cultural differ-
ences by adapting to the needs, barriers, and lived 
experiences  of  SGMs  in  China  [29],  Mexico  [31], 
and Thailand [30]. A limited number of programs 
were developed on the intersections of gender and 
sexual orientation: two were designed or adapted for 
sexual  minority  women  [20,  25]  and  one  for  trans-
gender sexual minority men [16]. Interventions also 
considered  the  unique  needs  of  SGMs  living  with 
HIV [31, 41, 44, 49], SGMs with a history of incar-
ceration [49], and SGM immigrants to the USA [18]. 
The use of intersectional theory was scarce, with only 
one intervention [49] explicitly naming an intersec-
tional framework [11]. The Health Mpowerment com-
munity  adaptation  and  Still  Climbin’  were  the  only 
two  interventions  to  report  intervention  effects 
on  racial  stigma  [41,  43],  with  mixed  efficacy.  No 
studies  reported  measures  of  intersectional  stigma 
nor examined multiple sources of stigma within the 
same models.

Potential bias 
About one third (n = 13) of interventions included 
fewer than 50 participants. Pilot tests were common 
(n  =26),  and  only  12  studies  described  randomiza-
tion into treatment. Most studies (n = 25) collected 
follow-up data at least 1 month after intervention.

DISCUSSION
The findings of this systematic review build on pre-
vious research identifying interventions that sought 
to  reduce  prejudice  and  stigma  against  sexual  mi-
norities  [55]  by  reviewing  evidence-based  inter-
ventions  addressing  experiences  of  stigma  among 
SGMs. Minority stress theory represents one of the 
most  widely  used  models  to  explain  health  dispar-
ities  experienced  by  SGM  populations  [8],  which 
highlights  the  need  for  interventions  to  both  con-
sider  and  directly  intervene  on  stigma.  The  more 
recent  integration  of  minority  stress  theory  with 
intersectionality  frameworks  expanded  the  under-
standing  of  how  stigma  related  to  multiple  mar-
ginalized  identities  may  uniquely  impact  some 
groups within the SGM community [10, 11]. Thus, 
we  sought  to  systematically  examine  the  extent  to 
which  such  minority  stress  and  intersectionality 
frameworks  were  used  to  develop  new  or  adapted 
interventions,  directly  intervene  on  stigma-related

SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS

processes,  and  examine  the  role  of  stigma  in  inter-
vention efficacy. Of the 37 distinct interventions, we 
identified all included stigma within the intervention 
content, though few considered stigma reduction as 
an intervention outcome, limiting our knowledge of 
how  effectively  these  interventions  reduce  stigma 
directly. Even fewer interventions examined stigma 
as a mechanism of intervention effects as predicted 
by minority stress theory [30, 53]. Few studies tested 
stigma  as  a  moderator  of  intervention  efficacy  [14, 
23,  37],  which  would  inform  how  individual  ex-
posure to stigma alters program efficacy.

Detailed  examination  of  studies  included  in  our 
review  provided  evidence  that  interventions  are 
now  including  diverse  types  (e.g.,  homonegativity, 
transgender  stigma,  and  bullying)  and  levels  (e.g., 
anticipated  and  enacted)  of  stigma  in  intervention 
content, indicating a nuanced understanding of the 
effects of stigma on SGMs. Despite designing inter-
vention content to address the role of minority stress 
and, in some cases, testing the efficacy of the inter-
vention in addressing stigma, few studies examined 
the mechanistic impact of stigma on intervention ef-
ficacy  as  either  a  mediator  or  effect  modifier.  The 
cultural appropriateness of the interventions was no 
doubt enhanced by considering the role of minority 
stress and stigma in the development of intervention 
content, though quantitatively assessing differences 
between  adapted  and  nonadapted  interventions 
is critical for better understanding the effect of ad-
dressing  stigma  in  intervention  success.  Few  inter-
ventions  addressed  structural  stigma  or  called  for 
meaningful  structural  change.  Future  intervention 
should consider the effect of stigma across multiple 
levels,  including  structural,  to  better  capture  the 
context within which SGM experience stigma [56].

Few interventions developed content designed to 
address  the  intersection  of  multiple  identities  and 
none quantitatively assessed stigma intersectionally. 
A  major  challenge  is  no  doubt  the  complexity  of 
capturing  and  analyzing  quantitative  intersectional 
data [10] and the relatively few validated measures 
of  intersectional  stigma  among  SGMs.  Moreover, 
the most prominent intersecting identities in the re-
viewed  interventions  were  SGMs  and  racial/ethnic 
identities, which highlights the need to consider not 
only racial/ethnic stigma and SGM stigma but also 
the  intersectional  stigma  experienced  uniquely  by 
those who are both SGMs and racial/ethnic minor-
ities. Intervention developers should address stigma 
at  intersections  of  multiple  marginalized  identities, 
many of which were evident in the SGM samples in 
the studies reviewed—such as gender, gender expres-
sion,  socioeconomic  position,  immigration  status, 
intellectual  and  physical  ability,  and  history  of  in-
carceration.  The  recent  development  in  intersec-
tional  stigma  measurement  facilitates  investigation 
of  mechanisms  mediating  the  association  of  inter-
sectional  stigma  with  health  outcomes  and  points 

to the need to consider diverse measurement across 
levels and intersections of stigma [57]. Interventions 
that do not adequately consider the interlocking sys-
tems of power and oppression, including structural 
stigma [56], may miss evidence of differential inter-
vention  efficacy  and,  ultimately,  risk  propagating 
health disparities for SGM subgroups with multiple 
marginalized identities.

Overall, the majority of SGM interventions pub-
lished  to  date  were  focused  on  HIV-related  out-
comes  among  sexual  minority  men.  Indeed,  more 
than  90%  of  participants  in  these  intervention 
studies  were  men.  Thus,  significant  gaps  remain 
in  addressing  the  wide  range  of  health  conditions 
among  diverse  SGMs.  Interventions  developed  for 
cisgender  women  and  gender-diverse  people  were 
uncommon  and  conclusions  of  effectiveness  were 
based on a much smaller subsample than interven-
tions  among  men.  With  extensive  evidence  of  di-
verse health disparities among subgroups of SGMs, 
both  research  and  funding  must  evolve  to  support 
intervention  that  addresses  broader  SGM  health 
issues, not just HIV among sexual minority men.

LIMITATIONS
There  are  several  limitations  of  the  current  review 
that are worth noting. First, the nature of the review 
necessitated  a  focus  on  published  literature,  which 
may exclude important, on-going and unpublished 
studies (e.g., null findings). It is possible that the con-
sideration of intersectionality may not be a primary 
aim of reviewed studies and, thus, was not promin-
ently described in reviewed papers. We also relied 
on a search of the literature using two databases, and 
it  is  possible  that  some  published  studies  were  not 
identified  despite  our  best  efforts.  Further,  studies 
of structural stigma may be framed within policy re-
search  rather  than  intervention  research  aimed  at 
enacting individual-level change.

CONCLUSIONS
Overall, many interventions focusing on SGM popu-
lations  have  taken  minority  stress  frameworks  into 
account  in  the  design  and  implementation,  mostly 
within  intervention  content.  Fewer  studies  have 
tested stigma directly as an outcome or as a mediator 
or  moderator  of  intervention  efficacy.  We  did  not 
identify  any  studies  that  took  an  explicit  quantita-
tive approach to examining the intersection of mul-
tiple  stigmatized  identities  within  the  intervention. 
The  literature  to  date  is  predominated  by  studies 
of  sexual  minority  men,  with  a  heavy  emphasis  on 
HIV and mental health and, thus, there is significant 
need to expand not just in considering intersectional 
identities  but  also  focusing  on  other  subsets  of  the 
SGM population and the full range of health needs 
for these groups. In addition to expanding the focus 
of  interventions,  novel  methodologies  are  needed 
to  expand  the  ability  to  quantitatively  consider
