Abstract 
Background  A large number of information and communication technology (ICT) based interventions exist for 
suicide prevention. However, not much is known about which of these ICTs are implemented in clinical settings and 
their implementation characteristics. In response, this scoping review aimed to systematically explore the breadth of 
evidence on ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in clinical settings and then to identify and 
characterize implementation barriers and facilitators, as well as evaluation outcomes, and measures.

Methods  We conducted this review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. A search 
strategy was applied to the following six databases between August 17–20, 2021: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Psy-
cINFO, Web of Science, and Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts. We also supplemented our search 
with Google searches and hand-searching reference lists of relevant reviews. To be included in this review, studies 
must include ICT-based interventions for any spectrum of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours including non-
suicidal self-injury. Additionally, these ICTs must be implemented in clinical settings, such as emergency department 
and in-patient units. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to prepare this full report.

Conclusion  This review presents several trends of the ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention implemented in 
clinical settings and identifies a need for future research to strengthen the evidence base for improving implementa-
tion. More effort is required to better understand and support the implementation and sustainability of ICTs in clinical 
settings. The findings can also serve as a future resource for researchers seeking to evaluate the impact and imple-
mentation of ICTs.

Introduction
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  reports  that 
there  are  over  700,000  annual  deaths  by  suicide  world-
wide  [1,  2].  Globally,  suicide  is  the  fourth  leading  cause 
of deaths for youth and young adults [1], and specifically 
it is the second in Canada and USA [3, 4], and the first in 
Australia [5]. As such, suicide prevention is a top global 
health priority [6]. Suicide is preventable with timely, evi-
dence-based interventions [2]. There are evidence-based 
interventions for suicide prevention, such as risk assess-
ment,  safety  planning  interventions,  and  follow-up  care 
[7, 8], all of which are delivered in clinical settings, such 
as emergency departments. We also recognize the impor-
tance  of  population-level  approaches  to  suicide  preven-
tion, such as gatekeeper training programs in schools [8]. 
However, clinical attention for suicide prevention cannot 
be  overlooked,  and  individuals  who  suffer  from  suicide 
ideation must receive clinical attention [9, 10].

A  review  published  in  2002  investigated  40  studies 
from the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Can-
ada, Finland, and Sweden and found that 33% of individ-
uals who died of suicide had contact with mental health 
services  in  the  year  before  death  and  20%  in  the  month 
before death [11]. Not much has changed since then, and 
we  continue  to  observe  missed  opportunities.  In  Can-
ada,  a  study  in  2014  examined  8,851  suicide  deaths  and 
found 50% of these individuals had visited an emergency 
department  in  the  year  before  death,  and  one  third  had 
died within the month of discharge [12]. This speaks to a 
critical opportunity for suicide prevention in clinical set-
tings, which will be the focus of this review.

Information  and  communication  technology  (ICT) 
[13]  or  eHealth  [14]  includes  a  wide  range  of  digi-
tal  tools  such  as  internet,  telemedicine,  and  mobile 
technologies.  In  this  review,  we  refer  to  ICTs  collec-
tively  as  technologies,  advanced  multimedia,  software 
programmes  and/or  telecommunications  that  allows 
efficient  communication,  management,  storage,  dis-
semination  and  exchange  of  information  [13],  and 
eHealth  refers  to  use  of  ICTs  for  health  [14].  There  is 
a  large  number  of  ICT-based  interventions  for  men-
tal  health,  including  suicide  prevention  strategies  [15, 
16]. For example, Rassy et al. identified 115 ICT-based 

interventions  for  suicide  prevention,  and  they  include 
web-based tools, online programs, and mobile applica-
tions [16]. Given the widespread use of technologies in 
this modern world, including mobile phones, ICTs have 
the  potential  to  improve  suicide  prevention  by  remov-
ing  geographical  barriers  and  increasing  access  and 
availability of evidence-based interventions [16]. Addi-
tionally,  ICTs  may  not  replace  clinical  encounters,  but 
it can be augmented to expand existing suicide preven-
tion care.

There  is  a  growing  body  of  evidence  for  the  effective-
ness  of  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  preven-
tion  [15,  17–21].  For  example,  Witt  et  al.  identified  14 
online  programs  and  mobile  apps  for  self-management 
of  suicide  ideation  and  concluded  with  some  evidence 
of  reductions  in  suicidal  ideation  associated  with  using 
these digital interventions [20]. Arshad et al. also identi-
fied 22 clinical trials of ICT-based interventions for sui-
cide prevention, which included online support tools for 
coping  skills  often  derived  from  a  well-established  cog-
nitive behavioural therapy and concluded with a favour-
able effect on reducing suicide thoughts [19]. Despite the 
clinical potential and a large number of available ICTs for 
mental  health,  clinical  integration  remains  limited,  and 
clinicians,  service  users,  and  hospitals  continue  to  face 
challenges to achieve sustainable adoption [22–24]. It has 
been  repeatedly  reported  that  implementation  of  ICTs 
rarely moves beyond feasibility trials or initial adoption, 
and sometimes ICTs are abandoned [25].

Healthcare  is  a  complex  adaptive  system,  which  is 
shaped  by  multiple,  constant  interdependent  interac-
tions  and  relationships  [26,  27].  When  complexities 
exist  related  to  care  settings  or  implementation  chal-
lenges,  the  less  likely  ICTs  are  to  be  adopted  and  sus-
tained  [25,  28].  As  such,  research  teams  are  required 
to  move  beyond  traditional  cause-and-effect  thinking, 
embrace  complexity,  and  examine  dynamic  processes 
inherent  within.  Specifically  for  mental  health  apps, 
there  was  a  recent  call  for  attention  to  complex  con-
texts  in  which  apps  are  being  implemented  [22].  It  is 
critical  to  prospectively  assess  determinants  of  imple-
mentation  and  then  strategically  develop  implementa-
tion strategies to match the contextual needs.

Efforts  are  needed  to  support  clinical  integration  of 
ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention as well as 
their spread and maintenance to ensure that useful ICTs 
are  reaching  people  who  are  in  need.  Currently,  the  lit-
erature  on  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  preven-
tion describes their characteristics and/or evaluates their 
effectiveness  in  reducing  suicide  behaviours  and  risks, 
but not much is known about clinical integration of ICTs 
[15–20].  For  example,  it  remains  unknown  how  many 
of  115  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  prevention 
identified by Rassy et al. have been implemented in clini-
cal  settings  [16].  Research  has  not  yet  comprehensively 
explored  evidence  on  ICTs  implemented  in  clinical  set-
tings and their implementation characteristics, including 
barriers and facilitators. Given the lack of successful clin-
ical integration of ICTs [22–24], this review was needed 
as a first step to inform implementation efforts for useful 
ICTs  for  suicide  prevention  in  clinical  settings.  Scoping 
reviews are suggested when researchers need to identify 
the  types  of  available  evidence  and  key  characteristics 
related to a concept rather than to perform a meta-analy-
sis to make practice recommendations [29, 30]. Further-
more, this review was needed to determine the range of 
studies  before  carrying  out  our  future  multi-phase  pro-
ject  to  develop  and  evaluate  implementation  strategies 
for  a  mobile  app-based  intervention  for  suicide  preven-
tion  in  clinical  settings.  As  such,  the  current  scoping 
review aimed to systematically explore the breadth of evi-
dence on ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention 
implemented  in  clinical  settings  and  then  to  character-
ize barriers and facilitators to implementation, as well as 
measures and outcomes reported in this body literature.

Research questions

To  achieve  the  research  aim  stated  above,  this  scoping 
review addressed the following questions.

1. What ICT-based interventions for suicide preven-
tion have been implemented in clinical settings?
1.1.  What  are  the  reported  barriers  and  facilitators 
to implementing these ICT-based interventions?
1.2.  What  are  the  reported  measures  and  outcomes 
of these ICT-based interventions?

Methods
This  review  followed  the  Joanna  Briggs  Institute  (JBI) 
methodology  [31,  32]  and  this  report  was  prepared 
following  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  System-
atic  reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  extension  for  Scoping 
Reviews  (PRISMA-ScR)  checklist  [33].  Our  a  priori 
protocol  has  been  previously  published  [34].  We  also 
the  Cochrane  Database  of 
searched  PROSPERO, 

Systematic Reviews and JBI Evidence Synthesis and Open 
Science  Framework  in  June-July  2021  and  identified  no 
ongoing systematic or scoping reviews on the same topic.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Population

All  clinicians  both  licenced  and  regulated  practition-
ers were considered for inclusion in this review. Various 
healthcare  professionals,  such  as  physicians,  nurses  and 
social  workers,  provide  direct  care,  and  they  are  often 
collectively  referred  to  as  ‘clinicians’  [35,  36].  Addition-
ally, unregulated clinical support team members and peer 
support  workers  were  considered  for  inclusion  because 
these roles are increasingly integrated into mental health 
care settings [37, 38]. This population criterion was rela-
tively  less  significant  than  the  context  criterion  because 
who  implemented  ICT-based  interventions  was  often 
part of the context.

Concept

This  review  considered  all  types  of  ICT-based  interven-
tions for suicide prevention. Routine care (i.e., treatment 
as  usual)  provided  via  virtual  platforms  or  telephones 
were  excluded  unless  an  ICT-based  intervention  was 
delivered  to  patients.  Therefore,  following  the  WHO’s 
definition  for 
interventions 
intervention,  ICT-based 
needed  to  assess,  improve  or  promote  service  users’ 
health  outcomes  [39].  Suicide-related  thoughts  and 
behaviours is an umbrella term that refers to a spectrum 
of  suicide  ideation,  communication,  behaviours,  and 
attempts with having any frequencies of suicidal thoughts 
with actual, undetermined, or no suicidal intent [40]. To 
be included, ICT-based interventions must be related to 
any sub-category of suicide-related thoughts and behav-
iours including non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Although 
NSSI  is  a  unique  phenomenon  from  actual  suicide 
attempt, we decided to include it because NSSI is one of 
the  risk  factors  for  future  attempt  and  suicide  [41,  42]. 
According to WHO, there are three levels of suicide pre-
vention:  1)  Universal,  2)  Selective,  3)  Indicated.  Univer-
sal strategies for suicide prevention work at a population 
level [1]. Selective prevention strategies target individuals 
who may not be currently expressing suicidal behaviours 
but  are  at  a  greater  risk  of  suicide  based  on  their  char-
acteristics  such  as  age,  sex  and/or  medical  history  [1]. 
Indicated  prevention  strategies  target  individuals  who 
are presenting active risk or early signs of suicide poten-
tial, such as suicide attempt [1]. ICT-based interventions 
for  any  levels  of  suicide  prevention  were  considered  for 
inclusion. Suicide prevention interventions in this review 
included, but were not limited to, suicide risk assessment, 
safety planning intervention and lethal means restriction

[7, 8]. Lastly, this review considered all ICT-based inter-
ventions that targeted patients of any age.

Context

All  hospitals  or  clinical  settings  were  considered  for 
inclusion. For this review, a clinical setting was defined as 
any context where clinician-patient interactions occurred 
in real-time. Therefore, who implemented the ICT-based 
intervention was part of the context. To be considered for 
inclusion,  ICT-based  interventions  needed  to  be  imple-
mented  and  initiated  in  clinical  settings.  Therefore,  this 
review excluded crisis services because they are first ini-
tiated  by  patients,  often  in  a  public  context,  which  we 
assumed to have different implementation characteristics 
compared to ICTs initiated in clinical settings. Addition-
ally,  there  has  already  been  a  systematic  review  investi-
gating effectiveness of crisis lines [43]. Self-support tools 
that patients can freely download from app stores or tools 
that involved self-referrals after reading public advertise-
ments were also excluded as these were being initiated in 
non-clinical settings. Further to this, studies focusing on 
the development of ICT(s) without implementation were 
excluded. See Table 1 for summary of eligibility criteria.

Search strategy

We worked with a health sciences librarian to develop a 
comprehensive search strategy to find relevant scholarly 

literature  in  several  bibliographic  databases.  This  scop-
ing review followed a three-step search strategy outlined 
in  JBI  methodology  [31,  32].  First,  a  librarian  devel-
oped  and  refined  a  draft  strategy  in  Medline,  then  ana-
lyzed text words and index terms contained in titles and 
abstracts of relevant articles as well as the subject head-
ings.  Second,  relevant  text  words  and  index  terms  from 
the  selected  articles  were  used  to  develop  a  full  search 
strategy.  Third,  the  search  strategy  comprised  of  all 
identified keywords and index terms was adapted for all 
included databases. This required iterative steps of revis-
ing and testing, and the final search strategies were peer-
reviewed  by  a  second  research  librarian  using  the  Peer 
Review of Electronic Search Strategy (PRESS) guidelines 
[44]. A librarian ran the search in the following databases 
on August 17–20, 2021: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Else-
vier),  CINAHL  (EBSCO),  PsycINFO  (EBSCO),  Web  of 
Science,  and  Library,  Information  Science  and  Technol-
ogy  Abstracts  (LISTA).  The  selection  of  the  listed  data-
bases was informed by consultation with a librarian, and 
they  provide  full  coverage  of  literature  likely  to  provide 
information specific to ICTs in clinical settings. All final 
search strategies are presented in Additional File 1.

Godin’s targeted Google search method [45] was used 
to locate additional eligible sources. First, we conducted 
ten  unique  Google  searches  with  combinations  of  key-
words  and  then  reviewed  the  first  ten  pages  of  each

search  results  to  identify  international  and  national 
health  services  websites.  Second,  we  hand-searched  rel-
evant  websites  identified  in  the  first  step  to  find  eligible 
sources.  These  two  steps  were  carried  out  in  incognito’ 
mode,  which  limited  the  impact  of  previous  search  his-
tory  on  new  results.  This  Google  search  was  comple-
mentary  to  the  database  searches  to  identify  additional 
sources  of  evidence  that  our  search  strategy  might  have 
missed.

Types of sources

All  research  study  designs  were  included  (e.g.,  quantita-
tive,  qualitative,  mixed  methods).  Although  study  pro-
tocols did not have empirical data, we included them to 
capture relevant details. Protocols tend to include details 
on  interventions  and  implementation,  such  as  interven-
tion  components,  implementation  plans,  implementa-
tion  blueprints,  and  discrete  implementation  strategies. 
Such information is useful characteristics to identify. Fur-
thermore, by including protocols, we can reflect upcom-
ing  trends,  such  as  the  most  used  research  designs  in 
the  upcoming  years.  Reference  lists  of  relevant  litera-
ture  reviews,  commentaries,  and  opinion  papers  were 
reviewed to identify additional primary studies that met 
our eligibility criteria. We also considered grey literature 
for inclusion, such as conference papers and reports from 
relevant health organizations. Sources had to be available 
in English, and no date parameters were applied.

Study selection

All  identified  citations  were  uploaded  into  Covidence 
[46]  and  duplicates  were  automatically  removed  by 
Covidence.  Two  reviewers  (HDS,  LS)  independently 
screened  titles  and  abstracts  against  the  eligibility  crite-
ria.  Next,  relevant  full-text  articles  were  retrieved  into 
Covidence  [46],  and  the  primary  (HDS)  and  secondary 
reviewers (KD, LS) independently assessed them in detail 
against the eligibility criteria. Reasons for exclusion were 
recorded at the full-text screening phase and reported in 
the  PRISMA  flow  diagram.  Any  discrepancies  between 
the  reviewers  (HDS  and  LS  or  HDS  and  KD)  at  each 
stage  were  resolved  either  through  discussion  or  by  a 
third reviewer (KD or LS). Scoping reviews generally do 
not require methodological assessment [32], thus critical 
appraisal was not conducted.

Data extraction

We developed an extraction tool in Covidence to capture 
characteristics  of  the  paper,  setting,  participating  clini-
cians,  implementation  strategies,  descriptions  of  ICT-
based  intervention(s),  patient  population,  barriers  and 
facilitators  to  implementing  ICTs,  and  reported  meas-
ures and outcomes. Three reviewers (HDS, KD, LS) first 

pilot-tested the extraction tool on three studies to iden-
tify  any  discrepancies  or  inconsistencies  prior  to  data 
extraction.  Each  person  extracted  the  same  three  stud-
ies  independently  using  the  extraction  tool.  We  initially 
proposed  to  pilot-test  the  extraction  tool  on  five  stud-
ies.  However,  after  testing  on  three  studies  for  calibra-
tion exercise, the team agreed that all relevant data were 
captured, so we decided to start independent extraction 
without  testing  on  two  more  studies.  Minor  changes  to 
the  original  extraction  tool  were  made,  such  as  extract-
ing the reported use of theories, models, or frameworks. 
The  primary  (HDS)  and  secondary  reviewers  (KD,  LS) 
independently extracted data using Covidence [46]. Any 
conflicts in data extraction were resolved either through 
discussion  between  the  two  reviewers  (HDS  and  LS  or 
HDS  and  KD)  or  by  a  third  reviewer  (KD  or  LS).  Final 
version  of  the  data  extraction  tool  is  included  in  Addi-
tional File 2.

Data analysis

Following  data  extraction,  we  characterized  extracted 
data  using  frameworks,  typology,  and  taxonomy.  First, 
identified ICT-based interventions for suicide prevention 
were  categorized  using  a  typology  for  e-Mental  Health 
created  by  the  Mental  Health  Commission  of  Canada 
(MHCC) [47]. Intervention descriptions were then char-
acterized  based  on  the  suicide  prevention  interventions 
category  adapted  from Wilson  [7]  and  Zalsman  [8],  and 
the WHO’s three levels of suicide prevention [1].

Second,  we  performed  directed  content  analysis  [48] 
using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [49, 50] and 
the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [51] to map 
clinician-reported  barriers  and  facilitators  to  imple-
menting  ICT-based  interventions. They  are  comprehen-
sive,  evidence-based  behaviour  frameworks  that  capture 
internal  and  external  influences  of  behaviour  change. 
The Capability, Opportunity and Motivation – Behaviour 
(COM-B) model within the BCW explains behaviours by 
describing  interactions  between  one’s  capability,  oppor-
tunity  and  motivation  [49].  TDF  is  a  14-domain  behav-
ioural framework that expands the COM-B [51], so when 
used  together,  TDF  allows  for  granularity  of  behaviour 
analysis  [52].  Furthermore,  benefits  of  using  BCW  and 
TDF  for  assessing  implementation  barriers  and  facilita-
tors have been previously documented across healthcare 
disciplines  [53–55].  Narrative  descriptions  of  reported 
barriers  and  facilitators  were  mapped  onto  the  COM-B 
and TDF.

Third, this review categorized reported measures and 
outcomes  of  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  pre-
vention.  Outcomes  were  categorized  as  either  imple-
mentation  outcomes  or  impact  outcomes  of  the  ICTs. 
Implementation  outcomes  were  further  categorized 

 Shin et al. BMC Health Services Research          (2023) 23:281

using Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework: 
(1)  Acceptability,  (2)  Adoption,  (3)  Appropriateness, 
(4) Feasibility, (5) Fidelity, (6) Implementation cost, (7) 
Penetration,  and  (8)  Sustainability  [56].  Impact  out-
comes or intervention outcomes were categorized into 
three  levels:  (1)  Patient,  (2)  Health  care  provider  (i.e., 
clinician),  (3)  Health  system.  Patient  level  impact  was 
further  categorized  into  patient-reported  outcomes 
(PRO)  [57],  patient-reported  experience  (PRE)  [58], 
and patient health outcomes (e.g., mortality) [59]. PRO 
comes from patients and often records patients’ view of 
their health status and condition [57]. Patients’ views of 
their own health can provide insight into the impact of 
an intervention [58]. In contrast to PRO, PRE measures 
patients’ perceptions and experiences of receiving care, 
providing  insight  into  the  quality  of  care  during  the 
intervention  and  the  process  of  care  [58].  Health  care 
provider  level  outcomes  include  conceptual  knowl-
edge  use  (i.e.,  proximal  practice  change),  instrumental 
knowledge  use  (i.e.,  observable  practice  change)  [60], 
and  other  provider-reported  experiences.  Examples  of 
conceptual knowledge use include levels of knowledge, 
and  examples  of  instrumental  knowledge  use  include 
rates  of  completed  assessments  [60].  Lastly,  system 
level  outcomes  include  resource  utilization  and  eco-
nomic  outcomes  such  as  cost  effectiveness,  and  read-
mission  rates  [59].  Additional  File  3  provides  the  full 
coding strategy with operationalized definitions.

The coding strategy was pilot tested on three studies 
by the primary reviewer (HDS), who has experience in 
qualitative  research.  Then  second  reviewers  (LS,  KD) 
who also have qualitative research experience reviewed 
the  coded  data  generated  by  HDS  to  identify  discrep-
ancies  and  ensure  consistency  in  coding.  LS  reviewed 
the  coded  data  for  barriers  and  facilitators  and  KD 
reviewed  the  categorized  outcomes.  LS  and  KD  each 
reviewed  half  of  the  coded  data  for  the  characteris-
tics  of  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  prevention. 
No  changes  were  made  to  the  coding  strategy  after 
pilot  testing,  and  the  primary  reviewer  (HDS)  coded 
the  rest  of  the  data.  Then  the  second  reviewers  (KD, 
LS) reviewed all coded data to verify HDS’s work. Any 
disagreements  between  the  reviewers  were  resolved 
through discussion.

Data summarizing and reporting results

We charted the data in a tabular form that aligns with the 
review questions and aim. We also produced descriptive 
numerical  summaries  of  the  quantitative  data  (i.e.,  fre-
quency counts) and graphical figures. We then provided 
narrative  summaries  to  accompany  these  presentations 
and addressed the review questions and aim.

Results
Our  database  searches  resulted  in  6,008  citations.  After 
duplicate  removal,  3,659  citations  remained  for  assess-
ment against the eligibility criteria. After screening titles 
and abstracts, 242 citations remained for full-text review, 
and we identified an additional 6 relevant papers through 
Google  searches  and  reviewing  references  of  relevant 
reviews.  This  review  included  a  total  of  75  citations, 
describing  70  studies  and  66  ICT-based  interventions. 
See Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flow chart which includes the 
reasons for excluding full-text articles.

Characteristics of included studies

Of  the  70  papers,  there  were  52  research  studies  and 
18  study  protocols.  There  were  five  protocols  of  com-
pleted  studies  (i.e.,  protocol-study  dyads)  [61–65].  Sev-
enty  studies  were  a  mix  of  experimental  design  (n = 22) 
[66–87],  observational  design  (n = 12)  [88–99],  qualita-
tive  design  (n = 3)  [100–102],  case  study  (n = 1)  [103], 
quality improvement report (n = 1) [104], and feasibility/
pilot  trial  (n = 31)  [105–135]  that  served  as  a  precursor 
to  a  larger  study. These  70  studies  originated  from  USA 
(n = 32) [69, 71, 73, 75, 76, 78, 81, 83, 88–90, 94–96, 98, 
103, 104, 106, 109, 112–116, 118, 120–122, 124, 125, 132, 
134],  France  (n = 8)  [68,  72,  77,  86,  87,  91,  92,  105],  UK 
(n = 8)  [84,  97,  101,  107,  108,  131,  133,  135],  Australia 
(n = 5)  [67,  85,  117,  126,  128],  Denmark  (n = 5)  [66,  82, 
100,  127,  130],  Canada  (n = 4)  [74,  93,  102,  111],  South 
Korea  (n = 2)  [99,  119],  Netherlands  (n = 1)  [129],  Iran 
(n = 1)  [80],  Sri  Lanka  (n = 1)  [79],  Japan  (n = 1)  [123], 
Spain  (n = 1)  [70],  and  Portugal  (n = 1)  [110].  Studies 
took place most commonly in out-patient clinical settings 
(n = 43) [66, 67, 69–71, 73, 75, 76, 82–88, 90–92, 94, 96, 
99–103, 105–107, 109–111, 114, 115, 117, 118, 123, 125, 
127, 129–132, 134], such as emergency departments and 
clinics,  then  in-patient  clinical  settings  (n = 14)  [77–80, 
93, 97, 98, 108, 113, 120–122, 128, 135], such as in-patient 
psychiatric units, and a mixture of both (n = 11) [68, 72, 
74,  81,  89,  95,  104,  116,  119,  124,  133].  The  remaining 
two  studies  were  conducted  in  mental  health  hospitals 
but  did  not  report  specific  clinical  setting  characteris-
tics  [112,  126].  Examples  of  involved  clinicians  included 
psychiatrists,  nurses,  physicians,  social  workers,  and 
behaviour health clinicians, such as psychologists. Lastly, 
there was a lack of reported theories, models, or frame-
works  (TMFs)  guiding  research.  Seven  studies  explicitly 
reported TMFs guiding their research [116, 118, 119, 124, 
129, 131, 135], including the User-Centered Design Prin-
ciples,  Proctor’s  Implementation  Outcomes  Framework, 
Theory  of  Planned  Behaviour,  Interpersonal  Psycho-
logical  Theory  of  Suicide,  Integrated  Motivational-Voli-
tional  model  of  suicidal  behaviour,  Medical  Research 
Council,  Process  evaluation  framework  for  analysis,  and

What ICT‑based interventions for suicide prevention have 
been implemented in clinical settings?

This  review  identified  a  total  of  66  ICT-based  interven-
tions  for  suicide  prevention  implemented  in  clinical 
settings.  Based  on  the  WHO  levels  of  suicide  preven-
tion  strategies,  identified  ICT-based  interventions  were 
used  as  universal  (n = 4),  selective  (n = 10),  or  indicated 
(n = 53)  strategies  for  suicide  prevention.  One  ICT  (i.e., 
Virtual  Hope  Box  app)  was  used  as  both  selective  and 
indicated  strategies  in  different  studies  [69,  88,  109]. 
While  most  ICTs  targeted  individuals  who  were  at  an 
imminent risk of suicide or were displaying early signs of 
suicide potential, fewer ICTs were used as selective strat-
egies  targeting  at-risk  populations,  such  as  veterans,  or 
patients  living  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus,  or 
cancer. A few ICT-based interventions were used as uni-
versal strategies aimed at population level, which may be 
explained by this review’s inclusion criteria being clinical 
context.

The  66  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide  preven-
tion  served  multiple  functions;  they  were  used  for  sui-
cide  screening  and  assessment  (n = 22),  safety  planning 
(n = 20),  lethal  means  restrictions  and/or  counselling 

(n = 3),  discharge  or  post-discharge  follow-up  care 
(n = 27),  therapy  such  as  dialectical  behavior  therapy 
(n = 4),  and  additional  resources  such  as  wellness  tips 
and  journals  (n = 18).  Other  (n = 12)  functions  of  ICTs 
included  reminders  to  appointments,  care  plans,  and 
peer  supports.  Following  the  MHCC  typology,  most  of 
the  ICTs  were  categorized  as  computerized  interven-
tions (e.g., web-based tools), resources, and applications 
(n = 55), of which 11 were text messages, 10 were mobile 
applications  (apps),  and  two  were  emails.  Other  types 
included  telehealth  and  telemedicine  (n = 16),  wear-
able  computing  and  monitoring  (n = 1),  virtual  reality 
(n = 2),  peer  support  through  social  media  (n = 2),  and 
a  robot  (n = 1)  (i.e.,  chatbot).  Table  3  summarizes  above 
characteristics  of  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide 
prevention.

Implementation strategies

Overall, there was a lack of reporting on the implementa-
tion strategies for the included ICTs. Of the 75 included 
papers,  31  reported  implementation  strategies,  but  the 
level  of  detail  varied.  Training  clinicians  (n = 15)  was 
the  most  commonly  reported  implementation  strategy 
for the new ICT, focusing on building new skills [62, 63, 
70, 71, 75, 95, 101, 110, 114, 115, 121, 127–129, 134]. A 
few  studies  specifically  reported  using  demonstration

[101] and simulation methods for training [115]. Educa-
tional  meetings  or  communication  (e.g.,  phone,  email) 
(n = 12)  was  the  next  common  implementation  strategy 
which  provided  clinicians  with  new  information  and/or 
instructions  required  for  the  ICTs  [73,  74,  84,  93,  101, 
104, 108, 114, 126, 128, 131, 135]. Education or training 
were  sometimes  accompanied  by  educational  materials 
(e.g.,  written  handouts  or  supportive  tools  like  a  pocket 
guide)  (n = 6)  [64,  73,  101,  110,  114,  131].  Training  and 
education  were  made  distinct  in  this  review;  training 
focused  on  building  practical  skills,  whereas  education 
focused  on  providing  new  information  or  knowledge. 
Eight studies reported collaborative initiatives with clini-
cians, Information Technology (IT) consultants, ministry, 
institutions  and/or  managers  [74,  91,  94,  95,  114,  123, 
124, 128]. For example, collaboratives initiatives involved 
nominating  site  staff  as  co-principal  investigators  [74], 
or  consulting  key  stakeholders  before  the  start  of  the 
study  [123].  Six  reported  providing  ongoing  supervision 
for using the ICT [63, 67, 71, 72, 104, 127], of which one 
study  specifically  conducted  audits  and  provided  daily 
reports to unit managers and nursing leaders [104]. Three 
studies  provided  opportunities  for  clinicians  to  partici-
pate  in  discussion  for  improvement  in  the  implementa-
tion  of  the  ICT,  contributing  to  iterative  changes  in  the 
implementation  process  during  the  study  [67,  95,  114]. 
Two  studies  reported  tailored  approaches  to  implemen-
tation; one created a new clinical workflow to ensure that 
the  implementation  was  seamless  and  minimized  inter-
ruptions  by  leveraging  existing  staff  roles  and  processes 
as  much  as  possible  [132],  and  the  other  provided  site-
specific  training  [62].  Lastly,  one  study  provided  onsite 
technical IT support [104].

What are the reported barriers and facilitators 
to implementing these ICT‑based interventions?

Overall,  there  was  a  general  lack  of  reporting  on  barri-
ers  and  facilitators  to  implementation.  Nineteen  studies 
reported several barriers and/or facilitators with a vary-
ing level of detail. Barriers and facilitators that were most 
frequently  reported  by  identified  studies  were  associ-
ated with physical (n = 12) or social (n = 10) opportunity 
within the COM-B/TDF. TDF domains for physical (i.e., 
external)  opportunities  include  environmental  context 
and  resources,  whereas  social  opportunities  include  the 
social  influences,  such  as  norms  and  cultural  factors 
[51].  Internet  instability  [134],  limited  telephone  lines 
[103],  lack  of  patients’  access  to  smart  devices  [107], 
time limited nature of clinical settings [76, 82, 102, 131], 
and no access to research teams to troubleshoot techno-
logical  issues  [108]  were  physical  barriers  described  in 
the  included  studies.  Other  physical  barriers  included 
administrative challenges such as hospital policy that did 

not  allow  patients  to  use  smartphones  in  the  in-patient 
settings  [93].  Therefore,  even  if  patients  had  their  own 
devices,  hospital  policy  or  the  discharge  norms  limited 
patients’  access  and  did  not  allow  enough  opportunity 
for clinicians to deliver the ICTs until the moment of dis-
charge. This not only speaks to physical barriers (i.e., hos-
pital  policy),  but  also  reflects  social  barriers  of  limiting 
ICT related interactions with patients [93]. Other barri-
ers  to  implementing  ICTs  related  to  social  opportunity 
included lack of engagement with clinicians in the study 
and lack of buy-in and support from the clinicians [128, 
131, 132]. Some of the facilitators were the direct oppo-
site  of  barriers.  In  contrast  to  lack  of  engagement  with 
clinicians, positive working collaborations between clini-
cians  and  the  research  team  facilitated  the  implementa-
tion  process  [62,  104,  108,  131].  For  example,  one  study 
had a hospital staff member in the role of principal inves-
tigator  at  each  study  site  [62].  Furthermore,  leadership 
engagement, such as manager approvals for implementa-
tion, facilitated ICT implementation, and some managers 
insisted  on  circulating  implementation  information  to 
clinicians via e-mail [131].

Reflective  (n = 14)  and  automatic  (n = 3)  motivations 
were  the  next  commonly  coded  barriers  and  facilita-
tors  in  this  review.  Motivation  encompasses  all  brain 
processes  that  direct  behaviour  [49].  This  includes  not 
just  reflective  motivation,  such  as  goals,  analytical  and 
conscious  decision-making  that  leads  to  behaviour,  but 
it  also  includes  autonomic  motivation  like  habits  and 
emotional responses [49]. Reflective motivation includes 
TDF domains of professional roles and identities, beliefs 
about consequences, beliefs about capabilities, optimism, 
intentions and goals [51]. Defining roles and responsibil-
ity  attributes  [108],  perceived  burdens,  and  uncertain-
ties associated with ICTs [76, 82, 131] were examples of 
barriers noted among the reflective motivation category. 
For  example,  clinicians  were  worried  about  ICT  devices 
being stolen or broken [108] and perceived that that the 
ICT  may  have  a  better  fit  in  other,  non-clinical  settings 
such as schools [131]. Clinicians also did not appreciate 
the  perceived  burdens  of  implementing  ICTs  because 
introducing  new  ICTs  possibly  created  new  tasks,  tak-
ing extra time in their usual clinical flow [76, 82]. When 
clinical  settings  included  multi-disciplinary  teams,  cli-
nicians  were  concerned  about  who  should  be  responsi-
ble  for  the  ICT,  but  identifying  appropriate  professional 
roles  and  having  designated  staff  for  the  new  ICT  were 
reported  facilitators  [78,  104,  108].  For  example,  one 
study  implemented  caring  emails  as  post-discharge  fol-
low-up care for suicide prevention and reported that the 
new  task  associated  with  this  ICT  could  be  reasonably 
done by existing hospital staff rather than hiring new staff 
[78].  Additionally,  they  reported  minimal  requirements

for  clinicians  to  manage  the  new  ICT,  which  facilitated 
implementation [78]. In contrast to uncertainties around 
ICTs,  perceived  benefits  and  usefulness  of  ICTs  were 
facilitators [102, 109]. Automatic motivation refers to the 
TDF domain of emotion [51]. Negative (“technophobia”) 
or  positive  outlook  about  the  ICTs  [102,  116,  131]  were 
identified as barriers or facilitators.

Implementation barriers and facilitators related to psy-
chological  (n = 14)  capabilities  were  the  least  frequently 
coded  category.  Psychological  capabilities  include  one’s 
knowledge,  memory,  and  ability  to  make  decisions  and 
regulate behaviours [54]. Identified papers reported bar-
riers  and  facilitators  related  to  the  knowledge  and  skills 
about  ICTs,  awareness  of  necessary  resources,  and  cli-
nicians’  cognitive  load.  For  example,  having  no  manual 
or  guidelines  to  instruct  clinicians  on  how  ICTs  should 
be  introduced  to  patients  and  used  for  suicide  preven-
tion treatment was a barrier [82, 107]. In contrast, train-
ing  resources  and  education  sessions  were  facilitators 
that  helped  to  build  clinicians’  psychological  capabili-
ties [104, 109, 116, 134]. Additionally, a few ICTs helped 
to  decrease  clinicians’  cognitive  burden  [116,  131].  A 
summary  of  the  COM-B/TDF  analysis  can  be  found  in 
Table 4, and a full breakdown of extracted and analysed 
data can be found in Additional file 4.

What are the reported measures and outcomes of these 
ICT‑based interventions?
As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  studies  reported  PRO  (n = 55),  PRE 
outcomes  (n = 31),  and  patient  health  outcomes  (e.g., 
mortality)  (n = 10).  Examples  of  PRO  included  assess-
ing patients’ suicide ideation, suicide risk, coping ability, 
depressive  symptoms,  and  health-related  quality  of  life 
using validated tools such as Beck Scale for Suicide Idea-
tion,  Patient  Health  Questionnaires,  Columbia  Suicide 
Severity  Rating  Scale,  and  Beck  Depression  Inventory. 
Examples  of  PRE  outcomes  included  assessing  overall 
experiences and perceptions of ICTs, patient satisfaction, 
engagement  with  ICTs  using  open-ended  survey  ques-
tions,  Likert-scale  surveys,  written  feedback,  or  inter-
views.  Patient  health  outcomes  such  as  mortality  and 
adverse  events  often  came  from  health  administrative 
data,  electronic  health  records,  or  insurance  claim  data. 
At health care provider-level outcomes, studies reported 
clinician  experiences  (n = 7),  clinicians’  instrumental 
knowledge  use  (n = 4),  such  as  number  of  documented 
referrals,  and  conceptual  knowledge  use  (n = 1),  such  as 
professional  knowledge  about  suicide.  Thirteen  studies 
reported health system-level outcomes such as readmis-
sion  rates  and  medical  costs.  Additionally,  eight  studies 
specified usage data as an outcome of interest.

Following  Proctor’s  definitions  for  implementation 
outcomes  [56],  studies  reported  feasibility  (n = 20), 

acceptability  (n = 14),  fidelity  (n = 10),  and  penetra-
tion  (n = 1)  of  the  ICTs.  Feasibility  outcomes  included 
perceived  compatibility  of  ICTs  in  the  clinical  set-
tings  or  practicality  of  ICTs  assessed  by  surveys,  open-
ended  questionnaires,  interviews  or  measuring  the  time 
required  to  complete  the  ICT-related  module.  Accept-
ability  of  ICTs  was  evaluated  by  user  experience,  per-
ception,  agreeableness,  or  satisfaction  using  surveys, 
open-ended  questionnaires,  or 
interviews.  Fidelity 
outcomes  included  the  completion  of  follow-ups  and/
or  adherence  to  treatments  using  chart  reviews  or  self-
reported data. Penetration was measured by the propor-
tion of people who attempted suicide and were enrolled 
in  an  ICT-based  intervention  (i.e.,  VigilanS)  relative 
to  all  included  samples  of  people  who  attempted  sui-
cide  regardless  of  their  enrollment.  None  of  the  studies 
reported  adoption,  appropriateness, 
implementation 
cost,  or  sustainability  outcomes  of  implementation.  See 
Table  5  for  summaries  of  the  outcomes  of  interest,  out-
come  measures,  measurement  tools,  and  key  results  of 
the 70 included studies.

Discussion
Summary of evidence

This  scoping  review  describes  characteristics  of  ICT-
based  interventions  for  suicide  prevention  implemented 
in  clinical  settings.  In  this  review,  we  identified  75 
papers  that  described  70  studies  and  66  ICTs.  Overall, 
the  review  findings  provide  detailed  characteristics  of 
the existing ICTs for suicide prevention implemented in 
clinical  settings.  We  also  identified  common  strategies 
for implementing these ICTs, related barriers and facili-
tators, as well as reported measures and outcomes of the 
included  ICTs.  The  findings  offer  insights  into  how  to 
better support the implementation of ICTs and highlight 
the important role of collaborative initiatives in providing 
both technical and social support to facilitate implemen-
tation of ICTs in clinical settings.

Characteristics of included studies

Most  of  the  included  studies  were  experimental  designs 
and feasibility trials, and there were 18 protocols, indicat-
ing that many studies are currently underway. Despite the 
growing evidence in this field, we found a lack of qualita-
tive evidence. This is a gap in the current literature, and 
future research should consider qualitative study designs 
to evaluate implementation and/or impact of ICT-based 
interventions  for  suicide  prevention  on  patients,  health 
care providers, and health systems. This is because clini-
cal practice within hospitals is an example of a complex 
adaptive  system  [26,  27].  Evaluating  and  understanding 
implementation of ICTs in complex systems will benefit 
from using qualitative or mixed-methods designs because

Fig. 2  Reported outcome types

quantitative methods alone cannot capture the complex-
ity  inherent  within  the  phenomenon  nor  can  it  unpack 
interplay  of  contextual  characteristics  that  influence 
implementation  and  impact  of  ICTs.  Efforts  are  needed 
to  move  beyond  traditional  effectiveness  trials  and  bet-
ter  understand  how  and  why  innovations  bring  change 
in  what  context  [136].  Qualitative  research  designs  can 
facilitate  benefits  of  unpacking  contextual  factors  (e.g., 
barriers  and  facilitators)  at  multiple  levels  (e.g.,  individ-
ual, system) and answering complex questions [137] that 
are integral to moving ICTs forward. Moreover, qualita-
tive  methods  alone  or  in  mixed-methods  designs  can 
confirm,  complement,  or  extend  quantitative  evaluation 
of effectiveness, providing explanatory knowledge [138].

Based on the paucity of TMFs identified in the include 
studies,  future  research  should  consider  using  TMFs  to 
guide  their  study.  Despite  the  clinical  potential  of  using 
mental  health  apps,  integrating  these  apps  into  routine 
practice  is  limited,  partly  attributable  to  a  lack  of  theo-
retical foundations and rigour in research for implemen-
tation  [23].  Future  research  can  benefit  from  leveraging 
TMFs  and  qualitative  and/or  mixed  methods  designs 
to  unpack  the  complexity  and  contribute  to  building  a 
rich  evidence  base.  Benefits  of  using  established  TMFs 
in  research  have  been  well  documented.  For  example, 
TMFs  can  help  researchers  consider  comprehensive  list 

implementation  outcomes 
[139–141].  Furthermore, 
TMFs  can  help  researchers  consider  a  complete  list  of 
determinants  for  implementation  during  the  planning 
phase  to  maximize  implementation  success  [139–141]. 
Implementation  is  a  known  determinant  of  interven-
tion  effectiveness  [56],  and  as  we  continue  to  face  chal-
lenges in moving ICTs beyond pilot trials, it is necessary 
to leverage TMFs to guide careful and purposeful imple-
mentation  that  accounts  for  the  complex  contexts  in 
which  ICTs  are  implemented  [22].  This  will  ensure  that 
implementation  strategies  are  systematically  selected  to 
address  barriers  in  the  local  context.  However,  it  is  dif-
ficult to know whether authors of the included studies in 
this review did not use TMFs or did not report TMFs. If 
it is a reporting issue, then researchers need to improve 
reporting on TMFs so we can learn how TMFs have been 
applied,  build  knowledge  base,  and  modify  TMFs  as 
necessary.

Implementation of ICTs in clinical settings

Thirty-one  studies  reported  implementation  strategies 
and  19  studies  reported  barriers  and  facilitator.  Despite 
the general lack of reporting details, useful insights about 
implementation supports can be drawn. Of the reported 
studies, education and training were the most commonly 
reported  implementation  strategies  for  the  ICTs. This  is

consistent  with  the  current  literature  for  implementa-
tion practice and knowledge translation [142, 143]. Edu-
cational meetings and training workshops are less costly 
and  more  accessible  to  support  implementation  than 
complex strategies requiring organizational-level change 
[144].  Therefore,  educational  meetings  and  training 
workshops  could  have  been  feasible  options.  However, 
barriers  related  to  psychological  capabilities  were  the 
least  frequently  coded  category  in  the  included  studies. 
It is important to note that improving clinicians’ level of 
knowledge and skills does not always lead to observable 
practice changes leading to successful implementation of 
innovations [145]. Therefore, we recommend strategically 
considering  diverse  types  of  implementation  strategies, 
other  than  education  and  training,  to  target  both  clini-
cian- and external-level barriers for a given context. Sec-
ondly,  collaborative  initiatives  were  the  next  commonly 
reported  strategy  for  implementation  identified  in  this 
review. While partnership approaches such as co-design 
are  common  for  innovation  development,  people  often 
think  that  implementing  what  has  been  designed  is  the 
responsibility of others [146]. This is not true; researchers 
can co-create changes in the workflow to support imple-
mentation  [147].  We  encourage  researchers  to  continue 
to leverage collaborative initiatives within their studies as 
they  can  foster  important  relationships  between  knowl-
edge users and researchers. This will allow researchers to 
focus  on  real-world  needs  and  facilitating  implementa-
tion efforts [148, 149].

Researchers  need  to  consider  the  complex  contexts  in 
which apps are being implemented [22]. As such, report-
ing details of implementation plans are strongly encour-
aged  to  advance  our  understanding  of  implementation 
processes and context. During implementation, the influ-
ence  of  context,  such  as  barriers  and  facilitators,  and 
interactions between them, are necessary to explain how 
or  why  certain  outcomes  are  achieved,  as  well  as  varia-
tions in outcomes across studies [150, 151]. Furthermore, 
implementation  is  a  known  determinant  of  intervention 
effectiveness,  and  barriers  can  significantly  reduce  the 
effectiveness  of  an  intervention  [56].  Not  knowing  con-
textual influences may limit the generalizability of study 
findings  to  different  settings.  In  response  to  the  general 
lack  of  reporting  details  identified  in  this  review,  we 
encourage  future  studies  to  consider  Proctor’s  recom-
mendations for specifying and reporting implementation 
strategies  [152]  and  the  Expert  Recommendations  for 
Implementing Change (ERIC) taxonomy for implementa-
tion strategies [153]. Furthermore, considering the itera-
tive  nature  of  the  implementation  process,  any  changes 
to original implementation plans are also encouraged to 
be reported. Future studies can consider the Framework 
for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications–Enhanced 

(FRAME)  to  guide  the  reporting  of  adaptations  and 
modifications to the design or delivery of an intervention 
[154].

It  has  been  reported  that  researchers  are  faced  with 
challenges  of  selecting  implementation  strategies  [155]. 
Furthermore, implementation strategies have often been 
mismatched to existing barriers [156, 157]. For example, 
a  review  of  20  quality  improvement  studies  found  that 
many studies utilized clinician-oriented (individual-level) 
strategies,  such  as  education,  to  address  organizational-
level  barriers  [156].  Similarly,  the  current  review  identi-
fied  that  the  three  most  reported  categories  of  barriers 
were  related  to  physical  opportunity,  social  opportunity 
and  reflective  motivation,  and  examples  included  poor 
internet  connection,  busy  clinical  settings,  lack  of  buy-
in  from  and  engagement  with  clinicians,  and  perceived 
uncertainties  around  ICTs.  However,  the  most  reported 
implementation  strategies  were  education  and  training 
support,  all  of  which  cannot  address  the  barriers  stated 
above. This is an example of missed opportunities and an 
area for future research efforts.

Guided  by  the  BCW,  we  can  identify  intervention 
options  that  can  address  the  barriers  identified  in  this 
review.  To  overcome  physical  opportunity,  Training, 
Enablement,  Environment  Restructuring,  or  Restriction 
are recommended [49]. To overcome social opportunity, 
Restriction,  Environment  Restructuring,  Modelling,  or 
Enablement  are  suggested  [49].  The  use  of  evidenced-
based theories like the BCW can improve the selection of 
implementation strategies and subsequent integration of 
ICTs  in  clinical  settings  [139,  141].  Additionally,  clinical 
practice  within  health  systems  as  well  as  human  behav-
iour are complex; it is not individual factors that facilitate 
implementation  of  a  new  innovation,  but  the  dynamic 
interaction  between  them  [28,  158].  Nonetheless,  the 
BCW  accounts  for  interactions  between  both  internal 
(i.e.,  capability,  motivation)  and  external  (i.e.,  opportu-
nity) factors that influence behaviour change [49]. Use of 
behaviour change theories will not downgrade the com-
plexity, but rather it can help researchers organize com-
plex data in a comprehensive way that is also accessible to 
work with. As such, we recommend future studies to use 
TMFs to guide the selection of implementation strategies 
to overcome existing barriers.

Consistent  with  the  current  review  findings,  other 
external barriers associated with implementing ICTs are 
related  to  limited  access  to  ICTs  and  internet,  and  digi-
tal  literacy  skills  [159].  Despite  the  widespread  use  of 
mobile  phones,  a  phenomenon  called  the  ‘digital  divide’ 
can  occur  due  to  social  equity  factors  such  as  educa-
tion,  income,  age,  and  urban/rural  residence  [160–162]. 
Digital  divide  refers  to  inequities  in  accessing  and  using 
ICTs as well as associated outcomes of using ICTs [162].

To  prevent  digital  divide  amplification  and  to  avoid 
unintended  harm,  implementation  efforts  for  new  inno-
vations  must  account  for  digital  equity  considerations 
[163].  However,  very  few  included  studies  considered 
equity concerns and provided patients with ICT devices 
[74,  101,  114,  134],  free  data  plans  [111],  or  options 
for  alternative  ICTs  (e.g.,  email  instead  of  texts)  as  per 
patients’ preferences [71, 133]. In contrast, several stud-
ies  made  ownership  of  ICT  devices  as  one  of  the  inclu-
sion criteria [61, 69, 78, 82, 85, 88, 102, 105, 111, 113, 120, 
128, 129, 131, 135], and one study excluded participants 
who  reported  difficulty  using  a  computer  [117].  This  is 
a critical area of future efforts for minimizing the digital 
divide. Van Dijk [164, 165], and Selwyn [166] recommend 
addressing  the  digital  divide  through  assessing  patient 
ICT  access,  use,  competence,  and  reasons  for  divided 
outcomes.  As  many  ICTs  are  rapidly  being  adopted  and 
implemented  for  suicide  prevention,  this  review  identi-
fied a lack of attention to equity-related considerations in 
the current literature. This highlights a critical direction 
for future research, as efforts are needed to prevent digi-
tal divide amplification and avoid unintended harm while 
advancing ICT use.

Reported measures and outcomes

We identified that studies of ICT-based interventions for 
suicide  prevention  reported  implementation  outcomes 
and/or  interventions’  impact  on  patients,  clinicians, 
and/or  health  systems.  Most  studies  reported  patient-
level outcomes, such as suicide risk and behaviours, and 
implementation  outcomes  of  feasibility.  However,  no 
studies reported long-term outcomes of implementation 
such as sustainability. This is a gap in the current litera-
ture, and future research should consider assessing long-
term outcomes, or at least should consider sustainability 
potential  beyond feasibility. The end  goal  of  implement-
ing  new  innovations  in  clinical  settings  is  routinization, 
achieving seamless integration of ICT use in routine clin-
ical flow [167]. Despite the promising clinical benefits of 
ICTs  for  suicide  prevention,  clinical  integration  remains 
limited  [22–24].  This  problem  is  consistent  across  ICTs 
in general. It has been repeatedly reported that ICTs are 
not  fully  implemented,  not  moving  beyond  pilot  trials, 
or  being  abandoned  [25,  168].  To  move  beyond  initial 
adoption  of  useful  ICTs,  we  encourage  future  research 
to  consider  sustainability  outcomes  early  on.  Proctor’s 
Implementation  Outcomes  Framework  [56]  and  the 
Reach,  Effectiveness,  Adoption,  Implementation  Main-
tenance  (RE-AIM)  [169]  are  example  tools  to  guide 
outcome  selections  related  to  implementation  and  sus-
tainability  of  interventions.  Several  studies  included  in 
this  review  measured  both  intervention  outcomes  and 
implementation outcomes in one study [67, 76, 80, 84, 89, 

91, 101, 106, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126–132, 
135].  Similarly,  future  research  can  benefit  from  lever-
aging  effectiveness-implementation  hybrid  designs  that 
have a dual focus of evaluating intervention effectiveness 
and implementation outcomes simultaneously [170, 171]. 
Hybrid  designs  are  encouraged  to  move  interventions 
to  the  real-world  more  rapidly  because  the  traditional 
research approach of keeping efficacy, effectiveness, and 
implementation  research  separate  and  sequential  slows 
down the process and overlooks complex contexts inher-
ent within [170, 171].

Limitations
Several limitations may affect the interpretation and use 
of our review findings. Many papers lacked detail on the 
barriers  and  facilitator  to  implementation,  which  made 
challenging to categorize them into the three overarching 
domains  of  capability,  opportunity,  and  motivation.  We 
conducted  directed  content  analysis  of  the  barriers  and 
facilitators, and we report the frequency counts of these 
barriers and facilitators. However, this may not be a com-
plete  list  of  barrier  and  facilitators  to  implementation. 
Additionally, the categories within the COM-B and TDF 
are not mutually exclusive; many barriers and facilitators 
interact with each other, and this is one of the underlin-
ing assumptions of the human behaviour [49].

Secondly,  our  search  strategy  was  limited  to  papers 
published  in  English.  This  may  partly  explain  our  find-
ing that most studies originated from North America and 
Europe. As shown in the Fig. 1, we excluded eight papers 
written  in  non-English  languages.  We  also  acknowledge 
that  our  search  strategies  may  not  have  captured  stud-
ies  conducted  in  low  and  middle-income  countries.  As 
a  result,  this  review  does  not  reflect  evidence  of  ICTs 
for  suicide  prevention  written  in  non-English  languages 
or  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  possibly  result-
ing in underrepresentation and/or underreporting of the 
authorship and the amount of literature.

include  ICT-based 

Third,  we  did  not 

interven-
tions  in  non-clinical  settings  such  as  schools.  There 
are  many  other  ICT-based  interventions  for  suicide 
prevention  that  exist  beyond  what  is  included  in  this 
review. Lastly, despite our comprehensive search strat-
egy,  which  included  varied  terms  to  describe  ICTs,  it 
is  possible  that  relevant  literature  was  not  captured. 
To  mitigate  this  limitation,  we  used  Google  search  as 
a  complementary  to  locate  additional  studies  that  our 
search strategy might have missed. We believe that our 
final  search  strategies  were  sensitive  enough  to  pro-
vide  full  coverage  of  relevant  literature  because  many 
papers  identified  during  the  second  step  of  Google 
search  were  already  captured  by  our  main  database 
searches. It is also important to recognize the inherent 

 Shin et al. BMC Health Services Research          (2023) 23:281 

Page 56 of 60

limitation of Google searches related to reproducibility 
of  results  [172].  A  researcher  from  a  different  country 
may receive different results with the same steps, which 
is why Google search was complementary to full search 
strategies and not used alone.

Conclusions
This  scoping  review  provides  a  comprehensive  over-
view of published literature on the ICTs for suicide pre-
vention  implemented  in  clinical  settings.  The  findings 
revealed  the  most  common  types  of  ICTs  for  suicide 
prevention, including apps, text messages, and telemed-
icine.  These  ICTs  were  commonly  used  as  a  targeted 
strategy  for  suicide  prevention  and  served  multiple 
functions,  including  suicide  screening  and  assessment, 
safety  planning,  and  post-discharge  follow-up  care. 
Additionally,  the  findings  revealed  that  the  most  com-
mon  strategies  for  implementing  these  ICTs  included 
education, training, and collaborative initiatives. How-
ever, barriers collectively influenced clinicians’ capabil-
ity, opportunity, and motivation to implement ICTs for 
suicide  prevention.  Therefore,  implementation  strate-
gies  must  be  tailored  and  multi-faceted  to  target  spe-
cific  barriers  in  a  given  context  in  order  to  facilitate 
implementation  efforts  for  ICTs  in  clinical  settings. 
Along with the lack of qualitative evidence in this field, 
the  lack  of  reporting  of  implementation  strategies  and 
related  barriers  and  facilitators  was  an  evident  gap  in 
this  body  of  literature,  highlighting  the  need  for  more 
explorative  research  and  a  call  for  better  reporting. 
Additionally,  the  lack  of  theoretical  frameworks  iden-
tified  in  included  studies  encourages  the  use  of  estab-
lished  TMFs  to  guide  future  work.  Lastly,  the  absence 
of  sustainability  outcomes  and  digital  equity  consid-
erations identified in the current literature highlights a 
critical direction for future research.
