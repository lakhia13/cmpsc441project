## Self-management for bipolar disorder


Bipolar disorder can make you feel like you have little control. However, there are lots of things you can do to manage your symptoms and improve your wellbeing.

This page covers how you can:

- Get to know your moods

- Take practical steps

- Look after your physical health

- Build a support network


### Get to know your moods


Learning how to understand your moods could help you find ways to manage them. These tips may help:

You might find it helpsto keep track of your moods over a period of time. You could try noting down mood patterns in a diary or on your phone.

Bipolar UK'strack your moodpage hasa mood scale and mood diary. They're free to use.

People assume that it's highly manic, highly depressive. And although there are episodes, it's not as easy to track as that.

You might find it helps to understand what can trigger changes in your mood. Triggers are different for different people. Some examples include:

- Feeling overwhelmed or busy

- Stressful periods

- Significant life events, like weddings, having a child or losing a loved one

- Periods of change or uncertainty

- Other physical or mental health issues

- Changes or problems with yourtreatment for bipolar disorder

It can help to recognise these patterns. Then you can take action to avoid the trigger or minimise its impact.

You may start to noticeapattern to how you feel before an episode. This could be changes in your:

- Sleeping pattern

- Eating patterns or appetite

Being aware that you're about to have a change in mood can help you make surethat:

- You have support systems in place

- You can focus on looking after yourself

- You're abletosharewarning signs withfamily and friends who can help you

I have to be careful how much social contact I have – too much can send me high. I have to start saying 'no' to demands.


### Take practical steps


These are some practical tips to help you manage the effects of bipolar disorder on your daily life:

Having a routine can help you feel calmer if your mood is high, motivated if your mood is low, andgenerallymore stable. Your routine could include:

- Day-to-day activities, such as the time you eat meals and go to sleep.

- Making time forrelaxation,mindfulness, hobbies and social plans.

- Taking anymedicationat the same time each day. This can also help you manage side effects and make sure there's a consistent level in your system.

I have an alarm set on my phone so I take my meds at the same time every day.

Stress can triggermood episodes. There are lots of things you can try which might help you to:

- Look after yourself when you feel stressed

For more information, see our pages onmanaging stress.

It can be very scary and stressful when your finances feel out of control. If you're struggling, try talking to someone you trust about practical steps you can take. There are also organisations that may be able to help.

- Contact theNational Debtlinefor free financial advice, without judgement.

- Read money and debt guidance fromBipolar UKandCitizens Advice.

- Use the freeSupport Hub toolon the Experian website to tell services about how your mental health impacts you. You can use it to ask for support, like spending restrictions on bank accounts.

For more information,see our pages onmoney and mental health,financial decisions and capacityandclaiming benefits.

When you're in the middle of a crisis,it can be difficult totell peoplewhat kind ofsupportyou'dfind most helpful.While you're well, it can be useful to make a plan for how you want to be treatedwhen you'reunwell.

For more information, see our pages oncrisis services.


### Look after your physical health


Taking care of our physical health can often help to support our mental wellbeing. Here are some tips to manage your health:

For lots of us with bipolar disorder, disturbed sleep can be both a trigger and a symptom of episodes. Getting enough sleep can help you keep your mood stable or shorten an episode.

For more information, see our pages oncoping with sleep problems.

Eating a balanced and nutritious diet can help you feel well, think clearly and calm your mood.You can read morein thisblog on Bipolar UK.

Gentle exercise, like yoga or swimming, can help you relax and manage stress.Regular exercise can help by:

- Using up energy when you're feeling high

- Releasing endorphins– the'feel-good' chemicals in the brain–when you're feeling low

For more information, see our pages onphysical activity.

The trick for me is not to be seduced by the 'high' and to look after myself – get enough sleep, good nutrition.


### Mental health apps


There are lots of wellbeing apps out there. Some could help you feel calmer, and help manage difficult symptoms.

But it's hard to know which ones are worth trying. So we've created theMind app librarywhere you can find safe, trustworthy apps.

### Build a support network


Building a support network could help to manage your mood. This might include friends, family or other people in your life who you trust and can talk to. The kind of support they can offer includes:

- Being able to recognise signs that you may be experiencing amood episode.

- Helping you look after yourself by keeping a routine or a healthy diet.

- Listening and offering their understanding.

- Helping you reflect on and remember what happened during a manic episode.

- Helping youplan for a crisis.

Try to tell those around you what you find helpful and what you don't find helpful. For example, you can agree together what things you'd like their help with and what you would like to manage by yourself.

When I tip the balance by going too high or low, I approach people for support.

Connecting with people who have similar or shared experiences of bipolar disorder can be really helpful. You could try talking to other people to share your feelings, experiences and ideas for looking after yourself. For example:

- Mind.ContactMind's Infolineorvisitalocal Mindto see what support is in your area.

- Online forums.Try an online peer support community, such asMind's Side by SideandBipolar UK's eCommunity.

- Local groups.Find a local support group. You could useBipolar UK's support group search.

- Recovery colleges.Checkif your local area has a recovery college. Recovery colleges offer courses about mental health and recovery in a supportive environment. You can find local providersfromMind Recovery Net.

If you're seeking peer support on the internet, it's also important toknow how to stay safe online.

No two people's experience is the same but there's a peace and joy in not having to explain. Of shared understanding. Of coming home.
