Both social isolation and loneliness are associated with increased
mortality, but it is uncertain whether their effects are independent
or whether loneliness represents the emotional pathway through
which social isolation impairs health. We therefore assessed the
extent to which the association between social
isolation and
mortality is mediated by loneliness. We assessed social isolation
in terms of contact with family and friends and participation in
civic organizations in 6,500 men and women aged 52 and older
who took part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing in
2004–2005. A standard questionnaire measure of loneliness was
administered also. We monitored all-cause mortality up to March
2012 (mean follow-up 7.25 y) and analyzed results using Cox pro-
portional hazards regression. We found that mortality was higher
among more socially isolated and more lonely participants. How-
ever, after adjusting statistically for demographic factors and
baseline health, social isolation remained signiﬁcantly associated
with mortality (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.08–
1.48 for the top quintile of isolation), but loneliness did not (haz-
ard ratio 0.92, 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.78–1.09). The association
of social isolation with mortality was unchanged when loneliness
was included in the model. Both social isolation and loneliness
were associated with increased mortality. However, the effect of
loneliness was not independent of demographic characteristics or
health problems and did not contribute to the risk associated with
social
isolation. Although both isolation and loneliness impair
quality of life and well-being, efforts to reduce isolation are likely
to be more relevant to mortality.

Social relationships are central to human well-being and are

critically involved in the maintenance of health (1, 2). Social
isolation is an objective and quantiﬁable reﬂection of reduced so-
cial network size and paucity of social contact. It is a particular
problem at older ages, when decreasing economic resources, mo-
bility impairment, and the death of contemporaries conspire to
limit social contacts. Socially isolated individuals are at increased
risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (3), infectious
illness (4), cognitive deterioration (5), and mortality (6–9). Social
isolation also has been associated with elevated blood pressure,
C-reactive protein, and ﬁbrinogen (10, 11) and with heightened
inﬂammatory and metabolic responses to stress (12, 13).

Loneliness often is regarded as the psychological embodiment
of social isolation, reﬂecting the individual’s experienced dissat-
isfaction with the frequency and closeness of their social contacts
or the discrepancy between the relationships they have and the
relationships they would like to have (14). Loneliness itself has
been linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
mortality (15–18), elevated blood pressure and cortisol (19–21),
heightened inﬂammatory responses to stress (22, 23), and mod-
iﬁcations in transcriptional pathways linked with glucocorticoid
and inﬂammatory processes (24).

A key scientiﬁc question is whether social isolation and loneli-
ness are two independent processes, each contributing to health
risk, or whether the emotional state of loneliness, through its bi-
ological concomitants, provides a mechanism through which so-
cial isolation affects health. Previous studies have yielded mixed
results (18, 25–27). The issue is important because its answer will
help identify the most effective levers for change and the best

approaches for support of older people. The purpose of our study
was to investigate the associations of social isolation and loneliness
with mortality in a representative national sample of older men and
women and to test whether loneliness is partly responsible for the
association between social isolation and mortality.

Results

We carried out these analyses on 6,500 men and women who
participated in wave 2 of the English Longitudinal Study of
Ageing (ELSA) in 2004–2005 (28), tracking mortality until March
2012. We deﬁned social isolation and loneliness as having a score
within the top quintile, so for the purposes of Cox regression
modeling we compared participants with high (18.5%) and low/
average (81.5%) scores on our social isolation index and high
(18.1%) and low/average (81.9%) loneliness scores on the short
form of the Revised University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) loneliness scale (29). The characteristics of the high and
low/average social isolation and high and low/average loneliness
groups are summarized in Table 1. There were no sex differences
in social isolation, but isolated individuals were more likely to be
older and unmarried with limited education and lower wealth.
Social isolation also was associated with limiting longstanding
illnesses such as chronic lung disease, arthritis, impaired mobil-
ity, and depressive symptoms. Loneliness was more common in
women and was associated with older age, less education, and
lower wealth and marital status in the same way as social iso-
lation. It was associated with a greater range of health conditions
than social isolation, including coronary heart disease (CHD),
stroke, and clinical depression, although the prevalence of these
conditions was low. Loneliness ratings averaged 4.06 ± 1.47,
similar to levels described in comparable studies in the United
States (26). Social isolation and loneliness were positively cor-
related (ρ = 0.10, P < 0.001).

We found that 918 (14.1%) of the 6,500 participants in ELSA
had died by the census date, with a higher rate among men than
women (16.3 vs. 12.3%, P < 0.001). Both social isolation and
loneliness were associated with all-cause mortality; the absolute
proportions of deaths were 21.9 vs. 12.3% in the high and low/
average isolation groups and 19.2 vs. 13.0% in the high and low/
average loneliness groups, respectively.

Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that, after adjust-
ment for age and sex, the hazards ratio (HR) for mortality was
1.50 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.30–1.73, P < 0.001] in the
high social isolation group (Table 2). Adjustment for demographic

factors including marital status reduced the strength of this asso-
ciation by around 36% (model 2), with a further reduction of 12%
when baseline health status and depression were taken into account
(model 3). Nevertheless, the HR remained highly signiﬁcant (1.26,
95% CI, 1.07–1.48, P = 0.005). This result indicates that the mor-
tality risk of social isolation is caused partly by social disadvantage
or poor health, but much of the association remains unexplained.
Adding loneliness to the model did not reduce the HR for social
isolation, and there was no interaction between social isolation and
loneliness. In the fully adjusted model, other signiﬁcant predictors
of mortality were being older, male, less wealthy, having a limiting
longstanding illness, cancer, or CHD at baseline, mobility im-
pairment, and depressive symptoms (Table S1 shows the full
regression model). We tested sex differences in these patterns

by adding the two-way social isolation by sex interaction (HR 0.85,
95% C.I. 0.64–1.14, P = 0.27), but the effect was not signiﬁcant.
The age- and sex-adjusted HR for loneliness was signiﬁcant
(1.26, 95% CI, 1.08–1.46, P = 0.003) but was reduced to non-
signiﬁcance when demographic factors were included (model 2,
Table 3). The association was attenuated further after baseline
health and mobility were included in the model (HR 0.92, 95% CI,
0.78–1.09, P = 0.34), suggesting that social disadvantage and con-
current health problems largely account for the relationship be-
tween loneliness and mortality. There was no signiﬁcant interaction
between loneliness and sex (HR 0.93, 95% CI, 0.68–1.26, P = 0.63).
We carried out two sensitivity analyses. The ﬁrst tested the
reverse causality hypothesis, that serious illness presaging early
death had preceded the measurement of social isolation and
loneliness, by repeating the analysis after excluding all fatalities

in the ﬁrst 24 mo after baseline. The results are comparable to
those in the main analysis (Table S2). The HR for social isolation
remained signiﬁcant in the fully adjusted model (1.33, 95% CI,
1.11–1.58, P = 0.002).

Our second sensitivity analysis tested social

isolation and
loneliness as continuous variables, instead of the categories used
in the Cox regression. The results were unchanged from those in
the categorical analyses, with an adjusted odds ratio of death of
1.26 (95% CI 1.13–1.41, P < 0.001) for every unit increase in
social isolation and no signiﬁcant relationship with loneliness
(odds ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.94–1.06, see Table S3).

Discussion

We found that both social isolation and loneliness predicted
mortality over 7 y of follow-up in a national sample of older men
and women. The association between social isolation and mor-
tality remained strong after demographic factors and baseline
health and mobility had been taken into account in multivariable
models, but the association between loneliness and mortality was
largely accounted for by baseline mental and physical health.
There were no signiﬁcant sex differences in these ﬁndings.

Our results indicate that loneliness did not affect the in-
dependent association between social isolation and mortality, and
this conclusion was unchanged when deaths during the ﬁrst 2 y
after baseline were excluded. This ﬁnding suggests that the sub-
jective experience of loneliness—often thought to be the psy-
chological manifestation of social isolation—is not the primary
mechanism explaining the association between social isolation
and mortality in this study.

The levels of loneliness in this sample were comparable with
those reported in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the
United States using the same measure (26). As in other older
samples, loneliness tended to be higher in women and in those
from more disadvantaged circumstances (30). It is notable that
loneliness was more strongly related to baseline poor health than
was social isolation, particularly with respect to arthritis, mobility
impairment, and depression (Table 1). Our ﬁnding that loneliness
no longer was associated with mortality after covariates had been
taken into account likely reﬂects its relationship with baseline
health. The result is consistent with previous studies. In the HRS,
loneliness predicted all-cause mortality over a 6-y period in-
dependently of demographic factors and health behaviors, but
associations no longer were signiﬁcant after baseline health,
functional limitations, and depressive symptoms were taken into
account (26). Similarly in a sample of older people in Japan, the
association of loneliness with mortality was mediated through
linkage with chronic disease and functional impairment (31).
These results do not imply that loneliness is not important but
rather indicate that the experience of loneliness may be charac-
teristic of people who already have major health and mobility
problems. They also suggest that the health implications of
loneliness may be overestimated if studies do not take account of
the strength of objective social connections (17, 18).

If emotional processes indexed by loneliness do not explain
the adverse effects of social isolation on survival, alternative

mechanisms need to be investigated. Lifestyle may be relevant
(11), including habitual health-risk behaviors such as smoking,
inactivity, and unhealthy diets and health-protective behaviors
such as adherence to medical recommendations, all of which may
be vulnerable to lack of social support. In addition, people who
live alone or lack social contacts may be at increased risk of
death if acute symptoms develop, because there is less of a net-
work of conﬁdantes to prompt medical attention (9). Social
contact itself also may have speciﬁc biological consequences that
are important for health maintenance (10–13).

It should be noted that our analysis of continuously distributed
social isolation and loneliness ratings produced ﬁndings similar
to those involving high isolation and loneliness groups. This
similarity suggests that the associations reﬂect variations in risk
across the full spectrum of social connectedness rather than
a phenomenon limited to individuals who are extremely isolated
or lonely. Social isolation is a growing problem among middle-
aged and older people. In 2011, people living alone comprised
28% of all households in the United States, compared with 17%
in 1970 (32). The proportion of Americans who said they had no
one to talk to about important matters increased from 10% in
1985 to 25% in 2004 (33), and in the 2010 European Social
Survey, 27% of respondents aged 50 y and over met friends,
relatives, or colleagues once a month or less (34). Between 1996
and 2012, the proportion of people aged 45–64 y who lived alone
in England and Wales rose by 53% (35).

One concern in all observational studies is reverse causality;
i.e., that social isolation may be more common in people who are
critically ill, and that the mortality is higher because of the
greater proportion of illness, not because of social isolation. This
possibility cannot be ruled out completely, but we repeated the
analysis excluding deaths within 24 mo of baseline, and the
results were very similar results to those for the full cohort,
suggesting that existing terminal illness is not the primary ex-
planation. However, it is possible that some other unmeasured
factors were responsible for the ﬁndings.

The strengths of this analysis include the use of a large rep-
resentative population cohort in which it was possible to control
for multiple health and demographic indicators. We also were
able to construct a comprehensive social isolation index that
included contacts with friends, relatives, and family as well as
civic participation. The primary limitation is that it is not possible
to draw causal conclusions from an observational study of this
kind. Although the response rate was high, nonresponders in
wave 2 of ELSA tended to be older and less well educated (28).
We gave equal weight to different aspects of social contact in
these analyses, but some social relationships may be more im-
portant to future health than others.

The ﬁndings of this study conﬁrm that social isolation is associ-
ated with higher mortality in older men and women but indicate that
this effect is independent of the emotional experience of loneliness.
Reducing both social isolation and loneliness are important for
quality of life and well-being, but efforts to reduce isolation would be
likely to have greater beneﬁts in terms of mortality.

Materials and Methods
Participants. The data analyzed in this study are from a population-based
cohort study involving 6,500 men and women who took part in wave 2 of the
ELSA in 2004–2005. The ELSA is a longitudinal panel study of men and women
aged 50 y or more living in England that started in 2002, with the sample
being drawn from households that previously had participated in the Health
Survey for England in 1998, 1999, and 2001 (28). Comparisons of the socio-
demographic characteristics of participants with the national census show
that at baseline the sample was representative of the English population.
Participants are reassessed every 2 y. Social isolation was measured in wave 1,
but loneliness assessments were introduced in wave 2, so wave 2 was used as
the baseline for these analyses. The response rate in wave 2 was 81.5% of
eligible participants. Ethical approval for ELSA was given by the National
Research Ethics Service. All-cause mortality up to March 2012 was supplied by
the National Health Service central data registry for all participants who
consented to mortality follow-up (96.5%). The mean follow-up period was
7.25 y ± 2.8 mo.

Measures of Social Isolation and Loneliness. We created an index of social
isolation by assigning one point if the respondent was unmarried/not
cohabiting, had less than monthly contact (including face-to-face, telephone,
or written/e-mail contact) with each of children, other family members, and
friends, and if they did not participate in organizations such as social clubs or
residents groups, religious groups, or committees (11). Scores ranged from
0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater social isolation. We measured
loneliness with the three-item short form of the Revised UCLA loneliness
scale (29). An example of an item is “How often do you feel you lack com-
panionship?” with response options of hardly ever or never, some of the
time, and often. Ratings were summed to produce a loneliness score ranging
from 3 to 9, with a higher score indicating greater loneliness. Both social
isolation and loneliness were positively skewed, so for the purpose of Cox
regression modeling we deﬁned the top quintile (≥2 for social isolation and
≥6 for loneliness) as isolated or lonely respectively. Allowing for ties, this
resulted in 1,231 isolated and 5,269 nonisolated respondents and 1,175
lonely and 5,325 nonlonely participants. In sensitivity analyses, we used
continuous scores of social isolation and loneliness to check whether asso-
ciations were linked to extreme scores.

Other Measures. We indexed socioeconomic status by total household wealth,
including ﬁnancial wealth, the value of any home and other property, the
value of business assets, and physical wealth such as artwork and jewelry, net
of debt. Wealth is a robust indicator of socioeconomic circumstances and
standard of living in ELSA (36) and was divided into age-related quintiles for
the purposes of analysis. Educational attainment was divided into three
categories: no formal qualiﬁcations, intermediate (equivalent to junior high
school and high school), and higher education (college education). Marital
status was classiﬁed into married or equivalent versus other (never married,
divorced, separated, widowed). Ethnicity was categorized as white or other.
We assessed general health by asking participants if they suffered from one
or more long-standing illnesses and if these illnesses limited daily activities.
The two questions were combined to form a dichotomous variable, in-
dicating whether participants suffered from any limiting long-standing

illness. We also asked respondents whether they had a physician diagnosis of
CHD, cancer, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, or chronic lung disease. Because
depression is a risk factor for mortality from common serious illness (37–39)
and also is associated with social isolation and loneliness, it was included as
an additional covariate. We recorded physician diagnoses of depressive ill-
ness, and depressive symptoms were measured using the eight-item Centre
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), as used extensively in
ELSA, the HRS, and other population cohorts (40). The item on loneliness was
omitted from the CES-D to avoid direct overlap with the loneliness scale (41);
however, the same results emerged when this item was included. A binary
variable was created with respondents reporting three or more symptoms
being classiﬁed as depressed. Mobility impairment was also included as a
covariate, because it might increase social isolation and loneliness. Respon-
dents were asked whether they had difﬁculties with 10 common leg and arm
functions (e.g., walking 100 yards, lifting more than 10 pounds). We ana-
lyzed mobility impairment as a binary variable (present, absent). Similar
results emerged when depressive symptoms and the number of impairments
were included as continuous variables.

Statistical Analysis. The characteristics of participants low/average and high in
social isolation and low/average and high in loneliness were compared using
χ2 tests. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate
the HRs of all-cause mortality and 95% CIs associated with social isolation,
using the low/average isolation group as the reference category. Survival
time was measured in months from the date of interview to the date of
death or to follow-up in March 2012. We ﬁtted four models. Model 1 was
adjusted for age and sex. We added demographic factors (wealth, educa-
tion, marital status, and ethnicity) to model 2. In model 3, we added health
indicators at baseline, including limiting longstanding illness, cancer, CHD,
stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and chronic lung disease, indicators of depression
(speciﬁcally CES-D score and diagnosis of depression), and baseline mobility
impairment. Loneliness was added to model 4. We also tested whether the
association of social isolation with mortality differed in men and women by
adding appropriate interaction terms into the models, but the interactions
were not signiﬁcant so results stratiﬁed by sex are not presented. Similar
modeling was carried out for loneliness, using the low/average loneliness
group as the reference category.

We carried out two sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the Cox re-
gression analyses after excluding deaths that occurred within 24 mo of
baseline, to guard against the possibility that associations were caused by
individuals having become isolated or lonely as a consequence of illness.
Second, we tested whether similar results would be observed if social iso-
