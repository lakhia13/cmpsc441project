Why can some people form deep, secure connections while others struggle to trust or fear getting close? Attachment theory focuses on relationships and bonds (particularly long-term) between people, including between a parent and child and between romantic partners. It is a psychological explanation for the emotional bonds and relationships between people.

This theory suggests that people are born with a need to forge bonds with caregivers. These early bonds set the foundation for later relationships and continue to influence attachments throughout life.


## History of the Attachment Theory


How psychologists think about the earliest relationships has changed over the years.British psychologist John Bowlbywas the first attachment theorist. He described attachment as a "lasting psychological connectedness between human beings."Bowlby was interested in understanding the anxiety and distress that children experience when separated from their primary caregivers.

Thinkers like Freud suggested that infants become attached to the source of pleasure. Infants, who are in the oral stage of development, become attached to their mothers because they fulfill their oral needs.

Some of the earliestbehavioral theoriessuggested that attachment was simply a learned behavior. These theories proposed that attachment was merely the result of the feeding relationship between the child and the caregiver. Because the caregiver feeds the child and provides nourishment, the child becomes attached.

Bowlby observed that feedings did not diminish separation anxiety.Instead, he found that attachment was characterized by clear behavioral and motivation patterns. When children are frightened, they seek proximity from their primary caregiver in order to receive both comfort and care.


## Understanding How Attachment Works


Attachment is an emotional bond with another person. Bowlby believed that the earliest bonds formed by children with their caregivers have a tremendous impact that continues throughout life. He suggested that attachment also serves to keep the infant close to the mother, thus improving the child's chances of survival.

Bowlby viewed attachment as a product ofevolutionary processes.While the behavioral theories of attachment suggested that attachment was a learned process, Bowlby and others proposed that children are born with an innate drive to form attachments with caregivers.

Throughout history, children who maintained proximity to an attachment figure were more likely to receive comfort and protection and, therefore, more likely to survive to adulthood. Through the process of natural selection, a motivational system designed to regulate attachment emerged.

The central theme of attachment theory is that primary caregivers who are available and responsive to an infant's needs allow the child to develop a sense of security. The infant learns that the caregiver is dependable, which creates a secure base for the child to then explore the world.

So what determines successful attachment? Behaviorists suggest that it was food that led to forming this attachment behavior, but Bowlby and others demonstrated that nurturance and responsiveness were the primary determinants of attachment.


## Ainsworth's "Strange Situation"


In her research in the 1970s,psychologist Mary Ainsworthexpanded greatly upon Bowlby's original work. Hergroundbreaking "strange situation" studyrevealed the profound effects of attachment on behavior. In the study, researchers observed children between the ages of 12 and 18 months as they responded to a situation in which they were briefly left alone and then reunited with their mothers.

Based on the responses the researchers observed, Ainsworth described three major styles of attachment: secure attachment, ambivalent-insecure attachment, and avoidant-insecure attachment. Later, researchers Main and Solomon (1986) added a fourth attachment style called disorganized-insecure attachment based on their own research.

A number of studies since that time have supported Ainsworth's attachment styles and have indicated that attachment styles also have an impact on behaviors later in life.


## Maternal Deprivation Studies


Harry Harlow'sinfamous studies on maternal deprivationand social isolation during the 1950s and 1960s also explored early bonds. In a series of experiments, Harlow demonstrated how such bonds emerge and the powerful impact they have on behavior and functioning.﻿﻿

In one version of his experiment, newborn rhesus monkeys were separated from their birth mothers and reared by surrogate mothers. The infant monkeys were placed in cages with two wire-monkey mothers. One of the wire monkeys held a bottle from which the infant monkey could obtain nourishment, while the other wire monkey was covered with a soft terry cloth.

While the infant monkeys would go to the wire mother to obtain food, they spent most of their days with the soft cloth mother. When frightened, the baby monkeys would turn to their cloth-covered mother for comfort and security.

Harlow's work also demonstrated that early attachments were the result of receiving comfort and care from a caregiver rather than simply the result of being fed.


## The Stages of Attachment


Researchers Rudolph Schaffer and Peggy Emerson analyzed the number of attachment relationships that infants form in alongitudinal studywith 60 infants. The infants were observed every four weeks during the first year of life, and then once again at 18 months.

Based on their observations, Schaffer and Emerson outlined four distinct phases of attachment, including:


### Pre-Attachment Stage


From birth to 3 months, infants do not show any particular attachment to a specific caregiver. The infant's signals, such as crying and fussing, naturally attract the attention of the caregiver and the baby's positive responses encourage the caregiver to remain close.


### Indiscriminate Attachment


Between 6 weeks of age to 7 months, infants begin to show preferences for primary and secondary caregivers. Infants develop trust that the caregiver will respond to their needs. While they still accept care from others, infants start distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar people, responding more positively to the primary caregiver.


### Discriminate Attachment


At this point, from about 7 to 11 months of age, infants show a strong attachment and preference for one specific individual. They will protest when separated from the primary attachment figure (separation anxiety), and begin to display anxiety around strangers (stranger anxiety).


### Multiple Attachments


After approximately 9 months of age, children begin to form strong emotional bonds with other caregivers beyond the primary attachment figure. This often includes a second parent, older siblings, and grandparents.


## Factors That Influence Attachment


While this process may seem straightforward, there are some factors that can influence how and when attachments develop, including:

- Opportunity for attachment: Children who do not have a primary care figure, such as those raised in orphanages or foster care, may fail to develop the sense of trust needed to form an attachment.

- Quality caregiving: When caregivers respond quickly and consistently, children learn that they can depend on the people who are responsible for their care, which is the essential foundation for attachment. This is a vital factor.

In some children, this lack of consistent care during early childhood may lead to attachment disorders. Failure to form early attachments can significantly affect social and emotional development.


## The Four Main Attachment Styles


There are four patterns of attachment, including:


### Ambivalent Attachment


Children with anambivalent attachment stylebecome very distressed when a parent leaves. As a result of poor parental availability, these children cannot depend on their primary caregiver to be there when they need them.

Older research by Cassidy and Berlin estimated that 7% to 15% of U.S. children were ambivalently attached.More recent research indicates that around 13.2% have an anxious/avoidant style.


### Avoidant Attachment


Children with anavoidant attachmenttend to avoid parents or caregivers, showing no preference between a caregiver and a complete stranger. This attachment style might be a result of abusive or neglectful caregivers. Children who are punished for relying on a caregiver will learn to avoid seeking help in the future.


### Disorganized Attachment


Children with adisorganized attachment styledisplay a confusing mix of behavior, seeming disoriented, dazed, or confused. They may avoid or resist the parent. Lack of a clear attachment pattern is likely linked to inconsistent caregiver behavior. In such cases, parents may serve as both a source of comfort and fear, leading to disorganized behavior.


### Secure Attachment


Children who can depend on their caregivers show distress when separated and joy when reunited. Although the child may be upset, they feel assured that the caregiver will return. When frightened, securely attached children are comfortable seeking reassurance from caregivers. This is the most common attachment style. Research suggests that 81.8% of people have asecure attachmentstyle.


## The Lasting Impact of Early Attachment


Children who are securely attached as infants tend to develop strongerself-esteemand betterself-relianceas they grow older. These children also tend to be more independent, perform better in school, have successful social relationships, and experience less depression and anxiety.

Research suggests that failure to form secure attachments early in life can have a negative impact on behavior in later childhood and throughout life.

Children diagnosed withoppositional defiant disorder(ODD),conduct disorder(CD), orpost-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) frequently display attachment problems, possibly due to early abuse, neglect, or trauma. Children adopted after the age of 6 months may have a higher risk of attachment problems.


### Attachment Disorders


In some cases, children may also develop attachment disorders. There are two attachment disorders that may occur: reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and disinhibited social engagement disorder (DSED).

- Reactive attachment disorderoccurs when children do not form healthy bonds with caregivers. This is often the result of early childhood neglect or abuse and results in problems with emotional management and patterns of withdrawal from caregivers.

- Disinhibited social engagement disorderaffects a child's ability to form bonds with others and often results from trauma, abandonment, abuse, or neglect.It is characterized by a lack of inhibition around strangers, often leading to excessively familiar behaviors around people they don't know and a lack of socialboundaries.


### Adult Attachments


Although attachment styles displayed in adulthood are not necessarily the same as those seen in infancy, early attachments can seriously impact later relationships. Adults who were securely attached in childhood tend to have good self-esteem, strong romantic relationships, and the ability to self-disclose to others. Those with insecure attachments are more likely to struggle with trust and intimacy.

Our understanding of attachment theory is heavily influenced by the early work of researchers such as John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth. Today, researchers recognize that the early relationships children have with their caregivers play a critical role in healthy development.

Such bonds can also have an influence on romantic relationships in adulthood. Understanding your attachment style may help you look for ways to become more secure in your relationships.
