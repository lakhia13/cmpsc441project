The eating disorder charityBeatestimates that around 1.25 million people in the UK have an eating disorder. Anyone can develop an eating disorder, no matter what their age, gender, race or weight. You might be surprised to learn that around 25% of those with an eating disorder are male, and most people with an eating disorder are not underweight.

There are several types of eating disorders, including:

- Anorexia nervosa- trying to keep your weight as low as possible (for example, by not eating enough or over-exercising). You may have a distorted view of your body, thinking you’re larger than you are

- Bulimia nervosa– having an unhealthy cycle of eating a lot of food and then doing something to try to stop weight gain, such as vomiting or taking laxatives

- Binge eating– where you eat a lot of food in a short period on a regular basis. As with bulimia, you won’t feel in control of your eating

If your symptoms don’t exactly fit the symptoms for any of these three eating disorders, you may be diagnosed with an ‘other specified feeding or eating disorder’ (OSFED). OSFED is the most common eating disorder.

### Symptoms of eating disorders


If you or the people around you are worried you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you could have an eating disorder. Some common symptoms of eating disorders include:

- eating very little food, or eating large amounts of food in a short time in an uncontrolled way

- having strict habits, rituals, or routines around food

- spending a lot of time worrying about your body weight and shape

- changes in mood such as being anxious, depressed or withdrawn

- making yourself sick or taking laxatives after eating

- avoiding socialising when food may be involved

- withdrawing from social groups, hobbies you used to enjoy or from family life

- physical signs such as feeling cold, tired or dizzy; digestive problems; or your weight being very high or very low for someone of your age and height


### What causes eating disorders?


There is no single cause of eating disorders. Many specialists believe they develop because of a mixture of factors. These include:

- biological factors– such as a family history of eating disorders or changes in your brain or hormone levels

- psychological factors– such as a lack of confidence or self-esteem or being a perfectionist

- social factorsinclude bullying, difficulties with school or work, or abuse.

Our pages onanorexiaandbulimiahave more information about the causes.


### Getting support


Recovery is possible, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. Recovery might even feel scary, especially if your eating disorder has become a strong part of your identity or you’re worried about your weight or diet changes. Think about what recovery might look like for you and what the benefits could be. It’s never too soon or too late to ask for help: it’s out there once you’re ready.

If you’re worried you may have an eating disorder,contact your GP.Your GP may not be an expert in treating eating disorders, but they will be able to assess any physical symptoms and then refer you to specialist eating disorder services.


### What help is available?


There are lots of different ways that eating disorders are treated. The most appropriate for you will depend on your type of eating disorder, how severe it is, and your personal circumstances and preferences.

Talking therapyinvolves working through your thoughts, feelings and behaviours with a mental health professional in regular sessions over a set period. Different kinds of talking therapy are available for treating and managing eating disorders. These includecognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family therapy or psychotherapy.

During your therapy sessions, you may agree on an eating plan to ensure you get the appropriate vitamins and minerals from your diet. Your GP may also conduct an X-ray to check your bone health if you have been underweight for a prolonged period, which can lead to low bone strength.

You may be offered a guided self-help programme if you have bulimia or a binge eating disorder. This involves completing exercises in a workbook alongside having short sessions with a practitioner.


### Helping someone with an eating disorder


If someone you care about has an eating disorder or is starting to show some of the symptoms, encourage them to see their GP and perhaps offer to go along with them. It can be helpful to let them know they are valued, that you support them and are willing to listen to them without judgement or criticism.
