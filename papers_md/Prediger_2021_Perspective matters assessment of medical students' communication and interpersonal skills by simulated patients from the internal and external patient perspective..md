Abstract

Background: Communication and interpersonals skills are important
qualities of professionalism in medicine. In medical curricula, they are
usually acquired in communication trainings and assessed in OSCEs.
Studies show correlations as well as differences between communication
ratings of examiners and simulated patients. In our study, simulated
    patients assessed medical students’ communication and interpersonal
skills after a consultation hour from the internal and the external patient
perspective.
Methods: In December 2019, 52 final-year medical students participated
in a consultation hour as part of a simulated first day of residency as-
sessment. They were assessed twice with a questionnaire for commu-
nication and interpersonal skills (ComCare) by the simulated patients:

1. directly after each consultation from the internal perspective of the

2.

patient’s view (internal perspective) and
four month later from the 208 consultation videos from an external
perspective of the patient’s view (external perspective).

All eight ComCare items were assessed on a five-point Likert scale
(1=full disagreement to 5=full agreement). Differences between the
item means of internal and external perspective were examined by
paired t-tests.
Results: Overall, significantly higher ratings were found for all ComCare
items from the external perspective except for the item “Interest”. Rat-
ings for the items “Language” and “Listening” were significantly higher
from the external perspective for all simulated patients. Significantly
higher ratings for all items from the external perspective were observed
for two simulated patients.
Conclusion: Simulated patients’ ratings after a conversation seem to
represent a more authentic view on students’ communication and inter-
personal skills because of the emotionally experienced situation. The
evaluation of those skills from a simulated patient perspective could
be a valuable complement to communication ratings by examiners.

Introduction

Communication and interpersonals skills are important
qualities of professionalism in medicine [1] and crucial
elements in the delivery of good medical care and patient
satisfaction [2], [3]. Undergraduate medical students
usually receive communication trainings addressing em-
pathy and interpersonal skills in their curriculum [4] and
the assessment of communication skills often takes place
in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) [5].
With respect to communication skills, mild, but significant
correlations between simulated patients and examiners
were found for warmth of greeting, listening skills, respect,

and concern for the patient as a person in an OSCE [6].
While some studies found moderate to high correlations
between simulated patients and examiners empathy
ratings [7], [8], higher empathy ratings by simulated pa-
tients compared with examiner ratings in a clinical exam
setting have been detected [9]. This study suggested
further training for simulated patients to standardize
empathy ratings and improve inter-rater reliability. Trained
simulated patients have been shown to act as consistent
raters for communications skills [10]. The research
question for our study was, whether trained simulated
patients assessed medical students’ communication and
interpersonal skills after physician-patient encounters

Table 1: Means of ComCare items and results of paired t-test for all simulated patients in total

from the internal perspective of the patient’s view (short:
internal perspective) in the same way than from an extern-
al perspective of the patient’s view (short: external per-
spective) when rating the videographed interviews four
months later. We hypothesize that a rating from these
two different perspectives will lead to different assess-
ments.

Project description and methods

Based on a validated 360-degree assessment for medical
students, which simulates a first day of residency [11],
we developed a competence-based training for final-year
medical students in the newly founded Center for Training
and Assessment of Medical Competences at the Univer-
sity Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf. In this training, parti-
cipants complete three phases in the role of a physician:

1. a consultation hour with four simulated patients per

participant,

2. a patient-management-phase with an online-patient-

documentation-form, and

3. a case presentation of one of the simulated patients.

In December 2019, 52 medical students in the first third
of their final year participated in this training. The eight
simulated patients – detailed role descriptions are de-
scribed elsewhere [12] filled out a questionnaire for
communication and interpersonal skills (ComCare) after
every consultation [13]. Its eight items were assessed on
a five-point Likert scale (1=full disagreement to 5=full
agreement). All consultations were videographed (N=208).
All simulated patients had received a rater training in
December 2019. They rehearsed their respective patient
role with either a real physician or a final year student
who acted as their interview partners. After each inter-
view, they filled out the ComCare questionnaire. The
ComCare items were discussed and typical anchors to
recognize behaviour linked to each item were defined.
In April 2020, four month after the assessment, the same
eight simulated patients watched their own consultation
videos and filled out the ComCare again. All simulated
patients received a written briefing before they rated the

videos. They were told to rate the participants from the
patient perspective, focussing on communicative and
interpersonal aspects and not on medical or other issues.
The time distance of four month before the second rating
was chosen to give the actors additional opportunity to
have achieved emotional distance from their own role.
The videos were rated by the actors in the same chrono-
logical order and in groups of four videos similar to the
rating during the original 360-degree assessment.
Using SPSS Statistics 26 for statistical analysis, we calcu-
lated means and standard deviations for all ComCare
items in total and per simulated patient. Additionally, we
used paired t-tests to examine differences between both
measurements (I: internal perspective, directly after each
consultation, E: external perspective, four month later
after watching their consultation videos). Due to multiple
testing, p-Values were Bonferroni corrected. Cohen’s d
was calculated for effect sizes. Additionally, we calculated
the mean differences between both ratings (internal and
external perspective) and conducted an ANOVA with those
for the items “language” and “listening”, which showed
significant differences for all simulated patients. For post-
hoc testing, we used Bonferroni corrections.

Results

Overall, simulated patients assessed all ComCare items
significantly higher from the external perspective except
for the item “Showing sincere interest” (see table 1). The
greatest difference with large effect sizes between assess-
ment from external versus internal perspective was found
for the items “Language” (2.43 points, d=8.94) and
“Listening” (1.68 points, d=3.97). Significantly higher
ratings for these two items were also observed for all
simulated patients individually from the external perspect-
ive (see table 2). For all items, significantly higher ratings
were only observed for SP3: 46-year-old man with severe
abdominal pain (abdominal migraine) and SP4: 45-year-
old woman with dizziness and malaise (second degree
atrioventricular block Mobitz type II). We found significant
differences between the mean differences of both ratings
for “language” and “listening” in all simulated patients

Table 3: Mean differences between both ComCare ratings for the items “Language” and “Listening” by simulated patients (SP)

(see table 3). The greatest difference for “language” was
found for SP6 (a talkative and cooperative patient) and
for “listening” for SP7 (a friendly, thankful patient with
intense pain). SP8 (a patient with fear of cancer) showed
the lowest mean differences between the two ratings for
“language” and SP1 (a taciturn and suborn patient) for
“listening”.

Discussion

Rating of medical students’ interpersonal skills or em-
pathy in communication situations with simulated patients
can be carried out in different ways: by only examiners
directly after the consultation [14], [15], by the simulated
patients themselves and by examiners directly after the
consultation [6], [7], [8], [9], or by examiners watching
video recorded communication situations at a convenient
time [16], [17]. In our study, simulated patients rated the
same consultations from the patient perspective directly
after the consultation and four months later from the
external perspective of the patient’s view, watching their
videos. Interestingly, all simulated patients gave much
better scores for “Use of plain language” and “Attentive
listening” from the external perspective than from the
internal, emotionally altered patient perspective. Real
patients reported that they sometimes felt that doctor
was not listening or used words they did not understand
[18], [19]. Our simulated patients’ lower ratings from the

internal perspective could be a result of their perceived
impression whereas they might have rated the video with
emotional distance from the external perspective. Two
simulated patients who played roles with very debilitating
emotional states (SP3 is very angry and SP4 is stressed
in her job), rated all aspects of the ComCare lower from
the internal than from the external perspective. Regarding
the aspect of “listening”, the mean difference between
the two ratings was, for example, significantly higher for
a patient with intense pain (SP7) compared to a taciturn,
stubborn patient (SP1).This gives another clue, that
severe emotional alteration (e.g. by pain) can greatly
hamper a (simulated) patient’s evaluation of a (simulated)
physician’s communication skill. It has been shown before
that ratings of communication skills are not independent
of case content [20] and the acted emotions might have
influenced the rating from the internal perspective in our
setting versus the more distanced rating from the external
perspective without the emotions of patient role.
A strength of this study is that we deployed only one actor
per patient role which supports high standardisation for
role playing and rating. A limitation is that the actors could
have gathered experiences between the two points of
measurement, which could have influenced their rating
at the second time point. Furthermore, we can only
provide data from eight simulated patient roles, which
limits the generalizability of our results. However, this pilot

study provides first, interesting findings which can be
explored further.

Conclusion

Simulated patient rating of communication and interper-
sonal skills after a conversation includes the internal
patient perspective which is influenced by the patient’s
emotions and therefore seems to represent a more au-
thentic patient view. We conclude, that the evaluation of
communication and interpersonal skills from the emotion-
ally involved simulated patient perspective can be a
valuable complement to communication ratings by exam-
iners. Students could benefit from the additional learning
experience that feedback from an emotionally involved
simulated patient can differ from the feedback they re-
ceive from an external perspective, which is mostly based
on professional aspects of communication.

Zusammenfassung

Hintergrund: Kommunikative und zwischenmenschliche Fähigkeiten
sind wichtige Eigenschaften der medizinischen Professionalität. In me-
dizinischen Curricula werden sie üblicherweise in Kommunikationstrai-
nings erworben und in OSCEs geprüft. Studien zeigen sowohl Korrela-
tionen als auch Unterschiede zwischen den Kommunikationsbewertun-
    gen von Prüfer*innen und simulierten Patient*innen. In unserer Studie
bewerteten simulierte Patient*innen die kommunikativen und interper-
sonellen Fähigkeiten von Medizinstudierenden nach einer Sprechstunde
aus der internen und externen Patient*innenperspektive.
Methoden: Im Dezember 2019 nahmen 52 Medizinstudierende im
Praktischen Jahr an einer Sprechstunde teil, die zum Training eines si-
mulierten ersten Arbeitstages in der ärztlichen Weiterbildung gehörte.
Sie wurden zweimal mit einem Fragebogen für kommunikative und in-
terpersonelle Fähigkeiten (ComCare) von den simulierten Patient*innen
bewertet:

1. direkt nach jeder Konsultation aus der internen Perspektive der

Patient*innensicht (Innenperspektive) und

2. vier Monate später anhand der 208 Konsultationsvideos aus der
externen Perspektive der Patient*innensicht (Außenperspektive).

Alle acht ComCare-Items wurden auf einer fünfstufigen Likert-Skala
bewertet (1=volle Ablehnung bis 5=volle Zustimmung). Unterschiede
zwischen den Item-Mittelwerten der Innen- und Außenperspektive
wurden mittels gepaarter t-Tests untersucht.
Ergebnisse: Insgesamt wurden für alle ComCare-Items, außer für das
Item „Interesse“, signifikant höhere Bewertungen aus der Außenper-
spektive gefunden. Die Bewertungen für die Items „Sprache“ und „Zu-
hören“ waren aus der Außenperspektive für alle simulierten Patient*in-
nen signifikant höher. Signifikant höhere Bewertungen für alle Items
aus der Außenperspektive wurden bei zwei simulierten Patient*innen
beobachtet.
Schlussfolgerungen: Die Bewertungen von simulierten Patient*innen
nach einem Konsultationsgespräch scheinen aufgrund der emotional
erlebten Situation eine authentischere Sicht auf die kommunikativen
und interpersonellen Fähigkeiten der Studierenden darzustellen. Die
Bewertung dieser Fähigkeiten aus der Perspektive simulierter Patient*in-
nen könnte eine wertvolle Ergänzung zu den Kommunikationsbewertun-
gen durch Prüfer*innen darstellen.

Einleitung

Kommunikative und zwischenmenschliche Fähigkeiten
sind wichtige Eigenschaften der medizinischen Professio-
nalität [1] und entscheidende Elemente für eine gute
medizinische Versorgung und für die Patientenzufrieden-
heit [2], [3]. Medizinstudierende erhalten in der Regel
Kommunikationstrainings, die Empathie und interperso-
nelle Fähigkeiten in ihrem Curriculum adressieren [4],
und die Bewertung der Kommunikationsfähigkeiten er-
folgt oft in objektiv strukturierten klinischen Prüfungen
(OSCE) [5]. Für kommunikative Fähigkeiten wurden gerin-
ge, aber signifikante Korrelationen zwischen den Bewer-
tungen von simulierten Patient*innen und Prüfer*innen
für Herzlichkeit bei der Begrüßung, Zuhören und Respekt
und Sorge um die Patient*innen als Personen in OSCEs
gefunden [6]. Während einige Studien mittlere bis hohe
Korrelationen zwischen den Empathie-Bewertungen von
simulierten Patient*innen und Prüfer*innen fanden [7],
[8], wurden höhere Empathie-Bewertungen durch simu-
lierte Patient*innen im Vergleich zu Prüfer*innenbewer-
tungen in einer klinischen Prüfungssituation festgestellt
[9]. In dieser Studie wurde ein weiteres Training für simu-
lierte Patient*innen vorgeschlagen, um Empathie-Bewer-
tungen zu standardisieren und die Inter-Rater-Reliabilität
zu verbessern. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass geschulte simu-
lierte Patient*innen konsistente Rater für kommunikative
Fähigkeiten sind [10]. Die Forschungsfrage unserer Studie
war, ob geschulte simulierte Patient*innen die kommuni-
kativen und interpersonellen Fähigkeiten von Medizinstu-
dierenden nach Ärzt*innen-Patient*innen-Begegnungen
aus der internen Perspektive der Patienten*innensicht
(kurz: Innenperspektive) in gleicher Weise bewerten wie
vier Monate später bei der Bewertung der videoaufge-
zeichnete Interviews und somit aus der externen Perspek-
tive der Patient*innensicht (kurz: Außenperspektive).
Unsere Hypothese war, dass eine Bewertung aus diesen
beiden unterschiedlichen Perspektiven zu unterschiedli-
chen Einschätzungen führen würde.

Projektbeschreibung und Methoden

Basierend auf einem validierten 360-Grad-Assessment
für Medizinstudierende, das einen ersten Tag in der
ärztlichen Weiterbildung simuliert [11], haben wir im neu
gegründeten Centrum für Training und Prüfung medizini-
scher Kompetenzen am Universitätsklinikum Hamburg-
Eppendorf ein kompetenzbasiertes Training für Medizin-
studierende im Praktischen Jahr entwickelt. In diesem
Training absolvieren die Teilnehmer*innen drei Phasen
in der Rolle von Ärzt*innen:

1. eine Sprechstunde mit vier simulierten Patient*innen

pro Teilnehmer*in,

2. eine Patientenmanagement-Phase mit einem Online-

Patient*innendokumentationsbogen und

3. eine Fallpräsentation eines/r der simulierten Pati-

ent*innen.

Im Dezember 2019 nahmen 52 Medizinstudierende im
ersten Tertial ihres Praktischen Jahrs an diesem Training
teil. Die acht simulierten Patient*innen – detaillierte
Rollenbeschreibungen sind an anderer Stelle beschrieben
[12] – füllten nach jeder Konsultation einen Fragebogen
zu Kommunikation und interpersonellen Kompetenzen
(ComCare) aus [13]. Dessen acht Items wurden auf einer
fünfstufigen Likert-Skala bewertet (1=volle Ablehnung
bis 5=volle Zustimmung). Alle Konsultationen wurden auf
Video aufgezeichnet (N=208). Alle simulierten Patient*in-
nen erhielten im Dezember 2019 ein Rater-Training. Sie
probten ihre jeweilige Patient*innenrolle entweder mit
einem Arzt/einer Ärztin oder einem/r Studierenden im
letzten Studienjahr, der/die als Interviewpartner*in fun-
gierte. Nach jedem Interview füllten sie den ComCare-
Fragebogen aus. Die ComCare-Items wurden besprochen
und typische Anker zum Erkennen von Verhalten, die mit
jedem Item verbunden sind, wurden definiert.
Im April 2020, vier Monate nach dem Assessment, sahen
sich dieselben acht simulierten Patient*innen ihre eige-
nen Konsultationsvideos an und füllten den ComCare
erneut aus. Alle simulierten Patient*innen erhielten eine
schriftliche Einweisung, bevor sie die Videos bewerteten.
Sie wurden angewiesen, die Teilnehmer*innen aus der
Patientenperspektive zu bewerten, wobei sie sich auf
kommunikative und interpersonelle Aspekte konzentrie-
ren sollten und nicht auf medizinische oder andere
Aspekte. Der zeitliche Abstand von vier Monaten vor der
zweiten Bewertung wurde gewählt, um den Schauspie-
ler*innen zusätzlich die Möglichkeit zu geben, emotiona-
len Abstand zu ihrer eigenen Rolle zu gewinnen. Die Vi-
deos wurden von den Schauspieler*innen in der gleichen
zeitlichen Reihenfolge und in Gruppen von vier Videos
bewertet, ähnlich wie bei der Bewertung während des
ursprünglichen 360-Grad-Assessments.
Für die statistische Analyse nutzten wir SPSS Statistics
26 und berechneten Mittelwerte und Standardabweichun-
gen für alle ComCare-Items insgesamt und pro simulier-
tem/r Patienten/-in. Zusätzlich verwendeten wir gepaarte
t-Tests, um Unterschiede zwischen beiden Messungen
zu untersuchen (I: Innenperspektive, direkt nach jeder
Konsultation, E: Außenperspektive, vier Monate später
nach dem Ansehen der Konsultationsvideos). Aufgrund
von Mehrfachtests wurden die p-Werte Bonferroni-korri-
giert. Für Effektstärken wurde Cohen's d berechnet. Zu-
sätzlich berechneten wir die Mittelwertdifferenzen zwi-
schen beiden Bewertungen (Innen- und Außenperspekti-
ve) und führten mit diesen eine ANOVA für die Items
„Sprache“ und „Zuhören“ durch, die für alle simulierten
Patient*innen signifikante Unterschiede ergab. Für die
Post-hoc-Tests verwendeten wir Bonferroni-Korrekturen.

Ergebnisse

Insgesamt bewerteten die Simulationspatient*innen alle
ComCare-Items aus der Außenperspektive signifikant
höher, mit Ausnahme des Items „Aufrichtiges Interesse
zeigen“ (siehe Tabelle 1). Der größte Unterschied mit

gesprächiger und kooperativer Patient) und für „Zuhören“
für SP7 (eine freundliche, dankbare Patientin mit starken
Schmerzen) gefunden. SP8 (eine Patientin mit Angst vor
Krebs) zeigte die geringsten mittleren Unterschiede zwi-
schen den beiden Bewertungen für „Sprache“ und SP1
(ein wortkarger und eigensinniger Patient) für „Zuhören“.

Diskussion

Die Bewertung der interpersonellen Fähigkeiten oder des
Einfühlungsvermögens von Medizinstudierenden in
Kommunikationssituationen mit simulierten Patient*in-
nen kann auf unterschiedliche Weise erfolgen: nur durch
Prüfer*innen direkt nach der Konsultation [14], [15],
durch die simulierten Patient*innen selbst und durch
Prüfer*innen direkt nach der Konsultation [6], [7], [8],
[9] oder durch Prüfer*innen, die sich zu einem geeigneten
Zeitpunkt videoaufgezeichnete Kommunikationssituatio-
nen ansehen [16], [17]. In unserer Studie bewerteten
simulierte Patient*innen dieselben Konsultationen aus
der internen Patientenperspektive direkt nach der Kon-
sultation und vier Monate später aus der externen Per-
spektive der Patient*innensicht beim Anschauen der Vi-
deos. Interessanterweise gaben alle simulierten Pati-
ent*innen aus der Außenperspektive deutlich bessere
Bewertungen für „Verwendung verständlicher Sprache“
und „Aufmerksames Zuhören“ ab als aus der inneren,
emotional beeinflussten Patient*innenperspektive. Echte
Patient*innen berichteten, dass sie manchmal das Gefühl
hatten, dass Ärzt*innen nicht zuhörten oder Worte be-
nutzten, die sie nicht verstanden [18], [19]. Die schlech-
teren Bewertungen unserer simulierten Patient*innen
aus der Innenperspektive könnten auf diese in der Situa-
tion entstandenen Eindrücke zurückzuführen sein, wäh-
rend sie mit der Außenperspektive das Video mit emotio-
naler Distanz bewerten konnten. Zwei simulierte Pati-
ent*innen, die Rollen mit sehr belastenden emotionalen
Zuständen spielten (SP3 ist sehr wütend und SP4 ist
gestresst in ihrem Job), bewerteten alle Aspekte der
ComCare aus der Innenperspektive niedriger als aus der
Außenperspektive. Bezüglich des Aspekts „Zuhören“ war
der Mittelwertunterschied beispielsweise zwischen den
beiden Bewertungen bei einer Patientin mit starken
Schmerzen (SP7) signifikant höher als bei einem wortkar-
gen, eigensinnigen Patienten (SP1). Dies gibt einen wei-
teren Hinweis darauf, dass eine starke emotionale Verän-
derung (z.B. durch Schmerzen) die Bewertung der Kom-
munikationsfähigkeit (simulierter) Ärzt*innen durch (si-
mulierte) Patient*innen stark beeinträchtigen kann. Es
wurde schon früher gezeigt, dass Bewertungen von
Kommunikationsfähigkeiten nicht unabhängig vom Fall-
inhalt sind [20] und die gezeigten Emotionen könnten in
unserem Setting die Bewertung aus der Innenperspektive
gegenüber der distanzierteren Bewertung aus der Außen-
perspektive ohne die Emotionen der Patientenrolle beein-
flusst haben. Eine Stärke dieser Studie ist, dass wir nur
eine(n) Schauspieler*in pro Patientenrolle eingesetzt
haben, was eine hohe Standardisierung für Rollenspiel
und Bewertung unterstützt. Eine Einschränkung ist, dass
die Schauspieler*innen zwischen den beiden Messzeit-
punkten Erfahrungen gesammelt haben könnten, die ihre
Bewertung zum zweiten Zeitpunkt beeinflusst haben
könnten. Außerdem können wir nur Daten von acht simu-
lierten Patient*innenrollen zeigen, was die Verallgemei-
nerbarkeit unserer Ergebnisse einschränkt. Dennoch lie-

fert diese Pilotstudie erste, interessante Erkenntnisse,
die weiter erforscht werden können.

Schlussfolgerung

Die Bewertung von kommunikativen und interpersonellen
Fähigkeiten durch simulierte Patient*innen nach einem
Konsultationsgespräch schließt die innere Patient*innen-
perspektive mit ein, die von den Emotionen der Patient*in-
nen beeinflusst wird und daher eine authentischere Pati-
ent*innensicht
zu repräsentieren scheint. Daraus
schließen wir, dass die Bewertung der kommunikativen
und interpersonellen Fähigkeiten aus der emotional invol-
vierten simulierten Patient*innenperspektive eine wert-
volle Ergänzung zu den Kommunikationsbewertungen
durch die Prüfer*innen sein kann. Studierende könnten
von der zusätzlichen Lernerfahrung profitieren, dass sich
das Feedback emotional involvierter simulierter Patient*in-
nen von dem Feedback unterscheiden kann, das sie aus
einer externen Perspektive erhalten, die meist auf fachli-
chen Aspekten der Kommunikation basiert.
