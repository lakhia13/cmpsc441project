Abstract

Purpose of Review.—This paper summarizes key, recently published research examining 
longitudinal outcomes for preschoolers with high levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/
impulsivity.

Recent Findings.—Symptom trajectories show that hyperactivity/impulsivity declines across 
childhood. At the group level, the course of inattention appears more variable. However, 
identification of subgroups of children showing stable, rising and falling inattention over time is 
promising. Early ADHD-like symptoms portend risk for academic and social difficulties, as well 
as comorbid emotional and behavioral problems in childhood and adolescence. Several early risk 
factors appear to moderate these relations, including comorbid symptoms, parental 
psychopathology, socioeconomic disadvantage, and perhaps neuropsychological dysfunction. 
Furthermore, high levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity during the preschool 
period appear to compromise development of regulatory and neuropsychological functions, which 
in turn increases risk for negative outcomes later in childhood.

Summary.—Identified risk factors are targets for novel interventions, which ideally would be 
delivered early to at-risk children.

Introduction

ADHD is an early-emerging, chronic disorder characterized by inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity that lead to marked impairment across multiple contexts.1 Despite well-
replicated group differences between individuals with and without the disorder, ADHD is 
highly heterogeneous. This has made it extremely challenging for researchers to identify the 
underlying pathophysiology, efficacious interventions that alter developmental trajectories, 
and the diversity of outcomes of ADHD, particularly at the level of the individual.

This review aims to summarize and evaluate key, recently published studies (i.e., 2014-
March 2017) that examined longitudinal outcomes for preschoolers presenting with high 
levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity (see Table 1 for a summary of papers 
reviewed). At this early stage of development, levels of inattention and particularly 
hyperactivity/impulsivity are frequently high, but considerable variability in children’s 
trajectories is seen (see figure 1). Among preschool children with elevated levels of 
inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, many, but not all, go on to develop ADHD during 
the school-age years. Beginning in adolescence, symptom severity declines for a substantial 
portion of youth with ADHD. While “persisters” continue to present with high levels of 
symptoms and generally continue to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD, symptom severity 
for many declines modestly (i.e., “partial remitters”) or even substantially (“i.e., 
“remitters”). Notably, persisters, partial remitters, and remitters do not form discrete 
subgroups as depicted in the figure. These “groupings” represent artificial cuts in a 
dimension of symptom severity. Further, even most remitters remain symptomatic and 
impaired relative to their typically-developing peers.

In light of it being unclear which preschoolers will and won’t go on to develop an ADHD 
diagnosis, we included studies whose samples comprised children at high risk for ADHD 
(i.e., elevated levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity), but did not necessarily 
meet criteria for ADHD during the preschool period. Given our aim to shed light on 
longitudinal outcomes for children with early emerging ADHD behaviors, we included 
studies with a minimum two-year follow-up period, thus following children into school age. 
This review highlights key advances in our knowledge of trajectories of ADHD-like 
behaviors and associated impairment from preschool, and discusses current issues in need of 
further study.

ADHD Symptom Trajectories

Research suggests both stability and variability of inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive 
behaviors in preschoolers over time. However, relatively few studies have followed 
preschool children over development to elucidate continuities and discontinuities in ADHD 
symptomatology and associated functional impairment.

Lahey and colleagues2 examined children’s symptom trajectories across 13 time-points from 
ages 4–6 to 18 years based on mother- and teacher-rated ADHD symptoms. Two cohorts of 
preschoolers were recruited: 125 with ADHD and 130 well-matched controls. Both 
inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity declined with age, but a diagnosis by age 
interaction indicated a significantly greater decline in inattention, but not hyperactivity, in 
the group with ADHD.

Leopold et al.3 also found that hyperactivity/impulsivity declined from preschool through 9th 
grade [mean (SD) age = 15.4 (.30) years] in their community twin sample. In contrast to 
Lahey et al.,2 they found inattention was relatively stable and sluggish cognitive tempo 
(SCT) ratings increased over the 10-year period. This study provides evidence for temporal 
stability of SCT and its discriminability from inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, 
perhaps suggesting that SCT should be evaluated alongside inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity during clinical assessment.

An alternative approach to examining longitudinal course has identified subgroups of 
children who show different symptom trajectories. Sasser, Beekman, and Bierman4 recruited 
children (N=356) from low-income families and had teachers rate children’s inattention 
from kindergarten through 3rd grade. Latent profile analysis of trajectories yielded 4 groups: 
Stable Low, Stable High, Rising and Declining symptoms over time.

Finally, other researchers sought to identify specific symptoms holding greater predictive 
power for future outcomes. Harvey et al.5 examined ADHD and ODD symptoms over 4 
annual time-points in 126 children, 75 of who met criteria for ADHD both at preschool and 
3 years later (mean age at 4th assessment = 80 months). Rates of hyperactive symptoms 
remained flat except for ‘fidgeting’ and ‘blurting out answers,’ which increased over time. 
Preschoolers initially had relatively low rates of individual inattentive symptoms, but 
significant increases were seen in ‘making careless mistakes’, and ‘forgetful,’ with ‘making 
careless mistakes’ highly indicative of ADHD because it so rarely occurred in typically 
developing children.

Curchack-Lichtin et al.6 also examined individual symptoms among ADHD and typically-
developing preschoolers followed annually from 4–5 through 6–7 years. Diagnoses and 
symptom endorsement were determined by integrating parent, teacher and clinician reports. 
Overall, hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were superior to inattentive symptoms in 
discriminating those with and without ADHD at 4–5 years. This reversed by 6–7 years, at 
which time inattention symptoms were increasingly endorsed and gained moderate 
discriminant value. Out of all symptoms, only the Hyperactive/Impulsive symptom ‘Fidgets’ 
was of high discriminant value. The authors suggested that a reduced threshold of inattention 
symptoms before age 6, as was adopted for both symptom domains by DSM-51 for adults, 
may prevent the shift from hyperactive/impulsive to combined presentation that often occurs 
during the transition from preschool to school-age.

Overall, hyperactivity/impulsivity declines over time from the high levels seen during 
preschool. With the exception of ‘fidgeting,’ hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are less able 
to differentiate children with and without an ADHD diagnosis when children move from

preschool to school-age. More variable findings have been observed regarding the course of 
inattention over time. Some show that, on average, inattention declines, while others show 
stable or rising inattention. Promisingly, Sasser et al.4 identified subgroups of children who 
appear to show different symptom trajectories. As children get older, the discriminative 
ability of inattentive symptoms to distinguish between those with and without a diagnosis 
improves.

Mediators and Moderators of ADHD Symptom Trajectories

Beyond elucidating trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity across 
childhood, it is critical to determine risk factors or mechanisms by which they unfold. 
Recognizing these moderating and mediating variables can help with identification of at-risk 
children and provide clues for treatment development.

Psychosocial moderators/mediators.

Recent work affirms that psychosocial factors both within and outside the home influence 
ADHD trajectories. Sasser et al.4 found that among low-income American families, 
attending a school with higher levels of student achievement and living in two-parent 
households were associated with declining inattention between preschool and third grade. 
Conversely, living in a single-parent household was associated with stable high or rising 
inattention.

Similarly, Russell et al.7 found that early adversity was associated with higher risk for 
ADHD. Children whose family experienced socioeconomic disadvantage (difficulty 
affording basic amenities) when they were 33-months-old were more than twice as likely to 
be diagnosed with ADHD at age 7. This relation was mediated by greater family adversity 
(i.e., lack of partner affection, partner cruelty, maternal psychopathology, substance abuse or 
crime) at 2–4 years and less parental involvement at 6 years. These findings4,7 raise critical 
questions about how society addresses poverty and structural inequality, and how exposure 
to early adversity has ripple effects on children and their families.

In addition to socioeconomic indicators, parental characteristics can influence the course of 
ADHD symptoms. Breaux et al.8 found that maternal ADHD symptoms, predicted their 
child’s ADHD symptoms at age 6 after controlling for children’s symptoms at age 3 and 
other potential confounders. Although paternal ADHD symptoms did not predict worsening 
ADHD over early childhood, paternal psychopathology and extended family history of 
ADHD predicted more severe ADHD and ODD at age 6.

The above studies highlight potential psychosocial targets for intervention. In particular, 
newer research is examining whether comprehensive approaches that address children’s 
symptoms as well as known risk factors (such as parental ADHD) improves treatment 
outcomes for children.9 These studies are essential to address the complex interactions 
among family and social factors that place children with ADHD at risk for poorer outcomes.

Beyond external influences, child characteristics can influence the course of ADHD. Recent 
papers have focused on the interplay between children’s “bottom up” reactive and “top 
down” regulatory systems. Rabinovitz et al.10 showed that preschoolers’ Anger/Frustration 
increased risk for ADHD at age 7, in part by compromising development of executive 
functioning. Sjowall and colleagues’11 showed the importance of also evaluating children’s 
capacity to regulate positive emotions. They found that dysregulated happiness, measured at 
6.5 years-old was associated with greater inattention (but not hyperactivity/impulsivity) at 18 
years, even after controlling for preschool symptoms, SES and gender.

Neuropsychological functioning.

Over the past 30 years, neuropsychological dysfunction has been posited to be a core 
etiological factor for ADHD.12–14 Several recent papers have examined whether early 
neuropsychological functioning is associated with later diagnosis/severity of ADHD. Lahey 
et al.2 found that 4–6 year olds’ scores on the Short Form of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence 
Scale were not predictive of future ADHD symptoms. Similarly, Rajendran et al.15 
examined whether neurocognitive groupings of hyperactive/inattentive preschool children 
were predictive of ADHD diagnosis at six annual follow-up evaluations. Latent profile 
analysis identified two classes of hyperactive/inattentive preschoolers: selective impairment 
in attention/executive functioning and more severe, broad-based neuropsychological 
dysfunction. Both groups were at greater risk of ADHD diagnosis relative to typically-
developing children at each follow-up, but there were no differences between the selective 
and broad deficit groups. Furthermore, when examined separately, none of the nine 
neuropsychological measures were predictive of later ADHD diagnosis. Thus, although 
neuropsychological deficits are associated with ADHD, they may not be good indicators of 
which “at-risk” children go on to develop a diagnosis.

Some theories of ADHD also highlight a role for motivational processes in ADHD etiology.
16,17 Breaux, et al.18 evaluated “hot” (e.g. delay aversion) and “cold” (e.g. response 
inhibition, working memory) neurocognitive functioning in an at-risk sample of 3- and 4-
year-olds, and ADHD symptoms at age 6. They found little support for the notion that “hot” 
and “cool” measures differentially predict symptoms, but did report some significant 
associations between early neuropsychological functioning and later ADHD after controlling 
for early behavior problems. However, the measures had only poor to fair sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive and negative predictive power with regard to later ADHD, 
suggesting limited clinical utility.

Sasser et al.4 had pre-kindergarteners complete three tasks that loaded on to a single 
executive functioning factor. Children who had initially low, but rising inattention trajectory 
from preschool to third grade were found to have had lower executive functioning skills and 
higher rates of oppositional-aggressive behavior in preschool relative to children who 
remained low on inattention.

Thus, findings are not fully consistent as to whether early neuropsychological measures are 
predictive of later ADHD. Some studies report significant group effects, which might have

heuristic value, but on an individual level there is relatively little evidence of the prognostic 
value of early testing.

Brain structure.

The basal ganglia have been consistently implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. In the 
only study of its kind, Shaw et al.19 combined longitudinal and cross-sectional magnetic 
resonance imaging data to map basal ganglia developmental trajectories from age 4 through 
19 years in 270 youth with ADHD and 270 well matched controls. Two key findings 
emerged. First, the ventral striatum, a region closely associated with reward processing, 
showed progressive surface contraction in youth with ADHD but not in controls. This might 
contribute to motivational deficits in ADHD and the vulnerability to substance misuse in 
adolescents/adults with ADHD. Second, ADHD was linked to fixed, non-progressive surface 
area reductions in striatal regions supporting motor planning and executive functions, 
hallmark features of the disorder. These findings may provide clues about potential neural 
mediators of distinct ADHD phenotypes.

Non-pharmacological interventions.

Recent research is beginning to identify preschool factors associated with ADHD 
trajectories. A key follow-up question is whether we can design appropriate interventions for 
young children that can alter symptom trajectories. Non-pharmacological treatment options 
tend to be recommended as first-line treatment for preschoolers,20 given a somewhat poorer 
treatment response and greater incidence of medication side effects for preschoolers 
compared to older children.21 However, we still have a long way to go in our design and 
implementation of efficacious treatments for ADHD.22

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), Abikoff et al.23 compared three groups of 
preschoolers: 1) those whose parents participated in the New Forest Parenting Package 
(NFPP), which was designed specifically for ADHD; 2) those whose parents went through 
the “Helping the Noncompliant Child” (HNC) program, a more generic intervention for 
children with disruptive behavior disorders; and 3) a wait list control group. Compared to the 
wait list group, NFPP and HNC showed improvement of parent-rated symptoms of ADHD 
and oppositionality, but reports were not corroborated by either direct observations or 
teacher reports, consistent with findings showing that when the most proximal rater is used 
in the analyses, treatment effect sizes are large, but when more distal raters are used, 
significant treatment effects are severely diminished or vanish.22 Also notable, the specific 
ADHD intervention (NFPP) was not superior to the more generic behavioral intervention.23

Although blinded RCTs are the gold standard for evaluating intervention efficacy, many 
children receive services at school, where treatment effectiveness is rarely evaluated. 
Mlodnicka and colleagues24 conducted a naturalistic study of the impact of speech therapy 
(ST) and occupational/physical therapy (OT/PT) delivered in schools to hyperactive/
inattentive preschoolers. Preschoolers were assessed at baseline and two years later for 
behavior, language and motor development, and social skills. ST and OT/PT seemed to have 
no effect on hyperactive/inattentive children’s language or motor functioning, respectively. 
However, there was significant improvement in social skills in those children who received

ST. Obviously, there are limitations to naturalistic follow-up studies. However, it raises 
several questions: when children receive services in school, what is being delivered? What 
outcomes should be measured? Importantly, without randomization to treatment, we cannot 
accurately gauge how children would function without service delivery. These are areas for 
further study.

Impairment

Understanding symptom trajectories is clearly important, but individuals with ADHD show 
functional impairment across multiple domains, even when symptoms remit.25 Thus, 
examining impairment, as separate from symptoms, is not only important, but of great 
clinical significance.

Lahey and colleagues2 assessed global impairment from ages 4–18 years using parent and 
parent-interviewer ratings on the Children’s Global Assessment Scale, which reflects the 
lowest level of overall functioning in the past six months. Across the full sample, both 
informants rated functioning as significantly improving with age. However, across time, the 
ADHD group had significantly lower ratings by parents (16.87 points) and interviewers 
(17.46 points). Among children with ADHD in preschool, greater impairment from 7–18 
years was associated with female sex, and more inattention, anxiety, oppositionality and 
conduct symptoms. Consistent with findings showing that importance of psychosocial 
factors,7 higher family income predicted better functioning.

It is not surprising that, as a group, individuals with ADHD have lower global functioning 
than their non-ADHD peers. Identification of specific domains of impairment may be more 
informative and are discussed below.

Comorbidity.

ADHD is associated with increased risk for comorbid psychopathology. Several studies have 
assessed links between early ADHD symptoms and risk for later comorbidity, and potential 
moderators of these relations.

Breaux, Harvey, and Lugo-Candelas26 examined relations between parental 
psychopathology and internalizing, externalizing and social problems in a sample of 3-year-
olds (n = 132) who were rated as having high aggression and/or hyperactivity by their 
parents. Parental psychopathology was assessed dimensionally at baseline and children were 
re-evaluated at ages 4, 5 and 6 years. Mothers with greater psychopathology reported that 
their children had more externalizing and internalizing problems and weaker social skills. 
Fathers experiencing more psychopathology did not rate their children as having more 
difficulties but these children had higher maternal ratings of internalizing problems. Thus 
parental psychopathology may moderate the emergence of comorbid difficulties in children.

Harvey and colleagues27 examined development of comorbidity between ADHD and ODD 
from ages 3 to 6 years. ODD symptoms did not predict future hyperactivity/impulsivity or 
inattention when controlling for early ADHD. Consistent with a ‘developmental precursor’ 
model, however, at every time point from ages 3 through 6, both inattention and

hyperactivity/impulsivity predicted argumentativeness/defiance 1-year later; neither ADHD 
domain was associated with subsequent anger/irritability. In support of the correlated risk 
factors model, family history of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention significantly 
predicted age 3 hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, respectively, while family histories 
of ODD and CD were significantly associated with children’s anger/irritability at age 3.

Lahey et al.2 investigated predictors of youth-reported depression and anxiety at 9–18 years 
among children who met criteria for ADHD in early childhood. Neither early inattention nor 
hyperactivity/impulsivity severity predicted anxiety or depression. Younger age, higher 
parent-rated anxiety during preschool, lower childhood IQ and female sex predicted higher 
self-reported anxiety in late childhood/adolescence, while younger age and lower childhood 
IQ predicted depression. Similar risk factors predicted parent- and teacher-rated anxiety and 
depression from 7–18 years.

Social problems.

Considerable research shows that ADHD is associated with poorer social outcomes.28,29 
Stenseng et al.30 provided evidence for reciprocity between ADHD and peer rejection in 
early childhood. Teachers completed measures of peer rejection when children were aged 4, 
6 and 8 years, and parents were interviewed about children’s ADHD symptoms. A cross-
lagged model showed reciprocal relations between peer rejection and ADHD symptoms 
between age 4 and 6 years, but not between 6 and 8.

Two studies examined the link between ADHD and a particularly severe social problem: 
bullying. Verlinden and colleagues31 investigated the risk that early ADHD has for later 
perpetration of or victimization from bullying at age 7. After adjusting for ODD, age 3 
ADHD (not ages 1.5 or 5) increased risk for teacher-reported bully-victim status at age 7. 
When risk was evaluated relative to symptom trajectory, children with high increasing 
ADHD symptoms were 2.18 times more likely to be a bully at age 7, and 2.86 times more 
likely to be a bully-victim. Those with high increasing ADHD and ODD symptoms (n=51) 
had the greatest risk of being a bully or bully-victim.

Rajendran and colleagues32 asked whether more optimal parenting was related to lower rates 
of bullying over time among children diagnosed with behavioral problems. Parenting was 
assessed via direct observations at 4–5 years of age and teachers evaluated bullying 
behaviors over the next 4 years. Children with comorbid ADHD/ODD were more likely to 
bully than children with ADHD alone or with neither diagnosis. Although bullying 
decreased over time for all, parent support for child autonomy was associated with a greater 
decline in bullying, especially among children who had both ADHD/ODD. Thus ADHD 
symptoms during preschool pose a risk for both later bullying and being a bully-victim. 
When ADHD is coupled with ODD, risk may be amplified.

Academic achievement.

A robust literature shows a negative association between ADHD and academic outcomes.
33,34 Most recent studies support earlier findings that inattention is more strongly related to 
achievement than hyperactivity/impulsivity.35–37 Schmideler and Schneider37 showed this

irrespective of whether predicting reading or math, and even after controlling for pre-
academic skills (e.g., phonological awareness, quantity-number competencies).

O’Neill et al.35 and Plourde et al.36 investigated potential mechanisms accounting for the 
association between ADHD and reading. O’Neill and colleagues35 found that inattention at 
age 4 compromised children’s language development by age 5, which in turn was associated 
with poorer reading achievement, as measured using objective tests and teacher ratings, at 
age 8 years. Using a population-based twin sample, Plourde et al.36 examined whether the 
association between ADHD and later reading comprehension occurred through shared 
genetic etiology. Regression analyses showed that inattention, measured during kindergarten 
and first grade, as well as nonverbal abilities, significantly predicted decoding and 
comprehension at age 8 years. In fact, inattention remained a predictor of reading 
comprehension even after decoding was included in the model, and the relation was largely 
due to shared genetic influences.

Claessens et al.38 assessed the timing and direction of the association between changes in 
academic achievement and problems with attention and disruptive behavior to isolate 
meaningful intervention points. Children were assessed in the fall and spring of 
Kindergarten, and the spring of 1st, 3rd, and 5th grade. Worsening attention problems were 
associated with decreased math and reading gains between kindergarten and first grade and 
between first and third grade; for reading only, worsening attention from first to third grade 
was associated with lower reading gains between third and fifth grade. In contrast, changes 
in disruptive behavior were not associated with either math or reading achievement. Less 
consistent findings were observed when looking at whether changes in academic 
achievement were associated with later changes in attention problems. In general, greater 
improvement in math achievement was associated with diminished growth in attention 
problems.

Sasser et al.4 investigated academic outcomes for four inattention trajectory classes: Stable 
Low; Rising; Declining; and Stable High inattention. At grade 3, those with Rising 
symptoms had inattention levels that were the same as those with Declining symptoms. 
However, while those with Rising inattention had largely similar academic outcomes at 
grade 5 to children with Stable Low symptoms, those in the Declining inattention group 
performed more poorly on all academic measures than the Stable Low group.

Driving and criminal offending.

Compared to non-ADHD peers, individuals with ADHD have poorer driving outcomes that 
cannot be fully accounted for by comorbid ODD/CD.39 They are also at greater risk of 
arrest, conviction and incarceration, although these latter relations appear to be mediated by 
antisocial personality disorder and substance use.40 Consistent with these findings, Lahey 
and colleagues2 showed that when compared to the controls, adolescents (ages 15–18 years) 
who had received a diagnosis of ADHD as preschoolers were more likely to engage in risky 
driving behavior and were 4.31 times as likely to have been arrested. The presence of 
conduct symptoms at baseline was a risk factor for both arrest and driving without a license.

Clinical Applications and Methodological Considerations

The papers reviewed assessed the psychosocial, behavioral and neuropsychological 
predictors of outcomes across several domains and show that risk factors present early in 
childhood exert long-lasting influences on children’s functioning. Though certainly not a 
new recommendation it bears repeating that prompt identification of youngsters at risk for 
ADHD and access to early intervention is essential.41 This call to action is particularly 
meaningful given Sasser et al.’s work, reviewed above, showing that children with Declining 
inattention showed poorer academic outcomes than children with Stable Low symptoms, 
while children with Rising inattention and Stable Low inattention had largely similar 
academic outcomes. 4 Such findings may reflect a developmental cascade,42 where young 
children with low levels of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity develop greater 
regulatory skills and in-turn greater coping resources should symptom severity increase later 
in childhood. In contrast, high symptom levels early in development may restrict or reduce 
growth in critical areas of functioning, setting-up children for greater impairment, even if 
symptoms eventually remit.

Unfortunately, the sensitivity required to identify which child will attain what particular 
outcome continues to elude us.2 O’Neill et al.43 found that at least two informants were 
needed from different settings to accurately predict which preschoolers would go on to meet 
criteria for ADHD during school-age; obtaining parent report alone is not sufficient. 
Thorough assessment, especially in the early years, is essential and although likely more 
expensive, may help to better allocate resources.

Ultimately, the difficult question of where to allocate limited resources is one faced by 
health, education and justice departments, and families. The financial burden of ADHD is 
enormous44 and appears to be particularly so for early-emerging ADHD. For instance, 
Chorozoglou et al.45 followed a large sample of hyperactive preschoolers through ages 14 
and then 24 years, and found them to have significantly greater mental health, education, 
criminal justice and family costs than controls. Each unit increase in hyperactivity added a 
cost of £49.60 to average yearly costs, primarily via later mental health problems. 
Heckman46 reported greater discounting of each dollar spent as individuals get older and, 
therefore, return on investment is greater when spent on young children, emphasizing 
(again) the importance of early intervention.

Beyond the application of recent research to clinical practice and policy, there are 
methodological issues to consider. First, most researchers test linear models, yet 
development generally progresses in a non-linear manner (e.g., brain growth, executive 
control, negative affect). Lahey et al.2 tested quadratic models and showed steeper declines 
in symptoms at older ages. More work of this nature is needed.

Further, for studies using neuropsychological measures, careful consideration needs to be 
given to what tests measure, particularly in younger age groups. Poor psychometric 
properties of neuropsychological measures administered to preschoolers18 limits valid 
conclusions. Additionally, particularly for young children, the extent to which poor

performance reflects true underlying deficits versus behavioral problems and non-
compliance is difficult to disentangle.

Finally, in very young children, differences in assessment age affect conclusions drawn 
because of the developmental trajectory of neural circuitry that underlies behavior and 
neuropsychological functioning. Since the neural circuits underlying neuropsychological 
functions are thought to be fine-tuned with experience, it is possible that the same ability/test 
measured at different time points may have differential predictions due to developmental 
maturation.

Conclusion

ADHD is a chronic, impairing condition that commonly emerges at an early age. 
Longitudinal data sets spanning different developmental periods have enabled us to model 
long-term course of the disorder and associated impairment, and to identify risk factors for 
these paths.

For clinicians, despite the uptick in longitudinal studies over recent years, our measures and 
models are not sensitive enough to be able to tell parents what the outcome will be for their 
child, and ultimately this is what they want to know. So, as a field, we still have work to do. 
However, we are able to tell parents that many children will continue to show symptoms 
and/or impairment associated with early emerging inattention and/or hyperactivity over time, 
although they may not necessarily meet criteria for an ADHD diagnosis. Overt hyperactivity, 
in particular, will likely lessen in severity, but the path of inattention symptoms is less clear. 
Early symptoms increase risk for poorer outcomes in multiple domains including social, 
emotional and behavioral functioning, with risk amplified if early oppositional or conduct 
symptoms are present. Inattention specifically increases risk for poorer academic outcomes, 
especially in the domain of reading. Certain environmental factors increase the risk of later 
ADHD and possible comorbid diagnoses for youngsters. These include parental 
psychopathology and adverse environments, which may act directly or indirectly through 
their effects on parenting practices. Taken together, clinicians should be on the look out for 
youngsters with high levels of inattention and routinely monitor their progress across the 
preschool period. Interventions likely need to be holistic, targeting child-, family- and 
school-level factors, although further research is needed to lend empirical support to this 
assumption. Finally, with respect to assessment: 1) obtaining ratings from multiple 
informants is critical; and 2) neuropsychological assessment at such a young age can aid in 
distinguishing those with and without elevated inattention/hyperactivity, but do not appear to 
have great utility for distinguishing which children will follow what trajectory.

For researchers, advanced statistical modeling will enable us to analyze non-linear and 
heterogeneous trajectories, which currently, are not often analyzed. In addition, careful 
thought about which covariates to measure at which time points in longitudinal studies may 
help us to better understand the transactional nature of developmental psychopathology over 
time, which in turn, will help inform intervention.
