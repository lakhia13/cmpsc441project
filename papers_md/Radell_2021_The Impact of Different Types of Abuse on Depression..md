Despite a large amount of research on depression and abuse, there is still a controversy on how abuse is measured and on childhood
trauma’s eﬀect on the physiological function of adults. Here, we attempt to clarify the relationship between diﬀerent types of abuse
and depression while focusing on childhood abuse. This article, unlike prior research, provides an overview that addresses physical,
psychological, and sexual abuse and their psychological impact on the victims. Results show that abuse is a vulnerability factor for a
variety of mental and physical health problems and that psychological abuse is strongly associated with depression. More research is
needed to understand (a) the role of abuse in the development and maintenance of depression and, in particular, longitudinal
studies that also account for the large number of risk and protective factors that inﬂuence this relationship and (b) how diﬀerent
types of abuse can inﬂuence response to treatment among survivors with depression, in order to provide eﬀective trauma-
focused approaches to manage depressive symptoms.

1. Introduction

Abuse is a common issue in all societies around the world
and can be deﬁned as an action that intentionally harms,
injures, or impairs an individual physically, psychologi-
cally, or socially [1]. Abuse may take diﬀerent forms such
as physical, sexual, and emotional as well as commercial
exploitation. This could lead to either potential or actual
harm to the individual’s life, with an enormous eﬀect on
their mental and physical health, their dignity, and their
future relationships [2]. Abuse can happen at any time
and to anyone and has serious, long-lasting negative emo-
tional, mental, and physical eﬀects on the victim. These
include an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, includ-
ing depression [3]. Depression, otherwise known as major
is a common
depressive disorder or clinical depression,

and a serious mood disorder. Individuals who suﬀer from
depression experience persistent feelings of sadness and
hopelessness, and they lose interest in the activities they
once enjoyed [4, 5]. In addition to the emotional problems
caused by depression,
individuals can also present with
physical symptoms, such as chronic pain or headaches
[6]. To understand the etiology of the depression associ-
ated with abuse, it is critical to address the patient’s his-
tory of abuse and the emotional pain it may cause [7].

The onset, progression, and prognosis of major depres-
sive disorder are aﬀected by genetic, environmental, and dis-
positional factors [8]. For example, both general life stressors,
and those speciﬁcally associated with abuse, have long been
considered leading contributors to the onset of depression
[9], in which severe depression is strongly related to emo-
tional and physical abuse [10]. This relationship can be

2

it

explained by the fact that abuse aﬀects growth, personality,
cognition, and behavior and can increase the sensitivity to life
stress, both in childhood and adulthood [11]. For example,
abuse alters how an individual perceives themselves, as well
as the world around them, with a far-reaching impact on
self-esteem, physical and mental development, and social
emotions [12, 13]. Furthermore,
is associated with
increases in pessimistic thinking and negativity, feelings of
sadness, and social avoidance and isolation [14]. As such,
both short- and long-term physical abuse can signiﬁcantly
aﬀect the whole trajectory of a person’s life, to feel worthless,
hopeless, helpless, and the loss of pleasure in daily activities
as well as indulgence in self-suﬀering—all common symp-
toms of depression [15, 16]. All of these factors can be
expected to have long-term eﬀects on personality states and
traits, some of which have been identiﬁed as predictors of
the severity of depression [17]. In addition, childhood mal-
treatment is associated with more severe and recurrent
depression, as well as treatment resistance [18]. This article
will review research on the relationship between abuse and
depression, with a focus on childhood abuse and its impact
on the victim.

To conduct this literature review, we performed a Google
Scholar search using diﬀerent combinations of terms, such as
physical, sexual, psychological, emotional, and childhood
abuse, adversity, corporal punishment, and depression and
its various synonyms, as well as stress and vulnerability, to
locate peer-reviewed empirical studies, reviews, and meta-
analyses that dealt with the relationship between abuse and
depression. This database was selected because it is inclusive
of both the social sciences and biomedical literature. We also
conducted forward and backward searches from the most rel-
evant search results, namely, those that speciﬁcally address
the relationship between diﬀerent types of abuse and depres-
sion. While there are large literatures dealing with abuse or
depression alone, our main focus was on more recent studies,
published within the last 5-10 years, that, ideally, compared
the impact of diﬀerent types of abuse on depression. This
type of study, however, was rare, and we also included
research that had considered only one type of abuse, with a
focus on abuse that had occurred during childhood, and its
relationship to depression. Beyond this, the review was not
systematic. The lack of other formal exclusion criteria for
the research we located, other than that it had to be peer
reviewed, could be considered a limitation of this review.

2. Challenges in Abuse Research

One of the main challenges in reviewing the relationship
between abuse and depression is the equivocal literature on
the deﬁnition and the measurement of abuse [1, 19].
Although there is a clear distinction between three major
types of abuse—physical, sexual, and psychological, they are
assessed in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent studies. In general,
there is an overreliance on self-report, ranging from well-
validated questionnaires to individual experimenter-made
items [1, 20]. Additionally, some studies distinguish between
the diﬀerent types of abuse and their respective contribu-
tions, while others considered abuse in general or focused

on one type without accounting for whether other types
could occur simultaneously [1, 20, 21]. Others addressed dif-
ferent forms of childhood adversity, such as antipathy and
neglect, alongside with abuse. While the literature on abuse
is extensive, it is also abundant with mixed ﬁndings, spurring
several recent umbrella reviews (see [9, 20, 22, 23]).

Assessing speciﬁc types of abuse is important because
each may be predictive of diﬀerent short- and long-term
outcomes. For example, psychological abuse is often found
to be strongly associated with depression later in life, com-
pared to physical and sexual abuse [9, 24–26]. From a clinical
perspective, victims of psychological abuse are identiﬁed and
recommended for speciﬁc treatments, which usually address
depressive symptoms in the context of the abuse or trauma
they experienced. However, multiple types of abuse are likely
to cooccur which can result in worse outcomes compared to
the exposure to one type of abuse [27, 28]. Thus, individuals
exposed to multiple forms of abuse require a custom-tailored
treatment approach. In practice, however, such targeted
evidence-based treatments may not always be available or
have yet to be developed or reﬁned.

Another challenge is elucidating the nature of the relation-
ship between abuse and depression, with no single method
that can conclusively establish a causal link. Much of the
research has been cross-sectional and retrospective. For exam-
ple, adults who report experiences of any type of abuse are at
greater risk of mental health problems, including depression,
compared to those without a history of abuse [29, 30]. In these
studies, the reverse relationship, where depression predisposes
individuals to abuse, is also possible. For example, the nature
of the family environment during childhood and how the indi-
viduals are treated (e.g., neglect) could increase the risk for
both abuse and depression. Powers et al. [24] found that, in
addition to psychological abuse, neglect was a stronger predic-
tor of adult depression compared to both physical and sexual
abuse during childhood. Meta-analyses have also established
that there is a consistent relationship between multiple forms
of maltreatment,
including psychological abuse, antipathy
and neglect, and depression [9].

Furthermore, retrospective reports are subject to recall
bias, known as mood-congruent recall, where individuals
who are currently depressed could be more likely to remem-
ber negative events from their childhood [31–33]. This can
skew research results and help explain why some meta-
analyses report a stronger association between abuse and
depression with clinical samples compared to other types of
samples. Clinical samples may exclude individuals with a his-
tory of abuse but who are, nonetheless, well-adjusted [20, 34].
A more recent meta-analysis by Infurna et al. [9] also showed
a stronger link between abuse and depression in clinical vs.
nonclinical samples; however, their clinical category included
data from high-risk community samples. In these types of
samples, false negative rather than false positive reporting
may be more common for traits that involve social stigma,
including history of abuse [35]. In addition, mood-congruent
recall in individuals with depression could allow them to
remember both negative and positive events equally, whereas
nondepressed control participants tend to remember positive
events [36, 37].

Longitudinal studies can begin to establish a probable
causal link, though it is not conclusive. Kendler and Aggen
[37] conducted a study on the impact of sexual abuse in
female twins that controlled for potential confounds related
to the parents of the participants, including their socioeco-
nomic status, depression history, and warmth and whether
each twin lived with both biological parents up to a certain
age. The authors also accounted for mood-congruent recall
bias and measured depression at two time points via inter-
view. A statistical model that did not include any of these
confounds found that sexual abuse accounted for 9.6% of
the variance observed in depression. However, after includ-
ing these confounds, this estimate decreased to 4.4%, with
current depression symptoms remaining a signiﬁcant predic-
tor of the recall of abuse-related experiences. It is important
to highlight that, despite the seemingly low estimate, the odds
ratio between child sexual abuse and depression was 1.83
(where an odds ratio of 1 indicates no relationship). There-
fore, depending on how this ratio is interpreted, a low to
moderate relationship remained. These results also suggest
that more than half of the association between childhood sex-
ual abuse and depression is not causal [37]. The limitations of
this study include that all twins were white females born in
Virginia; therefore, they are likely unrepresentative of the
general population. In addition, although each twin was
asked about the experience of the other twin, their reports
often did not match, with rates of sexual abuse based on cot-
win reports lower than those based on self-report. However,
more than two-thirds of the twins reported that they did
not tell anyone about their abuse experience, which could
account for at least some of the inconsistency [37].

3. Abuse, Stress Reactivity, and Depression

There is a general consensus that childhood trauma is a sig-
niﬁcant vulnerability factor for depression and that both
the chronicity [38] and the severity of depression in adult-
hood is related to the severity of childhood abuse [39]. How
may childhood abuse increase the risk for depression in
adulthood? It is well known that strong, frequent, and pro-
longed stress [40] can increase the risk of lifelong adverse
mental health issues, including depression [41]. From a bio-
logical perspective, traumatic life experience, such as abuse,
alter the physiology and even the structure of the brain
[42],
including long-term changes in neural networks
involved in the regulation of the physiological response to
stress [43, 44]. The response to threat is characterized by
varying degrees of sympathetic (ﬁght and ﬂight) and para-
sympathetic (ﬂag and faint) nervous system activation,
depending on the event and the person. These experiences
can sensitize the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
and other systems involved in the stress response, so that
those who are subjected to abuse become overly reactive to
any environmental trigger or stressor [45, 46]. Consistent
with this, childhood abuse is also a risk factor for a variety
of stress-related physical health conditions, such as heart dis-
ease and diabetes [47].

It is important to highlight that genetic factors also inﬂu-
ence the likelihood of developing depression when subjected

to childhood abuse. Bradley et al. [48] found that polymor-
phisms in the gene for a particular corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH) receptor inﬂuence (i.e., moderate) the
strength of the relationship between childhood abuse and
depression symptoms in adults. CRH, a key component of
the HPA axis, is released by the hypothalamus and regulates
the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the anterior
pituitary gland. This hormone,
in return, stimulates the
release of stress-related steroid hormones (e.g., cortisol in
humans),
from the adrenal glands. Such physiological
changes are also associated with emotional suﬀering and
can leave individuals vulnerable to unhealthy methods of reg-
ulating stress, which contribute to the severity of depression
and other types of psychopathology [49, 50]. These long-
term changes in stress reactivity can also be expected to
increase the risk for a variety of physical conditions, which
research has conﬁrmed. For example, childhood sexual abuse
is associated with a variety of health problems, including
immune issues and gastrointestinal and cardiopulmonary
malfunction [46, 51]. Animal (i.e., preclinical) models can
also add to our understanding of these changes, as well as
establish cause and eﬀect [52, 53].

There is also evidence that females are more vulnerable to
long-term changes in stress reactivity compared to males,
which may contribute to the increased prevalence of depres-
sion in women [54]. Women are twice as likely to be diag-
nosed with depression, compared to men, and are also
more likely to have experienced some form of abuse (physi-
cal, emotional, or sexual) as a child [55]. In a study that
examined the relationship between objective and subjective
deﬁnitions of physical abuse, and the prevalence of depres-
sion, the proportion of women who experienced depression
during their lifetime was the highest among those who were
identiﬁed as victims of abuse [56, 57]. This increased risk,
however, is not speciﬁc to depression since women who have
experienced abuse or other types of trauma are more likely to
develop a variety of other mental health conditions [58]. In
addition, males and females respond to sexual abuse diﬀer-
ently, where men tend to externalize their negative emotions,
which can explain the high prevalence of aggressiveness
and/or antisocial behavior, in contrast to that of depression
in women who internalize their negative emotions [59].

Besides gender, the age at onset, as well as the extent,
nature, and duration of abuse, can also aﬀect depression
[60, 61]. The social isolation of the victim, the identity of
the abuser, and, importantly, the provision of needed support
also inﬂuence the severity of depression [61]. Lack of support
can lead to the repetition of the abuse, which also inﬂuences
depression [63]. Despite the identity of the abuser, whether a
family member, a friend, a caregiver, an authority ﬁgure, or a
stranger, it still has severe negative consequences on the vic-
tims’ emotional well-being and their perception of those
around them [55]. In particular, traumatic experiences that
occur during early life, such as abuse, have a dramatic impact
on the development of schemas related to the perception of
one’s self, others, and the world [64]. In clinical practice, over
70% of clients report trauma because of abuse, which has
reformed their cognitive schemas, including their pattern of
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors compared to those who

4

had no history of any abuse or trauma [65]. Both psycholog-
ical and physical abuse adversely aﬀect self-esteem and self-
worth [66]. This trauma can also aﬀect social relationships,
with the individual feeling unworthy, isolated, and becoming
socially withdrawn [67].

4. Types of Abuse

Below, we discuss the development of depression in relation
to physical, psychological, and sexual abuse.

4.1. Physical Abuse. Physical abuse occurs as part of a constel-
lation of behaviors including authoritarian control, anxiety-
provoking behavior, and physical hurt or discomfort that is
perpetrated by any person close to the victim. A meta-
analysis by Stoltenborgh et al. [68] of 168 studies, with a com-
bined total of 9,643,299 participants, found the worldwide
prevalence of childhood physical abuse to be 17.7%, with a
substantial diﬀerence between studies based on the judge-
ment of professionals relative to self-report studies (0.3%
vs. 22.6%, respectively). The most prevalent forms of physical
abuse involve both physical punishment and domestic vio-
lence, which also aﬀect children in the family, even if they
are not the direct target [69, 70]. Cultural factors appear to
strongly inﬂuence the nature of physical abuse in most coun-
tries, depending on whether hitting, punching, kicking, or
beating is socially and legally acceptable [71]. If societies
endorse parents’ power, they tend to justify physical abuse
and may consider it acceptable [21]. When children are inad-
vertently harmed by their parents’ actions, some consider
this an act of abuse [72], while others require the harm to
be intentional for it to be deﬁned as abusive. One of the chal-
lenges of addressing potential child victims of abuse is that
parents or other close relatives may perceive their actions as
appropriate means of disciplining or guiding the behavior
of their children [71]. Thus, even if these actions were
harmful, the intent to abuse could be absent or diﬃcult to
establish. Some of the literature on child abuse explicitly
includes violence of any kind against children at home,
school, or other settings [69, 73].

In contrast to physical abuse, physical punishment of
children is still acceptable in many countries and not gener-
ally considered as an adverse childhood experience [74].
Whereas such practice has not been persistently confronted
by legal reform and/or public education, the few existing
prevalence studies suggest that it remains common [75–77].
It is now well-established that this practice is unhealthy for
children, with a strong association between physical punish-
ment and negative developmental outcomes [15]. A large
body of research has linked physical punishment with child
and adolescent social, emotional, cognitive, developmental,
and behavioral problems. In particular, corporal punishment
is a signiﬁcant factor in the development of violent behavior,
along with other problems, such as substance abuse, both in
childhood and in adulthood [78, 79]. A cross-sectional study
by Aﬁﬁ et al. [74] found that adults who reported being
spanked as children had increased risk of attempted suicide,
heavy drinking, and other drug use. This relationship was
still statistically signiﬁcant after adjusting for the experience

of physical and emotional abuse. In contrast, the depressed
aﬀect was no longer signiﬁcantly related to spanking after
this adjustment [74]. The limitations of this study, however,
include that it was based on self-report and retrospective in
nature, with single yes or no items to assess depressed aﬀect,
moderate to heavy drinking, street drug use, and suicide
attempt. As the authors point out, depressed aﬀect is not
the same as major depression [74].

A study by Taillieu and Brownridge [80] that examined
college students found both corporal punishment and psy-
chological aggression to be signiﬁcant predictors of lower
self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. However, the relation-
ship with depression could be oﬀset by a combination of
other factors, such as parental warmth, responsiveness,
support, and type and consistency of disciplinary style (e.g.,
punishing misbehavior vs. reinforcing desirable behavior).
Thus, corporal punishment may increase the risk of a later
depression if the family environment is adverse in other
ways. In contrast, psychological aggression remained a sig-
niﬁcant predictor of both lower self-esteem and anxiety, even
after accounting for these factors [80]. Although depression
was assessed through a well-validated multi-item question-
naire, some of the same limitations as in the Aﬁﬁ et al. [74]
study still apply, such as data is cross-sectional and retrospec-
tive, without any temporal or causal interaction observations.
Furthermore, single self-report and retrospective elements
were focused on both the sensitivity to spanking and mental
health eﬀects. Depressive aﬀect, for example, was analyzed
using one item rather than a sequence of questions required
to produce a depression scale. This was in addition to a sam-
ple that is likely not representative of the general population.
More longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the rela-
tionship between corporal punishment and depression, while
accounting for a number of other variables, including risk
and protective factors, such as those related to the family
environment, which can moderate this relationship.

Like other types of abuse, physical abuse is correlated with
depression and other types of psychopathology later in life [81].
A substantial association between abuse history and depression
has been well-established, but as discussed earlier, a direct cause
and eﬀect relationship remains elusive. For example, many
men and women who suﬀer from depression often reveal pain-
ful experiences related to physical abuse in their life [82]. Espe-
cially if the abuse occurs on a regular basis, it can lead to
chronic and extreme stress, and as discussed earlier, stress
related to abuse can negatively aﬀect the development of both
the nervous and immune systems. Other ways in which physi-
cal abuse can increase the risk of depression indirectly is by
feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem [83], and self-suﬀer-
ing, ultimately aﬀecting the individual’s ability to cope with
stressful situations [84]. Thus, individuals going through phys-
ical suﬀering also experience emotional suﬀering, and physical
suﬀering can intensify the negative emotions experienced in the
long term [85]. To cope with these negative emotions, the per-
son may internalize the pain or express it in undesirable and
maladaptive outbursts [86]. This helps explain, as adults, mal-
treated children are at an increased risk of behavioral, physical,
and mental health problems, including severe and more persis-
tent depression [87–89].

4.2. Sexual Abuse. According to the American Psychological
Association [90], sexual abuse refers to “an undesired sexual
activity, with perpetrators using force, making threats or tak-
ing advantage of victims not able to give consent,” in which
children and adults can be exploited for pleasure or gratiﬁca-
tion without consent [91]. Sexual abuse happens in diﬀerent
forms, such as indecent exposure, fondling or sucking of sex-
ual body parts, and forced sexual intercourse, whether it is
oral sex or involves penetration [92, 93]. Force in this case
does not only refer to physical force, but includes manipula-
tion, coercion, threats, and any situations where a person is
unable to consent. It is diﬃcult to summarize however the
prevalence of speciﬁc forms of sexual victimization among
adults because deﬁnitions and measurement approaches vary
substantially across studies [94]. A meta-analysis by Stolten-
borgh et al. [95] of 331 studies, with a combined total of
9,911,748 participants, found the worldwide prevalence of
child sexual abuse to be 11.8%, with a substantial diﬀerence
between studies based on the judgement of professionals rel-
ative to self-report studies (0.4% vs. 12.7%, respectively). One
reliable ﬁnding is that women experience sexual victimiza-
tion at a higher rate than men [96, 97]. Based on self-report
studies, the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse is 18% for
females compared to 7.6% for males [95]. This diﬀerence
could be, in part, due to a reluctance of men to disclose sexual
abuse for a variety of reasons, such as being perceived as weak
[95]. In contrast, no gender diﬀerences were found in the world-
wide prevalence of physical [98] or emotional abuse [99],
although a study by Meng et al. [96] did ﬁnd men were more
likely to be physically abused as children compared to women.
The eﬀects of sexual abuse on victims include guilt and
self-blame, self-esteem diﬃculties, poor sleep, suicidal idea-
tion, anxiety, and depression [100, 101]. Childhood sexual
abuse is a well-established risk factor for adult depression
[102, 103]. A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies
found positive associations between abuse during childhood
and adolescence, and adult depression [104]. Experiencing
sexual assault, including attempted and/or completed rape,
is uniquely pathogenic and associated with the elevated risk
for mental health issues when compared with other trau-
matic events [105]. A recent meta-analysis conﬁrmed that
the mental health impact of sexual assault is both broad
and targeted and increases the risk for most domains of
psychopathology, including trauma and stressor-related dis-
orders, anxiety, and depression [106]. A qualitative review
of the prevalence of various mental disorders in adult survi-
vors of sexual abuse found that 13-51% meet diagnostic
criteria for depression, 23-44% experience suicidal ideation,
and 2-19% attempt to suicide [107]. Although sexually
abused adults were at higher risk for many mental health
problems, the most prevalent issue was depression. Several
studies show that physical, emotional, and sexual abuse are
all related to an elevated risk of depression and anxiety disor-
ders in adulthood [108]. Other studies found a relationship
between the severity of abuse and neglect, and the develop-
ment of depression [109] and anxiety symptoms as an adult
[110]. Hence, the more severe the abuse and neglect are, the
more likely for the individuals to show symptoms of depres-
sion and anxiety.

Sexual harassment is another form of abuse, which is doc-
umented to have an overall negative and lasting impact on the
psychological function of victims. More than half of harass-
ment survivors [111] report negative consequences on their
well-being, including negative feelings, such as anger, anxiety,
fear, sadness, and depression [112]. The psychological impact
of sexual harassment is related to the type of harassment and
the context in which it occurs. For example, both occupational
and gender-based harassment have been characterized as
chronic stressors because of their often-unpredictable onset
and protracted duration [113]. Severe forms of sexual harass-
ment where an individual in authority either demands sexual
favors or implies that such favors are required to avoid nega-
tive, or receive positive, educational or occupational outcomes
can also involve actual bodily and sexual threat and injury.
Thus, some survivors of sexual harassment experience one
or more traumas, whereas others experience highly distressing
and upsetting events that do not include traumas [114]. Survi-
vors of childhood sexual abuse experience an increased risk of
negative feelings and psychological disorders, such as helpless-
ness, anxiety, and depression.

4.3. Psychological Abuse. Deﬁning psychological abuse, a
term often used interchangeably with emotional abuse, is dif-
ﬁcult. The consequences of psychological abuse, regardless of
how it is deﬁned, diﬀer depending on the context and the age
of the victim [23]. In general, like other types of abuse, it can
be deﬁned as an intentional behavior to communicate to the
victim that they have no value (i.e., they are worthless or
unwanted) or something is wrong with them [21]. Thus,
emotional abuse includes acts that disturb the emotional
health of the individual [115]. Such acts include restricting
a person’s movements (e.g., where they can go and who they
can interact with), denigration, ridicule, threats and intimi-
dation, discrimination, rejection, and other nonphysical
forms of hostile treatment [116]. Emotional abuse can repre-
sent an ongoing pattern of behavior, occurring across many
diﬀerent situations, or be limited to or triggered by a speciﬁc
situation. It is the least reported type of abuse, and its
prevalence is diﬃcult to estimate [21]. A meta-analysis by
Stoltenborgh et al. [99] of 46 studies, with a combined total
of 7,082,279 participants, found the worldwide prevalence
of childhood emotional abuse to be 26.7%, with a substantial
diﬀerence between studies based on the judgement of profes-
sionals relative to self-report studies (0.3% vs. 36.3%, respec-
tively). Prior research sometimes included the failure of a
caregiver to provide an appropriate and supportive environ-
ment as a part of emotional abuse [115]. Arguably, however,
this can be considered neglect. Neglect refers to the failure of
a parent or a caretaker to provide the necessities of life, such
as nutrition, healthcare, education, emotional safety, and safe
living conditions [117]. It is thus distinguished from circum-
stances of poverty in that it can only occur where reasonable
resources are available to the family or caregiver. A meta-
analysis of 16 independent samples, with a combined total
of 59,655 participants, found the worldwide prevalence of
childhood emotional neglect to be 18.4% [98].

The vast majority of studies on childhood abuse have
focused on the impact of either sexual or physical abuse

6

Depression Research and Treatment

[118], linking both types of abuse to adult depression [119,
120]. However, studies that have examined the impact of
multiple types of abuse have shown childhood emotional
abuse to be more strongly related to depression compared
to sexual and physical abuse [24, 26, 61]. Despite this, psy-
chological abuse against children received less attention glob-
ally than other types of abuse. Psychological health issues
caused by emotional abuse form a substantial portion of the
global burden of disease. While some mental health conse-
quences have been researched ([121], p. 47), others have only
recently been given attention, including psychiatric disorders
like major depression and suicidal behavior ([122], p.15).
When emotional abuse is severe and ongoing, a victim may
lose their entire sense of self, sometimes without a single
mark or bruise. Instead, the wounds are invisible to others,
hidden in the self-doubt, worthlessness, and self-hatred the
victim feels. In fact, many victims say that the scars from
emotional abuse last far longer and are much deeper than
those from physical abuse [123].

Several negative emotions are commonly self-reported by
victims of psychological abuse, including anger, fear, shame,
and guilt, which are also common indicators of depression
[124]. Empirical research dealing with the consequences of
childhood emotional abuse on adult functioning is scarce.
Yet, it is mostly related to low self-esteem, impaired interper-
sonal relationships, negative perception of the world, depres-
sive moods, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders,
and overall psychiatric symptomatology ([65, 125, 126],
p.75; [30, 127, 128]). Emotionally abused victims may adopt
a negative self-image [129] and believe that they are not
worthy of parental attention [130] due to the introjection of
parents’ harmful behavior such as criticism and insults
[131]. Adverse childhood experiences can lead to maladap-
tive behaviors (e.g., suicidal ideation and related behaviors)
through impairment of the self-concept ([132], p. 470).
Research suggests that maltreated children and youth have
lower self-esteem and are more likely to engage in a range
of risky behaviors, including substance abuse [133].

As for verbal abuse, which involves the use of words to
cause harm and belittle others, it is considered in many
cultures as a normal act, especially if it is used as a form of
discipline [134]. For instance, evidence suggests that many
parents consider shouting at their children a common harm-
less act [7]. However, this may cause emotional trauma and
result in a long-lasting harm. Ongoing, repeated verbal abuse
by parents, caretakers, or someone in a position of authority
can drastically aﬀect self-esteem, raise anxiety and confusion,
and contribute to clinical depression in vulnerable individ-
uals [135]. Constant assault on an individual’s autonomy
and sense of identity can erode their conﬁdence and self-
worth. Thus, it is not unusual for victims of verbal abuse to
become depressed, consistent with the correlation between
verbal abuse and feeling powerless or helpless [136].

The painful experiences of abuse can also aﬀect mood
regulation ([128], p.140). Therefore, in addition to low self-
esteem and the increase of negativity [133], these experiences
can lead to less eﬀective coping strategies [137], such as
rumination and behavioral avoidance, both associated with
emotional abuse during childhood and strongly related to

depression [138]. Experiences of early emotional abuse may
be particularly damaging since maltreatment is perpetrated
directly by primary attachment ﬁgures, which could have
greater potency in activating a negative model of the self
and others [25]. Such experiences can also increase attach-
ment insecurity, avoidance, and isolation, which also play a
signiﬁcant role in the development of depression [104]. As
already mentioned, consistent emotional abuse takes its toll,
leading to a breakdown in the ability to eﬀectively resist or
cope with these experiences ([132], p. 448). This is when
individuals are more likely to become depressed; unable to
escape anger, fear, shame, and guilt, they may attempt to
cope by inhibiting all of these emotions. For example, a per-
son who has diﬃculties revealing the concealed pain that
resulted from abuse may also be unable to eﬀectively under-
stand and deal with their depression [139], with possible neg-
ative implications for treatment outcomes.

5. Comparing the Impact of Different

Types of Abuse

Relatively few studies have addressed how diﬀerent types of
childhood abuse relate to developing depression in adult-
hood [140]. A recent meta-analysis by Nelson et al. [140]
compared eﬀect sizes for diﬀerent types of childhood mal-
treatment to the mean across all types. The types included
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as physical
and emotional neglect. They found that childhood emotional
neglect was the most common form of maltreatment in
depression (43.86% vs. mean of 31.9%) but that emotional
abuse was more strongly related to depression severity (a cor-
relation of 0.30 vs. mean of 0.25). The risk of depression,
however, did not depend on type, with a grand mean odds
ratio of 3.01. The highest odds ratios were for emotional
abuse and multiple forms of maltreatment (3.82 and 4.13,
respectively), consistent with other studies that have impli-
cated emotional (i.e., psychological) abuse in the risk for
depression (e.g., [24, 141, 142]) as well as found a dose-
response eﬀect where multiple types of childhood adversity
increase the risk for negative health outcomes [28].

A cross-sectional study by Hovens et al. [142] examined
whether childhood emotional neglect, as well as psychologi-
cal, physical, and sexual abuse, is related to current pure anx-
iety, pure depression, or comorbid anxiety and depression.
The participants were 1931 adults from the Netherlands
Study of Depression and Anxiety who reported on whether
they experienced either neglect or abuse before the age of
16. The study found that both emotional neglect and all types
of abuse increase the risk for psychopathology; therefore,
there was no unique relationship between the type of adver-
sity experienced and speciﬁc disorders. However, emotional
neglect and psychological abuse had a stronger relationship
with pure depression than pure anxiety [142]. After adjusting
for age, gender, and education, the odds ratio for pure anxiety
compared to no disorder was 2.03 for individuals who
reported at least some psychological abuse. The odds ratio
was 3.23 for pure depression compared to no disorder.
Overall, the odds were highest for comorbid anxiety and
depression [142]. A more recent cross-sectional study by

Depression Research and Treatment

7

Dye [141] compared 748 college students who self-reported
childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse or combined
physical and sexual abuse during childhood. The levels of
depression, anxiety, and stress were higher for those who
experienced emotional abuse compared to those who
reported only physical, sexual, or both physical and sexual
abuse. For example, the correlation between level of depres-
sion and emotional abuse was 0.387 compared to 0.212 and
0.170 for physical and sexual abuse, respectively [141].
Similar diﬀerences were observed between the correlations
for anxiety and stress. Thus, like in Hovens et al. [142], emo-
tional abuse was not a unique predictor of depression.

Another cross-sectional study by Meng et al. [96] com-
pared the prevalence of depression and other mental disor-
ders in a sample of 23,395 adults from the 2012 Canadian
Community Health Survey who self-reported childhood
physical and sexual abuse. As in the study of Hovens et al.
[142], the abuse took place before the age of 16. Meng et al.
[96] found increased risk of depression for both types of
abuse. The odds ratios for physical and sexual abuse were
comparable and ranged between 2 and 3. Once again, the
increased risk was not speciﬁc to depression. The risk was
also higher for other internalizing disorders, such as bipolar
disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, as well as
externalizing disorders, including alcohol and other drug
use disorders.

internalizing problems,

A cross-sectional study by Spinazzola et al. [143] found
evidence for somewhat distinct clinical proﬁles in victims of
psychological maltreatment,
including neglect and abuse,
compared to those of physical and sexual abuse in a sample
of 5616 children from the National Child Traumatic Stress
Network. Speciﬁcally, psychological maltreatment was the
including
strongest predictor of
depression and anxiety, as well as attachment and self-
esteem issues. In addition, it was also the strongest predictor
of substance abuse [143]. Similarly, in a cross-sectional study
of 378 adults, Powers et al. [24] found that both psychological
abuse and emotional neglect were more strongly related to
adult depression compared to both physical and sexual
abuse. A study of 176 adolescents and emerging adults with
depression by La Rocque et al. [144] also found evidence
for a distinct, age-dependent eﬀect of childhood emotional
abuse, but not physical and sexual abuse. The adolescents
with a history of emotional abuse reported less severe stress-
ful life events prior to the onset of their depression compared
to emerging adults, suggesting diﬀerences in response to
stress between the two age groups [144].

Thus, in general, emotional abuse appears to be at least
as, if not more, damaging when compared to other types of
abuse. Nonetheless, other research that has assessed diﬀerent
types of abuse has found nonsexual forms of abuse (i.e., phys-
ical and emotional abuse) to have similar consequences and
to include depression, anxiety, and behavioral problems,
such as aggression [145]. Vachon et al. [145] studied 1191
maltreated and 1099 nonmaltreated children from low-
income families, comparable in racial or ethnic diversity,
and other demographic factors. Both physical and emotional
abuse, as well as neglect, predicted similar and broad inter-
nalizing and externalizing problems, with sexual abuse not

related to either [145]. The authors also point out that sexual
abuse is less frequent and almost always accompanied by
other types of abuse. This lack of variability has a side eﬀect
of greatly reducing the correlation between sexual and non-
sexual maltreatment and making it very diﬃcult to tease
apart its consequences [145]. The authors argue that preven-
tion and treatment strategies should focus on targeting
underlying common factors, rather than being tailored to
speciﬁc types of abuse. Furthermore, emotional abuse should
not be dismissed as less important, as it causes comparable
harm to physical abuse [145].

6. Conclusion

Exposure to abuse has been consistently shown to increase
the odds of depression but also a variety of other mental
health problems. Longitudinal research has established that
the experience of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse
during childhood or adolescence is a risk factor for the devel-
opment of depression in adulthood. However,
future
research should focus on understanding the role of abuse in
the development and maintenance of depression in clinical
service to provide trauma-focused, cognitive-behaviorally
based treatments that should serve as a ﬁrst-line treatment
for child and adult survivors, who are experiencing abuse-
or trauma-related symptoms. Mental health practitioners
working with survivors of any type of abuse should under-
stand that it can lead to the development of both mental
and physical health symptoms and oﬀer evidence-based
treatment, including trauma-focused treatments as appropri-
ate. The mental health practitioner should also be aware of
the fact that many sexual victimization survivors have multi-
ple health concerns. There is a need for more research on the
impact of abuse history on response to treatment for issues
common among survivors. It is also vital to explore the his-
tory of abuse in referred cases to understand the underlying
dynamics of their symptomology. In order to provide eﬀec-
tive treatment to people with depression through psycholog-
ical interventions, it is important to speciﬁcally target the
underlying factors associated with abuse at any stage of their
life. Diﬀerent childhood adversities, with a particular empha-
sis on psychological, physical, or sexual types of abuse may
inﬂuence the speciﬁc etiological pathways in depression,
and understanding these pathways is beneﬁcial for develop-
ing individually tailored interventions. Relatively few studies,
however, have addressed the speciﬁc mechanisms through
which each type of abuse can increase the vulnerability for
depression later in life, with a general lack of longitudinal
research. Thus, the implementation of custom-tailored treat-
ments in clinical practice remains very diﬃcult.
