Abstract
This study examined types of and reactions to loss experienced by a sample of 162
undergraduate and graduate students in the United States amid the COVID-19 global
pandemic. Results indicated students reported an average of 6.33 losses with loss of
normalcy being the most prominent. The number of losses experienced was a sig-
nificant predictor of loss of control and avoidance. A significant positive relationship
was revealed between spirituality and positive reappraisal whereas a significant
negative correlation was identified between spirituality and loss of control and avoid-
ance. Age was also negatively associated with expressions of avoidance and loss of
control. Finally, students who attended faith-based institutions reported higher levels
of positive reappraisal and lower levels of loss of control. Results suggest the need
for educators and mental health practitioners to assess non-death losses among
college students and provide supportive interventions aimed at promoting
psychosocial-spiritual coping and resilience during and following a pandemic.

Introduction

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) and by March 11, 2020, it was characterized as a global
pandemic (WHO, 2021). At the time of this writing, over 32.9 million people
in the United States have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and over 587,000
people have died, resulting in many experiences of bereavement (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). While grief is most often associated with
loss following the death of a loved one, non-death losses also produce symptoms
of grief (Chew et al., 2020; Maddrell, 2020). Some of the most commonly
reported non-death losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic include
unemployment (Aucejo et al., 2020; Kecojevic et al., 2020), loss of connection
or isolation (Son et al., 2020), disruption of educational experience (Aristovnik
et al., 2020; Kecojevic et al., 2020; Son et al., 2020), loss of ritual or ceremony
(Maddrell, 2020), and loss of financial stability (Aristovnik et al., 2020;
Kecojevic et al., 2020).

Mental Health Implications

The long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at
this time, but short-term effects have been documented among various popula-
tions. In a study of 52,730 residents of China, 35% of participants reported
significant psychological distress as a result of the pandemic. Among those most
vulnerable to psychological distress were females, young adults, and migrant
workers (Qiu et al., 2020). Similarly, Wang et al. (2020) reported the COVID-19
pandemic impacted symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress among a
sample of 1,210 residents in China. Specifically, 53.8% of participants reported
mild to severe symptoms of depression, 36% reported mild to severe anxiety,
and 33% reported mild to severe stress (Wang et al., 2020). Son et al. (2020)
discovered that only a small percentage (5%) of participants who indicated the
pandemic increased their anxiety and stress sought mental health services. This
finding is consistent with Liang et al. (2020) who reported the mental health
support seeking rate during the initial months of the COVID-19 epidemic in
China was less than 1%. Overall, several studies have indicated individuals
experienced greater than usual rates of psychological distress during the pan-
demic (Ahmed et al., 2020; Gonza´ lez-Sanguino et al., 2020; Huang & Zhao,
2020; Moghanibashi-Mansourieh, 2020; Ozamiz-Etxebarria et al., 2020; Xiong
et al., 2020).

College Students & COVID-19

College students also experienced many stressors and losses from the pandemic.
In March and April of 2020, many residential college and university students in

Sirrine et al. 

747

the United States and abroad were required to move off-campus while most
traditional educational offerings were rapidly transitioned to a remote delivery
format (Binkley, 2020). Continuing throughout the 2020–21 academic year, col-
lege students, faculty, and courses were significantly impacted at various levels
depending on university and state guidelines. Students who preferred in-class
delivery options were abruptly required to participate via online or virtual
modalities. In a qualitative study of 163 college students, Kecojevic et al.
(2020) noted the most commonly reported pandemic academic difficulties
were the ability to focus on schoolwork (73.5%) and general adjustments to
online learning (58.6%). Furthermore, the authors reported increased academic
struggles were associated with higher rates of psychological distress (i.e., depres-
sion, anxiety, etc.) (Kecojevic et al., 2020).

Many

college

students

also experienced placement
in internships
disruptions or cancellations. In a study of 1446 undergraduate students,
Aucejo et al. (2020) reported 13% of students experienced an internship cancel-
lation as a result of the pandemic. In addition, 29% experienced unemployment
while 61% had a family member experience sudden unemployment. Many stu-
dents changed residences due to educational disruptions and were unable to
participate in rituals and ceremonies including graduations, weddings, or
funerals.

College students thrive on connection (Berger, 1997; Pretty, 1990), and the
pandemic’s social distancing requirements could have contributed to feelings of
isolation or loneliness. Struggles with a variety of unpleasant emotions amid the
including boredom, anxiety, frustration, anger,
pandemic have been noted,
hopelessness, and shame (Aristovnik et al., 2020). Mental health symptoms
resulting from the pandemic may have been exacerbated for individuals with
an existing mental health diagnosis. In a study of 908 young adults, Liu et al.
(2020) reported participants with a clinical mental health diagnosis experienced
higher levels of anxiety and grief for COVID-19 related issues. In a systematic
review examining the mental health implications of COVID-19, Xiong et al.
(2020) identified that college students were one of the most vulnerable popula-
tions for mental health concerns, consistently reporting more psychological dis-
tress than other populations.

Non-Death Loss

While much research has explored the effects of death loss on individuals, the
discussion of non-death loss is only emerging in current literature (Gitterman &
Knight, 2019; Smith & Delgado, 2020). Cooley et al. (2010) noted reactions
to non-death losses often mimic those of death losses. In a study of 253
undergraduate college students experiencing various types of death and
non-death losses (i.e., parental/sibling death, parental divorce, loss of grandpar-
(1999)
ent/close friend, and chronic illness/disability), Romanoff et al.

748 

OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 87(3)

identified participants who experienced loss also reported significant
differences in self-worth, feelings of loss of control, and outlook on life.
This finding was not dependent on the specific type of loss (i.e., death vs.
non-death).

College is a time of transition and change, so university students often expe-
rience loss and grief during this season of life. In a study of 269 collegians, Miller
and Servaty-Seib (2016) reported students experienced “existential, romantic,
and friendship losses” when transitioning to college and those losses were
negatively correlated with feelings of connection to the institution (p. 59).
Similarly, other studies have reported college students experience non-death
losses, including loss of friendships, loss of status, loss of identity, and loss of
control (Brown & Christiansen, 1990; LaGrand, 1985; Paul & Brier, 2001).
These losses can make college a difficult time for some students, so it is possible
the pandemic and its accompanying challenges broadened the scope of those
affected by loss.

Since non-death losses are sometimes disregarded by society or considered
less significant than death losses, they are often accompanied by disenfranchised
grief. Doka (1998) defined disenfranchised grief as an event, “in which a person
experiences a sense of loss but does not have a socially recognized right, role, or
capacity to grieve” (p. 3). Cohen (1996) noted college students who experienced
non-death loss reported greater levels of “disenfranchisement” than those who
experienced death losses. In a study of non-death loss among adolescents in
foster care, Mitchell (2018) stated, “the enfranchisement of their grief could
make a difference between positive and negative long-term outcomes” (p. 8).
In light of potential negative implications of disenfranchised grief associated
with non-death losses, it is imperative to evaluate the various types of losses
that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic and college student reactions
to those losses.

The Present Study

While several studies have sought to identify the implications of the pandemic
on college student mental health, there is a need to research the experiences and
reactions of grief and loss among college students as a result of the COVID-19
global pandemic. This study aimed to identify the most common non-death
losses experienced by undergraduate and graduate college students amid the
pandemic. At the time of writing, this study appeared to be the first of its
kind to assess and describe the reactions to those losses among this population,
including student levels of positive reappraisal, avoidance, and loss of control.
A tertiary aim was to identify whether spiritual beliefs influenced how college
students reacted to pandemic losses.

Methodology

Participants & Procedures

749

This cross-sectional study was approved by the university’s Institutional Review
Board (IRB). An invitation for student participation was provided on several
online websites, including the Chronicle for Higher Education’s “Higher Ed
and the Coronavirus” private Facebook Group and the Baccalaureate Social
Work Program Directors listserv. The invitation included information about
the survey as well as an email link for faculty to share with students. The principal
investigator also sent recruitment emails to students and faculty at a private,
liberal arts university in central Florida. They were invited to share the survey
opportunity via email or social media platforms with other college students.

Participants were required to be 18 years or older and currently enrolled as an
undergraduate or graduate student. One-hundred sixty-five participants con-
sented to participate in the survey; however, three surveys were not completed
and were not included in the sample. The final sample consisted of 162 under-
graduate and graduate college students from twelve states aged 18–70 with a
mean age of 27.02 (SD ¼ 11.74). The anonymous survey was administered
online via Survey Monkey and was available for completion between
November 30–December 16, 2020. All data were self-reported, and participants
completed an informed consent and demographic items followed by a
quantitative measure assessing their reactions to loss. All participants were
provided contact information for the Crisis Text Line and National Suicide
Prevention Lifeline at the end of the survey. The average time of survey
completion was 8 minutes, and respondents did not receive any compensation
for participation.

Measures
Demographics. Participants provided demographic information including age,
gender, ethnicity, race, institution type, and educational level. For the variable,
gender, participants self-identified using an open-ended response form.

Reactions to Loss Scale (RTL). The Reactions to Loss Scale (Cooley et al., 2010) was
utilized to measure college student reactions to loss. The RTL consists of
70-items on a 6-point Likert scale (1 ¼ Never, 2 ¼ Rarely, 3 ¼ Sometimes,
4 ¼ Often, 5 ¼ Very Often, 6 ¼ Always). The RTL provides a score for three
subscales: Positive Reappraisal, Avoidance, and Loss of Control. The RTL
has demonstrated good reliability and validity in prior studies of college student
loss (Cooley et al., 2010, 2013). In the present study, the internal reliability for
the RTL was a ¼ .94.

750 

OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 87(3)

The 21-item Positive Reappraisal subscale includes reactions that suggest
positive resilience in spite of the loss. Items include, “I started to see some
positives in my life after the loss,” “Changed or grew as a person in a good
way,” and “I am better able to empathize with others after the loss.” In the
current study, the positive reappraisal subscale reliability was a ¼ .87.

The 20-item Avoidance subscale assesses reactions that indicate avoidance of
the loss. Items include, “I tried to forget the whole thing,” “I refused to believe
this had happened,” and “I wished this was all over and behind me.” In the
current study, the avoidance subscale reliability was a ¼ .88.

The 29-item Loss of Control subscale includes the individual’s feelings of loss
of control of emotions and life experiences. Items include, “Felt lack of control
because of the loss,” “Missed classes because of the loss,” and “Cried about the
loss.” One item on this subscale (“Wrote in a journal about the loss”) was
inadvertently omitted from the survey instrument and was not included. The
reliability of this subscale in the current study (omitting the previously noted
item) was a ¼ .93.

Spirituality. Spirituality was assessed using one item adapted from the “Overall
Religious/Spiritual Coping Item” on the Brief Multidimensional Measurement
of Religiousness and Spirituality (BMMRS) developed by the Fetzer Institute
and National Institute on Aging (1999). The item states, “To what extent is your
religion involved in understanding or dealing with stressful situations in any
way?” In this study, the words “spirituality” and “faith” were added to the
item resulting in the following question: “To what extent is religion, spirituality,
or faith involved in your understanding or dealing with stressful situations in
any way?” Participants answered this question on the same 4-point Likert scale
used on the BMMRS with answer choices being “Not involved at all, Not very
involved, Somewhat involved, and Very involved.”

Types of Loss. Participants were asked to select any losses they have experienced
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A list of relevant losses was created
based on current COVID-19 research and anecdotal evidence including, “death
of a loved one to COVID-19,” loss of perceived safety,” “loss of normalcy,”
“loss of connection to others,” etc. Participants were also provided an oppor-
tunity to write in additional losses.

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic. The personal and educational
impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on participants was assessed through the following two
Likert-scale items: “The COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly impacted
my life” and “The COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly impacted my
college educational experience” (1 ¼ Strongly disagree, 2 ¼ Disagree, 3 ¼ Neither
agree nor disagree; 4 ¼ Agree, 5 ¼ Strongly agree).

Data Analysis

751

All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS), Version 27. Prior to conducting statistical analyses, data were screened,
and assumptions of each parametric test were verified (Mertler & Vannatta,
2005). Missing data associated with the study’s primary response set was min-
imal at 0.19% (n ¼ 22). The missing data were sufficiently random in nature
(MCAR x2 (770) ¼ 758.50; p ¼ .61). Statistical analyses including bivariate cor-
relations,
linear regression, MANOVA, and ANOVA were conducted as
described below. A rejection level of .05 was set prior to conducting analyses.

Results

Demographics

A total of 162 study participants completed the survey instrument. Several
demographic identifier variables were represented in the study including age,
gender, race, ethnicity, institutional type, and educational classification. Since
respondents were undergraduate and graduate students, participants ranged in
age from 18–70 with a mean age of 27.02. Sixty-three percent of respondents
(n ¼ 102) were between 18–23 years old and 67.9% (n ¼ 110) were undergraduate
students. Table 1 represents a summary of the descriptive representation of
study participants by demographic identifier.

Types of Loss

Participants were asked to select any losses they experienced as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The four most commonly reported pandemic losses were
loss of normalcy (90.1%), loss/change in educational delivery (85.8%), loss of
connection to others/isolation (82.7%), and loss of ritual including graduations,
weddings, etc. (60.5%). Just over 10% of participants experienced the death of a
loved one to COVID-19, and over 25% reported the death of a loved one caused
by something other than COVID-19. Table 2 summarizes the type of losses
reported by all participants.

Impact of Loss

Over 86% of participants indicated they strongly agreed or agreed with the
statement, “The COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly impacted my
life.” Similarly, over 84% of participants strongly agreed or agreed the
pandemic “has significantly impacted my college educational experience.”

There was a statistically significant negative correlation between educational
classification (undergraduate or graduate) and the impact of the pandemic on
educational experience (r ¼ (cid:2).277, p < .001),
indicating graduate students

experienced less disruption in educational delivery or experience than under-
graduate students.

Reactions to Loss

Bivariate correlations were conducted between key demographic variables and
all three subscales of the RTL. Age, dichotomized as 18–23 and 24 and older,
was negatively associated with the Avoidance (r ¼ (cid:2).16, p < .05) and Loss of
Control subscales (r ¼ (cid:2).18, p < .05), indicating older students reported less
avoidance and less loss of control. Institution type was dichotomized as faith-
based or secular. Results revealed a negative correlation between institution type

and the Positive Reappraisal subscale (r ¼ (cid:2).191, p < .05), indicating those who
attended faith-based institutions reported more positive reappraisal. There was
also a positive association between institution type and the Loss of Control
subscale (r ¼ .291, p < .001), indicating those who attended faith-based institu-
tions reported lower scores on the Loss of Control subscale. Educational clas-
sification was categorized as undergraduate and graduate students. A negative
association was found between educational classification and the Avoidance
(r ¼ (cid:2).170, p < .05) and Loss of Control subscales (r ¼ (cid:2).193, p < .05), indicat-
ing that as students increased in educational classification their avoidance of
grief reactions and feelings of loss of control decreased.

Number of Losses
Participants reported an average of 6.33 losses (SD ¼ 2.63) ranging from 1 to 13
losses. A correlational analysis of the number of losses and all three subscales of
the RTL was conducted. Findings revealed the number of losses was positively
associated with the Avoidance (r ¼ .498, p < .001) and Loss of Control subscales
(r ¼ .624, p < .001),
indicating participants who experienced more losses
reported more avoidance reactions and more feelings of loss of control.

A linear regression was conducted to assess whether the number of losses was
a predictor of scores on the Avoidance and Loss of Control subscales. The
results of these analyses are outlined in Tables 3 and 4.

This study sought to identify and explore college student reactions to the most
commonly experienced losses amid the COVID-19 global pandemic. Findings
suggested college students experienced a myriad of significant losses across their
personal and academic lives during the pandemic. The most commonly reported
was a loss of normalcy (90.1%). In addition, almost 86% of participants
reported a loss/change in educational course delivery or format. The long-
term implications of the abrupt shift to remote learning among college students
will not be known for several years.

Many participants (82.7%) reported a loss of connection to others/isolation.
A majority of respondents (60.5%) also experienced loss of ritual and almost
half reported a loss of friendships/relationships. This finding is consistent with
Son et al. (2020) who reported 86% of participants experienced a decrease in
social interaction during the pandemic. Social distancing requirements and the
transition to remote delivery learning options could have contributed to these
findings.

(Aristovnik et al., 2020; Aucejo et al., 2020; Kecojevic et al., 2020; Son et al.,
2020). It is essential for higher education providers, including mental health
practitioners, to acknowledge the non-death losses caused by the pandemic
and their impact on the well-being of undergraduate and graduate college
students.

This study also aimed to describe the reactions to loss experienced by college
students. Prior studies have identified between 22 and 33% of college students

Sirrine et al. 

757

are bereaved (Balk, 1997; Balk & Vesta, 1998; LaGrand, 1985; Servaty-Seib &
Hamilton, 2006). This presents a need to understand the grief experiences of
college students in general, with a unique assessment of their loss reactions amid
the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of this study indicated students experienced
various reactions to losses including positive reappraisal, avoidance, and loss of
control. Gitterman and Knight (2019) recommended mental health professio-
nals consider and assess ways in which client life circumstances and stressors
might contribute to overall feelings of loss and accompanying grief reactions.

Positive reappraisal refers to strategies in which students make meaning or
cope with an experienced loss. This concept is similar to resilience. Bonanno
(2004) defined resilience as “the ability of adults in otherwise normal circum-
stances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event,
such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to
maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical
functioning” (p. 20). Several items on the positive reappraisal scale had mean
scores above 4.00 in this study indicating positive coping skills and resilience
amid loss. College participants cited listening to music and engaging in laughter
as ways to cope with their losses, even though much in their lives had changed.
They also reported experiencing deeper love for some people in their lives and an
increased desire to help others. Despite the incredible losses experienced
throughout the pandemic, many college students in this study exhibited contin-
ued resilience.

Several studies have identified that multiple losses or cumulative grief can
have a significant impact on individuals (Cherney & Verhey, 1996; Graham-
Howard, 1993; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2005; Neugebauer & Rabkin, 1992).
Results of the present study indicated students who experienced more losses
also reported more negative coping reactions, including avoidance and loss of
control. While the long-term effects of cumulative pandemic losses are currently
unknown, Mercer and Evans (2006) reported individuals who experienced mul-
tiple losses at once often took longer to progress through their grief. This
presents a need for practitioners to provide additional support to college stu-
dents who experienced cumulative losses during the pandemic.

While not statistically significant, 71% of students in the present study
reported talking about the loss helped them feel better, but only a small per-
centage indicated they discussed the loss with a professor (32.1%) or counselor
(27.2%). This finding is consistent with previous research reporting low levels of
help-seeking among college students at the start of the pandemic (Liang et al.,
2020; Son et al., 2020). These findings present an opportunity for higher edu-
cation faculty and mental health practitioners to initiate conversations about
loss and support seeking with students while developing short and long-term
strategies for meeting the unique needs of this population.

A tertiary aim of this study was to identify whether spiritual beliefs influenced
college student reactions to pandemic losses. Spirituality and religious coping

758

have been reported to influence many aspects of life including psychological and
physical well-being (Koenig, 2015; Lucchetti et al., 2011; Pargament & Lomax,
2013; Skevington et al., 2013; Vitorino et al., 2016). The current study revealed
significant differences in levels of positive reappraisal, avoidance, and loss of
control for each level of spirituality. Students who reported higher levels of
spirituality also reported higher levels of positive reappraisal and lower levels
of avoidance and loss of control. These findings indicate spirituality may be a
protective factor in guarding against maladaptive reactions to loss, especially
during a pandemic.

Study Limitations

Despite the key findings, there were several limitations in this study that could
have impacted results. The availability sampling method limited variability on
certain demographic characteristics, including gender, race, and ethnicity. Over
80% of participants self-identified as female and/or white, which could have
significantly impacted findings. In addition, the cross-sectional design made it
difficult to assess whether participants would have scored the same on the RTL
at various points in time throughout the pandemic. Data collection also
occurred eight months into the pandemic toward the conclusion of the fall
2020 semester, requiring participants to recall some losses retrospectively.

The RTL Avoidance and Loss of Control subscales were highly correlated in
this study (r ¼ .831, p < .001), which may suggest measurement of a similar
construct. Further, one item on the RTL Loss of Control subscale was inad-
vertently omitted from the survey instrument. Finally, spirituality/religiosity was
measured using only one item which may not provide the same results as a more
robust measure of the construct. Despite these limitations, the study findings
present unique insights into the experiences and reactions to loss among a
sample of undergraduate and graduate university students amid the global
COVID-19 pandemic.

Implications for Practice and Research

This study’s findings suggest an opportunity for higher education faculty and
mental health practitioners to provide increased support for students experienc-
ing loss. Many non-death losses were identified by participants and some
resulted in reactions of avoidance and loss of control, especially among under-
graduate students and students who did not identify spirituality as a coping
mechanism. These findings present a need for current and ongoing psychosocial
support to be provided among this population.

Prior research supports the importance of acknowledging and validating non-
death losses as significant causes of grief. Gitterman and Knight (2019) sug-
in helping clients identify,
gested, “we must learn to be more intentional

Sirrine et al. 

759

manage, and work through non-death loss, that is, help them construct their
grief and make meaning of it” (p. 152). Practitioners and educators working
with college students should engage in open conversations to acknowledge pan-
demic losses, normalize accompanying grief, and provide support in coping.
Since the number of losses experienced was a predictor of loss of control and
avoidance in this study, practitioners should give special consideration and
assessment to clients who have experienced cumulative losses.

Institutions of higher education might also consider developing course con-
tent to educate and encourage students in developing positive reappraisal and
resilience strategies to aid in coping with pandemic losses. Spirituality was indi-
cated to impact reactions to loss in this study, so faith-based universities have a
unique opportunity to foster and promote spiritual practices that aid in coping
on their campuses. While such avenues for exploration are often integrated into
practice at faith-based institutions, this study’s findings indicate assessment of
spirituality, along with other protective factors, could be a beneficial addition to
grief assessments at secular organizations as well.

This study’s findings present a need for further research examining the short
and long-term impacts of COVID-19 pandemic losses, particularly non-death
losses, on college students. Longitudinal research assessing the lasting effects of
the pandemic on this cohort of college students would be informative. The RTL
was developed for use with college student populations, but there could be
benefit in piloting the measure for use with other populations experiencing
non-death loss. In addition, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders as well as most modern models of grief counseling only include
death loss
(American
in their descriptions of grief and bereavement
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Thus, more research is needed on non-death
losses, their accompanying grief reactions, and whether the trajectory of grief
is indeed similar for death and non-death loss.

Since the current study measured spirituality using only one item, a more
comprehensive measure of spirituality would be recommended for use in
subsequent pandemic loss studies. In addition, longitudinal data could help
determine whether spirituality promotes positive reappraisal and/or serves as
a long-term buffer for coping with pandemic loss and grief.

While drafting this article, many of the author’s colleagues inquired about
research pertaining to their own reactions of loss. Since educators and mental
health practitioners have been greatly impacted by the pandemic and its accom-
panying losses, including educational and service delivery adaptations, it would
be beneficial to study the reactions to loss and subsequent grief reactions
among this population. It would also be important to discover whether personal
experiences of pandemic losses impact a provider or educator’s ability to
empathically engage with and respond to the loss reactions of their students
and clients.
