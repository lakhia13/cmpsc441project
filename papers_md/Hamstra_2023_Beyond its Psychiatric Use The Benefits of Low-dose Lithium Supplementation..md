Abstract:  Lithium  is  most  well-known  for  its  mood-stabilizing  effects  in  the  treatment  of  bipolar 
disorder. Due to its narrow therapeutic window (0.5-1.2 mM serum concentration), there is a stigma 
associated with lithium treatment and the adverse effects that can occur at therapeutic doses. How-
ever, several studies have indicated that doses of lithium under the predetermined therapeutic dose 
used in bipolar disorder treatment may have beneficial effects not only in the brain but across the 
body. Currently, literature shows that low-dose lithium (≤0.5 mM) may be beneficial for cardiovas-
cular, musculoskeletal, metabolic, and cognitive function, as well as inflammatory and antioxidant 
processes of the aging body. There is also some evidence of low-dose lithium exerting a similar and 
sometimes synergistic effect on these systems. This review summarizes these findings with a focus 
on low-dose lithium’s potential benefits on the aging process and age-related diseases of these sys-
tems,  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  osteoporosis,  sarcopenia,  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes,  Alz-
heimer’s disease, and the chronic low-grade inflammatory state known as inflammaging. Although 
lithium’s actions have been widely studied in the brain, the study of the potential benefits of lithium, 
particularly at a low dose, is still relatively novel. Therefore, this review aims to provide possible 
mechanistic insights for future research in this field.  

Keywords: Cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, inflammaging, oxidative 
stress. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Lithium (Li) is a monovalent cation, medically known for 
its  mood-stabilizing  effects,  which  have  proven  extremely 
useful  in  the  treatment  of  acute  mania  and  recurring  manic 
episodes  and  to  prevent  the  risk  of  suicide  in  patients  with 
bipolar  disorder  and  schizophrenia  [1].  The  mechanisms  af-
fected by Li treatment in the brain mainly surround its ability 
to  compete  with  other  electrolytes,  including  sodium  (Na+), 
potassium  (K+),  calcium  (Ca2+),  and  magnesium  (Mg2+)  [2]. 
Due to its small ionic radius and monovalent characteristics, 
Li is able to compete for binding sites with ions of a similar 
size and conformational arrangement [3]. By competing with 
these ions, Li can influence the function of ion channels and 
pumps, ultimately altering brain biochemistry. In addition, Li 
has been shown to regulate the release of neurotransmitters, 
such  as  dopamine,  noradrenaline,  and  serotonin,  and  has 
been implicated in the regulation of cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate  (cAMP)  and  Ca2+-dependent  signalling  cascades 
[2,  4],  as  well  as  reducing  neuronal  myoinositol  levels

and  arachidonic  acid  turnover  in  neuronal  membranes  [4]. 
Many  of  these  mechanisms  involve  the  inhibition  of  glyco-
gen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), inositol monophosphatase 
(IMPase),  and  G-protein  coupled  receptors  (GPCRs),  which 
are found throughout different tissues in the body [1, 2]. It is 
through  these  collective  molecular  mechanisms  that  Li  is 
thought to exert its psychiatric benefits of reducing neuroex-
citability and suicidal ideation, although this research is still 
evolving. 

Li carbonate is the most prescribed Li salt, used primarily 
in the treatment of bipolar disorder. To exert these beneficial 
effects,  Li  is  administered  as  an  oral  tablet  at  a  therapeutic 
dose of 600-1200 mg/day to ensure it crosses the blood-brain 
barrier [1]. With such doses, serum Li levels typically range 
from  0.5-1.2  mM  [2].  Unfortunately,  these  relatively  high 
doses  of  Li  therapy  have  been  associated  with  adverse  ef-
fects,  which  include  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  other  notable 
electrocardiographic  changes,  muscle  tremors,  weight  gain, 
hypercholesterolemia,  hypothyroidism,  hyperparathyroidism 
and hypercalcemia, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and renal 
damage [2, 5]. However, many of these side effects are rare, 
reversible,  and  dose-dependent  [5].  Importantly,  these  rare 
adverse  events  associated  with  high  dose  Li  therapy  have

instilled a stigma with Li, leading to an underappreciation of 
the potential benefits of low-dose Li supplementation.  

Sources  of  dietary  Li  are  largely  dependent  on  the  geo-
graphical area as some regions, such as Northern Chile, have 
Li-rich soil, and therefore, have more Li uptake in their wa-
ter  supply,  plants,  and  grains.  Research  has  even  suggested 
that Li may in fact be an essential micronutrient [1, 6]. Stud-
ies  looking  at  Li  depletion  in  animal  models  have  shown  a 
marked  decrease  in  fertility  and  viability  of  offspring  [6], 
while  epidemiological  studies  in  humans  have  shown  that 
exposure to trace Li in tap water is inversely correlated with 
hospital  admission  for  mental  health,  aggressive  behaviour, 
all-cause mortality, suicide mortality, cardiovascular mortali-
ty, Alzheimer’s disease mortality, and the prevalence of met-
abolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes [7-11]. Togeth-
er,  these  studies  provide  the  first  indication  of  the  possible 
benefits  of  low-dose  Li  on  health  and  longevity.  In  this  re-
view,  we  will  extend  beyond  these  ecological  studies  and 
will highlight the current literature focusing on the underly-
ing cellular mechanisms that can contribute to the benefits of 
low-dose  Li  consumption.  Specifically,  we  introduce  a  con-
cept  by  which  low-dose  Li  may  confer  cellular  resilience 
against aging by reviewing the effects of Li on various age-
related  conditions,  including  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD), 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), obesity and diabetes, sarcopenia, 
osteoporosis, chronic low-grade inflammation, and oxidative 
stress.  For  the  purpose  of  this  review,  low-dose  Li  will  be 
described  as  doses  that  lead  to  serum  concentrations  ≤  0.5 
mM - the lowest defined therapeutic concentration for bipo-
lar disorder treatment. 

2.  LOW-DOSE  LI  AND  CARDIOVASCULAR  FUNC-
TION 

CVD remains one of the leading causes of death in North 
America [12, 13], and can be caused by abnormalities of the 
cardiac  muscle,  or  can  occur  secondary  to  pressure  or  vol-
ume overload due to abnormalities of the cardiac or systemic 
vasculature. These abnormalities put stress on the heart, forc-
ing it to adapt and compensate, which can sometimes lead to 
maladaptation  of  the  cardiovascular  system,  resulting  in  ar-
rhythmias, heart failure, and death [14].  

Current  literature  suggests  that  therapeutic  doses  of  Li 
can have adverse effects on the myocardium and myocardial 
development  in  patients  being  treated  for  bipolar  disorder. 
These  effects  include  T-wave  inversions  and  dysfunction  of 
the  sinoatrial  (SA)  and  atrioventricular  (AV)  nodes  leading 
to arrhythmias [15], concerns over cardiac malformations in 
the developing fetal heart of pregnant patients [16, 17], and 
reduced  contractile  response  to  adrenergic  signalling  and 
atrial fibrosis [18]. However, recent studies have shown that 
these risks are dose-dependent, with doses often exceeding a 
serum  [Li]  of  1.5  mM,  and  that  these  risks  are  much  lower 
than  originally  thought  [2,  17].  Conversely,  low-dose  Li 
supplementation may actually provide physiological benefits 
to cardiac muscle. 

2.1.  Low-Dose  Li  may  Promote  Physiological  Hypertro-
phy  

Despite the inability of adult cardiomyocytes to prolifer-
ate,  the  myocardium  is  still  able  to  adapt  to  stressors  and 
hormonal changes. This occurs through the process of cardi-

ac  hypertrophy,  in  which  adaptations  can  either  be  physio-
logical  or  pathological  in  nature.  Physiological  hypertrophy 
is  characterized  by  normal  organization  of  cardiac  structure 
and  normal  or  even  enhanced  cardiac  function,  whereas 
pathological  hypertrophy  is  commonly  associated  with  up-
regulation  of  fetal  genes,  fibrosis,  cardiac  dysfunction,  and 
increased mortality [19]. Physiological hypertrophy is stimu-
lated  by  processes,  such  as  growth  and  development,  preg-
nancy, and exercise training [20]. However, at other times, a 
hypertrophic  response  begins  as  an  acute  compensatory  and 
physiological mechanism that aims to increase cardiac output 
in  response  to  pressure  or  volume  overload,  myocardial  in-
farction (MI), arrhythmias, endocrine dysfunction, or genetic 
disorders  [21].  However,  chronic  hypertrophy  of  the  myo-
cardium caused by these conditions can soon become patho-
logical to the point where the heart can no longer work in a 
manner  sufficient  to  supply  oxygen  to  the  body,  let  alone 
meet its own metabolic demands [20]. 

Interestingly, patients with bipolar disorder are thought to 
have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared 
to  the  general  population  since  cardiovascular  and  cerebro-
vascular  disorders  are  the  most  common  cause  of  death  in 
this patient population [22, 23]. However, in a retrospective 
review  on  outpatients  attending  Li  clinics  in  metropolitan 
New York City, Prosser and Fieve showed a decreased like-
lihood  of  MI  with  Li  treatment  at  therapeutic  doses  [23]. 
Further, in a model of MI in rats, chronic low-dose Li thera-
py  starting  24  hrs  post-coronary  ligation  for  4  weeks  at  a 
dose of 1 mmol/kg/day (0.39 mM serum [Li]) led to a reduc-
tion of pathological ventricular remodelling post-MI [24]. Li 
is  known  to  activate  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1), 
which  triggers  the  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)/Akt 
signalling  pathway  [25,  26].  In  this  study,  the  activation  of 
PI3K  via  Li  enhanced  protein  translation  via  mammalian 
target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  signalling;  however,  at  the 
same time, it also led to improved left ventricular contractili-
ty  along  with  reduced  fibrotic  remodelling,  thereby  resem-
bling  physiological  or  functional  hypertrophy.  Indeed,  the 
activation  of  the  p110α  PI3K  isoform  by  Li  has  also  been 
shown to promote physiological hypertrophy over pathologi-
cal remodelling [24]. 

Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway also regulates GSK3 
activity,  a  well-known  serine/threonine  kinase  that  is  in-
volved  in  a  wide  range  of  signalling  pathways  in  the  body 
[27].  Li  inhibits  GSK3  both  directly  by  competing  with  its 
cofactor  of  activation  Mg2+  and  indirectly  by  activating 
PI3K/Akt,  which  phosphorylates  and  inhibits  GSK3  (Ser21 
on  GSK3α  and  Ser9  on  GSK3β  isoforms,  respectively)  [28, 
29]. GSK3β is the dominant isoform found in the heart and is 
constitutively active to prevent hypertrophy of the heart un-
der  normal  conditions  [30].  Though  in  pathological  condi-
tions, GSK3β signalling can also become maladaptive [31].  

One  of  the  many  functions  of  GSK3β  is  the  ability  to 
bind  to  the  promoter  of  the  ATP2a2  gene  and  prevent  the 
transcription  of  the  sarco(endo)plasmic  reticulum  Ca2+  -
ATPase (SERCA). SERCA is a Ca2+ handling protein found 
in  the  membrane  of  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  (SR)  and  is 
responsible for moving Ca2+ from the cytosol to be stored in 
the  SR,  essentially  regulating  cardiac  muscle  relaxation  and 
muscle contraction in an indirect manner through regulating 

The Benefits of Low-dose Lithium Supplementation

SR Ca2+ store. The importance of SERCA was made evident 
with a previous study showing that cardiac overexpression of 
the  dominant  cardiac  isoform,  SERCA2a,  increases  cardiac 
contractile function [32]. Moreover, a recent work from our 
lab  shows  that  treating  male  C57Bl/6J  mice  with  a  sub-
therapeutic dose of Li (10 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks leading to 
a  0.02  mM  serum  [Li])  leads  to  cardiac  GSK3  inhibition, 
increased  expression  of  SERCA2a,  and  improvements  in 
SERCA  activity  [11],  which  ultimately  enhance  stroke  vol-
ume and cardiac output. Despite its role in preventing cardi-
ac  hypertrophy,  inhibiting  GSK3  did  not  lead  to  any  altera-
tions  in  cardiac  muscle  size  or  histology,  suggesting  that 
with  this  dose  of  Li,  only  cardiac  muscle  function  was  im-
proved [12]. In this same study, we also found a significant 
decrease  in  the  expression  of  SERCA  regulator  phosphol-
amban (PLN), which acts as an inhibitor of SERCA by bind-
ing  to  the  SERCA  pump  and  reducing  its  affinity  for  Ca2+ 
[11]. To our knowledge, GSK3 itself does not regulate PLN 
expression in the same way in which it regulates SERCA2a. 
Therefore,  we  speculate  that  this  effect  of  Li  in  lowering 
PLN  could  be  occurring  via  a  GSK3-independent  pathway 
[33]. In this respect, Li has been shown to activate autophagy 
through its regulation of IMPase [34]. A work by Teng et al. 
has shown that PLN can be targeted by autophagic degrada-
tion  in  cultured  mouse  neonatal  cardiomyocytes  (CMNCs) 
[35]. Therefore, it is possible that Li treatment could induce 
autophagic degradation of PLN, but this requires further in-
vestigation. Nevertheless, the reduction in PLN and increase 
in  SERCA  with  Li  treatment  increase  the  ratio  of  the  Ca2+ 
pump  relative  to  its  inhibitor  PLN,  which  could  lead  to  im-
provements in SERCA and cardiac function. 

While promising, it is important to acknowledge the con-
cern  that  chronic  inhibition  of  GSK3  in  the  heart  may  con-
tribute to hypertrophy [36]. For example, Tateishi et al. have 
shown the inhibition of GSK3 with 20 mg/kg/day Li to have 
an additive effect on cardiac hypertrophy in aortic banding in 
rats (a model of pressure overload hypertrophy) [37]. Specif-
ically,  cardiac  weight  was  significantly  increased  post-
surgical  intervention  along  with  significant  increases  in 
thickness  of  the  posterior  wall  and  interventricular  septum 
[37].  However,  whether  these  changes  were  associated  with 
impairments  in  contractility  (i.e.,  stroke  volume,  fractional 
shortening, etc.) was not specifically examined in this study, 
and  thus,  we  are  unable  to  determine  whether  the  additive 
effect  of  Li  resulted  in  pathological  or  functional  hypertro-
phy. Future studies could examine the effect of Li on cardiac 
contractility and SERCA function in the aortic banding mod-
el. 

2.2. Low-Dose Li and Vascular Function 

The  maintenance  of  healthy  vasculature  is  important  for 
maintaining cardiac and overall health. Vascular dysfunction 
can contribute to the development and progression of pathol-
ogies by altering blood flow and pressure, leading to reduced 
oxygen delivery and metabolite transport to and from various 
organs,  respectively,  as  well  as  increasing  the  workload  of 
the  heart,  contributing  to  the  development  of  cardiomyopa-
thies  and  eventual  heart  failure  [38].  Vascular  dysfunction 
can occur due to injury to the endothelial layer within blood 
vessels, often seen in atherosclerosis, and can occur naturally 
as  we  age,  causing  impairments  in  endothelium-dependent 

vasodilation  [39].  The  development  of  atherosclerosis  and 
impairments in endothelial function are significant contribu-
tors  to  the  development  of  age-related  CVD,  and  therefore, 
preserving endothelial function and preventing the formation 
and  build-up  of  atherosclerotic  plaque  are  important  thera-
peutic targets for maintaining vascular health [38, 40]. 

In the late 1960s, an ecological study by Voors showed a 
correlation  between  tap  water  hardness  and  risk  of  athero-
sclerotic  heart  disease  (AHD),  specifically  showing  higher 
prevalence  in  cities  lacking  Li  in  their  tap  water  [41].  In 
1970, Voors showed correlations between six elements (cal-
cium,  chromium,  lithium,  magnesium,  vanadium,  and  zinc) 
in drinking water that had suspected effects on AHD risk and 
their  correlations  with  AHD  mortality  of  caucasian  inhabit-
ants  across  100  U.S.  cities.  Among  these  elements,  Li  had 
the  strongest  negative  correlation  with  AHD  mortality  and 
the  highest  proportion  of  human  absorption  from  drinking 
water compared to the other 5 elements [42]. Since this time, 
work has been done to determine a more causal relationship 
between  lithium’s  effects  on  the  body  and  atherosclerotic 
risk. 

In  the  development  of  atherosclerosis,  endothelial  injury 
induces  the  expression  of  adhesion  molecules  that  recruit  T 
cells  and  monocytes  locally.  Monocytes  differentiate  into 
macrophages  and  begin  to  consume  lipids,  becoming  foam 
cells that lie within the vascular intima. Foam cells accumu-
late in the intima and form atherosclerotic plaques producing 
inflammatory  mediators,  which  increase  the  risk  of  further 
endothelial  injury  and  plaque  formation  [43].  Left  un-
checked,  a  build-up  of  plaque  narrows  the  vasculature,  in-
creasing  total  peripheral  resistance,  which  the  heart  must 
work against. A study by Choi et al. investigated the effects 
of  low-dose  (10  mg/kg/day)  LiCl  treatment  in  a  model  of 
atherosclerosis  induced  by  high-fat  feeding  in  the  ApoE-
deficient  (ApoE-/-)  mouse,  a  model  lacking  the  cholesterol 
metabolic  regulator  apolipoprotein  E  (APOE).  In  high-fat 
diet-fed  (HFD)  mice  given  LiCl  for  6-  and  14  weeks,  there 
was a significant decrease in blood glucose levels and ather-
osclerotic  lesions  in  the  aorta  and  aortic  valve  compared  to 
HFD alone in ApoE-/- mice. From a mechanistic perspective, 
LiCl treatment also decreased vascular adhesion molecule-1 
(VCAM-1) expression, allowing for a reduction in monocyte 
binding to the endothelial wall, preventing the accumulation 
of macrophages in the intima [43]. In addition, GSK3 activi-
ty  has  been  suggested  to  increase  levels  of  free  fatty  acids 
(FFA),  potentially  leading  to  increased  low-density  lipopro-
tein (LDL), which contributes to the formation of foam cells 
[44].  Choi  et  al.  showed  no  differences  in  plasma  FFA  or 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL); however, they did observe a 
reduction 
the  14-week 
LiCl+HFD conditions compared to HFD alone, suggesting a 
potential decrease in plasma LDL levels with LiCl treatment. 
The  potential  effects  of  LiCl  and  GSK3  on  lipid  profile 
should be examined more closely to further understand their 
possible  protective  effects  in  atherosclerotic  development 
[43].

Endothelial function is another important factor in vascu-
lar  health  that  is  impacted  by  aging.  Specifically,  the  endo-
thelium,  which  makes  up  the  inner  lining  of  the  arteries, 
maintains  vascular  tone,  prevents  adhesion  of  platelets  and 

894    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4

inflammatory  cells,  promotes  the  breakdown  of  fibrin,  and 
limits  vascular  proliferation.  When  these  functions  are  im-
paired, endothelial dysfunction can contribute to atheroscle-
rosis, increase blood pressure, tissue ischemia, and infarction 
[38].  Perhaps  the  best-known  role  of  the  endothelium  is  to 
promote  vasodilation  by  secreting  nitric  oxide  (NO)  that 
causes the neighbouring smooth muscle cells to relax. As we 
age, however, there is reduced NO bioavailability as a result 
of  elevated  oxidative  stress, 
impairing  endothelium-
dependent  vasodilation,  which  ultimately  increases  blood 
pressure and total peripheral resistance [45]. Together, these 
factors can cause stress on the myocardium leading to patho-
logical remodelling of the heart, further increasing the risk of 
developing cardiomyopathies and progression to heart failure 
[20]. 

Throughout the literature, there have been conflicting re-
sults  related  to  the  effects  of  Li  on  vasodilation  [46-49].  In 
2007, Afsharimani et al. conducted a chronic LiCl treatment 
in rats giving them 600 mg/L LiCl for 30 days resulting in a 
0.3  mM  serum  Li  concentration.  This  treatment  was  shown 
to increase endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in arteries 
of  the  mesenteric  vascular  bed.  The  mechanism  behind  this 
action was suggested to be through the inhibitory effect of Li 
on  IMPase,  which  reduces  the  production  of  inositol-3,4,5-
phosphate  (IP3)  and  decreases  Ca2+  release  from  the  endo-
plasmic reticulum (ER). This inhibition reduces intracellular 
free Ca2+ concentrations, resulting in less cellular stress due 
to  Ca2+  overload  in  the  cytosol  [47].  However,  not  much 
later, Rofouyi et al. found that isolated rat mesenteric arteries 
pre-treated with Li (0.5 and 1.0 mM LiCl) had inhibited en-
dothelium-dependent  vasodilation,  and  could  only  observe 
improvements  in  endothelium-dependent  vasodilation  with 
supra-therapeutic  doses  of  Li  (2  and  2.5  mM  LiCl)  [48].  In 
this work, the authors suggested that the decrease in intracel-
lular  Ca2+  may  actually  limit  NO  bioavailability,  which  is 
plausible  since  nitric  oxide  synthase  (NOS)  is  a  Ca2+/  
calmodulin dependent enzyme [50]. However, later in 2016, 
Bosche  et  al.  published  two  papers  investigating  varying 
concentrations of LiCl pre-treatment of isolated arteries [46, 
49]. The first used concentrations varied from 0.4 mM (low 
dose)  to  100  mM  (supra-therapeutic  dose)  in  mouse  aorta 
and  pig  middle  cerebral  arteries.  In  these  experiments,  the 
authors observed the opposite effect of increasing Li concen-
trations  compared  to  the  results  of  Rofouyi  et  al.,  since  0.4 
mM  LiCl  slightly  improved  endothelium-dependent  vasodi-
lation, whereas increasing the concentrations to 0.8 mM and 
100  mM  progressively  decreased  endothelium-dependent 
vasodilation  [49].  Mechanistically,  Bosche  et  al.  suggested 
that such high concentrations of Li cause too much inhibition 
of  IMPase  and,  like  Rofouyi  et  al.  suggested,  the  resulting 
decrease in Ca2+ lowers NO availability, and therefore, vaso-
relaxation  [17].  Their  second  paper  then  looked  at  a  sub-
therapeutic range of 0.2-0.4 mM LiCl in isolated mouse aorta 
and  pig  middle  cerebral  arteries.  Interestingly,  within  this 
sub-therapeutic  range  of  LiCl,  the  authors  found  a  dose-
dependent increase in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation 
in cerebral and vascular arteries [46].  

Despite these discrepancies, one thing that appears to be 
clear  is  that  Li  (at  any  concentration)  has  no  effect  on  the 
relaxation  of  vascular  smooth  muscle  cells  independent  of 
the endothelium [46-49]. However, more research is needed 

to  investigate  the  mechanism  behind  the  dose-dependent 
effects  of  Li  on  endothelium-dependent  vasorelaxation.  Fu-
ture studies should focus on the long-term treatment of Li (at 
varying  doses)  in  in  vivo  models  for  a  better  understanding 
of  its  potential  therapeutic  mechanisms  in  physiologically 
relevant conditions. 

2.3.  Summarizing  the  Impact  of  Li  on  Cardiovascular 
System  

Low doses of Li, mainly in the form of LiCl salt, have an 
effect  not  only  on  myocardial  function  and  adaptation,  but 
also  on  vascular  health.  By  activating  PI3K/Akt  signalling 
pathways,  low-dose  Li  has  the  potential  to  increase  cardiac 
contractile  function  by  inhibiting  GSK3  and  promoting 
SERCA2a  expression  while  potentially  promoting  cell  sur-
vival  by  inducing  autophagy  through  inhibition  of  IMPase. 
The  inhibition  of  GSK3  and  IMPase  seen  with  low-dose  Li 
treatment  in  the  vasculature  has  also  been  shown  to  affect 
endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation while also preventing 
macrophage  infiltration  and  foam  cell  formation,  ultimately 
leading to reduced stiffening and occlusion of arteries caused 
by  vascular  injury  and  dysfunction  (Fig.  1).  By  producing 
these effects, low-dose Li has the strong potential to provide 
cellular  resilience  against  cardiovascular  aging;  however, 
this warrants future investigations. 

3.  LOW-DOSE  LI  AND  MUSCULOSKELETAL 
HEALTH  

Functional  decline  of  the  musculoskeletal  system  occurs 
inevitably  with  aging,  often  in  the  form  of  sarcopenia  and 
osteoporosis [51]. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone 
mineral density (BMD), deterioration of bone mineralization, 
and  decreased  bone  strength,  leading  to  increased  risk  of 
fractures  [52].  Osteoporosis  is  also  more  likely  to  occur  in 
post-menopausal women compared to aging men due to the 
loss of estrogen, which has anti-inflammatory and Ca2+ regu-
latory  functions  [53].  Specifically,  both  women  and  men 
naturally  begin  losing  bone  in  the  third  decade  of  life  at  a 
rate of 0.5-1 % per year, but around menopause, women start 
losing  bone  at  an  accelerated  rate  of  2-3  %  per  year.  Men 
lose bone more slowly as they age, with a higher rate of bone 
loss after about the age of 65 [54, 55]. Similarly, age-related 
sarcopenia  is  a  combined  decline  in  muscle  mass  and 
strength starting at the age of 50. From this age, muscle mass 
decreases  at  a  rate  of  1-2%  per  year,  and  muscle  strength 
starts  declining  by  1.5%  per  year  and  accelerates  to  3%  per 
year  after  the  age  of  60  [56,  57].  Sarcopenia  is  associated 
with  other  health  implications  involving  metabolism  and 
immunity;  however,  reduced  mobility  and  disability  are  the 
most  critical  risk  factors  for  sarcopenia  [57].  Importantly, 
changes in muscle mass and strength are also associated with 
the changes in bone health and development, where declines 
in  muscle  strength  and  mass  have  been  associated  with  in-
creased risk of fragility fractures and lower BMD [58].  

3.1. Low-Dose Li and Osteoporosis  

There is some speculation in the literature suggesting that 
chronic  Li  treatment  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorder  in-
creases  the  risk  of  osteoporosis  and  bone  turnover  by

Fig. (1). Low-dose lithium affects myocardial and vascular endothelial function. In the myocardium (left panel), low-dose Li has been shown 
to activate the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway to promote physiological hypertrophy by increasing mTOR signalling and inhibiting GSK3 activ-
ity. Low-dose Li can also inhibit GSK3 directly, which allows for increased function of the SERCA pump, potentially enhancing contractile 
function. Li can also inhibit IMPase, increasing autophagy and potentially reducing the expression of SERCA inhibitor PLN. In the vascula-
ture (right panel), low-dose Li reduces expression of VCAM1, leading to reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation and its associated inflam-
mation.  The  inhibition  of  IMPase  by  Li  also  regulates  intracellular  calcium  ([Ca2+]i)  levels,  reducing  reactive  oxygen/nitrogen  species 
(RONS) and increasing availability of nitric oxide (NO) to increase endothelium-dependent vasodilation. (A higher resolution/colour version 
of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

increasing  parathyroid  hormone  (PTH)  levels,  which  in-
crease serum Ca2+ concentration via bone excretion [59, 60]. 
However,  given  its  well-known  effect  on  GSK3  activity,  Li 
therapy  has  also  been  shown  to  promote  bone  formation, 
with  varying  effects  on  bone  resorption  [61].  Indeed,  alt-
hough  more  research  is  needed  to  investigate  the  effects  of 
differing doses, compounds and durations of Li treatment on 
bone  health,  the  current  literature  suggests  that  when  con-
sumed  in  low  doses,  Li  may  have  a  positive  effect  on  bone 
structure and function [60]. 

In a recent study, we found that young (3-6 months old) 
male C57BL/6J mice fed a low dose of LiCl (10 mg/kg/day 
of LiCl over a 6 weeks period and serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) 
exhibited  significant  inhibition  of  GSK3  in  the  femur  [62]. 
GSK3 is a negative regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway, 
a  well-known  anabolic  pathway  in  bone  [63].  When  Wnt 
ligands  are  present  and  bind  to  the  Frizzled  (FZD)  receptor 
and  co-receptors  LRP5  or  LRP6,  Wnt  signalling  is  “turned 
on”  [64].  The  active  FZD  receptor  stimulates  disheveled 
protein,  which  prevents  the  formation  of  the  destruction 
complex  made  up  of  GSK3β,  APC  and  axin.  Within  this 
complex,  GSK3β  phosphorylates  β-catenin,  marking  it  for 
proteolytic  degradation.  However,  upon  Wnt  activation, 
GSK3β is unable to phosphorylate β-catenin, allowing for β-
catenin to accumulate and translocate into the nucleus, where 
it stimulates translation of Wnt target genes, such as alkaline 
phosphatase,  Runx-2,  and  osterix,  promoting  the  prolifera-
tion  and  differentiation  of  osteoblasts  and  the  production  of 
osteoprotegerin  (OPG)  [64,  65].  OPG  is  secreted  by  osteo-
blasts  and  acts  as  a  decoy-receptor  for  receptor  activator  of 
nuclear  factor-ĸB  ligand  (RANKL),  preventing  the  for-

mation,  proliferation,  and  activation  of  osteoclasts  (bone-
resorbing  cells)  [61,  65].  In  our  previous  study,  and  along 
with GSK3 inhibition in the femur, we also observed a sig-
nificant  increase  in  OPG  expression  with  no  change  in 
RANKL, ultimately leading to an increase in bone formation 
by sub-therapeutic Li supplementation in healthy young male 
mice [62]. 

In a genetic model of osteoporosis, Lrp5 knockout (Lrp5-/-) 
mice,  low-dose  Li  treatment  also  enhanced  bone  formation 
[66].  These  mice  lack  the  LRP5  co-receptor,  leading  to  im-
pairments in Wnt activation and thus declines in bone mass 
and  BMD  and  enhanced  skeletal  fragility.  Clément-Lacroix 
et al. investigated the effects of a daily 4-week low-dose Li 
treatment  (200  mg/kg/day  via  oral  gavage,  0.4  mM  serum 
[Li]). As Li can inhibit GSK3 in the absence of Wnt activa-
tion via Mg2+ competition and Ser9 phosphorylation, Li was 
able  to  bypass  the  defect  in  Wnt  signalling.  In  the  end,  this 
resulted  in  an  increase  in  bone  formation  rate,  trabecular 
number,  bone  volume  fraction,  and  the  number  of  osteo-
blasts, ultimately leading to a bone mass that was restored to 
near wild-type (WT) levels [66]. In another model of osteo-
porosis  induced  by  ovariectomy,  2  weeks  of  low-dose  Li 
treatment  (20  mg/kg/day  estimated  serum  [Li]  =  0.35-0.37 
mM) enhanced fracture healing when Li treatment started at 
7 or 10 days post-femoral-fracture [67]. When measured at 4 
and  6  weeks  post-fracture,  biomechanical  testing  of  the  fe-
mur  revealed  that  rats  treated  with  Li,  again  for  only  2 
weeks,  had  increased  maximum  torque  [67].  The  authors 
suggest that the improved effect of Li treatment is a result of 
taking advantage of naturally increased Wnt signalling in the 
healing  process,  where  the  Li  treatment  provides  additional

Hamstra et al. 

Wnt  activation  and  GSK3  inhibition,  thereby  speeding  up 
osteoporotic  fracture  healing  [67,  68].  Together,  these  stud-
ies  show  that  low-dose  Li  may  act  to  prevent  or  slow  the 
progression of bone loss and may also improve the outcome 
after an osteoporotic fracture.  

3.2. Low-Dose Li and Sarcopenia  

Sarcopenia is described as an age-related decline in mus-
cle mass and strength. It is thought to be caused by a reduc-
tion in physical activity and mobility, malnutrition, low pro-
tein  intake,  changes  in  hormones  and  metabolism,  systemic 
inflammation, and a loss of motor neurons due to neuromus-
cular aging [69]. GSK3 is a well-established negative regula-
tor  of  muscle  mass  that  inhibits  protein  synthesis  and  pro-
motes  protein  breakdown  [70,  71],  and  has  recently  been 
suggested  to  be  a  potential  therapeutic  target  for  conditions 
of  muscle  disuse  atrophy,  including  age-related  sarcopenia 
[72]. Recent work from our lab has shown that low-dose Li 
(0.5 mM) augments myoblast fusion and myogenic differen-
tiation in C2C12 cells by activating the Wnt signalling path-
way  [73].  Myoblast  fusion  is  a  critical  component  of  the 
muscle regenerative process, whereby after an injury, muscle 
stem  cells  (satellite  cells)  are  activated  to  differentiate  and 
repair damaged muscle. This is important as diminished my-
ogenic differentiation and fusion capacity are thought to con-
tribute to age-related muscle loss [74]. While our study is not 
the first to showcase the myoblast fusion augmenting effect 
of  Li,  it  is  important  to  note  that  most  studies  have  utilized 
supraphysiological  levels  of  Li  exceeding  1  mM  in  concen-
tration [75-78]. 

In  vivo  and  with  a  much  smaller  dose  of  Li  (10  mg/kg/ 
day  for  6  weeks;  serum  [Li]  =  0.02  mM),  we  have  also  re-
cently shown that supplementation increases muscle strength 
and  fatigue  resistance  in  young  (3-6  month  old)  male  mice 
[79].  Specifically,  we  found  that  low-dose  Li  increased 
force-producing  capacity  in  the  soleus  and  extensor  digi-
torum  longus.  The  exact  mechanisms  leading  to  the  in-
creased  muscle  strength  with  Li  supplementation  remain 
unknown,  but  we  suspect  that  its  effect  on  myoblast  fusion 
could enhance muscle quality. In addition, we also found that 
Li supplementation enhanced fatigue resistance in the soleus 
muscle  [79].  This  result  was  associated  with  an  increase  in 
slow-oxidative  fibres.  Generally  speaking,  muscle  is  com-
prised of slow-oxidative and fast-glycolytic fibres that differ 
in  metabolic  machinery  and  contractile  characteristics  (i.e., 
force  produced  and  kinetics)  [80].  In  the  context  of  aging, 
where  sarcopenia  primarily  affects  the  fast-glycolytic  fibres 
[56], promotion of the oxidative fibres with Li supplementa-
tion could be seen as beneficial. This shift towards the oxida-
tive fibre type occurs due to the inhibition of GSK3 that was 
observed with Li [79]. In the muscle cell, GSK3 antagonizes 
the  oxidative  fibre  type  by  inhibiting  calcineurin  signalling 
and  the  nuclear  localization  of  nuclear  factor  of  activated  
T-cells (NFAT) [72]. Interestingly, a recent study found nat-
urally  occurring  (i.e.,  without  supplementation)  plasma  Li 
levels  to  be  positively  correlated  with  endurance  exercise 
performance  in  sixty-five  high-level  middle  and  long-
distance runners [81], which appears to support our previous 
findings  in  the  rodent  model.  Whether  this  is  due  to  differ-
ences  in  fibre  type  composition  should  be  investigated  in 
future  studies.  Altogether,  low-dose  Li  supplementation 

could potentially combat age-related declines in muscle mass 
and  strength;  but  this  should  be  specifically  tested  in  both 
male and female aged mice and/or humans to also determine 
if biological sex may have an effect.  

3.3. Effects of Exercise and Li on Muscle and Bone  

In  both  conditions  of  sarcopenia  and  osteoporosis,  aero-
bic and resistance training are recommended to try to main-
tain muscle and bone strength and prevent further wastage of 
these  tissues  [82,  83].  Exercise  induces  mechanical  signals 
for cytoskeletal and transmembrane-bound proteins, such as 
integrins,  which  elicit  increased  Wnt/β-catenin  signaling  in 
the  bone,  promoting  bone  formation  and  suppressing  bone 
resorption. These signals also affect mesenchymal stem cell 
differentiation  into  osteoblasts  [84].  Mechanical  stimulation 
by different types of exercise also inhibits the expression of 
the  GSK3  activator,  sclerostin.  Sclerostin  is  an  osteokine 
secreted by the osteocytes in response to mechanical unload-
ing, which, when active, binds to LRP5 and LRP6 to prevent 
binding of the Wnt ligand and subsequent Wnt signalling and 
GSK3  inhibition.  Thus,  sclerostin  expression  is  increased 
during  periods  of  immobilization,  contributing  to  increased 
GSK3  activity  seen  with  functional  musculoskeletal  decline 
[85]. In muscle, aerobic exercise increases oxidative capaci-
ty,  which  increases  the  resistance  to  fatigue  by  increasing 
mitochondrial  biogenesis  through  the  promotion  of  peroxi-
some proliferator-activated  receptor-gamma  coactivator-1α 
(PGC-1α)  expression.  Conversely,  resistance  training  in 
muscle  produces  anabolic  effects  through  increased  mTOR 
signalling,  allowing  for  increased  muscle  protein  synthesis 
[86].  IGF-1  is  also  produced  by  muscle  through  mecha-
notransduction  and  contributes  to  muscle  protein  synthesis 
and anti-catabolic pathways [87].  

To our knowledge, there have been no published studies 
looking at a combined effect of Li, at any dose, and exercise 
on muscle or bone structure and strength. However, a recent 
study from our lab examined the association between chang-
es  in  serum  Li  and  changes  in  total  muscle  strength  and 
markers of bone turnover in university-aged males who have 
undergone  12  weeks  of  resistance  exercise  training  while 
supplementing with Greek yogurt [88, 89]. Interestingly, we 
found that serum Li decreases with exercise training, poten-
tially  by  being  secreted  through  sweat.  However,  serum  Li 
levels were maintained with exercise when Greek yogurt was 
consumed 3 times a day on training days and 2 times a day 
on non-training days. We presume that this is due to the fact 
that  dairy  products,  such  as  yogurt,  can  act  as  a  dietary 
source  of  Li,  with  Greek  yogurt  containing  0.07  ±  0.04 
mg/kg of Li [90]. Furthermore, we found maintaining serum 
Li levels with resistance training to be positively associated 
with  greater  gains  in  total  muscle  strength  and  markers  of 
bone turnover [91]. Specifically, we found changes in serum 
Li  to  bepositively  associated  with  the  P1NP:CTX  ratio, 
which  provides  a  marker  for  bone  formation  over  bone  re-
sorption.  P1NP  is  procollagen  type  1  N-terminal  propeptide 
and  CTX  is  β-isomerized  carboxy-terminal  cross-linking 
telopeptides, and both are commonly used markers for bone 
formation and turnover, respectively, which are also recom-
mended  for  clinical  use  by  the  International  Osteoporosis 
Foundation  [92].  As  dairy  products,  such  as  Greek  yogurt, 
also  contain  calcium,  protein,  phosphorus,  and  potassium 

The Benefits of Low-dose Lithium Supplementation

that  may  also  impact  musculoskeletal  health,  we  also  con-
trolled  for  these  additional  components  in  our  analyses.  As 
expected,  correlations  between  serum  Li  and  total  strength 
and  the  P1NP:CTX  ratio  were  found  to  be  weakened  after 
controlling  for  these  factors  [91].  Nevertheless,  our  recent 
findings  suggest  that  dietary  Li  in  Greek  yogurt  may  be  an 
additional  component  that  contributes  to  muscle  and  bone 
anabolism,  so  future  studies  should  examine  the  effects  of 
dietary Li and exercise in young and old men and women. 

3.4. Summarizing the Impact of Li on the Musculoskele-
tal System  

As our population continues to age, the functional decline 
of  the  musculoskeletal  system  also  continues  to  increase. 
Although  many  medications  used  in  the  treatment  of  osteo-
porosis  focus  on  preventing  resorption,  low-dose  Li  may 
have  potential  effects  in  promoting  bone  formation  and/or 
suppressing  bone  resorption  and  improving  fracture  healing 
mainly  through  its  direct  and  indirect  inhibition  of  GSK3β 
and its subsequent effects on Wnt/β-catenin signalling. This 
same mechanism of GSK3 inhibition may also help maintain 
skeletal  muscle  function  through  improvements  in  calcineu-
rin signalling, which could prove useful in both the treatment 
of  sarcopenia  and  in  the  maintenance  of  bone  strength  and 
structural integrity (Fig. 2). With regular exercise as a com-
mon  prescription  for  the  treatment  and  prevention  of  func-
tional musculoskeletal decline, it has been postulated that the 
addition of low-dose Li treatment could enhance the anabolic 
effect of exercise on these systems. Although there is limited 
work  in  this  area,  there  is  promising  correlational  data  be-
tween  combined  exercise  and  low-dose  Li  supplementation 
in human subjects that warrant further investigation.  

4. LOW-DOSE LI AND OBESITY AND DIABETES  

The  prevalence  of  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
(T2DM) continues to rise at an alarming rate. Aging plays a 
critical role in the development of these metabolic disorders, 
and  there  is  a  growing  concern  related  to  them  from  health 
and economic standpoints as the global population continues 
to  age  [93,  94].  Obesity  is  defined  as  a  body  mass  index 
(BMI) of 30 kg/m2 and is caused by a positive energy imbal-
ance, where the amount of calories consumed far exceeds the 
amount of calories expended, leading to excessive accumula-
tion of fat that could negatively impact health and quality of 
life [94]. This accumulation of fat tissue puts individuals at a 
substantially higher risk for developing insulin resistance and 
progression  to  T2DM  [95].  T2DM  occurs  when  cells  of  the 
skeletal  muscle,  liver,  and  adipose  tissues  have  a  reduced 
response to insulin and can arise from several different fac-
tors,  including  reduced  physical  activity,  poor  diet,  aging, 
and/or genetics. The reduced response or resistance to insulin 
causes the β-cells of the pancreas to work harder to produce 
more  insulin  and  to  try  to  make  up  for  the  lack  of  response 
from the peripheral tissues [96]. However, this causes chron-
ic  stress  on  the  β-cells  eventually  leading  to  reduced  secre-
tion  of  insulin  and  subsequent  hyperglycemia  [95,  96].  To-
gether, both obesity and T2DM increase the risk of develop-
ing  many  other  serious  conditions,  such  as  cardiovascular 
diseases,  reduced  pulmonary  function,  systemic  inflamma-
tion,  neurocognitive  decline,  and  increased  stress  on  joints 
[93,  94].  As  such,  current  research  efforts  have  heavily  fo-

cused on the discovery of novel therapeutic agents and strat-
egies  aimed  at  combating  these  metabolic  disorders.  Of  in-
terest, we have recently shown, at the population level, trace 
levels of Li found in publicly available drinking water to be 
negatively associated with the prevalence of obesity and dia-
betes across the state of Texas [8]. 

4.1. Low-Dose Li and Obesity 

Li  therapy  has  been  associated  with  increased  weight 
gain  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorder;  however,  it  is  uncer-
tain if Li itself is the actual cause of weight gain in this pa-
tient  population  [97].  It  is  important  to  note  that  not  all  pa-
tients taking Li experience weight gain, and those with bipo-
lar disorder are already at risk of obesity, independent of any 
medication  [98].  Moreover,  recent  studies  in  rodent  models 
have  shown  that  low-dose  Li  supplementation,  with  levels 
well  below  those  used  for  bipolar  disorder,  may  attenuate 
diet-induced  obesity.  In  the  study  by  Choi  et  al.,  14-week 
treatment  of  HFD-fed  ApoE-deficient  mice  with  10  mg/kg/ 
day  LiCl  led  to  significantly  attenuated  weight  gain  com-
pared  to  untreated  HFD-fed  ApoE-deficient  mice  [43].  Re-
cently,  using  the  same  dose,  Jung  et  al.  found  that  LiCl 
treatment for 12 weeks blunted HFD-induced weight gain in 
male Sprague Dawley rats, an effect similar to that seen with 
exercise training [99].  

In our lab, we recently treated both chow-fed and HFD-
fed male C57BL/6J mice with 10 mg/kg/day for 6 (chow) or 
12 (HFD) weeks (Geromella et al.). Though we did not see 
any differences in body mass or fat composition, we did find 
that  LiCl-treated  mice  consumed  more  calories  throughout 
the  treatment  protocol.  This  effect  is  consistent  with  the 
mechanisms  thought  to  contribute  to  the  increased  risk  for 
developing  obesity  with  high-dose  Li  therapy;  however,  the 
increase  in  caloric  consumption  did  not  accord  with  an  in-
crease in body mass. In fact, after calculating the metabolic 
efficiency  or  the  body  mass  gained  per  kCal  consumed 
[100],  we  found  that  Li  treatment  reduced  metabolic  effi-
ciency  under  chow  and  HFD-fed  conditions  (Ryan  et  al.). 
This result was associated with elevations in total daily ener-
gy  expenditure,  which  we  attribute  to  an  effect  of  Li  on 
stimulating adaptive thermogenic mechanisms.  

Adaptive thermogenesis is the process by which chemical 
energy  is  dissipated  as  heat  in  response  to  prolonged  cold 
exposure or caloric excess, leading to enhanced combustion 
of  metabolic  substrates  (i.e.,  fatty  acids  and  glucose)  [101]. 
Since  obesity  is  a  result  of  an  energy  surfeit,  promoting 
adaptive thermogenesis and energy expenditure may be use-
ful  in  fighting  off  excessive  adiposity  [102].  In  mammals, 
there  are  two  primary  sites  for  adaptive  thermogenesis:  1) 
skeletal  muscle  and  2)  brown/beige  adipose  tissue  [103, 
104].  In  skeletal  muscle,  SERCA-mediated  Ca2+  cycling  is 
the  primary  mechanism  for  adaptive  thermogenesis  [102-
104]. Under optimal conditions, SERCA has a 2:1 coupling 
ratio, which suggests that SERCA transports 2 Ca2+ ions into 
the  SR  for  every  1  ATP  hydrolyzed.  However,  SERCA-
mediated Ca2+ transport can be uncoupled by ATP hydrolysis 
via  interaction  with  sarcolipin  (SLN)  [105-109]  or  neu-
ronatin (NNAT) [110], thereby increasing the energetic cost 
of the SERCA pump in muscle. In brown and beige adipose 
tissue, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) uncouples mitochondri-
al  proton-motive  force  from  ATP  synthesis,  providing  a  fu-

898    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Hamstra et al. 

tile  energetic  cycle  that  drives  the  combustion  of  metabolic 
fuels [111]. Beige adipocytes are of particular importance in 
the context of obesity, since they are thought to be a distinct 
type  of  adipocyte  found  within  white  adipose  tissues  (fat-
storing cells), which when activated, become a more brown-
like  cell.  Since  obesity  is  characterized  by  an  abundance  of 
white adipose tissue, activating these cells’ sensitivity to the 
beiging process would be advantageous. In our recent work, 
we  found  that  the  elevated  energy  expenditure  and  lowered 
metabolic efficiency seen with Li supplementation in chow- 
and  HFD-fed  mice  were  caused  by  an  increase  in  either 
SERCA uncoupling or white adipocyte ‘beiging’ (Geromella 
et  al.).  Future  studies  from  our  lab  will  determine  whether 
low-dose Li can prevent HFD-induced obesity under pair-fed 
conditions  and  whether  biological  sex  can  influence  the  ef-
fect  of  Li  on  energy  homeostasis,  as  most  studies  to  date 
have solely used male rodents. 

4.2. Low-Dose Li and T2DM  

T2DM most commonly occurs when blood glucose levels 
are chronically elevated to the point where not enough insu-
lin  can  be  produced  by  the  pancreas  to  remove  it  from  the 
blood and store it in tissues [112]. When blood glucose lev-
els rise, insulin is secreted by the pancreas and binds to insu-
lin  receptors  in  the  liver,  skeletal  muscle,  and  fat  cells  to 
elicit  glucose  uptake  and  clearance  from  circulation.  For 
example,  in  muscle,  the  binding  of  insulin  to  its  receptor 
leads to a sequence of events that cause the translocation of 
vesicles containing glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the cell 
membrane  [113],  allowing  for  glucose  entry  into  the  cell 
where  it  can  be  stored  as  glycogen  or  utilized  to  produce 
ATP  [112].  However,  in  T2DM,  insulin-sensitive  tissues, 
such  as  skeletal  muscle,  become  non-responsive  to  insulin, 
eventually  leading  to  β-cell  exhaustion  and  a  reduction  in 
insulin levels. 

Since  the  1960s,  Li  has  been  known  to  exert  insulin-
mimetic effects [114-116], improving glucose homeostasis in 
patients taking Li as medication [117-119]. Conversely, dis-
continuation  of  Li  therapy  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorder 
has  been  associated  with  transient  diabetes  [120],  which  al-
together  showcases  the  effect  of  Li  on  improving  glucose 
homeostasis. The benefits of Li on glucose homeostasis have 
been  attributed  to  the  inhibition  of  GSK3  and  subsequent 
increase in muscle glycogen production, the enhancement of 
the  insulin  signaling  cascade,  GLUT4  translocation,  as  well 
as its effects on IP3 metabolism and intracellular Ca2+ levels 
[99, 114, 121, 122]. With respect to low-dose Li supplemen-
tation, Choi et al. found plasma glucose levels to be signifi-
cantly  decreased  in  ApoE-deficient  mice  fed  an  HFD  along 
with  LiCl  (10  mg/kg/day)  compared  to  untreated  HFD-fed 
ApoE-deficient mice with both 6 and 14 weeks of treatment 
[43]. Moreover, Jung et al. found that 12 weeks of Li treat-
ment (10 mg/kg/day) lowered blood glucose and insulin lev-
els in HFD-fed male Sprague Dawley rats to levels similar to 
that  of  chow-fed  controls  [99].  Strikingly,  this  effect  of  Li 
treatment  was  similar  to  that  observed  with  exercise  and 
high-fat  feeding,  suggesting  that  at  least  to  some  extent,  Li 
may  provide  similar  benefits  to  metabolic  health  as  regular 
exercise.  We  recently  raised  this  point  in  a  previous  study, 
where  low-dose  Li  supplementation  inhibited  GSK3  in  the 
soleus,  leading  to  enhanced  fatigue  resistance,  as  regular 

exercise  is  also  known  to  enhance  muscle  performance 
[123].  Collectively,  the  current  literature  suggests  that  low 
doses  of  Li  may  still  produce  the  insulin-mimetic  effects  in 
rodents, where it can offset the deleterious effects of an HFD 
on  glucose  regulation.  Future  studies  should  examine  the 
importance  of  biological  sex  and  should  attempt  to  extend 
these findings to the human population. 

4.3. Low-Dose Li and Type 1 Diabetes 

While the present review focuses on the role of low-dose 
Li in age-related conditions, such as obesity and T2DM, it is 
important  to  acknowledge  the  literature  that  also  suggests 
that Li may benefit those living with type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
T1D is known as insulin-dependent diabetes and is a chronic 
condition where the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient 
amounts of insulin. In the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mu-
rine  model  of  T1D,  acute  microdose  (40  mg/kg  single-day 
injection)  Li  therapy  improved  hyperglycemia,  attenuated 
body  weight  loss  and  signs  of  diabetic  kidney  injury  [124]. 
Mechanistically,  this  effect  was  due  to  the  inhibition  of 
GSK3, which protected the pancreatic cells against oxidative 
stress. This pancreatic protective effect was also observed in 
STZ  mice  treated  with  either  LiCl  or  Li  carbonate  for  28 
days  (10  and  8.9  mg/kg/day,  respectively),  where  Li  treat-
ment  attenuated  hyperglycemia,  weight  loss  and  polydipsia 
[125]. Finally, Jung et al. also found that low-dose Li treat-
ment  improved  insulin-mediated  glucose  removal  in  the 
STZ-induced mouse model of T1D [81, 99].  

4.4. Summary of the Effects of Li on Metabolic Health  

Although  Li  has  been  thought  to  be  associated  with 
weight  gain  in  patients  with  bipolar  disorders,  our  findings 
show  that  low-dose  Li  in  various  models  appears  to  have 
beneficial effects on energy and fat metabolism, which could 
potentially have therapeutic implications for the treatment of 
obesity  and  T2DM  (Fig.  3).  In  fact,  GSK3  inhibition  via 
low-dose  Li  may  provide  antioxidant  effects  that  protect 
pancreatic  cells  from  damage,  and  therefore,  along  with  its 
well-known  insulin-mimetic  effects,  may  also  prove  to  be 
beneficial in the treatment of T1D (Fig. 3). So far, very few 
studies have looked at low doses of Li treatment in vivo, and 
there are still discrepancies in how effective these doses are 
in  regulating  glucose  metabolism.  Therefore,  we  can  only 
speculate  that  consistent  treatment  over  a  period  of  time  in 
animal  models  may  elicit  similar  effects  as  those  shown 
above  and  that  perhaps  combining  exercise  and  insulin 
treatment  with  low-dose  Li  may  have  synergistic  effects  in 
combatting  obesity  and  obesity-induced  insulin  resistance 
and hyperglycemia. 

5.  LOW-DOSE  LITHIUM  AND  ALZHEIMER’S  DIS-
EASE  

Cognitive decline is a naturally occurring aspect of aging, 
normally  starting  after  the  age  of  65.  However,  the  preva-
lence  of  dementia,  which  is  defined  as  the  development  of 
cognitive deficits that interfere with activities of daily living, 
also  increases  with  age,  doubling  every  5-6  years  after  the 
age  of  65  [126].  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD)  is  estimated  to 
make up about 60-80% of dementia cases and presents clini-
cally as cognitive dysfunction, loss of memory, and changes 
in  personality.  It  can  develop  early  in  life  due  to  familial 
genetic predisposition, known as familial AD [127], or it can

Fig. (2). Potential benefits of low-dose lithium in bone and muscle. Low-dose Li directly and indirectly inhibits GSK3 activity to allow for 
Wnt signalling in bone and muscle, which promotes accumulation and translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus. Transcription of Wnt target 
genes increases the expression of osteoprotegerin in the bone to promote bone formation during growth and healing. Wnt signalling also pro-
motes  transcription  of  myogenic  regulatory  factors,  which  promote  muscle  growth  and  repair.  The  inhibition  of  GSK3  also  enhances  cal-
cineurin signalling and the dephosphorylation of NFAT, which allows for its nuclear translocation and transcription of slow oxidative genes, 
ultimately promoting fatigue resistance in skeletal muscle. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy 
of the article). 

Fig. (3). Effects of low-dose lithium on glucose regulation, energy expenditure, and the pancreas. Low-dose Li reduces plasma glucose levels 
and increases adaptive thermogenesis in skeletal muscle and adipose through its inhibition of GSK3 activity. By inhibiting IMPase, low-dose 
Li  reduces  intracellular  calcium  levels  ([Ca2+]i]),  relieving  oxidative  stress  in  pancreatic  cells  allowing  for  insulin  production,  and  further, 
GSK3 inhibition. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).

Fig. (4). Neuroprotective effects of low-dose lithium treatment. By inhibiting GSK3 activity in the brain, low-dose Li reduces the formation 
of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid beta (Aβ) production and accumulation, while also reducing neuroinflammation and promoting 
expression of neuroprotective brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to support neuronal function and survival. Low-dose Li also reduces 
neuroinflammation  in  a  GSK3-independent  manner  by  increasing  autophagy  and  reducing  the  accumulation  of  unfolded  proteins  through 
inhibition of IMPase. Since autophagy also has a role in Aβ clearance, the enhancement of autophagy with Li may also help in lowering Aβ 
levels (dashed line). (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

develop  later  in  life  (age  65+)  due  to  environmental,  meta-
bolic, viral, or genetic factors, and is known as sporadic AD 
[128].  Late-onset  sporadic  AD  makes  up  more  than  95%  of 
AD  cases  [127].  The  exact  mechanisms  that  initiate  AD 
pathogenesis  are  still  largely  unknown;  however,  the  most 
well-known  pathological  processes  involved  are  the  devel-
opment of Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau pro-
tein,  leading  to  a  build-up  of  neurofibrillary  tangles  (NFT) 
commonly  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  and  hippocampus  [129]. 
With  a  cure  for  AD  remaining  elusive  and  a  global  popula-
tion  that  continues  to  age,  it  is  imperative  that  researchers 
find ways to prevent and slow the progression of AD.  

Li is well-known to have multiple neuroprotective effects 
that  can  be  used  against  AD  pathology.  In  fact,  numerous 
studies in patients receiving Li for bipolar disorder have re-
ported  lower  rates  of  dementias,  including  AD  [9,  23,  130-
132].  The neuroprotective effects of Li are pleiotropic, act-
ing on several different pathways, and have been thoroughly 
reviewed elsewhere [133, 134]. In brief, Li can offer neuro-
protection  by  inhibiting  GSK3  and  subsequent  NFT  for-
mation;  lowering  Aβ  levels  through  reductions  in  beta-
secretase-1 (BACE-1) expression/activity and the promotion 
of  autophagic  clearance;  increasing  neuroprotective  hor-
mones,  such  as  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF); 
and  lowering  inflammation  and  oxidative  stress  (Fig.  4) 
[133-137].  Furthermore,  the  insulin-mimetic  effects  of  Li 
could  also  be  of  benefit,  as  those  with  metabolic  disorders, 
such as obesity and T2DM, are at higher risk of developing 
neurocognitive  disorders,  such  as  AD  [138].  Many  consider 
AD  to  be  a  metabolic  disorder  with  impairments  in  glucose 
and insulin regulation, often referring to AD as type 3 diabe-
tes [139].  

5.1. Low-Dose Li and Alzheimer’s Pathology  

While  cognitive  benefits  have  been  observed  in  patients 
undergoing Li therapy, there have been studies that show the 
therapeutic  potential  of  low-dose  Li  for  AD  [9,  140-143]. 
Using  an  ecological  approach,  we  and  others  have  shown 
negative associations between trace Li in tap water and Alz-
heimer’s  disease  mortality  [7,  144,  145].  In  a  nested  case-
control study performed by Kessing et al., the authors found 
an  increase  in  AD  incidence  rate  ratio  (IRR)  with  Li  expo-
sure  in  drinking  water  ranging  from  0.5-10  µg/L;  however, 
when  Li  exposure  in  drinking  water  increased  above  10.1 
µg/L, there were subsequent decreases in the IRR [145]. Alt-
hough,  in  another  recent  report  conducted  in  the  U.S., 
groundwater  Li  levels  were  not  associated  with  rates  of  de-
mentia  after  controlling  for  local  health  care  resources  and 
other  demographics,  thereby  questioning  whether  trace 
amounts  of  Li  can  really  exert  a  neuroprotective  effect  and 
prevent/slow  the  progression  of AD  [146].  This  stresses  the 
need  for  future  studies  that  systematically  examine  the  ef-
fects of low-dose Li on AD and dementia using randomized 
controlled trials and longitudinal approaches.  

One  study  conducted  in  2013  by  Nunes  et  al.  evaluated 
the effects of microdose (300µg/day) Li treatment on cogni-
tive function in patients with AD over 15 months. They ob-
served  no  changes 
in  mini-mental  state  examination 
(MMSE) among Li-treated patients compared to control pa-
tients  who  exhibited  progressive  declines  in  MMSE  scores 
throughout  the  study  [142].  Although  serum  [Li]  was  not 
measured given that Li was provided in the microgram level, 
the  serum  concentrations  of  Li  would  presumably  be  well 
below the therapeutic range. Thus, it appears as though low-

 
 
The Benefits of Low-dose Lithium Supplementation

dose  Li  can  provide  a  stabilizing  effect  that  delays  the  pro-
gression  of  AD.  In  a  later  study  by  Nunes  and  colleagues, 
they  treated  the  J20  mouse  model  of  AD  (characterized  by 
progressive amyloid deposition) with a microdose of Li (0.25 
mg/kg/day) for either 16 months (starting at 2 months of age) 
or  10  months  (starting  at  8  months  of  age).  Interestingly, 
both WT and J20 mice treated with the microdose of Li (10 
and 16 months) had improved spatial memory as assessed by 
Barnes  maze  and  elevated  plus  maze  [147].  Moreover,  they 
found that starting the Li microdose treatment at 2 months of 
age had a more profound effect of attenuating the formation 
of  senile  plaques,  neuronal  loss  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  and 
hippocampus,  while  also  increasing  BDNF  in  the  cortex 
[147].  Therefore,  at  least  in  rodents,  microdose  Li  can  be 
used to prevent and slow AD pathology.  

In another study conducted by Wilson and colleagues us-
ing the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model of AD, an 
even  lower  dose  of  Li  (40  µg/kg)  in  a  more  bioavailable 
formulation known as NP03 was shown to provide neuropro-
tective  effects  [136].  NP03  is  a  reverse  water-in-oil  micro-
emulsion  which,  when  administered  via  the  transmucosal 
route, avoids breakdown via the gastrointestinal and hepatic 
systems,  making  the  contained  lithium  dose  more  available 
to  the  central  nervous  system  [148].  Transgenic  rats  were 
treated during the early pre-plaque development phase (start-
ed at 3 months of age and treated for 8 weeks) when Aβ pep-
tides  begin  accumulating  in  the  intraneuronal  compartment, 
thereby  disrupting  synaptic  plasticity.  NP03  Li-treated  rats 
demonstrated  salvaged  novel  object  recognition  and  fear 
memory as well as reduced spatial learning impairments in-
duced  by  Aβ  accumulation  compared  to  vehicle-treated 
transgenic  rats.  The  authors  also  observed  recovered  levels 
of  inhibitory  phosphorylation  of  GSK3β  relative  to  total 
GSK3β,  as  well  as  reduced  Bace1  mRNA  and  BACE1  ac-
tivity  levels,  leading  to  lowered  levels  of  neurotoxic  Aβ 
[136].  In  another  recent  study,  Wilson  et  al.  evaluated  the 
effects  of  the  NP03  Li  microdose  formulation  in  older 
McGill-R-Thy1-APP  transgenic  rats,  where  they  started 
treatment at 13 months of age for a total of 12 weeks [143]. 
As with younger transgenic rats, NP03 rescued impairments 
in  novel  object  memory  and  lowered  levels  of  neurotoxic 
Aβ. In addition, the authors found that NP03 reduced mark-
ers  of  neuroinflammation  and  oxidative  stress  in  the  trans-
genic  rats,  which  altogether  suggests  that  microdose  Li,  in 
the  form  of  NP03,  is  effective  in  both  young  and  old  trans-
genic rats, thus preventing and treating AD. 

5.2.  The  Effect  of  Exercise  and  Low-Dose  Li  on  Neuro-
protection  

Not surprisingly, exercise can prevent and even counter-
act cognitive decline, and physical inactivity is a major risk 
factor for the development of AD [149-151]. The neuropro-
tective effects of exercise, like Li, can occur through several 
pathways, including but not limited to improvements in glu-
cose  regulation  and  insulin  signalling  [149,  150,  152,  153], 
increases  in  BDNF  expression  [149],  and  reductions  in  oxi-
dative  stress  and  inflammation  [150].  The  fact  that  Li  and 
regular exercise appear to act on similar pathways raises the 
possibility that Li may mimic or perhaps amplify the effects 
of  exercise.  Although  this  is  still  an  evolving  concept,  a  re-
cent  study  has  shown  a  potential  benefit  of  the  combined 

therapies  in  combatting  neurodegeneration  associated  with 
high-fat  feeding.  In  this  study,  10-week  old  male  Sprague-
Dawley  rats  were  fed  a  high-fat  diet  (HFD)  for  8  weeks  to 
induce obesity and then treated with low-dose Li (10 mg/kg/ 
day)  alone,  exercise  alone,  or  Li  and  exercise  for  12  weeks 
[154]. Similar to Jung et al. [99], 12 weeks of Li treatment or 
endurance exercise significantly reduced body and fat mass, 
reinforcing the notion that low-dose Li may mimic this effect 
of  exercise  [154].  Moreover,  Li  or  exercise  significantly  in-
creased  the  expression  of  the  neuroprotective  factor  BDNF 
in  the  hippocampus  compared  to  chow-fed  and  HFD-fed 
controls, and together Li and exercise provided a synergistic 
effect, further increasing BDNF expression. However, cogni-
tive  tests  were  not  conducted,  and  as  such,  whether  this  ef-
fect  translated  to  improved  cognitive  function  remains  un-
known.  Therefore,  future  studies  should  examine  further 
whether low-dose Li can mimic and/or amplify the effects of 
regular exercise on cognitive function. 

5.3. Summary of the Effect of Li on Alzheimer’s Disease 

Due to the psychiatric uses of Li, there has been more re-
search  in  the  area  of  low-dose  Li  treatment  and  cognitive 
function compared to other areas. These findings have shown 
that  Li  treatment  is  capable  of  mitigating  AD  pathogenesis 
even at microdoses in animal models and preventing associ-
ated cognitive decline in human studies. This occurs mainly 
through  lithium’s  inhibitory  effects  on  GSK3β  activity  and 
associated  antioxidant  and  autophagic-enhancing  effects, 
which reduce the accumulation of NFT and Aβ plaques (Fig. 
4).  There  is  also  a  potential  for  combined  low-dose  Li  and 
exercise  therapy  to  improve  the  metabolic  dysregulation  as-
sociated  with  AD  pathology  and  pathogenesis  as  well  as 
providing  a  synergistic  neuroprotective  effect  on  cognitive 
function; however, this requires more investigation. 

6.  LOW-DOSE  LI,  INFLAMMAGING  AND  OXIDA-
TIVE STRESS 

In  all  of  the  age-related  diseases  that  we  have  reviewed 
so far, oxidative stress and inflammation have been involved 
in  disease  progression,  with  likely  contributions  to  etiology 
as  well.  Processes  involved  in  inflammation  and  oxidative 
stress  increase  with  age  as  our  bodies  lose  the  ability  to 
properly  reduce  levels  of  reactive  oxygen/nitrogen  species 
(RONS) and inflammatory mediators [155]. Li has long been 
known  to  exert  pleiotropic  effects,  including  lowering  in-
flammation  and  oxidative  stress  [133,  156,  157],  which  we 
hypothesize to promote cellular resilience against aging. 

6.1. Low-Dose Li and Inflammaging  

Inflammaging  is  a  state  of  chronic-low  grade  inflamma-
tion that is commonly found in aged individuals [158]. It is a 
form  of  sterile  inflammation  that  occurs  in  the  absence  of 
infection  and  can  cause  tissue  damage  and  degeneration, 
ultimately  worsening  the  outcomes  associated  with  CVD, 
sarcopenia,  osteoporosis,  T2DM,  T1D,  and  neurodegenera-
tive diseases, such as AD [158, 159]. The main inflammatory 
cytokines  detected  to  be  upregulated  with  aging  and  age-
related  diseases  include  interleukin-1beta  (IL-1β),  IL-6,  and 
tumour  necrosis  factor-alpha  (TNF-α)  [158,  159].  Inflam-
maging  can  be  sourced  from  adipocytes  and  the  increased 
adiposity associated with aging [160], as well as an increased 

902    Current Neuropharmacology, 2023, Vol. 21, No. 4 

Hamstra et al. 

presence of senescent cells. Cellular senescence is a process 
where cells cease dividing and undergo distinctive phenotyp-
ic  alterations  [161].  Namely,  senescent  cells  will  take  on  a 
senescence-associated  secretory  phenotype  (SASP),  where 
they  produce  and  secrete  inflammatory  cytokines  and  other 
mediators in an attempt to rid the tissue/organ of these non-
functional  cells  [162].  In  addition  to  replicative  senescence, 
non-replicative  senescence  can  also  be  detected  in  post-
mitotic cells in aged individuals as damage to DNA accumu-
lates  [163].  In  both  replicative  and  non-replicative  senes-
cence, the ability of the body to clear these cells in response 
to  the  SASP  and  heightened  basal  inflammation  becomes 
impaired as we age, ultimately contributing to the phenome-
non termed inflammaging.  

The  anti-inflammatory  effects  of  Li  occur  primarily 
through  its  inhibition  of  GSK3,  though  GSK3-independent 
effects may also play a role. Briefly, the inhibition of GSK3 
via  Li  represses  both  the  nuclear  factor  (NF)-κB  and  signal 
transducer  and  activator  of  transcription  (STAT)  pathways, 
ultimately lowering the expression of, and sensitivity to, in-
flammatory  cytokines  and  mediators,  including  IL-1β,  IL-6, 
TNF-α,  inducible  nitric  oxide  synthase  (iNOS),  prostaglan-
din  E2  and  cyclooxygenase-2.  In  addition  to  reducing  these 
pro-inflammatory  mediators,  others  have  shown  that  Li  can 
promote the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such 
as IL-10, in response to lipopolysaccharide [164]. Important-
ly,  most  studies  examining  the  anti-inflammatory  effects  of 
Li have typically used therapeutic or supra-therapeutic doses 
of Li, with only a few studies using low doses. In the study 
by  Wilson  et  al.,  using  the  NP03  microdose  Li  formulation 
(40 μg/kg) in the rat model of AD, the authors reported de-
creased hippocampal levels of IL-6 and chemokine CXCL1, 
which  is  transcriptionally  regulated  by  IL-6  [143].  CXCL1 
acts  as  a  chemoattractant  for  other  immune  cells,  such  as 
monocytes  and  neutrophils,  which  contribute  to  the  inflam-
matory response. The mechanism proposed to be responsible 
for this observed effect was through the inhibition of GSK3β 
with  Li  leading  to  the  inactivation  of  NF-ĸB  and  STAT3 
transcriptional activity [143]. In another recent study, micro-
dose Li treatment reduced cellular senescence and the SASP 
in human astrocytes [165]. Here, Viel et al. also demonstrat-
ed that microdose Li suppressed amyloid β-induced cellular 
senescence  in  astrocytes,  further  supporting  the  beneficial 
effect  of  low-dose  Li  on  AD  and  strengthening  the  Li-
sensitive  linkages  between  inflammation  and  AD.  In  all, 
low-dose  Li  has  a  strong  potential  to  attenuate  inflammag-
ing;  however,  this  needs  to  be  examined  further  in  future 
studies. 

6.2. Low-Dose Li and Oxidative Stress  

RONS are critical signalling molecules that regulate sev-
eral physiological functions, such as insulin synthesis, vascu-
lar  tone,  cell  proliferation,  differentiation,  and  migration 
[166]. However, in an uncontrolled state, these unpaired free 
radicals steal electrons from proteins, lipids and other mole-
cules, perpetuating a state of oxidative stress. It is well estab-
lished that oxidative stress contributes to the development of 
a number of diseases, particularly age-related diseases [166]; 
therefore,  attenuating  oxidative  stress  may  improve  upon 
many  physiological  outcomes  as  we  age.  In  patients  with 
bipolar disorder, Li treatment significantly reduces the levels 

of  plasma  lipid  peroxides  and  improves  antioxidant  status 
[157, 167]. Mechanistically, this can occur through the effect 
of  therapeutic  Li  on  improving  mitochondrial  function  in 
patients with bipolar disorder, leading to reductions in RONS 
production  and  oxidative  stress  [168,  169].  Moreover, 
through  its  inhibition  of  GSK3,  Li  can  also  exert  resilience 
against  RONS  by  increasing  the  production  of  anti-oxidant 
systems,  such  as  chaperone  proteins,  heme  oxgyenase-1 
(HO-1), glutathione, and the activity of glutathione transfer-
ase [124, 170-174].  

With respect to low-dose Li, our lab has shown that feed-
ing young male C57BL/6J mice with 10 mg/kg/day of Li for 
6  weeks  increased  protein  levels  of  heat  shock  protein  70 
(Hsp70) in cardiac tissue [33]. We presume that this was due 
to  the  inhibition  of  GSK3β,  which,  when  active,  negatively 
regulates  the  transcription  factor  heat  shock  factor-1  HSF-1 
responsible  for  the  transcription  of  Hsp70  [170].  Hsp70  is 
capable of binding to proteins and protecting their structures 
from  misfolding  or  from  cytotoxic  damage  induced  from 
RONS-mediated  post-translational  modifications  (i.e.,  S-
nitrosylation and T-nitration) [175]. The ability of Hsp70 to 
bind to and protect the SERCA pumps [176, 177] is of par-
ticular  interest,  as  this  could  protect  against  age-related  im-
pairments  in  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscle  contractility.  In 
addition  to  our  study,  others  have  shown  that  in  a  T1D 
mouse  model  induced  by  STZ  injection,  microdose  Li  pro-
tects  against  pancreatic  oxidative  stress  and  cell  death  by 
inhibiting  GSK3β  and  activating  nuclear  factor  erythroid  2-
related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated transcription of HO-1 [124]. 
In fact, it is through this GSK3/Nrf2 pathway [178] that Li is 
thought  to  promote  longevity  [10,  179],  which  we  contend 
adds further support to the notion that Li can provide cellular 
resilience against aging. In the study by Castillo-Quan et al., 
the  authors  tested  the  effects  of  Li  on  Drosophila  lifespan 
using  Li  concentrations  that  would  result  in  tissue  Li  levels 
below 0.5 mM. When treated with this low dose of Li, they 
observed a life-prolonging effect; however, when Li exceed-
ed this threshold, it became toxic and shortened the lifespan 
[178].  This  highlights  the  fact  that  Li  operates  under 
hormesis  and  that  its  physiological  benefits  may  be  elicited 
at  lower  concentrations;  however,  this  warrants  future  stud-
ies.  It  is  also  worth  considering  that  RONS  are  important 
signalling  molecules  that  also  act  under  hormesis,  where 
relatively  small  amounts  of  RONS  and  oxidative/nitrosative 
stress are in fact protective as they can ramp up physiologi-
cal defense systems [180-182]. One classical example of this 
is  in  ischemic  preconditioning,  whereby  brief  episodes  of 
ischemia  and  reperfusion  trigger  a  transient  rise  in  RONS 
that upregulate protective and adaptive mechanisms that pro-
tect  the  tissue  against  injury  from  a  subsequent  sustained 
ischemic  event  [183].  This  preconditioning  can  increase  the 
expression  of  protective  genes,  termed  vitagenes,  which  in-
clude various antioxidant systems such as those already dis-
cussed here (Hsp70 and glutathione) [180]. In the context of 
Li,  its  RONS  lowering  effect  may  mitigate  this  important 
protective  response  observed  with  preconditioning.  Howev-
er,  evidence  within  the  literature  suggests  otherwise,  where 
Li  treatment  appears  to  mimic  the  protective  effect  of  pre-
conditioning.  In  fact,  several  studies  (many  with  low  doses 
of Li) have shown that chronic Li treatment protects against 
ischemia-reperfusion damage in the brain, kidney, heart, and

Fig.  (5).  Anti-inflammatory  and  antioxidant  effects  of  low-dose  lithium.  Low-dose  Li  reduces  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen/nitrogen 
species (RONS) by promoting healthy mitochondrial function. Low-dose Li can also reduce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP)  in  astrocytes  and  increases  expression  of  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  IL-10  in  the  presence  of  inflammatory  stimuli.  By  inhibiting 
GSK3,  low-dose  Li  also  reduces  the  expression  of  pro-inflammatory  mediators  and  promotes  upregulation  of  antioxidant  systems,  further 
reducing levels of RONS damage. (A higher resolution/colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article). 

liver  [184-190].  Suggested  pathways  behind 
this  well-
established effect include the increased production of nitric ox-
ide  and  the  amplification  of  the  NrF2  pathway,  both  of  which 
are critical in the activation of the vitagene network [180, 182]. 

6.3.  Summary  of  the  Effects  of  Li  on  Inflammation  and 
Oxidative Stress 

Based on these mechanisms identified above, it is possi-
ble that low-dose Li treatment could promote an increase in 
cellular  resilience,  while  providing  anti-inflammatory  and 
antioxidant  protection  during  the  natural  process  of  aging 
(Fig. 5). Although some studies have shown these beneficial 
effects  in  the  brain,  pancreas,  and  cardiac  tissues  with  low-
dose  Li  treatment,  it  is  still  largely  unknown  if  low  or  sub-
therapeutic  doses  are  beneficial  in  all  tissue  types.  Whether 
or not these effects can prevent or mitigate the development 
of  chronic,  low-grade  inflammation  is  also  yet  to  be  deter-
mined.  This  line  of  questioning  is  still  very  novel  and  re-
quires  further  in-depth  investigation  in  various  tissue  types 
and biological models.  

CONCLUSION  

Modern medicine and technology have significantly pro-
longed  human  lifespan,  and  while  beneficial,  this  has  also 
equated  to  an  increase  in  the  prevalence  of  age-related  dis-
eases  and  disorders.  As  our  global  population  continues  to 
age, so do the rates of these disorders, highlighting the need 
for  a  shift  to  preventive  strategies  focused  on  enhancing 
healthspan,  i.e.,  the  proportion  of  our  lives  in  near-optimal 
health. In this review, we have highlighted the physiological 
benefits of low-dose Li and its potential ability to counteract 
various  age-related  disorders,  such  as  CVD,  sarcopenia,  os-
teoporosis,  AD,  obesity,  and  T2DM.  These  effects  of  Li, 
some of which seem to mimic or even amplify regular exer-
cise,  appear  to  be  mediated  through  both  GSK3-dependent 
and  GSK3-independent  pathways.  Importantly,  the  primary 

intention of our review was to highlight the potential benefits 
of low-dose Li that are perhaps underappreciated due to the 
stigma associated with high-dose Li therapy and Li toxicity. 
It  should  also  be  highlighted  that  the  studies  reviewed  here 
primarily  use  animal  models  or  show  correlational  data, 
identifying  a  possible  relationship  between  lithium  levels  in 
humans and potential health benefits. Though promising, we 
envision that this review could act as a call for future studies 
that  will  more  formally  investigate  the  potential  effects 
(good  or  bad)  of  low-dose  Li  on  human  health  throughout 
the lifespan. Future areas of research in human or preclinical 
models could test the effects of Li on aging, other age-related 
diseases,  the  influence  of  biological  sex,  and  the  impact  of 
combining  healthy  behaviours,  such  as  diet  and  exercise,  as 
we  move  toward  identifying  paths  to  optimizing  healthspan 
as we age.
