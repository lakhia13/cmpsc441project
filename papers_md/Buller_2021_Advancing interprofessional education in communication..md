Abstract

Objective.—The objective of this training project is to develop and host Interprofessional 
Communication courses to improve interdisciplinary communication in oncology care. The initial 
national course was held in a virtual format and included pre- and post-course participant data. 
The curriculum was developed with support from the National Cancer Institute.

Methods.—A virtual two-day course was held to equip nurses, social workers, and chaplains 
with vital communication skills in oncology practice, so that they could return to their home 
institutions and teach communication skills to other healthcare professionals, with the intention 
of making improved communication a quality improvement goal. Fifty-two participants were 
selected through an application process to attend the virtual course in two-person interprofessional 
teams (e.g., nurse and chaplain, or social worker and nurse). The Interprofessional Communication 
Curriculum was based on the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care’s eight 
domains of quality palliative care. The six online modules developed by the investigators were 
presented in lectures, supplemented by discussion groups, role plays, and other methods of 
experiential learning.

Results.—Pre- and post-course results identified areas of communication, which are a priority 
for improvement by oncology clinicians. Participant goals identified specific strategies to be 
implemented by participants in their settings.

Significance of results.—The need for communication training was clearly demonstrated 
across professions in this national training course. Participants were able to apply course content 
to their goals for quality improvement in cancer settings.

Introduction

Communication is recognized as a key component of quality cancer care. Patients and 
their families depend on clinicians’ skills in communicating the initial cancer diagnosis, 
the treatment options, subsequent changes in the patient’s condition, and transitions, 
until the time of death (Paice, 2019). In fact, studies have documented that effective 
communication by clinicians may help patients maintain a sense of control, provide 
assistance in determining goals of care, find meaning in their lives, maintain hope, and 
ask for and receive relief when experiencing pain or other cancer symptoms [National 
Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care, Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality 
Palliative Care (NCP Guidelines), 2018; Stajduhar and Dionne-Odom, 2019]. In addition, 
effectively communicated information may help patients and their families verbalize fears 
and emotions, make informed choices, and encourage patients to create advance healthcare 
directives.

The National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care (NCP) created guidelines 
for healthcare professionals to follow in providing care for patients with serious illness, 
including cancer (NCP Guidelines, 2018). The guidelines contain eight domains of care, and 
communication is recognized as intrinsic to each of the domains. Effective communication 
skills with patients, families, and other team members are essential to provide quality care.

The field of palliative care has made communication a key principle and priority because 
of the important role it plays in the delivery of quality care (Donesky et al., 2020). 
Communication training for all members of the interdisciplinary team (IDT) is recognized as 
a common goal of all healthcare providers (Donesky et al., 2020). For example, in the NCP 
Guidelines, Domain 2 pertains to physical care and states that the palliative care IDT works 
together to relieve suffering by reducing (a patient’s) physical symptoms of serious illness 
by effective communication, collaboration, and coordination of all team members involved 
in a patient’s care (NCP Guidelines, 2018). Communication is also cited in other domains, 
such as its importance in spiritual care, bereavement support, and at the end of life.

There has been extensive literature over previous years related to communication in serious 
illness care with most studies reporting deficiencies in communication skills by clinicians 
who have also received limited communication training (Dahlin and Wittenberg, 2019; 
Ferrell et al., 2019; Burgunder-Zdravkovski et al., 2020; Fliedner et al., 2021). Studies have 
documented the need for improved communication in areas such as discussing diagnosis 
or prognosis (Lamore et al, 2017; Riba et al., 2019; Burgunder-Zdravkovski et al., 2020), 
goals of care conversations, and conducting family meetings (Gentry, 2016; Singer et al., 
2016). Communication has been recognized as an essential skill across oncology disciplines 
(Glajchen et al., 2018; Head et al., 2019; Middleton et al., 2020), and the effectiveness 
of communication skill has been correlated with patient-reported outcomes including

satisfaction with care (Kavalieratos et al., 2016; Pfaff and Markaki, 2017). Numerous 
training programs have been evaluated, and communication skill training has evolved to 
include behavioral strategies and tools such as communication guides for use in clinical 
settings (Kurtz and Cooke, 2017; Burgunder-Zdravkovski et al., 2020).

Communication training has often focused on psychosocial aspects of care with less 
emphasis on spiritual concerns (Puchalski et al., 2014, 2020). Numerous studies have cited 
spiritual assessment and responding to spiritual distress as the areas clinicians feel least 
prepared for. Increasingly, clinical practice guidelines emphasize the importance of all team 
members increasing their competence in providing spiritual care, rather than seeing this 
aspect of care limited only to chaplains (NCP Guidelines, 2018; Riba et al., 2019).

In recognition of the importance of interprofessional communication skills and with the 
support of the National Cancer Institute, a curriculum was created to teach interprofessional 
healthcare teams important communication skills, with the intent of making effective 
communication a quality improvement measure in cancer care. The Interprofessional 
Communication Curriculum (ICC) Project is a national train-the-trainer communication 
training program for interprofessional oncology clinicians from multiple disciplines led 
by the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COH) and designed to enhance 
communication skills in oncology. The first ICC course was held virtually in January 2021.

The ICC course builds upon the investigators’ previous curriculum, the End-of-Life Nursing 
Education Consortium (ELNEC) — communication project. The ELNEC course was 
focused on nurses, but the investigators identified a need for an interdisciplinary training 
program given the nature of communication in serious illness requiring an interdisciplinary 
approach. The ICC curriculum was developed, and a pilot course was held that was open to 
all disciplines. Based on the pilot, the participants and investigators determined that a more 
focused approach was needed, and a decision was made to limit the ICC course to nurses, 
chaplains, and social workers and disciplines with shared communication learning needs and 
clinical experiences.

Methods

Course recruitment and application

Participants were selected in a competitive process and recruited from social work, nursing, 
and chaplaincy departments in cancer centers across the USA. Participants were required 
to apply in interprofessional dyads (e.g., nurse and chaplain; nurse and social worker; 
or chaplain and social worker). To qualify, participants were required to work in adult 
oncology settings only, as communication content and practices are distinct in pediatrics and 
would require a separate curriculum to address the needs of children across developmental 
stages and their parents’ needs. The course application collected demographic information 
on the applicants and their institutions. In addition, participants were asked to complete 
a pre-course assessment tool to rate the perceived effectiveness of their communication 
skills and their colleagues’ receptiveness to communication training. They were also asked 
to report their institution’s greatest challenges to improving communication. During the 
application process, each team developed three goals for institutional change highlighting

their plans for post-course training. In addition, a letter of support was required from their 
administrators for their participation in the course and the execution of their goals after the 
training.

Training course

The ICC was taught by lectures, discussion sessions, role plays, and other experiential 
learning organized by the eight domains of the NCP Guidelines. The domains include 
Structure and Processes of Care; Physical Aspects of Care; Psychological and Psychiatric 
Aspects of Care; Social Aspects of Care; Spiritual, Religious, and Existential Aspects of 
Care; Cultural Aspects of Care; Care of the Patient Nearing the End of Life; and Ethical 
and Legal Aspects of Care. The curriculum modules were made available to participants 
prior to the course in an online format, with the assistance of an online provider, Relias 
Learning. The three course objectives were to (1) identify the eight domains of quality 
palliative care applicable across all stages of cancer; (2) demonstrate skills in key clinical 
areas of communication through four lab sessions; and (3) develop goals for implementing 
communication skills training in practice through process improvement, staff education, and 
clinical care.

The course was designed as an in-person training, but due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, 
the instruction was converted into a virtual format. Figure 1 displays the virtual course 
agenda. The general framework for the course was to provide lectures by leaders in the 
three targeted disciplines (nursing, social work, and chaplaincy) to summarize the key 
evidence-based content and then to divide into small groups of approximately 15 people per 
group to apply the content in lab sessions. The lab sessions were intended as a time for 
networking, sharing experiences, using experiential learning such as role plays, and viewing 
video clips of communication scenarios, followed by discussion, self-assessment tools, and 
other methods to reinforce the content. Both lectures and lab sessions also included a focus 
on how to use the ICC materials to teach others, as each participant was expected to share 
the curriculum with colleagues in their home settings (Figure 2).

Fifty-two participants in interprofessional dyads (nurses, psychologists, and chaplains) 
attended the January 2021 ICC virtual course. Ninety-two percent (N = 48) of participants 
were female, 58% were nurses (N = 30), 33% social workers (N = 17), and 9% chaplains (N 
= 5). Twenty-seven percent (N = 7) worked in an NCI-designated cancer center and another 
27% (N = 7) worked in a hospital/oncology unit. (Table 1) The participants include a diverse 
group with 52% representing non-Caucasian ethnicities, which is valuable as the course also 
focused on cultural aspects of communication and the need to improve communication for 
underrepresented populations.

Participants completed pre-course assessment tools to rate how effective they were in 
communicating with patients at their institutions during key points in treatment: diagnosis, 
during treatment, survivorship, at recurrence, when facing the end of life, at time of death, 
and during bereavement (Table 2); and particularly, in relation to the eight NCP domains 
of care. Overall, using a scale of 1 = not effective to 5 = very effective, participants

rated their own effectiveness moderately high with items ranging from a mean of 3.0–3.8. 
Communication related to spirituality (Domain 5) and culture (Domain 6) were rated as least 
effective areas. Communication for patients at the end of life was rated as most effective.

Participants were also asked how effective they and their colleagues were in specific 
areas of communication (Table 3), and whether they would be receptive to communication 
improvement efforts. Participants reported “providing spiritual care” as their least frequent 
aspect of care, and they reported least effectiveness in communication at times of initial 
diagnosis, recurrence, and during bereavement (Table 3). Finally, they were queried about 
their institution’s greatest challenges to improving communication, and 69% (N = 36) 
reported the barrier of “Health professionals’ avoidance of talking about death.” When asked 
about specific barriers to communication improvement efforts, 63% (N = 33) of participants 
said lack of time, and 38% (N = 20) said cultural factors influencing care (Table 3).

Following the course, the participants rated the course’s effectiveness on a scale of 1 = 
lowest to 5 = highest. Participants rated the course on meeting their expectations and 
usefulness for their practice or professional development as 4.5 on the 5-point scale. When 
asked if the context was current and whether the instructional materials were suitable or 
useful, participants rated both items as 4.8, on a 1 = lowest to 5 = highest scale (Table 4).

During and after the course, participants were given the opportunity to revise their goals, as 
they often gained new ideas from the course sessions and from their interactions with other 
participants. The goals represent a range of activities with many addressing staff education, 
as well as specific areas of communication such as improving the processes of family 
meetings or advance care planning.

Follow-up evaluation will be conducted at 6 and 12 months for each cohort in which 
participants will report on their activities guided by the goals they established. Participants 
are also invited to engage in monthly webinars for 1 year following the course. The 1-h 
webinars are presented on different days and times to facilitate attendance by participants in 
various time zones. The time is divided between providing additional content on requested 
topics and having participants continue to share their experiences and network with others. 
Examples of scheduled webinars include communication when caring for patients in the 
LGBTQAI+ community and family meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Discussion

This NCI-supported training program addresses a key aspect of quality cancer care, the 
use of communication across all domains of care. The course is innovative in its focus 
on oncology and in bringing together three disciplines that are key members of oncology 
teams who provide essential communication to patients and families. In addition, the ICC 
course materials and the supplemental online learning modules provide a cost-effective 
approach to communication training for institutions with limited financial resources or in 
rural communities.
