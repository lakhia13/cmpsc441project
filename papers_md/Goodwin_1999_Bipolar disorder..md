that  bipolar  disorder  has  been  an  especially  important
and illustrative field of research in the evolution of psy-
chiatry. Consider the history of the discovery of lithium.
It is a classic example of an alert investigator with both
basic science and clinical interests seeing the potential of
an unexpected laboratory observation. Recent diagnostic
research, in which controversy abounds regarding under-
diagnosis  and  misdiagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder,  illus-
trates the richness of the clinical relevance of contempo-
rary  diagnostic  and  nosological  research.  Other  aspects
of current research that are relevant to diagnostic validity
include  genetic  and  outcome  research.  With  respect  to
treatment,  there  are  controversies  regarding  the  use  of
mood-stabilizing agents, and dilemmas in the use of anti-
depressant agents in bipolar disorder. In terms of theories
of  the  pathogenesis  of  bipolar  illness,  neurobiological
research  and  theories  have  advanced,  with  the  kindling
hypothesis in particular seeming useful as a general the-
ory of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. In addi-
tion,  integrative  research  that  includes  attention  to  the
psychosocial  aspects  of  bipolar  disorder  appears  on  the
verge of full development.

o approach the state of the art in diagnosis and
treatment of bipolar disorder requires a review of the cur-
rent state of both research and practice. There is no doubt

Bipolar disorder's unique combination of three characteristics—clear genetic diathesis, distinctive clinical
features, early availability of an effective treatment (lithium)—explains its special place in the history of
psychiatry and its contribution to the current explosive growth of neuroscience. This article looks at the
state of the art in bipolar disorder from the vantage point of: (i) genetics (possible linkages on chromo-
somes 18 and 21q, polygenic hypothesis, research into genetic markers); (ii) diagnosis (new focus on the
subjective aspects of bipolar disorder to offset the current trend of underdiagnosis due to overreliance on
standardized interviews and rating scales); (iii) outcome (increase in treatment-resistant forms signaling a
change in the natural history of bipolar disorder); (iv) pathophysiology (research into circadian biological
rhythms and the kindling hypothesis to explain recurrence); (v) treatment (emergence of the anticonvul-
sants, suggested role of chronic antidepressant treatment in the development of treatment resistance); (vi)
neurobiology (evaluation of regulatory function in relation to affective disturbances, role of postsynap-
tic second-messenger mechanisms, advances in functional neuroimaging); and (vii) psychosocial research
(shedding overly dualistic theories of the past to understand the mind and brain as an entity, thus empha-
sizing the importance of balancing the psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches). Future
progress in the understanding and treatment of bipolar disorder will rely on successful integration of the
biological and psychosocial lines of investigation.

Progress in scientific psychiatry:
the central role of bipolar disorders

Bipolar illness, among psychiatric conditions, has served a
central role in advancing clinical psychiatry, especially the
interaction of biological predisposition with environmental
stress. For one thing, there is a clear genetic diathesis for
bipolar illness. Also, there are six different clinical state
changes  that  can  be  studied:  two  states  (depression  and
mania), and four phase changes (from depression to mania,
from mania to depression, from depression to mixed states,
and from mixed states to depression). These multiple clinical
features of bipolar illness have served as a powerful research
tool. And, as noted, there is substantial new bearing on the
role of psychosocial factors in the emergence of episodes of
affective illness (eg, the kindling paradigm) and in its treat-
ment as well.
Despite the advances that have been made in research into
affective illness, such progress is not necessarily smooth and
rational. Unfortunately, there is also a tendency toward sci-
entific fads, or “make-believes” according to van Praag.1 It is
unfathomable why certain areas of literature simply drop out
as others capture our attention and take over. For example,
the relatively robust  literature  on electrolyte  disturbances
died out rather abruptly in the late 1960s  for no apparent
reason. Certainly, there was no rash of nonreplications to
explain the curious disappearance of this trail. Yet, research
into bipolar  disorder has nonetheless played  an important
role in hastening growth of psychiatric knowledge. The best
example may be lithium and its presence at the creation of
the psychopharmacological revolution. 

The psychopharmacological
revolution: lithium as a
case example

John Cade, an Australian physician, tested a hypothesis he
developed while interned in a Japanese POW camp during
the  Second  World  War:  he  hypothesized  that  mania  and
depression represented abnormalities of nitrogen metabo-
lism. To test the behavioral effects of urea, a nitrogenous
product in urine, in animals, he needed a soluble form of it;
he found that the lithium salt of urea was appropriately sol-
uble and when he gave it to guinea pigs,  he  found  that it
calmed them without sedation. While he assumed this was
due to the urea, he was careful enough to try a different form
of lithium just to be sure the calming effect was not due to
lithium. Of course, he discovered that the effect was due to

lithium. Realizing that the  existing treatments  for  mania
essentially put patients to sleep, he reasoned that lithium
might calm mania without knocking them out and so he tried
it in manic patients. While his early patients struggled with
lithium toxicity,  Cade had made a major discovery. Later,
Cade’s preliminary observations were replicated and con-
siderably extended in controlled studies by Schou and his
colleagues, and the rest is history.2
The story of lithium and mania provides a paradigm for a
process  that  was  repeated  with  the  introduction  of  neu-
roleptics for schizophrenia and tricyclic agents for depres-
sion in the 1950s and the 1960s. The psychopharmacolog-
ical  revolution,  which  took  shape  with  the  development
of those drugs, spawned three subrevolutions. First, there
was a conceptual revolution; the effectiveness of medica-
tions implied that biological factors were involved in these
illnesses and were indeed relevant to understanding them.
Second, a methodological revolution ensued; psychophar-
macological research required reliable diagnoses, and the
work  that  led  to  DSM-III  and  DSM-IV (Diagnostic  and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IIIrd and IVth edi-
tions)  stemmed  from  this  need.  Initially,  new  diagnostic
criteria  were  developed  among  the  neo-Kraepelinian
school  at  the  Washington  University  in  St  Louis  (Eli
Robins,  Samuel  Guze,  George Winokur),  which  laid  the
basis  for  the  Research  Diagnostic  Criteria  (RDC). After
nearly a decade of research on the basis of these criteria,
sufficient data had been obtained to support the wholesale
reform  of  psychiatric  diagnosis,  which  DSM-III  repre-
sented. The  publication  of  DSM-III  in  1980  marked  the
arrival  of  a  new  scientific  psychiatry;  all  this  had  origi-
nated  in  the  psychopharmacological  revolution.  Finally,
psychopharmacology played a substantial role in fueling
the explosive growth of neuroscience, since the introduc-
tion of new medications led to research into their mecha-
nisms  of  action. Thus,  the  understanding  of  central  ner-
vous system synaptic function grew largely from efforts to
understand  the  mechanism  of  action  of  tricyclic  antide-
pressants, neuroleptics, and lithium.

The state of the art: 
diagnostic validity

The  aim  of  sharper  diagnosis  remains  an  important  goal
for  research  in  bipolar  disorder  today.  Forty  years  ago,
Robins and Guze3 proposed that the diagnostic validity of
psychiatric disorders rested on the proposition that clinical
phenomenology should have a predictable relationship to

genetics, course, and treatment response. With respect to
bipolar disorder, what is the state of the art in each of these
areas? While  our  accumulated  knowledge  about  manic-
depressive illness in these four fields of research is indeed
impressive, we face a paradox. Despite all we know, bipo-
lar illness too often remains unrecognized or misdiagnosed,
and  inappropriately  or  ineffectively  treated.  Robins  and
Guze’s criteria can serve as springboards to comment on
the  contemporary  understanding  of  this  fascinating  and
challenging illness.

Clinical phenomenology

Clinical phenomenology is the framework that supports most
other research. Is manic depressive illness a valid syndrome?
Some4,5 doubt that we can distinguish it from schizophrenia.
However,  in  our  opinion, the Kraepelinian model appears
well supported by methodologically sound  research.6-8 To
further solidify the current model, future work should focus
on schizoaffective disorder and the validity of presumed
subtypes of bipolar disorder, such as pure vs mixed mania.
Future diagnostic validity studies should also seek to sharpen
the reliability of diagnostic criteria and clarify discrepancies
in prevalence estimates. There appears to be a “coarsening of
diagnosis”1 in clinical practice and research that may con-
fuse these issues. Particularly with respect to bipolar disorder,
the subtleties of the diagnostic process are often ignored in
the effort to avoid incorrectly labeling someone with the diag-
nosis. Thus, bipolar disorder tends to be underdiagnosed,
with even episodes of pure mania being completely missed
by clinicians (not to mention mixed mania, hypomania, or
bipolar depression). In a recent review of diagnostic patterns
in the community,9 we and our colleagues found that about
60% of the hospitalized patients we diagnosed with bipolar
disorder had received that diagnosis from previous psychia-
trists. While this may not simply be an issue of diagnostic
reliability, part of this diagnostic disagreement represents
clinician disagreement. Similar diagnostic difficulties exist in
the clinical interview of paranoid patients (thus making it
difficult to diagnose some types of schizophrenia, schizoaf-
fective disorder, psychotic depression, and borderline per-
sonality disorder). As Leston Havens has remarked,10 per-
haps diagnosis in psychiatry is in a stage similar to medicine
before the advent of auscultation. Sophisticated clinical inter-
views, such as those developed by Harry Stack Sullivan,11
Havens, and others, may be similar to auscultation, allowing
us to see and hear what we otherwise would miss. This level
of  subtlety  in  the  clinical  interview  is  often  difficult  to

achieve, much less standardize and teach for research pur-
poses. As van Praag again notes, “one can witness a stan-
dardized interview degenerating into a question-and-answer
game: answers being taken on face value, not caring for the
meaning behind the words, disregarding the as-yet-unspo-
ken and oblivious to the emotional content of the communi-
cation….There is the danger of the desk researcher studying
rating scale and standardized interview results rather than
actual patients. These may be data collected not by himself,
but by a research assistant with little psychiatric experience
and training.”1
These observations could explain some of the contradictory
results found with our current research tools. In nosology,
these  contradictory  results  are  most  relevant  to  the  Epi-
demiological Catchment Area (ECA) and National Comor-
bidity survey, which sought to assess psychiatric illness in
the general population of the US. The ECA study used the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) based on DSM-III,
administered by trained lay people. Despite reliability stud-
ies with clinicians before the study, clinician-administered
research interviews on the actual study population corre-
lated poorly with DIS-based diagnoses in one of the ECA
sites.12 As shown in Figure 1(next page), the best diagnostic
agreement, with alcoholism, was only mild (κ=0.35), and it
was worse with more diagnostically complex conditions like
schizophrenia, depression, and (especially)  mania. More
recently,  ECA-like  diagnostic  methods  were  used  in  the
National Comorbidity survey; even with similar methods,
the prevalence of mania was twice as high as in the ECA
study (1.6% vs 0.8%) and the prevalence of unipolar depres-
sion was much higher (17% vs 8%).13,14 On the other hand,
rediagnosis  of  a  subsample  in  that  study  by  clinician
researchers reported lower rates of nonaffective psychosis
diagnosis than those made by lay interviewers.15 These stud-
ies support the notion that such research techniques lead to a
“coarsening of diagnosis,” which makes for less reliable and
possibly less valid results.
We would also suggest that attention to subjective aspects of
psychiatric syndromes is important if diagnostic skills are to
improve. One of the reasons that subjective phenomena are
little studied is that they are deemed unmeasurable in a stan-
dardized way. But this is not the case. An excellent example
is insight, the phenomenon of awareness of illness, patho-
logical symptoms, or psychosocial sequelae of illness. This
subjective  phenomenon  has  recently  been  the  subject  of
sophisticated research, with the creation of multiple stan-
dardized rating instruments16-19 and a number of studies have
quantified the impairment of insight in psychotic and mood

disorders.20-25 Since patients with diminished insight deny the
presence of certain symptoms they actually possess, lack of
insight is  obviously one of those subjective  factors which
could affect accurate diagnostic assessment of mood and
psychotic disorders. 

Directions for genetic research

Turning to genetics, the ideal neurobiological  hypothesis
must explain two fundamental features of mood disorders:
genetic  vulnerability  and  episodic  recurrence.  In  recent
reviews of the genetic literature,26-28 there is a consensus that
findings regarding chromosomes 5, 11, and X are inconclu-
sive; however, there are possible linkages on chromosome
1829,30 and chromosome 21q.31,32 In spite of these intriguing
findings regarding possible single loci, most of the genetic
epidemiology studies suggest a polygenic disorder.
Of relevance to genetic research is the kindling paradigm,
which posits an analogy between the episodic nature of mood
disorders and the phenomena of kindling and sensitization.33

4 4

While a direct link between the physiological process of kin-
dling and clinical recurrence has not been definitively estab-
lished, the hypothesis possesses the advantage of encom-
passing key aspects of bipolar illness: the onset of early
episodes are preceded by major stress whereas later episodes
are not; the severity of untreated mood episodes worsens
over time; and the interval between episodes decreases over
time.34 Now  how  might  this  have  a  bearing  on  genetic
research? Compared to older animals, younger ones require
a lower level of electrical or chemical stimulation to initiate
and sustain limbic kindled seizures.35 Clinical genetic data
suggest 15% to 20% of children of a parent with bipolar dis-
order may develop the disorder.  It is possible that, in the
future, genetic markers with predictive validities near 80%
would allow testing of the efficacy of antikindling agents in
genetically  vulnerable  children  before  their  first  bipolar
episode. Once beyond the high-risk period, one might be
able to evaluate whether treatment could be withdrawn with-
out the illness having ever expressed itself. 

Outcome

Traditionally, the outcome of patients with bipolar disorder
has been reported to be intermediate between schizophrenia
and nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder. Recent
naturalistic outcome data from several research centers sug-
gest rather poor outcome in bipolar disorder, even when
treated.36-38 However, in evaluating the meaning of this, we
must recall that tertiary care research centers include a selec-
tion bias because they treat more severely ill patients. The old
adage in medicine that the longer a successful treatment is
available, the more difficult it becomes to show it still works,
certainly applies to lithium, where research in practice set-
tings continues to support its effectiveness.39 Even though
early intervention may improve long-term outcome, many
patients receive ineffective treatment for initial episodes,
allowing the psychological and perhaps biological “scars” of
episodes to linger, resulting in a more virulent illness.33 This
often involves early overuse of antidepressant agents, which
may function as “mood-destabilizing” agents in bipolar dis-
order, an important point to which we will return later.40
The fact remains that there are more treatment-resistant bipo-
lar patients today than there were two or three decades ago.
Clearly, for many, the illness has changed. But why? Some of
the relevant factors include the potentially destabilizing effect
of chronic antidepressant treatment, cultural factors like the
cocaine epidemic, and environmental factors like the increas-
ing impact of environmental stimuli associated with modern

society. Wehr and colleagues found that when rapid-cycling
bipolar patients were in a simulated environment without
artificial  light  (10-14  hours  of  darkness  daily),  cycling
improved; thus, civilization’s long “unnatural” photoperiod
(about 16 hours) may promote mood cycling.41 Changes in
dietary habits may also play a role. A striking negative cor-
relation between population rates of depression and fish con-
sumption in different countries has led to a trial of omega-3
fatty acids (rich in fish oil) in treatment-resistant bipolar
patients, with striking results.42,43 There are indications that in
Western countries, especially the US, fish consumption as a
proportion  of  our  diets  has  declined  over  the  past  few
decades, and that low omega-3 fatty acid levels are present in
patients with unipolar depression.44
The declining age of onset and worsening course of bipolar
disorder may also have, in part, a genetic explanation. Such
an epidemiologic pattern (“anticipation”) is known to occur
in a number of neurological disorders in which triplet repeat
sequences have been found to contribute to DNA instability.45

Circadian rhythms and kindling

Two lines of investigation that relate directly to the unique
clinical feature of recurrence in mood disorders also char-
acterize current research. The first holds that clinical recur-
rence involves abnormalities in biological rhythms, espe-
cially circadian cycles, an area pioneered by Wehr and his
colleagues.46 The  second  posits  an  analogy  between  the
episodic nature of mood disorders and electrical kindling,
with behavioral sensitization to mood episodes, a hypoth-
esis developed most extensively by Post and associates.47
Research on circadian rhythms suggests that abnormalities
involving the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypo-
thalamus  may  explain  many  of  the  clinical  features  of
recurrent mood disorders (including seasonality of episode
type),  perhaps  through  secondary  effects  on  neurotrans-
mitter  systems.  “Free-running”  rhythms,  cycles  that  are
not entrained to the 24-hour day/night cycle, may desyn-
chronize  other  circadian  rhythms,  adversely  affecting
mood.46 This hypothesis has recently been supported by an
animal model of a genetically fast biological clock in rats
missing  the  tau  gene,  with  behavioral  characteristics
roughly analogous to manic-depressive symptoms.48 Even-
tually,  genetic  approaches  will  sharpen  the  research  for
abnormal clocks by leading to an understanding of the pro-
teins synthesized under the direction of those genes.
The second hypothesis relevant to recurrence, as discussed
previously, is the kindling paradigm. As advanced by Robert

Post,49 this theory builds on the physiological finding that in
the  limbic  system,  intermittent  subthreshold  electrical  or
chemical stimuli produce increasingly strong neuronal depo-
larization; such depolarization can lead to an independent
permanent seizure focus, with possible behavioral effects
roughly analogous to mood disorders. Thus, kindling is a
process in which a highly regulated system, with multiple
feedback loops, shows an escalating response to a repetitive
stimulus, reaching a point where the stimulus is no longer
needed for the disturbance to continue. Post drew an anal-
ogy between this phenomenon of kindling in the nervous
system  and  the  clinical  observation  (originally  made  by
Kraepelin and confirmed in later more quantitative studies
by Post and others) that external stress appears to activate
early episodes of illness, but eventually the illness seems to
take on a life of its own, with later episodes often occurring
without  precipitating  stressors.  In  other  words,  both  kin-
dling and bipolar illness seemed to be processes of initial
activation giving way, over time, to a self-driven process. 
We  have  reviewed  the  clinical  psychiatric  literature  rele-
vant  to  assessing  some  of  the  predictions  of  the  kindling
hypothesis  in  detail  elsewhere.50 In  that  review,  we  noted
that the majority of the studies support the kindling hypoth-
esis, although with some caveats. Many were retrospective
and  limited  to  assessing  hospitalized  episodes  of  bipolar
disorder. Thus, their results may not apply to milder forms
of bipolar illness. In the prospective studies, nonhospitalized
mood episodes were assessed, but evidence in support of
kindling was not consistently attained. Some of this research
suggests that kindling phenomena may characterize a sub-
group of patients with bipolar disorder, perhaps with more
severe illness. A recent, yet to be published, study from the
National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  (NIMH)  Depression
Collaborative research program51 also found no evidence to
support kindling-like phenomena, and instead reported that
poor  outcome  was  associated  with  polyphasic  mood
episodes,  rather  than  monophasic  mood  episodes. Thus,
patients  whose  mood  episodes  cycle  directly  between
depression and mania had a worse outcome than those who
experience  a  single  episode  followed  by  a  period  of
euthymia. The investigators in the latter study suggest that
amount  of  time  ill  is  a  better  criterion  for  poor  outcome
than number of episodes and shortening of episode cycles,
as suggested by the kindling hypothesis. There are method-
ological limitations to the NIMH study, as well, however;
for instance, most patients were not in their early episodes
of  illness,  which  would  be  the  period  of  time  when  the
shortening  of  illness-free  intervals  between  episodes,  as

4 5

S t a t e   o f   t h e   a r t

predicted  by  the  kindling  model,  might  be  most  evident.
Thus, the clinical research on the kindling hypothesis may
be  interpreted  as  supportive  of  the  hypothesis,  albeit  in  a
limited and not yet definitive manner.

Patterns of mood-stabilizing treatment

Research  on  outcome  in  bipolar  disorder  has  led  to  an
interest  in  new  treatments  for  the  illness.  In  the  last
decade,  anticonvulsants  have  assumed  a  well-deserved
role  in  the  treatment  of  bipolar  disorder.  Initial  studies
focused  on  lithium-resistant  patients,  especially  rapid
cycling,  mixed  states,  and/or  concurrent  substance
abuse.  Recently,  some  authors  have  advocated  anticon-
vulsants as treatments of first choice. Caution is in order
here.  The  long  track  record  of  lithium  provides  a  firm
knowledge of risks and benefits. For example, lithium’s
impact  on  preventing  suicide  is  established.  A recent
review  of  28  studies  involving  over  150  suicides  indi-
cates a sixfold reduction in suicide with lithium treatment
of bipolar disorder compared to no treatment.52 The sero-
tonergic effects of lithium implicated in the neurobiology
of  suicide  may  help  explain  these  data.53 A recent  large
prospective 21/2-year randomized study comparing lithium
with carbamazepine found 9 suicide events in the carba-
mazepine group (5 deaths, 4 severe attempts) versus none
for  the  lithium  group  (P<0.02).54 Meanwhile,  a  1-year
multisite study of divalproex prophylaxis could not estab-
lish  a  significant  advantage  over  placebo.55 While  this
negative  finding  may  stem  from  inadequate  statistical
power since severely ill patients were excluded, nonethe-
less,  the  lack  of  a  robust  prophylactic  effect  in  those
patients studied suggests caution. In an earlier multisite
study comparing the acute antimanic effects of divalproex,
lithium, and placebo, those patients with a history of prior
response to lithium had a robust antimanic response to its
readminstration, but the divalproex response in this group
was only 27%. On the other hand, those with a prior his-
tory of nonresponse to lithium showed a relatively high
rate  of  response  to  the  anticonvulsant,  suggesting  that
there  may  be  two  substantially  separable  antimanic
response patterns. Since antimanic response may predict
prophylactic  efficacy,39,56-58 this  highlights  the  danger 
of  discontinuing  lithium  treatment  in  responders  to  it.
Also,  lithium  discontinuation  (especially  when  abrupt)
promotes rapid relapse.59,60 The possibility of lithium with-
drawal–induced  treatment  refractoriness  has  also  been
raised,61 though not settled.62

The antidepressant problem

Not surprisingly, patients with bipolar disorder often are
more aware of depression and its concomitant symptoms
than they are of mood elevation. Hence, even in the midst of
an episode of mood elevation, they may present requesting
antidepressant treatment and often refuse mood stabilizers.
Regardless of whether these patients are simply less con-
cerned  about  the  consequences  of  mood  elevation  or  are
relatively insensitive in perceiving it, the demand for anti-
depressant treatment presents a clinical dilemma. Consider-
able evidence suggests a relationship between chronic anti-
treatment,  especially  without  concurrent
depressant 
mood-stabilizing treatment, and development of treatment
resistance. Goodwin and Jamison have reviewed this matter
and marshaled much of the relevant data.34 Briefly, in three
double-blind  outcome  studies,  the  rate  of  manic  episodes
in  patients  with  bipolar  disorder  treated  with  antidepres-
sants and lithium is roughly twice the rate of those treated
with lithium alone.56,63,64 In two studies of patients with rapid-
cycling, antidepressants were thought to be the likely causes
of rapid-cycling in 26% to 35% of cases (n=85).65,66 Using
mood  charting,  Wehr  and  Goodwin67 also  documented
increased frequency of affective cycles in patients treated
with  desipramine  (and  lithium)  instead  of  lithium  alone.
The risks of antidepressant use documented in these studies
are summarized in Table I.
The  absence  of  systematic  or  objective  measures  for
cycling may account for the general underrecognition of
these  phenomena.  Simple  reliance  on  the  patient's  sub-
jective self-report often is insufficient. The limitations of
self-report can be decreased by systematically collecting
information  from  other  sources,  such  as  mood  charting
and family reports. In a recent examination of diagnosis
and treatment practices,9 we found that one third of bipo-
lar  patients  admitted  to  the  hospital  were  taking  antide-
pressant agents, whereas all but 4% were able to be dis-
charged  in  1  to  2  weeks  without  them  (even  50%  of
acutely  depressed  bipolar  patients  improved  at  least
mildly  without  antidepressant  agents).  It  seems  that  the
clinical  importance  of  minimizing  acute  antidepressant

treatment  and  emphasizing  aggressive  mood-stabilizing
prophylaxis  has  yet  to  be  fully  appreciated  in  clinical
practice.  If  antidepressants  are  used,  bupropion68 or
paroxetine69 may be the least risky since they are the only
two new antidepressants that have been shown, in double-
blind randomized studies of add-on therapy with lithium,
to have a lower risk of precipitating mania than tricyclic
antidepressants. Nonetheless, all antidepressants appear to
have longer-term risks of promoting rapid cycling.

Neurobiological research in bipolar
disorders: the state of the art

Clinical psychopharmacology is, of course, dependent on
advances in neurobiology. Here, an evolution has occurred.
Early studies from the 1960s and 1970s were influential in
developing neurobiological hypotheses based on function-
ing of central nervous system (CNS) monoamine systems,
as suggested by the efficacy of antidepressant and mood-sta-
bilizing agents and then testing those hypotheses through
innovative  approaches  to  the  direct  assessment  of  amine
metabolism in patients. These studies emphasized possible
excess or deficiency states of monoamines such as norepi-
nephrine, dopamine, or serotonin.70,71 Later work centered on
interactions among monoamine systems, indicating that even
“selective” new-generation psychotropic agents have multiple
effects within the brain based on extensive neuronal inter-
connectivity  among  monoaminergic  tracts  within  limbic
regions. Starting in the 1970s, a number of investigators
began to emphasize the importance of moving beyond excess
or deficiency states to an understanding of regulatory sys-
tems.72,73 More recently, the evaluation of regulatory function
in relation to affective disturbances has been accelerated by
rapid progress in the delineation of specific neuronal tracts
and their interconnections, especially as modeled by neural
network paradigms.74,75
Another line of advance in the neurobiological investiga-
tion of bipolar disorder has been the evolution from synaptic
neurotransmitter–based hypotheses as discussed above to
postsynaptic second messenger-based hypotheses. Manji76
has suggested a central role for G-proteins in the mecha-
nism of action of lithium, a role which may be more impor-
tant pathophysiologically than lithium’s synaptic effects. If
this is true, similar second messenger postsynaptic mecha-
nisms may remain to be discovered as possibly underlying
sources of action of other mood-stabilizing agents, such as
valproate and carbamazepine, as well as some antidepres-
sants. Particularly relevant to bipolar disorder, second mes-

senger mechanisms may explain the unique mood-stabilizing
effects of lithium and other agents that produce psychomotor
activation and mood elevation in the depressed state, reduce
them  in  the  manic  state,  and  have  little  effect  on  the
euthymic  state.  For  instance,  Berridge  and  colleagues77
hypothesized that lithium selectively inhibits the second
messenger phosphatidylinositol in  neuronal pathways that
are overactive; this would suppress an excessively excited
system, but exert no effect on a normally functioning path-
way. Such second messenger systems generally are linked
initially to G-proteins that translate synaptic neurotransmis-
sion into intracellular changes, such as with phosphatidyli-
nositol. Medications developed on the  basis of  these spe-
cific effects on different G-proteins are in process of early
clinical evaluation and may prove to be more pharmacolog-
ically specific in bipolar disorder than current treatments.
In this regard, the recent preliminary finding that high doses
of omega-3 fatty acids may have mood-stabilizing properties
in bipolar disorder is of considerable interest, given the role
of these essential fatty acids in postsynaptic signal trans-
duction.78 Further work on postsynaptic mechanisms has
involved other aspects of cellular communication linked to
G-protein function, particularly the activity of the enzyme
protein kinase C. We have summarized much of this research
in Table II (see next page). 
Eventually, understanding of such intracellular mechanisms
may lead to explication of alterations in gene expression that
may be involved in the pathogenesis or treatment of mood
disorder. 
Advances in neuroimaging represent another exciting area
of progress in neurobiological research. Mood disorders still
lag behind schizophrenia in being a focus of such work, and
future neuroimaging research should focus more on the need
for such data in mood disorders. As Meltzer79 has noted, much
of the available neuroimaging research on mood disorders
has not demonstrated clear differences from findings in schiz-
ophrenia, which some have taken to support the unitary psy-
chosis diagnostic model. However, the relative paucity of
work in mood disorders raises the likelihood of type II error
in the interpretation of available small data sets due to lack of
statistical power to find existent differences. Functional neu-
roimaging in particular may demonstrate more subtle patho-
physiological differences that may have eluded structural
brain imaging such as computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging. Again, the importance of state vs trait
differences needs to be reemphasized, since it is more rele-
vant to recurrent conditions such as mood disorders than to
chronic conditions such as schizophrenia.

G-proteins

(cid:3)  Stimulatory G-protein levels may be elevated compared to

controls in patients with bipolar disorder; whether these differ-

ences are state- or trait-dependent is unclear

(cid:3)  Lithium may decrease activity of certain pathways by 

inhibiting certain stimulatory G-proteins (Gs)

(cid:3)  Lithium may increase activity of certain pathways by 

inhibiting certain inhibitory G-proteins (Gi)

Other second messengers

(cid:3)  Phosphatidylinositol (PI): lithium or valproate reduces 

PI activity and depletes intracellular inositol

(cid:3)  Protein kinase C (PKC): chronic lithium or valproate 

use impairs PKC activity and reduces PKC levels

(cid:3)  Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS):

chronic lithium use impairs MARCKS activity

(cid:3)  Intracellular calcium: increased intraneuronal levels in

patients with bipolar disorder. Reduction by calcium channel

blockers may produce antimanic efficacy. Augmentation by

lithium may produce antidepressant efficacy

Genetic expression

(cid:3)  Lithium augments expression of certain parts of the c-fos

gene, mediated mainly by PI and PKC

Integrating biological and psychosocial
aspects of bipolar disorder

While  research  in  neurobiology  is  central  to  understand-
ing bipolar disorder, psychosocial research is also vital. In
the future, we hope that theories regarding mood disorders
suffer less from the reductionistic effects of Cartesian dual-
ism  than  in  the  past.  Given  the  emerging  realization  that
mind and brain are not different entities belonging to dif-
ferent  realms  of  experience,  the  distinction  between  the
biological  and  the  psychosocial  aspects  of  illness  begins
to break down. Advances in biological research itself sup-
port this approach. New developments in neuroscience are
beginning to show that even subtle changes in the environ-

ment  (especially  early  in  life)  can  result  in  long-lasting
changes  in  the  brain. These  advances  are  based  on  new
insights into the plasticity of the CNS, with elegant demon-
strations of often-specific environmental influences on spe-
cific neurobiological processes, including gene expression.
Thus, for example, in the study of stress effects, the field
has moved rapidly beyond immediate, often sort-term bio-
logical responses (eg, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
activation) to demonstrations of environmental manipula-
tions  producing  long-lasting,  even  permanent  changes.
These changes have been shown to operate through recep-
tor-coupled intracellular signal transduction pathways reg-
ulating  gene  expression  that,  in  turn,  alters  the  synthesis
of specific proteins and cell components. Kandel80 has sug-
gested that a mechanism of action for psychotherapy may
involve these kinds of alterations in synaptic structure and
function. If this is true, then medication treatment and psy-
chotherapy may be acting through a similar final common
pathway—the brain. This view is supported by recent work
in obsessive-compulsive disorder, where behavior therapy
was  shown  to  produce  similar  changes  in  positron  emis-
sion  tomography  neuroimaging  as  did  medication  treat-
ment, leading Baer81 to suggest that behavior therapy may
be a form of “endogenous serotonin therapy.” More work
will  be  needed  in  this  fruitful  field  of  translating  psy-
chotherapeutic treatment into alterations in brain structure
and function.
Once the brain is understood to be a final common pathway
for both medication and psychotherapeutic treatments, then
the  importance  of  balancing  biological  and  psychosocial
approaches becomes more understandable. The brain medi-
ates both treatment approaches. It may be, then, that a mood
disorder  may  have  a  largely  biological  origin,  and  yet  be
responsive to psychotherapy. Conversely, a mood disorder
may be largely psychosocial in origin, and yet respond to
medication treatment. It is an elementary error of logic to
reason from conclusion to premises; one must always work
the other way around. While the etiology of a certain con-
dition may be psychological, its pathogenesis may be bio-
logical and hence amenable to biological interventions (and,
at least theoretically, vice versa). Hence, while the efficacy
of  pharmacological  or  psychotherapeutic  treatments  may
give us clues about where we need to look in the search for
the etiologies of mood disorders, in themselves the fact that
these treatments work does not establish any specific etiol-
ogy. Advances in neurobiology, in particular, should com-
plement, rather than curtail, psychosocial research and psy-
chotherapeutic practice.

Bipolar disorder - Goodwin & Ghaemi

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 1- No. 1

This perspective is supported by some recent psychosocial
research in bipolar disorder. Since many outcome studies
have found marked impairment in social and occupation-
al functioning in bipolar disorder despite some sympto-
matic improvement pharmacologically, one might con-
clude that psychotherapeutic interventions are able to
improve social and occupational functioning. Recent data
support  this  hypothesis,  which  experienced  clinicians
already know: combined psychosocial/pharmacological
strategies are more effective than medication alone, espe-

cially in improving function, reducing relapse, and pre-
venting hospitalization. 82,83

Conclusions

The state of the art in the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar
disorder is both heartening and challenging. We have come
a long way and appear to be headed in the right direction.
However, we face a number of challenges, which, with effort
and foresight, we should be able to meet. First, we need to

Trastorno bipolar
La singular combinación de tres características en los
trastornos bipolares - clara diátesis genética, caracterís-
ticas  clínicas  distintivas  y  la  rápida  disponibilidad  de
un tratamiento eficaz (el litio) - explica el lugar especial
que  ocupan  en  la  historia  de  la  psiquiatría  y  su  con-
tribución al crecimiento explosivo de las neurociencias.
El presente artículo aborda las mejores perspectivas en
el  trastorno  bipolar  desde  diferentes  ángulos: 1)
genético (enlaces posibles en los cromosomas 18 y 21q,
hipótesis poligénica, investigaciones sobre marcadores
biológicos); 2)  diagnóstico  (nuevo  enfoque  sobre  los
aspectos subjetivos del trastorno bipolar para compen-
sar la tendencia actual a subdiagnosticarlo debido a un
exceso de confianza en las entrevistas estandardizadas
y las escalas de evaluación); 3) resultados (aumento de
las  formas  resistentes  al  tratamiento  lo  que  indica  un
cambio en la historia natural del trastorno bipolar); 4)
patofisiología (investigación del papel de los ciclos cir-
cadianos biológicos y de las hipótesis que explican las
recurrencias); 5) tratamiento (aparición de los anticon-
vulsivos, papel supuesto del tratamiento antidepresivo
de larga duración en el desarrollo de una resistencia al
tratamiento); 6) neurobiología (evaluación de la  fun-
ción  reguladora  en  los  trastronos  afectivos, papel  del
mecanismo del segundo mensajero, avances en las neu-
roimágenes  funcionales); por  último, 7)  investigación
psicosocial  (revisión  de  las  antiguas  teorías  dualistas
para comprender la mente y el cerebro como entidad
enfatizando, así, la  importancia  del  enfoque  equili-
brado: psicofarmacológico  y  psicoterapéutico). El
progreso futuro en la comprensión y el tratamiento del
trastorno bipolar se apoyará en la exitosa integración
de los ejes de investigación biológico y psicosocial.

Trouble bipolaire
L’association unique des trois caractéristiques du trou-
ble  bipolaire  -  terrain  génétique  manifeste, signes  cli-
niques  typiques, découverte  précoce  d’un  traitement
efficace (lithium) - explique la place particulière qu’il
tient au sein de l’histoire de la psychiatrie et sa contri-
bution  à  la  croissance  explosive  actuelle  des  neuro-
sciences. Cet  article  donne  un  aperçu  de  l’état  de  nos
connaissances  sur  le  trouble  bipolaire  à  partir  des
points de vue : 1) de la génétique (liaisons possibles sur
les  chromosomes  18  et  21q, hypothèses  polygéniques,
recherche  de  marqueurs  génétiques); 2)  du  diagnostic
(éclairage nouveau sur les aspects subjectifs du trouble
bipolaire pour compenser la tendance actuelle à sous-
diagnostiquer  due  à  une  confiance  excessive  dans  les
entretiens  standardisés  et  les  échelles  d’évaluation; 3)
du  devenir  (augmentation  des  formes  résistantes  au
traitement témoignant d'un changement dans l’histoire
naturelle du trouble bipolaire); 4) de la physiopatholo-
gie (recherche sur les rythmes biologiques circadiens et
l’hypothèse  d’embrasement  pour  expliquer 
les
rechutes); 5) du traitement (émergence des anticonvul-
sivants, suggestion d’un rôle joué par le traitement anti-
dépresseur chronique dans le développement des résis-
tances  au 
la  neurobiologie
(évaluation de la fonction de régulation en relation avec
des troubles affectifs, rôle des méca-nismes de seconds
messagers post-synaptiques, progrès en neuro-imagerie
fonctionnelle); et 7) de la recherche sociopsychologique
(s’éloigner  des  théories  du  passé  trop  dualistes  pour
comprendre  l’esprit  et  le  cerveau  en  tant  qu’une  seule
entité, soulignant ainsi l’importance de l’équilibre entre
les  approches  psychopharmacologiques  et  psy-
chothérapeutiques). Les progrès ultérieurs dans la com-

dront  de  l’intégration  réussie  des  voies  d’investigation
biologiques et sociopsychologiques.

avoid an historical tendency in psychiatry towards reduc-
tionism, which led to a swing away from biological work for
much  of  this  century.  Yet,  as  much  as  nonbiological
approaches, biological psychiatry carries a risk of going too
far  with  untested  assumptions.  We  must  promote  further
progress in the burgeoning field of neurobiological research
and inform it clinically with an understanding of important
features of psychiatric illnesses such as recurrence and genetic

susceptibility.  We  should  recall  the  two-way  interaction
between clinical research and laboratory investigation, with-
out  ignoring  either  side  of  this  important  paradigm  for
progress. And we need to integrate biological and psychoso-
cial lines of investigation much better than in the past. Ulti-
mately, these efforts all pay off at the clinic and at the bedside,
where we may assist individuals suffering from bipolar illness
to recover and return to their lives free of its ravages. ❏
