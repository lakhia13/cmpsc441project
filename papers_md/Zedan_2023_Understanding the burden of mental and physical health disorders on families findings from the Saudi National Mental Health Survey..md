ABSTRACT
Objective  To assess prevalence and correlation of factors 
of family burden associated with mental and physical 
disorders in the general population of Saudi Arabia.
Setting and participants  A secondary analysis of data 
from the Saudi National Mental Health Survey (SNMHS).
Outcome measures  Mental and physical health disorders 
of first- degree relatives and objective (time, financial) and 
subjective (distress, embarrassment) family burden.
Results  We found significant caregiver burden for family 
members with mental health disorders. Around one- third 
of the sample was providing care for a family member 
with a health issue. Within this group, 40% had a mental 
health diagnosis. 73% of the study population reported 
experiencing some form of burden as a result of the care 
they are obligated to provide for their family members. We 
found the highest burden on male caregivers, in providing 
care for family members with serious memory disorders, 
mental retardation, schizophrenia or psychosis, followed 
by, alcohol and drug disorders, anxiety, depression or 
manic depression.
Conclusion  Our findings for family burden were 
statistically significant, indicating potential negative impact 
on caregiver coping ability with the demands of caring 
for family members with health issues. A comprehensive 
review of national mental health policies is required to 
integrate aspects of community mental health promotion, 
scale- up prevention, screening interventions and social 
support to protect against the difficulties of mental illness 
and reduce the burden on caregivers, the family, society, 
health system and the economy.

INTRODUCTION
Caring  for  a  family  member  with  a  health 
disorder can have significant negative impact 
on  caregiver  quality- of- life.1–3  Internation-
ally,  the  prevalence  of  mental  disorders  is 
increasing,  becoming  the  second  leading 
cause  for  disability  in  individuals,  thereby 
posing  a  major  public  health  concern.1–4 
A  person  with  a  mental  disorder  requires 
considerable  social  support  and  caregiving, 
which  is  usually  provided  by  family,  and  can 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ The  subset  of  the  Saudi  National  Mental  Health 
Survey (SNMHS) national data used in this study is 
well- placed to provide strong socio- epidemiological 
evidence  estimating  the  family  burden  of  mental 
and physical disorders in Saudi Arabia.

 ⇒ The  SNMHS  methodology,  methods  and  study  in-
struments,  derived  from  the  World  Mental  Health 
survey initiative, have been translated and validated 
for  use  in  the  Saudi  population,  and  clinically  ap-
praised  for  robustness  and  accuracy  of  diagnostic 
criteria.

 ⇒ It was not within the scope of this study to explore 
the  impact  of  complex  care  dynamics  such  as 
shared burden of care between family members in 
the same household.

 ⇒ The current study did not explore environmental is-
sues such as access to transportation or healthcare 
services, or other aspects such as caregiver quality 
of life and physical health.

considerably  impact  their  prognosis  and 
recovery.2–5 There has been increasing atten-
tion on the progressive deinstitutionalisation 
of  mental  health  services  and  the  resulting 
impact on informal caregivers; as the greater 
the  intensity  of  the  mental  disorder,  the 
higher the associated levels of family burden 
such  as  distress,  embarrassment,  stigma  and 
time  and  money  spent  on  informal  care-
giving.1 5–7

In terms of global efforts, the WHO World 
Mental  Health  (WMH)  survey  initiative  has 
carried  out  large- scale  psychiatric  epidemio-
logical  surveys  of  common  mental  disorders 
in  countries  worldwide,  using  standardised 
methods  to  provide  data  on  prevalence, 
burden  and  treatment  of  mental  disorders 
to  support  evaluation  and  planning  for 
mental  health  policies.4  7–9  A  study  by  Viana 
et al found health disorders posed significant

burden on caregivers by way of financial burden, psycho-
logical distress, emotional distress or embarrassment and 
time  strains.1  Viana  et  al  also  found  gender  differences 
in  the  burden  of  care,  with  a  higher  burden  on  female 
caregivers, and an increased burden of care for parents, 
spouses  and  children.1  Shahly  et  al  studied  older  care-
givers  and  found  40%  had  relatives  with  serious  health 
conditions, which was linked to significant time, financial 
costs and emotional burden, particularly among women 
caring for spouses and children.10 Souza et al also studied 
caregivers  in  Brazil  and  found  significant  burdens  on 
older female caregivers.11

In  Saudi  Arabia,  there  is  limited  research  on  the 
burdens  of  informal  caregiving.  Mutair  et  al12  reported 
on  cultural  context  and  the  importance  families  place 
on providing care for their own as part of their religious 
obligations and duties.12 AlZahrani et al found providing 
care  for  a  family  member  with  a  mental  disorder  was  a 
source of disruption of everyday life routines, dissatisfac-
tion,  tension  and  worry.  These  issues  were  more  preva-
lent among caregivers who were <30 years old, living with 
spouses or children and for smaller- size families, or those 
who spent extended amounts of time providing care.6

AlFakhri et al found family caregivers of patients with 
dementia  faced  considerable  burden,  reduced  quality 
of  life  and  a  risk  of  developing  clinical  depression.13 
Al- shareef et al found 69% of caregivers had depression 
due  to  care  burdens  for  family  members  with  mental 
disorders, and an increased risk for caregivers older in 
age,  female,  providing  care  for  spouses  or  caregiving 
over 4 hours per day.14 Sharif et al found that caregivers’ 
provision of consistent spiritual, emotional and psycho-
logical  support  caused  stress.  Caregivers  also  had  diffi-
culty  maintaining  employment  for  themselves  due  to 
their commitment to their family member with a mental 
disorder  and  struggled  with  the  associated  stigma.15 
Alabdulaziz and Cruz found healthcare providers strug-
gled to incorporate family dynamics into the care setting 
despite  their  understanding  and  appreciation  of  its 
cultural  and  religious  relevance  in  the  country.16  Most 
recently, Alshammari et al has found increased caregiver 
burdens on women of older age.17 These previous family 
burden studies were all based on relatively small samples 
from singular cities or particular healthcare facilities in 
Saudi  Arabia,  and  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there 
are no published national estimates of family burden in 
Saudi Arabia yet.

The  Saudi  National  Mental  Health  Survey  (SNMHS), 
part  of  the  WMH  survey  initiative,  is  the  first  national 
cross- sectional  community- based,  epidemiological  study 
examining  the  prevalence  and  correlates  of  common 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders, 
fourth edition (DSM- IV) mental disorders in a represen-
tative sample of the Saudi population.18 19 The data from 
the SNMHS are well- placed to verify and provide strong 
socio- epidemiological  evidence  to  support  the  purposes 
of this study and estimate the burden of mental and phys-
ical disorders on family caregivers in Saudi Arabia.6 14 15

The aim of this study was to answer the following ques-
tion:  What  are  the  burdens  families  face  when  dealing 
with  family  members  with  physical  and  mental  health 
issues?  Findings  from  this  study  will  provide  significant 
information  to  policymakers  and  stakeholders  working 
on improving the quality of life of family caregivers. This 
is  also  in  alignment  with  the  goals  of  the  Saudi  health 
transformation  programme  and  the  ambitious  Vision 
2030.20 21

METHODS
Sample
As  detailed  in  previous  publications,  the  SNMHS  is  a 
mental health assessment survey carried out in a nation-
in  Saudi 
ally  representative  sample  of  households 
Arabia.18 19 22–27 The study was based on a stratified multi-
stage  clustered  area  probability  sample  of  4302  Saudi 
households  in  11  administrative  regions  of  the  country. 
The  survey  was  administered  face- to- face  to  randomly 
selected Saudi citizens (aged 15–65 years) in their homes. 
A  total  of  4004  interviews  were  completed  during  the 
period from 2014 to 2016, with pauses for the holy month 
of Ramadan and the summer (due to high temperatures), 
and were carried out by trained lay interviewers. Most of 
the interviewers were hired locally from each region and 
were supervised by a group of team leaders. At no point in 
time were there >30 interviewers active in the field.

The  SNMHS  used  a  two‐part  case- control  sampling 
design  to  reduce  the  interview  burden  on  respondents 
who did not meet criteria for any of the core mental disor-
ders assessed in the survey. Part I assessed core disorders 
and Part II assessed disorders of secondary interest and a 
wide range of correlates. The Part I sample was weighted 
to adjust for differential probabilities of selection within 
and  between  households  and  to  match  sample  distribu-
tions  to  population  distributions  on  the  cross‐classifica-
tion of key sociodemographic and geographic data. The 
Part  II  sample  was  then  additionally  weighted  for  the 
undersampling of Part I respondents without core disor-
ders, which led the prevalence estimates of core disorders 
in the weighted Part II sample to be identical to those in 
the Part I sample. More details regarding sample design 
and field procedures are described elsewhere.18 23

In  line  with  our  aim  for  this  study,  the  weighted  Part 
II  sample  (n=1853)  and  an  extracted  sample  of  605 
respondents who had family members with health issues 
was  used.  The  survey  had  an  estimated  individual- level 
response rate of 61%. The response rate was comparable 
to other WMH surveys in high‐income countries (eg, 60% 
in Australia and 57.8% in Germany).28

Measures
Instrument
The original SNMHS studies used the WHO Composite 
International  Diagnostic  Interview  (CIDI)  3.0,  a  fully 
structured  interview  designed  to  be  lay  administered, 
and generate estimates related to prevalence of common 

Zedan HS, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e072115. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072115DSM- IV mental disorders.7 18 The version of the CIDI that 
was  used  to  conduct  the  SNMHS  interviews  was  based 
on  those  described  in  the  study  by  Shahab  et  al,  trans-
lated and validated for use in the Saudi population, and 
training was provided for the lay interviewers to conduct 
them face- to- face according to strict fieldwork protocols 
and procedures to ensure data quality.22 23 Clinical reap-
praisal of the CIDI instrument was recently conducted to 
determine  the  extent  of  the  accuracy  of  the  diagnostic 
classifications as described in the study by Kessler et al.24

Mental health disorders
Twelve- month disorders assessed by the CIDI instrument 
criteria  include  the  following:  anxiety  disorders  (panic 
disorder,  generalised  anxiety  disorder,  agoraphobia 
without  panic  disorder,  social  phobia,  post- traumatic 
stress disorder, obsessive- compulsive disorder, separation 
anxiety  disorder),  mood  disorders  (major  depressive 
disorder, bipolar disorder I or II), impulse control disor-
ders  (conduct  disorder,  attention  deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder, intermittent explosive disorder), substance use 
disorders  (alcohol  and  drug  abuse  and  dependence) 
and  eating  disorders  (anorexia,  binge  eating  disorder, 
bulimia).

Family burden
Family burden as one section of Part II of the CIDI was 
defined as burden that respondents experienced in their 
roles as caregivers of relatives of the first- degree (parents, 
siblings,  spouses  or  children)  living  with  them  who  had 
health issues. Burden was defined as both subjective (eg, 
psychological  distress,  embarrassment)  and  objective 
(eg,  time,  money,  informal  care- giving  such  as  keeping 
them  company,  washing,  dressing  or  eating,  managing 
requirements such as paperwork, housework, transporta-
tion  or  medical  visits,  adhering  to  medication  regimens 
or providing emotional support) to a family member or 
relative  in  the  same  household.1  In  this  section  of  the 
CIDI, respondents were asked to rate on a scale how their 
family  members’  health  issues  impacted  them  in  terms 
of their time, energy, emotions, finances and their ability 
to  pursue  personal  daily  activities,  and  to  estimate  the 
resulting amount of time and monthly expenditure dedi-
cated to providing care. The respondents answered ques-
tions on family burden as related to health issues (cancer, 
serious  heart  disorders,  permanent  physical  disability 
such as blindness or paralysis or any other serious chronic 
physical disorder) and mental disorders (serious memory 
disorders  like  senility  or  dementia,  mental  retardation, 
alcohol  or  drug  disorders,  depression,  anxiety,  schizo-
phrenia  or  psychosis,  manic  depression  or  any  other 
serious  chronic  mental  disorder)  of  their  close  relatives 
(parents, siblings, children, spouse/partner).

Sociodemographics
As  for  the  socio- economic  variables  of  interest  in  this 
study,  we  assessed  survey  respondents  for  age  (16–65 
years), gender (male or female), educational level (low, 

Open access

low- average, high- average, high), income status (low, low- 
average, high- average, high) and marital status (married, 
separated, divorced, widowed or never married).

Statistical analysis
Family  burden  prevalence  as  related  to  family  health 
issues  was  calculated  using  cross- tabulations.  All  cross- 
tabulations  were  done  using  the  PROC  SURVEYFREQ 
procedure in SAS V.9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Caro-
lina, USA). Associations of mental health diagnosis with 
family  health  characteristics  were  generated  using  a 
multivariate  logistic  regression  model,  generated  using 
the PROC LOGISTIC procedure and reported ORs and 
95% CIs with statistical significance at p>0.05.

Transparency and openness
We  report  our  methods  for  determining  the  sample 
size  for  the  study,  data  exclusions  and  manipulations, 
study  measures,  following  the  Journal  Article  Reporting 
Standards.29  This  study’s  design  and  analysis  were  not 
preregistered.  All  data  are  readily  available  by  emailing 
the  corresponding  author.  We  used  the  Strengthening 
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
cross- sectional checklist when writing our report.30

Patient and public involvement
Patients  and/or  the  public  were  not  involved  in  the 
design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans 
of this research.

RESULTS
We found that 27.42% of respondents had family members 
with health issues. Of these, 40.23% were diagnosed with 
a mental health condition (table 1). We found that 73.4% 
had  some  form  of  burden  entailed  in  caring  for  family, 
with  burden  of  time  being  most  prevalent  (61.8%), 
followed by feelings of distress (34.7%), financial burden 
(10.3%) and feelings of embarrassment (8%).

Respondents  spent  a  mean  of  16  hours  per  week 
providing  care  for  family  members  with  health  issues. 
We  found  a  mean  spend  of  23%  of  median  household 
income  to  provide  care  for  family  members  with  health 
issues (table 2).

When  considering  the  differential  family  burden  by 
type of relative with a health issue, the odds of having any 
type of burden to be more likely/higher when caring for 
a spouse (OR 3.44), but the burden was significant when 
caring for a child (table 3). As for the burden on time, the 
odds were significantly higher when caring for a spouse 
(OR  26.98),  parent  (OR  24.19)  and  siblings  (OR  9.82). 
The  odds  for  financial  burden  were  significantly  higher 
among respondents who have a relative with health issues, 
regardless  of  the  relative  type,  compared  with  respon-
dents whose relatives do not have health issues (table 3).
Respondents  were  significantly  more  likely  to  expe-
rience  distress  when  caring  for  a  parent  (OR  8.97), 
followed by caring for a sibling (OR 8.32), a spouse (OR

†The population- level estimate was obtained by multiplying the

reported spending any time.
‡Individual- level reports of financial burden were converted to 
percentages of median household income (Saudi Riyal 8928.57). The 
means of these transformed scores among respondents who reported 
any financial burden are reported here. For example, the mean 
monthly financial impact of health issues (due either to out- of- pocket 
expenses or foregone income) among respondents who reported such 
costs was equal to 23.28% of the median monthly household income.
§The population- level estimate of financial burden was obtained 
by multiplying the individual- level estimate by the proportion of 
respondents who reported such burdens. The resulting estimate can 
be interpreted as the total financial costs of family health issues as a 
percentage of total household income.

that having a parent with a health issue was significantly 
associated with reduced odds of time burden (OR 0.34) 
and financial burden (OR 0.28) (table 3).

We  found  significant  variation  in  the  type  of  family 
burden  associated  with  the  type  of  health  issue  (online 
supplemental table S1). For physical health issues, having 
a family member with a heart disorder, physical disability 
or other serious chronic illness was associated with higher 
odds  of  time  and  financial  burden,  and  lower  risk  for 
reporting  embarrassment  and  distress.  Having  a  family 
member  with  cancer  was  associated  with  significantly 
reduced  odds  of  any  burden  (OR  0.30)  and  increased 
odds of financial burden (OR 4.18).

The mental disorders studied were significantly associ-
ated with increased odds of several burden outcomes for 
caregivers.  Manic  depression  was  associated  with  signifi-
cantly  increased  odds  of  distress  (OR  8.34).  Caring  for 
family  members  with  a  serious  memory  disorder  posed 
twice the risk for any burden (OR 3.52), 44 times the risk 
for  time  burden  (OR  44.99)  and  10  times  the  risk  for 
financial burden (OR 10.31); and lower risk for financial 
expenditure (OR 0.23), amount of time spent (OR 0.20) 
and  distress  (OR  0.16)  (online  supplemental  table  S1). 
The burden associated with caring for a family member 
with  schizophrenia  or  psychosis  was  significantly  higher 
(OR 5.13) than those associated with other mental disor-
ders (online supplemental table S1).

In  considering  the  sociodemographic  factors  and  the 
differential  burden,  we  found  that  relative  to  males, 
females  were  significantly  less  likely  to  be  associated 
with  burden  (OR  0.58),  as  well  as  spend  a  less  amount

of  time  providing  care  for  family  members  with  health 
issues. As for age, we found that those aged 31–49 years 
were most likely to experience a time burden for family 
caregiving  and  distress,  in  comparison  with  other  age 
categories.  As  for  level  of  education,  we  found  burden 
to be significantly less likely to be associated with respon-
dents of high average level of education, for time, distress 
and  embarrassment  experienced.  As  for  marital  status, 
the likelihood of burden was highest for those who were 
married,  however,  the  financial  burden  was  found  to

be  significantly  higher  for  those  who  were  separated/
divorced or widowed (OR 3.83). In considering income 
levels, we found that respondents of high average income 
are  significantly  more  likely  to  spend  time  in  providing 
care  for  the  family  members  with  health  issues  (online 
supplemental table S2).

DISCUSSION
General family burden
We  found  over  one- third  of  the  study  sample  to  be 
providing  care  for  a  family  member  with  some  form  of 
health issue. Within this group, 40% had a mental health 
diagnosis.  Approximately  73%  of  the  study  population 
reported  experiencing  some  form  of  burden  because 
of  the  care  they  provide  for  their  family  members.  Our 
findings correlate with previous studies that show a high 
rate of depression, stigma and time burden among care-
givers.13–15  17  We  found  significant  levels  of  burden  in 
caring for family members with serious memory disorders 
or mental retardation, which points to issues in terms of 
the ability to cope with the care demands. On a popula-
tion  level,  being  required  to  direct  time,  energy,  atten-
tion and finances to provide care to a family member with 
a  mental  disorder  will  certainly  detract  from  a  person’s 
ability to live their lives fully.1 10 11

We found female gender to be significantly associated 
with a lower burden of caregiving. This is relevant to note 
as it is in contrast to previous studies that found female 
caregivers faced higher burdens and could be reasoned to 
reflect the influence of women’s perceptions of their roles 
and their reporting of the burden.11 14 15 17 This could also 
be due to the rapidly shifting social and gender dynamics 
in Saudi society and bears further study and exploration 
for potential self- reporting or social context issues.31

As for age, those aged 31–49 years were most likely to 
experience any burden of family caregiving, most signifi-
cantly time burden, followed by distress experienced as a 
result. This is also important to note for Saudi Arabia, as 
this is the age range for peak work and career productivity, 
in conjunction with the shifting gender dynamics and the 
increasing participation of women in the workforce.20 32 
We found those with low- average levels of education were 
at highest risk for burden across the board, and this was 
significant for time, distress and embarrassment, and in 
alignment with previous studies.1 11

Time burden
In  our  study,  61%  of  the  study  population  reported  time 
burden, spending an average of 16 hours per week providing 
care to their family members with a health disorder. We found 
the general burden and burden on time to be highest when 
caring for a spouse, followed by caring for a parent or a child. 
These findings reflect what was illustrated by previous studies 
on the impact of caring for a family member with a mental 
disorder.1 5 10 11 The amount of time burden was highest when 
caring  for  a  spouse,  and  although  this  particularly  was  not 
statistically significant it is relevant to note that the day- to- day

care requirements for a spouse with health issues are consider-
ably burdensome and time- consuming, given that the spouse 
is expected to be more independent and of a support to the 
family.11  15  However,  further  exploration  of  these  aspects  is 
required. We found the burden on time to be highest when 
caring for a family member with serious memory disorders, 
mental  retardation,  schizophrenia/psychosis,  followed  by 
anxiety,  alcohol/drug  disorders,  depression  and  manic 
depression,  and  these  were  statistically  significant.  Our 
findings  align  with  the  realities  of  dealing  with  these  types 
of health issues in family members, as they require intense 
attention and devotion to support in managing daily duties; 
in making decisions, choices or taking action throughout the 
day, attending healthcare visits and maintaining their treat-
ment or medication regimens and personal safety.6 Our find-
ings again correlate with several others who found a higher 
burden  for  care  of  parents,  spouses  and  children  than  for 
siblings.1 6 10 11 14 33

Financial burden
Respondents  with  family  members  with  health  issues  were 
significantly more likely to experience financial burden than 
those  without,  regardless  of  relation  type.  Approximately 
10%  reported  financial  burden,  spending  around  20% 
of  their  household  income  on  caregiving.  The  amount  of 
financial burden was more likely to be higher when caring 
for a sibling, followed by a child and a spouse. We found the 
highest financial burden in caring for family members with 
serious  memory  disorder,  alcohol/drug  disorders,  mental 
retardation,  schizophrenia/psychosis,  depression,  anxiety 
and  manic  depression.  Financial  burden  was  significantly 
higher for those separated/divorced or widowed. We found 
significant  results  for  the  amount  of  time  spent  by  those 
with high average income on providing care for the family 
members with health issues, which is also in alignment with 
Saudi social context and average spending rates per income 
brackets in the country.34

Distress and embarrassment
Regardless of relative type, distress and embarrassment were 
significantly more likely to be observed among respondents 
who have  a family  member  with a health issue. Thirty- four 
per cent of respondents reported distress and 8% reported 
embarrassment. As for types of mental disorder, the highest 
levels of distress were found among respondents caring for a 
family member with manic depression, followed by depres-
sion, anxiety, mental retardation, serious memory disorder, 
alcohol or drug disorders and schizophrenia/psychosis. The 
highest  level  of  embarrassment  was  found  in  caring  for  a 
family member with a serious memory disorder, followed by 
manic  depression,  depression,  mental  retardation,  anxiety, 
schizophrenia/psychosis  and  lastly  for  alcohol/drug  disor-
ders.  This  could  be  due  to  the  multiple  misconceptions, 
negative  attitudes  and  significant  stigma  towards  mental 
disorders  in  Saudi  society,  previously  discussed  by  Alan-
gari et al.35 There is a low level of mental health literacy in 
Saudi society, and aversion to seeking mental health support 
in  the  individuals  suffering  and  caregivers  due  to  stigma 

6

associated  with  cultural  and  religious  beliefs  about  mental 
disorders.  This  includes  concerns  around  lack  of  faith  or 
the evil eye, black magic or possession and the perception of 
mental disorders as a source of weakness, embarrassment or 
shame.6 14 15 35 Recently, there has been a shift in the level of 
understanding and social acceptance for mental health issues 
that are neurologically oriented, such as memory disorders 
(dementia  or  Alzheimer’s  disease),  which  may  explain  the 
lower level of embarrassment or stigma socially where these 
disorders are concerned, but nevertheless creates significant 
distress for a caregiver, especially one who is a family member 
and emotionally impacted by these health issues.13 35 36

Policy and practice implications
As mental disorders are some of the leading causes of disability 
worldwide, the burden of mental disorders on society is large 
due to the complexities of high prevalence, and impact on 
role  functioning  and  quality  of  life,  therefore  policy  must 
be  geared  towards  more  community- oriented  support  and 
preventive  services  to  reduce  burden  and  minimise  the 
impact on the individual as a caregiver, the family unit and 
society at large.8 18 21 37 38 BinDhim et al39 have suggested that 
monitoring  mental  health  status  on  a  population  level  is  a 
valuable source of information on mental health. The estab-
lishment  of  a  national  mental  health  surveillance  system 
should incorporate elements to suitably assess for caregiver 
burden, allowing decision makers to flag issues and provide 
suitable  interventions  in  the  community  and  within  the 
healthcare service.39

Our  findings  emphasise  a  serious  need  to  further  eval-
uate the types of support required by family members and 
develop means of access to this support, either in a physical 
sense for the day- to- day care duties, or in terms of mental and 
emotional health support for the caregiver from the health-
care  service  or  home  healthcare  or  using  virtual  support 
options,  or  financial  support,  minimising  burdens  of  care, 
especially on time and building capacity to provide the care 
required for their family members, improving quality of life 
for  each  person  involved,  which  will  reflect  overall  on  the 
health and well- being of society. Providing better community 
mental health services and enhanced mental health training 
for  primary  care  doctors,  general  practitioners,  nurses  and 
social  workers  along  with  cost- effective  screening  proce-
dures  and  timely  evidence- based  treatments  out- of- hospital 
and increase the capacity of professionals to provide holistic 
support to family caregivers may serve in this drive towards 
the reduction of the burden of mental health disorders on 
the population.12 15 16 40

It is relevant to note the strengths of this current work. As a 
subset of the SNMHS, it provides strong socio- epidemiological 
evidence estimating the burden of health issues on families in 
Saudi Arabia. The SNMHS methods, and study instrument, 
derived from the WMH survey initiative, have been validated 
and clinically appraised for robustness and accuracy of diag-
nostic criteria.24 As for limitations, the scope of the survey did 
not further explore complex care dynamics such as shared 
caregiving  within  the  household.  Also,  this  current  study 
did not assess associations with environmental issues such as 

Zedan HS, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e072115. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072115access  to  transportation  or  healthcare  services  and  did  not 
entail details of caregiver physical health and quality of life. 
Previous SNMHS studies have also discussed the limitations 
of social desirability bias resulting from perceived stigma or 
embarrassment on the self- reporting and responses during 
data collection, which may have implications for the underes-
timation of findings.22 31 35

Further avenues for research
Research is needed to explore the impact of informal care-
giving on family dynamics and caregiver quality of life, and 
interventions  designed  in- tune  with  population  needs  for 
support  both  in  the  community  and  within  the  healthcare 
service. It is necessary to increase social support for families 
coping with mental disorders and mental health literacy from 
a very young age to improve coping skills and reduce burden 
associated with mental health issues. It is also important to 
integrate mental health promotion and screening for mental 
disorders into all six patient- centred streams of care for all 
stages  of  life:  (Keep  Me  Well,  Chronic  Care,  Urgent  Care, 
Planned  Care,  Safe  Birth  and  Last  Phase)  as  part  of  the 
National  Mental  Health  Strategy  and  Health  Sector  Trans-
formation Programmes currently being developed.20 21 The 
findings  of  this  study  encourage  the  development  of  more 
comprehensive  mental  health  policies  and  investment  into 
community resources for health promotion and prevention 
of mental disorders before they become more of a significant 
burden on the health system and society.20 21

CONCLUSIONS
Having  a  family  member  with  health  issues  is  a  significant 
predictor for family burden in several categories. Over one- 
third of the study population were providing care for family 
members with health issue, 40% of which were mental health 
disorders.  Females  were  less  likely  to  experience  family 
burden, and over 70% of caregivers were experiencing some 
form of burden. The highest burden was in caring for those 
with  serious  memory  disorders,  mental  retardation,  schizo-
phrenia  or  psychosis,  alcohol  and  drug  disorders,  followed 
by anxiety, depression or manic depression. These burdens 
are expected to have a major impact on individuals’ ability to 
maintain strong coping skills and manage the demands asso-
ciated  with  informal  caring  for  family  members.  The  find-
ings from this study support efforts to develop a more robust 
understanding  of  the  intricacies  of  mental  and  physical 
disorders and impact on the informal caregiving infrastruc-
ture in the Saudi population, moving into the future as the 
population increases in age and multiple comorbidities and 
the  continued  establishment  of  home- healthcare  services. 
It  is  increasingly  important  to  consider  wide- ranging  inter-
ventions  to  promote  awareness,  education,  early  detection 
and screening and  implement social  support programmes, 
to  alleviate  burden  and  reduce  its  negative  impact  on  the 
productivity,  well- being  and  quality  of  life  of  caregivers. 
The findings will also inform mental health policy develop-
ment, planning and implementation of healthcare reforms 

Open access

and the patient- centred model of care, incorporating more 
robust  mental  health  promotion,  prevention  and  wellness 
programmes.20 21
