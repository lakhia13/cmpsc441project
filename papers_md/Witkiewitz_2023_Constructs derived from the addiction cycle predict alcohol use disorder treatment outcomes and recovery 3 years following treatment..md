Abstract

Objective:  The addiction cycle has been proposed as a framework for understanding the 
progression of alcohol use disorder (AUD) in terms of psychological and biological domains, 
including reward drinking/incentive salience, relief drinking/negative emotionality, and loss of 
control/executive functioning impairment. To have utility in clinical practice, self-report measures 
of these domains that are applicable across sociodemographic groups and associated with clinical 
outcomes are needed. This study sought to validate domains from self-report measures and to test

whether domains are measurement invariant across sociodemographic groups and associated with 
treatment outcomes.

Method:  Secondary analysis of individuals with AUD (n=3092) who participated in two alcohol 
clinical trials, Project MATCH and COMBINE. Factor analytic methods were used to derive 
addiction cycle domains at baseline. These domains were then examined as predictors of 
outcomes.

Results:  Fifteen self-report items were used as indicators of the addiction cycle domains, with 
sociodemographic differences in measurement by sex, age, race, education, and AUD symptoms. 
Relief/negative emotionality and reward/incentive salience were significantly associated with 
outcomes at one and three years following treatment, and executive functioning also predicted 
non-abstinent recovery at three-years.

Conclusions:  The results support the utility of domains relevant to the addiction cycle in 
predicting AUD treatment outcomes and recovery among individuals who sought treatment for 
AUD. The addiction cycle domains were more strongly associated with outcomes than other 
measures clinicians might use to predict outcomes (e.g., AUD symptoms). Future research should 
continue to develop and refine the items and test whether the addiction cycle domains can inform 
treatment planning.

Assessment; Alcohol and Addiction Research Domain Criteria

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and heterogeneous concerning etiology, 
symptoms, and clinical course (Witkiewitz, Litten, et al., 2019). Attempts to characterize 
heterogeneity in AUD (Kwako et al., 2019) have drawn on translational work that has 
proposed a three-stage model called the addiction cycle (Koob & Volkow, 2010, 2016). 
Based on behavioral and neurological adaptations in animals, the addiction cycle describes 
acquired neuroadaptations resulting from prolonged alcohol use. According to the addiction 
cycle, in the binge/intoxication stage of AUD, alcohol is primarily consumed for positive 
reinforcement and pleasure-seeking. In the withdrawal/negative affect stage, alcohol is 
primarily consumed to relieve negative affect. In the preoccupation/anticipation stage, 
drinking appears to be driven by habitual alcohol seeking and loss of control over alcohol 
use. Assessing between-person heterogeneity in AUD based on neuroadaptations seen in 
animal models holds promise because of the potential to model brain-behavior relationships 
that may inform treatments tailored to specific dysfunctions.

Addiction Cycle and Attempts to Measure Domains of Addiction

The addiction cycle has been expanded to incorporate multiple domains of functioning in 
the Alcohol and Addiction Research Domain Criteria (AARDoC) (Litten et al., 2015), which 
has been operationalized in the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) (Kwako et 
al., 2016). The AARDoC focuses on the following three domains that correspond to the 
addiction cycle: incentive salience in the binge/intoxication phase, negative emotionality in 
the withdrawal/ negative affect phase, and impaired executive function in the preoccupation/

anticipation phase. The ANA proposes multimodal measures of craving and reward-seeking 
in the incentive salience domain, negative affective states and traits in the negative 
emotionality domain, and general executive function deficits and loss of control over 
drinking in the executive function domain. There are similar efforts underway to develop 
domains relevant to the neuropsychological assessment of the etiology and course of 
substance use disorders, more broadly (Yücel et al., 2019), and to develop a National 
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) phenotyping assessment battery (PhAB) focused on 
neurofunctional domains of metacognition, interoception, executive function, incentive 
salience, negative emotionality, and sleep (Keyser-Marcus et al., 2021).

A combination of physiological, neuroimaging, genetic, self-report, and clinical observation 
measures have been proposed for measuring ANA domains (Kwako et al., 2016, 2018), 
with the full battery estimated to take 10 hours to complete (Ghitza, 2017). Similarly, the 
NIDA PhAB incorporates behavioral, neuropsychological, and self-report measures with an 
estimated 3 hours to complete. Importantly, nearly all treatment settings lack capacity to 
implement neuroimaging, behavioral and neuropsychological tasks, or genotyping measures 
to guide precision medicine. Identifying brief self-report measures that could measure 
domains relevant to the addiction cycle and guide precision medicine in AUD treatment 
settings would provide invaluable tools for clinicians and patients. In line with this goal and 
given the potential translational utility of the addiction cycle, it is necessary to identify valid 
and easy-to-administer measures of domains related to the addiction cycle in humans with 
AUD.

Limitations of AARDoC and ANA in Measuring the Addiction Cycle

Initial attempts to validate the AARDoC in AUD among humans using iterations of the 
ANA have primarily used broad self-report measures that are not necessarily linked to 
drinking (e.g., general anxiety and depression), as shown in Table 1. These prior studies 
have identified considerable overlap among the constructs of the ANA (DeMartini et al., 
2021; Kwako et al., 2019; Nieto et al., 2021), and have indicated high factor correlations 
(e.g., factor correlations range from .76 to .90 in Kwako et al. 2019). These limitations might 
be partly attributable to the very broad domains proposed in ANA that do not consistently or 
clearly correspond to the addiction cycle (Koob, 2021)1. For example, factor analyses of the 
ANA have included positive urgency as an indicator of both executive function and negative 
emotionality. Still, in one study, positive urgency did not load strongly on either factor 
(Kwako et al., 2019) and loaded strongly on executive function in another study (DeMartini 
et al., 2021). Similarly, delay discounting and neuropsychological tasks have been tested 
in multiple studies but have not loaded strongly on factors assumed to measure executive 
functioning (Kwako et al., 2019; Nieto et al., 2021).

1It is important to note that the operationalization of the addiction cycle using the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment has been 
inconsistently described across the literature, with differences in whether the ANA is meant to capture the temporal progression of 
acquired symptoms of repeated alcohol administration, as represented by the addiction cycle, or whether the ANA is meant to capture 
vulnerability for AUD (Koob, 2021; Kwako et al., 2016, 2017, 2019). From an AUD treatment perspective, in the current study we 
were more interested in those measures that might predict AUD treatment response and inform precision medicine.

In contrast to the many trait-like, dispositional constructs assessed in prior ANA validation 
studies, the addiction cycle proposes a temporal progression from positive reinforcement 
and reward drinking to negative reinforcement and relief drinking to loss of control and 
compulsive use of alcohol. Measures that better map onto these constructs, particularly 
concerning the acquired nature of reward drinking, relief drinking, and loss of control 
following repeated alcohol consumption, might demonstrate better measurement properties 
(e.g., higher factor loadings, more distinct domains) and have greater clinical utility. Indeed, 
the extent to which individuals engage in reward or relief drinking and experience loss of 
flexible control over alcohol use has predicted response to AUD treatments (Goldfarb et al., 
2022; Kranzler & McKay, 2012; Litten et al., 2015; Mann et al., 2018; Roos et al., 2017; 
Volkow, 2018; Witkiewitz, Roos, et al., 2019).

In addition, assessment tools measuring constructs of the addiction cycle for precision 
medicine should be measured consistently across sociodemographic subgroups (i.e., 
measurement equivalence) and should predict clinical outcomes. Prior work examining 
measurement equivalence of the ANA domains has provided evidence of measurement 
equivalence of incentive salience and negative emotionality by sex (Stein et al., 2021; Votaw 
et al., 2020), but measurement equivalence across other sociodemographic variables that can 
impact AUD etiology, treatment, and outcomes have not been examined. There is substantial 
evidence of racial/ethnic differences in AUD etiology, treatment, and recovery (Zemore 
et al., 2018). Age is also important to examine, given potential age differences in AUD 
treatment outcomes (Brennan et al., 2011). Age, race, and family history of AUD have 
been associated with ANA domains (DeMartini et al., 2021; Kwako et al., 2019; Nieto et 
al., 2021; Stein et al., 2021), and years of education have been inversely associated with 
impaired cognitive function among individuals with AUD (Requena-Ocaña et al., 2021).

Self-report measures of the addiction cycle domains may also be more useful in clinical 
practice and precision medicine if they are predictive of meaningful clinical outcomes, 
including traditional outcomes of alcohol consumption (e.g., percent heavy drinking days) 
and more broadly defined recovery outcomes following treatment (Witkiewitz et al., 2020). 
Only one prior study has examined the predictive validity of the negative emotionality 
domain in a treatment sample (Votaw et al., 2021) and found that greater negative 
emotionality predicted drinking intensity one year following treatment entry. Examining 
phenotypes in a large sample of individuals with AUD who received treatment and were 
followed prospectively would provide a unique opportunity to study if and how domains 
related to the addiction cycle are associated with AUD treatment outcomes and recovery 
over time among patients with AUD.

Current Study

This study took an exploratory and confirmatory approach to test addiction cycle domains 
from self-report measures, examine predictors and moderators of those domains across 
sociodemographic groups, and examine whether the addiction cycle domains are associated 
with alcohol treatment outcomes and recovery. We hypothesized items that mapped most 
clearly to the addiction cycle stages of reward drinking (incentive salience of AARDoC), 
relief drinking (negative emotionality of AARDoC), and loss of control (impaired executive

function of AARDoC) over alcohol use (Koob, 2021) would provide a good fit to the 
data, and that these domains would be associated with AUD treatment outcomes among 
individuals seeking treatment for AUD. Throughout this manuscript, we will use the terms 
reward/incentive salience, relief/negative emotionality, and loss of control/executive function 
to refer to domains that correspond with the addiction cycle and AARDoC/ANA. Based 
on prior work, we hypothesized greater relief/negative emotionality would be associated 
with greater drinking intensity (Votaw et al., 2021), that greater reward/incentive salience 
would be associated with greater drinking frequency (Roos et al., 2017), and that lower loss 
of control/executive function impairment would be associated with non-abstinent recovery 
(Stein & Witkiewitz, 2019).

Methods

Participants

COMBINE Study participants (N=1,383) (Anton et al., 2006) were recruited from 11 
research sites and met criteria for alcohol dependence based on the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM), 4th edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). 
Project MATCH participants (N=1,726) (Project MATCH Research Group, 1997) were 
recruited from 9 research sites and met DSM-III-R (Spitzer & Williams, 1985) criteria for 
alcohol abuse (9.2%) or dependence (90.8%). Exclusion criteria across both trials included 
current drug use disorder (other than nicotine or cannabis), a psychiatric disorder requiring 
medication, or an unstable medical condition.

Participants in COMBINE were randomized to receive 16 weeks of treatment with 
naltrexone (100 mg/day), acamprosate (3000 mg/day), or placebo equivalents, and 
medication management (MM) or combined behavioral intervention (CBI) with MM. 
Participants in Project MATCH were randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment 
with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Enhancement Therapy, or Twelve-Step 
Facilitation.

Among participants recruited into the COMBINE trial, 874 participants from nine sites 
(n=1144; 76.4%) consented to a 3-year follow-up called the COMBINE Economic Study 
(Bray et al., 2007) (Zarkin et al., 2008) and 694 participants (79% of COMBINE 
participants who consented to the 3-year follow-up) completed assessments at the 3-year 
assessment. For Project MATCH, participants in the outpatient arm (n=952) consented to a 
3-year follow-up, and 806 participants (84.7%) completed assessments at the 3-year follow-
up. Of the 1500 who completed three year follow-ups, 1492 (99.5%) were included in the 
latent profile analysis and 1457 (97.1%) were included in analyses examining addiction 
cycle constructs and recovery outcomes.

Assessments

Sociodemographics and AUD symptom count.—Sociodemographic measures were 
assessed via a demographics form, including age, sex assigned at birth (gender identity was 
not assessed), race and ethnicity, marital status, education, and family history of alcohol 
problems. Alcohol dependence symptom count was assessed using the Structured Clinical

1985).

Addiction Cycle Indicators.—In both COMBINE and Project MATCH, we used all 
available measures that could be used for phenotyping of the addiction cycle domains to test 
initial models. The final models (shown in Table 2) utilized item indicators from the Alcohol 
Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale, Temptation subscale (DiClemente et al., 1994), the Alcohol 
Use Inventory (Horn et al., 1990), the Alcohol Dependence Scale (Skinner & Horn, 1984), 
and the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (Anton et al., 1995).

Concurrent Validity: Covariates at Baseline.—For both COMBINE and MATCH, 
we examined the association between the addiction cycle domains and other measures 
of clinical functioning at baseline. Specifically, we examined measures of psychological 
distress, including the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1988) in MATCH and 
the Brief Symptom Inventory Global Symptom Scale (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983) in 
COMBINE; a single item assessing temptation to drink in the past week at the first session 
of treatment (Witkiewitz, 2013); loss of control measures, including the Multidimensional 
Personality Questionnaire, Control scale (Tellegen & Waller, 2008), and the Alcohol Use 
Inventory Loss of Control Scale (Horn et al., 1990) in MATCH; and measures of alcohol 
use severity, including the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Saunders et al., 1993) 
and alcohol dependence symptom count assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Spitzer & Williams, 1985) in both 
COMBINE and MATCH.

AUD Treatment Outcomes at One Year Follow-Up.—In both COMBINE and 
MATCH, alcohol and other drug use were assessed at the one-year follow-up using the Form 
90 (Miller, 1996), a calendar-based, self-report method to measure daily alcohol and other 
drug use over the past 90 days. We calculated summary measures of alcohol consumption, 
defined by drinking intensity (drinks per drinking day, DDD), drinking frequency (percent 
drinking days, PDD), and percent heavy drinking days (PHDD, defined as the percent 
of days with consumption of at least 4/5 drinks for women/men) at one-year following 
treatment.

Recovery Outcomes at Three Year Follow-Up.—We defined recovery based on 
consumption and functioning, as done in prior studies of the COMBINE (Witkiewitz et 
al., 2020) and MATCH data (Witkiewitz, Wilson, et al., 2019). The Form 90 (Miller, 1996) 
was used to calculate summary measures of alcohol consumption over the previous 90 days 
at the three-year follow-up, including DDD, PDD, and PHDD. We also calculated binary 
measures of any cannabis use, any other drug use, and employment in COMBINE and 
MATCH.

Functioning was further measured in COMBINE with physical health and mental health 
composite scores from the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) (Ware et al., 1996) 
and the physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental domains from 
the 26-item World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) 
(WHOQOL Group, 1998). Functioning was further measured in MATCH by the Drinker

Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) (Miller et al., 1995), the Psychosocial Functioning 
Inventory (PFI) (Feragne et al., 1983), and items from the Addiction Severity Index 
(ASI) (McLellan et al., 1992), including “serious depression,” cognitive difficulty (“trouble 
understanding, concentrating, or remembering”), and “serious anxiety or tension.”

Statistical Analyses

All analyses were conducted in Mplus, version 8.6 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017), using 
maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a sandwich estimator to 
accommodate clustering within research sites. Maximum likelihood is a robust method 
for handling missing data, assuming data are missing at random. Several latent variable 
modeling methods were used and are described briefly here. A full description of addiction 
cycle indicators, analysis code, and results are available at https://osf.io/46ch9/. Factor 
analyses were not pre-registered and are exploratory. We used a false discovery rate 
procedure (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) to adjust the p-value for multiplicity. We report 
test statistics for each coefficient and exact p-values for all covariate effects.

Latent Factor Analysis.—Given high intercorrelations among the latent factors in prior 
factor analyses of the AARDoC domains (Kwako et al., 2019), we used an exploratory 
structural equation modeling (ESEM) approach (Marsh et al., 2014) to examine the three 
addiction cycle domains (reward/incentive salience, relief/negative emotionality, and loss 
of control/executive function). ESEM allows all items to load on all domains but specifies 
target rotation based on a priori theoretical fit of specific items with specific domains. 
Addiction cycle domains were initially modeled as three latent factors indicated by 66 a 
priori identified indicator variables in COMBINE and 54 indicator variables from MATCH. 
These indicators were selected based on prior studies of the AARDoC domains and the 
ANA (DeMartini et al., 2021; Kwako et al., 2019; Nieto et al., 2021; see Table 1), prior 
studies of reward/relief drinking (Roos et al., 2017), a thorough literature review of the 
animal and human studies of the addiction cycle (Koob, 2021; Koob & Volkow, 2016), and 
available data in the Project MATCH and COMBINE datasets.

Models were estimated separately for each study using a random split-half sample, including 
potentially cross-loading terms via target rotation, and iteratively testing all possible 
indicators of the addiction cycle domains. The number of indicator variables was reduced 
in the first split-half sample based on factor loadings, model fit statistics (Comparative Fit 
Index (CFI)>.96; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)<.06; Standardized 
Root Mean Square (SRMR)<.08), coefficient omega (Ω) reliability, and substantive 
considerations (Stanton et al., 2022). The final model was then replicated in the remaining 
random half of the data, and model fit was excellent (COMBINE: χ2(33)=41.20, 
p=.15; CFI=.998; RMSEA=.019; SRMR=.017; MATCH: χ2(25)=70.88 p<.001; CFI=.982; 
RMSEA=.046; SRMR=.025).

The data from both samples were then recombined and indicators from the final ESEMs 
from both studies were integrated to create a common set of addiction cycle measures for all 
participants within a single model. These integrated addiction cycle measures were modeled 
using moderated nonlinear factor analysis (MNLFA) (Hussong et al., 2013; Kruger et al.,

2021), which allows for combining disparate sets of indicators across studies as long as 
there is at least one item in common per factor. We iteratively tested whether factor means, 
factor variances, item intercepts, and item loadings were significantly predicted (p<0.01) by 
study and by sociodemographic factors, including sex, age, race, marital status, education 
years, family history of AUD, and AUD symptom counts based on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV 
alcohol dependence criteria. We used estimates from the MNLFA to generate expectation 
a posteriori scale scores that had the same metric across studies and corrected for different 
sets of items being available in both studies and for potential measurement non-equivalence 
(i.e., differential item functioning) that could be present across sociodemographic groups 
and AUD severity (i.e., symptom count).

Concurrent Validity Analyses.—We examined the concurrent validity of the addiction 
cycle MNLFA scores by evaluating Pearson product moment correlations of addiction cycle 
MNLFA scores with other baseline measures assessed in COMBINE and MATCH. We 
hypothesized greater relief/negative emotionality would be associated with psychological 
distress, greater reward/incentive salience would be associated with temptation to drink, and 
that more loss of control/executive function impairment would be associated with greater 
loss of control and greater dependence severity.

Predictive Validity Analysis.—For one-year follow-up outcomes of DDD, PDD, and 
PHDD, we used linear regression with the addiction cycle MNLFA scores predicting 
consumption outcomes, controlling for sociodemographic variables. As noted, we 
hypothesized greater relief/negative emotionality would be associated with greater drinking 
intensity, greater reward/incentive salience would be associated with greater drinking 
frequency, and lower loss of control/executive function impairment would be associated 
with non-abstinent recovery.

For three-year follow-up recovery outcomes, we used latent profile analysis to identify 
recovery profiles defined by consumption and functioning, as has been described and 
validated previously (Witkiewitz et al., 2020), following reporting guidelines (Nylund et 
al., 2007) with entropy and information criteria used to select the final latent profile 
model. In brief, four latent recovery profiles reflecting differing levels of drinking and 
functioning were derived based on indicators of alcohol use (PDD, PHDD, DDD), quality 
of life (physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environmental subscales of 
WHOQOL-BREF (WHOQOL Group, 1998)), physical and mental health (SF-12), alcohol-
related consequences (DrInC) (Miller et al., 1995), psychosocial functioning (PFI) (Feragne 
et al., 1983), addiction severity (ASI) (McLellan et al., 1992), and three binary measures of 
employment status, cannabis use, and other drug use. Associations between pre-treatment 
addiction cycle domains and latent recovery profiles were examined using multinomial 
logistic regression with addiction cycle domains and sociodemographic characteristics 
predicting the odds of latent profile membership. A three-step approach was used to 
account for uncertainty in profile assignment (Vermunt, 2010). Finally, we also estimated 
logistic regression models with addiction cycle domains predicting achieving a latent profile 
characterized by recovery versus those profiles not consistent with recovery.

Descriptive Analyses

Page 9

Individuals in the full COMBINE and MATCH samples with available data on all addiction 
cycle domain indicators at baseline were included in the ESEM and MNLFA models 
(n=3065, 98.6% of all COMBINE and MATCH participants). Among this sample, 27.2% 
were female, 1.4% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.2% Asian/Pacific Islander, 8.9% 
Black, 9.5% Hispanic, 0.6% multiracial, 78.6% non-Hispanic White, and 0.8% identified 
as another race/ethnicity that was not listed, and the mean age was 42.12 (SD=10.9). 
A subset of participants in MATCH and COMBINE (n=1826) consented to a three-year 
follow-up, and 1492 of these participants (81.7% of those consenting) completed the three-
year follow-up and were included in latent profile analyses. Among this sample, 28.9% were 
female, 1.4% American Indian/Alaska Native, 0.1% Asian/Pacific Islander, 7.6% Black, 
9.5% Hispanic, 0.9% multiracial, 79.5% non-Hispanic White, and 1.1% identified as another 
race/ethnicity, and the mean age was 41.51 (SD=11.01). Individuals who completed the 
three-year follow-up were significantly younger (F(1)=8.97, p=0.002), with fewer years of 
education (F(1)=10.93, p<0.001), but did not significantly differ from those who did not 
complete the three-year follow-up on measures of drinking outcomes assessed at baseline.

Latent Factor Analyses: Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) and Moderated 
Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA)

Starting with a random split-half sample, we found that ESEM models with 66 item 
indicators in COMBINE and 54 item indicators in MATCH provided a poor fit to the data 
(shown in Table S1). We re-estimated several models, removed items with low loadings 
or high cross-loadings, and identified a final model with 12 indicators in COMBINE and 
11 indicators in MATCH (15 items total when pooled across studies). These models had 
factor loadings consistent with addiction cycle domains, fit the data well, and replicated 
in the other random half of the data with excellent model fit (Table S1). The three factors 
could be defined as reflecting aspects of reward drinking and incentive salience (the item 
assessing temptation to drink “When I am being offered a drink in a social situation” had 
the largest loading on the reward/incentive salience factor), relief drinking and negative 
emotionality (the item assessing temptation to drink “When I am depressed” had the largest 
loading on the relief/negative emotionality factor), and loss of control over drinking and 
impaired executive function (the item “Are you able to control the amount you drink? 
(reverse scored)” had the largest loading on the loss of control/executive function factor). 
The indicators also had good internal consistency (reward/incentive salience: COMBINE 
Ω=.82; MATCH Ω=.82; relief/negative emotionality: COMBINE Ω=.86; MATCH Ω=.86; 
loss of control/executive function: COMBINE Ω=.69; MATCH Ω=.70).

The 15 pooled indicators across both studies from the final ESEM models were then 
combined using MNLFA. The factor loadings and percentage of variance explained for 
each of the 15 indicators are provided in Table 2 and Figure 1. We tested a series of 
MNLFA models adjusting for measurement non-equivalence by sex, age, race, marital 
status, education years, family history of AUD, and AUD symptom count. We identified 
measurement non-equivalence on most items for most sociodemographic factors (Table S2).

There was only measurement equivalence for addiction cycle domains by sex, family history 
of AUD, or by marital status.

Sociodemographic variables also predicted levels of addiction cycle domains. As shown in 
Figure 1, women and people who were in COMBINE, were younger, or had more AUD 
symptoms reported higher mean reward/incentive salience; women and people who were 
White, were younger, or had more AUD symptoms reported higher mean relief/negative 
emotionality; women and people who were in COMBINE, were younger, were White, or 
had more AUD symptoms reported more loss of control/executive functioning impairment. 
There were no mean differences by family history of AUD, marital status, or years of 
education.

We used estimates from the MNLFA to generate expectation a posteriori scale scores that 
had the same metric across studies and corrected for measurement non-equivalence by 
sociodemographic groups.

Concurrent Validity: Associations with other Measures at Baseline

MNLFA scores representing the three addiction cycle domains were correlated with each 
other and demonstrated concurrent validity with other measures associated with AUD 
outcomes (Table 3). Temptation to drink was most strongly associated with reward/ incentive 
salience (r=.331), Beck Depression Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory Global 
Severity were most strongly associated with relief/negative emotionality (r=.387 and r 
=.399, respectively), and the Loss of Control scale of the Alcohol Use Inventory and AUD 
symptom count were most strongly correlated with loss of control/executive function (r 
=.618 and r =.434, respectively).

Predictive Validity: Outcomes at One Year Following Treatment

The results of linear regression analyses predicting continuous outcomes with covariate 
adjustment are shown in Table 4. Relief/negative emotionality scores were significantly 
associated with DDD and PHDD, such that greater relief/negative emotionality at baseline 
predicted greater drinking intensity and more frequent heavy drinking. Reward/incentive 
salience was significantly associated with PDD (as well as abstinence as a binary outcome, 
see Table S3), such that greater reward/incentive salience at baseline predicted more frequent 
drinking one year following treatment. Notably, all of the variables only explained a small 
proportion of variance in drinking outcomes at the one-year follow-up (R2=0.03–0.05), 
and ANA domains uniquely explained 1%−2% of the variance in drinking outcomes at 
follow-up.

Predictive Validity: Recovery at Three Years Following Treatment

Consistent with prior work (Witkiewitz et al., 2020), a four profile model of three-year 
post-treatment recovery was interpretable and had good model fit (Table S4), with profiles 
characterized by (see Table S5): 1) low functioning frequent heavy drinking (14.9% of the 
sample; 0% abstinent), 2) low functioning infrequent heavy drinking (15.9% of the sample; 
28.9% abstinent), 3) high functioning heavy drinking (17.8% of the sample; 0% abstinent), 
and 4) high functioning infrequent drinking (51.3% of the sample; 47.8% abstinent).

Results of the multinomial logistic regression examining addiction cycle domains and 
sociodemographic variables as predictors of latent profile membership are shown in Table 
5. Higher reward/incentive salience at baseline predicted a lower probability of membership 
in the two infrequent heavy drinking profiles (profiles 2 and 4), compared to the high 
functioning heavy drinking profile (profile 3), and a lower probability of membership in the 
low functioning infrequent drinkers (profile 2) compared to the high functioning infrequent 
drinking profile (profile 4). Greater reward/incentive salience was also associated with a 
higher probability of membership in the low functioning frequent heavy drinking profile 
(profile 1) than the low functioning infrequent heavy drinking profile (profile 2). Relief/
negative emotionality differentiated the low and high functioning profiles, such that lower 
relief/negative emotionality at baseline predicted a higher probability of membership in the 
high functioning profiles (profiles 3 and 4) versus low functioning profiles (profiles 1 and 2). 
Loss of control/executive function did not differentiate recovery profiles in the multinomial 
logistic regression models.

Individuals with expected classification in profiles 1 and 2 were then combined into a 
“non-recovery” group and compared to those with most likely classification in profile 3 
(heavy drinking recovery), and also compared to those with most likely classification in 
profile 4 (infrequent drinking recovery) using logistic regression. As shown in Figure 2a, 
all three addiction cycle domains were associated with expected membership in profile 
3, as compared to the non-recovery profiles, such that higher reward/incentive salience, 
lower relief/negative emotionality, and less impaired control/executive function predicted 
membership in profile 3 (all p<0.001). As shown in Figure 2b, only relief/negative 
emotionality predicted membership in profile 4, such that lower relief/negative emotionality 
predicted membership in profile 4 as compared to the non-recovery profiles (p<0.001).

Discussion

In two large AUD clinical trial samples, the addiction cycle domains of reward/incentive 
salience, relief/negative emotionality, and loss of control/executive functioning were 
identified with 15 self-report items, demonstrated concurrent validity based on associations 
with other measures, and were significantly associated with treatment outcomes one year 
following treatment and AUD recovery profiles three years following treatment, albeit 
with small effect sizes. Prior work examining the AARDoC domains using the ANA has 
suffered from limited discrimination between domains and has not tested predictive validity 
to clinical outcomes among individuals with AUD. The current study builds on this prior 
work by taking an initial step in validating a measure of addiction cycle domains using brief, 
patient-report measures that could potentially inform precision medicine approaches to AUD 
treatment, testing whether domains are equivalent across sociodemographic groups, and 
demonstrating their associations with clinical outcomes. The items included in the current 
study are from a range of different instruments with disparate instructions and response 
options. Future work is needed to develop a single instrument, and to conduct cognitive 
interviews (Boness & Sher, 2020) and tests of validity and clinical utility in a more diverse 
sample of individuals enrolled in alcohol treatment.

Relief/negative emotionality, in particular, was associated with the intensity of drinking and 
frequency of heavy drinking at one-year post-treatment and differentiated those individuals 
who experienced high functioning recovery from those who continued to have lower 
functioning, regardless of their level of drinking. In contrast, reward/incentive salience was 
most likely to predict the frequency of drinking at one-year post-treatment and differentiated 
heavy drinkers from the other outcome profiles at three-year follow-up, such that individuals 
with greater reward/incentive salience were more likely to continue to engage in heavy 
drinking at three years following treatment. These findings indicate that reward/incentive 
salience was more likely associated with frequency of drinking and continued heavy 
drinking, whereas relief/negative emotionality was more strongly associated with the 
intensity of drinking and functioning. Prior work has also found relief/negative emotionality 
to be particularly associated with greater intensity of heavy drinking and poorer functioning 
(Mann et al., 2018; Witkiewitz & Villarroel, 2009), and prior work on the ANA also found 
incentive salience to be more strongly associated with drinking frequency (Nieto et al., 
2021). It could be that negative emotionality predicts how much people drink when they are 
drinking, consistent with theory on relief motives (Cooper et al., 2016), whereas incentive 
salience is more strongly related to whether people drink or not, consistent with theory on 
cue-induced drinking (Cofresí et al., 2019).

Loss of control/executive functioning, as measured in the current study, was unrelated 
to drinking outcomes in the multinomial logistic regression models, which is consistent 
with prior ANA work that did not identify associations between executive functioning and 
drinking outcomes (Nieto et al., 2021). Loss of control/executive functioning did have an 
effect in the binary logistic models with non-recovery groups (profiles 1 and 2 combined) 
compared to the high functioning heavy drinking profile (profile 3), such that those with 
more control and less impaired executive function were more likely to be in the high 
functioning heavy drinking recovery profile, which is consistent with prior work showing 
those with non-abstinent recovery are more likely to be higher in trait self-control (Stein et 
al., 2019).

The current study also identified many predictors of the addiction cycle domains. Consistent 
with prior work examining the ANA, sex, age, race, and AUD symptoms were associated 
with the domains (Kwako et al., 2019; Nieto et al., 2021). The current study also found 
that addiction cycle domains were not measured consistently by age, race, education, and 
AUD symptoms. Interestingly, females scored higher on all domains than males, which may 
reflect greater severity among women who seek treatment for AUD (McCrady et al., 2020).

Limitations

This study has several limitations. The COMBINE and MATCH studies were conducted 
decades ago with predominantly non-Hispanic and White men, thus resulting in limited 
generalizability to other racial and ethnic groups, as well as diverse gender groups. 
Additionally, COMBINE and MATCH were not designed to accomplish the aims of the 
current study, and there are differences in measures used across studies and lack of 
coverage of the constructs of the addiction cycle and AARDoC, particularly with respect to 
neuropsychological and behavioral measures. It would be important to replicate the current

findings in a more racially, ethnically, and gender diverse sample that met DSM-5 criteria 
for AUD. We were also limited by available measures for the addiction cycle domains 
and moderators of those domains. For example, prior work (Kwako et al., 2019) focused 
on general measures of executive function (e.g., impulsivity, urgency), while the current 
study used executive function indicators that specifically assessed control over drinking. The 
executive functioning domain had lower internal consistency and had the largest standard 
errors in models predicting recovery. Further limitations were the reduced sample size for 
the three-year follow-up and small effect sizes.

Clinical Implications and Conclusions

There are several clinical implications of the current study. Most notably, addiction 
cycle domains may have some clinical utility in predicting AUD treatment response and 
recovery outcomes. The addiction cycle constructs developed in the current study were 
more strongly associated with AUD treatment outcomes and long-term recovery than other 
measures clinicians might use to predict outcomes (e.g., AUD symptoms). The current 
study also extended recent research by identifying a smaller pool of items that might be 
useful for measuring addiction cycle domains in clinical practice. Future research should 
continue to develop and refine the items, particularly in the reward/incentive salience 
and executive functioning domains, and determine if domains improve during treatment, 
moderate response to specific interventions, and can inform precision medicine. For 
example, these findings suggest that interventions targeting relief/negative emotionality, 
such as mindfulness-based programs (Witkiewitz & Bowen, 2010) and acamprosate (Roos et 
al., 2017), may be particularly important for long term outcomes and should also be targeted 
as part of continuing care in recovery.

This study adds to the growing body of literature validating the addiction cycle domains 
and extending that literature by showing that items measuring the addiction cycle domains 
at treatment intake can be used to predict treatment outcomes and recovery up to three 
years following treatment. The current study also indicated substantial sociodemographic 
differences in measurement. These results highlight the importance of further measurement 
development to refine measures of the addiction cycle domains that might be consistently 
associated with neuroadaptations across the stages of addiction and sociodemographic 
groups.

Public Health Significance:

Addiction cycle domains of reward drinking/incentive salience, relief drinking/negative 
emotionality, and loss of control/executive functioning impairment identified from self-
report measures and based on a neurobiological model of alcohol use disorder may 
have clinical utility in predicting alcohol use disorder treatment response and recovery 
outcomes. Individuals who enter treatment with higher negative emotionality are more 
likely to return to heavier drinking in the first year following treatment and have poorer 
long-term functioning.

Factor loadings for addiction cycle domains (estimated in final MNLFA models for each 
domain, see Table 1) and standardized regression coefficients for significant paths with 
false discovery corrected p-value (p<.01) for sociodemographics predicting addiction cycle 
domains (estimated in a separate model with baseline predictors of observed MNLFA 
scores). Factor loadings from MNLFA models and main effects of covariates in predicting 
observed addiction cycle domain scores are presented in the same model below for heuristic
