Background

A B S T R A C T

Chronic pain is defined as pain lasting beyond normal tissue healing time, generally taken to be 12 weeks. It contributes to disability,
anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, and healthcare costs. Chronic pain has a weighted mean prevalence in adults
of 20%.

For many years, the treatment choice for chronic pain included recommendations for rest and inactivity. However, exercise may have
specific benefits in reducing the severity of chronic pain, as well as more general benefits associated with improved overall physical and
mental health, and physical functioning.

Physical activity and exercise programmes are increasingly being promoted and offered in various healthcare systems, and for a variety of
chronic pain conditions. It is therefore important at this stage to establish the efficacy and safety of these programmes, and furthermore
to address the critical factors that determine their success or failure.

Objectives

To provide an overview of Cochrane Reviews of adults with chronic pain to determine (1) the effectiveness of different physical activity and
exercise interventions in reducing pain severity and its impact on function, quality of life, and healthcare use; and (2) the evidence for any
adverse effects or harm associated with physical activity and exercise interventions.

Methods

We searched theCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) on the Cochrane Library (CDSR 2016, Issue 1) for systematic reviews of
randomised controlled trials (RCTs), after which we tracked any included reviews for updates, and tracked protocols in case of full review
publication until an arbitrary cut-off date of 21 March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3). We assessed the methodological quality of the reviews
using the AMSTAR tool, and also planned to analyse data for each painful condition based on quality of the evidence.

We extracted data for (1) self-reported pain severity, (2) physical function (objectively or subjectively measured), (3) psychological function,
(4) quality of life, (5) adherence to the prescribed intervention, (6) healthcare use/attendance, (7) adverse events, and (8) death.

Due to the limited data available, we were unable to directly compare and analyse interventions, and have instead reported the evidence
qualitatively.

Main results

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We included 21 reviews with 381 included studies and 37,143 participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) examined exercise
versus no exercise/minimal intervention in adults with chronic pain and were used in the qualitative analysis.

Pain  conditions  included  rheumatoid  arthritis,  osteoarthritis,  fibromyalgia,  low  back  pain,  intermittent  claudication,  dysmenorrhoea,
mechanical neck disorder, spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and patellofemoral pain. None of the reviews assessed 'chronic pain'
or 'chronic widespread pain' as a general term or specific condition. Interventions included aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion,
and core or balance training programmes, as well as yoga, Pilates, and tai chi.

Reviews were well performed and reported (based on AMSTAR), and included studies had acceptable risk of bias (with inadequate reporting
of attrition and reporting biases). However the quality of evidence was low due to participant numbers (most included studies had fewer
than 50 participants in total), length of intervention and follow-up (rarely assessed beyond three to six months). We pooled the results
from relevant reviews where appropriate, though results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence.

Pain severity: several reviews noted favourable results from exercise: only three reviews that reported pain severity found no statistically
significant changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention. However, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow-up,
as exercise did not consistently bring about a change (positive or negative) in self-reported pain scores at any single point.

Physical function: was the most commonly reported outcome measure. Physical function was significantly improved as a result of the
intervention in 14 reviews, though even these statistically significant results had only small-to-moderate effect sizes (only one review
reported large effect sizes).

Psychological function and quality of life: had variable results: results were either favourable to exercise (generally small and moderate
effect size, with two reviews reporting significant, large effect sizes for quality of life), or showed no difference between groups. There were
no negative effects.

Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed in any review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was slightly higher
in the exercising group (82.8/1000 participants versus 81/1000 participants), though the group difference was non-significant.

Healthcare use/attendance: was not reported in any review.

Adverse events, potential harm, and death: only 25% of included studies (across 18 reviews) actively reported adverse events. Based on
the available evidence, most adverse events were increased soreness or muscle pain, which reportedly subsided after a few weeks of the
intervention. Only one review reported death separately to other adverse events: the intervention was protective against death (based on
the available evidence), though did not reach statistical significance.

Authors' conclusions

The quality of the evidence examining physical activity and exercise for chronic pain is low. This is largely due to small sample sizes and
potentially underpowered studies. A number of studies had adequately long interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to less than
one year in all but six reviews.

There were some favourable effects in reduction in pain severity and improved physical function, though these were mostly of small-to-
moderate effect, and were not consistent across the reviews. There were variable effects for psychological function and quality of life.

The available evidence suggests physical activity and exercise is an intervention with few adverse events that may improve pain severity
and physical function, and consequent quality of life. However, further research is required and should focus on increasing participant
numbers, including participants with a broader spectrum of pain severity, and lengthening both the intervention itself, and the follow-
up period.

Physical activity and exercise for chronic pain in adults - an overview of Cochrane Reviews

Background

Chronic (long-term) pain is pain that has lasted beyond the body's usual healing time. It is often described as pain that has lasted for at least
three months. Chronic pain causes many problems, beyond the pain itself, including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and a poor quality of life.

In the past, people with chronic pain were told to rest. However, general advice now is to keep active - whether to affect the pain directly
or to combat the other problems associated with it. Therefore, research studies have attempted to examine the effect of physical activity
in people with chronic pain.

This overview aimed to bring together and analyse any reviews published by Cochrane that looked at physical activity and exercise studies
in any chronic pain condition, including arthritis, back and neck pain, and menstrual (period) pain.

Key results and quality of the evidence

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

In January 2016, we identified 21 Cochrane Reviews which covered 10 different diagnoses (osteoarthritis (a joint disease), rheumatoid
arthritis (joint pain and swelling), fibromyalgia (widespread pain condition), low back pain, intermittent claudication (cramping pain in the
legs), dysmenorrhoea (period pain), mechanical neck disorders (neck pain), spinal cord injury, postpolio syndrome (a condition occurring
in people who have had polio), patellofemoral pain (pain at the front of the knee)). The physical activity or exercise programme used in the
trials ranged in frequency, intensity, and type, including land- and water-based activities, those focusing on building strength, endurance,
flexibility and range of motion, and muscle activation exercises.

The quality of the evidence was low. This was mostly due to the small numbers of people with chronic pain who participated in each
reviewed study. Ideally, a study should have hundreds of people assigned to each group, whereas most of the studies included in the review
process here had fewer than 50 people in total.

There  was  evidence  that  physical  activity  reduced  the  severity  of  pain,  improved  physical  function,  and  had  a  variable  effect  on  both
psychological function and quality of life. However, these results were not found in all studies. The inconsistency could be due to the quality
of the studies or because of the mix of different types of physical activity tested in the studies. Additionally, participants had predominantly
mild-to-moderate pain, not moderate-to-severe pain.

Conclusions

According to the available evidence (only 25% of included studies reported on possible harm or injury from the intervention), physical
activity did not cause harm. Muscle soreness that sometimes occurs with starting a new exercise subsided as the participants adapted to
the new activities. This is important as it shows physical activity in general is acceptable and unlikely to cause harm in people with chronic
pain, many of whom may have previously feared it would increase their pain further.

Future studies should focus on increasing participant numbers, including a wider range of severity of pain (more people with more severe
pain), and lengthening both the intervention (exercise programme) itself, and the follow-up period. This pain is chronic in nature, and so
a long-term intervention, with longer periods of recovery or follow-up, may be more effective.

Description of the condition

Chronic  pain  has  been  defined  as  pain  lasting  beyond  normal
tissue healing time, generally taken to be 12 weeks (International
Association  for  the  Study  of  Chronic  Pain;  Merskey  2011).
It  contributes  to  disability,  anxiety  and  depression,  sleep
disturbances,  poor  quality  of  life,  and  healthcare  costs  (Leadley
2014; Moore 2014a; Park 2012).

Chronic  pain  has  a  weighted  mean  prevalence  in  adults  of  20%
(Breivik  2006;  Moore  2014a),  which  increases  as  the  population
ages  (32%  of  adults  aged  25  to  34  years,  62%  of  adults  over  75
years; Abdulla 2013; Elliott 1999). This is a greater proportion than
people with asthma (To 2012) or diabetes (IDF 2012) in the same
population  (van  Hecke  2013a).  The  World  Health  Organization
(WHO)  recognises  chronic  pain  as  a  public  health  problem
throughout  the  world,  with  one  systematic  review  assessing  the
growing evidence that the prevalence of chronic pain in the general
population  is  high  internationally  (34%  in  low-income  countries
and 30% in high-income countries; Elzahaf 2012). Chronic painful
conditions comprise four of the 10 highest ranking conditions for
years lived with disability in 2013 (Vos 2015), and are responsible for
considerable loss of quality of life and employment, and increased
healthcare  costs  (Moore  2014b).  Despite  this,  the  term  'chronic
pain' was only added as a MeSH term in MEDLINE in January 2012
(National  Library  of  Medicine),  highlighting  the  relatively  small
proportion of specific research dedicated to this population.

Certain  factors  can  contribute  to  an  increased  risk  of  chronic
pain  (female  gender,  older  age,  lower  socioeconomic  status,
geographical and cultural background, and genetics; Smith 2007;
van  Hecke  2013b).  Other  factors  associated  with  chronic  pain
conditions  are  modifiable,  such  as  smoking  status,  alcohol
intake,  nutrition,  obesity,  comorbidities,  employment  status  and
occupational  factors,  and  physical  activity  level  (Smith  2007;  van
Hecke 2013a).

A  review  of  current  issues  in  the  treatment  of  chronic  pain
strongly  suggests  that  health  professionals  traditionally  focus
on  biomedical  views  of  pain,  utilising  pharmacology 
first
and  foremost,  and  sometimes  not  addressing  potential  non-
pharmacological  approaches  such  as  physical  activity  and
changing  attitudes  towards  chronic  pain  (Schofield  2011).
Guidance  often  suggests  that  lifestyle  advice  is  important:  for
example,  the  National  Institute  for  Health  and  Care  Excellence
(NICE)  osteoarthritis  guidelines  state  that  "exercise  should  be  a
core  treatment  ...  irrespective  of  age,  comorbidity,  pain  severity
and disability. Exercise should include: local muscle strengthening
[and] general aerobic fitness" (NICE 2014).

treatments  have  been  developed,
Non-pharmacological 
investigated,  and  implemented,  with  Cochrane  Reviews  and
protocols  evaluating  the  available  evidence  for  psychological,
physical,  and  other  non-medical  interventions  (e.g.  cognitive
behavioural  and  behavioural  therapy,  Eccleston  2014;  Williams
2012;  TENS,  Nnoaham  2008;  low-impact/intensity  movement/
exercise therapy, Wieland 2013; dietary, Straube 2015; and patient
education,  Engers  2008;  Gross  2009).  While  evidence  for  the
effectiveness  of  these  interventions  is  of  variable  quantity  and
quality, the 2013 Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN)
guidelines  on  the  management  of  chronic  pain  made  strong

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

recommendations on the use of exercise, based on evidence drawn
from  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  stating:  "exercise  and
exercise  therapies,  regardless  of  their  form,  are  recommended  in
the management of patients with chronic pain" (SIGN 2013).

Description of the interventions

Physical  activity  has  been  defined  by  the  WHO  as  "any
bodily  movement  produced  by  skeletal  muscles  that  requires
energy expenditure, including activities undertaken while working,
playing,  carrying  out  household  chores,  travelling,  and  engaging
in  recreational  pursuits"  (WHO  2015).  WHO  also  states  that
"exercise ... is a sub-category of physical activity that is planned,
structured, repetitive, and aims to improve or maintain one or more
components of physical fitness" (WHO 2015).

Physical  activity  for  health  can  take  many  different  forms:  it  can
be  structured  exercise,  such  as  in  classes,  gym-based,  or  a  DVD
or  programme  performed  at  home;  or  unstructured  and  involve
adding just a few small activities each day (activities of daily living).
Physical activity and exercise can also vary in intensity, duration,
and type: aerobic (such as walking) or more focused on increasing
flexibility, strength, or balance. Physical activity and exercise can
also  be  taught  (or  led)  by  another  individual  such  as  an  exercise
professional, or initiated and maintained through the person's own
initiative and motivation.

Both physical activity and exercise can be performed on land or in
the water, and can range from whole-body to localised (body site-
specific)  training.  Most  forms  of  exercise  can  also  be  modified  to
be performed where there is restricted movement (e.g. in a chair, a
bed, or another assistive device).

How the intervention might work

Physical activity and exercise can be adapted for an individual, and
is  something  people  can  do  to  help  themselves.  It  is  likely  to  be
associated with minimal adverse effects, such as interactions with
medication  and  potential  for  abuse  in  adults  with  chronic  pain,
when compared to pharmaceutical and surgical interventions. It is
therefore an attractive option to help manage an individual's pain
if the systematic reviews show benefit. However, current evidence
suggests  that  simply  giving  an  individual  advice  to  exercise
is  insufficient  to  bring  about  significant  change  (SIGN  2013),
and  a  badly  prescribed  intervention  that  does  not  consider  the
individual's conditions and present state of health and fitness, such
as  one  that  does  not  incorporate  pacing  or  gradual  progression,
may bring about adverse events such as pain 'flare-ups', or lead to
cardiac or respiratory events (American College of Sports Medicine
2007).  This  suggests  that  supervised  or  structured  interventions
may be more fruitful, though this is currently unconfirmed.

Since  the  1980s,  primary  care  physician  advice  for  treating
pain  has  changed,  moving  away  from  "rest",  to  minimising  or
eliminating  bedrest  and  instead  remaining  active  (back  pain,
Waddell  1987).  Exercise  may  have  specific  benefits  in  reducing
the  severity  of  chronic  pain,  as  well  as  more  general  benefits
associated with improved overall physical and mental health, and
physical  functioning  of  people  with  chronic  pain,  as  depression
(Finan  2013),  deconditioning  (Bousema  2007),  and  obesity  are
commonly  observed  in  these  people  (headache/migraine,  Bigal
2012;  fibromyalgia,  Ursini  2011).  For  example,  studies  have
revealed that a single bout of exercise increases the production of

endogenous opioids, leading to transient anti-nociception in both
animals and humans, and repeated exercise produces long-lasting
anti-nociception  in  otherwise  untreated  animals  (Stagg  2011).
Aerobic  exercise  is  also  strongly  linked  to  weight  loss  (Messier
2013),  which  in  turn  has  implications  for  the  management  of
chronic  pain  as  the  pressure  on  joints  is  reduced.  Alternatively,
resistance exercise, or other forms of strength training, can improve
the  person's  capacity  to  support  bone  and  cartilage  through
improved musculature supporting movement around a joint, with
potential to relieve stiffness (Mayer 2008) and bringing about some
pain  relief.  Resistance  training  through  repetitive  full  range-of-
motion  exercise  around  the  lumbar  spine  (in  chronic  low  back
pain)  may  affect  disc  metabolism  itself,  with  the  possibility  that
the exercise programme could improve metabolic exchange in the
lumbar discs and aid in repair (Mooney 2006). Training to improve
balance and flexibility also has benefits as it reduces the risk of falls,
and the potential for further pain or injury (Harvard 2013).

Why it is important to do this overview

If  physical  activity  and  exercise  interventions  are  shown  to
effectively and safely reduce pain intensity or frequency (or both),
they  are  likely  to  be  a  preferable  alternative  or  adjunct  therapy
to  pharmacological/surgical  treatments  for  chronic  pain.  The
interventions could promote personal involvement of individuals
in  the  management  of  their  pain,  thus  increasing  self-efficacy
and  the  ability  to  self-manage.  In  turn  this  could  lead  to  an
increase  in  overall  quality  of  life  and  a  consequent  reduction  in
healthcare  use.  In  addition,  exercise  is  of  great  importance  for
cardiovascular  (Vigorito  2014)  and  bone  health  (Sakuma  2012).
Reduced  physical  function  and  consequent  lack  of  mobility  in
people with chronic pain is associated with increased all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality (Nüesch 2011), with other studies linking
severe chronic pain to general increased all-cause mortality (Moore
2014a; Torrance 2010).

Physical activity and exercise programmes are increasingly being
promoted  and  offered  in  various  healthcare  systems  (American
College  of  Sports  Medicine  (ACSM)  'Exercise  is  Medicine'  global
pledge  at  the  Inaugural  World  Congress  2010)  and  for  a  variety
of chronic pain conditions, including arthritis (Fransen 2014; Silva
2010),  fibromyalgia  (Busch  2013),  and  dysmenorrhoea  (Brown
2010).  At  this  stage  it  is  important  to  establish  the  efficacy  and
safety of these programmes, and furthermore to address the critical
factors that determine their success or failure.

It  is  therefore  important  to  identify  whether  (and  how)  exercise
interventions can be effectively and safely applied in people with
chronic pain.

With  a  number  of  systematic  reviews  published  by  Cochrane
evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  exercise 
in  various  painful
conditions, it is timely and important to bring together all relevant
published  information  to  evaluate  the  current  evidence,  and
identify  the  availability  and  quality  of  evidence-based  exercise
interventions.  This  overview  will  determine  the  extent  to  which
the  published  systematic  reviews  have  accurately  assessed  the
evidence for exercise in chronic pain conditions/syndromes, which
will help to direct future guidelines and identify current research
gaps.

Criteria for considering reviews for inclusion

We  included  only  systematic  reviews  of  RCTs  of  physical  activity
and  exercise  in  participants  with  chronic  pain,  and  published  in
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The included reviews
had to fulfil the following criteria:

Participants

Adults (aged 18 years and over) reporting chronic non-cancer pain,
including  persistent  (e.g.  chronic  back  pain,  fibromyalgia)  and
intermittent (e.g. migraine, dysmenorrhoea) pain, for at least three
months (12 weeks) in any body site.

Intervention

Reviews  of  RCTs  assessing  physical  activity  or  exercise  as  the
intervention  (any  reviews  where  that  assessed  physical  activity
or exercise as a stand-alone intervention). This included physical
activity interventions that could be initially taught by an exercise
professional, or involve periodical/ongoing supervision.

Exclusions

Interventions  not  deemed  physical  activity  or  exercise  using  the
WHO  definition,  such  as  manipulation,  mobilisation,  or  passive
movement.  Any  multi-modal  interventions  were  excluded  if
physical activity/exercise could not be assessed for effect (the effect
of exercise must have been measured distinctly).

Comparison

Usual  care,  waiting  list  control,  placebo/sham  treatment,  other
treatment, or a combination of treatments (as long as the effect of
exercise could be measured distinctly).

Primary outcome

• self-reported pain (severity).

This could be presented and analysed as change on a continuous
scale,  the  proportion  of  participants  who  'responded',  or,  ideally,
in a dichotomised format as the proportion of participants in each
group  who  achieved  a  predetermined  threshold  of  improvement
(e.g.  outcome  in  individual  participants  of  at  least  50%  pain
intensity reduction, or no worse than mild pain, at the end of the
trial,  with  at  least  30%  pain  intensity  reduction  as  a  secondary
outcome, or recovery; Moore 2013).

Secondary outcomes

• Physical function (objectively or subjectively measured).
• Psychological function.
• Quality of life.
• Adherence to the prescribed intervention.

• Healthcare use/attendance.
• Adverse events (not death).
• Death.

Reviews  may  not  always  report  specifically  on  activity  or
exercise  for  chronic  pain  in  adults.  We  anticipated  two  possible
circumstances which might have arisen.

• A  review  included  some  interventions  of  interest  or  reported
only  some  outcomes  of  interest.  In  this  case  we  extracted  the
interventions and outcomes of interest, but we did not include
interventions or outcomes outside the scope of this overview.
• Reviews  occasionally  included  papers  that  included  children
and adults together, but the results for adults were not reported
or analysed separately in the included papers or the review. In
this case we made a judgement as to whether the review could
be  included  based  on  the  proportion  of  adults.  Our  intention
was  to  include  only  those  reviews  where  more  than  80%  of
participants were adults.

Search methods for identification of reviews

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR),
2016, Issue 1, on the Cochrane Library for relevant reviews using
the search strategy: (pain or migraine or headache) and (exercise or
activity or physical). We did not seek non-Cochrane reviews.

Data collection and analysis

Two overview authors (LG, CC) independently carried out searches
and  selected  reviews  for  inclusion.  Disagreements  were  resolved
through  discussion,  and  a  third  overview  author  (RAM)  acted  as
arbitrator where necessary.

Two  overview  authors  (independently  carried  out  assessment  of
methodological quality (LG, CC), and extracted data (LG, RAM). Any
disagreements  were  resolved  through  discussion,  or  involving  a
third overview author if necessary (DM).

One overview author (LG) tracked results of the search for the most
up  to  date  version  of  each  review  and  protocol  that  fulfilled  the
inclusion criteria.

Selection of reviews

Included  reviews  assessed  RCTs  of  the  effects  of  exercise  for
pain  management  in  adults  (as  defined  by  individual  reviews),
compared with any of the listed comparators, and included:

• a clearly defined clinical question;
• details of inclusion and exclusion criteria;
• details of databases searched and relevant search strategies;
• participant-reported pain severity (primary outcome measure);
• summary results for at least one other desired outcome.

Data extraction and management

Two overview authors (LG, RAM) independently extracted data from
the  included  review  using  a  standardised  data  extraction  form
and checked for agreement prior to entry into Microsoft Excel for
Windows.  We  did  not  extract  data  from  reports  included  in  the
reviews  again,  neither  did  we  undertake  any  re-analysis  of  data
from reviews. Data were not entered for analysis into Cochrane's

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

statistical software due to the lack of relevant and comparable data
(RevMan 2014).

We collected the following information (where available) from the
reviews:

• number of included studies and participants;
• intervention  (exercise  or  activity  type)  and  dose  (frequency/

intensity);
• comparator;
• condition treated;
• time of assessment;
• duration of follow-up;
• relevant outcomes.

Where  possible  we  extracted  risk  ratio  (RR),  number  needed  to
treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB), mean difference
(MD), and standardised mean difference (SMD), and other relevant
statistical  data  for  the  primary  and  secondary  outcomes.  This
included:

• obtaining 50% pain relief (participant-reported);
• obtaining  any  other  measure  of  'improvement'  (participant-

reported);

• adverse events;
• death;
• withdrawals.

Assessment of methodological quality of included reviews

Quality of included reviews

Two  overview  authors  (LG,  CC)  independently  assessed  each
included  review  to  see  if  it  satisfied  the  criteria  specified
in  the  'assessment  of  multiple  systematic  reviews'  (AMSTAR)
measurement  tool  (Shea  2007),  for  rigorous  methodological
quality. Arbitration by a third overview author (DM) was necessary
for some fields.

High quality reviews were required to fulfil each of the established
AMSTAR criteria (further criteria to fulfil each field is listed in Table
1).

For  each  review  we  also  planned  to  assess  the  likelihood  of
publication  bias  by  calculating  the  number  of  participants  in
studies  with  zero  effect  (relative  benefit  of  one)  that  would  be
needed to give an NNTB too high to be clinically relevant (Moore
2008).  In  this  case  we  would  have  considered  an  NNTB  of  10  or
greater for the outcome of participant-reported pain relief of 30% or
greater to be the cut-off for clinical relevance. This method is used
as statistical tests for the presence of publication bias have been
shown  to  be  unhelpful  (Thornton  2000).  However,  assessment  of
publication bias was not possible due to the lack of specificity of the
populations included within the reviews, and so we were unable to
extract comparable data.

Quality of evidence in included reviews

We planned to use two main indicators for the quality of evidence:
all included reviews must have used only primary studies that were
both randomised and double-blind, so minimising the risk of bias
from these items; and all included reviews must have included only
people  with  at  least  moderate  pain  intensity  at  baseline  (visual

analogue scale greater than 30/100, categorical rating scale greater
than  1/3,  and  numerical  rating  scale  greater  than  3/10,  Collins
1997), providing a sensitive assay of intervention efficacy.

Subsequently,  we  planned  to  analyse  data  for  each  painful
condition in three tiers, according to outcome and freedom from
known sources of bias.

• The  first  tier  used  data  meeting  current  best  standards,
where  studies  reported  the  outcome  of  at  least  50%  pain
intensity  reduction  from  baseline  (where  50%  was  the  cut-off
for  a  dichotomous  (yes/no)  outcome:  was  a  50%  reduction
in  pain  observed?),  or  its  equivalent,  without  using  last
observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method
for dropouts, reported an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, lasted
eight  or  more  weeks,  had  a  parallel-group  design,  and  had  at
least 200 participants (preferably at least 400) in the comparison
(Moore 2010). These top-tier results were usually reported first.
• The second tier used any available data, but where one or more
of  these  conditions  were  not  met,  for  example  reporting  at
least 30% pain intensity reduction, using LOCF or a completer
analysis, lasting four to eight weeks, and where the numbers of
participants were at least 200.

• A third tier of evidence related to small amounts of data (fewer
than 200 participants), or short studies of less than four weeks,
or  where  there  was  obvious  major  heterogeneity  between
studies, or where there were other shortcomings in allocation
concealment,  considerable  attrition,  and  incomplete  outcome
data.  For  this  third  tier  of  evidence,  no  data  synthesis  was
reasonable, and may have been misleading, but an indication of
beneficial effects might be possible.

This  overview  examined  the  quality  of  all  included  reviews
according  to  current  best  standards  for  reporting  in  pain.  These
included the attempt and ability of the reviews to identify studies/
interventions  with  the  maximum  evidence  of  effectiveness,  and
minimum risk of bias, including the reporting of the following.

• Outcomes in trials of the proportion of participants obtaining at
least 50% pain intensity reduction, or no worse than mild pain,
at the end of the trial (with at least 30% pain intensity reduction
as a secondary outcome). We did not consider the use of mean
changes in pain scores as high quality because responses to pain
interventions are not Gaussian, and few people have the mean
response.

• Duration of included studies of eight weeks or longer.
• Imputation  method  of  baseline  observation  carried  forward
(BOCF),  LOCF,  or  worst  observation  carried  forward  (WOCF)  if
adverse  event  withdrawals  were  similar  in  active  and  control
groups.

• At  least  200  participants  per  treatment  group  in  included
studies,  with  at  least  two  trials,  as  a  minimum  criterion  for
trustworthiness of any analysis. Pooled analysis of small studies
may be considered good quality if at least 400 participants were
involved, but we regarded these as being potentially subject to
bias.

We extracted the 'Risk of bias' as assessed by the original review
authors  from  included  reviews.  Counts  of  low  risk  of  bias  were
extracted  from  relevant  studies  in  the  included  reviews  and
tabulated under the following headings to evaluate the proportion
of studies achieving a low risk of bias for each:

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

• random sequence generation (selection bias);
• allocation concealment (selection bias);
• blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias);
• blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias);
• incomplete outcome data (attrition bias);
• selective reporting (reporting bias);
• sample size;
• any other biases.

Data synthesis

Additional quantitative analyses were not required, since we only
considered  results  from  properly  conducted  (Cochrane)  reviews.
The  aim  was  to  concentrate  on  specific  outcomes  such  as  the
proportion  of  participants  with  at  least  50%  pain  relief,  all-cause
or adverse event discontinuations, or serious adverse events, and
to explore how these can be compared across different treatments
for the same condition. We planned to compare only like with like
(where possible); for example in study duration, which can be an
additional source of bias if insufficient in length (Moore 2010).

However  due  to  the  limited  data  available,  we  were  unable  to
directly  compare  and  analyse  interventions,  and  have  instead
reported  the  evidence  qualitatively  only.  We  had  also  planned
to  employ  subgroup  analyses  assessing  age,  condition,  and
intervention type/intensity, though this was not feasible using the
available data from included reviews. For this reason we have also
been unable to include a 'Summary of findings' table as planned
and stated in the protocol.

Importantly, we have tried to highlight issues of low trial quality,
inadequate  size,  and  whether  trials  were  truly  valid  for  the
particular condition in making between-therapy comparisons.

We approached each review with four main questions/focus, and
extracted data accordingly.

• Did they report exercise versus non-exercise studies?
• Did the review or studies included in the review (or both) have

low risk of bias?

• Did they have our main outcome?
• What were the actual intervention/s included in the review?

R E S U L T S

We included 21 reviews with 381 included studies, totalling 37,143
participants. Of these, 264 studies (19,642 participants) examined
exercise  versus  no  exercise/minimal  intervention  in  adults  with
chronic pain (the focus of this overview) and so were used in the
qualitative analysis.

Description of included reviews

The search strategy was performed in the Cochrane Library only,
and  revealed  475  potentially  relevant  titles,  of  which  75  were
assessed as full papers.

The search was undertaken on 31 January 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue
1), after which any included reviews were tracked for updates, and
protocols were followed in case of full review publication until 21
March 2016 (CDSR 2016, Issue 3).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

All  extracted  data  and  methodological  quality  assessment  were
taken from the most recent published version of the full review.

Ultimately,  of  the  75  titles  requiring  further  assessment,  10  were
reviews at protocol stage only (five of which have potential to be

included once published as a full review, one which was unclear,
and  four  that  were  excluded  based  on  information  within  the
protocol).  Hence,  we  excluded  54  titles  (10  protocols  and  44  full
reviews; Figure 1), reasons for which are listed in Table 2.

Specificity of chronic pain condition of included reviews

Following abstract and full paper assessment, 21 reviews fulfilled
the  inclusion  criteria:  four  in  rheumatoid  arthritis  (Cramp  2013;
Han  2004;  Hurkmans  2009;  Silva  2010),  four  in  osteoarthritis
(Bartels  2007;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Regnaux  2015),  three
in  fibromyalgia  (Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2007;  Busch  2013),  three
in  low  back  pain  (Hayden  2005;  Saragiotto  2016;  Yamato  2015),
two  in  intermittent  claudication  (Lane  2014;  Lauret  2014),  one  in
dysmenorrhoea  (Brown  2010),  one  in  mechanical  neck  disorder
(Gross  2015a),  one  in  spinal  cord  injury  (Boldt  2014),  one  in
postpolio  syndrome  (Koopman  2015),  and  one  in  patellofemoral
pain (van der Heijden 2015). None of the included reviews assessed
'chronic  pain'  or  'chronic  widespread  pain'  as  a  general  term  or
specific condition.

The 21 included reviews were published by five different Cochrane
Review  groups:  11  from  the  Cochrane  Musculoskeletal  Group
(Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013;
Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Han 2004; Hurkmans 2009; Regnaux
2015;  Silva  2010);  four  from  the  Cochrane  Neck  and  Back  Group
previously the Cochrane Back Group) (Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005;
Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015); two from the Cochrane Peripheral
Vascular  Diseases  Group  (Lane  2014;  Lauret  2014);  one  from  the
Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (Brown 2010);
one from the Cochrane Injuries Group (Boldt 2014); one from the
Cochrane  Neuromuscular  Group  (Koopman  2015);  and  one  from
the  Cochrane  Bone,  Joint  and  Muscle  Trauma  Group  (van  der
Heijden 2015).

Protocols that may be included in updates of this overview focus
on osteoarthritis (Østerås 2013 from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal
Group), migraine (Brønfort 2015 from the Cochrane Pain, Palliative
and  Supportive  Care  Group),  chronic  low  back  pain  (Hayden
2012  from  the  Cochrane  Back  Group),  ankylosing  spondylitis
(Regnaux  2014  from  the  Cochrane  Musculoskeletal  Group),  and
temporomandibular  disorders  (Craane  2006  from  the  Cochrane
Oral Health Group).

Exercise and physical activity interventions implemented in
the included reviews

Interventions assessed included: any specified style of land-based
exercise  or  physical  activity  such  as  one  designed  to  improve
strength, range of movement, aerobic capacity, or a combination
of these (Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Fransen
2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015;
Regnaux 2015; van der Heijden 2015); a single style of land-based
exercise  only  (tai  chi  only:  Han  2004,  walking  only:  Lauret  2014,
walking or jogging only: Brown 2010; Lane 2014, balance training
only:  Silva  2010,  motor  control  exercise  only:  Saragiotto  2016,
Pilates  method  only:  Yamato  2015);  any  pool-based  or  aquatic
therapy (Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Cramp 2013), or "any exercise
therapy" (Hayden 2005).

Aquatic exercise

Any  exercise  performed  in  water.  This  can  include  swimming,
though  many  studies  will  be  referring  to  exercises  performed
vertically in the water (not horizontally), either using the water to

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

support the body through the exercise, or as resistance against the
body.

Range of motion and flexibility exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. The intention is to increase
the range of motion around a joint through progressive stretching
and mobilising of the muscles around and crossing the joint. For
the purposes of this overview, we only included active movement
where  the  movement  was  brought  about  by  the  participant,  and
not passively moved by an external force such as a therapist.

Aerobic exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise usually performed
continuously  to  raise  the  heart  rate  and  breathing  rate  for  a
prolonged  period.  Examples  include  walking,  jogging,  running,
cycling,  and  swimming.  Often  presented  as  a  percentage  of  the
participant's  heart  rate  max  (HRmax)  -  the  highest  heart  rate
reached  when  performing  at  their  absolute  maximum.  Similarly
it  may  be  presented  as  a  percentage  of  VO2max  or  VO2peak  (a
proportion of the maximum amount of oxygen the muscle can take
up per minute), or as an absolute value (mL/kg/minute).

Strength/resistance exercise

Can be performed in water or on land. Exercise performed against
a  progressive  resistance  with  the  intention  of  improving  muscle
strength,  muscle  endurance,  muscle  power,  or  a  combination  of
these.  Resistance  can  come  from  fixed  or  free  weights,  elastic
bands, body weight (against gravity), and water resistance. It may
also  involve  static  or  isometric  strength  (holding  a  position  or
weight without moving against it). Often presented as a percentage
of the participant's one repetition maximum (1-RM) - the maximum
weight they can lift/move if they only have to do it once.

Motor control exercise

Can  be  performed  in  water  or  on  land.  Exercise  to  bring  about
activation of the deep trunk muscles, targeting the restoration of
control and co-ordination of these 'core muscles' (Saragiotto 2016).

Balance (proprioceptive) training

Can be performed in water or on land (water may be used initially
for  support).  Exercise  emphasises  the  maintenance  of  balance
during visual and perturbation challenges with eyes open or closed,
range  of  motion,  and  maintaining  stability  over  reduced  areas  of
support and unstable surface (Silva 2010), that is improving balance
in increasingly unstable situations.

Tai chi

An  ancient  Chinese  discipline  developed  from  martial  arts,
involving a continuous series of very controlled (and usually slow)
movements designed to improve physical and mental wellbeing.

Yoga

Arising out of Hindu philosophy. Exercise includes breath control,
simple  meditation,  and  the  adoption  of  specific  bodily  postures.
It is widely practised for health, relaxation, and control (physically
and  mentally).  Incorporates  stretching  and  flexibility  training
with  isometric  strength  training  (holding  certain  poses,  with  no
movement against a resistance).

Pilates

Developed  by  Joseph  Pilates  in  the  20th  Century,  it  is  a  system
of  exercises  (often  using  special  apparatus)  designed  to  improve
physical  strength,  flexibility,  and  posture,  and  enhance  mental
awareness.

Duration and dose (frequency/intensity) of the exercise and
physical activity interventions

chronic pain when compared to inactivity? Two of the 21 reviews
did not include/locate any studies that examined simply exercise
versus no exercise (Lauret 2014; Silva 2010). However, many of the
included  reviews  compared  varying  exercise  modality,  duration,
intensity, and frequency. The "no-exercise" intervention referred to
the control group where there was a minimal intervention (such as
sham exercise or education) or wait-list control/no treatment (see
Table 3 for more information on control group activity).

A detailed breakdown of each review can be seen in Table 5.

Time points reported

Duration of intervention

Interventions  assessed  by  the  included  reviews  varied  in  length
from a single session (Fransen 2015) to 30 months (Fransen 2015).
Only  five  reviews  enforced  a  minimum  intervention  period  to
reduce  risk  of  bias,  and  were  able  to  attribute  any  effects  to  the
intervention  (Brown  2010;  Busch  2013;  Gross  2015a;  Hurkmans
2009; Silva 2010).

Frequency

There  was  large  variation  in  the  exercise  or  physical  activity
intervention  being  implemented,  ranging  from  just  once  a  week
(Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2007;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Han
2004;  Saragiotto  2016),  to  twice  a  day  (Boldt  2014),  and  some
performing a short series of exercises (two-minute duration) every
15 minutes during the day (Gross 2015a). However, when reported,
most included studies in the reviews implemented the programme
twice a week (or stated at least twice a week).

Intensity

Few  studies  quantified  the  intensity  of  each  session.  Baseline
intensity  was  often  accepted  as  low/moderate,  with  the  aim  to
progress  over  the  intervention  period  to  70%  to  85%  of  HRmax
or heart rate reserve (HRR) for aerobic interventions (Brown 2010;
Cramp  2013;  Hurkmans  2009),  70%  to  80%  of  an  individual's  1-
RM,  or  50%  to  70%  maximum  voluntary  contraction  (Koopman
2015)  in  strength/resistance  training  programmes  (Busch  2013;
Hurkmans  2009).  In  other  reviews,  intensity  was  described  more
loosely  as  "variable"  or  "low  intensity  (very  light)  to  maximum
effort (vigorous)" (Bidonde 2014; Fransen 2014; Lane 2014; Regnaux
2015), "low intensity" (Fransen 2014; Gross 2015a; Han 2004; Silva
2010),  or  "moderate  or  moderate-to-high"  (Cramp  2013;  Fransen
2015).

Duration (per session)

Individual  sessions  varied  in  length  from  two  minutes  (Gross
2015a), to 90 minutes (Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Han 2004) or 120
minutes (Boldt 2014), but mostly situated around 45 to 60 minutes.
However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  shorter  sessions  were
often  performed  more  regularly  than  longer  sessions.  With  more
information it would have been possible to calculate total volume
of  exercise  or  physical  activity  (session  duration  ×  frequency  per
week  ×  number  of  weeks),  for  a  more  accurate  and  detailed
analysis.

Intervention specificity for chronic pain in the included
reviews

The  focus  of  this  overview  was  exercise  versus  no-exercise
interventions with the intention of answering the original question:
is  exercise  beneficial,  detrimental,  or  ineffective  for  people  with

Four  of  the  19  reviews  that  reported  data,  reported  results  at  a
single  time  point  only  ('post-intervention':  Bidonde  2014;  Busch
2007;  Cramp  2013;  Han  2004).  Reviews  also  analysed  outcome
measures  immediately  post-intervention  and  at  one  or  more
follow-up  points.  Each  review  defined  short-,  intermediate-,  and
long-term follow-up according to their own assessment, so when
the  time  period  was  not  mentioned  explicitly,  we  grouped  the
reviews  according  to  the  review  authors'  own  classification  only,
and  where  a  time  period  (weeks,  month,  years)  was  explicitly
listed but not defined by the authors, we grouped them as short-
term  (follow-up  as  under  six  months),  intermediate-term  (six  to
12  months),  and  long-term  (longer  than  12  months):  short-term:
Busch  2013;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Gross  2015a;  Hayden
2005;  Lane  2014;  Regnaux  2015;  Saragiotto  2016;  intermediate-
term: Bartels 2007; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Lane
2014;  Regnaux  2015;  Saragiotto  2016;  long-term:  Gross  2015a;
Hayden 2005; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016. Five reviews did not
report  "post-intervention"  but  at  short-term,  mid/intermediate-
term, and long-term postrandomisation (short, mid, and long term:
Boldt 2014; short and intermediate term: Koopman 2015; Yamato
2015; short and long-term: Hurkmans 2009; van der Heijden 2015).
One review assessed participants in an ongoing fashion "over three
menstrual cycles" (Brown 2010).

Long-term follow-up

Of the seven reviews claiming to report "long term" follow-up, one
classed long-term as longer than six weeks (intermediate term as
one to six weeks' follow-up) (Boldt 2014). The remaining six reviews
defined  long-term  follow  up  as  over  12  months  (one  year)  post-
intervention (Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Hurkmans 2009; Regnaux
2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden 2015).

Methodological quality of included reviews

AMSTAR quality assessment of included reviews

No review achieved a perfect score of 11/11, though five achieved
10/11  (Boldt  2014;  Busch  2013;  Hayden  2005;  Koopman  2015;
Regnaux  2015)  and  eight  scored  9/11  (Cramp  2013;  Gross  2015a;
Hurkmans 2009; Lane 2014; Lauret 2014; Saragiotto 2016; van der
Heijden 2015; Yamato 2015). The lowest score was 6/11 (Silva 2010)
though five categories were not applicable (n/a) due to there being
no included studies. Quality assessment results for each individual
review are presented in Table 6.

All  reviews  except  one  (Bidonde  2014)  fulfilled  the  basic  criteria
(questions  one  to  three  of  Table  1);  to  follow  an  'a  priori'  design
as Cochrane implements a system of protocol publication before
undertaking  the  full  reviews,  where  it  also  specifies  dual  study
selection  and  data  extraction  from  a  comprehensive  literature
search.  One  review  did  not  fulfil  the  'a  priori'  design  as  this  was
an update and separation from a broader review series, and so the

criteria  had  not  been  explicitly  listed  prior  to  publication  for  this
specific title (Bidonde 2014).

Criteria  which  scored  badly  using  the  AMSTAR  tool  were
characteristics  of  included  studies  (question  six  of  Table  1),
reporting of publication bias (question 10 of Table 1), and conflict
of interest declarations (question 11 of Table 1).

• Included study characteristics were limited, often reporting the
"inclusion  criteria"  used  to  recruit  participants  in  the  study
instead  of  the  characteristics  of  actual  included  participants,
and  excluding  information  such  as  participants'  age,  gender
split, ethnicity, and disease status.

• Assessment  of  publication  bias  was  omitted  entirely  in  five
reviews  (Bartels  2007;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Han  2004;
Hurkmans  2009),  and  when  it  was  assessed,  it  was  reported

used,  or  diagrams  to  demonstrate  the  result;  Busch  2007;
Koopman  2015).  Two  reviews  mentioned  in  the  methods  as
planned  analyses,  though  was  not  mentioned  again  (Brown
2010;  van  der  Heijden  2015),  and  a  third  review  mentioned  it
in  the  methods,  but  appeared  to  use  it  interchangeably  with
reporting bias causing great confusion (Bidonde 2014).

• Conflicts  of  interest  were  sufficiently  reported  in  only  three
out  of  21  of  the  included  reviews  (Hayden  2005;  Koopman
2015; Silva 2010). In the remaining reviews, a cursory statement
was commonly made regarding the review authors' conflicts of
interests, however, fulfilling the AMSTAR criteria also requires a
statement to be made regarding any conflict of interest for any
of the included studies.

Risk of bias in included reviews

The original review authors assessed risk of bias (see Table 7). The
table shows the number of studies assessed as low risk of bias only,
and excluded those that were assessed as unclear or high risk of
bias.

Selection bias (randomisation and allocation concealment)

Selection bias had the largest proportion of included studies with
low risk of bias (63% and 42% of studies adequately undertaking
and reporting the methods used).

Performance and detection bias (blinding participants,
personnel, outcome assessors)

With any exercise or physical activity intervention it is very difficult
to blind both participants and personnel to the allocation, though
some  studies  included  in  reviews  attempted  to  by  offering  sham
exercise.

Due  to  the  difficulty  of  blinding  participants  to  their  group
allocation,  review  authors  assessed  the  risk  of  bias  in  different
ways, which may cause confusion: whereas the majority declared
this  lack  of  possible  blinding  to  be  high  risk  of  bias  or  unclear,
two reviews labelled such cases as low risk of bias in order not to
exclude these studies unnecessarily from their analysis (Lane 2014;
Lauret 2014). Without these two reviews, only a small percentage
(7.8% or 18/229) of the included studies would have scored low risk
of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), but by
including them (all 35 studies from those two reviews assessed as
low risk of bias) the overall proportion of studies assessed as having
low risk of bias was closer to 20% (53/264).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Attrition (incomplete outcome data, withdrawals/dropouts)

About  55%  (144/264)  of  the  studies  included  in  these  reviews
showed low risk of bias.

Reporting bias (selective reporting)

Reporting  bias  was  classed  as  low  risk  in  only  46%  of  included
studies.  However,  it  is  important  to  note  this  was  not  due  to  the
remainder  having  high  risk  of  bias,  but  instead  'unclear',  as  trial
protocols  were  not  always  published  or  accessible  to  the  review
authors to accurately assess/interpret.

Study/sample/group size

Sample  size  was  not  always  included  within  the  risk  of  bias
assessment. It was therefore extracted directly from each review's
table of included study characteristics by a single overview author
(LG),  and  assessed  as  being  low  risk  of  bias  when  there  was  a
minimum of 50 participants per arm, or 100 in total. Numbers were
then separated for the proportion of studies with greater than 100
participants per arm (or 200 in total), and 200 participants per arm
(or  400  in  total),  as  this  could  then  be  considered  higher  tiered
evidence.

Only  26  out  of  264  included  studies  (10%)  across  the  21  reviews
reported over 100 participants in total (or 50 per arm), a further 6%
(15/264) included over 200 participants per arm. The remaining 223
studies (84%) had fewer than 50 participants per arm (or sample
size was not reported), often not reaching 50 in total.

Other bias

The  format  for  reporting  bias  has  changed,  and  therefore  some
earlier reviews (that are yet to be updated) did not assess bias using
the same format. Others reported additional criteria as 'other bias'
including the similarity of baseline characteristics, and similarity of
timing points.

Interpretation of results/conclusions by original review
authors

For  conclusions  made  by  the  original  review  authors,  see  Table
8.  We  assessed  whether  these  conclusions/interpretations  of  the
results  accurately  reflected  the  information  provided  within  the
review, and if any further information should have been included.
This  final  assessment  of  the  review  is  an  important  stage  in
determining  any  author  bias  within  the  review  process,  as  many
readers,  funders,  and  policy  makers  will  focus  on  the  author
conclusions without a full appraisal of the actual presented data.

Eleven of the 21 reviews reported appropriate conclusions based
on  the  data  available  in  the  context  of  the  quality  of  evidence
(Bidonde 2014; Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Fransen 2015;
Gross 2015a; Koopman 2015; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016; Silva
2010;  Yamato  2015);  five  reviews  had  appropriate  conclusions,
did  not  mention  quality  of  the  evidence  in  the  conclusion,  but
did  discuss  it  in  detail  earlier  in  the  review  (Bartels  2007;  Cramp
2013;  Han  2004;  Hayden  2005;  Lauret  2014);  two  reviews  had
appropriate conclusions but had only limited discussion of quality
or did not adequately consider the quality of the evidence in the
interpretation of the results (Hurkmans 2009; Lane 2014); and three
reviews needed further comment as the strength of the conclusions
were  not  appropriate  based  on  the  available  data  (Brown  2010;

Fransen 2014), or we were unable to agree with their interpretation
due to difficulty in extracting the data (van der Heijden 2015).

Effect of interventions

We  have  interpreted  results  using  data  reported  in  the  reviews,
and did not return to the original studies. Where data have been
reported  as  MDs  or  as  an  absolute  or  relative  change  score  we
have  used  the  appropriate  scales  (where  possible)  to  determine
whether this was clinically significant. When data have only been
presented as SMD, with or without 95% confidence intervals (CI),
with or without level of significance (P value), we have cautiously
used the interpretation by Cohen 1988 who defined effect size using
the SMD as small (SMD 0.2 to 0.5), moderate (SMD 0.5 to 0.8), or large
(SMD greater than 0.8).

For the purposes of clarity, we have used the term 'intervention' to
refer to the exercise or physical activity intervention, and 'control'
to refer to the included comparison group which did not involve any
exercise or physical activity element.

Primary outcome

Self-reported pain (severity)

Part of the inclusion criteria for this overview was for pain severity
to be listed as an outcome measure.

Two  of  the  21  reviews  did  not  include/identify  any  studies  that
examined  intervention  versus  control  (Lauret  2014;  Silva  2010).
Of  the  remaining  reviews  that  did  report  studies  examining

intervention  versus  control  (no  physical  activity  or  exercise,  or
minimal  intervention),  two  did  not  report  pain  as  an  absolute  or
relative  score  of  severity,  intensity,  or  change  as  a  result  of  the
intervention  (Brown  2010;  Han  2004),  and  one  review  assessed
pain-free  time  and  distance  during  exercise  (they  did  not  assess
pain  using  a  mean/usual  pain  scale;  Lane  2014).  We  could  not
extract relevant data for one review as they compared two different
exercise  interventions  and  a  control  but  did  not  report  the  data
compared to the control (Regnaux 2015).

The  remaining  15  reviews  reported  a  mean  or  usual  pain  score
for exercise (intervention) and no-exercise (control) groups (Bartels
2007; Bidonde 2014; Boldt 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp
2013;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Gross  2015a;  Hayden  2005;
Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden
2015; Yamato 2015).

Reported baseline pain score

Of the 15 reviews that were able to assess pain (Table 9), only three
reviews reported actual baseline pain scores (Bidonde 2014; Boldt
2014; Hayden 2005). Three reviews reported change data (Bartels
2007;  Busch  2007;  Busch  2013),  but  we  were  able  to  use  control
group  baseline  and  earliest  control  group  scores  as  assumed  or
approximate baseline measures for the intervention groups in nine
reviews  (Bartels  2007;  Busch  2007;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;
Gross 2015a; Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der Heijden 2015;
Yamato  2015).  Overall,  only  three  reviews  that  assessed  pain  did
not provide baseline or control group scores for comparison (Busch
2013; Cramp 2013; Hurkmans 2009).

HAQ: mean of different category scores, 0 or 1 (mild to moderate disability), up to 2 or 3 (severe to very severe disability); WOMAC
pain score: 5 items summed to 0 (no pain) to 20 (worst pain ever); WUSPI: 15 items of 0 to 10 VAS scores, summed to form total of 0
(no pain) to 150 (worst pain ever).

This  suggests  the  majority  of  participants  reviewed  had  mild-
to-moderate  pain  (only  one  review  reported  a  mean  of  severe
pain  (aquatic  exercise  for  fibromyalgia,  Bidonde  2014)  at  the
commencement of each intervention (less than 30/100 mild pain,
30/100  to  60/100  moderate  pain,  more  than  60/100  severe  pain;
Collins 1997), though labelling the majority as having only mild-to-
moderate pain should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of
specific data available - the baseline data of the intervention group
would have been preferable to the proxies we have had to use.

Quality judgement/ tiered quality (first, second, third tier evidence)

Our  assessment  criteria  stated  that  we  would  accept  the
information as graded evidence when reported as the number of
participants  achieving  a  50%  (first  tier  evidence)  or  30%  (second
tier evidence) reduction in pain, but none of the included reviews
reported results in this way, and so instead we used the reported
absolute and relative change values.

None of the included reviews fulfilled the requirements for first tier
evidence (at least 50% pain reduction from baseline, study duration
longer than eight weeks, and more than 200 participants per arm).

Second tier evidence (at least 30% pain reduction from baseline,
study duration between four and eight weeks, and more than 200
participants in total or 100 participants per arm) was also lacking in
these reviews; three reviews found at least 30% reduction in pain
from baseline (Busch 2007; Busch 2013; van der Heijden 2015), one
of which also used long enough exercise programmes (eight to 21
weeks' intervention, Busch 2013) but totalled only 81 participants
across two studies. The other two reviews did not fulfil the study
duration  criteria  (interventions  from  2.5  weeks,  Busch  2007;  and
three weeks, van der Heijden 2015) or study size criteria.

Consequently results from relevant reviews have been pooled (all
tier  three  quality)  where  appropriate,  though  results  should  be
interpreted with caution due to the low quality evidence.

Treatment effect

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  pain  can  be  seen  in  Table  9  for
all  reviews.  Only  three  reviews  found  no  statistically  significant
changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention (Cramp 2013;
Hurkmans 2009; Koopman 2015 (assumed due to lack of presented

data)).  The  remaining  reviews  reported  a  statistically  significant
effect of the intervention at one or more time points, in at least one
subgroup.

Three  reviews  found  at  least  30%  pain  reduction  from  baseline
(post-intervention - strength training: Busch 2007; Busch 2013, at
short-term  follow-up:  van  der  Heijden  2015).  Additionally,  seven
reviews reported clinically significant results (minimally important
difference: reduction in pain from baseline of at least 10 points on
a  0  to  100  scale  or  an  absolute  improvement  of  at  least  10%  to
20%, Dworkin 2008) as a result of the exercise intervention (1.3/10
from aerobic training, Busch 2007; 12/100 (95% CI 10 to 15), Fransen
2015,; 14.9/100 (95% CI 7.39 to 22.40), Gross 2015a; 10.2/100 (95% CI
1.31 to 19.09), Hayden 2005; 2.5/10 (95% CI 1.52 to 3.48), Boldt 2014;
10.01/100 (95% CI 4.35 to 15.67), Saragiotto 2016; 14.05/100 (95%
CI  9.19  to  18.91),  Yamato  2015).  Three  reviews  found  statistically
significant improvements as a result of the intervention, but they
did  not  reach  clinical  significance  (post-intervention,  P  =  0.02,
Bartels 2007; "small to moderate" benefit post-intervention and at
six-month follow-up, P < 0.001, Fransen 2014; "moderate effect" of
7% (95% CI 3 to 11) benefit post-intervention, Bidonde 2014).

Overall, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow-
up  (see  Table  9),  as  exercise  did  not  consistently  bring  about  a
change  (positive  or  negative)  in  self-reported  pain  scores  at  any
single point.

Secondary outcomes

Physical function (objectively or subjectively measured)

Measures of physical function were the primary outcome measure
in  eight  out  of  21  reviews  (Busch  2013;  Han  2004;  Hayden  2005;
Hurkmans  2009;  Koopman  2015;  Lane  2014;  Lauret  2014;  Silva
2010), and a reported (non-primary) outcome measure in nine more
reviews  (Bartels  2007;  Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2007;  Fransen  2014;
Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Regnaux 2015; Saragiotto 2016; van der
Heijden  2015,  plus  some  which  assessed  disability;  Cramp  2013;
Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015). Only Boldt 2014 and Brown 2010 did
not list physical function (or disability, or activity limitation) as a
potential outcome measure.

Treatment effect

Treatment effect

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  physical  function  are  shown  in
Table 10. Two reviews which reported physical function had no data
to  extract  (Lauret  2014;  Silva  2010),  and  for  one  review  we  were
unable  to  extract  the  relevant  data  (Regnaux  2015).  Two  reviews
found  no  significant  difference  in  physical  function  between  the
intervention and control groups (Han 2004; Hurkmans 2009, both
rheumatoid arthritis, 8 studies, n = 240). The remaining 14 reviews
showed  that  the  intervention  produced  a  statistically  significant
benefit over the control at a minimum of one reported time point
(Bartels 2007; Bidonde 2014; Busch 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013;
Fransen 2014; Fransen 2015; Gross 2015a; Hayden 2005; Koopman
2015;  Lane  2014;  Saragiotto  2016;  van  der  Heijden  2015;  Yamato
2015; 129 studies, n greater than 9559 (exact number unknown due
to some participant numbers not being reported)).

Many  of  these  statistically  significant  results  were  of  small  or
moderate effect size (as reported by the review authors, or using
the definition by Cohen 1988 if unreported; small effect size: Bartels
2007;  Bidonde  2014;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Gross  2015a;
Koopman 2015; Saragiotto 2016; Yamato 2015, moderate effect size:
Busch 2007; Fransen 2015; Yamato 2015).

Only  one  review  reported  statistical  significance  and  large  effect
size (both short-term and long-term follow-up: SMD 1.10 (95% CI
0.58 to 1.63) and 1.62 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.94), van der Heijden 2015).
However,  the  original  review  authors  highlighted  the  low  to  very
low quality of the evidence as many studies had high or unclear risk
of bias across multiple domains (van der Heijden 2015).

Psychological function

Only  five  out  of  21  reviews  assessed  psychological  function  as
mental  health  (Bartels  2007;  Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2013),  anxiety
(Cramp  2013),  and  depression  (Boldt  2014;  Busch  2013;  Cramp
2013).

Treatment effect

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  psychological  function  can  be
seen  in  Table  11.  There  were  significant  effects  in  favour  of
the  intervention  for  mental  health  (Bartels  2007)  and  depression
(Busch  2013)  scores,  and  "variable  effect"  for  depression  (Cramp
2013).  However,  there  was  also  no  effect  or  no  differences
between  control  and  intervention  groups  reported  for  mental
health  (Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2013),  anxiety  (Cramp  2013),  and
depression (Boldt 2014).

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  quality  of  life  can  be  seen  in
Table  12.  Four  reviews  found  no  significant  difference  between
intervention  and  control  groups  in  health-related  quality  of
life  post-intervention  (9  studies,  n  =  556)  (HRQoL:  Boldt  2014;
Fransen  2014;  Gross  2015a,  global  assessment:  Bidonde  2014;
Gross 2015a)), three reviews did not or were unable to report any
data (HRQoL: Lauret 2014, global assessment: Hayden 2005, other
assessment:  Silva  2010),  and  seven  reviews  found  a  significant
improvement as a result of the intervention (34 studies, n = 2700)
(HRQoL:  Bartels  2007,  Fransen  2015,  global  assessment:  Busch
2007;  Saragiotto  2016;  Yamato  2015,  other  assessment:  Bidonde
2014; Busch 2013).

Two  reviews  assessing  strength/resistance  training  interventions
found  significantly  large  effect  sizes  (SMD  greater  than  0.8,  as
defined  by  Cohen  1988)  in  favour  of  the  intervention  (global
wellbeing  measure,  SMD  1.43  (95%  CI  0.76  to  2.10),  Busch  2007;
Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, SMD 1.27 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.83),
Busch 2013). Other statistically significant changes reported in the
included reviews were of small-to-moderate effect size (SMD 0.2 to
0.8, Cohen 1988).

Adherence to the prescribed intervention

Only  one  review  reported  adherence  to  the  intervention  as  an
outcome  measure  (Regnaux  2015),  but  the  authors  were  unable
to  perform  an  analysis  on  attendance  as  most  studies  did  not
clearly report attendance or compliance (Regnaux 2015). However,
five  reviews  assessed  withdrawals  or  dropouts  (Bidonde  2014;
Fransen  2014;  Han  2004;  Regnaux  2015;  Saragiotto  2016),  one
reported all-cause attrition (Busch 2013), and another reported the
discontinuation rate (Silva 2010).

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  adherence,  withdrawals,  and
attrition  can  be  seen  in  Table  13.  Pooling  all  available  data  for
withdrawals/dropout/attrition gave an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.94 to
1.12) in favour of the control group (6 reviews, 30 studies, n = 2256,
control withdrawal 81/1000, intervention withdrawal 82.8/1000).

One  clinically  controlled  trial  (CCT)  in  one  review  reported
statistically significant improvement in enjoyment of exercise/rest
(P = 0.0002) and self-reported benefit from exercise/rest (P = 0.006)
at both post-intervention (end of therapy, 10 weeks) and follow-up
(four months later) (n = 95, Han 2004).

Healthcare use/attendance

Quality of life

None of the reviews reported healthcare use/attendance.

A version of quality of life assessment was reported in nine reviews.
Six  were  termed  quality  of  life  or  health-related  quality  of  life
(HRQoL)  (Bartels  2007;  Boldt  2014;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;
Gross 2015a; Lauret 2014).

Other  reviews  assessed  global  perceived  effect  (Gross  2015a),
global wellbeing (Busch 2007), global assessment (Hayden 2005),
global  impression  of  recovery  (Saragiotto  2016;  Yamato  2015),
health  assessment  questionnaire  (Silva  2010),  multi-dimensional
function  (Bidonde  2014;  Busch  2013),  and  work  status  (Hayden
2005). These have been reported separately to quality of life (Table
12).

Adverse events (not death)

Eighteen out of 21 reviews reported adverse effects (three reviews
did  not  report  adverse  events  as  an  outcome  measure  due  to
lack of studies or other undisclosed reasons; Brown 2010; Lauret
2014;  Silva  2010).  Two  reviews  only  assessed  a  specific  adverse
event  ("amputation"  Lane  2014;  "motor  unit  survival"  Koopman
2015),  one  review  observed  "safety  -  pain  and  radiological
damage"  (Hurkmans  2009),  and  another  referred  to  any  "side-
effects" (Han 2004).

Data  that  could  be  extracted  for  adverse  events  (not  death)  can
be seen in Table 14. The total number of reported adverse events
(not  death)  was  137  events  across  39  studies  out  of  61  studies

that  had  adverse  events  as  an  outcome  measure  (over  one-third
of all trials that reported them found no adverse events related to
the intervention): six reviews reported no adverse events from the
included trials (Bartels 2007; Busch 2013; Cramp 2013; Hurkmans
2009; Koopman 2015; Yamato 2015) though the authors questioned
whether this was due to lack of reporting by the trial authors, or
whether there were no adverse events.

Adverse events were largely reported as a total number per trial,
though one review separately reported results for the intervention
group versus the control group (Saragiotto 2016), and two others
reported  adverse  events  for  the  intervention  group  only  (Boldt
2014;  Regnaux  2015).  Only  one  review  calculated  an  RR  for  the
adverse  events,  showing  a  reduced  risk  for  amputation  in  the
intervention  group  (two  amputations  in  the  usual  care/control
group:  RR  0.20,  95%  CI  0.01  to  4.15,  based  on  one  study  in  one
review, Lane 2014).

Death

Only  one  out  of  21  reviews  reported  death  separately  to  other
adverse events (Lane 2014). Based on five studies within the review,
death had an RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.78) in favour of exercise as
being protective, though was not statistically significant (P = 0.47).

Specificity  of  the  condition:  despite  the  heterogeneous  nature
of  chronic  pain,  in  this  overview  we  have  combined  several
painful conditions covering a number of conditions and diagnoses.
Regardless  of  aetiology,  the  impact  of  chronic  pain  is  broadly
similar across many conditions.

Summary of main results

Pain severity: there were favourable results in a number of reviews
as  a  result  of  exercise:  only  three  reviews  found  no  statistically
significant changes in usual or mean pain from any intervention.
However, results were inconsistent across interventions and follow-
up, as the intervention did not consistently bring about a change
(positive  or  negative)  in  self-reported  pain  scores  at  any  single
point. The exercise or physical activity interventions did not have a
negative effect on the outcome (did not worsen the pain). A factor
in the lack of statistical and clinically significant result may be the
baseline pain severity of participants. The majority of the included
population had an assumed mild-to-moderate pain severity score
(assumed  only  due  to  lack  of  exact  group  data  at  baseline).  This
is  often  the  desired  outcome  (post-intervention)  of  many  drug
therapies  for  pain,  and  it  may  therefore  be  difficult  to  show  a
clinically significant improvement in these people.

Physical  function:  physical  function/disability  was  the  most
commonly  reported  outcome  measure,  and  was  the  primary
measure  in  eight  out  of  the  21  reviews.  Physical  function  was
significantly (statistically) improved as a result of the intervention
in 14 reviews, though even these statistically significant results had
only small-to-moderate effect sizes in all but one review.

Psychological  function  and  quality  of  life:  there  were  variable
results for psychological function and quality of life: results were
either  favourable  to  exercise  (two  reviews  reporting  significantly
large  effect  sizes  for  quality  of  life),  or  showed  no  difference
between groups. There were no negative effects.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Adherence to the prescribed intervention: could not be assessed
in any included review. However, risk of withdrawal/dropout was
slightly  higher  in  the  exercising  group  (82.8/1000  participants
versus 81/1000 participants), though the group difference was not
significant.

Healthcare use/attendance: not reported in any included review.

Adverse events, potential harm, and death: importantly, exercise
caused no actual harm, with most adverse events being increased
soreness or muscle pain, which reportedly subsided after several
weeks of the intervention. One review reported a non-significant
reduction in risk of death as a result of the intervention.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Of the 21 included reviews, seven could be considered out of date as
they were most recently assessed as up-to-date prior to 2010 such
that  any  recent  controlled  trials  assessing  pain  severity  have  not
been  included  in  this  overview  (Cochrane  recommends  updating
reviews  every  two  years)  (Bartels  2007;  Brown  2010;  Busch  2007;
Han 2004; Hayden 2005; Hurkmans 2009; Silva 2010). We included
these reviews in the overview, but they may not be as relevant now
due to the elapsed time since they were updated. One protocol that
had  potential  to  be  included  was  published  in  2006  with  no  full
review available yet (Craane 2006).

Available data suggest that participants in the included reviews and
studies would generally be characterised as having mild-moderate
pain (moderate greater than 30/100 or 3/10) with only one review
reporting  moderate-severe  pain  (severe  greater  than  60/100  or
6/10). Therefore whether the evidence of change or no change seen
here as a result of each intervention is applicable to people further
along on the pain spectrum (with higher pain scores/worse pain) is
debatable. However, it can be argued that those people are more
likely to be assigned medical or surgical interventions than physical
activity and exercise alone (where available), and as a group they
may  be  less  able  to  engage  in  exercise,  and  may  therefore  be
more difficult to recruit into exercise-only studies. Having said this,
the  labelling  of  participants  as  having  mild-moderate  pain  was
a  cautious  one  within  this  overview  due  to  the  lack  of  specific
data available at baseline assessment; only three reviews included
baseline  pain  scores  in  the  intervention  group,  and  two  further
reviews provided control group baseline scores.

There  are  still  gaps  in  the  available  literature,  and  therefore  also
within  this  overview.  None  of  the  included  reviews  examined
generalised or widespread chronic pain as a global condition, each
instead  examined  specific  conditions  that  included  chronic  pain
as  a  symptom  or  result  of  the  ongoing  condition  (rheumatoid
arthritis,  osteoarthritis,  fibromyalgia,  low  back  pain,  intermittent
claudication,  dysmenorrhoea,  mechanical  neck  disorder,  spinal
cord injury, postpolio syndrome, and patellofemoral pain). The pain
in  these  cases  can  occur  secondary  to  other  symptoms  such  as
fatigue, muscle stiffness, difficulty sleeping, and depression, all of
which could separately (and more effectively) be influenced by the
intervention.  Additionally,  only  25%  of  included  studies  actively
reported adverse events. This may affect the completeness of the
evidence as conclusions have been drawn based on the available
data.  The  included  reviews  did  not  discuss  the  possible  impact
of  this  non-reporting  by  the  original  trials,  and  this  may  lead  to
underestimating possible adverse events from an intervention, or
overestimating its safety.

The exercise interventions examined in the included reviews were
broad; including aerobic, strength, flexibility, range of motion, and
core  or  balance  training  programmes,  as  well  as  yoga,  Pilates,
and  tai  chi.  Many  of  these  interventions  can  be  accessed  in  the
community  by  the  general  public  and  people  with  chronic  pain,
either  individually  or  in  classes  (yoga,  Pilates,  tai  chi).  Other
exercise  intervention  programmes,  such  as  the  motor  control
exercise  and  proprioceptive  (balance)  training,  requires  at  least
initial  supervision  by  a  therapist  to  teach  the  correct  techniques
and provide feedback for progression.

Quality of the evidence

In assessing the quality of the evidence, we employed the AMSTAR
tool  to  examine  the  reviews,  extracted  data  on  risk  of  bias
to  examine  the  available  primary  evidence,  and  evaluated  the
authors' conclusions to ensure that they were appropriate based
on the available data.

The AMSTAR tool is useful in assessing the reporting of a systematic
review,  though  it  does  not  inform  us  of  the  actual  undertaking
or  conduct  of  the  review  process.  All  21  included  reviews  scored
well  across  the  AMSTAR  assessment,  though  this  is  likely  due
to  the  stringent  reporting  guidelines  implemented  by  Cochrane
prior  to  publication.  However,  it  may  be  necessary  or  advisable
for  the  Cochrane  guidelines  to  be  further  expanded  and  detailed
with  regards  to  reporting  study  characteristics,  publication  bias,
and  conflicts  of  interest,  as  these  areas  often  did  not  meet  the
requirements laid out in the AMSTAR criteria (Table 1).

Data  extracted  from  the  reviews  regarding  their  assessment  of
bias  (risk  of  bias)  showed  moderate  level  scores  at  best  across
all  included  studies  within  the  included  reviews.  Other  than
issues  surrounding  blinding  (which  are  problematic  in  exercise
intervention studies due to the nature of the intervention), the trials
did not consistently and adequately report potential attrition and
reporting biases, with less than half of studies within these reviews
at low risk of bias.

However, the most prominent issue with regards to bias in these
exercise and physical activity intervention studies is the sample size
used. This subcategory is not used as standard in the assessment
of  bias  in  Cochrane  Reviews,  despite  the  increasing  volume  of
research available suggesting that small studies of fewer than 100
participants per arm (Moore 2010; Nüesch 2010) are at increased
risk  of  succumbing  to  the  random  effects  in  estimating  both
direction and magnitude of treatment effects (Moore 1998; Turner
2013)  due  to  greater  heterogeneity  within  and  between  small
studies (IntHout 2015).

Studies  within  the  included  reviews  here  were  very  small  (often
fewer than 50 participants in total). For greater quality and a more
reliable effect, at least 100 participants per arm should be analysed
for a study to potentially be classed as tier two evidence (200 per
arm  for  tier  one);  small  studies  are  known  to  overestimate  the
treatment  effect  by  up  to  32%  in  comparison  with  larger  studies
(Deschartes 2013).

Assessing studies for risk of bias based on study size (total number
or  per  arm)  should  be  included  in  any  review  or  meta-analysis
in  future,  to  adequately  assess  the  influence  of  small  trials  on
the  estimated  treatment  effect  (Nüesch  2010).  Inclusion  in  the
standard assessment process may in turn influence the design and

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

undertaking  of  future  research  trials  to  increase  the  sample  size,
and  produce  more  consistent  clinically  and  statistically  accurate
results.

Of  the  21  included  reviews,  12  used  a  pain  measure  as  their
primary  outcome  (Bartels  2007;  Boldt  2014;  Brown  2010;  Busch
2007;  Fransen  2014;  Fransen  2015;  Gross  2015a;  Hayden  2005;
Regnaux  2015;  Saragiotto  2016;  van  der  Heijden  2015;  Yamato
2015), and the remaining nine reviews included the measure as a
secondary outcome only. Other outcomes were shared, including
physical and psychological function, and quality of life. Likewise,
each review team will have included studies that did not use their
chosen outcome measures as the primary measure, and that were
therefore  powered  according  to  a  different  primary  outcome.  On
collating the evidence, some studies may appear underpowered for
the outcome(s) of interest to us (Turner 2013), yet were adequately
powered for the studies' primary measure. To increase the power
of  the  results  of  this  overview,  and  the  intermediary  reviews  we
have included, intervention studies that focus on painful conditions
should include pain intensity as the primary outcome, or at least
as  a  prominent  secondary  outcome;  alternatively  review  authors
should  seek  to  include  only  those  studies  that  were  adequately
powered for pain intensity as a primary outcome measure.

Intervention  length  ranged  from  a  single  session  to  regular
sessions  over  a  period  of  30  months,  though  the  majority  were
between eight and 12 weeks. Durations of this length are common
among exercise and physical activity intervention studies to allow
for  physiological  adaptation  and  familiarisation.  In  contrast,  the
follow-up period was often inadequate, as many reviews reported
only  a  single  follow-up  point  (immediately  post-intervention),  or
repeated  measures  over  the  short-term  (less  than  six  months):
only  six  of  the  21  reviews  planned  to  assess  participants  over
the  long  term  (over  12  months:  Gross  2015a;  Hayden  2005;
Hurkmans  2009;  Regnaux  2015;  Saragiotto  2016;  van  der  Heijden
2015).  With  chronic  conditions,  it  would  be  advisable  to  include
longer follow-up periods (beyond 12 months post-randomisation)
as  long-term  solutions  may  be  more  relevant  to  their  control  or
pain  management.  It  is  also  possible  that  initial  adaptation  and
potential benefits as a result of an exercise intervention may take
longer to manifest in comparison to a 'healthy' person due to the
possible limitations in exercise intensity and progression (a training
threshold)  beyond  which  any  additional  physical  training  may
be detrimental to the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms
(Daenen  2015)  or  simply  be  additional  physical  stress  with  no
additional physical benefit (Benton 2011).

We  grouped  outcome  measurement  points  in  this  overview  into
short  term  (less  than  six  months),  intermediate  term  (six  to  12
months),  and  long  term  (longer  than  12  months).  The  broad
time  window  for  'short  term'  outcomes  (less  than  six  months)
is  a  potential  source  of  heterogeneity  as  the  early  period  is
the  one  where  time  of  measurement  is  most  likely  to  result  in
variable  outcomes.  These  initial  problems  could  be  overcome  by
use of standard reporting periods in exercise intervention studies
(suggested  four-weekly  within  the  'short  term'  period  to  assess
both  neural  adaptation  and  other  physiological  changes).  This
would  allow  review  authors  to  use  the  data  gathered  closest  to
the  time  point  they  are  assessing,  for  more  accurate  analyses.
Additionally,  by  extending  the  follow-up  period  beyond  one  year
(long-term follow-up), heterogeneity may be reduced further.

Reviews generally did not enforce a minimum exercise requirement
for inclusion in their review. Additionally, not all exercise sessions
were supervised or baseline fitness/physical ability was assessed
subjectively,  and  consequently  it  was  not  reported  whether  the
intervention  was  fulfilled  as  described,  or  whether  the  dose  was
enough  to  elicit  a  physiological  response.  Studies  often  rely  on
the  self-report  of  participants  as  to  the  actual  physical  activity
and  exercise  being  undertaken,  which  can  lead  to  a  greater  risk
of  bias,  and  reduced  study  quality  as  it  is  questionable  as  to
whether the effect can be truly attributed to the intervention. This
was  examined  in  a  previous  review,  where  it  was  concluded  that
non-subjective  physical  assessment  should  be  performed  where
possible  (Perruchoud  2014),  though  these  still  have  challenges
regarding implementation.

In summary, the quality of the evidence was low (third tier): within
this  overview  we  found  no  tier  one  or  tier  two  evidence.  This  is
largely due to the small sample sizes and potentially underpowered
studies.  A  number  of  studies  within  the  reviews  had  adequately
long interventions, but planned follow-up was limited to less than
one year (12 months) in all but six reviews.

Interpretation  of  the  available  data,  and  conclusions  drawn  by
the  review  authors,  were  appropriate,  although  the  conclusions
were  sometimes  stronger  than  warranted  by  the  available  data.
Occasionally results were not discussed with regards to the quality
of  the  evidence  or  risk  of  bias:  it  is  important  to  discuss  the
findings in the context of the quality of the evidence, with complete
transparency, as this may affect future research, and implications
for patients, funders, and policy makers.

Potential biases in the overview process

While  we  have  attempted  to  include  all  relevant  reviews  in  the
overview  process,  we  do  concede  that  by  only  searching  the
Cochrane  Library,  and  including  only  current  Cochrane  Reviews
we  may  have  missed  some  key  literature.  However  previous
publications  have  referred  to  the  higher  quality  grading  (high
AMSTAR  score)  in  Cochrane  Reviews  due  to  the  basic  criteria
necessary  for  publication  at  any  stage  (protocol  or  full  review)
suggesting  they  may  be  the  most  reliable  source  of  evidence
(O'Connell 2013).

There  is  limited  evidence  of  improvement  in  pain  severity  as  a
result  of  exercise.  There  is  some  evidence  of  improved  physical
function and a variable effect on both psychological function and
quality of life. However, results are inconsistent and the evidence is
low quality (tier three). Promisingly however, none of the physical
and activity interventions assessed appeared to cause harm to the
participants.

Implications for practice

For clinicians and people with chronic pain

The evidence in this overview suggests that the broad spectrum of
physical activity and exercise interventions assessed here (aerobic,
strength, flexibility, range of motion, and core or balance training
programmes,  as  well  as  yoga,  Pilates,  and  tai  chi)  are  potentially
beneficial,  though  the  evidence  for  benefit  is  low  quality  and
inconsistent.  The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  were
increased  soreness  or  muscle  pain,  which  subsided  after  several
weeks of the intervention.

Physical activity and exercise may improve pain severity as well as
physical function and quality of life.

For policy makers

The  evidence  showed  variable  results,  though  in  some  reviews
there was a clinical and statistical benefit in pain relief and physical
function  (based  on  low  quality  evidence).  The  evidence  suggests
that  physical  activity  or  exercise  is  an  acceptable  intervention  in
people  with  chronic  pain,  with  minimal  negative  adverse  effects.
However  based  on  this  low  quality  evidence,  we  cannot  provide
direction to the content of an exercise programme should clinicians
decide to implement one.

Implications for research

There is a clear need for further research into exercise and physical
activity for chronic pain in adults.

General implications

• Future  research  should  report  baseline  values  for  outcome
measures in both intervention and control groups, together with
detailed relevant information about the participants. Knowing
the  baseline  value  is  relevant  to  interpreting  any  change
observed as a result of the intervention, and understanding the
broader value of the intervention.

• Where possible, pain results should be reported as the number
of  people  achieving  50%,  30%,  and  10%  pain  relief,  and  the
number who did not meet that point (dichotomous outcome).
These  are  clinically  important  cut-offs  in  pain  intervention
research, and reporting in this way allows readers to observe the
clinical effect more effectively.

• Reporting  should  include  median  and  range  as  well  as  mean
and  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  results.  This  will  allow  readers
to review the effects of any outliers that may have skewed the
data, which often goes unnoticed in the reporting of mean and
SD alone.

and  is  a  checklist  for  detailing  the  programmes  using:  why
(rationale), what (materials and procedures), who, how, where,
when, and how much.

Design

• One  previous  review  highlighted  the  increased  bias  often
present  in  questionnaires  and  other  self-report  measures  of
physical  activity  in  people  with  chronic  pain,  and  as  a  result
made the recommendation to use objective measures instead,
such  as  accelerometers,  or  the  use  of  direct  and  indirect
calorimetry,  where  possible  (Perruchoud  2014),  though  these
still  have  challenges  regarding  implementation.  This  would
allow direct and exact comparison and analyses of actual energy
expenditure and treatment effect.

Population/participants/sample

• There needs to be a focus on participants with generalised and/
or widespread chronic pain, instead of (or as well as) condition-
specific populations.

• Studies should include people with higher pain severity (greater
than 50/100 on a 100-point visual analogue scale) at baseline.
People with mild-moderate pain should still be included, but it
would be advisable to separate the results for analysis, ensuring
the study is adequately powered to allow this subgroup analysis
in advance. This way we could determine if exercise has benefit
overall,  or  affects  one  group  more  than  another,  and  tailor
exercise programmes according to the individual needs.

• It  has  been  previously  suggested  that  for  20%  to  25%  of
participants undertaking an exercise programme there is little
to  no  favourable  response  (Timmons  2014),  while  a  small
percentage (5% to 10%) have adverse events (Bouchard 2012). It
is therefore vitally important that much larger sample sizes are
used: ideally more than 200 participants per arm, though even
this number in total would increase the quality of the evidence in
the first instance. In this way we may be able to learn to identify
individuals who will benefit, and those who will require further
intervention.

Interventions

• Different  forms  of  exercise  should  be  researched  in  detail.  For
the purposes of this overview, we combined all physical activity
and  exercise  interventions  under  one  banner  to  determine  if
there was any effect. However a number of reviews separately
analysed  resistance  (strength)  training,  aerobic  (endurance),
and  combination  programmes.  It  is  important  to  continue  to
examine different modalities, but currently there is not enough
high quality evidence to exclude or prioritise one specific mode
(resistance, endurance, stability) or medium (land/water based),
or the proportion of a combination programme to be assigned to
each, as all may have individual benefits for people with chronic
pain.

• Intensity  of  exercise,  duration  of  individual  sessions,  and
frequency  should  be  investigated.  It  is  this  dose  alongside
duration  (of  the  entire  intervention)  and  adherence  that  may
determine the actual efficacy.

• More reviews and trials should attempt to minimise intervention
heterogeneity  by 
implementing  minimum  and  maximum
requirements.  Only  this  way  will  the  research  community  be
able to determine more accurately the direction and magnitude
of  effect  of  a  specific  programme  or  intervention.  Many  of

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

these important restrictions can be implemented as subgroup
analyses,  though  if  this  is  the  case  it  is  important  to  have
adequate  study  numbers  (ideally  200  participants  per  arm  or
subgroup).

• Due  to  the  chronicity  and  long-term  nature  of  the  condition,
physiological  and  psychological  changes  may  take  longer  to
manifest. It is widely accepted that there is a delay in muscular
hypertrophy as a result of exercise, and initial gains within the
first few weeks of any training programme will be as a result of
neural factors (Enoka 1997); this is also in line with the grading
of evidence (tier two evidence or higher requires a minimum of a
four-week intervention). This suggests that longer interventions
may  be  necessary  (eight  weeks  for  tier  one  evidence),  though
assessing  participants  at  regular  intervals,  including  at  four
weeks, would be beneficial to examine the effect of the neural
adaptation alone.

Measurement (end-points)

• Randomised  controlled  trials  with  long-term  follow-up  are
needed.  Chronic  pain  is  defined  by  its  chronic  nature,  and
therefore long-term follow-up of results is equally important as
the  initial  short-term  effect  (if  not  more  so):  outcomes  should
be assessed beyond one year after randomisation. In turn this
will  inform  the  direct  effect  of  the  intervention,  as  well  as  the
proportion of the population who maintains the programme of
exercise employed in the intervention, or something else under
the guise of physical activity as a result of participation.

• The  broad  time  window  for  'short  term'  outcomes  (less  than
six months) is a potential source of heterogeneity as the early
period  is  the  one  where  time  of  measurement  is  most  likely
to  result  in  variable  outcomes.  These  initial  problems  could
be  overcome  by  use  of  standard  reporting  periods  in  exercise
intervention studies (suggested four-weekly assessment within
the  'short  term'  period  to  assess  both  neural  adaptation  and
other physiological changes). This would allow review authors
to  use  the  data  recorded  closest  to  the  time  point  they  are
assessing, for more accurate and comparable analyses.

• Outcome measures used by researchers should be standardised
across  trials  and  studies.  Recommendations  for  selecting  the
most  appropriate  and  important  outcome  measures  to  those
who  live  with  chronic  pain  have  previously  been  published
(Initiatives  on  Methods,  Measurement,  and  Pain  Assessment
in  Clinical  Trials  (IMMPACT)  Consensus  Recommendations,
Dworkin 2005; Turk 2003).

Other

• It  would  be  of  interest  in  future  research  to  determine  the
reasons for non-participation in regular physical activity or non-
compliance to a prescribed exercise intervention in people with
chronic pain, and how to overcome these barriers.

• Future  Cochrane  Reviews  could  include:  exercise  for  chronic
pain  or  chronic  widespread  pain  (and  not  specific  conditions
such  as  osteoarthritis,  fibromyalgia,  etc.),  and  exercise  for
neuropathic  pain.  These  areas  have  not  been  covered  by
Cochrane with an exercise or physical activity intervention.

Criteria

Specific requirements (possible answers: yes, no, cannot answer, not applicable)

1. Was an 'a priori' design
used?

The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the re-
view.

Note: need to refer to a protocol, ethics approval, or predetermined/a priori published research objec-
tives to score a "yes."

2. Was there duplicate study
selection and data extraction?

There should be at least 2 independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagree-
ments should be in place.

3. Was a comprehensive litera-
ture search performed?

Note: 2 people do study selection, 2 people do data extraction, consensus process or 1 person checks
the other person's work.

At least 2 electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases
used (e.g. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase). Keywords or MeSH terms (or both) must be stated and
where feasible the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by
consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialised registers, or experts in the particular
field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found.

Note: if at least 2 sources + 1 supplementary strategy used, select "yes"(Cochrane register/ CENTRAL
counts as 2 sources; a grey literature search counts as supplementary).

4. Was the status of the pub-
lication (i.e. grey literature)
used as inclusion criteria?

The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The
authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review), based
on their publication status, language, etc.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Table 1.   AMSTAR tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews  (Continued)

Note: if review indicates that there was a search for "grey literature"or "unpublished literature,"indi-
cate "yes."SIGLE database, dissertations, conference proceedings, and trial registries are all consid-
ered grey for this purpose. If searching a source that contains both grey and non-grey, must specify
that they were searching for grey/unpublished literature.

5. Was a list of studies (includ-
ed and excluded) provided?

A list of included and excluded studies should be provided.

Note: acceptable if the excluded studies were referenced. If there was an electronic link to the list but
the link is no longer active, select "no."

6. Were the characteristics of
the included studies provided?

In an aggregated form such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the
participants, interventions, and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies analysed,
e.g. age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other dis-
eases should be reported.

Note: acceptable if not in table format as long as they are described as above.

7. Was the scientific quality of
the included studies assessed
and documented?

'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g. for effectiveness studies if the author(s)
chose to include only randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, or allocation conceal-
ment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies alternative items will be relevant.

Note: can include use of a quality scoring tool or checklist, e.g. Jadad scale, risk of bias, sensitivi-
ty analysis, etc., or a description of quality items, with some type of result for EACH study ("low"or
"high"is acceptable, as long as it is clear which studies scored "low"and which scored "high;"a sum-
mary score/range for all studies is not acceptable).

8. Was the scientific quality of
the included studies used ap-
propriately in formulating con-
clusions?

The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis
and the conclusions of the review, and explicitly stated in formulating recommendations.

Note: might say something such as "the results should be interpreted with caution due to poor quality
of included studies."Cannot score "yes"for this question if scored "no"for question 7.

9. Were the methods used to
combine findings of studies
appropriate?

For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their
homogeneity (i.e. Chi2 test for homogeneity, I2 statistic). If heterogeneity exists, a random-effects
model should be used or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into considera-
tion (i.e. is it sensible to combine?), or both.

Note: indicate "yes"if they mention or describe heterogeneity, i.e. if they explain that they cannot pool
because of heterogeneity/variability between interventions.

10. Was the likelihood of publi-
cation bias assessed?

An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g. funnel plot,
other available tests) or statistical tests (e.g. Egger regression test), or both.

Note: if no test values or funnel plot included, score "no."Score "yes"if they mention that publication
bias could not be assessed because there were fewer than 10 included studies.

11. Was the conflict of interest
stated?

Potential sources of support should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the
included studies.

Note: to get a "yes,"must indicate source of funding or support for the systematic review AND for each
of the included studies.

Review

Review authors' conclusions

"Aquatic exercise has some short-term beneficial effects on the condi-
tion of OA patients with hip or knee OA or both. The controlled and ran-
domised studies in this area are still too few to give further recommen-
dations on how to use this therapy... No long-term effects have been
found."

"Low to moderate quality evidence relative to control suggests that
aquatic training is beneficial for improving wellness, symptoms, and fit-
ness in adults with fibromyalgia. Very low to low quality evidence sug-
gests that there are benefits of aquatic and land-based exercise, except
in muscle strength (very low quality evidence favoring land). No serious
adverse effects were reported."

"Evidence is insufficient to suggest that non-pharmacological treatments
are effective in reducing chronic pain in people living with SCI. The bene-
fits and harms of commonly used non-pharmacological pain treatments
should be investigated in randomised controlled trials with adequate
sample size and study methodology"

Appropriate conclusions
based on available data.

"There is a lack of available evidence to support the use of exercise in the
alleviation of symptoms associated with dysmenorrhoea. The limited
evidence implies that there are no adverse effects associated with exer-
cise."

"There is moderate quality evidence that short-term aerobic training (at
the intensity recommended for increases in cardiorespiratory fitness)
produces important benefits in people with FM in global outcome mea-
sures, physical function, and possibly pain and tender points. There is
limited evidence that strength training improves a number of outcomes
including pain, global wellbeing, physical function, tender points and de-
pression. There is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of flexibili-
ty exercise. Adherence to many of the aerobic exercise interventions de-
scribed in the included studies was poor."

"We have found evidence in outcomes representing wellness, symptoms,
and physical fitness favoring resistance training over usual treatment
and over flexibility exercise, and favoring aerobic training over resistance
training. Despite large effect sizes for many outcomes, the evidence has
been decreased to low quality based on small sample sizes, small num-
ber of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and the problems with descrip-
tion of study methods in some of the included studies."

Cramp 2013

"There is some evidence that physical activity interventions ... may help
to reduce fatigue in RA. However, the optimal parameters and compo-
nents of these interventions are not yet established."

Fransen 2014

"There is currently high-level evidence that land-based exercise will re-
duce hip pain, and improve physical function, among people with symp-
tomatic hip osteoarthritis."

Fransen 2015

Gross 2015a

Han 2004

Hayden 2005

Hurkmans 2009

"High-quality evidence suggests that land-based therapeutic exercise
provides benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and quality of life and
moderate-quality evidence of improved physical function among people
with knee OA… Despite the lack of blinding we did not downgrade the
quality of evidence for risk of performance or detection bias."

"…there is still no high quality evidence and uncertainty about the ef-
fectiveness of exercise for neck pain… Moderate quality evidence sup-
ports the use specific strengthening exercises as a part of routine prac-
tice … Moderate quality evidence supports the use of strengthening ex-
ercises, combined with endurance or stretching exercises may also yield
similar beneficial results. However, low quality evidence notes when on-
ly stretching or only endurance type exercises … there may be minimal
beneficial effects for both neck pain and function."

"Tai chi appears to have no detrimental effects on the disease activity of
RA in terms of swollen/tender joints and activities of daily living…tai chi
appears to be safe, since only 1 participant out of 121 withdrew due to
adverse effects and withdrawals were greater in the control groups than
the tai chi groups."

"Evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that exer-
cise therapy is effective at reducing pain and functional limitations in the
treatment of chronic low-back pain, though cautious interpretation is re-
quired due to limitations in this literature."

"Short-term, land-based dynamic exercise programs have a positive ef-
fect on aerobic capacity (aerobic capacity training whether or not com-
bined with muscle strength training) and muscle strength (aerobic ca-
pacity training combined with muscle strength training) immediately
after the intervention, but not after a follow-up period. Short-term, wa-
ter-based dynamic exercise programs have a positive effect on function-
al ability and aerobic capacity directly after the intervention but it is un-
known whether these effects are maintained after follow-up. Long-term,
land-based dynamic exercise programs (aerobic capacity and muscle
strength training) have a positive effect on functional ability, aerobic
capacity, and muscle strength immediately after the intervention but
it is unknown whether these effects are maintained after follow-up...
Based on the evidence, aerobic capacity training combined with muscle
strength training is recommended for routine practice in patients with
RA."

No conclusions about effect
on pain (insufficient data).

Evidence was good quality
though sample sizes were of-
ten small (i.e. it is debatable
if this was high level evidence
as claimed by authors). Agree
that results demonstrate
small but significant benefit
from intervention.

Koopman 2015

"Data from two single trials suggested that muscle strengthening of
thumb muscles (very low-quality evidence) ... are safe and beneficial for
improving muscle strength ... with unknown effects on activity limita-
tions."

Appropriate conclusions
based on available data.

"We found evidence varying from very low quality to high quality that ...
rehabilitation in a warm or cold climate are not beneficial in PPS."

"Due to a lack of good-quality data and randomised studies, it was im-
possible to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of inter-
ventions in people with PPS."

Lane 2014

"… Exercise therapy should play an important part in the care of select-
ed patients with intermittent claudication, to improve walking times and
distances. Effects were demonstrated following three months of super-
vised exercise although some programmes lasted over one year."

Lauret 2014

Regnaux 2015

"There was no clear evidence of differences between supervised walking
exercise and alternative exercise modes in improving the maximum and
pain-free walking distance of patients with intermittent claudication….
The results indicate that alternative exercise modes may be useful when
supervised walking exercise is not an option for the patient."

Appropriate conclusions
based on available data.
However, no mention of
quality/risk of bias of studies
in conclusion (in discussion).

"We found very low- to low-quality evidence for no important clinical
benefit of high-intensity compared to low-intensity exercise programs in
improving pain and physical function in the short term.... The included
studies did not provide any justification for the levels of intensity of exer-
cise programs. No authors reported evidence for the minimal and maxi-
mal intensity that could be delivered."

Appropriate conclusions
based on available data. This
overview has only used one
study of the six included as
it alone included a control
group, for which we could
not extract data as the con-
trol comparison was not used
in the analysis by the review
authors.

Saragiotto 2016

"There is very low to moderate quality evidence that MCE has a clinically
important effect compared with a minimal intervention for chronic low
back pain... As MCE appears to be a safe form of exercise and none of the
other types of exercise stands out, the choice of exercise for chronic low
back pain should depend on patient or therapist preferences, therapist
training, costs and safety."

Silva 2010

"We were not able to provide any evidence to support the application of
balance exercises (proprioceptive training) alone in patients with RA."

van der Heijden 2015

"This review has found very low quality but consistent evidence that ex-
ercise therapy for patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) may result in
clinically important reduction in pain and improvement in functional
ability."

Yamato 2015
