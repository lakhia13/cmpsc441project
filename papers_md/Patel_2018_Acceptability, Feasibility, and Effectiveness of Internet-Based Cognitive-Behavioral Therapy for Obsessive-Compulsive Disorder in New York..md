Abstract

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), consisting of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP), is 
both efficacious and preferred by patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), yet few 
receive this treatment in practice. This study describes the implementation of an Internet-based 
CBT program (ICBT) developed in Sweden in individuals seeking OCD treatment in New York. 
After translating and adapting the Swedish ICBT for OCD, we conducted an open trial with 40 
adults with OCD. Using the RE-AIM implementation science framework, we assessed the 
acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of ICBT. The Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
(Y-BOCS) was the primary outcome measure. Of 40 enrolled, 28 participants completed the 10-

week ICBT. In the intent-to-treat sample (N = 40), Y-BOCS scores decreased significantly over 
time (F = 28.12, df = 2, 49, p < . 001). Depressive severity (F = 5.87, df = 2, 48, p < . 001), and 
quality of life (F = 12.34, df = 2, 48, p < . 001) also improved. Sensitivity analyses among 
treatment completers (N = 28) confirmed the intent-to-treat results, with a large effect size for Y-
BOCS change (Cohen’s d = 1.38). ICBT took less time to implement than face-to face EX/RP and 
participants were very to mostly satisfied with ICBT. On a par with results in Sweden, the adapted 
ICBT program reduced OCD and depressive symptoms and improved quality of life among 
individuals with moderate to severe OCD. Given its acceptability and feasibility, ICBT deserves 
further study as a way to increase access to CBT for OCD in the United States.

Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a disabling mental illness, with a lifetime 
prevalence of about 2%, a relatively early onset, and a typically chronic course (Eisen et al., 
2013; Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010). Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), consisting 
of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP), is one of the most efficacious OCD 
treatments (Simpson, Huppert, Petkova, Foa, & Liebowitz, 2006; Skapinakis et al., 2016). 
Individuals with OCD prefer EX/RP to serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications alone 
(Patel, Galfavy, Kimeldorf, Dixon, & Simpson, 2016; Patel & Simpson, 2010), yet few 
receive this treatment in clinical practice (Eisen et al., 1999; Marques et al., 2010; Patel et 
al., 2014). Uncertainty about where to seek treatment, lack of trained therapists, shame, 
stigma, and costs associated with seeking mental health care are documented barriers to care 
(Blanco, Olfson, Stein, Simpson, & Narrow, 2006; Marques et al., 2010).

Efforts to improve access to CBT for OCD include self-help (Bachofen et al., 1999; Clark, 
Kirkby, Daniels, & Marks, 1998; Greist et al., 1998, 2002; Kenwright, Marks, Graham, 
Franses, & Mataix-Cols, 2005; Marks et al., 1998; Mataix-Cols & Marks, 2006; Pearcy, 
Anderson, Egan, & Rees, 2016; Tolin et al., 2007) with some of the most promising results 
demonstrated for Internet-based treatment delivery formats used largely outside of the 
United States (Andersson et al., 2011, 2012, 2015; Moritz, Wittlekind, Hauschildt, & 
Timpano, 2011; Seol, Kwon, Kim, Kim, & Shin, 2016; Wootton et al., 2011). Compared to 
face-to-face EX/RP treatment, Internet-based treatments provide convenient access to 
treatment at any time, can be self-paced, and the treatment content can be customized to the 
individual’s experience in some programs. Internet-based treatments that include therapist 
support have seen superior results (Andersson et al., 2012; Moritz et al., 2011; Seol et al., 
2016) compared with those without therapist support. Among these, an Internet-based CBT 
(ICBT) for OCD, developed at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden (Andersson et al., 2011, 
2012, 2015), has been shown to be highly effective. In this ICBT program, individuals use 
an Internet-based treatment to learn about their illness and practice EX/RP under the 
confidential e-mail guidance of a therapist. When compared with an active control condition 
in a randomized controlled trial in Sweden, ICBT led to reduction in OCD severity with 
large effect sizes on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Cohen’s d = 
1.12; Goodman et al., 1989)—also, a significantly higher percentage of people receiving

ICBT responded to treatment (60% vs. 6%, respectively). This response rate is similar to 
that seen in standard face-to-face CBT protocols, but ICBT requires only about one fourth 
the therapist time (Andersson et al., 2012). Moreover, ICBT enables individuals who face 
barriers to care to access CBT for the first time (Andersson et al., 2011, 2012).

While ICBT is a clear advance for self-help programs for OCD, there are no data available 
on the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of this ICBT program in the United States. 
Research has shown that individuals with OCD in the United States often do not receive 
evidence-based care, with lower rates of treatment with EX/RP (range = 7.5–18%) than SRI 
medications (range = 39–77%), even though EX/RP is often a preferred treatment (Eisen et 
al., 1999; Marques et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2014, 2016). To begin exploring the utility of an 
ICBT program for OCD as a method to increase access to EX/RP for OCD in the United 
States, we collaborated with Karolinska Institutet in Sweden to adapt their ICBT program 
and evaluate its effect in a diverse sample of OCD participants seeking treatment in New 
York. We used the RE-AIM implementation research framework to evaluate the transfer of 
this e-health program from research to the real world (Glasgow, McKay, Piette, & Reynolds, 
2001). We first adapted the ICBT program by translating the Swedish language-based ICBT 
program to English, culturally adapting the program content prior to implementation (e.g., 
case vignettes, language used to explain therapeutic concepts), and vetting it using local 
experts in EX/RP and four test OCD patients. We then tested this adapted ICBT program in 
40 adults with OCD. With these adaptations, we hypothesized that ICBT would be an 
acceptable and feasible approach for individuals with OCD and would lead to improvements 
in OCD symptoms, depression, and quality of life, comparable to results with ICBT in 
Sweden.

Methods

Setting and Recruitment

The study was conducted at the Center for Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders, an 
outpatient research clinic in New York City, New York, known for its expertise in the 
diagnosis and multimodal treatment of OCD. Participants were recruited from March 2014 
to March 2016 via a study-specific website (http://columbiaocd.wixsite.com/icbt) on the 
clinic’s website, clinician referrals, and study-specific advertisements posted in online 
forums and the community. The Institutional Review Board approved the research protocol 
and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants

Eligible participants were adults (ages 18–75 years) with a principal diagnosis of OCD 
according to DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Participants on 
psychotropic medications were eligible if they had been on a stable dose for at least 2 
months and agreed to maintain a constant dosage during the trial. Participants with comorbid 
depression or anxiety disorders were eligible only if OCD was the most severe and 
impairing condition. Participants were also required to have regular access to a computer in 
order to access the Internet.

Procedures

Individuals were excluded if they had (a) a diagnosis of bipolar or psychotic disorder; (b) 
current substance abuse or dependence; (c) clinically significant suicidal ideation or lifetime 
history of suicide attempt or hospitalization; (d) hoarding as the primary OCD symptom; (e) 
severe to extreme OCD (as measured by the Y-BOCS > 30; Goodman et al., 1989); or (f) a 
current serious physical illness that could interfere with ICBT, consistent with previous trials 
of ICBT in Sweden. After completing an initial eligibility telephone screen, participants 
were invited for an in-person evaluation in the clinic. Doctoral-level clinicians administered 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer, 2015) to 
verify OCD diagnostic criteria and determine eligibility.

After providing written informed consent, participants were oriented to the ICBT platform, 
instructed that they had 12 weeks to complete the ICBT treatment, and assigned to an 
individual therapist to monitor their progress and provide support via e-mail and telephone. 
Independent evaluators (IEs) assessed participants at baseline, posttreatment, and at 4 
months after the treatment.

ICBT Treatment—The ICBT platform used in the present study was adapted from the 
version found to be effective in Sweden (Andersson et al., 2011, 2012). ICBT incorporates 
the established CBT techniques of psychoeducation, self-monitoring, cognitive 
restructuring, EX/RP, and relapse prevention. The treatment information is provided in text 
and divided into 10 modules. Worksheets accompany modules to reinforce concepts, to 
monitor EX/RP exercises, and to gather patient information related to symptoms. Modules 
1–4 involve psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and individual EX/RP hierarchy 
formation. Modules 5–10 consist of daily in vivo EX/RP exercises and monitoring of 
subjective units of distress (SUDS) levels. The treatment platform included tailored 
examples of obsessions and compulsions for particular OCD symptom subtypes (washing, 
checking, symmetry, and forbidden thoughts).

A therapist was assigned to each participant for the duration of the treatment. Therapists did 
not have face-to-face contact with participants during treatment and instead provided support 
via e-mail messages within the platform and regularly scheduled weekly phone calls (each 
lasting up to 30 minutes) during the EX/RP phase of treatment and as needed during the first 
four modules of the treatment. Therapists gave feedback on homework assignments, granted 
access to modules based on clinical judgment, monitored progress, and answered questions 
in a timely fashion (i.e., within 24 hours). Therapists were some junior clinicians with 
minimal CBT/EX/RP experience (treating on average 3 cases, range = 2–4), one senior 
clinician with CBT experience but minimal EX/RP experience, and one expert EX/RP 
supervisor who provided group supervision and monitored therapist communication in the 
ICBT platform on a weekly basis.

Adaptations to ICBT—In collaboration with the developers of ICBT at the Karolinska 
Institutet in Sweden (E.A. and C.R.), we adapted the ICBT program to the U.S. context. 
First, we translated the ICBT program from Swedish into English using best practices: 
forward translation with consensus bilingual committee review (Bravo, Canino, Rubio-

Stipec, &Woodbury- Fariña, 1991). Then we made the materials culturally appropriate. For 
example, in the case of a vignette to illustrate contamination fears, the example of Jörgen 
who has fears of contamination when he sees a dirty rag changed to John who has fears of 
contamination when he touches a doorknob. To provide participants with the option to listen 
to the text-based information in the treatment platform, we also added mp3 audio recordings 
to each module. To confirm that the program met standard practices for U.S. manuals of 
EX/RP, we asked two expert EX/RP therapists to review the program. Finally, once 
translated and vetted, we tested the program with four patients with OCD. This led us to add 
weekly phone calls (up to seven calls of up to 30 minutes) when the participants began the 
EX/RP phase (Modules 5–10) to provide additional support and discussion of exposures. We 
also developed an orientation guide for participants to learn how to navigate through the 
treatment platform including a guide to the most frequently asked questions. Finally, to 
standardize therapist delivery of ICBT we also developed a therapist manual, which 
provided guidelines for implementing ICBT. This included recommendations to enhance 
patient adherence to ICBT modules and worksheets, as well as guidelines for patient 
contacts, including charting and maintaining Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance. We also developed a therapist orientation video, in 
which new therapists learned how to navigate the treatment platform and participant 
dashboard (e-mail system, homework completion, and weekly participant self-rating scales) 
to manage their ICBT participant caseload.

Implementation Framework—We used the RE-AIM implementation science framework 
to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness when transferring an e-health 
program from research to real world (Glasgow et al., 2001; see Table 1). To assess 
acceptability (RE-AIM: adoption), we used adherence to ICBT (i.e., the number of modules 
completed). We also asked participants at posttreatment to rate their satisfaction with the 
ICBT program using three questions from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ; 
Larsen, Attkisson, Hargreaves, & Nguyen, 1979), a commonly utilized measure of treatment 
satisfaction. We also included three open-ended questions that asked about their reason for 
seeking an Internet-based treatment, their ICBT experience, and their recommendations to 
improve ICBT.

To assess feasibility (RE-AIM: reach, implementation), we collected data on sample 
participation and representativeness through a clinical trial tracking log (screening to study 
completion) used by the study coordinator as well as a demographic form. Using metrics 
recorded in the treatment platform, we also assessed therapist burden by measuring the 
number of phone calls/e-mails, and the time spent making phone calls, reviewing platform 
materials, and writing e-mails.

To assess effectiveness (RE-AIM: effectiveness, maintenance) we used validated clinical 
scales completed in person or via telephone by IEs at baseline, posttreatment, and 4 months 
after treatment completion. The IEs assessed OCD severity using the Y-BOCS (Goodman et 
al., 1989) and depressive severity using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D; 
Hamilton, 1960). The IEs were doctoral-level clinical psychologists with substantial 
experience assessing OCD as part of clinical trials conducted in our clinic. IEs were trained 
to administer the Y-BOCS and HAM-D with a standardized IE manual and participated in

quarterly interrater reliability exercises in which they were asked to rate an IE recorded in 
our clinic. The Y-BOCS is the “gold standard” measure of OCD severity. It is a semi-
structured interview consisting of 10 items used to assess the severity of obsessions and 
compulsions in the past week. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (no 
symptoms) to 4 (extreme.) Total scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating 
more severe symptoms. The Y-BOCS has good internal consistency, excellent interrater 
reliability, and good test–retest reliability (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Cronbach’s alpha indicated that the Y-BOCS had excellent reliability in the present sample 
(α = .93). The HAM-D is a 17-item clinician-administered interview that is a commonly 
used measure of depression severity. Total scores range from 0 to 50 (with higher scores 
indicating more severe depression). The HAM-D has good psychometric properties, 
including good interrater reliability, internal consistency, and test–retest reliability. In the 
present sample the HAM-D evidenced good reliability (α = .83). At baseline, posttreatment, 
and 4-month follow-up, participants also completed the Quality of Life Enjoyment and 
Satisfaction Questionnaire—Short Form (Q-LES-QSF; Endicott, Nee, Harrison, & 
Blumenthal, 1993). The Q-LES-Q is a 15-item self-reported measure of quality of life 
frequently used in research. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life. This measure has 
good reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change. In the present sample the Q-LES-Q-SF 
had good reliability (α = .90).

To monitor weekly clinical progress from baseline to posttreatment (Week 10), participants 
also completed two self-report questionnaires in the ICBT treatment platform prior to 
accessing each module: the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory—Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al., 
2002) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms—Self-Report (QIDS-SR; Rush et 
al., 2003). The OCI-R is a commonly utilized measure of self-reported OCD symptom 
severity. The measure consists of 18 items measuring distress associated with obsessions and 
compulsions, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. In the present sample, 
the OCI-R had good reliability (α = .88). The QIDS-SR is a 16-item measure of depressive 
symptom severity. In the present sample, the QIDS-SR had good reliability (α = .85).

Statistical Analyses

SPSS version 24.0 and the statistical language R (R version 3.1.2 [2014-10-31] Copyright 
2014 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing) were used for the statistical analysis.

Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe sample characteristics, scores on the CSQ, 
patient adherence, and therapist time. Open-ended questions about the ICBT program were 
abstracted using an inductive process suggested by Hill, Thompson, and Williams (1997). 
Two coders (S. R.P. and O.P.) each developed a preliminary list of themes by independently 
reviewing the open-ended question data. The coders met and iteratively modified themes 
comparing and discussing the data until they reached consensus on themes reported by at 
least 10% of the sample.

To assess clinical outcomes, primary analyses were carried out in the intent-to-treat (ITT; N 
= 40) sample. The primary outcome was the Y-BOCS; secondary outcomes included the 
HAM-D and QLES-Q-SF. For all three scales, repeated measures were analyzed as 
dependent variables using mixed-effect regression models (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000), with

the three-level time variable as the categorical independent variable, subject-specific random 
intercepts, and an AR correlation structure for the subject-level residuals. For the weekly 
platform self-ratings, OCI-R and QIDS-SR weekly average item scores were analyzed using 
linear mixed-effect regression models with number of weeks as a (linear) predictor, subject-
specific random intercepts, and an AR correlation structure for the subject-level residuals.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted on those who completed the 10-week treatment (N = 
28), using paired samples t tests (baseline to posttreatment) for the Y-BOCS, HAM-D, and 
Q-LES-Q-SF, and two self-report measures—the OCI-R and the QIDS-SR. Cohen’s d was 
calculated to estimate effect sizes for the sensitivity analyses. Alpha was set at p < .05. 
Finally, for the Y-BOCS, we used a ≥ 25% reduction in OCD symptoms as the definition for 
treatment response (Simpson et al., 2006).

Using the RE-AIM framework, results of the study are summarized below.

Figure 1 presents participant flow through the trial. Forty-two of 112 individuals screened 
were not eligible for the study; for most, this was because OCD was not their primary 
diagnosis, they had had recent medication changes, or they had a history of a suicide attempt 
or psychiatric hospitalization. Another 18 reported they were not interested; reasons 
included their being unwilling to travel to the clinic for an initial evaluation and preference 
for face-to-face contact with therapist (i.e., via Skype or videoconference).

Forty individuals signed consent and were enrolled in the study. Demographic and clinical 
data are shown in Table 2. Our sample was majority non-Hispanic White (82%) as well as 
Asian and Pacific Islander (7.5%), Black (7.5%), and Native American (2.5%) individuals 
with moderate to severe OCD (Y-BOCS = 25.8 ± 4.6) and mild depressive symptoms 
(HAM-D = 9.1 ± 6.3). Participants self-reported an average of 23 years since receiving a 
diagnosis of OCD (SD = 12.1), and approximately one third were on medications for OCD 
(37.5%) and one quarter or less had a history of CBT (27%) or EX/RP (15%).

Of the 40 individuals who enrolled in the study, 28 (70%) completed (defined as completion 
of all 10 modules) ICBT and the posttreatment assessment. One participant was withdrawn 
due to worsening OCD and depressive symptoms; the others dropped out of their own 
accord (loss of interest in treatment, N = 6; loss of computer access, N = 2; unknown, N = 
3). Individuals who dropped out of treatment and were lost to follow-up did not differ from 
those completing the treatment on baseline values of the Y-BOCS, HAM-D, or the Q-LES-
QSF, all p > .05. Of the 28 who completed treatment, 20 completed the 4-month assessment.

Effectiveness

Effectiveness results in the ITT sample (N = 40) are presented in Table 3. In the ITT sample, 
OCD severity as measured by the Y-BOCS declined significantly over time, F = 28.12, df = 
2, 49, p < .001; from baseline to posttreatment: mean decrease = −7.48, SE = 1.11, t(49) = 
−6.71, p < .001; and from baseline to 4-month follow-up: mean decrease = −9.50, SE = 1.49,

t(49) = −6.36, p < .001. Depressive severity as measured by the HAM-D also declined

4-month follow-up: mean increase = 16.94, SE = 3.42, t(48) = 4.96, p < .001. OCI-R weekly 
scores declined significantly over the course of the study (itemwise mean decline estimate: b 
= −0.06/week, SE = 0.01, df = 315, t = − 6.78, p < .0001), as did QIDS-SR scores (itemwise 
mean b = − 0.02 points/week, SE = 0.01, df = 364, t = −4.78, p < .0001).

There were no differences between treatment completers (N = 28) and those not available 
for follow up (N = 20) in posttreatment Y-BOCS severity (completers M = 18.3 vs. those not 
available for follow-up, M = 19.1, t = −0.24, df = 28, p = .81) or pre–post treatment Y-BOCS 
change (completers M = −7.5 vs. those not available for follow-up, M = −8, t = −0.20, df = 
28, p = .84).

Sensitivity analyses on treatment completers (N = 28) examined baseline to posttreatment 
scores on both IE and self-report measures among individuals who completed the 10-week 
treatment. Paired samples t tests showed significant reductions in OCD severity, Y-BOCS 
baseline: M = 26.1, SD = 4.5 posttreatment: 18.2, SD = 7.9, t(27) = 6.44, p < .001; 
depressive severity, HAM-D baseline: M = 9.3, SD = 6.5 posttreatment: 6.2, SD = 5.8, t(27) 
= 3.85, p = .001; and improved quality of life, Q-LES-Q-SF baseline: M = 54.9, SD = 13.8 
posttreatment: 63.4, SD =19.1, t(27) = −3.78, p = .001. Effect size was large (Y-BOCS 
Cohen’s d = 1.38) for reduction in OCD symptoms, and medium for change in depression 
(Cohen’s d = .74) and quality of life (Cohen’s d = .79). For OCD and depression self-report 
platform measures, the results corroborated the IE ratings, OCI-R baseline M = 32.6, SD = 
12.6 posttreatment: 18.7, SD = 14.2, t(27) = 4.87, p < .001, Cohen’s d = .92 and QIDS-SR 
baseline M = 11.9, SD = 5.6 posttreatment: 7.8, SD = 8.2, t(27), p = .001, Cohen’s d = .75.

At posttreatment, 16 (40%) of the 40 who started and 16 (57%) of the 28 who completed 
met response criteria for OCD (≥ 25% Y-BOCS reduction; Simpson et al., 2006). In 
addition, 7 of these (ITT sample: 17.5%; treatment completer sample: 25%) attained mild or 
minimal OCD symptoms (Y-BOCS ≤ 12), a marker of posttreatment wellness (Farris, 
McLean, Van Meter, Simpson, & Foa, 2013).

Adoption (Individual)

Among the ITT sample, participants completed 8 modules on average including the weekly 
exercises (range = 1–10, SD = 3.0) of the 10-week treatment; 70% completed all 10 
modules. None of the participants reported any changes in medication or initiation of 
concurrent psychological treatment during their participation in the 10-week treatment.

On the CSQ, a majority of the treatment completer sample (79%) reported they were mostly 
to very satisfied with ICBT. Out of the treatment completer sample, (78%) reported that they 
would come back to the ICBT program if they were to seek help again.

Review of the open-ended question data revealed that competing demands of work, a desire 
to avoid treatment with medication, shame/embarrassment, convenience and access to 
treatment, and therapist recommendation were top reasons why participants chose to 
participate in this ICBT program. Out of those who completed the program, most (73%) 
reported a positive experience with ICBT. Treatment completers’ top three recommendations 
made for improving ICBT included increasing communication with therapists (31%), 
enhancing resources or learning tools for EX/RP (e.g., more examples of individuals with 
OCD, simpler worksheets, adding videos [27%], and offering longer treatment duration 
[15%]).

Implementation

The ICBT platform logged the amount of time that therapists spent interacting with 
participant materials (e.g., reviewing homework and writing e-mails). In the ITT sample, 
therapists sent on average 24 e-mails (range = 4–75, SD = 13.5), which translated into on 
average 164 minutes (range = 11.5–815, SD = 209.1) over the 10-week treatment (i.e., 16 
minutes per patient per week on e-mails). On average therapists conducted eight telephone 
calls per participant over the 10 weeks (range = 2–25, SD = 8.5); each telephone call lasted 
an average of 23 minutes per call (range = 8–33, SD = 6.6). In total, therapists spent on 
average 393 minutes per participant including platform correspondence and telephone calls.

We did not find a therapist effect on Y-BOCS values (p = .21) and there were no significant 
associations found between number of e-mails sent or phone calls and posttreatment Y-
BOCS score and pre–post treatment Y-BOCS change (all p > .05).

Discussion

In this study, we adapted ICBT for an OCD program found to be effective in Sweden for a 
U. S. population and tested it with 40 adults with moderately severe OCD living in the New 
York metropolitan area. This adapted version of ICBT showed promise as an acceptable, 
feasible, and effective treatment for OCD.

In terms of acceptability, although some at screening were not interested in ICBT and others 
were not eligible, 70% of participants who enrolled in ICBT completed the entire 10-module 
program within the 12-week treatment window. Reasons for not completing included loss of 
interest in treatment, loss of computer access, and worsening OCD symptoms. Importantly, 
the dropout rate in the present trial (30%) appeared higher than that reported in Swedish 
trials (12.0–12.5%; Andersson et al., 2011, 2012), suggesting that ICBT may be less 
acceptable for some individuals in the United States. On the other hand, qualitative data 
from our study indicated that some of our participants (15 out of 40) preferred ICBT to face-
to-face treatment because it was more convenient in their busy lives. Together, these data 
suggest that ICBT may not be acceptable to all, but may be an attractive option for many. 
Importantly, among those who completed treatment, a majority reported being satisfied with 
the treatment program (based on the CSQ). Notably, although our sample was primarily non-
Hispanic White, our sample included a much higher proportion of non-White participants 
(20%) as compared to prior OCD treatment trials, where a recent review included on average 
only 8.5% non-White participants (range = 0–13%; Williams, Powers, Yun, & Foa, 2010).

The possibility that ICBT may be a more acceptable option for minority participants who 
have been greatly underrepresented in OCD treatment trials deserves future study.

Our trial also suggests that ICBT is a feasible and resource-efficient treatment option. 
Specifically, ICBT used less therapist time than traditional face-to-face treatments. Thus, 
ICBT could enable therapists to expand their caseloads, allowing more patients access to 
their care. Moreover, ICBT can also increase access to care given that it may be conducted 
remotely. Importantly, lack of access to clinicians experienced in treating OCD is frequently 
cited as a barrier to receiving care (Marques et al., 2010), particularly in rural areas with few 
providers.

We also found it is feasible to deliver ICBT using a treatment team of therapists, most of 
whom had a range of experience with EX/RP and were provided a therapist manual and 
received weekly supervision by an EX/RP expert. This model may provide one way to 
maximize therapist resources and expertise in the treatment of OCD and provide an efficient 
way to ensure that patients receive EX/RP with high treatment integrity. In this respect, 
ICBT may be similar to face-to-face CBT for OCD, in which more junior clinicians (with 
little specific OCD experience) appear to perform as well as more experienced colleagues 
when using a treatment manual and expert supervision (Franklin, Abramowitz, Furr, Kalsy, 
& Riggs, 2003)

In terms of treatment effectiveness, we found that ICBT was associated with significant 
improvement in OCD symptoms, as well as depression severity and quality of life. Similar 
to trials conducted in Sweden (Andersson et al., 2012), ICBT was associated with large 
within-group effect sizes for reducing OCD symptoms, and medium effect sizes for 
improving depression and quality of life. Moreover, the effect size for reducing OCD 
symptoms was within the range reported in trials of face-to-face CBT for OCD (Skapinakis 
et al., 2016) and larger than most trials with computer-based treatments that did not provide 
therapist support (Bachofen et al., 1999; Greist et al., 1998, 2002; Kenwright et al., 2005; 
Moritz et al., 2011; Seol et al., 2016; Tolin et al., 2007; Wootton et al., 2011). Although we 
did not control for outside treatment during the follow-up period, we found preliminary 
evidence that the benefit of ICBT was maintained in this sample 4 months after the treatment 
was completed. In addition, more than half of those who completed the ICBT treatment 
experienced reliably significant change, and approximately one quarter of completers 
achieved posttreatment OCD severity scores previously used as a marker of wellness (low 
symptoms and restored functioning). These data suggest that for some individuals, a brief 
course of ICBT may prove to be a sufficiently intense intervention to achieve remission from 
OCD. For others, ICBT may lead to smaller improvements, but could be helpful as a 
preliminary step before a more intensive treatment (i.e., face-to-face). Thus, ICBT can be 
considered as a low-intensity option offered as a first-line intervention in a stepped-care 
model.

Our results should be understood within the context of study limitations. First, as this was a 
pilot study, there was no randomization to a control condition, which rendered it difficult to 
claim that any improvements were caused by the treatment alone. However, OCD is 
regarded as a stable and often chronic disease (Kessler et al., 2005; Murray & Lopez, 1996)

and with a low response rate to placebo (Huppert et al., 2004)—thus, we believe it is 
unlikely the overall treatment results were due to time alone. Second, as did the ICBT pilot 
trial in Sweden, we excluded severe OCD (Y-BOCS > 30) and excluded serious mental 
illness and substance use disorders. In subsequent randomized trials of ICBT, the effects of 
ICBT have been tested without an upper limit on the Y-BOCS (Andersson et al., 2015)—
however, the effects of ICBT in individuals with extreme OCD remains untested in the 
United States. Future work should test the effectiveness of ICBT in the broader OCD patient 
population to determine whether it works equally well for all OCD patients. If ICBT is most 
effective in those patients with relatively mild to moderate OCD who prefer ICBT as a 
treatment modality, then ICBT may be offered as a first step in a stepped-care system, in 
which more resource-intensive options are offered to more severely ill patients.

Conclusions

In summary, this study provides preliminary evidence that ICBT is effective and feasible to 
implement in the United States. ICBT provides a potentially cost-effective, flexible, and 
patient-centered treatment program for individuals with OCD to access and receive care in 
their own community. Yet substantial future research on this treatment modality is needed. 
Specifically, to ensure that the treatment benefits of ICBT are specific to this intervention a 
randomized trial could compare ICBT with another potential intervention (i.e., online 
anxiety management training). At the same time, effectiveness trials could be done to test 
the acceptability of ICBT in community practice. Finally, ICBT should be tested with a 
broader range of patients and in comparison to face-to-face CBT. This direct comparison 
might allow for analysis of treatment moderators and predictors, in order to determine who 
is likely to benefit from ICBT and who may instead require face-to-face treatment. In this 
way, future implementation could explore ways to integrate ICBT with other recommended 
treatment options (e.g., medications) in a stepped-care model.
