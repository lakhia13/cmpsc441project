Mania, the diagnostic hallmark of bipolar disorder, is an episodic disturbance of mood, sleep, behavior, and perception. Improved
understanding of the neurobiology of mania is expected to allow for novel avenues to address current challenges in its diagnosis
and treatment. Previous research focusing on the impairment of functional neuronal circuits and brain networks has resulted in
heterogenous ﬁndings, possibly due to a focus on bipolar disorder and its several phases, rather than on the unique context of
mania. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the evidence regarding the functional neuroanatomy of mania. Our
interpretation of the best available evidence is consistent with a convergent model of lateralized circuit dysfunction in mania, with
hypoactivity of the ventral prefrontal cortex in the right hemisphere, and hyperactivity of the amygdala, basal ganglia, and anterior
cingulate cortex in the left hemisphere of the brain. Clariﬁcation of dysfunctional neuroanatomic substrates of mania may
contribute not only to improve understanding of the neurobiology of bipolar disorder overall, but also highlights potential avenues
for new circuit-based therapeutic approaches in the treatment of mania.

INTRODUCTION
Mania is an episodic disturbance of mood, sleep, behavior, and
perception. It is characterized by expansive, elated and/or irritable
mood,
impaired
thinking, and poor judgment [1]. Importantly, the recurrence of
such episodes has been identiﬁed as the diagnostic hallmark of
bipolar disorder (BPD) and other bipolar spectrum disorders,
estimated to affect 3–6% of the world population [2]. Due to its
impact on patient functioning, commonly resulting in clinical,
interpersonal, ﬁnancial, and even legal consequences, mania is
considered a very debilitating mental health condition, not only
for patients suffering from this mood disorder but also for their
family and friends [3].

Despite such relevant effects on patient well-being [4],
diagnosis and treatment of mania is still a clinical challenge
[5, 6], possibly due to a poor understanding of the underlying
neurobiology [7, 8]. Different potential mechanisms for the

pathophysiology of affective disorders,
been suggested. These include the dysregulation of synaptic
neurotransmission, namely that of glutamate and its action on
NMDA receptors [9, 10], which have also been shown to be
promising treatment targets for affective disorders [11, 12]. On
the other hand, dysregulation of synaptic plasticity, impacted at
the molecular
level by impaired function of microRNAs in
translational regulation, has also been suggested as another
potential mechanism [13]. Furthermore, several authors have
proposed a neuroanatomical dysfunction substrate for mania

context of mania, with heterogenous and sometimes even
contradictory ﬁndings. In fact, the cause for ambiguity in these
ﬁndings may lay on the differences between trait- and state-
dependent changes, which have been reported across several
neuropsychiatric disorders [15], but may be particularly relevant
in episodic mood disorders such as BPD. Here, some changes
may occur only during an acute episode of mood disturbance
and disappear once the symptoms remit (i.e., state) while other
changes may be present during acute episodes as well as during
euthymia (i.e.,

[16]. Ultimately,
characteristics of mania, depression, mixed episodes, and
euthymia observed in patients with BPD may be reﬂected also
in differences in neuroimaging ﬁndings, contributing towards a
lack of clarity regarding the unique functional neuroanatomy
substrate of mania [16].

Disentangling the speciﬁcities of dysfunctional neuroanatomy
in mania would be an invaluable contribution to the ﬁeld. First,
it would help to ﬁnd state-dependent biomarkers that may
assist in the differential diagnosis of mania, depression, and
euthymia, and, most importantly, also in more challenging cases
such as mixed affective episodes, subthreshold (hypo)mania, or
latent bipolarity in unipolar depression [17]. Second, it would
contribute to the overall understanding of BPD neurobiology
and its neural pathophysiology. Finally, it may ultimately also
guide research of speciﬁc innovative treatment strategies for
mania [18, 19]. The current manuscript, rather than a systematic
review of the current literature, is a comprehensive overview of
the evidence regarding the functional neuroanatomy of mania.
It aims to summarize the best available evidence, creating a
convergent model for mania circuit dysfunction, while subse-
quently highlighting potential avenues for development of new
therapeutic approaches for mania.

METHODS
The search was performed on MEDLINE/PubMed and Google
Scholar between December 2020 and April 2021. Search terms
were: “Functional” AND “Neuroanatomy” AND “Mania”. Articles in
English, French, Portuguese, or Spanish were considered, regard-
less of the publication date or country of origin. To be considered
in our review, articles had to report functional neuroimaging
ﬁndings, namely functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT), in patients with bipolar disorder,
during a manic episode. Clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control
studies, case series, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis were
included. While evidence from single case reports was excluded,
their reference lists were screened for additional articles, as were
those from the included articles

Disrupted functional brain networks in primary mania
Functional neuroanatomy of mania has been obtained from
different neuroimaging studies, conducted mainly in patients with
primary idiopathic mania, the majority of cases of mania, where a
clear medical or toxic cause for the episode cannot be identiﬁed.
The neuroimaging approaches used have mostly varied from fMRI
to PET, taking advantage of several task-based and resting-state
protocols [20–22]. Furthermore, different research designs have
also been explored to clarify dysfunctional circuits associated with
mania, through comparisons of patients with mania with healthy
subjects, with the euthymic state, and/or with other neuropsy-
chiatric syndromes, such as unipolar or bipolar depression [21, 22].
When considering the results from previously published meta-
analyses addressing functional neuroimaging ﬁndings in mania,
key limbic regions were shown to have impaired activity in
patients with mania when compared to healthy volunteers.
Speciﬁcally, Chen and colleagues, based on 8 studies, reported
that in mania compared to healthy the inferior frontal gyrus, i.e.,
Brodmann Area (BA) 47, was hypoactive bilaterally, with a
predominance on the right side, while the left thalamus was
hyperactive [22]. Moreover, Hajek and colleagues,
in a meta-
imaging studies involving response-
analysis of 10 functional
inhibition paradigms, further conﬁrmed that patients with mania
showed lower activation not only in right inferior frontal gyrus
(BA47) but also in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA9), and greater
activation in the right insula (BA13) and bilateral basal ganglia [23].
Interestingly, in this meta-analysis, but not in Chen et al., lower
activation of right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47), was found in
bipolar disorder irrespective of mood state (euthymia or mania),
suggesting that right inferior frontal gyrus hypoactivation should
be further explored as a potential trait marker for bipolar disorder.
Conversely, while Hajek et al. did not report signiﬁcant changes in
amygdalae, Chen et al. showed decreased activity of the right
amygdala and increased activity of the left amygdala, alongside
other meso-temporal structures such as parahippocampal gyrus
and hippocampus, when considering jointly studies including
mania and euthymia. Some reports of the functional neuroanat-
omy of mania were not included in these meta-analyses, possibly
due to exclusion criteria related to experimental design, such as
type of neuroimaging modality or even speciﬁc task paradigms.
Additionally, since the publication of these meta-analyses, more
studies reporting on functional neuroimaging ﬁndings in the
context of mania have been published. For a more complete
understanding of the functional neuroanatomy of mania, the
results of these studies are also included in Table 1.

rather, decreased activation of the right amygdala was observed
[27]. Together, these ﬁndings support the hypothesis that activity
imbalance between left (elevated) and right (reduced) amygdalae
is an important functional neuroimaging correlate of mania [28].
However, it is important to also consider that another study has
shown a bilateral reduction in amygdala activity in mania relative
to healthy subjects [29], and others have failed to show any
pattern of differences in amygdala activation in mania relative to
healthy subjects [14, 30]. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to
explore, across studies, potential differences in the right-left

hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus of patients with mania,
during cognitive and emotion-associated tasks, when comparing
with healthy subjects and to euthymia [27, 31]. Overall, these
ﬁndings support that activity in the amygdala and other meso-
temporal hubs of emotional networks in the limbic system
[16, 32–34] is dysregulated in mania, with most studies pointing
towards increased activity in the left hemisphere or decreased

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has also been consistently reported
as a key region for the regulation of emotional behavior [32], and
its dysfunction has been associated with mood disorders [35].
Noteworthy, the PFC is a complex structure [36] that, in addition to
contributing to emotional regulation, has also been associated with
different cognitive functions, such as working memory, attention,
reward appraisal, and decision-making, functions that are sup-
ported by multiple reciprocal connections to distinct brain regions
[36, 37]. Probably due to such multi-domain functions, while PFC
has been persistently implicated in the functional neuroanatomy of
[38].
mania,
Nevertheless,
in fMRI and PET studies, assessing response to
emotional stimuli [24, 26, 27, 39], response-inhibition tasks [31], and
decision-making paradigms [40], the most consistent ﬁndings in
mania relative to healthy subjects have been reduced activation on
the right side of the brain or bilaterally in the ventrolateral
prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a brain region including the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC, also designated as Brodmann area (BA)
47 or BA47/12 due to correspondence of human BA47 to monkey
BA12 [36, 41–44]; also see Fig. 1]. Similarly, in mania relative to
healthy subjects, reduced activation has also been described in the
right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a heterogenous brain
region that includes parts of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
namely BA25 and BA32, the middle frontal gyrus, namely BA10,
and regions of the medial OFC (mOFC), such as BA11, BA12, and
BA14 [36, 40, 44, 45]
in a PET study,
hypoactivity of the right BA10 and right BA11, areas included in
VMPFC, was also observed during a word generation task when
patients with mania were compared to euthymic state [46].
Moreover, in the same study, hypoactivity of the right BA10 and
bilateral OFC, during a word generation task and in resting state,
respectively, was also detected when patients with mania were
compared to healthy subjects [46]. These results further support
that under-activation of these regions may be a neuroimaging
in what possibly reﬂects the
biomarker of mania. However,
complex roles of the PFC in human behavior, in another study,
when compared to healthy subjects, patients with mania had both
decreased and increased activation of left VMPFC and VLPFC,
during gain and loss expectation states, respectively, in a reward
decision-making task [47]. Furthermore, in fMRI during a working
memory task, patients with mania had increased activation of the
VMPFC bilaterally, relative to healthy subjects, while the activity of
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was reduced [48].
Considering all the evidence above,
it seems that the PFC is
hypoactive in patients with mania, particularly in the right
hemisphere, in certain cognitive and decision-making contexts.

Fig. 1 Neuroanatomy of ventrolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. While there is variability in the nomenclature and in the
organization of ventrolateral (A) and ventromedial prefrontal cortices (B), this diagram represents previously suggested models [36, 40–45] for
the neuroanatomy of these structures, focusing on regions and areas that are critical for interpretation of the functional neuroanatomy
of mania.

Another region of

interest that has been reported to be
impaired in mood disorders [35, 49], including mania [35], is the
cingulate cortex, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
also designated as BA24, 25, and 32 [50] (Fig. 1). In fact, these
brain regions have been considered part of the VMPFC, and their
role has been implicated in several functions related to the PFC
[45]. Hence, as is the case for the prefrontal cortex, a role for the
ACC within a global vision for the functional neuroanatomy of
mania has been difﬁcult to establish [38]. When comparing
patients with mania and healthy controls in fMRI studies, the
former had reduced activation of the ACC in a Go-No Go task [31]
and in response to emotional cues [29], but increased activation
in working memory [48] and response-inhibition tasks [51]. On
the other hand,
in PET studies, patients with mania had
increased activation of left ACC in resting state [35] and during
a decision-making task [40], relative to healthy subjects, as well
as when compared to euthymia [52].
in patients
with both unipolar and bipolar depression, ACC activity was
found to be decreased in similar conditions [35]. Moreover, as
described above for the left amygdala [25], there is a positive
association between left ACC activity and severity of mania
symptoms [40]. Thus, there is evidence for left-sided hyper-
activity of the ACC in mania, while in certain conditions this area
can be inappropriately hypoactivated.

Importantly,

Several subcortical structures have also been implicated in mania
circuit dysfunction, the basal ganglia in particular [14, 22, 38].

Patients with mania had increased activity in the left basal ganglia,
namely the globus pallidus and caudate, in a reaction-time task [53]
and in response to affective simuli [27], when compared to healthy
subjects, as well as bipolar depression [53] and euthymia [52].
Interestingly, and similar
to what was described above for
lateralized dysfunction of the amygdala, reduced activation of the
right caudate in a reaction-time task was found in mania when
compared to bipolar depression [53]. Nevertheless, the available
evidence is mostly supportive of hyperactivity of the left basal
ganglia in mania, supporting the importance of such structures in
the regulation of emotional behavior [54, 55]. While other cortical
and subcortical regions have also been implicated in the functional
neuroanatomy of mania, these ﬁndings have not been consistently
replicated, and cannot be appropriately interpreted in the current
state of the art. Among others, they include not only increased
activation of left supplementary motor area [53], left insula [29], and
bilateral posterior cingulate [29] but also reduced activation of right
primary motor cortex [53], right posterior cingulate [47], supple-
mentary motor area [48], bilateral parietal cortex [48], bilateral [48]
or left [51] precuneus, left middle temporal gyrus [51], left [51] and
right [53] thalamus, and bilateral nucleus accumbens [56].

Noteworthy, three studies reported functional neuroimaging
changes before and after mania treatment,
in mania vs.
euthymic state, using within-subject analyses. Two of these studies
reported bilateral VMPFC (BA11) hyperactivity that remained after
treatment [27, 48], suggesting that this may be a potential trait

biomarker for bipolar disorder. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with
the third longitudinal study reporting that, in a reward decision-
making task, patients with mania no longer showed activity
changes in left VMPFC and VLPFC after symptom remission [47].
Such heterogeneity of results supports a complex role for the
VMPFC in the functional neuroanatomy of mania, further supported
by the fact that,
in response to certain stimuli, BA10/BA11 is
hypoactive in patients with mania compared to a different group of
euthymic patients, using between-subject analyses [46], while in
response to other stimuli BA11 is inappropriately activated in
patients with bipolar disorder, irrespective of mood state [27, 48].
These longitudinal studies have also suggested candidates for state
markers of mania, that were not observed when patients entered
euthymia. In fact, in comparisons to euthymic state, patients during
mania were reported to have decreased activation in left DLPFC/
precentral cortex (BA6) and bilateral superior parietal cortex/
precuneus (BA7) by some authors [48], or in the right hippocampus
and right amygdala by others [27]. Moreover, considering that left
amygdala hyperactivity is a consistent ﬁnding in mania [24–26], it is
also reasonable to consider that imbalanced activity between the
left (elevated) and right (reduced) amygdalae may be a more
accurate correlate of mania [28]. Further and better powered
longitudinal studies, with experimental designs explicitly assessing
differences in activity between the right and left hemispheres, are
necessary to clarify potential roles for the activity of these brain
regions as state markers of mania, or trait markers of bipolar
disorder, ideally while resolving conﬂicting ﬁndings from previous
studies [27, 46]

From the evidence presented above, in meta-analyses as well as
several of the individual original studies, we hypothesize that
mania is characterized by lateralized dysfunction of the limbic
system, mainly involving the left amygdala, right (or bilateral)
ventral PFC, left ACC, and left basal ganglia (Fig. 2). Not surprisingly,
reciprocal connections between many of
in
the amygdala and PFC, have been shown to be
particular
disrupted. Relative to healthy controls,
in patients with mania,
the left amygdala was more negatively connected to the left ACC
and right VMPFC [26], but less connected to the left caudate and
putamen [57], and left [57] or bilateral [26] VLPFC, while the right
amygdala was more connected to the right hippocampus [57].
Interestingly, negative connectivity from the left amygdala to
bilateral VLPFC was negatively associated with mania symptom

severity [26]. Moreover, in patients with mania, both amygdalae
were less connected not only to the ACC in comparisons with
euthymic patients with bipolar disorder [58], but also to the VLPFC
and striatum in comparisons with healthy controls [57]. Finally,
within PFC regions, patients with mania had increased positive
connectivity between the right VLPFC and bilateral medial PFC,
and reduced negative connectivity between bilateral medial PFC
and bilateral DLPFC, when compared to healthy subjects and
patients with schizophrenia [59], while the ACC was less connected
to the left OFC in comparisons with healthy volunteers [60]. There
is evidence that the prefrontal cortex modulates amygdala and
striatal responses to emotional contexts and cues [61, 62], the net
result of which has been associated with emotional behavior
correlates [63], and with disruption of these connections possibly
associated with affective disorders [26]. We thus propose that,
during mania, a disconnection between the amygdala and
prefrontal cortex [26, 32] may lead to hypoactivation of the ventral
PFC, on the right hemisphere or bilaterally. Lateralized hypoactivity
of the PFC may ultimately fail to modulate left amygdala activity,
generating overt hyperactivity of left-sided limbic structures such
as the ACC and basal ganglia, which also have impaired
connections with the amygdala [26, 57, 58]. Nevertheless, as has
been previously supported by Wang and colleagues [64], future
studies focusing speciﬁcally on functional connectivity patterns in
mania and bipolar disorder may contribute towards identifying
biomarkers for these conditions, while clarifying the role of these
connections in the neurobiology of emotions.

Interestingly, and while the development of adequate animal
models of mania has been challenging [65–68], our hypothesis is
further supported by evidence obtained in animal work. In proxies
of affective and cognitive features of mania, such as response
inhibition,
impulsivity, and hedonic state assessed by sucrose
preference [67, 69, 70], the PFC, namely OFC and ACC, as well as the
amygdala, have been consistently implicated. When these brain
regions are disturbed, animals have shown mania-like behavior,
such as impulsivity,
increased motor activity, or increased goal-
directed activity [71–76]. For example, amygdala lesions were
associated to greater impulsivity while OFC lesions had the opposite
effect, increasing preference for larger but delayed rewards [72].
Such ﬁndings suggest that OFC is involved in evaluating the
incentive value of outcomes [72] and disrupting/modulating its
activity was associated with impaired response-inhibition and

impulsive behavior [71]. Moreover, other regions have also been
associated with persistent impulsive behavior when lesioned in
animal models, such as nucleus accumbens core [77, 78], which has
also been reported to be dysfunctional in mania [56]. Interestingly,
mania has also been associated to reward appraisal disturbances
and impaired response inhibition, which may explain the occur-
rence of disinhibition and increased goal-directed activity observed
in patients during acute manic episodes [56]. Future research in
animal models assessing different behavior and cognitive con-
structs relevant to mania, such as reward responsiveness, reward
learning, reward valuation, cognitive control, or social communica-
tion, according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework
[79], may provide further insight in the functional neuroanatomy of
mania. While most studies including animal models do not focus on
the association of speciﬁc cognitive functions with lateralized brain
regions, one demonstrated that right-sided brain lesions were
predominantly associated with hyperactivity, a symptom also
observed in mania [76]. Noteworthy, the proposed model of
lateralized dysconnectivity and dysfunction in mania also aligns
with the mood laterality theory, a classical vision of
the
neurobiology of emotions [80, 81]. This theory suggests that
emotional functions are lateralized in the brain, with negative and
positive emotions associated with the function of the right and left
brain hemispheres, respectively [80]. For example, when studying
food-reward processing in healthy volunteers, activation of both the
amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in the left hemisphere was
observed as a response to highly motivating incentives [82].
Interestingly, mania has been associated with an elevation of
achievement motivation [8], and the mood laterality theory is thus
consistent with left-side overactivity [24–26] and right-sided
impairment [31, 83–87] in mania. Moreover, it is also in agreement
with structural ﬁndings in neuroimaging studies of bipolar disorder
(for a comprehensive review please see Blond et al. 2012 [16]).

it relies on a blood-
oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, an indirect measure of
activity that is obtained in different contexts, tasks, and/or
time-points [20]. Depending on the design, fMRI studies can
lead to inconsistent ﬁndings due to the impact of tasks [14]
and/or reliability of BOLD signals [88]. On the other hand,
despite being a closer reﬂection of brain metabolism, PET has
low spatial resolution and, given the use of ionizing radiation,
may not be applied multiple times [20, 89]. These potential
limitations highlight that additional research strategies merit
consideration to help clarify the functional neuroanatomy
of mania.

features may signal

From anatomy to function in lesional mania
While most mania episodes occur in the context of primary
idiopathic BPD, patients may develop manic symptoms secondary
to organic insults such as brain lesions,
is typically
designated as lesional mania. Common causes of lesional mania
include stroke, traumatic brain injury, or tumors [90]. While several
clinical
lesional mania,
distinguishing this condition from primary BPD is a clinical challenge
[91], and the similarity of their clinical proﬁles has been used to
suggest that studying lesional mania can be an important approach
to understand the functional neuroanatomy of mania [92]. In fact, in
the context where brain lesions occur prior to mania, the association
between brain structure change and clinical presentation is much
clearer, allowing to highlight networks that may be missed in
functional neuroimaging studies, or resolve conﬂicting ﬁndings
[91, 93]. Importantly, one should be mindful that lesion locations, in

the possibility of

the vast majority of cases, can be interpreted as equivalent to
inactive or hypoactive brain regions [91].

In one of the ﬁrst and largest case series of lesional mania,
lesions were commonly located in the right thalamus, right
caudate, right orbitofrontal, and right basotemporal cortices, while
in cases of lesional depression the affected areas were more
widely distributed on the left hemisphere [94]. A later study with a
smaller case series reported similar ﬁndings, additionally showing
that there was a decrease in 18Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in right
basotemporal and right superior frontal areas, even when those
regions were not directly insulted [95]. These results led to the
hypothesis that mania may be associated with a functional circuit
encompassing the orbitofrontal cortex, basotemporal cortex, and
basal ganglia [81, 83, 94–102]. It is noteworthy that these regions
overlap with functional neuroimaging ﬁndings in primary mania
described above. More recently, we systematically revised the
available literature on lesional mania, and performed pooled
analyses of all published cases [92]. We conﬁrmed that lesions
causing mania were over-represented in the right relative to the
left hemisphere, namely in several mesiotemporal and temporal
regions, as well as the basal ganglia and thalamus. Given the
predominance of
lesions in the right hemisphere, additional
comparisons were performed with a control cohort of right
hemisphere lesions [103], to conﬁrm that the topography of
lesional mania is not biased by the normative distribution of brain
lesions. In addition to mesiotemporal and temporal regions and
the thalamus, patients with lesional mania had larger lesions in
ventral areas of the prefrontal cortex, with the latter affected
bilaterally rather than predominantly on the right side. Interest-
ingly, while the basal ganglia structures have been consistently
reported to be associated with lesional mania [91], these regions
were not identiﬁed in the comparisons with control
lesions.
Nevertheless, our ﬁndings support that lesions leading to mania
are not randomly distributed, and preferentially affect hubs of the
mania circuit proposed above [81, 83, 94–102].

overlapping lesion locations can be associated with the same
clinical syndrome, a constraint that has been observed in several
lesional neuropsychiatric syndromes [104, 105], including mania
[92]. In fact, as suggested previously [95], the emergence of a
clinical syndrome can result from physiological changes in distant
regions preserved from the original
lesion, but nevertheless
connected to the lesion location, a phenomenon known as
diaschisis [106]. Lesion network mapping is a recently developed
neuroimaging methodology, developed to address this phenom-
enon [107], that takes advantageous of normative connectomes
[108, 109] to highlight regions that are functionally connected to
each lesion location, thus resulting in brain network maps. Two
studies have applied this approach to lesional mania [110, 111].
Lee and colleagues showed that the temporal lobe and OFC, on
both sides of the brain, were more functionally connected to
lesion locations associated with mania than control lesions, with
the possibility of negative connectivity with the DLPFC, also
bilaterally, suggested. In the same study, exploring these ﬁndings
in independent cohorts of primary bipolar disorder patients, the

authors compared mania and euthymia to show that
temporal
lobes had decreased connectivity to the VLPFC, and
to suggest that the left amygdala may have increased con-
nectivity with the DLPFC, bilaterally [110]. We participated in
another study, with a larger connectome and larger mania and
control cohorts, in order to improve the speciﬁcity of the resulting
lesional mania connectivity map. Across multiple lesion cohorts,
we found that lesion locations associated with mania, when
compared to control lesions, were more connected to the right
OFC (VLPFC; BA47), right inferior temporal gyrus, and right frontal
pole (VMPFC; BA11) [111].

targets to treat or avoid mania.

The evidence across lesional mania studies further supports our
hypothesis of lateralized functional disruption of the limbic system
in mania (Fig. 2). The ﬁndings of direct lesions, or potential indirect
effects of lesions, affecting, among others, mesiotemporal and
ventral prefrontal areas to cause mania [92, 110, 111], highlight
the importance of left amygdala overactivation and right ventral
PFC hypoactivation associated with primary mania. Nevertheless,
it is important to consider that, when interpreting the results of
lesional studies, one should consider that these approaches ignore
post-lesional neuronal tissue remodeling and cerebral dynamic
recovery processes. Moreover,

functional neuroanatomic substrate of a neuropsychiatric disorder.

Functional neuroanatomy of mania as a target of therapeutic

The ultimate goal of exploring and formulating a functional
neuroanatomic and neurobiological model of mania is
its
potential use in guiding new treatment strategies (Fig. 3).
Speciﬁcally,
the model we have proposed above for circuit
dysfunction in mania i.e., reduced activity of right ventral PFC
and increased activity of the left amygdala, left ACC, and left basal
ganglia, may support the use of these critical hubs as potential
targets for therapeutic brain stimulation strategies (Fig. 2). In fact,
as described in this section, the dysfunctional brain network of
mania proposed above aligns with previously reported effects of
non-invasive brain stimulation on mania symptoms.

thought

High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-
rTMS),
to positively modulate the targeted regions
[112, 113] has shown beneﬁcial effects in mania, when applied
to the right DLPFC [18, 114–116]. On the other hand, HF-rTMS and
anodal transcranial direct stimulation (a-tDCS) of the left DLPFC,
both used to treat episodes of major depression [117], may result
in manic symptoms as side effects [118–124]. Since DLPFC is

functionally connected to VMPFC, and speciﬁcally the ACC [125–
127], it may be an “entry point” to the dysfunctional mania circuit
described above, particularly given the lateralization of pro-manic
and anti-manic effects of focal DLPFC stimulation.
In our own
previous work, we have explored the potential functional impact
of non-invasive brain stimulation treatment strategies considering
the lesional mania network map developed when comparing
mania with control lesions [111]. Consistently with clinical effects,
we found that the left and right DLPFC had opposite connectivity
to this map, which includes the right VLPFC (OFC; BA47) and the
right VMPFC (frontal pole; BA11). When considered jointly, the
ﬁndings mentioned above further support the hypothesis that
modulation of DLPFC activity impacts VLPFC and VMPFC function.
Hence, if treatment targets in DLPFC are optimized, supported by
the functional neuroanatomy model of mania, enhanced efﬁcacy
and/or fewer side effects may be obtained in neuromodulatory
treatment of affective disorders, including mania. Furthermore, in
our previous work, optimal targets were additionally suggested for
future use in non-invasive brain stimulation trials for mania, not
only both in right (MNI 20, 36, 52) and left (MNI −20, 2, 64 and
−36, 44, 38) prefrontal cortices but also right orbitofrontal cortex
(MNI 42, 42, −20) [111]. Exploring new rTMS treatment targets will
certainly have signiﬁcant clinical implications. In addition to relief
of core mania symptoms [18, 114–116], the proposed anti-suicidal
effects of rTMS [128] may contribute towards avoiding suicide in
the context of bipolar disorder [129].

Mania has also been reported as a side effect of deep brain
stimulation (DBS), a different strategy for
therapeutic brain
stimulation. DBS-induced mania has been reported following
stimulation of ventral capsule/ventral
striatum (VC/VS) or
subthalamic nucleus
in patients with obsessive-
compulsive disorder [130] or Parkinson’s disease [131], respec-
tively, and has been associated to lower DBS efﬁcacy [130, 131].
Similar to what was described for TMS and tDCS targets, we
found that VC/VS [132–135] and STN [136–138]
locations
associated with DBS-induced mania were more connected to

ventromedially located are more functional connected to right
OFC and associated with disinhibited behavior, a core symptom
of mania [141, 142]. Future studies should be conducted to
improve the understanding of DBS-induced mania neurobiology,
namely exploring which brain connectivity networks are
impaired and if they truly converge with the proposed functional
neuroanatomic model of mania. As in TMS and tDCS, such
ﬁndings could lead to great improvements in DBS treatment
planning, increasing DBS efﬁcacy while avoiding the emergence
of undesirable neuropsychiatric side effects.

Mood laterality and hemispheric imbalance in mania
Emotions are core human experiences [32] and, as mentioned
above, their neurobiology has been historically associated to
lateralized brain function,
in the so-called mood laterality
hypothesis [80, 81]. According to this theory, negative and
positive emotions are linked to the right and left brain hemi-
sphere, respectively [80]. In part, this theory is based on the fact
that left-sided brain impairment is predominantly associated with
depressive episodes [94, 143–145], while manic syndromes are
more associated with right-sided dysfunction [31, 83–87]. Similar
polarized behavior phenotypes have also been observed in animal
models with analogous lateralized brain damage [76]. Additionally,
this hypothesis has also been supported by the clinical efﬁcacy
[18, 114–116, 118, 119] and the side-effects proﬁle [118–124]
observed in lateralized non-invasive brain stimulation techniques
that are used to treat affective disorders [112, 113, 117]. Never-
the mood laterality theory cannot be interpreted
theless,
assuming an all-or-nothing rationale i.e., only left-sided brain
structures are associated with positive emotions and vice-versa.
Such a view not only is a clear overgeneralization [91] but may
also ignore other theories of the neurobiology of emotion [146].
Instead, many authors have suggested focusing on a right-left
imbalance on key brain structures [28, 81, 83, 91, 94–102], a
possibility that we believe is supported by available ﬁndings on
the functional neuroanatomy of mania.

While altered structure and function of the right brain have been

distribution, with speciﬁc limbic regions consistently affected
[16, 86, 92, 111, 147–153]. In fact, the evidence regarding brain
regions affected unilaterally in both primary and lesional mania is
consistent with data supporting the mood laterality hypothesis
[80, 81]. The right VMPFC and VLPFC, which are key limbic hubs
associated with emotional behavior regulation [32, 35], were shown
to be hypoactive in mania [22, 24, 26, 27, 31, 39, 40, 46, 92, 111].
There is also evidence that right mesiotemporal structures, such as
the amygdala, as well as the right basal ganglia [27, 29, 53, 92], both
of which have also been associated with emotional behavior
[16, 32–34], are impaired in patients with mania. On the other hand,
left-sided limbic regions were shown to be overactive in mania,
namely amygdala [24–26, 110], ACC [35, 40, 48, 51, 52], and basal
ganglia [27, 52, 53], that are also critical regions in regulation of
emotional behavior [32, 35]. Hence, when right- and left-sided
ﬁndings are interpreted jointly, they suggest that, during mania,
brain activity is imbalanced, towards right-sided hypoactivity and/or
left-sided hyperactivity [91]. Conversely, as mentioned above,
caution should be taken when considering the lateralized model

evidence supports such a pattern in speciﬁc regions, a complete

In fact, some of the presented
evidence may argue for bilateral dysfunction in other key limbic
regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or basal ganglia.
Future research in patients with mania speciﬁcally studying right-
left activity imbalance, as well as connectivity pattern, in these or
other brain regions, would help conﬁrm or disprove the lateraliza-
tion hypothesis, while further exploring the potential mechanism
for its occurrence (e.g., right-left disconnection in key hubs of the
limbic circuit).

This review has potential limitations that should be considered
when interpreting its conclusions. First, rather than a systematic
literature review, it is a comprehensive overview of the evidence
regarding the functional neuroanatomy of mania. While a
systematic literature review may better account for potential
biases and limitations at the single experiment level, we have not
avoided the inconsistent ﬁndings available in the literature. In fact,
we offered potential explanations and/or future directions to
resolve conﬂicting results. Moreover, this general overview, where
we have summarized the best available evidence while creating a

Nonetheless, as proposed above, conﬂicting ﬁndings obtained in
similar regions with different task paradigms may reﬂect the
dynamics of mania neurobiology, with a speciﬁc brain region
pathologically activated or deactivated depending on the context.
Finally, at the individual study level, including lesion studies, there
is heterogeneity or lack of speciﬁcity in terminology for brain
regions, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, hindering the
convergence of ﬁndings from different studies. Additionally,
information is also lacking regarding lateralization of results, since
the side is omitted from the description of study results in some
studies. Both uniform terminology and laterality description are
critical to reach a convergent model for functional neuroanatomy
of mania, and future studies should consider these points when
reporting their results. Here, we have addressed this limitation
providing the description of each study result, while offering our
interpretation of where such ﬁndings may converge in a proposed
model for the functional neuroanatomy of mania.

CONCLUSIONS
Here, we have reviewed research supporting the hypothesis that
the functional neuroanatomy of mania is centered in lateralized
disruption of speciﬁc regions within limbic circuits. While
ﬁndings were heterogenous, as expected for a neuropsychiatric
