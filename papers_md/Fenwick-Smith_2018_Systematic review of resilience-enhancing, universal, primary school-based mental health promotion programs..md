Systematic review of resilience-enhancing,
universal, primary school-based mental
health promotion programs
Amanda Fenwick-Smith, Emma E. Dahlberg and Sandra C. Thompson*

Abstract

Background: Wellbeing and resilience are essential in preventing and reducing the severity of mental health
problems. Equipping children with coping skills and protective behavior can help them react positively to change
and obstacles in life, allowing greater mental, social and academic success. This systematic review studies the
implementation and evaluation of universal, resilience-focused mental health promotion programs based in primary
schools.
Methods: A systematic review of literature used five primary databases: PsycINFO; Web of Science; PubMed;
Medline; Embase and The Cochrane Library; and keywords related to (a) health education, health promotion,
mental health, mental health promotion, social and emotional wellbeing; (b) school health service, student, schools,
whole-school; (c) adolescent, child, school child, pre-adolescent; (d) emotional intelligence, coping behavior,
emotional adjustment, resilienc*, problem solving, to identify relevant articles. Articles included featured programs
that were universally implemented in a primary school setting and focused on teaching of skills, including coping
skills, help-seeking behaviors, stress management, and mindfulness, and were aimed at the overall goal of
increasing resilience among students.

Results: Of 3087 peer-reviewed articles initially identified, 475 articles were further evaluated with 11 reports on
evaluations of 7 school-based mental health promotion programs meeting the inclusion criteria. Evaluation tools
used in program evaluation are also reviewed, with successful trends in evaluations discussed. Encouraging results
were seen when the program was delivered by teachers within the schools. Length of programing did not seem
important to outcomes. Across all 7 programs, few long-term sustained effects were recorded following program
completion.

Conclusions: This review provides evidence that mental health promotion programs that focus on resilience and
coping skills have positive impacts on the students’ ability to manage daily stressors.

Background
This review looks at resilience-boosting mental health pro-
motion programs implemented universally at schools for
primary school-aged children (5–12 years). Wellbeing and
resilience are important in preventing and reducing the se-
verity of mental health problems. The skills of problem
solving, building and maintaining interpersonal relation-
ships, and realistic goal-setting are well-established as

enhancing an individual’s ability to contribute meaningfully
in daily life. There is substantial literature on resilience [1]
which is defined as a capacity or set of skills that allows a
person to “prevent, minimize or overcome the damaging ef-
fects of adversity” [2] and includes factors that are internal
and external to the person - emotions, behavior, biology,
development, and context affect mental health [3]. Potential
risks for poor self-esteem and mental health can be over-
come by protective factors, including one’s coping skills,
healthy family and social relationships, help-seeking behav-
iors, and meaningful activities in interactions [4].

Resilience theory states that all children, regardless of
risk or current mental health status, can benefit from
help and support
in the development of effective,
mentally-healthy strategies and resilience skills [5]. Sup-
port for and a focus on the development of children’s re-
silience skills does not lead to a risk-free life, but can
increase a child’s ability to seek support while building
their self-worth and self-efficacy. By providing children
with skills with which to cope with negative life stressors
through the promotion of resilience and protective fac-
tors, children can thrive despite obstacles [6]. An argu-
for a population approach for mental health
ment
strengthening can be extrapolated from Geoffrey Rose’s
argument that the largest number of cases of ill health
happen not in those at high risk, but in those who have
just some risk, simply because in a normal population
distribution more people (and hence adverse events) will
occur to them [7]. Since all people experience adversity
at some point in their life, teaching strategies for resili-
ent thinking would be better applied in advance to the
potential “at risk” population. The positive outcomes
and possibilities associated with strengthening children’s
resilience universally applied can act as a mitigating
approach, allowing for early support and strengthen-
ing of mental health, rather than requiring interven-
tions
in the future [8]. The
approach of boosting resilience can enhance children’s
abilities to self-protect, as well as being an effective
counter to offset the effects of maltreatment and po-
tential traumatic life events [9–11]. As such, universal
application of programs to enhance resilience stands
as not only useful for those recognized as being at
risk and who require additional mental health support
currently, but also as a protective shield for all chil-
dren moving through life.

for acute situations

Universal, school-based programing
School-based mental health promotion programs deliv-
ered to all students within a class, grade, or the entire
school are categorized as universal programs. In devel-
oped countries, all children are required to attend
school, making it an ideal setting for programs providing
key interventions for children, particularly children from
challenged families, homes and communities that may
not have easy access to community or home-based inter-
vention programs [12]. Mental health promotion pro-
grams have been developed and implemented in schools
using a variety of different approaches. Many mental ill-
ness prevention or intervention programs use a targeted
approach, focusing on children deemed at risk due to
their background, history or signs of mental health prob-
lems, usually based upon defined socio-demographic fac-
tors or certain behavioral characteristics.

Universal programs vary in their approach and imple-
mentation. Some universal programs are class-based,
with weekly sessions delivered by classroom teachers or
program staff to the entire classroom. Another universal
approach is to change the entire school environment to
be friendlier and more supportive of positive mental
health messages, and this is often implemented in com-
bination with class-based approaches [13]. Class-based,
universal mental health promotion programs vary in
their aims, focusing on different elements of cognitive or
affective skills and behaviors, environmental or cultural
factors, while increasing knowledge of mental health and
resources.

Mental health promotion programs specifically target-
ing resilience may be referred to as social and emotional
learning programs, mindfulness programs, stress man-
agement programs, or emotional wellbeing programs
and vary in terms of curriculum, length and implemen-
tation, and use of different tools and activities to convey
key themes and topics. Methods of delivery vary as well,
including the use of clinical tools, educational resources,
training of teachers and parents, changes to school sys-
tems and resources, and use of narrative tools. As such,
the curricula used in these programs vary, although all
utilize a pre-established definition of resilience and the
desired outcomes to be achieved from a social and
emotional learning program. The most effective social
and emotional learning curricula are highly interactive
and use a variety of educational tools, addressing both
specific and general skills, and are delivered in support-
ive environments [14]. Mental health promotion pro-
grams promoting resilience focus on the development
of coping skills, mindfulness, emotion recognition and
management, empathic relationships,
self-awareness
and efficacy, and help-seeking behavior. Secondary out-
comes often include decreased symptoms of anxiety,
depression, and increased academic outcomes.

Relevant research reviews
Given the importance and reach of school settings,
many reports describe universal, school-based mental
health promotion programs. Prior reviews have ex-
plored school-based mental health promotion pro-
grams in different contexts, countries, applications,
and within specific demographic parameters. There
are many reviews addressing targeted programs aimed
at suicide prevention, sexual health, substance abuse
and misuse, physical activity and nutrition improve-
ment and these often measure as secondary outcomes
changes in self-efficacy, coping and resilience skills [5,
15–17]. A number of reviews analyzing mental health
promotion programs that focus on resilience across a
range of age groups have established that school-based in-
terventions can have significant impacts on achievement,

social and emotional skills, behavior, and symptoms
of anxiety and depressive disorders [12, 16, 18]. In
their 2017 review, Dray and colleagues looked at
control-based trial evaluations of programs of univer-
sal resilience-programing in schools spanning all ages,
reporting on those that yielded significant results in
resilience factor changes. Durlak and colleagues com-
pared 213 programs, also targeting all age groups,
assessing the outcomes on attitudes, behaviors and
academic performance and analyzing effect size and
factors that moderate program outcomes. Waere and
Mind assessed the key features that make school-based
curricula successful as an approach, highlighting the
importance of social and emotional competence as
part of the curriculum within schools [12]. Another
review considered studies on mental health promotion
programs solely conducted with control and comparison
groups [19].

The current review
This review aims to inform policy, programing and
evaluation of universal, resilience-focused mental health
interventions for primary school-aged children as it fo-
cuses on the specific tools and key elements for the
population that will benefit the most from increased re-
silience in an easy-to-reach setting, aspects which have
not been highlighted in previous reviews. The multi-
tude of existing mental health promotion programs
highlights the need to establish what specific elements
and evaluations contribute to successful programing.
Unlike previous reviews, this review focuses on pro-
grams delivered solely to primary school students (aged
5–12 years), as there is evidence that the younger the
implementation of mental health promotion and resili-
ence programing, the greater the positive effect [3, 20,
21]. Rather than focusing on the program curriculum,
it considers the criteria for implementation and key ele-
ments of programing for a comprehensive intervention,
highlighting the elements of that allow for best program
fidelity and student engagement. It also describes the
criteria and outcome measures (tools and methods) used
in implementing and evaluating resilience-focused, univer-
sal school-based mental health promotion programs.

participate in at least one component of the program,
regardless of their mental health status and risk fac-
tors. Resilience is defined as a capacity or set of skills
that allows a person to “prevent, minimize or over-
come the damaging effects of adversity” [2], through
the promotion of protective factors including coping
skills,
building,
self-efficacy, help-seeking behaviors, mindfulness and
emotion literacy.

Search procedures
A preliminary review of literature revealed key terms re-
lated to resilience-focused, school-based, universal men-
tal health promotion programs. A broad search strategy
was then developed to identify relevant peer-reviewed
articles in five primary databases: PsycINFO; Web of Sci-
ence; PubMed; Medline; Embase and The Cochrane Li-
brary. The search strategy was modified as necessary for
advanced searches of each database, using keyword
search criteria: (a) health education, health promotion,
mental health, mental health promotion, social and emo-
tional wellbeing;
(b) school health service, student,
schools, whole-school; (c) adolescen*, child, school child,
pre-adolescent; (d) emotional intelligence, coping behav-
ior, emotional adjustment, resilienc*, problem solving.
Searches were conducted in September 2016 and up-
dated in May 2018. Articles were initially screened by
abstract by the lead author. All full-text articles were
reviewed by two reviewers, with additional checks and
consultations with other authors, to ensure consensus
around those articles where eligibility was less clear.
Snowball citation was used to identify other relevant
articles.

Inclusion criteria
To be included in the review, each study had to meet
the following criteria: (a) adhere to the above definition
of a universal program; (b) be based in a primary school;
(c) be delivered to children aged between 5 and 12 years
of age; (d) focus on resilience and protective factors
(meeting the above definition); (e) contain a qualitative,
quantitative or mixed-methods evaluation of the pro-
gram;
(f ) be published in English since 2002 in a
peer-reviewed journal.

Methods
Studies eligible for
inclusion were published from
2002 to 2017, describe mental health promotion pro-
grams focusing on resilience and protective factors,
and were delivered universally at schools for primary
school children aged 5–12 years. A universal program
is defined as being a program offered for a specific
all-inclusive group, whether it be the entire school,
grade or classroom. All students within the group

Exclusion criteria
Programs targeting specific behaviors where resilience is
a secondary outcome, or programs primarily focusing on
post-traumatic stress among students affected by natural
disasters or war were not included. Programs with the
ultimate goal and outcome measurements relating to a
specific behavior, emotional condition or mental illness
were not included, even if the tools taught in the inter-
vention could be classified as resilience promoting.

Fenwick-Smith et al. BMC Psychology  (2018) 6:30

Universal programs that sought to change school atmos-
phere through teacher resilience training, or increasing
school health services were not included. After-school or
recess resilience programing was not included, even if it
took place at a school. Programs that were available but
not implemented universally were not included, as the
self-selecting nature of optional programing is unlikely
to reach the most at-risk children, and such programs
do not insure a comprehensive program for all students
regardless of risk. Studies where many students were
outside of the age group and during a transition period
between different schools were not included. Resilience
programing that fits our inclusion criteria but is solely
delivered to a population that has been exposed to high
stress situations and is at risk or may develop PTSD are
not included. Unpublished dissertations, grey literature
and reports were not included.

Excluded studies
It is worth commenting upon how exclusion criteria
were applied in practice. A number of programs were
not included in this review despite having a resilience
focus, being universally-delivered and school-based be-
cause they have not been reported upon within the pre-
ceding 15 years (since 2002). Other excluded programs
had an ultimate goal that was not general mental health
promotion program, but rather aimed at addressing a
specific condition or behavior through the promotion of
certain resilience skills and protective factors. Notable
programs include the Penn Resilience Program, which
has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms through
the cognitive-behavioral therapy programing, including
the promotion of coping skills [22]. The Good Behavior
Games specifically target behavior control through the
promotion of resilience, but fall outside of the age
range of this review [23]. REACH for RESILIENCE
promotes resilience skills to prevent anxiety problems,
and targets very young children [24]. The nation-wide
Australian program, beyondblue, focuses on social and
resilience skills to prevent depression, targeting ado-
lescents [25]. Evaluations of the FRIENDS program
targets childhood anxiety
were not
through the promotion of social-emotional skills [26].
Another exclusion was the Aussie Optimism: Positive
Thinking Skills Program (AOP-PTS) which promotes so-
cial and coping skills to prevent and address depression
symptoms [27].

included as it

Article quality assessment
The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used
to assess the quality of included studies and provides a
validated method of assessing qualitative, quantitative,
and mixed methods studies. After the initial screening,
articles were scored based on the criteria for each

respective study [28]. Two researchers independently
assessed each article [29]. Of note, the tool does not ad-
dress the quality of the reporting, but only the quality of
the reported methods of the study.

Results
The initial search strategy shows that of an initial
3087 publications identified using the search terms
and following abstract assessment of 475 references,
34 articles were selected for full-text assessment. An
additional 7 articles were identified through citation
snowballing and after reading of the full-text so that
41 articles were fully assessed for eligibility. A total of
11 studies reporting on 7 programs met all the inclu-
sion criteria (Fig. 1), with key characteristics including
MMAT scores recorded (Table 1). The most common
reasons for exclusion were: focus on trauma, incorrect
age group or target population; not meeting our def-
inition of universal programs; and lack of focus on re-
silience and protective factors. Included articles. Key
elements of each program’s curriculum and imple-
mentation are shown (Table 2).

Aim of the program
The aims of the seven programs (reported on in eleven
articles) included varied in their approach to resilience
and the protective factors they sought to address. All six
programs sought to increase social and emotional com-
petencies with the ultimate aim of increasing mental
wellbeing and future protection from risks. Six articles,
addressing 2 different programs, Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction and Zippy’s Friends, specifically sought
to improve psychological functioning with the goal of
ameliorating the negative effects of stress and increasing
coping skills [30–35]. The RALLY program aimed at in-
creasing the prevalence of resilience protective factors in
students, with a particular focus on academic outcomes
and learning potential [36] while the Up program, a so-
cial and emotional competencies program, aimed at en-
hancing existing competencies and decreasing inequity
in social and emotional competencies across socioeco-
nomic lines [37]. The You Can Do It! (YCDI!) Education
program sought to ameliorate children’s ability to posi-
tively control their emotions in daily life [38]. All pro-
grams sought to improve the outcomes of one or more
protective factors, hypothesizing increased resilience as a
result. A strong emphasis on increased coping skills and
strategies as well as improved relationships was evident
in all the programs.

Target population
Universal programs demand the application of
the
program to an entire cohort of students, but how
that was done varied from delivering the program to

Fenwick-Smith et al. BMC Psychology  (2018) 6:30

an entire class, across an entire grade or across mul-
tiple schools. As such, sample size varied signifi-
cantly between studies. Details of sample populations
(Table 1) show all but two studies were implemented
and evaluated across multiple schools, with ten of
eleven conducted across multiple classrooms [30–35,
37–39]. Age groups varied across the programs, with 4
studies addressing populations 10 years and above [30, 36,
38, 39], and 6 studies addressing populations younger
than 10 years of age [31–35, 40]. Socio-demographic
profiles of students varied across studies. Four studies
described programs delivered at
socio-economically
disadvantaged schools [30, 31, 33, 36] whereas four
programs took place in middle or upper class neigh-
borhoods [32, 37, 39, 40]. Dufour et al. (2011) did
not report on socio-demographic data of students
who received the program [34] whereas the students
involved in the report by Holen et al (2012) were
from homes where parents had educational attainment
levels higher than the national average [35]. Yamamoto
et al. (2017) delivered the program to students in the
Tokyo Metropolitan Area, making no demographic dis-
tinctions, other than to address the specific contextual

implications of Japanese emotion- and stress-culture as
impactful in their student population [38].

[37]

Key elements of programs
Key elements of the programs (Table 2) show that Malti
et al (2008) was the only study in which the program
comprised more than one student-focused component
[36]. Although only a few components were delivered
universally, all students were exposed to at least one
component of the program [36]. The Up program in-
cluded parent and teacher training, and school environ-
ment programing
and
adaptability were identified as key contributing factors to
successful
implementation with four studies reporting
high levels of program fidelity and program support
[32, 33, 39, 40]. The five studies that implemented
and evaluated the Zippy’s Friends program described
no changes in curriculum or delivery, but allowed for
activity adaptability during sessions [31–35]. Teachers
delivering it felt equipped to adapt the program as they
saw necessary to their class while still maintaining high
program fidelity [34]. Adaptability was also highlighted
as being an important program factor for the You Can

Do It! Education program in Japan, where program staff
translated and altered the internationally-implemented
program with Japan-specific illustrations, examples and
exercises to optimize the connection with students
[38]. Three studies identified problems with implemen-
tation of programming due to teacher perceptions, time
constraints, participation rates and class literacy levels
[32, 33, 38, 40].

Evaluation frameworks, tools and indicators
Study evaluation frameworks and indicators (sum-
marised in Table 3) are reported with more detail on
evaluation tools and methods used for evaluating el-
ements of programing reported in Appendix. Studies
their
varied greatly on the timing and purpose of
evaluation although all applied a combination of
pre-assessment, post-assessment, process evaluation,
implementation evaluation and follow up assess-
ments. Within specific programs, different evalua-
tions were used for different
implementations and
contexts. The five articles reporting on the Zippy’s
Friends program utilized different evaluation methods
[31–35]. Mishara and Ystgaard (2006) evaluated the im-
plementation of Zippy’s Friends in two countries with
similar
socio-demographic characteristics, Lithuania
and Denmark, and found similar results in outcomes
of students in the intervention groups in both coun-
tries. Yamamoto et al. used a semi-experimental de-
sign with intervention and control groups and utilized
three self-report
[38].
Clarke evaluated a randomized-controlled trial imple-
mentation of Zippy’s Friends in Ireland using both
standard measures [33] and a participatory workshop
with a subsample of students. The workshop was
semi-structured around three key themes: lived expe-
riences and coping reactions; emotion recognition
and regulation; and program evaluation [31]. In all
articles meeting out inclusion criteria, multiple stan-
dardized, validated tools were used for evaluation
measures, most commonly the Children’s Depression
Inventory (CDI, Short or Complete Form) [30, 39],
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [33, 35],
the Schoolagers’ Coping Strategies Inventory [32, 34], and
a Program Fidelity Checklist [33, 40]. Evaluation methods

scales

commonly included in-class observations [33, 34, 36, 40],
researcher-developed questionnaires [34, 36] and session
reports [32, 34, 35].

Outcomes
Each article identified outcomes associated with their re-
search question and hypothesis with outcomes following
program implementation to assess the impact of the
program. Table 4 presents a summary of whether major
outcomes were considered by the article to have chan-
ged as a result of programing. In eight studies, re-
searchers identified at baseline an overarching need for
resilience programing among students,
including low
levels of trust and empathy; problems with emotion
control, relationships and help-seeking; or reported
symptoms [30, 31, 33, 36–40]. Ten out of eleven studies
reported positive outcomes with improvements in stu-
dent resilience and protective factors,
including fre-
quency of use of coping skills, internalizing behaviors,
[30–34, 36–40].
and self-efficacy at post-assessment
Three studies identified shortcomings in outcomes despite
positive results from the overall program implementation
and outcomes. Kraag et al. (2009) identified a lack of
follow up and social reinforcement for components
taught in programing, with negative implications on
long-term follow-up outcomes [39]. Clarke and col-
leagues (2014) showed limited effects on resilience it-
self, but highlighted a marked increase in self-awareness
among students [33]. Variations in outcomes between in-
formants was highlighted in Holen et al (2012) who did not
determine that resilience itself was an outcome of the
program [35].

Discussion
This review examined the program criteria and out-
come measures used in the implementation and evalu-
ation of
school-based
mental health promotion programs. Eleven published
studies based on seven different programs were identified
and included.

assess assessment, implmt implementation

emerged as key. Numerous studies used teachers to de-
liver the program, a feature presented positively as pro-
viding the opportunity for adaptability of programing
if provided with
and more seamless implementation,
programmatic support and training. For example, the
Zippy’s Friends program uses teachers to deliver the
content materials [33] and teachers reported receiving
substantial, helpful program support by research and
program staff.

In their review of factors of success for implementa-
tion, adaptation of programing was identified as a key
component of implementation [38, 41]. Teachers of the

Zippy’s Friends Program reported the ability to adapt,
add and remove activities relating to thematic content
based on student literacy, mood and timing, as one of
the most important parts of program delivery [33].
This allowed the maintenance of high program fidelity
while also involving students in the most effective way
possible. Teachers are an important resource in the de-
velopment of children’s resilience, as they already have
rapport and an understanding of the students and are
more likely to know their students lived experiences and
current coping and help-seeking strategies. Yamamoto

YCDI! Program with the extensive edits to the cur-
riculum to adapt it to Japanese culture and relation-
ships [38].

The length of programing did not appear to im-
pact on the number of outcomes achievable. The
RALLY program ran for an entire school year and
provided consistent resilience outcomes [36], while
the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program ran
for only 12 weeks and showed positive resilience
outcomes as well [30]. The YCDI! Program ran for a
shorter period of time than most implementations of
the program but still demonstrated significant results
[38]. Importance was placed on the intensity of ses-
sions and the content delivered, as opposed to the
regularity. However, importantly, if follow up evalua-
tions were conducted, they did not reveal that out-
term after
comes were maintained in the longer
most programs. This suggests that program length
may not alter the ongoing resiliency of students once
the program ends.

Emergent themes across studies
Although all eleven articles presented programs that
aimed at fostering the resilience skills and protective
factors of students, the specific skills and outcomes
taught
in each program differed. This is consistent
with research highlighting the difficulty that exists in
defining resilience and creating programs around the
topic [1]. Not only is the definition difficult and vari-
able between studies, but the criteria and skills that
come with developing resilience differ as well. In the
RALLY study, researchers targeted resilience, and the
trust of others,
outcomes evaluated were empathy,
and emotional regulation skills [36]. On the other
hand, the UP study targeted resilience through social
and emotional competencies that allow students to
engage and navigate daily life, social interactions and
society [37]. Both programs aimed to foster social and
emotional development by increasing resilience skills
and protective factors, but were based on differences
in terminology and theory. Evaluations of both pro-
grams determined they had a positive outcome on re-
silience in students despite these differences.

An effect noted by a number of studies included in
this review was the “ceiling effect” since many of the
students enrolled in universal-based programs have
high baseline mental health and social and emotional
competence [33]. Although individuals within the
group might suffer from higher risk factors or mental
illness, across the board students present with gener-
ally normal levels. As such, when the program is im-
plemented, outcomes may be generated but will not
be large as there is little room for change. This is not
the case when providing targeted programs with

students who all generally have much more room for
change, given that they begin the program with lower
scores at baseline. Despite the ceiling effect, research
has shown that resilience-boosting programing bene-
fits at-risk but are not specific for at-risk children.
Additionally, properly identifying and screening target
groups for targeted programing is often unsuccessful
due to the complexities of mental health, and preventive
approaches, such as universal resilience-boosting pro-
graming, are considered the most all-encompassing
method [42]. As such, a program promoting resilience will
support positive changes and growth in both groups of
kids, although with more significant differences in the
at-risk group.

Characteristics and methodologies of evaluations
An element of the evaluations that emerged in many ar-
ticles is the removed nature of evaluation when collect-
ing data on children’s capacities. Many of the programs
seek to foster resilience through the development of
coping skills, and use scales or observations in order to
measure outcomes. The Learn Young, Learn Fair pro-
gram evaluated a positive effect on emotion-focused,
adaptive coping skills using validated questionnaires and
scales [39]. This approach is used in all the program
evaluations, but does not leave room for lived experi-
ences to be factored into the interpretation of outcomes.
These traditional evaluation methodologies can be seen
as researching on a topic, rather than researching for a
cause or population, as they do not leave room for ambi-
guity or other factors.

Additionally, a couple of studies in this review used
evaluation tools that did not take into account the
views of children themselves. The researchers chose
to interview and evaluate both teachers’ and the pro-
gram deliverers’ perceptions and ratings, rather than
interviewing or evaluating the children themselves.
For example, Caldarella, Christensen et al. (2009) evaluate
children’s outcomes through pre- and post-assessments of
the teacher’s perceptions of her students, using validated
assessment tools [40]. However, evaluations like this
limitation to the outcome
introduce an additional
analysis,
through secondary
sources with the program delivered to children for
their benefit, but outcomes not gathered directly from
the children. However, observational data is a key
component of a program evaluation with many stud-
ies successfully using observations to ensure program
fidelity and as part of process evaluations.

they gather data

as

More insight around outcomes occurs when multiple
evaluation tools and methods are used [43]. Clarke and
colleagues (2015) evaluated the use of a participatory
workshop determining children’s coping skills which
used draw and write techniques that allowed children to

Fenwick-Smith et al. BMC Psychology  (2018) 6:30 

Page 12 of 17

share their feelings using their own words rather than
those of researchers [44], as well as vignettes to elimin-
ate interview processes [45]. Students from the interven-
tion group were found to use more adaptive coping
skills in their daily life, both in and out of the classroom
than children in the control group [31]. These results
were supported by the quantitative data collected on the
larger student sample from which the participatory
workshop subsample was drawn [33]. A clearer picture
of children’s coping skills and experiences with the
Zippy’s Friends program was gathered through the use
of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation meth-
odology. Additionally, children’s lived experiences and
direct insights were gathered through the participatory
workshop model, allowing for a greater breadth of un-
derstanding on the program’s efficiency.

Limitations of articles and evidence
Consideration must be given to the ethics and feasibility
of
implementing and evaluating programs for mental
health promotion. Ethical concerns arise from providing
a program that might be highly beneficial for a group of
children, and not for another, essentially disadvantaging
them. The ethics are further confounded by the lack of
complete or stringent randomization described in the
studies that include a control group. To avoid the di-
lemma of disadvantaging students, studies on success
factors have highlighted that in many studies the control
groups do not receive ‘no intervention’ [41]. For ex-
ample, Sibinga et al. (2016) included an active control
group. While the intervention group received the
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program being
studied, the control group received Healthy Topics, a
general health program to match the MBSR structure.
Thus, while the control group students are not receiving
a resilience-focused, mental health promotion program,
they still receive a health promotion program but one
which allows a distinction between control and interven-
tion groups around resilience outcomes and mental
health [30]. Yamamoto and colleagues, however, did not
provide programing to the control group following the
intervention [38].

The evidence provided by certain articles must be
weighed with differing criteria. Seven articles evaluated a
program against a control group, allowing for compari-
son of outcomes. These articles present more substantial
outcome evidence than those that do not include a con-
trol group for comparison. For example, Nielsen and
colleagues (2015) and Caldarella and colleagues (2009)
did not have a control group, decreasing the strength of
their evaluation. Nielsen et al. (2015) implemented the
UP program in kindergarten through grade 9, but only
evaluated grades 5–9. Such selective evaluation intro-
duces potential bias and paired with the absence of a

control group makes it difficult to identify if the increase
in social and emotional competencies is due to the UP
intervention, or simply a natural developmental progres-
sion [37].

A limitation of the evaluations in many programs is
the involvement of the person delivering the program
as the evaluator. This can be seen in many studies on
the Zippy’s Friends program, where the classroom
teacher delivers the program and conducts the process
and implementation evaluation themselves. Third-party
observations are sometimes conducted in addition to
verify program fidelity and implementation outcomes.
Of note is that observational evaluation and the use of
independent evaluators have been more extensively
documented as reliable than using tools based on
self-report [41].

We also note that despite gender differences in the
prevalence of mental health problems and the type of
resilience protective factors that children and adoles-
cents use, the studies did not generally report results
by gender [46, 47]. This limitation could be overcome
by encouraging that future studies provide a gender
breakdown or highlight gender-specific results.

Conclusion
This review complements previous reviews on mental
health promotion programing for students. Our focus
on universally delivered programs in primary schools re-
veals key components and strengths of programing that
make for the most successful delivery and evaluation
and enables important conclusions to be drawn.

The review confirms that adaptability and teacher in-
volvement are key elements of program delivery, with
student engagement and use of multiple methods
strengthening program evaluation. The use of participa-
tory methods to engage children allows for greater as-
sessment of lived experiences and use of coping skills
compared to self-reporting tools or observations.
Adaptability of curriculum to different contexts, seen in
the Zippy’s Friends program, was considered successful
by multiple authors, illustrating that broad program ap-
is possible and
plication across multiple contexts
effective.

This review demonstrates the importance of establishing
key criteria to be measured during delivery and evaluation of
youth mental health promotion programs, particularly in
terms of defining resilience and its associated indicators.
The successes of the programs detailed by the studies
the need for and
included in this review highlight
research on
such programs. Further
benefits of
primary-school, universally delivered mental health
promotion programs could be conducted in specific
contexts, particularly more difficult settings such as
developing countries or conflict zones.
