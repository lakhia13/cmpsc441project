Abstract

This article describes the treatment framework and core 

therapeutic principles of the integrative brief systemic in-

tervention  (IBSI),  a  manualized  six- session  intervention 

intended for parents seeking couple therapy. IBSI aims to 

work on the couple's presenting problem, considering its 

specific impact in the marital and coparenting domains. 

The basic premise of IBSI is to consider that, when work-

ing with couples who have children, therapeutic work on 

their coparenting alliance may be used as a lever, as both 

parents  may  be  particularly  motivated  to  improve  their 

relationship  for  their  children's  benefit.  Increasing  the 

coparenting  alliance  may  then  facilitate  work  on  deeper 

conflicts within the marital relationship. The core thera-

peutic principles of IBSI are: (1) joining with the couple as 

romantic partners and a coparenting team from the start 

of the therapeutic process; (2) supporting the parents in in-

creasing their awareness regarding their children's behav-

ior and emotional experiences when facing their parents’ 

conflicts; and (3) working on the spill-  and cross- over ef-

fects between marital and coparenting relationships (i.e., 

exploring how conflict or positivity spills over from one 

relationship  to  the  other  or  crosses  over  from  one  part-

ner to the other). Therapeutic work following these main

I N T RODUC T ION

Couple  therapy  has  been  validated  as  an  efficacious  and  efficient  approach  (Bradbury  & 
Bodenmann, 2020), with reviews and meta- analyses showing its possible efficacy for improv-
ing marital satisfaction and reducing comorbid disorders in individuals (e.g., Rathgeber et al., 
2019; Sexton et al., 2011; Shadish & Baldwin, 2005; Sprenkle, 2012; Von Sydow et al., 2010). 
Notably,  efficacy  and  effectiveness  research  on  couple  therapy  has  mostly  assessed  marital 
satisfaction and individual symptomatology, rarely including other family outcomes, such as 
parent−child relationship quality or child adjustment (Darwiche & de Roten, 2015; MacIntosh 
& Butters, 2014).

Nevertheless,  couple  therapy  with  parents  has  specific  characteristics.  First,  coparenting 
conflict (i.e., lack of coordination and cooperation between parents in childrearing) is related 
to worsening difficulties in the marital facets of relationships (Zemp et al., 2018). Mutual sup-
port  in  parenting  efforts  is  connected  with  higher- quality  marital  relationships  (McHale  & 
Irace, 2011); therefore, addressing the coparenting relationship in couple therapy may also im-
prove marital relationship quality. Second, destructive conflict can be detrimental for not only 
the  partners  themselves  but  also  their  children's  well- being  and  development  (Davies  et  al., 
2012; Murphy et al., 2016). Coparenting is a more proximal predictor of child well- being than 
marital relationship quality (Holland & McElwain, 2013); coparenting quality affects child ad-
justment, even after controlling for marital satisfaction (Teubert & Pinquart, 2010). Therefore, 
targeting the coparenting relationship in couple therapy could also benefit children.

Coparenting in couple therapy research

Two uncontrolled effectiveness studies regarding the impact of marital counseling on several 
commonly assessed dimensions (e.g., marital satisfaction and affective communication), which 
also assessed conflict over childrearing in parent couples (approximately 75% of the sample), 
showed that marital counseling (Hahlweg & Klann, 1997; Klann et al., 2011) effectively im-
proved  marital  satisfaction  but  not  coparenting  conflict.  Another  study  (Ledermann  et  al., 
2007) used a randomized controlled design with parent couples experiencing childrearing dis-
tress, finding that a couple prevention program targeting marital stress and coping positively 
impacted marital relationship functioning but did not decrease coparenting conflict. The au-
thors of these three studies suggested that to achieve effects for coparenting, a more tailored 
approach for parent couples would be more appropriate.

Some  studies  have  demonstrated  improved  coparenting.  Gattis  et  al.  (2008)  assessed  the 
efficacy of behavioral couple therapy on marital satisfaction and coparenting and child ad-
justment (half of the sample were parent couples and coparenting was targeted when needed). 
Results  showed  improved  marital  satisfaction  and  decreased  coparenting  conflict  over  the 
course of therapy and at two- year follow- up. Moreover, coparenting conflict mediated the re-
lationship between marital satisfaction and child adjustment (Gattis et al., 2008). Lastly, a brief 

DARWICHE Et Al.  
    
492 

| 

systemic intervention (Vaudan et al., 2016), including work on coparenting and childrearing 
when  relevant,  showed  improved  marital  and  coparenting  quality,  with  effects  being  main-
tained three months after therapy completion. However, the increase in coparenting quality 
was not as strong as that for marital quality.

These studies, including parenting- related outcomes for couple therapy, produced conflict-
ing results, indicating that improvements in parents' marital relationships do not systemati-
cally translate into coparenting- related changes. This is intriguing, as several studies showed 
a link between marital and coparenting quality (e.g., Mangelsdorf et al., 2011), suggesting that 
improving one relationship could naturally help improve the other. The available findings sug-
gest that including work on the coparenting relationship in couple therapy when appropriate 
improves coparenting (Gattis et al., 2008; Vaudan et al., 2016), compared to either unspecified 
interventions (Hahlweg & Klann, 1997; Klann et al., 2011) or interventions focused on other 
aspects  (e.g.,  communication  skills;  Ledermann  et  al.,  2007).  Further  research  is  needed  to 
clarify whether techniques that incorporate both marital and coparenting relationships can 
lead to greater changes in family related outcomes. It is also necessary to clarify whether this 
type of approach should be used only if parents are experiencing parental distress in combina-
tion with marital distress, or whether specific coparenting work is valuable even if the request 
falls within the marital sphere.

Coparenting in clinical family and couple therapy literature

In clinical family therapy literature, therapeutic work on coparenting has been conceptualized 
and applied in slightly different ways. Work on the marital relationship is generally consid-
ered a prerequisite for achieving results with family interventions and decreasing symptoms 
in children. Minuchin (1974) described the importance of the “parental executive subsystem” 
for family functioning. According to structural theory, symptoms in children may arise when 
inappropriate boundaries within the family (e.g., detouring and cross- generational coalitions) 
prevent the parental executive subsystem from fulfilling its protective role and authority. Other 
pioneers, such as Satir (1964), viewed parents as architects of the family, considering the in-
terparental relationship as the axis around which other family relationships are shaped. Satir 
posited that conflictual marital relationships lead to a dysfunctional family triangle, which 
prevent the adults from fulfilling their parental roles. Boszormenyi- Nagy (Boszormenyi- Nagy 
& Spark, 1973) provided a crucial understanding of the impact of parental conflict on chil-
dren. Therapists’ multidirectional partiality leads them to consider the impact of problems and 
symptoms on each individual, including absent or unborn generations, referring to the prin-
ciple of relational equity. A therapist will thus encourage each partner in a marital conflict to 
consider the other's best interests while also, as a parent, considering their child's best interests. 
Similarly,  in  multi- generational  therapy  (Andolfi,  2017),  therapists  may  invite  the  partners' 
children or parents to physically participate in the couple's treatment, so their perspectives can 
be voiced, and their presence experienced as positive resources for the couple.

To our knowledge, there is no model in clinical couple therapy literature that specifically 
articulates work on both the marital and coparenting relationships. It is more common to work 
on reciprocal patterns of interaction when treating a couple's problematic dynamic. For exam-
ple, in emotion- focused couple therapy (Greenberg & Goldman, 2008), the therapist identifies 
the interactive dance in which the partners are caught to help them overcome their difficul-
ties, be they negative cycles related to affiliation (e.g., demand−withdraw cycle) or influence 
(e.g., overfunctioning−underfunctioning cycle; Greenberg & Goldman, 2008). Other authors, 
such as Scheinkman and DeKoven Fishbane (2004), also propose work on vulnerability cycles 
that adversely affect couples’ overall relationships. If these cycles triggered by individual vul-
nerabilities (e.g., abuse, maltreatment) are activated within a couple's relationship, one of the 

FAMILY PROCESS 
 
|  493

partners will adopt a “survival position” (e.g., not get too close), thereby provoking a reaction 
in the other and creating an impasse. The underlying rationale of these models is that interac-
tional cycles generally affect several domains of a couple's life (i.e., as partners, as parents, or 
in relationships with their family of origin; Zimmerman & Dickerson, 1993).

With  parent  couples,  however,  it  may  be  relevant  to  address  whether  these  interactional 
cycles differ between the marital and coparenting areas. Certain domains may be preserved 
while others are not (e.g., parental efficacy maintained despite marital conflict), or different 
cycles  may  characterize  these  domains  (e.g.,  an  overfunctioning−underfunctioning  cycle  in 
the coparenting relationship but a demand−withdraw cycle in the marital relationship). If we 
assume that the interactional dance may differ between domains, working only on romantic 
cycles may be insufficient if another cycle is perpetuated at the coparenting level. Thus, it may 
be necessary to work on what transcends the different roles and relationships and on what is 
specific to certain domains and relationships.

Outside the family and couple therapy fields, some programs offer combined interventions 
on marital and coparenting relationships; however, they target specific populations, such as 
divorced or new parents, as part of specialized coparenting programs (for a review, see Eira 
Nunes, de Roten, et al., 2021), making them unsuitable for parents seeking couple therapy.

I N T E GR AT I V E BR I E F  SYST E M IC   I N T E RV E N T ION

The well- established distinction in the family development field (e.g., McHale & Irace, 2011) 
between  coparenting  and  marital  relationships  is  highly  relevant  when  conducting  couple 
therapy with parents. In the clinical couple therapy field, this distinction may initially appear 
artificial to clinicians, as they usually target general dysfunctional interactional cycles rather 
than the marital and coparental domains separately. We propose that this distinction be used 
as a tool for working with parent couples specifically to explore and work on their roles and 
experiences  as  partners  and  parents.  There  are  three  main  reasons  for  this  proposal.  First, 
parents may be more motivated to initiate change in their coparenting functioning in the early 
stages of treatment, driven to improve their relationship for their children's sake. Second, there 
may be different dynamics in these two domains that do not evolve in the same way or at the 
same pace, and this can only be revealed through domain- specific exploration. Third, parent 
couples may come to couple therapy but present with co- morbidities, such as difficulties in the 
parent−child or coparenting relationship, or be parents of a child with special needs.

In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  IBSI  treatment  framework  and  its  core  therapeutic  princi-
ples, then illustrate the intervention using a clinical case to demonstrate how couple therapy 
may help parents by strengthening their marital and coparenting relationships. The treatment 
framework resulted from the collaborative work of the three first authors with support from 
the other authors.

Treatment framework

IBSI is a manualized intervention (Carneiro et al., 2012, manual available from the authors 
upon request) with four chapters:

Chapter  one  provides  background  for  the  model's  development.  Originally,  this  systemic 
six- session  intervention  was  developed  in  the  larger  context  of  several  collaborative  efforts 
between  clinicians  and  researchers  to  provide  brief  therapeutic  interventions  for  individual 
and  families  using  different  theoretical  approaches  (e.g.,  Drapeau  et  al.,  2008).  Brief  inter-
ventions are designed to accelerate change through targeted therapeutic interventions and to 
increase couples' involvement in treatment (Dewan et al., 2011). However, when they requested

it, couples were offered more than six treatment sessions. When more sessions were scheduled, 
a new contract was created; either the IBSI continued in the same format as with six sessions 
or only a few ad hoc sessions were scheduled, depending on the couple's needs.

Chapter two features the general systemic framework. It summarizes the general principles 
of systemic- oriented approaches related to the definition of the therapy goals and treatment 
of the presenting problem. In the specific context of brief treatment, the IBSI model promotes 
therapists’  collaborative  positioning  in  relation  to  clients  (Anderson,  1997),  inviting  the  cli-
ents to be co- actors and jointly responsible for the therapeutic process. In each session, client 
feedback is sought regarding their experiences with the therapeutic process and therapeutic 
relationship  to  promote  dialogue  and  reflexivity  regarding  the  intervention  (e.g.,  Gingerich 
et al., 2012). This technique is called a feedback ritual because it is used in a ritualized way at 
the beginning of each session (Macaione et al., 2018). Another example of the importance of 
feedback in psychotherapy may be found in Pinsof's work (Pinsof et al., 2015). Change can be 
empirically assessed and tracked through a client- report feedback system (Systemic Therapy 
Inventory of Change, STIC). The partners' feedback is also systematically used by the thera-
pists to guide their decisions.

Chapter three describes the three phases of IBSI:

1.  Session  1  is  dedicated  to  creating  a  therapeutic  space  (Tilmans- Ostyn  &  Meynckens- 
Fourez,  1987)  and  defining  the  problem  in  terms  of  concrete  interactive  behaviors,  thus 
allowing  minimum  objectives  to  be  set  (Nardone  &  Watzlawick,  2004).

2.  Sessions  2  to  5  (intervention  phase)  allow  for  work  on  a  couple's  objectives.  The  systemic 
techniques are generic to other models, as described in the manual. Accordingly, therapists 
will use techniques they prefer or consider most appropriate within the general framework of 
systemic practice. What is unique to IBSI is that these interventions are guided by the core 
therapeutic principles detailed in the manual's fourth chapter (see below).

3.  Session 6 is dedicated to reflecting on the intervention and possible follow- up. Both partners 
are invited to evaluate the progress made and whether they reached their goals. This session 
also allows therapists to work further on possible relapses and help couples anticipate their 
reactions to future difficulties.

Chapter  four  describes  the  core  therapeutic  principles,  which  aim  to  guide  therapists  in 
incorporating therapeutic work on both the marital and coparenting relationships within the 
couple therapy setting.

Core therapeutic principles

Three core therapeutic principles are intended to promote change. As in systemic couple ther-
apy, the therapist in IBSI focuses on the relational issues that brought the couple to couple 
therapy (e.g., sexual problems, infidelity, work- related stress). Therefore, the therapist does not 
prioritize work on coparenting over work on other relationship issues, and the extent of the 
work done on the marital or coparenting relationship is left open.

First principle

From  the  intake  or  first  session,  the  therapist  aligns  with  the  couple,  considering  them 
to  be  partners  and  coparents.  In  doing  so,  the  therapist  shares  their  vision  of  the  couple 
comprising  both  marital  and  coparenting  relationships  and  orientates  their  questions  to 
obtain  information  on  both  (e.g.,  “What  are  your  expectations  of  each  other  as  partners 

FAMILY PROCESS 
 
|  495

and coparents?” “How do you feel you contribute to the romantic and coparenting relation-
ships?”). The therapist provides concrete examples of what is covered by the marital and 
coparenting  relationships  and  assesses  the  couple's  satisfaction  and  expectations  in  both 
domains.  Psychoeducation  about  the  impact  of  marital  and  coparental  conflict  on  chil-
dren can be a valuable tool at this initial stage to make parents aware of the importance of 
working on their relationship. Keeping in mind from the beginning that couples are both 
romantic partners and coparents favors the connection between experiences and emotions 
in both domains, whether the subject being discussed is related to the marital or coparent-
ing  relationship  (e.g.,  “How  do  you  feel  the  issues  you  came  to  therapy  for,  the  cheating 
between you, have impacted John or you as a parent?” or “How do you feel the issues you 
came to therapy for, struggling to agree on child- rearing issues, have impacted Delia or you 
as a partner?”). These questions can be asked using circular questioning (Selvini Palazzoli 
et al., 1980) or techniques from different systemic therapy models, such as the miracle ques-
tion (De Jong & Kim Berg, 2002; e.g., “If you woke up and the problem of cheating between 
you was fully resolved, would that have an impact on John as a parent?”).

These questions may be asked in the first session during the goal- setting phase, but may also 
be relevant at other times in therapy. Another way of connecting with the couple as partners 
and parents, regardless of their children's ages, is to explore their experiences during the transi-
tion from couple to parents to determine whether their marital problems are potentially related 
to this period. Many problems for couples take root during this life stage, such as the father 
feeling excluded from the mother−baby dyad, the mother feeling unsupported, and the onset 
of sexual difficulties (e.g., Hughes et al., 2020). Therefore, marital tensions may have resulted 
from difficulties integrating the romantic and coparenting dimensions. This approach allows 
the couple's difficulties to be reframed (“we are a couple in crisis”) for a more nuanced view 
of their relationship, where they realize, for example, that their high expectations as parents 
weakened their marital relationship. This allows partners to maintain a positive view of their 
resources and identity as a couple. Overall, the first principle aims to help partners broaden 
their vision of their functioning as a couple and identify dynamics that could potentially differ 
depending on the domain.

Second principle

In  IBSI,  the  therapist  encourages  higher  awareness  of  the  repercussions  of  couple  conflicts 
on child well- being and adjustment. Based on clinical experience, the premise of IBSI is that 
partners are initially more likely to work together to benefit their children rather than focus 
on their deep- rooted marital difficulties. It has been clinically observed that during a marital 
crisis, the motivation to change for one's partner or the relationship is often reduced, while the 
motivation to change for one's children generally remains intact.

Therapeutic work on couple difficulties— and their repercussions for child well- being and 
adjustment— can take different forms. The strategies used depend on the questions and dif-
ficulties the couple expresses during the first session and the exploration of the couple's func-
tioning in the marital and coparenting domains.

Difficulties experienced in the marital relationship only
When  a  couple  comes  to  therapy  with  a  specific  marital  problem  (e.g.,  sexual  or  infidelity 
problems), the therapist prioritizes that problem, but may, at some point during the interven-
tion phase, use the couple's resources as coparents to consolidate or increase their coparenting 
alliance, which, in turn, may motivate them to overcome other difficulties. Some marital diffi-
culties may be so intense and persistent, or the partners so unengaged in change, that working 
on the coparenting relationship may be an effective therapeutic lever.

DARWICHE Et Al.

| 

One avenue is to acknowledge and value the couple's resources in the coparenting domain. 
The therapist can highlight the ability they both have to care for their children's well- being. 
Thus, the therapist will help the partners imagine what life would be like if their marital dif-
ficulties disappeared, and work to develop the couple's resources to achieve this goal, rather 
than focusing on past events and mistakes. Coparenting successes are seen as resources— or 
exceptions to marital difficulties— that can help partners reach their goals (Berg, 1994).

The  therapist  may  also  suggest  that  parents  reflect  on  how  their  children  feel  about  and 
experience marital conflicts they witness. This aims to shift the couple's focus from the marital 
difficulties to reflect on family functioning and explore their children's perspectives. The ther-
apist may also invite the partners to recall their own childhood memories, and in particular of 
arguments between their parents, which can increase their empathy for their children.

Difficulties expressed in both the romantic and coparenting relationships
In this situation, the therapist can articulate work on the marital issues with work with copar-
ents concerned for their children's well- being. Without setting aside marital distress and the 
couple's needs in this area, the therapist may decide to first work on the coparenting relation-
ship, if they assess the parents to be more involved in this area, if they are experiencing signifi-
cant difficulties in the parent−child relationship, or if the children themselves are presenting 
with symptoms.

More precisely, the therapist leads the coparents to observe and describe their children's re-
actions in relation to the witnessed interparental conflict (Cummings et al., 2008). Parents can 
also reflect on their children's role in the conflict. As Cummings and Davies (2010) described, 
children may interfere with, avoid, or be emotionally dysregulated during interparental con-
flict. Work on these issues can increase coparents’ awareness of the impact their tension has 
on their children, which may be a powerful motivator for change. When coparents become suf-
ficiently insightful regarding their children's experiences and feelings (Oppenheim & Koren- 
Karie,  2002),  they  are  able  to  empathically  understand  the  motives  behind  their  children's 
behaviors  in  terms  of  thoughts  and  emotions,  and  are  open  to  challenging  their  children's 
views. Coparents' empathy with their children's experiences may be encouraged by simulating 
a child's presence during the session or connecting the parents to their child's experiences using 
circular questioning technique (Selvini Palazzoli et al., 1980). Once the coparents understand 
their children's emotional experiences related to interparental conflicts, the therapist may use 
these  experiences  as  a  therapeutic  lever.  This  reframes  possible  changes  in  each  partner  as 
positively impacting both the couple and their children. Questions such as “who would benefit 
most if you changed” can lead parents to shift their focus away from their conflicts and toward 
a better perception of how change benefits their children. This may also help the couple to shift 
from blame to more constructive action.

To improve the coparenting relationship, the therapist can work on strengthening the co-
parenting alliance by looking for each parent's “good reasons” for their childrearing beliefs 
(Boszormenyi- Nagy & Spark, 1973; Kotchick & Forehand, 2002). The therapist can allow un-
derstanding and expression of each parent's internal motivations (e.g., parents wish to pass on 
values they hold dear and inherited from their family of origin). Interparental conflict can then 
be positively reframed, and the coparents can become less critical of each other's childrearing 
beliefs. The therapist can also propose some minor expectations for change in the coparenting 
relationship to allow the couple to experience small successes (e.g., asking the first parent what 
the other parent could do to help them change, leading each parent to identify and validate 
each other's changes). This procedure can restart the validation process (Boszormenyi- Nagy 
& Spark, 1973) within the coparenting subsystem, providing an opportunity for each parent to 
recognize the merits and efforts that their partner is making toward helping their children and 
family. This can then be transferred to the marital domain, where expectations are higher and 
difficulties more deeply entrenched.

FAMILY PROCESS 
 
|  497

The  therapist  can  reduce  interparental  conflict  by  preventing  each  parent  from  interfer-
ing with or sabotaging the other's childrearing. When interparental conflict is too severe, it 
is possible to define “parental territories,” at least for a defined period of time. Each parent 
then becomes responsible for one area (e.g., school, table manners), without criticism and dis-
qualification from the other. In these cases, therapy can help develop a model for managing 
coparenting conflict by emphasizing how important it is for parents to protect their children 
from destructive interparental conflict. In less severe situations, coparenting conflict can be 
positively reframed by showing that children can benefit from educational differences.

Third principle

The spill- over and cross- over dynamics between the romantic and coparenting relationships 
are explored with each parent in the other's presence, to understand how each parent's per-
ceived marital distress negatively impacts their own coparenting alliance (spill- over dynamic; 
e.g., McDaniel et al., 2018; Morrill et al., 2010), and how the perceived marital distress nega-
tively impacts the other parent's coparenting alliance (cross- over dynamic; e.g., Pedro et al., 
2012).  This  work  can  also  be  done  by  exploring  the  opposite  path— the  negative  impact  of 
coparenting conflict on marital satisfaction. It is also worth highlighting how the resources 
of one relationship can possibly benefit the other (Bonds & Gondoli, 2007; Pedro et al., 2012).
In the rarer case of couples presenting with coparenting difficulties only, therapists can ex-
plore resources these couples have developed to cope with marital tension and how these can 
be used to manage coparenting conflicts. In this case, couples are encouraged to “take care” of 
the impact their conflicts have on their children, just as they have succeeded in “taking care” 
of their marital relationship.

Limitations of integrative brief systemic intervention

An important aspect when working on coparenting is the quality of each parent's bond with 
their children. It may be difficult for parents to cooperate if one is abusive in parenting. When 
parental guidance is lacking, work on parenting must be done before or in addition to IBSI 
treatment,  such  as  within  the  framework  of  child  psychiatric  follow- up.  Moreover,  inviting 
the couple to work on their coparenting relationship can be a hurtful experience; in becom-
ing aware of their coparenting distress, they risk feeling overly guilty about their parenting. 
It  is  then  critical  that  therapeutic  work  helps  them  become  more  responsible  as  coparents, 
rather than increasing their feelings of guilt. Another limitation concerns couples who come 
to therapy because they perceive the romantic sphere as invaded by parenting issues. Working 
on their coparenting relationship might initially lead them to feel this further decreases their 
romantic intimacy. In these situations, it is important for therapists to directly state the rea-
sons for their approach, which ultimately aims to enable couples to set healthier boundaries 
(Minuchin, 1974) between the marital and coparenting domains.

Linda and Philip participated in a randomized controlled trial evaluating IBSI efficacy. This 
case was selected at random from the IBSI group. The couple's personal data were modified 
or removed to guarantee their anonymity. Below, we provide information about the partners, 
their request for therapy, the therapists, and a detailed analysis of the sessions. This analysis,

conducted by a team of four IBSI clinicians and four researchers, was the result of observing 
six therapy sessions. It aimed to highlight the application of IBSI’s core therapeutic principles.

Couple's information and request for therapy

At the time of treatment, Linda (32 years old) and Philip (35 years old), both white, had been 
married for 10 years and had two children, Eroan and Alessia, who were 8 and 3 years old, 
respectively. Linda stopped working after Eroan's birth, but had resumed working full- time 
as a childhood educator due to Philip's professional difficulties. Philip previously worked as 
a  surgeon,  but  had  left  his  employment  two  years  prior  due  to  psychological  problems.  He 
had  seen  a  psychiatrist  since  the  beginning  of  his  difficulties,  which  consisted  of  burnout, 
anxiety, and a depressive state, and diagnosed as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and 
depressed mood. Both Linda and Philip expressed that their request for therapy was motivated 
by a need for support, as they struggled with the impact of Philip's psychological problems on 
their day- to- day family life.

Therapists' information

Two  experienced  female  co- therapists  took  charge  of  the  treatment.  Both  had  graduate  de-
grees in psychology and were certified systemic psychotherapists. Therapist 1 had worked for 
16 years as a systemic couple and family psychotherapist and 11 years as an IBSI therapist. 
Therapist 2 had worked for five years as a systemic couple and family psychotherapist and four 
years as an IBSI therapist. Therapist 1 was also among the IBSI clinicians who analyzed the 
case.

Therapy analysis

Phase I. Creating a therapeutic space and setting objectives

Session 1
The first session was dedicated to understanding the couple's request and working on precise 
objectives  that  could  realistically  be  met  within  six  sessions.  This  session  also  allowed  the 
impact of Philip's psychological disorder on their marital and coparenting relationships to be 
explored, and to encourage them at the beginning of therapy to become involved as a marital 
dyad  and  coparents  ( first  therapeutic  principle).  Regarding  their  marital  relationship,  Linda 
explained that she was suffering due to the fluctuations in Philip's emotional state. During dif-
ficult times, she felt their relationship was broken; she did not know what she was allowed to 
say and felt that Philip was only present physically. When he was better, she felt that it required 
much effort to “recreate” a romantic relationship, and she did not have the energy to make 
that  effort.  Philip  was  frustrated  by  what  has  become  a  distant  relationship  between  them. 
Exploring then the coparenting relationship led Philip to express that, when sick, he felt un-
able to contribute to family life— “I cannot do more”— while Linda discussed her frustration 
over returning to full- time work. Her goal was to be there for her children, as she felt a mother 
should be “available all the time.” Finally, the therapists explored the impact of the couple's 
marital and coparenting difficulties on the children (second therapeutic principle). When asked, 
both Linda and Philip expressed that their children did not show any particular reaction to or 
question the situation.

Defining therapy goals
The therapists helped the couple clarify their expectations for therapy. Linda hoped therapy 
would give her a better understanding of how to cope with Philip's psychological problems, so 
she could feel less guilty of hurting him when she communicated with him. Philip expected less 
tension and fewer arguments in their marital relationship, as he tended to hold on to resent-
ment and bitterness after conflicts with Linda. The therapists validated the partners' expecta-
tions by considering them as realistic for the six- session setting. Therefore, the therapy goals 
were to improve the quality of the couple's interactions and help them cope better with Philip's 
illness. Given the brief nature of this intervention, these goals had to be precisely formulated, 
specifying with the couple what was expected by “better- quality interactions” (e.g., “When will 
you consider the other's behavior toward you to have changed?”).

Phase II. Promoting change on the marital and coparenting levels

The intervention phase (Sessions 2 to 5) allows for work in accordance with the second and 
third core therapeutic principles.

Session 2
The feedback ritual made it apparent Philip's illness made it difficult for both partners to come 
to this session; therefore, they were tense and reluctant to talk. Consequently, the therapists 
decided to explore the impact of Philip's psychological problems, externalizing them to allevi-
ate the burden placed on Philip and Linda (White, 2007): “What can the two of you say about 
the impact the illness has had on your relationship and family life?” The partners explained 
that Philip's psychological problems caused both of them to feel guilty. Philip was reproach-
ful toward himself for not being a “father- provider, responsible for the economic well- being 
of the family.” Linda was remorseful for pressuring Philip too much to do a better job with 
the children, knowing that he felt miserable. The therapists observed that Linda and Philip 
spontaneously addressed the coparenting aspects of their relationship and decided to continue 
working in that direction.

To understand any coparenting dissatisfaction the couple experienced, the therapists asked 
Linda and Philip about their expectations for each other. Linda hoped that Philip would un-
derstand on his own that she needed help, while Philip wanted her to allow him more leeway to 
decide how to parent. For example, Linda felt they should put the children to bed together (to 
recreate what she experienced in her family, “a real family cocoon”), while Philip did not find 
this to be necessary (in his childhood, either his mother or father was present).

Later in the session, the therapists explored the couple's knowledge of their children. They 
sought to reinforce the parents' awareness of the repercussions their coparenting tension may 
have  on  their  children,  to  work  from  their  insights  (second  therapeutic  principle).  Regarding 
shared  family  activities,  one  therapist  inquired  if  they  had  asked  the  children  about  their 
wishes as to whether they wanted them all to be together.

Therapist:  And  the  children,  maybe  you  could  ask  them…  do  they  want  to  do  activities  as  a 

family?

Linda: … I don't know— are they able to answer that question?
Philip: … Anyway, they are not asking for us all to be together, they never asked for that… but 
when we are all at home, they are very happy, it reassures them I think… They also often ask 
questions  about  Linda's  schedule;  they  are  always  keen  to  know  when  all  the  family  will  be 
together at home. In my family, it was the same. I liked it a lot when my parents were both at 
home; it was very reassuring for me. I don't know why it was reassuring, but I liked it a lot, even 
as a teenager.

Through  this  question,  Philip  was  able  to  share  his  observations  (i.e.,  how  happy  and 
relieved the kids were when both parents were at home) to connect to elements of his past 
(second  therapeutic  principle).  Thus,  we  can  presume  this  helped  him  to  connect  with  his 
children's  need  for  the  family  to  be  together  at  home.  Linda  agreed  and  felt  that  Philip's 
observations resonated with her.

The excerpt above provides an example of the therapists’ work on insightfulness (e.g., pro-
moting the parents’ awareness of their children's need to have them both at home). This aimed 
to support and increase the couple's coparenting alliance. In this case, it allowed the parents to 
experience emotions related to their children (and themselves as children), which then allowed 
them to provide nuance to their first impression of the children, which was “they are fine, they 
never express concern.”

Session 3
The  feedback  ritual  allowed  Linda  to  remember  that,  in  the  last  session,  she  and  Philip 
were able to talk to each other and just share without looking for solutions. To explore the 
partners' marital and coparenting resources (third therapeutic principle), one therapist asked 
Linda  if  she  had  been  able  to  share  anything  from  her  life  or  concerns  with  Philip  since 
the last session. Linda explained that she was able to share her concerns regarding Eroan's 
school difficulties. As a mother, she felt powerless, and it was beneficial for her to be able 
to talk to Philip.

Therapist: Was this a new experience for you?
Linda: Yes. I tend not to say these things in general. It's just going to go around and around in my 

head. What was new for me was realizing that it felt good to share.

Philip: (Judgmental) But it was more than that; you felt entirely responsible for Eroan's situation. 
You thought, “I'm a bad mother, what did I miss?” I think it's important that you tell me when 
you're in trouble. I can't guess otherwise.

In this exchange, the therapist emphasized the innovative nature of this experience. Despite 
Philip's critical tone, the therapist underlined that Philip was leaving room for Linda to say that 
she has limits, while also letting her know that he was there for her. This episode reflected an 
evolution in the coparenting relationship, which was perceived as positive by the therapists and 
the couple.

Later in the session, Linda allowed herself to share a recent high- conflict coparenting in-
cident:  the  “cookie  jar  episode.”  Linda  came  home  after  work  and  realized  that  Philip  had 
neither fed nor bathed the children. She started screaming and then threw a cookie jar to the 
ground, shattering it. This episode summed up for Linda all the moments of tension they had 
regarding task division, and the fact that she could not ask Philip for sufficient help. Philip 
responded by expressing his frustration that she was too controlling of his behavior as a father 
and how he handled household chores.

The “cookie jar episode” was important, as it allowed Linda to finally express her anger. 
Thus, after being able at the start of the session to share her positive feeling of Philip support-
ing her, Linda allowed herself to express her anger toward Philip. This episode also highlighted 
the high intensity of Linda's anger and hence the therapists’ need to address and work on this 
anger so that she could express it in a less destructive manner. Notably, these sequences all con-
cern the coparenting domain as indicated by the examples the couple cited concerning their 
functioning within the family and with the children. Therefore, the therapists subsequently ex-
plored methods by which the couple could better anticipate and manage coparenting tensions 
and outbursts. This step was to evaluate the couple's motivations for change by helping them 
take  responsibility  for  the  impact  of  their  actions  on  the  children  (future- oriented)  without 
becoming paralyzed by excessive guilt (past- oriented).

Therapist: How could you manage these kinds of episodes differently so that you don't involve the 
children in your tensions, on the one hand, and on the other hand, better understand what both 
of you need during these times to avoid exploding and feeling even worse?

Linda: Even when the children were babies… I never asked myself if I was tired because someone 

had to get up. What if one day I said, “Oh, no, I'm not getting up…”

Philip: Well, it's happened before. And then I got up and took care of the kids… and it went really 

well.

Linda: Yeah, sometimes it frustrates me to be so hard on myself… (crying).

The therapist empathized with Linda while gently expressing to her that she probably under-
estimated the suffering she was experiencing. Philip joined therapist: “Let me know when you are 
tired, and we'll work it out.”

The therapists ended the session by emphasizing the benefit of clarifying these dynamics 
between the partners: the positive one when they are able to support each other and the more 
difficult one when they are caught in negative coparenting dynamics (i.e., the more Linda feels 
compelled to take care of everything in the family, the more Philip puts himself aside). During 
this session, the therapists felt that strong emotions were at work in each partner.

Session 4
Linda realized during the previous session that she needed to express her feelings more. For his 
part, Philip reported realizing that if Linda did not express herself, the tension between them 
would increase. Both considered the need to work together on their family life without tension. 
The therapists noticed a shift in the dominant narrative of Philip's psychological disorder in 
their everyday reality (White, 2007). While Philip's disorder was part of this reality, it no longer 
prevented them from considering their family life together: Linda allowed herself to ask Philip 
for support and express her anger. For his part, Philip was asserting his opinions and expecta-
tions and, from the therapists' perspective, no longer hiding behind psychological problems 
that prevented him from functioning as a parent.

At this point, the couple could be considered to have had positive experiences as a copar-
enting  team,  an  area  they  spontaneously  considered  to  be  affected  daily  by  Philip's  illness. 
Following the IBSI approach, the therapists considered that the functioning of the coparenting 
team could potentially have a positive impact on other relationship domains (i.e., their roman-
tic/marital relationship, third therapeutic principle). This view was reinforced for the therapists 
when Linda brought up an episode in which she had an altercation with a colleague and sent 
a text message to Philip, who responded with kindness and humor: “Come on, don't worry. 
When you get home, we'll have a little drink and watch a reality show.” That made her laugh, 
and she was relaxed for the rest of the day. This reflected a crucial step, as the therapists un-
derstood that positive change was also occurring in the marital relationship (e.g., Linda asked 
Philip for help with a difficulty outside of parenting).

The therapists then further explored the impact of the “Psychological Disorder” on Linda 
and Philip's marital relationship (White, 2007). The partners were less at ease discussing this, 
as if they were dissociated from their desires and needs. In contrast to their relationship dy-
namics as coparents (Linda felt responsible for everything and Philip stayed away), Philip ap-
peared to be the one who felt most comfortable addressing this topic. He reported that they 
had not had a satisfying sex life since they became parents. Linda agreed and explained that 
she would like to regain her sexual desire. They came to therapy mostly for reasons related to 
ongoing family functioning, but ultimately felt the need to take better care of themselves as 
individuals (working less for Linda, putting less pressure on himself for Philip) and as a couple 
(i.e., regaining the pleasure of spending time together). The session ended with the therapists 
highlighting the progress made in the couple's courage to talk to each other about their more 
intimate desires and needs outside of their parental roles.

Session 5
The  partners  shared  with  the  therapists  that  after  the  last  session,  they  talked  about  the 
positive moments of their married life and went out to eat together. Notably, the spouses 
spontaneously looked at each other more than in previous sessions. Philip seemed to be in a 
lighter mood. They stated that they appreciated discussing their respective opinions during 
the sessions, but they also realized this was a long- term process, as each of them had a dif-
ferent temperament. They were concerned about quickly returning to their usual dynamics 
in everyday life.

Their discourse had changed, and they used more “we- statements” (Fergus, 2015; Gottman 
et al., 2015) such as “we have to change” and “we know we have to learn to think in twos,” 
while also being able to share their own personal perspectives. The therapists decided to work 
further on romantic relationship dynamics and assess what the partners still wanted to change 
and the pitfalls they faced, asking: “How do you take care of your relationship, your ‘couple 
unit’?”.

Philip explained that during the last few years, their relationship had been like a “string” 
that tightened and could have broken. Linda expressed that they had not really been a “couple 
unit”  until  recently:  “There  was  me  all  alone  and  there  was  you  all  alone.”  Philip  was  very 
affected by what Linda had shared. During this exchange, Linda and Philip were more non- 
verbally engaged and livelier than in other sessions.

The therapists noted that this sequence allowed the partners to share what made them suf-
fer  in  the  past,  and  stressed  the  importance  of  being  able  to  anticipate  together  the  risk  of 
future  relapses.  This  relapse  anticipation  work  is  typical  in  an  advanced  stage  of  the  IBSI 
process. The therapists also noted the importance of staying close as romantic partners (e.g., 
both expressing their needs, even in a crisis, without necessarily looking for solutions) and as 
coparents (e.g., keeping a positive connection with Philip, sending Philip a photo of a moment 
that Linda and the children spent together) while considering the limitations due to Philip's 
psychological disorder.

Phase III. Reflecting on the intervention and possible follow- up

During the last phase (Session 6), the therapists evaluated the couple's progress, highlighting 
the skills each partner acquired.

Session 6
The therapists first worked on putting safeguards in place to best anticipate future tension. 
Then, they assessed the five previous sessions and whether the partners had achieved their 
objectives. Linda expressed that the sessions allowed her to realize that not everything is 
related to Philip's psychological problems, she wants to work on herself to change her own 
attitudes and representations, and she can be reassured to feel “united” with Philip in dif-
ferent areas of their lives, even with their difficulties. Philip explained that therapy brought 
up the notion of the romantic couple as an important new dimension, and not everything 
revolved around the children and his psychological problems. He expressed wishing to be 
closer to Linda.

At this stage, the therapists also considered Linda and Philip to be functioning as a team in 
different areas of life, and the initial objectives were being met. There was no follow- up plan 
after the six- session intervention; however, the couple knew they could contact the therapists 
again if necessary. If this were to occur, the therapists would create a new contract, such as 
continuing with a six- session intervention using the same model or only a few one- off sessions, 
depending on the couple's request.

CONC LUSION

The IBSI model was developed by a team of clinicians, who are experts in designing and practic-
ing brief systemic couple and family therapy, and researchers, who are specialists in couple and 
family psychology and psychotherapy. Collaborative work between the clinicians and research-
ers occurred at each IBSI development stage: conceptualization, manualization, and implemen-
tation. Couple psychotherapy is both art and science (Soldz & McCullough, 2000); therefore, it 
requires a joint effort to understand how couples can change in therapy and improve different 
facets of their lives. Implementing a model such as IBSI has been a relatively smooth process, as 
this provides therapists with the freedom to use familiar systemic approaches in the populations 
with which they work. However, therapists also need to adopt a brief therapy framework and 
intervene more systematically than they normally would on integrating the marital and copar-
enting relationships. In addition, targeting the coparenting dimension is less common in marital 
therapy than in, for example, child and adolescent therapy. Therefore, couple therapists gener-
ally need to become more familiar with the theoretical and empirical aspects of coparenting to 
address marital and coparental relationships together in marital therapy. During IBSI training, 
they can learn to use these techniques in a balanced way.

This case provides an example of the IBSI therapeutic process. Here, the therapists’ strat-
egy was to reinforce the alliance between the partners as a coparenting and marital team by 
dealing with the husband's psychological disorder. Using narrative techniques, the objective 
was to help the couple externalize the husband's psychological problems to avoid saturating 
the problem with frustration or guilt (White, 2007). By first engaging the couple as coparents, 
the therapists speculated that the partners could be more empowered and motivated to func-
tion as a team if it was for the shared goal of improving their children's well- being. This work 
was first followed by strengthening the coparenting alliance, and then by sharing coparenting 
tensions as a dyad and not only as parents with opposing childrearing styles. This evolution in 
their coparenting relationship subsequently allowed deeper work on their marital difficulties.
Future results will document the efficacy of the model. Indeed, a randomized trial is cur-
rently underway to compare IBSI with systemic couple therapy, particularly regarding its effect 
on marital satisfaction and coparenting quality. In this trial a total of 101 couples living together 
and parenting a child under the age of 16 were recruited. The couples completed several self- 
report questionnaires on individual and relationship variables, and participated in videotaped 
discussions, before and after treatment and at follow- ups (Liekmeier et al., 2021). Preliminary 
data were obtained through a process study of six IBSI therapy cases (Eira Nunes, Pascual- 
Leone, et al., 2021) using the task analysis method (Task Analysis Method, Pascual- Leone et al., 
2014). This process study led to a model of moving from coparenting dissatisfaction to copar-
enting satisfaction through several stages of change (Eira Nunes, Pascual- Leone, et al., 2021).

IBSI  was  developed  to  offer  parents  who  engage  in  couple  therapy  a  more  nuanced  and 
targeted  outcome  than  that  available  in  traditional  therapy.  The  field  of  couple  therapy  is 
indeed characterized by a “conjugal vision” of both therapeutic work and its empirical evalua-
tion, omitting conceptualization and evaluation of work on the coparenting relationship with 
“parent couples” or “romantic coparents.” The development of specific models for parents in 
couple therapy is important in contemporary society, which is characterized by the dominant 
discourse of both being a successful parent and coparent (e.g., Meeussen & Van Laar, 2018) 
and having a fulfilling marriage. As such norms can put pressure on parents, these issues may 
be worth addressing in couple therapy. Furthermore, the high rate of separation and divorce 
indicates that it is important to work on coparenting relationships in not only separated cou-
ples but also intact marriages.

The conceptualization of integrative therapeutic work on both marital and coparenting rela-
tionships may be relevant in not only IBSI but also other settings, such as child and adolescent 
mental healthcare where, conversely, marital aspects may be given little consideration when

working with parents. Finally, this type of model may also be suitable for same- sex parent cou-
ples, step- parents (i.e. coparenting relationship between the biological parent and step- parent), 
or couples who choose to separate during couple therapy (Darwiche et al., 2021) to work on 
the distinct development of romantic and coparenting relationships and prevent possible neg-
ative  effects  on  children.  In  addition,  further  clinical  and  research  work  on  IBSI  involving 
couples from different cultural backgrounds will be needed to assess its suitability in diverse 
cultures. In some cultures, the concept of coparenting may be defined differently, especially 
when extended family members assume a significant role in coparenting a couple's children 
(e.g., Kurrien & Vo, 2004). More knowledge and experience with IBSI will make it possible to 
determine which techniques are particularly relevant and for whom, allowing the manual to be 
refined and inspiring new research questions regarding parents in couple therapy.
