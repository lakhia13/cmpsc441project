Abstract

Many chronic health concerns (obesity, addiction, stress, chronic pain and depression) have 
garnered recent attention for their increasing frequency, intractability, and serious health 
consequences. Because they are often difficult to treat and there are not always effective 
pharmacological treatments for these conditions, many patients are pursuing behavioral 
interventions for these conditions. Experimental behavioral intervention studies have shown some 
efficacy for health, but the mechanisms for these treatments are not well understood. Health 
Neuroscience is a burgeoning field that seeks to link neural function and structure with physical 
and mental health. Through this lens, initial studies have begun to investigate how behavioral 
interventions modulate neural function in ways that lead to improvements in health markers and 
outcomes. Here, we provide a review of these studies in terms of how they modulate key 
neurobiological systems, and how modulation of these systems relates to physical health and 
disease outcomes. We conclude with discussion of opportunities for future research in this 
promising area of study.

linking the brain with peripheral physiological processes and biomarkers,1–5 as well as 
health and disease outcomes.6 While this emerging body of work establishes initial 
relationships between the brain and markers of health, it is correlational. A key strategy for 
advancing a causal science linking neural processes with health is to manipulate brain 
activity, and one way to do so is through behavioral interventions. These behavioral 
interventions may manipulate brain systems in ways that impact health, aiding in our ability 
to make inferences about how changing brain systems relate to changes in health over time. 
While the behavioral intervention health neuroscience literature is still in its infancy, this 
review describes what we know about how behavioral interventions modulate neural 
systems, and how these changes in neural activity relate to health.

This review is organized by neurobiological systems and focuses on studies that explore how 
behavioral interventions affect the brain using functional analyses (see Tables 1–4). Thus, 
we have included studies that used task-based functional analyses, or those analyses that 
assess brain activity during specific tasks, and resting state connectivity, or those analyses 
that assess dynamic brain activity while participants are not actively engaged in a specific 
task. While there are exemplary studies of how acute manipulations of behavior impact the 
brain7,8 and how trait-level tendencies affect brain activity,9,10 this review focuses 
exclusively on longer-term behavioral interventions (multiple days or weeks) aimed at 
changing the brain and health outcomes. These behavioral interventions include mindfulness 
meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, diet, and exercise interventions, among others. 
Furthermore, we have prioritized studies in which functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) scans were collected both before and after the intervention to evaluate intervention-
related changes within the same participants, but there are also studies comparing brain 
activity at one time point following an intervention compared to a control.11–13 While we 
describe clinical samples (e.g., obese individuals, depressed patients, fibromyalgia patients), 
we also highlight work using preclinical samples (e.g., healthy young adults, age-matched 
individuals without disease), which provide a meaningful translational step between cross-
sectional or experimental studies and health interventions. After reviewing this emerging 
behavioral intervention health neuroscience literature, we conclude with some ideas for 
future research.

Plausible neurobiological systems

Basic research has revealed a few critical neurobiological systems that drive health, and are 
important candidate neural systems that could be changed with behavioral interventions. 
These systems are linked to biology, health behaviors or affective states, and could serve as 
potential mediators for intervention effects on health. These candidate neural systems 
include the threat and stress system, pain system, reward system, and the self and regulation 
system (Fig. 1). It is important to note there is some overlap between these systems, and 
some regions play important roles in multiple systems. Furthermore, the role each region 
might play in each system may be different, and there may be specificity in spatial location 
within the region depending on function (e.g. the central nucleus of the amygdala for stress, 
and the basolateral amygdala for reward).14

Threat and stress system

Page 3

It is well established that the brain coordinates fight-or-flight responses to stress, and this 
response plays an important role in survival, but can also increase wear-and-tear on 
physiological systems and increase susceptibility to stress-related health and disease 
outcomes.15 Behavioral interventions may modulate the threat and stress system in two 
ways: by buffering stress reactivity responses (turning down activity in limbic structures that 
gate the central fight-or-flight stress response), or by increasing top-down regulatory signals 
(increasing activity in cortical structures that gate top-down control of central fight-or-flight 
stress response). If behavioral interventions can modulate neural threat system dynamics, it 
would be expected that mitigating hyperactive or recurrent activation of the threat system 
could reduce peripheral stress response cascades and their associated effects on increasing 
risk for stress-related disease.16,17

The primary regions involved in stress and threat responding (Fig. 1, panel A) include those 
regions that detect threat and stress and those that translate this signal into peripheral stress 
responding via the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic–pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) axis. These regions include the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(dACC) and the anterior insula (AI), along with regions such as the hypothalamus and 
brainstem, which coordinate physiological stress response cascades.18 The amygdala is 
involved in fear and stress, and plays a role in the HPA axis and ANS responses to threats, 
through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem.19 Moreover, one study has found 
that hyperactivation of the amygdala is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), social phobia and other mental health conditions.20 One role of the dACC is in 
conflict detection and affective feelings of distress, including those following from threat or 
pain,21 and may affect the SNS arousal and HPA axis activity via projections to the 
amygdala and brainstem.22 The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) has also been 
implicated in emotional processing, and is linked to mood disorders.23,24 The sgACC has 
connections with the amygdala and other limbic structures, and research has shown that the 
stronger these functional connections, the more physiological stress reactivity to stressors.
25,26 Finally, the hypothalamus and brainstem serve as critical hubs linking higher-level 
cortical representations of stress with the generation of peripheral physiological stress 
response cascades in the HPA axis272625272416 and ANS.27,28 There are some promising 
initial studies, described below, which suggest that behavioral interventions can reduce 
reactivity and connectivity in regions in the threat system.

Similar to threat and stress, pain is an important survival signal. Indeed, pain is thought to be 
a signal to avoid or remove the painful stimulus.29 Experiencing pain thus activates 
physiological systems to help mobilize the individual to avoid the painful stimulus, but 
chronic neural activation can lead to burdensome hyperactivation of these physiological 
systems. Chronic pain conditions are thus marked by negative affect and downstream health 
consequences, and behavioral interventions have been shown to be helpful in reducing these 
consequences.30,31 Pain is often divided into four components: nociceptive/sensory signals 
that indicate the source and location of pain, perception (how the individual subjectively 
experiences the pain), the emotional experience (suffering), and the subsequent behaviors

(i.e., removing or avoiding the pain stimulus).30 Behavioral interventions are most likely to 
affect pain perception and emotions primarily, which could lead to changes in behavioral 
and physiological responses to pain.

Experimental and clinical brain mapping work has demonstrated that the sensory, affective 
and subsequent emotions of pain interact and rely on overlapping neural regions (Fig. 1, 
Panel B). Specifically, nociceptive responses to pain are meditated by regions such as the 
somatosensory area, insula and the posterior parietal cortex, followed by arousal and 
autonomic activation via amygdala, hypothalamus and the supplementary motor area 
(SMA).32 The AI is believed to be involved in interoceptive processes that lead to pain 
awareness.33,34 Specifically, the AI can serve to detect physiological arousal, linking pain 
signals to pain responding in the brain, via projections to the amygdala.35 The affective 
experience of pain seems to be associated with increases in the dACC and AI activity and 
subsequent emotions rely on prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions including the medial PFC 
(MPFC).21

Reward system

Adaptive behaviors, such as eating, reproduction and social connection, are key to survival 
and these important behaviors are reinforced via dopaminergic and opioidergic pathways in 
the central nervous system, dubbed the reward system.36 While reinforcement of these 
survival behaviors is adaptive when helping achieve homeostasis, sometimes these behaviors 
are reinforced past the point of homeostasis leading to obesity, addiction and other health 
conditions.37 Behavioral interventions could reduce the reinforcement of unhealthy 
behaviors, or help maximize the reinforcement of healthy behaviors via the brain’s reward 
system.

The reward system is a well-characterized and conserved mesolimbic dopamine pathway,38 
and human neuroimaging research has identified a few key hubs (Fig. 1, Panel C). The 
ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) is involved in processing valuation of a stimulus,38 and is 
known to inhibit threat and fear responding, including in fear extinction and pain.39–41 The 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is also involved in reward-related processing.42 (The VMPFC 
and OFC are sometimes labeled interchangeably in human neuroimaging studies.) The 
ventral striatum (VS) is a collection of regions within the basal ganglia mesolimbic system 
including the caudate nucleus, the caudate head, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventral 
portions of the putamen.43 The VS has connections to the thalamus and hypothalamus 
suggesting a plausible pathway from this region to downstream physiology.44 Other regions, 
including the insula and amygdala, have also been implicated in reward processing.45–47

The regions involved in the reward system can play an important role in biological systems 
underlying health, and moreover, reinforce behavior. The reward system serves to reinforce 
important survival-related behaviors, but dysregulation in this system is linked to a variety of 
poor health outcomes including obesity, PTSD and addiction48.

Self and regulation system

The “self” has been studied extensively in psychology and refers to a collection of processes 
that aid in how an individual understands himself/herself and engages with the world around

them, including behaviors and processes such as self-awareness, self-knowledge, and self-
control 49. Typically, individuals are motivated to behave in ways that are consistent with 
their self-concept,50 and thus self-related processes are often associated with self- and 
emotion regulation, necessary strategies for regulating behavior. Indeed, the individual’s 
self-concept and regulation behaviors are critically important for mental health outcomes 
and important health behaviors. For example, higher self-control is predictive of healthier 
eating behaviors and better weight loss,51 and more positive self-perceptions about aging 
lead to more preventative health behaviors and improved functional health in older adults.
52,53 A collection of regions in the brain (described below) have been identified as key 
regions involved in self and regulatory processes, and here we refer to this system of regions 
as the self and regulation system. Behavioral interventions can modulate the self and 
regulation system in important ways for subsequent behavior and health. Interventions could 
increase activity in this system, which could lead to better self- and emotion regulation, or 
reduce activity in this system to negative self-concepts. Either of these patterns of 
modulation within the self and regulation system plausibly leads to adjustments in behaviors 
and health outcomes.

The medial PFC (MPFC) is the primary neural region associated with thinking about 
oneself, and self-knowledge,54 and this region is linked to subsequent behavior, including 
health behaviors.55 Research also implicates the dACC in detecting conflicting information 
or representations of the self.56 Self-control is an important aspect of reducing (or never 
beginning) unhealthy behaviors, and the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), has been linked to self-
control and decision making.56,57 Regions involved in self-regulation include the 
dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the VMPFC (Fig. 1, 
Panel D).58–60 Beyond self-regulation behaviors, negative affect can also have both 
biological and behavioral effects on health, including increases in the sympathetic nervous 
system (SNS) activity and impaired decision-making abilities,61,62 emphasizing the 
importance of effective emotion regulation arising from the self. The ventrolateral PFC 
(VLPFC) has been shown to be one of the central regions involved in emotion regulation, 
particularly the right VLPFC.63 Additional emotion regulation regions include DMPFC, 
DLPFC and dACC.63

Some of the most significant advances in behavioral intervention health neuroscience 
research consist of links between activation of the self and regulation system and health 
behavior outcomes (e.g., smoking).64 Importantly, as we review below behavioral 
interventions that affect the self and regulation system (also see Table 4), intervention 
research in this area has shown that activity in the neural self and regulation system is 
predictive of health behaviors, and that reducing activity to negative self-beliefs may have 
important mental health benefits.

Studies linking behavioral interventions, the brain, and health

While the study of behavioral interventions is a relatively new area of health neuroscience, 
there are a collection of studies linking intervention effects to proximal health markers and 
more distal health and disease outcomes. Here we will review this work, organized by 
neurobiological system.

Behavioral interventions and the threat/stress neural system

Stress is well established to have important links to poor health.17 From the perspective of 
neural systems, if a behavioral intervention could effectively reduce the reactivity of this 
system, weaken connectivity between regions in this system, or trigger down regulation of 
this system, it could mitigate activation of the sympathetic–adrenal–medullary (SAM) and 
HPA axis response cascades and the cumulative wear-and-tear they have on physiological 
systems and health.15 Studies of interventions have begun to examine these possibilities 
using neuroimaging (Table 1).

One way to explore the possibility that behavioral interventions could lead to reduced threat 
reactivity is to study the effect of an intervention in a highly stressed population: patients 
with PTSD. Typically the amygdala is involved in threat processing and the VMPFC is 
involved in facilitating fear extinction.40 Patients with PTSD show enhanced amygdala 
activity and reduced PFC activity,65 this exaggerated reactivity and diminished top-down 
control suggests dysregulation in the threat system. However, when PTSD patients received 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a 12-week intervention aimed at restructuring unhelpful 
cognitive patterns and building coping skills, this dysregulation was altered. Specifically, 
PTSD patients after CBT treatment showed an increase in sgACC activity to a threat 
reactivity task (viewing threatening faces), an association between increased sgACC activity 
and decreased symptoms, and an association between decreased amygdala activity and 
decreased symptoms.66 While these results suggest that a behavioral intervention can alter 
threat system activity to stress and lead to changes in relevant symptoms, it is not yet clear 
whether and how this pattern of neural activity directly leads to changes in symptoms.

If amygdala and sgACC activity are important predictors of stress outcomes, it is possible 
that connectivity between these regions is important as well. Indeed, higher perceived stress 
is associated with greater amygdala–sgACC resting state functional connectivity.67 This 
altered connectivity may also be an important target for behavioral interventions for threat 
and stress. Mindfulness meditation interventions—which foster awareness and acceptance of 
present moment experience—have been shown to reduce stress reactivity in behavioral 
studies68–70 and thus may be one intervention that could alter neural threat system 
dynamics. Indeed, after a 3-day retreat-style mindfulness program (compared to a 3-day 
relaxation control program), stressed adults showed a decrease in the amygdala–sgACC 
connectivity at rest.67 Additionally, there was some initial indication that intervention 
changes in the amygdala–sgACC connectivity were associated with decreases in cumulative 
(hair-sampled) HPA axis activation, suggesting that altering the neural threat system may 
play a role in reducing peripheral stress response system dynamics over time.67

It is also possible that behavioral interventions can increase top-down regulation of the 
targeted neurobiological system.71 For example, there is some initial evidence that 
mindfulness interventions can increase resting state functional connectivity of regions 
known to be important in executive control and top-down regulation.72,73 We recently 
showed that mindfulness training increases functional connectivity at rest (i.e., the PCC in 
the Default Mode Network) with regulatory regions of the PFC (DLPFC), relative to a 
relaxation training comparison group.72 The DLPFC is a region implicated in emotion 
regulation,63 and as such this connectivity pattern may represent a potential strengthening of

top-down executive control after mindfulness training. Notably, we found that this increased 
connectivity pattern was associated with intervention-driven reductions in inflammation at 
follow-up.72 Likewise, in a separate mindfulness intervention study with veterans with 
PTSD, increased connectivity between the PCC and DLPFC was also associated with 
reductions in PTSD symptoms,74 suggesting that these connectivity changes have important 
implications for both stress biology (interleukin [IL]-6) and stress-related (PTSD) 
symptoms.

While there is a large cross-sectional literature relating activation of the neurobiological 
threat system with increased stress and health risks,15,17 less is known about how behavioral 
interventions (or stress reduction interventions specifically) might modulate this system. We 
have described some initial intervention evidence suggesting that this is a promising area of 
inquiry, particularly since there is a large behavioral literature linking interventions with 
salutary stress-related health and disease outcomes.68,75,76

Behavioral interventions and the neural pain system

Pain is a common and distressing health concern that leads to significant healthcare costs, 
missed workdays, and decreased quality of life.77 Moreover, pain that causes patients to 
have difficulty completing typical daily activities is associated with poor health behaviors—
including physical inactivity, sleep insufficiency, and smoking—and greater mental health 
symptoms.78 Thus, altering patients’ experiences of pain could boost health by helping 
improve quality of life and facilitating healthy behaviors. With the risks of uncomfortable 
side effects and addiction with opioid pain relievers and other pharmacological treatments, 
behavioral interventions might be an important alternative (Table 2). These interventions 
could lead to changes in neural responses to pain perceptions and pain affect, or could 
trigger increased neural coping and control mechanisms to manage pain.

In order to explore whether a behavioral intervention could alter perceptions of pain and 
subsequent affect, some work has used experimentally manipulated pain relevant to a 
patient’s diagnosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder 
with abdominal pain as one of the hallmark symptoms. Some over-the-counter pain 
medications can cause irritation in the gut; therefore, many patients seek out alternative 
therapies for their pain. Gut-directed hypnotherapy has been shown to have some efficacy in 
alleviating IBS symptoms for patients.79 To explore the neural mechanism, IBS participants 
did either a gut-direct hypnotherapy intervention or educational intervention, and completed 
baseline and post-therapy scans while experiencing high- and low-intensity rectal 
distensions. Regardless of condition, IBS patients felt similar symptom reduction after 
treatment.80 Patients who responded to hypnotherapy treatment showed reduced AI activity 
to the high intensity distention after treatment compared to baseline, and more of a decrease 
in AI activity to the low-intensity distention compared to the education group.80 While this 
suggests that both hypnotherapy and patient education can reduce symptom burden for IBS 
patients, hypnotherapy may alter neural pain responding differently than patient education 
interventions, particularly for experiences of low-intensity pain.

Relatedly, interventions that affect connectivity within this system could also lead to changes 
in pain symptoms. Fibromyalgia—a condition characterized by chronic, widespread pain—

has increasingly become a condition of interest for intervention studies, as it is difficult to 
treat. Recent work has found that physical exercise interventions may be effective in 
reducing pain and fatigue in patients, but the neural mechanisms are poorly understood.81 
Fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls engaged in a 15-week exercise intervention, and 
completed a resting state scan before and after the intervention. At baseline, the patients 
showed decreased connectivity between pain and sensorimotor brain regions compared to 
healthy controls.82 However, after the intervention, patients showed greater connectivity 
between the AI and primary sensorimotor areas, and this connectivity looked more similar to 
healthy controls.83 This suggests that an exercise intervention can lead to stronger 
connectivity between pain and sensorimotor regions; however, these changes in neural 
connectivity were not associated with changes in symptoms. While it is currently unclear 
how changes in resting state connectivity in the pain system might be linked to changes in 
chronic pain symptoms, one possibility is that this increase in neural connectivity between a 
nociception region and a feedback loop may provide for more efficient regulation to 
decrease pain.

Finally, behavioral interventions for pain could also increase activity in regions associated 
with cognitive control that could facilitate down regulation of pain responding. One 
intervention of interest is mindfulness meditation, as there is evidence that mindfulness 
training can lead to pain relief.84 In healthy adults, reductions in self-reported pain intensity 
ratings to a thermal pain probe after a 4-day mindfulness training intervention were 
associated with increased activity in the ACC and AI; similarly, reductions in self-reported 
pain unpleasantness after the intervention were associated with increased OFC activity.85 
These findings were replicated again following another 4-day mindfulness training 
intervention and these effects were observed above and beyond placebo or sham mindfulness 
meditation comparison groups.86 Across these two studies, mindfulness meditation pain 
relief was associated with changes in activity in cognitive control regions, suggesting that 
mindfulness may also promote activity in top-down regulatory systems to help individuals 
cope with pain.

Based on these findings, it is possible that behavioral interventions for pain could be relying 
on neural mechanisms to modify pain responding or to enhance coping to the pain 
experience. Across two studies with chronic pain patients, interventions were shown to 
reduce neural pain processing or enhance connectivity within the pain system. Preclinical 
work found that behavioral interventions could also enhance neural coping resources, 
although the correlation with pain in daily life for chronic pain sufferers is not yet known. 
As these two interventions elicited slightly different changes in the pain system (decreasing 
responding or increasing coping), it is possible that there are multiple mechanisms by which 
behavioral interventions could affect pain. Moreover, it is possible that certain types of pain 
or certain patient characteristics could influence which neural mechanisms could lead to 
beneficial health effects. Understanding the mechanisms for each intervention could provide 
greater insight into which interventions might be most effective under certain circumstances.

Behavioral interventions and the neural reward system

A broad range of health conditions, including obesity, and substance abuse and addiction, 
have been linked to reward system dysfunction.87 Some behavioral interventions have been 
shown to be modestly effective at treating these disorders and unhealthy behavior patterns.
88,89 If interventions could reduce neural reward responding to poor health behaviors, or 
enhance reward responding to healthier behaviors, this could lead to improvements in these 
health conditions (Table 3).

Studies have explored the possibility that behavioral interventions might affect the neural 
reward reinforcement of unhealthy behaviors. For example, an individual’s reward system is 
implicated in both obesity and resistance to weight loss, as there appears to be relative 
hyperactivation in the reward system to anticipating high-calorie foods for obese individuals 
compared to lean individuals.90 High-calorie foods are known to be more rewarding than 
low-calorie foods,91 but individuals who show increased reward activation to viewing these 
foods are more likely to gain weight.92 However, recent work from two intervention studies 
demonstrates that, after a weight loss intervention, obese individuals showed a significant 
decrease in VS activity to high-calorie versus low-calorie food images at follow-up,93 and a 
decrease in activation to high-calorie food images in the MPFC from baseline to follow-up.
94 Moreover, participants who had relatively low insula activity to high-calorie food images 
at post-intervention, compared to baseline, tended to be more successful at weight 
maintenance.94 Similar to weight-loss interventions, acute exercise (compared to no 
exercise) has been shown to lead to reduced activity to food cues (vs. control) in the OFC, 
insula and VS,95 suggesting that an exercise intervention could effectively reduce neural 
reward responding to unhealthy food. Furthermore, following a walking-based exercise 
intervention, individuals showed reduced activity in the insula when viewing food cues 
compared to baseline, and this decrease in insula activity was correlated with greater 
decreases in body weight and fat mass.96 In concert, these findings demonstrate that 
restructuring reward-related neural responding to food cues might be one plausible neural 
mechanism by which behavioral interventions could lead to changes in obesity-related 
health outcomes.

Taken together, it seems that, for a health condition (obesity) characterized by exceptionally 
difficult to change behaviors, interventions that reduced neural reward activity to these 
unhealthy behaviors may help to lessen the reinforcing nature of them in ways that enhance 
health. It will be important to investigate whether other behavioral interventions can reduce 
reward system activity to unhealthy behaviors and lead to improvements in other health 
conditions. Some behavioral interventions have also been shown to lead to greater 
engagement in healthy behaviors, such as eating more vegetables.97 Cross-sectional work 
has found that reward-related activity is associated with increases in physical activity, 
suggesting that interventions could also affect health by increasing the reinforcement value 
of healthy behaviors that may be difficult to maintain over time.98 Future work in this area 
could explore whether enhanced reward-related neural activity to engaging in healthier 
behaviors like this may be a mediator for downstream health benefits.

Behavioral interventions and the self and regulation system

Critical to our health is the ability to understand whether information is relevant to us, as 
well as the ability to regulate the thoughts, feelings and behaviors that arise during daily life. 
The role of the self and regulation system in these behaviors is central, and changes in 
patterns of neural activity in this system may lead to increases in subsequent healthy 
choices. Behavioral interventions could affect the self and regulation system in important 
ways for health by increasing activity or connectivity in the system, supporting greater self- 
and emotion regulation. It is also possible that behavioral interventions could reduce activity 
in this system to change problematic self-perceptions and reduce negative self-concepts 
(Table 4).

From public health messaging campaigns to receiving medical advice from a physician, 
humans are regularly provided important and potentially life-saving health information. In 
order for the person to engage in the healthy behaviors promoted in these messages, they 
must see the message as being self-relevant. Recent research has found the more self-related 
MPFC activity to these health messages, the more people are likely to change their behavior. 
Specifically this has been demonstrated in health messages to encourage sunscreen use,55 
reduce smoking,64,99,100 and increase physical activity.98 The MPFC activity was also 
shown to be effective in predicting behavior above and beyond self-reports.64 Importantly, 
when these health messages are tailored to the individual they are more effective than when 
they are more generic,100 supporting the idea that this self-relevance is important for the 
subsequent behavior change. It may also be the case that other varieties of health messaging 
(e.g., patient-provider communication or patient health education materials) have similar 
neural mechanisms, and further research can help explore these possibilities.

One form of self-regulation is emotion regulation, an important strategy that has 
implications for mental health and behavior.101 It is possible that behavioral interventions 
can lead to increases in emotion-regulation activity to negative events; for example, 
increasing emotion regulation to experiences of pain in fibromyalgia patients. One such 
study examined the effect of CBT on emotion regulation activity in fibromyalgia patients. 
Patients were randomly assigned to either CBT or waitlist control; before and after 
treatment, they completed fMRI scans while receiving pressure pain stimulation. After CBT, 
fibromyalgia patients showed increased VLPFC activity to pressure pain compared to 
baseline, but the control group did not see this increase.102 CBT also led to increased 
VLPFC–thalamus connectivity, but there was no change in the control group.102 If the 
thalamus serves as a major relay hub in the brain, and the VLPFC is an emotion regulation 
region, increased connectivity between these regions could lead to changes in how pain 
affects downstream consequences for patients. Indeed, there was a correlation between 
increased VLPFC activity to pain and decreases in anxiety after CBT treatment.102 These 
findings suggest that behavioral interventions could modulate the self and regulation system 
activity in emotion regulation regions, enhance regulation region connectivity with an 
important physiological communication hub, and this modulation in activity could be 
associated with improvements in associated symptoms.

Some health conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD) have been linked to a 
bias towards negative social information and pervasive, negative self-thoughts.103 Thus,

reducing activity in the self and regulation system to these negative stimuli might have 
implications for mental health outcomes by reducing the likelihood that they continue the 
cycle of negative thoughts characterized by this disorder. For example, patients with MDD 
often have shown greater activity in the MPFC during self-referential processing of negative 
words, whereas healthy controls showed greater MPFC activity to positive self-referential 
processing.104 CBT, a well-established treatment for MDD, may help MDD patients 
restructure negative thoughts about themselves. Following a 12-week CBT program, the 
activity in MPFC and ventral ACC increased for positive, self-related stimuli and decreased 
for negative, self-related stimuli compared to baseline in MDD patients.104 Moreover, 
improvements in depressive symptoms corresponded with the lower ventral ACC activity 
during negative self-referential processing.104 These findings suggest that effective 
interventions for mood disorders may include decreasing negative self-beliefs, and the neural 
mechanism for these improvements is likely through self and regulation systems.

The exciting early work showing that MPFC activity is predictive of changes in health 
behaviors presents the self and regulation system as a prime candidate for studying the 
neural mechanisms for how interventions may change subsequent behavior. Here, behavioral 
interventions led to increased activity or connectivity in emotion and self-regulation regions 
that related to changes in health markers or outcomes, suggesting that increased self and 
regulation system activity may be one way behavioral interventions influence health. 
Another mechanism described was reduced self and regulation system activity to negative 
self-beliefs, which had important downstream health benefits as well. Thus, modulating 
activity in the self and regulation system is an important area of interest for future studies 
exploring links between interventions and health behaviors.

Discussion and future directions

Health neuroscience is a relatively new research domain,105 and there is still much work to 
be done linking behavioral interventions to the brain and health. The initial studies we have 
reviewed here suggest that evaluating intervention effects for health, using a neurobiological 
systems approach, will help reveal how these interventions enact change and elucidate the 
biological mechanisms and cascades that drive health outcomes over time. In addition, 
manipulating behavioral processes can be quite informative. As the father of social 
psychology, Kurt Lewin, once said, “If you truly want to understand something, try to 
change it.”106 Thus, interventions can be one tool for expanding knowledge on the 
associations between neural processes and health, and can provide information on the best 
intervention method for targeting the specific behavioral processes of interest. Specifically, 
by working to change behaviors, knowledge can be gained about the etiology and 
persistence of the behavior; similarly, by identifying mechanisms for interventions, the key 
components or boundary conditions of the intervention can be identified and lead to 
improvements in intervention delivery and efficacy. The work in this area has just begun, 
and future research should continue to investigate the health neuroscience of behavioral 
interventions, as there is significant value in moving toward causal models of health and 
behavior by manipulating the brain with interventions.

Our review (also see Tables 1–4) provides some initial promising indications for how 
behavioral interventions affect neurobiological systems and health. Quite a bit of research 
has pointed to stress as a potent detriment to health, and many behavioral interventions aim 
to reduce stress to improve health.17 Decreased activity in the threat system following a CBT 
treatment for PTSD patients was associated with improvements in PTSD symptomatology.66 
Mindfulness intervention led to reductions in connectivity within this system in stressed 
adults, and this shift in connectivity was associated with reduced measures of cumulative 
activation of the HPA system.67 Finally, mindfulness also led stressed adults to show 
enhanced connectivity within cognitive control regions, and this served as a mediator for 
reductions in inflammation.72 This final study was one of the few to explicitly test neural 
changes as a mediator for biological health markers. However, it is still unclear exactly what 
these changes in connectivity mean or how they are associated with health outcomes. 
Considering the interest in stress reduction interventions, the threat system is still 
understudied. However, the work reviewed here shows that behavioral interventions can 
modulate the neural threat system in ways that influence stress and stress physiology, and 
future research can determine how these pathways may influence disease outcomes.

Chronic pain is a complex and difficult diagnosis and many pharmaceutical treatments are 
ineffective or produce side effects, leading to a recent increase in attention to behavioral 
interventions for pain. Here, we reviewed a few studies investigating the neural mechanisms 
of these interventions, two of which were conducted with chronic pain samples. Gut-directed 
hypnotherapy led to reduced pain system activity to pain stimulation for IBS patients, and 
exercise led to greater connectivity between nociception and pain regions for fibromyalgia 
patients, showing that behavioral interventions might alter how individuals respond to pain 
neurally.80,83 In healthy adults without a chronic pain diagnosis, mindfulness training led to 
greater activity in cognitive control regions in response to pain stimulation, providing a 
foundation for future work exploring the effect of mindfulness interventions on chronic pain.
85 However, so far this work has not linked changes in neural activity or connectivity with 
changes in chronic pain symptoms for patients, an important avenue for future research.

Dysregulation in the neural reward system is linked to health conditions such as obesity and 
addiction.87 Behavioral interventions that aim to change these health conditions would 
therefore logically target the reward system. Indeed, we reviewed work showing that various 
interventions reduced reward system activity to cues related to the health condition of study 
(i.e., food images for individuals with obesity).93,94,96,107,108 Importantly, some of these 
studies found associations between changes in neural activity and important health markers. 
For example, after a weight loss intervention, decreased insula activity to high calorie food 
images was associated with more successful weight maintenance.94 Behavioral interventions 
can reduce reward activity to unhealthy behaviors, but less work has yet examined how 
interventions might increase reward activity to healthy behaviors to reinforce them. 
Although there are some promising initial studies showing higher neural reward activity is 
linked to better health behavior,13,98 future work can assess changes in neural reward 
activity from before to after treatment. In addition, it is not clear how long-lasting these 
effects are, with the obvious implication that the longer the effects persist, perhaps the more 
powerful the behavior change, particularly for those behaviors that are tenaciously difficult 
to modify (e.g., exercise). These studies provide a compelling foundation for future

behavioral intervention work that aims to adjust neural reward activity to change health 
behavior.

The self and regulation system is the most studied system in the health neuroscience of 
behavioral interventions, perhaps because behavioral interventions often aim to change how 
individuals cope with or regulate their behaviors and emotions—two essential roles of the 
self and regulation system. Critically, there is a body of work showing that the activity 
within this system is predictive of a variety of health behaviors, underscoring the value of 
interventions that affect this system.55 For patients who completed CBT, greater activity in 
emotion regulation regions to pain stimulation was linked to changes in anxiety, an 
important symptom of fibromyalgia that can exacerbate disability.102 In a population of 
MDD patients, CBT led to greater decreases in self and regulation system activity to 
negative information and parallel improvements in depressive symptoms.104 Together, these 
results identify self-related processes as important contributors to health, and that 
interventions that help promote changes in neural activity underlying these processes may 
serve as a mechanism for health enhancement. Future work can provide a greater 
understanding of how behavioral interventions change activity within this system, how they 
are linked to behavior and affect, and, importantly, whether these changes are associated 
with improvements in health outcomes.

To date, most research has focused on examining how behavioral interventions alter brain 
function (and functional connectivity), while less research has evaluated how behavioral 
interventions impact brain structure. This is an exciting area, and some initial studies show 
experiences can affect brain structure (e.g., stress can increase amygdala volume), but also 
that some therapies and medications can alter brain structure as well.109 It is reasonable to 
hypothesize that some behavioral interventions could change brain structure in ways that 
confer health benefits, and a few initial studies have explored this possibility.110 Structural 
changes in the brain have been found to drive some functional effects in the brain as well,26 
therefore building out these structural-functional relationships when studying the health 
neuroscience of behavioral interventions is of value.

There are some methodological considerations in this new area of inquiry. First, much of the 
intervention research focuses on changes in neural activity and links to more proximal health 
outcomes (e.g., weight loss, anxiety, IL-6), but less work has been conducted linking 
intervention related changes in neural activity or connectivity with more distal health 
outcomes (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease outcomes). Relatedly, most studies did not 
test changes in neural activity or connectivity as a statistical mediator of health, although 
there is some initial work adopting this approach.72 New toolboxes and methods for 
conducting brain-based mediation analyses are now available for accelerating research in 
this area.111 Additionally, as this area of study is still developing, it will be important to 
continue to replicate and extend these findings to related populations. A good example of 
this model is the work that explores the MPFC activity as a predictor for health behaviors; 
this effect has been replicated across a variety of studies, with varying health message 
formats and targeted health behaviors.55,64,112 Indeed, converging, replicable evidence is 
still needed to fully identify the neural mechanisms of interest for health interventions.

Increasingly, patients are turning to behavioral interventions for helping manage some of 
their health concerns. Indeed, some patients are faced with potential medication side effects, 
treatments that only target the specific biological concern (i.e., chemotherapy targets the 
tumor but does not alleviate psychological distress from the cancer diagnosis), or health 
concerns that are marked by behaviors that are extremely difficult to change. Behavioral 
interventions may address some of these concerns, and importantly, can be used in 
combination with most pharmacological or procedural treatments. Health neuroscience has 
begun to explore the neural mechanisms that might underlie the health benefits of these 
behavioral interventions. Here, we have reviewed work that has explored how long-term 
behavioral interventions modulate neural activity in ways that lead to improvements in 
health outcomes. We organized these findings by the neural system intervention modulates, 
which helps to identify the target neural systems for future work. Indeed, this review 
suggests that interventions that are built to change stress physiology might reasonably look 
to connectivity within the threat system as a candidate system to affect. Although many of 
the interventions that found changes in neural pain system activity did not link this activity 
to a health outcome specifically, it is likely that modulating this system could lead to 
changes in how individuals perceive and respond to their pain, which could have important 
long-term benefits for chronic pain patients. If a behavioral intervention were intended to 
restructure the reinforcing nature of certain health behaviors, to reduce poor health behaviors 
or increase good health behaviors, the results we presented would point to the reward system 
as an important mechanism to explore. And finally, the self and regulation system appears to 
be an important marker of self-relevance and regulation success. Therefore, interventions 
that want to shift the individual’s beliefs about their self or help them regulate their emotions 
and behaviors to be consistent with their view of self could reasonably hypothesize that the 
intervention should modulate self and regulation system activity. While the health 
neuroscience of behavioral interventions is still a young area of study, identifying the neural 
mechanisms that lead to changes in health has importance for a wide range of individuals 
interested in complementary treatments for their health. With increased knowledge of the 
neural mechanisms of behavioral interventions, more effective interventions can be 
developed. Future work on interventions can continue to explore theoretically sound possible 
neural mediators, investigate these patterns in clinical populations of interest, and link these 
neural mechanisms to relevant health markers and outcomes for maximum impact.

Figure 1. 
Neural systems modulated by behavioral interventions. (A, B, C, D) Neural regions 
hypothesized to be part of the Threat and Stress System (blue, A), Pain System (red, B), 
Reward System (purple, C), and Self and Regulation System (green, D). Regions involved in 
threat and stress include the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala (amyg), and 
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Pain system regions include dACC (top), 
anterior insula (AI; middle), and somatosensory cortex (bottom). Regions involved in reward 
processing include the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex 
(VMPFC, OFC; top) and the AI and ventral striatum (VS; bottom). Regions involved in the 
self and regulation system include the dACC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), 
medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and VMPFC (top), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) and ventrolateral cortex (VLPFC; bottom).
