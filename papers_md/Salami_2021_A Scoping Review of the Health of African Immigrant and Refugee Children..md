Abstract: Migration is a growing phenomenon around the world, including within the African
continent. Many migrants, especially African children, face challenges related to health and social in-
clusion and can face increased health risks. A systematic scoping review of available literature on the
health of African migrant children across the globe was conducted to offer insight into these health
risks. The review was conducted over a 15-month period from January 2019 to April 2020, yielding
6602 articles once duplicates were removed. This search included electronic databases, reference
lists of articles reviewed, and searches of libraries of relevant organisations. A total of 187 studies
met the inclusion criteria, of which 159 were quantitative, 22 were qualitative, and 6 used mixed
methods. The ﬁndings reveal decreased health in this population in areas of nutrition, infectious
diseases, mental health, birth outcomes, sexual and reproductive health, physical and developmental
health, parasitic infections, oral health, respiratory health, preventative health, endocrine disorders,
health care services, and haematological conditions. The ﬁndings offer insights into factors inﬂu-
encing the health of African immigrant and refugee children. Further studies, especially qualitative
studies, are needed to determine barriers to service access after migration and to investigate other
underexplored and overlooked health concerns of African migrant children, including pneumonia
and child maltreatment.

Keywords: migration; health; child health; Africa

1. Introduction

Global migration is a growing phenomenon heavily inﬂuenced by global economic, so-
cial, political, and technological transformations, and climate change [1]. The International
Organisation for Migration [1] estimates that of some 272 million international migrants,

of which approximately 31 million (13.9%) are children ages 0 to 18 years old. Migration
commonly follows a pattern of movement from low- to higher-income countries, including
within the African continent, which has a growing number of migrants. In 2019, there were
approximately 39.5 million African migrants, of which 21 million moved within African
countries and 18.5 million migrated outside of Africa [1]. The vast majority of migrants are
labour migrants.

While migrants make signiﬁcant contributions to the economic, socio-cultural, and
political growth of their destination countries, they also face challenges related to health
and social inclusion. Migration can lead to increased health risks, but also potentially
to improved health for those who seek safety, including children [1]. Differences and
complexities are related to the health of migrants, including issues that cross racial, ethnic,
and generational lines. While research has identiﬁed a health advantage for economic im-
migrants, compared to the domestic population of host countries (a phenomenon known as
the healthy immigrant effect), the case is not the same for refugees who ﬂee their countries
for safety [2–4]. Research also points to poorer mental health among second-generation
immigrant children, compared to ﬁrst-generation immigrants [5,6]. First-generation immi-
grant children have been shown to demonstrate better mental health than non-immigrant
children [5], which is evidence of the healthy immigrant effect [6]. However, favourable
health status among immigrants may be due to the fact that previous research has often
combined all immigrant children without considering the differences among them. For
instance, immigrant children and youth from certain regions of Africa, especially those
who are refugees, have poorer mental health status than non-immigrant children [7]. The
distinct health vulnerabilities faced by African immigrant children create a need to address
the mental health of this population. This paper presents the results of a scoping review of
the literature on the health of African migrant children (AMC).

Health is a human right that can inﬂuence the ability to enjoy other rights. However,
many African migrants experience health challenges upon settlement in a new country [8,9].
Pre-migration factors (e.g., experience of trauma) and post-migration challenges (e.g., ac-
cess to health care) contribute to the health of immigrants in destination countries [1,10].
A scoping review that included 14 articles found that culture, religious beliefs, linguistic
barriers, and barriers accessing health care contributed to the health of African immigrants
in the United States [8]. Barriers to access to health care for this population include cost,
health system complexity, lack of culturally competent health providers, long wait times,
and discrimination [8,11]. Moreover, despite an overall higher level of education than
native-born populations and other immigrant groups, African migrants to high-income
countries often experience a higher rate of poverty, a key social determinant of health [12].
Evidence suggests that income is a major contributor to immigrant health [13]. As is the
case with other marginalised groups, social determinants of health play a critical role in
the decline of immigrant health after a period of time in the destination country [13], and
this is especially true for African immigrants [9]. The poor social outcomes of immigrants
extend to the health of their children, which is particularly the case for African migrants
who often have to juggle multiple jobs to earn the income necessary to meet the health
needs of their children [14]. Poor social outcomes of immigrant parents impose inter-
generational consequences, whereby second-generation immigrant children experience
poorer health outcomes than their parents [15,16]; again, this is most evident in the case of
African immigrants.

Immigrant and refugee children experience several health challenges upon arrival in
their destination countries. Despite the fact that these children’s health should be protected
as a human right, overwhelming evidence from systematic reviews indicates refugee
children experience poor mental health status, especially post-traumatic stress [17–19].
Pre-migration experience and post-migration stress contribute to the mental health of
refugee children [17]. Social support, sense of belonging, and connection to home culture
can improve resilience in this population and contribute to improved mental health [20].
Immigrant and refugee children also experience physical health problems, including

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

anaemia, haemoglobinopathies, chronic hepatitis B, latent tuberculosis infection, intestinal
infection, oral health problems, vitamin D deﬁciency, wasting, and stunting [21,22]. While
several systematic reviews have been published on the health of immigrant and refugee
children, we found none that focus on the health of African immigrant children; previous
reviews often combined African immigrant children with other immigrants and lacked
an in-depth analysis of their particular vulnerabilities. Thus, a review of existing studies
is necessary to ﬁll this gap. A review focusing on African immigrant children’s health is
particularly important given the poor health status of African immigrants [7,8]. Further
study of the health status of African immigrants is also needed to ensure and inform the
development of relevant interventions. Interventions should involve the participation of,
and centre the voices of, African migrant and refugee children.

2. Materials and Methods

A scoping review is appropriate for identifying existing research activity on a particu-
lar topic and key research gaps [23,24]. We conducted a systematic scoping review over
a 15-month period from January 2019 to April 2020. This review followed the ﬁve-stage
approach to scoping reviews as outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [25]: developing the
research question; identifying the relevant studies; selecting the articles; data charting
and data extraction; and collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. The review
has been reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), Extension for Scoping Review Guidelines [26].

Stage 1 aimed to reﬁne questions on the body of evidence related to African immigrant

and refugee children. Our research questions were as follows:

1. What is the scope, range, and nature of evidence on the health of African migrant children?
2. What is known from the existing literature on the health of African migrant children?

Stage 2 involved identifying the relevant studies. The search included electronic
databases, a reference list of articles reviewed, and searches of libraries of relevant organisa-
tions. The following databases were searched on 21 January 2019 by a health science librar-
ian: Medline, Embase, Ovid Global Health, Ovid PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, CINAHL,
SocIndex; EBSCO Child Development and Adolescent Studies, ProQuest Sociological Ab-
stracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. The search terms used represent
associated keyword combinations of child health, immigrant health, and Africa (Table 1:
Search Terms). A total of 12,720 records were identiﬁed and retrieved, and 6602 records
remained after duplicates were removed. These articles were exported into Covidence,
an online software that works in collaboration with Cochrane to enhance the selection
and completion of systematic reviews. This software allows for independent reviewers to
screen records based on inclusion criteria. Results were checked by two research assistants.

Stage 3 involved article selection. Two research assistants independently selected and
reviewed each article that met the following inclusion criteria: (1) focus on the health of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

African child migrants and refugees; (2) child’s age is between 0 and 18 years old; (3) child
is either a ﬁrst-generation or second-generation immigrant; (4) report original research
studies; and (5) data are on children who crossed an international border. We excluded
articles related to internally displaced children and internal migrants because they are
still located within the same country and policy jurisdiction. We also excluded articles on
African American children (in which information was not provided on whether they are
immigrants), African Caribbean children, and articles that focused on the challenges of
parents without sufﬁcient information on the health of the child. We also excluded articles
that did not have disaggregated data on African immigrant children (e.g., those in which
data on African immigrants were combined with other immigrants). All publications such
as conference abstracts, literature reviews, book chapters, brief reports or case reports,
posters, study protocols, and theses that did not qualify as an empirical output were also
excluded (see list in the ﬂow chart). Screening of titles and abstracts and excluding articles
resulted in a remaining 615 articles. Only articles published in English and Spanish were
included. We screened the full text of all 615 and rejected another 426 based on the inclusion
criteria to arrive at 187 articles used in the analysis (see Figure 1 for PRISMA ﬂow chart).
At each stage, disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus or by
a third reviewer.

Stage 4 involved data charting and data extraction. The following information was
extracted from each of the 187 articles: author(s) name, year of publication, research
questions or objectives, theoretical framework, method (sampling, sample size, age of
the child, data source (parent vs. child vs. health professional vs. medical records vs.
clinical assessment vs. laboratory tests), clinical area of focus (e.g., mental health, nutrition,
cardiovascular health), period of data collection, country of origin or region, destination
country or region, and summary of ﬁndings. In total, six research assistants extracted and
collated data. Each paper was reviewed by one research assistant and veriﬁed by another
for accuracy. The research assistants received four hours of training on scoping reviews
and attended weekly meetings to discuss emerging ﬁndings.

Stage 5 involved collating, summarizing, and reporting the results. Given the vast
number of articles included, we coded and summarised data based on areas of focus and
thematically analysed the content. We also compared data across the coding segments. The
purpose of the comparison was to identify relevant linkages (relationships, interactions,
and consequences) across data. Numerical data are represented using descriptive statistics,
frequencies, measures of central tendency, and measures of variability. As a scoping review,
the purpose is to map out the existing evidence and summarise key study ﬁndings within
different domains rather than evaluate the quality of individual studies to determine the
risk of bias related to particular outcomes. Hence, in line with the review aim of providing
an overview of the existing evidence base, a formal quality assessment of each study was
not undertaken [25].

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of Included Studies

A total of 187 studies were ultimately included in this scoping review (Figure 1).
Supplementary Table S1 shows the key characteristics of the articles. The majority of
the studies were quantitative (n = 159), with less representation in terms of qualitative
(n = 22) and mixed methods (n = 6) research. The oldest year of publication was 1965,
and the most recent article was published in 2019. The majority of studies either did not
mention their sampling method (n = 133) or utilised a non-probabilistic method (n = 42).
Data were collected from diverse sources including children, parents, medical records,
national registries, and health care professionals. The top three modes of data collection
were via multiple methods (n = 63), surveys and questionnaires (n = 38), and diagnostic or
laboratory testing (n = 34). Few studies reported the use of a theoretical framework (n = 10);
those that did, used frameworks based on health services for community living, cognitive
theory, a social-ecological framework, a cultural competence framework, the health access
model and household resources model, anthropological theory, the theory of segmental
assimilation, narrative inquiry and ethnographic impressionism, and transgenerational
trauma transference.

3.2. Characteristics of Study Participants

A broad range of children’s ages was examined: under 1 year old (n = 25), 1–6 years
old (n = 30), 7–11 years old (n = 22), and 12–18 years old (n = 133). Most studies either
reported on migrants from multiple countries (n = 37) or generalised to migrants from
Africa (n = 28). Others reported participants were from Somalia (n = 27), Ethiopia (n = 24),
and sub-Saharan Africa (n = 13). European (n = 69) and African (n = 39) countries were
the primary destinations, although a notable number of studies were conducted in Israel
(n = 26), the United States (n = 22), and Australia (n = 21).

3.3. Identiﬁed Themes

The studies included in this review report on 11 areas of health, namely, infectious
diseases (n = 25), including parasitic infections (n = 17); nutrition (n = 40); mental health
(n = 28); birth outcomes and sexual/reproductive health (n = 23); physical and develop-
mental health (n = 19); oral health (n = 16); respiratory health (n = 9); preventative health

(n = 8); endocrine health (n = 8); health care services (n = 8); and haematological conditions
(n = 5).

3.3.1. Infectious Diseases, Including Parasitic Infections

Overall, 25 of the articles focus on infectious diseases [27–51]. The literature indicates
high rates of human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection in AMC [45–50], and Ger-
many [51]. Studies in Israel and Belgium found a high prevalence of mother-to-child HIV
transmissions [45,48]. AMC living with HIV in the United States and the Netherlands
are often diagnosed in the host country, with antiretroviral therapy started at an older
age [47,50] However, HIV-infected parents migrating to Sweden are unlikely to disclose
their status to their children due to fear of double stigma [46].

Research shows hepatitis A and B are prevalent among AMC in Italy and Spain [27,28].
Similarly, problems with Chlamydia trachomatis, cholera, and varicella-zoster virus are
evident in AMC in the United States and Algeria [29–31]. The presence of measles and
rubella also affects the health of AMC in Cameroon and Cote d’Ivoire [32,33], as did
Heliobacter pylori in Australia, although the latter was reduced by premigration antimalar-
ial therapy [34–37]. Tinea capitis is a common infectious disease among AMC in New
Zealand [38], Israel [39], Spain [40,41], and Australia [42]. Other scalp infections from Tri-
chophyton violaceum and Trishophyton soudanense are also present in AMC living in Sweden
and the United States [43,44].

A total of 16 articles report on parasitology—seven report on malaria [52–58], four dis-
cuss helminth infections [35–37,59], and ﬁve focus on unspeciﬁed infections [60–64]. Intesti-
nal parasites are common among AMC in the United States, Spain, and Australia [61–63,65].
Similarly, the infestation rate of head lice among AMC in Israel is high [64]. Among
migrants to Spain, parasitic infections are most common in people originating from sub-
Saharan and North Africa and are frequently associated with eosinophilia [62]. However,
AMC in England have much lower helminth carriage rates than other migrant popula-
tions [59]. In Australia, helminth infections are also common but are not associated with
reduced growth or with H. pylori infection [36], are not predicted by gastrointestinal symp-
toms and signiﬁcantly elevated cytokines [37], and do not elevate urinary hepcidin [36].
The literature also shows imported childhood malaria is increasing among AMC in Eng-
land [58] and Spain [52]. Similarly, Plasmodium falciparum infections are disproportionately
high among AMC compared to populations in receiving countries such as Canada [53], the
Democratic Republic of Congo [54], Australia [55], and Zambia [56]. Prevalence is thought
to be partly connected to malnutrition [54], and receiving countries must be prepared to
treat children for P. falciparum infections on arrival.

3.3.2. Nutrition

A total of 40 articles report on nutrition following arrival to the host country [65–104].
Concerning breastfeeding practices among mothers of AMC, scholars largely centre their
attention on high-income settings such as Norway and Australia, or conversely on refugee
camps in Africa. In developed countries, some authors report positive attitudes towards
breastfeeding [66]; however, others note an interruption of breastfeeding at six months
post-birth primarily due to insufﬁcient milk supply [67], a decline in breastfeeding after
arrival to the host country [68], and increased challenges to exclusive breastfeeding [69]. In
contrast, refugees in Ghana improved their breastfeeding practices with increasing time
in the receiving country [70]. Infant refugees to Algeria often experience excessive iodine
intake [71] and are constantly underweight [72].

Evidence on dietary choices and feeding behaviours of AMC vary across settings. In
Algeria, Italy, and Spain, several authors report lower quality diets in AMC soon after
their arrival [73,74]. For instance, some immigrants to Italy are less likely to have breakfast
compared to Italians [75]. Conversely, AMC in Norway appear to align with Norwegian
dietary recommendations [76], and AMC in the United States make dietary choices that
are highly inﬂuenced by their culture [77]. Factors associated with child hunger and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

7 of 21

food insecurity include poor English proﬁciency and shorter length of stay in the host
country [78,79].

Issues related to obesity and overweight have appeared upon resettlement of AMC in
host countries including the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia [80–83]. Some
authors attribute these health issues to cigarette smoking [84] and changes to traditional
lifestyle [81]. Similarly, vitamin D deﬁciency or insufﬁciency is a frequent concern for
AMC living in Australia and Germany [85–87]. In contrast, AMC with body mass indexes
(BMIs) indicating underweight problems are also reported in the literature, speciﬁcally in
Canada [88], Saudi Arabia [89], Zaire [90], Israel [91], Kenya [92], Scotland [60], the United
States [65], and in migrants to Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Algeria [93]. Some authors
credit weight issues to non-consumption of milk, low literacy of fathers, and having no
immunisation card [94].

To resolve nutrition-related concerns of AMC, host countries such as Australia have
designed, implemented, and evaluated culturally competent obesity-prevention programs
through community-partnered participatory approaches [95]. Likewise, lipid-based nutri-
ent supplement programs have been implemented in Algeria [96], nutrient-dense fortiﬁed
spread programs in the United States [97], and maize meal fortiﬁcation in Zambia [98].
However, despite an increase of interventions, acute malnutrition remained prevalent
in Somalia [99], no signiﬁcant change in haemoglobin with micronutrient powder was
observed in Kenya [100], and malnutrition rates for migrants to Zaire persisted [101].

3.3.3. Mental Health

In total, 25 of the articles focus on the mental health of AMC [105–132]. Post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) is linked to having experienced traumatic events such as war and
violence [105–107]. Girls are more likely to develop this problem [107]. Other mental health
issues among AMC in Israel include suicide ideation and alcohol abuse [108,109], anxiety,
and depression [109,110]. Similarly, in Uganda, exposure to violence is associated with
higher symptoms of depression among AMC [111], and the psychosocial well-being of
AMC is impacted by the potential inﬂux of refugees [112]. However, in Norway, AMC
experience less stressful events compared to migrants from Asia [113], and in Australia,
the social-emotional well-being of AMC improves over time, with children who had four
or more protective factors at low risk of poor social-emotional well-being [114].

Many authors report issues of discrimination, racism, and emotional breakdowns ex-
perienced by AMC in the Netherlands [115], Canada [116], and the United Kingdom [117].
Likewise, behavioural problems are seen to arise with ambivalent acculturation pat-
terns [105,118] and negative perspectives on mental illness in AMC [119]. In Canada
and Israel, some authors identify personal characteristics, interpersonal relationships, envi-
ronmental characteristics, and the family as factors that inﬂuence AMC’s identity and sense
of belonging [120,121]. In Italy, AMC who integrated into the national culture show higher
self-esteem, life satisfaction, and socio-cultural competence relative to their non-integrated
counterparts [122]. Despite the mental health concerns among AMC, contact with mental
health services in destination countries such as the UK appears limited [123].

Three articles discuss child trafﬁcking among AMC [124–126]. Iyakaremye and Muk-
agatare [124] note that child trafﬁcking is facilitated by the poor standard of living in
the refugee camp, convoluted camp layout, and inadequate security system, which neg-
atively impacts girls’ reproductive health, social integration, and mental health. As a
result, researchers in Rwanda found that stigma negatively impacted girls’ access to health
services [125]. Finally, Warria [126] concludes that cultural-responsive care becomes a
highly important practice method for a child welfare practitioner when engaging with
transnational trafﬁcked children from diverse sociocultural, linguistic, economic, and
ethnic backgrounds.

3.3.4. Birth Outcomes and Reproductive and Sexual Health

Overall, 23 of the articles included in this review examine birth outcomes, with less
focus on the reproductive and sexual health of AMC [133–155]. A higher prevalence of
preterm births is seen in Portugal and Belgium [133–135], while infant mortality is preva-
lent in places including Tanzania [136], Canada [137], Italy [138], and South Africa [139].
Similarly, perinatal mortality in African migrant women is high in Sweden [140] and Bel-
gium [135]. Birthweights of AMC vary across studies; for instance, some authors report
low birthweights or high risk for low birthweights in Belgium, Israel, and Spain [141–144],
whereas others note higher birth weights among AMC in these same countries and less
likelihood of being born preterm or with low birth weight [145–147]. In the United States,
researchers found new-borns to Somali immigrants are at increased risk for prolonged hos-
pitalisation, lower 5-min Apgar scores, assisted ventilation, and meconium aspiration [148].
In contrast, other authors report no relationship between preterm birth and low birth
weights [149].

In terms of sexual and reproductive health, in Ethiopia, AMC reported multiple
sources of sexual and reproductive health information including parents, peers, and re-
ligious leaders [150]. Migrants to Portugal reported difﬁculties talking about sex with
parents, the tendency to begin sexual life early, and the infrequent use of condoms [151].
On the other hand, some authors report no evidence linking female circumcision to perina-
tal death in migrants to Sweden [152] and conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of non-therapeutic male
circumcision in migrants to Spain [153]. In addition, the literature shows Somali girls accept
but are less likely to complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series [154], and
AMC in the United States who live in minority diversity neighbourhoods saw protective
effects on infant health [155].

3.3.5. Physical and Developmental Health

A total of 19 articles discuss physical and developmental health [61,95,119,156–171]
and shed light on AMC’s growth and development. For example, AMC in Israel, the
United States, and France are more likely to fail tests assessing ﬁne-motor skill, linguistic,
and socio-emotional domains [156], and to have poor growth [61] and a low BMI [61]. In
addition, AMC in the USA represent the majority of profound biotinidase deﬁciency (BTD)
cases; however, none had partial BTD [157]. Conversely, AMC in Scotland grow to taller
heights than Asian migrants [158].

Ethiopian child migrants to Israel have lower rates of pervasive developmental disor-
der (PDD), compared to immigrants from other countries and native Israeli children [159].
AMC in Sweden and the United States have a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) [160–162]. In other receiving countries, some authors report familial challenges to the
acceptance and understanding of child migrants’ autism, which include cultural attitudes
towards mental illness, behaviour, and disability, in addition to a lack of vocabulary to
describe the disorder [163]. Additionally, AMC in Australia report a negative perspective
on mental illness within the community, with 85% reporting bad perceptions of ASD [119].
AMC in the Netherlands are signiﬁcantly more likely to watch television for two
or more hours per day, compared to native Dutch children [164]. East African migrants
report a desire to be physically active, but migrants to both the United States and Australia
face challenges to physical inactivity, including social, environmental, and cultural barri-
ers [165,166]. On the contrary, Somali child migrants to the United States are more likely to
play soccer than other black peers; the girls have lower activity levels compared to black
and white peers, but no differences are noted for boys [167].

Non-communicable diseases such as neonatal jaundice [168] sickle-cell disease [169],
and Kawasaki disease [170] are common in AMC in Norway, Canada, and the United States.

3.3.6. Oral Health

In total, 17 of the included studies focus on oral health [61,65,172–185], with many
examining the oral health of AMC in Israel. While some report an issue with missing

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

9 of 21

teeth [172,173], others note low levels of caries, especially if the AMC has recently ar-
rived [65,174–177]. Additionally, parents of AMC report less frequent daily toothbrushing
and dentist visits, when compared to their Israeli counterparts [178]. Few or no dental
visits are common among AMC in the United States [184] and Canada [179]. Dental abnor-
malities, poor oral hygiene, and prevalence of caries are also common among AMC [61,181]
Barriers to the prevention of early childhood caries are associated with home-based pre-
vention, early detection, and health care access [182].

3.3.7. Respiratory Health

Nine articles discuss respiratory health [61,186–193]. AMC in Israel, the United States,
and the Netherlands report issues with asthma; however, most show a lower prevalence
and better health-related quality of life, compared to local children [186–188]. Authors
report issues with tuberculosis (TB) among AMC in the United States, Sweden, Israel, and
Australia [61,189–193]. The appearance of this disease has been linked to lower height-for-
age z scores [61]. AMC are typically diagnosed within three years upon arriving in the host
country [190], and asthma in young AMC (0–4 years) is frequently detected [190].

3.3.8. Preventative Health

Nine studies report on preventative health in AMC [30,154,156,194–199]. Paxton et al. [194]
note that 97% of AMC have incomplete or uncertain immunisation status, while other au-
thors suggest serological screening to update the immunisation status of AMC in Italy [195].
In Malawi, evidence shows AMC sometimes lack their second dose of measles vaccine [196].
Similarly, in the United States, girls generally accept initiating the HPV vaccine but less
likely to complete the series [154]. In contrast, AMC in Israel and the United States have
complete vaccination schedules [154], and their antibody levels against many viruses are
similar or higher than non-immigrants [197]. Regarding cardiovascular health, Colom-
batti et al. [198] declare a need for parental education in the native language on stroke risk
and prevention of sickle cell disease (SCD) to increase compliance. Likewise, two studies
point out the need for updated policies, education, and an increase of vaccine uptake or
routine testing for antibodies [30,199].

3.3.9. Endocrine Health

Of the eight articles that report on endocrine health, four focus on type 1 diabetes
(T1D) [200–203] and four on thyroid pathologies [71,204,205]. The literature shows T1D is
often present in AMC in host countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden [200–202],
and that this issue often develops after arrival in host countries [200]. Further, AMC have a
higher risk of T1D with increasing time their mother spent in the receiving nation [201]. In
contrast, AMC in Finland have a similar prevalence of T1D as Finnish children [203].

On the other hand, researchers report excessive iodine intake in infants in Algeria [204]
and children suffering from endemic goitre likely caused by excessive iodine intake [205];
a relationship between excessive iodine intake with thyroid dysfunction and poorer devel-
opmental status is reported [204]. Conversely, Ethiopian immigrants to Israel experience a
high prevalence of goitre with a low frequency of hypothyroidism, which may be attributed
to food goitrogens and iodine deﬁciency prevailing in Ethiopia [206].

3.3.10. Health care Services

Eight of the studies included in this review analyse health care services [119,123,207–212].
AMC in the UK indicate not having contact with health care services [123]; AMC in Israel
adopt Western practices and go to the clinic for medical treatment, but if this does not
prove satisfactory, they seek out solutions according to familiar patterns from their country
of origin for medical, social, or emotional problems [207]. Similarly, AMC caregivers in
South Africa report dissatisfaction with health care services [208], and AMC in Spain report
a sense of pointlessness in seeking out health care services [209]. On the contrary, AMC in
Australia have highly accessible primary care [119,210], and the major barriers to access

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

10 of 21

are the availability of interpreters and lack of information [211]. For migrants to Uganda,
proximity, maternal perceived severity of illness, ﬁnancial resources, and permission from
the father determine treatment access [212].

3.3.11. Haematological Conditions

Five of the included articles focus on haematology concerns [158,169,213–215]. For
instance, Plotinsky et al. (2008) [213] note that blood lead levels (BLLs) of refugees are
signiﬁcantly higher than among non-refugee children. Similarly, Goel et al. (2009) [158]
suggest nutritional iron deﬁciency remains the most common cause of anaemia in African
immigrants. AMC in Canada represent 25% of all patients with SCD born abroad [214]:
some authors suggest that early recognition and intervention may reduce this problem [215].
In addition, bilingual migrant children to Italy with SCD display a rate of cognitive im-
pairment similar to their monolingual counterparts but have a more pronounced and
precocious onset of language difﬁculties [169].

4. Discussion

In providing a comprehensive overview of the empirical evidence on AMC, this
scoping review systematically synthesises the breadth, range, and nature of the evidence
on the health of African migrant children across the globe. It is crucial to scope the literature
on African migrant children to map the research in the ﬁeld and gain more insight into the
gaps in the literature. Due to our large time range (1967–2019), it is important to note that
changes in policies over time may affect migrants. Our ﬁndings indicate that scholars have
largely focused on the nutritional, mental, and infectious diseases of migrant children from
Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia who are living in European countries such as Spain and Italy.
Results from our review indicate most included articles utilise a quantitative approach,
with only a few incorporating a theoretical lens to guide research. More qualitative and
participatory action research studies are needed because these approaches are essential
to amplify the voices of African migrant children further through research processes.
While many of the studies included children as data sources, these were overwhelmingly
quantitative. Only 10 studies were qualitative and gathered data from migrant and refugee
children from countries in sub-Saharan Africa [112,116,120,124,125,129,132,150,166,207].
The rest of the qualitative studies gathered data about children from parents or service
provider participants. In addition, there is a need to focus on children as bearers of rights
under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. For example, children
have the right to have basic needs met and the right to access the necessities of a good life.
Based on these discoveries, we make recommendations for practice, public health policy,
and future research.

Evidence on African immigrants and refugees in a mental health care setting shows
that, by actively involving study participants, researchers are able to ensure meaningful and
culturally appropriate scholarly work [216]. Similarly, Murray et al. [217] found participant
engagement in the research process positively inﬂuenced physical activity behaviour in
East African communities in the United States; these engagements undoubtedly tap into
communal agency, knowledge, and sense of belonging. Worth noting also is that many
articles included in this review lack a theoretical framework. We, similar to others, argue
that theory can permeate the entire research process, thus allowing intellectuals to enhance
the plan, design, and evaluation of their investigations [218–220]. We suggest a theory-
driven approach can add value to future research on AMC, including intervention work.
In 2017, of the 36 million African transnational migrants, 19 million live within the
African continent, and the rest migrated transcontinentally; African migrants younger than
24 years of age made up 38% of the total number of migrants, over six million were migrant
children, and about seven million were internally displaced [221]. Data from 2019 show
African migrants and refugees continue to move within the African continent, with Egypt,
Morocco, Algeria, and Sudan among the top sending countries and Cote d’Ivoire and
South Africa the leading host countries [1]. Even though European countries continue to be

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 3514

11 of 21

the top destinations for African migrants who go pancontinental, other countries, such as
Canada, have recently reported an arrival increase of African nationals [222]. Thus, further
research is needed in countries that host large numbers of AMC, such as South Africa and
Canada. Again, contrary to the long-publicised wave of African migrants moving away
from the continent in the media, further research on African migrants within the continent
itself is also needed because, as observed in this review, a relatively higher proportion of
African migrants continue to be hosted in other African destination countries. In West
Africa, for example, there is considerably more interaction among countries within the sub-
region due to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) free movement
of people and goods protocol. Quite admittedly, however, destination countries outside
the African continent are more unfriendly and unfamiliar for many migrants compared
to those within Africa and, therefore, the health-related outcomes for many AMC outside
the African continent may be graver than for those within the region but outside their
countries of origin. Finally, the current global COVID-19 outbreak will undoubtedly have
impacts on the health of AMC. Future studies are needed to understand these impacts
and implications.

The results from this scoping review underline major issues that could be related
to the health beliefs and cultural practices of migrant families that impact child health.
Many scholars report the poor communication between AMC and their parents about
sex, a lack of importance given to their oral health and dietary choices, and inadequacy
of breastfeeding practices. These ﬁndings are consistent with other research on African
immigrant populations, in which scientists have found traditional beliefs of African im-
migrant women interfere with exclusive breastfeeding during the ﬁrst six months of a
child’s development [223]. Likewise, African immigrants in college culturally perceive
American food as unhealthy, yet they become acculturated to it [224]. In contrast, Cooper
Brathwaite and Lemonde [225] discovered that immigrants from Ghana and Nigeria rely
on their health beliefs and cultural practices in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, and also
preserve their culture through their food choices.

The articles included in this scoping review report on the experiences of AMC and the
health care system. Studies show barriers across a range of destination country contexts
include language barriers and a lack of translation services [226], long wait times and
dissatisfaction with care [11,208], and ﬁnancial costs, especially concerning non-basic
health care [11]. As explained above, migration and settlement journeys can impact health
and access to care in new countries. Lack of status or proper documentation is an acute
barrier to access. For example, even though children under six years of age in South Africa
are entitled to health care regardless of status, they often do not have access to the necessary
paperwork [227].

Our results echo other research with immigrant populations, in which discrimination,
racism, fear, cultural diversities, and the lack of effective communication with health care
providers often lead to dissatisfaction towards health care services [228–230]. These barriers
to African immigrant and refugee children’s access to health care have demonstrable
impacts on child health. Data from the United States show race and immigration status
impact youth health in intersectional ways; speciﬁcally, many Somali immigrants and
refugee children are not meeting Healthy People 2020 Objectives, scoring particularly low in
mental health and healthy weight goals [231]. There is an urgent need for culturally trained
practitioners, especially in areas high in migrants. Cultural competency interventions have
been shown to improve a series of outcomes such as access to health care and patient
outcomes [232]. Hence, we suggest the implementation of these interventions could help
to improve the satisfaction of AMC with the health care systems in host countries by
increasing awareness of cultural norms among health care providers.

Finally, childhood tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis are important topics to consider
in African Immigrant children’s health. However, this scoping review found little data
concerning either diagnosis and treatment or prevention among this population. More
studies are needed to ﬁll this gap.

5. Conclusions

Our ﬁndings suggest a need to investigate other least researched health concerns
of AMC. The World Health Organization [233] reported that, in 2015, pneumonia killed
more than 900,000 African children under 5 years old, and about a quarter of all African
adults had suffered physical violence during their childhood. Similarly, AMC to Europe are
repeatedly exposed to maltreatment during their migration journey [234]. Child maltreat-
ment can include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, neglect, negligence, or exploitation.
In this regard, we suggest the creation of policies aimed at providing health assessments for
AMC to identify individualised health care needs as soon as possible. Health examinations
should emphasise the newly arrived AMC and also involve continuous care. This is impor-
tant because evidence shows recent immigrants present a healthy immigrant effect [235].
As UN Member States aim to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, which is a
critical part of the Sustainable Development Goals, it is imperative to optimise full access
to the range of essential, quality health services, from health promotion to preventive,
curative, and rehabilitative care.

6. Limitations

This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of the empirical evidence on
AMC; however, it has its limitations. Due to the nature of the methodology, details of the
included studies are not discussed in this article, nor is a formal critical appraisal or bias
assessment available. Although we conducted a broad search, some articles might have
been missed if they were published in other languages, used alternative keywords, were
published in African journals not indexed in the databases searched, cultural sensitivity
in service provision, climatic adaptation, and clothing support. Additionally, there is a
limitation in considering only the experiences of sub-Saharan migrants and excluding
those from North Africa. However, we make this distinction due to differences in culture
between countries in North Africa and other regions.
