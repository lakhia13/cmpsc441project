Abstract
Childhood obesity is a major complex and multifaceted public health challenge with significant short- and long-term health conse-
quences. It is also associated with a significant reduction in quality of life and poorer mental health outcomes. In general, obesity 
occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. In children, however, the former can be interpreted as when a child has 
a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age, sex, and ethnicity on growth charts. Obesity 
in children is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, socio-economic, and behavioural factors. The relation-
ship between a child's behaviour and childhood obesity is multifaceted and influenced by various factors, including dietary habits, 
physical activity levels, sedentary behaviours, family dynamics, socio-economic status, and environmental factors. Effective strategies 
for preventing and managing childhood obesity require a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach that addresses individual, family, 
community, and educational institutes. Thus, addressing childhood obesity requires a comprehensive approach that addresses not 
only biological and environmental factors but also behavioural factors that influence children's eating behaviours, physical activity 
levels, sleep patterns, and emotional well-being. Early intervention and ongoing support are crucial for promoting healthy growth and 
development and reducing the burden of childhood obesity on individuals, families, and societies. This review discusses factors that 
influence the child’s behaviour and the relationship between the child’s behaviour and childhood obesity.
Key words: childhood obesity, behaviour, inactivity, health consequences.

Introduction 

Childhood  obesity  is  defined  medically  as  body  mass  in-
dex (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile for age and sex, while 
childhood overweight is BMI between the 85th and 95th percen-
tile for age and sex [1]. It is associated with an increase in body 
weight, more specifically fat tissue mass [2]. It occurs when en-
ergy intake is more than energy expenditure and is associated 
with increased fat cells size and number [2]. The sharp increase 
in  the  prevalence  of  overweight  and  obesity  among  children 
reflects a critical shift toward positive energy balance. Conse-
quently, this upsurge is posing a major health threat worldwide. 
Risk factors for childhood obesity include modifiable and non-
modifiable factors [2]. Non-modifiable factors such as genetics, 
hormonal disturbances, certain diseases, and medications [2]. 
Modifiable  factors  such  as  environmental  and  socioeconomic 
factors.  There  are  many  risk  factors  contributing  to  obesity  in 
children,  and  the  most  important  modifiable  factors  are  poor 
diet, adverse dietary habits, and lack of physical activity [3, 4]. 
Children  who  are  overweight  at  age  5  are  4  times  more 
likely than their normal-weight peers to become obese later in 
childhood [5]. Obesity predisposes children to obesity-related 

health  consequences  such  as  type  2  diabetes,  hypertension, 
metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 
and polycystic ovary syndrome [2]. It also leads to depression, 
low self-esteem, social discomfort, and ultimately social isola-
tion [6], and as a result, the quality of life among obese children 
decreases significantly (Fig. 1). Obesity during adulthood can 
be  partially  explained  by  a  decrease  in  metabolic  rate.  Thus, 
when  people  maintain  a  sedentary  way  of  living,  their  energy 
output will decrease over time, and this causes weight gain [7]. 
A dramatic change in a child’s behaviour and environment to-
wards sedentary lifestyle in modern societies may explain the 
sharp  increase  in  the  prevalence  of  childhood  obesity  world-
wide [3]. Feeding behaviours are manipulated by mothers at an 
early stage of the child’s life [8, 9]. 

Risk factors for childhood obesity can help identify individu-
als at risk [2]. However, these factors are insufficient to explain 
the sharp increase in childhood obesity in Europe and devel-
oped countries, which occurred 3 to 5 decades ago [10]. This 
is because the westernised lifestyle and daily increase in high-
caloric,  high-fat  diets  started  around  the  1950s.  Furthermore, 
the  sharp  increase  in  overweight  and  obesity  also  cannot  be 
blamed on the availability of fast food either because it has al-

ready been presented during the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, even 
when  all  known  causes  of  obesity  have  been  taken  into  con-
sideration,  they  do  not  provide  a  satisfactory  explanation  for 
such an increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity 
among children worldwide. Although previous studies attempt-
ed to link children’s diets with the growing prevalence of obe-
sity, none have been able to show a fundamental link between 
diet and child obesity [11, 12]. Underreporting of daily caloric 
intake and overreporting physical activity, which is something 
that normally occurs in childhood obesity studies, may deviate 
the results [13]. Another important factor that may explain the 
sharp increase in childhood obesity is a significant alteration in 
children’s behaviour [13]. 

One of the major challenges in the life of today’s children is 
linked to their parents [14]. Parents no longer spend as much 
time (as they used to do) with their children. The availability of 
one or both parents around the child has a positive impact on 
a child’s behaviour because it makes it easy for them to advise 
the child on what is good or bad [15, 16]. For example, when 
both parents work full time, there is rarely enough time to give 
the child the right direction. Parents try to compensate for the 
lack of attention by offering more food, more games, or more 
money, which will ultimately worsen the issue instead of solving 
it.  Understanding  how  children’s  behaviours  affect  childhood 
obesity  can  provide  an  opportunity  to  focus  resources,  inter-
ventions, and research in the direction that would be most ben-
eficial  in  addressing  the  problem.  This  review  discusses  fac-

tors that influence child behaviour and the relationship between 
child behaviour and childhood obesity.

Size of the problem

Childhood obesity has witnessed a sharp increase in devel-
oped  and  many  developing  countries  [2].  Globally,  the  mean 
standardised  BMI  has  been  increased  by  0.32  kg/m2  per  de-
cade [1]. Multiple factors contribute to this increase, including 
genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors [2–4]. Nev-
ertheless,  well-known  risk  factors  are  not  the  only  culprits  for 
the  growing  prevalence  of  childhood  obesity,  but  rather  what 
controls child behaviour to be under the exposure to such risk 
factors.  Thus,  addressing  childhood  obesity  requires  a  com-
prehensive  approach  that  addresses  not  only  biological  and 
environmental factors but also behavioural factors influencing 
children’s eating habits, physical activity levels, sleep patterns, 
and  emotional  well-being.  As  a  result,  effective  strategies  for 
preventing  and  managing  childhood  obesity  require  a  com-
prehensive, multi-sectoral approach that addresses individual, 
family, community, and educational institutes.

Children’s behaviour plays a significant role in the epidemic 
of obesity [14–16]. Compared to children with normal weight, 
obese children are at risk for developing certain health condi-
tions such as poor lipid profile, NAFLD, asthma, sleep apnoea, 
bone, and joint problems (Fig. 1). Other chronic health conse-
quences that an individual may face during young adulthood

include  type  2  diabetes,  atherosclerosis,  and  cardiovascular 
diseases, which can develop with a longer period of exposure 
to obesity. More importantly, obesity seems to ‘track’ from ado-
lescence to adulthood [17]; thus, early intervention to manage 
and prevent overweight and obesity at younger ages is a high 
priority from a public health point of view. Obesity in general, 
and abdominal obesity specifically, is strongly associated with 
insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a key factor in the de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes and is also associated with other 
metabolic  abnormalities,  including  dyslipidaemia,  hyperten-
sion, and polycystic ovary syndrome [18]. 

What controls child behaviour?

A child’s behaviour is a way of communicating their genu-
ine needs, desires, and feelings. Generally, there are many fac-
tors  contributing  to  that  behaviour,  including  age,  personality, 
and the environment [19, 20]. During childhood, behaviour can 
be  considered  normal  or  problematic  depending  on  whether 
it matches the outline expectations of the family, society, and 
religion and/or certain beliefs. Nevertheless, providing healthy 
lifestyle  environments  for  children  and  adolescents  is  crucial 
[20–22]. The significant increase in the prevalence of childhood 
obesity in the last 3 decades could be due to alterations in child 
behaviour  [23].  Child  behaviour  can  be  influenced  mainly  by 
3  essential  factors,  and  these  are  homes  where  parents  play 
a major role, school, and neighbourhood (Fig. 2). 

The role of parents

A child’s behaviour, development, and growth are embed-
ded within a multifaceted system of relationships. Among the 
most  important  relationships  that  influence  children’s  behav-
iour is the one that exists between the parents and child [24]. 
Parents are children’s first guide to help them build healthy be-
haviours. A child’s behaviour at home can be promoted by one 
or both parents. The impact of parents on a child’s behaviour is 
highly important because it may promote or prevent childhood 
obesity [22, 23, 25]. Thus, acknowledgement of the crucial im-
portance of early parent-child relationship quality for children’s 
socioemotional, intellectual, neurobiological, and better health 
outcomes  has  contributed  to  a  shift  in  efforts  to  identify  rela-
tional determinants of child outcomes [24]. 

Before the birth of an infant, there are important roles that 
mothers can take part in to prevent the unborn child becoming 
obese later on [26]. Obese parents tend to have obese children 
[26, 27]. A child has a 3.68-fold increase in the risk of obesity if 
his/her mother has BMI >30 kg/m2 [27]. Previous [28, 29] and 
most recent available studies [30] have shown that the moth-
er’s weight gain during pregnancy is associated with increased 
birth weight. Furthermore, overweight and obese mothers who 
have  gained  weight  before  and  throughout  pregnancy  are  at 
high  risk  of  metabolic  syndrome,  type  2  diabetes  mellitus, 
and gestational diabetes [29, 31, 32]. Compared with normal-
weight women, pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestation-

NEIGHBOURHOOD

Children spending a significant amount  
of time with neighbouring friends, thus increasing 
awareness among communities where children 
meet each other can also promote healthier lifestyle.

strategies for healthier lifestyle.

CHILD’S BEHAVIOR

HOME

SCHOOL

Educational systems, or school or institutes where 
children learn can play a pivotal role in promoting 
a better lifestyle approach for the children  
and increase awareness regarding health risks 
associated with obesity and factors associated  
with decreased risk.

Everything starts from home where child behaviour can  
be built and refined based on healthier attitudes, behaviours, 
and practices. Parents in the first place may help in promoting 
healthier lifestyle approaches and enviornments for their 
children by encouraging physical activity, healthier food and 
the consumption of the three meals, limiting TV viewing 
and discouraging junk food and eating while watching TV or 
other screen devices. Governments and TV producers must 
agree to introduce and broadcast specific programmes that 
promote a healthier lifestyle and fight childhood obesity. 
Siblings can be involved in discouraging sedentary  
activites and motivating a better lifestyle  
approach for each other.

al weight gain are associated with greater maternal and infant 
complications [29, 31, 32]. Weight gain and overeating during 
pregnancy places mothers and their children at an increased 
risk for obesity [27, 29–33]. Mothers also play important roles 
after  a  child’s  birth.  Indeed,  what  children  eat  is  directly  de-
pendent on the knowledge, perceptions, and practices of their 
parents  and  other  caregivers  [34].  The  method  that  mothers 
choose  to  feed  the  child  is  important.  Previous  studies  show 
that breastfeeding is associated with a protective trend against 
child  obesity  [35–38].  In  contrast,  using  infant  formula  is  as-
sociated with increased risk of overweight and obesity [39–42]. 
Mothers in westernised countries are less likely to breastfeed 
their children than they were 5 decades ago [43]. 

Parents  are  responsible  for  helping  their  children  develop 
healthy  habits,  such  as  healthy  sleep,  the  consumption  of 
healthy food, and eating breakfast and other main daily meals 
on time. Poor sleep is associated with higher BMI among chil-
dren compared with children with normal sleep duration (8 to 
9  hours  per  day)  [44–46].  Others  reported  that  sleep  timing 
behaviour is also associated with higher BMI [47–49]. A previ-

ous study [48] found that late bedtimes and late wake-up times 
are associated with poorer diet quality (dense caloric and poor 
nutrition value diet). Furthermore, bedtime was found to be as-
sociated  with  breakfast  partaking.  Thus,  bedtime  was  signifi-
cantly earlier in children consuming breakfast every day (08:30 
vs. 09:00 PM, p < 0.01); and was later (09:15 vs. 09:30 PM) 
in children who went to bed late and snacked rather than eat 
breakfast [49]. 

Other  important  factors  that  have  a  crucial  impact  on 
child behaviour and weight gain include parental relationship, 
their  education  level,  their  maternal  status,  and  whether  they 
are  employed  [50–52],  as  shown  in  Table  I.  A  previous  study 
[50]  showed  that,  compared  with  children  and  adolescents 
whose  mothers  stay  at  home,  those  with  employed  mothers 
have a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being obese (OR = 2.60 
[95% Cl: 1.18–5.70]). Parental education level may also affect 
child weight in 2 different directions. In developed and industri-
al countries, the parental educational level is mostly associated 
with decreased risk of overweight and obesity [53]. In contrast, 
in  developing  and  less  developed  countries,  parental  educa-

tional  level  is  considered  as  a  risk  factor  for  overweight  and 
obesity in children [51]. This could be because higher educa-
tion is associated with increased purchasing power, which cor-
relates with more food on the table. In low- and middle-income 
countries, childhood obesity is predominantly a problem of the 
rich [52]. 

Childhood obesity can also be triggered by parental obe-
sity [2]. Previous studies found that the odds of being an obese 
child  is  2  to  3  times  greater  when  both  parents  are  obese 
[50, 54]. Besides the high probability of obesity-related genet-
ics,  obese  parents  encourage  sedentary  lifestyles,  and  such 
an environment promotes weight gain among family members 
and increases the risk of childhood obesity. A child has a 50% 
risk of being obese if one of his/her parents is obese, and the 
risk  jumps  to  80%  when  both  parents  are  obese.  A  previous 
study  [55]  reported  that  the  probability  of  a  pre-school  child 
being overweight is increased more than 2-fold when parents 
are overweight (OR = 2.43 [95% CI: 0.78–6.59]). Genetics can 
explain  some  of  the  observed  intergenerational  association, 
because parents and their offspring share at least 50% of their 
genetic perception [55]. 

This influence is weak when the relationship between par-
ents  is  strained,  e.g.  in  the  case  of  divorce  or  when  parents 
are forced to work late or during weekends. Observations from 
a previous study [56] indicate that, compared with children of 
married  parents,  those  with  divorced  parents  are  54%  more 
likely to be overweight and/or obese [56]. Overweight and obe-
sity are 54% more prevalent among school children of divorced 
parents compared with children of married parents (RR = 1.54 
[95%  CI:  1.21–1.95]),  while  abdominal  obesity  increased  by 
89% (RR = 1.89 [95% CI 1.35–2.65]) in the same group of chil-
dren [56]. In other words, the failure of the parents’ relationship 
may have a negative impact on child psychology and promote 
food  intake.  Even  though  parents  usually  make  time  to  take 
their children to the nearest shopping mall, or to a dentist clinic, 
they rarely teach their children healthy eating habits or how to 
maintain a healthy weight [57]. 

Towards a better child environment

At home, the environment surrounding the child is under the 
responsibility and the control of parents [51]. A simple, healthy 
environment can be created by exposing children to preventive 
factors and reducing their exposure to risk factors. For exam-
ple,  excessive  weight  gain  during  pregnancy  is  a  well-known 
risk  factor  for  obesity  during  childhood  [2].  Excessive  gesta-
tional weight gain is a risk factor for higher weight gain at birth 
[27–33, 63, 64]. This means that controlling weight gain during 
pregnancy within the recommended range for pregnant wom-
en can help in preventing and managing obesity during early 
childhood.  Excessive  weight  gain  during  pregnancy  can  also 
cause serious health consequences to the mother throughout 
the pregnancy [26, 65, 66] and afterwards [67–69]. It has been 
estimated that a quarter of pregnancy complications are due to 
overweight and obesity. Thus, to avoid these complications, it 
is vital to have strict follow-up and adherence to the institute of 

medicine instructions regarding weight gain during pregnancy 
[66, 69]. Indeed, weight gain within recommended ranges im-
proves both neonatal and maternal health outcomes.

Parents  can  promote  healthy  lifestyle  behaviours  such  as 
physical activity, a healthy diet, and a healthy way of eating (Ta-
ble II). This is of great importance because healthy behaviours 
that  children  develop  early  in  their  life  may  persist  into  adult-
hood  [50].  If  children  do  not  learn  healthy  eating  habits  early 
on, they  will soon become overweight, with a greater chance 
of becoming obese children [51, 55]. Parents must encourage 
their children to develop good, healthy habits such as regular 
physical exercise. 

Limiting TV viewing and internet usage, avoiding processed 
snacks,  limiting  sugary  beverages,  sweets,  and  junk  food. 
Viewing TV for a long period is strongly associated with weight 
gain  and  child  overweight/obesity  independently  of  diet  and 
exercise [55], while having a TV in the child’s bedroom makes 
it  even  worse  [77].  A  previous  study  [55]  reported  a  56%  in-
crease in child overweight when watching television > 2 hours/
day (OR = 1.56 [95% CI: 1.17–2.09]). Watching television for 
long periods at a time not only restricts energy expenditure, but 
it also encourages snacking, and children may not stop eating 
even when they are full because of the distraction. Therefore, 
TV viewing should be limited as much as possible without al-
lowing children to eat or drink while watching television or play-
ing games [57]. 

The role of educational institutes

Schools and educational institutes play a significant impact 
on the development and shaping of child behaviour [78]. They 
serve  as  environments  where  children  spend  a  considerable 
amount  of  time  and  interact  with  peers,  teachers,  and  other 
adults.  The  impact  of  school  on  child  behaviour  can  be  pro-
found and multifaceted, influencing various aspects of their so-
cial,  emotional,  cognitive,  and  behavioural  development  [79]. 
The  environment  that  schools  of  today  provide  depends  on 
whether  the  school  is  private,  governmental,  or  mixed.  While 
some  schools  provide  food,  processed  snacks,  and  sugary 
beverages, others provide more sports activities on a daily ba-
sis. Parents are usually in charge of selecting the right school 
for their children. Through parental support, educational insti-
tutes may promote healthy dietary habits and physical activity, 
and prevent obesity in children [80, 81]. Furthermore, the opin-
ion of children towards school these days is very different from 
their parents’ opinion in their school days. 

School  for  a  child  is  a  good  environment  not  just  only  to 
learn or to study, but also to exchange PlayStation CDs, mov-
ies, and games with other children. Negatively, even sharing or 
buying drugs, e.g. alcohol, cigarette smoking, marijuana, hash-
ish (cannabis), crack, and other drugs (i.e. cocaine) are report-
ed  daily  in  high  schools  in  developed  and  developing  coun-
tries [82]. Previous [83] and recent available studies [84] have 
reported that high school students who use illicit drugs show 
deficits in family relationships. This shows how the behaviour of 
a child can be affected by other children’s behaviours. Further-

more, this also shows the size of the problem when the home 
effect is absent [84]. To decrease the prevalence of childhood 
obesity, parents and schools must come together with a pre-
ventive approach towards a better and, of course, a healthier 
environment for the benefit of their children [85].

The role of the neighbourhood environment 

There has been an increase in attention regarding the role 
of neighbourhoods and residential environments in explaining 
differences  in  health  outcomes  [86].  Indeed,  the  neighbour-
hood environment can have a significant impact on child be-
haviour  and  development  due  to  its  influence  on  various  as-
pects  of  a  child’s  life,  including  overweight  and  obesity  [60]. 
The neighbourhood where a child grows up plays a crucial role 
in  shaping  child  behaviours  and  overall  development  [86].  It 
moulds their experiences, opportunities, and interactions with 
the  physical,  social,  and  economic  environment.  Neighbour-
hoods  with  higher  levels  of  safety  and  lower  crime  rates  cre-
ate  a  more  conducive  environment  for  children  to  engage  in 
outdoor play, physical activity, and social interactions, and the 
opposite is also true [60]. Children in safer neighbourhoods are 

more likely to exhibit positive behaviours such as outdoor play, 
walking or biking to school, and socialising with peers. Those 
living  in  disadvantaged  neighbourhoods  (unsafe  neighbour-
hoods) may experience heightened stress, fear, and avoidance 
behaviour. Children in neighbourhoods with limited access to 
recreational  facilities  may  have  fewer  opportunities  for  physi-
cal  activity  and  outdoor  play,  leading  to  sedentary  behaviour 
patterns and increased risk of obesity and related health con-
sequences [87]. Neighbourhoods with access to parks, play-
grounds, recreational facilities, and green spaces provide op-
portunities for physical activity, sports, and outdoor play, which 
promote  healthy  behaviours  and  social  interactions  among 
children [55, 88]. 

Overall,  the  neighbourhood  environment  plays  a  critical 
role  in  shaping  child  behaviours  by  providing  opportunities 
for physical activity, social interactions, access to educational 
resources,  healthy  food  options,  and  supportive  community 
networks.  Creating  supportive  neighbourhood  environments 
that  promote  safety,  access  to  recreational  facilities,  educa-
tional  opportunities,  social  cohesion,  and  healthy  lifestyles  is 
essential  for  promoting  positive  child  behaviours  and  overall 
well-being.

What is needed?

Creating a healthy environment around children is essential 
towards decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity 
(Fig.  3).  In  addition,  promoting  healthy  behaviours,  fostering 
supportive  home  and  school  environments,  and  addressing 
social determinants of health are essential for preventing and 
managing  childhood  obesity  effectively  [81].  The  family  en-
vironment,  including  parental  caregiving  practices,  parental 
involvement,  family  dynamics,  and  household  routines,  sig-
nificantly influences child behaviour [89, 90]. Warm, supportive 
care  and  greater  communication  between  parents  and  their 
children, and a nurturing family environment promote positive 
child  outcomes,  including  healthy  attachment,  social  skills, 
emotional  regulation,  and  academic  achievement  [90].  Edu-
cational  institutes  and/or  schooling  have  a  significant  impact 
on child psychology, influencing various aspects of cognitive, 
social, emotional, and behavioural development. The charac-
teristics  of  the  community  and  neighbourhood  environment, 
including access to resources, safety, social support networks, 
and neighbourhood cohesion, influence child behaviour. Posi-
tive community environments with access to parks, recreational 
facilities,  and  community  programs  promote  physical  activity, 
social engagement, and healthy development. Some children 
may have underlying behavioural disorders that affect their ac-
tions. Identifying and addressing these disorders is crucial for 

managing  child  behaviour.  It  is  suggested  that  for  better  out-
comes,  local  governments  and  educational  institutes’  practi-
tioners must focus on improving collaboration between school 
and  home  to  optimise  children’s  subjective  well-being  by  re-
ducing their homework anxiety and increasing the harmonious 
family atmosphere. Thus, more family communication and sup-
port, more social interaction, and less parental-child interaction 
and family conflict [91].

Finally, to decrease childhood obesity, further approaches 
must  be  implanted.  Parents  must  be  considered  as  corner-
stones  in  the  application  of  any  of  these  approaches.  Figure 
3  displays  selected  factors  towards  the  creation  of  a  healthy 
environment around children. Such interventions may promote 
healthy food choices, improve the psychosocial well-being of 
children, and support families to create a healthy environment 
for children.

Conclusions

The prevalence of childhood obesity continues to increase 
globally, posing significant challenges for public health systems 
and underscoring the importance of comprehensive strategies 
to address this epidemic. Child behaviour plays a crucial role in 
the crisis of childhood obesity because it directly influences life-
style habits, dietary choices, physical activity levels, and overall 
health outcomes. The combined influence of parents, schools,

Figure 3. Instructions for parents and caregivers towards the creation of a healthy environment for children. All parents must 
encourage a protective healthy environment at home to decrease the risk of overweight and obesity among their children. Under 
these circumstances, children will develop healthier habits, and the chances of decreasing childhood obesity will be increased. 
Eating a healthy diet, along with getting enough physical activity and restful sleep, can help children grow up healthy and pre-
vent overweight and obesity

and the local community creates an environment that shapes 
a child’s behaviour, social skills, and overall development. Col-
laboration and coordination among these elements are essen-
tial for promoting positive behaviour and well-being in children. 

Finally, promoting healthy behaviours and creating supportive 
environments  that  encourage  healthy  eating  and  active  living 
are essential strategies for addressing childhood obesity and 
promoting the health and well-being of children.
