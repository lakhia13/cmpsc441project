Background

A B S T R A C T

Real-time  video  communication  software  such  as  Skype  and  FaceTime  transmits  live  video  and  audio  over  the  Internet,  allowing
counsellors to provide support to help people quit smoking. There are more than four billion Internet users worldwide, and Internet users
can download free video communication software, rendering a video counselling approach both feasible and scalable for helping people
to quit smoking.

Objectives

To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling  delivered  individually  or  to  a  group  in  increasing  smoking  cessation,  quit
attempts, intervention adherence, satisfaction and therapeutic alliance, and to provide an economic evaluation regarding real-time video
counselling.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase to identify
eligible  studies  on  13  August  2019.  We  searched  the  World  Health  Organization  International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  and
ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing trials registered by 13 August 2019. We checked the reference lists of included articles and contacted
smoking cessation researchers for any additional studies.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised trials, cluster RCTs or cluster randomised trials of real-time video counselling
for current tobacco smokers from any setting that measured smoking cessation at least six months following baseline. The real-time video
counselling intervention could be compared with a no intervention control group or another smoking cessation intervention, or both.

Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from included trials, assessed the risk of bias and rated the certainty of the evidence using the
GRADE approach. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis for the primary outcome of smoking cessation, using the most stringent
measure of smoking cessation measured at the longest follow-up. Analysis was based on the intention-to-treat principle. We considered
participants with missing data at follow-up for the primary outcome of smoking cessation to be smokers.

Main results

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

We  included  two  randomised  trials  with  615  participants.  Both  studies  delivered  real-time  video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation
individually, compared with telephone counselling. We judged one study at unclear risk of bias and one study at high risk of bias. There
was no statistically significant treatment effect for smoking cessation (using the strictest definition and longest follow-up) across the two
included studies when real-time video counselling was compared to telephone counselling (risk ratio (RR) 2.15, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.38 to 12.04; 2 studies, 608 participants; I2 = 66%). We judged the overall certainty of the evidence for smoking cessation as very
low due to methodological limitations, imprecision in the effect estimate reflected by the wide 95% CIs and inconsistency of cessation
rates. There were no significant differences between real-time video counselling and telephone counselling reported for number of quit
attempts among people who continued to smoke (mean difference (MD) 0.50, 95% CI –0.60 to 1.60; 1 study, 499 participants), mean number
of counselling sessions completed (MD –0.20, 95% CI –0.45 to 0.05; 1 study, 566 participants), completion of all sessions (RR 1.13, 95% CI
0.71 to 1.79; 1 study, 43 participants) or therapeutic alliance (MD 1.13, 95% CI –0.24 to 2.50; 1 study, 398 participants). Participants in the
video counselling arm were more likely than their telephone counselling counterparts to recommend the programme to a friend or family
member (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 1 study, 398 participants); however, there were no between-group differences on satisfaction score
(MD 0.70, 95% CI –1.16 to 2.56; 1 study, 29 participants).

Authors' conclusions

There is very little evidence about the effectiveness of real-time video counselling for smoking cessation. The existing research does not
suggest a difference between video counselling and telephone counselling for assisting people to quit smoking. However, given the very
low GRADE rating due to methodological limitations in the design, imprecision of the effect estimate and inconsistency of cessation rates,
the smoking cessation results should be interpreted cautiously. High-quality randomised trials comparing real-time video counselling to
telephone counselling are needed to increase the confidence of the effect estimate. Furthermore, there is currently no evidence comparing
real-time  video  counselling  to  a  control  group.  Such  research  is  needed  to  determine  whether  video  counselling  increases  smoking
cessation.

How does real-time video counselling compare to telephone counselling for helping people quit smoking?

Background

Video communication software like Skype and FaceTime allows counsellors to see and hear people over the Internet to help them quit
smoking. Video counselling could help large numbers of people to quit smoking because more than four billion people use the Internet,
and video communication software is free.

Study characteristics

We searched for studies on 13 August 2019, and found two that met our inclusion criteria. Our main focus was to learn if video counselling
delivered individually or to a group could help people quit smoking and to learn how it compared with other types of support to help
people quit. We also studied the effect of real-time video counselling on the number of times people tried to quit, the number of sessions
they  completed,  their  satisfaction  with  the  counselling,  their  relationship  or  bond  with  the  counsellor  and  the  costs  of  using  video
communication to help people quit smoking. Both studies took place in the USA, and included people from rural areas or women with HIV.
Both studies gave one-to-one video sessions to individuals. There were eight video sessions in one study and four video sessions in the
other study. Both studies compared video counselling to telephone counselling and looked at whether people quit smoking, the number
of sessions they completed and their satisfaction with the programme. One study examined the number of times people tried to quit and
one study looked at the relationship or bond with the counsellor.

Key findings

It is unclear how video counselling compares with telephone counselling in terms of helping people to quit smoking. People who used
video counselling were more likely than those who used telephone counselling to recommend the programme to a friend or someone in
their family, but we found no differences in how satisfied they were, the number of video or telephone sessions completed, whether all
sessions were completed and in the relationship or bond with the counsellor.

Quality of evidence

We rated the quality of the evidence for smoking cessation to be very low. There were only two studies, and the limitations in these studies
made it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about whether video counselling can help people to quit smoking. This should be taken into
account when looking at these findings.

Description of the condition

Tobacco use is a leading preventable cause of premature death and
disease  worldwide  (WHO  2019).  Globally,  there  are  an  estimated
1.1 billion current tobacco smokers and tobacco use is responsible
for  the  death  of  approximately  eight  million  people  each  year
(WHO  2019).  Subgroups  that  are  at  high  risk  of  tobacco  use
include: lower socioeconomic groups (Jamal 2018; Santero 2019);
adults  with  mental  illness  (Jamal  2018;  Lê  Cook  2014);  people
who  reside  in  remote  or  very  remote  areas  (AIHW  2018;  Doogan
2017);  indigenous  populations  (AIHW  2018;  Jetty  2017);  lesbian,
gay,  bisexual,  transgender  and  queer  populations  (Jamal  2018;
Wheldon  2018);  and  ethnic  minority  groups  (Jamal  2018;  Odani
2018).  Current  tobacco  smokers  are  estimated  to  die  a  mean
of  10  years  earlier  than  non-smokers  (Banks  2015;  Jha  2013).
Tobacco  use  harms  nearly  every  organ  of  the  body,  causes
numerous  diseases  including  coronary  heart  disease,  chronic
obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  stroke,  cancers  and  respiratory
diseases, and causes adverse reproductive outcomes (HSS 2014).
Quitting smoking reduces the risk of tobacco-related mortality and
morbidity  even  among  long-term  smokers  (Jha  2013).  Smoking
cessation  before  40  years  of  age  reduces  the  risk  of  death
associated  with  continued  smoking  by  approximately  90%  (Jha
2013). Effective behavioural interventions and pharmacotherapies
for  smoking  cessation  include  print-based  self-help  materials
(Livingstone-Banks  2019),  Internet-based  programmes  (Taylor
2017),  proactive  telephone  counselling  (Matkin  2019),  healthcare
professional advice (Stead 2013), individual counselling (Lancaster
2017),  group  therapy  (Stead  2017),  nicotine  replacement  therapy
(Hartmann-Boyce 2018), bupropion (Hughes 2014), and varenicline
(Cahill 2016).

The global economic cost of smoking in 2012 was estimated to be
USD 1.4 trillion, comprised of USD 422 billion in direct healthcare
costs,  USD  357  billion  for  morbidity  and  USD  657  billion  for
mortality (NCI and WHO 2016). In the US, the cost of tobacco use
between 2001 and 2004 totalled USD 193 billion per year, consisting
of  USD  96  billion  in  direct  healthcare  costs  and  USD  97  billion
for  productivity  losses  (CDC  2008).  There  are  limited  data  about
the  economic  costs  of  tobacco  use  in  low-  and  middle-income
countries,  but  available  evidence  suggests  that  as  a  percentage
of the total healthcare costs, tobacco-related healthcare costs for
low- and middle-income countries are comparable to those of high-
income countries (NCI and WHO 2016).

Description of the intervention

Real-time  video  counselling  uses  video  conferencing  technology
(also  referred  to  as  'telemedicine'  or  'telehealth'),  consisting  of
a  video  camera  connected  to  a  computer  or  mobile  device,  to
securely  transmit  live  video  and  audio  of  the  counsellor  and
client  to  one  another  over  the  Internet.  There  are  more  than
four  billion  Internet  users  worldwide  (Internet  Society  2019),
suggesting  that  real-time  video  counselling  has  the  potential
for  widespread  implementation.  Freely  available  software  such
as  Skype,  FaceTime,  Facebook  Messenger  or  Google+Hangouts
allows real-time, interactive video communication between users
via  personal  computers  or  mobile  devices,  or  both.  Real-time
video  counselling  differs  from  telephone  counselling  because
telephone services including quitlines transmit only the sound of
the counsellor's and client's voices to each other (Matkin 2019). The

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Cochrane systematic review of telephone counselling for smoking
cessation  included  interventions  that  were  delivered  via  audio
only over the telephone (Matkin 2019). In contrast, real-time video
counselling  includes  a  visual  mode  of  communication  because  it
transmits both live video and audio of the interaction between the
counsellor and client over the Internet.

How the intervention might work

Healthcare  providers  have  used  video  conferencing  technology
to  deliver  smoking  cessation  care  (Richter  2015),  as  well  as
consultations  for  medical  conditions 
including  preoperative
anaesthesia  (Roberts  2015),  ophthalmology  (Johnson  2015),
mental  health  (Saurman  2014),  and  remote  supervision  of
chemotherapy  administration  to  people  with  cancer  (Sabesan
2012).  Real-time  video  consultations  are  potentially  valuable
because  despite  the  success  of  behavioural  interventions,  such
as  individual  counselling  (Lancaster  2017),  group  therapy  (Stead
2017),  and  proactive  telephone  counselling  (Matkin  2019),  in
increasing smokers' chances of quitting successfully, the use of in-
person  cessation  services  (Matcham  2014)  and  quitlines  (Wilson
2010)  is  low.  Real-time  video  interventions  allow  health  care  to
be  delivered  to  people  who  may  otherwise  have  limited  access
to  health  care  and  specialist  services,  and  thus  may  increase
the uptake of behavioural support. For example, people who live
in  rural  areas  may  not  receive  treatment  or  may  delay  seeking
treatment  because  of  fewer  healthcare  services  near  their  home,
and people with mobility problems may find it difficult to attend
in-person consultations, resulting in poorer health outcomes. The
evaluation  of  a  telehealth-delivered  smoking  cessation  support
group  found  that  86%  of  rural  participants  were  only  able  to
take  part  in  the  programme  because  it  was  offered  via  video-
conferencing.  The  participants  reported  that  travel  time  and
associated  costs  to  attend  a  face-to-face  group  would  have  been
prohibitive (Carlson 2012). The limited access to effective smoking
cessation support and healthcare services in rural areas may have
an associated negative impact on health.

In  addition,  low-  and  middle-income  countries  have  experienced
an  increase  in  the  use  of  Internet  technologies,  with  technology-
enabled health programmes emerging in lower-income countries
(Lewis  2012).  The  reasons  for  using  technology  to  deliver  health
care in low- and middle-income countries include improving access
to, and the quality of, care, in diverse geographical locations where
there  may  be  a  shortage  of  healthcare  professionals,  facilitating
communications  outside  regular  health  visits,  and  improving
diagnosis and treatment (Lewis 2012). These could all lead to better
health outcomes for people.

As  well  as  being  used  as  an  additional  treatment  option,  real-
time  video  counselling  could  also  be  implemented  in  existing
community  and  healthcare  settings,  to  expand  their  reach  or
reduce  the  burden  on  overstretched  services.  For  instance,  real-
time video counselling could be delivered through existing quitline
services  or  other  smoking  cessation  services  in  settings  such  as
general  practice,  hospitals  or  other  treatment  centres,  to  clients
in their own homes. Smoking cessation counsellors or healthcare
professionals (or both) could provide behavioural support via video
sessions to assist smokers to quit as either a primary intervention
or as an adjunct to other smoking cessation treatments.

Similar  to  face-to-face  smoking  cessation  interventions,  the  live
video  images  transmitted  during  real-time  video  counselling

sessions  allow  counsellors  to  deliver  behavioural  support  via
a  visual  mode  and  be  responsive  to  the  smoker's  verbal  and
non-verbal  cues.  During  real-time  video  counselling  sessions,
counsellors can use evidence-based techniques, such as cognitive
(Clark  1997),  and  motivational
behavioural  therapy 
interviewing  (Miller  1991)  to  support  smokers  to  quit.  As  there
is  evidence  that  behavioural  interventions  are  generally  effective
across a range of media (Lancaster 2017; Stead 2017; Matkin 2019),
it is reasonable to assume that this may translate to the medium of
real-time video counselling.

(CBT) 

However, the limitations of real-time video counselling also need
to be considered. Potential disadvantages of this approach include
that the smoker or healthcare professional (or both) or counsellor
may not feel adequately skilled to operate the video-conferencing
equipment (O'Connell 2015), there may be insufficient bandwidth
(Winters 2007), and low quality audio and video transmission may
impede  clear  communication  (Winters  2007).  Despite  the  virtual
face-to-face  capabilities  of  real-time  video  counselling,  either  in-
person  communication  or  the  greater  anonymity  of  non-visual
contact may be preferred by the provider and client.

Why it is important to do this review

To  our  knowledge,  there  are  no  systematic  reviews  that  have
examined  the  effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling  for
smoking  cessation  in  any  smoking  population  or  setting.  Real-
time video counselling is a scalable intervention that may increase
access to a wider variety of smoking cessation services particularly
for people living in rural and remote areas and people with mobility
issues.  If  found  to  be  effective,  real-time  video  counselling  for
smoking  cessation  could  be  included  in  the  suite  of  smoking
cessation  services  offered  by  any  smoking  cessation  service
provider worldwide.

telephone counselling versus telephone counselling alone).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

1. Smoking  cessation  (e.g.  point  prevalence,  continuous  or
prolonged  abstinence)  measured  at  least  six  months  from
baseline.  Where  a  study  measured  cessation  in  several  ways,
we  used  the  most  stringent  measure  for  meta-analyses.  The
most  stringent  measure  was  the  one  that  required  smoking
cessation  to  have  been  achieved  for  the  longest  duration  (i.e.
prolonged  abstinence  was  judged  to  be  more  stringent  than
point  prevalence  abstinence).  Where  biochemically  validated
cessation  rates  were  not  available,  we  included  self-reported
measures of cessation in the analysis.

Secondary outcomes

1. Self-reported  number  of  quit  attempts  (i.e.  quitting  smoking

intentionally for one day or longer).

2. Intervention  adherence  (e.g.  number  of  completed  sessions)

and duration of consultations.

3. Satisfaction,  including  ease  of  use  (e.g.  satisfaction  with
counselling,  connectivity  and  quality  of  audio  and  video,
satisfaction with usability of video conferencing equipment).
4. Therapeutic  alliance  (e.g.  affective  bond,  client-therapist

collaboration, mutual goals).

Types of studies

Search methods for identification of studies

Randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  randomised  trials  (i.e.
comparing  multiple  treatment  groups),  cluster  RCTs  or  cluster
randomised  trials  that  measure  smoking  cessation  at  least  six
months from baseline.

Types of participants

Current  tobacco  smokers  (daily  or  occasional)  recruited  from
a  community,  healthcare  or  any  other  setting.  There  were  no
restrictions based on age, gender, level of nicotine dependence or
comorbidities.

Types of interventions

We  included  interventions  where  real-time  video  counselling
was  delivered  by  smoking  cessation  advisors  or  healthcare

Electronic searches

We  searched  the  following  electronic  databases:  the  Cochrane
Tobacco  Addiction  Group  Specialised  Register,  Cochrane  Central
Register  of  Controlled  Trials  (CENTRAL),  MEDLINE  (from  1946),
PubMed  (from  1966),  PsycINFO  (from  1806)  and  Embase  (from
1947)  to  identify  eligible  studies  published  to  13  August  2019.
The  search  strategy, 
including  MeSH  terms  and  keywords,
for  MEDLINE  is  presented  in  Appendix  1.  We  also  searched
International  Clinical  Trials
the  World  Health  Organization 
Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) and ClinicalTrials.gov
(clinicaltrials.gov/) to identify ongoing trials registered by 13 August
2019.

Searching other resources

We  checked  the  reference  lists  of  included  articles  and  relevant
systematic reviews to identify any additional eligible publications.
We  contacted  10  researchers  who  had  published  studies  of
behavioural  smoking  cessation  interventions,  including  the  first
authors of the included studies, and asked if they were aware of any
other randomised trials of real-time video counselling for smoking
cessation.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

One author (FT) implemented the search strategy and imported all
identified references from each electronic database into EndNote
reference  management  software  and  removed  duplicates.  Two
authors (FT and CP or TR or JD or RH or EB or JB) independently
screened  the  titles  and  abstracts  in  duplicate  to  determine  if
they met the inclusion criteria. For articles that appeared relevant
or  where  we  could  not  determine  eligibility  from  the  title  or
abstract,  we  obtained  the  full-text  article.  The  same  two  authors
independently reviewed full-text articles in duplicate for possible
inclusion. The two authors discussed any inconsistencies until they
reached consensus.

Data extraction and management

Two authors (FT and CG) independently extracted data in duplicate
from all eligible and ongoing trials. We used a standardised data
collection  form,  adapted  from  the  Cochrane  Effective  Practice
and  Organisation  of  Care  (EPOC)  Group's  template  (EPOC  2015),
which  was  tailored  to  this  review's  objectives.  We  pilot-tested
the  data  collection  form  and  incorporated  the  feedback.  We
extracted  the  following  information  from  the  eligible  studies:
authors  and  year  of  publication;  setting  and  location/country;
population; recruitment method and consent rate; sample size and
sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, level
of  education,  socioeconomic  status);  smoking  status  and  history
(e.g.  current  or  occasional  smoker,  level  of  nicotine  dependence,
interest in quitting), inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria; study
design;  video  counselling  intervention  (e.g.  number  of  contacts,
duration,  frequency,  type  of  provider);  comparison  arm  (e.g.
control or other smoking cessation treatment, number of contacts/
doses,  duration,  frequency,  type  of  provider);  biochemically
validated smoking cessation outcomes (where available) and self-
reported  smoking  cessation  outcomes;  self-reported  number  of
quit  attempts;  satisfaction  and  therapeutic  alliance  measures  for
video intervention and comparison arms; and costs.

The  two  authors  discussed  discrepancies  in  data  extraction  until
they reached consensus.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two  authors  (FT  and  CW)  independently  assessed  the  risk
of  bias  for  included  trials  using  the  Cochrane  'Risk  of  bias'
tool  (Higgins  2011).  We  assessed  the  following  six  study
characteristics:  random  sequence  generation  (selection  bias);
allocation  concealment  (selection  bias);  blinding  of  outcome
assessment  (detection  bias);  incomplete  outcome  data  (attrition
bias);  selective  outcome  reporting  (reporting  bias)  and  other
biases  (e.g.  contamination,  baseline  imbalances,  inappropriate
administration  of  the  intervention)  (Higgins  2011).  In  addition,
for  cluster  RCTs  we  planned  to  assess  the  risk  of:  recruitment

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

bias;  baseline  imbalance;  loss  of  clusters;  incorrect  analysis  and
comparability  with  individually  randomised  trials  (Higgins  2011).
We  rated  each  of  these  features  as  'low',  'high'  or  'unclear'  risk
using the criteria for judging risk of bias described in the Cochrane
Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2011).
The two authors discussed the inconsistencies in ratings to reach
consensus.

Measures of treatment effect

For  the  dichotomous  primary  outcome,  we  calculated  a  risk
ratio  (RR)  and  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  each  study.  The
RR  for  each  study  was  calculated  as  (number  of  participants
who  reported  smoking  abstinence  in  the  intervention  group/
number  of  participants  randomised  to  the  intervention  group)/
(number of participants who reported smoking abstinence in the
control  (comparison)  group/number  of  participants  randomised
to  the  control  (comparison)  group).  For  dichotomous  secondary
outcomes,  we  calculated  the  RR  with  95%  CI  for  each  study.  We
analysed  continuous  secondary  outcomes  by  calculating  mean
differences (MD) if the trials used the same method of measurement
or standardised mean difference (SMD) if each study used different
measures, with 95% CI.

Unit of analysis issues

For cluster RCTs, we planned to extract individual level data that
adjusted  for  clusters  using  an  intracluster  correlation  coefficient
(ICC). If clusters were not controlled for in the analyses, we planned
to  contact  the  trial's  authors  and  request  the  ICC  information.  If
this information was unavailable, we planned to obtain an estimate
of the ICC from similar studies where appropriate, and perform an
approximate analysis.

Dealing with missing data

We  reported  the  number  and  percentage  of  participants  lost  to
follow-up  in  each  relevant  arm,  and  considered  this  in  the  'Risk
of  bias'  assessment.  Where  primary  outcome  data  were  missing
at follow-up, we used a conservative approach commonly used in
the  tobacco  control  field  that  assumes  that  people  with  missing
data  continue  to  smoke  tobacco  (Hedeker  2007).  We  recorded  if
the  trial's  authors  conducted  sensitivity  analyses  using  different
assumptions to deal with missing data. Analysis was based on the
intention-to-treat principle and participants remained in the group
they were randomly allocated to, irrespective of the extent to which
they received the intervention/comparison.

We contacted the first authors of included studies to ask for further
data  when  required  in  relation  to  the  primary  and  secondary
outcomes.

Assessment of heterogeneity

inspected  the  characteristics  of 

included  studies  and
We 
considered whether there was clinical or methodological (or both)
heterogeneity  across  included  trials.  We  also  used  forest  plots
to  visually  inspect  statistical  heterogeneity  among  studies'  effect
estimates.  When  there  were  sufficient  homogenous  studies,  we
pooled  the  data  and  quantified  statistical  heterogeneity  using
the  I2  statistic.  The  I2  statistic  is  a  measure  of  inconsistency  that
describes the percentage of variation between studies that is due to
heterogeneity rather than sampling error (chance) (Higgins 2011).
We  considered  I2  statistic  of  50%  or  greater  as  representative  of

substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). Due to the limited studies
included, we were unable to explore reasons for such variability by
conducting subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Assessment of reporting biases

If  there  were  at  least  10  studies,  we  planned  to  use  funnel
plots  to  assess  publication  bias.  Asymmetrical  funnel  plots
may  be  indicative  of  publication  bias,  although  other  potential
explanations for asymmetry in funnel plots include methodological
flaws or true heterogeneity (Egger 1997). However, given that there
were fewer than 10 included studies, we did not test for funnel plot
asymmetry, as the power would have been too low to distinguish
chance from real asymmetry (Higgins 2011).

Data synthesis

Where  meta-analysis  of  outcomes  was  deemed  appropriate,
following  assessment  of  heterogeneity,  we  pooled  studies  by
calculating  RR,  MD  and  SMD  for  each  outcome  using  a  random-
effects  model.  We  analysed  continuous  secondary  outcomes  by
calculating  MD  if  the  same  method  of  measurement  was  used
across  trials  for  an  outcome,  or  SMD  if  different  measures  were
employed.

For the primary outcome, a pooled RR greater than 1 indicated that
more participants in the real-time video counselling arm achieved
tobacco  abstinence  than  participants  in  the  control/comparison
arm.

Where  RCTs  or  cluster  RCTs  included  multiple  arms,  we  included
only  the  arms  that  met  the 
inclusion  criteria.  If  multiple
intervention or control arms were eligible, we combined all relevant
and comparable intervention arms into a single intervention group
and all relevant and comparable control arms into a single control
group to create a single pair-wise comparison.

In trials with multiple follow-up points of six months or greater, we
analysed  the  most  stringent  cessation  outcome  measured  at  the
longest follow-up.

We  planned  to  report  any  studies  not  suitable  for  meta-analysis
using  a  narrative  synthesis,  categorising  studies  based  on  the
intervention versus control/comparison group and the population
type, and summarising the primary outcome (smoking cessation)
followed by each of the secondary outcomes.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We  planned  to  investigate  any  potential  heterogeneity  between
studies by conducting subgroup analyses, categorising studies by
population (e.g. general population, people with cancer or people
with mental health conditions), intensity of support (e.g. number
of  sessions),  type  of  provider  (e.g.  healthcare  provider,  smoking
cessation counsellor) and type of control/comparison group (e.g.
no  intervention  control,  proactive  telephone  counselling).  We
planned to compare pooled summary statistics across groups and
run statistical tests for subgroup differences.

Sensitivity analysis

If there were sufficient studies, we planned to perform sensitivity
analyses to examine the impact of removing trials from the meta-

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

analyses that were judged at high risk of bias (i.e. rated as high risk
of  bias  on  one  or  more  domains).  Abstinence  misreporting  rates
have  been  found  not  to  differ  significantly  between  intervention
and control conditions (Lantini 2015), and there is often substantial
non-response  to  biochemical  validation  in  studies  of  remote
interventions,  therefore  we  planned  to  perform  a  sensitivity
analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of  using  self-reported  cessation
rates only.

'Summary of findings' table

The 'Summary of findings' table describes the certainty of evidence
for  the  primary  outcome  using  information  and  approaches
recommended  in  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Two authors (FT and TM) assessed
the  certainty  of  the  body  of  evidence  for  the  primary  outcome
(i.e. smoking cessation) using the GRADE approach (Guyatt 2011).
The  same  was  planned  for  any  studies  reporting  our  secondary
outcome:  'therapeutic  alliance'.  This  involved  consideration  of:
risk  of  bias  (methodological  quality);  directness  of  evidence;
heterogeneity; precision of effect estimates and risk of publication
bias. We assigned each outcome a GRADE rating of 'very low', 'low',
'moderate' or 'high'. The two authors discussed any disagreements
until they reached consensus.

Incorporating economic evidence

We  developed  a  brief  economic  evaluation  based  on  current
methods guidelines (Shemilt 2011), to summarise the availability
and  principal  findings  of  trial-based  economic  evaluations  (cost
analyses,  cost-effectiveness  analyses,  cost-utility  analyses  and
cost–benefit  analyses)  that  compare  real-time  video  counselling
to no intervention control or other smoking cessation treatments,
among  current  tobacco  smokers.  This  economic  evaluation
focused  on  the  extent  to  which  principal  findings  of  eligible
economic  evaluations  indicate  that  an  intervention  might  be
judged favourably (or unfavourably) from an economic perspective,
when implemented in different settings. The eligibility criteria for
the  studies  that  were  included  in  the  economic  evaluation  (with
respect to the population, intervention, comparator(s) and primary
health outcome) were the same as those for the main systematic
review of treatment effects.

Results of the search

We identified 5764 records from the electronic database searches
and  317  records  from  trial  registries.  After  removing  duplicates,
we  screened  2974  records  and  retrieved  38  full-text  articles  for
further review. We excluded 23 of these full-text articles (reasons
listed in Excluded studies). Two completed trials (Kim 2018; Richter
2015),  and  one  ongoing  trial  (Tzelepis  2018)  met  this  review's
inclusion  criteria.  We  linked  secondary  reports  related  to  these
completed and ongoing trials to each study's primary reference in
the references. The PRISMA flow diagram illustrating the process for
study selection is presented in Figure 1 (Moher 2009).

Included studies

Types of studies

This review includes two randomised trials that compared smoking
cessation treatments and randomised 615 participants (Kim 2018;
Richter 2015). Both studies were conducted in the USA (Kim 2018;
Richter  2015).  The  trials  were  supported  by  government  (Richter
2015) or university (Kim 2018) funding.

Participants

Richter  2015  recruited  participants  from  20  primary  care  clinics
located in rural counties and via community-based activities, and
Kim 2018 recruited people living with HIV from communities across
the USA using professional networks of healthcare providers and
study  adverts  placed  on  a  free  website.  Eligible  smokers  were
defined as those who smoked five or more cigarettes per day for
at  least  one  year  and  had  smoked  25  out  of  the  past  30  days  in
Richter  2015,  and  as  those  who  smoked  at  least  five  cigarettes
a  day  for  the  past  six  months  in  Kim  2018.  Kim  2018  required
participants to be willing to set a quit date within four weeks from
the first counselling session, and Richter 2015 included all smokers
regardless of their motivation to quit. The number of participants
randomised  in  the  two  trials  was  49  (Kim  2018)  and  566  (Richter
2015), which represented 88% (Kim 2018) and 37% (Richter 2015) of
participants who met eligibility criteria. Kim 2018 included women
only, while Richter 2015 had no restrictions on gender. In Kim 2018,
most participants were black and there was a significant proportion
of Hispanic (28.6%) participants. In Richter 2015, more than 60% of
participants had an income less than 200% of the Federal Poverty
Level  which  means  that  their  annual  income  was  less  than  twice
the  income  of  people  on  the  poverty  line  (DeNavas-Walt  2010).
The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day in each trial was
14.2  (Kim  2018)  and  19.7  (Richter  2015),  and  mean  scores  on  the
Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence were 4.9 (Richter 2015)
and 5.6 (Kim 2018).

Interventions

Both  studies  delivered  real-time  video  counselling  for  smoking
cessation individually and not in a group format. In Kim 2018, the
video  counselling  intervention  consisted  of  eight  sessions,  while
in  Richter  2015  the  intervention  comprised  four  sessions.  The
length  of  the  video  treatment  was  eight  weeks  in  both  studies.
Kim  2018  used  10-  to  30-minute  video  sessions,  while  Richter
2015 did not report video session duration. Richter 2015 delivered
the real-time video counselling intervention via videoconferencing
equipment  located  at  primary  care  clinics,  so  participants  were
required  to  travel  to  receive  video  counselling,  while  Kim  2018
delivered the video counselling intervention via software installed
on the participants' own smartphones. Richter 2015 delivered the
video  counselling  intervention  between  2009  and  2011  and  Kim
2018 between 2016 and 2017.

the 

Both  studies  compared 
real-time  video  counselling
intervention with a telephone counselling intervention for smoking
cessation,  and  delivered  the  telephone  counselling  interventions
directly  to  participants  via  their  own  telephones.  The  intended
number and timing of sessions, length of treatment and duration of
sessions in the telephone counselling interventions were identical
to  those  of  the  video  counselling  interventions  delivered  in  each
study.

Kim  2018  based  the  counselling  content  for  both  the  video
counselling  and  telephone  counselling 
interventions  on  a
behavioural  therapy  foundation,  guided  by  Bandura's  Social
Cognitive  Theory  and,  Richter  2015  on  a  combination  of
motivational interviewing and CBT. A tobacco treatment specialist
and  a  trained  graduate  student  delivered  the  counselling  in  Kim
2018, and trained counsellors delivered the counselling in Richter
2015.

Kim 2018 provided all participants with nicotine patches. Richter
2015  provided  information  about  the  cessation  medications
covered  by  participants'  insurance  plan  or  public  assistance
programme,  and  study  staff  assisted  income-eligible  participants
with  no  insurance  coverage  to  apply  for  cessation  medications
from the pharmacy assistance programmes of pharmaceutical drug
companies.

Outcomes

Both  studies  reported  cessation  outcomes  at  short-term  (less
than six months) and long-term (six months or greater) follow-up
assessments. The long-term follow-up assessments ranged from six
months to 12 months. Both studies reported prolonged abstinence
and point prevalence abstinence outcomes. Given that we judged
prolonged abstinence to be a more stringent measure of cessation
than  point  prevalence  abstinence,  we  included  the  prolonged
abstinence  outcome  data  in  the  meta-analysis  for  both  studies.
Both studies described self-reported and biochemically validated
cessation outcomes. Both studies biochemically validated smoking
cessation outcomes using a salivary cotinine test.

Richter 2015 assessed number of quit attempts and did so among
participants who continued to smoke at 12 months. Both studies
examined  intervention  adherence,  which  Kim  2018  defined  as
the  completion  of  all  eight  counselling  sessions  and  Richter
2015  as  the  mean  number  of  counselling  sessions.  Both  studies
measured satisfaction using self-reported measures, and Kim 2018
reported acceptable internal consistency. Richter 2015 reported on
therapeutic alliance in a secondary data analysis, and Kim 2018 did
not assess therapeutic alliance.

Excluded studies

Risk of bias in included studies

We  excluded  23  full-text  records  as  they  did  not  meet  the
review's  inclusion  criteria.  Reasons  for  exclusion  included:  did
not assess a real-time video counselling intervention (15 studies);
were  not  randomised  trials  (four  studies);  used  real-time  video
intervention  to  deliver  support  in  both  arms  (each  arm  targeted
different  behaviours)  (one  study);  and  follow-up  was  less  than
six  months  postbaseline  (three  studies).  See  Characteristics  of
excluded studies table.

For  each  included  study,  we  described  the  authors'  judgements
and  support  for  judgements  in  the  'Risk  of  bias'  section  of  the
Characteristics of included studies table. Figure 2 summarises the
results  for  each  risk  of  bias  item  across  all  included  studies.  We
judged both studies at low risk of detection bias and reporting bias
and  at  unclear  risk  of  selection  bias  (Kim  2018;  Richter  2015).  In
relation to attrition bias, we rated Kim 2018 at high risk and Richter
2015 at low risk. Figure 3 presents the risk of bias assessments for
each individual study.

Allocation

Selective reporting

In  relation  to  random  sequence  generation,  Kim  2018  used  a
computer-generated  number  and  was  at  low  risk  of  bias,  while
Richter  2015  did  not  describe  the  method  used  to  generate  the
random sequence and was at unclear risk of bias. Both studies were
at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment because there was
no description about whether the sealed envelopes were opaque.

Both studies were at low risk of reporting bias as the primary and
secondary outcomes reported aligned to those prespecified in the
published study protocols.

Other potential sources of bias

There was no evidence of other potential sources of bias.

Outcome assessment (detection bias)

Effects of interventions

The  risk  of  detection  bias  for  the  smoking  cessation  outcome
was  low  in  both  studies  as  smoking  cessation  was  biochemically
verified.

See:  Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  Real-
time  video  counselling  compared  with  telephone  counselling  for
smoking cessation

Incomplete outcome data

Richter  2015  reported  12%  attrition  at  12-month  follow-up  with
similar losses across arms and was at low risk of attrition bias. In
Kim  2018,  the  risk  of  attrition  bias  was  high  because  attrition  at
the  six-month  postquit  follow-up  was  significantly  higher  in  the
telephone  counselling  arm  (52.4%)  than  in  the  video  counselling
arm (19%).

See Summary of findings for the main comparison.

Primary outcome

Smoking cessation

There  was  no  evidence  of  a  difference  for  smoking  cessation
(using the strictest definition and longest follow-up) across the two
included studies when real-time video counselling was compared
to telephone counselling (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.38 to 12.04; 2 studies,
608  participants;  I2  =  66%;  Analysis  1.1).  Although  Kim  2018
randomised 49 participants, seven were excluded from the meta-
analysis  because  six  did  not  meet  inclusion  criteria  (no  access

to  video  software  or  ex-smokers)  and  one  died.  We  rated  the
certainty  of  the  evidence  for  smoking  cessation  as  very  low  due
to  methodological  limitations  in  the  design,  imprecision  of  the
effect  estimate  and  inconsistency  of  cessation  rates.  In  Richter
2015, the prolonged smoking cessation rates were 8.2% for video
counselling  and  7.3%  for  telephone  counselling  (RR  1.12,  95%  CI
0.63 to 1.97; 566 participants) at 12 months follow-up, while for Kim
2018 the prolonged smoking cessation rates were 33.3% for video
counselling and 4.8% for telephone counselling (RR 7.0, 95% CI 0.94
to 52.04; 42 participants) at six-month postquit. Given both studies
reported biochemically verified cessation rates, we did not perform
sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  the  impact  of  using  self-reported
cessation rates only.

Secondary outcomes

Number of quit attempts

Richter  2015  examined  quit  attempts  among  participants  who
continued  to  smoke  at  12  months  and  reported  no  significant
difference  in  mean  number  of  quit  attempts  between  the  video
counselling group (mean 4.8, standard deviation (SD) 6.8) and the
telephone counselling group (mean 4.3, SD 5.7) (MD 0.50, 95% CI –
0.60 to 1.60; 499 participants; Analysis 2.1). Only participants who
continued to smoke at the 12-month assessment were included in
this analysis.

Intervention adherence

Both  studies  assessed  intervention  adherence  using  either  a
continuous measure (number of counselling sessions, Richter 2015)
or  a  dichotomous  measure  (per  cent  completing  all  counselling
sessions,  Kim  2018).  Given  the  differences  in  the  measures,  we
did  not  pool  data  from  these  two  studies.  Richter  2015  found  no
evidence  of  a  difference  in  mean  number  of  counselling  sessions
between  participants  randomised  to  the  video  counselling  arm
(mean 2.4, SD 1.5) and participants randomised to the telephone
counselling arm (mean 2.6, SD 1.5) (MD –0.20, 95% CI –0.45 to 0.05;
566 participants; Analysis 3.1). In Kim 2018, there was no evidence
of a difference between participants who completed all sessions in
the video counselling arm (66.7%) or the telephone counselling arm
(59.1%) (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.79; 43 participants; Analysis 3.2).
While Kim 2018 excluded the woman who died from the smoking
cessation  outcome  data,  she  was  included  in  the  intervention
adherence data which was part of the process evaluation and so
there were 43 rather than 42 participants included in this analysis.

Satisfaction

Both  studies  assessed  satisfaction;  however,  due  to  differences
in  the  measures  used,  we  were  unable  to  pool  the  data.
Both  studies  included  only  participants  who  completed  the
satisfaction  measures  in  the  follow-up  surveys  in  the  analysis.
In  Richter  2015,  those  in  the  video  counselling  arm  (97%)
were  significantly  more  likely  than  their  telephone  counselling
counterparts  (91.9%)  to  recommend  the  programme  to  a  friend
or family member (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.11; 398 participants;
Analysis  4.1).  There  were  no  other  between-group  differences
on  other  satisfaction  items  reported  by  Richter  2015.  Kim  2018
reported no significant differences in the mean scores of the Client
Satisfaction  Questionnaire  between  the  video  counselling  arm
(mean 29.6, SD 2.5) and telephone counselling arm (mean 28.9, SD
2.6) (MD 0.70, 95% CI –1.16 to 2.56; 29 participants; Analysis 4.2).

Therapeutic alliance

Only  Richter  2015  examined  therapeutic  alliance,  and  reported
no  significant  difference  in  mean  scores  of  therapeutic  alliance
between the video counselling group (mean 70.38, SD 5.8) and the
telephone counselling group (mean 69.25, SD 8) (MD 1.13, 95% CI
–0.24 to 2.50; 398 participants; Analysis 5.1). The analysis included
only participants who completed the follow-up assessment.

Summary of main results

This  review  included  two  randomised  trials  that  compared
the  effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling  to  telephone
counselling  for  smoking  cessation.  A  meta-analysis  that  pooled
the  findings  from  the  two  randomised  trials  found  no  evidence
of  a  difference  for  smoking  cessation  between  real-time  video
counselling and telephone counselling. Using the GRADE approach,
we rated the certainty of the evidence comparing real-time video
counselling to telephone counselling for smoking cessation as very
low  due  to  methodological  limitations  in  design,  imprecision  of
results  and  inconsistency  in  cessation  rates.  There  was  very  low
confidence in the meta-analysis result for smoking cessation due to
such limitations and further research is needed to produce greater
certainty  in  this  effect  estimate.  With  regards  to  the  secondary
outcomes, there were no differences between the real-time video
counselling  and  telephone  counselling  groups  for  mean  number
of  quit  attempts  and  therapeutic  alliance  in  Richter  2015  and
intervention  adherence  for  each  of  the  two  studies.  In  terms  of
satisfaction, video counselling participants were significantly more
likely than their telephone counselling counterparts to recommend
the  programme  to  a  friend  or  family  member  in  Richter  2015.
However, there was no evidence of between-group differences for
other satisfaction measures in either of the included studies.

Economic evaluation

To  supplement  the  main  systematic  review  of  efficacy  of  real-
time  video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation,  we  sought  to
identify economic evaluations of the approach; however economic
evidence  regarding  real-time  video  counselling  for  smoking
cessation  is  currently  lacking.  The  following  information  was
available from the two included studies relating to the costs of the
intervention. Richter 2015 reported the costs of providing the video
and  telephone  counselling  interventions  from  the  perspective  of
the provider, participant and society, as well as the cost per quit.
To  receive  the  intervention,  participants  in  the  video  counselling
group  had  to  travel  to  a  clinic  where  the  videoconferencing
equipment  was  located,  whereas  the  telephone  counselling
intervention was delivered to participants directly in their homes.
When  calculating  costs  for  the  video  counselling  intervention,
the  cost  of  clinic  space  was  calculated  using:  rental  rate  and
physician office visit rates. The mean cost of the video counselling
intervention from a provider perspective was USD 47.04 (SD 32.59)
when  clinic  space  was  valued  at  rental  rate  and  USD  272.65  (SD
178.29) when valued at physician office visit rates compared to USD
53.25  (SD  35.82)  for  the  telephone  counselling  intervention.  For
the  video  counselling  intervention,  the  total  participant  variable
costs  without  pharmacotherapy  was  USD  119.44  (SD  341)  and
with  pharmacotherapy  was  USD  124.55  (SD  259.10)  compared  to
USD  28.36  (SD  27.80)  without  pharmacotherapy  and  USD  75.29
(SD  169.10)  with  pharmacotherapy  in  the  telephone  counselling
intervention.  The  total  participant  variable  costs  for  the  video

counselling arm included travel time costs and mileage costs and
there was larger variation in participant costs than in the telephone
counselling  group.  From  a  societal  perspective,  the  cost  of  the
video counselling intervention was USD 166.04 (SD 347.90) when
clinic space was valued at rental rate and USD 390.20 (SD 415.40)
when valued at physician office visit rates compared to USD 81.61
(SD  58.70)  for  the  telephone  counselling  intervention.  The  cost
per  quit  from  the  provider  perspective  was  USD  480/quit  for  the
video counselling intervention compared to USD 444/quit for the
telephone counselling intervention. The cost per quit increased to
USD 1694/quit for the video counselling intervention and USD 680/
quit  for  the  telephone  counselling  intervention  when  participant
costs were added (Richter 2015). Kim 2018 reported no economic
data. Future studies should undertake economic evaluations of the
real-time video counselling model for smoking cessation.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

There is very limited evidence about the effectiveness of real-time
video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation.  Only  two  randomised
trials  were  included  in  this  review  and  these  studies  examined
the  comparative  effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling
to  telephone  counselling.  None  of  the  studies  examined  real-
time  video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation  compared  to  a
no  intervention  control  or  a  behavioural  smoking  cessation
intervention  other  than  telephone  counselling  (e.g.  face-to-face
counselling). The findings of the smoking cessation meta-analysis
should be interpreted with caution due to evidence of substantial
heterogeneity, the limited studies pooled and the small sample size
in Kim 2018. There was also inadequate information of the effect
of  real-time  video  counselling  on  the  secondary  outcomes.  Two
trials assessed intervention adherence and satisfaction; however,
these  results  could  not  be  pooled  because  of  differences  in
measures  (e.g.  continuous  or  dichotomous  measures),  only  one
trial  examined  number  of  quit  attempts  (Richter  2015),  and  one
explored therapeutic alliance (Richter 2015). Richter 2015 reported
cost  findings;  however,  participants  had  to  travel  to  the  clinic  to
use  the  video-conferencing  equipment,  and  so  costs  would  be
different  if  real-time  video  counselling  was  delivered  to  smokers
at  home.  Furthermore,  the  requirement  to  travel  to  the  clinic
meant that video counselling lacked the convenience of telephone
counselling,  despite  both  these  interventions  being  able  to  be
delivered directly to participants at home. This may have had an
impact  on  intervention  adherence  and  smoking  cessation,  which
may have differed if participants received video sessions at home.
Due  to  insufficient  studies,  we  were  unable  to  conduct  planned
subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses  to  address  the  heterogeneity
between  studies,  or  the  impact  of  risk  of  bias  and  using  self-
reported  cessation  rates  only.  Furthermore,  given  that  only  one
study measured therapeutic alliance, this secondary outcome was
not included in the Summary of findings for the main comparison
(as  per  the  protocol;  Tzelepis  2017),  because  it  could  not  be
assessed in terms of features that contribute to the GRADE rating
such as heterogeneity. The two included studies were conducted in
the USA (Kim 2018, Richter 2015), so the findings may have limited
generalisability  to  low-  and  middle-income  countries  and  other
high-income countries with different ethnic groups.

Certainty of the evidence

Based  on  the  GRADE  approach  (Guyatt  2011),  we  judged  the
certainty of the evidence for smoking cessation to be very low. The
GRADE rating was downgraded by one level for each of the following

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

factors:  methodological  limitations  in  the  design;  imprecision  of
results  and  inconsistency  in  cessation  rates.  The  wide  95%  CIs
around  the  effect  estimate  and  substantial  heterogeneity  across
the  studies  illustrate  the  imprecision  of  this  result.  Potential
sources  of  heterogeneity  may  include  the  differences  in  type  of
participants  (i.e.  rural  residents  versus  people  living  with  HIV),
intensity of the video counselling intervention (four sessions versus
eight  sessions),  the  manner  in  which  pharmacotherapies  were
provided (i.e. directly versus indirectly), the way in which the video
counselling was delivered (i.e. videoconferencing equipment at the
clinic versus via participants' smartphones) and the longest follow-
up  (six  months  postquit  versus  12  months).  The  methodological
limitations included that both studies were assessed at unclear risk
of  bias  for  allocation  concealment.  Kim  2018  was  at  high  risk  of
attrition bias because the attrition rate at the six-month postquit
follow-up  was  significantly  higher  in  the  telephone  counselling
arm  (52.4%)  than  in  the  video  counselling  arm  (19%).  The
methodological strengths included that both studies biochemically
validated  smoking  cessation  and  were  assessed  at  low  risk  of
detection bias. In relation to the inconsistency in cessation rates, in
Richter 2015, the prolonged smoking cessation rates were 8.2% for
video counselling and 7.3% for telephone counselling at 12 months'
follow-up,  while  for  Kim  2018,  the  prolonged  smoking  cessation
rates  were  33.3%  for  video  counselling  and  4.8%  for  telephone
counselling at 6 months postquit.

Potential biases in the review process

To reduce the risk of potential biases, we performed comprehensive
searches  of  electronic  databases  and  trial  registries,  checked
reference  lists  of 
included  studies,  and  contacted  smoking
cessation researchers. As per Cochrane recommendations (Higgins
2011),  two  authors  independently  screened  titles,  abstracts  and
full-text  articles,  and  completed  data  extraction  and  risk  of  bias
assessments.  Despite  this  rigorous  approach,  it  is  possible  that
relevant  literature,  particularly  unpublished/grey  literature,  may
have  been  missed.  It  is  also  possible  that  non-reporting  of
information in the published articles may have influenced the risk
of bias assessments. Because of the lack of studies, we were unable
to  check  for  reporting  bias  as  planned  in  our  protocol  (Tzelepis
2017).

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

To  our  knowledge  this 
first  systematic  review  to
is  the 
investigate  the  effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling  for
smoking  cessation  in  any  smoking  population  or  setting.  As
part  of  a  systematic  review  that  examined  the  effectiveness  of
various  technology-based  smoking  cessation  interventions,  the
effectiveness  of  real-time  video  counselling  was  investigated  in
low  socioeconomic  status  or  disadvantaged  populations  (Boland
2018).  The  Boland  2018  review  included  only  one  study  of  video
counselling (Richter 2015), and, consistent with the current review,
there was no significant treatment effect reported between video
counselling and telephone counselling. Further randomised trials
of real-time video counselling for smoking cessation are needed to
inform future systematic reviews and advance the limited literature
currently available.

Implications for practice

There  is  very  little  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  real-time
video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation  to  guide  the  policies
and  practices  of  service  providers  such  as  quitlines.  The  meta-
analysis of the effect of video counselling compared to telephone
counselling  on  smoking  cessation  included  data  from  only  two
studies  and  there  was  evidence  of  methodological  limitations  in
the  design,  imprecision  of  the  effect  estimate  and  inconsistency
in  the  cessation  rates,  so  there  is  very  low  certainty  about  the
effect.  Importantly,  there  is  no  evidence  that  compares  real-
time  video  counselling  to  a  control  group  to  determine  whether
video counselling increases smoking cessation. There is insufficient
evidence  from  which  to  draw  reliable  conclusions  regarding  the
effectiveness  of  integrating  real-time  video  counselling  into  the
routine practices of quitlines and other smoking cessation services.

Implications for research

Further  randomised  trials  of  real-time  video  counselling  for
smoking cessation are necessary to inform the evidence base. This
review included only two studies from the US that compared video
counselling  to  telephone  counselling  and  focused  on  particular
subgroups of smokers such as smokers in rural locations (Richter
2015),  and  women  with  HIV  (Kim  2018).  There  is  no  evidence
about the effectiveness of real-time video counselling for smoking
cessation compared to a no intervention control or any behavioural
smoking cessation intervention other than telephone (e.g. face-to-
face),  suggesting  that  randomised  trials  that  address  these  gaps
in  the  literature  are  needed.  To  increase  the  generalisability  of
the  evidence,  future  studies  could  be  conducted  outside  of  the
US in other high-income countries as well as in low- and middle-
income  countries  and  could  target  smokers  from  the  broader
general population or other subgroups at high risk of tobacco use
such as lower socioeconomic groups (Jamal 2018; Santero 2019);
adults with mental illness (Jamal 2018; Lê Cook 2014); indigenous
populations  (AIHW  2018;  Jetty  2017);  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender and queer populations (Jamal 2018; Wheldon 2018);
and  ethnic  minority  groups  (Jamal  2018;  Odani  2018).  There
was  limited  evidence  of  the  effect  of  video  counselling  on  quit
attempts,  intervention  adherence,  satisfaction  and  therapeutic
alliance.  Future  randomised  trials  could  be  designed  to  address
these gaps in the literature. Furthermore, only one study reported
the  cost  of  delivering  real-time  video  counselling  for  smoking

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

cessation  and  because  the  videoconferencing  equipment  was
located at clinics included the cost of clinic space (Richter 2015).
Further  studies  should  examine  the  cost-effectiveness  of  real-
time  video  counselling  for  smoking  cessation  delivered  directly
to  smokers  at  home,  as  such  information  will  be  important  for
informing the policies and practices of smoking cessation services.
Since  Richter  2015,  which  commenced  in  2009,  there  has  been
increased availability of video communication software that can be
downloaded  for  personal  use  onto  people's  personal  computers
or  mobile  devices  (Oduor  2013).  As  a  result  of  increased  access
to  video  communication  software,  future  research  will  no  longer
require participants to access a video communication intervention
via  equipment  located  at  clinics,  as  was  done  in  Richter  2015.
Instead, real-time video counselling for smoking cessation can be
delivered  directly  to  participants  at  home  or  a  location  of  their
choice  via  their  personal  computers  or  mobile  devices.  This  may
increase  use  of  the  video  counselling  intervention  and  reduce
barriers to accessing treatment.

None  of  the  existing  studies  delivered  the  real-time  video
counselling via a real-world quitline service or face-to-face smoking
cessation  service.  Future  research  should  test  real-time  video
counselling  within  such  services  to  strengthen  the  likelihood  of
developing a sustainable model of service delivery and to facilitate
rapid and direct translation of the research into the practices of real-
world smoking cessation service providers.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Interventions

Sociodemographic characteristics: 100% women, mean age 51.12 years (SD 7.65), 30.95% married or
living with partner, 28.57% Hispanic, 73.81% black, 57.14% had 12 years of education, 80.5% employed

Theory.

Telephone counselling: 8 weekly individualised counselling sessions with duration of 10–30 minutes
delivered via telephone. Quit date set during the first counselling session (participant encouraged to
choose a quit date between the third and fifth sessions). Counselling content based on a cognitive be-
havioural therapy foundation, guided by Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory.

All participants: 8-week supply of nicotine patches

Providers: tobacco treatment specialist and a trained graduate student

Outcomes

Cessation: prolonged abstinence at 6 months postquit (self-report at each follow-up and biochemical
validation at 3 and 6 months postquit), point prevalence abstinence at end of intervention (self-report),
3 months (biochemically validated) and 6 months postquit (biochemically validated)

Intervention adherence: 8 counselling sessions completed

Satisfaction: Client Satisfaction Questionnaire

Funding: partially supported by a Joseph P. Healey Research Grant awarded by the University of Mass-
achusetts (UMass) Boston and the UMass Boston – Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center U54 Partnership
grant.

Methods

Design: 2-arm randomised trial

Setting: 20 primary care clinics in Kansas, USA. Half the clinics were in cities with a population < 1800,
and 3 were federally qualified health clinics for the medically underserved.

Recruitment: people recruited at clinics by clinic staff and via mailings from clinic directors. Study staff
conducted community-based recruitment activities that targeted Latino people through radio inter-
views, health fairs, community newsletters and staff recruitment tables at Latino worksites, religious
organisations and businesses. Of 1544 eligible smokers, 566 (37%) provided consent and were ran-
domised.

Inclusion criteria: had a primary care physician who was participating in the study; ≥ 18 years of age;
smoke ≥ 5 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year; smoke 25 out of the past 30 days; spoke English or
Spanish and had a telephone. All smokers regardless of level of motivation to quit were eligible.

Exclusion criteria: used other tobacco products; currently taking smoking cessation medications or
participating in another quit smoking programme; breastfeeding, pregnant or planning to become
pregnant; planning to relocate in the next year or lived with a smoker already enrolled in the study.

Participants

Total number randomised: 566 randomised; 280 to integrated telemedicine (video counselling arm),
286 to telephone counselling arm

Interventions

Withdrawals and exclusions: no withdrawals reported, 874 not eligible, 828 declined to participate,
155 excluded for other reasons

Sociodemographic characteristics: 64.8% women, mean age 47.4 years (SD 12.9), 42.6% married,
82.9% Caucasian, 9% Hispanic/Latino, 56.8% high school education or less, 64.5% had income < 200%
Federal Poverty Level, 41.7% employed full-time

Smoking status and history: mean age started smoking regularly 17.1 years (SD 5.0), mean number of
cigarettes per day 19.7 (SD 10.3), mean nicotine dependence score 4.9 (SD 2.3), mean number of quit
attempts in past 12 months 2.0 (SD 3.1), mean longest period of past abstinence 382.9 days (SD 902.9),
73.4% prior use of cessation pharmacotherapy, 58.5% preparation stage to stop smoking, 39.0% con-
templation, 2.5% precontemplation, mean perceived competence for cessation score 5.0 (SD 1.5)

Video counselling: 4 video telemedicine counselling sessions over 8 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 4, 8) delivered
via Polycom PVX software, computer and webcam located at the clinic. The counselling approach was
adapted to smokers' level of motivation and based on Combined Behavioural Intervention, a combina-
tion of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy. If the participant created a quit
plan or expressed interest in pharmacotherapy (or both), the quit plan and a medication prescription
request form were faxed to the receptionist for placement in the participants' medical record and for
review/prescription approval by the participants' primary care provider.

Telephone counselling: 4 telephone counselling sessions over 8 weeks (weeks 0, 1, 4, 8) delivered via
their home or mobile phones. The counselling approach was adapted to smokers' level of motivation
and based on Combined Behavioural Intervention, a combination of motivational interviewing and
cognitive behavioural therapy. If the participant created a quit plan or expressed interest in pharma-
cotherapy (or both), the quit plan and a medication prescription request form were mailed to the par-
ticipant, with instructions to take the forms to their healthcare provider for placement in their medical
records and review/prescription approval by their primary care providers.

All participants: mailed study materials that included educational materials on smoking cessation and
a pharmacotherapy guidance form, which provided individually tailored information on what medica-
tions were covered by the participants' insurance plan or public assistance programme. Study staff as-
sisted income-eligible participants with no insurance coverage to apply for cessation medication from
the pharmacy assistance programmes of pharmaceutical drug companies.

Providers: 3 full-time equivalent trained counsellors

Outcomes

Cessation: biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months; self-reported point
prevalence abstinence at 3-, 6- and 12-months follow-ups; prolonged abstinence

Participants

Interventions

Target number: 1842; approximately 614 in video counselling arm, 614 in telephone counselling
arm, 614 in written materials (control) arm

Video counselling: up to 6 video sessions, with mean duration 15–20 minutes delivered via par-
ticipant's preferred form of video communication (e.g. Skype, FaceTime). The first video session
scheduled within 7 days of participant enrolment. For those who nominate a quit date within 1
month during the initial session, subsequent video sessions offered on the quit date and 3, 7, 14
and 30 days after the quit date. Those who are not ready to quit within 1 month during the initial
session offered video sessions at 2, 4 and 6 weeks. Counselling content based on quitline protocols
and cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing used to support smokers to quit.

Telephone counselling: up to 6 telephone sessions, with mean duration 15–20 minutes deliv-
ered via telephone. The first telephone session scheduled within 7 days of participant enrolment.
For those who nominate a quit date within 1 month during the initial session, subsequent tele-
phone sessions offered on the quit date and 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after the quit date. Those who are
not ready to quit within 1 month during the initial session offered telephone sessions at 2, 4 and
6 weeks. Counselling content based on quitline protocols and cognitive behavioural therapy and
motivational interviewing used to support smokers to quit.

Written materials (control): mailed one-off written materials (i.e. a quit kit)

Providers: advisors with university qualifications

Outcomes

Cessation: self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4, 7 and 13 months postbaseline,
prolonged abstinence at 4, 7 and 13 months postbaseline

Quit attempts: quit attempt at 4, 7 and 13 months postbaseline

Intervention adherence: number and duration of counselling sessions

Therapeutic alliance: 5-item Agnew Relationship measure (ARM-5) at 4 months postbaseline

Costs: cost-effectiveness analyses at 13 months postbaseline

The meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models rather than fixed-effect models as specified in the protocol (Tzelepis
2017), because random-effects models allow for variability between studies.

We did not assess blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) as part of the 'Risk of bias' assessment as specified in the
protocol (Tzelepis 2017), because blinding of this behavioural intervention is not possible.

Due  to  the  limited  number  of  eligible  studies,  we  did  not  conduct  subgroup  analyses  or  sensitivity  analyses  to  examine  potential
heterogeneity between studies, the impact of risk of bias and using self-reported cessation rates only.

Given there was only one study that measured the effect of real-time video counselling on therapeutic alliance, we did not include this
secondary outcome in the 'Summary of findings' table as specified in the protocol because it could not be assessed in terms of features
that contribute to the GRADE rating such as heterogeneity.
