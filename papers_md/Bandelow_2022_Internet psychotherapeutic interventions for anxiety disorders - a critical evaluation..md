Internet psychotherapeutic interventions 
for anxiety disorders – a critical evaluation
Borwin Bandelow* and Dirk Wedekind 

Abstract 
Background:  During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet-delivered psychotherapeutic interventions (IPI) move increas-
ingly into the focus of attention.

 4122 patients) for anxiety 
Method:  We reviewed 39 randomized controlled studies of IPIs with 97 study arms (n 
disorders (panic disorder/agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder) and performed a 
meta-analysis. Most studies were conducted with cognitive behavioural approaches (iCBT). Results were compared 
with a previous meta-analysis examining medications and face-to-face (F2F) psychotherapy.

=

Results:  In direct comparisons, IPIs were as effective as F2F-CBT and superior to waitlist controls. Programs with more 
intensive therapist contact yielded higher effect sizes (ES).

We compared the obtained ES with a previous comprehensive meta-analysis of 234 studies. In this comparison, iCBT 
was less effective than individual F2F-CBT and medications, not different from pill placebos, and more effective than 
psychological placebo and waitlist (p > .0001 for all comparisons).

ES of IPIs may be overestimated. Treatments were only compared to waitlist, which is not a sufficient control condi-
tion. 97% of the studies were not blinded with regard to the main outcome measure. 32% of the participants received 
antianxiety drugs during the trials. In 89%, participants were recruited by advertisements rather than from clinical 
settings, and 63% of the participants had an academic background (students or university employees) which might 
affect the generalizability of the findings.

Remote diagnoses were often made by students without completed training in psychotherapy. In only 15% of the 
studies, diagnoses were made in personal contact with a psychiatrist or psychologist. In 44% of the studies, the ‘thera-
pists’ maintaining remote contact with the participants were mostly students without completed psychotherapy 
education.

Conclusions:  IPIs may be a useful tool when face-to-face psychotherapy is not easily available, or as an add-on to 
standard psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatments but should perhaps not be used as monotherapy. 
We have suggested standards for future research and the practical use of IPIs.

Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, internet-delivered psy-
chotherapy interventions (IPI) for mental disorders move 
increasingly into focus of attention because personal con-
tacts can be avoided with these interventions. Moreover, 
IPIs  are  less  expensive,  save  therapist  time,  require  less

organizational efforts and can be used at any time of the 
day. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental dis-
orders  [1]  and  26%  of  all  psychotherapies  are  done  with 
patients  with  anxiety  disorders  [2].  As  many  individuals 
with  anxiety  disorders,  in  particular  with  social  phobia, 
are  reluctant  to  utilize  mental  health  services  because 
of  the  stigma  associated  with  mental  disorders,  avail-
ability  of  IPIs  may  increase  the  treatment  rates  in  this 
population.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to take a critical look 
at  IPIs  for  anxiety  disorders  and  to  determine  whether 
these  treatment  modalities  can  serve  as  a  full  replace-
ment for standard treatments.

Randomized  controlled  studies  (RCTs)  with  IPIs 
mostly  recruit  their  participants  via  newspaper  adver-
tisements  or  websites.  In  order  to  be  eligible,  partici-
pants  have  to  complete  diagnostic  tests  on  the  website. 
Some programs include structured diagnostic interviews 
administered over the telephone or a video link. Usually, 
participants  have  to  work  through  computerized  mod-
ules specially developed for anxiety disorders, which are 
based on standard psychotherapeutic techniques (mostly 
cognitive  behavioral  therapy-oriented  approaches),  and 
can  be  modified  to  accommodate  the  special  require-
ments  of  individual  participants.  The  modules  require 
about as much patient time as face-to-face (F2F) psycho-
therapy and often involve “homework”, e.g. self-exposure 
to threatening stimuli in phobic disorders. In most stud-
ies, participants can contact therapists via E-mail. How-
ever,  the  time  therapists  spend  communicating  with  the 
patients  is  usually  limited  because  saving  therapist  time 
is  one  of  the  goals  of  IPIs.  After  treatment  termination, 
patients usually rate their improvement by using self-rat-
ing scales on the website.

Conducting  an  RCT  on  a  website  is  much  easier  than 
doing a study with personal contact, as not only the ther-
apeutic  contact  with  participants  is  much  shorter  but 
also  the  time  spent  for  recruiting  patients,  completing 
forms  and  diagnostic  tests. The  forms  are  completed  by 
the participants on the website and can go directly to the 
electronic database, which can automatically perform the 
statistical  evaluation.  This  substantial  time-saving  effect 
may  explain  why  so  many  clinical  studies  on  IPIs  have 
been published in the recent years.

Earlier  meta-analyses  of  IPIs  for  anxiety  disorders, 
e.g.  [3],  have  shown  superiority  over  waitlist  control 
conditions.

In  a  previous  meta-analysis  on  treatments  for  anxiety 
disorders [4], we did not only look at the effect size (ES) 
differences  between  the  active  treatment  and  the  con-
trol  group  (treated  vs.  control  ES)  but  also  determined 
pre-post  ES.  The  use  of  pre-post  effect  sizes  has  been 
critisised  [5].  One  reason  is  that  baseline  and  post-test 

scores are not independent of each other, while the cor-
relation of both scores is almost never reported in clini-
cal  studies.  Moreover,  pre-post  ES  do  not  only  measure 
the  true  effect  of  a  treatment  but  also  comprise  unspe-
cific  effects  like  spontaneous  remission  or  tendency  of 
regression  to  the  mean.  However,  when  patient  popula-
tions are the same in the studies being compared, it can 
be  assumed  that  the  correlations  of  pre  and  post  scores 
and the unspecific effects are similar. On the other hand, 
pre-post  ES  have  the  advantage  that  they  can  be  used 
to  determine  the  absolute  improvement  of  treatments. 
When  studies  are  compared  that  have  different  control 
conditions,  measuring  pre-post  ES  is  the  only  way  to 
obtain a fair comparison. For example, drugs are mostly 
compared to a placebo, which has an average pre-post ES 
of Cohen’s d = 1.3, while waitlist control conditions have 
a  much  lower  average  pre-post  ES  of  d = 0.2.  The  dif-
ference  between  an  average  drug  and  a  pill  placebo  was 
around  2.0–1.3 = 0.7  (treated  vs.  control  ES),  according 
to  our  analysis,  while  the  difference  between  a  psycho-
logical therapy and a waitlist was 1.3–0.2 = 1.1. Thus, on 
the basis of treated vs. control ES, psychological therapies 
would seem to be the more effective treatment. However, 
in  absolute  terms,  the  average  ES  of  psychotherapies  is 
much less than the one of medications. Patients are only 
interested in a large absolute decrease of their symptoms 
from pre to post, not in the relative difference to a con-
trol group. Therefore, when trials using different control 
groups are being compared, using pre-post ES is the ade-
quate  method  [4,  6,  7].  Moreover,  the  pre-post  method 
allows  to  include  not  only  the  few  direct  comparisons, 
but many more studies, e.g. those RCTs that do not have 
an  inactive  control  group,  for  instance  when  different 
techniques are compared.

We  compared  the  ES  from  the  present  meta-analysis 
with  the  data  obtained  in  our  previous  analysis  which 
examined  F2F  psychotherapy  and  medications  for  anxi-
ety disorders.

Methods
We  included  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  com-
paring  IPIs  with  an  inactive  (e.g.  waitlist)  or  active  (e.g. 
F2F-CBT)  control  group  in  patients  aged  18  or  over 
who  met  criteria  for  PDA,  GAD,  and  SAD  accord-
ing  to  DSM-IV  or  later  versions.  Abstracts  were  identi-
fied  by  searching  for  the  terms  “internet”,  “randomized”, 
and  “treatment”  using  MEDLINE,  ISI  Web  of  Science, 
and  hand  search  (PRISMA  statement  [8],  Supplemental 
Appendix: supplementary Fig. 1; supplementary table 1) 
through December 2020. We also used a large database of 
all studies for anxiety disorders collected for the German 
guidelines  for  anxiety  disorders  [9]  which  was  updated 
for the 2021 version of the guideline [10].

After  screening  by  title  and  abstract,  full  texts  were 
assessed  for  eligibility.  Quality  of  study  reporting  was 
assessed  by  using  the  CONSORT  2010  Statement  [11]. 
Reasons  for  exclusion  were:  Reviews/comments,  open 
studies, case reports, samples including patients with no 
primary  anxiety  disorder  diagnosis  or  with  mixed  diag-
noses  (e.g.  including  participants  with  more  than  one 
anxiety disorder or other mental disorders), samples con-
taining only subgroups (e. g. only high school students), 
secondary  analyses,  studies not fulfilling inclusion crite-
ria  (e.  g.  studies  not  comparing  comparing  IPIs  with  an 
inactive or active control), studies only reporting follow-
up analyses of a previous study, combination treatments, 
missing  information  making  it  impossible  to  compute 
ES,  or  an  evaluable  sample  size  of  any  of  the  treatment 
arms < 10.  We  extracted  the  following  data  from  the 
included  studies:  participant  characteristics  (baseline 
symptom levels, mean age, gender, referral type, and edu-
cational  level),  support  during  intervention,  adherence 
to the study protocol, which was defined as the percent-
age of randomized participants who finished the course, 
diagnostic  scales,  information  about  sequence  genera-
tion,  allocation  concealment,  blinding,  and  drop-out 
analysis.

We  compared  the  results  of  the  pre-post  ES  of  this 
meta-analysis  with  a  previous  meta-analysis  done  with 
the same method [4] which included all evaluable RCTs 
with  F2F  psychotherapies  (n = 94;  6922  patients)  and 
common  antianxiety  medications,  e.g.  antidepressants 
(n = 110; 28,051 patients). Inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria and assessments of study quality were similar in both 
studies so that the study samples were comparable.

Meta‑analytical procedure

Two  reviewers  (BB  and  DW)  independently  extracted 
all  data,  with  differences  resolved  following  discus-
sion. Interrater reliability for decisions about whether to 
include or exclude a study was κ = 0.88. In order to limit 
heterogeneity  and  to  achieve  maximum  comparability, 
we  preferably  used  the  most  commonly  applied  scales, 
i.e.  the  Panic  Disorder  Severity  Scale  (PDSS)  for  PDA, 
the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) and GAD 
and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) for SAD. 
These  were  not  necessarily  defined  as  primary  efficacy 
measures in the studies. If these scales were not available, 
we used other specific symptoms scales following a hier-
archy [4]. All scales were self-rated by the participants.

All  inactive  control  conditions  used  in  the  RCTs  were 
waitlist  controls.  All  active  controls  were  F2F-CBT 
conditions.

Statistical  analysis  was  done  using  Comprehensive 
Meta-Analysis  3.  ES  (Cohen’s  d)  were  calculated  as  (1) 
treated  vs.  control  ES  (post-test  difference  between  the 

mean  of  the  treatment  condition  and  the  mean  of  the 
control  condition),  or  (2)  pre-post  ES,  in  both  cases 
divided  by  the  pooled  pre-treatment  standard  deviation 
and adjusted for sample size. We used Cohen’s d instead 
of Hedges’ g because the sample sizes were relative large 
(> 20 in all treatment arms). Because of the assumption of 
heterogeneous  populations  in  the  different  studies,  and 
because moderate  (I2 > 50%) to high (> 75%) heterogene-
ity was found for most comparisons, the random-effects 
model  was  used  in  all  analyses.  To  assess  publica-
tion  biases,  p  values  for  Egger’s  regression  intercept  (a 
method to quantify the bias captured by a funnel plot) for 
between group ES sizes, and ES adjusted for publication 
bias  using  Duval  and  Tweedie’s  ‘‘trim  and  fill’’  method, 
which is used to correct the funnel plot by estimating the 
number  of  missing  studies  and  the  ES  of  these  studies, 
were determined.

We  preferably  used  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  data  based 
on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method 
for  all  studies,  which  were  reported  in  all  but  2  studies. 
The ES for the 3 anxiety disorders were pooled in order 
to improve the statistical validity and to reduce the influ-
ence of heterogeneity by increasing the number of stud-
ies and to avoid multiple testing, which would have arisen 
if  the  3  disorders  were  tested  separately.  Nevertheless, 
we  also  determined  the  pre-post  ES  of  the  3  disorders 
separately.

The search identified 7 studies which directly compared 
iCBT with F2F-CBT. We also contrasted the ES in 8 stud-
ies in which treatment arms with minimal or no therapist 
support were compared to more intensive therapist sup-
port (e.g. up to three 15-min weekly contacts per E-mail).
The  statistical  methods  of  the  comparison  of  the  two 

meta-analyses are shown in the Supplemental Appendix.

Results
We identified 39 studies (PDA, n = 11; GAD, n = 8; SAD, 
n = 20)  with  97  treatment  arms.  IPI  arms  were  mostly 
based  on  CBT  approaches  (iCBT;  n = 57);  2  were  done 
with  Psychodynamic  Therapy  (iPDTh)  and  Applied 
Relaxation  (iAR),  and  1  with  Interpersonal  Therapy 
(iIPT).

Treated vs. control ES

In the 31 studies in which IPIs were directly compared 
to a waitlist condition (treated vs. control ES), a signifi-
cant  difference  to  waitlist  was  found  for  iCBT,  iPDTh, 
and  iAR  (Table  1;  see  also  Supplemental  Appendix: 
Forest  plot:  supplementary  Fig.  2;  funnel  plots:  sup-
plementary  Figs.  3  and  4).  Running  the  analysis  with-
out one extreme outlier [12] did not change the overall 
result.  In  7  studies  comparing  iCBT  with  F2F-CBT, 
no  significant  difference  was  found  (Table  1;  see  also

Pre‑post ES and comparison with previous meta‑analysis

Pre-post  ES  of  the  treatment  arms  are  tabulated  in 
Table 2.

We compared the findings for iCBT with our previous 
meta-analysis [4] by using pre-post ES (Fig. 1, Table 3). In 
this comparison with a large database, iCBT was signifi-
cantly  less  effective  than  anxiety  medications  and  F2F-
CBT,  not  different  from  pill  placebo,  and  more  effective 
than psychological placebo and wait list.

Characteristics of IPI studies

Supplemental  Appendix:  Forrest  plot:  supplemen-
tary  Fig.  5;  funnel  plot:  supplementary  Fig.  6).  In  the 
10  studies  comparing  minimal  or  no  therapist  support 
with  more  intensive  therapist  support,  high  inten-
sity  contact  was  significantly  more  effective;  however, 
the  mean  difference  was  marginal  (Table  1;  see  also 

The study characteristics are listed in Table 4. The mean 
duration of studies was 9.3 weeks. Average therapist time 
was  17.5  min  per  week.  The  average  adherence  in  the 
studies was 69.3%.

Limitations of the studies

In  the  majority  of  studies  (88.7%),  patients  were  not 
referred  from  clinical  settings  but  were  recruited  by

newspaper advertisements or websites. With the excep-
tion  of  one  study,  the  main  outcomes  of  the  studies 
were  not  blinded,  as  they  were  based  on  self-report 
questionnaires  and  the  patients  knew  that  they  were 
in the active treatment condition. Most studies (87.1%) 
allowed  concomitant  psychopharmacological  drugs 
when these treatments had not been changed in the last 
4–12 weeks, and 31.3% of the patients stated that they 
were taking medication during the trial. In the 22 stud-
ies  giving  details  on  education  level  of  participants,  a 
high percentage had an academic background (63.0%).

We compared the age of the participants in the stud-
ies  with  a  database  on  the  average  age  of  participants 
in  832  clinical  studies  [13].  The  mean  age  (PDA:  38.6, 
GAD 38.2; SAD 35.7) in the evaluated studies was simi-
lar  to  the  typical  age  of  participants  calculated  in  this 
database (PDA: 37.2, GAD 40.7; SAD 35.2).

In  order  to  find  out  whether  the  participants 
recruited  for  the  IPI  studies  were  less  severely  ill  than 
those included in average clinical studies, we compared 
the  baseline  severity  scores  with  the  ones  obtained  in 
our  first  meta-analysis.  For  SAD,  the  weighted  average 
baseline  score  of  the  Liebowitz  Anxiety  Scale  (LSAS) 
of  the  IPIs  was  72.7 ± 21.9,  which  was  significantly 
lower  than  the  baseline  scores  in  average  drug  studies 
(84.0 ± 8.3; df = 79; t = 50.2; p < 0.0001). There was only 
a trend for lower severity in comparison to F2F psycho-
therapy studies (73.2 ± 11.0; t = 1.5,  p = 0.07). For PDA 
and  GAD,  we  did  not  have  sufficient  data  to  compare 
the baseline values with the same scale.

In  only  one  of  the  studies  it  was  mentioned  that  the 
participants  were  provided  with  an  emergency  tel-
ephone  number  in  case  of  emerging  serious  mental 
problems, e.g. suicidal ideas.

Sample sizes

Average  sample  sizes  of  IPIs  are  significantly  larger 
(41.5 ± 28.3 per study arm; n = 97) than in the F2F stud-
ies  in  our  previous  meta-analysis  (29.7 ± 25.5;  n = 175; 
p < 0.0001).

Study quality

The number of 38 CONSORT quality indicators not ful-
filled ranged from 2 to 13, with an average of 4.4 ± 2.1 
per  study.  The  most  frequent  violations  of  CONSORT 
items  were:  no  adequate  blinding  (97.4%),  no  report 
of  adverse  effects  or  harms  (92.3%),  missing  power 
calculation  or  sample  size  too  small  for  non-inferior-
ity  trial  (59.0%),  lack  of  generalizability  (53.8%),  no  a 
priori  trial  registration  46.2%,  randomization  method 
not  described  adequately  (20.5%),  no  primary  efficacy 
measure defined (10.3%), funding not reported (10.3%), 
and no intent-to-treat evaluation (5.1%).

Allegiance effects

As  all  studies  were  conducted  by  work  groups  that 
support  the  use  of  IPIs,  we  could  not  perform  a  com-
parison of the effect sizes of studies conducted by “sup-
porters” vs. studies from independent work groups.

Publication bias

There was evidence for publication bias in studies com-
paring  IPI  and  iCBT  vs.  waitlist  in  the  sense  of  “small 
study effects”. However, this would lead only to a mini-
mal adjustment according to Duval and Tweedie’s trim 
and fill method of the ES difference of iCBT vs. waitlist 
from d = 1.12 to 1.11.

Discussion
During the Covid-19 pandemic, psychological therapies 
delivered  via  internet  (IPI)  may  become  increasingly 
more  important,  as  personal  contact  or  travel  can  be 
avoided. Moreover, IPIs have the advantage to be much 
less expensive, can be done at any time of the day and 
are not dependent of local availability of therapists.

In  the  present  meta-analysis,  IPIs  were  significantly 
superior to waitlist controls. However, a waitlist control 
is an easy target to beat. Even treatments that are signif-
icantly less effective than a pill placebo or a psychologi-
cal  placebo  would  pass  this  test,  as  waitlist  conditions 
yield  only  very  small  average  ES  of  around  d = 0.2  [4]. 
They  have  been  shown  to  be  even  less  effective  than  a 
no-treatment condition [14], as those participants allo-
cated  to  waitlist  may  be  motivated  to  overstress  their 
illness  symptoms  at  the  end  of  the  waiting  period,  for 
having  a  justification  that  they  can  receive  their  origi-
nally  desired  therapy.  Moreover,  patients  may  be

demoralized  during  the  waiting  period  because  they 
have consented not to start any other treatments. Being 
allocated  to  a  waitlist  could  be  therefore  regarded  a 
“nocebo”  condition.  Moreover,  when  a  psychologi-
cal treatment is superior to a waitlist control, this only 
shows that there is some unspecific effect but does not 
provide  information  whether  the  treatment  has  spe-
cific  psychotherapy  effects  characteristic  for  a  certain 

technique.  Therefore,  the  scientific  value  of  waitlist-
controlled RCTs is limited.

The  more  important  question  is  how  IPIs  perform 
relative  to  F2F-CBT  and  other  alternative  treatments. 
In  the  7  available  direct  comparisons  of  iCBT  and  F2F-
CBT,  no  significant  difference  was  found.  The  results 
may  be  less  reliable  due  to  the  low  number  of  direct 
comparisons.  Moreover,  as  all  these  7  comparisons 

Bandelow and Wedekind  BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:441 

Page 7 of 9

were  done  by  research  teams  promoting  iCBT,  these 
results  may  be  biased  by  allegiance  effects.  In  contrast 
to an earlier meta-analysis which also did not find a dif-
ference  between  IPI  and  F2F-CBT  [15],  we  were  able  to 
compare  iCBT  with  a  much  larger  number  of  F2F-CBT 
studies  (n = 93)  by  using  the  pre-post  ES,  and  found  a 
significant  difference  in  favor  of  personal  interventions. 
However,  this  difference  of  d = 0.09  was  so  small  that  it 
might hardly be noticeable by the patient. As findings in 
psychotherapy research suggest that unspecific therapist 
effects  in  psychotherapy,  like  life  experience,  empathy, 
warmth,  positive  regard,  therapeutic  alliance,  transfer-
ence, or clinical experience have an important influence 
on  the  outcome  of  treatment  [16],  a  much  larger  differ-
ence should have been expected. In meta-analyses, small 
but  significant  correlations  have  been  found  between 
patients’  expectations  perception  of  treatment  credibil-
ity,  therapeutic  alliance  and  outcome  alliance  [17–19]. 
Also, therapists with a degree in psychology or medicine, 
many  years  of  psychotherapeutic  education  and  clinical 
experience should perform much better than a computer 
program accompanied by short E-mails from psychology 
students. Notably, the treatment duration in the IPIs was 
only 9.3 weeks on average, while F2F psychotherapy stud-
ies have a mean duration of 12.4 weeks, according to our 
first meta-analysis.

However, these results have to be interpreted with cau-
tion because there are reasons to assume that the efficacy 
of  IPIs  may  have  been  overestimated  in  the  evaluated 
studies.

–  With the exception of one study, the main outcomes 
of  the  studies  were  not  blinded,  as  they  were  based 
on  self-report  questionnaires  and  the  patients  knew 
that  they  were  in  the  active  treatment  condition. 
It  was  reported  that  ES  were  exaggerated  by  68%  in 
unblinded psychotherapy studies [20].

–  Most  of  the  studies  allowed  ongoing  psychophar-
macological treatments, and around 30% of the par-
ticipants  were  on  continuing  drug  treatment  during 
the study. Therefore, the calculated pre-post ES were 
actually  a  sum  of  psychological  and  psychopharma-
cological effects in a substantial number of patients. 
However,  this  also  applies  to  average  studies  con-
ducted with F2F psychotherapy.

–  The  IPI  studies  included  patients  who  may  be  more 
prone  to  respond  than  average  anxiety  patients,  as 
most  of  the  study  participants  had  been  recruited 
from nonclinical settings, two thirds had an academic 
background, and familiarity with the use of comput-
ers is required for this special treatment modality. A 
meta-analysis  found  that  in  open  recruitment  stud-

ies in which participants referred themselves, the ESs 
were  higher  than  in  studies  in  which  patients  were 
recruited  from  clinical  settings  [15].  We  found  that 
the baseline scale scores in SAD patients in the IPIs 
were  significantly  lower  than  the  scores  in  average 
medication  studies  but  did  not  differ  from  the  aver-
age baseline scores in F2F psychotherapy studies.
–  Allegiance effects cannot be excluded in all included 
IPI studies. In our previous meta-analysis, we found 
possible  allegiance  effects  in  32.6%  of  the  F2F  psy-
chotherapy studies.

In  the  few  studies  comparing  high  and  low  intensity 
of  therapist  contact  it  was  found  that  the  more  patient-
therapist  interaction  (e.g.  via  E-mail  or  telephone)  was 
involved, the higher were the ES.

If  participants  applying  for  IPIs  were  substantially 
younger than average patients in F2F studies, this would 
affect  the  generalizability  of  the  findings.  However,  we 
found that the mean age of treated subjects was similar to 
average clinical studies with these disorders.

Average  sample  sizes  of  IPIs  are  significantly  larger 
than  in  typical  F2F  studies,  perhaps  because  recruiting 
participants  for  IPIs  is  less  complex  and  expensive  than 
for F2F studies. Thus, the reliability of the results is larger 
than in average psychotherapy studies.

The average adherence in the studies was 69.3%, which 
is in the normal range of most clinical studies. As a rule 
of  thumb,  one  third  of  the  participants  drop  out  in  any 
study  of  psychiatric  or  psychological  treatments.  How-
ever, in a systematic review of IPIs, the percentage of par-
ticipants adhering to the programs varied widely between 
7.8–75.0%  [21].  In  routine  application  of  IPIs,  attrition 
rates may be even higher. In an observational study of a 
freely  available  Web-based  intervention,  an  extremely 
high  attrition  rate  was  found,  with  only  1%  out  of  1161 
of registered users completing the 12-week program [22].

Limitations

We  did  not  look  at  the  results  of  follow-up  assessments 
because we had found in a meta-analysis that long-lasting 
treatment  effects  observed  after  the  original  treatment 
was  stopped  may  be  superimposed  by  effects  of  spon-
taneous  remission  or  regression  to  the  mean  and  are 
therefore  unreliable  [7].  In  RCTs  involving  only  a  wait-
list  control,  a  control  group  is  lacking  in  the  follow-up 
period.

The results with IPI studies using Psychodynamic Ther-
apy, Applied Relaxation (AR) and Interpersonal Therapy 
are only preliminary because they are only based on 1 to 
2 studies which included very few participants.

Table 5  Internet-delivered psychotherapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders: proposal for standards

- Diagnoses should be made by psychiatrists or psychologists in personal contact

- Contact persons on the “other end” should have a degree in medicine or psychology and should have a completed (or almost-completed) training in 
psychotherapy

- Therapist contact with participants via E-mail, telephone or videoconferencing should be at least 15 min per week

- Program modules should be based on scientific findings on the effective ingredients of psychotherapy and should be developed by experienced 
psychotherapists

- Patients should be informed about alternative treatments that might yield higher ES, e.g. face-to-face CBT or medications

- E-mail and videoconferencing services must be encrypted

- Participants should be provided with a 24-h emergency telephone number in case of severe mental problems, e.g. suicidal ideas

AR  is  seen  as  a  legitimate  psychotherapy  by  some 
authors (e.g. [23], while it was considered a less effective 
control  condition  in  RCTs  (e.g.  [24])  or  meta-analyses 
[25, 26]. It is often used as component in CBT programs. 
A  meta-analysis  contrasting  AR  with  CBT  without  AR 
did not find a difference in efficacy [27].

A  limitation  is  that  the  meta-analysis  was  not  pre-
registered,  as  according  to  current  quality  standards 
preregistrations are recommended [28].

While  the  screening  and  evaluation  of  the  studies 
was  done  by  two  independent  raters,  the  electronic 
search  was  only  done  by  on  investigator.  However, 
according  to  recommended  standards,  [28],  also  the 
search should be done independently.

Proposal for standards

IPIs  may  be  a  useful  tool  when  personal  psychother-
apy is not easily available, or as an add-on to standard 
psychotherapeutic  or  psychopharmacological  treat-
ments.  On  average,  therapist  time  can  be  reduced  to 
approximately  one  quarter  of  what  is  needed  for  F2F 
psychotherapy.

Based on our review, we have formulated a proposal 
for the standards for psychological interventions deliv-
ered via internet (Table 5).

For future studies on IPIs, we propose:

–  Studies  should  be  conducted  with  representative 
samples, e.g. they should not be restricted to popula-
tions with a preponderance of participants with aca-
demic background.

–  In  order  to  examine  the  true  effects  of  IPIs,  studies 
should be conducted with medication-free patients.
–  Study assessments should be done by raters blind to 
treatment  allocation  in  order  to  minimize  expecta-
tion effects.

–  IPS should not only be compared to waitlist controls 
but  also  to  psychological  placebos.  Our  meta-anal-
yses  showed  that  IPIs  do  differ  from  psychological 

placebos  in  the  indirect  comparison.  However,  psy-
chological  placebos  that  can  be  applied  as  internet 
application have yet to be developed.

Conclusion
When  compared  to  face-to-face  psychotherapy  IPIs 
showed comparable ES. However, there are some reasons 
to assume that the ES of IPIs in the available studies are 
overestimated.

IPIs  may  be  a  useful  tool  when  face-to-face  psycho-
therapy is not easily available, or as an add-on to standard 
treatments but should perhaps not be used as monother-
apy. We have proposed standards for future research and 
the practical use of IPIs.
