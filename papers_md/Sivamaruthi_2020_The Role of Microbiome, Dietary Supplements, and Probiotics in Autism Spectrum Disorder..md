Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder characterized
by the impairment of the cognitive function of a child. Studies suggested that the intestinal microbiota
has a critical role in the function and regulation of the central nervous system, neuroimmune
system and neuroendocrine system. Any adverse changes in the gut–brain axis may cause serious
disease. Food preferences and dietary patterns are considered as key in inﬂuencing the factors
of ASD development. Several recent reviews narrated the importance of dietary composition on
controlling or reducing the ASD symptoms. It has been known that the consumption of probiotics
confers several health beneﬁts by positive amendment of gut microbiota. The inﬂuence of probiotic
intervention in children with ASD has also been reported and it has been considered as an alternative
and complementary therapeutic supplement for ASD. The present manuscript discusses the role
of microbiota and diet in the development of ASD. It also summarizes the recent updates on
the inﬂuence of dietary supplements and the beneﬁcial eﬀect of probiotics on ASD symptoms.
An in-depth literature survey suggested that the maternal diet and lifestyle are greatly associated
with the development of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Mounting evidences have
conﬁrmed the alteration in the gut microbial composition in children suﬀering from ASD. However,
the unique proﬁle of microbiome has not yet been fully characterized due to the heterogeneity of
patients. The supplementation of probiotics amended the symptoms associated with ASD but the
results are inconclusive. The current study recommends further detailed research considering the
role of microbiome, diet and probiotics in the development and control of ASD.

1. Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the serious neurodevelopmental disorders characterized
by the impairment of the interactive and social communication ability of a child and the repetitive speciﬁc
patterns of activities, behaviors (self-injuring activities), abnormal sensitivity and gastrointestinal (GI)
diﬃculties [1,2]. The incidence of ASD has increased rapidly in the last decade. In spite of several
extensive studies, the mechanisms and etiology of ASD have not been clearly explained, but some
of the environmental factors such as viral infection, metabolic disparities and the exposure to toxins,
diet, genetic and postnatal factors and microbiome have been associated with the etiology of ASD.
There are no eﬀective and accorded therapies available for ASD [3–7].

Several recent studies revealed that the intestinal microbiota has a critical role in the function
and regulation of the central nervous system, neuroimmune system and neuroendocrine system.
Any adverse changes in the gut–brain axis may cause serious diseases such as autoimmune
disorders [8,9]. The GI symptoms are associated with several diseases and disorders [10] and
about 12% of ASD patients are suﬀering from GI symptoms [6], which are closely correlated with the
unique microbial composition of ASD patients compared to healthy individuals [11].

Food preferences and dietary patterns are also considered as one of the key inﬂuencing factors of
ASD development. Several recent reviews narrated the importance of dietary composition on controlling
or reducing the ASD symptoms [7,12,13]. The quality in terms of nutritional value and quantity of
the food signiﬁcantly alters the microbial composition of the host GI system. The consumption of
speciﬁc food(s), which is often observed among the ASD patients, aﬀects the microbiota (supports the
nourishment of a particular group of microbes).

Several studies proved that the probiotics (a group of live microbes that confers health beneﬁts
upon being consuming in an adequate amount) supplementation confers several health beneﬁts by the
positive amendment of gut microbiota [14–17]. The inﬂuence of probiotic intervention in ASD patients
has also been reported and considered as an alternative and complementary therapeutic supplement
for ASD [7,13].

This review preparation was carried out by collecting related scientiﬁc information from Scopus,
PubMed, Google Scholar and ASD-related databases using the keywords “autism” “autism and
probiotics” and “autism and microbiota”. The relevant papers published in English were selected for
the preparation of the manuscript without any chronological restrictions. The current manuscript
narrates the updated information about the role of microbiome and diet in the development of
ASD. This manuscript also explains the beneﬁcial eﬀect of dietary supplements and probiotics in the
improvement of ASD symptoms. This review highlights that probiotics can be used as an adjuvant
therapeutic agent and with added nutritious support (dietary supplements) but suggests that still more
detailed studies are required to develop more eﬃcient therapeutic methods to improve the quality of
life of the ASD children.

2. Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized
by the impairment of the social interaction and communication skills with rigid and repetitive behaviors.
Autism aﬀects both children and adults, based on severity and intellectual ability; they may either lead
a normal life or suﬀer a devastating disability requiring institutional care [18]. Distinctive symptoms
of ASD are deﬁcit in social behaviors and nonverbal interactions such as the avoidance of eye contact,
inability to control emotion or understand the emotions of others, facial expression and body gestures
in the ﬁrst three years of life. Paul Eugen Bleuler is a swiss psychiatrist that coined the term “autism”
(Greek word “autos” means “self”) for group of symptoms related to schizophrenia, while Hans
Asperger and Leo Kanner designed the modern study of autism. An epidemiological survey revealed
that ASD is the most prevalent non immune mediated CNS disorder with an incidence rate of 1 ASD
per 500 children aged eight years, with a higher incidence in boys (23.6 per 1000) when compared to
girls (5.3 per 1000) [19]. ASD-aﬀected individuals exhibit unusual ways of learning and reactions to
sensation. ASD is a multifactorial disorder caused by the interaction of both genetic and non-genetic
risk factors.

2.1. Etiological Factors Leading to Autism

Mounting evidences revealed that de novo mutations, copy number variations, rare and common
variants are major genetic factors leading to ASD. Around 50% of ASDs are hereditary caused due to
defects in the gene and chromosomal abnormalities leading to disruption in the neuronal connection,
brain growth and synaptic morphology [20–23]. Siblings born in families with ASD have a 50%
enhanced risk of ASD with a reoccurrence rate of 5%–8%. In monozygotic twins, the concordance rate is

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

3 of 16

90%, while in dizygotic twins the rate of incidence is 10% [24]. Genetic studies revealed that a mutation
in the single gene involved in synaptogenesis alters the developmental pathways of neuronal and
axonal structures. The fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, hyper excitability of neocortical circuits
and abnormal neural synchronization were considered as probable disorders leading to ASD [25,26].
In-depth genomic studies revealed that the chromosomes 2q, 7q, 15q and 16p have genes susceptible for
ASD that have not yet been completely studied [27]. Inborn metabolic errors such as phenylketonuria,
creatine deﬁciency syndromes, adenylosuccinate lyase deﬁciency and metabolic purine disorders
account for 5% of ASD incidence. Recent reports revealed that the gene ENGRAILED 2 mainly involved
in cerebellar developmental patterning, GABA system genes and serotonin transporter genes, has been
considered to be associated with ASD [28].

Non-predisposed factors such as exposure to environmental factors and pharmaceutical drugs,
autoimmune disorder, microbial infection and diet during the prenatal and postnatal periods cause
gut dysbiosis and immune dysregulation together contributing to ASD (Figure 1). Recent research
revealed that the severity of ASD depends on the complex interaction of genetic susceptibility and
environmental factors, so unraveling this relationship will help in identifying a treatment strategy for
ASD [29,30].

2.2. Link between Gut Microbiome and ASD

2.2.1. Role of Gut Microbiota in Human Nutrition and Health

Gut–brain cross talk involves a complex communication system involved in the proper maintenance
of GI homeostasis, which is termed as the gut–brain axis (GBA). The GBA is a bidirectional
communication network between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system

In-depth genomic studies revealed that the chromosomes 2q, 7q, 15q and 16p have genes susceptible for ASD that have not yet been completely studied [27].

Role of Gut Microbiota in Human Nutrition and Health Gut–brain cross talk involves a complex communication system involved in the proper maintenance of GI homeostasis, which is termed as the gut–brain axis (GBA). The GBA is a bidirectional communication network between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system linking the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions via neuro–immuno–endocrinal mediators [31]. The bidirectional communication network of the GBA involves the brain and spinal cord of the CNS, autonomous nervous system (ANS), the enteric nervous system (ENS) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA). Sympathetic and parasympathetic limbs of ANS transmit the afferent signals from the lumen to the CNS through the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

linking the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions via
neuro–immuno–endocrinal mediators [31]. The bidirectional communication network of the GBA
involves the brain and spinal cord of the CNS, autonomous nervous system (ANS), the enteric nervous
system (ENS) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA). Sympathetic and parasympathetic limbs
of ANS transmit the aﬀerent signals from the lumen to the CNS through the enteric, spinal and vagal
pathways and eﬀerent signals from the CNS to the intestinal wall [32]. The HPA axis is the core
stress eﬀerent axis, which adapts the organism to various stresses and is part of the limbic system
involved in memory and emotional response. On exposure to stresses such as environmental factors
and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, the HPA axis activates the release of the corticotrophin release factor
(CRF) from the hypothalamus, stimulating the secretion of the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)
from the pituitary gland, which in turn activates the adrenal gland to release the stress hormone
cortisol aﬀecting various organs including the brain. Hence, both neuronal and hormonal interactions
play a vital role in inﬂuencing the activities of intestinal functional eﬀector cells, such as immune cells,
epithelial cells, enteric neurons, smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells of cajal and enterochromaﬃn
cells which in turn are under the control of gut microbiota via brain–gut reciprocal communication [33].
Moreover, the epithelial cell lining of the GI tract and its motility, which is controlled by the CNS,
inﬂuences the composition of gut microbiome. Hence, any dysregulation in the CNS alters the
intestinal microbiota leading to pathological consequences and gut microbial dysbiosis which aﬀects
the development and regulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) and behavior.
This bidirectional relationship of gut microbiome with the host brain axis is termed as microbial
endocrinology or inter-kingdom signaling [34].

Gut microbiota interacts with the brain through endocrine and neurocrine pathways, while the
brain inﬂuences the microbial composition through the autonomic nervous system with the active
involvement of the immune and humoral systems. Gut microbiome modulates the brain by inﬂuencing
the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and
the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via short chain fatty acid, tryptophan metabolites,
secondary bile acids and ketones thereby inﬂuencing memory and learning processes. These molecules
transmit signals by interacting with the farnesoid receptor (FXR) and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor
(TGR5) in the enteroendocrine cells (EEC), releasing ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF19), which readily
crosses the blood–brain barrier and regulates the secretion of neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus,
thereby regulating the glucose metabolism via the release of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) [35–37].
The release of serotonin (5 hydroxy tryptamine-5HT) by enterochromaﬃn cells (ECC), triggered by
the stimuli from eﬀerent neurons of the CNS based on the availability of the dietary tryptophan level,
which in turn is controlled by gut microbiome, represents the bidirectional gut microbiome–brain
axis [38]. Certain microbially-derived molecules escape the intestinal barrier, reach the brain directly
by crossing the blood–brain barrier via systemic circulation and propagate the signal on interaction
with the FXR and TGR5 expressed in brain neurons [39].

In addition, the secretion of biologically active peptide by enteroendocrine cells, mainly involved
in GBA interaction, is controlled by the nutritional level of microbiota. SCFA acts as the major signaling
molecule mediating the gut microbiome–brain communication, via EEC and ECC. The brain inﬂuences
the microbial population through several stresses: by altering the size and quality of the mucus secretion,
by slowing the recovery of the migratory motor complex pattern, by the induction a transient delaying
of gastric emptying, and by enhancing the frequency of cecocolonic spike burst activity, which aﬀect
the GI transit modulating the nutrient supply to enteric microbiota. Diﬀerent psychological stressors
in adults and newborns modulate the composition and biomass of enteric microbiota [40] (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Gut microbiome–brain axis: bidirectional signaling pathways illustrating the relationship
between the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier and the brain. Gut microbiota communicates with the
brain through the neuro–endocrine–immune network either indirectly via the gut-derived molecules
acting on aﬀerent vagal nerve endings, or directly via the microbe-generated signals. The brain’s
structural connections (the multiple interconnected structural networks of the central nervous system)
regulates the gut microbiota via the autonomic nervous system. Disturbance in the bidirectional
interaction response gain is due to psychosocial or gut-derived stress manifests to brain–gut disorders.

2.2.2. Link between Gut Microbiome and ASD

Gut microbiota, which is non-genetic and inheritable, has a great impact on immune, metabolic and
neuronal developments. As gut microbiota is a notable contributor for human health, gut microbial
dysbiosis leads to negative consequences such as GI-tract-related disorders such as Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis, systemic diseases such as metabolomic disorders and CNS-related disorders [41].
Noticeable evidences illustrated that ASD patients in addition to psychiatric disorders were found
to be associated with an extremely painful GI disease termed as autistic enterocolitis or other GI
discomforts such as constipation, diarrhea and bloating. This hypothesis leads to fact that microbial
imbalance aﬀects the co-ordination of the microbiota-gut–brain axis in human health leading to several
neurological disorders which turned the focus of the researcher towards gut microbiota.

Wakeﬁeld and colleagues reported the incidence of a new variant inﬂammatory bowel disease
(autistic enterocolitis), which is characterized by chronic patchy inﬂammation and lymph nodular
hyperplasia in the ileum or colon of individuals with ASD [42]. Scientiﬁc evidences also illustrated
the relationship between ASD patients and gut microbiome, which has a direct/indirect inﬂuence
over the feeding pattern and nutrition [43]. Investigation has shown that children with autism suﬀer
from intestinal dysbiosis characterized by the imbalance between beneﬁcial microbes and pathogenic
microbes residing in the gut. Neurotoxic and cytotoxic molecules, such as opioid peptides, produced by
these pathogenic bacteria enter the blood stream due to leaky gut, thereby activating the immune
mechanism causing tissue damage and GI inﬂammation. In addition, these toxic molecules aﬀect
the neurotransmitter function in the brain, leading to abnormalities in behavioral patterns such as

This hypothesis leads to fact that microbial imbalance affects the co-ordination of the microbiota-gut–brain axis in human health leading to several neurological disorders which turned the focus of the researcher towards gut microbiota.  Wakefield and colleagues reported the incidence of a new variant inflammatory bowel disease (autistic enterocolitis), which is characterized by chronic patchy inflammation and lymph nodular hyperplasia in the ileum or colon of individuals with ASD [42].

In addition, these toxic molecules affect the Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

decreased socialization, decreased response to pain, abnormal language and self-abusive or repetitive
behaviors, resulting in confusion, delirium and even coma [32]. In ASD-vulnerable children, yeast also
produces abundant chemicals leading to neurological eﬀects.

The metagenomic analysis of ASD-gut-microbiome showed mucosal dysbiosis with a low
level of Bacteriodetes and an increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes. Pyrosequencing of fetal
microﬂora in the fecal stools of autistic children showed a high prevalence of Desulfovibrio species
and Bacteroides vulgatus when compared to healthy volunteers [44]. The 16S r DNA sequencing of
gut microbiome, isolated from late onset autism patients, showed a high incidence of Clostridium
and Ruminococcus species, while a real-time PCR analysis showed a rich source of Clostridium cluster
groups I and XI and Clostridium bolteae [45]. Culture-independent ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization
studies revealed the elevated level of Clostridium hystolyticum in the ASD children compared to healthy
children [46]. The accumulation of neurotoxin-producing bacteria such as Clostridia worsens the
autistic symptom. Another study on the gut microbial composition of autistic children revealed a low
level of Biﬁdobacterium and Enterococcus and an increased level of Lactobacillus strains, despite being
beneﬁcial, which is quite paradoxical. Commensal bacteria such as Bacillus spp. and Klebsiella oxytoca,
that are neither harmful nor beneﬁcial, were reported to be present in autistic children [47]. A pilot
study by Kang et al. [48] reported the presence of low-level carbohydrate degrading/fermenting
bacteria such as Prevotella, Coprococcus and Veillonellaceae in ASD, substantiating the link between gut
microbiome and ASD. Pyrosequencing results showed the altered gut microbial diversity in autistic
children with a relatively high abundance of Caloramator, Sarcina and Clostridium genera, Alistipes
and Akkermansia species, Sutterellaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and low level of Prevotella, Coprococcus
and unclassiﬁed Veillonellaceae, concomitantly associated with the altered level of free amino acids
and volatile organic compounds in fecal samples compared to the control samples [49]. The above
reports illustrate altered gut microbiota in patients suﬀering from autism, when compared to healthy
volunteers, which shows the direct/indirect relationship of gut microbiome with autism.

2.2.3. Microbial Metabolites Interrelated with ASD

The metabolites produced by gut microbiome aﬀect the neural process based on their level.
Metabolomic studies in urine, fecal and serum samples of ASD patients using LC-MS and GC-MS
revealed an enhanced level of microbial metabolites, such as increased levels of SCFAs, para-cresol and
ammonia, which aﬀect the neural process [50,51]. SCFA is the double edged sword that plays a vital
role in human health and disease. SCFA is considered as a major trigger factor for ASD. Propionic acid,
the widely used preservative in the food industry, is also one of the SCFAs produced by ASD-associated
bacteria, such as Clostridium, Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio. Experimental studies with rodents treated
with propionic acid exhibited ASD-associated symptoms, such as impaired and restricted social
behavior and cognition, together with an enhanced neuro-inﬂammatory response, which might be
due to alteration in mitochondrial function or the epigenetic modulation of ASD-associated genes [52].
The elevated level of another microbial metabolite para-cresol (p-cresol) and its conjugate p-cresylsulfate
were observed in the urinary samples of children aﬀected by autism. The increased level of p-cresol,
derived either from the environment or gut microbiome, aggravates the ASD severity by inhibiting
the neurotransmitters associated with enzymes and cofactors required for sulfonation reaction in the
liver [53].

Urinary metabolomic research in ASD children revealed the presence of an abnormal level of
common microbial metabolites such as dimethylamine, hippuric and phenylacetylglutamine and
altered tryptophan, when compared to healthy children [54,55]. The increased level of tyrosine analogue
3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionic acid (HPHPA), reported in the urine samples of autistic
patients, might be responsible for the catecholamine depletion, worsening autistic symptoms such as
stereotypical behavior, hyperactivity and hyper-reactivity [56]. Serum metabolomic studies depicted
the presence of 11 metabolites in abnormal level among which, the level of sphingosine 1-phosphate
and docosahexaenoic acid were consistent in all models [57]. The abnormal gut microbiome-associated

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

7 of 16

metabolites in ASD patients revealed an altered metabolism leading to the aberrant increase in
metabolites, worsening the symptoms of ASD.

2.2.4. Gut Microbiome-Associated Immune Deregulation

Several studies in human and animal models of ASD revealed the presence of an enhanced level
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, brain-speciﬁc auto-antibodies in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and serum,
illustrating an elevated immune response substantiating the fact that immune dysregulation acts
as a key factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ASD [58,59]. Further autopsy of the brain
specimens of ASD patients showed the presence of activated microglial cells, together with an increased
level of cytokine, such as interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
and chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL)-2 [60,61]. Elevated cytokines and chemokines were related
to aberrant stereotypical behavior and cognitive impairment. In the newborn infants, the immune
system development and homeostasis are regulated by the maternal gut microbiome colonizing the
fetal gut. Multiple evidences revealed that the immune dysregulation in ASD is associated with gut
microbiota [62]. Certain species of gut microbiota regulate the T lymphocyte diﬀerentiation, while few
microbes, such as Bacteroides fragilis colonization, restrict T helper cell response eliciting an autoimmune
disorder [63]. Although several studies reported that impairment of the immune system in ASD is
linked with gut microbiome, the mechanism behind it is not clearly known.

2.2.5. Maternal Risk Factors Regulating Gut Microbiome

Epidemiological and experimental studies revealed a strong linkage between maternal infection
and the development of ASD in the oﬀspring. The gut microbial composition of a newborn infant
varies with respect to the mode of delivery primarily colonized by the maternal microbiota. Hence,
any imbalance in maternal microbiome with respect to environmental stress or genetic risk will be
transferred to the oﬀspring at the time of birth [64,65]. Scientiﬁc evidences revealed that a maternal
high-fat diet and exposure to stress during the gestation period increases the risk of neurodevelopment
and behavioral disorders in oﬀspring [66]. Maternal immune activation studies using animal models
exposed to poly (I:C) during the prenatal stage revealed a change in gut microbiome, leading to lifelong
neuropathology and altered behaviors in the oﬀspring [67–69]. Based on the reports, it is clear that
maternal risk factors increase the incidence of ASD in the oﬀspring by multiple pathways, such as the
altered modulation of the placenta, epigenetic modiﬁcation and immune dysregulation.

3. Diet and ASD

Studies strongly showed that the maternal diet plays a critical role in the ASD development in
their oﬀspring [70,71]. Generally, the consumption of suﬃcient amounts of folic acids and vitamins
during pregnancy are greatly associated with the decreased risk of ASD [72,73]. A maternal high-fat
diet is associated with the high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD [12,66,70].

3.1. Recommended Food Supplements for ASD Children

Individuals with ASD have a serious problem in their nutrition due to the stringent food selection,
defects in food digestion and absorption. Children with ASD show high selectivity towards food
containing starch, snacks and processed food, but deny fruits, vegetables and proteins [43]. It is known
that most autistic children are underweight due to a lack of dietary ﬁbers, vitamins, calcium, iron and
potassium [74]. Studies also revealed that the nutritional supplementation to ASD children that exceeds
their daily need of protein, carbohydrates and fats leads to GI problems and obesity [75,76].

Ketogenic diets (KD) that are rich in fat (65–90%) are the common choice to manage the ASD.
Several studies revealed some of the favorable impacts of KD on the behavior and symptoms of ASD
in human and animal models [77–79]. However, several issues must be considered before using
KD for treating the condition of ASD in human, such as GI-associated conﬂicts, food selectivity,
low tolerance level of the food and nutrient deﬁciency due to low consumption [80,81]. Other than KD,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

8 of 16

several nutritional supplements such as omega-3-fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants are
believed to exhibit favorable eﬀects on ASD.

Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3) are generally used as a food supplement and considered as a potent
complementary and alternative therapeutic agent for ASD [82]. Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are necessary for the
normal brain and visual development and function and regulation of behavior and mood [83].
The defective metabolism of PUFAs has been observed in ASD children, which was associated with an
increase in inﬂammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and the malfunctioning of neurotransmitters [84].
A low level of ω-3, altered ω-3 and ω-6 ratio have been detected in ASD children compared to that
of the normal children [85]. Clinical studies based on the impact of the supplementation of ω-3
on the health status of ASD children showed no promising beneﬁcial eﬀect and was found to be
controversial [86–88]. Despite that some of the ASD-associated symptoms were improved by the
ω-3 supplementation, further detailed studies with increased sample size and proper follow-up are
required to establish strong evidence for the beneﬁcial eﬀect of ω-3 on ASD [89].

Oxidative stress is one of the factors associated with the etiology of ASD and the defect in
the antioxidant system may aﬀect the brain function and disturb the immune system [90–92].
The supplementation of antioxidants (such as vitamins, ﬂavonoids) ameliorates symptoms of
ASD [93,94], but the evidence is not enough to recommend an antioxidant-based therapeutic practice
for ASD.

Several studies have been reported based on the role of the supplementation of minerals
and multi-vitamins in improving the symptoms of ASD [95–97]. However, additional studies are
required [98] to develop minerals and vitamins-based supplementation for the betterment of the
symptoms of ASD.

Other food supplements such as fermentable saccharides and a polyols diet are also believed to
have a protective eﬀect on ASD. However, scientiﬁc evidence is lacking to support the aforementioned
statement. Due to calcium deﬁciency, ASD children suﬀer from defective intestinal permeability,
which roots for several GI-associated diseases and discomforts. In addition, the evidence to support
the beneﬁcial eﬀects of the Feingold diet (without any artiﬁcial ﬂavors, colors and food additives) is
not suﬃcient. The results of the previous studies claimed that further extended research is essential
before recommending any kind of food-based alternative therapy for ASD [7].

3.2. Elimination Foods of ASD

The exclusion of some of the food materials is also signiﬁcantly considered to improve the ASD
and/or to prevent the worsening of the ASD. A gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet is considered
as one of the eﬀective food-based alternative treatments for ASD since the peptides derived from
gluten and casein can trigger inﬂammation [99,100]. Although studies claimed that the GFCF diet has
a positive impact on the health status of ASD patients [101,102], the results are questionable due to
the lack of proper methodology, follow-ups, small sample size and most of the data being collected
from the parents of ASD children. Some of the studies showed that a GFCF diet does not inﬂuence
ASD symptoms [103,104]. Hyman et al. [105] reported that speciﬁc dietary supplementation had
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the symptoms of ASD, whereas a randomized controlled study conducted
by Ghalichi et al. [106] suggested that a gluten-free diet had a positive impact on the GI health and
behaviors of ASD children. Apart from health beneﬁts, though the results are inconsistent, GFCF diet
plans showed some serious side eﬀects due to the lack of calcium and deﬁciency in essential amino
acids, which may cause reduced bone density and frequent bone fractures [107,108].

Recent evidences showed that a high-fat diet (diﬀered from KD; a complex of high fat,
suﬃcient amount of protein and low carbohydrate food) aﬀects the dopamine system (such as decreasing
the signaling and dysfunction) and causes some of the ASD-associated behavioral changes [109–111].

4. Inﬂuence of Probiotic Supplementation on the Health Status of Individuals with ASD

Parracho et al. [112] conducted a placebo controlled, double blind, crossover-designed feeding
trial (12 week study duration; one group subjected to three weeks of placebo treatment followed by
three weeks of washout period and followed by probiotic treatment for three weeks then three weeks
of washout period; another group subjected to three weeks of probiotic treatment followed by three
weeks of washout period and then with placebo treatment for three weeks, followed by three weeks of
washout period) and studied the beneﬁcial eﬀect of probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum WCSF1
on the gut microbiota, gut function and the behavior of the children with ASD. Supplementation of
L. plantarum WCSF1 (4.5 × 1010 CFU per day) to the ASD children (4 to 16 years old) signiﬁcantly
altered the fecal microbiota, a notable level of increase was observed in enterococci and lactobacilli
group and a reduction was observed in Clostridium cluster XIVa. Bowel function was improved during
the probiotic intake compared to the placebo feeding. The GI symptoms, such as intestinal bloating,
abdominal pain and ﬂatulence, were found not to be signiﬁcantly altered, but stool consistency was
observed to be improved signiﬁcantly during the probiotic feeding compared to that of the placebo
treatment. The behavioral scores assessed using the Development Behavior Checklist questionnaire
were found to be improved during the probiotic feeding compared to baseline. The study suggested
that the supplementation of WCSF1 amended the microbiota and behavior of ASD children [112].

Tomova et al. [113] investigated the GI microbiota in children with ASD, their siblings and
neurotypical children (control) in Slovakia and also studied the changes in the fecal microbiota,
plasma hormone and cytokine levels after probiotic intervention in ASD children, their siblings
and the control children. Daily supplementation of three Lactobacillus strains, two Biﬁdobacterium
strains and a Streptococcus strain (mixed in a 60:25:15 ratio; one capsule thrice a day) for four months
decreased the amount of Biﬁdobacterium and Desulfovibrio spp. and also normalized the ratio of
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes in the feces of ASD-children. The study showed that the severity of the ASD
has a strong positive correlation with the severity of the GI dysfunctions in the subjects. The level of
TNFα was decreased after probiotic supplementation. No strong correlations were found between
the plasma levels (DHEA-S, oxytocin and testosterone) and fecal microbiota. Overall, probiotic
supplementation altered the composition of gut microbiota in ASD children [113].

A study by Adams et al. [11] revealed that the severity of ASD has a strong direct correlation with
the GI symptoms, which was assessed by the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and that
the probiotic supplementation inﬂuences the level of short chain fatty acids in ASD children.

d-arabinitol is a metabolite of pathogenic Candida spp. and the ratio of d-arabinitol/l-arabinitol is
one of the biomarkers of candidiasis. The supplementation of the probiotic (L. acidophilus Rosell-11; 5 ×
109 CFU per gram; twice a day) for two months to autistic children signiﬁcantly reduced the level of
urine d-arabinitol and d-arabinitol/l-arabinitol ratio and also improved the concentrating power and
the ability to respond to an order [114].

A case study reported by Grossi et al. [115] revealed that the supplementation of VSL#3 (a mixture
of live cells of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus (reclassiﬁed as L. helveticus), L. acidophilus, B. breve,
B. longum, B. infantis, L. paracasei, L. plantarum, S. thermophilus) for four weeks signiﬁcantly improved the
autistic core symptoms and reduced the severity of the GI symptoms in a boy (12-years-old) with ASD
and a severe disability of cognitive function. Moreover, during the follow up treatment period (four
months), a VSL#3 intervention reduced the Social Aﬀect domain of Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (ADOS) score after two months of treatment and further reduced the score after another two
months. There was no ﬂuctuation in the ADOS score up to 10 months (follow up period). This study
suggested that the proper use of probiotics may improve the ASD symptoms, but more research is
necessary [115].

The supplementation of a mixture of probiotic strains (B. longum, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus; 1 ×
108 CFU per gram; 5 g per day) for three months signiﬁcantly altered the fecal microbiota of ASD
children, speciﬁcally the level of Biﬁdobacteria and Lactobacilli, which were found to be increased
after intervention compared to baseline. The severity of the ASD and the severity of the GI symptoms,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 2647

were measured by ATEC and a six-item GI Severity Index (6-GSI) questionnaire, respectively, and were
found to be reduced after probiotic supplementation in ASD children compared to baseline. The study
suggested that probiotic supplementation improves the behavioral pattern and the GI discomforts in
ASD children [116] (Table 1).

L. rhamnosus GG (1010 CFU per day) was supplemented to pregnant women for four weeks before
delivery and continued the probiotic supplementation for six months to the mother (if breastfeeding)
or to the infant. The clinical evaluation and behavioral assessments were made at three weeks and at 3,
6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age and ﬁnal attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Asperger
syndrome (AS) records were made at the age of 13. The results showed that probiotic supplementation
reduced the risk of the development of a neuropsychiatric disorder compared to that of the placebo
group [117].

5. Conclusions

Mounting evidences conﬁrmed the alteration in the gut microbial composition in children suﬀering
from ASD. However, the unique proﬁle of microbiome has not yet been fully characterized due to
the heterogeneity of patients. GI disorders such as bowel dysfunction and GI tract inﬂammation are
more frequent in severe cases of ASD. The ﬁndings of several recent studies showed that amendments
of gut microbiota may improve the ASD symptoms and revealed the beneﬁcial impact of probiotic
supplementation on the improvement of symptoms of ASD, which suggest that probiotics can be used
as a potent adjuvant therapeutic agent for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. In addition,
studies have suggested that the dietary regulations may strengthen the therapeutic advancement
in ASD treatment. However, suﬃcient research evidence is missing to authenticate the potential
eﬀects of probiotics and dietary interventions on the symptoms of ASD. More scientiﬁc research is
needed to address the issues such as the optimum dose and duration of probiotic supplementation for
ASD treatment, the fate of microbial metabolites in the human body and the compatibility of dietary
supplements and probiotics, which would help us to develop typical and eﬀective treatment strategies
to improve ASD symptoms. Overall, the improvement of the life quality of ASD children requires
mutual and moral support from parents and society, in addition to therapeutic approaches.
