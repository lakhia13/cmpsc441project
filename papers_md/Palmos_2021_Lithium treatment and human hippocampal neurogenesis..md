Lithium is a ﬁrst-line treatment for bipolar disorder, where it acts as a mood-stabilizing agent. Although its precise mechanism
remains unclear, neuroimaging studies have shown that lithium accumulates in the hippocampus and that chronic use amongst
bipolar disorder patients is associated with larger hippocampal volumes. Here, we tested the chronic effects of low (0.75 mM) and
high (2.25 mM) doses of lithium on human hippocampal progenitor cells and used immunocytochemistry to investigate the effects
of lithium on cell parameters implicated in neurogenesis. Corresponding RNA-sequencing and gene-set enrichment analyses were
used to evaluate whether genes affected by lithium in our model overlap with those regulating the volume of speciﬁc layers of the
dentate gyrus. We observed that high-dose lithium treatment in human hippocampal progenitors increased the generation of
neuroblasts (P ≤ 0.01), neurons (P ≤ 0.01), and glia (P ≤ 0.001), alongside the expression of genes, which regulate the volume of the
molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This study provides empirical support that adult hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis
are mechanisms that could contribute to the effects of lithium on human hippocampal volume.

INTRODUCTION
Lithium has been used in the treatment of bipolar disorder
symptoms for over 50 years [1]. Despite its longevity as a mood
stabilizer, questions remain regarding its effects on the brain and
its
therapeutic mechanism of action. Recent neuroimaging
studies, implicate the hippocampus as one important target of
lithium, with both mouse [2] and human [3] studies showing an
accumulation of lithium in the hippocampal regions of the brain
following repeated oral administration.

The hippocampus is a brain area, which regulates learning,
memory, cognition, and mood [4], and large mega-analyses from
the ENIGMA neuroimaging consortium suggest smaller hippo-
campal volumes are a common feature amongst psychiatric
[5–7]. Amongst bipolar disorder patients,
disorder patients
however, chronic lithium users exhibit
larger hippocampal
volumes relative to their peers who are either unmedicated or
undergoing other forms of treatment [8]. This suggests that
lithium treatment may normalize hippocampal volume reductions
observed in psychiatric disorder patients, either by protecting
existing neurons [9], or by promoting neurogenesis [10].

Unlike most of the brain, the mammalian hippocampus is
capable of neurogenesis even in adulthood [11], with estimates of
up to 700 new neurons being generated each day in the human
dentate gyrus [12]. Environmental [13], genetic [14] and pharma-
cological factors [15] can inﬂuence the rate of neurogenesis in the
adult hippocampus, either by affecting the rate of cell proliferation
along the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, or the rate at
which these cells differentiate into neurons and glia. In the context
of lithium, it has been hypothesized that part of its mechanism of

action involves triggering neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus,
which would subsequently increase the density of neurons (and
glia) and contribute to the observed increase in hippocampal
volume and improvement in mood and cognition [16]. Indeed, the
neurogenic properties of lithium have been reported previously in
animal models, whereby lithium either increases the number of
proliferating [10, 17, 18] or differentiating neural cells [19].
However, there has been a marked absence of studies investigat-
ing the effects of lithium on human hippocampal cells. There is
also no empirical data connecting the neurogenic effects of
lithium observed in model systems to the effects observed in the
human brain (i.e., from neuroimaging data). The current study
aimed to bridge this gap, and to provide empirical evidence either
supporting or refuting the relationship between lithium, human
hippocampal neurogenesis, and hippocampal volume.

Here, we employed an in vitro protocol [20, 21] to assess the
chronic effects of low (0.75 mM) and high (2.25 mM) doses of
lithium on human hippocampal progenitor cells, assessing effects
on global gene expression, cell proliferation, and cell differentia-
tion. We found a signiﬁcant
increase in the generation of
neuroblasts, neurons, and glia in response to high-dose lithium,
with no changes in the rates of cell proliferation or cell death.
Corresponding RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and gene ontol-
ogy (GO) enrichment revealed a change in genes responsible for
neuronal development and the extracellular matrix, in response to
high-dose lithium. Gene-set enrichment analyses were used to
test whether genes affected by lithium overlap with those
regulating the volume of distinct layers of the dentate gyrus.
We found that genes upregulated in response to high-dose

lithium are speciﬁcally enriched for variants associated with the
volume of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where the
majority of dendritic branching occurs amongst adult-born cells.
Collectively, our work suggests that chronic lithium treatment
increases human hippocampal progenitor differentiation, and by
doing so,
increases the volume of the molecular layer of the
dentate gyrus and subsequently total hippocampal volume.

METHODS
Human hippocampal progenitor cell line
An existing multipotent human hippocampal progenitor cell
line,
HPCOA07/03 (ReNeuron, UK), was used to model human hippocampal
neurogenesis in vitro, as used previously by our team [20–23]. The cell line
was derived from ﬁrst-trimester,
tissue
following medical termination, and in accordance with UK and USA
ethical and legal guidelines, and obtained from Advanced Bioscience
Resources (Alameda CA, USA). These cells proliferate in the presence of
growth factors, and upon their removal, differentiate into hippocampal
PROX-1-positive cells, MAP-2-positive neurons, and S100β-positive glia. For
further details on the cell line and culture conditions for proliferating and
differentiating cells, see Supplemental Information, S1–S2.

Chronic lithium treatment
Cells were treated chronically with either a vehicle control (0 mM), a
therapeutically relevant low dose of lithium (0.75 mM) similar to what’s
found in the blood of bipolar disorder patients [24], or a high dose of
lithium (2.25 mM) similar to what’s been used in previous in vitro work
[25]. Cells were grown in T75 ﬂasks and were maintained in proliferating
cell media and a constant lithium concentration across ﬁve passages
(~15 days), see Supplemental Information S2. This duration was selected
because it exceeds the minimal
time period required to observe
clinically meaningful effects of lithium in bipolar disorder patients [26].
Four biological replicates were utilized in order to detect medium-to-
large effect sizes [27]. Following this, subsets of cells were either (i) lysed
and submitted to nucleic acid extraction for subsequent RNA-sequen-
cing, (ii) seeded on to a 96-well plate and submitted to a proliferation
assay, followed by immunocytochemistry, or (iii) seeded on to a 96-well
plate and submitted to a differentiation assay, followed by immunocy-
tochemistry, Fig. 1.

Proliferation and differentiation assays
(Immunocytochemistry)
To compare differences in cell marker levels between control, low, and
high lithium conditions, we performed immunocytochemistry using an
established 3-day proliferation protocol performed on 96-well plates,
where we assayed the proliferation markers BrdU and Ki67, and the
apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (CC3). We also assessed differentiation
as part of a 10-day protocol, where we assayed the neuroblast marker
doublecortin (DCX), the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2

Fig. 1 A summary of our experimental protocol. Cells were treated
with control (0 mM), low (0.75 mM) or high (2.25 mM) doses of
lithium across ﬁve passages (~15 days) and submitted to nucleic
acid extraction and RNA-sequencing, a proliferation protocol, and

(MAP2), the glial marker S100β, and the apoptotic marker CC3. Cells were
maintained in their respective lithium doses across both assays. See
Supplemental Information, S3–S5 and Supplementary Table 1 for further
details.

RNA-sequencing
Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All RNA samples were of good purity and
integrity, as indicated by 260/280 ratios of between 1.95 and 2.1, tested
(Thermo Scientiﬁc,
using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer
Wilmington, DE), and RINs > 9, as tested using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies, Berkshire, UK). Library preparation and RNA-
sequencing were performed at The Genomic Centre, King’s College
London. Brieﬂy, total RNA samples were submitted to a DNase treatment
using the DNA-free™ DNA Removal Kit
(Invitrogen, California, USA).
Subsequently, 300 ng of total RNA from each sample was submitted for
ribosomal RNA depletion using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion kit (New
England Biolabs, Massachusetts, USA), and RNA-Seq libraries were
constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit
for Illumina (New England Biolabs). The samples were sequenced in a
HiSeq 4000 sequencing system (Illumina). Raw reads were downloaded
and processed using a systematic approach, see Supplemental Informa-
tion, S6. As the clearest effect on neurogenesis was observed between the
control group (vehicle treated) versus the high-dose lithium group, our
primary gene expression analysis was limited to these two groups.
Differential expression analysis was achieved using Wald tests in DESeq2,
controlling for biological
replicates per
condition). Log2 fold-changes were shrunk using apeglm [28], and the
false discovery rate (FDR) correction was used to control for multiple
comparisons. As a secondary, complementary analysis, we also generated
RNA-seq data comparing the control group (vehicle treated) versus the low
therapeutically relevant dose of lithium,
in order to establish whether
effects in the high-dose group overlapped with those observed in the
‘therapeutically relevant’ low-dose condition. In accordance with the UK
research councils’ Common Principles on Data Policy, RNA-seq data
supporting this study is openly available via GEO, under the accession code
GSE184930.

Gene-set enrichment analysis
We tested for a genetic overlap between upregulated and downregulated
genes affected by high-dose lithium in our model, and those regulating
the volume of the whole hippocampus, or distinct layers of the dentate
gyrus (where neurogenesis takes place), including the hilus, the granular
cell
layer. We achieved this by utilizing
publicly available summary statistics from a GWAS that used neuroimaging
methods to estimate the volume of hippocampal subﬁelds in over 21,000
individuals [30]. Within this study, the volume of each layer of the dentate
gyrus was corrected for total hippocampal volume in order to isolate
genetic effects speciﬁc to each layer. Gene-level followed by gene-set
enrichment analysis was performed in MAGMA [31] after removing the
region encompassing the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome
6, 25–34 Mb), due to the complex linkage disequilibrium structure of this
locus. We used a 10 kb window around genes to link the polymorphisms
tested in the GWAS with all established protein-coding genes in the
genome. The gene-level enrichment was calculated by generating a gene-
wide statistic from the GWAS summary statistics, adjusting associations for
gene size, variant density, and linkage disequilibrium using the 1000
Genomes Phase 3 European reference panel. Subsequently, we used
MAGMA to perform a competitive test to calculate the enrichment of how
over-represented the genes in our gene sets (up- or downregulated genes
in the cell model) were in relation to those implicated in each trait (i.e.,
hippocampal volume), relative to other gene sets of similar size across the
genome.

Statistical analyses
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were used to assess
the effects of lithium on cell markers. The normality of cell marker data was
conﬁrmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. RNA-sequencing data and down-
stream analyses were performed as described above. The False Discovery
Rate (FDR) method of multiple testing correction was applied to each
analysis, where we considered an PFDR < 0.1 as signiﬁcant. For the RNA-
sequencing analysis we applied a more conservative threshold (PFDR <
0.05) in order to derive gene sets comprising of fewer than 500 genes for
the gene-set enrichment analysis.

Figure generation
Figures were created using Prism7 (GraphPad, San Diego USA) and
BioRender (Toronto, Canada). The volcano plots were generated using
[29]. The gene network ﬁgure was generated using
WebGestalt
GeneMANIA [32].

RESULTS
Lithium does not affect rates of cell proliferation relative to
vehicle control
We analysed hippocampal progenitor cells chronically treated
with high/low/no lithium using a screen of cellular markers, and
estimated the percentage of cells expressing markers of neural
stem cell proliferation and programmed cell death. ANOVA
revealed no signiﬁcant differences between the vehicle control
and lithium-treated samples in relation to the proliferation marker
BrdU (F(2, 9) = 0.367, p = 0.703), suggesting that the most recent
levels of proliferation were unaffected by the low and high lithium
doses. Results pertaining to the apoptotic marker CC3 (F(2, 9) =
0.735, p = 0.506)
indicate that the lithium doses used in our
experiment were not inducing cell death and thus were unlikely to
be toxic.

ANOVA did show a signiﬁcant difference in relation to the
proliferation marker Ki67 (F(2, 9) = 8.384, p = 0.009, PFDR < 0.1),
which unlike BrdU captures differences in proliferation over a

between the low and high-dose lithium conditions (p = 0.008),

High-dose lithium increases rates of hippocampal progenitor
cell differentiation
We analysed the effects of lithium on markers of neurons and glia,
whilst cells were differentiating. ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant
differences between lithium-treated cells and the vehicle control,
in relation to the percentage of DCX-positive neuroblasts (F(2, 9) =
7.616, P = 0.012), the percentage of cells expressing the neuronal
marker MAP2 (F(2, 9) = 10.55, p = 0.004) and the percentage of
cells expressing the glial marker, S100β (F(2, 9) = 17.48, p =
8.000 × 10–4). All effects on neural cell differentiation remained
signiﬁcant after correcting for the number of markers tested (PFDR
< 0.1). In all comparisons, high-dose lithium increased rates of cell
differentiation relative to vehicle-treated control cells (p < 0.01),
Fig. 3. We additionally stained for the apoptotic marker CC3, and
found consistently low levels of cell death (<5%) which did not
differ between conditions (F(2, 9) = 0.774, p = 0.490).

enriched for GO terms related to nervous system development
and the MHC protein complex. The 383 upregulated genes were
enriched for GO terms related to cell adhesion, the extracellular

matrix, and endoplasmic reticulum, Fig. 4. Whilst the effect of lose
dose lithium on gene expression was more subtle, approximately
one-third of the genes nominally affected by this dose (P < 0.05),
were also affected by the high-dose condition (PFDR < 0.05; 78 out

change), see Supplementary Datasets for full results.

We also considered how our gene expression results compared
to genes previously implicated in bipolar disorder and lithium
response. Out of 45 candidates previously identiﬁed [33] only two
were signiﬁcantly affected in our model—Protein kinase B (AKT1)
and Myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) (PFDR
< 0.1), both of which were downregulated in response to high-
dose lithium. See Supplemental Information, S7 and Supplemental
Fig. 1, for further information on these results and a discussion of
these candidates.

Genes upregulated in response to high-dose lithium also
regulate the volume of the dentate gyrus
Our gene-set enrichment analyses revealed a nominal overlap
between genes upregulated in response to lithium and those
regulating whole hippocampal volume (β = 0.072, SE = 0.041, p =
0.03). We then tested for overlaps with subﬁelds of the dentate
gyrus (where neurogenesis occurs), and found a speciﬁc overlap
between the genes upregulated in response to high-dose lithium
and those associated with the volume of the molecular layer of
the dentate gyrus (β = 0.100, SE = 0.041, p = 0.007, PFDR < 0.1), Fig.
5b. To better understand which genes/networks within our gene
set contributed to this positive relationship, we identiﬁed 20
genes that were signiﬁcantly affected in our model (PFDR < 0.05)
that were also at least nominally associated with volume in the
molecular layer (P < 0.05) based on the gene-level enrichment

analysis. We then performed gene network analysis using
GeneMANIA to consider how these genes relate to one another.
This revealed a signiﬁcant enrichment for collagen-containing
extracellular matrix genes (PFDR < 0.05), and identiﬁed Laminin
Subunit Gamma 1 (LAMC1) as a potential hub gene, because it
interacted with 9 of the other signiﬁcant genes within that
network (more than any other gene), Fig. 5c.

DISCUSSION
Lithium accumulates in the neurogenic regions of the brain and
exerts a positive effect on hippocampal volume in bipolar disorder
patients [2, 3, 8]. Given the existence of the neurogenic niche in
the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, we tested the chronic
effects of lithium treatment on parameters of neurogenesis in
human hippocampal progenitor cells, and used population
genetic methods to infer their putative relationship with adult
hippocampal volume.

As opposed to non-human animal work [9, 10, 17, 18, 34], our
results generally did not show an effect of lithium on markers of
cell proliferation (BrDU, Ki67) or programmed cell death (CC3). The
absence of effects on the expression of these markers may
represent a species-speciﬁc difference [35], or reﬂect the speciﬁc
treatment duration utilized in our model. Alternatively, it may be
that lithium preferentially protects mature neurons as opposed to
neural progenitor cells, or cells that are challenged with a stressor.
Previous research has demonstrated neuroprotective effects of

testing correction (PFDR < 0.1). c A gene network image generated using GeneMANIA. This describes genes signiﬁcantly affected by lithium in

it might represent an important hub gene.

inﬂammation, or genetic
lithium in response to cellular stress,
perturbations (e.g. amyloid precursor protein upregulation), and
thus the absence of a stressor (or speciﬁc genetic driver) in our
model may explain the absence of clear effects [36]. Curiously, we
did observe increased proliferation in the low-dose lithium group
relative to the high-dose group (marked by Ki67); however, neither
condition was signiﬁcantly different from the control, Fig. 2. It is
possible that a low-dose lithium treatment exerts a subtle increase
in proliferation, whereas high doses drive cells away from
proliferation and toward differentiation. Further work in indepen-
dent model systems and larger sample numbers may be useful in
teasing apart more subtle dose-speciﬁc effects of lithium on cell
proliferation.

Our immunostaining results did reveal a clear positive effect of
chronic high-dose lithium on human hippocampal progenitor cell
differentiation, with increases observed in the percentage of cells
expressing both neuronal and glial markers. This supports animal
work which shows that lithium can increase hippocampal cell
differentiation by increasing the percentage of MAP2-positive cells
[19]. Although the mechanism via which lithium exerts its effects
on cell differentiation will require further research, our RNA-
sequencing data hints at early transcriptomic changes
to
proliferating cells which might facilitate subsequent cell differ-
entiation. For instance, amongst proliferating cells treated with
high-dose lithium, we observed an upregulation of genes
responsible for cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix. The
extracellular matrix, a three-dimensional collection of proteins that
surrounds cells, provides biochemical and structural support for
cells as they develop [37]. It exerts direct effects on neural cell
differentiation, axon development, and myelination [38], and thus
the increase in expression of extracellular matrix genes whilst cells
are proliferating may provide an environment
that better
facilitates differentiation, which could ultimately facilitate neuro-
plasticity in the hippocampus. This is further supported by recent
work revealing the effects of lithium on both the extracellular
matrix and on astrocyte morphology [39]. Similarly, cell adhesion
is a process that enables neurite outgrowth, cell migration, axon
guidance, and synaptogenesis, which also plays a critical role in
neuroplasticity [40].

To contextualise our

in vitro ﬁndings further, we should
consider how our results could potentially impact the structure
and function of the dentate gyrus, in vivo. The dentate gyrus is the
site of neurogenic activity in the hippocampus and consists of
distinct layers, each providing different niches for cell growth and
development [41]. The subgranular zone houses proliferating
neural progenitor cells and it is the site of adult neurogenesis [42].
As progenitor cells differentiate and specialize into neurons, they
generate dendrites, which project outwards through the granular
cell layer and into the molecular layer, where they expand to form
new dendritic branches (with the aid of cell adhesion molecules
and proteins in the extracellular matrix), Fig. 5. Axons also extend
inwards, towards the hilus where they form synaptic connections
with unmyelinated axons (mossy cells) and integrate into the pre-
existing neuronal circuitry [41]. Our work reveals a speciﬁc impact
of lithium on neural cell differentiation, and we can infer from its
effects on gene expression that it is likely to speciﬁcally impact on
the volume of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Based on
these ﬁndings, we theorize that lithium triggers early transcrip-
tomic changes to progenitor cells that increase their rate of
differentiation, ultimately leading to the expansion of cells into the
molecular layer. As the molecular layer represents the outermost
layer of the dentate gyrus and this is the area where neurons are
increased neural cell
is possible that
branching outward,
differentiation (and density) would consume space within this
layer, and that this would subsequently force the hippocampus to
expand in volume.

To narrow down which genes might link lithium’s effect in our cell
model, to the volume of the molecular layer, we isolated the genetic

it

overlap and performed gene network analysis. Similarly to the effect
of lithium in our model using all genes surpassing the multiple
correction threshold, this subset was enriched for genes related to the
collagen-containing extracellular matrix, Fig. 5c. At its hub was
Laminin Subunit Gamma 1 (LAMC1), which is an extracellular matrix
glycoprotein that plays important roles in cell adhesion, differentia-
tion, and neurite outgrowth [43]. Future research should consider
whether LAMC1 and the network of genes it interacts with could be
used to inform alternative ways of promoting neurogenesis and
hippocampal volume in psychiatric disorder patients.

Given the relatively small size of the dentate gyrus, it is possible
that lithium affects cell mechanisms outside of this region too,
which could contribute to overall volume differences observed
amongst chronic lithium users. For instance, the strongest effect
we observed in our cell model was lithium’s impact on gliogenesis.
Unlike neurons, new glia continue to form in the hippocampus,
and across the brain, throughout life, due to the widespread
presence of glial progenitor cells [44]. Consequently, an increase in
glial cell differentiation could also contribute to volume changes
observed in bipolar disorder patients treated with lithium. Not
only could an increased number of glial cells consume more space
within the hippocampus, these cells also facilitate the remyelina-
tion of neurons, which could contribute to structural and
functional changes leading to volume increases.

Despite the insights discussed here, there are limitations of our
study that should be acknowledged. First, the effects of lithium are
known to be moderated by genetic factors [45], and so by using a
single cell line we may be missing important information relating
to its mechanism of action in a broader context. Second, our gene
expression data was collected in proliferating cells, whereas the
clearest effect of lithium on neurogenesis-related markers was
observed once these cells were differentiated. Consequently, we
may be missing important effects of lithium on the transcriptome
whilst cells are differentiating. However, previous work using
antidepressants in this cell
line demonstrated that drug treat-
ments whilst cells are proliferating are actually more pivotal in
fast-tracking downstream increases in cell differentiation [46]. This
effect is likely mediated by early gene expression changes to
proliferating cells (i.e., those captured in our RNA-seq data) that
prime cells to more readily differentiate into adult cells [46]. Third,
we used population genetic methods to bridge the gap between
what we observed in human cells in vitro, and what is observed in
neuroimaging studies. Although this sort of approach is novel and
important, it is still inferential. Future studies should verify that
lithium exerts an effect on hippocampal volume via the molecular
layer of
the dentate gyrus, by observing changes in this
hippocampal subﬁeld in patients treated with lithium long-
itudinally. Fourth, we observed the majority of lithium’s effects
in the high-dose condition which although are consistent with
concentrations used in other in vitro work [47], may not be
representative of the concentration found in the blood of patients
or their hippocampus. Nonetheless, directly extrapolating drug
doses from an in vivo experiment to an in vitro one is complicated
[48]. Whilst we acknowledge that the high dose of lithium could
exert toxic effects in patients (e.g., in the thyroid and kidneys), the
immunocytochemistry and gene expression results do not reveal
any impact of high-dose lithium on markers of cell death (e.g., no
effects on CC3 levels) in our hippocampal model. The RNA-seq
results also reveal an overlapping effect of what is observed in
response to the low and highdose conditions, supporting the
notion that high-dose lithium affects similar molecular mechan-
isms as the ‘therapeutically relevant’ low-dose in our model, but
with a stronger magnitude of effect. It is possible that a longer
treatment duration with the low dose would more closely
recapitulate the effects of the higher dose used in our protocol.
Finally, our study makes use of a conditionally immortalized, fetal-
derived cell line and thus the effects observed may not reﬂect
what occurs in adult progenitor cells in vivo. Differentiation of

induced pluripotent stem cells into hippocampal cultures offers an
alternative way to validate ﬁndings reported here, and to consider
lithium’s effects in cells from psychiatric disorder patients [49].
Alternatively,
in vivo models with mature cells and established
intercellular networks could provide even greater construct
validity [50] that are not possible from tissue culture experiments.
To conclude, this study reveals a positive effect of chronic high-
dose lithium on human hippocampal progenitor cell differentia-
tion which correlates with an upregulation of genes that mediate
cell adhesion or constitute the extracellular matrix, as well as those
that regulate the volume of the molecular layer of the dentate
gyrus. Our
research suggests that adult neurogenesis and
gliogenesis could be mechanisms contributing to lithium’s effect
on hippocampal volume. Future research should continue to
bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo observations, and to
explore whether neurogenesis is also a critical mechanism
explaining lithium’s therapeutic effects.
