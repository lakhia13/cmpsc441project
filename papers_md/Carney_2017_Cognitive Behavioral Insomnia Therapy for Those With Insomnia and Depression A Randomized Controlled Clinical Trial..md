Study Objective:  To compare cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) + antidepressant medication (AD) against treatments that target solely depres-
sion or solely insomnia.
Design:  A blinded, randomized split-plot experimental study.
Setting:  Two urban academic clinical centers.
Participants:  107 participants (68% female, mean age 42 ± 11) with major depressive disorder and insomnia.
Interventions:  Randomization was to one of three groups: antidepressant (AD; escitalopram) + CBT-I (4 sessions), CBT-I + placebo pill, or AD + 4-session 
sleep hygiene control (SH).
Measurements and Results:  Subjective sleep was assessed via 2 weeks of daily sleep diaries (use of medication was covaried in all analyses); although 
there were no statistically significant group differences detected, all groups improved from baseline to posttreatment on subjective sleep efficiency (SE) and total 
wake time (TWT) and the effect sizes were large. Objective sleep was assessed via overnight polysomnographic monitoring at baseline and posttreatment; anal-
yses revealed both CBT groups improved on TWT (p = .03), but the AD + SH group worsened. There was no statistically significant effect for PSG SE (p = .07). 
There was a between groups medium effect observed for the AD + SH and CBT + placebo group differences on diary TWT and both PSG variables. All groups 
improved significantly from baseline to posttreatment on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17); the groups did not differ.
Conclusions:  Although all groups self-reported sleeping better after treatment, only the CBT-I groups improved on objective sleep, and AD + SH’s sleep 
worsened. This suggests that we should be treating sleep in those with depression with an effective insomnia treatment and relying on self-report obscures 
sleep worsening effects. All groups improved on depression, even a group with absolutely no depression-focused treatment component (CBT-I + placebo). The 
depression effect in CBT-I only group has been reported in other studies, suggesting that we should further investigate the antidepressant properties of CBT-I.
Keywords:  insomnia, depression, CBT-I.

INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a condition with markedly 
reduced  quality  of  life,  increased  health-care  utilization  and 
suicide  risk,  and  impaired  social/occupational  functioning.1–3 
Antidepressant  medications  (for  review  see4)  and  psychologi-
cal  interventions  (for  review  see5)  have  well-established  effi-
cacy  for  treating  MDD  and  restoring  normal  functioning  in 
many with this condition. However, those MDD patients who 
present  with  clinically  significant  insomnia  complaints  com-
prise a particularly challenging group to treat. For many such 
patients, insomnia represents a long-standing and problematic 
condition that can: (1) predate the onset of MDD,6,7 (2) increase 
the  risk  of  suicide,8,9  (3)  show  a  suboptimal  response  to  tra-
ditional  depression  treatment,10,11  (4)  remain  after  successful 
depression treatment,12,13 and (5) increase risk for MDD relapse 
(e.g.,  Nierenberg  et  al14).  Perhaps  because  the  insomnia  of 
MDD patients traditionally has been viewed as an MDD symp-
tom  rather  than  a  comorbid  disorder,  the  sleep-specific  treat-
ment  needs  of  MDD  patients  have  been  largely  ignored  until 
recently. Addressing this gap in the literature is important when 
the  prevalence  of  MDD  and  sleep  complaints  are  considered; 
90%  of  those  in  clinical  settings  presenting  with  MDD  com-
plain  of  sleep  problems,15,16  and  MDD  plus  insomnia  patients 
actually outnumber insomnia-only patients in sleep clinics by 
almost 2:1.17–19 Considering the persistence and potential long-
term  significance  that  insomnia  may  have  for  MDD  patients, 
well-designed studies to test the benefits of insomnia-targeted 
therapies for those who present comorbid MDD and insomnia 
are urgently needed.

Of the available treatments, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for 
Insomnia (CBT-I) represents an attractive option for comorbid 

MDD/insomnia patients. CBT-I is currently considered a safe, 
efficacious, and durable therapy for the treatment of insomnia 
disorder (ID).20 Studies suggest that the psychological factors 
targeted by CBT-I presumed to perpetuate the sleep problems 
among  ID  sufferers  generally  are  also  common  in  insomnia 
patients  with  comorbid  depression.12,21  In  addition,  CBT-I  has 
been shown to successfully reduce these sleep-disruptive factors 
and to improve the sleep of patients with insomnia and comor-
bid mental disorders, even in those receiving pharmacotherapy 
for  depression.22  One  study  evaluating  CBT-I  for  those  with 
residual MDD and refractory insomnia after adequate pharma-
cotherapy for depression found that both sleep and depression 
improved significantly more among the CBT-I group than those 
treated  as  usual  with  only  pharmacotherapy.23  Furthermore, 
research  suggests  that  significant  improvements  in  sleep  are 
associated with mood improvements and even remission of the 
depressive episode.24–26

Taken  together,  these  studies  provide  convincing  early  evi-
dence  that  CBT-I  is  effective  for  improvement  in  sleep  and 
may also lead to additional improvement in depression symp-
toms. Unfortunately, the studies conducted to date lacked both 
proper control groups and objective (polysomnography [PSG]) 
verification of sleep changes. An exploration of PSG-measured 
sleep  is  important  because  we  know  that  antidepressants  can 
cause objective sleep problems (for review see27). The purpose 
of this randomized controlled trial was to compare a therapy 
that  combines  CBT-I  with  antidepressant  medication  (CBT-I 
+ AD)  against  treatments  that  target  solely  depressive  symp-
toms  (AD  +  sleep  hygiene  control  [SH])  or  insomnia  symp-
toms  (CBT-I  +  placebo  drug  [PD])  for  improving  sleep  and 
depression symptoms in patients with comorbid insomnia and

MDD. It was hypothesized that (1) the combined CBT-I + AD 
therapy  would  produce  significantly  greater  pre-to-post  ther-
apy improvements on subjective and objective sleep continuity 
measures than the two monotherapy conditions; (2) the com-
bined CBT-I + AD therapy would produce significantly greater 
pre- to posttherapy improvements in clinician-assessed depres-
sion (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAMD-17]); and 
(3) posttreatment sleep would predict posttreatment depression 
symptoms.

METHODS

Design
This trial employed a randomized split-plot experimental design 
with three between-group cells (CBT-I + AD, CBT-I + PD, and 
AD + SH) and four within-group cells (baseline, mid-treatment, 
posttreatment,  and  6-month  follow-up). The  behavioral  thera-
pies (i.e., CBT-I and SH) were delivered in a single-blind man-
ner, whereas the medication components of treatment (i.e., AD 
and  PD)  were  delivered  in  double-blind  fashion.  Sample  size 
was determined using a priori analyses. Power estimates were 
calculated  with  Proc  Power  in  SAS  using  the  one-way  analy-
sis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  option  as  an  approximation  for  the 
statistical  model.  Previous  depression  literature  indicated  an 
expected 20% dropout rate before the posttreatment assessment 
and  another  25%  dropout  prior  to  follow-up  assessment.  To 
accommodate a 45% dropout rate by the follow-up time point, 
the recruitment goal was 67 subjects per group (Total N = 201) 
which would allow sufficient subjects (37 per group) to main-
tain >.80 power to detect the expected group differences.

Participants
Men and women aged 18–64 years old meeting diagnostic cri-
teria for both MDD and ID were recruited via clinics and media 
advertisements.  The  advertisements  invited  participation  in 
a study for depression and insomnia and did not reveal study 
hypotheses.  Recruitment  took  place  at  two  study  sites:  Duke 
University in North Carolina from 2008 to 2009 and Ryerson 
University in Toronto, Canada, from 2009 to 2014. Study pro-
tocols  were  approved  by  both  Duke  University  and  Ryerson 
University  ethics  review  boards,  and  all  participants  provided 
written consent for participation.

Participants were included if they (1) were in good health as 
determined  by  medical  and  psychiatric  history  and  physical 
examination; (2) had an insomnia complaint of at least 1-month 
duration that met Research Diagnostic Criteria for an Insomnia 
Disorder; (3) had a score ≥15 on the Insomnia Severity Index; (4) 
showed a mean sleep diary total wake time (TWT) ≥60 min per 
night and a mean sleep diary sleep efficiency (SE = [Total Sleep 
Time / Time in Bed] × 100%) <85% during a 1-week screening 
period; (5) met criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (with-
out psychotic features) as verified by the mood module of the 
SCID;  and  (6)  had  a  score  of  ≥15  on  the  17-item  HAMD17. 
Participants were included if they were currently taking antide-
pressant medication, as long as they and their treating physician 
were agreeable to discontinuing the antidepressant medication 
throughout the trial.

Excluded from the study were those who (1) needed immediate 
psychiatric (e.g., imminently suicidal patients) or medical care 

(e.g., patients with acute cardiac symptoms) or have attempted 
suicide in the past 6 months; (2) had a sleep-disruptive comorbid 
medical condition (e.g., moderate to severe rheumatoid arthri-
tis); (3) had a positive urine pregnancy test (to prevent possible 
adverse  effects  with  the  study  drug  escitalopram  and  a  fetus); 
(4) were not cognitively intact (a score <27 on the Mini-Mental 
Status Examination); (5) met criteria for another psychiatric dis-
order on the basis of an SCID interview that could account for 
or worsen the insomnia; (6) met criteria for sleep apnea, restless 
legs syndrome, or Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder on the basis 
of the Duke Structured Interview of Sleep Disorders and/or an 
apnea–hypopnea index ≥15 or periodic limb movement-related 
arousal  index  ≥15  per  hour  of  sleep  during  a  screening  labo-
ratory  polysomnogram;  (7)  had  a  history  of  alcohol,  narcotic, 
benzodiazepine, or other substance abuse or dependence in the 
6 months prior to screening or have a positive urine drug or alco-
hol test on the night of the screening PSG; (8) had any medical 
conditions that would preclude them from taking the study drug 
(e.g.,  a  disorder  characterized  by  altered  metabolism,  seizure 
disorder, severe renal impairment) or used any drugs known or 
suspected to affect hepatic or renal clearance of escitalopram or 
drugs that could interact with escitalopram; and (9) were hyp-
notic dependent (i.e., they reported that they were unwilling or 
unable to abstain from prescription medications for sleep during 
the 8-week treatment phase of the study).

Treatments
The  therapists  were  novice  graduate  students  naive  to  sleep 
treatments.  They  were  master’s-level  students  with  at  least 
1 year of practicum training in other CBTs. They were trained 
by  the  principal  investigator  (PI)/author  of  the  standardized 
treatment  protocols  (CBT-I  and  SH)  published  elsewhere.28 
New  therapists  began  by  observing  at  least  two  therapy  ses-
sions  by  a  doctoral-level  student,  and  they  proceeded  to  tak-
ing  the  lead  in  cotherapy  with  a  doctoral-level  student  in  the 
room. Once the doctoral-level student and the supervising PI/
first author agreed the student was competent in the therapy, the 
therapist was approved for therapy alone but under the weekly 
supervision of the PI (i.e., a behavioral medicine specializing in 
CBT for comorbid insomnia). There was no formal competence 
evaluation  beyond  observation  and  supervision.  Participants 
were randomized to one of three groups; all received 8 weeks of 
active treatment delivered in four biweekly sessions: (1) CBT-I 
+ AD; (2) CBT-I + PD; (3) AD + SH (sleep hygiene control). 
Double-blinding procedures were accomplished through a com-
pounding pharmacy that was responsible for receiving partici-
pant group information from one study administrator who was 
not blinded to treatment group. The primary study coordinator, 
PI, study physician, research assistant trained in the HAMD17 
assessments,  and  participants  were  all  blind  to  group  status. 
The inert placebo substance used was Avicel, a microcrystalline 
cellulose.

Escitalopram was selected as the study medication because it 
is safe, well-tolerated, and efficacious for treating depression.29 
It  allowed  for  the  use  of  a  single  and  standard  daily  medica-
tion dosage (10 mg) in this trial, thus eliminating subject var-
iability in dose and in the time to reach the final dose. As with 
all SSRIs, insomnia may occur as a side effect, but this occurs

for  only  7%  of  patients  taking  10  mg  of  escitalopram,  a  rate 
only slightly higher than the insomnia rate reported for placebo 
(4%). In fact, patients with depression and an insomnia com-
plaint report greater subjective sleep improvement with escit-
alopram  than  with  placebo,30  and  escitalopram  has  extremely 
low  rates  of  adverse  drug  effects  that  lead  to  discontinuing 
medication and/or initiating a new or additional therapy, so it 
seemed  a  good  choice.  Escitalopram  is  currently  one  of  the 
most frequently prescribed medications, perhaps due to its rat-
ing as one of the most cost-effective SSRIs.29,31,32 Adherence to 
the placebo and escitalopram medications was verified at each 
physician appointment with pill counts.

CBT-I + AD
Participants  in  this  treatment  group  received  CBT-I  and  the 
antidepressant,  escitalopram.  As  part  of  the  CBT-I  treatment, 
patients were first presented a standardized animated Powerpoint 
presentation  containing  sleep  education  and  information  relat-
ing to CBT for insomnia based on materials from Edinger and 
Carney.28 This education is designed to address unhelpful beliefs 
about sleep by providing corrective information about sleep (e.g., 
age-appropriate sleep norms, the effects of aging on sleep, influ-
ence of circadian rhythms, and the effects of sleep deprivation). 
During  the  remainder  of  the  session,  patients  were  provided  a 
regimen instructing them to (a) establish a standard wake time; 
(b)  get  out  of  bed  whenever  awake  for  >20  minutes;  (c)  avoid 
reading, watching television, eating, worrying, or other sleep-in-
compatible behaviors in the bed or bedroom; (d) refrain from day-
time napping; and (e) limit their total time in bed (TIB) to mean 
total sleep time (from baseline sleep diary) + 30 min (to allow for 
normal sleep onset latency and brief awakenings). The remain-
ing three treatment sessions were used to reinforce instructions 
provided in the first session and to make needed adjustments in 
TIB prescriptions. The TIB was increased by 15-min increments 
when the SE was >85%, and there was a report of daytime sleep-
iness. TIB was decreased by 15-min increments each week the 
subject showed an average SE <80%. Further, in sessions 2–4, 
remaining  sleep-interfering  beliefs  were  targeted  by  designing/
conducting behavioral experiments (e.g., testing the belief that, “I 
have limited resources to cope with daytime symptoms,” or that, 
“I need to try to sleep”). There were four 1-hr CBT-I biweekly 
sessions (treatment phase is thus 8 weeks). A biweekly four-ses-
sion schedule was selected because it has been shown empirically 
to be the optimal dose/schedule.61

Participants assigned to this condition also received a 10-mg 
daily  dose  of  the  medication,  escitalopram,  and  they  were 
maintained  on  this  dose  throughout  the  trial  as  there  are  no 
data supporting greater efficacy at a higher dose than 10 mg. 
The study physician met with each participant in this condition 
weekly  to  provide  medication  instructions  and  to  assess  and 
monitor  adverse  events;  an  MD  research  assistant  blinded  to 
conditions and trained in HAMD17 administration completed 
the HAMD17 ratings. During the first visit, the physician gave 
the participant an 8-week supply of escitalopram and instructed 
them to take one dose of this medication (i.e., a single 10-mg 
pill) each morning throughout the trial. Beginning at the second 
visit and continuing throughout treatment, the study physician 
conducted  a  thorough  assessment  of  adverse  events,  and  any 

events reported were documented and discussed with the par-
ticipant. Those who “responded” (i.e., had a > 50% decrease on 
HAMD17 and a > 50% decrease in ISI from baseline) did not 
meet current criteria for MDD, evidenced no significant adverse 
medication effects, and had HAMD17 and ISI scores <15 con-
tinued on their medication into the 6-month follow-up period or 
until they met removal criteria.

CBT-I + PD medication
Participants  assigned  to  the  CBT-I  +  PD  treatment  group 
received the same CBT-I treatment described earlier but were 
given the inactive placebo in place of the escitalopram. The pla-
cebo medication condition was used to control for the effects 
of “pill taking” that are operative in the CBT-I + AD and AD + 
SH  groups.  Participants  received  the  same  instructions  as  the 
escitalopram  (e.g.,  a  single  pill  is  to  be  taken  each  morning) 
and underwent the same adverse event assessment and weekly 
HAMD17 as the CBT-I + AD group.

AD + SH
Participants assigned to the AD + SH group received the same 
medication  (10  mg  escitalopram),  and  weekly  physician-di-
rected adverse event assessments and research assistant-admin-
istered HAMD17 as the AD + CBT-I condition. However, they 
received generic sleep hygiene instructions instead of an active 
cognitive behavioral sleep treatment (e.g., CBT-I). Preliminary 
studies support the perceived credibility of SH as an insomnia 
treatment. Also, SH recommendations have good “face validity,” 
as  they  are  often  used  in  clinical  practice.  Nonetheless,  sleep 
hygiene recommendations are ineffective for treating insomnia 
when used in the absence of other insomnia therapies.33,34 In the 
current trial, each participant assigned to this condition received 
the SH intervention during 4 biweekly 1-hr individual therapy 
sessions with a study therapist. Thus, both groups had the same 
amount  of  therapist  contact.  During  the  first  SH  session,  the 
therapist  reviewed  the  patient’s  sleep  diaries  without  sugges-
tions  for  altering  the  observed  sleep  schedule.  SH  consisted 
of descriptions of sleep stages, normal sleep architecture, and 
sleep  cycles  presented  via  an  animated  Powerpoint  presenta-
tion. After presenting this educational information, the therapist 
discussed a series of recommendations from the manual enti-
tled  “Overcoming  Insomnia,”28  including  eliminating  caffeine 
and alcohol, avoiding exercise and other physical activity just 
prior to bed, having a light snack before bed, and keeping the 
bedroom quiet, dark, and at a comfortable temperature. These 
recommendations were applied to the participant’s own circum-
stances in detail, such as planning a particular sleep-inducing 
snack (e.g., milk, peanut butter, and crackers) or not scheduling 
exercise right before bed. In addition to receiving these verbal 
instructions, SH patients were given a take-home pamphlet reit-
erating  the  sleep  hygiene  instructions.  During  subsequent  SH 
sessions, the therapist reviewed the logs and the sleep hygiene 
recommendations and addressed treatment adherence problems.

Screening Measures

Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders
The  Duke  Structured  Interview  for  Sleep  Disorders  (DSISD) 
is an instrument designed to assist in ascertaining Diagnostic

and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text 
Revision  (DSM-IV-TR)  and  International  Classification  of 
Sleep  Disorders,  Second  Edition  (ICSD-2)35  sleep  disorder 
diagnoses.  The  DSISD  has  acceptable  reliability  (κ  values 
ranging from .71 to .86 across DSM & ICSD categories) and 
discriminant validity.36

Folstein Mini-Mental Status Exam
The  Folstein  Mini-Mental  Status  Exam  (MMSE)37  was  used 
to identify and exclude individuals who have cognitive deficits 
that make them unable to give informed consent or fully partic-
ipate in an interactive treatment process. It contains items that 
assess orientation, attention, memory skills, mathematical abili-
ties, and language skills. Following standard administration and 
scoring procedures, all individuals who obtained a total MMSE 
score <27 were excluded.

Structured Clinical Interviews for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders
The  Structured  Clinical  Interviews  for  DSM-IV  Axis 
I  Disorders  (SCID)38  was  used  to  identify  study  candidates 
who  met  DSM-IV-TR  inclusion  criteria  for  MDD  as  part  of 
the screening process and to identify patients who met criteria 
for a major psychiatric illness other than MDD (e.g., particu-
lar Anxiety  Disorders,  Bipolar  Disorder,  Schizophrenia,  cur-
rent substance or alcohol dependence, etc.) that would obviate 
study participation. The SCID methodology has a strong leg-
acy attesting to its reliability and validity for ascertaining psy-
chiatric diagnoses.

Outcome Measures

PSG
All  study  participants  underwent  three  nights  (one  screen-
ing  night  and  two  baseline  nights  following  the  medication 
washout phase) of PSG monitoring prior to treatment and an 
additional  two  consecutive  nights  of  PSG  immediately  after 
treatment.  PSG  data  were  collected  using  CompumedicsTM 
recording devices at Duke and SandmanTM devices at the Sleep 
and Alertness Clinic (SAC). These devices are small 32-chan-
nel digital PSG recorders that allow sampling rates up to 512 
Hz  and  accommodate  a  wide  range  of  recording  montages. 
Software accompanying these devices allows for conventional 
scoring of records.

All  overnight  PSG  recordings  were  conducted  in  the  lab-
oratory. The initial PSG was conducted solely to identify and 
exclude  those  with  significant  sleep-disordered  breathing  or 
periodic  limb  movements.  The  monitoring  montage  for  this 
initial Screening PSG consisted of the following channels: two 
EEG (C3-M2 and Oz-Cz), one chin EMG, two EOG (left eye-
M1 and right eye-M2), one airflow (nasal–oral thermistor), two 
respiratory  effort  (thoracic  and  abdominal  impedance),  pulse 
oximetry,  two  anterior  tibialis  EMG  (right  and  left  legs),  and 
one  for  body  position  monitoring.  The  remaining  for  PSGs 
included  only  EEG,  EOG,  and  submental  EMG  leads  since 
these  recordings  were  used  only  to  derive  sleep–wake  meas-
ures used in treatment outcome analyses. Electrode attachments 
for all PSGs was performed in the sleep laboratory by trained 
technicians.  Usual  bed  and  rising  times  were  ascertained  for 
each  participant  via  interview  and  1  week  of  confirmatory 

sleep diary monitoring, and these “usual times” were used on 
the  PSG  recording  nights. All  PSGs  acquired  were  scored  by 
experienced  sleep  technologists  using  standard  scoring  crite-
ria  for  sleep  stage  assignments,39  the  identification  of  apneas/
hpopneas,40  and  periodic  limb  movement-related  arousals.41,42 
To ensure reliable PSG scoring, a randomly selected 10% of the 
PSGs conducted each month were rescored by ADK at Duke, 
and  a  second  technologist  at  SAC  and  scoring  results  were 
compared. When such comparisons revealed <85% agreement 
for epoch-by-epoch comparisons of sleep stage scoring and/or 
<80% agreement for event scoring, the technologists resolved 
their scoring differences. When preparing for sleep monitoring, 
study participants were instructed to refrain from caffeine intake 
after 12:00 PM on the days their PSG studies were scheduled. 
They were also instructed to abstain from alcohol ingestion and 
illicit drug use on these days. To assess their compliance with 
these  instructions,  they  underwent  breath-alcohol  testing  and 
provided a urine sample for drug screening prior to each PSG.

Interactive Voice Response System Electronic Sleep Diary
Subjective  sleep  estimates  were  obtained  using  a  touchtone 
telephone interactive program that automates the collection of 
subjective sleep data. The program, constructed by the PI using 
Voiceguide software (© Katalina Technologies, Inc.), presents 
questions  about  each  night’s  sleep  (i.e.,  bedtime,  sleep  onset 
latency,  number  and  length  of  nocturnal  awakenings,  time  of 
final awaking, and rising time). The Interactive Voice Response 
System  program  includes  queries  about  caffeine  (food/bev-
erages),  sleep  medication,  and  alcohol  use.  The  wording  of 
the  items  was  based  on  the  now-published  Consensus  Sleep 
Diary-Morning Version.43 At  the  end  of  the  entries  for  1  day, 
the  program  automatically  records  a  time  stamp  to  verify  the 
time and date that data were entered. There are moderate corre-
lations between diary and PSG measures of TWT (r = .73) and 
SE  (r  =  .66).87 Those  with  hearing  impairments  were  permit-
ted to use paper diaries. Paper diary data were manually double 
entered into the diary database.

Sleep Parameters
Primary  outcomes  were  the  2-week  means  of  TWT  and  SE 
percentage (SE% = [Total Sleep Time / Time in Bed] × 100%) 
taken  from  sleep  diaries.  Secondary  sleep  outcome  measures 
were TWT and SE% (mean values for two nights at baseline and 
post-treatment time points), taken from PSG. SE and TWT are 
widely used indices of sleep improvement in insomnia research 
because they are sensitive to all possible scenarios of sleep dis-
ruption (i.e., sleep onset, sleep maintenance problems, or both).
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)44 is a 7-item scale that assesses 
the self-reported severity of DSM-IV-defined insomnia symp-
toms. The ISI has demonstrated good internal consistency and 
test–retest reliability.45

Mood Measures
Clinician  ratings  of  depression  were  obtained  by  a  physician 
research assistant using the 17-item version of the HAMD17,46 
which  assesses  the  severity  of  17  depression  symptom  items 
over the past week. This measure has evidence of good reliabil-
ity (interrater reliability coefficient = .8447; item–total correla-
tions range from .45 to .78).48

Quality-of-Life Measure
The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 (MOS SF-36)49: The SF-36 
was  used  to  assess  changes  in  perceived  health-related  qual-
ity  of  life  and  served  as  a  secondary  outcome  measure. This 
36-item  self-report  instrument  is  a  reliable  and  widely  used 
questionnaire49  designed  to  assess  respondents’  quality-of-life 
perceptions  across  a  variety  of  functional  domains,  such  as 
global Physical Composite (PC) and Mental Composite (MC) 
scores  that  respectively  summarize  global  functioning  in  the 
physical and mental domains.

Medication Quantification Scale
The Medication Quantification Scale (MQS)50 provides a quan-
titative index for most types of common medications (prescrip-
tion and nonprescription) consumed based on the known effects 
of their long-term use. It provides a means of quantifying dif-
ferent types of medications using a common scale. It was orig-
inally developed for pain patient trials and has sound validity 
and  reliability.51 The  MQS  scores  are  derived  on  the  basis  of 
weights assigned to each type of medication and the actual dos-
age levels used. For example, a prn nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory medication is assigned a predetermined detrimental weight 
which is multiplied by dosage weights and then summed across 
days monitored. This provides a total score that can be entered 
as a covariate.

Measures of  Adverse Events
The study physician conducted assessments of adverse events 
at each patient visit using the Adverse Events Form (AEF). Full 
definitions for adverse events and specifications for determin-
ing severity and the relation of adverse events to the study med-
ications are contained in the AEF. These definitions are adapted 
from those used in a number of recent controlled trials.32,52

Therapy Evaluation Questionnaire
To assess acceptance of the two behavioral treatments (CBT-I 
and SH) and expectations for success, all study patients com-
pleted  the  Therapy  Evaluation  Questionnaire  (TEQ),53  both 
after  their  first  behavioral  treatment  session  and  again  at  the 
end  of  the  study’s  8-week  treatment  phase. The TEQ  consists 
of five questions (rated on a 7-point scale) assessing respond-
ents’ perceived logic of and confidence in their assigned treat-
ment  condition,  willingness  to  recommend  it  to  a  friend,  and 
so on. The TEQ also includes 2 items assessing the quality of 
the therapeutic relationship. The TEQ has high internal consist-
ency (Cronbach’s α = .79)54 and good face validity for assessing 
treatment credibility and therapist competence/warmth.

Treatment Component Checklist
To  assess  treatment  fidelity  and  therapist  adherence  to  spe-
cific  elements  of  the  two  behavioral  treatments  administered, 
a  Treatment  Component  Checklist  (TCC)  was  used.  This 
instrument consists of 20 items that describe a therapist verbal 
instruction  or  action  that  should  occur  either  in  the  CBT-I  or 
SH interventions. Ten of the items pertain specifically to CBT-I, 
whereas the other 10 specifically describe the SH therapy. An 
independent rater certified in behavioral sleep medicine (MDL) 
reviewed and rated the digital recordings of CBT-I and SH ther-
apy sessions using the TCC. A therapy “fidelity” index for each 

treatment  session  was  computed  for  each  treatment  session. 
A fidelity index = 1.00 suggests that the session included items 
solely from the treatment intended and was not “contaminated” 
by items from the alternate treatment.

Procedures
Study candidates telephoned the project coordinator in response 
to  study  advertising  (i.e.,  advertisements  and  brochures  in 
clinics).  The  project  coordinator  assessed  their  interest  and 
eligibility  using  a  brief  telephone  information  and  inclusion 
screen. Those found eligible were then scheduled for an in-lab 
screening interview at either the Ryerson Sleep and Depression 
Laboratory or the Duke Insomnia and Sleep Research Program. 
Participants attended this interview to provide study informa-
tion, to obtain informed consent, and to complete the DSISD, 
HAMD17,  SCID,  SCID-II,  MMSE,  and  ISI. Those  who  con-
tinued to meet inclusion criteria then completed (a) a standard 
medical  evaluation  that  included  a  physical  examination  and 
laboratory studies (i.e., chem.-7, abc with differential, thyroid 
panel, urinalysis and urine drug screen, and a serum pregnancy 
test if applicable), (b) one night of PSG monitoring, and (c) 1 
week of sleep log monitoring. Patients who continued to meet 
selection criteria and were also taking an antidepressant med-
ication  began  the  antidepressant  medication  washout  phase 
under  the  direction  of  the  study  physician. The  length  of  the 
washout phase varied depending on the half-life, dose, and dura-
tion of the antidepressant medication they were discontinuing. 
Participants  were  seen  by  the  study  physician  weekly  during 
this  phase  to  assess  safety.  After  the  washout  phase,  partici-
pants saw the study physician for a safety assessment and began 
pretreatment  (baseline)  monitoring,  including  (a)  maintaining 
IVR  sleep  diaries  to  describe  each  night’s  sleep  for  2  weeks; 
(b) two consecutive nights of PSG monitoring, and (c) outcome 
measures (ISI, SF-36). Those who continued to meet all study 
selection criteria were randomized to treatment groups follow-
ing the baseline period. Randomization was accomplished by a 
computer-generated randomization paradigm.

As  a  result  of  random  assignment,  each  study  participant 
received one of three interventions during an 8-week treatment 
period. Treatment with CBT-I or SH components were provided 
in 4 weekly individual visits followed by 2 visits scheduled at 
Week 6 and Week 8, by one of two graduate therapists super-
vised by a BSM expert (i.e., the first author). All treatment ses-
sions were conducted at the Duke Insomnia and Sleep Research 
Program  clinic  during Year  1  and  then,  for  the  remainder  of 
the  study,  sessions  were  conducted  at  Ryerson’s  Sleep  and 
Depression Laboratory. The study physician provided patients 
with  medication  instructions  and  medication  at  the  SAC. All 
participants  were  asked  to  maintain  nightly  IVR  sleep  diaries 
and  completed  treatment  adherence  ratings  throughout  the 
8-week  treatment  phase  of  the  project.  Immediately  after  the 
8-week treatment phase, study patients underwent a posttreat-
ment  assessment  that  included  completion  of  HAMD17  and 
SCID  mood  module,  all  outcome  questionnaires,  two  nights 
of Lab-PSG monitoring, and 2 weeks of sleep diary monitor-
ing. All of these assessments except for PSG monitoring were 
repeated at the 6-month follow-up.

There  was  not  a  true  follow-up  period  associated  with  this 
study because of stringent safety protocols. Once participants

completed  the  posttreatment  assessment,  they  continued  into 
the study’s follow-up phase only if their pre- to posttreatment 
decline  in  both  their  HAMD17  and  ISI  scores  were  in  the 
recovered range (minimum <15 at posttreatment for both); they 
did not meet current criteria for MDD on the mood module of 
the SCID; and they failed to meet Clinical Worsening criteria 
(clinical  worsening  is  defined  as:  1.  an  increase  in  HAMD17 
item #10 or BDI-II items #2 or #9, 2. a 20 % increase in total 
HAMD17  score,  or  3.  a  moderate  AE,  that  is,  the  symptom 
results in some restriction of regular activities). Although only 
entering this subset into the follow-up phase limited the abil-
ity  to  examine  this  data  in  a  meaningful  way,  it  was  done  to 
prioritize  safety  given  that  some  participants  received  place-
bos. Those  included  in  the  follow-up  phase  were  maintained 
on their assigned medication and were asked to attend monthly 
assessments, conducted primarily for safety purposes, with the 
Study Physician at the SAC over the 6-month follow-up period. 
The  MQS  was  completed  during  every  week  of  the  trial  and 
at 6-month follow-up to track the use of nonstudy medications 
during  the  trial. At  the  end  of  the  6-month  follow-up  period, 
participants completed the ISI, SF-36, HAMD17, and 2 weeks 
of IVR sleep diary monitoring.

Interim analyses were conducted on the ISI and HAMD17 as 
a safety precaution. During this time, all investigators remained 
blinded to treatment group. Results from these interim analy-
ses  including  the  aggregate  analysis  of  proportion  of  depres-
sion responders and insomnia responders was presented at the 
Association  for  Behavioral  and  Cognitive  Therapies  annual 
conference in Nashville, TN (2013). The trial was concluded as 
of November 30, 2013, at the end of the funding period.

RESULTS

Analyses
The  primary  analysis  of  these  variables  was  conducted  using 
imputed data and under intention to treat. The missing data on 
these  variables  were  imputed  using  multiple  imputation  tech-
niques. Secondary outcomes of HAMD17, BDI, and ISI varia-
bles were analyzed using complete case analysis. Comparisons 
across the three randomized groups were conducted using either 
general  linear  models  (GLM)  or  a  nonparametric  Wilcoxon-
signed rank test. For each variable, if the model was significant, 
pairwise  comparisons  between  groups  were  conducted  using 
the Tukey test for adjusted multiple comparisons.

Baseline Characteristics
Participant  flow  from  enrollment  until  the  completion  of  fol-
low-up for sleep diary variables is depicted in Figure 1. Main 
analyses were conducted on posttreatment data. Demographic 
and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  sample  are  depicted  in 
Table  1.  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences 
between  groups  on  age  or  gender;  thus,  these  variables  were 
not included as covariates in the analyses. Chi-square analyses 
revealed that there were no baseline group differences on AHI 
(p = .41) or PLM arousal index (p = .79).

Sleep
We  verified  that  there  were  no  statistically  significant  base-
line  differences  and  then  analyzed  baseline  to  posttreatment 

differences  using  an ANOVA  (GLM)  with  pairwise  compari-
sons,  adjusting  for  medication  use  (covarying  the  Medication 
Quantification Score). Each of the groups improved from base-
line  to  posttreatment  (p  <  .05),  and  there  were  no  group  dif-
ferences  on  mean  Sleep  Diary  (SD) TWT  [F  =  7.97,  p  =  .9] 
or  on  mean  SD  SE  [F  =  1.18,  p  =  .7].  The  between-group 
effect sizes for CBT+AD versus CBT+Placebo and CBT+AD 
versus AD+SH  group  for  SD TWT  were  small77  (d  =  .3  and 
d  =  .2,  respectively);  the  effect  for  CBT+Placebo  and  AD+ 
SH was medium (d = .5). The between-group effect sizes for 
CBT+AD versus CBT+Placebo, CBT+AD versus AD+SH, and 
CBT+Placebo versus AD+ SH for SD SE were small: d’s = .4, 
.2, and .3, respectively. Table 2 includes mean group sleep diary 
and PSG data as well as within-groups associated effect sizes.
On  objective  (i.e.,  PSG)  sleep,  there  were  statistically  sig-
nificant  group  differences  on  PSG TWT  (F  =  4.65,  p  =  .03); 
follow-up analyses revealed that CBT + PD improved but AD 
+ SH worsened, and this difference was statistically significant 
(p = .02); both CBT groups improved and did not differ from 
each  other  (p  =  .4;  see  Figure  2).  There  were  no  significant 
group differences for increases in PSG SE (F = 3.3, p = .07; see 
Figure 3). The between-group effect sizes for CBT+AD versus 
CBT+PD and CBT+AD versus AD+SH group for PSG TWT 
were small: d = .36 and d = .32, respectively. The effect size 
for the between-group difference for CBT+PD versus AD+ SH 
was medium (d = .67). Although the trend was the same for effi-
ciency as it was for PSG TWT, that is, CBT + PD improved but 
AD + SH worsened, this difference was not quite statistically 
significant (p = .059). The CBT groups did not differ from each 
other  on  follow-up  analyses  (p  =  .3).  Likewise,  the  between-
group effect sizes for CBT+AD versus CBT+PD and CBT+AD 
versus AD+SH group, for PSG SE were small (d = .29, d = .19, 
respectively), whereas the effect size for the between-group dif-
ference for CBT+PD versus AD+ SH was medium (d = .68).

With  respect  to  a  global,  subjective  retrospective  impres-
sion  of  their  insomnia  symptoms,  all  groups  showed  a  statis-
tically significant improvement from baseline to posttreatment 
(p  <  .05),  but  there  were  no  group  differences  (p  =  .9). The 
between-group  effect  sizes  for  CBT+AD  versus  CBT+PD 
on  the  ISI  was  medium  (d  =  .56),  and  the  effects  were  small 
for  CBT+AD  versus  AD+SH  and  CBT+PD  versus  AD+  SH 
(d’s = .29 and .25, respectively).

Mood
Depression  (i.e.,  HAMD17  total  scores)  changes  were  tested 
to ensure there were no statistically significant baseline differ-
ences and then baseline to posttreatment were analyzed using 
an ANOVA  (GLM)  with  pairwise  comparisons,  adjusting  for 
medication  use  (covarying  the  Medication  Quantification 
Score).  All  groups  improved  from  baseline  to  posttreatment 
(p < .05), but there were no group differences on the HAMD17 
(F = 37.86, p = 1.0). The HAMD17 between-group effect size 
for CBT+AD versus CBT+PD was d = .02 and was small for 
CBT+AD versus AD+SH and CBT+PD versus AD+SH (both 
d’s = .32). The results remained the same when the sleep items 
of the HAMD17 were removed (F = 43.04, p = 1.0). HAMD17 
baseline  and  posttreatment  group  mean  scores  and  associated 
effect sizes are depicted in Table 2.

Relation Between Depression and Insomnia
We  conducted  a  logistic  regression  analysis  predicting  post-
treatment depression remission status (remitted = HAMD17 < 
8  and  no  MDD  on  SCID  and  nonremitted  =  HAMD17  ≥  8 
and /or meeting MDD criteria on the SCID). Table 3 provides 
a summary of the results. We entered baseline levels of sleep 
disturbance  and  insomnia  and  neither  was  a  statistically  sig-
nificant  predictor  of  depression  treatment  outcome.  We  also 
entered  posttreatment  sleep  (ISI  continuous  score),  and  this 

was  a  significant  predictor  of  depression  treatment  outcome 
(ß = −.403; p = .001).

Because there are sleep items in the HAMD17, we conducted 
a multiple regression analysis predicting posttreatment depres-
sion score with sleep items removed (see Table 4). We entered 
baseline  levels  of  depression  (HAMD17  with  sleep  items 
removed) and insomnia (ISI) and neither was a statistically sig-
nificant predictor of HAMD17 score at posttreatment (p = .07).

Score). There  were  no  group  differences  on  GH  (p  =  .99)  or 
PF (p = .99).

To understand the clinical significance of the treatments, we 
tested  whether  there  were  any  differences  in  those  attaining 
self-reported  good  sleeper  status  at  posttreatment  (i.e.,  ISI  < 
8); the chi-square was not statistically significant (χ2 (2) = 2.3, 
p = .31). Insomnia remission (ISI < 8) was identical for both 
CBT groups (22% each) and lower, albeit not statistically, for 
the  AD+SH  group  (only  6%  meeting  the  good  sleeper  cut-
score).  Similarly,  there  was  no  group  difference  on  depres-
sion  remission  (i.e.,  HAMD  posttreatment  score  <8)  with  χ2 
(2) = .034, p = .98; CBT+AD = 39%, CBT+placebo = 39% and 
AD+SH = 41% with a score lower than 8.

Quality of Life
We  evaluated  whether  there  were  perceived  group  improve-
ments  from  baseline  to  posttreatment  on  general  health  per-
ception  or  physical  functioning  (PF)  on  the  SF-36  using  an 
ANOVA  (GLM)  with  pairwise  comparisons,  adjusting  for 
medication  use  (covarying  the  Medication  Quantification 

Treatment Credibility
Treatment credibility was assessed at pre- and posttreatment via 
a repeated measures multivariate ANOVA. On the omnibus test, 
there was a main effect for time (p = .02) but no group × time 
interaction (p = .98). An examination of the follow-up ANOVAs 
revealed  that  only  the  items:  “confident  in  recommending  the 
treatment to a friend” and “confident that treatment will be suc-
cessful  for  self ”  changed  over  time  (both  at  p  <  .01).  In  both 
cases, ratings increased at posttreatment (i.e., they became more 
confident that it was successful for self and that they would rec-
ommend it to a friend). In other words, at baseline, the mean for 
recommending it to a friend was 5.62 (SD = 1.1), and it increased 
at  posttreatment  to  M  =  6.13  (SD  =  1.1);  the  maximum  score 
possible is 7, meaning that you are very likely to recommend it 
to a friend. Similarly, at baseline the mean for believing it would 
be successful was 5.13 (SD = 1.2), and this rating significantly 
increased to M = 5.72 (SD = 1.4); the maximum score possible is

7, meaning that they were confident that the treatment would be 
successful. At posttreatment they provided ratings of the therapist 
on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The 2 items were “How warm and 
caring did you find your therapist” and “How confident are you 
in your therapist’s skills?” A Likelihood ratio chi-square tested 
whether groups differed on these 2 items. The chi-square values 
for both were not statistically significant, χ2 (6) = 10.24, p = .12 
and  χ2  (6)  =  10.24,  p  =  .12,  respectively].  Most  of  the  sample 
(69% rated the therapist as very warm and 68% rated the thera-
pist as very competent) gave the highest rating possible (i.e., 7).

Treatment Fidelity Check
Therapists  were  graduate  students  at  Ryerson  University  super-
vised  by  a  licensed  psychologist  with  a  specialty  in  behavioral 
sleep  medicine  (CEC).  This  psychologist  is  also  the  PI  of  the

study and author of the treatment manual Overcoming Insomnia.28 
Therapists completed a Therapy Component Checklist (TCC) at 
the end of each session, indicating which elements of the proto-
col were discussed in session. Therapists were randomly assigned 
to patients using a random number generator in Microsoft Excel. 
When  a  graduate  student  no  longer  worked  on  the  trial,  a  new 
therapist was substituted into the randomization table for the for-
mer therapist. Seven of the reviewed Session 1 tapes were the SH 
group. The “first session” for SH consisted of a review of sleep 
logs and sleep complaints only and scores should be close to 0; 
that is, almost no elements of CBT should be heard on the tape. 
The mean score was 0.14 (SD = .38) for Session 1 of SH. The 
remaining reviewed tapes (N = 26) were in the CBT group; their 
score should be close to the maximum score of 15, meaning that 
most of the elements of Session 1 should be heard on the tape. The 
mean score for Session 1 of CBT was 13.25 (SD = 1.0). Digital 
audio files for the first session were sent to an independent rater 
for review. The independent rater (MDL) is a licensed psycholo-
gist  certified  in  behavioral  sleep  medicine. The  rater  completed 
the  same  TCC,  and  we  tested  whether  the  independent  rater’s 
TCC scores differed from the therapists’. The independent rater 
also evaluated (yes/no) whether the SH group received any CBT-
specific interventions—there were no such violations. The result-
ing κ value revealed a very high rate of agreement (.9). Thus, by 
both PI supervision and oversight and independent rater treatment 
components, treatment fidelity was very high in this study.

DISCUSSION
Results from this trial indicate that although three combinations 
of  depression  and  insomnia  treatments  were  helpful  in  produc-
ing  subjective  improvements  for  insomnia  and  depression,  a 
depression-only  approach  objectively  worsened  sleep.  That  is, 
on objective (PSG) indices, there was improvement in mean total 
time awake for the CBT-I groups, but the AD + SH group actually 
worsened on this index. The same trend was shown on objective 
SE. Subsequently, we explore the possible reasons for this differ-
ence in subjective versus objective sleep outcomes as well as dis-
cuss the depression response with an insomnia-specific treatment.
With  respect  to  subjective  insomnia  indices,  all  groups  did 
reasonably  well,  with  improved  scores  on  both  ISI  and  sleep 
diary  indices  from  baseline  to  posttreatment.  One  possible 
explanation  may  relate  to  sleep  hygiene  being  a  poor  control 
sleep  therapy  condition.  This  therapy  controlled  for  nonspe-
cific  effects,  as  the  material  was  presented  by  the  same  ther-
apists for the same amount of time as CBT-I groups. There is 
some  support  for  sleep  hygiene  as  a  treatment  for  insomnia 
(e.g.,55,56); however, when considering the evidence collectively,

this therapy fails to meet standards of evidence as an effective 
monotherapy33  (see  also57).  This  group  also  was  taking  anti-
depressant  medication,  so  the  positive  subjective  effects  may 
be related to the antidepressant itself; that is, in other studies, 
some  depressed  patients  taking  SSRIs  report  subjective  sleep 
improvements.58,59 It is unclear whether this effect is due to the 
perception that the depression is improving with the medication 
and thus sleep also is rated more favorably. Previous research 
has shown that subjective assessment of insomnia using sleep 
items  on  depression  inventories  is  associated  with  modest 
improvement  in  some58,59  and  worsening  in  others.60 The  lack 
of a follow-up period precludes us from knowing whether the 
subjective benefit would have any durability.

Another possible explanation for the lack of separation for the 
sleep hygiene and CBT-I groups on subjective insomnia improve-
ment may relate to the dose of CBT-I in this trial. Participants in 
this study were those with both insomnia and MDD. Although 
4  sessions  are  optimal  in  those  with  insomnia  alone,61  it  is 
possible  that  individuals  with  both  insomnia  and  depression 
would benefit from a longer treatment period, as some studies62 
report somewhat diminished treatment effect sizes in those with 
comorbidities.  However,  a  meta-analysis  including  studies  of 
differing treatment duration found similarly large effects, such 
as  observed  in  this  trial,  in  those  with  comorbid  insomnias.63 
Similarly, it is possible that the therapy was not potent enough 
because  it  was  delivered  by  novices  (i.e.,  graduate  students). 
Although fidelity to the protocol was measured formally, there 
was no formal competence evaluation beyond the observation 
of the students and weekly supervision of these sleep-therapy 
naive novice therapists. Additionally, there was some inequality 
with  the AD  condition,  in  that  a  licensed,  medical  prescriber 
with  decades  more  clinical  experience  was  interacting  with 
participants, in comparison to the inexperienced therapists for 
the cognitive behavioral components. Nonetheless, participant 
ratings of the therapist/therapy, fidelity assessments, and close 
supervision by a CBT-I expert (first author) support the idea that 
the cognitive behavioral components were delivered in a com-
petent manner. In fact, it is promising for widespread dissemi-
nation that, similar to other studies similar to other studies,64–67 
this brief insomnia treatment is effectively delivered to complex 
patients by novice nonsleep specialist providers. Although there 
was no separation on the mean subjective appraisal of sleep, the 
rate of those in the AD+SH group becoming good sleepers by 

the end of the treatment was only 6% as compared to over 20% 
in  the  CBT  groups.  Moreover,  the  differences  in  the  between 
group  effect  sizes  for  subjective TWT  and  PSG  indices  were 
small for the comparison of the CBT groups and the CBT+AD 
and AD+SH  group,  but  the  effect  size  for  the  comparison  of 
the CBT+Placebo and AD + SH group was medium. This con-
sistent pattern suggests the possibility that there may be sleep 
differences for the two control group conditions (CBT-I + PD 
and AD+SH) that may have emerged if sufficiently powered.

Although there was no statistical separation on the mean sub-
jective  appraisal  of  sleep,  there  were  statistically  meaningful 
group differences in objective sleep; that is, in the group with-
out  the  antidepressant  (CBT-I  +  PD),  there  was  improvement 
in the time spent awake via PSG, but in the antidepressant plus 
control  therapy,  there  was  a  worsening  in  the  amount  of  time 
spent awake. This finding is perhaps not surprising, as there are 
studies using objective polysomnographic indices finding that a 
proportion of SSRI-treated patients experience a disturbance of 
their sleep,68 and these objective sleep problems can last as long 
as  30  weeks  after  SSRI  discontinuation.68–71 Thus,  there  were 
subjective improvements reported by many of those on antide-
pressants but an objective worsening if the antidepressant was 
paired with sleep hygiene (i.e., CBT-I was not used). Given the 
widespread use and belief that sleep hygiene is effective,57 this 
finding suggests antidepressants should not be augmented with 
sleep hygiene if improved objective sleep is desired. Although 
subjective sleep is the most typical target in insomnia treatment, 
growing research suggests that objective indices such as total 
sleep time may relate to adverse health outcomes such as cogni-
tive impairment, hypertension, and diabetes.72–74 Thus, evidence 
of objective sleep worsening in antidepressant therapy is cause 
for concern.

There  were  no  differences  in  depression  whether  someone 
received a depression treatment or not; that is, all three groups 
showed  improvements  with  large  effect  sizes  on  depression. 
The between-group effects were small which has been found in 
other studies examining CBT-I.78 These results are also consist-
ent with previous studies suggesting CBT-I is associated with 
improvements in depression symptoms as well as increased rates 
of depressive remission.75 In another study CBT-I was shown to 
potentiate the antidepressant effects of the medication,24 but this 
did not occur in this study. Although posttreatment sleep pre-
dicted posttreatment depression status,  there  was no evidence 
that the combined depression and insomnia treatment fared any 
better than the CBT-I alone group or the AD + SH group. It is 
unclear why we did not see this effect. The Manber et al. study 
was a small study and the only comparison study to date, so it is 
possible that these findings were anomalous. It is also possible 
that  this  study  was  statistically  underpowered,  since  our  final 
sample size was less than the a priori power analysis suggested 
was necessary.

The CBT-I + PD was no different than the active antidepres-
sant medication treatment groups on depression symptom sever-
ity, and their sleep was objectively and subjectively improved 
(the  effect  sizes  for  this  group  in  comparison  to  the AD+SH 
control were medium in size for diary and PSG TWT as well as 
PSG SE). Given that this group did well with respect to sleep, 
and just as well with respect to depression, it may be tempting 
to see this insomnia-only treatment choice as viable because it

would be shorter than a lengthy antidepressant course; however, 
this interpretation should be considered in light of the follow-
ing study design features. First, these participants were taking a 
placebo pill so we do not know what would happen if CBT-I was 
delivered in isolation. Second, this study is limited in that the 
sample included only those who met criteria for both insomnia 
disorder and MDD, and thus, these results, at best, can general-
ize only to those who have both disorders. There are some with 
MDD who do not have insomnia disorder and some who expe-
rience  hypersomnia;  thus,  these  results  may  not  generalize  to 
the range of people with depression. Additionally, as mentioned 
earlier, the analyses were underpowered according to the a pri-
ori power analysis, so it is possible that the antidepressant treat-
ment groups could have produced superior depression treatment 
responses, but the insufficient sample size precluded adequate 
power analyses. The CBT-I plus placebo was not significantly 
different from the other CBT group on any index. Finally, safety 
precautions in the trial precluded a rigorous assessment of fol-
low-up effects of all of the treatments, so we do not know the 
long-term effects of any of these treatments. This is a limitation 
that was necessary due to safety, but this design issue is signif-
icant because it is unknown as to whether the treatments would 
have had durable effects. It would be important to find a safe 
way to explore durability in future research.

The aforementioned caveats withstanding, there may be rea-
sons why CBT-I seems to help with MDD. Although this trial 
did  not  contain  an  investigation  of  treatment  mechanisms, 
CBT-I targets the time spent in bed in a 24-hr period via sleep 
restriction and stimulus control, which promotes more time out 
of bed and increased activation. Future studies should consider 
increased  behavioral  activation  as  a  possible  mechanism  of 
change in CBT-I for depression. In addition, more time out of 
bed also generally means increased light exposure, which may 
be  another  possible  mechanism.  Excess  rapid  eye  movement 
(REM) sleep has been shown to have a depressant effect,76 and 
since CBT-I tends to limit excessive time in bed in the morning 
hours, this may prevent excess REM sleep. Future studies should 
focus on the mechanisms of sleep improvement on mood.

In sum, CBT-I was a brief but effective treatment for insom-
nia  in  those  with  MDD,  both  on  subjective  and  on  objective 
measures  of  sleep,  even  when  delivered  by  novice  therapists, 
and  with  benefits  on  depression  that  were  indistinguishable 
from antidepressant medication. Although the combination of 
an  antidepressant  medication  with  sleep  hygiene  produced  a 
positive, subjective appraisal of sleep, the combination of anti-
depressant  medication  and  sleep  hygiene  was  associated  with 
an  objective  increase  in  the  time  spent  awake  in  bed.  Thus, 
CBT-I  appears  to  be  an  important  component  of  depression 
management for those with both MDD and insomnia disorder, 
and  future  research  should  explore  the  antidepressant  mecha-
nisms of CBT-I.
