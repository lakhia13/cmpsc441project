Abstract

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, often debilitating disorder characterized by the
presence of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are repetitive thoughts or images which are
experienced as intrusive and unwanted; they cause marked anxiety and distress. Compulsions (also
known as rituals) are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that individuals with OCD perform in an
attempt to decrease their anxiety. Patients tend to hide their symptoms due to shame; the amount of
time between onset of symptoms and appropriate treatment is often many years. The disorder likely
results from several etiological variables;
imaging studies have consistently shown
functional
hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and striatum. The mainstays of
treatment include cognitive-behavioral therapy in the form of exposure and response prevention
(ERP) and serotonin reuptake inhibiting medications. Several pharmacological augmentation strategies
exist for treatment-resistant OCD, with addition of antipsychotics being most commonly employed.
Radio and neurosurgical procedures, including gamma knife radiation and deep brain stimulation, are
reserved for severe, treatment-refractory disease that has not responded to multiple treatments, and
some patients may benefit from transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Introduction
OCD is an often debilitating disorder characterized by the
presence of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are
repetitive thoughts or images which are experienced as
intrusive and unwanted; they cause marked anxiety and
distress. Compulsions (also known as rituals) are
repetitive behaviors or mental acts that individuals with
OCD perform in an attempt to decrease their anxiety [1].
For example, an individual with contamination obses-
sions may experience great anxiety after touching a public
toilet seat. In response to this anxiety, the individual may
wash his or her hands repetitively in an attempt to get rid
of the “contamination”. A vicious cycle develops in OCD
whereby every time a compulsive behavior or mental act
(for example, neutralizing a “bad” thought with a “good”
thought) is performed, OCD worsens,
leading to an
intensification of obsessions and compulsions [1]. Certain

symptom categories are common in OCD. These include
contamination, symmetry, ordering/counting, forbidden
thoughts/images/scrupulosity, and harm. Those with
contamination symptoms will experience contamination
obsessions and cleaning/washing compulsions. Symptoms
in the symmetry category include a need for alignment of
objects. Some patients engage in ordering or counting to
prevent a dreaded outcome. Patients may experience
forbidden/horrific thoughts or images and attempt to
neutralize them with compulsions. Scrupulosity obsessions
and compulsions that are outside the typical boundaries of
a particular religion are also common. Those with harm
OCD experience symptoms related to harm coming to
self or others; checking compulsions are common in
this category (for example, in order to prevent a fire, an
individual may repetitively check to see whether or not the
stove has been turned off). The recently published

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth
Edition (DSM-V) has moved OCD out of the “Anxiety
Disorders” category and placed it within a new category:
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders [1]. In
creating this new category of disorders, hoarding, previ-
ously categorized as a subtype of OCD, is now its own
disorder (hoarding disorder). We will focus here on OCD,
but the reader may consult a review on the treatment
of hoarding [2].

Epidemiology
OCD occurs in 1.2% of the population [3,4] in the United
States and similar rates are seen across cultures [5]. In
childhood, males are more commonly affected;
the
reverse is true in adulthood [4,5]. The mean age of onset
is 19.5 years; males tend to have an earlier age of onset
than females [4]. Onset after age 35 is rare but can occur.
The onset of symptoms is generally gradual. If OCD goes
untreated, the course is typically chronic with waxing and
waning symptoms, and remission rates are low [6,7].

treatment

Etiology/Pathophysiology
OCD likely results from multiple variables. Genetic
factors are implicated: Monozygotic twins are much
more likely to exhibit OCD symptoms than dizygotic
twins [8]. Studies of first-degree relatives have indicated
that family members are at greater risk [9]. It has been
argued that there is an autosomal dominant mode of
transmission [9–12]. There is an association between
pregnancy and the development of obsessive-compulsive
symptoms: Among 59 female OCD patients, 39% of
women described onset of OCD symptoms during
pregnancy [13]. Onset of symptoms after striatal lesions
or head trauma has also been described [14]. As the
mainstay of pharmacological
for OCD
includes serotonin reuptake inhibiting medications, it
appears clear that dysfunction within the serotonin
system plays a role in pathophysiology [15]. Functional
neuroimaging studies have illustrated that a hyperactive
brain circuit exists in OCD; areas involved include the
orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, thalamus, and
striatum [16]. Evidence for dysfunction in these areas
also appears to exist in children [17]. A decrease in
metabolic activity in the hyperactive brain circuit has
been shown to occur after administration of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive-
behavioral therapy [18,19]. In addition, some patients
appear to develop or experience an exacerbation of OCD
symptoms following beta-hemolytic streptococcal infec-
tion. It is thought that antibodies that are produced
cross-react with basal ganglia proteins; this phenomenon
has been named “PANDAS” (pediatric autoimmune
neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal
infection) [20].

Diagnosis/Rating Scales
The diagnosis of OCD is typically made using DSM-V
criteria as a guide [1]. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-
Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is the most widely used
measure of OCD symptoms. It has been demonstrated to
be valid and can be used as a self-report or clinician-
administered scale; both adult and child versions exist
[21]. Both versions have a symptom checklist and a
severity rating scale. The symptom checklist provides
clinicians with data on specific symptom types/domains
that require further attention. The severity scale has
10 questions — 5 about obsessions and 5 about
compulsions — and the overall score is used to rate
symptom severity.

Treatment
The mainstay of treatment for OCD includes cognitive-
behavioral therapy in the form of ERP and medication
management (most commonly with serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, or SRIs). The initial treatment choice depends on
illness severity. A mild to moderate severity of illness, which
is indicated by a Y-BOCS score of 8 to 23, can be treated
with either ERP or administration of an SRI alone [22].
However, most medication trials in OCD used only a 25%
to 35% reduction in Y-BOCS scores as a benchmark of
efficacy in order to gain US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval. In addition, in a study that examined ERP
versus drug treatment alone, ERP was found to be more
effective [23]. Therefore, if it is available, ERP is generally
recommended as the first-line treatment for mild to
moderate symptoms. For more severe symptoms, medica-
tion management in combination with ERP is recom-
mended. In fact, some patients with severe OCD will
have difficulty engaging in ERP if they are not exhibiting
a medication response beforehand.

Exposure and Response Prevention
An individual with OCD who engages in treatment with a
skilled cognitive-behavioral/ERP therapist can make sig-
nificant gains overall in level of functioning and quality of
life. The effectiveness of ERP has been clearly demon-
strated in OCD [23,24]. The first step in any OCD
treatment includes providing psychoeducation about the
illness and the ERP process. Patients are encouraged to
complete a 24-hour obsession and compulsion symptom
log after the Y-BOCS is administered, and these data are
used in the construction of a hierarchy of symptom
triggers. Symptom triggers are rated on a scale from 0 to
100, often using 10-point intervals. For example, a patient
with contamination symptoms might consider touching a
public doorknob less anxiety-provoking (rated a lower
number) than touching a public toilet seat. Patients are
then encouraged to work on doing “exposures” by moving
up their hierarchies. An example of an exposure exercise

would be holding on to a “contaminated” doorknob. The
individual is encouraged to continue holding onto the
doorknob until his or her anxiety decreases substantially. It
is important that patients are encouraged to expose
themselves to triggers during therapy sessions and that
they leave sessions with well-defined ERP homework
assignments. We recommend that patients engage in at
least one hour of ERP each day in order to increase the odds
of a successful outcome. It is important to emphasize that
provoking OCD on purpose (planned exposures) is just as
important as resisting the urge to engage in compulsions
following an unplanned (naturalistic) exposure.

Medication Management
Five compounds have FDA approval for the treatment of
OCD: clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) and four
SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline).
Numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of SSRIs for
OCD and they are generally considered to be similar in
efficacy [25]. Clomipramine generally has a higher side-
effect burden than SSRIs. Therefore, an SSRI is recom-
mended as first-line pharmacological treatment [26].
When choosing an SSRI, consider potential drug-drug
interactions, comorbid medical conditions,
individual
side-effect profiles, patient age, prior treatment response,
and family history of treatment response [26]. A true trial of
an SSRI in OCD includes at least a moderate dose for at
least 12 weeks. Please see Table 1, adapted from [26], for
details. We have eliminated citalopram from the table
because of increasing concern about corrected QT (QTc)
prolongation with this agent, especially at higher doses
(see [27] for details). Although escitalopram is not FDA-
approved for the treatment of OCD in the US, it has an
indication for the treatment of OCD in Europe and has
been shown to improve levels of disability and work-
related functioning [28]. Please be mindful that children
who have been prescribed SSRIs should be monitored
closely for possible changes in suicidal ideation [29].

Clomipramine
Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with the active
metabolite desmethylclomipramine. It is more anticholi-
nergic and sedating than SSRIs. It also tends to cause more
weight gain. The potential for cardiac toxicity exists and
regular electrocardiograms (EKGs) are useful in monitor-
ing heart rate, rhythm, and QTc interval. Blood levels of
clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine must also be
monitored. However, for those who do not respond to one
or more SSRI trials (defined by a less than 25% reduction
in overall Y-BOCS score [22]), clomipramine is a good
option, as a meta-analysis has suggested that it is more
effective than the SSRIs [30]. Clomipramine is serotonin-
specific and desmethylclomipramine is norepinephrine-
specific; the drug is converted to desmethylclomipramine
by CYP1A2. Fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2. Therefore,
some clinicians attempt to raise the clomipramine/
desmethylclomipramine ratio by adding 25 mg of
fluvoxamine to existing clomipramine treatment. This
strategy is employed in order to increase the serotonin
reuptake inhibition of clomipramine. When clomipra-
mine is combined with any SSRI, regular monitoring of
blood levels and EKGs is recommended in order to avoid
cardiac and central nervous system toxicity [31]. Levels
that have been recommended for effective treatment [31]
include 225 to 350 ng/mL for clomipramine and
combined clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine
levels of less than or equal to 500 ng/mL. Please note
that individuals with low CYP1A2 metabolic activity
require lower doses of clomipramine.

Augmentation of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
with Antipsychotics
If an individual does not respond to initial SSRI treatment
(<25% reduction in Y-BOCS score) or exhibits a partial
response, he or she may benefit from augmentation of the
SSRI with an antipsychotic medication [32]. The antipsy-
chotic drugs that have evidence for their use include

Doses are presented as number of milligrams per day. aSome patients may need to start at half this dose or less to minimize undesired side effects
such as nausea or to accommodate anxiety about taking medications. bThese doses are sometimes used for rapid metabolizers or for patients with
no or mild side effects and inadequate therapeutic response after 8 weeks or more at the usual maximum dose. cCombined plasma levels of
clomipramine plus desmethylclomipramine 12 hours after the dose should be kept below 500 ng/mL to minimize risk of seizures and cardiac
conduction delay. dSertraline, alone among the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is better absorbed with food.

haloperidol, risperidone, and aripiprazole; less evidence
exists for the use of quetiapine or olanzapine [33–41].
Please consult our more detailed treatment manual [25]
for details on dosing strategies for antipsychotic augmenta-
tion. Determining the best time during course of treatment
to begin antipsychotic augmentation has often been
questioned, given that a true SRI trial in OCD is at least a
moderate dose for a full 12 weeks. A meta-analysis [40]
suggests that when compared to initiating antipsychotic
augmentation before 12 weeks of SRI treatment, over 25%
more patients will respond with a longer duration of the
initial SRI treatment. In addition, this meta-analysis
provided evidence that OCD with comorbid tics responds
particularly well to antipsychotic augmentation of SRIs.
Moreover, a recent study [42] compared the effects of
augmenting SRIs with ERP (17 sessions twice weekly)
versus risperidone (up to 4 mg/day) or placebo. Patients
receiving ERP had significantly greater reductions in
week-8 Y-BOCS scores compared to those receiving either
risperidone or placebo, and more patients receiving ERP
responded as defined by a mean Y-BOCS score decrease of
greater than or equal to 25% (80% responded in the
ERP group, 23% in the risperidone group, and 15% in the
placebo group). Interestingly, reductions in Y-BOCS
scores for those receiving risperidone augmentation did
not differ significantly from reductions exhibited by those
receiving placebo.

Augmentation of Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
with Other Agents
A different augmentation strategy that
targets the
serotonin system includes augmenting SRIs with 5-HT3
antagonists. Preliminary evidence exists for ondansetron
and granisetron [43–45]. In fact, an additional recent
study of ondansetron augmentation of SRIs found that
12/21 (57%) of patients responded to ondansetron
augmentation initiated at 0.25 mg twice a day for 2
weeks, titrated to 0.5 mg twice a day for an additional
10 weeks [46]. After discontinuation of ondansetron,
Y-BOCS scores increased (worsened) by an average of
15.5% in the whole sample of participants and by 38.3%
in the sample of participants who responded to the initial
augmentation. In addition, there has been interest in
augmenting SRIs with memantine [47], lamotrigine [48],
opiramate [49,50], d-amphetamine, and caffeine [51].

Radio/Neurosurgical Procedures
For cases that are documented to be extremely severe, not
responding to multiple therapeutic interventions, gamma
knife radiosurgery and deep brain stimulation have been
used. Gamma knife radiosurgery was used in OCD prior to
deep brain stimulation. It is not FDA-approved and
consists of anterior capsulotomy, limbic leucotomy, and
cingulotomy [26]. Deep brain stimulation is now also an

option as it has received a “Humanitarian Device
Exemption” from the FDA for severe, intractable OCD.
To date, a relatively small number of patients have had
the procedure, and the targets and programming
paradigms are not standardized. Some targets include
the nucleus accumbens, ventral internal capsule, and
ventral striatum [52].

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
The data on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for
OCD are mixed. In addition to questions about efficacy,
there are questions about what sites should be targeted.
Some studies suggest that targeting the pre-supplementary
motor area with low-frequency (1 Hz) TMS can be useful
[53,54]. In addition, targeting the anterior cingulate cortex
with high-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation with deep TMS
[55] may be effective in resistant OCD, but further
controlled studies are required to establish the efficacy of
this approach.

Conclusions
OCD is an often debilitating condition that is treatable.
Unfortunately, many patients hide their symptoms due to
shame, and much misdiagnosis and provision of ineffec-
tive treatment exists. Patients often suffer either in silence
or in ineffective treatment for many years. Even with
appropriate treatment, symptoms can wax and wane.
Initiation and continuation of appropriate treatment, the
mainstays of which are ERP and SRIs, is crucial. ERP is
recommended as first-line treatment for mild to moderate
symptoms as measured by the Y-BOCS. For more severe
symptoms or when ERP is not available, an SRI is
recommended as first-line treatment as SRIs are better
tolerated than clomipramine, although clomipramine
appears to be more effective than the SRIs. Several
pharmacological augmentation strategies exist, and radio/
neurosurgical procedures are reserved for documented
severe, treatment-refractory cases. We highly recommend
that clinicians and patients visit the International OCD
Foundation‘s website when searching for treatment provi-
ders or support groups (www.ocfoundation.org).
