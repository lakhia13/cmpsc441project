Abstract
Lithium  (Li+) is a first option treatment for adult acute episodes of Bipolar Disorder (BD) and for the prophylaxis of new 
depressed or manic episodes. It is also the preferred choice as maintenance treatment. Numerous studies have shown mor-
phological abnormalities in the brains of BD patients, suggesting that this highly heritable disorder may exhibit progressive 
and deleterious changes in brain structure. Since treatment with  Li+ ameliorates these abnormalities, it has been postulated 
that  Li+ is a neuroprotective agent in the same way atypical antipsychotics are neuroprotective in patients diagnosed with 
schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  Li+’s neuroprotective properties are related to its modulation of nerve growth factors, 
inflammation, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and programmed cell death mechanisms such as autophagy and 
apoptosis. Notwithstanding, it is not known whether  Li+—induced neuroprotection is related to the inhibition of its putative 
molecular targets in a BD episode: the enzymes inositol-monophosphatase, (IMPase), glycogen-synthase-kinase 3β (GSK3), 
and Protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, it is uncertain whether these neuroprotective mechanisms are correlated with 
 Li+’s clinical efficacy in maintaining mood stability. It is expected that in a nearby future, precision medicine approaches will 
improve diagnosis and expand treatment options. This will certainly contribute to ameliorating the medical and economic 
burden created by this devastating mood disorder.

Introduction

Bipolar Disorder (BD) (American Psychiatric Association. 
DSM-5 Task Force 2013) is a heritable mental illness (Stahl 
et al. 2019; Gordovez and McMahon 2020) characterized by 
cyclical disturbances in mood and behavior (Goodwin and 
Jamison 1990) and associated with well documented cortical 
brain abnormalities (Abe et al. 2020).

The efficacy of lithium  (Li+) as a first option treatment for 
adult manic episodes and for maintenance of Bipolar Dis-
order (BD) is now well established (Curran and Ravindran 
2014; Geddes et al. 2004; Severus et al. 2014; Licht 2012; 
Cousins et al. 2020). This is also the case for child and ado-
lescent BD (Hafeman et al. 2019).

Li+ is also the preferred treatment for the prophylaxis 
of new episodes, either depressive or manic (Geddes and 
Miklowitz 2013; Licht 2012; Goodwin 2002). Although 
some clinical guidelines consider antiseizure and neuroleptic 
agents alongside  Li+ as equally efficacious in BD (Graham

et al. 2018), many psychiatrists adopt  Li+ as the preferred 
first line treatment (NICE 2014; Goodwin 2002).

Being  a  Li+  responder  runs  in  families  (Grof  et  al. 
1993) and this appears to have a specific genetic signa-
ture: response to  Li+ is associated with genetic varia-
tions in glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1) 
(Chen et al. 2014). These facts led some authors to postu-
late a distinct type of BD based on response to  Li+ (Alda 
2015).

It  is  important  to  point  out  that   Li+  works  best  in 
patients exhibiting typical features of the disorder and that 
not every BD patient responds to  Li+ (Tighe et al. 2011). 
In fact, only one third of BD patients are full responders 
(Kessing et al. 2016) and this response achieves better effi-
cacy if treatment with  Li+ is initiated early in life (Kessing 
et al. 2014).

Taking into consideration such a variability of responses 
to  Li+, the Response to Lithium Network (R-LiNK) (Cous-
ins et al. 2020) has been formed to identify which patients 
will respond to  Li+ and also which ones will benefit from 
long-term treatment with this medication (see also (Pfennig 
et al. 2020).

This review focuses on neuroprotection, a term that is 
closely connected to the neurodegenerative disorders such 
as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or 
Huntington’s disease (HD) (Vajda 2002). These disorders are 
characterized by exhibiting a series of pathological changes 
in the brain that progress during the course of illness and 
ultimately lead to neuronal death, hence the term neuropro-
gression (Scearce-Levie et al. 2020).

Although research on neurodegenerative disorders has 
been  traditionally  reserved  for  pure  neurological  syn-
dromes, there is now evidence that the concept of neuro-
progression can also be applied to psychiatric entities such 
as the schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SCZ) or in BD 
(da Costa et al. 2016; Fries et al. 2012; Kapczinski et al. 
2017). SCZ and BD are characterized by progressive struc-
tural brain changes, functional and cognitive decline, and a 
vulnerability to relapse (Dodd et al. 2013). Genome-Wide 
Association Studies (GWAS) have identified a panoply of 
genes showing that BD shares common genetic risk factors 
with schizophrenia and other mental disorders (Gordovez 
and McMahon 2020).

I will briefly detail possible mechanisms of action of 
 Li+ in acute episodes of BD. Examples of neuroprogressive 
changes in BD brains will be given, and putative neuropro-
tective effects of  Li+ in vitro as well as in vivo on these 
neuroprogressive processes will be discussed.

It is important to point out that the connection between 
 Li+-induced neuroprotection in the human brain and the sus-
tained efficacy of this agent in the long- term treatment of 
BD remains unresolved.

Methods

I undertook a PubMed search updated to March 2021 incor-
porating search terms such as bipolar, mania, hypomania, 
 Li+, early intervention, prevention, neuroprogression and 
neuroprotection and using the Boolean operator AND.

An Example of Pharmacological‑Induced 
Neuroprotection

Pharmacological neuroprotection is defined as the preven-
tive effect of a medication on a neurodegenerative process 
that otherwise will inexorably progress in the absence of 
the medication.

Since their introduction in the 50’s, neuroleptic or antip-
sychotic medications have shown efficacy in the treatment of 
acute psychotic episodes and in the prevention of psychotic 
relapses (Leucht et al. 2009). However, long-term use of 
these medications raised concerns on damaging effects on 
the human brain (Gotzsche et al. 2015).

These  effects  include  brain  volume  loss  in  monkeys 
(Dorph-Petersen et al. 2005) and humans (Haijma et al. 
2013; Kubota et al. 2015) and upregulation of dopamine D2 
receptors (Muller and Seeman 1977). The latter has been 
associated with loss of efficacy of neuroleptics over time 
(Chouinard and Jones 1980).

Nonetheless, there is no substantial evidence that long-
term treatment with antipsychotics is deleterious to the brain 
(Goff et al. 2017). For a review on neuroprotective effects 
of second generation antipsychotic medications the reader is 
referred to a systematic review by Chen and Nasrallah (Chen 
and Nasrallah 2019).

We will apply these concepts of neuroprogression and 
neuroprotection when we discuss the effects of  Li+ in the 
BD brain. But I will first discuss possible mechanisms of 
action of  Li+ during a BD episode. This is because  Li+’s 
well described molecular targets (see next section) are pos-
sibly the first link in a series of putative metabolic cascades 
regulated by this monovalent cation.

Possible Mechanisms of Action of  Li+ in BD

The exact mechanism of action of  Li+ in BD remains largely 
unknown.  Li+ acts at molecular, cellular, and system levels, 
making a description of a single mechanism of action a daunt-
ing task (Alda 2015; Malhi et al. 2013; Haggarty et al. 2021).
The enzyme protein kinase C (PKC) is a molecular tar-
get for  Li+ (Saxena et al. 2017; Zarate and Manji 2009). 

1 3Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (2022) 42:85–97

The  term  PKC  designates  in  fact  a  family  of  enzymes 
expressed in mammalian brain structures involved in regu-
lating mood (Wetsel et al. 1992; Alessenko et al. 1992). 
PKCs are involved in many metabolic cascades modifying 
protein function and organizing signal propagation within 
the cell (Rosse et al. 2010). PKC signaling modulates pro-
cesses that could be operative in BD (Saxena et al. 2017).
PKC  activity  is  inhibited  by  Li+  (Zarate  and  Manji 
2009) both in vitro (Wang and Friedman 1989) and in vivo 
(Casebolt and Jope 1991) because it affects the transloca-
tion of the enzyme from the cytosol to the cell membrane, 
the region of the cell when it becomes active. Studies per-
formed in patients with BD in the manic phase showed that 
 Li+ inhibits PKC activity and its aforementioned transloca-
tion induced by serotonin (Friedman et al. 1993).

Support for the hypothesis of increased PKC signaling 
in BD was obtained from the use of the estrogen recep-
tor  modulator  tamoxifen  (TX).  This  drug  crosses  the 
blood–brain barrier (Carpenter et al. 2016) and inhibits 
PKC (Gunosewoyo et al. 2017). A proof-of-concept study 
showed the resolution of acute manic symptoms in BD 
patients treated with TX (Bebchuk et al. 2000). In the last 
20 years many papers have been published regarding the 
antimanic properties of TX (Amrollahi et al. 2011; Zarate 
et al. 2007). The reader is referred to detailed reviews 
(Novick  et  al. 2020;  Palacios  et  al. 2019;  Talaei  et  al. 
2016). To date, the FDA has not approved this promising 
drug for the treatment of manic episodes.

Li+ increases phosphorylation of glycogen synthase 
kinase 3ß (GSK3ß), an enzyme which is  involved in a 
signaling pathway that modulates apoptosis and synaptic 
plasticity (Carter 2007). Increased phosphorylation of this 
enzyme leads to its inactivation and is associated with 
decreased  excitotoxicity  (Carter 2007;  Haggarty  et  al. 
2021). Furthermore, gene expression of GSK3ß is cor-
related with response to  Li+ (Iwahashi et al. 2014).

Overexpression  of  GSK-3  correlates  with  neuronal 
degeneration (Lucas et al. 2001) and increases apoptosis 
(Bijur et al. 2000; King et al. 2001). The participation of 
GSK-3 in the therapeutic effects of  Li+ is not well deline-
ated. Instead,  Li+ affects several cellular systems that use 
G proteins and second messenger systems (prominently 
the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle) that are involved in 
intracellular signaling cascades involved in cell function-
ing (Berridge 2016; Berridge et al. 1989).

The most widely accepted hypothesis regarding  Li+ 
therapeutic efficacy in BD is the myo-inositol (henceforth 
inositol) depletion hypothesis. This posits that  Li+ exerts 
its  therapeutic  effects  by  depleting  inositol  in  specific 
areas of the brain. This stems from the pioneering work 
of Berridge who discovered signal transduction mecha-
nisms involving the PI cycle (Berridge et al. 1989; Ber-
ridge 2016).

Of all the postulated targets for the effects of  Li+ in the 
BD brain, I emphasize the PI cycle because it is a well-
researched effect in vitro, and the postulated mechanism of 
action can be extended to human studies (Jope et al. 1996; 
Kato et al. 1991; Moore et al. 1999; Pacheco and Jope 1996). 
See also (Sharpley et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2013).

The Inositol Depletion Hypothesis

I will briefly review here the PI cycle and its special rel-
evance to the mechanism of action of  Li+ in BD. For fur-
ther details, the reader is referred to comprehensive reviews 
(Berridge 2016; Berridge et al. 1989; Epand 2017; Harwood 
2005). The PI cycle is the major pathway for the synthesis 
of this phospholipid (and its phosphorylated forms), located 
at the cytosolic side of eukaryotic cell membranes (Dickson 
and Hille 2019).

Specific  first  messengers  (postulated  neurotransmit-
ters operative in a BD episode, especially GABA (Brady 
et al. 2013), dopamine (Berk et al. 2007) and glutamate 
(Beneyto et al. 2007; McCullumsmith et al. 2007) have 
been suggested as targeted by  Li+. Upon binding to their 
specific  membrane  bound  receptors,  these  messengers 
are linked via the  Gq protein to phospholipase C (PLC) a 
membrane bound enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate  (PIP2, a cell mem-
brane phospholipid) into inositol-1-4-5-triphosphate  (IP3) 
and diacylglycerol (DAG) (Figs. 1 and 2). The cycle pro-
ceeds clockwise for thermodynamical reasons and has as 
a distinctive characteristic: lipids are transferred between 

Fig. 1   An  extremely  simplified  diagram  showing  the  phosphati-
dylinositol  (PI)  cycle  as  occurring  in  two  separate  membranes:  the 
cell  plasma  membrane  (rectangle)  and  the  endoplasmic  reticulum 
(solid  oval).  For  a  more  comprehensive  description  of  the  cycle  see 
recent  reviews  (Epand  2017;  Harwood  2005).  PI,  a  plasma  mem-
brane  phospholipid  located  in  the  inner  leaflet  of  the  lipid  bilayer, 
undergoes  a  series  of  phosphorylations  to  become  Phosphatidylino-
sitol-4,5-biphosphate   (PIP2).  The  enzyme  phospholipase  C  (PLC) 
becomes active when membrane bound and gives two products from 
its substrate  PIP2: the lipid second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) 
which  remains  membrane  bound,  and  inositol-1-4-5  triphosphate 
 (IP3)  which  is  soluble  and  becomes  associated  with  ER  membranes. 
 IP3  is  sequentially  dephosphorylated  (not  shown).  The  last  enzyme 
in  this  sequence  of  dephosphorylations  is  inositol  monophosphatase 
(IMPase),  which  has  as  substrate  inositol  monophosphate  (IP),  thus 
regenerating inositol. PI synthase (an ER enzyme, not shown) forms 
PI of inositol

collapse and expansion, two processes that appear to depend 
on the presence of inositol.

Drugs clinically used as mood stabilizers such as  Li+, val-
proic acid, and carbamazepine were able to reduce the fre-
quency of the collapse of neuron growth cones. This effect 
was reversed by inositol, indicating that inositol depletion 
is the common mechanism for the three drugs and that ino-
sitol phosphate was implicated in the response to the mood 
stabilizers (Williams et al. 2002).

Further evidence of inhibition of IMPase as an important 
mechanism of action of  Li+ in BD came with the discovery 
of ebselen, a selenium-containing small molecule that has 
anti-inflammatory properties (Singh et al. 2013). Ebselen 
decreases inositol recycling in mice (Singh et al. 2013) and 
lowers the concentration of inositol in the anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC) of humans as measured by magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (Masaki et al. 2016; Singh et al. 2016). This 
suggests that the drug interacts with IMPase in the human 
brain.

Recently, a phase 2a randomized double-blind placebo-
controlled  trial  where  ebselen  was  added  to  anti-manic 
therapy (antipsychotics but not valproate, since the latter 
is known to inhibit inositol metabolism (Rosenberg 2007)) 
showed promising results on manic and hypomanic patients. 
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total scores were lower 
than when placebo was the add-on intervention (Sharpley 
et al. 2020).

As  mentioned  before,  to  date  the  involvement  of  the 
PI cycle in BD is well documented in vivo: this cycle is 
impaired in the brain of BD patients (Jope et al. 1996). The 
inositol transporter is overexpressed in BD and is downregu-
lated by  Li+ (Lubrich and van Calker 1999; van Calker and 
Belmaker 2000). Furthermore, there is an acute reduction 
of inositol induced by  Li+ in the right frontal lobe of BD 
patients (Moore et al. 1999) albeit this acute reduction is not 
associated with a clinical response (Moore et al. 1999). This 
may explain why  Li+ takes more that 2 or 3 weeks to exhibit 
efficacy, leaving open the hypothesis of a long-term effect of 
 Li+ that does not depend on inositol depletion.

Although the emphasis of this review is on the inositol 
depletion hypothesis, there are also effects of  Li+ in murine 
tissues that merit consideration since they open new avenues 
for human research. For example: dysregulation of mes-
olimbic dopamine neurotransmission has been implicated 
in BD, suggesting a hyper-dopaminergic state to explain 
the pathophysiology of the disorder (Ashok et al. 2017). 
In this respect, Ferrie et al. (Ferrie et al. 2008) showed that 
rats chronically treated with  Li+ had decreased dopamine 
release in the nucleus accumbens. This effect was not due to 
increased auto receptor sensitivity or to decreased firing rate 
of dopaminergic neurons (Ferrie et al. 2008).

Norepinephrine is another catecholamine implied in the 
mechanism of action of  Li+ (Kovács and Hernádi 2002). 

Fig. 2   Two important modulators of the PI cycle: (1) neurotransmit-
ters  (N)  which  bind  to  G  protein  coupled  receptors  (oblong  shape) 
and  activate  phospholipase  C  (PLC)  and  (2)   Li+  which  inhibits 
(crossed  circle)  IMPase,  thus  depleting  the  cell  from  inositol  (see 
text).  The  two  boxed  arrows  and  the  two  question  marks  represent 
still unknown downstream effects of  IP3 and DAG that may relate to 
cellular  mechanisms  operative  in  a  BD  episode.  Alternatively,  these 
metabolic  cascades  may  also  be  related  to  neuroprotective  mecha-
nisms. For more details see text

two membranes: the plasma membrane and the endoplas-
mic reticulum (ER) (Epand 2017) (see Fig. 1).

Both DAG and  IP3 are lipid second messengers: DAG 
remains membrane bound and activates protein kinase C 
(PKC) which as described above, is involved in initiating 
signal transduction cascades.  IP3 penetrates the cytosol 
and binds to a  Ca2+ channel in the endoplasmic reticu-
lum, promoting an efflux of  Ca2+ from this organelle. This 
efflux of  Ca2+ is also involved in initiating signal transduc-
tion cascades. It is hypothesized that the stimulus (neu-
rotransmitter N in Fig. 2) magnifies the abovementioned 
metabolic cascades which are implied in the genesis and 
maintenance of a manic episode and that are in mood regu-
lating areas of the brain.

A  series  of  phosphatases  dephosphorylate  IP3.  The 
enzyme inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) has inositol 
monophosphate (IP) as its substrate, regenerating inositol 
and ultimately  PIP2 which allows the cycle to be perpetu-
ated (Figs. 1 and 2).

Since the blood–brain barrier limits the availability of 
plasma inositol, inositol recycling as described above is 
critical for proper neuronal metabolism.

Among  many  other  actions,   Li+  inhibits  IMPase, 
restricting  recycling  of  inositol  and  depleting  neurons 
of this molecule (Berridge et al. 1989). After prolonged 
administration of  Li+, neurons have a reduced ability to 
re-synthesize  PIP2 after its hydrolysis has been initiated 
by neurotransmitter receptor activation (Fig. 2). This is 
the postulated beneficial effect of  Li+ in BD through its 
effects on IMPase.

In a very interesting paper by Williams et al. (Williams 
et al. 2002) the hypothesis of inositol depletion as a common 
mechanism of action for mood stabilizers was tested using 
cultured explants of sensory neurons from rat dorsal ganglia. 
The sensory neuron growth cone shows a phenomenon of 

1 3Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (2022) 42:85–97

 Li+ was iontophoretically applied to prefrontal cortical rat 
neurons located in the prelimbic cortical projection region. 
These neurons are targets for an ascending noradrenergic 
pathway. Single unit activity recorded from these neurons 
showed that  Li+ suppressed discharge activity from this 
pathway, suggesting that it modulates the activity of noradr-
energic neurons that target the prefrontal cortex (Kovács and 
Hernádi 2002).

Finally, an interesting effect of  Li+ on  Na+ and  K+ chan-
nels that modulate cortical excitability was shown using 
brain slices of the mouse olfactory bulb. Treatment in vitro 
with lithium depolarized mitral cells and blocked action 
potential hyperpolarization (Butler-Munro et al. 2010). This 
opens a window into the interesting relationship between BD 
and epilepsy (Knott et al. 2015).

Neuroprogression in Bipolar Disorder

Accumulated evidence shows that mood episodes in BD 
have a deleterious effect on the brain, albeit to date no clear-
cut neurodegenerative processes have been identified in BD 
brains (Frey et al. 2008; Sanches et al. 2008).

Compelling evidence from the Bipolar Disorder Working 
Group (Hibar et al. 2018) shows a cumulative degenerative 
effect of BD in the cortex of BD patients when compared to 
unaffected individuals, reinforcing the idea that neuropro-
gression is operative in the natural course of BD (Kapczinski 
et al. 2017).

The course of BD varies among patients (Passos et al. 
2016). Along the years, especially in cases of treatment 
non-adherence, there is a worsening in cognitive capacity, 
refractoriness to pharmacotherapy, and shorter inter-episode 
intervals (Bauer et al. 2017; da Costa et al. 2016; Kapczinski 
et al. 2017).

This neuroprogression in the BD brain can be staged as 
much as staging is used in other branches of medicine (Fries 
et al. 2012; Grande et al. 2014; Kapczinski et al. 2014; van 
der Markt et al. 2020; Vieta et al. 2011). These stages are 
generally labeled as prodromal, early, middle and late and 
have been associated with specific biomarkers (Teixeira 
et al. 2019).

Genetic factors, a family history of BD, and sub-thresh-
old mood and anxiety symptoms are characteristic of the 
prodromal phase. The other stages are associated with con-
spicuous biochemical changes: (1) activation of inflamma-
tory pathways (Leboyer et al. 2012) (tumor necrosis fac-
tor alpha (TNFa) and interleukin 10 (IL10), (2) oxidative 
stress  (glutathione  reductase,  glutathione  N-transferase, 
(Andreazza et al. 2009); (3) changes in serum neurotrophic 
factors (prominently decrease of brain derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) (Scola and Andreazza 2015), and (4) apop-
totic mechanisms leading to neuronal death (Uribe and Wix 

2012). This is correlated with reduced cortical thickness in 
the brain, as shown in the study by Hibar et al. (Hibar et al. 
2018). The following section deals with this type of evidence 
at the neuroanatomical level.

Evidence for Neuroanatomical Changes 
in BD Brains

Imaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and  neuropathological  examination  of  BD  brains  show 
decreased volumes in hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, 
and reduction of cortical thickness (Harrison et al. 2020; 
Hibar et al. 2018; Hibar et al. 2016; Kempton et al. 2011). 
Lyoo et al. (2006) reported decreased thickness in the dorso-
lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in BD patients. The struc-
tural changes in the amygdala may be related to progression 
of BD (Blumberg et al. 2005).

Diffusion tensor analysis shows changes in white matter 
tracts connecting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with 
the amygdala and the hippocampus, and the frontal lobe with 
the amygdala, the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the cin-
gulate gyrus. This suggests that BD patients have compro-
mised connections between frontal-subcortical and prefron-
tal lobe-limbic brain regions (Nortje et al. 2013; Wise et al. 
2016). A recently published systematic review confirmed 
that white matter abnormalities seen in BD patients could 
be prevented by treatment with  Li+ (Espanhol and Vieira-
Coelho 2021).

An MRI analysis of cortical volume, thickness, and sur-
face area suggested a difference between patients diagnosed 
with either type of BD as specified in DSM5 (BD I or BD 
II) (Abe et al. 2016). This type of study is particularly rel-
evant since both diagnoses present differently in clinical 
practice: while the manic episodes of BD I can be severe, 
persons with BD II do not show frank mania. Instead, they 
are depressed for longer periods of time and do not report 
their hypomanic episodes as often.

Most of the available studies on BD were performed on 
BD I and measured cortical volume. Abe et al. used MRI 
to analyze abnormalities in BD I and BD II patients and 
healthy controls and simultaneously measured cortical vol-
ume, thickness, and surface area to describe the neurobiol-
ogy underlying these two types of BD (Abe et al. 2016). 
Decreased cortical volume, thickness, and surface area were 
decreased in frontal, temporal, and medial occipital brain 
regions in both BD I and BD II patients as compared to 
controls. Interestingly, only BD I patients showed low corti-
cal volume and thickness in temporal and medial prefrontal 
areas as compared to BD II patients (Abe et al. 2016). This 
study provides evidence that both types of BD have real 
neurobiological differences and could serve as a template to 
develop biomarkers for this disorder.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the neu-
ropathology of BD (Harrison et al. 2020) shows that there 
is not a signature pathological lesion that distinguishes BD 
from other brain disorders. Instead, there is decreased cor-
tical thickness in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC), along with reduced neuronal density in some amyg-
dala nuclei and decreased density of calbindin-positive neu-
rons in the prefrontal cortex (Harrison et al. 2020).

Postmortem human brain studies have yielded interest-
ing results. There is dendritic spine loss in the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex of BD brains (Konopaske et al. 2014) and 
reduction in the expression profiles of cortical fast-spiking 
parvalbumin interneurons (Toker et al. 2018) and parvalbu-
min- and somatostatin-positive interneurons in the parahip-
pocampal region (Wang et al. 2011).

As mentioned before, the course of illness in BD is vari-
able, and progression is not always demonstrable in BD. 
From a practical point of view, the number of manic epi-
sodes is to date the best predictor of neuroprogression in BD 
(Passos et al. 2016).

The hippocampus of BD patients treated with  Li+ for 
2 years showed volumes that did not differ from those of 
normal persons. In contrast, BD patients with limited expo-
sure to  Li+ had lower hippocampal volumes as compared to 
healthy controls (Hajek et al. 2014, 2012b). Nevertheless, 
this effect of  Li+ on hippocampal volume is not correlated 
with the ability of  Li+ to prevent bipolar episodes (Hajek 
et al. 2014).

Interestingly,  patients  with  BD  which  were  naïve  to 
medication, and were acutely treated with  Li+ (1–8 weeks) 
showed a volumetric increase of the hippocampus, especially 
in its head, when compared to healthy controls (Yucel et al. 
2008). The same effects of  Li+ on the hippocampus were 
demonstrated using long-term (2–4 years) treatment with 
 Li+ (Yucel et al. 2007).

Compelling  evidence  regarding  protective  effects  of 
 Li+ in BD brains was obtained by the ENIGMA working 
group study performed on 6503 BD patients (Hibar et al. 
2018). Patients on  Li+ (and not on antiseizure or neuroleptic 
medications Hafeman et al. 2012; Hibar et al. 2018)) had 
increased cortical thickness when compared with patients 
not treated with  Li+.

Biomarkers can be Used to Track 
Neuroprotection Effected by  Li+

Measuring Brain Metabolites

Neuroprotective  effects  of  Li+  have  been  demonstrated 
in vitro and possibly in vivo (Alda 2015; Manji et al. 2000; 
Abe et al. 2020; Hibar et al. 2018). These can be evidenced 
using specific biomarkers such as: (1) imaging techniques 
that show morphological changes in BD brains, (2) proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy measuring metabolites 
such as N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamine plus gluta-
mate (GLx) that provide evidence for cytotoxic processes; 
and (3) measuring serum levels of neurotrophins (especially 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)).

Morphological Changes

Human grey matter is increased in patients treated with  Li+ 
(Moore et al. 2000). In this respect, the reader is referred to 
a meta-analysis by Sun et al. (Sun et al. 2018).

BD patients on  Li+ show greater grey matter density in 
the cingulate and paralimbic cortices as compared to healthy 
controls (Bearden et al. 2007) and an increase in subgenual 
ACC, hippocampus, insula, and amygdala (Germana et al. 
2010).

A study performed on patients that responded to  Li+ 
showed an increase in prefrontal and subgenual grey mat-
ter volume (Moore et al. 2009). A longitudinal study (Lyoo 
et al. 2010) showed that this  Li+-induced increase in human 
brain grey matter can be identified as an anatomical substrate 
of treatment response in BD (Lyoo et al. 2010).

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows for 
the quantitative noninvasive assessment of regional brain 
biochemistry (Novotny et al. 1998).

N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is a unique metabolite found 
in the vertebrate brain and second only in concentration to 
glutamate. It has been used in proton magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (Baslow 2003), and it was identified in neu-
rons (Simmons et al. 1991) as a putative marker of neuronal 
integrity (Baslow 2003).

Hajek et al. (Hajek et al. 2012a) showed that prefrontal 
NAA levels in  Li+-treated patients are comparable to those 
of healthy controls. This supports the notion for neuroprotec-
tive effects of  Li+ on prefrontal cortex in patients with BD 
(Hajek et al. 2012a).

Abnormal glutamatergic transmission in the frontal lobe 
has  also  been  implicated  in  the  BD  brain.  Proton  mag-
netic  resonance  spectroscopy  ((1)H-MRS)  studies  have 
reported increased levels of combined glutamate and glu-
tamine ("Glx"), which have been linked to impairments in 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function (Chitty 
et al. 2013, 2015). Finally, there is a probable direct effect 
of  Li+ on NMDA receptors (Amiri et al. 2020) that merits 
further inquiry.

Measuring Neurotrophic Factors

There are many in vitro pieces of evidence indicating that 
 Li+ regulates brain growth factors (Hashimoto et al. 2004) 

1 3Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (2022) 42:85–97 

91

and programmed cell death such as apoptosis (Dodd et al. 
2013) and autophagy (Motoi et al. 2014).   Li+ decreases 
apoptosis through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 
3β activity (Klein and Melton 1996).

The BNDF gene (Maisonpierre et al. 1991) is a risk locus 
for the development of BD (Neves-Pereira et al. 2002; Sklar 
et al. 2002). Additionally, chronic administration of  Li+ 
increases BDNF expression in rat brain (Fukumoto et al. 
2001).

Neurotrophins have been identified as participating in 
various stages of BD: BDNF, insulin-like growth factor 
(IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
are present at different stages of the disorder, suggesting 
the existence of BD subtypes (Scola and Andreazza 2015). 
Interestingly, BDNF levels are reduced in the serum of bipo-
lar patients while experiencing a manic episode (Machado-
Vieira et al. 2007).

Li+ differentially accumulates in brain regions known to 
be neurogenic (for example, the hippocampus). When  Li+ 
is administered for 28 days to juvenile mice, cell prolifera-
tion (but not neurogenesis) increases in their hippocampus. 
This was determined by the novel imaging procedure Time-
of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (Zanni et al. 
2017). Importantly, steady state serum concentrations of  Li+ 
were analogous to those clinically relevant for treating BD 
(around 1.2 mM).

A discussion of the mechanisms targeted by  Li+ that 
could  be  implicated  in  neuroprotection  are  detailed  in 
a review by Niciu et al. (Niciu et al. 2013). What is still 
unknown is how these effects are correlated with mood sta-
bilization and with the maintenance of  Li+ ‘s efficacy in the 
long-term treatment of BD.

Prophylactic Effects of  Li+: When to Treat

Early detection of BD and identifying its proper treatment 
mirrors the dilemmas emerging in treating SCZ patients. The 
most accepted model for SCZ is the neurodevelopmental 
hypothesis. This posits that interactions between multiple 
genes initiate a series of neuropathological events during 
gestation which progress into adolescence and adulthood, 
and that are influenced by environmental factors (Fatemi 
and Folsom 2009; Murray and Lewis 1987; Rapoport et al. 
2012).

The impetus for early detection and early intervention in 
psychosis (Fusar-Poli et al. 2020; Leopold et al. 2020) offers 
hope for treating this serious mental condition and serves as 
a template for other mental disorders such as BD.

Some authors suggest the existence of neurodevelop-
mental changes in BD. These may be expressed as premor-
bid neuro-behavioral changes demonstrated by neuroimag-
ing differences comparing the children of BD parents and 

age matched healthy controls (Sanches et al. 2008). An 
abnormal maturation of the brain structures involved in 
the regulation of affect has been postulated to explain the 
pathophysiology of BD (Sanches et al. 2008). However, 
the case for neurodevelopmental factors leading to neuro-
progression in BD is not as clear as it is the case for SCZ 
(Valli et al. 2019).

Having discussed the neuroprotective effects of  Li+ in BD 
patients, the question of a truly preventive or prophylactic 
use of  Li+ surges spontaneously. It is important to identify in 
the child and adolescent population and as accurately as pos-
sible, who will develop BD and who will respond to phar-
macological treatment (Cousins et al. 2020). As mentioned 
before, starting  Li+ early in life vs. starting late shows that 
early treatment improves BD outcomes (Kessing et al. 2016).
It remains a crucial clinical question how early psychia-
trists should treat BD with  Li+ and the associated ethical 
concerns need to be examined, as pointed in a paper by 
Ratheesh et al. (2017).

From a clinical standpoint, there are some indicators 
that suggest a diagnosis of BD: earlier age of onset (Lish 
et al. 1994), family history of bipolar disorder (Bowden 
2005; Hirschfeld et al. 2003; Manning et al. 1998) or fam-
ily history of lithium responsiveness in a first-degree rela-
tive (Manning et al. 1998). Multiple failed antidepressant 
trials, rapidly occurring episodes of recurrent depression, 
and history of prompt antidepressant response followed 
by sudden decline in response, have also been reported to 
suggest bipolarity (Perlis 2005).

Despite these clinical indicators, several factors conspire 
against an accurate diagnosis: (1) a young person may spend 
most of his/her life in depression (Kupka et al. 2007) and 
experience late onset of mania (Bolton et al. 2020; Dols 
and Beekman 2018); (2) differentiating between classical 
unipolar depression and bipolar depression still remains a 
dauting task (Cuellar et al. 2005) and because of this, (3) 
there are delays in diagnosis (Fritz et al. 2017).

Finally, comorbidities such as medical non-psychiatric 
conditions (Crump et al. 2013), personality disorders (Fan 
and Hassell 2008) and/or illicit drug use (Levin and Hen-
nessy 2004; Sherwood Brown et al. 2001) influence diag-
nostic and treatment decisions.

It is expected that in a nearby future, precision medicine 
approaches will improve diagnosis and expand treatment 
options (Cousins et al. 2020; Pfennig et al. 2020). This will 
certainly contribute to ameliorating the medical and eco-
nomic burden created by this devastating mood disorder.
