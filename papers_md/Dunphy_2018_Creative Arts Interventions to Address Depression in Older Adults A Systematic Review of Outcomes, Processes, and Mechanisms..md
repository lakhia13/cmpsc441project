Depression experienced by older adults is proving an increasing global health burden,
with rates generally 7% and as high as 27% in the USA. This is likely to signiﬁcantly
increase in coming years as the number and proportion of older adults in the population
rises all around the world. Therefore, it is imperative that the effectiveness of approaches
to the prevention and treatment of depression are understood. Creative arts interventions,
including art, dance movement, drama, and music modalities, are utilized internationally
to target depression and depressive symptoms in older adults. This includes interventions
led by trained arts therapists as well as other health and arts professionals. However,
to date there has not been a systematic review that reports effects and examines
the processes (why) and mechanisms (how) of creative arts interventions are used
to address depression in this older age group. This systematic review of studies on
creative arts interventions for older adults experiencing depression examined: outcomes
of four creative arts modalities (art, dance movement, drama, and music); with particular
attention paid to processes documented as contributing to change in each modality;
and mechanisms considered to result from these processes. Our analysis of 75 articles
(17 art, 13 dance, 4 drama, and 41 music) indicates mostly signiﬁcant quantitative or
positive qualitative ﬁndings, particularly for interventions led by creative arts therapists.
Mechanisms of change gleaned from the studies that were common across modalities
include physical
increased muscle strength; neurochemical effects, such as
endorphin release), intra-personal (e.g., enhanced self-concept, strengthened agency
(e.g., creative
and mastery; processing and communication of emotions), cultural
expression, aesthetic pleasure), cognitive (e.g., stimulation of memory), and social (e.g.,
increased social skills and connection), that were all considered to contribute to reduced
depression and symptoms. Recommendations for future research includes stronger
focus on testing of processes and mechanisms.

Systematic Review: Creative Arts Interventions

INTRODUCTION

The number and proportion of older adults in the population
has increased in virtually every country in the world over past
decades, because of increased life expectancy and decreased
fertility (United Nations Department of Economic Social Aﬀairs
Population Division, 2015). Current trends indicate an even
greater global population of older people in coming years, with an
estimated increase from about 12–22% (900 million to 2 billion)
between 2015 and 2050 (Naghavi et al., 2015; World Health
Organization, 2017b). Therefore, health issues impacting older
adults are likely to make a signiﬁcant contribution to the global
health burden in coming decades (United Nations Department of
Economic Social Aﬀairs Population Division, 2017).

Depression aﬀects approximately 7% of the world’s older
adults (World Health Organization, 2017a), with the highest
rates in countries including Australia (10–15%) (National Ageing
Research Institute, 2009) and USA (up to 27% with major
depression and 31% with depressive symptoms) (Mental Health
America, 2018). The most signiﬁcant challenges are faced by
older adults living in residential aged care, with rates as high
as 35% (National Ageing Research Institute, 2009). Depression
is three to four times more common in older people who have
dementia (Bennett and Thomas, 2014). While prevalence is the
same for both genders, functional disability causes by depression
is greater for men (Forlani et al., 2014).

Depression is identiﬁed as the fourth leading cause of
disability worldwide, and likely to be the second leading cause by
2020 (Murray and Lopez, 1996a,b). Depression leads to impaired
functioning in daily life and can cause great suﬀering (Fiske et al.,
2010). Depression also increases the perception of poor health,
and the utilization of health care services and costs. Older adults
with depressive symptoms have poorer functioning compared
to those with other chronic medical conditions and higher
rates of suicide. Mental health issues such as depression also
impact physical health and vice versa (Bruce et al., 1994; Mental
Health Foundation, 2018). Causes of depression are considered
to include reduced involvement in daily life activities. This may
be accompanied by self-critical thinking, which can exacerbate
a depressed state. Protective factors relevant for depression in
later life include age-related increases in psychological resilience,
higher education and socio-economic status, engagement in
valued activities, and religious or spiritual involvement (Fiske
et al., 2010).

(Beyond Blue, 2018; Department of Health, 2018). Psychology-
informed approaches (behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral
therapy,
cognitive bibliotherapy, problem-solving therapy,
brief psychodynamic therapy and life review/reminiscence
are indicated as eﬀective (see for example, Thompson et al.,

Abbreviations: AT, art therapy; DMT, dance movement therapy; DT, drama

disorder.

1987; Arean et al., 1993; Hsieh and Wang, 2003; Qualls and
Knight, 2006). Preventive interventions including education,
behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem-solving
skills training, group support, and life review have also received
support (Fiske et al., 2010).

Creative arts (CA) modalities, including dance movement,
drama, music, and visual arts, are also utilized internationally
to target depression and associated symptoms. These include
interventions by creative arts therapists (CAT) and by other
therapists and health and arts professionals. While no systematic
reviews have yet been published that examine research on
depression and older adults across the CATs, previous reviews
have been published for these modalities separately and for
diﬀerent age groups.

Two systematic reviews on art therapy (AT) and depression
indicate that, for an all ages sample, art therapy has been
utilized successfully (Blomdahl et al., 2013) and presents a
cost-eﬀective treatment model for mental health symptoms
(Stevenson et al., 2015). In dance movement therapy (DMT),
one systematic review of an all ages sample found that DMT
may be beneﬁcial for people experiencing depression, but without
certainty because of small number of studies and low quality of
evidence (Meekums et al., 2015). A meta-analysis of DMT studies
including a sub-analysis for depression concluded that DMT may
be eﬀective in decreasing clinical symptoms (Koch et al., 2014).
No systematic reviews on drama therapy (DT) for depression
were found.

In music and music therapy (MT), a signiﬁcant number of
reviews indicate this modality’s potential to support: reduced risk
(Daykin et al., 2018); prevention (Sun et al., 2013); and decreased
depression (Seinfeld et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2015; Innes et al.,
2016; Travers et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2016; Istvandity, 2017;
Quach, 2017; van der Steen et al., 2017). Yet other music reviews
reported no changes in depression (Ziv et al., 2008; Johnson et al.,
2013; Vasionyte and Madison, 2013; Petrovsky et al., 2015; Xu
et al., 2017).

A set of metaprocesses known as ‘common factors’ are
understood to support growth and change through therapy
(Ahessy, 2013). These common factors are largely informed
by humanistic approaches to therapy which emphasize client-
centered care (Rogers, 1951). They include therapeutic alliance,
safety, empathy, inclusion, and unconditional positive regard
(Wampold, 2001; Carr, 2008; Imel and Wampold, 2008).

While common factors are applicable to the creative
there are additional processes employed in
arts therapies,
these approaches. Other therapies often target only cognitive
processes, whereas the CATs seek to engage clients holistically
across
somatic, cognitive, emotional/intrapersonal, cultural
(creative/aesthetic), and social/interpersonal aspects of the self.
The integration of body and mind, or psyche, is a fundamental
process of both DMT (Meekums, 2002; Sherwood, 2008) and AT,
in which a “bodymind model” is proposed as a key contributor
to change on a more meta level (Czamanski-Cohen and Weihs,
2016). In DT, core processes that reﬂect a holistic approach have
been identiﬁed (Jones, 2007) along with metaprocesses (Cassidy
et al., 2014) such as establishing safety, working in the here and
now, being actively involved within or outside of the aesthetic

frame, and working alongside the client while oﬀering choice and
control.

Adaptability is another technique employed in common by
CA therapists, with methods, techniques, choices of medium and
intervention styles adapted by therapists to best support the needs
of each client or group, demonstrating responsivity to context
and “attunement” (Kossak, 2009, 2015; Vermes, 2011; Holck and
Geretsegger, 2016; Devereaux, 2017).

Finally, Koch (2017) has proposed key aesthetic processes
that further distinguish the arts therapies from other approaches,
such as intrinsic pleasure, authentic coherence, symbolism,
transitional practices, and generativity. The application of
processes that lead to and emerge from aesthetic expression are
fundamental and most distinguishing of CAs from other types of
therapy.

However, despite all this research, as yet there has not been
a systematic review of the literature on the impact of CA
interventions, both those that are led by CA therapists and
other professionals, on depression and depressive symptoms
in older adults and how these interventions are considered to
work.

OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTION

This article oﬀers a systematic literature review on the use of
creative arts interventions to target depression and depressive
symptoms in older adults. The article reports: outcomes of
interventions across four creative arts modalities (arts, dance
movement, drama, and music), for older adults experiencing
depression or depressive symptoms; interventions implemented;

RESEARCH QUESTION

Our overarching research questions are: What are the eﬀects of
creative arts interventions on depression or depressive symptoms
in older adults? How are these interventions understood to work?

METHODS

Study Design
Participants, Interventions, Comparators
This review examined studies about CA interventions, including
CA therapy,
intended to address depression or depressive
symptoms, in older adults, across four modalities: art; dance;
drama; and music; and combinations of these.

We examined studies utilizing all types of research methods
specify particular comparators.
and designs and did not
We entered our
review on the Prospero (International
prospective register of systematic reviews) register (Centre
for Reviews Dissemination, 2018) with registration number
CRD42018091901.

Systematic Review Protocol
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
This review included only articles that were:

• Published between 1.1.1997 and 1.2.18, in English language

only;

• Of research, deﬁned as investigation of a research question
informed by quantitative or qualitative data, or both, including
case studies and doctoral theses;

• Included only participants who were older adults (over 60
years, as per WHO deﬁnition) who had depression, as
deﬁned by DSM-V or ICD, and/or co-morbidity, or depressive
symptoms with or without other disorders;

• Utilized a CA modality as an intervention to address
such symptoms. This included CATs, which we deﬁne as
interventions led by a CA therapist who were identiﬁed in
the article as being trained or registered as a CAT in their
speciﬁc modality, and other CA interventions led by other
professionals;

• Locatable by the researchers.

Search Strategy
We used the advanced search function on OVID, including
databases: OVID Medliner (1946-present); CINAHL; EMBASE
(Excerta Medica database); Medline; PsychINFO; Cochrane
Central control trial register and Cochrane systematic reviews.

Search Terms
The following search terms were used:

• “depression” or “depress∗” or “MDD” (major depressive

disorder); “LLD” (late life depression)

• AND “older adults” or “old∗” or “gerontology” “geriatric∗” or
“late-life” or “aged care” or “aged” or “aging” or” “elderly”

Selection Process
The ﬁrst
search process, and round of decision-making
concerning inclusion-exclusion was undertaken by a junior
researcher with expertise in each ﬁeld [authors KC-H (AT),
ED (DMT), ME (DT), and JE (MT)]. The second process of
assessment against the data extraction points listed below was
undertaken by the same researcher, then cross-checked by a
senior researcher from each ﬁeld, authors: GK (AT); KD (DMT);
NS (DT); KM (DT), TW (MT), and FB (MT). Where decisions
between the two researchers were not concordant, discussion
between them was undertaken to reach ﬁnal agreement.

Data Analysis and Quality Assessment
Data analysis was undertaken in a staged process. First, all
abstracts found through our search were considered against
inclusion criteria listed above. This process is depicted in a
PRISMA ﬂow chart, provided in Figure 1.

Those ﬁtting the criteria suﬃciently were then analyzed and
data extracted in the categories of: Participants—number and
gender; Facilitator—training; Intervention—duration (number,
length, and frequency of sessions), control/comparison, activities
(what participants actually did); Outcomes—what and how
assessed; Therapeutic techniques (deﬁned as how the therapist
operates in the intervention); Processes (deﬁned as processes
seen to elicit change in the client); and Mechanisms (what occurs
within the client that results in change); and Study design.
Articles were then assessed for quality using COREQ (qualitative
studies) or PEDro tools (quantitative studies), or both tools
(mixed-method studies). The COREQ is a formal checklist for
evaluating the rigor and transparency of reporting in qualitative
research, particularly for interviews and focus groups (Tong
et al., 2007). The PEDro tool comprises elements agreed as
suitable for quality assessment of RCT studies (Verhagen et al.,
1998). One point was scored for each element of the study that
met the criteria and these were tallied to arrive at a quality score
for each study.

RESULTS

approaches of these comprised: ﬁve qualitative studies, mostly
individual case studies (de Guzman et al., 2011; Hoﬀmann,
2013) and interview methods; three mixed-methods; and nine
quantitative studies, including comparisons of art therapy with
other health interventions such as walking, music therapy,
exercise, nature-based therapies, and community craft activities.
Depression was addressed as a primary symptom (5/17); and as
a co-morbid condition with Parkinson’s disease (1/17), stroke
(2/17), and dementia (2/17). Three studies focused on women
because of the reported higher prevalence of depression with this
population (3/17).

Qualitative studies scored between 1 (2/5) and 8 (1/5) out
of 11 on PEDro. The limitations of these studies included
inadequate reporting details in data collection and lack of rigor
in measures to ensure credibility in data analysis. Quantitative
and mixed method studies scored between 4 (1/12) and 16
(2/12) out of 32 on COREQ. The main shortcomings of these
studies were that samples were not randomized, blinded, or
adequately powered. They tended to be small in scope and
lacking rigorous eﬀorts to ensure validity in the ﬁndings.
The majority did not include adequate details on method to
enable replication. No art studies reported any results from
follow up.

Eleven/Seventeen studies were led by an art therapist, 2/17
by another professional; and 4/17 had a leader of unknown
training. Twelve studies had signiﬁcant ﬁndings: 8/12 led by an
art therapist, 1/12 by another professional and 3/12 by a leader of
unknown training.

Interventions
Art programs were typically sessions of an hour, held once or
twice a week over periods from 12 to 52 weeks. Interventions
were typically oﬀered as group format, with speciﬁc attention
provided by therapists to individual group members. Two
interventions were one on one programs (de Guzman et al., 2011;
Hoﬀmann, 2013).

Art media options and activities included traditional crafts
and arts (de Guzman et al., 2011; Ciasca et al., 2018) and
clay and painting. For example,
in one task, participants
manipulated clay into a ball, divided it into parts and re-
assembled it into another object, then shared their experiences
in verbal discussion (Goldblatt et al., 2010). Choices of media
were frequently discussed as important, particularly because of
challenges identiﬁed with patients’ physical mobility and ﬁne
motor control.

Therapeutic Techniques
The therapeutic techniques reported in the art studies included
the therapist being encouraging of participants’ expression and
learning through art making, sensitive to individual needs,
encouraging of interaction and pro-social experiences between
group members.

Art Results
Summary of Studies and Quality Assessment
Seventeen art studies from an initial sample of 34 met
inclusion criteria as detailed in Table 1. Methodological
all

Proposed Mechanisms of Change
Based on the processes identiﬁed in the literature, we propose
that the mechanisms of a change for depressive symptoms
through art interventions are:

• Physical: engagement in a creative activity that had physical
aspects was seen to catalyze relaxation and reduction of stress
(Canuto et al., 2008; Goldblatt et al., 2010; Lam, 2015; Hsu
et al., 2017)

• Cultural: the making of art was seen to facilitate creative
expression and play (de Guzman et al., 2011; Kim H.-K. et al.,
2016); the use of context-responsive creative expression was
seen as signiﬁcant; creative expression was enabled by use of
accessible media of clay and painting (Goldblatt et al., 2010);
evocation of familiarity and positive memories was catalyzed
by use of culturally appropriate traditional crafts and arts (de
Guzman et al., 2011; Ciasca et al., 2018)

• Emotional/intrapersonal: creation of art products was seen
to provide valuable distance, and enable externalization
and visual communication of inner subjective experiences
(Goldblatt et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2010; Dr˘aghici, 2012;
Choi and Jeon, 2013; Ali et al., 2014; Im and Lee, 2014; Hsu
et al., 2017; Ciasca et al., 2018); expression of positive and
negative emotions (Kang et al., 2010; Ali et al., 2014; Im and
Lee, 2014; Kim H.-K. et al., 2016; Kongkasuwan et al., 2016);
promotion of autonomy (Doric-Henry, 1997; Canuto et al.,
2008; Goldblatt et al., 2010; Ceramidas, 2012; Kongkasuwan
et al., 2016); and positive views of self (Canuto et al., 2008;
de Guzman et al., 2011; Dr˘aghici, 2012; Rawtaer et al., 2015;
Kongkasuwan et al., 2016; Ciasca et al., 2018); agency and
mastery was seen to be strengthened by the act of completing
an art piece (Doric-Henry, 1997; de Guzman et al., 2011;
Hoﬀmann, 2013; Lam, 2015; Ciasca et al., 2018)

• Cognitive: art-making was seen to enable: reinforcement and
recall of positive memories (Canuto et al., 2008; Choi and Jeon,
2013; Hoﬀmann, 2013; Kim H.-K. et al., 2016); addressing
of concerns around death, loss and end of life (de Guzman
et al., 2011; Ali et al., 2014); and distraction from ruminative
thoughts (Goldblatt et al., 2010; Ciasca et al., 2018)
• Interpersonal: group work (with or without

therapist’s
involvement) was seen to encourage socialization and sharing
(Canuto et al., 2008; de Guzman et al., 2011; Ceramidas, 2012;
Dr˘aghici, 2012; Choi and Jeon, 2013; Ali et al., 2014; Im and
Lee, 2014; Lam, 2015; Rawtaer et al., 2015; Kim H.-K. et al.,
2016; Kongkasuwan et al., 2016).

Dance Movement Results
Summary of Studies and Quality Assessment
Thirteen studies met all inclusion criteria from an initial sample
of 29 as detailed in Table 2. Studies were predominantly RCTs
(6/13); with quasi-experimental (3/13); and single condition over
two or three time periods (4/13). Only one of the 13 studies was
focused on depression as a primary diagnosis, with the other 12
addressing depressive symptoms.

Quality scores using PEDRO were evenly spread between 2
and 9 out of 11. Eleven of these studies were led by another
professional; two by a leader of unknown training; and none by
a dance movement therapist. This was despite several studies
stating that the intervention was dance movement therapy,
while providing no indication that a certiﬁed DM therapist was
involved. One study (Cross et al., 2012) claimed to be DMT and
included information about DMT in the literature review, but

Systematic Review: Creative Arts Interventions

then described an intervention of clients watching professional
dancers that seemed to have no relationship at all with DMT
principles. In fact, no studies involving dance movement therapy
were included in our ﬁnal sample. Ten studies had signiﬁcant
ﬁndings: nine led by professional who was not a dance movement
therapist, and one by a leader of unknown training.

Limitations of the dance studies included small sample sizes,
with almost half having an n of 20 or less. Low PEDro scores
was mostly caused by lack of concealment of allocation, lack
of blinding of participants, therapists and assessors, and lack
of random allocation. Another limitation was that few studies
(4/13) included a mention of follow-up component. One study
(Vankova et al., 2014) mentioned an improvement in GDS scores
in one follow up (5.0–4.5), however, this data was not included
in the results. Another study (Matto et al., 2015) reported
follow up results indicating a decrease in GDS scores (2.44–
2.19), supported by interviews with participants about their
enjoyment in being part of the group where self-expression
and understanding, appreciating and being sensitive to others
was a commonly valued experience (p. 280). Two other studies
mention a follow up but do not report results (Haboush et al.,
2006; Jun et al., 2013).

Interventions
Programs oﬀered were typically sessions of between 30 and
90 min, with 60 min being most common; held between one
and three times weekly, most often twice; for periods from
one week to 15 months, most often 8 weeks. Interventions
were typically oﬀered as group sessions, with speciﬁc attention
provided by trained therapists to individual group members.
One study described a one on one program. Interventions were
primarily focused on the acquisition and repetition of dance
steps, including western dance styles such as jazz, contemporary
and ballroom, as well as traditional and folk dances. Session
structure most frequently was a brief warm up, then teaching
of dance steps, followed by a ﬁnal cool down which sometimes
included relaxation.

Therapeutic Processes
The dance studies did not include much discussion about
therapeutic processes, perhaps because none of the studies
examined was led by a dance movement therapist. This was
in contrast to other modalities where the majority of studies
involved CA therapists. There was a strong emphasis on physical
outcomes, particularly in the area of functional mobility. This was
presumably because the studies were mostly facilitated by dance
instructors and physical therapists who emphasized functional
performance as a primary concern, which they addressed through
programs that involved the acquisition of dance skills. In several
studies, changes in clients’ physical state through dance, such
as improved balance and strengthened muscles, was seen to be
related to reduced symptoms of depression, even though this
had not been the central focus of the intervention. For example,
Britten et al. (2017) reported reduced falls-risk as a result of dance
participation, which was seen in turn to have positive impact on
mood states such as depression. However, causal pathways were
generally not articulated clearly or trialed in these studies.

Several studies included comment on the greater acceptance of
dance-based interventions by women than men, thus explaining
more successful engagement, stronger adherence, and better
outcomes of female participants in many interventions.

Proposed Mechanisms of Change
Based on the processes identiﬁed in the literature, we propose
that the mechanisms of a change for depressive symptoms
through dance interventions are:

• Physical:

improved physical performance and function
and
strength,

sense

joint

including balance, muscle
proprioception;

• Cultural: enjoyable aesthetic experiences;
• Cognitive: cognitive decline slowed through exercise and
stimulation of brain circuits used to learn dance steps;
activation of motor neurological brain regions through
improvised or expressive movement that may contribute to
changes in brain structure;
social
positive

and
enhancement of communicative and relational capacities
through shared experiences in dance.

engagement,

stimulation

• Social:

Drama Results
Summary of Studies and Quality Assessment
Four studies met all inclusion criteria from an initial sample
of 25 as detailed in Table 3. Methodological approaches
included one quasi-experimental study (Keisari and Palgi, 2017),
one mixed method (Wilkinson et al., 1998), two qualitative
studies employing a combination of ethnographic observation,
qualitative interviews, and practice reﬂections (Kontos et al.,
2017) and one collaborative discourse analysis (Sajnani et al.,
2018). One study addressed depression as the primary diagnosis
(Keisari and Palgi, 2017), while the other three addressed
depressive symptoms.

The two studies employing quantitative methods scored
between 8 and 9 out of 11 on PEDro. The limitations of these
studies were that samples were small and not randomized or
blinded. The two qualitative studies met between 19 and 21
elements of 32 in COREQ. The limitations of these studies
included inadequate reporting of details in data collection, and a
lack of reported eﬀorts to increase the trustworthiness of ﬁndings.
The main shortcoming overall was the lack of detail on the
method and activities used that would enable replication.

Two interventions were led by a drama therapist, one by a
drama therapist with another professional, and one by other
professionals (elder clowns). Of the studies involving drama
therapists, one reported signiﬁcant quantitative ﬁndings and
two reported no statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings but positive
qualitative outcomes. The study led by elder-clowns reported
positive qualitative outcomes. No follow up data was provided
for any of these studies.

Interventions
Programs oﬀered by drama therapists were typically group
sessions of between 45 and 105 min for an average of 80 min, held
once weekly, for 12 weeks. One study facilitated by elder clowns
involved two clowns per individual resident for 10 min twice

Systematic Review: Creative Arts Interventions

weekly. Interventions involved therapists’ technique of empathic
attunement, and activities involving mirroring, doubling, and
role-reversal, dramatic embodiment of inner conﬂicts, dramatic
projective in the form of roleplay and enactment. Session
structure in group interventions typically involved a warm up, a
main action and a closure phase. One on one sessions conducted
by elder clowns involved techniques of aﬀective attunement and
humor, and activities involving reciprocal play.

Therapeutic Processes
Each study that included drama therapy involved therapeutic
techniques derived from meta-processes (Cassidy et al., 2014)
including the therapist being involved while working in the here
and now alongside clients, the establishment of safety through
the choice of techniques and clients being oﬀered control and
choice to enable them to exercise initiative and creativity. Other
core processes, as identiﬁed by Jones (2007), included play,
dramatic embodiment, dramatic projection, personiﬁcation, and
impersonation (role-play), empathy and distancing, life-drama
connection, witnessing, and transformation. These were used to
facilitate clients’ short and long term goals. For example, in the
study involving drama therapy and life review, stories of group
members were embodied by other group members who took on
the roles identiﬁed in the single group member’s story and created
dramatic images. This was intended to enable the story owner to
“gain new perspectives about their life decisions and deepen their
understanding of the associations between these decisions, in a
way that gives rise to a more positive identity” (Keisari and Palgi,
2017, p.1080).

The core processes used to activate internal resources and
externalize internal conﬂicts were discussed by Sajnani et al.
(2018). Wilkinson et al. (1998), reported activities being chosen to
stimulate reminiscence, socialization, and “provide opportunities
for more organized self-expression through the use of metaphor”
(p. 195). In the study in which elder clowns interacted with
older adults, the primary processes described were (a) aﬀective
relationality; (b) reciprocal playfulness; and (c) co-constructed
imagination.

Proposed Mechanisms of Change
The studies reviewed suggest that shifts in depressive symptoms
that
catalyzed by
mechanisms of change such as:

from drama

are

• Physical:

engagement

activity
contributing to sense of vitality and regulated, relaxed
breathing;

in

• Cognitive: orientation to past and present, reinforcement
of positive coping strategies, coherent organization of self-
expression, increased memory recall, facilitation of meaning
making;

• Emotional/intrapersonal: use of metaphors, roles, and playful,
embodied enactments providing a suitable distance to activate
internal resources and externalize and communicate inner
conﬂicts and strengths, and facilitate emotional regulation;
• Social: individual and group activities prompting increased

positive social interaction.

Music Results
Summary of Studies and Quality Assessment
Forty-one studies met all inclusion criteria from an initial sample
of 91 as detailed in Table 4. Depression was addressed as a
primary diagnosis in 21 studies and as secondary diagnosis and
depressive symptoms in 20 studies.

Sample sizes ranged between 1 and 12.576, with a mean
sample of 379. Only six of the 41 studies included follow ups,
undertaken after 3 or 6 months, all amongst most recent studies
(Coulton et al., 2015; Kim H. et al., 2016; Sánchez et al., 2016;
Särkämö et al., 2016; Pongan et al., 2017; Ray and Mittelman,
2017).

The quantitative studies scored between 4 and 11 on PEDro,
and the one qualitative study met 29 of 32 elements in COREQ.
Twelve interventions were led by a music therapist, 23 led by
another professional; and six by a leader of unknown training.
Twenty-six studies had signiﬁcant ﬁndings: nine of these were led
by a music therapist, twelve by another professional, and a further
ﬁve had a leader of unknown training. Fifteen of the 26 music
studies with signiﬁcant ﬁndings were assessed as having high
quality ﬁndings (8–11/11 on PEDro). The other six studies were
assessed as being of low quality, with missing elements including
blinding, similarity at baseline, concealed allocation, and clear
randomization.

Interventions
Programs oﬀered were sessions of between 15 and 360 min, with
30–60 min being most common; held between once weekly and
daily, most often weekly or twice per week; for periods from one
day to 24 months, most often 10–12 weeks.

Very diﬀerent methods and intervention types were included
in treatment. Most frequently reported interventions in the 26
studies with successful outcomes were receptive music therapy
and music listening (17). In nine studies, mixed intervention
types (between two and ﬁve types) were included in treatment.
Instrumental play and improvisation were also utilized in nine
studies. In eight studies,
individualized individual preferred
music or reminiscence were also included with music listening
or singing. In six studies, the intervention type was singing, and
music movement was included in six studies as well. Activities
were selected due to theoretical models or ﬁndings of therapeutic
processes or mechanisms of change described in the following
paragraphs.

Therapeutic Processes
Therapeutic processes described in the music studies were
closely linked to mechanisms of change. These processes
focussed on physical activation, processing of emotion and social
relationships. Physical activation was seen to be activated through
rhythmic patterns (including march rhythms in 4/4 time),
physical reaction to emotions and improvement of movement.
Processing of emotions supported changes from feelings of anger
and fear to increased positive emotions and emotional responses
including stimulation of happy memories, subjects’ interests,
preferred autobiographical music, and musical interests, and
enjoyment through activation of the limbic and paralimbic
systems. Processes relating to social relationships are described

as interaction through playing of instruments, promotion of
empathic relationships, increased communication, and reduced
social isolation.

Proposed Mechanisms of Change
The studies reviewed suggest that shifts in depressive symptoms
resulting from engagement in music and music therapy are a
result of mechanisms of change across several domains:

• Physical: neurophysiological and neurochemical eﬀects, such
as endorphin release, stimulation of cognitive functioning i.e.,
reminiscence and activation of amygdala, hippocampus, and
nucleus accumbens;

• Cultural (creative/aesthetic): processing of music stimuli in
rhythm and pitch, musical experience including movement,
physiological functioning, and imitating of musical rhythm;

• Intrapersonal:

improvement of well-being, activation of
remaining capabilities, self-eﬃcacy, validation,
increase of
autonomy, and self-conﬁdence developed through experiences
of success;

• Social:

improvement of

interaction skills and relational
abilities, to trigger interpersonal relationship, to stimulate
social participation.

DISCUSSION

This review reveals signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the creative
arts modalities with respect to research quantity, type and quality.
The number of studies about music interventions (n = 41) was
signiﬁcantly more than other modalities, i.e., art (n = 17), dance
(n = 13), and drama (n = 4). Types of research were clearly
distinct between modalities, with 40 of the 41 music studies,
and all 13 dance studies being quantitative research, while art
studies included predominantly quantitative, but also qualitative
and mixed-methods studies, and the small number of drama
studies involved qualitative, mixed-methods, and quantitative
approaches. This indicates a need for more research in the
creative arts therapy modalities that are as yet under-represented
in the literature. While 13 dance studies were included in this
review, none of those interventions was actually led by a dance
movement therapist, so the need for more research in dance
movement and drama therapy is particularly evident.

Quality issues diﬀered between the modalities. Art therapy
studies were found to be of medium quality with the main issues
in quantitative studies being small sample size, a general lack of
generalizability and a lack of rigorous eﬀorts to ensure validity in
the ﬁndings. Issues in qualitative studies in art therapy also relate
to a lack of rigor to ensure creditable data analysis and inadequate
reporting in data collection. This diﬀers somewhat to the dance
movement studies, which were largely RCTs and scored across
the range from low to high on the PEDro scale roughly evenly.
Quality issues for this modality relate to the lack of actual DMT
interventions. Dance was the only modality for which this was an
issue. Drama studies scored middle to high, with quality relatively
high for quantitative studies (8 and 9/11 on PEDro), but lower
for qualitative studies (19 and 21/32 on COREQ). Music studies
scored high more consistently. Very few of the studies included
follow up: art (0); dance 4/13; drama (0); and music 6/41.

The sections to follow discusses some of the most salient

ﬁndings about each modality.

Art
The choice of art media that is culturally relevant to the
participant was
repeatedly found to be a key factor of
engagement. The fact that art interventions examined were
at least 12 weeks long indicates that longer-term approaches
might be most eﬀective with this population. In consideration
of the many mental and physical challenges faced by older
adults, longer-term approaches might be more congruent with
relationship building and sustaining the outcomes of art therapy.
The eﬀectiveness and impact of short-term programs remains to
be studied. Future studies might also examine how personalized
use of traditional art media might contribute to client outcomes.
The quality of most art intervention studies was scored as
medium to low (based on PEDRO and COREQ scores) with few
studies eﬀectively randomizing participants and/ or providing
adequate details in the methodology.

Dance
The dance studies primarily focussed on the learning of dance
steps and sequences, and repetition of these across sessions.
Dance movement therapy, in contrast, often does not include
the learning of structured steps, but rather prioritizes more
improvised and expressive dance experiences. However, the
eﬀectiveness of learning of steps for amelioration of depression
and its symptoms evidenced in these studies may point to it being
a worthwhile consideration for DM therapists, especially for this
older adult age group. One issue arising in the dance studies was
the perception by participants and possibly program hosts that
dance interventions are more suitable for women. As the rate of
depression is the same for men and women, and its functional
impacts are greater for men, this indicates a challenge, with an
eﬀective modality not potentially being considered by 50% of the
people impacted by depression.

The quality of dance studies was varied, with ratings evenly
distributed from the lowest to highest PEDro scores. Lower
scoring studies were often missing elements of blinding of
subjects, therapists, and assessors, and concealment of allocation.

Drama
While few in number,
the three studies involving drama
therapists indicated that positive outcomes could be achieved in
programs of 12 weeks in length. The ﬁndings of these studies were
consistent with recent literature in drama therapy emphasizing
the beneﬁts derived from opportunities for playful interaction
and the externalization of signiﬁcant experiences through drama;
these processes were found to reinforce internal resources and
contribute to a sense of generativity (see Jennings, 2018).

Music
Twenty-six of the 41 music studies demonstrated signiﬁcant
ﬁndings in treatment of depression and depressive symptoms.
The most eﬀective interventions were provided by trained

Systematic Review: Creative Arts Interventions

signiﬁcant ﬁndings. Thus, interventions led by music therapists
appeared more suitable than those led by other professionals
for treatment for depression and for depressive symptoms of
older adults. Eﬀective interventions were diverse and included
receptive music therapy and music listening, mixed intervention
types, instrumental play and improvisation, and individualized,
individual preferred music or reminiscence in music listening or
singing.

Methodological Issues
We began this review with the intention of exploring the eﬀects
of creative arts interventions on older adults experiencing
relationships documented between
depression, as well as
intervention activities, therapeutic processes, and mechanisms
seen to lead to outcomes. However, this second task proved
not to be straightforward, with studies often not providing
adequate (or any) discussion about processes or mechanisms
that were expected or elicited through interventions. In articles
that did discuss processes or mechanisms, claims were largely
not substantiated with data. Other studies appeared to have
been predicated on theories of change about outcomes expected
from activities and associated therapeutic processes but did
not explicate these. This was particularly evident in the dance
studies, where there was much focus on physical movement,
without speciﬁc articulation of the well-evidenced relationship
between physical exercise and reduced depression or depressive
symptoms.

This ﬁnding gives rise to a consideration that we did not assess
one important quality point, that of the quality of interventions.
Given that the quality of an intervention is likely to signiﬁcantly
impact ﬁndings, this would seem an appropriate and relevant
process. While we scored the methodological quality of studies
using COREQ and PEDro tools, this process did not oﬀer
any insight about how well-considered interventions appeared,
how well substantiated they were from theory or evidence, or
whether justiﬁcation for activities or processes to be employed
was adequate. Thus, an additional quality process we recommend
would be for the assessment of the quality of choices made
and processes employed. The use of manualised interventions
or descriptions of clear intervention protocols may contribute to
better practice in this respect.

Another methodological challenge was the lack of discussion
in the studies examined of the relationship between expected
outcomes and speciﬁc symptoms of depression as identiﬁed in
DSM-V or ICD manuals. We had initially tried to align outcomes
of studies with these formally identiﬁed symptoms, but few
studies speciﬁcally mentioned addressing these. We recommend
that future studies pay speciﬁc attention to identiﬁed symptoms
of depression.

One risk of bias in this study is the fact that all authors are
creative arts therapists. We attempted to minimize bias caused
by this factor by ensuring that at least two authors were involved
in extracting data from each study and that they double checked
each other’s work. Other strategies we employed for reducing bias
were the inclusion of all studies, those with signiﬁcant and non-
signiﬁcant ﬁndings, and adherence to strict inclusion criteria.

An additional limitation for research that was considering
creative arts broadly was that our study did not include studies
on writing, or the broader categories of expressive and creative
arts that were not modality speciﬁc. Future research may be best
to include these topics.

Recommendations for Further Research
Our ﬁrst recommendation for future research is for studies
that meet quality standards for both quantitative or qualitative
approaches, given that so many of the studies we examined did
not. Our ﬁndings indicated a signiﬁcant need for well designed,
detailed studies of the impact of all creative arts therapies in the
targeted treatment of depression in older adults.

We recommend that future studies include more speciﬁc focus
on how interventions work, as well as if they work, given the
under-development of theories of change about how creative arts
interventions are seen to be eﬀective in addressing depression
in studies reviewed, and the lack of clear explication and
testing of processes and mechanisms considered to contribute
to therapeutic outcomes. In addition, the diﬀerences between,
and sequencing of, individual and group interventions remain
understudied.

Creative arts therapies are increasingly being oﬀered as part of
a range of complementary therapies in integrative care settings.
However, no studies examined their cost eﬀectiveness, either
comparing creative arts modalities with each other, or between
CA modalities and other therapeutic approaches. This prompts
a recommendation for future inquiry, which would increase
understanding of how creative arts interventions, including CA
therapies, might be utilized as psychosocial prescriptions to
increase eﬀectiveness and reduce costs of healthcare of older
adults. Increased collaboration between creative art therapy
researchers could also be useful for improving research outcomes.
Future studies could also examine how new technology like
virtual reality and telehealth might contribute to the potential of
creative arts interventions for the health of older adults.

Implications for Practice
Given our ﬁndings that interventions led by certiﬁed creative
arts therapists resulted in more signiﬁcant or positive outcomes
than interventions led by other professionals, we recommend
that interventions for depression with older adults be provided
by certiﬁed creative arts therapists. Because relatively few
interventions included developed theories of change about
interventions chosen, processes implemented and the expected
relationship with these and changes in depressive symptoms, we
consider that clinical practice may be similarly improved with
better articulation of all of these considerations in the planning
and delivery of interventions for depression.

CONCLUSION

This review examines evidence for the eﬀects of creative
interventions on depression and depressive symptoms
art
of older adults. The majority of 51 of
the 75 studies
examined demonstrated either signiﬁcant quantitative or positive
qualitative ﬁndings (12/17 of art, 10/13 of dance, 4/4 of drama

and 26/41 of music, and music therapy). The quality assessment
of these studies diﬀered between disciplines, with medium quality
in art studies, the full range from low to high in dance studies,
middle to high in in drama therapy, and high in the majority of
studies with signiﬁcant ﬁndings in music. Certiﬁed art therapists
were involved in the majority of studies with signiﬁcant ﬁndings:

music therapists and 12/23 studies involving other professionals.

Mechanisms of change gleaned from the studies include

strength;
neurochemical eﬀects, such as endorphin release), intra-personal
(positive views of self; strengthened agency and mastery;
communication and processing of emotions; coping strategies),
cultural
(creative expression, aesthetic pleasure), cognitive
(stimulation of memory), and social (increased social skills and
connection) elements that were all considered to be causal in
reduced depression and symptoms. Recommendations for future
research includes stronger focus on trialing of processes and
mechanisms, considerations of the value of short vs. longer term
therapy, and cost-eﬀectiveness of creative arts therapy modalities
in comparison with each other as well as with other type of
therapeutic treatment.
