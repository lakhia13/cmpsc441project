Abstract: (1) Background: In clinical trials, dietary magnesium use can improve insomnia symptoms.
However, little is known about the association between dietary magnesium consumption and sleep
disorder symptoms including daytime falling asleep, sleepiness and snoring at the population level.
(2) Methods: We used data from 1487 adults aged 20 and above attending the Jiangsu Nutrition Study.
At baseline in 2002, dietary magnesium was assessed by 3-day weighed food records. At follow-up
in 2007, sleep disorder symptoms, including daytime falling asleep, sleepiness and snoring at
night, were gathered using a sleep questionnaire. (3) Results: The mean intake of magnesium was
332.5 mg/day. In total, 5.3%, 13.2% and 35.7% of the subjects reported daytime falling asleep, daytime
sleepiness, and snoring during sleep, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile of magnesium
intake, the highest quartile was associated with decreased likelihood of falling asleep (odds ratio
(OR) 0.12 (0.02, 0.57)) in women but not in men after adjusting for demographic, anthropometric,
lifestyle factors, hypertension, and overall dietary patterns. No associations were found between
dietary magnesium intake and daytime sleepiness nor night snoring in either gender. (4) Conclusions:
Dietary magnesium intake may have long-term beneﬁts in reducing the likelihood of daytime falling
asleep in women.

Keywords: dietary magnesium; daytime falling asleep; Chinese adults

1. Introduction

Sleep and wake cycle is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which also
coordinates the circadian rhythms in other tissues through the body [1]. Poor quantity and quality of
sleep have been suggested to be adversely associated with a range of metabolic and cardiovascular
systems, as well as quality of life [2,3]. Impaired sleep quantity and quality of sleep may be manifested
as sleep disorder symptoms including daytime sleepiness, daytime falling asleep, and snoring at
night. An increasing number of studies has found the associations between dietary macronutrients
consumption and sleep outcomes. For example, carbohydrate with high glycemic index facilitated
sleep onset, while low ﬁber, high saturated fat and sugar intake are associated with lighter and less
restorative sleep with more arousals [4–6]. Sleep duration is positively associated with consumption

of iron and zinc, but negatively associated with vitamin K and B12 [7]. However, the research of
micronutrients and sleep is limited, and the ﬁndings are inconsistent.

Magnesium, a cofactor involved in more than 300 enzyme systems, regulates diverse biochemical
reactions in the body [8]. Recently, magnesium has also been found to regulate cellular timekeeping
in both animal and plant cells [9], thus it is beneﬁcial to maintain the normal circadian rhythms and
ensure a quality sleep in humans. Magnesium supplement use improves insomnia symptom among
older people in a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial [10]. Low dietary magnesium intake
was found to be signiﬁcantly associated with depression [11]. It is known that depression is associated
with poor sleep. However, the studies on dietary magnesium and sleep are limited.

The major dietary sources of magnesium include green leafy vegetables, whole grains, nuts,
and legumes. These foods products are relatively inexpensive in China where average daily intakes
are high compared to Western countries. We hypothesized that high intake of magnesium is beneﬁcial
for the prevention of sleep disorder symptoms including daytime falling asleep, sleepiness and
snoring. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the associations between baseline dietary
magnesium intake and sleep symptoms at follow-up using ﬁve-year longitudinal data from the Jiangsu
Nutrition Study.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Subjects

Data from the Jiangsu Nutrition Study cohort were used in the current study. Detailed methodology
has been described previously [12]. In brief, in 2002, 2849 adults at least 20 years old living in two
cities and six rural areas in Jiangsu Province took part in the Chinese National Nutrition and Health
Survey. In 2007, an attempt to recontact all 1628 original participants was made and 1492 participated
undertook the follow-up interview. For the current analysis, we included only those subjects with
baseline (in 2002) magnesium intake and sleep records at follow-up (in 2007) (n = 1487) (Figure 1).
The study was conducted according to the guidelines in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures
were approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent
for participation was obtained from each participant.

2.2. Data Collection and Measurements

Participants were interviewed at their homes by trained health workers using a pre-coded
questionnaire. Interviews took about 2 h to complete and included questions on diet, sociodemographic
information, medical history, cigarette smoking, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors.

2.3. Dietary Measurements

Dietary data including magnesium intake were obtained by food weighing plus consecutive
individual 3-day food records (including one weekend) that recorded all foods consumed by everyone
in the household [13]. At the beginning and end of the 3-day survey, investigators weighed all the food
stocked in the household. All purchases, home production, and processed snack foods were weighed
and recorded each day. Nutrient intake was calculated using the Chinese Food Composition Table [14].

2.4. Sleep Measurement

At baseline in 2002, only sleep duration was collected but both sleep duration and self-reported
daytime falling asleep were collected at follow-up in 2007. Self-reported sleep disorder symptoms
were determined by relevant questions. Daytime falling asleep was determined by the question “Do
you fall asleep involuntarily during the day? (1) no; (2) yes; (3) don’t know”; Daytime sleepiness was
assessed by the question “Do you feel sleepy during the day? (1) never; (2) occasionally; (3) sometimes;
(4) often and (5) frequently”; and snoring during the night was determined by the question ”Does your
partner complain that you snore during the night? (1) never; (2) occasionally; (3) sometimes; (4) often;
(5) frequently”.

2.5. Anthropometric Measurement and Other Variables

In both 2002 and 2007 anthropometry was conducted using standard protocols and techniques.
Body weight was measured in light indoor clothing without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was
measured without shoes to the nearest mm using a stadiometer. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as weight in kilogram divided by the square of height in meters. BMI was subsequently categorized
into four groups underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5–23.9 kg/m2), overweight
(24–27.9 kg/m2) and obese (≥28 kg/m2) respectively according to the guideline for Chinese adults [15].
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest mm midway between the inferior margin of the
last rib and the crest of the ilium, in the mid-auxiliary line in a horizontal plane. Blood pressure was
measured twice with a mercury sphygmomanometer on the right upper arm of the subject, who was
seated for 5 min before the measurement. The mean of these two measurements was used in the
analyses. Hypertension was deﬁned as a systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic
blood pressure above 90 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive drugs.

2.6. Covariates

The following covariates were included in the study: cigarette smoking (yes or no); alcohol
consumption (never, 1–2/week, 3–4/week and daily); education (low, medium and high); occupation
(manual or non-manual); sedentary activity (<1 h/day, 1–2 h/day; 2–3 h/day, and ≥3 h/day); residence
(urban and rural).

2.7. Statistical Analysis

Descriptive data are presented as the mean (SD) (95% (conﬁdence interval (CI)) or as percentage.
Chi-square tests were used to compare the differences between categorical variables, and (Analysis of
variance) ANOVA was performed to compare differences in continuous variables between groups.
Magnesium intake (mg) was recoded into sex-speciﬁc quartiles. A sex-speciﬁc association between
baseline quartiles of magnesium intake and self-reported sleep disorder symptoms at follow-up
was assessed using multivariable logistic/Poisson regression models. A set of models were used:

Nutrients 2018, 10, 1354

4 of 11

model 1 adjusted for age, energy intake; model 2 further adjusted for income, education, region,
smoking, alcohol consumption, and sedentary activity; model 3 further adjusted for BMI, hypertension,
and diabetes; model 4 further adjusted for four dietary patterns. These four dietary patterns are:
Factor 1 (‘macho’) included various kinds of animal foods and alcohol; Factor 2 (the ‘traditional’
pattern) loaded heavily on rice, fresh vegetables and inversely on wheat ﬂour; Factor 3 (‘sweet tooth’)
contained cake, milk, yoghurt and drinks; and, Factor 4 (‘vegetable rich’ pattern) was characterized
whole grains, fruits, root vegetables, fresh and pickled vegetables, milk, eggs and ﬁsh. The four factors
explained 28.5% of the variance in intake (published earlier [16]). In sensitivity analyses, we further
adjusted for anemia, and baseline sleep duration. Statistical signiﬁcance was considered when p < 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed with STATA 14 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

3. Results

In total, 1487 participants had complete dietary intake data and sleep data in both 2002 and
2007. There was a decrease in sleep duration (mean = 0.36 h/day) on average over ﬁve years in
the study population with an increased sleep duration among short sleepers and a decreased sleep
duration among long sleepers. The prevalence of self-reported sleep disorder symptoms at follow-up
(year 2007) were: daytime sleepiness 13.2%, falling asleep 5.3% and snoring 35.7%. The median
intake of dietary magnesium was 289 mg/day (interquartile range (IQR) 233.7–366.1 mg/day) at
baseline (year 2002, mean intake 332.5 mg/day). Sex-speciﬁc characteristics by quartiles of magnesium
intake at baseline are presented in Table 1. Dietary magnesium intake seemed to decrease as income
increased in both sexes. Subjects in manual occupation and from rural region were more likely to
consume high level of dietary magnesium. However, non-alcohol consumers were more likely to be
low magnesium consumers in men, while those who had more frequent alcohol consumption were
more likely to have more dietary magnesium. While in women, compared with the lowest quartile
(Q1) of magnesium intake, those who had the highest quartile (Q4) were more likely to have lower
education level. With the increase of magnesium intake, the intake of carbohydrate, protein and fat
increased signiﬁcantly in both genders.

For sleep disorder symptoms at follow-up, there was no difference across quartiles of magnesium
intake at baseline except sleep duration and falling asleep in women. Those in Q1 of magnesium intake
were more likely to have short sleep duration (<7 h/day) and more likely to fall asleep during the
day compared with those who had Q4 of magnesium intake (Table 2). Across quartiles of magnesium
intake, the prevalence of falling sleep was 4.9%, 8.6%, 5.0% and 3.7% in men (p = 0.240); 8.7%, 4.4%, 5.3%
and 1.9% in women (p = 0.018), respectively. The prevalence of snoring was similar across quartiles of
magnesium in men and women, respectively. After adjusting for age and energy intake, magnesium
intake was inversely associated with falling asleep in women but not in men. Across quartiles of
magnesium intake, the odds ratio (OR) for falling asleep were 1.00, 0.34 (95% CI 0.14–0.87), 0.42 (95%
CI 0.16–1.09) and 0.11 (95% CI 0.02–0.57), respectively in women; 1.00, 1.32 (0.69, 2.50), 1.39 (0.68,
2.83), 1.39 (0.68, 2.83), and 1.62 (0.69, 3.80) respectively in men in the ﬁnal model (Table 3). There were
no associations between quartiles of magnesium consumption and other sleep related symptoms
including snoring and daytime sleepiness in either men or women. Sensitivity analyses for further
adjustment for anemia and sleep duration at baseline did not change the results (data not shown).
Compared to model 1, the subjects lost in the ﬁnal model (model 4) had no differences in age, and BMI,
but with a shorter sleep duration at baseline (p < 0.05, data not shown).

1 Participants included in the model had magnesium consumption at baseline (2002) and participated at follow-up
(2007) (n = 1487, men (n = 651)). Q1–Q4 stands for quartiles of isoﬂavone consumption for each sex. Model 1
adjusted for age and energy consumption; Model 2 further adjusted for income, education, rural region, smoking,
alcohol consumption and sedentary activity; Model 3 further adjusted for BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. Model 4
further adjusted for dietary patterns; Four dietary patterns (previously published) are: Factor 1 (‘macho’) included
various kinds of animal foods and alcohol; Factor 2 (the ‘traditional’ pattern) loaded heavily on rice, fresh vegetables
and inversely on wheat ﬂour; Factor 3 (‘sweet tooth’) contained cake, milk, yoghurt and drinks; and, Factor 4
(‘vegetable rich’ pattern) was characterized whole grains, fruits, root vegetables, fresh and pickled vegetables,
milk, eggs and ﬁsh. The four factors explained 28.5% of the variance in intake (published earlier [16]). * p < 0.05,
** p < 0.01.

4. Discussion

Dietary magnesium consumption was found to be associated with decreased risk of falling asleep
in women but not in men in the present study. No associations were found between dietary magnesium
consumption and other sleep related symptoms in either sex.

Dietary magnesium consumption in the Chinese population has been studied previously. In the
Shanghai Women’s Health Study, the median consumption of dietary magnesium was 267 mg/day,
which is similar with our result (289 mg/day) in both sexes [17]. However, both values are below
the recommended daily amount by China Nutrition Society (330 mg/day) [18]. In the study of

Nutrients 2018, 10, 1354

8 of 11

comparing nutrients consumption between Chinese and Italians, Japanese and Americans, mean
dietary magnesium consumption in Chinese subjects was higher than the Japanese in the younger
group and lower than the Americans adults and Italian children and adolescents [19]. The authors
claimed that the Chinese diet has been shifting away from the traditional diet towards a diet that
contains high-fat, low-carbohydrate, ﬁber and mineral nutrients.

It is interesting that the magnesium consumption was inversely associated with income and
positively associated with manual occupation and rural regions. This is consistent with the high
dietary magnesium consumption in rural areas found in a middle-aged Chinese population (mean daily
consumption 371.5 mg/day vs 332.5 mg/day in our study with mixed population) [20]. The possible
explanation may be the easy access to green leafy vegetables in rural areas and relatively low cost of
such foods compared to urban areas.

Our ﬁnding of an inverse association between magnesium consumption and daytime falling asleep
in women was consistent with other population studies. For example, magnesium consumption has
been suggested to improve insomnia in a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in elderly [10].
Improved sleep included subjective sleep efﬁciency, sleep time, sleep onset latency, and early morning
awakening, and increased serum melatonin and decreased serum cortisol concentration in experimental
group (500 mg supplemental magnesium daily) compared with the placebo group. Data from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)suggested a U-shape association between dietary
magnesium consumption and sleep duration [21]. This may indicate a potential beneﬁt of increased
dietary magnesium consumption on poor quality sleep including both short and long sleep. We also
found that the number of short sleepers seemed to decrease across the quartile of dietary magnesium
consumption at follow-up, particularly in women. A shortened sleep at night may lead to falling asleep
during the day. However, when we further adjusted for short sleep, the association between dietary
magnesium consumption and falling asleep in women remained, and even seemed to be stronger.
This may suggest that the association is independent of short sleep.

The inverse association between magnesium consumption and falling asleep is biologically
plausible. In animal studies, researchers have demonstrated that magnesium deﬁciency could affect
normal sleep-wake rhythm by increasing periods of wakefulness and reducing slow wave sleep in rats,
and such effect was recovered when reintroducing magnesium in their diet [22]. Magnesium deﬁciency
has been suggested to related to muscle cramps, which can contribute to a poor sleep and consequent
sleepiness the day after. Having magnesium may reduce night time wakefulness and maintain a
normal sleep structure, which may explain a beneﬁcial effect of preventing falling asleep during the day
found in our study. In the study mentioned above that found a sleep improving effect of magnesium
supplements in the elderly, the researchers also showed that magnesium supplementation increased
the serum levels of melatonin and renin while reducing cortisol levels [10]. This may partly explain
the beneﬁcial effect of magnesium consumption on sleep quality that is via increasing the secretion
of melatonin and lowering the level of cortisol. In addition, magnesium consumption has been
suggested to be inversely associated with depression in human studies including cross-sectional [11]
and longitudinal [23] designs. In animals, removal of magnesium from the diet of mice appears to
result in anxiety and depressive-related behavior [24]. An aid of anti-depressant effect of magnesium
also guarantees a quality sleep, which reduces poor sleep related sleep disorder symptoms.

The association between magnesium consumption and falling asleep was limited to women.
This gender difference is intriguing. Increasing evidence has supported the solid sex differences in
terms of biological and physiological differences between men and women (e.g., distinct hormonal
and physical changes in women’s life span including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause), which may
underlie the differences in sleep physiology and sleep disorders between sexes [25]. In addition, sex
differences in terms of nutrition and supplements have been suggested, in which women do not
immediately response to a normal increase in dietary carbohydrate when expressed as a percentage
of total energy consumption compared with men [26]. Indeed, it has been suggested that dietary
consumptions are different in men and women [27], and a Mediterranean dietary intervention had

Nutrients 2018, 10, 1354

9 of 11

more pronounced beneﬁts in the long term in men than in women [28]. This evidence provides
foundations for future gender speciﬁc dietary interventions.

Depression has been discussed above as a potential mechanism of understanding the association
between magnesium consumption and sleep disorder symptoms, but it remains to be explored whether
gender difference in depression can explain the different effects of magnesium consumption on sleep
remains to be explored. Earlier studies have reported that women had twice the lifetime risk of
developing depression compared with men [29]. Another earlier ﬁnding demonstrated that women
exhibited a higher prevalence of somatic depression (e.g., body aches, fatigue, and sleep disturbance)
than men but not a higher prevalence of pure depression [30]. In a Chinese cross-sectional study that
investigated the prevalence and correlates with sleep disturbances and depression in adolescents [31],
a higher likelihood of sleep disturbance was found in girls, which was associated with depressive
symptoms. These studies indicate a female are inclination for depression, which is particularly
associated with somatic symptoms including sleep disturbances.

Magnesium supplement use has been shown to be effectively reduce depressive symptoms in a
randomized clinical trial [32]. As magnesium may have a potential anti-depressant effect, magnesium
consumption in this particular depressed (including sleep problems) female group may be more
beneﬁcial compared with men. Such difference may potentially explain the gender difference in the
relationship of magnesium consumption with falling asleep found in our study. However, we do not
have depression data, and further exploration of whether depression is a confounder or a mediator
in terms of the association between magnesium consumption and daytime falling asleep cannot
be conducted.

In addition, it is noticed that in the study sample, we have previously shown that the magnesium
consumption is inversely associated with anemia. The prevalence of anemia in women in our study
population is almost double that of men [33], and magnesium consumption was also found to be
inversely associated the risk of anemia in our study population. Anemia has been shown to be
associated with poor sleep quality [34], and the possible mechanism was partly due to the dopaminergic
function of iron, which plays an important role in sleep regulation. Whether the gender difference
found in our study is related with anemia which women are inclined to have is unknown. Further
adjustment for anemia did not change the association between magnesium consumption and sleep
disorder symptoms (data not shown).

The strengths of this study include the large general population sample and consecutive three-day
weighed food diaries that provide robust food consumption data. Several limitations though need
to be acknowledged: (1) supplemental magnesium was not included, mainly because the difﬁculties
of accurate assessment due to variety of brands, and different concentration etc. The number of
participants using supplements is very small at baseline; (2) detailed dietary consumption using
the same 3-day food record method at follow-up is not available; (3) sleep disorder symptoms were
self-reported, which may have bias; however, objective measures such as overnight sleep studies are
not feasible to implement in large sample sizes; (4) self-reported sleep disorder symptoms were not
collected at baseline. Consequently, we cannot make a conclusion on a causal relationship due to
study design.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, dietary magnesium consumption was inversely associated with falling asleep
during the day in women but not in men. No associations were found between dietary magnesium
consumption and daytime sleepiness or snoring at night. A sex difference in sleep management may
need to be considered in future research and practice.
