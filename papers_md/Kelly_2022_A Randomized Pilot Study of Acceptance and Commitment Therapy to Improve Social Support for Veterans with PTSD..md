Abstract: Veterans with PTSD often have substantial interpersonal difﬁculties and low levels of
social support, which puts them at increased risk of mortality, but few treatments address global
social impairment for veterans with PTSD. This study is a pilot randomized trial of Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy to Improve Social Support for Veterans with PTSD (ACT-SS), a psychotherapy
that targets social avoidance and eroded social relationships, compared to Person-Centered Therapy
(PCT), a non-directive psychotherapy. Participants were randomized to twelve sessions of either
ACT-SS (n = 21) or PCT (n = 19). The results showed that veterans with PTSD had high ratings
of satisfaction for both treatments. Contrary to the PCT group, participants in the ACT-SS group
showed a signiﬁcant improvement in the quality of social relationships, engagement in social and
leisure activities, and PTSD symptoms from the baseline assessment to the end of treatment and
a three-month follow-up. Veterans in the ACT-SS group, but not the PCT group, also showed
signiﬁcant improvements in mindfulness and valued living and a reduction in experiential avoidance
from baseline to the end of treatment, with sustained improvements in valued living at the three-
month follow-up. Overall, the present study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and positive
preliminary outcomes of ACT-SS for veterans with PTSD.

Low social support is a key factor related to serious negative health outcomes, in-
cluding poor physical and mental health, increased mortality risk, and suicidal ideation
and behavior [1–4]. Social relationships buffer people from stress, improve their men-
tal health [1,5,6], and provide meaningful roles that increase self-esteem and purpose
in life [7,8]. Veterans with PTSD often have substantial interpersonal problems and low
levels of social support from family, partners, and peers, resulting in problems with so-
cial reintegration [9]. For example, Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Free-
dom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) veterans, for whom prevalence estimates of
PTSD range from 17% to 21% [10,11], reported a fourfold increase in rates of interpersonal
conﬂict within six months of returning from deployment [12]. Critically, social support is
also linked with suicidal ideation and behavior. Veterans with PTSD have rates of suicide
that are ﬁve times higher than the general population [13], making reducing social isolation
among these veterans imperative. Interventions that speciﬁcally target improving social
support for veterans with PTSD are critically needed to improve these veterans’ health,
well-being, and survival [1].

The negative outcomes associated with poor social support are of particular concern
for veterans with PTSD, who often perceive the world to be dangerous, view their social
support network as a threat to their safety, and avoid members of their support network in

order to increase their perceived safety [14,15]. Avoidance of social contact among people
experiencing PTSD symptoms may be conceptualized as experiential avoidance within
psychological ﬂexibility theory [16,17]. Psychological ﬂexibility theory maintains that
experiential avoidance interferes with living a life consistent with one’s values [18], which,
for many people, includes maintaining relationships with family, partners, friends, peers,
and others [17]. Veterans with PTSD who perceive others as threatening may withdraw
to avoid the anxiety they experience when interacting with others [19]. Veterans with
PTSD frequently act aggressively to control or avoid interactions with others (i.e., another
form of experiential avoidance) [19,20], leading to further decline in support over time.
Experiential avoidance has been shown to be associated with both greater PTSD symptom
severity and lower perceived social support in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans [21]. Further,
social avoidance has been shown to mediate the association between PTSD and partner
satisfaction in Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans [22]. In a study of 145 veterans who
served during the conﬂicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, experiential avoidance was found to be
a signiﬁcant mediator between PTSD symptoms and social support in veterans [23]. There
is also evidence that social support (and, conversely, social problems) inﬂuences outcomes
from PTSD treatment approaches, such as cognitive processing therapy [24,25]. New
treatment approaches with a speciﬁc focus on improving the quality of social relationships
for veterans with PTSD are needed to help improve their quality of life.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may be a useful therapeutic approach
for veterans with PTSD and social relationship difﬁculties. ACT is an evidence-based
treatment that focuses on identifying a person’s valued life goals and explicitly targets
experiential avoidance to assist clients in committing to behavior change aligned with
their values and becoming more psychologically ﬂexible [26–30]. There is strong empirical
evidence to show that ACT improves several conditions, with robust evidence for the
treatment of pain, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis [31–33]. ACT has also
shown preliminary evidence in improving interpersonal difﬁculties [34–36] and PTSD
symptoms [37–40]. However, ACT has not yet been speciﬁcally evaluated in its effects on
social relationship difﬁculties for veterans with PTSD.

The present paper presents the results of a small randomized clinical trial of a targeted
ACT intervention for veterans with PTSD compared to Person-Centered Therapy, a non-
directive treatment. The primary aim was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to Improve Social Support for Veterans with PTSD
(ACT-SS) [41]. Secondary aims included preliminary examinations of treatment outcomes,
including quality of life, quality of social relationships, social support, engagement in
social and leisure activities, PTSD symptoms and evaluations of potential change processes,
including mindfulness, experiential avoidance, and valued living.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

Participants were recruited from the VA Bedford Healthcare System, as well as via
ﬂyers and outreach to VA providers in the Boston metro area. A total of 143 U.S. veterans
engaged in a brief phone screen for the present study. Of those veterans, 92 were invited to
participate in an informed consent process and baseline intake to determine study eligibility.
Inclusion criteria included the following: (1) current DSM-5 PTSD, (2) minimum score
of 31 on the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), (3) self-reported clinically signiﬁcant difﬁculties in
interpersonal relationships, (4) competent to provide written informed consent, (5) ages
18 and older. Exclusion criteria included any of the following: (1) any current or lifetime
DSM-5 psychotic disorder, (2) current or recent (within 1 month of study entry) DSM-5
substance use disorder, (3) cognitive impairment that would interfere with study participa-
tion (e.g., dementia, intellectual disability, brain damage), (4) recent clinically signiﬁcant
suicidality (past 3 months), (5) moderate to severe domestic violence, and (6) participation
in concurrent PTSD counseling.

A total of 71 veterans at the VA Bedford Healthcare System completed an in-person
evaluation to determine eligibility for the study. This study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the VA Bedford Healthcare System IRB
committee. There was a complete discussion of the study with potential participants and
all participants signed statements of written informed consent after this discussion. A total
of 31 participants were screened out at the baseline intake. Eighteen were screened out
for the following reasons: did not meet criteria for PTSD (n = 5), did not report having
clinically signiﬁcant interpersonal problems (n = 3), active substance use disorder (n = 6),
psychotic disorder (n = 1), concurrent PTSD counseling (n = 1), and inability to commit
to treatment (n = 2). Nine other participants declined to participate in the study before
randomization. Four other participants did not complete the intake. The ﬁnal sample
comprised 40 participants who began treatment. See Figure 1 for the CONSORT diagram
of participant ﬂow.

2.2. Measures

Measures were completed by both the ACT-SS and PCT groups at baseline, end of

treatment (12th week), and at a three-month follow-up assessment.

A demographics assessment included questions about age, ethnicity, race, highest
level educational attainment, yearly income, marital status, sexual orientation, and gen-
der identity.

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) was used for diagnosing mental
health disorders for inclusion and exclusion criteria evaluation and to gather baseline
mental health information to characterize the sample [42]. The SCID is a widely used
structured interview that is used to diagnose mental health disorders with studies showing
that the SCID yields highly reliable diagnosis for mental health disorders [43].

The Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR) [44] is a 54-item measure of current
social functioning in 6 domains: Work; Social and Leisure; Extended Family; Primary
Relationship; Parental; and Family Unit. The SAS-SR is sensitive to change and has good
convergent and discriminant validity. In the present study, the social and leisure subscale
was used to evaluate change in the quantity and quality of social relationships and leisure
activities not related to romantic relationships (nine items). Each question is rated using
response scales speciﬁc to each of the nine items, with higher scores denoting greater
impairment. Sample items for this subscale include, “How many friends have you seen or
spoken to on the telephone in the last two weeks?”, “How many times in the last two weeks
have you gone out socially with other people?”, and “Have you felt lonely and wished
for more friends during the last two weeks?” Other subscales could not be reliably used
given that a number of veterans did not have family relationships, current employment,
a primary relationship, or parental relationships to report. The SAS-SR social and leisure
subscale (Cronbach’s α = 0.71) demonstrated acceptable reliability in the present sample.
The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SS) is a 19-item multidi-
mensional, self-administered survey of social support for individuals with chronic condi-
tions [45]. The MOS-SS measures four areas of social support: emotional/informational
support, tangible support, positive social interaction, and affectionate support. Items assess
how often raters are provided with companionship, assistance, or support, and are scored
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale, from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). An overall index
score was calculated, with the mean item scores transformed to a 0–100 scale. The MOS-SS
showed excellent internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.97) for this sample.

The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-
SF) is a self-report measure commonly used to assess quality of life in several domains:
general activities, physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activities, social relation-
ships, work, and household duties [46,47]. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale, from
zero (very poor) to ﬁve (very good). Higher scores indicate better enjoyment and satisfac-
tion with life. The scoring of the Q-LES-Q-SF involves summing the ﬁrst 14 items to yield a
total score, with total score ranging from 14 to 70 and expressed as a percentage based on
the maximum total score of the items completed (0–100). In this study, we analyzed the
overall Q-LES-Q score and the social relationships subscale to evaluate the change in the
quality of social relationships.

The PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) [48–50] is a self-report symptom checklist that measures
20 symptoms of PTSD as deﬁned in the DSM-5, and was used to assess PTSD for inclusion
criteria as well as changes during and after treatment. The scale provides four subscale
scores for PTSD symptom clusters, including: Cluster B (intrusion symptoms), Cluster
C (avoidance of trauma-related stimuli), Cluster D (negative thoughts or feelings), and
Cluster E (trauma-related arousal and reactivity) symptoms. Clients rate the degree to
which they are bothered by each listed symptom of PTSD on a 5-point Likert-type scale,
from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Items are summed to create a total score ranging from
0 to 80. Psychometric research suggests that a PCL-5 scores ≥ 31 in veterans indicates the
presence of a PTSD diagnosis [51]. The PCL-5 has shown a satisfactory temporal stability,

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

5 of 16

internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity [48]. For the current
study, the PCL-5 had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.86).

The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item scale that measures
the ability to mindfully observe the present moment [52]. Items assess how frequently
raters report an open, receptive awareness of and attention to what is taking place in the
present moment. Response options range from one (almost always) to six (almost never).
Internal consistency levels (Cronbach’s alphas) generally range from 0.80 to 0.90. The
MAAS has demonstrated high test–retest reliability, discriminant and convergent validity,
known-groups validity, and criterion validity. For the present sample, the MAAS showed
good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.83).

The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) [16] is a widely-used 7-item
self-report measure of emotional avoidance and inaction. Items are ranked on a 7-point
Likert scale, from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true), and items are summed to create a total
score. The AAQ-II has good reliability and validity, with scores concurrently, longitudinally,
and incrementally associated with and predictive of a range of outcomes, including mental
health outcomes and work absence rates. In this study, the AAQ-II showed a good internal
reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.86).

The Valued Living Questionnaire (VLQ) is a two-part self-report measure of the extent
to which a person is living in accordance with their values in everyday life [53,54]. The scale
presents ten values domains: family, friend/social life, marriage/couples/intimate rela-
tions, parenting, work, education/training, recreation/fun, spirituality, citizenship/commu-
nity life, and physical self-care. First, participants rate each domain according to how
important the value is (importance), and then rate each domain on how consistently they
have lived towards that value (consistency). A composite score is computed by multiplying
the importance and consistency scores for each domain and averaging these products.
Higher composite scores reﬂect taking actions that are more reﬂective of values.

The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) is an 8-item client self-report scale
that reﬂects a global satisfaction with and perceived quality of the effectiveness of mental
health services [55]. It is scored on a 4-point Likert scale from one (poor) to four (excellent),
with a total score range of 8 to 32. It has good reported internal consistency (Cronbach’s
alpha = 0.83–0.93) [56] and showed good internal reliability within our sample (Cronbach’s
α = 0.87).

The Working Alliance Inventory-Short Form (WAI-S) [57] is a 12-item scale adminis-
tered at week 12 to obtain a working alliance assessment. The scale measures agreement
between the patient and therapist across three main aspects of therapeutic alliance: the
development of an affective bond, setting goals, and developing working tasks or activities.
Each item is evaluated using a scale that ranges from one (never) to seven (always). It
shows acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.83–0.98) [57] and predictive va-
lidity related to therapy outcome [57–59]. The WAI-S (Cronbach’s α = 0.81) demonstrated
good reliability in the present sample.

2.3. Procedures

Screening Procedures. Veterans were initially screened using a brief phone screen to
obtain information relevant to the inclusion/exclusion criteria before study consent and
intake. Veterans eligible after this screen were scheduled for an in-person assessment to
obtain informed consent and conﬁrm study eligibility. Subjects then completed self-report
measures and participated in clinician-administered measures.

Veterans who met eligibility criteria consented and completed the intake process were
randomized to ACT-SS or PCT. Veterans with either condition received twelve 50 min
weekly sessions of individual treatment.

ACT-SS Treatment. The following components are emphasized in ACT-SS: (1) Identifying
(1) Problems with Social Avoidance: Participants identify efforts to avoid interpersonal experi-
ences. Discussions focus on how avoidance is problematic for developing and maintaining
relationships. (2) Triggers for Avoidance: Negative thoughts and emotions that lead to poor

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

functioning and low quality of life are identiﬁed (e.g., worry over rejection, not being
able to trust others, anger, feelings of being unworthy), and veterans practice acceptance
and mindfulness to manage these experiences. (3) Acceptance: Veterans are encouraged to
accept interpersonal situations that trigger concerns with mindful acceptance, rather than
avoiding them. (4) Mindfulness: Participants engage in mindfulness exercises in order to
practice nonjudgmental acceptance of their thoughts about others and negative emotions
(e.g., leaves on a stream exercise, mindfulness of anger). (5) Self-Compassion: Veterans
are encouraged to view themselves with more compassion, and practice self-compassion
exercises (e.g., view themselves as a child who needs compassion). (6) Valued Living: Par-
ticipants clarify their values and goals (i.e., building relationships, work achievement,
community participation), and identify barriers that prevent them from achieving life
goals. (7) Willingness Exercises (Exposure): Participants develop hierarchies for interper-
sonal triggers and avoided social experiences and practice mindful acceptance during
scheduled willingness exercises. (8) Cognitive Defusion: Participants learn that they are not
their anxieties or fears, and they mindfully observe and accept these internal experiences.
(9) Committed Action: Participants identify life goals and increase activities to improve
social functioning, quality of life, and social reintegration. Participants commit to achieving
valued goals.

To more directly meet the needs of veterans with PTSD and social relationship difﬁcul-
ties, speciﬁc modiﬁcations to ACT were made (see Table 1). First, PTSD is associated with
a number of interpersonal challenges, including (1) rejection sensitivity [60]; (2) poor self-
esteem [61]; and (3) being distrustful of others [62]. ACT-SS incorporates traditional ACT
strategies and includes speciﬁc strategies to target poor social functioning. For example,
adaptations include: (1) acceptance and mindfulness exercises about fears of being rejected
by others, that others are threatening, feelings of being inadequate, and being distrustful of
others; (2) identifying how social avoidance related to PTSD symptoms negatively affects
social functioning, with willingness (exposure) exercises focused speciﬁcally on decreasing
social avoidance and increasing community participation; (3) the incorporation of com-
mitted action exercises around increasing social interaction with others (a new socially
focused goal every week). Second, we also included self-compassion exercises and a focus
on forgiveness of the self and others to reduce the negative focus on low self-worth as a
reason for avoiding others. Third, we included material on how to build healthy relation-
ships, including speciﬁc skills for interacting with others (e.g., be present, validate the other
person, be compassionate, share valued activities, and practice connection). Fourth, we
included content on managing anger in an ACT-consistent manner, since anger is a key
emotional barrier to developing and managing healthy relationships. Veterans practice
being more mindful of anger and choose their actions based on their values and not on
anger itself. Finally, we included content on trust in relationships, which is a major barrier
to healthy interactions with others. A description of the ACT-SS treatment and a case study
by Kelly and colleagues includes more details of this treatment approach [41].

Participants received 12 weekly 50 min individual counseling sessions. Session 1
was devoted to an explanation of the treatment rationale and identifying interpersonal
triggers. Sessions 2–6 focused on mindfulness, cognitive defusion, and acceptance of PTSD
symptoms, anxiety over interacting with others, and acceptance of other negative thoughts
and emotions. Sessions 7–11 focused on self-compassion, relating to others, values, anger,
and forgiveness, with a large emphasis on committed action and exposure hierarchies for
social anxiety and avoidance. In the termination phase (sessions 11–12), therapy focused on
termination, planning for the future, as well as reviewing progress and gains in treatment.
Control Condition. Person-Centered Therapy was the control condition, which is a
commonly used treatment for discussing interpersonal difﬁculties. PCT is a non-directive
approach that encourages participants to ﬁnd their own solutions to their problems, includ-
ing interpersonal problems. PCT is focused on creating a safe, non-judgmental therapeutic
environment in which therapists engage in active listening and demonstrate unconditional
positive regard for their clients. Participants are encouraged to explore their own experi-

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

7 of 16

ences and emotions in order to make their own decisions about how they need to change.
PCT consisted of the same dosage and intensity of psychosocial treatment as ACT-SS.
PCT was delivered in 12 50-min weekly sessions, matched to the length and frequency of
ACT-SS sessions.

Table 1. ACT-SS Manual Content.

Major Content Areas of ACT-SS

Identifying Problems with
Social Avoidance

Veterans are asked to identify efforts to avoid interpersonal experiences and how this is problematic
for developing and maintaining relationships

Identifying Triggers

Interpersonal triggers are identiﬁed, with an emphasis on how PTSD-related triggers and symptoms
are related to interpersonal conﬂict and avoidance.

Acceptance
and Mindfulness

Valued Living

Veterans participate in mindfulness exercises in order to practice nonjudgmental acceptance of
interpersonal experiences and PTSD symptoms that interfere with interpersonal interactions
(e.g., irritability and feelings of detachment).

Veterans clarify their values and goals (i.e., reasons for changing patterns in interpersonal
experiences), and identify barriers (thoughts, feelings, sensations associated with PTSD) that prevent
them from achieving these goals.

Cognitive Defusion

Veterans learn that partners, family members, and peers are not threats to their safety and to
mindfully observe anxieties about social interactions.

Willingness Exercises

Veterans create exposure hierarchies for social interactions and face them with mindful acceptance to
become more comfortable with these experiences.

Committed Action

Veterans incorporate more social activities in their lives and opportunities to interact with others that
are consistent with valued goals. Veterans commit to spending more time with important social
supports and develop new relationships.

Speciﬁc Content Areas to Address for Veterans with PTSD in ACT-SS

Social Isolation

Goals focus on being willing to engage in social interactions and increasing community involvement,
while accepting PTSD-related symptoms.

Building
Healthy Relationships

Ask veterans to be present, validate the other person, be compassionate, share valued activities, and
practice connection.

Anger

Trust

Veterans learn to be more mindful of anger and choose to act according to their values.

Veterans balance values around trust with values around self-protection and practice mindful
trusting—be aware of the person’s behavior and provide trust when it is earned.

Therapists and Treatment Integrity. ACT-SS and PCT was provided by psychologists
or postdoctoral residents. The ﬁrst author provided training in both ACT-SS and PCT
via workshops for each type of psychotherapy. Study therapists had weekly supervision
with Dr. Kelly to check protocol adherence. Each case was reviewed weekly. At least four
randomly selected sessions with each therapist were discussed in detail with the ﬁrst author
to assess treatment adherence. There were no protocol violations. Therapist competence
was not rated.

Statistical analyses. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of ACT-SS for veterans
with PTSD vs. PCT as a control condition by examining rates of treatment completion. We
also examined reasons for withdrawing from treatment for consistent patterns. Overall
treatment satisfaction was measured with the CSQ-8-R and the quality of the therapeutic
alliance on the WAI-S. We also collected qualitative data on the acceptability of ACT-SS
using structured individual interviews at the end of treatment, which asked about exercises
that were the most helpful, whether they would recommend the treatment to others, and
perceived changes as a result of treatment.

Given that this was a pilot study, there is not enough power to test hypotheses re-
garding the potential between-condition differences in outcome measures. In addition,
we explored differences in both treatment groups over time using a repeated measures
ANOVA on the quality of social relationships (Q-LES-Q), levels of social support (MOS-SS),

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

8 of 16

engagement in social and leisure activities (SAS-SR), and PTSD symptoms (PCL-5). We also
examined the effects of treatment on potential mediators (i.e., process variables—MAAS,
AAQ, VLQ), and the effect of these mediators on treatment outcomes to identify candi-
date mediators for future study. Based on the intent-to-treat principle, all participants
randomized to treatment were included in the analyses.

3.2. Treatment Retention

There were no differences in treatment completion between the ACT-SS and PCT
groups. In the ACT-SS condition, 71% of veterans completed all 12 sessions of treatment
(n = 15), and 29% discontinued treatment (n = 6). In the PCT condition, 79% of veterans
completed all 12 sessions of treatment (n = 15) and 21% discontinued treatment (n = 4).
In the ACT-SS condition, of the six veterans who did not complete treatment, one had
increased job responsibilities and could no longer participate in the treatment, one lost
transportation, one had a family emergency to attend to, and two did not respond to calls
or a letter. In the PCT condition, of the four participants who discontinued treatment, one
moved away, one had a medical hospitalization that interfered with treatment, and two did
not respond to calls or a letter. There did not appear to be a consistent pattern of reasons
for drop out in either the ACT or PCT conditions.

3.3. Feasibility and Acceptability of Treatment

Client satisfaction was rated using the CSQ-8 for treatment completers. There were no
differences between the ACT-SS (M = 29.1, SD = 2.56) and PCT groups (M = 29.9, SD = 4.04)
on the CSQ-8. Overall, client satisfaction for both treatments was high. There were no
differences between the ACT-SS group (M = 74.42, SD = 4.19) and PCT group (M = 72.64,
SD = 11.37) in the Working Alliance Inventory for those who completed treatment.

When asked about what perceived changes they noted about themselves, ACT-SS
participants reported that they were less critical of themselves and others, more open and
willing to do things that were uncomfortable, and more active in social activities. Please
see Table 3 for representative quotes from participants. Qualitative feedback indicated
that veterans would recommend the ACT-SS treatment to others. Representative quotes
included: “I would recommend it because it helped me to grow and I think it could help
someone else”, “Absolutely, because it’s useful. I think even someone without PTSD could
really beneﬁt from this. Especially men in a military mindset”, “Yes, because it gets them
to open their mouth, develop a sense of trust, and creates a discipline with how to deal
with fears, doubts and insecurities”, and “Yes, it does two things, (1) talking to somebody
other than your friends and family, (2) it’s directed towards achieving certain goals, not
just talk therapy.”

Of the eleven veterans who answered questions about which ACT exercises were
the most helpful, the most popular exercise (45%) was “Joe the Problem”, which frames
difﬁcult internal experiences as an unwelcome party guest to be accepted in the service
of staying engaged at the party (valued life activities). Other popular exercises included
the ﬁnger trap, which illustrates the paradoxical effect of trying to suppress thoughts and
emotions versus willingly experiencing them (36%); passengers on a bus, which presents
difﬁcult thoughts and emotions as passengers who, if given control, will divert the driver
from valued life directions (36%); and sky/weather, which teaches participants to view
themselves as the ever-present context (i.e., the sky) for thoughts and emotions (i.e., the

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

10 of 16

weather; 27%). There was no consistent pattern of any ACT exercises being the least helpful.
Of the same group of veterans, 82% of veterans reported that mindfulness exercises were
helpful, with 45% indicating that the leaves on the stream meditation and mindfulness of
the breath meditation were particularly helpful. A representative quote about mindfulness
exercises was, “All of them were helpful. They are key to when you decide to let go and try
to relax and get clarity about what is really going on. It has always been helpful. It allows
me to let go of a lot of things affecting me”.

Table 3. Qualitative feedback from participants about perceived changes in themselves as a result of
engaging in ACT-SS.

I feel like I am more open, more receptive, and more understanding of others’ needs.

I have better quality of life, I am doing more, leaving my house, and seeing people.

I am not beating myself up.

Positive changes. Willingness to try new things. Willingness to get out more.

I am more willing to talk with family about things, even if it’s uncomfortable, and I am willing to listen more. I am more willing to
step out of my comfort zone and do more social activities, reaching out to friends more and not giving up right away.

I feel better about others and about myself.

Increasing insight/self-awareness, stop trying with people who do not care or who do not put in as much effort as I do.

I am allowing more self-trust. Allowing my feelings to come out. Life is not perfect. I am not perfect. Day to day recognition of
where I am at and where I want to be. Letting go of negative thoughts. Not allowing anger to surface to the point that it
is destructive.

Recognizing more clearly how I got to this. What I resist will persist. Identifying an internal dialogue on why I do certain things.
Stepping outside of myself and having to do things—doing things I do not want to do because I have to for myself and others.

4. Discussion

This pilot randomized controlled trial provides important evidence for the feasibility
and acceptability of an ACT intervention designed to improve the social relationships of
veterans with PTSD. Study metrics including therapy retention and satisfaction, as well
as qualitative feedback from participants, demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability
of the intervention. Secondary analyses also provided preliminary support for the effects
of the intervention on key outcomes and potential change processes for the intervention.
Together, these ﬁndings demonstrate the promise of ACT-SS for targeting low levels of

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

12 of 16

social support among veterans with PTSD, a population at high risk of mortality and other
negative outcomes [1–4].

Overall, participants in both conditions reported satisfaction with treatment, suggest-
ing the non-inferiority of ACT-SS compared to the active control intervention for this index
of acceptability. Furthermore, there was less than a 30% dropout in both conditions, which
is particularly meaningful for a sample of veterans with PTSD who demonstrated marked
social avoidance and reported interpersonal difﬁculties and social isolation. In qualitative
interviews, participants in the ACT condition indicated that they would recommend the
treatment to others. In particular, participants reported that they thought that mindful-
ness exercises, such as mindful breathing and leaves on a stream were helpful to create
awareness of their thoughts and emotions when interacting with others. Participants also
indicated that the intervention helped them feel more open and willing to interact with
others, even if it was difﬁcult. They reported increased insight into their own thoughts,
emotions, and actions, which helped them avoid automatically acting on their thoughts
and emotions, leading to improved relationships.

The preliminary results of this study showed that although ACT-SS did not lead
to increased overall quality of life, it was associated with an increased quality of social
relationships, likely because this is a direct target of this intervention. The increased quality
of social relationships in the ACT-SS group were also extended to the three-month follow-
up, demonstrating at least a short-term sustained improvement. The ACT-SS intervention
focused on the development of a long-term game plan for improving social relationships,
which may have helped veterans to sustain their social relationships after treatment. In
addition, this result was supported by an increased engagement in social and leisure
activities at both the end of treatment and three-month follow-up for the ACT-SS group. No
changes over time in either of these variables were observed in the PCT condition, which
does not explicitly target social relationships in treatment.

There were no changes observed in either the ACT-SS group or PCT group for the
MOS Social Support Survey. One major reason for this result may be that the MOS Social
Support Survey [45] asks the respondent to identify “someone” who can provide advice,
understands problems, can provide assistance, and with whom they can practise enjoyable
activities. Many veterans in this study had at least one person in their lives that they could
enjoy things with and that they could count on. However, they still reported feeling socially
isolated from their community and wanting to increase their social activities and the quality
of their overall relationships. As a result, the MOS Social Support Survey may not have
been sensitive enough to assess global social support needs, rather asking people to identify
only one person that provides support. However, given that ACT-SS conceptually has
more of an impact on social connectedness rather than MOS-deﬁned social support, it may
be worth considering renaming the treatment to be more aligned with the actual target
of treatment.

The results of this study support the research on ACT interventions demonstrating
improvement in social relationships. For instance, a study of a 10-session ACT intervention
targeting the interpersonal problems of university students in Iran (n = 66) showed a
signiﬁcant reduction in interpersonal problems and emotion regulation difﬁculties [35]. A
pilot study of a 12-session ACT treatment for mental health carers (n = 24) showed that ACT
resulted in signiﬁcant reductions in interpersonal problems and caregiving avoidance, and
increased mindfulness, psychological ﬂexibility, and wellbeing over time [36]. Qualitative
results from this study also showed that participants reported improvements in reactivity,
communication, agency, and connection to others. Another study that examined the
effect of a 10-session ACT group intervention for high school students with social anxiety
disorder (n = 30) [34] showed signiﬁcant improvements in interpersonal problems and a
reduction in psychological inﬂexibility, consistent with the results of the present study. The
aforementioned studies and the present study mostly had small sample sizes, which limits
the ability to draw ﬁrm conclusions about the effect of ACT on relationships. Although
the results from this pilot study and other ACT interventions on interpersonal problems

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

13 of 16

are promising, larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to more adequately test
the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions that target interpersonal problems and improvements in
social relationships.

Furthermore, results from this study showed that there was a signiﬁcant reduction in
PTSD symptoms at both the end of treatment and the three-month follow-up for the ACT-
SS group, but not in the PCT group. It is notable that PTSD symptoms were not directly
targeted in this study, and no traditional exposure exercises for PTSD symptoms were
utilized (e.g., repeated recounts of the trauma, as in prolonged exposure), but veterans in the
ACT-SS group still experienced a statistically and clinically signiﬁcant symptom reduction
of about 10 points in the PCL-5. The emphasis on engaging in avoided social activities may
have provided veterans with important exposure to previously avoided situations akin to
in vivo experiences of prolonged exposure. This focus on previously avoided situations that
were also connected with veterans’ values and the desire for increased connection may have
provided an opportunity for participants to experience a reduction in PTSD symptoms.

Although there are case studies that have shown the promise of ACT for people
with PTSD [37,38], few empirical trials demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in PTSD
symptoms as a result of an ACT intervention. A pilot study of 12-session ACT group and
individual interventions showed a signiﬁcant improvement in PTSD symptoms in both
the ACT group (n = 10) and individual interventions (n = 9) [39]. Another pilot study of a
web-based ACT intervention in trauma-related psychological difﬁculties for interpersonal
trauma survivors (n = 25) showed a signiﬁcant reduction in PTSD symptoms [63]. An
open trial of a 12-session ACT intervention for co-occurring PTSD and alcohol use disorder
(n = 43) showed an improvement in clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptoms
and quality of life post-treatment and at a 3-month follow-up [40]. However, as mentioned
above with regard to ACT interventions for interpersonal difﬁculties, more research with
larger randomized controlled trials is necessary to better understand the effects of ACT on
individuals with PTSD.

All three process variables showed a signiﬁcant change in the ACT-SS group from
baseline to the end of treatment, including an improvement in mindfulness and valued
living and a reduction in experiential avoidance. These changes were not evident in the
PCT (active control) group, suggesting that ACT-SS effectively targeted the hypothesized
change processes and provided support for these candidate mediators in future, larger-
scale trials of the study intervention. The sustained improvement in valued living at
the three-month follow-up is consistent with research suggesting that values work is
an important component of ACT interventions, and valued living is a key mediator of
outcomes, especially those that are not speciﬁc to diagnostic symptoms. For example,
changes in valued behaviors precede and inﬂuence changes in the subsequent levels of
suffering [64], and dismantling research suggests that the values and committed action
components of ACT are especially impactful for broad indicators of functioning [65], at
times performing, along with full-model ACT interventions, for outcomes that include a
social well-being component [66]. However, no studies evaluated how an emphasis on
valued living as a process could speciﬁcally improve social functioning and relationships.
Future studies on ACT for social relationships should evaluate these associations.

The present study was a small, randomized pilot study, which limits conclusions about
treatment outcomes as the study was not sufﬁciently powered to detect speciﬁc treatment
effects in comparison to control conditions. Future larger randomized controlled trials
with blinded assessments are necessary to evaluate the efﬁcacy of ACT-SS. In addition,
although a careful weekly review of session details and the approach occurred for therapists
throughout the study in both the ACT-SS and PCT conditions, therapist competence was not
assessed using adherence measures. Future studies of ACT-SS should ensure that therapist
adherence is systemically evaluated. In addition, we included only subjective measures of
social engagement, and future studies should consider including more objective measures
(e.g., analysis of the number of social activities). We also limited the treatment to 12 sessions,
and it is unclear whether a longer duration of treatment would result in better outcomes.

J. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3482

14 of 16

Finally, the sample was largely composed of non-Hispanic, white, heterosexual men, and
future studies should evaluate the effects of ACT-SS on a broader range of veterans.

Although preliminary, these results suggest that the targeting of improved social rela-
tionships with ACT is a promising treatment approach for veterans with PTSD, acceptable
to veterans, and feasible to use and evaluate in a research context. Further research is
needed in order to determine the efﬁcacy of ACT-SS for veterans with PTSD in larger
randomized controlled trials.
