Orthopedic practice in COVID‑19 pandemic

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to worldwide crisis 
(from the Greek krisis used by Hippocrates and Galen as 
the “turning point of a disease when an important change 
takes place, indicating recovery or death”). In this crisis, 
the medical profession paid a high tribute to the pandemic 
with lethal cases and major stress exposure for the healthcare 
personnel [1]. Physicians in the front-line such as internists 
and anesthesiologists were mostly at risk, not simply of get-
ting infected but of getting the infection in its most severe 
form. Orthopaedic surgeons were not in the front-line; how-
ever, they were definitely affected by the pandemic. Being 
an orthopaedic surgeon is a complex task that became more 
subtle and difficult in crisis; in the most affected countries, 
orthopaedic surgeons were urged to work outside their spe-
cific areas of training and expertise [2–4].

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impacted deeply the ortho-
paedic facilities worldwide [5, 6]. Clinical practice changed 
with fewer patients seen in all health systems. Surgical prac-
tice changed as well; elective operations were cancelled, 
and non-urgent operations were suspended, with a resultant 
substantial revenue loss for hospitals and surgeons. Surgery 
was mostly reserved for trauma and life-threatening con-
ditions such as cancer, bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, or 
severe infections. Additionally, in times of pandemic, most 
surgeons did not want to operate, and many admitted to 
change management to non-operative for certain fractures. 
This was due to the hazards of poor protection and testing 
including the inability of routine checks on patients, lack of 
personal protective equipment, poor subsequent psychology

for the risk of getting infected, and increased stress of going 
to the emergency room for non-urgent things. During the 
pandemic, we were told that standard surgical face masks 
do not provide sufficient protection; FFP2 and FFP3 face 
masks are more protective but they were not available from 
the start, as well as they were reserved only for front-line 
infectious diseases specialists. Cancellation of elective sur-
gical operations led to a significant financial loss for the 
orthopaedic physicians, an increased backlog of numerus 
orthopaedic operations and substantial waiting list for the 
patients, and a significant reduction of the number of pro-
cedures for residents and trainees. Reassignment of trainees 
to high-volume institutions in the future may be a plausi-
ble approach to mitigate significant training deficits in the 
trainees worst impacted by the reduction in operative case 
volume [1–4, 7–13].

Orthopaedic surgeons’ incomes changed during COVID-
19  pandemic  [10,  14,  15].  The  rapidly  spreading  threat 
imposed  an  unprecedented  burden  on  the  effectiveness 
and sustainability of the healthcare systems. The COVID-
19 pandemic led to an overall increase in visits to clinical 
emergency and hospitalization numbers, and cancellation 
of elective surgery and clinical appointments that impacted 
the financial incomes of the medical practitioners. Accord-
ing  to  a  survey  of  975  orthopaedic  surgeons  in  Brazil, 
approximately 98% of them suffered some monetary impact; 
80% had a financial reserve from which 45% could last for 
three months. Longer the time of professional experience, 
greater the reduction percentage of the monthly income [14].
An alternative for replacing loss of activity and face-to-
face clinics is the virtual consultation. Telemedicine has 
been used in some countries to deliver orthopaedic care to 
patients remotely. It is a useful technique for offering advice 
on for patients’ care, pain control, and rehabilitation. How-
ever, although it might work for a tendinitis or carpal tunnel 
syndrome, it cannot be useful if the patient has a fracture. It 
is our opinion that the use of telemedicine will continue in 
the post-pandemic era; yet, telemedicine may facilitate the

care but does not appear to replace in-person clinics [15, 16]. 
Virtual clinics should be expected to benefit the patients. 
Virtual visits and care will be especially convenient if the 
patients live far away, are elderly or disabled, and will prob-
ably require more timely interventions. The development 
of telemedicine was enhanced by the pandemics. However, 
even if the medical care can be effectively accomplished by 
virtual prescriptions and avoidance of unnecessary refer-
rals, we doubt on the effectiveness and quality of the virtual 
nursing [4].

Stress, anxiety, and burnout of orthopaedic 
surgeons

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the 
physical and mental health of healthcare professionals and 
hospital workers, including orthopaedic surgeons. Exist-
ing evidence highlighted the high prevalence of anxiety 
(23.21%), perceived vulnerability, traumatic stress, depres-
sion (22.8%), and insomnia (34.32%) of healthcare profes-
sionals [17, 18]. Increased stress levels at work in healthcare 
professionals were associated with fear of contamination 
and well-being of self and family, poor communication and 
inadequate planning among healthcare professionals, unclear 
work instructions and information, deficient or non-func-
tioning equipment, lack of personal protective equipment, 
exposure to infected patients, work overload, poor infection 

control, preexisting medical conditions, and financial liabili-
ties. Table 1 lists the sources of stress and anxiety among 
health professionals during the pandemic. These important 
factors induced fear of COVID-19 infection among health 
professionals, including surgeons [19–21].

Early-phase evidence on COVID-19 pandemic suggested 
that healthcare professionals experienced mood and sleep 
disturbances during the outbreaks, stressing the need to 
establish ways to minimize mental health risks and support 
interventions aiming at pandemic conditions [18]. In the 
short-term, this work-related stress can cause fatigue, sleep 
disorders, mistakes, and moral distress. Long-term effects 
of  high  work  pressure  include  burnout,  depression,  and 
post-traumatic stress, resulting in dropout due to illness and 
abandonment of paid employment [22]. In contrast to high 
workload, stress, and less recovery time, vitality, resilience, 
and job satisfaction were described as characteristics of pro-
fessionals that counterbalance work-related stress. These 
characteristics could strengthen professionals’ mental and 
physical well-being and their retention for work. Therefore, 
professionals with a high level of vitality and resilience seem 
more resistant to work under pressure [21].

Stress and anxiety among surgeons is not a new phenom-
enon resulting in burnout, as well as in suicide in extreme 
situations [11, 23, 24]. There is a consensus that healthcare 
professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, 
anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction, and post-traumatic 
stress disorders that could have long-term psychological

implications [25]. Stress may have been related to the gen-
eralized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly 
among healthcare professionals, due to a range of causes 
such  as  the  rapid  spread  of  COVID-19,  the  severity  of 
symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individu-
als, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and the deaths 
among healthcare professionals. Stress may also be caused 
by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal pro-
tection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide 
competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rap-
idly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date infor-
mation and communication, lack of specific drugs, shortage 
of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care 
for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change 
in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors for 
stress include feelings of being inadequately supported, 
concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection 
to family members or others, and not having rapid access 
to  testing  through  occupational  health  if  needed,  being 
isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, 
overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment [25]. In a 
study, 63.5% of surgeons believed that vaccine availability 
and emergence of effective drug and treatment protocol will 
reduce their fear of COVID-19, and a significant number of 
surgeons expressed interest to participate in support groups, 
which suggest stronger psychological well-being and their 
adaptability to unprecedented pandemic [26].

Early recognition of anxiety among orthopaedic surgeons 
is essential. The present pandemic has impacted orthopae-
dic surgeons psychologically in the form of definite or mild 
anxiety that is related to factors such as younger age group, 
working  in  a  primary  or  secondary  healthcare  facility, 
unavailability of adequate personal protective equipment, 
disruption of life-work balance, and uncertainties regard-
ing return to work [11, 27]. COVID-19 has had a signifi-
cant impact on all adult reconstruction surgeons including 
residents, fellows, and early career surgeons, with different 
impacts on each subgroup. A considerable impact has been 
identified in young arthroplasty surgeons in training and 
within the first five years of their career concerning com-
pensation, redeployment, and career advancement opportu-
nities or losses. The younger orthopaedic surgeons are either 
starting their orthopedic practice or they are in the initial 
few years of their practice and would need more support, 
including social and financial [27]. Orthopaedic practices 
should be conscious of these implications on young arthro-
plasty surgeons, and additional resources including loans, 
counseling, or educational support should be offered to this 
group of surgeons to mitigate the impact of the crisis [28].

Healthcare  professionals  should  be  supported  during 
the COVID-19 and similar working conditions to prevent 
and reduce possible negative consequences. Follow-up and 
management with targeted interventions and mental health 

support are warranted to assess long-term psychological out-
comes and alleviate the psychological burden of the pan-
demic on healthcare professionals. Regular burnout preven-
tion programs should be instituted to decrease emotional 
exhaustion of the physicians. Maintaining their vitality and 
resilience  will  contribute  to  improvement  in  healthcare 
quality.

Orthopaedic science in COVID‑19 pandemia

Orthopaedic surgeons had the opportunity to work with 
sponsors for research. Unavoidably, due to the pandemic, a 
large number of orthopaedic studies have been paused; for-
tunately, at the time of this writing, most have been resumed. 
Many international and national meetings, congresses, and 
courses have been cancelled, or rescheduled. Again, at the 
time of this writing, many meetings have been resumed in 
physical presence. However, not many orthopedic surgeons 
eventually attend or are expected to attend these meetings.

Medical education and writing should be resumed as 
well. It is a responsibility of a medical doctor to provide 
medical information and transfer knowledge despite casual-
ties. With ethos of diversity and equality, and foreseeing 
a continuous virtual medical education, SICOT organized 
the SICOT Virtual Education Program 2020 and the SICOT 
Hybrid Education Program 2021 in Budapest, Hungary. This 
year, the 41st SICOT Orthopaedic World Congress will be 
held in physical presence only in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
The 2020 and 2021 SICOT Education Programs consisted 
of a series of webinars, webcasts and podcasts, and surgical 
tips and techniques on variable orthopedic surgery by key 
opinion leaders with high skills in their area of speciali-
zation. The SICOT Programme of Innovative Orthopaedic 
Networking, e-learning, Education and Research (SICOT-
PIONEER) was free for all the SICOT members, along with 
the publication of resources and research stored in a user-
friendly repository. It allowed the opportunity to participate 
in e-learning modules, recorded lectures, and interactive 
discussion boards on different virtual platforms. The aim 
was for everyone, in the most remote geographic areas of the 
world to remain up-to-date with surgical techniques, stay on 
track with their professional development, and remain con-
nected to a supportive network of like-minded surgeons in 
these uncertain times.

Over the last two years of the pandemic, we appreciated 
an unprecedented rise of submissions to International Ortho-
paedics [29] and SICOT-J [30]. Both journals represent along 
with the annual World Orthopaedic Congress of SICOT the 
academic side of our multinational organization. The paper 
submissions to the journals were interesting material that we, 
as editors, acknowledge and review carefully. Finding good 
reviewers in crisis was not easy, but it turned out to be less 

1 3934

difficult compared to other occasions such as summer holi-
days. We were pleased to see that the journal’s reviewers reply 
promptly and accept a review assignment, and return on time 
with a good and constructive review. Taking the opportunity 
from this editorial, we wish to thank our reviewers for their 
pro bono exceptional work in the review process of the journal 
with quality, informative, objective, and reliable reviews that 
aim to improve the submitted papers to the journal [31–36]. 
The editors and reviewers of the journal opt for quality publi-
cations to increase the impact of the journal and the visibility 
of the submitted/published papers. Because we acknowledge 
the effort and amount of time that are required to perform 
a study and to prepare and submit a manuscript, our review 
process aims to improve and to accept an article. As editors, 
we support continuous orthopaedic education, and we look 
forward to your submissions to International Orthopaedics 
[37–39].

SICOT and International Orthopaedics are growing. Inter-
national Orthopaedics is the academic face of SICOT that we 
turn to the world and by that we are largely judged by the 
orthopaedic community. As a major general scientific journal, 
International Orthopaedics has been a catalyst for change and 
we foresee this continuing in the future. Although we hope that 
the pandemic will fade in a favourable way for the orthopaedic 
surgeons/scientists, we have adapted to an optimal scientific 
and educational environment for the members of SICOT and 
the readers of our journals. Regaining efficacy and maintaining 
process quality and safety while reinstating orthopedic surgery 
represent the next challenge for the orthopedic specialists. We 
shall probably face the long-term effects on orthopedic train-
ing, practice, and science worldwide.

Epilogue

COVID-19 presented challenges to the medical profession and 
impacts to orthopaedic and traumatology practices and sur-
gery. Despite attempts at reduction, there remains a substantial 
demand on orthopaedic and trauma care. In this setting, pro-
tecting healthcare professionals with interventions that pro-
mote mental well-being and train healthcare professionals on 
mental help and crisis management is important. We hope that 
the observations and lessons from this pandemic will enhance 
understanding of the mental health risk factors among health-
care professionals including orthopaedic surgeons, and will 
be useful in mounting a better approach towards similar crises 
in the future.
