Abstract.
BACKGROUND: Mindfulness interventions aim to foster greater attention and awareness of present moment experiences.
Uptake of mindfulness programs in the workplace has grown as organizations look to support employee health, wellbeing,
and performance.
OBJECTIVE: In support of evidence-based decision making in workplace contexts, we created an evidence map summa-
rizing physical and mental health, cognitive, affective, and interpersonal outcomes from systematic reviews of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of mindfulness interventions.
METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases to July 2017, dually-screened all reviews, and consulted topic experts
to identify systematic reviews on mindfulness interventions. The distribution of evidence is presented as an evidence map in
a bubble plot.
RESULTS: In total, 175 systematic reviews met inclusion criteria. Reviews included a variety of mindfulness-based inter-
ventions. The largest review included 109 randomized controlled trials. The majority of these addressed general health,
psychological conditions, chronic illness, pain, and substance use. Twenty-six systematic reviews assessed studies conducted
in workplace settings and with healthcare professionals, educators, and caregivers. The evidence map shows the prevalence
of research by the primary area of focus. An outline of promising applications of mindfulness interventions is included.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence map provides an overview of existing mindfulness research. It shows the body of available
evidence to inform policy and organizational decision-making supporting employee wellbeing in work contexts.

Keywords: Systematic review, organizational behavior, complementary and integrative health

Increased use of the complementary integrative
health practice called “mindfulness meditation” is
evident in occupational health. Based on ancient

non-religious practice that facilitates an attentional
stance of detached observation. It is characterized by
paying attention to the present moment with open-
ness, curiosity, and acceptance [1, 2]. Psychologists
and medical providers have turned to mindfulness for
therapeutic use and created manualized protocols to
treat a myriad of clinical conditions such as stress
and chronic pain. Non-clinical populations are using
these protocols to support wellness. The most com-
monly used ones are described in Table 1 [1].

Organizations are adopting approaches such as
mindfulness to improve workplace functioning and
support optimal performance of employees [3].
Prominent companies such as Google, Aetna, and
General Mills are offering employees mindfulness
training to improve their effectiveness [4] and
thirteen percent of U.S. workers report engaging
in mindfulness-enhancing practices [5]. Empirical
research on the effectiveness of mindfulness in the
workplace has accelerated [6–8]. Emerging literature
in organizational psychology and management sug-
gests that mindfulness is linked to better workplace
functioning [9] and recent ﬁndings from research on
human service professionals suggest that cultivating
resilience and mindfulness may assist in preventing
psychological distress burnout and secondary trau-
matic stress [10]. By far the largest base of evidence is
found in disciplines such as biomedicine and health,
evaluating physical, mental, cognitive, affective, and
interpersonal outcomes.

1.1. Objective

The aim of this evidence mapping study is to
present an overview of mindfulness intervention
research and summarize the vast body of ﬁndings
on health and wellness for evidence-based decision-
making in workplace contexts.

2. Methods

Evidence maps are umbrella reviews that are based
on a systematic search of a broad research ﬁeld [11].
Systematic reviews search multiple sources, screen
studies against inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
summarize results across studies, often aggregating
data in meta-analyses. To give a broad indication of
the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions, we
used the results reported across randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) as they provide the most rigorous
research design for intervention assessment.

2.1. Data sources and searches

We searched AMED (Allied and Complemen-
tary Medicine database), Campbell Collaboration
database, CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews), CINAHL, DARE (Database of Abstracts
of Reviews of Effects), PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus,
and the Web of Science to identify English-language

Interventions based on Mindfulness Meditation

Description

In addition to mindfulness meditation, MBSR involves teaching of body scan or
yoga to encourage open non-judgmental observation and acceptance of painful
or unpleasant sensation, negative thoughts, or emotions instead of cognitively
appraising them, and increasing anticipatory anxiety, avoidance, or other
maladaptive patterns.

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy

In addition to mindfulness meditation, MBCT encourages acceptant

Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention

(MBRP)

non-judgmental observation of negative thoughts and emotions instead of their
cognitive appraisal triggering ruminative negative thoughts, and habitual
emotional reactivity.

In addition to mindfulness meditation, MBRP teaches relapse prevention skills,
and non-judgmental, open and acceptant observation of cravings. It aims to
decouple the negative thoughts and emotions that are associated with cravings,
and relapse.

Mindfulness Training for Smoking (MTS)

In addition to mindfulness meditation, MTS provides targeted training in how to

used for smoking cessation.

In addition to mindfulness meditation, MORE teaches neutral, open, and acceptant
observation of painful sensations. It also incorporates positive psychology, and
behavioral techniques directed towards neuroscientiﬁc underpinnings of
addiction.

systematic reviews focusing on mindfulness inter-
ventions from database inception to July 2017.
Additionally, we screened published reviews of
reviews and consulted with topic experts. This
research builds on a larger project to inform evidence-
based decision making at the US Department of
Veterans Affairs [12]. The project was supported by
an expert panel.

2.2. Study selection

To be included in the evidence map, publica-
tions had to meet the following four criteria. First,
they had to be systematic reviews of mindful-
ness interventions summarizing primary research. We
included publications that self-identiﬁed as a “sys-
tematic review,” documented the search sources, and
accounted for identiﬁed studies. Reviews including
community dwelling participants using mindful-
ness for any health-related indication were eligible.
Reviews of adults or unspeciﬁed age groups were
included; reviews exclusively focusing on children,
adolescents, or elderly participants were excluded.
In addition, broad reviews not speciﬁc to mind-
fulness were eligible if the term “mindfulness”
was part of the search strategy and reviews with
search strategies that did not specify any interven-
tion (e.g., focused on a patient population) and that
identiﬁed mindfulness studies were also included.
Reviews that included mindfulness studies but did
not systematically search for these (e.g., by reviewing
“meditation” interventions where only those mind-
fulness studies were found that used the descriptive
term “meditation”) were excluded. Third, health
and wellbeing measures, including physical, men-
tal, cognitive, and affective outcomes were eligible.
We included clinical conditions or wellness out-
comes that affect working adults (e.g., diabetes or
depression) but we excluded psychosis or intel-
lectual disability-focused reviews. Frequency of
use, cost, study design features, intervention fea-
tures, or physiological or mechanistic outcomes
(e.g., neurobiological changes) were also excluded.
We included English-language reviews regardless
of language of included studies and publication
date.

Two literature reviewers independently screened
the search results. Citations deemed potentially rel-
evant by at least one reviewer were obtained as full
text. Full text publications were screened against the
inclusion criteria by both independent reviewers; dis-
agreements were resolved through discussion. We

documented reasons for exclusion and recorded the
literature ﬂow in an electronic database.

2.3. Data abstraction and critical appraisal

A content expert and experienced systematic
reviewer extracted the review topic, number of
included mindfulness RCTs, the comparator, and the
results using a pilot tested data extraction form. We
documented the format type of mindfulness interven-
tion used, differentiating structured programs such
as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or
Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and
other mindfulness-based intervention approaches.
We abstracted the author-reported results using the
documented metrics such as standardized mean dif-
ferences (SMD) together with the 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI). To address the validity of the systematic
review, we extracted whether the review was pub-
lished by an organization known for their expertise
and high quality systematic reviews (e.g., Cochrane
reviews).

2.4. Data synthesis and analysis

The evidence base was distilled into a broad visual
overview using the format of a bubble plot. We used
ﬁve dimensions to display information: the x-axis;
y-axis; and the number, size, and color of the bubbles.
Topic (number of bubbles): We used the topics
reported by the review authors to categorize the
reviews. Reviews focused on outcomes or clinical
indications. All identiﬁed systematic reviews were
allocated to a single content area and did not enter
the bubble plot multiple times. Literature size (y-
axis): We used the number of included RCTs in the
largest review on a topic area as the research vol-
ume estimate. The plot includes systematic reviews
that have explicitly searched for RCTs but did not
ﬁnd any on the topic. Reviews vary in their inclu-
sion criteria but a well-established research design,
such as an RCT, is likely to be included in all reviews
and provides a broad estimate of the research vol-
ume. Effect (x-axis): The evidence map provides a
very broad indication of the effectiveness of mindful-
ness interventions per the outcomes reported in RCTs
(differentiating evidence of potentially no effect,
unclear evidence, and evidence of a potential positive
effect). Most emphasis was given to the largest review
(which should provide the most complete literature
synthesis), Cochrane reviews (given their method-
ological rigor), or reports from agencies specializing

208

L.G. Hilton et al. / Mindfulness for workplace wellness

in unbiased systematic reviews such as Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reports.
Systematic reviews (bubble size): We used the size
of the bubble to document the number of reviews on
the topic. Workplace setting (color): We highlighted
evidence exclusively addressing workplace interven-
tions and employee wellness (i.e., social workers,
healthcare providers).

The evidence base was summarized in a narra-
tive synthesis. All included systematic reviews are
included in the reference section to provide more
information for the interested reader.

3. Results

The search identiﬁed 1,024 citations. Title and
abstract screening yielded 320 publications which
we obtained as full text. We identiﬁed 175 unique
systematic reviews meeting the inclusion criteria
[13–187].

The distribution of evidence is shown in Fig. 1. The
y-axis shows that many research studies have eval-
uated mindfulness interventions. The largest review,
that included research studies evaluating mindfulness
interventions and that reported on health outcomes
(health-all), included 109 RCTs [21].

The large number of bubbles demonstrates that
mindfulness approaches have been applied in a vari-
ety of individual applications, addressing different
participant groups, clinical indications, or health out-
comes. The evidence map differentiated 39 topic
areas to document the available research. The num-
ber of systematic reviews per topic area ranged from
a single review to 18 identiﬁed systematic reviews
published on the topic.

The evidence map aims to give a broad indication
of the effectiveness of the interventions. The map doc-
uments that a large proportion of the existing evidence
base is unclear with respect to the effectiveness of the
interventions. Reviews either included only a single
study without replication of results, reported conﬂict-
ing results across studies or did not provide summary
estimates across studies, while reviews sometimes
came to different conclusions.

3.1. Mindfulness interventions in work contexts

We identiﬁed 28 reviews that addressed the health
and wellness of healthcare professionals, social work-
ers, informal caregivers, educators, or general work
populations.

Twelve systematic reviews focused on outcomes
for healthcare professionals [64, 76, 83, 109, 110,
113, 114, 121, 132, 155, 159, 177]. The largest review
included 17 RCTs [155], reported positive results,
and suggested that MBSR and mindfulness medita-
tion are effective in reducing nurses’ state anxiety
(SMD –0.78; CI –1.39 to –0.18; 6 RCTs) and depres-
sion (SMD –0.51; CI –0.78 to –0.18, 4 RCTs) but not
trait anxiety (SMD –0.67; –1.52, 0.18; 3 RCTs) or
stress (SMD –0.34; CI –2.67, 1.99; 5 RCTs) [155]. A
second review reported reduced stress (SMD –0.54;
CI –0.85, –0.24; 3 RCTs) but no statistically sig-
niﬁcant effect for anxiety, depression, or burnout
[109]. A review on compassion fatigue identiﬁed
only one relevant RCT [177] and a review on stress
management in medical education did not identify
any relevant RCTs [64]. The remaining reviews did
not provide intervention effect estimates, reported no
summary for mindfulness interventions, or did not
report effects for RCTs speciﬁcally [76, 83, 110, 113,
114, 121, 132, 159].

We identiﬁed seven reviews of mindfulness inter-
ventions for informal or family caregivers [101,
108, 118, 135, 136, 161, 176];
three of these
focused exclusively on MBSR and MBCT [101, 108,
136]. A meta-analysis showed positive effects post-
intervention for stress (Hedges g 0.57; CI 0.23, 0.92;
3 RCTs) and depression (Hedges’ g –0.62; CI –0.97,
–0.27; 3 RCTs) [136]. The other reviews did not
present summary effects [116, 132, 156, 169].

Three reviews were found on educators and they
summarized a mix of MBSR and other mindfulness
interventions. The largest review with 12 RCTs found
unclear results of an effect of mindfulness on anxi-
ety, depression, stress and burnout [112]. A second
review showed unclear evidence for teacher func-
tioning [171] and the third described positive results
for teacher well-being and performance but did not
provide a summary estimate [167].

Four reviews addressed general workplace popu-
lations [145, 164, 168, 170]. The largest included nine
RCTs evaluating interventions on ofﬁce staff, health-
care professionals, and teachers and found positive
effects on distress but did not report effect estimates
for RCT data [145]. Another review focused on job
burnout and reported that the majority of the stud-
ies showed positive results but did not report an
effect estimate [168]. A third review included peo-
ple who work in manufacturing, healthcare, ofﬁces,
and schools found mixed results for stress, burnout,
and general mental health [170]. A fourth evaluated
brief mental health and well-being interventions in

organizational settings; the review did not stratify
effects by intervention but identiﬁed one mindfulness
meditation study [164].

We identiﬁed a Cochrane review dedicated to iden-
tifying workplace interventions for reducing sitting
at work [175]. The review reported that mindfulness
training did not reduce workplace sitting time but
the result was based on only one study. One review
focused exclusively on social workers but did not
identify any relevant RCTs [146].

3.2. Most promising areas in health and wellness

Six systematic reviews addressed mindfulness
interventions in chronic illness [42, 46, 117, 151,
182, 188]. The largest included 59 RCTs and did
not present summary estimates but concluded there
is partial evidence for mindfulness-based interven-
tions to provide short-term beneﬁts across a wide
range of lifestyle medicine-relevant populations and
study outcomes [182]. A review of chronic somatic
diseases reported positive effects for psychologi-
cal distress (SMD 0.32; CI 0.13, 0.50; 3 RCTs),
depression (SMD 0.26; CI 0.18, 0.34; 6 RCTs), and
anxiety (SMD 0.47; CI 011, 0.83; 4 RCTs) compar-
ing MBSR to waitlist and support groups [46]. The
remaining reviews did not provide summary effect
estimates for mindfulness-based interventions. Many
reviews addressed pain [28, 30, 40, 81, 88, 130, 149,
152, 156, 165, 179, 184, 186]. The largest review
included 38 RCTs on various mindfulness interven-
tions including MBCT, MBSR, and others [130] and
found low-quality evidence that mindfulness med-
itation is associated with a small decrease in pain
compared with treatment as usual, passive controls,
or education/support groups (SMD, 0.32; 95% CI,
0.09, 0.54; 30 RCTs) and moderate-quality evidence
for quality of life from mindfulness meditation as
compared with treatment as usual, support groups,
education, stress management, and waitlist controls
(SMD, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.22, 0.76; 16 RCTs). Similarly,
an earlier review reported positive pooled effects
(MD –0.96; CI –1.64, –0.34); 4 RCTs) [152] while
two other older reviews found no statistically sig-
niﬁcant effects for pain intensity, pain acceptance,
or perceived pain control [88, 186]. Our searches
identiﬁed ﬁve reviews of various mindfulness inter-
ventions for substance use [25, 50, 73, 134, 173]. The
largest review included 34 RCTs [134]. Interventions
evaluated in the review included Mindfulness-Based
Relapse Prevention (MBRP), Mindfulness-Oriented
Recovery Enhancement (MORE), and mindfulness

treatment. The effects of mindfulness interventions
compared to psychotherapeutic treatment and inac-
tive controls were positive for substance use measures
(Cohen’s d –0.33; CI –0.49, –0.17; 6 RCTs) and crav-
ing (Cohen’s d –0.68; CI –1.11, –0.25; 9 RCTs).

We identiﬁed seven systematic reviews that
addressed psychological wellbeing (psychological-
all) [13, 75, 77, 80, 84, 95, 96]. The largest review
included 36 RCTs and was based on an AHRQ
report on meditation programs for psychological
stress and wellbeing, which classiﬁed MBSR, MBCT,
Vipassana, Zen, and other mindfulness meditation
as mindfulness-based [13, 189]. The review reported
positive effects for anxiety (Cohen’s d 0.38; CI 0.12,
0.64; at 8 weeks; 0.22; CI 0.02, 0.43; at 3–6 months;
8 RCTs total), depression (0.30; CI –0.00, 0.59; at
8 weeks; 0.23; CI 0.05, 0.42 at 3–6 months; 10
RCTs total); and pain (0.33; CI, 0.03 to 0.62; 4
RCTs) compared to control interventions matched
in time and attention [13]. The AHRQ report also
showed a positive effect on negative affect (gen-
eral anxiety, stress/distress, and depression outcomes
combined; SMD –0.34; CI –0.53, –0.14; 10 RCTs).
Data on stress/distress varied by comparator, and the
pooled results for the mental health related quality
of life, positive affect, and sleep were negative, and
there was insufﬁcient evidence for positive mood.
Another large review with 17 RCTs reported an effect
size of Cohen’s d 0.396 (CI 0.19, 0.61; 17 RCTs)
across all psychological outcomes compared, pri-
marily, to waitlist [77]. The review considered 48
different psychological variables and reported pos-
itive pooled effects for stress (SMD 0.792; CI 0.371,
1.123; 4 RCTs), distress (SMD 0.547; CI 0.193,
0.901; 6 RCTs), depression (SMD 0.512; CI 0.164,
0.861; 5 RCTs), and anxiety (SMD 0.435; CI 0.141,
0.729; 3 RCTs). It concluded that MBSR compared
to waitlist is effective across a broad range of psycho-
logical outcomes but comparisons with other forms of
treatment are less favorable. The Campbell Collabo-
ration review on MBSR also reported positive results
for individual as well as combined mental health
outcomes (SMD 0.53; CI 0.46, 0.61; 26 RCTs), mea-
sures of personal development (SMD 0.50; CI 0.35,
0.66; 12 RCTs), and quality of life (SMD 0.57; CI
0.17, 0.96; 4 RCTs) [79]. The review also addressed
other health beneﬁts (health-MBSR) and included
31 RCTs [79]. The review included training pro-
grams based on the protocol elements speciﬁed by
Kabat-Zinn (body-scan exercises, mental exercises
focusing attention on breathing, physical exercises
focusing on the awareness of bodily sensations, and

L.G. Hilton et al. / Mindfulness for workplace wellness

211

the practice of being fully aware during everyday
activities). It reported positive effects for the com-
bined outcome mental health (SMD 0.53; CI –0.43,
0.64; 26 RCTs) and somatic health (SMD 0.31; CI
0.10, 0.52; 10 RCTs) compared to waitlist and usual
care. The review concluded that MBSR has a moder-
ate and consistent effect on many measures of mental
health for a wide range of target groups and appears
to improve elements of personal development such
as empathy and coping, enhances mindfulness and
quality of life, and improves some aspects of somatic
health. The review also noted that there is a lack of
data on social function, work ability, and long-term
effects.

We identiﬁed 12 systematic reviews focusing on
depression [32, 35, 37, 51, 56, 66, 70, 74, 85, 87,
106, 119] and the largest included 16 RCTs [119].
Their meta-analysis estimated the effect of MBCT in
a group format compared to waitlist or no treatment,
and this pooled analyses produced large effects for
depression (SMD –0.76; CI –0.95, –0.56; 16 RCTs)
[119]. The Campbell Collaboration review on MBSR
supported the positive ﬁndings (SMD 0.54; CI 0.35,
0.74; 9 RCTs) [79]. Further, an AHRQ report on
mindfulness meditation programs reported positive
effects for depression (SMD 0.30; CI 0.00, 0.59;
at 8 weeks; 0.23; CI 0.05, 0.42 at 3–6 months; 10
RCTs) [13]. We identiﬁed 18 systematic reviews that
addressed the role of mindfulness interventions in
cancer care (cancer support) [18, 20, 29, 31, 34,
36, 39, 45, 55, 58, 60, 62, 94, 103, 120, 143, 147,
169, 190]. The largest review included ten RCTs
and reported that compared to usual care, signiﬁ-
cant post-intervention effects of MBSR or MBCT
were found for health-related quality of life (SMD
0.21; CI 0.04,.39), fatigue (SMD –0.28; CI –0.43,
–0.14), sleep (SMD –0.23; CI –0.40, –0.05), stress
(SMD –0.33; CI –0.61, –0.05), anxiety (SMD –.28;
CI –0.39, –0.16), and depression (SMD –0.34; CI
–0.46, –0.21). Effects were maintained for six months
for anxiety and depression but average effects were
all below the threshold of minimal clinically impor-
tant differences. Two other reviews reported positive
effects for mental health outcomes (Cohen’s d 0.37;
CI 0.10, 0.64; 4 RCTs) and quality of life (SMD 0.32;
CI 0.06, 0.57; 2 RCTs) [20, 55]. The other reviews did
not provide summary effects for RCT data on mind-
fulness interventions. We identiﬁed six systematic
review addressing stress [26, 27, 52, 100, 104, 148];
the largest one focused on undergraduate students
and included nine RCTs [100]. The second largest
review reported a summary effect estimate, indicat-

ing a medium effect for perceived stress (Hedges g
0.432; CI 0.202, 0.662; 8 RCTs) [104].

Positive effects were also found across studies and
reviews for somatization, anxiety, irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS), sleep, and, as discussed above, care-
givers, but the areas have a smaller evidence base,
both in terms of primary research and published
reviews.

4. Conclusion

The evidence map provides a broad overview of the
available research evidence on mindfulness interven-
tions. These ﬁndings support and extend the current
efforts underway to apply mindfulness interventions
in work contexts to enhance employee health, well-
ness, and performance [3, 9, 191]. Most research is
related to general overviews of health beneﬁts. Evi-
dence of potential positive effects is documented for
the topic areas chronic illness, pain, substance use,
depression, anxiety, perceived stress, somatization,
cancer support, and IBS. Mindfulness interventions
appear to have general beneﬁts for a range of psycho-
logical variables and research shows effects of MBSR
on a variety of health outcomes and positive effects
on caregivers have been documented. Mindfulness
interventions have been applied to a large range of
clinical indications but many areas are still based on
only a small number of robust research studies.

The evidence summarizing workplace mindfulness
interventions focused on groups of professionals and
healthcare providers in particular. Systematic reviews
of RCTs conducted in work contexts show promise
for healthcare providers, nurses, and medical students
but require further research for more deﬁnitive evi-
dence statements. Positive effects are documented for
caregiver burden in caregivers. These ﬁndings echo
evidence from the organizational science literature
[192]. Findings of effects of mindfulness interven-
tions for educators were mixed. Additionally, barriers
of feasibility and sustainability of interventions for
healthcare professionals may exist, requiring further
exploration [193, 194].

The evidence map has several limitations. First,
the map only provides a broad overview and is
not designed to provide detailed and deﬁnitive
information on the effectiveness of interventions.
Interested stakeholders should review the identi-
ﬁed systematic reviews of interest to obtain a more
detailed summary. Furthermore, the evidence sug-
gests differential effects of MBSR, MBCT, and other

212

L.G. Hilton et al. / Mindfulness for workplace wellness

mindfulness-based interventions, and deﬁnitions of
“mindfulness-based” varied widely in the studies
contributing to the research ﬁeld. Effects of interven-
tions are likely to vary by intervention characteristics
and the comparator and the available research is based
on a large spectrum of interventions. Interventions
included reviews contributing to the evidence map
were offered by healthcare professionals in a clinical
context and it is unclear how easily the approaches
will translate to work context applications (e.g., a
mindfulness meditation course for employees to sup-
port wellbeing or work performance). Finally, this
evidence map was designed to support wellbeing in
the workplace and excluded interventions for clinical
indications such as psychosis; more information on
topics outside the scope of work can be found in an
earlier clinically-oriented research report [12].

This evidence map provides a very broad overview
of the evidence base indicating areas in which
research has been conducted. The results can be used
to help workplace setting stakeholders interpret the
state of the evidence. The map aims to inform pol-
icy and organizational decision making in support of
employee wellbeing in work contexts.
