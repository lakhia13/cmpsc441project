Abstract

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depressed adults. CBT inter-
ventions are complex, as they include multiple content components and can be delivered in dif-
ferent ways. We compared the effectiveness of different types of therapy, different components
and combinations of components and aspects of delivery used in CBT interventions for adult
depression. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in adults with a
primary diagnosis of depression, which included a CBT intervention. Outcomes were pooled
using a component-level network meta-analysis. Our primary analysis classified interventions
according to the type of therapy and delivery mode. We also fitted more advanced models to
examine the effectiveness of each content component or combination of components. We
included 91 studies and found strong evidence that CBT interventions yielded a larger
short-term decrease in depression scores compared to treatment-as-usual, with a standardised
difference in mean change of −1.11 (95% credible interval −1.62 to −0.60) for face-to-face
CBT, −1.06 (−2.05 to −0.08) for hybrid CBT, and −0.59 (−1.20 to 0.02) for multimedia CBT,
whereas wait list control showed a detrimental effect of 0.72 (0.09 to 1.35). We found no evidence
of specific effects of any content components or combinations of components. Technology is
increasingly used in the context of CBT interventions for depression. Multimedia and hybrid
CBT might be as effective as face-to-face CBT, although results need to be interpreted cautiously.
The effectiveness of specific combinations of content components and delivery formats remain
unclear. Wait list controls should be avoided if possible.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a common psychiatric condition and a leading cause of disability
worldwide (Bridges, 2014; World Health Organization, 2018). Globally, depression affects
more than 300 million people and is associated with marked personal, social and economic
morbidity, loss of functioning and productivity, and high levels of health-care service use
(National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2009; Thapar et al., 2012).

The effects of psychological interventions for treatment of adult depression have been
shown to be comparable to those achieved with pharmacological intervention, and are prob-
ably longer-lasting (Cuijpers and Gentili, 2017). In particular, cognitive-behavioural therapy
(CBT) is a common and effective psychological intervention for the treatment of depression
(Churchill et al., 2002; Butler et al., 2006; National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2009;
Shafran et al., 2009; Lepping et al., 2017). CBT is considered a ‘family’ of related therapies
(Beck, 2005; Mansell, 2008), and intervention protocols variously incorporate a range of com-
ponents such as psychoeducation, homework, behavioural activation, and problem solving.
These can be used alone or in multiple combinations.

CBT interventions are complex, as they often include multiple therapeutic components and
can be delivered in a number of ways. Whilst more usually administered in a traditional
face-to-face setting (either individually or in groups), CBT is increasingly conducted via multi-
media platforms (Button et al., 2012). Multimedia CBT interventions can be provided with
varying amounts of therapist interaction, with ‘self-help’ or ‘self-directed’ approaches charac-
terised by a standardised treatment protocol that is followed by the patient without face-to-face
contact with the therapist (Cuijpers and Kleiboer, 2017). Hybrid CBT interventions, including

1938

both face-to-face sessions and multimedia features, are also pos-
sible. Moreover, in a context where CBT is often not accessible
for patients who could benefit from it (Shafran et al., 2009;
Wiles et al., 2012), multimedia and hybrid interventions consti-
tute promising alternatives to improve coverage for depressed
adults (Cuijpers and Kleiboer, 2017).

The proliferation of CBT interventions raises questions about
the relative effectiveness of different components and combina-
tions of components of CBT interventions, as well as different
delivery formats, and it is important to understand these effects
both for clinical practice and for the development of novel inter-
ventions, such as hybrid interventions. Attempts to assess the
effectiveness of different components/combinations of compo-
nents of CBT for adult depression have largely taken the form
of dismantling studies where two combinations of components
are directly compared (Jacobson et al., 1996; Vázquez et al.,
2015). Likewise, pairwise meta-analyses of studies comparing
two intervention types (e.g.
face-to-face v. multimedia CBT)
have been conducted (Cuijpers et al., 2010). However, the number
of components and therapy types that can be examined using
these approaches is limited. Furthermore, this does not allow
the different process and content components of CBT to be sim-
ultaneously assessed. In this paper we explore the use of network
meta-analysis to estimate the relative effectiveness of different con-
tent components and delivery formats reported in RCTs of CBT
for depression, allowing the synthesis of a broader set of studies
than dismantling studies and pairwise meta-analyses of a single inter-
vention feature.

Network meta-analysis (NMA) (Higgins and Whitehead, 1996;
Caldwell et al., 2005; Dias et al., 2013) allows pooling evidence on
multiple interventions from a set of RCTs, each of which compare
two or more of the interventions of interest. This provides a more
inclusive approach than pairwise meta-analysis, since all pairwise
comparisons of interventions can be examined (Melendez-Torres
et al., 2015). If each combination of components and delivery
method is considered a separate intervention, then NMA could
be used to simultaneously compare the different interventions.
However, NMA requires that the comparisons made by the RCTs
form a connected network, in other words that there is a path of
comparisons between any two included interventions. This is
unlikely to be the case with complex interventions, such as CBT,
because there are a large number of component and delivery com-
binations. Even if such a network is connected, the resulting analysis
may lead to imprecise estimates.

Recently, component-level NMA regression methods have
been developed to allow estimation of the additive contribution
of components and/or combinations of components of complex
interventions – such as CBT interventions – while fully respecting
the randomized structure of the evidence (Welton et al., 2009).
This approach allows meaningful conclusions on effectiveness
of components of complex interventions, whilst overcoming
issues with connected networks and low precision with standard
NMA. The use of component-level NMA in psychological inter-
ventions has been previously illustrated (Welton et al., 2009;
Cooper et al., 2012; Caldwell and Welton, 2016) and has the
potential to address specific research questions as to what aspects
of complex interventions are effective.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive systematic review
of RCTs of adult outpatients with depression where the effective-
ness of one or more CBT interventions was examined. We aimed
to compare the effectiveness of different types of therapy, different
components and combinations of components and aspects of

delivery used in CBT interventions. We pooled study results
using NMA and component-level NMA.

Methods

Study eligibility and selection

An extended description of the methods of this review is available
in the published protocol (Davies et al., 2018). Eligible studies
were randomised controlled trials (RCT) including adults (⩾18
years) with a primary diagnosis of depression, in which the effect-
iveness of a CBT intervention during an acute phase of depression
had been compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU), no treatment,
wait list, psychological/attention placebo, and/or another CBT
intervention. We considered CBT in its broadest sense as a family
of related therapies. TAU definitions showed substantial variation
across studies (a table with the verbatim descriptions of TAU across
studies is provided in Web Appendix 2). In order to fully represent
the broad spectrum of severity of depressive symptoms encountered
in outpatient settings, we included both studies using standardised
diagnostic criteria (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV-TR, DSM-5 or
ICD-10) and those using a validated depression symptom question-
naire to identify depression based on a recognised threshold. We
excluded studies focused on other disorders, studies involving inpa-
tients, and articles written in languages other than English.

The primary outcome was depression score measured on any
scale, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.
Our primary analyses focused on short-term effects, using the earli-
est measure after end of the intervention. We were also interested in
mid-term effects (follow-up between 3 and 12 months after end of
intervention) and long-term effects (beyond 12 months).

Secondary outcomes included outcomes designed to measure
quality of life (with higher scores indicating better quality of life),
remission, response, and attrition. For remission the definitions
articulated in the primary studies were included. Response was
defined as a decrease in depression scores of at least 50% from base-
line to follow-up. Attrition related to the intervention phase and was
included as an indicator of (inter alia) intervention acceptability.

Information sources

separate searches of

We searched MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE, (1974-), PsycINFO
(1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials
(CENTRAL) via the specialised register of the Cochrane Common
Mental Disorders Group (CCMD-CTR) to 10 June 2016. This regis-
ter contains over 40 000 reports of RCTs for common mental dis-
orders (see Web Appendix 1 for further details). For the purpose
of this network meta-analysis, we included studies identified from
four
for a suite of
Cochrane reviews (Hunot et al., 2010, 2013; Churchill et al.,
2013). Each search used a sensitive list of terms for intervention.
We did not apply any restrictions on date, language or publication
status to the searches. Supplementary searches were conducted for
multi-media v. face-to-face CBT and complemented with additional
searches to ensure that all relevant psychological and control inter-
ventions had been included were also conducted. Details of the
CCMD-CTR search strategy are reported in Web Appendix 1.

studies, protocols, and trial register entries were contacted for
additional information when necessary. Risk of bias was assessed
by two reviewers independently using the Cochrane risk of bias
tool (Higgins et al., 2011).

We included CBT interventions implemented with any com-
bination of content components and delivered in any format.
CBT interventions were classified by mode of delivery as either
face-to-face CBT, multimedia CBT, or hybrid CBT (defined as
multimedia CBT with one or more face-to-face sessions). We
also recorded the number and average length of sessions. We
defined multimedia CBT as any standardised CBT approach
delivered using one, or a combination of, the following: self-help
books, audio/video recordings, telephone, computer programmes
(both online and desktop), apps, e-mail, or text messages. Web
Appendix 2 gives the coding of intervention delivery components
that we extracted, based on components commonly found in CBT
interventions (Cuijpers and Kleiboer, 2017). The content compo-
nents were derived using a method adapted from other reviews
involving qualitative assessment of the intervention information
provided in the trial reports (Faggiano et al., 2008; Hetrick
et al., 2015), with reference to the UCL competences framework
(University College London, 2018) and the Cognitive Therapy
Rating Scale (Blackburn et al., 2001). Potential components
were first discussed with the steering group of this project –
this group included psychologists, psychiatrists and academic
researchers with expertise in CBT. These components were then
piloted on the published literature and refined iteratively, in dis-
cussion with the author team.

Data synthesis and statistical analysis

We constructed network plots to illustrate which interventions
had been compared within RCTs for each of the outcomes and
time periods of interest, with node size and line thickness propor-
tional to the number of patients contributing to each intervention
and intervention comparison, respectively.

life
For continuous outcomes (depression and quality of
scores), we adopted a complete case analysis approach for the
change from baseline to follow-up, assumed to follow a Normal
likelihood. Due to the different measurement scales used across
studies, we pooled results on a standardised scale, summarised
as a standardised difference in mean change (sDIMC). This
index compares the mean change from baseline to follow-up
between two groups
(Rubio-Aparicio
et al., 2018), and is interpreted in the same way as a standardised
mean difference. For studies that do not report mean change from
baseline, we derived this from the baseline and follow-up scores
where the standard error is estimated by assuming a correlation
between baseline and follow-up scores. We estimated the correl-
ation between baseline and follow-up scores from studies that
report baseline, follow-up and change from baseline summaries,
which gave an average value of 0.7. We used this value for studies
that only reported baseline and follow-up scores.

in standardised units

For binary outcomes, we used intention-to-treat results (where
available). We assumed a binomial likelihood, where the probabil-
ity of the outcome is modelled on the log-odds scale, giving
pooled intervention effects as log odd ratios, which we present
as odds ratios (ORs) to facilitate interpretation of our findings.
Although we assumed that participants lost to follow-up did
not experience the event of interest in our main analyses, we
also ran sensitivity analyses assuming the ‘best case scenario’

where all participants lost to follow-up experienced remission/
response.

For each outcome we conducted NMAs and component-level
NMAs to pool all evidence in the network. We considered models
with increasing levels of detail to define interventions in the
NMAs, namely: (1) Therapy Effects Model, where comparisons
were made between TAU, no treatment, wait list, psychological/
attention placebo, face-to-face CBT, hybrid CBT, and multimedia
CBT; (2) Main Effects Model, in which the previous approach was
extended to examine the effect of each individual component of
in a network
CBT interventions, assumed to be additive,
meta-regression model; and (3) Full Interaction Model, in which
each delivery format and combination of components was consid-
ered as a separate intervention (Welton et al., 2009). All results are
reported relative to TAU as the reference intervention but esti-
interventions can be obtained.
mates between any pair of
Additional details about the NMA models are provided in Web
Appendix 3.

We pre-specified (Davies et al., 2018) characteristics of inter-
vention delivery, including delivery format (group v. individual),
intensity (defined as the product of the number of sessions and
the average length of each session divided by 100), patient-
therapist interaction (one-way v. two-way), tailored v. untailored
CBT interventions, and format of multimedia CBT interventions.
Where there was sufficient evidence to fit the models, we explored
the influence of these potential effect modifiers using network
meta-regression. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding
studies at high risk of bias on domains other than blinding and
explored small-sample bias by including the inverse standard
errors as a covariate using network meta-regression.

The NMAs were implemented in a Bayesian framework using
OpenBUGS software (version 3.2.3). We assessed convergence
based on two chains, through examination of Brooks-Gelman-
Rubin diagnostic plots and history plots. All models presented
achieved a satisfactory level of convergence. Model fit was assessed
by examining the posterior mean residual deviance and deviance
information criterion (DIC). We performed a weighted integration
of the evidence through fitting both fixed and random effects network
meta-analysis models; however, we only present the random effects
model due to severe lack of fit for fixed effect models (see Web
Appendix 6). Model fit was satisfactory for the random-effects models
presented. Inconsistency was assessed by comparing the DICs of our
primary analyses (based on NMA models that assume consistency
between direct and indirect evidence) and the DICs yielded by incon-
sistency models (which provide effect estimates based on direct evi-
dence only).

Results

Included studies

We retrieved 91 studies that met our inclusion criteria and
reported results on at least one of the relevant outcomes of the
review. Figure 1 presents a flow chart summarising the search pro-
cess and results. A table of characteristics of included studies is
provided in Web Appendix 4.

Definition of interventions

The most common comparators across studies were TAU (31
arms) and wait list (35 arms). We classified 10 interventions as
attention placebo and 2 interventions as psychological placebo

and merged them into a single category. Moreover, ‘no treatment’
was provided in 7 arms across the included studies.

Regarding CBT interventions, we found 86 arms that imple-
mented face-to-face CBT, 7 arms for hybrid CBT, and 29 arms
for multimedia CBT. Moreover, we identified the following com-
ponents across the included studies: cognitive techniques (87
arms), behavioural activation (80 arms), psychoeducation (40
arms), homework (35 arms), problem solving (29 arms), social
skills training (29 arms), relaxation (27 arms), goal setting (14
arms), final session (ability to end therapy in a planned manner
and to plan for long-term maintenance of gains after treatment
ends, 13 arms), mindfulness CBT (5 arms) and acceptance and
commitment therapy (ACT, 5 arms). Most CBT interventions

Risk of bias in included studies

Most studies were judged to be at a low or unclear risk of bias for

bias and selective reporting. Given the nature of the interventions,
most studies were judged to be at high risk of bias for blinding of
participants and personnel and for blinding of outcome assess-
ment. A more detailed description of risk of bias assessments is
provided in Web Appendix 5 and Web Fig. 1.

Therapy-level NMA results

Change in depression scores
Change in depression scores at short term was the most widely
reported outcome (76 studies, 6973 patients). The structure of
the network and the NMA results for this outcome are shown
in Figs 2a and 2b. There was evidence of a smaller decrease in
depression scores for patients allocated to wait list, compared
with patients who received TAU (sDIMC = 0.72, 95% CrI 0.09
to 1.35). All CBT interventions yielded larger decreases in depres-
sion score compared with TAU, with the biggest effect yielded by
face-to-face CBT (sDIMC = −1.11, 95% CrI −1.62 to −0.60) and
more uncertainty for hybrid CBT (sDIMC = −1.06, 95%
CrI −2.05 to −0.08) and multimedia CBT (−0.59, −1.20 to 0.02).
Change in depression scores at mid-term was reported in 29
studies including 3441 patients (Figs 2c and 2d). There was no

evidence to suggest that any of the CBT therapies differed from
TAU in depression scores at mid-term, although results suggest
that hybrid CBT led to a larger reduction in depression scores
compared with TAU (sDIMC = −1.00, −2.13 to 0.12). However,
the number of studies was not large enough to obtain precise
effect estimates.

Results based on a follow-up period over 12 months were sel-
dom reported across the included studies, which precluded exam-
ination of long-term effects.

Change in quality of life scores
Change in quality of life scores at short term was reported in 15
studies including 2425 patients (Figs 2e and 2f). Intervals around
effect estimates are wide as a consequence of the small number of
studies contributing to the analysis. Nonetheless, there was evidence
of a reduced increase in quality of life scores for wait list compared
with TAU (sDIMC = −1.23, 95% CrI −2.33 to −0.13), and results
also suggest a reduced increase in quality of life scores for multimedia
CBT compared with TAU (sDIMC = −0.58, 95% CrI −1.27 to 0.11).
Insufficient data were available to produce estimates for mid- and
long-term outcomes.

Remission, response, and attrition
The network plot and forest plot of NMA results for remission are
displayed in Figs 3a and 3b, respectively. Results are based on 38
studies including 3391 patients and provide evidence that wait list
(OR 0.33, 95% CrI 0.11 to 1.02) and placebo (OR 0.27, 95% CrI
0.07 to 1.03) have lower remission rates than TAU. The ORs for
CBT interventions suggest higher remission rates compared to
TAU, although the credible intervals are wide and all of them
include the null.

Response – according to our definition – was only reported in
15 studies with a total of 1144 patients, and none of these studies
included a ‘no treatment’ arm (Fig. 3c). Results show wide inter-
vals for all treatment effect estimates (Fig. 3d), with the most pre-
cise estimate yielded by face-to-face CBT and suggesting that this
therapy might increase the probability of response to treatment
compared to TAU (OR 2.55, 95% CrI 0.77 to 9.51).

Attrition was reported in 75 studies including 8075 patients.
The structure of the network and NMA results are shown in
Figs 3e and 3f. We found no evidence of a clear difference in attri-
tion rates among interventions.

We only present results at short term, as remission and
response were not widely reported at longer follow-up periods
and attrition is only meaningful as an indicator of treatment
acceptability if it occurs during the intervention phase.

Component-level NMA results

For each outcome we fitted a main effects component-level NMA
model where we estimated the specific effect each component of
CBT adds to the ‘average’ CBT effect. We were unable to include
mindfulness CBT and ACT components in this analysis, as they
were only included in five studies each.

Results from the Main Effects model (where component effects
are assumed additive) for change in standardised depression
scores at short term are displayed in Fig. 4. The top side of this
figure presents ‘main effects’, which are similar to the therapy
effects for the comparators with the addition of an ‘average’
CBT effect, whereas the bottom of the figure estimates the effect
modification on the overall CBT effect that can be attributed to
interventions with a multimedia component, interventions with

cognitive techniques, and so on. The top half of Fig. 4 shows
that on average, there was strong evidence of a larger decrease
in depression scores in CBT interventions yielded a larger
decrease in depression scores compared to TAU (sDIMC =
−1.77, 95% −2.57 to −1.01), and an increase for wait list com-
pared to TAU (sDIMC = 0.75, 0.09 to 1.41). Regarding effect
modifiers, there was no evidence of a difference between multi-
media and face-to-face CBT interventions (sDIMC = 0.36, −0.24
to 0.96). Moreover, results suggest that interventions that reported
having included a behavioural activation component yielded a
smaller decrease in depression scores compared to other CBT
interventions (sDIMC = 0.54, −0.09 to 1.16). Similar results
were found for other outcomes (Web Appendix 6).

Full interaction component-level NMA model

We relaxed the assumption of additive component effects by fit-
ting a Full Interaction model, where each combination of content
components and delivery mode was considered as a separate CBT
intervention. Using the information reported in the primary stud-
ies, we were unable to find any combinations of content compo-
nents that were reported commonly enough to provide precise
estimates of treatment effects. Instead, we defined a substantial
number of CBT interventions, most of them only implemented
only in one study, which yielded very imprecise estimates for
most intervention effects. Results for change in depression scores
at short term are presented in Web Appendix 6, and results for
other outcomes are available on request.

Additional analyses

Based on model fit statistics, the therapy effects model presented
above gave the best balance between model fit and complexity
(according to the DIC). We therefore only explored further effect
modifiers in relation to the therapy effects model. Regarding effect
modifiers, results suggest that more intense face-to-face CBT
interventions might be more effective in decreasing depressive
symptoms (β = −0.072, 95% CrI −0.168 to 0.023), whereas for
hybrid and multimedia CBT interventions effect modification
for intensity was estimated to be close to 0 although with high
levels of uncertainty (β = −0.010, −0.229 to 0.210). We found
no evidence of effect modification for delivery method (group
individual) neither for face-to-face (β = −0.025, −0.111 to
v.
0.065) nor for hybrid and multimedia interventions (β = −0.043,
−0.258 to 0.175). The influence of other intervention characteris-
tics could not be examined due to lack of comparative evidence –
the vast majority of CBT interventions were tailored and included
two-way interactions, and the format of multimedia interventions
was too heterogeneous across studies to be examined as a factor.
We also ran additional analyses excluding studies assessed at
high risk of bias for random sequence generation, attrition and/
or selective reporting, and found the results were robust to this.
Regarding other types of bias, our analyses assuming a ‘best
case scenario’ for missing data in binary outcomes yielded similar
conclusions as the main analyses for remission, although there
was no evidence of a difference between placebo and TAU (OR
1.21, 95% CrI 0.48 to 3.02). For response, there was evidence of
a higher response rate for face-to-face CBT (OR 2.53, 1.46 to
4.68) and weak evidence (e.g. 95% CrI includes the null) of a
higher response rate for multimedia CBT (OR 2.11, 0.96 to
5.30), compared to TAU (Web Appendix 6). Moreover, we
found evidence of an association between the inverse standard

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and compo-
nent-level NMA of RCTs examining the effectiveness of CBT
interventions for depressed adults. We included a wide range of
CBT interventions, differing in the content components and/or
delivery method, and examined a number of relevant outcomes
(Rush et al., 2006). We found strong evidence that CBT interven-
tions yielded a larger decrease in depression scores compared to
TAU at short term. Results for other outcomes, based on smaller
numbers of studies, were unclear. We found little evidence of dif-
ferential effectiveness of face-to-face v. multimedia CBT interven-
tions, and no strong evidence of specific effects of any content
components or combinations of components. There was substan-
tial uncertainty around effect estimates for most outcomes and
intervention comparisons including attention/psychological pla-
cebo, and some differences in treatment effect for which we
found weak evidence might be due to chance. Nonetheless, com-
pared with TAU, wait list interventions yielded a smaller decrease
in depression scores, smaller increase in quality of life scores and
lower remission rates.

The overall beneficial effect of CBT interventions in improving
depressive symptoms is not surprising and has been reported
before (Butler et al., 2006; Oei and Dingle, 2008; Richards and
Richardson, 2012; Cuijpers and Gentili, 2017). Furthermore, our
findings are in line with previous studies where multimedia
CBT was found to be similarly effective as face-to-face CBT
(Cuijpers et al., 2010), although we emphasise the substantial
uncertainty in the treatment effect estimates showing no differ-
ence between face-to-face and multimedia CBT. Moreover,

lasting effects (Cuijpers and Gentili, 2017). In this respect, we
found some evidence that mid-term results for hybrid and
multimedia interventions are similar to short term (albeit wide
intervals), whereas short-term face-to-face effects were not main-
tained to mid-term.

Limitations

limitations need to be acknowledged, which mostly
Several
represent common issues faced by systematic reviews in this
field and highlight the need for a cautious interpretation of our
results. One major problem we found was inconsistent reporting
of interventions, with some studies providing sufficient detail
about the CBT intervention/s they examined to enable coding
of components, while many others only included a vague descrip-
tion often supported by citations to theoretical references (e.g.
CBT treatment manuals) or previous applications in a similar
context. Thus, our analyses of the specific contribution of differ-
ent components were limited by the description of the interven-
tions provided in the articles, with the potential risks that some
interventions included components that were not reported and
that some of the reported components were not received by all
patients in the study. The importance of identifying and reporting
core components is widely recognised in the field of complex
interventions (Durlak and DuPre, 2008; Hoffmann et al., 2014),
and we believe that a more consistent and complete reporting
of CBT interventions will facilitate the replicability and improve
the understanding of the differential effectiveness of these inter-
ventions for the treatment of adult depression. Specifically, we
call for a wide agreement between clinicians and researchers on
the definition of the core content components that might be
involved in CBT interventions as a first step, followed by a com-
mitment from the scientific community to refer to this consensus

dised differences in mean change from baseline, relative to TAU. Main effects for

errors and the effect estimates for depression at short term (β =
0.04, 0.02 to 0.07), suggesting that larger studies report changes
in depressive symptoms that are closer to the null. This implies
that the evidence we reviewed might be affected by small-sample
bias.

We compared the model fit of consistency and inconsistency
models (Web Appendix 6) and found no evidence of inconsist-
ency between direct and indirect evidence, with the exception of
the response outcome. However, the resulting intervention effect
estimates displayed in Fig. 3d were very similar under both
models.

We also repeated our analyses restricting to studies reporting
depression scores using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
which was reported in 65 studies with a total of 4517 patients.
Results at short and mid-term were comparable to those using
standardised scores across scales (Web Appendix 6), although at
mid-term there was stronger evidence (e.g. values within the
95% CrI were further away from the null) of an effect of CBT
interventions when restricting to studies reporting the BDI.

Discussion

CBT interventions are complex and currently there is little under-
standing about which components and/or combinations of com-
ponents are the most effective in reducing adult depression
(Vázquez et al., 2015). Several novel approaches have been pro-
posed for the synthesis of evidence on complex interventions
(Higgins et al., 2019). In this review we aimed to tackle this gap
by performing a qualitative assessment of the included studies
to identify the content components involved in each CBT inter-
vention, and then undertake component-level NMA to examine
the effectiveness of specific components and combinations of
components.

when reporting CBT interventions in primary studies. In this
vein, the UCL framework (University College London, 2018)
could be a useful starting point.

Relatedly, transparent reporting of TAU in RCTs is often sub-
optimal and, as such, it is typically a heterogeneous grouping in
all reviews. TAU is often used as a comparator in RCTs examining
one or several CBT interventions, and unlike other reviews in this
field, in our systematic review we separated TAU from other com-
parators to reduce heterogeneity. However, TAU definitions
showed substantial variation within and across studies and the
intensity of TAU was often not reported, and this potentially
introduced additional uncertainty in the estimation of interven-
tion effects. A table with the verbatim descriptions of TAU across
studies is provided in Web Appendix 2.

Moreover, most studies included in our systematic review only
reported results based on short follow-up periods, which limited
our analyses of mid-term and long-term effects, and the number
of studies was too small for most outcomes to get precise esti-
mates of intervention effects. Further simulation work is war-
ranted to explore the data requirements, particularly when the
aim is to estimate interaction effects in component-level NMA.
Furthermore, remission was defined in different ways across stud-
ies, which possibly introduced additional heterogeneity in the
analysis of this outcome. Conversely, we only analysed response
rates for studies that reported it according to our definition, but
that yielded a small number of studies.

Last, our definition of ‘face-to-face’ treatments included ther-
apy delivered on an individual basis or in groups. Whilst there
has been some debate in the literature regarding the effectiveness
of group v. individual CBT, evidence from earlier reviews con-
cluded that, on balance, outcomes are similar for these two for-
mats (Tucker and Oei, 2007; Oei and Dingle, 2008) supporting
our decision to combine data accordingly. There was substantial
heterogeneity in terms of the nature of the interventions, in par-
ticular the multimedia interventions. Whilst others have found
that supported computerised interventions are more effective
than unguided treatments (Richards and Richardson, 2012), little
is known regarding the optimum form and nature of this support
and hence given the extent of heterogeneity not only in the
amount of support but also the modality of the intervention
and combinations of delivery, it was not possible to explore this
further.

Implications for future research and clinical practice

Our results have several implications for research and clinical
practice. Technology is increasingly used in the context of CBT
interventions for depression, and our study found that multi-
media and hybrid CBT might be as effective as face-to-face
CBT, although results need to be interpreted cautiously due to
substantial uncertainty and potential small-sample biases. The
effectiveness of specific combinations of content components
and multimedia delivery formats remain unclear. Although this
uncertainty could be explored in future trials/dismantling studies,
prohibitively large samples are likely to be required to have suffi-
cient power to detect the small differences expected (Mohr et al.,
2017). Value of information analyses (Welton et al., 2012) are
recommended to assess whether such a trial would represent
value for money. Regarding specific content components for
CBT interventions, it will be important that there is a full descrip-
tion of techniques consistent with the protocol to enable future

work to build on this. It should also be important to determine
the optimal number and length of sessions in order to optimize
the use of health resources, and to include longer follow-up per-
iods. Last, our results raise concerns on the use of wait list groups
as comparators and suggest that other alternatives should be
considered.

Throughout this paper we acknowledge that CBT interventions
are complex. Our review addressed some of the features of this com-
plexity (Grant and Calderbank-Batista, 2013; Melendez-Torres
et al., 2015), but other qualitative aspects should be considered to
maximize treatment adherence and enhance treatment effective-
ness for specific patient profiles. The importance of a clear descrip-
tion of both CBT interventions and comparators has been remarked
previously (Mansell, 2008), and cannot be emphasised enough. Our
study illustrates that CBT interventions are suitable for the treat-
ment of adult depression as a class, but that further research and
improvements in reporting of intervention descriptions are needed
in order to determine which particular aspects characterise inter-
ventions that lead to the best outcomes for most patients.
