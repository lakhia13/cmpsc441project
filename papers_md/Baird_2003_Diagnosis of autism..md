Diagnosis of autism
Gillian Baird, Hilary Cass, Vicky Slonims

Parents want autism to be diagnosed as early as possible, and early intervention may improve long
term outcomes. The authors of this review discuss the identification and assessment process for
children with autism and autistic spectrum disorder

Autistic spectrum disorders have been the subject of
increasing attention over the past few years—from the
media, from clinicians, and from the general public. Sto-
ries of savants who excel in such skills as calendar calcu-
lations and detailed drawings have long been a
fascination to public and clinician alike, exemplified in
Dustin Hoffman’s portrayal of a young man with autism
in the film Rainman. Most recently, public anxiety about
autism has been raised as a result of reports linking the
measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine with
autism and inflammatory bowel disorder and a rise in
the prevalence of autism.1 2 This has resulted in a serious
fall in immunisation rates,3 despite the epidemiological
evidence of a lack of association,4 and strong reassurance
from the Department of Health and the Royal College
of Paediatrics and Child Health about the safety of the
MMR vaccine. Parents of children with autism continue
to express the view that the medical profession does not
take their concerns about possible causes of autism seri-
ously. “Miracle cures” for autism—for example, with
secretin—have received wide publicity through television
and raised enormous hopes before being placed in their
proper context by double blind trials that have not con-
firmed a curative effect. We consulted recent reviews,
specialist journals, and recent Medline papers on the
diagnosis of autism.

What is autism?

Autism is a behaviourally defined disorder, character-
ised by qualitative impairments in social communica-
tion, social interaction, and social imagination, with a
restricted range of interests and often stereotyped
repetitive behaviours and mannerisms. Sensory hypo-
sensitivities or hypersensitivities to the environment
are common features. Criteria for the diagnosis of
autism are set out in the ICD-10 (international classifi-
cation of diseases, 10th revision) and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition
(DSM-IV). Two important points are essential to an
understanding of this classification framework.

Firstly, although autism is behaviourally defined, it is
now well recognised to be the endpoint of several
organic aetiologies. These include prenatal insults such
as rubella infection, untreated metabolic disorders such
as phenylketonuria, anticonvulsants taken in pregnancy,
localised lesions as in tuberous sclerosis, and postnatal

Summary points

Autism is a behaviourally defined disorder, which
is the endpoint of several organic aetiologies

The number of children diagnosed as having
autistic spectrum disorders is increasing for
various reasons

A diagnosis of autism can be reliably made at
between 2 and 3 years of age

Autism does not meet criteria for screening, but
surveillance throughout the preschool years is
recommended

infections such as encephalitis. However, a specific
medical cause is found in only a minority of people with
autism (6-10% depending on the study), albeit more
often in those with pronounced learning problems.5
Epilepsy occurs more commonly than usual in autism
and was one of the early indications that this was a
neurobiological disorder and not one caused by paren-
tal behaviour. In most people with autism, genetic
factors play a key role.6 Twin studies have shown that in
monozygotic twins the chance of concordance for
autism is 60%, with a greater concordance for some
social impairment, compared with a much lower rate in
dizygotic twins. The rate of autistic spectrum disorders in
singleton siblings is 2-6%, a marked increase above
population rates.7 Multiple genes are likely to be
involved, and linkage studies have identified possible
candidate genes on chromosomes 2q, 7q, 16p, and 19p.
No specific candidate genes have yet emerged. Autism
has been associated with many cytogenetic abnormali-
ties, especially on chromosome 15, and is also found in
fragile X syndrome.8 Although autism is now agreed to
be a neurobiological disorder, results from structural
brain scans have not shown consistency of diagnostic

Secondly, despite the organic basis of the disorder,
the diagnostic criteria have been derived through con-
sensus, rather than being organically based; no biologi-
cal “test” exists for autism. Diagnostic cut-offs have
been hard to define, because the manifestation of the
core impairments and behaviours of autism varies
greatly from person to person, as shown in the table.9 10
Symptoms vary in any single person with autism, and
as autism is a developmental disorder change occurs
over time.10

The diagnostic manuals have undergone several
revisions altering the criteria for autism and its
subcategories, which are defined according to the age
and type of onset, the associated features, and the
severity of the core features (for example, autism or
autistic disorder, Asperger’s syndrome). Attempting to
categorise what is essentially a dimensional disorder is
inevitably problematic; the reliability of subgroups
varies across studies, and their long term relevance is
uncertain.11 Many clinicians find that although the
term “autistic spectrum disorder” does not appear in
either the DSM-IV or the ICD-10, it is much more eas-
ily understood by parents and professionals than “per-
vasive developmental disorders,” which is the terminol-
ogy of the diagnostic manuals. The two terms are now
used almost synonymously. The word “spectrum”
implies several dimensions that need to be described to
give a complete picture of an individual.

Is autism increasing in prevalence?

The number of children diagnosed as having autistic
spectrum disorders is increasing.12 Studies investigating
this phenomenon have concluded that several factors
the increase—for example, changing
account

for

conceptualisation to a spectrum rather than a core cat-
egorical condition; changes in diagnostic methods; and
the inclusion of children with disorders such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette’s
syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis as also having autistic
spectrum disorder. The prevalence of
the broad
spectrum of disorders of autism (determined with cur-
rent diagnostic tools) is agreed to be approximately five
to six per 1000 in younger children. The United King-
dom working party (National Initiative for Autism:
Screening and Assessment (NIASA)—published as the
National Autism Plan for Children13), which reviewed the
evidence, used this estimate as the basis for planning
services for diagnosis and intervention for young
children with autism. Most studies of prevalence have
been carried out in young children (4-5 years of age). As
some features of autism may be more obvious in the
younger child, prevalence ascertained on current
behaviour in adolescence or adult life may be different.

Identification of autism

Until recently, diagnosis of autism was often delayed
until mid-childhood, especially if language delay was
not present.14 Retrospective reports suggest that most
parents identify the onset of first concerns at about 18

Box 1: Features that may discriminate children
with autism early in childhood
• Lack of social smile, lack of appropriate facial
expression, poor attention, impaired social interaction
• Ignoring people, preference for aloneness, lack of
eye contact, lack of appropriate gestures, lack of
emotional expression, less looking at others, less
pointing, less showing objects in the second year

Clinical review

Box 2: Alerting signals of possible autistic spectrum disorder13
• In the first year of life there are usually no clear discriminating features,
but parental concerns should be elicited
• Between 2 and 3 years of age, concerns in the following areas should
prompt referralw1

1. Communication
Impairment in language development, especially comprehension; unusual
use of language; poor response to name; deficient non-verbal
communication—for example, lack of pointing and difficulty following a
point and failure to smile socially to share enjoyment and respond to the
smiling of others

Absolute indicators for referral
• No babble, pointing, or other gesture by 12 months
• No single words by 18 months
• No two word spontaneous (non-echoed) phrases by 24 months
• Any loss of any language or social skills at any agew2

2. Social impairments
Limitation in, or lack of imitation of, actions (for example, clapping); lack of
showing with toys or other objects; lack of interest in other children or odd
approaches to other children. Minimal recognition or responsiveness to
other people’s happiness or distress; limited variety of imaginative play or
pretence, especially social imagination (that is, not joining with others in
shared imaginary games), “in his or her own world;” failure to initiate
simple play with others or participate in early social games; preference for
solitary play activities; odd relationships with adults (too friendly or ignores)

3. Impairment of interests, activities, and other behaviours
Over-sensitivity to sound or touch; motor mannerisms; biting, hitting, or
aggression to peers; oppositional to adults; over-liking for sameness or
inability to cope with change, especially in unstructured setting; repetitive
play with toys (for example, lining up objects); turning light switches on and
off, regardless of scolding

months of age. However, early videos taken by parents
at around the first birthday may show the features in
box 1, which discriminate the child later diagnosed as
having autism from other children of the same age.15

Box 3: Features that may discriminate children with autism in
later childhood13

In school age children, the following features should alert teachers and
others to the possibility of autistic spectrum disorder and trigger discussion
with parents and possible implementation of the local referral pathway

1. Communication impairments
• Abnormalities in language development, including muteness and odd or
inappropriate prosody
• Persistent echolalia
• Reference to self as “you,” “she,” or “he” beyond 3 years
• Unusual vocabulary for child’s age or social group
• Limited use of language for communication or tendency to talk freely
only about specific topics

2. Social impairments
• Inability to join in with the play of other children or inappropriate
attempts at joint play (may manifest as aggressive or disruptive behaviour)
• Lack of awareness of classroom “norms” (criticising teachers; overt
unwillingness to cooperate in classroom activities; inability to appreciate or
follow current trends—for example, with regard to other children’s dress,
style of speech, or interests)
• Easily overwhelmed by social and other stimulation
• Failure to relate normally to adults (too intense or no relationship)
• Showing extreme reactions to invasion of personal space and extreme
resistance to being “hurried”

Studies have shown that a diagnosis of autism can
be reliably made at between 2 and 3 years of age,
although a diagnosis of the broader autistic spectrum
is less reliable at this age than in older children.16 17 Par-
ents want a diagnosis as early as possible, and some
evidence shows that appropriate early intervention
improves outcomes. In addition, genetic advice can be
given at a time when parents are planning their
family.18

Autism, like other developmental disorders, does
the criteria for screening.19 20 However,

surveillance by the parent-professional partnership
and rapid response to concerns throughout
the
preschool years are recommended. Few studies have
been done of the sensitivity of general developmental
screens or specific screening tests for autism in total
populations. In one such study, which used the CHAT
test to screen a total population at the age of 18
months, primary care staff asked parents questions
about pointing, showing, and pretend behaviours and
tested the child for demonstration of these behaviours.
At follow up, the specificity of the test was high (97%)
but sensitivity was too low (35%) to allow recommen-
dation for use as a screening test for the whole popula-
tion.21 Most other “screening” tests for autism have
been used in groups of children already at risk of
developmental problems, in which both sensitivity and
specificity are higher.

More severely affected children (in terms of both
IQ and social communication) usually present in the
preschool years (under 5 years) with language delay.
Higher functioning children tend to have a behav-
ioural led presentation at around 4 or 5 years or subtle
social problems in later childhood. The national autism
plan has suggested that all professionals in contact with
preschool and school age children should have
training in autism and the alerting signals that indicate
possible autistic impairment (box 2).13 Professionals
can then discuss with parents the possibility of a
problem before referral to second tier services.

Concerns about more able children, or those with
Asperger’s syndrome or so called “high functioning”
autism, may not develop until children are exposed to

been thought to be well advanced in their development,

interests or precocious
vocabulary.

Regression

In approximately 25-30% of affected children, obvious
stasis and sometimes clear regression of development
occurs between 15 and 21 months of age. This can
involve loss of word use (usually within the first 10
word stage) accompanied by social withdrawal, loss of
eye contact and play interests, and sometimes change
of sleep and eating habits. Onset of unusual behaviours
such as overfocused looking at objects and flapping or
other mannerisms may also be noted. However, in
many such cases, a careful history reveals that develop-
ment of social communication was subtly abnormal
before the onset of regression, and the lost words may
not have been used communicatively. A more
significant regression may occur in a very small
number of children (7-8%) aged over 2 years after nor-

mal language development beyond the level of two
word phrases. The resultant pattern of behaviour is
indistinguishable from autism of early onset and is
usually associated with severe cognitive delay (also
known as disintegrative developmental disorder).
Regression of skills needs careful medical assessment,
as neurodegenerative conditions, Rett syndrome, and
epilepsy may present in this way. No evidence exists to
show that regression is on the increase.

Assessment process

The purpose of assessment is to confirm the diagnosis,
seek an underlying cause, assess
strengths and
weaknesses in the child and associated developmental
and mental health impairments (comorbidities), assess
family needs, and identify the resources to meet the
needs. For preschool services, referral is usually to the
child development team or centre. For the school age
child the referral pathway is much less clear and may
be to paediatric, child and family psychiatry, or
learning disability services. This can result in different
and uncoordinated pathways of care for child and
family. Autistic spectrum disorders in younger children
can be managed within a child development service, as
the child and family have many features of care need in
common with those with other developmental
problems. However, what makes autism different is the
great variation in presentation, the wide range of skills
and deficits, and the high rate of associated
behavioural, mental health, and often subtle learning
problems—hence the need for a range of available pro-
fessionals. Diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders
should be as local to the child and family as possible,
and all districts need to develop specialist expertise.
Diagnosis is by history taking, focusing on the develop-
mental story and systematically inquiring for core
behaviours, and by observation in several settings. Box
4 outlines the common differential diagnoses.

Several instruments have been developed for history
taking and play based observation of the child—the
autism diagnostic interview and the diagnostic interview
for social and communication disorders (both semi-
structured interviews) and the autism diagnostic
observation schedule (a play based interactive assess-
ment used in both clinical practice and research).22–24
Box 5 summarises
the medical assessment and
investigations.25 Associated features—developmental,
neuropsychiatric, and medical—are common (box 6).

What happens after assessment?

service framework for
The forthcoming national
children emphasises a shift to child and family centred
services. After assessment and explanation, a written
report for parents and all relevant professionals is pro-
vided by the assessing team. Further investigations are
indicated for some children. An action plan for the
family should be produced. This includes access to
information (websites, parent groups), parent training
(for example, Early Bird26), strategies for family support
(a keyworker role is likely to be a recommendation of
the national service framework), and an action plan for
the child. Parents are clear about what they want from
the process of engagement with services (box 7).

Box 4: Common differential diagnoses

Mental retardation or general learning disability
Differentiating autism plus learning disability from learning disability alone
may be difficult in very young or profoundly delayed children; lack of
imitation, poor social relatedness, eye gaze, and gestures indicate autism

Language disorder
Children presenting with receptive language problems may also have
limited imaginative play skills and social impairment with peers

Other specific developmental disorders
Although thought to be particularly associated with Asperger’s syndrome,
clumsiness or incoordination (developmental coordination disorder) can
occur in any of the autistic spectrum disorders

Other disorders causing diagnostic difficulty
• Reactive attachment disorders of childhood after early emotionally
depriving experiences, such as those in Romanian adoptees, may present
overlapping behaviours but also differences from autismw3
• Early onset epilepsy, Rett syndrome, or neurodegenerative disorders

Although research supports the effectiveness of a
range of interventions, no evidence exists to show that
one approach is more successful than others.27 The
emphasis has been on the effectiveness of behavioural
and educational approaches, and some evidence is
emerging that targeted interventions should begin as
early as possible. The educational programmes that
have tended to be most effective for young children
with autism are those that

understanding of what may underlie those behaviours
x Use a structured, visual approach to teaching
x Focus on the development of specific skills and on

x Foster integration with peers.

Evaluation of intervention

A wide variety of interventions have been advocated
for children with autism; these include Lovaas (applied
behavioural analysis) programmes, use of pictures for
expressive communication (as in the picture exchange
exercise pro-
communication system),

Box 6: Associated developmental and mental health impairments
(comorbidities)
• Studies have suggested that 75% of children diagnosed as having autism
will have some learning difficulty. The current figure of 20-25% without
learning difficulty may well be an underestimate; the figure is likely to increase
as higher functioning children are increasingly given a diagnosis of autism
• Specific learning difficulties of attention, processing speed, working
memory, and other tasks often thought of as executive skills are often
impaired in autistic spectrum disorder and contribute to the common
observation of a gap between structured test results where no or few
problems are shown and daily functioning in real life where marked
impairment is found
• Writing difficulties can create a major barrier to output for many high
functioning children. Increasingly, the use of a laptop computer gets around
a problem that often threatens to affect the attitude of the child to the entire
educational process
• The lifetime risk of epilepsy is increased. Early studies suggested that up
to a third of children with autism will develop epilepsy either in early
childhood or in adolescence (many had learning difficulties, and more
recent estimates suggest that prevalence is lower—about 17%)
• Learning disabilities in general are a risk factor for behavioural problems;
41% of children with mild to moderate or severe learning difficulties have
severe emotional behavioural disturbance. Children with autism have
double the rate of “caseness” of psychiatric disorder compared with those
with learning difficultiesw5
• In high functioning autism the risk of psychiatric disorders is also
increased. In a Canadian study 17% of such children were more than two
standard deviations above the population mean for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder and depression, as were 13.5% for anxiety. Other
problems of motor coordination, sleeping, eating, and elimination are also
more common in autismw4

grammes (for example, Higashi), and many other com-
plementary techniques. Therapists, usually funded by
the health service but
increasingly working in
educational settings, are under pressure to show the
effectiveness of therapeutic input. However, as with so
much of a child’s educational experiences, outcomes
are difficult to measure. Schools now recognise the
holistic learning needs of the child, including personal
and emotional growth as well as opportunities to
broaden their experiences, regardless of whether
measurable developmental progress is made.

Box 7: What parents want
• Equality of access and prompt response to concerns with clear, agreed
care pathway or guidelines; sensitive diagnosis by competent professionals;
accurate and relevant information; appropriate investigations
• Prompt provision of educational and therapeutic interventions (including
behavioural strategies) that address functional impairments and teach
through understanding of the effect of autism on the child’s learning
• The streamlining, by multi-agency agreement, of assessment processes to
ensure that children are not subjected to repeat assessments and families
are not continually asked to repeat the same emotionally difficult
information
• The introduction, alongside family held records, of a family support plan
and services such as timely respite and sibling support groups
• The introduction of a keyworker or care coordinator where appropriate
to guide families through the service maze
• Continued access to appropriate services through a convenient access
point throughout childhood and adolescence (for example, mental health
services) and smooth transition to adult services if needed

All children have a right to teaching and therapy
geared towards improving their quality of
life or
potential. Professionals should use outcome measures
to ensure a constant monitoring of the content and
mode of delivery of services. Meaningful evaluation of
intervention for children with autistic spectrum
disorder is complicated by the need for individualised
outcome measures. Any of the outcomes in box 8 may
be considered the successful result of intervention.

Ongoing care

The manifestations of autism change with time and
depending on other developmental
impairments,
personality, and the addition of medical or mental
health problems. As with all developmental and learning
disorders, children with autistic spectrum disorder and
their families are as sensitive to the effects of other risk
factors in family life as any other child and family. Some
evidence shows that the failure to develop communica-
tion skills is a particular risk factor for parental stress.

Box 8: Possible outcomes for measuring the
success of therapeutic and teaching
interventions
• Normal use of verbal language (all pragmatic
language functions met—for example, social use, needs
met)
• Some use of verbal language for a range of purposes
(restricted to some contexts, perhaps prompt
dependent)
• Some functional use of language (for example,
making requests, indicating needs (this may be
spontaneous or prompt dependent))
• Ability to use an alternative or augmentative system
of communication (this may be with or without adult
support)
• Parents, carers, and teachers are better able to
understand the child’s idiosyncratic communication in
order to care for his or her needs effectively—for

What makes autism challenging for services is that
the range and level of function is so variable (although

needs range across every type and place of service pro-
vision available. It is common to meet an adolescent with
measured IQ in the normal range but whose functional
adaptive skills are in the learning disabled range.
Schools attended by children with autism range from
mainstream through to highly specialised 52 week
boarding facilities. Multi-agency, lifelong integrated care
is the challenge. The aim of professionals should be to
meet the changing needs of parents and children at all
ages and stages. See bmj.com for a suggested care
pathway for children with autism and their families.

Clinical review

A parent’s perspective

Public awareness of autism has increased over recent years, yet early
recognition of autism remains variable. As a therapist with several years’
experience in child development, I became concerned during my son’s first
year about his social development and play skills. He never pointed, and
after some language regression (from 30 to six words) occurred at 18
months autism crossed my mind. I discussed this with the health visitor at
his 18 month check. I received reassurances, and his language development
was marked as “satisfactory—single words.” I insisted on a referral for speech
therapy when he was 21⁄2. He was assessed and diagnosed as “a late talker”
by a therapist who, we later discovered, worked with adults. His inability to
settle in nursery prompted me to compile a list of all my concerns. I went to
my general practitioner and pleaded for a referral to the local child
development centre. My son was diagnosed as having an autistic spectrum
disorder at the age of 3 years and 3 months.

Diagnosis is often seen as enabling access to appropriate intervention
and support. In reality it means being added to existing waiting lists for
already overstretched services. My son ceased to be viewed by professionals
as a child and was discussed as a problem to be managed. Our parents
found it hard to accept that “the right help” wouldn’t cure him. I was
deemed “too negative” for pointing out that this is a lifelong condition. We
received a deluge of material about autism and interventions, mainly
downloaded from the internet.

My son’s preschool provision consisted of advice from a teacher-parent

counsellor (one hour a fortnight, term time only), a helper funded for
nursery (three mornings maximum, no training provided), speech therapy
(initial six sessions and periodic follow up), and an invitation to join the
pilot Early Bird course that autumn term. When Early Bird started, my son
had his specialist input withdrawn for the duration of the course (in reality
July-February). We decided to make alternative private provision, funding
an applied behavioural analysis programme costing over £20 000 a year.
We also paid for private speech and language therapy. He now attends an
autism resource base within mainstream education, in an adjacent borough.
Getting the local education authority to agree was a struggle, and there are
ongoing problems.

We have had mixed experiences with the medical profession. We have a
very knowledgeable and supportive local paediatrician. Our local general
practitioners have shown great patience and understanding when treating
my son for minor ailments. He is now a highly verbal and anxious 6 year
old, who insists on examining the doctor before he himself is examined.
However, as a 4 year old he had a fractured tibia and fibula. Neither the
junior emergency staff nor the orthopaedic team knew what autism was.
One doctor wrote “severe learning difficulties” in his notes. Another asked
me what his particular savant skill was, as she had seen Rain Man.

Raising a child with autism is a challenge. We are not searching for a cure,

just the best possible education to help him reach his potential. I have the
professional experience that allows me to understand his difficulties. We are
in a financial position to supplement local provision. In many ways we are
fortunate; other families are not so lucky.
