Abstract
Purpose: COVID-19 has devastated the United States (U.S.). One of the more
notably impacted areas is the South. Compared to the rest of the U.S., the South
is characterized by increased rurality, lowered access to healthcare, older popula-
tions, and higher religiosity, all of which might predispose its residents to more
detrimental effects of COVID-19, including COVID-related fatalities. As such, this
paper provides important considerations for individuals engaging in work with
Southern, rural Americans dealing with COVID-related grief and loss.
Methods: A review of the literature addressing the impact of Southern legislature,
rurality, cross-country factors, and faith on COVID-related grief among Southerners
was conducted, with applicable considerations expressed.
Conclusions: Care should be taken by providers working with rural, Southern
residents to attend to tangible and intangible losses experienced as a result of
COVID-19. These considerations can help inform work with rural Southerners
dealing with grief during the pandemic.

Coronavirus, also distinguished by the moniker COVID-19, has ravaged the
United States over the last year. While the initial U.S. epicenter of the virus
was in the Northeastern United States, a growing area of concern for the spread
of the disease emerged in the South over the late Summer and early Fall months.
Reports from the end of June throughout the months of July and August
showed growing trends of positive COVID-19 cases in the South at troubling
rates (Bendix & Woodward, 2020; Bredemeier, 2020; Laughland, 2020; Stone,
2020). States such as Alabama and Texas were showing staggering increases in
weekly rates of new cases during mid-to-late June (97% rise in weekly cases and
130% rise in biweekly cases, respectively) (Bendix & Woodward, 2020; Stone,
2020). At present, rises in COVID-19 infections and fatalities have been identi-
fied all over the country. While the South is no longer showing infection rates
and deaths at a disproportionately higher rate than other parts of the country,
Southern states such as Texas and Florida continue to be among states with the
highest surges in COVID-19 related deaths, with each state seeing at least 500
deaths in a single week as of the first week of January (New York Times, 2021).
Additionally, Southern states such as Georgia and Mississippi are high on the
list of states struggling with the roll-out of the country’s COVID-19 vaccine
(New York Times, 2021).

The rise and sustained high number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities in the
South, particularly during the late Summer and early Fall, have been attributed
to multiple factors. One is the slower timeline by which many Southern legis-
lators enforced COVID-19 restrictions within the early Fall months. Additional
factors include the premature laxing of restrictions during the late Summer and
early Fall, non-enforcement of mandates on mask wearing, and a lack of social
distancing (Stone, 2020). Ensuing death as a result of COVID-19 is something
that warrants particular consideration in the South. The South, compared to
other parts of the country, has multiple factors that might predispose its resi-
dents to a higher prevalence of COVID-related loss. This consideration also
makes Southern residents more susceptible to grief and negative bereavement-
related outcomes.

The South is characterized by a few factors that distinguish its population
from other areas in the country and highlight potential predispositions

to COVID-related distress. Initially,

400 

OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 88(2)

disproportionately affects older adults. Relative to this, the South has a slightly
older population than other areas of the U.S. Of the states with the highest
populations of adults aged 65 and older in 2018,2 of the top 3 states were located
in the South (Florida and Texas; U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). Moreover,
COVID-19 has been found to have a greater impact in populations with
health disparities. Chronic diseases,
immunocompromising illnesses, and
cancer mortality rates are all higher in the South (Kaiser Family Foundation,
2018a; National Academies of Sciences Engineering Medicine, 2013). Chronic
diseases such as hypertension may be linked to COVID-related hospitalizations,
which is significant considering Southern states comprise the top ten states diag-
nosed with hypertension in terms of population percentages (KFF, 2018a).
Structural factors such as poor access to healthcare in some of the more
“deep South” states have led to disproportionately high rates of infection and
death, particularly among minority populations (Laughland, 2020). Research
attributes several factors to these health disparities, including significant differ-
ences in poverty levels and policies, as well as systemic racism (Kaiser Family
Foundation, 2018b). For example, Southern states comprise nine of the fourteen
states who refuse to expand Medicaid to impoverished residents under the
Affordable Care Act (KFF, 2018b). Another factor that is unique to the
South is increased religiosity. Residents of the South tend to be more religious
than in other parts of the country, with the Southwest and Southeast containing
9 of the 11 most religious states in the nation (Norman, 2018). Many religious
individuals engage in the practice of congregating to express their faith. This
form of congregation also extends to religious celebrations commemorating the
loss of a loved one (BBC, 2009). The tendency to congregate is highly incom-
patible with the safety recommendations for the prevention of the spread of
COVID-19. The incongruence between the desire to congregate among religious
individuals and mandates of distancing could also cause exacerbated rates of
distress among Southern populations. Summarily, an older population, poorer
healthcare outcomes, and higher religious involvement make the South a region
extremely vulnerable to higher COVID-19 infection rates and COVID-related
fatalities. It is with this information that we seek to address considerations for
the impact of COVID-19 on the grieving process, particularly amongst residents
of the South.

In distinguishing the terms relevant to the loss of life, it is important to
differentiate between grief, bereavement, and mourning. Grief has been defined
as disruptions in functioning during the early period following the loss of a
loved one (Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001). Bereavement is a normative stressor
characterized by the death of a loved one (Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001).
Mourning, in its distinction from the prior terms, is the temporary social role
assigned to grief whereas grief becomes publicly recognized and expressed
through action (Charmaz & Milligan, 2006). Succinctly, grief is the internalized
reaction to bereavement, and mourning is the outwardly expressive form of

McDuffie et al. 

401

grieving. The purpose of this review was to address the impacts of COVID-19 in
the South and the resulting implications on grief and bereavement outcomes
within this unique population. For the purposes of the present considerations,
we will address factors related to the processes of grief and mourning on indi-
viduals residing in the South who are likely to be affected by COVID-19.

Methods

The present manuscript is a review of the current literature on COVID-19 and
bereavement in the South. We modeled this review loosely in accordance with
the integrative review guidelines proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005),
positing the necessity of 1) identifying a problem, 2) searching the literature,
3) evaluating the data, 4) analyzing the data, and 5) presenting the results. In our
identification of a problem, we drew on our personal experiences. All of the
authors are clinicians (either trainee-level or licensed) working within a Southern
state. Within our clinical work, a multitude of our clients were struggling with
implications not only of COVID-19, but specifically of handling multiple losses
at a professional and/or personal level.

In conducting a more thorough search of the existing literature surrounding
COVID-19 and its effects, the keyword “COVID-19” was used. Literature
searches were conducted on research databases and Google Scholar to find
articles describing the state of COVID-19 in the South. After finding literature
addressing impactful factors that might exacerbate the role of COVID-19 in the
South, additional literature searches were conducted through databases to find
information concerning trends of rurality, religious faith, and cross-cultural
factors impacted by COVID-19. Articles that were excluded from the initial
keyword search did not address COVID-19 specific to the South.

Data Evaluation

The final sample of papers used within this review included empirical and
opinion-based articles. This was due to the novel nature of COVID-19 and
the constantly shifting literature. Considerations for the present manuscript
were formed through amalgamations of COVID-19 trends in the South with
factors unique to the South that were impacting rates of infection and mortality
from COVID-19. These factors were garnered from the investigative and current
empirical literature from leading scientific organizations (i.e. the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) addressing the spread of COVID-19
in the South. Based on these considerations and the observed problem, recom-
mendations for healthcare workers from physical, mental, and behavioral health
disciplines were deduced. It should be noted that data used in preparation of this
article is provisional and incomplete, which may cause conclusions to change
over time.

Considerations

Southern Response to COVID-19

Although COVID-19 has spread ubiquitously throughout the United States, the
most recent trends show a sustained amount of high case numbers in the Great
Plains and the South relative to other parts of the country (CDC, 2021;
Treisman, 2020). In the early stages of the pandemic, populous states and big
cities were more likely to show higher infection rates. However, during the late
Summer and early Fall months, the New York Times (2020) reported that avail-
able data identified the Southwest as having the most cases per capita. While
there was speculation about travelers from the North being the reason for
increasing COVID-19 rates in the South, an analysis by the Harvard Global
Health Institute (2020) attributed the large outbreaks to states’ decisions to
prematurely relax COVID-19 regulations in May and later allow students to
return to school (or return without adequate procedures in place) in August.

This proved especially concerning for infection rates at Southern colleges,
which comprised six of the top seven states with the most reported campus cases
of COVID-19 during the late Summer and early Fall months (Texas, Georgia,
Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina; New York Times, 2020). Infection
rates and case-fatality among younger and middle-aged adults were found as
being significantly higher among Southern states (Deep South and Mid-South)
as compared to other regions, where people aged 70 and older are most suscep-
tible (Newkirk, 2020). For example, the 40 to 59 age group accounted for 22%
of COVID-19 deaths in Louisiana and 6% of COVID-19 deaths in Washington
by the early Fall (Newkirk, 2020). Additionally, with wide re-openings followed
by subsequent shutdowns and holiday breaks, the likelihood for Southern col-
lege students to travel to other parts of the country to return home had the
capacity to lead to high rates of infection and mortality amongst middle to older
aged family members and those with compromised immune systems.

Impacts of Rurality

A notable percentage of U.S. Southern geography is rural. One in five
Americans live in rural areas. These rural communities represent a considerably
vulnerable population for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk (Peters,
2020). COVID-19 has been associated with age (80% of COVID-19 deaths
were individuals aged 65 years or older), underlying health conditions (90% of
COVID-19 hospitalized patients), and limited access to necessary health care
services (Leroy et al., 2020). Compared to urban counterparts, rural communi-
ties represent a demographic that is predominantly older, with higher rates of
chronic physical (eg, diabetes, heart disease) and mental (eg, substance use,
suicide rates) health conditions, higher rates of disability risk, and limited

McDuffie et al. 

403

access to healthcare services (CDC, 2020a). Additionally, while it is known that
COVID-19 poses a larger risk among those with serious health conditions,
health disparities (eg, obesity, heart disease, and lung disease) and poorer
health outcomes are far more common within the South compared to the rest
of the U.S. (Koma & Neuman, 2020). Furthermore, over the past decade, rural
health systems have faced under-resourcing, resulting in more than 100 hospital
closures. Sixty percent of these closures have occurred in the South (Stabenow &
Manchin, 2020). In the South, minority groups have less access to and spend less
on public health annually (Koma & Neuman, 2020). The circumstances by
which rural residents were lacking in healthcare provisions were already dire;
however, these strains have been further exacerbated by the pandemic.

Death during the COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges that can
disrupt grieving processes. A noted protective factor in the grieving process is
social support. COVID-19 deaths, however, have been described as lonely and
dehumanizing for patients and families (Leroy et al., 2020). Within rural com-
munities, this social separation is magnified by limited access to high-speed
internet
(only 26% of rural Americans have access; Lyne et al., 2020;
Stabenow & Manchin, 2020). It is known that during these times, many
bereaved individuals have looked to internet channels to engage virtually with
their ill loved ones and/or to engage in services for deceased loved ones. With
large parts of the South being rural, it can stand that many of the people
residing in the South are suffering both from a higher susceptibility to
COVID-related loss and less accessibility to practices that ordinarily aided
with their grief. The visible and invisible barriers for rural residents can signif-
icantly interfere with their ability to grieve and effectively cope with their loss.
Focusing on grief in rural regions is essential, as grief-related coping encom-
passes cultural values, beliefs, and practices specific to the individual and their
contextual environment. This is imperative for those providing care to bereaved
Southern residents to be attentive to, particularly during the ramifications from
COVID-19.

Cross-Country Factors

Grieving from a distance is fraught with challenges, but amidst a pandemic,
experiencing the loss of a loved one in another state or part of the country is
additionally difficult. One of the first lines of defense against the spread of
COVID-19 internationally was to restrict and limit travel (Lau et al., 2020).
As cases rose in the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
implemented a number of public health measures including maintaining a
social distance of 6 feet from those not in one’s household, canceling large
gatherings of people and events, and implementing an initial two-week lock-
down where individuals were not to leave their home for non-essential tasks
(CDC, 2020b). Travel to other areas of the country was strongly discouraged,

404 

OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 88(2)

with each state having varying levels of “openness” to visitors. While some
states were open to out-of-state guests, others required a two-week quarantine
upon arrival (CDC, 2020b). Compounding this was the fact that most states
strongly discouraged residents from the South from travel, and this is a trend
that has continued through present. This culmination of factors provides a
notable challenge to Southern residents with family members in other parts of
the country or world who have recently died.

The ever-changing landscape of the pandemic poses the question of the
importance of participation in bereavement services for the wellbeing of the
bereaved individual. Southern residents who experience the loss of a loved
one living elsewhere must balance the desire to be near loved ones during this
time with fears of spreading or contracting COVID-19 or facing quarantines.
A rapid review of the literature by Burrell and Selman (2020) found no conclu-
sive support for improved mental health outcomes relative to the participation
in funeral practices. However, qualitative research supported the benefit of
active engagement in meaningful funeral and after-death practices. Mourners
during the pandemic are required to be more intentional about their participa-
tion in funeral rituals. Particularly for some of those in the South, bereaved
family members may elect not to travel and to instead utilize technology, such as
FaceTime or other video conferencing services to engage in funeral practices
from a distance. However, as noted earlier, this is not a luxury available to all
Southern residents, particularly those residing in more rural areas (Lyne et al.,
2020; Stabenow & Manchin, 2020). The pandemic has impacted every aspect of
life, and for family members grieving from afar, we must be mindful of their
needs and desires to process their loss in a meaningful way.

Religion and Spirituality

Religion and spirituality are an integral part of life in the South. Mississippi and
Alabama are consistently ranked as the two most religious states (Newport,
2017), reflecting the high number of churches per capita and percentage of
residents endorsing religiosity and church attendance. Religion and spirituality
provide a daily and weekly routine, a place of worship, social connection and
community (Lim & Putnam, 2010), a value system, sense of purpose (Koenig,
2015), comfort with uncertainty (Hogg et al., 2010), belief in the afterlife, and
rituals for death and dying. Additionally, religiosity positively impacts health
and well-being (Cohen & Johnson, 2017; Cohen & Koenig, 2003; Koenig, 2012).
However, there are important caveats to consider when addressing COVID-
related grief among Southern populations. While religious faith (e.g., belief in a
loving, protective God, the afterlife, etc.) can cultivate strength and lessen death
anxiety (Flannelly, 2017; Harding, Flannelly, Weaver, & Costa, 2005), it may
also contribute to the spread of COVID-19 (Dein, Loewenthal, Lewis &
Pargament, 2020). Recent research suggests that Christian nationalism and

McDuffie et al. 

405

religiosity may lessen adherence to public health protocols, like wearing a mask
and avoiding large social gatherings (Perry, Whitehead, & Grubbs, 2020). With
the association between religiosity and the South, it is important to consider the
role of one’s religious background when interacting with and providing care to a
Southern resident dealing with loss subsequent to COVID-19. Recognizing the
multifaceted role that religion and spirituality play in adapting to life and loss
during COVID-19 is important for those providing services to individuals resid-
ing in the South during these times.

Recommendations

The following recommendations address the nuances of COVID-19 grief within
Southern, rural communities to mitigate distress, recognize vulnerability, and
promote resiliency during these uncertain times. These recommendations are
directed towards physical, mental, and behavioral healthcare workers.

• Help patients to engage in sensitive, yet direct discussions regarding end-of-life
planning. (These discussions, while sometimes uncomfortable, can help to mit-
igate future distress at the end of life, both for the bereaved individuals and
those concerned about the effects of their loss on their loved ones).

• Validate the emotions of patients, both during the grieving and end-of-life

decision making processes.

• Aid patients in accessing social support networks in a manner sensitive to
COVID-19 restrictions. (This could require consultation with Social Work
staff members or outside resources).

• Suggest to patients the necessity of adapting mourning practices to accom-
modate COVID-19 requirements. (This could include engaging in indirect
socialization and mourning such as writing letters, making art, or participat-
ing in virtual ceremonies/support groups).

Conclusion

COVID-19 has impacted rural and remote areas in significant ways and poses
unique challenges during these times (Kotani & Manabe, 2020). Rural commu-
nities tend to prioritize relationships that can provide valuable support during
grieving and bereavement processes. However, in a time of social distancing and
self-isolation, this social support may look different or be lacking. Grief and
mourning practices look different during COVID-19, particularly for our older,
more religious, and more rural Southern neighbors. Understanding the differ-
ences and unique challenges posed by the pandemic for bereaved individuals is
important for all groups, but especially for the rural areas and areas of the South
with reduced access to mental health support or resources. In a time composed

406 

OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying 88(2)

of a great deal of loss and despair, it is important that we are mindful of the
unique needs of all individuals and continue to develop ways to provide effective
aid and maximally efficacious care.
