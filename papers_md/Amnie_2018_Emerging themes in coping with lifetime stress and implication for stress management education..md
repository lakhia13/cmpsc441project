Abstract
Background: Adults with adverse childhood experiences and exposure to adverse life events experience a diverse array 
of physical, mental, and social health problems across their lifespan. Adult exposure to emotional trauma, physical injury, 
or  other  adverse  life  events  may  result  in  the  development  of  post-traumatic  stress  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder. 
Understanding individuals’ response to stress and their coping strategies is as important as the stimulus or the causes of the 
stress for effective stress management interventions.
Methods: This is a mixed quantitative and qualitative online survey study which explores the coping strategies to stress in 
adults with adverse childhood experiences and exposure to adverse life events through analysis of emerging themes from 
survey questionnaire responses of study participants.
Results:  Participants  who  respond  to  stress  through  adaptive  coping  focused  either  on  problem-solving,  17.6%  (32  out 
of  188),  or  on  emotion-focused  coping,  45.2%  (85  out  of  188).  Participants  engaged  in  problem-solving  mainly  through 
therapy such as counseling and other professional stress management, whereas those who chose emotion-focused coping 
used diverse strategies including practicing mindfulness, meditation, and yoga; using humor and jokes; seeking higher power 
or  religious  pursuits;  engaging  in  physical  or  breathing  exercises;  and  seeking  social  support.  Participants  who  practiced 
maladaptive  coping  styles  constituted  37.2%  (70  out  of  188)  of  respondents  and  resorted  to  avoidance  of  the  stressful 
condition, withdrawal from a stressful environment, disengagement from stressful relationships, and use and abuse of drugs 
and/or alcohol.
Conclusion: An understanding of emerging themes in coping strategies calls for collaborative and multidisciplinary approaches 
in  the  design,  implementation,  and  execution  of  health  education  and  promotion  programs  tailored  to  meet  the  diverse 
needs of priority populations. Stress management educators need to take into account the vulnerabilities of individuals who 
resort to maladaptive coping and institute evidence-based behavioral and social service intervention strategies, including life 
skills training, to prevent the consequences of maladaptive coping and to enhance the self-efficacy of individuals to cope more 
effectively with stress and stressful life events.

Introduction

Adults  with  adverse  childhood  experiences  (ACEs)  and 
exposure to adverse life events experience a diverse array of 
physical,  mental,  and  social  health  problems  across  their 
lifespan.  Some  of  the  most  common  health  risks  include 
physical and mental illness, substance use disorder, and high 
level of engagement in risky sexual behavior.1–3

A prior research1 identifies 10 categories of ACEs, includ-
ing sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and phys-
ical neglect, as well as emotional neglect and parental loss or 
parental separation before the child’s age of 18 years. ACEs 
involving  maladaptive  family  functioning  (parental  mental 
illness, substance use disorder, criminality, family violence, 
physical  and  sexual  abuse,  and  neglect)  are  significantly 
associated  with  persistence  of  mood,  substance  abuse,  and 
anxiety disorders.4 Childhood adverse experiences are also 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  the  development  of 
malignancy,  cardiovascular  disease,  metabolic  syndrome, 
and other chronic debilitating conditions.5–12

Research13 has established that early life stress is a predic-
tor of smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug dependence. 
There is an increased risk of developing an antisocial behavior 
in  adults  with ACEs.14 ACEs  are  also  associated  with  poor 
self-rated  health,  functional  limitations,  diabetes,  and  heart 
attack.15 Other adverse health outcomes in later life associated 
with  ACEs  include  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD), 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  substance  use  disor-
ders, eating disorders, depression and attempted suicide, and 
high-risk sexual behavior.16 ACEs may negatively shape neu-
rocognitive development and contribute to the development of 
antisocial behavior and delinquent activities.17 Accumulation 
of  early  trauma  may  increase  the  persistence  of  antisocial 
behavior, resulting in a variety of criminal behaviors and arrest 
outcomes.18 Children exposed to intimate partner violence in 
the  family  are  prone  to  negative  social  and  health  conse-
quences,  including  anxiety,  depression,  poor  school  perfor-
mance, and other negative health outcomes.19

Children who experienced parental divorce are twice as 
likely to develop depression compared to those whose par-
ents’ marriages remained intact during their childhood, the 
risk  being  even  more  significant  when  accompanied  by  a 
high  level  of  parental  conflict.20  Children  who  grew  up 
exposed  to  adversity  have  higher  incidence  of  relationship 
problems, including smaller social network size and higher 
negative  aspects  of  close  relationships.21  The  impact  of 
exposure  to  trauma  is  not  limited  to  childhood  years. 
Adolescents  who  experienced  any  adversity  that  threatens 
their sense of safety and security may continue to live with 
emotional trauma.22 Exposure to trauma in adolescent devel-
opment could negatively affect identity formation, produc-
ing a foreshortened sense of the future, poor self-cohesion, 
and  peer  relationships,  as  well  as  causing  a  regression  in 
adult executive functioning.23

The health consequences of ACEs and adverse life events 
depend  on  the  individuals’  coping  styles  and  resilience  to 
real or perceived stress. The term coping in this context is 
understood  to  mean  the  cognitive  and  behavioral  efforts 
made  to  master,  tolerate,  or  reduce  external  and  internal 
demands and conflicts, with two types of coping actions dis-
tinguished by their focus on different elements of a stressful 
encounter:  problem-focused  coping—an  attempt  to  change 

the  person-environment  realities  behind  negative  emotions 
or  stress—and  emotion-focused  coping—an  attempt  to 
reduce a negative emotional state or change the appraisal of 
the demanding situation.24,25

Exposure to adversity during adulthood is also associated 
with  stress,  and  adults  who  experience  significant  stress 
adopt different coping strategies. Adaptation to trauma con-
sists of dynamic coping processes involving both the man-
agement  of  the  original  traumatic  experience  and  the 
challenge of post-traumatic recovery.26 Coping self-efficacy 
within a traumatic stress context refers to the perceived capa-
bility  of  managing  the  internal  and  external  post-traumatic 
recovery demands. Positive self-efficacy is central to effec-
tive adaptation because it provides a sense of control facili-
tating adaptive coping.27 In one study,28 coping self-efficacy 
predicted post-trauma recovery for survivors of a myriad of 
traumatic  experiences,  including  childhood  sexual  abuse, 
combat,  domestic  violence,  motor  vehicle  accidents,  hurri-
canes, and terrorist attacks.

Coping strategies could be categorized into adaptive and 
maladaptive types. Adaptive coping responses may include 
active  coping  responses  such  as  primary  control,  problem-
solving,  secondary  control,  and  restructuring,  as  well  as 
empathy  and  respect  for  diversity  in  multicultural  popula-
tions which are associated with positive health outcomes. On 
the  contrary,  maladaptive  coping  responses  include  coping 
responses  such  as  social  withdrawal,  surrender,  denial  or 
aggression, hostility, discrimination, and oppression directed 
to diversity in multicultural populations which may be asso-
ciated with negative health outcomes.29

An important consideration in understanding response to 
trauma is that both post-traumatic growth and PTSD could 
be possible consequences of trauma.25 Post-traumatic growth 
refers to a change in people’s ability to resist highly stressful 
circumstances and going beyond pre-trauma levels of adap-
tation and is presumed to emerge from cognitive processes 
and  can  have  functional  and  dysfunctional  aspects.  Post-
traumatic growth has also been defined as positive psycho-
logical change experienced as a result of adversity and other 
challenges in order to rise to a higher level of functioning.27 
However, those with highest coping ability will report rela-
tively little growth because these people have coping strate-
gies that allow them to be less challenged by trauma.25 Child 
and  adolescent  experiences  associated  with  post-traumatic 
growth  include  more  compassion  and  empathy  for  others 
after  personal  trauma  or  loss;  increased  psychological  and 
emotional  maturity  when  compared  to  age-related  peers;  a 
deeper understanding of one’s personal values, purpose, and 
meaning  in  life;  and  a  greater  value  of  interpersonal  rela-
tions.27 Post-traumatic growth is not viewed as the end result 
of  successful  coping,  but  as  a  coping  process,  a  defense 
against pathogenic consequences of trauma, with no demon-
strable adaptive value in reducing distress and no facilitation 
of reduction in depression and anxiety levels.28

Objectives

1.  To investigate ACEs, exposure to trauma, and other 

adverse life events in adults;

2.  To identify emerging themes on coping strategies to 
stress  exposure  adapted  by  adults  with  or  without 
ACE and other adverse life events.

Method

Study design, study population, and sampling 
method

A web-based platform was used to create the survey for an 
online data collection with the goal of obtaining a conveni-
ence  sample  size  of  200–300  adult  US  residents  for  this 
study.  The  survey  portal  was  made  available  to  potential 
participants through a link distributed through chain emails, 
various listservs of several institutions of higher education, 
and  common  social  media  platforms. At  the  close  of  data 
collection, there were 565 study participants. After eliminat-
ing  75  ineligible/incomplete  and  257  duplicate  responses, 
the final study sample was a convenience sample of N = 233 
study participants (47.55% or 233 of 490). Data collection 
for  the  study  was  started  and  completed  in  the  Spring  of 
2016.

Research instruments, data collection, and 
analysis

including 

The quantitative survey for this study used a diverse array of 
questionnaires, 
Survey 
Questionnaire  (DQ-10),  the  Adverse  Childhood  Experience 
Questionnaire (ACE-10), Adult Stress/Trauma Questionnaire-10 
(ATQ-10), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian 
Version (PCL-S-17).

the  Demographic 

The DQ-10 is a standard demographic questionnaire used 
in  prior  research.30  The  DQ-10  permits  obtaining  essential 
demographic information. The ACE-10 is a tool which has 
been  used  in  the Adverse  Childhood  Experiences  Study.31 
Regarding scoring of the ACE-10, when the points are added 
up for the total of 10 questions, the ACE score is determined. 
An ACE score of 0 would mean that the person reported no 
exposure  to  any  of  the  categories  of  adverse  experiences, 
while  an  ACE  score  of  10  would  mean  that  the  person 
reported  exposure  to  all  10  of  the  categories  of  adverse 
events  within  the  10-item  survey.32  Adult’s  retrospective 
responses with regard to ACE remain generally stable over 
time—with  the  ACE-10  showing  good  to  excellent  test–
retest  reliability  and  internal  consistency  in  research  stud-
ies.33 The BTQ-10 tool seeks to assess adult stress exposure, 
including  adverse  life  events  and  psychological  trauma. 
Participants who endorsed at least one item on the 10-item 
Self-Report  Questionnaire  on  the  BTQ  are  placed  in  the 
trauma-exposed group.34 The PCL-S-17 is a tool which per-
mits  identification  of  symptoms  of  PTSD  experienced  by 

3

subjects  in  the  previous  30 days  of  completing  the  survey, 
including providing a total severity score by adding responses 
to the questionnaire items.35 The psychometric properties of 
the  PTSD  Checklist-Civilian  Version  (i.e.  internal  consist-
ency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and discrimi-
nant validity) are well established; scores are added up for all 
the  items  for  a  total  severity  score  and  have  been  used  to 
diagnose PTSD among treatment-seeking trauma survivors. 
A total score of 44 is the cut-off score for PTSD positive for 
the general population, while a total score of 50 is considered 
to be PTSD positive in military populations.36

The study participants were also asked the following two 
qualitative  survey  questions  through  the  web-based  online 
platform:

1.  When  you  experienced  any  trauma  or  adverse  life 
event, how did you manage to cope with your stress? 
Please share your style of surviving, bouncing back, 
regaining a sense of control, healing, and positively 
transforming  in  the  aftermath  of  any  experience  of 
trauma across the lifespan.

2.  After  you  experienced  any  trauma  or  adverse  life 
event, did any of your stressful or traumatic experi-
ences lead you to become a better person or a stronger 
self?

Data analysis and presentation

Data analysis was accomplished using SPSS version 9.3 for 
the quantitative part and selective coding was used to organ-
ize  qualitative  data  into  similar  themes.  First,  open  coding 
was used to create tentative labels for themes of participant 
narratives  that  summarize  our  observation  of  participants’ 
experiences in words or phrases, followed by identification 
of major emerging themes and then rereading the transcripts 
and  selectively  coding  any  data  that  relate  to  the  major 
emerging  themes  identified.  We  used  selected  participant 
quotes to illustrate participant stories in each thematic desig-
nation of participant coping strategies to stress.

Ethical considerations

The study received approval from the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) of Teachers College Columbia University in the 
City of New York. The use of a chance to win a small incen-
tive  and  the  amount  of  the  incentive  for  each  of  the  three 
winners were also reviewed and approved by this IRB before 
the start of the study.

Before participants could gain access to the survey, they 
first  accessed  the  study  informed  consent  and  participants’ 
rights  forms  and  provided  an  electronic  signature  for  both 
forms. Potential subjects who provided an electronic signa-
ture proceeded next to the survey screening. After completing 
the survey, each participant was requested to share the survey 
link to as many numbers of potential participants as possible 
in  their  networks.  Strict  confidentiality  and  anonymity  of

Results

Quantitative analysis

The sample (N = 233) had 89.3% (n = 208) born in the United 
States, 84.1% (n = 196) female, 74.2% (n = 174) White, 16.7 % 
(n = 39) African American, 9.4% (n = 22) Hispanic, and 6.0% 
(n = 14) Asian/Asian Americans, with a mean age of 36.27 years 
(min = 18, max = 77, standard deviation (SD) = 14.08).

Approximately 79.0% (n = 184) of adults reported expo-
sure to one or more ACEs. The two most common were emo-
tional abuse (43.3%, n = 101) and emotional neglect (42.9%, 
n = 100). Some 37.6% (n = 88) of the sample reported expo-
sure to four or more adverse experiences, and 21% (n = 49) 
did not have any ACEs. The results of descriptive analysis on 
ACEs are displayed in Table 1.

Approximately 64.4% (n = 150) of the sample had expo-
sure to at least one trauma. Unwanted sexual contact was the 
most frequently experienced form of trauma accounting for 
almost  half  (48.5%,  n = 113)  of  respondents,  while  20.7% 
(n = 47) thought their life was in danger. The next most fre-
quently  experienced  form  of  trauma  accounting  for  34.3% 
(n = 80)  was  being  physically  beaten  by  parent/caretaker/
teacher.  Approximately  32.2%  (n = 75)  reported  they  were 
attacked by friends and/or strangers. The results of descrip-
tive  analysis  of  adult  exposure  to  trauma  are  displayed  in 
Table 2.

Approximately 38.2% (n = 89) of participants met criteria 
for PTSD; the sample had a mean score of 40.46 (min = 17, 
max = 82, SD = 15.215) from a total possible scores range of 
17–85.

Qualitative analysis

A total of 188 participants out of 233 (80.7%) responded to 
the  first  qualitative  survey  question  requesting  participants 
to share anything that comes to mind about what they have 
learned across their lifetime about trauma and stress across 
their  lifespan  and  strategies  for  surviving,  bouncing  back, 
regaining  a  sense  of  control,  healing,  and  positively  trans-
forming—developing  positive  coping—in  the  aftermath  of 
any experience of trauma or adverse life events. The content 
of  the  quotes  submitted  by  participants  revealed  a  diverse 
range of emergent themes, indicating both adaptive and mal-
adaptive coping strategies. Participants who have developed 
adaptive  coping  focused  either  on  problem-solving  coping 
styles, 17.6% (32 out of 188) or on emotion-focused coping, 
45.2% (85 out of 188). Participants who practiced adaptive 
coping  utilized  problem-solving  mainly  through  seeking 
treatment, whereas participants who chose emotion-focused 
coping used diverse strategies including practicing mindful-
ness, meditation, and yoga; using humor and jokes; identify-
ing  with  a  higher  power  or  religious  pursuits;  engaging  in 
physical or breathing exercises; and seeking social support. 
Participants who practiced maladaptive coping styles consti-
tuted 37.2% (70 out of 188) of respondents and resorted to 
avoidance  of  the  stressful  condition,  withdrawal  from  a 
stressful  environment,  disengagement  from  stressful  rela-
tionships, and use and abuse of drugs and/or alcohol.

Adaptive coping styles through problem-solving

Those  who  employ  problem-solving  coping  often  sought 
diverse types of therapies/treatments and shared their experi-
ences in the following lines:

I  went  through  EMDR  [Eye  Movement  Desensitization 
Reprocessing] therapy and regained a life.

Dialectical and Cognitive Behavioral therapy has helped me to 
cope  with  negative  emotions.  It  helps  to  remember  that  our

thoughts  are  just  guesses  and  are  often  a  result  of  cognitive 
distortions.  Identifying  cognitive  distortions  is  helpful  to  curb 
self-destructive behaviors.

other  person  isn’t  thinking  about  all  the  hurt  they  did  to  me, 
they  have  moved  on  to  hurting  someone  else.  I  have  learned 
that it is not only okay, but critical at times to say no and set 
boundaries. I can only handle so much and so I have to limit 
what I can add to my to-do list.
I have definitely learned to pay more attention to my feelings 
and recognizing my triggers. for example, if I watch a movie 
and the violence causes me to experience anxiety or an attack. 
I  avoid that movie for  quite  some  time and if I  ever watch it 
again I try to mentally prepare myself for what I will be seeing. 
I also started keeping a dream journal and paying attention to 
recurring dreams so that I can better understand maybe some 
underlying issues I am coping with. most recently I have started 
seeing a therapist once a week to talk through my feelings and 
past experiences.

Others practiced mindfulness, meditation, and/or yoga:

Prayer, meditation, and mindfulness help me, particularly when I 
practice  them  regularly.  Sometimes  breath  meditation  work  can 
allow for too much open space for difficult thoughts and feelings 
and  I  need  something  that  involves  my  attention  with  a  more 
tangible object. I also find that acknowledging reluctance and then 
going ahead anyway (after acknowledging the feeling) is helpful.

To not let others be responsible for my happiness, to breathe, to 
meditate, to do yoga. To recognize impermanence, the laws of 
nature.

Some used humor/jokes to cope with their stress:

My  usual  coping  mechanisms  are  humor  and  sublimating 
negative feelings to increase drive at school and work. As I’ve 
gotten older, I’ve also gotten better at practicing acceptance.

… I feel like a broken toy that was put back together, that kind 
of works, but pieces are missing. So, I would say that repression 
and avoidance can be a positive way moving forward, because 
at  least  I  am  not  suicidal  anymore,  but  there  is  a  price. Also, 
having a sense of humor helps, though people don’t always like 
to hear the kind of humor an abuse survivor utilizes.

Some sought higher power/religion/spirituality:

Adaptive coping styles through emotion-focused 
coping

Those  who  adapted  emotional  coping  also  used  diverse 
styles of coping.

… In more basic terms, instead of letting them simply be traumatic 
memories, I have worked to position them as experiences with a 
reason behind them and that serve as motivational forces. Finally, 
I feel that my faith in God has also served to help guide me in the 
direction of finding reason or purpose behind these experiences.

Some learned to manage their stress:

I have learned that I cannot control everything and as difficult 
as that is at times, it also allowed me to free up some space in 
my own mind to accept that I needn’t try to be in control all the 
time. Other people are responsible for their behavior, not me. 
I’ve also learned that forgiveness and letting go of anger and 
resentment  is  for  my  well-being,  not  for  the  transgressor. 
Holding on to anger and resentment only hurts me because the 

Most  importantly  I  have  learned  that  God  is  present  and  in 
control.  I  need  to  listen  for  his  direction.  I  need  to  remain 
focused and don’t “awfulize” as before.

Some relied on physical exercise and/or social support:

… I put my relationships ahead of everything and while that’s 
probably kept me from making career advances as fast as I like, 
I know that without the emotional/social support I wouldn’t be

able  to  make  any  at  all.  Journaling  to  reflect  on  the  positive 
things in my life has often been helpful.”

Post-traumatic growth from adverse experiences

A sample of participants’ statements is provided below:

Distraction,  meditation,  exercise,  therapy,  calling  help  lines, 
medication (from a psychiatrist), warm bath, hugging, reading.

Maladaptive coping styles using alcohol and/or 
drugs

Some resorted to using alcohol and/or drugs:

… unfortunately, I sometimes drink alcohol!

What l learned from life really was from the past 10 years. I had 
always been afraid and played victim and blamed other people 
for experiences l put myself thru without accepting responsibility. 
I am now in a 12-step program and living the life l was meant to 
live. I take care of myself and do not let others take advantage of 
me.  I  practice  Reiki  and  meditate.  I  stay  away  from  toxic  or 
negative environments.

Maladaptive coping styles of problem avoidance/
withdrawal/disengagement

Some  of  the  statements  from  such  participants  are  pro-
vided below:

Not to blame myself for how I was sexualized and abused as a 
child and to call what happened to me later as an adult what it 
is—rape. I function better when I am not blaming myself for 
what happened or in denial of what happened. It also makes me 
feel  better  to  acknowledge  that  these  things  happened  with 
people  I  trust,  professionals  and  certain  friends,  and  then  see 
that the world doesn’t open up and swallow me up, but that I’m 
still ok.

Realizing that as an adult I now have control over who I associate 
with, what I will allow them to do/say to me, and can simply 
walk away when a situation no longer suits me. Survival takes 
suave and determination to never let your circumstances define 
who you are. I can honestly say I used the traits of my abuser to 
know what to avoid in my own relationships and to learn more 
effective  conflict  resolution  skills  than  those  which  were 
demonstrated to me as a child.

For the second open-ended question asking participants 
to  share  whether  they  think  any  of  their  stressful  or  trau-
matic  experiences  led  them  to  experiencing  growth—as  a 
concept  known  as  post-traumatic  growth—185  (79.4%) 
study participants responded. The content of the quotes sub-
mitted by participants revealed two major emerging themes. 
Many  participants  stated  that  the  adverse  life  event  has 
transformed their lives for the better in diverse ways, 67.0% 
(124/185),  whereas  33.0%  (61  out  of  185  respondents) 
denied, did not know, or were not sure about any post-trau-
matic growth experience.

… I always was independent, but as a child, I lacked the power 
to enforce my own boundaries and had to temper that new power 
lest I become the person I despised. I had to consciously learn to 
approach  my  marriage  with  a  sense  of  cooperation,  empathy, 
and rationality when we disagreed rather than being a verbal and 
physical  bully  as  my  abuser  was.  In  the  end,  it  made  me  a 
calmer,  more  understanding  person  because  I  was  determined 
not to repeat the pattern.

I  believe  I  have  experienced  posttraumatic  growth  to  a  slight 
extent. I think my experiences have made me more understanding 
to other issues currently going on in the world. I believe that my 
experiences  have  made  me  better  able  to  help  out  those  who 
have  been  in  similar  situations,  which  benefits  me  greatly 
because I’d like to one day work as a psychiatrist.

No post-traumatic growth from adverse 
experiences

Many others stated that the adverse life event did not make 
their lives better or they were not sure:

I do not feel this way at all. I don’t feel like I’ve gained anything 
because  of  these  experiences—I  just  wish  they  had  never 
happened.

I am not sure. I feel that it stunted me, depleting self-esteem that 
would have been helpful to me, more than it helped me to grow.

Discussion

The results of our analysis indicate that ACEs are a common 
adversity  for  many  adults,  with  79.0%  (n = 184)  reporting 
exposure  to  one  or  more ACEs. A  number  of  respondents 
recalled  vivid  memories  of  childhood  trauma,  including 
physical,  sexual  abuse,  and  emotional  neglect  consistent 
with  the  lifelong  effects  of  early  childhood  adversity  and 
toxic stress described elsewhere.1,37

The prevalence of adult exposure to at least one trauma in 
this study was 64.4 % compared to a similar study,38 where the 
prevalence of exposure to at least one trauma is 70% for adults 
in the United States. The findings from this study were consist-
ent with another study39 which reported a prevalence for trau-
matic experiences ranging from 51% to 74%. Similar findings 
were reported by a study40 assessing the prevalence of civilian 
trauma in women where lifetime exposure to any type of trau-
matic event was 69%. Prior research41 found that only a small 
subset  of  trauma  victims  developed  PTSD  (<10%),  while 
female victims of traumatic events were at higher risk of PTSD 
than male victims. Another study42 estimated a PTSD preva-
lence among veterans at 23%, whereas lifetime prevalence of 
PTSD in the US population was estimated at 10%.43

In this study with a mostly female civilian sample, 38.2% 
(n = 89) met screening criteria for PTSD. The mean of 40.46 
PTSD  symptom  severity  score 
(min = 17,  max = 82, 
SD = 15.215) was slightly lower than the diagnostic cut-off 
score of 44 for PTSD in the general population.

The 38.2% PTSD prevalence in this study is higher than 
the prior 8% or 10% prevalence estimates for Americans, as 
well as higher than the 23% for veterans. Our study attracted 
a  disproportionately  large  proportion  of  women  (84.1%) 
with an interest in stress and trauma, including from personal 
exposure  to  adverse  life  events.  In  one  study,  maladaptive 
personality traits were found to be associated with maladap-
tive coping styles and higher levels of distress, and the same 
study also posits that maladaptive coping may mediate the 
relationship between asocial and anxious/dramatic personal-
ity  and  psychological  distress.44  In  this  study,  participants 
who  had  a  concurrent  mental  illness  such  as  depression, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or PTSD often sought 
treatment  and/or  counseling,  an  adaptive  coping  strategy 
focused on problem-solving. The results of this study reveal 
a great deal about the coping styles adapted by adults with 
ACEs and adult exposure to trauma and stress. Many of the 
expressions indicate that adults with ACEs continue to strug-
gle, trying to find a solution or a coping strategy that would 
work  best  for  their  stress  resulting  from  adult  trauma  or 
childhood adversity ranging from seeking treatment/therapy 
to resorting to friends and family or even a higher power for 
support.  Some  find  solace  in  exercise,  yoga,  or  meditation 
which may be combined with some form of therapy from the 
helping professions, while other participants resort to drugs 
or alcohol. A significant number of participants shared their 
experience of post-traumatic growth and expressed that they 
could emerge stronger, more mature, and more relatable in 
their interactions with people at home and workplace.

Limitations

Statistical power analysis was not used to determine the sam-
ple size as the sampling was based on a convenience sample 
which may suffer from selection bias. The study also used 
self-reported data, with a high possibility of participants pro-
viding socially desirable responses. Moreover, potential par-
ticipants  who  did  not  have  online  access  may  have  been 
excluded from the study, whereas those who wanted to vol-
unteer might have been overrepresented. Another limitation 
is  the  way  the  questions  were  framed  to  ellicit  responses 
from participants in a way that presupposes participants to 
have  experienced  adverse  life  events  which  may  result  in 
higher rates of social desirability bias.

could  reveal  their  feelings  of  deep  and  hurting  emotional 
wounds on the online survey that they may not have dared to 
do  on  face-to-face  interviews.  Health  education  and  health 
promotion programs need to have a clear strategic plan span-
ning  the  lifetime  of  individuals  and  families,  specifically 
focusing  on  the  primary  prevention  of  ACEs  of  physical, 
emotional, and sexual abuse; intimate partner violence; and 
harassment in the workplace, which are a tremendous source 
of significant stress.

An understanding of emerging themes in coping strate-
gies calls for collaborative and multidisciplinary approaches 
to  meet  the  diverse  needs  of  priority  populations.  Stress 
management educators need to take into account the vulner-
abilities and therapeutic choices of individuals who resort to 
maladaptive coping and institute evidence-based behavioral 
and  social  service  intervention  strategies,  including  life 
skills training, to prevent the consequences of maladaptive 
coping  and  to  enhance  the  self-efficacy  of  individuals  to 
cope more effectively with stress and stressful life events. 
The  importance  of  the  continued  search  for  the  design  of 
novel  health  education  approaches  and  strategies  for  the 
prevention of ACEs and adverse adult life events and their 
consequences on physical, mental, and social ill-health can-
not be overemphasized.
