Aneuploidy, an irregular number of chromosomes in cells, is a hallmark fea-
ture of cancer. Aneuploidy results from chromosomal instability (CIN) and
occurs in almost 90% of all tumours. While many cancers display an ongoing
CIN phenotype, cells can also be aneuploid without displaying CIN. CIN
drives tumour evolution as ongoing chromosomal missegregation will
yield a progeny of cells with variable aneuploid karyotypes. The resulting
aneuploidy is initially toxic to cells because it leads to proteotoxic and meta-
bolic stress, cell cycle arrest, cell death, immune cell activation and further
genomic instability. In order to overcome these aneuploidy-imposed stresses
and adopt a malignant fate, aneuploid cancer cells must develop aneu-
ploidy-tolerating mechanisms to cope with CIN. Aneuploidy-coping
mechanisms can thus be considered as promising therapeutic targets.
However, before such therapies can make it into the clinic, we first need
to better understand the molecular mechanisms that are activated upon
aneuploidization and the coping mechanisms that are selected for in aneu-
ploid cancer cells. In this review, we discuss the key biological responses
to aneuploidization, some of the recently uncovered aneuploidy-coping
mechanisms and some strategies to exploit these in cancer therapy.

1. Introduction
Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes in cells, affects the majority
of cancers, ranging from 26% in thyroid carcinoma to 99% of the glioblastomas
and testicular germ cell tumours [1,2]. Aneuploidy is caused by defects in the
process of chromosome segregation, collectively referred to as chromosomal
instability (CIN) [3]. However, cells can also be aneuploid without exhibiting
CIN, for which the most well-known example is Down syndrome, in which
cells carry an extra copy of chromosome 21 without a CIN phenotype [4].
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) acts as a safeguard against CIN by
delaying anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly aligned and
attached on the metaphase plate [5]. Indeed, defects in SAC genes such as
Mad1, Mad2, BUB3 and BUBR1 lead to CIN and aneuploidy [6–9]. Also other
non-SAC genes have been implicated with CIN phenotypes, including CENP-
E [10], SPAG5 [11], Knl1 [12] and many others.

Despite being a hallmark feature of cancer cells, aneuploidy will initially
cause growth defects to untransformed cells [13–16]. The fact that aneuploidy
is initially toxic to cells but yet frequently occurring in cancer is referred to as
the aneuploidy paradox and suggests that aneuploid cells must develop aneu-
ploidy-tolerating mechanisms to cope with CIN and adopt a malignant fate
[25]. When sustained, CIN will yield a progeny of cells with variable aneuploid
karyotypes that drive tumour evolution and that can help cells to adapt to the
initial growth defects imposed by aneuploidy and challenges of the tumour
microenvironment. While further work is still required to better understand
the interaction between aneuploid cells and the tumour microenvironment
[17–20], karyotype evolution provides an important explanation for why CIN

tumour relapse,

In this review, we aim to give an overview of the initial
stresses that aneuploidy imposes on cells, some of the mech-
anisms that can lead to aneuploidy tolerance and how these
mechanisms can potentially be exploited in aneuploid
cancer therapy.

2. The paradox of aneuploidy in

tumorigenesis

Several recent studies have demonstrated a clear relation
between aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. For instance, specific
trisomies induced in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were
shown to yield increased neoplastic potential [26], and a
study in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
demonstrated that single chromosome losses in tetraploid
MEFs led to increased CIN, DNA damage and tumour
formation when these cells were transplanted into immuno-
compromised mice [27]. Aneuploidy is also correlated with
enhanced adaptability and malignant
transformation of
human cells. For example, while aneuploidy suppresses pro-
liferation of human aneuploid DLD1 cells under standard
culture conditions, aneuploid DLD1 cells outcompeted their
euploid counterparts when placed under less favourable
conditions, such as serum depletion, or when cultured in
the presence of genotoxic
[20]. Similarly,
aneuploid clones within human colorectal cancer cultures
show a selective advantage and an increase in tumorigenic
behaviour under stress conditions [20].

compounds

It has also been suggested that aneuploidy in a triploid or
tetraploid cell can lead to further chromosomal instability,
thereby promoting tumour evolution and tumorigenesis
[30,31]. This process might well directly start after tetraploidi-
zation as the molecular machinery of tetraploid cells already
displays molecular signatures that prepare cells for CIN toler-
ance. Further work is required to unveil
the molecular
adaptions that tetraploid cells and their aneuploid descen-
dants undergo on their way to become a cancer cell [32].
Indeed, several studies have shown that the induction of
CIN can lead to the development of cancer. For instance, the
loss of the mitotic checkpoint components Mad1 and Mad2
predisposes mice to chromosomal instability and the develop-
ment of spontaneous tumours, although tumours are sporadic
and occur with long latencies [6,7]. Similarly, the overexpres-
sion of the kinetochore protein Hec1 leads to hyperactivation
of the mitotic checkpoint, thereby causing CIN and tumori-
genesis
[33]. Accordingly, mosaic variegated
aneuploidy syndrome (MVA) patients, who have mutations
in the centrosomic protein CEP57 or in the SAC protein
BUBR1, are highly susceptible to childhood cancers, further
underscoring that ongoing CIN predisposes
to cancer
[34,35]. Moreover, CIN is associated with drug resistance,
most likely by expediting the generation of new karyotypes
that promote tumour cell evolution [36]. For example, it has
been shown that colorectal cancers cells that exhibit a CIN
phenotype display intrinsic multidrug resistance compared
to chromosome stable cell lines [37]. Also in multiple myel-
oma, CIN has been shown to drive tumour heterogeneity
and to underlie acquired drug resistance [38,39]. Finally, CIN
can promote tumour relapse. For instance, the induction of
CIN by overexpression of Mad2 greatly promotes tumour

metabolic pathways and protein folding distress
Induced aneuploidy in MEFs [15,16] and human cells [41]
was also shown to negatively impact proliferation and metab-
olism and to induce stress responses. Similarly, tumour-
suppressive effects have been observed in a CIN setting.
For example, reduced expression of the centromere protein
CENP-E leads to CIN and aneuploidy in vitro and in vivo
and while this mildly predisposes mice to haematopoietic
and lung malignancies, CENP-E heterozygous mice are
more resistant to chemically and genetically induced tumours
suggesting that CIN can also act tumour suppressive [13].
The latter is possibly explained by the fact that the chemical
insults and genetic predisposition tested ( p19ARF loss) further
increase the CIN rate, thus elevating CIN to levels too toxic
for cells [42]. Similarly, the reduction of in vivo BubR1 protein
levels enhances the risk for colon cancer but decreases the
chance of tumours in the small intestine [43]. Thus, CIN
can promote tumorigenesis and restrain tumours, which
might depend on the (epi)-genetic context such as the cell
type in which the CIN occurs in, but also on CIN rates. For
instance, CIN will lead to a reshuffling of oncogenes and
tumour suppressor genes and can thereby contribute to
cancer genome evolution. However, when provoked in
mouse models, CIN has shown variable potency to cause
tumorigenesis [44], which might stem from the difference in
CIN rates in these mouse models [42], the gene mutations
driving the CIN phenotype and the tumour types they
develop. Indeed, recent findings are suggesting that CIN
rates hold prognostic value for the clinic for several cancers.
For example, patients that suffer from ER-negative breast
cancer with extremely high CIN rates have a better prognosis
than patients with intermediate CIN rates [23]. A similar
relationship was found for ovarian cancer, non-small-cell
lung cancer and gastric cancer [23]. Accordingly, cancers dis-
playing intermediate copy number variations are associated
with the worst overall survival
in a pan-cancer analysis
[36]. These findings imply that drug-imposed increase of
CIN rates could offer a powerful means to treat aneuploid
increasing CIN
tumours with intermediate CIN rates,
beyond the critical point of ‘tolerable’ genomic instability.

However, measuring CIN rates in primary tumours is not
trivial [45]. Single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) is
an increasingly popular method to determine intratumour
karyotype heterogeneity as an estimate for the CIN rates in
a tumour [45]. As such, scWGS hast become a powerful
tool to estimate CIN rates in primary tumours aiding to
better understand the correlation between CIN levels and
clinical prognosis [46], which ultimately might
improve
therapy stratification.

As discussed above, aneuploidy and CIN decrease the cellu-
lar fitness of untransformed cells but are also associated with

Figure 1. Mechanisms of CIN-imposed cell death. CIN and aneuploidy can trigger apoptosis and therefore, blocking apoptosis serves as an important aneuploidy-
tolerating mechanism. Aneuploid cancer cells alter various pathways to overcome CIN-imposed apoptosis, summarized here. Aneuploidy can cause DNA damage,
activating DNA damage-induced ATM kinase, following p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Alternatively, histone H3.3 Ser31 phosphorylation can activate
p53 to provoke apoptosis and suppress the proliferation of aneuploid cells. Aneuploidy can also lead to the activation of Caspase-2 when BCL9L is present, which
causes cleavage of MDM2 and BID, subsequently leading to p53-dependent and -independent apoptosis. Additionally, aneuploidy can activate p38, resulting in p53-
dependent apoptosis, while p38 deficiency upregulates Hif-1α to suppress apoptosis. Finally, aneuploidy-induced ROS can induce proliferation or apoptosis through
JNK signalling.

existence of

increased proliferative potential of cancer cells. This suggests
that cancer cells can adjust to the aneuploid state through
specific survival mechanisms, typically referred to as aneu-
ploidy tolerance mechanisms. The
such
mechanisms is further supported by in vivo studies. For
instance, the loss of Mad2 is tolerated by epidermal cells in
mouse skin, but hair follicle stem cells are eliminated as a
result of apoptotic cell death, which suggests that epidermal
basal cells have an aneuploidy-tolerating mechanism in place,
while hair follicle stem cells do not [47]. Furthermore, aneu-
ploid cells have been found within a variety of somatic cell
types while aneuploidy appears to be less common in stem
cells, further suggesting that stem cells have dedicated mechan-
isms such as special checkpoints to circumvent the propagation
of aneuploid cells [48].

One of the most-studied candidate genes to support
aneuploidy tolerance is p53 (figure 1). Many studies have
found that the p53 pathway favours cells with a diploid
karyotype by triggering apoptosis or cell cycle arrest in
aneuploid cells [49,50]. Indeed, p53 mutations are frequently
observed in highly aneuploid cancers including endometrial,
colorectal and gastric cancers. Furthermore, p53-mutant
tumours display more complex and unstable karyotypes
than p53 wild-type tumours [51,52]. The aneuploidy-
suppressive role of p53 is also supported in mouse models
for aneuploid cancer. For instance, while CIN alone was
found to be a poor instigator of cancer, concomitant p53
inactivation resulted in aggressive and highly aneuploid
cancers [53–55]. Likewise, human colon organoids exhibit-
ing a CIN phenotype and harbouring a p53 mutation
form more metastases than those without a CIN phenotype
[56]. Furthermore, mutations in p53 appear to precede the
accumulation of aneuploid cells in Barrett’s oesophagus [57].
Finally, p53 has been found to suppress the propagation of
structural aneuploidies following chromosome segregation
errors [58].

remains

controversial. Possible

However, what exactly activates p53 following an aneu-
triggers
ploidy insult
include the DNA damage response, reactive oxygen species
and histone H3.3 Ser31 phosphorylation following chromo-
some missegregation [59–61]. In addition, the stress kinase
p38 has recently been found to be required for p53-mediated
cell cycle arrest following cytoskeleton disruption [49,62].
Finally, p53 activation could also be a direct consequence of
the aneuploid state itself, although it remains elusive how
p53 would sense this independently of the aneuploidy-
imposed stresses that feed into the p53 signalling pathway.

Overcoming aneuploidy-induced apoptosis is therefore
considered an important aneuploidy-tolerating mechanism
(figure 1) [50]. For instance, the inhibition of JNK signalling
provokes apoptosis of cells displaying a CIN phenotype, pre-
sumably due to an impaired DNA damage response [63].
Conversely, in Drosophila, JNK activation will trigger apopto-
sis in cells exhibiting CIN [64]. While in some cases
aneuploidy-induced apoptosis is p53 dependent [65], and
thus relates to the link between p53 and aneuploidy,
in
other cases resistance towards apoptosis is acquired through
p53-independent mechanisms. For instance,
in colorectal
cancer, BCL9L dysfunction helps cells cope with aneuploidy
by reducing the expression of Caspase-2, thus preventing
cleavage of the p53 inhibitor MDM2 and the pro-apoptotic
protein BID, effectively blocking the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway [66]. In line with this, Caspase-2null mice are more
prone to develop genome unstable lymphoma [67]. Similarly,
the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc can trigger p53-inde-
pendent apoptosis to remove cells that underwent abnormal
mitosis [68]. Finally, yet another, recently uncovered aneu-
ploidy-tolerating mechanism involves MAPK signalling and
the p38 stress response kinase. Reduction of p38 activity
was shown to upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α,
which in turn promotes cell survival following chromosome
missegregation by enhancing glycolysis independently of

Figure 2. Pathways involved in the consequences of aneuploidy. The role of aneuploidy in tumorigenesis depends on tumour stage, cell type, genomic context,
tumour microenvironment and immune response. Aneuploidy promoting detrimental cellular stresses, such as proteotoxic stress (HSP inhibition, proteasome inhi-
bition), metabolic stress (AMPK stimulation), replication stress (MCM inhibition, nucleoside depletion) and mitotic stress (microtubule poisons) can activate apoptosis
and senescence, suppressing tumour development. On the other hand, cancer cells can develop tolerance mechanisms to permit the propagation of aneuploid cells.
Some proliferating aneuploid cells may stimulate the DNA damage response leading to senescence and cGAS activation. The resulting senescent cells can produce
SASPs and the activated cGAS pathway increases pro-inflammatory cytokines to elicit NK cell recognition to suppress tumorigenesis or to promote tumorigenesis or
metastasis.

p53 [27]. Altogether these observations suggest that identify-
ing and targeting the aneuploidy-tolerating pathways
can be exploited to reduce the fitness of aneuploid cells in
tumour development.

4. Potential aneuploidy-targeting

therapeutic strategies

Aneuploidy confers a growth disadvantage to untransformed
cells but still is a hallmark of cancer cells. This suggests
that cancer cells have adopted mechanisms to cope with
the detrimental consequences of aneuploidy, including differ-
ent responses to cellular stresses, immune system activation
and cell cycle arrest as discussed above. As aneuploidy is a
hallmark of cancer cells that discriminates healthy cells
from cancer cells, such mechanisms make promising targets
for cancer therapy, which will be discussed in the context of
the consequences of aneuploidy. Figure 2 shows an overview
of these stresses and some of the possible interventions.

4.1. Enhancing the level of chromosomal instability

Although cells can adapt to aneuploidy through various
mechanisms, excessive CIN beyond a critical point will lead
to the death of cancer cells. Thus, enhancing the level of
CIN has been proposed as a strategy to target aneuploid
cancer cells (table 1). Cells with mild levels of CIN were
found to be more sensitive to low doses of taxol, which
enhanced the number and severity of chromosome segre-
gation errors [69]. Similarly, when CIN rates were increased
in glioblastoma-derived tumour initiation cells (TICs) that
displayed low intrinsic CIN rates, proliferation was decreased

[71]. Several

and tumour formation was abolished in an orthotopic mouse
model [70]. However, while cancer patients are commonly
treated with compounds that increase CIN rates in cultured
cells (e.g. vincristine, paclitaxel), the molecular mechanisms
driving tumour regression in patients treated with such com-
pounds
targeted
compounds that target mitotic regulators such as MPS1,
PLK4 and AURKA to exacerbate CIN phenotypes are cur-
rently in clinical trials, mostly in phase I [72], some of them
with promising first results [73,74]. Other, not yet clinically
applied examples include inhibitors of the SAC proteins
Mad2 or BubR1, which provoke apoptotic cell death in
colorectal cancer cells [75] and the compound INH1, which
targets the Hec1/Nek2-related mitotic pathway thus provok-
ing mitotic abnormalities and cell death [76,77]. Likewise,
combinations of SAC inhibitors and CIN inducers can
synergistically reduce tumour growth. For example, a dys-
functional
the microtubule
combined with
destabilizing drug SKI606 (a Src inhibitor) was found to selec-
tively kill cells with a CIN phenotype [79]. Similarly, the
combination of paclitaxel and MPS1 inhibitors was reported
to reduce the growth of xenografts in vivo much more than
either inhibitor alone [78]. Another in vivo study showed
that combining a p38α inhibitor with taxane-based che-
motherapy increased the efficiency of clearing breast cancer
cells compared to taxanes alone by boosting chromosome
instability [80].

SAC

While these observations clearly show that enhancing
CIN could be a powerful method to eradicate CIN tumours,
the feasibility of such therapies depends on many factors
including CIN status and CIN tolerance, many of which
need further study before we can be certain that enhancing
CIN is a fully safe approach to target CIN cancers.

4.2. Targeting the cellular stresses imposed by

aneuploidy

Instead of targeting the process of chromosome missegregation
itself, specific vulnerabilities caused by aneuploidy-associated
cellular stresses such as proteotoxic, metabolic, replication and
mitotic stress can potentially be exploited in therapy as well,
such as by directly reverting this adaptation or by enhancing
these stresses beyond tolerable levels (table 1), which we will
discuss further below [65,81,82].

Aneuploid cells display proteotoxic stress, which includes
increased protein degradation [83] and aggregation [84], as
well as impaired protein folding [85]. This aneuploidy-
imposed stress is caused by changes in protein levels that
are produced by genes on the aneuploid chromosomes [86]
and which lead to imbalances in the protein complex stoichi-
ometry [41,87]. Indeed, reducing proteotoxic stress improves
the survival of aneuploid cells. For instance, the loss of the
deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) UBP6 improves survival of
aneuploid yeast strains by increasing proteasome-mediated
protein degradation and thus reducing proteotoxic stress
[88]. This poses a targetable vulnerability, as some aneuploid
yeast strains show increased sensitivity to the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 and the loss of the deubiquitinase Ubp3, a
DUB that is required for full proteasome function [11,76].

or drugs

increasing proteotoxic stress.

In addition to the increased protein burden itself, induced
aneuploidy also impairs HSP90-mediated protein folding,
Increasing protein
further
levels of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) counteract this effect,
revealing HSF1 overexpression as an aneuploidy-tolerating
hit in human cells [85]. These observations can possibly be
exploited in therapy, such as by treating aneuploid cancers
with an HSP90 protein folding inhibitor (17-AAG, 17-allyla-
mino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin)
inhibiting
HSF1 activation [83], thus effectively boosting proteotoxic
stress
in aneuploid cells beyond tolerable levels [89].
Indeed, the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG has significant anti-
tumour activity [90], and when combined with the energy
stress-inducing compound AICAR, 17-AAG is particularly
toxic to aneuploid cells [91]. Thus, while eliminating proteo-
toxic stress is beneficial for aneuploid cells, ( pharmaceutical)
exacerbation of proteotoxicity might be a promising new
avenue for cancer therapy.
Autophagy, a process

involved in the removal of
damaged or surplus proteins and organelles is upregulated
in aneuploid cells. For instance, human colon cancer cells car-
rying an extra chromosome display increased LC-3 foci, a
marker for autophagy, compared to control cells [41]. In con-
cordance, aneuploid cells are more sensitive to autophagy
inhibitors [92] such as chloroquine, a compound that inhibits
late stages of autophagy. Chloroquine was shown to prefer-
trisomic MEFs compared
entially inhibit proliferation of
trisomic MEFs showed
to euploid MEFs [93]. Similarly,
impaired proliferation when another autophagy factor,
Beclin 1, was knocked down [91]. Furthermore, aneuploid
cells show increased expression of the cytosolic receptor
SQSTM1, a protein that targets ubiquitinated proteins to the
autophagy machinery further exemplifying how aneuploid
cells depend on autophagy [94]. Altogether, these findings
indicate that interfering with autophagy could be another
promising route towards
selective aneuploidy-targeting
therapy [83].

In addition to proteotoxic stress, aneuploid cells also
suffer from metabolic stress in vitro as well as in vivo
[14,15,41,54,91], which provides another targetable vulner-
ability. For instance, as mentioned above, trisomic MEFs are
much more sensitive to the energy stress-inducing compound
AICAR than their euploid counterparts [92]. Furthermore,
increased proliferation of aneuploid cells coincides with an
increase in the levels of sphingolipids, and conversely, dual
inhibition of serine and sphingolipid synthesis is lethal to
aneuploid yeast cells [95]. The upregulated metabolism
observed in aneuploid cells
frequently coincides with
increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
can activate the DNA damage response [96]. In non-trans-
formed cells, this can be toxic, as shown in Drosophila, in
which aneuploidy-induced ROS triggers JNK activation and
subsequent apoptosis [97]. Together, these findings suggest
that exacerbating the metabolic phenotype of aneuploid
cells could be yet another way to selectively kill aneuploid
cancer cells.

Aneuploidy has also been associated with the downregu-
lation of replication factors, in particular the subunits of the
replicative helicase MCM2-7 [31,98]. The resulting replication
stress can lead to extra-chromosomal instability, such as an
increase in the frequency of anaphase bridges as observed
in aneuploid HCT116 and RPE1 cells. Restoring the
expression of MCM2-7 back to wild-type levels partially res-
cues this phenotype [31]. Similarly, colorectal cancer cells
exhibiting a CIN phenotype also suffer from high levels of
replication stress, which leads to further DNA damage [99].
Supplementing these cells with nucleosides reduces both
DNA damage and segregation errors [99]. Together, these
observations indicate that replication stress as a result of
aneuploidy will further increase the CIN phenotype and
thus tumour heterogeneity. While inhibiting aneuploidy-
imposed replication stress might have limited effects on
established cancer cells, enhancing replication stress could
push aneuploid cells over the edge, which could be another
means to selectively kill CIN cells [99,100].

Lastly, the gains and losses of chromosomes will also
affect the expression of mitotic proteins including the machin-
ery of the SAC and chromosomal segregation. The resulting
mitotic stress might be a reason that stable aneuploidy
leads to CIN and thereby the generation of new karyotypes.
For instance, lymphocytes from individuals born with sys-
temic and stable trisomies for either chromosome 13, 18
and 21 show an increased frequency of aneuploidies for
three other autosomes (chromosomes 8, 15 and 16) compared
to lymphocytes of healthy controls suggesting that stable
aneuploid cells tend to destabilize their genomes [101]. Simi-
carrying an extra
cancer
larly, DLD1 colorectal
chromosome 7 or 13 display reduced mitotic fidelity com-
pared to diploid DLD1 cells [30], further suggesting that
aneuploidy can induce chromosome missegregation.

cells

Taken together, these findings indicate that aneuploidy-
imposed protein imbalances lead to (i) proteotoxicity ( protein
misfolding, protein aggregation and proteasomal degra-
dation), (ii) increased autophagy, (iii) an increased cellular
metabolism, (iv) increased replication stress and (v) a de-
regulated mitotic machinery, which all offer promising
therapeutic targets. However, further research into the effects
of deregulating these pathways in aneuploid cells is still
needed, particularly as exacerbating the toxic effects of
transformation of
CIN might also lead to malignant

non-aneuploid cells. Vice versa, aneuploidy-targeting thera-
pies could also lead to the selection of near-euploid cancer
cells or aneuploid cancer cells that no longer rely on the tar-
geted pathway to cope with CIN, both of which would lead
to cancer recurrence. However, further work, including exten-
sive single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing, is required to
better understand which evolutionary paths CIN tumours
exploit to become therapy resistant.

4.3. Activating the immune system to target

aneuploidy

In addition to targeting cell-intrinsic consequences of aneu-
ploidy, the tumour microenvironment can potentially also
be exploited to clear aneuploid cancer cells. More specifically,
(re)activation of the immune system can become a new thera-
peutic strategy to treat aneuploid tumours since aneuploid
cells might be recognized by the innate immune system
(table 1) [102]. Aneuploid cells with complex karyotypes trig-
ger an upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors [32,102] and
are cleared by natural killer cells in a co-culture setting [102].
In order to survive and transform into an aneuploid cancer
cell, aneuploid cells need to circumvent this clearance mech-
anism, but how aneuploid cancer manage to do this in vivo is
not yet clear. One candidate mechanism to be involved is
cGAS-STING signalling. Missegregated chromosomes often
localize into micronuclei which, when ruptured, release geno-
mic DNA into the cytosol. This leads to the activation of
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a major cytosolic nucleic
acid sensor with dsDNA as its ligand [103–106]. cGAS acti-
cyclic dinucleotide cyclic GMP-AMP
vation generates
Interferon
(cGAMP), which in turn activates a Type I
response and initiates NF-κB signalling via the adaptor
Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) [107,108]. This axis
thus acts tumour suppressive and, indeed, several cancers
display decreased cGAS-STING signalling, including colorec-
tal carcinoma and melanoma [109,110], which has been
associated with poor survival [111]. Cancer cells may thus
have found a way to circumvent activation of the immune
system upon micronuclei rupture. On the other hand, cGAS
was also found to inhibit homologous recombination-
mediated DNA repair, thereby decreasing the efficiency of
DNA repair and thus promoting tumorigenesis
[112].
Furthermore, active cGAS-STING signalling promotes metas-
tasis of human triple-negative breast cancer cells in athymic
mice [103]. The cGAS-STING pathway thus seems to have a
tumour suppressive as well as a tumour-promoting role.
Further work is required to resolve this apparent paradox
and should determine in which setting cGAS-STING inhi-
bition or activation is the best strategy to kill aneuploid
cancer cells [113].

4.4. Targeting aneuploidy by induction of senescence

Senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest without cell
death. Senescence can be induced by unrepaired DNA
damage or other cellular stresses that yield a robust p53
response [114]. As many cancer therapies provoke DNA
damage, therapy-induced senescence has been proposed as a
promising strategy to treat cancer (table 1), particularly
when combined with senolytic drugs (i.e. drugs that next
selectively eliminate the therapy-induced senescent cells [115]).

Numerous studies over the past decades have found that
cellular senescence is a frequent event in CIN cell popu-
lations. For instance, deletion of the SAC genes BUB1 and
MAD2 can trigger a senescence phenotype [116,117]. Simi-
larly inactivation of SMC1A, a component of the Cohesin
complex, leads to aneuploidy and senescence [118]. Aneu-
ploid cell populations secrete cytokines that have been
associated with the senescence-associated secretory pheno-
type (SASP) [119] and can trigger an immune response
[102]. Therefore, exacerbating aneuploidy in cells with a
CIN phenotype in combination with senolytics could
become a new strategy to eradicate aneuploid cancer cells
in vivo.

transformation; however,

Senescence is generally considered as a barrier to malig-
nant
the cytokines secreted by
senescent cells have two opposing roles in the tumorigenesis.
On the one hand, they will trigger cytokine release of the sur-
rounding cancer cells and immune-mediated clearance thus
suppressing tumour development [102]. On the other hand,
the secreted cytokines can also accelerate age-associated phe-
notypes and metastasis [120,121]. Both scenarios appear to
occur in human cancer. For instance, a recent study showed
that provoking complex karyotypes (i.e. more than five
chromosomes gained or lost per cell) in several cell lines
resulted in senescence and SASP, which led to the increased
invasion, migration of the cancer cells in vitro and in vivo
and angiogenesis in vivo [114]. Conversely, another study
found that when a senescent state was induced in gastric
cancer cell lines by silencing Mad2 and BubR1, this led to
decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion and this
phenotype was aggravated when the CIN rates were further
increased by concomitant treatment with the microtubule
poison paclitaxel [122]. In line with the latter, the elimination
of chemotherapy-induced senescent cells was found to
reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and furthermore associ-
ated with reduced chemotherapy-associated bone marrow
suppression and cardiac dysfunction [123]. Taken together,
it is still not fully understood when senescent cancer cells
should be eliminated and when not. This probably relies on
the specific context of the SASP or cancer type.

5. Concluding remarks
In this review, we discussed the paradoxical role of the con-
sequences of aneuploidy as tumour-promoting or tumour-
suppressing features. Although in most cases aneuploidy is
detrimental for cells, it confers a fitness advantage under
some circumstances. This probably depends on the (epi)-gen-
etic context such as the cell type in which the aneuploidy
occurs, but also on the CIN rates within the cells. Thus,
before targeting aneuploid cancers by increasing genomic
instability, both the context as well as the pre-existing CIN
rates should be carefully considered. One way to estimate
in vivo CIN rates is by determining the level of intratumour
karyotype heterogeneity, for instance by single-cell whole-
genome sequencing [45]. When considering increasing CIN
rates as a therapeutic approach, it is furthermore important
to consider that untransformed cells will also be affected by
the CIN-provoking agents and thus will suffer from low to
moderate CIN rates as well, thereby predisposing these
cells to become tumorigenic and lead to therapy-induced can-
cers later on. Therefore, future work should look into how to

more selectively target cells displaying a CIN phenotype,
either by drug-mediated CIN exacerbation or by (co-)treat-
ment with drugs that exploit other vulnerabilities of CIN
cells.

Several of the aneuploidy stress responses have been dis-
cussed in this review. However, there is mounting evidence
that aneuploid cancer cells have activated tolerance mechan-
isms to adapt to the detrimental outcome of these stress
responses. For instance, the discovery that aneuploid cells
have downregulated HSP90 mRNA and protein and are
impaired in HSP90-mediated protein folding led to the find-
ing that aneuploid cells are very sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors
[124]. It is therefore of the utmost importance to better under-
stand how cells adapt to and cope with an aneuploid DNA
content as this will probably reveal more approaches to selec-
tively target cells with a CIN phenotype. In addition to
studying the pathways that help cells cope with an aneuploid
state, we should also look further into which mutations in
aneuploid cancers help aneuploid cells to convert into aneu-
ploid cancer cells as these are also promising targets for
(re)activation of the
aneuploid cancer therapy. Similarly,
immune system could become a new therapeutic strategy to
treat aneuploid tumours since aneuploid cells might be

recognized by the innate immune system and aneuploid
cancer cells might have blocked this response. Future work
should reveal whether this response also takes place in vivo
and how a failing immune response could be reinstated.
Lastly, we need to further unravel the relationship between
aneuploidy and senescence. Indeed, inducing senescence by
DNA damage or provoking CIN has been suggested to be
an effective way to treat cancer. However, the role of senes-
cent cells in cancer is still controversial: in some contexts, it
is tumour inhibiting, in others tumour promoting. Therefore,
future studies should investigate whether senescent cells
should be eliminated or not, which probably depends on
the individual cancer type.
