Abstract 
Background:  Refugees are forced migrants but there is a large variation in the distance that refugees cover and 
there is a paucity in the evidence of how this may affect refugees’ health and health care needs. Objective: We investi-
gated the association between long-distance migration and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a serious psychiat-
ric disorder associated with deteriorating mental and somatic health.

Methods:  Included from 2016–2019 were adult Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Denmark that arrived up to 
12 months prior to inclusion. PTSD was assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the estimate of associa-
tion was obtained by multiply imputing missing data and adjusting for confounding by propensity score-weighting 
with covariates age, sex, socioeconomic status, trauma experience and general mental well-being, reporting the 
bootstrap 95-percentile confidence interval (95% CI). Additionally, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results:  Included were 599 participants in Lebanon (mean age 35 years old, 73% being female) and 133 participants 
in Denmark (mean age 30 years old, 47% being female). After multiply imputing missing data and propensity score-
weighted adjustment for confounding, migration to Denmark instead of Lebanon was associated with an increase in 
PTSD prevalence of 9 percentage point (95% CI [-1; 19] percentage point).

Conclusions:  Long-distance migration may be associated with an increase in PTSD prevalence in refugees. The 
migration could be an important factor to consider when assessing refugees’ and asylum seekers’ health. Practitioners 
should consider “long-distance migration” in refugee health screenings and in particular when assessing the risk of 
post-traumatic stress disorder. Future research should be designed to ultimately lead to studies of relevant interven-
tions to lower the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in refugees.

Background
Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  severe  psy-
chiatric disorder that is associated with significant loss 
of  functioning  and  increased  morbidity  and  mortality 
[1–3].  Risk  factors  include  multiple  traumas,  female 
sex, being spouseless, lower educational status, comor-
bid  disease  and  type  of  trauma  [3,  4].  Also,  gene-envi-
ronment interactions may play a key role [5]. Refugees

may be exposed to risk-factors for PTSD before, during 
and  after  migration  (e.g.  trauma,  acquiring  comorbid 
disease,  low  socioeconomic  status,  psychiatric  co-
morbidity)  [6–8];  however,  compared  with  the  general 
population in the country of origin refugees in western 
countries on average have lower burden of several risk 
factors for PTSD such as higher educational status and 
lower comorbidity [8–11]. There is little empirical evi-
dence on pre- and peri-migratory morbidity in refugees 
probably  due  to  difficulty  in  data  acquisition. There  is, 
however,  an  abundance  of  publications  on  post-migra-
tory morbidity in refugees, for example, the prevalence 
of  latent  tuberculosis  is  reported  between  15  and  45% 
[12]  and  the  prevalence  of  depression  between  3  and 
58% in a recent meta-analysis [13]. The post-migratory 
prevalence  of  PTSD  across  refugee  populations  was 
estimated  to  31%  [13]  and  about  three  times  higher 
than  in  the  general  population  in  the  host  country  [3, 
14]  although,  with  considerable  variation  between 
country of origin (e.g. in Australia, the prevalence was 
21% in refugees from Africa and Asia and 63% in refu-
gees from former Yugoslavia) and host country (e.g. in 
refugees  from  Iraq,  the  prevalence  was  43%  in  Turkey 
and 4% in USA). To design appropriate interventions to 
counter  this  disparity  in  health,  the  drivers  of  the  dis-
parity  must  be  understood  [15,  16];  however,  there  is 
a  paucity  of  evidence  on  one  of  the  most  fundamental 
factors shared by refugees: the migration itself. In par-
ticular, there is a knowledge gap in the health effects of 
the distance between the country of origin and the host 
country.  The  concept  of  “distance”  and  the  association 
between long-distance migration and a number of non-
health  outcomes  has  received  some  attention  [17–20]. 
Recently,  Spolaore  and  Warcziarg  [21]  used  data  from 
the  World  Values  Survey  to  produce  estimates  of  the 
distance  between  pairs  of  countries  and  showed  that 
this  was  correlated  with  amongst  others  genetic  dis-
tance  (a  measure  of  relatedness  between  populations 
based on gene frequency). Detollenaere et al. [22] used 
these  distance  estimates  to  show  that  long-distance 
migration was associated with lower self-rated health in 
migrant populations with mean length of stay > 20 years 
in European host countries. Specifically for the associa-
tion between PTSD and long-distance migration recent 
studies  of  Syrian  refugees  in  northern  European  and 
middle  eastern  countries  have  been  ambiguous  [23, 
24], however, were hampered by confounding and non-
randomised sample designs. Here, we present a cluster-
randomised potential outcomes study in newly arrived 
Syrian  refugees  in  Lebanon  and  newly  arrived  Syrian 
asylum seekers in Denmark to estimate the association 
between long-distance migration and PTSD prevalence 
minimising  by  design  the  effect  of  living  in  the  host 

country.  We  hypothesised  an  increased  PTSD  preva-
lence after long-distance migration.

Methods
In  a  cross-sectional  design  with  one-stage  cluster  ran-
domised  sampling  between  2016  through  2019,  newly 
arrived  Syrian  refugees  were  included  in  Lebanon  and 
newly  arrived  Syrian  asylum  seekers  were  included  in 
Denmark and assessed for PTSD. The implemented inclu-
sion  criteria  were:  (a)  adult  (≥ 18  years  of  age),  (b)  Syr-
ian-born, (c) had left Syria after the onset of the ongoing 
civil-war (after February 2011), (d) arrived in host coun-
try less than 12 months prior to inclusion and (e) resident 
at  the  inclusion  site  at  the  time  of  inclusion.  Exclusion 
criteria  were  physical  or  mental  illness  that  prevented 
participation.  The  study  was  performed  in  accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by all 
appropriate ethics committees. We report in accordance 
with  the  STROBE  guideline  for  reporting  observational 
studies [25] (Supplementary Material 1).

Lebanon  is  a  country  of  about  6  million  people  liv-
ing  in  an  area  of  nearly  10.000   km2,  bordering  Syria, 
the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  Israel.  Since  2015  Lebanon 
has  stopped  accepting  asylum  applications  from  Syrians 
seeking  refuge  in  Lebanon.  Nevertheless,  being  a  close 
neighbour,  in  both  geographical,  linguistic  and  cultural 
distance,  the  influx  of  Syrian  refugees  has  endured  with 
the  majority  living  in  structures  ranging  from  regular 
(though dilapidated) structures to improvised tents clus-
tered  in  informal  gatherings  and  formal  refugee  camps 
scattered  across  Lebanon  [26].  Denmark  is  a  Northern 
European country of about 6 million people living in an 
area  of  about  50.000   km2.  With  few  exceptions,  an  asy-
lum  seeker  is  allocated  by  random  to  one  of  the  Dan-
ish  asylum  seeker  centres.  These  centres  are  run  by  the 
Danish Immigration Services but outsourced to different 
operators.  Several  types  of  asylum  seeker  centres  exist 
with the most common being the accommodation centre.

Variables and data‑collection instruments

The  exposure  was  long-distance  migration  as  indicated 
by  the  Spolaore  and  Warcziarg  distance  estimates  [21]: 
migration  from  Syria  to  Lebanon  was  short-distance, 
i.e.  “unexposed”,  and  migration  from  Syria  to  Denmark 
was  long-distance,  i.e.  “exposed”.  The  outcome,  PTSD, 
was  assessed  using  the  Harvard  Trauma  Questionnaire 
(HTQ): A self-administered scale to assess symptoms of 
PTSD  in  the  past  week  according  to  the  DSM-IV  crite-
ria [27] and validated in multiple settings, languages and 
populations [28–30]. Two recent studies that investigated 
the construct validity, factor structure and measurement 
invariance  found  that  the  HTQ  is  a  reliable  instrument 
in  non-western  populations  in  general  [31]  and  Arabic 

Eiset et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2022) 22:363

speaking  refugees  in  particular  [32].  The  DSM-IV  score 
is the mean of 16 items scored from 1 (“not at all”) to 4 
(“extremely”) and a cut-off ≥ 2.5 is often taken to indicate 
PTSD; however, it is debated whether this cut-off score is 
transportable across cultural settings [33]. The validated 
Arabic 2007 version [34] was used. The internal consist-
ency for the HTQ was estimated by Cronbach’s alpha to 
0.93.

The  variables  necessary  to  address  confounding 
were  decided  upon  a  priori  after  discussions  among 
the  authors  guided  by  graphical  representation  of  our 
assumptions  (Supplementary  Fig.  1)  and  included  age, 
sex,  exposure  to  violence  during  migration  (victim  or 
witness),  socioeconomic  status  in  the  country  of  origin, 
and general mental well-being. For the latter, the WHO-5 
scale  was  used:  a  self-administered  scale  to  assess  “sub-
jective positive well-being” [35, 36], validated across set-
tings and cultures [36–38]. The five items are scored from 
0 (“at no time”) to 5 (“all of the time”), summed and mul-
tiplied  by  4;  a  cut-off  score ≤ 50  indicates  a  risk  of  poor 
well-being,  while  scores < 13,  or  any  one  item-score  of  0 
or 1, indicates poor well-being and formal diagnostics for 
depression  and  mental  health  issues  are  recommended. 
The  validated  Arabic  1999-version  [39]  was  used.  All 
other variables were collected using a questionnaire (Sup-
plementary Text 1) developed in Danish, translated by a 
bilingual  and  bicultural  translator  into  Arabic  (mother 
tongue  Syrian  Arabic)  and  back  translated  by  two  inde-
pendent translators (mother tongue Arabic (other Arabic 
dialects than Syrian). Each item was evaluated and minor 
corrections were implemented. The final translated ques-
tionnaire was approved by MPA, RSH and WJN.

Sample size, randomisation and data collection

Based  on  power  calculations  the  aimed  sample  size  was 
1100  participants  in  Lebanon  and  220  in  Denmark  [40]. 
In  both  Lebanon  and  Denmark  cluster  sampling  was 
used and data was collected by teams of health care pro-
fessionals (at least author AHE or MPA at any time) and 
students  after  several  training  sessions  in  practicalities 
and  ethical  considerations.  In  collaboration  with  local 
non-governmental  organisations,  Lebanon  was  stratified 
into five regions based on geography, infrastructure and 
insights about local concerns (political, religious etc.) and 
the sampling frame was drawn to include all formal and 
informal  refugee  camps,  urban  and  rural  communities, 
settlements  and  gatherings  of  Syrian  refugees.  Inclusion 
sites were chosen at random from within each strata (i.e. 
stratified cluster sampling) and all individuals eligible for 
inclusion,  as  determined  by  oral  communication,  were 
invited  to  participate  securing  proportional  allocation. 
Permission to include participants in all regions of Leba-
non was obtained, including areas that are usually outside 

the reach of researchers due to “security considerations”. 
In  case  of  unsafe  conditions  at  the  scheduled  area  and 
time  of  inclusion  the  closest  setting  deemed  appropri-
ate within the same region was used. In Denmark, all five 
operators of accommodation centres were invited to par-
ticipate. Three responded to the invitation, all accepting, 
representing  a  total  of  11  accommodation  centres.  All 
eligible residents at six randomly sampled accomodation 
centres  were  invited.  After  informed  oral  and  written 
consent,  participants  were  instructed  to  independently 
complete  the  background  questionnaire  and  the  men-
tal  health  scales.  The  data  collectors  assisted  those  who 
could not read or write or had further questions regard-
ing  the  study.  Participants  could  at  any  time  opt  out  of 
the data collection. Individuals that refused to participate 
were  asked  for  a  short  non-structured  interview  includ-
ing  basic  demographics  and  reason  for  refusal.  All  par-
ticipants  that  needed  immediate  medical  or  psychiatric 
assistance were referred to the local operators in Lebanon 
or Denmark. The procedure was piloted in Denmark. All 
relevant permissions were obtained prior to inclusion of 
any participant in both Lebanon and Denmark. The sam-
pling  frame,  sample  size  estimation  for  each  region  and 
training of the team of data collectors, is detailed in the 
study protocol [40].

Statistical analysis

The  analysis  plan  was  specified  a  priori  and  is  supplied 
at https:// github. com/ eiset/ ARCH together with a num-
ber of exploratory plots and the R code. In the following 
we give a brief summary of the applied statistical meth-
odology  and  refer  to  Supplementary  Text  2,  Supple-
mentary  Tables  1–2  and  Supplementary  Figs.  3,  4,  5  for 
further details as well as [41] for an in-depth discussion 
of its implications and usage. Missing data was multiply 
imputed  after  verifying  for  each  partly  observed  vari-
able  that  the  data  was  “everywhere  missing  at  random” 
(see  Supplementary  Text  2  and  [42].  For  each  partly 
observed  variable  missing  values  were  imputed  using 
the  substantive  model  and  additional  auxiliary  variables 
that  were  known  or  empirically  shown  to  be  predictors 
of  the  given  variable.  This  resulted  in  a  “response-and-
predictor matrix” as presented in Supplementary Table 2. 
Confounding was addressed by propensity score-weight-
ing:  The  “standardised  mortality  ratio”-weights  [43]  was 
computed to estimate the weighted prevalence difference 
of  PTSD  in  the  population  that  migrated  to  Denmark 
instead  of  Lebanon  and  presented  with  a  95-percentile 
confidence interval found by bootstrapping. Three expo-
sure  models  of  increasing  complexity  were  proposed 
(Supplementary  Table  1)  and  three  levels  of  truncation 
of  extreme  weights  implemented  (none,  at  1st  and  99th 
percentile  and  at  5th  and  95th  percentile).  The  simplest

model  with  least  truncation  where  all  covariates  had  an 
absolute standardized mean difference below 10% was to 
be  used  as  the  model  for  the  main  analysis.  To  evaluate 
the robustness of the results of the analysis, the following 
sensitivity analyses were planned:

•  Evaluating the model choice for the propensity score 
analysis  using  other  propensity  score  models  (Sup-
plementary Table 1) that obtained acceptable balance 
on all covariates.

•  The cut-off value of the HTQ score to indicate PTSD 
was  set  to  the  “standard” ≥ 2.5.  The  estimates  and 
corresponding 95% CI from models with cut-off val-
ues at ≥ 2.3 and ≥ 2.7 is supplied.

•  Assessing  the  impact  of  non-ignorable  missingness 
mechanism  by  forcing  all  missing  in  the  “socio-eco-
nomic status” covariate in participants from Lebanon 
to be “Do not know/refuse to answer” and forcing all 
missing  in  the  “Experienced  violence  during  migra-
tion”  covariate  in  participants  from  Denmark  to 
“Yes”. In both scenarios all other missing were kept as 
imputed.

In  addition  “consonance  plots”  [44]  were  produced  to 
allow  for  visualisation  of  the  compatibility  of  hypoth-
esised  point  estimates  with  the  data.  All  data  manage-
ment, analysis and plots were done in R [45] with heavy 
reliance  on  the  “Tidyverse”  packages  [46]  for  data  man-
agement  and  plots,  “smcfcs”  [47]  for  multiple  imputa-
tion,  “WeightIt”  [48]  for  obtaining  the  propensity  score 
weights,  “boot”  [49]  for  parallelised  bootstrapping,  and 
“furrr” [50] for further parallelising.

Results
A  total  of  599  individuals  were  included  in  Lebanon 
(response  rate  95%)  and  113  were  included  in  Denmark 
(response rate 93%). Figure 1 gives a statistical summary 
of the inclusion process and non-participation. In Leba-
non, the mean duration of migration from Syria was one 
day,  60%  had  travelled  by  car  and  30%  had  travelled  by 
bus.  In  Denmark,  the  mean  duration  of  migration  was 
44  days,  70%  had  travelled  by  boat,  60%  had  walked 
long distances and 50% had travelled by train. The mean 
length of stay in the host country at time of inclusion was 
4 months in Lebanon and 6 months in Denmark.

The study populations differed on key variables such as 
sex (female: 73% in Lebanon, 47% in Denmark) and expe-
rience  of  violence  (24%  in  Lebanon,  39%  in  Denmark) 
and  there  were  missing  values  for  all  variables  except 
long-distance  migration.  Figure  2  illustrates  the  missing 
proportion of key variables stratified on exposure status. 
The assumptions for doing multiple imputation were met 
(see  Supplementary  Text  2)  and  Table  1  gives  a  detailed 
summary of the study population characteristics for both 
the observed realisation and the imputed data set includ-
ing  missing  for  each  covariates  in  the  observed  data. 
Eight  individuals  (25%  female)  refused  participating  in 
Denmark while 31 individuals (16% female) refused par-
ticipating  in  Lebanon,  however  few  agreed  to  provide 
any  information.  In  Denmark,  the  primary  reason  was 
mistrust and in Lebanon primarily reason was time con-
cerns. Further details are given in Supplementary Table 3.
The unadjusted prevalence of PTSD was higher in Den-
mark (60.2%) compared with Lebanon (55.1%). The prev-
alence difference of PTSD increased from 5.1 percentage

after  multiply  imputing  missing  data  and  adjusting  for 
confounding by propensity score-weighting. All sensitiv-
ity analyses produced estimates in the same direction and 
of  the  same  magnitude,  except  when  forcing  all  missing 
in  the  “Violence”  variable  to  “Yes”  in  the  study  popula-
tion  included  in  Denmark,  thus,  grossly  violating  the 
missing-at-random  assumption  of  multiple  imputation. 
Table  2  presents  the  point  estimate  for  the  propensity 
score-weighted analysis and each of the sensitivity analy-
sis accompanied by Fig. 3 which includes different types 
of  bootstrap  confidence  intervals.  Supplementary  Fig.  6 
shows  that  under  the  proposed  model  every  prevalence 
difference  from > 0  to  17  percentage  point  is  more  com-
patible  with  the  data  than  a  prevalence  difference  of  0 
and below.

Discussion
This  study  aimed  at  estimating  the  association  between 
long-distance  migration  and  prevalence  of  PTSD.  The 
estimate  of  association  corresponded  to  87  additional 
cases  of  PTSD  for  every  1000  Syrian  refugees  that 
migrated  to  Denmark  instead  of  Lebanon.  The  95-per-
centile  confidence  interval  indicates  that,  under  the 

model,  the  estimate  may  be  as  high  as  190  additional 
cases or as low as 4 cases less per 1000 refugees, thus, the 
estimate did not reach statistical significance, which may 
be ascribed to the relatively low number of participants.

Our  finding  is  in  accordance  with  a  recent  study  [23] 
in  a  non-randomised  sample  of  very  heterogeneous 
groups of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Norway where 
“Host  country,  Norway”  was  associated  with  an  average 
increase in HTQ-score of 3% (95% CI [-5%; 12%]) when 
adjusting for age and sex; however, the study did not pro-
vide estimates of how this translated into absolute num-
ber of participants with PTSD. With a mean HTQ-score 
of 1.49 in the study population in Lebanon the number of 
additional cases in Norway due to “host country” would 
be  marginal.  The  study  did  not  account  for  time  since 
arrival  in  the  host  country  neither  by  design  nor  in  the 
statistical  analysis.  Two  studies  have  been  conducted 
in  non-randomised  samples  of  Syrian  refugees  in  Swe-
den and Turkey [24, 51], both did not take into account 
time  since  arrival  in  the  host  country.  In  keeping  with 
our  results,  Hall  and  Kahn  [51]  found  that,  after  adjust-
ing  for  exposure  to  trauma,  the  probability  of  report-
ing symptoms of PTSD was higher in the Swedish study 
population compared with the Turkish study population, 
however,  in  opposition  to  this  Chung  et  al.  [24]  found

that  the  crude  prevalence  estimate  of  reporting  PTSD 
symptoms  was  higher  in  the  Turkish  study  population 
compared with the Swedish study population. While dis-
similar  in  aim  and  methodological  approach,  the  differ-
ences in the reported results may also be a result of the 
non-random sampling design.

The  underlying  cause  for  the  observed  increase  in 
PTSD  prevalence  in  Syrian  refugees  after  long-distance 
migration  has  never  been  investigated.  Some  studies 
hypothesise  that  great  distance  between  populations 
is  associated  with  difficulty  acculturating  (e.g.  “longing 
for people, places and things in the homeland” and “not 
feeling  part  of  one’s  surrounding  or  social  structure”) 
which  in  turn  is  associated  with  worse  health  outcomes 
including mental health [22, 52–54], for example, accul-
turative  stress  predicted  PTSD  in  a  small  non-random 
sample  of  Bosnian  refugees  living  in  Austria  for  a  mean 
of 18 years [55] and in a large random sample of Syrian 

refugees living in Sweden for more than 3 years [56]. The 
present  study  is  a  first  step  in  separating  out  the  health 
effects  of  the  migration  from  the  post-migratory  phase 
in a refugee population: By design, the study populations 
had stayed in Lebanon or Denmark for a very short time 
(about 5 months) and the effect of cumulative accultura-
tive  stress  was  minimised  but  “acute”  stressors  such  as 
insecurity about the daily living and unfamiliar customs 
may play a role.

The  prevalence  estimates  of  PTSD  was  high  in  both 
Lebanon (55%) and Denmark (60%) compared with pre-
vious  studies  of  Syrian  refugees  [13,  56–59],  although 
higher  PTSD  prevalence  have  also  been  reported  [60]. 
Informally, there does not seem to be a clear relation to 
host  country,  study  design  and  utilised  instruments  for 
assessing PTSD. In all studies, Syrian refugees had stayed 
more than a year in the host country at time of inclusion. 
The  randomised  design  and  the  very  high  participation

rate in the present study strengthen the confidence in the 
prevalence estimate.

Limitations

There  are  several  points  of  limitations  in  the  current 
study.  Firstly,  the  targeted  sample  size  was  not  reached 
in Lebanon nor in Denmark due to structural and politi-
cal obstacles as well as the outbreak of a global pandemic 
during  the  data  collection.  Still,  a  positive  association  is 
more  compatible  with  the  data  than  the  opposite  (see 
Supplementary  Fig.  6).  Secondly,  the  interpretation  of 
the  association  between  long-distance  migration  and 
PTSD  is  limited  by  the  cross-sectional  study  design. 
Most importantly, the time-order may be reversed so that 
instead  of  long-distance  migration  affecting  the  risk  of 
PTSD it may be that PTSD affects the “risk” of undertak-
ing long-distance migration. Specifically, a positive asso-
ciation  between  long-distance  migration  and  PTSD  was 
found, thus, a reversal of the time order would mean that 
individuals with PTSD are more likely to undertake long-
distance migration, that is, travel to Denmark instead of 
Lebanon.  Although  this  cannot  be  rejected,  taking  into 
account  the  pathophysiology  of  PTSD  with  impaired 
executive function including difficulties in concentrating 
and  planning,  we  find  this  interpretation  less  convinc-
ing. Thirdly,  we  used  a  self-administered  score  to  assess 
PTSD  and  did  not  have  the  opportunity  to  confirm  its 
result  with  a  diagnostic  interview  by  a  psychiatrist.  The 
HTQ-score  is  considered  valid  across  multiple  settings 
and  diagnostic  classification  systems  and  the  sensitiv-
ity analysis showed little change in the estimate of asso-
ciation including when changing the HTQ-score cut-off. 
Fourthly,  while  we  have  secured  strong  control  of  the 
most  important  confounders,  the  obtained  sample  size 
did not allow to add all potential confounders in the anal-
ysis.  The  collapsing  of  two  levels  of  the  socioeconomic 
status variable and the somewhat coarse measure of vari-
ables  such  as  trauma  exposure  (assessed  with  one  item 
in  the  questionnaire)  may  further  be  a  source  for  resid-
ual  confounding  in  both  the  multiple  imputation  and  in 
the  propensity  score  weighted  analysis.  We  provide  an 
alternative  DAG  to  illustrate  the  associations  of  addi-
tional variables (Supplementary Fig. 2). It shows that the 
minimally  sufficient  adjustment  set  may  not  differ  from 
what was implemented in our analysis. Fifthly, it was not 
possible  to  retrieve  or  create  a  precise  sampling  frame 
in  Lebanon  and  thus,  it  was  based  on  best  information 
available  at  the  time,  knowing  that  refugees  frequently 
relocate and there is little registration of individuals out-
side the formalised refugee camps. We still consider the 
risk of selection bias low given the randomised sampling 
design  and  very  high  participation  rates.  Sixthly,  the 
proportion of missing data was high in several variables 

(Fig.  2)  which  may  bias  the  results.  We  found  that  the 
data  was  “everywhere  missing-at-random”,  i.e.  for  each 
partly observed variable any possible missingness pattern 
was independent of the missing values in the variable in 
question given the covariates and the observed values of 
the  variable  [42],  and  implemented  an  advanced  type  of 
multiple imputation to counter missing data. We discuss 
this in detail in the Supplementary Text 2. While adher-
ence  to  the  assumptions  of  multiple  imputation  cannot 
be formally proven, in the sensitivity analyses only gross 
violation  of  these  assumptions  changed  the  magnitude 
of  the  estimate  while  preserving  the  direction  of  asso-
ciation. Finally, the proportion that refused to answer, or 
did  not  know  what  to  answer,  in  the  question  on  socio-
economic status was high and differed between the study 
population in Denmark (22%) and in Lebanon (7%). After 
discussing this variable with Syrian natives, we speculate 
that “socioeconomic status” was not defined in sufficient 
detail for all participants to be able to reflect on the ques-
tion; however, we do not have an explanation for the dif-
ference  between  Lebanon  and  Denmark.  If  participants 
in  Denmark  were  more  likely  to  misrepresent  or  hide 
high  socioeconomic  status  the  PTSD  prevalence  differ-
ence after long-distance migration would be even higher.

Implications for future studies

Future research should concentrate to confirm the asso-
ciation, preferably acquiring a larger sample size. Also of 
interest is the transportability to other groups of refugees 
and to investigate the underlying factors contributing to 
the association, for example examine the different meas-
ures  of  “distance”  (cultural,  geographical  etc.).  We  note 
that the direction of the association was consistent across 
different  thresholds  for  PTSD  (effectively  lowering  and 
raising  the  estimated  prevalence  for  PTSD  in  the  study 
population), different propensity score models and when 
imposing violation of underlying assumptions of multiple 
imputation.  We  hypothesise  that  the  association  will  be 
reproducible at least in comparable populations and set-
tings—for  example  newly  arrived  adult  refugees  from  a 
Middle Eastern country to a Western European country.

Conclusions
In this study, the prevalence of PTSD was high in newly 
arrived  Syrian  refugees  in  both  Lebanon  and  Denmark. 
In  the  multiply  imputed  and  propensity  score-weighted 
analysis,  the  prevalence  of  PTSD  increased  with  87 
(95-percentile CI [-4; 190]) additional cases of PTSD for 
every  1000  Syrian  refugees  that  migrated  to  Denmark 
instead of Lebanon. Practitioners may take into consider-
ation “long-distance migration” in refugee health screen-
ings  and  in  particular  when  assessing  the  risk  of  PTSD. 
With the present study we begin to study the association
