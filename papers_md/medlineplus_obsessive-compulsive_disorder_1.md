### What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is amental disorderin which you have thoughts (obsessions) and rituals (compulsions) over and over. They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them.

### What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.

### Who is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls.

Risk factors for OCD include:

- Family history.People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen.

- Brain structure and functioning.Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD.

- Childhood trauma,such aschild abuse. Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.

In some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following astreptococcal infection. This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS).

### What are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both:

- Obsessionsare repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that causeanxiety. They may involve things such asFear of germs or contaminationFear of losing or misplacing somethingWorries about harm coming towards yourself or othersUnwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religionAggressive thoughts towards yourself or othersNeeding things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way

- Fear of germs or contamination

- Fear of losing or misplacing something

- Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others

- Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion

- Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others

- Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way

- Compulsionsare behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions includeExcessive cleaning and/or handwashingRepeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is offCompulsive countingOrdering and arranging things in a particular, precise way

- Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing

- Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off

- Compulsive counting

Some people with OCD also haveTourette syndromeor another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do over and over. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things.

### How is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed?

The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. It's important to check whether a physical problem is causing your symptoms. So your provider will do a physical exam and will ask you about your medical history. If your symptoms do not seem to be caused by a physical problem, your provider may do anOCD testor may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder.

Not everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you:

- Can't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive

- Spend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors

- Don't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety.

- Have significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors

### What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?

The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to your obsessions and compulsions.Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.

- Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.

- Medicinesfor OCD include certain types ofantidepressants. If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.

If you have severe OCD that does not get better with these treatments, your provider may suggest a treatment called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves. It can target specific brain areas associated with OCD.
