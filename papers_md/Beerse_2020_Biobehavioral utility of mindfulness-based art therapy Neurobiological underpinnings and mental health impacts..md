Impact statement

Recent studies demonstrate the thera-
peutic potential of intensive MBAT and
other mindfulness-based interventions for
severe health conditions including cancer,
heart disease, and anxiety, with effective-
ness that rivals and sometimes even
exceeds cognitive behavior therapy.
MBAT-based approaches appear to be
poised to mature into large-scale, cost-
effective therapies for mental health disor-
ders and symptoms comorbid with other
serious health issues. However, the field
currently suffers from inconsistent deploy-
ment protocols and needs additional vali-
dation data—at the behavioral, neuroen-
docrine, and neural levels—in order to
establish best practices.

Abstract
Mindfulness-based art therapy (MBAT) combines mindfulness practices with art therapy to
promote health, wellness, and adaptive responses to stress. Mindfulness-based stress
reduction programs have been demonstrated to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with
generalized anxiety disorder and serious medical conditions such as cancer. However, the
benefits of MBAT specifically—not just in clinical anxiety disorders, but also for routine day-
to-day anxiousness—have received little attention until recently. In this mini-review, we
summarize how several established mindfulness-based interventions affect mental health
with a specific focus on MBAT. We also describe and evaluate data indicating involvement
of specific neural circuits and neuroendocrine markers of stress and/or anxiety. Lastly, we
suggest areas of focus for future rigorous research on MBAT interventions and propose
multiple biobehavioral and physiological mechanisms through which therapeutic benefits
may be achieved.

Anxiety and stress

Anxiety disorders constitute the largest group of mental
disorders in most parts of the world and are a leading
cause of disability. In the United States, anxiety disorders
and mood disorders are the most common mental health
disorders with 12-month prevalence rates of approximately
18.1% and 9.5%, respectively.1 Of note, although anxiety
disorders and major depression are often comorbid with
one another and can present with common symptoms,
these disorders are distinct clinically and involve dysfunc-
tions in distinct brain circuits and molecules. Nevertheless,
both anxiety disorders and mood disorders are related to
poor physical health outcomes,2–4 in addition to dimin-
ished quality of life, impairments in daily functioning,
productivity.5–7

Speciﬁcally, both anxiety disorders and mood disorders
are associated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic dis-
orders, cancer, sleep disorders, and decreased longevity.
Links between poor physical health and anxiety or mood
disorders are distinct, reciprocal, and complicated, but it is
also appreciated that there are shared neural and endocrine
mechanisms. Interestingly, research suggests that the etio-
logical pathways are similar between poor physical health
outcomes and chronic daily stress, a common risk factor in
the onset of both anxiety disorders and mood disorders.8,9
Beyond clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders, approxi-
mately 7 out of 10 adults in the United States report mod-
erately impairing levels of stress or anxiety on a daily
basis.10 Poorly managed anxiety and/or stress can contrib-
ute to economic and global burdens, including student loan

terms of years lived in less than ideal health, anxiety dis-
orders are the sixth leading cause of disability throughout
the world14 and account for 390 disability-adjusted life
years per 100,000 individuals. Chronic daily stress and anx-
iety increase the risk of physical pathology like sleep qual-
functioning,
gain, decreased cognitive
ity, weight
cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and gastro-
intestinal problems.9,15,16 Similar to anxiety and mood dis-
orders, the association between chronic daily stress and
anxiety and poor physical health are due to the effects
that chronic daily stress and anxiety have on biological
systems essential for optimal health. Stress induces neuro-
immune and neuro-endocrine responses, and individual
differences in these effects contribute to vulnerability and
resilience.17 At a mechanistic level, stress can even trans-
form signals in the brain that are typically related to reward
into punishment signals and thus bias individuals towards
negative expectations, anxiety symptoms, and depression-
related behaviors.18

Chronic stress and anxiety disorders have both been pre-
viously associated with dysregulation of stress hormones,
neuro-inﬂammatory markers, and neural circuit activa-
tion.15,19–25 These maladaptations are in turn correlated
with negative health consequences including metabolic
syndrome,26,27 cardiovascular disease risk,9,16,28 and chron-
ic pain.29–32 Circulating cytokines, including tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), help inter-
connect signals between the central nervous system and
peripheral immune system.33 Moreover, they can amplify
the production of other secreted molecules and intensify
immune responses. Cytokines play a variety of roles
including the initiation of
within the nervous system,
immune processes,
the promotion of repair after cell
injury, and regulation of endocrine signals and feed-
back.17,34 Several studies support altered cytokines and
other inﬂammatory markers in anxiety disorders.19–22

Approaches to mindfulness and established
effects of mindfulness interventions on
mental health and neural systems

Mindfulness refers to the psychological process of attend-
ing to experiences happening in the present moment; it is
originally derived from ancient Eastern roots, especially
Buddhist traditions and yogic practices. It focuses on pro-
gressively orienting a person to an awareness of connec-
tions and interaction between body and mind. Recently,
such practices have been adopted and adapted by
Western cultures for wellness management and clinical
interventions. Research demonstrates a strong relationship
between mindfulness practices and quality mental health.
The most common method of mindfulness-based interven-
tion for reducing stress is mindfulness-based stress reduc-
tion (MBSR).35,36 A standard MBSR curriculum is eight
weeks long and structured in a group therapy format,
with each session typically lasting between 1 and 2 h in
length. Mindfulness-based interventions exert positive
impacts on an individual’s mental health in addition to
physical health.37–44 Effectiveness has been established

not only for clinically diagnosed anxiety disorders but
also for subclinical levels of anxiety and stress. Two meta-
analyses have established that mindfulness-based interven-
tions are at least as efﬁcacious as cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT).38,45 Possible biological mediators of positive
effects include improved sleep quality,23,46 brain structure
changes,47 and enhanced cortisol regulation.23,48 A mind-
fulness intervention also reduced stress and improved
mental well-being in caregivers for family members with
dementia,49 suggesting that a wide array of stress-related
burdens might be responsive to these therapies. However,
studies in this area are not always well controlled, and ran-
domized control trials of behavioral therapies are more dif-
ﬁcult to design and interpret than are pharmaceutical
interventions.50 For example, effectiveness in a behavioral
intervention is dependent on not only characteristics of the
intervention provider but also factors relating to the recip-
ient and how they engage with the intervention. A therapist
providing a behavioral intervention is equipped with a
unique combination of training and clinical experience,
meaning subtle variations may exist between therapists
and how they adhere to and facilitate a behavioral inter-
vention protocol. Consequently, this will have an impact on
how a recipient responds to the intervention. Moreover,
regardless of the background, skill, and decisions of the
provider, a recipient independently decides their level of
engagement with the intervention, while their cultural
background and personal experience can impact how
they interpret and respond to it. This differs greatly from
a medication trial where dosage and provision of services
can be strictly controlled.

Hoge et al.51 recently deﬁned changes in blood levels of
cortisol, ACTH, IL-6, and TNF-a following mindfulness
meditation in adults with generalized anxiety disorder
(GAD). The most sensitive indicators appeared to be
ACTH and IL-6, after use of the Trier Social Stress Test to
induce an acute stress response. This study provided direct
evidence that biological substrates of stress responses may
be altered in response to a mindfulness-based therapy
intervention. MBSR attenuated stress hormone and inﬂam-
matory marker responses to stress in patients with GAD.
An additional study from the same group suggested that
mindfulness-induced improvements in anxiety may be
mediated primarily through a practice called decentering.52
Decentering is an ability to recognize that thoughts, feel-
ings, and urges are transient internal events and not inher-
ent, permanent aspects of the self or accurate depictions of
reality. Investigation of underlying neural mechanisms of
an MBSR-intervention in patients with GAD using func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)53 revealed that
at baseline, GAD patients exhibited enhanced amygdala
activation than did controls in response to neutral faces;
thus, ambiguous stimuli produced stronger reactions in
patients with the anxiety disorder. In GAD patients, amyg-
dala activation to neutral faces decreased following MBSR
and activation in the prefrontal cortex increased. Changes
in amygdala-to-prefrontal functional connectivity were cor-
related with changes in self-reported anxiety, and interest-
ingly, amygdala-to-prefrontal connectivity changed from
negative coupling (typically seen as part of emotional

124 Experimental Biology and Medicine Volume 245 January 2020
...............................................................................................................................................................

down-regulation), to positive coupling. These data suggest
a potential neuronal mechanism by which mindfulness can
regulate brain circuit activation and processing.

A more speciﬁc approach is termed mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy (MBCT).54,55 MBCT follows the same
eight-week group therapy structure as MBSR and is made
up of similar content. It employs the tenets of mindfulness
and CBT to address speciﬁc symptoms and patterns of neg-
ative thinking associated with major depressive disorder
(MDD).56 In systematic reviews of MBCT for MDD and
associated depressive outcomes,57 and MBSR compared
to MBCT,58 there is strong evidence that ameliorations in
emotional reactivity and cognitive augmentation contribute
to the underlying mechanisms of these mindfulness-based
interventions. There are also indications that they may have
predicting or mediating roles in things like rumination,
worry, mindfulness, compassion, and meta-awareness.
However, as with most research of psychological interven-
tions, there are some inconsistencies in the theoretical
frameworks between researchers, and strong conclusions
regarding the mechanisms at play are still elusive.

Yet another variant of a mindfulness intervention is
termed integrative body-mind training (IBMT), and this
approach focuses on integrative central and autonomic ner-
vous system training through body relaxation, mental
imagery, mindfulness training, and music. Studies suggest
that IBMT can improve emotion regulation,59,60 improve
cognitive control,59,60 reduce salivary cortisol,61 and alter
brain structure and function.59,62–64 In one particularly
interesting study, investigators found improved emotion
regulation, self-control, and stress reduction after IBMT
training; these improvements correlated with augmented
activity in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices fol-
lowing training.59 People who smoke exhibited diminished
prefrontal cortical activity in the network ahead of training
(as compared to nonsmoking participants), and training
this
ameliorated these deﬁcits, demonstrating that
approach may be useful in the treatment and prevention
of drug addiction.

Art therapy is a mental health service that integrates crea-
tive processes with traditional talk therapy.65 It has been
used in a variety of settings, with individual, family, and
group therapies, to address multiple mental health chal-
lenges.66,67 One of the advantages of art therapy is that it
provides a mode of communication that can be less intim-
idating
communication.
Additionally, the creative process and art materials may
contain intrinsic therapeutic properties that may be a valu-
able asset to mental health services. As with the mindful-
ness interventions described above, with brain imaging
technologies and unobtrusive tests of biological markers,
there are emerging data that support art playing an active
and effective role in stress management and addressing
symptoms of anxiety.

For example, Kaimal et al.68 gave 39 healthy individuals
the choice of collage materials, modeling clay, and/or
markers for a brief art-making session. Most participants

had a small but signiﬁcant decrease in salivary cortisol
levels after art making. Although the extent of the changes
were widely varied between individuals—the source of this
likely complex heterogeneity in responses was unclear,
despite the authors fairly detailed analysis of prior experi-
ence with art, art materials used, gender, ethnicity, and age.
In a more recent study, the same research group69 looked at
blood ﬂow in the medial prefrontal cortex. Participants
were asked to complete three visual self-expression tasks
including coloring a pre-drawn mandala, personalized
doodling, and free drawing on a blank sheet of paper.
Data on cerebral blood ﬂow in the brain were collected
for each task, in addition to resting periods in between.
All of the tasks produced activation of prefrontal cortical
regions, with no statistically signiﬁcant difference among
tasks. They also included a self-report measure regarding
self-perception of creativity, which increased for all partic-
ipants at the end of the session. Building healthy habits
typically requires practice and positive reinforcement.
The activation of this pathway during art making suggests
that practicing art making can have lasting beneﬁts in
healthy habit building that combats stress.

Another intriguing study compared clay work to draw-
ing.70 Electroencephalograms were used to monitor brain
activity patterns in healthy female participants engaged in
the two different art tasks; the study found that both draw-
ing and clay sculpting increased gamma power, which is
associated with information-rich task processing, but only
clay sculpting resulted in increased theta power. Theta
waves are associated with deep meditative states, imagina-
tion, and internal focus.71 These ﬁndings suggest that clay
carries intrinsic therapeutic properties that may comple-
ment mindfulness, as the act of clay sculpting alone
appears to be able to induce relaxation and even a medita-
tive state. We note, however, that the study of Kaimal did
not observe any effects of art media choice on cortisol
levels.68

Art therapy and mindfulness practices have comple-
mentary effects on neurological and biological processes
as well as mental health. MBSR protocols are integrated
with art therapy prompts and art making in order to per-
form MBAT; in other words, MBAT typically combines the
MBSR protocol with complementary art therapy direc-
tives.72 MBAT has been examined using randomized con-
trolled trials, typically for severe illness management like
cancer73–78 and coronary artery disease.79 Monti et al.73
used fMRI and successfully correlated brain activation
responses to stress and anxiety measures with engagement
in their MBAT regimen. MBAT-receiving participants
showed increases in blood ﬂow in several limbic brain
regions, including the insular cortex, amygdala, hippocam-
pus, and the striatum. These changes occurred both at rest
and during meditation. Moreover, reactions to a stressor
involved decreased activation of the cingulate cortex in
MBAT-receiving participants, demonstrating regulation of
a speciﬁc neural circuit—one that is already known to be
involved in stress responses and anxiety regulation25,80—

healthy college students receiving MBAT.81 The most typi-
cal MBAT protocol consists of 2-h sessions weekly for eight-
weeks72—this is more time- and cost-intensive than even
CBT. Validation of more abbreviated and efﬁcient MBAT
approaches is crucial in determining whether this thera-
peutic approach can be effective in large-scale deploy-
ments. Thus, rather than following the standardized
eight-week protocol, ours utilizes one initial in-person facil-
itated session, eight 15-min easily reproducible, clay-based
MBAT directives, administered through an online platform,
and then one ﬁnal in person session (Figure 1). Although
our initial proof-of-concept study was small, a follow-up
study of 77 participants demonstrated positive effects on
both anxiety and perceived stress (Beerse, Van Lith and
Stanwood, unpublished data). Therefore, it appears that
MBAT has the capacity to improve mind and body out-
comes by concurrently activating and reorganizing behav-
ioral, neurobiological, and neuroendocrine processes while
supporting the healthy development of social and emotion-
al processes. The fundamental science underlying MBAT—
and a mechanistic understanding of its endocrine and
neural mechanisms—will potentially lead to a novel biobe-
havioral approach to help reduce the burden of anxiety
symptoms, anxiety disorders, and protect against chronic
daily stress. Our utilization of a web-based application
offers a feasible strategy for increasing access to mental
health services while circumnavigating the issue of
stigma that still surrounds mental health. This may be espe-
cially true for those who are wary of traditional services
and for those who feel their symptoms are distressing but

not yet dysfunctional. Mental health apps are increasing in
popularity, but few have been rigorously studied,82–84 and
most rely on self-report measures,85 failing to investigate
the biobehavioral implications. Ours appears to represent
the ﬁrst project adapting a systemized MBAT intervention
to an electronic delivery system that can be up-scaled
quickly and efﬁciently.

Future directions

The neural basis of the nature and beneﬁts of mindfulness,
and especially MBAT speciﬁcally, is still in its early days.
Nonetheless, a good deal of data have been already gener-
ated, and published work in this area is growing very rap-
idly. It is important to assess what has been learned to date
improve experimental designs and
and to further
approaches. There is a need for more rigorous and trans-
parent studies, delineation of subpopulations of individu-
als showing differing responsiveness to the interventions,
and a more complete understanding of the host of neuro-
endocrine, behavioral, and neural changes that mediate
therapeutic success. These behavioral approaches have
great promise in the treatment of complex mental health
conditions, but additional science is needed to discern
how to best deploy them. As described in a recent meta-
analysis,44 there is a lack of consistency across studies in
type of mindfulness intervention and control conditions
used in studies. Furthermore, few studies include sub-
group analyses and the ﬁeld needs to do better. With
regard to MBAT speciﬁcally, to our knowledge, only one

patterns,73 and that was in only 18 patients with brain
cancer (of course, many others—some cited above in this
article—have used functional neuroimaging to better
understand meditation and mindfulness themselves).
Comprehensive identiﬁcation of the neuroprotective cir-
cuits recruited by MBAT interventions and resultant mod-
iﬁcations of stress hormone and metabolic signaling
pathways are sorely needed. In Figure 2, we present a

potential conceptual framework that may be of utility in
this effort.

Cognitive and emotion regulation mechanisms in the
brain are often discussed as being based in “top-down”
or “bottom-up” in nature. Quite simply, top down process-
ing refers to processing based on what is already in the
mind or highest levels of the brain. In contrast, bottom up
processing refers to processing based on what is in the

stimulus array reaching sensory organs. Some authors have
suggested that mindfulness is a top-down strategy to reg-
ulate emotion, while other groups propose that mindful-
ness
are
produced in part from the distinct deﬁnitions, descriptions,
and uses of mindfulness. One suggestion is that mindful-
ness training produces top-down emotional regulation in
the beginning, but with practice and time, recruits bottom-
up neural mechanisms in longer-term, expert practi-
tioners/users.86 However, this has yet to be fully tested or
established. The particularly effectiveness of MBAT might
also be based on a more uniﬁed joint processing from both
directions, given the direct engagement of art materials and
art-making with one’s sensory organs. Directed study of
these possibilities is warranted.

The reciprocal relationship between anxiety, stress, and
sleep disruption should be addressed in future treatment
research designs of MBAT. It is commonly known that anx-
iety and stress, characterized by cognitive difﬁculty and
emotional reactivity, are also associated with sleep disrup-
tion and the development of insomnia.90–97 Several etiolog-
ical models have highlighted shared mechanisms between
anxiety, stress, and sleep disruption that may explain the
reciprocal risk and high comorbidity.91,98–100 Speciﬁcally,
cognitive and emotional arousal, sleep-stress reactivity,
and emotion regulation mechanisms, including mindful-
ness, may all play an important role.101–106 Mindfulness-
based treatments, as discussed previously, are effective
for the reduction of stress and anxiety symptoms and, inter-
estingly, are effective for improvements in sleep disruption
and insomnia.107–109 However, improvements in sleep dis-
ruption as a result of MBAT have not been examined.

MBAT treatment research designs for anxiety and stress
would add to the growing evidence concluding that
mindfulness-based treatments are effective for promoting
healthy sleep, and potentially conﬁrm that targeting shared
mechanisms in treatment can improve anxiety, stress, and
sleep difﬁculties simultaneously (Figure 2).

there has since been an appeal

Even though the American Psychiatric Association reor-
ganized the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) away from a multi-
axial system,
for a
symptom-based approach to mental health research
rather than based on diagnosis.110 A symptom-based
approach acknowledges that most mental disorder diagno-
ses are not rooted in neurobiological evidence, but rather
supported by neurobiological research ex post facto. In this
approach, research cohorts are organized by their predom-
inant symptoms and complaints. With MBAT research still
in its infancy, there is an opportunity to collect data in a
symptom-based approach that withstands the evolution of
diagnostic criteria relating to anxiety disorders as well as
mood disorders. Instead, researchers can determine how
MBAT interventions interact with a variety of somatic
symptoms that are often associated with anxiety and
stress,
such as migraines, gastrointestinal problems,
muscle pain or spasms, fatigue, and sleep disruptions.
Additionally, research cohorts could be organized by
group characteristics. For instance, a recent review has

that
mindfulness-based programs can decrease psychological
stress during pregnancy and improve maternal mental
health.111 Similarly, cohorts could be organized by other
characteristics like unique cultural groups or individuals
within a set geographical location which could all provide
insight into the more nuanced variables that interact with
mental health research.

While variables on the receiving end can be strategically
organized, so, too, can the intervention strategy be manip-
ulated to better understand the mechanisms at play. The
MBAT protocol and delivery strategy could be altered to
determine whether a face-to-face intervention would elicit
stronger positive outcomes than an electronically delivered
intervention. Recipients of MBAT could also be divided into
individual or group therapy structures, since MBSR
emphasizes the importance of using a group therapy
format. Lastly, MBAT is fundamentally unique in the
realm of mental health approaches due to the valuable
role art materials and the creative process hold. Even
subtle manipulations in art-making instruction and mate-
rial can further breakdown the mechanisms underlying this
intervention.
