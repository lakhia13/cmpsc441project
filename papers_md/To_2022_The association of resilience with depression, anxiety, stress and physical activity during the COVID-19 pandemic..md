Abstract 
Background:  COVID-19 has resulted in substantial global upheaval. Resilience is important in protecting wellbe-
ing, however few studies have investigated changes in resilience over time, and associations between resilience with 
depression, anxiety, stress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods:  Online surveys were conducted to collect both longitudinal and cross-sectional data at three time points 
during 2020. Australian adults aged 18 years and over were invited to complete the online surveys. Measures include 
the six-item Brief Resilience Scale, the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and the Active Australia Survey 
which have eight items identifying the duration and frequency of walking, and moderate and vigorous physical activi-
ties (MVPA), over the past 7 days. General linear mixed models and general linear models were used in the analysis.

Results:  In the longitudinal sample, adjusted differences (aDif ) in resilience scores did not significantly change over 
time (time 2 vs. time 1 [aDif 
 0.02, 95% CI 
0.06]). On average, those engaging in at least 150 min of MVPA per week (aDif

sectional sample.

Conclusions:  Resilience scores did not change significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were 
significant associations between resilience with physical activity and psychological distress. This research helps inform 
future interventions to enhance or nurture resilience, particularly targeted at people identified as at risk of psychologi-
cal distress.

Background
Initially reported in November 2019, the novel corona-
virus  (COVID-19)  has  infected  more  than  244  million 
people  worldwide,  with  more  than  4.9  million  deaths 
(25  October  2021)  [1].  In  addition  to  causing  a  global 
health  emergency,  there  has  been  subsequent  social 
and  economic  repercussions  on  the  world’s  popula-
tion due to government-imposed restrictions to protect

public  health  [2].  How  people  respond  to  a  persistent 
stressor,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  may  vary 
based  on  individual  resilience  levels  [3],  which  can  be 
defined  as  “the  process  involving  an  ability  to  with-
stand and cope with ongoing or repeated demands and 
maintain  healthy  functioning  in  different  domains  of 
life such as work and family”(p.637) [4]. Understanding 
resilience  and  how  it  changes  across  time  may  help  in 
designing  interventions  that  aim  to  minimise  psycho-
logical distress.

Few  studies  have  examined  changes  in  resilience  dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. Sturman (2020) compared 
levels of resilience in the United States prior to the dec-
laration of a global pandemic (November and December 
2019), to levels in the early stages of the pandemic (mid-
April  2020),  and  found  no  significant  change  over  time 
[5].  Similarly,  Kim  et  al.  (2020)  found  no  significant  dif-
ferences  in  resilience  of  Israeli  adults  between  the  peak 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Government-enforced 
restrictions were imposed, and 2 months later when the 
restrictions  had  been  lifted  [6].  However,  a  USA  study 
found that resilience in the third week of COVID-19 stay-
at-home  restrictions  (April  2020)  were  lower  compared 
to  normative  data  collected  before  the  pandemic  [7]. 
Additionally, we could not identify any studies examining 
longitudinal changes in resilience in Australian adults.

Resilience  is  an  important  protective  factor  against 
psychological  distress.  A  systematic  review  and  meta-
analysis  found  that  older  adults  with  higher  resilience 
were  less  likely  to  have  depressive  symptoms  [8];  how-
ever, no Australian studies were included. To our knowl-
edge,  only  two  studies  of  resilience  and  depression  have 
been undertaken in Australia. One study among Iranian 
immigrants living in Australia found lower levels of resil-
ience  associated  with  higher  levels  of  depression  [9].  In 
contrast, another study found no significant associations 
between resilience and depression among homeless peo-
ple  in  regional  Australia  [10].  The  association  between 
resilience  and  anxiety  was  also  investigated  in  another 
study that found higher levels of resilience was associated 
with  less  anxiety  among  Australians  aged  55–90 years 
[11].  Additionally,  several  pilot  interventions  that  aimed 
to  improve  participants’  resilience  through  education 
workshops  appeared  to  have  positive  effects  in  mitigat-
ing  workplace  stress  among  Australian  nurses  [12–14]. 
However,  these  previous  studies  are  limited  by  their 
cross-sectional design or were not conducted among the 
general  population.  A  more  recent  study  of  Australian 
parents reported loneliness as a significant contributor to 
stress during the pandemic, however high levels of social 
support were associated with both lower stress and anxi-
ety  [15].  Healthcare  professionals  are  also  predisposed 
to  significant  distress  and  anxiety,  despite  high  levels  of 

resilience,  suggesting  resilience  alone  is  insufficient  as  a 
protective toll against poor mental health [16].

Physical activity is an important health behaviour that 
benefits  both  physical  and  mental  health  [17].  Studies 
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic consistently 
show strong positive associations between resilience and 
physical activity levels [7, 18, 19]. One possible underly-
ing  mechanism  for  this  association  could  be  due  to  the 
positive effect of physical activity on mental health [20]. 
However,  whether  physical  activity  is  associated  with 
resilience,  independent  of  mental  health  status,  has  not 
been  investigated  in  these  cross-sectional  studies.  Fur-
thermore, to our knowledge, no Australian study of these 
relationships has been found.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate: 1) changes in 
the  resilience  level  of  Australian  adults  over  time  dur-
ing the pandemic; and 2) associations between resilience 
with  depression,  anxiety,  stress,  and  physical  activity. 
Findings  from  this  study  contribute  important  insights 
into  the  role  of  resilience  for  physical  activity  behaviour 
and psychological distress among Australian adults dur-
ing the pandemic.

Methods
Study design and participants

Online surveys were conducted to collect both longitudi-
nal and cross-sectional data at three time points. The first 
survey  was  conducted  early  on  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic from 9th to 19th April 2020; the second from 
30th July to 16th August 2020; and the third between 1st 
and  25th  December  2020.  During  the  first  time  point, 
Australian state governments had adopted extraordinary 
measures to reduce the rates of infection including social 
distancing, lockdowns, and travel restrictions. During the 
second  time  point,  all  Australian  states  except  Victoria 
had  relaxed  restrictions  due  to  low  case  numbers  of  the 
infection. At the time of the third survey, most COVID-
19 restrictions were lifted in all States and Territories as 
the rates of infection were largely under control [21, 22].

At  each  survey,  participants  (including  new  partici-
pants  recruited  for  survey  2)  were  asked  if  they  would 
like to participate in future data collection opportunities. 
Those  completing  at  least  two  surveys  became  part  of  a 
longitudinal cohort while those who elected to complete 
only  one  survey  formed  the  cross-sectional  cohort.  The 
surveys  were  anonymous  and  hosted  on  the  Qualtrics 
survey platform. Australian adults aged 18 years and over 
were invited to complete the surveys using paid Facebook 
advertising,  social  media  (e.g.,  Twitter)  and  institutional 
sources  including  email  lists.  Online  informed  consent 
was  provided  by  all  participants  after  they  had  read  the 
information sheet that outlined the nature of their partic-
ipation,  the  risks  and  benefits  of  participation,  and  how

the data would be used. Ethical approval was granted by 
Central Queensland University’s Human Research Ethics 
Committee (Approval number 22332).

Measures

Demographic  characteristics 
included  age  (years), 
gender,  years  of  schooling,  weekly  household  income 
(< 1000 AUD, 1000 - < 2000 AUD, or ≥ 2000 AUD), and 
marital  status  (in  a  relationship  or  not).  Chronic  dis-
ease status (Yes/No) was identified using the question; 
“Have  you  ever  been  told  by  a  doctor  that  you  have 
any  chronic  health  problems?”.  These  included  one  or 
a  combination  of  heart  disease,  high  blood  pressure, 
stroke,  cancer,  depressive  disorder,  anxiety  disorder, 
psychotic  illness,  bipolar  disorder,  diabetes,  arthritis, 
chronic  back/neck  pain,  asthma,  COPD,  and  chronic 
kidney/renal diseases [23].

Resilience  was  assessed  using  the  six-item  Brief  Resil-
ience Scale (BRS). The BRS measures an individuals’ abil-
ity to bounce back from an adverse event and focuses on 
the ability to recover [24]. The BRS is a reliable measure 
of  resilience,  with  Cronbach’s  alpha  ranging  from  0.80 
to 0.91 and a 1 month test-retest reliability (ICC) of 0.69 
[24]. The BRS is comprised of six items with three posi-
tively  worded  items  (1,  3,  and  5)  and  negatively  worded 
items  (2,  4,  and  6).  For  example,  a  positive  item  states 
“I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times” while a 
negative item states “I have a hard time making it through 
stressful  events”.  Responses  were  provided  on  a  5-point 
Likert  scale  with  anchors  at  1  (strongly  disagree)  and  5 
(strongly agree). The scale was scored by reverse coding 
the negative items and then averaging the total score for 
the six items. Final scores range from 1.0–5.0 with a score 
of 3.0–4.3 considered a normal level of resilience [25].

Psychological distress was measured using the 21-item 
Depression,  Anxiety  and  Stress  Scale  (DASS-21)  [26]. 
The  DASS-21  has  shown  acceptable  construct  validity 
and  high  reliability  (Cronbach’s  alphas  were  0.88,  0.82 
and  0.90  for  depression,  anxiety  and  stress  respectively) 
in a non-clinical adult population [27]. Each domain has 
seven  items  scored  on  a  4-point  Likert  scale  between 
0  (did  not  apply  to  me  at  all)  and  3  (applied  to  me  very 
much,  or  most  of  the  time).  Example  items  were  “I  was 
aware  of  dryness  of  my  mouth”  or  “I  found  myself  get-
ting  agitated”.  A  score  was  calculated  for  each  domain 
by adding the scores for the relevant items and multiply-
ing by two. Standard cut-points were used to determine 
whether  participants  had  symptom  severity  above  nor-
mal for depression (≥10 points), anxiety (≥8 points), and 
stress (≥15 points) [26].

Physical activity was assessed using the Active Australia 
Survey  (AAS),  which  comprises  eight  items  identifying 
the duration and frequency of walking, and moderate and 

vigorous (MVPA) physical activities, over the past 7 days. 
For  example,  questions  about  walking  are  “In  the  last 
week, how many times have you walked continuously, for 
at least 10 minutes, for recreation, exercise or to get to or 
from  places?”  and  “What  do  you  estimate  was  the  total 
time that you spent walking in this way in the last week?”. 
The AAS guidelines were used to calculate total physical 
activity by summing minutes of walking, minutes of mod-
erate  activity,  and  minutes  of  vigorous  activity  (multi-
plied by 2). Participants were then categorised as meeting 
the  physical  activity  guidelines  (≥150 min  of  moderate 
–  vigorous  (MVPA)  per  week)  or  not  (< 150 min  MVPA 
per week) [28]. The AAS criterion validity has been found 
to be acceptable for use in self-administered format, with 
correlations  between  self-reported  physical  activity  and 
weekly  pedometer  steps,  and  accelerometry  being  0.43 
and 0.52 respectively [29].

Analyses

Statistical  analysis  was  undertaken  using  SAS  software 
v9.4.  Two  datasets,  longitudinal  and  repeated  cross-sec-
tional, were analysed separately. Participants completing 
at  least  two  surveys  were  included  in  the  longitudinal 
dataset.  The  repeated  cross-sectional  dataset  excluded 
those  in  the  longitudinal  dataset  and  therefore  included 
only  those  completing  one  survey.  Descriptive  statistics 
(mean,  standard  deviation,  and  percentages)  were  cal-
culated  and  are  presented  for  each  time  point.  Changes 
in  resilience  scores  were  examined  using  general  linear 
mixed models for the longitudinal data, and general lin-
ear models for cross-sectional data. In addition to bivari-
ate analyses, estimated changes in resilience scores were 
also adjusted for age, gender, years of  education, weekly 
household  income,  relationship  status,  and  chronic  dis-
ease status. Multiple comparison correction was applied 
using the simulation option in PROC GLIMMIX.

Associations  between  resilience  scores  with  physi-
cal activity and depression, anxiety, and stress were also 
examined using general linear mixed models for the lon-
gitudinal  data  and  general  linear  models  for  the  cross-
sectional data. Three models were run for both datasets. 
Model  1  included  resilience  scores,  time  and  either 
physical  activity,  depression,  anxiety,  or  stress.  Model  2 
included  the  additional  covariates:  age,  gender,  years  of 
education,  weekly  household  income,  relationship  sta-
tus, and chronic disease status. To examine whether the 
observed  associations  were  independent,  physical  activ-
ity,  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  were  also  included  in 
Model 3 together with time and all other covariates.

Due  to  missing  values  for  the  household  income  vari-
able  being  higher  than  10%,  analyses  were  conducted 
with  and  without  household  income  as  a  covariate.  As 
the  results  between  these  two  analyses  did  not  change 

 To et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:491 

Page 4 of 8

the  findings,  only  models  including  household  income 
are  presented.  Crude  and  adjusted  differences  in  resil-
ience scores with 95% confidence intervals are reported. 
All p-values were two sided and considered significant if 
< 0.05.

Results
Table 1 shows characteristics of the longitudinal sample. 
At  baseline,  the  majority  of  respondents  were  women 
(68.7%)  and  in  a  relationship  (64.6%),  with  almost  half 
reporting a chronic disease (47.5%). On average, partici-
pants  were  52.5  (SD = 14.3)  years  old  and  had  about  16 
(SD = 4.7)  years  of  education.  Most  had  scores  within 
the normal range for depression (64.0%), anxiety (80.7%), 
and stress (72.9%). More than half met the physical activ-
ity guidelines (56.4%). Average resilience score was about 
3.4 out of 5.0 and within the normal range (3.0–4.3). The 
characteristics  of  those  in  the  cross-sectional  sample 
were very similar (Table 2).

Table  3  shows  changes  in  resilience  scores  over  time. 
In the longitudinal sample, crude (Model 1) and adjusted 
differences (aDif ) (Model 2) in resilience scores were not 
significant between time 2 vs. time 1 (aDif = − 0.02, 95% 
CI = − 0.08,  0.03),  and  time  3  vs.  time  1  (aDif = < 0.01, 
95%  CI = − 0.07,  0.06).  Similarly,  in  the  cross-sectional 
sample,  crude  and  adjusted  differences  in  resilience 
scores  were  not  significant  between  time  2  vs.  time  1 
(aDif = − 0.04, 95% CI = − 0.14, 0.07), and time 3 vs. time 
1 (aDif = − 0.02, 95% CI = − 0.15, 0.11).

Table  4  shows  associations  between  resilience 
scores  with  physical  activity,  depression,  anxiety,  and 
stress.  On  average,  those  engaging  in  at  least  150 min 
of  MVPA  per  week  had  a  significantly  higher  resil-
ience  score  (Model  2)  in  the  longitudinal  (aDif = 0.10, 
95%  CI = 0.04,  0.16)  and  cross-sectional  samples 
(aDif = 0.19,  95%  CI = 0.11,  0.27).  Resilience  scores 
were  also  significantly  higher  for  those  with  depres-
sion  scores  in  the  normal  range  (longitudinal  sample:

Discussion
This  study  aimed  to  investigate  changes  in  resilience  of 
Australian adults across three time points in 2020 during 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  the  associations  between 
resilience  and  physical  activity,  depression,  anxiety,  and 
stress.  The  findings  show  that  resilience  scores  did  not 
change  significantly  during  the  pandemic  and  that  par-
ticipants  who  engaged  in  at  least  150  MVPA  minutes 
per week, and with depression, anxiety, and stress scores 
within  the  normal  range,  had  higher  resilience  scores. 
The  findings  were  consistent  between  the  longitudinal 
and  cross-sectional  datasets;  however,  the  effects  were 
larger in the cross-sectional data.

Given  the  extraordinary  social  circumstances  brought 
about by Australian state governments to enforce move-
ment  restrictions  in  response  to  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic,  and  the  uncertainty  as  a  result  of  the  health  and 
economic  impact  of  the  pandemic,  resilience  levels  may 
have changed. However, the results from this study sug-
gest  that  resilience  levels  largely  remained  stable  during 
the  pandemic,  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  from 
a  study  in  Israel  [6].  This  is  likely  due  to  the  samples 
(both longitudinal  and  cross-sectional)  including mostly 
Australian  adults  (about  three  quarters)  with  high  or 
normal  levels  of  resilience.  Therefore,  they  may  manage 
and  adapt  well  to  the  impacts  caused  by  the  pandemic. 
Another  factor  may  be  that  the  Australian  government 
was  effective  in  responding  to  the  pandemic  (ranking 
3rd  among  OECD  countries)  and  providing  Australians 
with  financial  support  and  mental  health  consultation 
via telehealth [30], and therefore helping to alleviate the 
impacts.  It  is  less  likely,  but  also  possible,  that  levels  of 
resilience  may  have  decreased  between  pre-COVID-19 
and  our  first  survey.  Unfortunately,  pre-COVID-19  data 

are  not  available  for  comparison.  However,  one  study 
comparing two cross-sectional samples in small towns in 
upstate New York found no significant difference in resil-
ience between pre-COVID-19 (November and December 
2019) and peak-COVID-19 (mid-April 2020) [5].

Our  findings  are  consistent  with  previous  studies  that 
have  found  inverse  associations  between  levels  of  resil-
ience  and  psychological  distress  among  patients  with 
chronic diseases [31–33], and medical students [34, 35]. 
This finding is also consistent with those from other stud-
ies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S 
[36, 37] and Italy [38]. These associations were expected, 
as  resilience  reflects  an  individual’s  ability  to  cope  with 
life’s  adversity,  trauma,  and  threats;  and  therefore,  plays 
a role as an adaptive defence system against psychologi-
cal  distress  such  as  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  [39]. 
Given  their  significant  effects  on  resilience,  depression, 
anxiety,  and  stress  are  important  factors  that  should  be 
considered in interventions to improve resilience level in 
adult populations.

Resilience  was  also  found  to  be  positively  associ-
ated  with  physical  activity  levels  in  studies  conducted 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  is  consistent 
with findings in the present study [7, 18, 19]. The posi-
tive effects of physical activity on resilience may occur 
through  improving  mental  health  and  possible  under-
lying mechanisms for this were discussed by Silverman 
et  al.  (2014)  [20].  For  example,  physical  activity  could 
serve  as  a  buffer  against  stress  and  stress-related  dis-
orders.  Physical  activity  also  has  benefits  on  brain  and 
hormonal stress-responsive systems that could improve 
mood  and  cognition  [20,  40].  In  this  study,  we  found 
that  physical  activity  was  associated  with  resilience, 
independent  of  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  levels.

Although  the  effect  size  of  physical  activity  (adjusted 
difference  of  0.07  points)  was  small  compared  to  that 
of  depression  (0.30  points),  anxiety  (0.19  points),  and 
stress  (0.12  points).  Given  that  physical  activity  has 
other benefits on both physical and mental health [17], 
it is still an important factor for consideration in inter-
ventions targeting resilience levels.

There are a number of strengths in this study. First, the 
sample size is large with participants from all states and 
territories in Australia. Second, to the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first longitudinal study to explore levels of 
resilience  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  Australia. 
However,  the  study  has  limitations.  Participation  in  this 
study  was  voluntary  with  nearly  half  of  the  sample  hav-
ing  at  least  one  chronic  health  condition  and  therefore, 
the findings may not be generalisable to populations with 
different characteristics. The self-reported questionnaires 
are  also  subject  to  recall  bias,  despite  being  validated 
instruments.  In  addition,  the  first  survey  started  when 
the pandemic had already begun; and no pre-COVID-19 
data  was  available.  Therefore,  it  is  not  possible  to  know 
whether (and how) resilience scores changed between the 
pre-COVID-19 period and the first survey.

For  the  future,  the  findings  from  this  study  helps 
inform  interventions  that  aim  to  enhance  or  nurture 
resilience. In particular, health promotion strategies that 
screen for, then target people identified as being at risk of 
psychological distress, those with low levels of resilience, 
or those not meeting the physical activity guidelines may 
maximize the effects of the interventions. Primary health 
care  providers,  Government  websites,  not-for-profit,  or 
other mental health services could provide rapid screen-
ing then direct people to appropriate care.

Conclusions
Resilience scores did not change significantly during the 
COVID-19  pandemic.  Participants  who  met  the  physi-
cal activity guidelines, had depression, anxiety, and stress 
scores  within  the  normal  range,  had  higher  resilience 
scores compared to those who were less active and those 
with  more  psychological  distress.  Maintaining  healthy 
behaviours  such  as  regular  physical  activity  may  buffer 
the  adverse  psychological  effect  of  the  pandemic  and 
maintain mental health and wellbeing.
