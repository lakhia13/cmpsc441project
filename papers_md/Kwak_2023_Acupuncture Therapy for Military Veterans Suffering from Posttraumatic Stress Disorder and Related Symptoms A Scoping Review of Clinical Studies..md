Abstract: Military personnel in combat face a high risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). In this study, a protocol-based scoping review was conducted to identify the current status
of research on the efﬁcacy of acupuncture for treating combat-related PTSD in military personnel.
A literature search was conducted across 14 databases in November 2022, and data from the in-
cluded studies were collected and descriptively analyzed. A total of eight studies were included.
Participants were assessed for core PTSD symptoms using the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, as well as
related symptoms, such as sleep issues. Although the efﬁcacy of acupuncture has been substantiated
in numerous studies, certain metrics did not exhibit improvement. Auricular acupuncture was the
most commonly used treatment (50%) followed by manual acupuncture (25%) and a combination
of both (25%). Shenmen and Kidney points were frequently targeted at auricular acupoints. The
treatment period varied between 5 days and 2 months. While adverse events were reported in two of
the ﬁfty-ﬁve patients in the intervention group and in four of the sixty-four patients in the control
group in the randomized controlled trial studies, no fatal adverse events were reported.

1. Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is diagnosed when an individual who has in
various ways been exposed to a severely threatening event displays a series of reactions
and symptoms that persist for more than one month [1]. Military personnel who participate
in combat are exposed to very threatening environments; thus, a high prevalence of PTSD
is observed. Combat-exposed veterans have a notably high prevalence of PTSD, with a
lifetime prevalence of 7.7% and 13.4% in males and females, respectively [2]. It is estimated
that 10.1% [3] of Gulf War veterans and 15.8% [4] of Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans have PTSD.

Following deployment, veterans and active-duty military personnels with PTSD face
numerous challenges, including reintegration into society and occupational difﬁculties.
Studies have demonstrated that patients with PTSD have more signiﬁcant challenges in
regulating their emotions; moreover, a higher incidence of depression is observed in veter-
ans with PTSD than those exposed to combat experiences without PTSD [5]. Furthermore,
veterans with PTSD frequently report increased alcohol consumption, which can lead
to alcohol use disorder [6]. Additionally, PTSD negatively affects familial relationships.
Studies have revealed that as the severity of PTSD symptoms in veterans increases, parental
functioning and marital adjustment decrease [7].

Currently, psychological treatments, such as prolonged exposure, cognitive processing,
and cognitive behavioral therapies, are strongly recommended for treating PTSD [8]. Nev-
ertheless, the stigma associated with mental illness among military personnel can hinder
their willingness to seek psychological help [9], potentially creating a barrier to accessing
mental health care [10]. Negative attitudes toward psychotherapy can also contribute to
treatment dropout [11].

While psychotherapy, which is considered the gold standard for PTSD, receives the
highest level of recommendations [12], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are
considered the most effective pharmacological treatment [13]. However, long-term admin-
istration of SSRIs can have numerous side effects, such as hyponatremia, genitourinary
problems, hepatotoxicity, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems, and
central nervous system problems [14]. Withdrawal syndrome has also been reported after
discontinuing the use of SSRIs [15].

Acupuncture, a non-pharmacological intervention that originates in the East and
involves the insertion and manipulation of needles at the acupoint, has gained increasing
attention. Most acupoints are effective as they belong to the meridian associated with each
functional system of the human body [16], and practitioners take this into consideration
when formulating acupuncture prescriptions. Recently, research has shown that acupunc-
ture point stimulation has a signiﬁcant effect on the central nervous system, including
the limbic system and subcortical grey structures [17]. Preclinical animal studies utilizing
acupuncture to treat animal models of PTSD have shown promising results, including
improvements in anxiety, fear, sleep disturbances, cognitive symptoms, and depression [18].
Acupuncture is now classiﬁed as a non-pharmacological and non-psychological treatment
option for PTSD [19]. A recent meta-analysis reported that acupuncture signiﬁcantly im-
proved PTSD and depressive symptoms, with effects lasting throughout the follow-up
period [20].

Auricular acupuncture, in particular, has been widely disseminated through the use
of speciﬁc manuals, such as the Battleﬁeld Acupuncture (BFA) and National Acupuncture
Detoxiﬁcation Association (NADA) protocols. These protocols have been developed and
applied in pain management [21] and addiction treatment [22]. BFA is speciﬁcally designed
for the simple treatment of various types of pain in veterans [23] and active-duty military
personnel [24], making it an efﬁcient option on the battleﬁeld. Auricular acupuncture,
which has been used in various disaster and combat settings, has been shown to improve
the symptoms of moderate PTSD [25].

Despite the considerable efﬁcacy of acupuncture in the treatment of PTSD in military
medicine, as described above, no systematic or scoping review of acupuncture studies on
PTSD occurring during combat in military personnel has been published. A scoping review
is a methodology used to identify certain characteristics or concepts of studies and conduct
mapping and discussion about these characteristics or concepts, rather than presenting
answers to speciﬁc questions, whereas a systematic review is structured to ﬁnd answers to
sophisticated clinical questions. A scoping review is often considered a preliminary step
for identifying questions suitable for a systematic review [26]. In the present context, our
understanding of the application of acupuncture in veterans with PTSD is limited. Instead
of having a clear clinical question, we recognize the need to comprehend the current state
of research by collecting and reconstructing overall knowledge.

In this paper, we thoroughly examined the clinical research design and methodological
characteristics of acupuncture, such as the characteristics of research participants, studied
outcomes, and treatment regimens. In this study, we aimed to identify existing research
gaps and the need for additional research and to extract appropriate clinical questions for a
systematic review to be conducted in the future.

2. Materials and Methods

Study Design and Registration
This study employed the scoping review process outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [27]
and other relevant sources [28,29]. The scoping review protocol adhered to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extensions for
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-Scr) criteria. The review protocol was registered with the
Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/t723f/, accessed on 13 June 2022) to ensure
transparency on 13 June 2022, and updated on 2 November 2022. The protocol article [30],
which described the research strategy for this scoping review, was released in January 2023
and provided a detailed explanation of the research techniques used in the study.

Stage 1: Identifying the Study Questions
The research team consisted of a clinical research specialist in traditional East Asian
medicine (JL), an undergraduate researcher (HBS), and three neuropsychiatry specialists
(SHK, CYK, and HYK). The team conducted a preliminary literature search to identify
previous clinical evidence and worked collaboratively to develop and reﬁne the research
questions to ensure the thoroughness of the scoping review. The research team formulated
the following questions to guide the scoping review:

1. What are the characteristics of the studies that have investigated the use of acupunc-
ture for managing PTSD in military veterans, including research design and target
population?

2. What clinical outcomes have been examined in previous studies on PTSD management

in military veterans?

3. What is the acupuncture therapy regimen for managing PTSD in military veterans?
4. What is the effectiveness and safety of using acupuncture for treating PTSD in military

veterans, as reported in previous studies?

Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies
Information Source
In stage 2, we identiﬁed relevant studies through a literature search of peer-reviewed
articles on the use of acupuncture for PTSD. The search covered the period from the be-
ginning of each database until November 2022. We used several databases, including
MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Allied
and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycArticles, Wanfang, VIP, China National Knowledge
Infrastructure, Korea Citation Index, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated
System, and Citation Information by NII. Additionally, we considered grey literature
searches, such as conference proceedings and doctoral dissertations, using Google Scholar.
We manually searched the reference lists of relevant reviews and articles and contacted
the authors of published papers with inaccessible electronic ﬁles. The search strategy was
developed upon consultation with a clinical researcher, literature review expert, and psy-
chiatric disease specialist. We used a combination of synonyms and related medical subject
headings for the disease terms related to PTSD caused by war exposure, and intervention
terms related to acupuncture. Detailed search terms and strategies are provided in Table S1
in Supplementary Materials.
Eligibility Criteria:
(1) Study design: In this scoping review, we considered clinical research studies that
investigated the effects of acupuncture intervention on military veterans with PTSD. Ran-
domized controlled clinical trials, quasi-randomized controlled trials, non-randomized
controlled trials, single-arm trials, case series, cross-sectional studies, and feasibility studies

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

4 of 24

were also included. We excluded case reports with less than three patients [31], literature
reviews, and preclinical studies. We examined the reference list of each selected systematic
review. (2) Participant type: The participants eligible for this scoping review were military
veterans who had been exposed to combat and had PTSD symptoms. In this paper, “vet-
eran” is deﬁned as a military personnel who has participated in war or combat, irrespective
of the current active or retired status. The studies included in this review used standardized
diagnostic criteria for PTSD, such as those found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases. Additionally,
studies that used validated PTSD evaluation tools, such as the Clinician-Administered
PTSD Scale, PTSD Checklist, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised, with cutoff values as
inclusion criteria were also included. The review also considered studies that included
PTSD comorbid with medical illnesses, such as tinnitus and traumatic brain injury. (3) In-
tervention type: To be eligible for inclusion in the review, various types of acupuncture
therapy were considered as possible interventions, including manual acupuncture, warm-
needle acupuncture, ﬁre needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, pharmacopuncture, bee
venom acupuncture, and acupotomy. However, acupressure therapy was not included
in this review. The review did not restrict concomitant treatment, except for East Asian
traditional medicine interventions, such as herbal medicine, moxibustion, cupping, and
tui-na. Any type of intervention was permitted in the control group. There were no
restrictions on the treatment period, dosage, or frequency of acupuncture. (4) Types of
Outcome Measurements: Our review considered various symptoms that may arise after a
diagnosis of PTSD. We did not impose any restrictions on the outcome variables considered.
Based on a previous study [26], the outcomes were categorized into the following groups:
(1) psychological symptoms, such as anger, irritability, guilt, anxiety, fear, distrust, sad-
ness, shame, apathy, alienation, frustration, loss of conﬁdence, and mourning; (2) somatic
symptoms, such as palpitations, pain, anorexia, insomnia, and fatigue; and (3) cognitive
symptoms, such as repeated recall of traumatic events, decreased memory, difﬁculty in
making decisions, and lack of concentration. Due to the nature of the scoping review, the
search and selection were conducted in an expansive manner with the agreement of the
researchers, to view the research ﬁeld as broadly as possible. In addition to these outcome
variables, we investigated the safety issues including the incidence of adverse events and
dropout rates.

Stage 3: Study selection
The research team established and agreed upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Three independent reviewers (HBS, HYK, and JHS) screened the articles, starting with a
review of the titles and abstracts, to identify potentially relevant articles. A full-text review
of articles that met the inclusion criteria was conducted. All the reasons for inclusion
or exclusion were recorded according to the predetermined criteria. Any discrepancies
between the reviewers were resolved through discussion with an independent researcher
as a mediator.

Stage 4: Charting the data
The study team developed a data extraction sheet using pilot testing and multiple
iterations. This sheet included various items to be collected from the studies, such as:
(1) general information about the study, including the name of the ﬁrst author, publication
year, country, and research design; (2) participants’ demographic data, including the
sex, age, number of participants (initial and ﬁnal), disease duration and severity, and
diagnostic criteria; (3) details of the intervention, such as the type of acupuncture, treatment
dosage, treatment period, acupuncture point, and control/concomitant intervention; and
(4) outcome variables regarding the efﬁcacy and safety.

Three reviewers (HBS, HYK, and JHS) separately extracted data from the articles and
crosschecked their ﬁndings. In case of any discrepancies, a third researcher (SHK) provided
justiﬁcations to resolve the disagreements. This process ensured accurate and reliable data
extraction.

Stage 5: Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

5 of 24

The data extracted from the included studies were used to collate, synthesize, and
summarize information according to the analytical framework of the scoping review. The
qualitative data analysis phase included information, such as the authors’ names, countries,
publication years, number of participants, sex, age, research designs, and type of treatment
or control group intervention. The results of each outcome domain in the clinical research,
the study’s conclusion, and the number of adverse events were included in the ﬁrst table.
The tables were categorized based on the study design, such as randomized controlled trials
(RCT), before-after studies, case series, and qualitative studies. The second table, “Detailed
Information of Acupuncture Treatment”, provided speciﬁc details about the intervention,
including the type of acupuncture, location of the acupuncture point, treatment frequency,
treatment period, treatment number, and details of the control or concomitant intervention.
A research map table was used to visualize the current research status and frequently
used outcomes, assisting researchers and practitioners in identifying knowledge gaps in
PTSD-acupuncture research. A risk of bias assessment was not conducted, as the primary
objective of this scoping review was to provide an overview and map the existing evidence,
rather than undertaking a critical appraisal [26].

3. Results
3.1. Study Selection

Through a comprehensive database search, we retrieved 5532 records. After remov-
ing duplicates, 5136 records were considered. Following a title and abstract screening,
5103 records were excluded. We then retrieved the full text of the remaining 33 records
for a detailed assessment, and 25 records were subsequently excluded for various reasons
as shown in Figure 1. The list of full-text retrieved articles is provided in Table S2 of
Supplementary Materials. In total, eight studies, including four RCTs [32–35], two before–
after studies [36,37], one case series [38], and one qualitative study [39], were included in
this review (Figure 1).

RCTs (1) Population: In the reviewed studies, enlisted personnel were the most common participant demographics, and more males than females were present in all studies. Three studies [32,33,35] enrolled veterans, two of whom were Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans [32,33], and two studies [32,34] enrolled active-duty military personnel. In three [32–34] of the four studies, the participants were diagnosed with PTSD based on the DSM-IV or DSM-IV-text revision criteria (Table 1). The mean age and standard deviation of the participants in each group are presented in Table 1, with mean values ranging from 30 to 40. (2) Intervention: Two studies [32,33] performed auric-ular acupuncture and one study [35] performed manual acupuncture. In one case [34], the usual PTSD care was implemented as concurrent therapy. The duration of the intervention varied from three weeks to two months. (3) Control: Interventions performed in the con-trol group included sham acupuncture, usual PTSD care, and waiting-list control. Most studies [27–29] adopted a 1:1 design; however, Prisco et al. [33] compared the effects of a three-group design: manual acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list control. En-gel, et al. [34] utilized an intervention of “acupuncture combined with standard PTSD care” in their study. The study design involved administering the usual PTSD care, in-cluding psychotherapy and medication, as per the clinical practice guidelines for PTSD, to a control group. The purpose of the study was to assess the added effects of acupunc-ture; thus, no efforts were made to increase adherence to standard care modalities. (4) Outcome: In three studies [27,28,30], sleep-related outcomes were the most commonly measured indicators. Objectively, sleep was measured using actigraphy, consensus sleep diary, and mini-sleep diary (MSD) [32,33,35]. Sleep was subjectively assessed using the Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

3.2.1. RCTs

(1) Population: In the reviewed studies, enlisted personnel were the most common
participant demographics, and more males than females were present in all studies. Three
studies [32,33,35] enrolled veterans, two of whom were Operation Enduring Freedom and
Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans [32,33], and two studies [32,34] enrolled active-duty
military personnel. In three [32–34] of the four studies, the participants were diagnosed
with PTSD based on the DSM-IV or DSM-IV-text revision criteria (Table 1). The mean age
and standard deviation of the participants in each group are presented in Table 1, with mean
values ranging from 30 to 40. (2) Intervention: Two studies [32,33] performed auricular
acupuncture and one study [35] performed manual acupuncture. In one case [34], the usual
PTSD care was implemented as concurrent therapy. The duration of the intervention varied
from three weeks to two months. (3) Control: Interventions performed in the control group
included sham acupuncture, usual PTSD care, and waiting-list control. Most studies [27–29]
adopted a 1:1 design; however, Prisco et al. [33] compared the effects of a three-group
design: manual acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list control. Engel, et al. [34]
utilized an intervention of “acupuncture combined with standard PTSD care” in their study.
The study design involved administering the usual PTSD care, including psychotherapy
and medication, as per the clinical practice guidelines for PTSD, to a control group. The
purpose of the study was to assess the added effects of acupuncture; thus, no efforts
were made to increase adherence to standard care modalities.
(4) Outcome: In three
studies [27,28,30], sleep-related outcomes were the most commonly measured indicators.
Objectively, sleep was measured using actigraphy, consensus sleep diary, and mini-sleep
diary (MSD) [32,33,35]. Sleep was subjectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index (PSQI) [32,35] and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [33]. Changes in the PTSD symptoms
were evaluated using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL) [32,34]
and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [34]. Depressive mood, pain, and
quality of life were assessed [34] using the numeric rating scale (NRS), Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI), Short Form 36 Physical Component Summary (SF-36 PSC), and Short
Form 36 Mental Component Summary (SF-36 MCS), respectively (Table 2).

3.2.2. Before-After Studies

(1) Population: In the two studies [36,37] we reviewed, participants were selected
based on their experiences of war-related trauma, including combat-related trauma and
military sexual trauma, as classiﬁed in the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10), regardless of their PTSD diagnostic status (Table 1). One study [36]
reported the mean age and standard deviation as 32.96 ± 9.66, while another study [37]
reported an age range of 29–48. (2) Intervention: Manual acupuncture was applied in both
studies, and auricular acupuncture was used in combination with manual acupuncture in
one study. The duration of the intervention in the study conducted by Eisenlohr et al. [32]
was not speciﬁed. On the other hand, the study by Cronin [37] involved a treatment period
of 5 days with a follow-up assessment conducted 2 weeks post-treatment. (3) Outcome: In
the study by Eisenlohr et al. [36], the evaluation of PTSD-related symptoms was based on
ﬁve subjective rating scales, and no normalization was performed. In contrast, Cronin, and
Conboy [37] utilized the PSQI to measure sleep quality and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5
(PCL-M) to assess PTSD-related symptoms (Table 3).

3.2.3. Case Series Study

(1) Population: The study population included patients previously diagnosed with
PTSD who presented with tinnitus symptoms (Table 1). The age range of the partici-
pants in this study was 41–59 years, which was older than that reported in other studies.
(2) Intervention: The intervention involved the application of manual acupuncture for an
unspeciﬁed duration. (3) Outcome: The outcome was measured by recording and reporting
the subjective improvement in the tinnitus symptoms as perceived by the patients (Table 4).

(1) Auricular Acupuncture: Four studies [32,33,37,39] used auricular acupuncture
as the sole intervention. In all the studies, the Shenmen and Kidney points were com-
monly selected, whereas the Heart and Sympathetic points were frequently utilized. The
intervention was performed according to a set protocol, without operator discretion. The
treatment time and frequency varied, with acupuncture being performed for over 30 min
per session, and the visit interval was set to be more frequent than twice a week. One
study [33] reported that the needles were inserted perpendicularly, and reached the ear
cartilage to a depth where they could stand on their own without using a guide tube. No
manipulation was reported in the same study, whereas the other three studies did not
report any induced responses.

(2) Manual Acupuncture: Two studies [3,36,38] included in this review performed
manual acupuncture alone. In a study conducted by Eisenlohr et al. [36], rough guidelines
were provided in the study design, with the procedure performed at the operator’s discre-
tion. Four needles were reportedly used in a study by Arhin, et al. [38], which employed the
Korea Four Needle Technique, whereas other studies did not report the number of needles
used. (3) Auricular and Manual Acupuncture: In two studies [28,29] that combined the
two methods, rough guidelines were provided for manual acupuncture, and the operator
performed the procedure considering the characteristics of each patient.

The Shenmen point was commonly used as the auricular acupoint, which was preva-
lent in all the studies that applied auricular acupuncture. In the four studies that used
manual acupuncture, PC6 was used three times, whereas SP6 was used twice, indicating
frequent usage. The number of other acupuncture points varied. No manipulation was
reported in one study, whereas no other studies reported any induced responses.

3.4. Reported Effectiveness and Safety of Acupuncture for PTSD
3.4.1. Effectiveness in RCTs

In a study by King et al. [31], a signiﬁcant improvement was observed only in the
PSQI-sleep quality and daytime dysfunction in the auricular acupuncture group, whereas
no improvement in the objective sleep indices was observed. A similar outcome was found
in a study by Prisco et al. [32], in which the control group was assigned to a waiting list
or sham acupuncture. Only the ISI-Total score signiﬁcantly improved in the treatment
group after one month of treatment. Conversely, Huang et al. [34] found a signiﬁcant
improvement in the PSQI global score and objective sleep measures assessed by actigraphy.
Engel et al. [33] reported a signiﬁcant improvement in PTSD symptoms as measured by
the PCL, CAPS, NRS, BDI, and SF-36 in the test group, who received acupuncture as an
adjunct to standard PTSD care. However, King et al. [31] found no signiﬁcant improvement
in the PCL-M and PHQ-9 scores in the group receiving acupuncture compared with the
sham acupuncture group (Table 2).

3.4.2. Effectiveness in the Before-After Study

All the before-after studies demonstrated improvements in PTSD-related symptoms
and sleep quality after a series of acupuncture interventions. In a study conducted by
Cronin and Conboy [36], both the PSQI and PCL-M were found to demonstrate signiﬁcant
improvements compared to the pre-treatment measurements. Eisenlohr et al. [35] reported
subjective improvement in the symptoms, such as sleep disorders, restlessness, agitation,
frightfulness, and aggression, among patients, without performing a statistical analysis
(Table 3).

3.4.3. Effectiveness in the Case Series

All symptoms of tinnitus accompanying PTSD reportedly improved following a
series of acupuncture sessions, with patients expressing satisfaction with the acupuncture
treatment [37] (Table 4).

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

3.4.4. Effectiveness in the Qualitative Study

King, Moore, and Spence (2016) [38] aimed to explore the factors that contribute to
improved sleep in veterans with PTSD-related insomnia undergoing acupuncture in a
follow-up to their previous study [31]. Direct improvement responses included a faster
ability to fall asleep, longer sleep duration, ability to fall asleep during auricular acupunc-
ture, reduced frequency of nightmares, and improvement in daytime functioning. Indirect
effects included reduced pain and increased relaxation levels (Table 5).

3.4.5. Safety of Acupuncture

Adverse events were reported in three [31–33] of the four RCTs. Engel et al. [33]
reported no adverse effects in either the acupuncture treatment group or the control group.
In two other studies [31,32], falls and withdrawals due to discomfort from acupuncture
were reported as side effects in the acupuncture group. Among the 119 participants in the
RCTs, adverse events occurred in two of the ﬁfty-ﬁve patients in the intervention group
and four of the sixty-four patients in the control group. In one before-after study [35], two
of twenty-seven participants reported side effects, including feelings of drunkenness and
excessive sleep; however, these adverse events were alleviated after the exclusion of speciﬁc
acupoints in subsequent interventions (Tables 2–4).

4. Discussion

This scoping review aimed to investigate the types, methods, measurement indices,
and effectiveness of acupuncture in managing trauma in military veterans by collecting
relevant studies. Although the number of selected studies was limited, the analysis of eight
studies provided an overview of the current state of research in the ﬁeld.

Main ﬁndings and interpretation
Question 1: What are the characteristics of the studies on the use of acupuncture

for PTSD management in military veterans?

Four RCTs, two before-and-after studies, one case series, and one qualitative study
were identiﬁed. RCTs, which provide the highest level of evidence in evidence-based
medicine, were the most commonly conducted studies. This may be owing to the fact
that acupuncture is not a new treatment and has already been researched in various
ﬁelds, including trauma-related mental and physical symptoms [20]. Researchers are now
investigating its effectiveness in comparison with other interventions in certain settings
through RCTs, rather than merely comparing before-and-after effects of acupuncture. For
example, Engel et al. [33] conducted a study to examine changes in the improvement of
PTSD symptoms based on whether acupuncture was performed in addition to usual PTSD
care. The study design was highly consistent with that of the current clinical setting. In
addition, a supplementary qualitative study [38] was conducted to verify the efﬁcacy of
acupuncture and further substantiate the research ﬁndings, building upon prior RCTs [31].
Data on the rank, sex, age, and whether the participants were on active duty or not
were collected as participant characteristics. In terms of rank, enlisted service members
were the most prevalent, and in terms of sex, males were more represented than females.
This sex ratio can be explained by the speciﬁcity of the military profession. However, ofﬁcer
rank and female sex were also represented in the study to a certain degree. In terms of
age, the average age of the recruited study participants was 30 years in studies targeting
active-duty military personnel within the range of military enlistment and discharge age.
Meanwhile, a study [38] focusing on retired veterans who had been treated for PTSD long
ago exhibited a relatively high age range of 41–59 years.

Question 2: Which clinical outcomes were adopted in previous studies on PTSD

management in military veterans?

Studies have shown that acupuncture can improve the core and related symptoms of
PTSD (50%) and sleep quality (67.5%). As a subjective indicator of sleep, the PSQI was used
in three cases, in addition to the use of the ISI and MSD. Wrist actigraphy was used as an
objective indicator in three studies. Problems related to sleep were classiﬁed separately as

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

19 of 24

“nightmare symptoms in PTSD” and were considered important enough to be mentioned
separately in many medical guidelines. This can be a major factor in lowering the work
capacity of military personnel, who must always be prepared and vigilant to maintain
military readiness.

To evaluate PTSD-related symptoms, most studies used the PCL or PCL-M, while
one study used a combination of the PCL-M and CAPS-IV. Some studies use the BDI,
NRS, and SF-36 to measure PTSD-related symptoms. As PTSD is a well-deﬁned condition
with established measurement indices, the PCL-M is a preferred method for measuring
the outcomes. Given that the symptomatic manifestations of PTSD are characterized by
diverse mental and physical symptoms, some studies have utilized alternative indicators
to measure the effectiveness of interventions targeting this condition [29,32].

Question 3: What is the regimen of acupuncture therapy for PTSD management in

military veterans?

Auricular acupuncture (50%), manual acupuncture (25%), or a combination of both
(25%) were administered. Although a standardized protocol was commonly employed
in acupuncture studies, some degree of operator discretion was occasionally allowed.
Electroacupuncture and scalp electroacupuncture, which have been reported in other
studies on participants with PTSD [35,36] without military issues, were not used. This
is because standardized procedures using minimal equipment are required in battleﬁeld
situations, in which PTSD occurs in large numbers [40].

Auricular acupuncture was used in this study. To date, BFA and NADA are two
existing auricular acupuncture protocols. In particular, BFA is widely applied in the US
military and has been reported to have a signiﬁcant effect on the treatment of pain [41]; it
has been used for managing insomnia in service members with promising effects [39,40].
Patients with PTSD generally complain of new or worsening pain [42], with insomnia as a
core symptom [43].

The NADA protocol was developed as an alternative non-pharmacological treatment
for addiction; however, some papers have reported the application of the NADA protocol
to PTSD treatment for patients exposed to massive traumatic events [44]. In this review,
we included a study by Cronin et al. [36], which applied the NADA protocol and reported
improvements in PTSD symptoms and sleep disorders. According to a recent study, signiﬁ-
cant parasympathetic nervous system activity was identiﬁed when heart rate variability
(HRV) was measured after needling Shenmen and Zero points [45], indicating the role of
auricular acupuncture in alleviating hypersensitivity-related symptoms accompanying
PTSD associated with parasympathetic activity. Notably, Shenmen was also the most
frequently selected acupoint in the studies analyzed in this review.

Acupuncture was typically administered for approximately 30 min per session. Al-
though the duration varied, most studies recommended a minimum of three weeks of
treatment. However, intensive intervention, such as receiving daily treatment, was effective
even after just 5 days [36].

Question 4: What have previous studies reported with respect to the effectiveness

and safety of using acupuncture for treating PTSD in military veterans?

With regard to PTSD-related symptoms, a signiﬁcant decrease was observed in three
of the four reported studies. The difference between the groups was statistically signiﬁcant
compared to the control group. However, in the studies by King et al. [31], no signiﬁcant
change was observed compared to the control group. A systematic review of the studies
that applied acupuncture to PTSD in adults [20] also performed a meta-analysis on six of
seven selected cases demonstrating signiﬁcant overall effect size]. Studies conducted by
Engel et al. [33] and King et al. [31] were also included in this analysis.

In the case of sleep-related indicators, no change was observed in the objective in-
dicators in the study by King et al. [31]; however, improvements in sleep quality and
daytime function were conﬁrmed using the PSQI. A similar response was reported by
Prisco et al. [32]. In the study by Huang et al. [34], a signiﬁcant improvement in the global
PSQI score was found in the mild traumatic brain injury group, which was divided by

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

20 of 24

stratiﬁed randomization based on the presence or absence of PTSD, compared to the sham
acupuncture group. These results are meaningful because the analysis showed that the
presence of PTSD did not signiﬁcantly affect the degree of improvement in insomnia.

Reports indicated that despite a lack of improvement in the total sleep time, the sleep
quality and daytime activity capacity improved, in contrast to existing animal experi-
ments [18]. In animal experiments, the manual acupuncture group showed an increase in
total sleep time compared to the control group. However, as this study was conducted on
humans, it is possible that improved sleep quality allowed the participants to reduce their
sleep time and engage in other activities. It is also important to consider the potential ceiling
effect of sleep time in treating mild sleep disturbances, as the baseline of the participants’
total sleep time was close to the normal values. The use of polysomnography to measure
electroencephalography could provide a more accurate understanding of why total sleep
time remained stable but sleep quality and daytime fatigue improved.

No serious adverse events directly related to acupuncture were reported, and some
side effects resolved after stopping the intervention for speciﬁc acupoints. Generally,
side effects of acupuncture can include infection, damage to the internal organs, such
as pneumothorax or heart injury, injury to the central or peripheral nerves [46], local
discomforts such as bruising and pain, and other reactions such as orthostatic problems,
worsening of symptoms, headache, and fatigue [47]. Vasovagal syncope, suicide attempts,
hypertensive crises, and asthma attacks have been reported as potentially serious adverse
events [47]. The side effects of auricular acupuncture tend to focus on infection, local
discomfort, and autonomic reactions, such as dizziness, as it does not cause damage to
the internal organs or central nervous system [48]. In the studies reviewed in this report,
needle acupoints were not located in the trunk; only those in the auricular acupuncture and
upper/lower extremities were used; therefore, the risk of serious damage to the internal
organs was likely eliminated. Therefore, the adverse effects of auricular acupuncture and
acupuncture for PTSD military personnel in distal acupoints are not fatal, and the side
effects are within the controllable range of the operator.

Clinical signiﬁcance of this review
This study represents the ﬁrst scoping review on the effects of acupuncture on war-
related trauma among military personnel. Acupuncture, as a non-psychological and
non-pharmacological intervention, may help overcome barriers to PTSD treatment, such as
social stigma and limited access to mental health care.

The ﬁndings of this scoping review can be a useful reference when designing acupunc-
ture protocols for the treatment of PTSD in military personnel. The development of
standardized acupuncture protocols for the treatment of PTSD in military personnel repre-
sents a signiﬁcant step in this ﬁeld. As noted previously, the variability in the acupuncture
protocols used in the studies included in this scoping review highlights the need for more
consistency in treatment administration. The development of standardized protocols
could also help increase the reproducibility of results in future studies and facilitate the
comparison of outcomes across different studies.

Limitations of this review
This study had several limitations. First, the inclusion criteria were broad, resulting in
the inclusion of all personnel who reported war-related trauma. This method maximizes the
number of studies included in the scoping review but may result in a heterogeneous degree
of suffering among the participants. A study by Eisenlohr, Römer, and Zimmermann [35]
speciﬁcally targeted patients meeting Criterion A of the ICD-10 PTSD criteria and found that
19 of 27 patients were diagnosed with PTSD. The study by Cronin, and Conboy [36] focused
on veterans with combat stress-induced insomnia, and using the PCL-M assessment tool,
found that four of the ﬁve participants had symptoms exceeding the reference point for
PTSD, with one participant not meeting the criteria for full-blown PTSD. Huang et al. [34]
included patients with mild traumatic brain injury, with >60% of patients diagnosed
with PTSD. The results of the regression analysis conﬁrmed that PTSD did not have an
interaction effect, which compelled us to include this review in our study. In the study

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

21 of 24

by Arhin et al. [38], only past PTSD diagnosis history was conﬁrmed, and no new PTSD
diagnosis was made at the start of treatment. Second, studies may have been missed in the
systematic search process, particularly those published in languages other than English,
Chinese, Korean, or Japanese. Third, owing to the variation in the acupuncture protocols
among the selected articles, accurate evaluation of speciﬁc acupuncture methods was not
possible. However, this limitation can be addressed through future standardization efforts.
Finally, a consultation step, which would have been the ﬁnal step in the scoping review,
was not performed owing to the small number of veterans in the Republic of Korea and
ethical concerns that may arise in obtaining a list of contactable veterans.

Suggestions for Future Research
Although RCTs are the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture
in treating PTSD symptoms, prospective observational studies may provide valuable data
if RCTs are not feasible. It is important to standardize acupuncture protocols as much as
possible to ensure consistency across studies on acupuncture in military personnel with
PTSD. Acupuncture treatment involves the application of multiple acupuncture points,
which necessitates the establishment of a standardized protocol. In principle, the best
method is to establish the most effective protocol through a pilot study, which compares the
effectiveness of several candidate protocols using various acupuncture point combinations,
manipulation methods, treatment frequencies, and periods. However, if there is a lack of
time or budget for conducting basic research, the Delphi method, which involves gathering
expert opinions through a structured iterative process [49], can be adopted. We suggest
combining acupuncture points based on the meridian theory, with Shenmen, Zeropoint,
and Sympathetic points being the most frequently used auricular acupuncture points.
Improvement can be expected with acupuncture treatment administered at intervals of
approximately twice a week for a total of approximately 10 treatments.

Outcome indicators, including core PTSD symptoms and sleep-related indicators,
should be consistent with existing studies. The sleep-related outcomes of previous stud-
ies [31,32,34] were mostly self-reported measurements with the exception of actigraphy.
Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the mechanisms of acupuncture using objective mea-
surements. For example, measures such as salivary cortisol [50] and HRV parameters [51]
can be applied to assess physiological changes, while functional magnetic resonance imag-
ing [52] can be used to evaluate brain activation areas. A polysomnography test [53] should
be conducted to investigate the paradoxical improvement in sleep, which has not been
explained in previous studies.

Regarding participant characteristics, it is worth noting that the composition of mil-
itary populations often results in a higher proportion of male participants in research
studies, with some investigations even being exclusively conducted with male participants.
Consequently, it is imperative to undertake measures to mitigate any gender bias in partici-
pant recruitment and employ subgroup analyses to determine potential gender interaction
effects. Explicitly specifying the service status of military personnel participating in the
study, whether active or retired, is essential owing to signiﬁcant differences in their moti-
vation for recovery and work environment. As the term “veteran” is ambiguous and can
indicate either a retired service member or a military personnel with combat experience,
it is crucial to clearly indicate the current service status of participants in the research
conducted. The accumulation of a sufﬁcient number of studies can promote categorizing
them into subgroups and facilitate analyses.

In military medicine, cost-effectiveness is a pivotal area of interest in public health
policies [54]. Particularly, in the event of a wartime scenario, where a substantial number
of patients with PTSD may emerge, the signiﬁcance of cost-effectiveness is ampliﬁed.
Therefore, whether acupuncture can serve as a cost-effective intervention for combat-
related PTSD should be investigated. If found to be a cost-effective solution, acupuncture
could be adopted as an authorized response measure for PTSD care in military medicine in
various countries. In military settings, manuals produced by higher-level organizations
are disseminated to lower-level units on the battleﬁeld. Therefore, if additional research

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2957

22 of 24

conﬁrms the effectiveness of acupuncture interventions for combat-related (PTSD, it may be
possible to produce and distribute a manual that outlines the appropriate protocol for use in
military practice. Furthermore, the distribution of chart forms that record PTSD symptoms
before and after acupuncture treatment could facilitate retrospective data collection.

5. Conclusions

The available research on acupuncture as a treatment for trauma in military veterans
has mainly been conducted using a RCT design, along with a few before and after studies,
case series, and qualitative studies. Considering the various acupuncture approaches,
auricular acupuncture has been the most commonly used approach, with the Shenmen and
Kidney points being frequently targeted. The main outcome measures were scales related
to core PTSD symptoms and sleep. The results of these studies suggested that acupuncture
may be a potential intervention for military personnel experiencing combat-related PTSD,
either alone or in combination with conventional therapies. However, further research is
warranted to establish its efﬁcacy as a stand-alone treatment for PTSD in military personnel.
As acupuncture is already being utilized in the ﬁeld, research should be directed to gather
further evidence by compiling various data, through diverse study designs.
