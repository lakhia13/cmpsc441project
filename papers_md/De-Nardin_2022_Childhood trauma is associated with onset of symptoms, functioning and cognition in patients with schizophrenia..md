Abstract

Introduction:  Childhood  trauma  (CT)  is  known  to  be  a  vulnerability  factor  for  schizophrenia,  but  the 
specific impacts of different trauma subtypes on the prognosis of these patients remains unclear.
Objective: To assess the relationships between the occurrence of overall CT and its subtypes with factors 
with known prognostic impact on schizophrenia, such as age at onset of symptoms, global functioning, 
and cognitive impairment in a sample of Brazilian patients.
Methods:  One  hundred  and  five  stable  patients  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  according  to  DSM-
5  criteria  were  evaluated  using  the  Independent  Living  Skills  Survey  (ILSS;  self-report  global 
functioning),  Schizophrenia  Cognition  Rating  Scale  (SCoRS;  subjective  cognitive  impairment),  and 
Childhood  Trauma  Questionnaire  scales  (CTQ;  perceived  overall  CT,  emotional  neglect,  physical 
neglect,  physical  abuse,  and  emotional  and  sexual  abuse).  Statistical  analysis  was  performed  with 
multivariate linear regression.
Results:  After  controlling  for  educational  level  and  age,  subjective  cognitive  impairment  was  directly 
correlated with overall perceived CT occurrence, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse. Self-report global 
functioning was inversely correlated with perceived overall CT occurrence, emotional abuse, and sexual 
abuse. Emotional abuse and physical abuse were also inversely correlated with age at onset of symptoms.
Conclusions: CT can be related to more severe prognoses in schizophrenia, impacting on early onset 
of  symptoms,  lower  global  functioning,  and  greater  cognitive  impairment.  Subtypes  of  trauma  can  be 
associated with different prognostic risks.
Keywords: Childhood trauma, cognition, functioning, schizophrenia.

Introduction

The neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia 

refers  to  a  complex  interaction  between  risk  and 

vulnerability  factors.  A  better  understanding  of  these 

factors is fundamental to enable early interventions in 
patients with this disease.1

Childhood  trauma  (CT)  is  a  well-documented  risk 

factor for schizophrenia, in association with genetic and 
other  environmental  factors.2  CT  has  been  associated 
with  severity  of  symptoms  3-5  and  with  cognitive  and 
functional performance6-13 in patients with schizophrenia.
In  a  recent  review,  Popovic  et  al.14  showed 
associations  between  CT  and  poor  performance  in

Multivariate analysis used the linear regression model, in which variables with a p-value less than 0.20 were included in the univariate analysis. The backward

approach  and  it  is  possible  that  cognitive  impairment 

and  medication  use  could  influence  the  patients’ 
responses. However, as pointed out by Popovic et al.14 
this kind of limitation may be unavoidable, due to the 

very  nature  of  CT.  In  retrospective  studies,  the  only 

means of assessing CT is by using self-report measures 

and the influence of memory bias, cognitive impairment, 

and medication use is also well-documented. The same 

limitation inherent to patient self-reports also apply to 

the other scales used - SCoRS and ILSS.

In  conclusion,  CT  is  related  to  worse  prognostic 

impact  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  and  is  mainly 

related  to  onset  of  symptoms  during  childhood  and 

adolescence,  impaired  global  functioning,  and  greater 

cognitive  impairment.  Different  subtypes  of  trauma 

seem to influence these outcomes differently, although 

these associations need to be more deeply investigated 

in prospective studies.
