rehabilitation interventions following breast
cancer treatment - a systematic review of
systematic reviews

Abstract

Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Post-treatment, patients
suffer from side effects and have various rehabilitation needs, which means that individualization is fundamental for
optimal rehabilitation. This systematic review (SR) of SRs aims to evaluate the current evidence on rehabilitation
interventions in female patients following BC treatment.
Methods: Full-text SRs published in English from 2009 were searched in Embase, PubMed, Cinahl Complete,
PsycINFO, AMED, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria: SRs of randomized or non-randomized controlled
trials investigating the effects of rehabilitation interventions in women following BC treatment. All outcomes were
considered. Methodological quality was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool and interrater agreement was
evaluated. Out of 1269 citations retrieved, 37 SRs were included.

Results: Five rehabilitation areas were identified: exercise and physical activity (PA), complementary and alternative
medicine (CAM), yoga, lymphoedema treatment, and psychosocial interventions. The most solid evidence was
found in exercise/PA and yoga. Exercise interventions improved outcomes such as shoulder mobility,
lymphoedema, pain, fatigue and quality of life (QoL). Effects of yoga were shown on QoL, anxiety, depression, sleep
disturbance, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. The effect of CAM was shown on nausea, pain, fatigue, anger
and anxiety but these results need to be interpreted with caution because of low methodological quality in
included studies in the SRs. Among the lymphoedema treatments, positive effects were seen for resistance training
on volume reduction and muscle strength and psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy
had positive effects on QoL, anxiety, depression and mood disturbance.

Conclusions: This SR of SRs show solid positive effects of exercise/PA and yoga for women following BC treatment,
and provides extended knowledge of the effects of CAM, yoga, lymphoedema treatment and psychosocial
interventions. It is evident that more than one intervention could have positive effects on a specific symptom and
that the effects depend not only on intervention type but also on how and when the intervention is provided. The
results can be used as a foundation for individualized rehabilitation and aid health care professionals in meeting
patients’ individual needs and preferences.
Trial registration: PROSPERO (CRD42017060912).

Background
Today breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of
cancer in women worldwide [1]. At the same time, devel-
opments in diagnostics, treatment and care have resulted
in an increased survival rate, which sets new challenges
for the health care system regarding how to support pa-
tients to achieve optimal rehabilitation. A complicating
factor is the heterogeneous rehabilitation needs of women
treated for BC. Commonly reported consequences of the
disease or treatments are pain [2–4], lymphoedema [5], fa-
tigue [6] and depression [7].
reduced
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosocial
consequences such as reduced social contacts [8] and psy-
chological distress [9] have been reported, as well as diffi-
culty in resuming functional activity and life roles [10],
and in unmet information needs [11]. Consequently, pa-
tients with BC may have physical, psychological, social
and existential rehabilitation needs [12], and more re-
search is needed to identify the optimal way to support
them in their new life situation. To optimize rehabilita-
tion, an individualized approach identifying each patient’s
specific needs is warranted [13]. However, how this should
be done in terms of “who needs what and when” is rarely
addressed in either research or clinical practice.

In addition,

Research often addresses the effects of one specific re-
habilitation intervention related to one or a few specific
outcomes and provides an enhanced understanding of
separate interventions. However, based on the complex-
ity of patients’ rehabilitation needs, such knowledge is
often insufficient when it comes to aiding clinicians to
promote individualized rehabilitation. To establish a sys-
tematic way of providing individualized rehabilitation,
further research is warranted to bridge the gap between
rehabilitation research and clinical practice.

A complicating factor for health care professionals
(HCP) struggling to make sense of and evaluate different
rehabilitation alternatives and incorporate them into
clinical practice is the large amount of available research
on rehabilitation following BC treatment. One way to
make evidence available to HCPs and clinical decision
makers is by providing them with a summary of avail-
able evidence through a systematic review (SR) of sys-
tematic reviews (SRs) [14]. The purpose of such a review
is to identify and assess all published reviews within a
certain area and describe their quality, summarize and
compare their conclusions and discuss the strength of
these. Through such an approach an evidence base for
individualized rehabilitation can be developed.

Methods
Aim
This SR of SRs aims to evaluate the current evidence on
rehabilitation interventions in female patients following
BC treatment.

Literature search and selection
A systematic search and screening procedure was con-
ducted with assistance from a trained public health li-
brarian. The following databases were systematically
examined: Embase, PubMed, Cinahl Complete, Psy-
cINFO, AMED, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library. The
first search was performed in June 2016 and was re-
peated in October 2017. Several database-adapted MeSH
terms were utilized in the initial search,
including:
“breast cancer”, “breast cancer surgery”, “rehabilitation”,
“therapy”, “systematic review” and “meta-analysis”, and
the search terms were modified according to the specific
vocabulary map of each database (see Additional file 1).

The removal of duplicates and the initial screening of
titles and abstracts was performed in EndNote (Clarivate
Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Two of the authors
(U.O.M., M.M.) independently reviewed the titles and
abstracts. SRs were included if meeting the following in-
clusion criteria according to the PICO framework, where
the population was adult (≥18 years) women who had
undergone BC treatment; the intervention, SRs on the
effects of single or combined rehabilitation interven-
tions; and the comparison consisted of SRs of random-
and non-randomized
ized controlled trials
(RCTs)
of
controlled
non-randomized trials with a predefined control group.
Finally,
outcomes were
considered.

Full-text SRs in the English language published from
2009 in peer-review journals were included. SRs that did
not present data separately for BC, were of critically low
quality [15] and SRs with fewer than four included stud-
ies were excluded. The potential SRs were read in full
text by U.O.M., I.B. and M.M. Inclusion and exclusion
of SRs were discussed until discrepancies were resolved
by consensus among all authors. A protocol for this SR
PROSPERO
registered
was
of
(CRD42017060912).

Quality assessment
The methodological quality and risk of bias in included
SRs was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool [15], which
is a critical appraisal tool for SRs that include rando-
mised and non-randomised studies of healthcare inter-
ventions (NRSI). The instrument consist of 16 items
from which five items were considered critical in this SR
(item 4; comprehensiveness in literature search, item 9;
assessment of risk of bias in individual studies, item 11;
appropriateness of methods for statistical combination
of results, item 13; account for risk of bias in individual
studies when interpreting/discussion results and item 14;
explanation for and discussion of heterogeneity). Ac-
cording to AMSTAR 2 [15] multiple non-critical weak-
nesses may diminish confidence in the review and

Olsson Möller et al. BMC Cancer          (2019) 19:472 

Page 3 of 20

therefore we chose to move the overall appraisal down
from moderate to low confidence if seven or more
non-critical weaknesses were found. Quality was rated as
high, moderate, low and critically low (excluded) accord-
ing to the quality rating confidence levels [15]. For qual-
ity rating criteria see Table 1 and for quality grading of
the included SRs see Table 2.

To ensure interrater reliability, I.B., M.M. and U.O.M.
independently scored three SRs at first and then com-
pared and discussed the evaluations. Thereafter all SRs
were independently evaluated by two authors (I.B., M.M.
or U.O.M.) and discrepancies were discussed until con-
sensus was reached. Interrater agreement was evaluated
using Kappa coefficient in the 16 items. Item 9 and 11
includes separate evaluations of RCT and NRSI. A per-
fect agreement (k = 0.81–1.00) was shown in 8 items, a
substantial agreement (k = 0.61–0.80) in 6 items, a mod-
erate agreement
in 2 items and fair
agreement (k = 0.21–0.40) in 2 items (Table 2).

(k = 0.41–0.60)

Data extraction
Data extraction from the included SRs was performed
and independently verified by I.B. and U.O.M. using a
standard data extraction form developed by the review
authors. The extraction form included: primary author;
year of publication; number of studies included; type of
rehabilitation method/intervention;
total number and
range of included participants, clinical information; aim
inclusion and exclusion criteria; and out-
of the SR;
comes. Discrepancies between the authors were resolved
through a mutual decision after discussion.

Results
The database search yielded 1269 potentially relevant
studies, leaving 936 studies after removing duplicates. In
total, 886 studies were removed following the review of
study titles and abstracts. Of the 50 potentially eligible
SRs, 13 were excluded, leaving 37 SRs for inclusion in
the review. For details of the identification and inclu-
sion/exclusion of SRs, see PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 1). A
summary of the characteristics of the included SRs is
presented in Table 3.

To provide a comprehensive overview within this com-
plex and largely varying rehabilitation area, a broad scope
of SRs evaluating the effect of rehabilitation interventions
for patients were included. Five rehabilitation areas were

Table 1 Definition of quality rating criteria

identified during the analysis process: exercise and phys-
ical activity (PA), complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) interventions, yoga, lymphoedema treatment, and
psychosocial interventions.

Quality assessment of included SRs
Methodological quality of the 37 included SRs were eval-
uated with the AMSTAR 2 [15] tool and 21 were rated
as having low, 14 as having moderate and two as having
high methodological quality. Ten SRs within the exercise
and PA area was evaluated and seven of them were rated
as having low [16, 17, 24, 31, 38, 50, 52] and three as
having moderate [22, 37, 45] methodological quality. Six
SRs within the CAM intervention area were evaluated
and four of them were rated as having low [18, 33, 34,
40] and two as having moderate [41, 49] methodological
quality. In the yoga intervention area a total of four SRs
were evaluated and one was rated as having low [42]
and three as having moderate [20, 21, 51] methodo-
logical quality. In the lymphoedema treatment area ten
SRs were evaluated of which five were rated as having
low [19, 23, 27, 32, 46], four as having moderate [25, 39,
43, 44] and one as having high [47] methodological qual-
ity. Seven SRs within the psychosocial intervention area
were evaluated and four were rated as having low [26,
30, 35, 36], two as having moderate [28, 48] and one as
having high [29] methodological quality.

Exercise and PA
Overall, exercise and PA interventions were found to be
beneficial [52], safe and feasible [38] and positive effects
were shown on several outcomes.

Upper limb dysfunction
Exercise interventions such as range of motion and aer-
obic, resistance and stretching exercises were evaluated.
Positive effects such as increased shoulder mobility [17,
22, 37] and reduced shoulder pain were shown [22].

Fatigue
Mixed exercise programs such as aerobic exercise and
resistance training showed significant reductions of fa-
tigue in some [31, 38] but not all [52] SRs. A more pro-
nounced effect was identified with increasing length,
duration and frequency of the intervention [38] and

treatment [31].

Quality of life
Aerobic exercise [38, 50, 52] and resistance training [38,
50] as well as a mix of exercise and PA (e.g. walking)
showed positive effects on QoL [52]. Supervised exercise
programs seemed to be more effective than home-based
programs [38]. Interventions for upper limb dysfunction
showed no effect on QoL [37].

Behavior change interventions to promote exercise and PA
Behavior change interventions (health education, stress
included
management and psychology-based therapy)

different strategies such as telephone counselling, work-
shops, group exercise and web-based support. The re-
sults varied greatly relative to type of
intervention
strategies. Positive effects on fatigue, depression, anxiety
and stress were demonstrated [24]. Modest positive
short-term effects was shown on the amount of PA [16,
45]. A significant increase in PA was demonstrated,
mainly in SRs including high supervision/monitoring,
but also in SRs with less intense supervision, such as
counselling by telephone or e-mail [16].

In conclusion, exercise and PA was shown to have
positive effects on physical function, pain, fatigue and
QoL. Behavioural interventions showed positive effects
on e.g. fatigue and may increase the amount of PA.

However, the mediators and sustainability of interven-
tion effects are not known.

CAM interventions
Tai Chi was shown to have positive effects on emotional
wellbeing [49] and short-term benefits on upper limb
functional mobility [41]. Inconclusive results was shown
on overall QoL, psychological variables (e.g. self-esteem,
mood) and physical outcome measures (e.g. hand-grip
strength, flexibility) [33]. No effects of Thai Chi were
seen on body mass index (BMI), bone mineral density
and muscle strength [49]. Acupoint stimulation, in par-
ticular acupressure on the P6 acupoint, may be benefi-
cial
and
vomiting [18] while massage can reduce anger and fa-
tigue [40]. One SR showed positive effects of acupoint
stimulation for pain and fatigue, as well as massage on
anxiety, and that expressive writing had benefits for QoL
[34].

chemotherapy-induced nausea

to reduce

In conclusion, CAM may have positive effects on nau-
sea, pain, fatigue, anger, anxiety, upper limb functional
mobility and QoL. However, these results should be
interpreted with caution because the intervention studies
included in the SRs were reported as being built on
small studies with low methodological quality.

Yoga
Yoga had positive effects and significantly improved
QoL/HRQoL [20, 21, 42, 51] and was also shown to re-
duced fatigue, sleep disturbance [21], gastrointestinal
symptoms [42], anxiety and depression [20, 42]. Sub-
group analyses revealed symptom relief only during ac-
tive cancer treatment [20] and that yoga had positive
effects on anxiety only when it had been practiced for
longer than 3 months [42]. When yoga was compared
with psychosocial/educational
interventions, positive
moderate effects were seen in anxiety, depression and fa-
tigue in favour of yoga [21].

In conclusion, yoga was suggested to have positive ef-
fects on QoL, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, fa-
tigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. Duration as well as
phase of cancer treatment seemed to be key to a positive
outcome.

Lymphoedema treatment
Impact on risk for developing lymphoedema
Progressive
and
resistance
shoulder-mobilizing exercises do not appear to increase
the risk of developing lymphedema. Symptoms should
be closely monitored and adequately treated if
they
occur. Shoulder-mobilizing exercise seems to be more
beneficial when started earlier, rather than later [47].

Impact on lymphoedema
Resistance training seemed to be safe as it did not in-
crease the severity of lymphoedema, and was beneficial
in terms of increased upper and lower body muscular
strength [19, 32, 46], QoL [19, 46] and maintained BMI
[46]. Exercise (yoga, Nordic walking, resistance training)
showed positive effects on volume reduction [43]. In the
acute phase intermittent pneumatic compression may be
beneficial in combination with other therapies to reduce
the oedema volume [43]. Sleeves does not seem to re-
duce the volume, but may prevent additional swelling
[43]. Combined physical therapy may be effective for
arm oedema reduction [23]. Low-level laser therapy was
effective for volume reduction and a dose of 1–2 J/cm2
per point, applied to several points covering the fibrotic
area, was recommended [39]. The effects of manual
lymphatic drainage (MLD) for reducing lymphedema
were inconclusive [23, 27]. For example, it was shown
that MLD significantely reduced arm volume but might
not improve subjective symptoms or arm function [44].
MLD was well tolerated and safe in combination with
compression therapy and may benefit women with mild
to moderate lymphedema [25]. It was also shown that
compression bandages or fitted sleeves appear to be
more effective than standard sleeves and that it is im-
portant to do regular check-ups for volume status [25].

In conclusion, resistance training did not seem to in-
crease the risk of developing lymphoedema or worsen
existing lymphoedema. Positive effects on volume reduc-
tion and muscular strength were shown. The effect of
MLD seems to be related to the severity of the lymphoe-
dema and treatment combinations. Combined physical
therapy, low-laser therapy, exercise and sleeves seemed
to have positive effects.

Psychosocial interventions

showed positive effects on anxiety, depression [29, 36,
48], QoL [26, 29, 36], mood disturbance [29], body
image, sleep disturbance and self-esteem [36]. Individu-
alized CBT sessions may positively impact QoL [29] and
depressive symptoms [48]. In early stage BC patients re-
ceiving psychosocial support, no effects were shown for
QoL [35]. A mindfulness-based stress reduction inter-
vention significantly improved anxiety, depression, stress
and overall QoL [28] and patient education programmes
had a significant effect on pain reduction [30].

In conclusion, psychosocial

interventions may have
positive effects on anxiety, depression and QoL. How-
ever, these results should be interpreted with caution be-
cause the intervention studies included in the SRs were
built on small, heterogeneous studies with low methodo-
logical quality.

Discussion
This SR synthesizes the existing literature on BC re-
habilitation and provides a comprehensive overview of
the effects of various rehabilitation interventions that
can be used as a foundation for individualized rehabilita-
tion in clinical practice.

Five rehabilitation areas were identified and most of
the evidence was found in the areas of exercise and PA,
and yoga. Our results are in line with an earlier SR of
SRs, which found strong evidence for exercise interven-
tions aiming to improve physical outcomes such as
shoulder mobility and reduced lymphoedema [53]. How-
ever, our results also show that exercise seems safe and
feasible in general and specifically for shoulder pain and
mobility. Exercise also showed predominately positive ef-
fects on fatigue and QoL. Yoga was found to have posi-
tive effects on psychological wellbeing as well as some
aspects of physical wellbeing, especially during active
cancer treatment. Despite the evidence of positive effects
of exercise, it is known that BC patients do not meet the
recommended level of PA [54]. PA has an established
and potent impact on mortality [55] and is also related
to better QoL in patients with cancer [56]. This indicates
that there is a great need for HCP to encourage patients
to exercise during the cancer trajectory. Even though the
optimal type, frequency, intensity and duration of exer-
cise and PA are still unknown it is clearly stated that
performing any kind of these interventions may have
positive effects and is safe and feasible. HCPs need to
focus on supporting patients, not only in exercise and
PA, but also in self-care, work and leisure, to increase
their confidence and motivation [10].

In line with the previous SR of SRs [53] the present
study shows that there is an overemphasis on SRs focus-
ing on physical interventions such as exercise, PA and
yoga. Despite the existing evidence related to specific ex-
ercise interventions it is clear that one symptom or
problem could be treated with a range of interventions.
As an example, patients suffering from fatigue could
benefit from interventions such as exercise [31, 38],
CAM (acupoint stimulation and massage) [34, 40] or
yoga [21] depending on the diverse array of etiological
origins of fatigue [57] and, also, on the patients’ prefer-
ences. Exercise and yoga likewise have shown effects on
anxiety, depression and QoL [42, 52]. Anxiety was also
reduced by CBT, mindfulness-based stress reduction and
massage [28, 34, 36]. This variety of interventions with
positive outcomes indicates that it should be possible to
optimize rehabilitation through evidence-based interven-
tions. However, to enable this HCP need tools to identify
patients’ needs and knowledge, both in how to do this
and about available and effective interventions. There-
fore, taking the next step from evaluating the effect of
narrow rehabilitation studies on specific outcomes,

helping HCP by identifying a knowledge base that could
be used to enable individualization in clinical practice,
requires a more comprehensive approach to individual-
ized rehabilitation. Stout et al. (2012) [58] stated that the
current model of care often lacks attention to BC pa-
tients’ physical and functional wellbeing and have devel-
oped a model for prospective surveillance focusing on
physical and functional limitations. Their model provides
a broad approach to physical and functional rehabilita-
tion that includes evaluation, education, re-assessment
and ongoing surveillance for early identification and
management of impairments. This is in line with the
current study’s comprehensive approach to rehabilitation.
Most SRs included in this study were related to lym-
phoedema treatment and several treatments were inves-
tigated. Lymphoedema is a common problem following
BC treatment. According to Stuiver et al. (2015) [47],
preventive strategies seem to be more beneficial when
started earlier rather than late. This indicates the im-
portance of close and frequent monitoring after BC sur-
gery. Patients with lymphoedema often require specialist
care and resistance training appears to be safe and bene-
ficial, mainly for volume reduction and increased muscle
strength. However, the complexity in this area calls for
team interventions with an individualized approach.

results

Rehabilitation interventions are designed to optimize
functioning and reduce disability in individuals with
health conditions in interaction with their environment.
Finding a way to adapt to the new life situation and re-
turn to work is therefore a complex but important ques-
tion both for the individual and for society. However,
evidence on effective interventions to support return to
work among patients with BC is sparse and it has been
stated that employment status and work performance is
associated with a combination of individual factors, the
work environment, culture, and resources [59], indicat-
ing the need for individualized rehabilitation. It is also
well known that the rehabilitation needs following BC
treatment vary greatly among individuals. Since BC is
common and many women are in need of rehabilitation,
individualization becomes a major issue in the effort to
optimize rehabilitation and use available resources as ef-
fectively as possible. To enable this, it is fundamental to
provide clinicians with extended knowledge about the
effectiveness of different interventions for specific out-
comes. Within the BC rehabilitation area a great amount
of research is available. However, there is still a gap

between rehabilitation research and practice which em-
phasis further research focusing on dissemination and
implementation of available research findings. This SR
of SRs extends the knowledge base by providing a com-
prehensive

Strengths and limitations
One way to make evidence available to HCPs and clin-
ical decision makers is by providing them with a sum-
mary of available evidence through a SR of SRs. The
purpose of such a review is to identify and review all
published reviews within a specific field and rate their
quality, summarize and compare their conclusions, and
discuss the strength of these [14]. Through such an ap-
proach, the present SR of SRs provides a comprehensive
evidence base for the development of individualized re-
habilitation. This is greatly needed in the area of BC re-
habilitation, which has a large number of available
studies with often divergent interventions and results.

Systematic reviews evaluating the effect of healthcare
interventions often include both RCTs and NRSI. There-
fore, this SR of SRs used the AMSTAR 2 tool [15] that is
a critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews that were
developed to evaluate methodological quality in both
RCTs and NRSI. To assure interrater agreement, Kappa
coefficient were evaluated and 14 out of 18 evaluated
items were graded as having a perfect or substantial
agreement which indicate a small difference between
raters. Assessing the methodological quality is necessary
to establish a sound foundation for the analysis and re-
sults. However, the AMSTAR 2 tool consists of some
items that could be of limited relevance/or are not de-
scribed in the included SRs. This means that SR within
the rehabilitating area are likely to get a lower grading
due to e.g. that blinding is only possible at allocation
and outcome level or that comparators are not described
since it is considered the absence of the intervention.
This is likely to affect the methodological grading and
needs to be taken in account when interpreting the
results.

A potential limitation of this SR of SRs is that when
including both SR and meta-analyses there is a risk that
the same studies may have been included in more than
one SR. Therefore, we chose not to draw conclusions on
the number of SRs presented within each area or based
on the study design. However, the inclusion of both SRs
and meta-syntheses enables a broader scope and a more
comprehensive approach to BC rehabilitation compared
with other SRs.

Another limitation is the variation in and descriptions
of the included cohort of patients within each SR, for ex-
ample regarding where in the cancer trajectory the pa-
tients were, whether they were undergoing active cancer

treatment or not and what kind of treatment they had
received. Based on this variation, an evaluation of effects
was only identified within some of the areas and was
then related to where the patients were in their cancer
trajectory. This is a limitation and needs to be taken into
consideration when interpreting the results and it em-
phasizes the need for further studies in the field. How-

to enable

The level of detail in the description of the results in
the various areas is based on the heterogeneity of the in-
cluded interventions. For example, yoga, compared with
the other rehabilitation areas, may be considered a fairly
homogeneous intervention and therefore subgroup ana-
lyses are possible, enabling a more detailed description
of who needs what, and when. On the other hand, CAM
interventions are heterogeneous, which prevents detailed
descriptions that are of clinical relevance.

Conclusions
The result summarizes the available evidence and under-
pins findings of the positive effects of exercise and PA
and yoga for women following BC treatment. It also ex-
tends knowledge about the effects of CAM, lymphoe-
dema treatment and psychosocial
interventions in BC
rehabilitation. It is evident that more than one interven-
tion could have positive effects on a specific symptom or
problem and that the effects depend not only on inter-
vention type, but also on how and when the intervention
is provided. The results could be used as a foundation
for individualized rehabilitation and may aid HCPs in
meeting patients’ individual needs and preferences.
