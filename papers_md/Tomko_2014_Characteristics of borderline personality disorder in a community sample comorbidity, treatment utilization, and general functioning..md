Abstract

This study provides estimates of the prevalence and demographic features of borderline
personality disorder (BPD) in a community sample as well as BPD comorbidity rates with Axis I
and II disorders. In addition, the authors provide data on general functioning and treatment
seeking among individuals with BPD. Data from 34,481 participants in the National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were analyzed. Results
suggest that 2.7% of adults in the United States meet diagnostic criteria for BPD, with slightly
higher rates of the disorder in females, people in lower income brackets, people younger than 30,
and individuals who are separated or divorced. Racial/ethnic differences were evident, with Native
Americans (5.0%) and Blacks (3.5%) having significantly higher rates of the disorder, on average,
and Asians having significantly lower rates (1.2%). Individuals with a BPD diagnosis were likely
to have co-occurring lifetime mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and other
personality disorders. Specifically, 84.8% of individuals with BPD also had a lifetime anxiety
disorder, 82.7% had a lifetime mood disorder/episode, and 78.2% were diagnosed with a lifetime
substance use disorder. Individuals with BPD showed significant impairment in functioning and
were highly likely to seek therapy or receive medication for mental health concerns.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe form of psychopathology characterized by
instability of affect, impulsivity, self-harm, chaotic interpersonal relationships, and identity
disturbance (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000; Paris, 2009). Most research
estimates that BPD occurs in 1–3% of nonclinical samples (Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger,
& Kessler, 2007; Torgerson, Kringlen, & Cramer, 2001; Trull, Jahng, Tomko, Wood, &
Sher, 2010) and in up to 10% of outpatient populations (Zimmerman, Rothschild, &
Chelminski, 2005). BPD is highly comorbid with other Axis I and II disorders (e.g.,
Koenigsberg, Kaplan, Gilmore, & Cooper, 1985; Shea et al., 2004; Sher & Trull, 2002). In
addition, BPD is often associated with poorer treatment outcomes except when patients are
given specialized forms of psychosocial treatment (Paris, 2009).

Due to the severity of the disorder and the implications for public health, it is essential to
accurately identify the demographic features of BPD, its comorbid conditions, and treatment
trends within a community sample. Most studies of BPD and BPD features have used
college students and individuals recruited from treatment settings, or have had too few
community participants from which to reliably estimate prevalence rates. For these reasons,
accurate estimates of the disorder’s prevalence and comorbidity rates in the general
population are largely unknown. Furthermore, there are few estimates of the level of
functioning and treatment trends for representative samples of those with BPD.

BPD-AXIS I COMORBIDITY

BPD is highly comorbid with a number of Axis I disorders in both clinical and community
samples (Coid, Yang, Tyrer, Roberts, & Ullrich, 2006; Lenzenweger et al., 2007; Skodol,
Gunderson, Pfohl, et al., 2002). BPD is distinct from many conditions in that it has
commonalities with both internalizing and externalizing disorders (e.g., Eaton et al., 2010).
Concerning internalizing disorders, features of BPD such as affective instability, emptiness,
and interpersonal difficulties may be driving the high rates of comorbidity between BPD and
mood/anxiety disorders.

Concerning externalizing disorders, previous research has established a strong link between
PDs and substance use disorders (SUDs); BPD and antisocial PD (ASPD) have the greatest
overlap with SUDs (e.g., Sher & Trull, 2002; Trull, Sher, Minks-Brown, Durbin, & Burr,
2000). To the extent that BPD is related to impulse control disorders, we might expect that
BPD also shares genetic risk with both ASPD and SUD and falls on an externalizing factor
of psychopathology. However, BPD is not generally considered to be solely an externalizing
disorder (Eaton et al., 2010). Thus, the BPD–SUD co-occurrence may be explained by a
combination of impulsivity and negative emotionality (Sher & Trull, 2002; Skodol, Siever,
et al., 2002; Trull et al., 2000).

BPD-AXIS II COMORBIDITY

In addition to extensive Axis I comorbidity, BPD is highly comorbid with other Axis II
disorders (Bell & Jackson, 1992; Cohen, Chen, Crawford, Brook, & Gordon, 2007;
Lenzenweger et al., 2007; McGlashan, Grilo, & Skodol, 2000; Westen & Shedler, 1999).
For example, Lenzenweger and colleagues (2007) found BPD to have an average tetrachoric
correlation of .56 with Cluster A PDs and .55 with Cluster C PDs. Although there were no
instances of histrionic or narcissistic PD in this sample, the correlation with the remaining
Cluster B PD, ASPD, was the highest at .64.

GENERAL FUNCTIONING AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

UTILIZATION IN BPD

BPD is not only associated with more impairment than many psychiatric disorders (Ansell,
Sanislow, McGlashan, & Grilo, 2007), but this impairment also appears to be more stable
over time (Skodol et al., 2005). Specifically, individuals with BPD show impaired
functioning in social relationships, occupation, and leisure activities (Ansell et al., 2007;

Skodol et al., 2005). They are also more likely to have legal problems and financial
difficulties (Coid et al., 2009). Consistent with BPD being a severely debilitating condition,
individuals with the disorder frequent mental health treatment settings more so than
individuals with mood, anxiety, or other personality disorders (Ansell et al., 2007). For
example, a large epidemiological study in Great Britain estimated that 56.3% of individuals
with BPD had sought help from a professional for mental health concerns in the past year
(Coid et al., 2009).

THE CURRENT STUDY

The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) is a
recent, large national face-to-face survey conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) that provides a unique opportunity to explore the
distribution of BPD and its correlates in a large representative sample of U.S. residents.
Earlier, Grant et al. (2008) reported information about comorbidity and general functioning
among NESARC respondents with BPD. However, Trull et al. (2010) proposed an
alternative PD diagnostic scoring algorithm for the NESARC data, which resulted in
markedly different prevalence estimates for PDs than those reported in previous NESARC
publications. Because Grant and colleagues (2008) used more liberal diagnostic rules, they
estimated a community prevalence rate of BPD around 5.9%. This prevalence rate is much
higher than estimates found in previous community samples (e.g., Lenzenweger et al., 2007;
Torgerson et al., 2001; Trull et al., 2010). Due to these seemingly higher prevalence
estimates of BPD, it is likely that individuals with subthreshold BPD were included in the
estimate by Grant et al., potentially clouding the comorbidity picture, as well as assessments
of functioning and treatment utilization.

Using the alternative scoring system for personality disorder diagnosis proposed by Trull et
al. (2010), we will (a) examine demographic correlates of the BPD diagnosis; (b) provide
estimates of the association between BPD and both Axis I and II diagnoses; (c) examine
levels of impairment of those with BPD diagnosis; and (d) determine rates of health care
utilization.

Data from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the NESARC were used for the present analyses. The
NESARC is a face-to-face, nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized U.S.
citizens designed to assess the prevalence and correlates of alcohol use and alcohol use
disorders in the nation (http://niaaa.census.gov/). Wave 1 data collection was conducted
from 2001 to 2002, and participants (N = 43,093) were sampled according to 2000–2001
census data. Stratified sampling methods were used for demographic and population
features, and the data were weighted to account for the oversampling of particular
demographic subgroups of the population (see Grant, Kaplan, Shepard, & Moore, 2003). At
Wave 2 (2004–2005), attempts were made to recontact and reinterview participants; a total
of 34,653 individuals provided Wave 2 data. An average of 1,113 days elapsed between
interviews for participants (Elbogen & Johnson, 2009). In the present analyses, Wave 1 data

were used only when the psychiatric disorder of interest was not assessed independently at
Wave 2 (i.e., seven of the personality disorders, as described here).

Participants in the current analyses (n = 34,481) included individuals who participated in
both Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the NESARC and provided information on all items necessary
to assess for DSM-IV BPD. All individuals were 18 years of age or older at Wave 1. Young
adults (ages 18 to 25), African Americans, and Hispanic Americans were oversampled. The
demographic information for the sample is presented in Table 1 for BPD and non-BPD
participants.

The NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV
Version (AUDADIS-IV) was used to assess for PD, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and
substance use disorder symptoms. With the exception of the personality disorders (see
below), both lifetime and 12-month disorders were assessed at each wave of the study. In
this report, we focus on lifetime Axis I disorders.

Personality Disorder Assessment—Lifetime PD symptoms and diagnoses were
determined using the AUDADIS-IV. Interview questions were keyed to DSM-IV PD criteria
and asked respondents about long-term patterns of cognition, emotional experience, and
behavior that were context-free and not limited to periods of depression, mania, anxiety,
heavy drinking, medication or drug influence, or withdrawal (Grant, Hasin, et al., 2004).
Wave 1 of the NESARC included lifetime measurement of antisocial, avoidant, dependent,
histrionic, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders. Borderline,
narcissistic, and schizotypal PD were assessed at Wave 2, and antisocial PD was assessed a
second time (incorporating Wave 1 diagnostic information). Diagnostic criteria for each PD
were measured by asking participants whether each DSM-IV PD criterion, as assessed by at
least one interview question, was (a) descriptive of the participant (0 = no, 1 = yes) and (b) a
cause of problems at work/school or in personal relationships (0 = no, 1 = yes). In the
present study, PD diagnoses were assigned to those individuals meeting the requisite number
of criteria associated with significant distress, impairment, or dysfunction for the disorder
(e.g., four or more of the seven diagnostic criteria for paranoid PD). These diagnostic rules
produced lower prevalence rates of PDs, as well as higher comorbidity with substance
dependence, than the original AUDADIS diagnostic rules for PDs, which only required at
least one of the requisite number of PD symptoms to have caused social or occupational
dysfunction (see Trull et al., 2010). Our more conservative PD diagnostic decision rules did
produce prevalence estimates roughly similar to those obtained from other nationally
representative diagnostic interview-based studies conducted in Great Britain (Coid et al.,
2006) and in the United States (National Comorbidity Survey Replication, NCS-R;
Lenzenweger et al., 2007).

Previous reports indicate that 10-week test–retest reliability estimates for the seven Wave 1
PD diagnoses were fair to good (Grant, Dawson, et al., 2003). Kappas for diagnoses ranged
from .40 to .67, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for PD symptom counts ranged

from .55 to .79. Concerning the three Wave 2 PDs (borderline, narcissistic, schizotypal), 6-
week test–retest reliabilities for diagnoses ranged from .67 to .71 (kappas) and for symptom
counts ranged from .71 to .75 (ICCs) (Ruan et al., 2008).

Mood and Anxiety Disorder Assessment—Lifetime mood episodes included in the
current analyses include major depressive disorder, dysthymia, mania, and hypomania.
Lifetime anxiety disorders included panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), social
phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder.
Previous studies suggest that these diagnostic categories have adequate test–retest reliability
and validity (Canino et al., 1999; Grant, Dawson, et al., 2003; Grant, Harford, Dawson,
Chou, & Pickering, 1995).

Substance Use Disorder Assessment—Lifetime diagnoses were assessed for
substance abuse, dependence, and SUDs. Specifically, the AUDADIS assessed for alcohol,
nicotine (dependence only), opioid, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, cannabis, hallucinogens,
tranquilizer, sedative, inhalant/solvent, and “other” drug abuse and dependence. If a
participant met criteria for abuse or dependence for any of the aforementioned substances,
he or she was diagnosed with a “substance use disorder.” If the substance of abuse/
dependence was something other than alcohol or nicotine, the participant was also diagnosed
with a “drug use disorder.” Previous research has suggested adequate to good test–retest
reliabilities for AUDADIS alcohol and drug diagnoses (Grant et al., 1995; Hasin, Carpenter,
Mc-Cloud, Smith, & Grant, 1997).

Treatment Utilization—Participants who met criteria for any Axis I disorder or episode
were asked follow-up treatment utilization questions tailored to their specific symptoms. For
example, if a respondent endorsed depression, these questions included, “Have you ever had
a doctor prescribe you medication to improve your mood?,” “Have you ever seen a doctor,
therapist, counselor, or other person for help improving your mood?,” “Have you ever
stayed overnight in a hospital for low mood?,” and “Have you ever gone to an emergency
room because of low mood?”

General Functioning—Three items from the Wave 2 interview were used as indicators of
interpersonal functioning. These included dichotomous items (yes/no) concerning divorce or
separation in the previous 12 months, serious problems with a boss or employer in the
previous 12 months, and serious problems with neighbors, friends, or relatives in the past 12
months. In addition, those who endorsed depression were asked about suicide attempts,
suicidal ideation, wanting to die, and thinking a lot about one’s own death both over their
lifetime as well as since the Wave 1 interview.

Finally, the Short Form 12 Health Survey-Version 2 (SF12-V2; Gandek et al., 1998a, 1998b;
Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996), administered at Wave 2, was also used to assess various
forms of functioning, including mental health, social functioning, role emotional
functioning, physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, general health, and role physical
functioning. The role emotional and physical functioning subscales assessed role and
occupational impairment due to emotional or physical problems. For example, one item

asked, “In the past 4 weeks, how often did you accomplish less than you would have liked as
a result of emotional problems?” Higher scores on the subscales represent better functioning.

PROCEDURE

Data Collection—Lay interviewers from the U.S. Bureau of Census were employed for
the NESARC door-to-door interview process (Grant, Kaplan, et al., 2003). Each interviewer
completed 10 days of training prior to interviewing participants. Interviewers were supplied
with laptop interview software with automatic skipouts and consistency checks. Regional
supervisors re-contacted 10% of the sample to ensure interviewer protocol compliance.

Analytic Approach—SAS™ 9.2 was used to compute all prevalence rates and odds ratios,
as well as to conduct regression analyses. All analyses were conducted separately for men
and women. Because individuals of certain sociodemographic characteristics were
oversampled in the NESARC, all analyses were weighted to reflect true population
estimates. First, we computed the prevalence of BPD given lifetime psychiatric disorders
and then the prevalence of lifetime psychiatric disorders given BPD. The prevalence of BPD
among lifetime treatment seekers and lifetime treatment utilization was determined
similarly. Second, to index overall levels of association, we computed the odds ratios
between BPD and other psychiatric disorders as well as types of treatment. A stricter 99%
confidence interval was used for the odds ratios due to the large sample size. Finally,
multiple linear regression analyses were used to predict functioning (i.e., social, emotional,
physical) from BPD diagnostic status while controlling for the presence of current Axis I
disorders, lifetime personality disorders, and demographics. For the functioning scales that
pertain to physical health (i.e., physical functioning, role physical functioning, vitality,
bodily pain, and general health), we controlled for past year medical conditions in the
model.

RESULTS

DEMOGRAPHICS

An estimated 2.7% (95% CI = 2.5–3.0) of the U.S. population meets criteria for BPD, with
slightly elevated rates of the disorder in females (3.0%, 95% CI = 2.7–3.3 versus 2.4%, 95%
CI = 2.2–2.7 in males), individuals with a family income less than $20,000 per year (4.8%,
95% CI = 4.2–5.4), people younger than 30 (4.3%, 95% CI = 3.6–5.0), and individuals who
are separated, divorced, or widowed (4.5%, 95% CI = 3.9–5.0). Sex differences were
evident such that males in the lowest income bracket were significantly more likely to have
BPD than females in the same income bracket (p < .001), men with BPD were more likely to
be separated or divorced (p < .001) while women were more likely to be married or in a
relationship (p < .001), and BPD was more prevalent among women between the ages of 30
and 44 than among men in that age range (p = .003). Racial/ethnic differences were evident,
with Native Americans (5.0%, 95% CI = 3.2–6.9) and Blacks (3.5%, 95% CI = 2.9–4.1)
reporting higher rates of the disorder, on average, than Whites (2.7%, 95% CI = 2.4–2.9) or
Hispanics (2.5%, 95% CI = 2.0–3.0), and Asian Americans having a significantly lower rate
(1.2%, 95% CI = 0.4–2.0). Individuals with less than a high school education also showed
slightly elevated rates of BPD (3.3%, 95% CI = 2.7–3.9) compared to those with at least a

high school degree. Urban and rural respondents showed similar rates of the disorder (2.8%,
95% CI = 2.4–3.2, vs. 2.6%, 95% CI = 2.1–3.1, respectively). Regional differences were
also minimal, and no significant region × sex difference was found.

In an earlier study using a different diagnostic algorithm for BPD in the NESARC data set,
Grant et al. (2008) reported an overall BPD prevalence rate of 5.9%, with women showing a
slightly, but not significantly, higher prevalence rate than men (6.2% vs. 5.6%). Similar to
our findings, younger individuals, those with lower family incomes, and individuals who
were separated, divorced, or widowed showed significantly higher prevalence rates of BPD.
Finally, similar to the present findings, significantly higher prevalence rates of BPD were
observed among Native Americans and among those with lower educational attainment.

COMORBIDITY1

Table 2 presents the odds ratios between BPD and lifetime Axis I and II disorders. All odds
ratios were significant except the associations between BPD with alcohol abuse and BPD
with substance abuse. It is worth noting that the associations of BPD with alcohol
dependence as well as substance dependence were significant, however (OR = 5.38, 99% CI
= 4.37–6.58; OR = 5.29, 99% CI = 4.27–6.54, respectively). Of these significant odds ratios,
only one sex difference was evident. Men with BPD were significantly more likely to have
panic disorder without agoraphobia (OR = 7.52, 99% CI = 4.88–11.49) than women with
BPD (OR = 4.22, 99% CI = 3.09–5.78). Odds ratios presented in Table 2 also show that
BPD was most highly associated with schizotypal, narcissistic, and dependent personality
disorders.2

We cannot directly compare the current odds ratios to those reported by Grant et al. (2008)
because Grant et al. controlled for a number of sociodemographic characteristics and other
psychiatric disorders in their analyses. We chose not to control for these variables in order to
present a pure descriptive picture. However, we can examine the patterns of comorbidity
within studies. Despite differences in prevalence rate of BPD, the patterns in odds ratios are
comparable to those reported by Grant et al., with a few exceptions. We estimated similar
odds ratios between BPD and any mood disorder (OR = 14.93) as between BPD and any
anxiety disorder (OR = 14.29), suggesting that both are approximately equally likely to
occur. Grant et al. reported slightly higher odds for mood disorders than for anxiety
disorders (OR = 9.1, OR = 7.7 respectively), controlling for demographics. They also found
that dysthymia (OR = 2.5) is slightly more likely to occur than major depressive disorder
(OR = 3.2) among those with BPD, while we found the reverse pattern (see Table 2).

1We obtained a similar pattern of results (albeit lower comorbidity rates in general) when examining BPD comorbidity with both
lifetime and 12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorder diagnoses. Tables presenting these results are available from the
corresponding author. Individuals with BPD showed high rates of lifetime psychiatric disorders, with the majority of individuals
meeting criteria for BPD reporting a comorbid Axis I disorder during their lifetime. Specifically, 84.8% (SE = 1.36) of individuals
with BPD had a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis, with posttraumatic stress disorder being the most frequent anxiety disorder. Of
those with BPD, 82.7% (SE = 1.44) had a lifetime mood episode, with a major depressive episode being the most common; 78.2% (SE
= 1.53) had a lifetime substance use disorder. BPD was most common among individuals diagnosed with lifetime panic disorder with
agoraphobia (24.8%, SE = 2.06), mania (22.0%, SE = 1.18), and drug dependence (18.5%, SE = 1.46). About half (52.6%, SE = 1.93)
of the individuals with a BPD diagnosis had at least one other personality disorder diagnosis. The most common comorbid PDs were
narcissistic (19.9%, SE = 1.48), antisocial (18.4%, SE = 1.56), schizotypal (16.3%, SE = 1.36), and paranoid (15.5%, SE = 1.36).
2Borderline, narcissistic, schizotypal, and antisocial personality disorders were all assessed at Wave 2 of the NESARC. Thus, the
higher comorbidity rates between these disorders may be partially due to a method effect. See Discussion.

Finally, they reported higher odds for comorbid paranoid PD (OR = 5.8) than for comorbid
schizoid PD (OR = 4.5), whereas we found the reverse pattern (see Table 2).

TREATMENT UTILIZATION

Individuals with BPD report high rates of lifetime mental health treatment utilization (see
Table 3). Individuals with BPD are highly likely to seek mental health services, with 74.9%
(SE = 1.67) presenting to a physician, therapist, counselor, or other mental health
professional for diagnosable mental health concerns (OR = 10.53, 99% CI = 8.33–13.33).
Similarly, 63.1% (SE = 1.87) of individuals diagnosed with BPD were prescribed
medication for mental health issues. Although women had slightly elevated rates of
treatment utilization, the odds ratio was not significantly different from that of men.

Our results suggest that approximately 8.7% (SE = 0.37) of individuals with an Axis I
disorder who present for outpatient treatment from a mental health professional also have
BPD (see Table 3). The percentage of patients with BPD increases in an inpatient or drug/
alcohol rehabilitation setting (15.2%, SE = 0.88). Approximately 14.5% (SE = 0.87) of
individuals with an Axis I disorder that present to an emergency room or crisis center with a
mental health issue have diagnosable BPD. The odds of having BPD and receiving mental
health treatment range from 8.55 (medication usage) to 10.53 (see mental health
professional), depending on the type of treatment received (Table 3).

GENERAL FUNCTIONING

Concerning interpersonal functioning, a lifetime diagnosis of BPD was significantly
associated with reports of separation or divorce over the preceding 12 months (OR = 4.48;
99% CI = 3.40–5.88), with having significant trouble with one’s boss or employer (OR =
4.33; 99% CI = 3.40–5.49), and with having serious problems with neighbors, friends, or
relatives (OR = 7.14; 99% CI = 5.62–9.90). Among those endorsing depression/low mood at
Wave 2, a BPD diagnosis was also significantly associated with attempted suicide (OR =
6.7; 99% CI = 4.3–10.6), presence of suicidal ideation (OR = 5.3; 99% CI = 4.1–6.9),
wanting to die (OR = 4.9; 99% CI = 3.8–6.4), and thinking a lot about one’s own death (OR
= 3.3; 99% CI = 2.6–4.3) since the Wave 1 interview (i.e., over the past 3 years). No
significant gender differences in these associations were found.

Individuals with BPD showed significant impairment on seven of the eight functioning
scales of the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF12-V2), even after controlling for the
presence of other personality disorders, current Axis I disorders, sociodemographic risk
factors (e.g., age, ethnicity/race, family income), and medical conditions (where relevant).
BPD was a significant predictor of impaired social functioning (M = 39.64, SD = 13.71, B =
−0.07, p < .001), role emotional functioning (M = 38.45, SD = 13.20, B = −0.06, p < .001),
and mental health (M = 38.98, SD = 12.39, B = −0.07, p < .001). BPD did not significantly
predict impairment on the physical functioning scale of the SF12 (M = 46.67, SD = 12.50, B
= −0.01, p = .149). However, BPD was a significant predictor of impairment in role physical
functioning (M = 44.13, SD = 11.88, B = −0.02, p = .001). In addition, BPD significantly
predicted increased bodily pain (M = 43.55, SD = 13.94, B = −0.02, p = .006), poorer
general health (M = 42.93, SD = 13.79, B = −0.02, p = .001), and decreased vitality (B =

−0.03, p < .001). Compared to Grant et al. (2008), it appears that our diagnostic method
indicated lower mean functioning scores, on average, suggesting more severe impairment.
For example, our BPD sample had a mean emotional functioning score of 38.45 and Grant et
al. (2008) reported a mean of 41.6 on this subscale. Overall, we found the same pattern of
impairment as reported by Grant and colleagues (2008).

DISCUSSION

Several important findings emerged from our analyses. First, as noted in our previous
analyses (Trull et al., 2010), we found a lower overall prevalence of BPD (2.7% vs. 5.9%)
than reported in previous studies using NESARC data (Grant et al., 2008). Still, our finding
that approximately 3% of adults meet criteria for a lifetime BPD diagnosis is striking. Given
that those with BPD may incur on average $50,000 per year in health care costs (e.g.,
emergency room visits, physician visits, mental health visits; Bateman & Fonagy, 2003),
this prevalence rate reinforces the perspective that BPD is a major public health problem and
requires more attention as a target of both prevention and treatment. Our findings also
indicate that men and women meet diagnostic criteria for BPD at approximately equal rates.
For some time, it has been assumed that women are much more likely to meet criteria for
BPD than men (as high as a ratio of 3:1). However, epidemiological data from this and other
recent studies (e.g., Lenzenweger et al., 2007) suggest that the previously reported wide
gender disparity in BPD prevalence is likely a result of sampling only clinical patients in
treatment settings.

Our finding that BPD was diagnosed at a higher percentage rate among those under 30 years
old and among those from families with lower incomes is consistent with previous findings.
Studies report that BPD is more prevalent in young adulthood, and that the rates decline
steadily after age 30 (Paris, 2009). This strong age gradient is consistent with studies of
alcohol use disorders (Kessler et al., 2005) and bipolar disorder (Cicero, Epler, & Sher,
2009) and appears to track normative developmental trends in traits related to impulsivity
(e.g., conscientiousness; Roberts, Walton, & Viechtbauer, 2006). In addition, the
impairment and dysfunction associated with BPD might be expected to result in either
unemployment or underemployment, resulting in fewer resources available for families of
adults with BPD.

The racial/ethnicity differences in rates of BPD are more challenging to explain. It is
important to note that there are no previous epidemiological studies on BPD that allow for
prevalence estimates in White, Black, Native American, Asian American, and Hispanic
populations in the United States. We found BPD more prevalent among Native Americans
and African Americans, while the rate for BPD in Asian Americans was significantly lower
than that for White Americans. Concerning the elevated rates of BPD in Native Americans,
they were twice as likely as White Americans to endorse the BPD symptom “recurrent
suicidal behavior, threats, or self-harm,” and more than 10% of the Native American sample
endorsed “unstable, intense interpersonal relationships,” “impulsivity,” and “anger
problems.” Some of these disparities may be understood in terms of previous findings that
Native Americans endorse higher rates of alcohol abuse and dependence, higher levels of
mental distress, and higher rates of exposure to traumatic stress than those in the general

population (Alcántara & Gone, 2007; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1998;
Pole, Gone, & Kulkarni, 2008).

Concerning comorbidity, BPD showed the strongest associations with lifetime mood
episodes (especially major depressive episodes and mania) and with lifetime anxiety
disorders (especially panic disorder with agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and
posttraumatic stress disorder). BPD was significantly associated with a range of other
personality disorders, especially schizotypal, narcissistic, and dependent. Overall, these
comorbidity findings are consistent with those obtained in other epidemiological samples as
well as in clinical samples (Lenzenweger et al., 2007; Paris, 2009). Furthermore, they
suggest that even in community samples, BPD is rarely diagnosed alone. Such comorbidity,
in turn, is associated with impairment and dysfunction.

Indeed, BPD was significantly associated with almost all indices of impairment that we
examined, and this was true even after controlling for age, ethnicity/race, other
sociodemographic risk factors, physical conditions, and other Axis I and Axis II diagnoses.
Those with BPD were significantly more likely to report interpersonal conflict and problems
in the previous 12 months (with romantic partners, with employers, and with neighbors,
friends, or relatives), and reported significantly lower levels of functioning in a variety of
domains.

A large majority of BPD respondents sought mental health treatment, with outpatient
therapy or consultation with a mental health professional being the most common form. The
lifetime rate of receiving therapy/consultation among individuals with BPD is 74.9%, which
is similar to the 10-year therapy utilization rate of 73% reported by Hörz, Zanarini,
Frankenburg, Riech, and Fitzmaurice (2010). As expected, the lifetime rate substantially
exceeds past year reports from other epidemiological studies (Coid et al., 2009). Although
the rate of those with BPD who seek treatment is perhaps not surprising, one intriguing
finding is that the rate of BPD among those seeking mental health treatment in an inpatient/
rehabilitation setting or in an emergency room/crisis center was approximately 15%. These
findings suggest that it is especially important to assess for BPD and BPD symptoms in
these settings in order to provide the most appropriate treatment (Paris, 2009).

Overall, these results suggest that BPD is a common diagnosis among community residents,
and it is associated with other serious mental health conditions, high levels of impairment,
and treatment seeking in a variety of contexts. Therefore, these results support the position
that BPD is a public health problem and one that deserves more attention from policy-
makers, researchers, and clinicians alike. Before concluding, however, it is important to
acknowledge several limitations to the current study. First, our results are limited by the
assessment methodology of the NESARC study. Because of feasibility concerns, trained lay
interviewers and not clinicians were used to collect diagnostic data. There is some
controversy about the use of lay interviewers versus clinicians in diagnostic research.
However, as noted earlier, the NESARC investigators have presented evidence supporting
the reliability and validity of the ratings. Some have criticized that the NESARC assessment
of personality disorders did not include verbatim items from existing Axis II interviews
(Lenzenweger et al., 2007). Although true, it is worth noting that NESARC personality

disorder items were generated after examining both existing interviews and the DSM-IV
criteria for personality disorders. Furthermore, as it turns out, the agreement among existing,
traditional Axis II interviews (often held up as gold standards) is moderate to poor (e.g.,
Farmer, 2000). Clearly, more research is needed to evaluate the validity of all Axis II
interviews, including NESARC items. Second, not all personality disorders were assessed in
the same wave of data collection; seven were assessed at Wave 1 and four at Wave 2
(However, only previously denied ASPD symptoms were assessed at Wave 2). Because of
this, estimates of comorbidity rates across PDs are to some extent confounded with method
factors associated with measurement occasion, making it difficult to compare comorbidity
rates across PDs. According to these data, BPD appears to be highly comorbid with
narcissistic and schizotypal PDs, both of which were assessed at Wave 2. Additional studies
are clearly necessary to replicate these findings concerning personality disorder comorbidity,
given that it may be reasonable to believe that some personality disorders are
developmentally graded as a function of age. Third, NESARC participants were asked
treatment utilization questions only if they endorsed certain psychiatric disorder symptoms
(Axis I only). The treatment items specifically asked if participants sought treatment for the
symptoms they had endorsed. Participants were not asked if they sought therapy or other
mental health services for interpersonal problems or in response to the PD symptom
endorsement. Thus, treatment utilization rates presented here may be underestimated. Lastly,
lifetime diagnoses require respondents to retrospect, often over many years. Thus, the
NESARC 12-month disorders Axis I disorders may be more reliable than the lifetime
disorders because they require less retrospection. However, we chose to report lifetime
prevalence rates of Axis I disorders given that the personality disorders were assessed over
the lifetime as well. In this way, comparable periods of time were covered in each Axis I and
Axis II assessment. The lifetime perspective also should serve to minimize the
methodological bias occasioned by different times of assessment for different personality
disorders.

The groups significantly differed on mean age (p < .0001), with the BPD group (M = 41.8) being significantly younger than the Non-BPD group
(M = 49.2).

b

2.9% of the current sample meets criteria for BPD. This differs from the 2.7% estimated prevalence rate of BPD due to weighting of the data in

order to reflect the true population.
