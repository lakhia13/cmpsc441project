Abstract

Few studies have compared atypical sensory characteristics and food selectivity between children 
with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We compared oral sensory processing between 
children with (n=53) and without ASD (n=58), ages 3–11 years. We also examined the 
relationships between atypical oral sensory processing, food selectivity, and fruit/vegetable 
consumption in children with ASD. We found that more children with ASD presented with 
atypical sensory processing than children without ASD. Among children with ASD, those with 
atypical oral sensory sensitivity refused more foods and ate fewer vegetables than those with 
typical oral sensory sensitivity. The findings suggest that efforts to address food selectivity in 
children with ASD may be enhanced by including strategies that address oral sensory processing.

Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability characterized by deficits in 
communication, social interaction, and restrictive, repetitive behavioral patterns that impair 
social, occupational, and daily functioning (American Psychiatric Association 2013). This 
disorder is also often associated with sensory processing difficulties, which includes over- or 
under-sensitivity to sensory stimuli in the environment. The prevalence of ASD in the United 
States is currently estimated to affect 1 in 68 children with higher rates among males and 
non-Hispanic whites (Christensen et al. 2016). ASD poses a major health and educational 
challenge for parents and caretakers as it affects many aspects of daily living. Feeding and 
mealtimes are especially challenging for these children and their caretakers (Curtin et al. 
2015; Zobel-Lachiusa et al. 2015). Parents and clinicians frequently report that children with 
ASD are overly selective in their eating patterns; they consume less varied diets with very 
few fruits and vegetables (Ahearn et al. 2001; Bandini et al. 2010; Cermak et al. 2010; 
Emond et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2008; Ledford & Gast 2006; Marí-Bauset et al. 2014; 
Martins et al. 2008; Ranjan & Nasser 2015; Schreck et al. 2004; Sharp et al. 2013; Zimmer 
et al. 2012). The lack of food variety may put individuals at risk for nutritional inadequacies 
(Bandini et al. 2010; Ma et al. 2016; Zimmer et al. 2012). One recent review estimated that 
children with ASD have a five-fold risk of feeding problems compared to children without 
ASD (Sharp et al. 2013). While longitudinal data are limited, two recent studies suggest that 
food selective behaviors may persist over time (Bandini et al. 2017; Suarez et al. 2014). 
Therefore, addressing the underlying factors associated with food selectivity may be 
necessary to mitigate the comorbidities associated with long-term inadequate nutritional 
intake in this population.

In recent years, it has been suggested that food selectivity in individuals with ASD may be 
related to sensory processing dysfunction, specifically oral sensory sensitivity (Cermak et al. 
2010; Suarez 2012; Zobel-Lachiusa et al. 2015). Sensory processing refers to the ability to 
register, process, and organize sensory information and to execute appropriate responses to 
environmental demands, which may manifest as over- or under-sensitivity to the stimuli 
(Dunn, 2001). Atypical sensory processing has been a recognized feature of ASD since the 
condition was first described by Kanner (1943), occurring in 45–95% in persons with ASD 
(Ben-Sasson et al. 2009; Schreck & Williams 2006; Tomchek & Dunn 2007). Anecdotal 
reports from parents of children with ASD and autobiographies of individuals with ASD 
often attribute food selectivity to aversions to color, taste, smell, and/or texture, which 
suggests an underlying sensory component to this behavior (Shore 2001; Whiteley et al. 
2000; Williams et al. 2000). Several studies have suggested that sensory sensitivity may lead 
children with ASD to restrict their intake to foods of preferred, tolerable, and manageable 
textures. The texture of foods has consistently been identified as a related aspect of food 
acceptance. (Ahearn et al. 2001; Hubbard et al. 2014; Postorino et al. 2015; Schreck & 
Williams 2006; Schreck et al. 2004; Williams et al. 2005). For example, using data from the 
current study, Hubbard et al. (2014) found that texture and consistency of foods are highly 
correlated with parent report of food refusal in a sample of 53 children with ASD ages 3–11

years. While a small number of studies have suggested that there is a significant relationship 
between atypical oral sensory processing and food selectivity in children with ASD, the 
methodologies used to elucidate this relationship have been limited by the use of parent 
report of food selectivity rather than the use of validated dietary measures. For example, 
studies have used a variety of parent-report tools such as the Eating Profile (Nadon et al. 
2011), the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (Kral et al. 2015), the Brief Assessment of 
Mealtime Behavior Inventory (BAMBI) (Lane et al. 2014) or a single question about food 
selectivity on a parent questionnaire (Suarez et al. 2014). The inconsistency in measures and 
the lack of a standardized definition of food selectivity limits the ability to compare results 
across studies.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between oral sensory 
processing and food selectivity in children with ASD using quantitative measures of food 
selectivity. We also included a comparison group of TD children to assess differences in oral 
sensory processing compared to children with ASD. The aims of the study were to: 1) 
compare oral sensory processing function between children with and without ASD; 2) 
examine the relationship between atypical oral sensory processing and food selectivity in 
children with ASD; and 3) examine the relationship between atypical oral sensory 
processing and fruit and vegetable consumption. We hypothesized that atypical oral sensory 
processing would be greater in children with ASD, and would be associated with higher 
levels of food selectivity and with decreased fruit and vegetable variety.

METHODS

This study used data from the Children’s Activity and Meal Patterns Study (CHAMPS), a 
cross-sectional study conducted in 2007–2008 at the University of Massachusetts Medical 
School’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center. CHAMPS was designed to assess and compare 
dietary patterns, mealtimes, and physical activity patterns between children with and without 
ASD. Recruitment, exclusion criteria, and the procedures for verifying participants’ 
diagnosis of ASD have been previously described (Bandini et al. 2010). Participants 
included 53 children with ASD and 58 TD children ages 3–11 years. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Massachusetts Medical and 
parents provided written informed consent.

Parents completed a demographic/medical questionnaire, a Food Frequency Questionnaire 
(FFQ), and a 3-day food record. The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) were used 
to characterize children’s adaptive skills and the Differential Abilities Scales (DAS) were 
administered to assess cognitive ability in children with ASD.

Parents also completed the Sensory Profile (Dunn 1999), a 125-item caregiver questionnaire 
frequently used in clinical practice to identify sensory processing challenges in children with 
ASD. It is a standardized tool that compares the child’s score to data from a reference 
sample of 1,200 children without disabilities and identifies the sensory systems that are 
affected by the child’s sensitivity to stimuli and contribute to functional impairments. 
Parents reported their child’s responses to sensory stimuli using a 5-point Likert scale 
(always, frequently, occasionally, seldom, never). Questions were scored along nine factors

of sensory processing difficulties including Sensory Seeking, Emotionally Reactive, Low 
Endurance/Tone, Oral Sensory Sensitivity, Inattention/Distractibility, Poor Registration, 
Sensory Sensitivity, Sedentary, Fine Motor/Perceptual. Children scoring within the one 
standard deviation, or within the 84th percentile of the reference sample, are classified as 
“Typical”, which indicates typical sensory processing ability for each factor. Children who 
scored one or more standard deviations from the mean of the reference group (>85th 
percentile) were classified as “Atypical”, which is indicative of a likelihood of sensory 
processing difficulty for that factor. Within the Atypical classification, participants were 
further classified as having “probable” sensory processing issues (corresponding to between 
one and two standard deviations below the mean, or between the 2nd and 16th percentiles) or 
a “definite” sensory processing disorder (two standard deviations below the mean, or 
children scoring in the lowest 2%). (Dunn, 1999).

In order to explore the relationship between oral sensory over-sensitivity and food 
selectivity, we analyzed a subset of four questions from the Oral Sensory Sensitivity factor 
that measure over-sensitivity or a low tolerance for taste/smell stimuli (Figure 1) (Dunn 
1999; McIntosh et al. 1999). These items comprised: (1) Avoids certain tastes or food smells 
that are typically part of children’s diets; (2) Will only eat certain tastes; (3) Limits self to 
particular food textures/temperatures; and (4) Picky eater, especially regarding food textures. 
The subscale is scored using the same approach as described above. We refer to this subscale 
as Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity.

Relative to food selectivity, we used a quantitative approach to define this phenomenon that 
includes two distinct domains: food refusal and limited food repertoire (Bandini et al. 2010). 
Briefly, to assess food refusal, parents were asked to complete a modified version of the 
Youth/Adolescent Food Frequency Questionnaire (Rockett et al. 1997). We modified the 
FFQ to measure the refusal and frequency of consumption of 131 common food items 
during the past year based on parent report. The food refusal score was expressed as the 
percentage of foods refused of those offered to the child. Food repertoire was operationally 
defined as the absolute number of unique foods the child consumed (including beverages) 
over three days using a 3-day food record. Parents were asked to complete the 3-day food 
record for two weekdays and one weekend day, including food consumed at school. In 
addition, we examined fruit and vegetable variety, which was determined by the number of 
unique fruits and vegetables consumed on the FFQ, which included 13 fruits and 20 
vegetables.

Data Analysis

Differences in participant characteristics between children with and without ASD were 
compared using independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for 
categorical variables. Differences in sensory processing measures between children with and 
without ASD were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. After 
dichotomizing Oral Sensory Sensitivity and the Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity scores into 
Typical and Atypical, we used independent samples t-tests to compare the mean difference 
in food selectivity measures and fruit and vegetable variety between the groups. Linear 
regression was used to assess the impact of age on the relationship between food selectivity

measures and Typical vs. Atypical sensory sensitivity. Statistical significance was declared 
when p<0.05. All analyses were conducted in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) 
and IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp).

RESULTS

Demographic characteristics of the 53 children with ASD and 58 TD children are presented 
in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or race/ethnicity between the 
two groups. TD children were more likely to be an only child than were children with ASD 
(26% and 11% respectively, p=0.05). However, whether or not a child was an only child was 
unrelated to any aspect of food selectivity. Characteristics of food selectivity for the ASD 
and TD groups are also shown. Compared to the TD group, children with ASD had 
significantly higher levels of food refusal, significantly lower levels of food repertoire, and 
less variety of fruits and vegetables.

To address the question of group differences in sensory processing, we examined scores on 
the Sensory Profile (Table 2). On average, children with ASD scored lower on the Sensory 
Profile than TD children, indicating more atypical sensory processing. Scores between the 
two groups differed significantly across all 9 factors. Mean scores in the TD group were 
classified in the typical performance range for all nine subscales, while mean scores in the 
ASD group fell in the atypical range for seven of nine subscales.

Performance classifications for Oral Sensory Sensitivity and Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity 
for both groups are presented in Table 3. More children with ASD were classified as 
Atypical for Oral Sensory Sensitivity and Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity compared to TD 
children. Among TD children, only 7% were classified as Atypical based on their Oral 
Sensory Sensitivity scores and 9% as Atypical based on their Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity 
scores. Conversely, among children with ASD, 64% were classified as Atypical based on 
their Oral Sensory Sensitivity scores and 66% were classified as Atypical based on their 
Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity scores. Whereas there was no significant difference in mean 
age between the ASD subgroups for Oral Sensory Sensitivity, those characterized as Typical 
on the Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity were slightly older than those characterized as Atypical 
(7.5 years (median=7.9) vs. 6.2 years (median=5.5), p=0.03). Sex was not significantly 
associated with either of these variables.

In order to evaluate the relationship between typical and atypical oral sensory processing 
with food selectivity and fruit/vegetable variety in children with ASD, we stratified measures 
of food selectivity among children with Typical versus Atypical Oral Sensory Sensitivity and 
Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity (Table 4). Analysis of this association was limited to children 
with ASD as the sample size was too small in the Atypical Oral Sensory Sensitivity and Oral 
Sensory Over-sensitivity subgroup among TD children. Children with ASD who scored in 
the Atypical versus Typical range for Oral Sensory Sensitivity had significantly higher levels 
of food refusal (48.2% vs. 33.2%, respectively, p=0.01). Compared to children with ASD 
who scored in the Typical range for Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity, those who scored in the 
Atypical range had twice the level of food refusal (52% vs. 25%, p<0.001).. Fruit variety 
was significantly lower for children who scored in the Atypical versus Typical range for Oral

Sensory Over-sensitivity (5.3 vs. 8.2, p=0.003) but was not significantly different for those 
who scored in the Atypical versus Typical range on the Oral Sensory Sensitivity measure. 
Children who were categorized as Atypical for Oral Sensory Sensitivity and Oral Sensory 
Over-sensitivity had significantly lower levels of vegetable variety compared to children 
who scored in the Typical range (4.2 vs. 8.6 and 4.2 vs. 8.9, p<0.01), respectively. When age 
was included as a covariate in multivariable linear regression models, the statistical 
significance of the findings remained unchanged.

DISCUSSION

Our results are consistent with findings from other studies that demonstrate that children 
with ASD had significantly greater Oral Sensory Sensitivity or Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity 
compared to children without ASD (Ermer & Dunn 1998; Hazen et al. 2014; Leekam et al. 
2007; Nadon et al. 2011; Rogers et al. 2003; Tomchek & Dunn 2007). In our study, the 
majority of children with ASD scored outside the typical range for seven of the nine factors. 
However, scores spanned the entire range of performance classifications for the group 
(typical, probable and definite difference). The distribution of scores across the three 
performance categories is consistent with data reported by earlier studies, which supports the 
increased recognition that children with ASD are not a homogenous population (Brockevelt 
et al. 2013; Tomchek & Dunn 2007; Watling et al. 2001).

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between oral sensory 
sensitivity and food selectivity among children with ASD. We previously reported that 
children with ASD exhibit more food selectivity than their TD peers (Bandini et al. 2010). 
Various factors can contribute to food selectivity and our aim was to evaluate the extent that 
food selectivity relates to atypical oral sensory processing. In the present study, we found 
that children with ASD were more likely than TD children to score in the Atypical range for 
both Oral Sensory Sensitivity and Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity. Among children with ASD, 
those with Atypical Oral Sensory Sensitivity refused more foods and ate fewer vegetables 
compared to those with Typical Oral Sensory Sensitivity. Children with ASD with Atypical 
Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity exhibited more food refusal, a narrower food repertoire, and 
less variety of fruits and vegetables compared to those with Typical Oral Sensory Over-
sensitivity. These data suggest that children with ASD and Oral Sensory Sensitivity, and 
possibly more so with Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity, may exhibit food selectivity and 
restrictive eating behaviors. Children with Oral Sensory Sensitivity may restrict their diet to 
foods with preferred, tolerable, or manageable sensory features (Cermak et al. 2010). Whole 
grains, lean protein, fresh fruits, and vegetables are foods that are nutrient-dense, but often 
characterized by strong flavors and textures; our data support the observation that children 
with ASD who exhibit oral sensory sensitivity may be less likely to accept these types of 
foods, which consequently may put them at risk for inadequate nutrition.

Our findings are consistent with studies that have shown a correlation between sensory 
sensitivity and food selectivity, although prior studies have been limited by the methodology 
for measurement of food selectivity. Using the Sensory Profile, Kral et al. (2015) reported 
that children with ASD had significantly higher levels of oral sensory sensitivity compared 
to TD children, and, among children with ASD, those with atypical oral sensory sensitivity

had significantly greater food neophobia, greater food fussiness, and increased under-eating 
due to negative emotions compared to children with ASD and typical oral sensory 
sensitivity. However, food selectivity was based on parent responses to questions on the 
Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) rather than a quantitative measure of food 
selectivity as was used in our research. Similarly, in a study of 95 children with ASD ages 
3–10 years, Nadon et al. (2011) reported that participants with atypical scores on the Short 
Sensory Profile (SSP) for Taste/Smell Sensitivity had significantly more eating problems 
than children with typical performance, measured using the parent-reported Eating Profile. 
This tool did not directly capture quantitative measures of food selectivity but rather, 
evaluated eating problems across 6 domains focusing on developmental eating milestones, 
mealtime behaviors, impact on the daily life of the family and feeding problems. Lane et al. 
(2014) also found Taste/Smell Sensitivity as measured with the SSP to be significantly 
associated with limited variety (r=−0.73, P<0.05) and food refusal (r=0.46, P<0.01), which 
were measured with the Brief Assessment of Mealtime Behavior Inventory (BAMBI). 
Scores for limited variety, food refusal, and autism-specific behaviors at mealtime on the 
BAMBI were based on parent-report of 18 eating behavior items using a 5-point Likert 
scale. While Lane et al. (2014) included 3-day food records, these were used to determine 
nutrient intake and not to quantify food selectivity. Suarez et al. (2014) conducted one of the 
few longitudinal studies on this topic, reporting that higher levels of hypersensitivity were 
associated with consuming fewer variety of foods, and that this behavior remained stable 
over the 20-month study period. However, food selectivity methodology was again a 
limitation as investigators utilized a questionnaire that asked parents to select a category 
representing how many foods their child accepts as part of his or her regular diet (i.e. less 
than 5, 6–10, 11–20, 21–30, and 30+). In light of the extant literature and the findings for the 
current study, there appears to be convincing evidence to confirm that children with ASD 
with more sensory sensitivity demonstrate higher levels of food selectivity. Practitioners 
working with this population should be aware of this relationship, and the potential impact 
this may have on the quality of the child’s diet.

Our study is one of the first to report a significant association between oral sensory 
processing and variety of fruit and vegetables consumed by children with ASD. Children 
with ASD exhibiting Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity were found to consume significantly less 
variety of fruits and vegetables compared to children with ASD without Oral Sensory Over-
sensitivity. Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet and provide key 
nutrients for growth and development. Previous studies have reported that children with 
ASD consume fewer fruits and vegetables overall (Bandini et al. 2010; Emond et al. 2010; 
Johnson et al. 2008; Martins et al. 2008; Sharp et al. 2013; Suarez & Crinion 2015), and 
authors have speculated that avoidance of fruits and vegetables may be related to their flavor, 
texture, and/or consistency (Cermak et al. 2010; Schreck et al. 2004; Suarez et al. 2014). 
However, few studies have quantified the association between sensory sensitivity and the 
consumption of fruit and vegetables, and no studies have measured this association in 
children with ASD. The findings of our study suggest that efforts to increase consumption of 
fruits and vegetables in this population may be enhanced by including strategies that address 
oral sensory processing.

While our study suggests that there may be sensory processing factors that manifest as food 
selectivity in the child with ASD, additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the nature 
of the relationship. Several studies have proposed neurobiological mechanisms to explain 
how oral sensory sensitivity may result in food selective behaviors. Tavassoli & Baron-
Cohen (2012) reported differences in taste identification as measured using taste strips 
between adults with ASD and a control group. Bennetto, et al. (2007) found that individuals 
with ASD perceived olfaction and taste stimuli differently than those without ASD; however, 
there were no differences in detection thresholds using stimuli presented via electrodes on 
the tongue. Thus, it is possible that individuals with Oral Sensory Sensitivity may present 
with differences in the brain that affect their ability to perceive taste. However, other factors 
may influence food selectivity as well, such as restricted interests and/or behavioral rigidity 
which are frequently characteristic of persons with ASD (Johnson et al. 2014; Schreck et al. 
2004; Suarez et al. 2014). Sharp et al. (2014) suggests that there are medical, biological, 
environmental, parental, and behavioral factors at play that influence food selectivity in 
individuals with ASD.

We acknowledge several limitations in the present study. The study was advertised as a study 
about mealtime and physical activity; this may have resulted in a biased sample, as parents 
of children with feeding difficulties may have been more interested in participating in the 
study. We attempted to minimize this potential bias by recruiting children with and without 
autism and emphasizing that we were seeking children whether or not their parents had 
concerns in these areas in our recruitment. Because the present study was cross-sectional in 
design, we cannot establish a causal relationship between sensory sensitivity and food 
selectivity. In addition, we determined food selectivity based on the modified FFQ and 3-day 
food records, which have limitations for use that have been previously discussed (Bandini et 
al. 2010). These tools did not allow us to determine if a child was not offered a food by the 
parent based on the child’s presumed or historical refusal of that food. Fruit and vegetable 
items were disaggregated on the FFQ based on our desire to accurately measure refusal of 
these foods. However, foods such as mixed-food entrees were kept aggregated to minimize 
participant burden; this may have introduced error, which would likely be non-differential. 
The FFQ may not have accurately captured everything each child ate because the assessment 
was limited to items found on FFQ. This list was limited to fruit and vegetables commonly 
consumed in western diets, although there was an opportunity to write in any foods eaten 
more than once per week. Also, the 3-day food record may not adequately capture the 
repertoire of a typical diet, and our coding decisions may have affected our estimation of 
variety, although it is expected that any errors introduced in this way would have affected 
both groups similarly. There were also several limitations of the Sensory Profile tool used to 
assess oral sensory sensitivity in the study. Identification of sensory sensitivities were based 
on parent report rather than observed directly, and may have been affected by caregiver bias 
and observational abilities. Studies using direct observation rather than parent-reported data 
would likely address the limitations of this methodology, however this approach is not as 
practical for larger-scale studies. This study also did not collect information on parental food 
preferences, and thus it remains unknown whether parents’ food choices and preferences had 
an influence on what was served. Parents whose own food repertoire is limited may not offer 
a wide variety of foods to the family, which would result in limited food repertoires on the

part of children. However, our measure of food refusal was based on food refused from those 
offered. We observed in this study and in our analyses of these data (Bandini, 2010; Curtin, 
2015) that children with ASD had higher rates of food refusal than TD children. In this 
study, food refusal was positively and significantly associated with oral sensory sensitivities. 
Finally, lack of representation by a wider range of racial/ethnic groups of varying socio-
economic status limits the generalizability of our findings.

Although the current study did not assess oral sensory under-sensitivity, delineating 
differences between over- and under-sensitivity to oral stimuli may provide insight into 
particular food selective eating behaviors in children with ASD. For example, oral over-
sensitivity may result in difficulty with textures while oral under-sensitivity, in which the 
child does not appear to adequately perceive sensations, may result in the child consuming 
large amounts of a particular food and/or stuffing his mouth (Cermak et al. 2010). No studies 
to date have examined over- versus under-sensitivity to taste/smell stimuli for children with 
ASD, although previous studies have reported varying frequencies of overall sensory under-
sensitivity and over-sensitivity in this population (Baranek et al. 2006; Ben-Sasson et al. 
2009). Further study in this area is warranted.

The present study assessed the relationship between oral sensory processing and food 
selectivity in a moderate-sized sample of children with ASD with an age-matched control 
group. To the best of our knowledge, no similar studies have used direct measures of food 
intake to determine food selectivity. In contrast to earlier studies on this topic, this study 
quantified food selectivity using validated food measures and operationalized definitions of 
food refusal and limited food repertoire. Additionally, while most studies proceeded with 
unverified diagnoses of ASD, our study ensured that ASD was independently verified using 
the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (Rutter et al. 2003) a gold-standard assessment of 
ASD and ASD severity. Use of two measures of oral sensory processing ability (Oral 
Sensory Sensitivity and Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity) also allowed us to differentiate 
between overall oral sensory sensitivity (including items reflecting both over and under-
sensitivity) and specifically oral sensory over-sensitivity, which allow for more specificity 
when characterizing oral sensory processing dysfunction in this population.

CONCLUSION

Our study shows that more children with ASD present with atypical sensory characteristics 
compared to children without ASD. Among children with ASD, those with Atypical Oral 
Sensory Sensitivity refused more foods and ate fewer vegetables compared to those with 
Typical Oral Sensory Sensitivity. Further, Atypical Oral Sensory Over-sensitivity, a measure 
of sensory hyper-sensitivity for taste and smell sensory input, was associated with higher 
rates of food refusal, a narrower food repertoire and consumption of fewer unique fruits and 
vegetables. Early identification of and intervention for sensory processing abnormalities in 
children with ASD is critical for addressing problematic behaviors associated with eating 
and mealtimes. These findings suggest that children with ASD who have Atypical Oral 
Sensory Sensitivity and food selectivity may benefit from working with a multidisciplinary 
team of specialists, including speech pathologists, occupational therapists, and dietitians to 
improve sensory experiences related to eating and to increase adequacy and variety of the

diet. Strategies may include changing the texture and consistency of foods to more 
manageable sensory characteristics, and using a sensory integration approach to decrease 
sensory sensitivity. More importantly, treatment plans should be individualized to the unique 
sensory characteristics of each child. Future areas of study should focus on the relationship 
between oral sensory sensitivity and neurobiological factors and the specific sensory 
characteristics of food, as well as differentiate between sensory over- and under-sensitivity. 
Direct observations of sensory processing ability may address the limitations of using a 
parent-reported tool. Longitudinal studies are needed to fully elucidate the nature of the 
relationship between sensory sensitivity and food selectivity in children with ASD and how 
it persists over time.
