Abstract: Robust population-based research has established that sexual and gender minority youths
(SGMYs) are at an increased risk of mental ill-health, but there is a dearth of literature that seeks to
explore how to best support SGMY mental wellbeing. This scoping review aims to identify ﬁndings
related to coping strategies and/or interventions for building resilience and/or enhancing the mental
wellbeing of SGMYs. PRISMA extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines was utilized
for this review. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed papers containing primary data;
reported psycho-social coping strategies for SGMY; were conducted with SGMYs in the adolescent age
range; and were published in English. MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched.
Of the 3692 papers initially identiﬁed, 68 papers were included with 24 intervention-focused studies
of 17 unique interventions found. The most commonly cited therapeutic modality was cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) (n = 11 studies). Despite the need to support the mental wellbeing of
SGMYs, few interventions focused on this area and unique populations have been reported upon
in the peer-reviewed literature. As a result, there is considerable potential to develop supports
for SGMYs.

1. Introduction

Sexual and gender minority youths (SGMYs) include the young people who identify
as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/trans, and queer, as well as all other sexual and
gender minority (i.e., LGBTQ+) youth. It is estimated that up to 10% of the adolescent pop-
ulation are SGMYs, based on the results of a range of population-based studies [1,2]. Prior
research has indicated that SGMYs are more likely to experience mental health problems in
comparison to their peers who are heterosexual and cisgender (i.e., not transgender). For ex-
ample, a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies reported sexual
minority youths had three times the risk (odds ratio = 2.9) of depression in comparison to
heterosexual youths [1]. Estimates of depression for gender minority youths indicate even
greater mental health needs, with a nationally representative population-based estimate
from New Zealand reporting gender minority youths had almost six times the odds (odds
ratio = 5.7) of depression when compared to their peers who are cisgender [3].

The elevated rates of mental health problems frequently experienced by SGMYs are
hypothesized to be largely driven by minority stress. The effects of the stigma, discrimi-
nation, or victimization that SGMYs can experience in their everyday lives, and the high
and chronic levels of stress they face, place them at an increased risk [4,5]. In short, “. . . it is

toxic social environments that place SGMY at elevated risk of mental ill-health” [6] (p. 6).
Logically more needs to be done to improve these challenging social environments, over
and above the work LGBTQ+ organizations have engaged with over many years to bring
about positive change. Improving the overall milieu for SGMYs is therefore important,
and some further efforts are underway to address these challenging environments, for
example, the work associated with the UK’s “LGBT Action Plan 2018: Improving the lives
of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender people” [7]. However, overall progress seems
out of step with the relative size of the SGMY population, as well as the considerable mental
health needs of SGMYs. For instance, there appears to be limited interventions speciﬁcally
designed to support the mental health of SGMYs, as highlighted in three systematic reviews
that sought to identify such resources [8–10].

Fortunately, considerable evidence is already available on how to treat commonly
occurring mental health problems, such as for depression and anxiety in young people
generally. For instance, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been recom-
mended for children and young people with mild through to severe depression in the
UK’s inﬂuential National Institute for Health and Care Excellence/NICE treatment guide-
lines [11]. However, sexual and gender minority (SGM) people have not been well served
by the mainstream health and social care services that are evidence-based [12–14]. For
example, when Foy et al. [12] surveyed sexual minority adults about their treatment expe-
riences, which frequently included CBT, half (52.2%) highlighted that services should be
improved for sexual minority clients. Common issues identiﬁed by participants included
their therapist’s lack of awareness and understanding of sexual minority identities and
community-speciﬁc challenges, with distrust, disillusionment, and exclusion being com-
mon therapy experiences [12]. Furthermore, previous work has reported that the clinical
outcomes from mainstream therapy services for SGM individuals are poor relative to those
of their heterosexual cisgender peers [13,14]. This is especially the case for lesbian women
and bisexual adults [13], as well as gender minority adolescents [14].

Given that mainstream services appear less acceptable and effective for SGM adults
and gender minority youths, an investigation of the therapeutic potential and usefulness
of supports for SGMYs more generally is warranted. However, internationally, only
24 such interventions have been identiﬁed and most of these (n = 17) have a sexual health
focus [8]. SGMYs have highlighted a preference for digital psychosocial supports [15].
However, given the results of the reviews to date, few such digital interventions have been
developed speciﬁcally to meet the needs of SGMYs [8–10]. We identiﬁed several broadly
related literature reviews associated with the efforts to support SGMYs, but none had a
focus on the speciﬁc coping strategies and/or interventions for building resilience and/or
enhancing the mental wellbeing of SGMYs. For instance, there have been reviews with an
emphasis on deﬁning resilience, either for young people generally [16] or SGMYs more
speciﬁcally [17]. Reviews have also described the SGMY inequities context [18] and have
assisted our understanding of the overall methods that should be employed when working
with SGMYs, including strength-based approaches [19]. However, it appears that there is
scant evidence and explanations pertaining to the speciﬁc psycho-social skills or resources
used within interventions that build resilience or promote mental wellbeing and coping
strategies for SGMYs, either digitally or in-person. This gap in the knowledge-base is likely
to go some way to explain the lack of tools being developed and offered for SGMY mental
health promotion.

1.1. Rationale

As a study team, we are in the process of creating a bespoke digital intervention. This
new resource is intended to build the resilience skills and enhance the mental wellbeing
of SGMYs [6]. We have decided to conduct a scoping review to support us in develop-
ing this intervention for two key reasons. Firstly, because the digital intervention ﬁeld
is a fast-moving area, this time-efﬁcient overarching review methodology is especially
useful. Secondly, there is a gap in the literature in relation to what appears effective

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8738

and acceptable for SGMYs in terms of evidence-informed psycho-social coping strategies
and/or interventions.

1.2. Objective

Our objective is to identify the scope of evidence for the recommended psycho-social
coping techniques or strategies for building resilience and/or enhancing the wellbeing of
SGMYs in the adolescent age range.

2. Methods
2.1. Protocol and Registration

The reporting of this scoping review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)
checklist [20]. Given that we have time limited funding to design, co-create, and evaluate a
new web-based intervention (by the end of 2022), this scoping review was not registered
prior to being conducted.

2.2. Eligibility Criteria

The eligibility criteria for our scoping review, from database inception to January 2022,

were as follows. Publications were included if they were:
•

•

•

Peer-reviewed papers containing primary data (using quantitative, qualitative, or
mixed-methods research designs);
Papers that reported on what is considered effective or useful in terms of psycho-social
coping strategies for SGMYs;
Studies that were conducted with SGMYs in the adolescent age range, which could
potentially include participants as young as 10 years and as old as 19 years (i.e., the
World Health Organization/WHO deﬁnition of adolescence), or where the sample
included adults (or children) then more than 50% of the study’s participants are
adolescents;

• Were published in English.
•
•
•
• Opinion pieces, commentaries, or theoretical pieces (i.e., the publication did not

Publications were excluded if they were:
Studies where adolescent data were not presented separately from adult or child data;
Literature reviews;

contain original data);
Conference abstracts (i.e., only a brief summary of the research conducted);
Dissertations.

•
•

We excluded papers that did not focus on adolescents as we aimed to create a devel-
opmentally appropriate resource for SGMYs. Moreover, we only included original data
from peer-reviewed papers, as we are interested in summaries of the empirical research
and what has been concluded based on that data.

2.3. Information Sources and Search Details

Three databases were searched, speciﬁcally MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo from
their inception to 19 January 2022. The searches across the three databases were based on
the search terms used for MEDLINE. The search strategy for MEDLINE was built by three
of the authors (i.e., M.F.G.L., R.S., and K.A.R.) and was then reviewed and reﬁned by the
remaining authors (i.e., A.N.-G., L.M.W., and K.E.B.) before the full search was conducted.
For MEDLINE, the searching was from the database’s inception (which was in 1946) to
19 January 2022 (for the speciﬁc search terms used, see Appendix A). The same electronic
limits were applied to all three databases, speciﬁcally that all papers were to be published
in the English language, involved humans, and had adolescent participants.

2.4. Selection of Evidence and Data Processes

M.F.G.L. screened all the titles and abstracts from the papers initially identiﬁed.
The full-text papers were all checked by both M.F.G.L. and A.N.-G. and any disagree-
ments about their inclusion were resolved via discussion with R.S. and K.A.R. Nine articles
were identiﬁed by checking the reference lists of the included studies. Where it was not
clear whether or not a paper should have been included, due to a lack of demographic
information in the actual paper, the corresponding author was contacted. All data extrac-
tion and reporting were conducted by M.F.G.L. and independently checked by A.N.-G.
Key information collated included details about the author(s); year of publication; study
location; the sample size; how the target population was deﬁned; the salient features of
psycho-social coping techniques or strategies for SGMYs identiﬁed; and (where applicable)
the format of the intervention. Given the diverse ways in which SGMY populations are
described, the language as utilized in the individual papers was employed when the paper
was summarized.

2.5. Appraisal of Individual Sources of Evidence and Synthesis of Results

Prior to commencing this work, we initially debated focusing our review exclusively
on trials of mental health interventions conducted with SGMYs. However, it was apparent
during the early stages of developing our search terms that such a restrictive focus would
be counter-productive, due to the small number of trials identiﬁed in the reviews already
conducted. A conventional critical appraisal of the quality of the evidence was outside the
scope of this review, which was designed to identify the key psychosocial techniques that
have been employed for and by SGMYs. Consequently, we have taken a more descriptive
approach, as recommended by Arksey and O’Malley [21], where we have not rated the
evidence per se, but have outlined the common focus, features, and format of interventions;
the standardized assessments used; and the signiﬁcant clinical or other outcomes reported.
We also sought to summarize the expert by experience insights into potentially effective
strategies that were provided by SGMYs, as outlined in a range of qualitative studies.
Arksey and O’Malley’s [21] framework informed the overall process and synthesis of the
review, using their ﬁve stages of identifying the research question; identifying relevant
studies; study selection; charting the data; and collating, summarizing, and reporting
the results.

3. Results
3.1. Selection of Sources of Evidence

The initial results yielded a total of 3692 articles that were from:

• MEDLINE = 1100 articles;
•
Embase = 1226 articles;
•
PsycInfo = 1366 articles.

Once the duplicates were removed, there were 2801 articles identiﬁed for title and
abstract screening. Of these articles, 2689 were excluded and 112 were identiﬁed for a full-
text review, 59 of these full-texts were included in this review and an additional 9 papers
were identiﬁed after reviewing the reference lists of the included full texts. As a result,
68 papers were included in our review (see Figure 1 for details).

3.2. Overall Characteristics of the Sources of Evidence

In total, 68 studies were included in this review. The research in the ﬁeld is fairly
recent, as the oldest papers date from 2008 and more than half of the studies have been
published from 2017 onwards (n = 35 studies). Most studies involved fewer than 50 partic-
ipants (n = 40 studies). North American research predominates, with over two-thirds of
papers consisting of participants from the USA (n = 47), including ﬁve studies where the
participants were from both Canada and the USA. Other studies were conducted in a single
country, speciﬁcally Canada (n = 5), the United Kingdom (n = 4), New Zealand (n = 4),
and Australia (n = 2), with one study each conducted in South Africa, Belgium, Puerto
Rico, Israel, and Norway. One study drew participants from across ten African countries
(i.e., [22]). There was no uniform focus on the LGBTQ+ sub-populations of interest, but the
studies could be broadly categorized into one of three main groups:

1.
2.
3.

Those that consisted of LGB (or sexual minority) youths (n = 26 studies).
Those that consisted of LGBTQ/+ (or sexual and gender minority) youths (n = 28 studies).
Those that consisted of transgender/trans (or gender minority) youths (n = 14 studies).

The majority of studies (n = 41, 60.3%) provided details of the funder/s of the re-
search (e.g., government ministries, individual universities, and research funding councils);
the remainder did not explicitly acknowledge a funder or funders.

3.3. Appraisal of the Intervention-Focused Studies (n = 24)

Of the 68 papers, 24 were intervention-focused. Of these, more than half (n = 13 studies)
included SGMY/LGBTQ+ youths and the remainder either focused on sexual minor-
ity/LGB young people (n = 9 studies) or gender minority/trans young people (n = 2 studies).
Table 1 provides an overview of these 24 studies (which represent 17 unique interventions).
Of the 17 unique interventions, most were primarily psychotherapeutic in nature (n = 12).
A smaller number were, broadly speaking, preventive or universal interventions (n = 5),
which were designed either for SGMYs speciﬁcally or for all young people more generally.
The majority of studies were focused on the initial development or assessment of
novel interventions for SGMYs. The most commonly cited therapeutic modality was cogni-
tive behavioral therapy (n = 11 studies), which was utilized in “AFFIRM” (n = 4 studies),
“SPARX/Rainbow SPARX” (n = 3 studies), “ASSET” (n = 1 study), and in unnamed in-
terventions for three studies (i.e., [23–25]). Two interventions consisted of family therapy,
speciﬁcally “Familias con Orgullo/Families with Pride”, and an unnamed intervention
(i.e., [26]).

Most of the interventions were provided in-person (n = 14 studies) in either individual
or group formats, with four being delivered in schools (i.e., [24,27–29]). Five interventions
(n = 9 studies) were provided digitally, in synchronous (e.g., for “Q-Chat Space”) or
asynchronous formats (e.g., for “Singularities”). One study explored the potential of a yet-
to-be-created intervention, and, as such, it was yet to be determined whether the eventual
intervention would be delivered digitally (i.e., [30]). Two of the interventions delivered
digitally (n = 5 studies) were provided in serious game formats (i.e., “Singularities” and
“SPARX/Rainbow SPARX”).

Most commonly, the study designs were pilot studies (n = 9) and only one was a
randomized controlled trial (i.e., [31]). The focus of the pilot studies was predominantly
testing the acceptability, feasibility, and/or preliminary effectiveness of the interventions.
A range of standardized assessments were used across the pilot studies, such as measures
of depressive symptoms (e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory). Given the design of these
studies (i.e., small-scale open trials/pilots), it is unknown if any of the interventions are
effective, although acceptability data appear positive based on the feedback from SGMYs.

AFFIRM is an 8-module
afﬁrmative CBT group
intervention developed for
LGBTQ+ youths. Targets
identity-based stressors
(e.g., transphobic bullying)
that contribute to
emotional distress and
seeks to improve
functioning by addressing
underlying, problematic
cognitions. It explores how
SGMYs have learned to
cope with identity-speciﬁc
stressors, facilitates the
development of afﬁrming
and “realistic alternative
ways of thinking and
behaving” (p. 138), and
enhances connection to
and support from others.

Program/“CMHI”
consisted of individual
therapy, medication
treatment, and
case management.

Meetings arranged into
three 1 h sections,
speciﬁcally: unstructured
social time;
consciousness-raising (e.g.,
a presentation on the
history of LGBTQ+
oppression); and a
youth-led peer
support group.

Multiple assessments, e.g.,
The Youth Information
Questionnaire Revised and
the Child Behavior
Checklist 6–18

Signiﬁcant improvements
reported for anxiety and
depression for
LGBTQ youths.

Multiple assessments, e.g.,
items from the Center for

Those attending for 1–6 or
>6 months reported higher
social support, which was
associated with
improvements (e.g.,
decreased
depression scores).

a LGBTQ+ terminology varies across papers; we cite the language and/or abbreviation adopted in the individual papers. LGB = lesbian, gay, and bisexual. LGBT = lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender. LGBTQ = lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. LGBTQ+ = lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer others who are a gender and sexual minority
(i.e., +). RCT = randomized controlled trial. SGMYs = sexual and gender minority youths. b Where a mean age was not provided or could not be calculated, the age range reported or
conﬁrmation from the paper’s corresponding author was used to determine that the mean age was ≤19 years.

3.4. Summary of the Interventions’ Content

Table 2 provides an overview of the therapeutic content or coping strategies that
were common across the interventions. These could be broadly categorized as cogni-
tive/emotional or cognitive (n = 6), environmental/social (n = 5), or behavioral (n = 2).
Many were evidence-based techniques adapted for SGMYs. For instance, CBT techniques,
such as cognitive restructuring, where the “ABCD” cognitive restructuring method (as
outlined in “AFFIRM”) was applied, in particular, where this method was then linked
to salient experiences with accompanying suggested responses for SGMYs, such as in
this example:

Table 2. Common content across the intervention-focused studies.

Technique or Coping
Strategy
[Category Type]

Intervention/s Where This Was Utilized

Example Description

Relaxation exercises
[behavioral]

A mental health promotion program (i.e., [24]),
“SPARX” and “Rainbow SPARX”

Behavioral activity/
activation
[behavioral]

“AFFIRM”, a culturally adapted intervention
(i.e., [23]), “Project YES”, “SPARX”, and “Rainbow
SPARX”

Relaxation exercises included “diaphragmatic breathing and progressive
muscle relaxation” [24] (p. 11), although the exercises were not adapted in
any way to better meet the needs of SGMYs.

Key messages to SGMYs included: “. . . the fewer pleasant activities people
do, the more depressed they feel. . . [address this by]. . . engaging in activities
that are pleasant, rewarding, and inspiring” [23] (p. 897), e.g., dancing (even
if SGMY’s family is unsupportive of “gay” activities) [23].

Problem solving
[cognitive/emotional]

“ASSET”, an attachment-based intervention
(i.e., [26]), a culturally adapted intervention (i.e.,
[23]), a mental health promotion program (i.e., [24]),
“SPARX”, and “Rainbow SPARX”

Problem solving introduced using “. . . STEPS (Say what the problem is,
Think of solutions, Examine these ideas, Pick one and try it, See what
happens)” [42] (p. 207) using problems of relevance (e.g., worrying friends
will reject an SGMY when they come out) [42].

Enhancing

[social/environmental]

“AFFIRM”, “ASSET”, a culturally adapted
intervention (i.e., [23]), and an unnamed

Psycho-education
[cognitive/emotional]

“AFFIRM”, a mental health promotion program
(i.e., [24]), and “Rainbow SPARX”

“AFFIRM”, “SPARX”, “Rainbow SPARX”, and an
unnamed intervention (i.e., [25])

Skills were taught and practiced, e.g., “. . . using education and rehearsal
within an afﬁrmative context that. . . enhances connection to and support
from peer and adult allies. . . ” [34] (p. 138), such as identifying a plan for
building a supportive social network for SGMYs [34].

Speciﬁc examples included highlighting “. . . the connection between
experiencing a stressor, emotional reactions, and behavioral responses” [24]
(p. 11) and “Understanding the impact of anti-LGBTQ attitudes and
behaviors on stress” [34] (p. 139).

SGMY-speciﬁc examples of recognizing problematic cognitions were
highlighted, for instance, “Someone gives you grief because you’re different.
Here comes the [possible] negative thought: “I’m a freak and no one will
ever love me”. . . ” [42] (p. 208).

“AFFIRM”, a culturally adapted intervention
(i.e., [23]), a mental health promotion program
(i.e., [24]), “Rainbow SPARX”, “SPARX”, and an
unnamed intervention (i.e., [25])

ABCD method used (example provided for “I am genderqueer”) “A: is the
Activating event. . . B: is the Belief or the thought that you are having. . . C: is
the Consequence of your thought. . . D: is the way in which you Dispute or
talk back to your thought” [33] (p. 5).

An attachment-based intervention (i.e., [26]) and
“Familias con Orgullo”

An example included parents using “. . . newly learned communication
skills and practice with adolescents by discussing a relevant issue in the
youth’s life related to being a sexual minority” [40] (p. 7).

intervention and evaluation of LGBT-related school
interventions/resources (i.e., [25,29]) regarding
gay–straight alliances

Importance of education reinforced, such as having “. . . written material
that the parents could read to educate themselves about many different
aspects of sexual minority life, including things as simple as deﬁnitions and
as complicated as legislative issues. . . ” [30] (p. 184).

Digital resources were highlighted by SGMYs: “Youth also discussed
increased consumption of digital media (e.g., video, games, music),
particularly identity-speciﬁc online content. . . They frequently exchanged
content recommendations” [37] (p. 451).

Developing and sharing narratives (e.g., coming out experiences) to support
positive change seen as especially useful: “. . . [An] exercise in public
narrative[s], that is, articulating a “story of self” to promote social change or
advocacy goals” [39] (p. 371).

Peer support valuable: “. . . [Hatch Youth includes] a youth-led peer support
group where participants talk about the events and issues in their lives
and/or process a speciﬁc topic. . . [including] self-awareness and acceptance,
coming out. . . ” [45] (p. 360).

“A [Activating event]: I am genderqueer. B [Belief or thought]: “No one can
be happy if they are genderqueer,” or “Being genderqueer is going to ruin my
life,” and “I won’t be able to handle the discrimination and stigma associated
with being genderqueer.” C [Consequence of your thought]: I feel hopeless and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8738

14 of 29

worried. D [Dispute or talk back to your thought]: “There are people who are
genderqueer who are as happy as people with other identities.” “Discrimination
against genderqueer people happens and it is awful, but it won’t ruin each minute
of my life.” “I am a strong and determined person, who can have a good life
in spite of discrimination.” “Instead of wasting energy doubting myself and
feeling anxiety, I can use my energy to ﬁgure out the best way to live an authentic
life” [33] (p. 5).

Of note, all the interventions were afﬁrming of SGMYs’ identities. Although not a
technique per se, the instillation of hope for SGMYs was recognized as important, for
instance, in “AFFIRM” [34] and “Rainbow SPARX” [42]. Where the latter stated to users of
the program:

“The other message in the game [Rainbow SPARX] was about having hope. It’s
good to repeat these simple messages: “I won’t always feel this way”; “Things
will get better”; or “It can be hard not being straight, but I know I can handle the
challenges that come my way.” “These statements are true and thinking them can
make you feel a little better almost instantly, even if you don’t believe them at
ﬁrst” [42] (p. 206).

3.5. Appraisal of the Non-Intervention-Focused Studies (n = 44)

Table 3 summarizes the methods and key ﬁndings obtained from the non-intervention-
focused studies, which frequently drew upon the expert by experience perspectives of
SGMYs in regard to psycho-social coping techniques or strategies. Repeatedly, in the
included studies, the ability to obtain support and a connection with other SGMYs was
seen as important (e.g., [46–51]). The opportunity to meet people “like me” was seen as
especially useful. This point was reinforced by a participant who highlighted: “. . . being
surrounded by so many LGBTQ community members and allies convinced me that I can
one day feel as happy, safe, and loved all the time” [48] (p. 55).

The Internet was frequently seen as an important way in which SGMYs could achieve
a connection with other SGMYs for support purposes (e.g., [52–58]). The Internet was even
described as “life saving” for SGMYs [59]. This point was reinforced by an SGMY who
stated: “There’s a supportive community out there online and they mean the world to
me– they’ve saved my life” [59] (p. 37). However, the Internet could also be problematic for
SGMYs [56,60]. For example, SGMYs could be exposed to mistreatment online, with one
adolescent noting: “It’s [social media] public. Which is both a blessing and a curse because
you can connect with all these people but also you are open to a lot of hate” [56] (p. 278).
Even social media groups, speciﬁcally for SGMYs, could be a source of discrimination and
stigma [55]. For instance, certain SGMYs expressed racist or transphobic views or engaged
in exclusionary behavior within a group, expressing sentiments such as: “you cannot be in
here, you are not gay enough” [55] (p. 426). As a result of online issues, SGMYs are required
to be skillful users of the Internet, such as when they use certain platform features to protect
themselves (e.g., by utilizing blocking and privacy settings for safety reasons) [60].

SGMYs taking on an educator role (i.e., [56,61]) or something akin to a political
advocate role (i.e., [46,57,62]) was perceived as helpful by SGMYs. For instance, when
SGMYs held a “proud LGBTQ+ position”, this could be resilience-enhancing in the face
of mistreatment [62]. Engaging in altruistic activities or roles where SGMYs were “giving
back” was also thought to be beneﬁcial (i.e., [59,60,63]). This included SGMYs mentoring
other SGMYs (i.e., [63,64]) or providing online support to SGMYs [60]—which in turn
helped them “feel good after helping their peers” [60] (p. 171).

SGMYs also sought to “escape” from challenging environments (i.e., [51,59,65]) and
they created “pockets of safety” [61] for themselves. They used cognitive strategies to
manage negative messages, such as those of a religious nature [52,61,66]. An example is
when an SGMY reﬂected: “Because I believe God made everybody, so if God didn’t want
people to be gay, then God wouldn’t have made them gay” [52] (p. 7).

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8738

15 of 29

Being “out” in terms of one’s sexuality and/or gender identity proffered both potential
wellbeing beneﬁts and challenges. In some instances, “learning to hide” [67], as it was
described in South Africa, or being “being closeted”, as cited in Belgium [68], could be
adaptive given the potential negative reactions of others towards “out” SGMYs. This meant
that SGMYs used “. . . a closed visibility management strategy in speciﬁc social situations
that are perceived as risky” [68] (p. 697). A similar point was also made by Rubin and
McClelland [69] in their research on queer American women of color, where concerns about
possible homophobic comments from peers meant that deleting their social media proﬁle
was an adaptive way to maintain personal safety. By contrast, being out has the potential to
increase the amount of support that SGMYs receive (i.e., [61]). This can be the case, despite
the “many cultural and familial taboos” SGMYs can experience [61] (p. 628).

Certain behavioral techniques were described as being valuable in terms of supporting
mental wellbeing, including diversionary activities (i.e., [70,71]). For example, Strauss and
colleagues [70] noted that amongst trans and gender diverse young people, being distracted
by social media, games, or watching online media “. . . took their minds off their concerns,
at least momentarily” [70] (p. 5). Physical exercise was also cited as important (i.e., [71,72]),
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where exercise and outdoor activities provided
beneﬁts to mental wellbeing. As noted by an SGMY, “. . . the lack of sports has really had a
negative impact on me [during the pandemic]. It’s hard to motivate myself, but I always
feel better after exercising” [72] (p. 1055). These activities were not merely distractions, but
could also provide a way to feel more positive about their identity [71], as demonstrated
by an SGMY in relation to going to the gym as a coping strategy. He did this when
confronted with anti-LGBTQ+ experiences, stating: “I feel the frustration, the anger—it’s
like the fuel for me to work out and push harder. It kinda turns into a positive. I feel
better.” [71] (p. 145).

SGMYs can engage in coping strategies usually viewed by others as problematic, in
particular, self-harming (i.e., [60,73,74]). However, for some LGBTQ+ participants, their
self-harming was perceived to be a positive coping strategy [75]. Other coping strategies
that caused harm and/or serious risk to the young person included suicide attempts, risky
sexual practices, and excessive drinking and recreational drug-taking [22,62,74].

Certain psychological strategies were also described. For example, in terms of coping
with victimization, participants described using mindfulness and emotional regulation
strategies; cognitive reappraisals; assertive communication techniques; and questioning
and resisting rigid culturally bound labels [57,71,76]. Some used apathy as a response to
emotional pain (i.e., [52,77]). Avoidance—both psychologically and physically—was also
a perceived coping strategy (i.e., [50,60]). Regarding emotional avoidance, participants
suppressed emotions as a means to block these challenging feelings, in an attempt to avoid
pain and humiliation [67]. Ignoring or avoiding certain people or behavior was a strategy
utilized to reduce the likelihood of distress, and hence preserve emotional energy [78]. For
instance, as highlighted by an SGMY: “. . . I know when to just drop it and walk away/block
them when they aren’t open to learning. Negative comments online are inevitable and they
can be hurtful. . . You have the opportunity to teach them but if they aren’t open minded,
you can simply ignore them. . . ” [60] (p. 170).

The Internet is “life saving” (p. 37)—it is where
transgender youths can heal, grow, and thrive.
Online, TGD youths can escape stigma and violence,
experience belonging, build conﬁdence, feel hopeful,
and there are opportunities for “giving back”
to others.

Social media assists identity development,
relationships, and supports wellbeing, but is not
always free of discrimination. Facebook groups
allow for a connection with LGBTQ peers, and social
media was considered a vital support for those with
mental health problems, including suicidal ideation.

Happy memory narratives are important in terms of
overall wellbeing and 77% of participants described
one that was either everyday leisure or a special
occasion, and 71% included some mention of friends.
Few recalled LGB-speciﬁc events as happy
memories (e.g., taking part in a pride parade).

Six themes related to coping with gender identity
were identiﬁed—negotiating gender, avoidance,
emotional relief, personal solace, support, and active
engagement. The same coping strategy could be
either harmful or useful, depending on the timing,
purpose, and context.

Youths struggle with what the future entails when
their “mental energy is focused on coping with
current stressors” (p. 162). There is a lack of adult
transgender role models. Apathy appeared to be
used as a possible defense against emotional pain. It
is important to highlight pleasant emotions when
these emotions are experienced.

Defense mechanisms identiﬁed by the researchers
(e.g., denial, avoidance, compartmentalization,
suppression, compensation, sublimation, undoing,
rationalization, and intellectualization). A common
coping strategy is “learning to hide” (p. 233), but
keeping distance can lead to isolation.

Four themes were identiﬁed where media-use
enabled: “. . . coping through escapism; feeling
stronger; ﬁghting back; and ﬁnding and fostering
community. . . ” (p. 254). For example, a participant
highlighted that “. . . media is a form of escapism
from the harsh reality that is the heteronomative, the
heterosexist world that we live in. . . ” (p. 262).

Resilience can be manifested asa young person
serving as the family’s educator, being “out” in the
open with their family, and creating “pockets of
safety” (p. 628). For instance, participants “. . . deftly
negotiated complicated and adversarial religious
perspectives to create safe spiritual experiences. . . ”
(p. 628).

Themes—appraising the situation/themselves;
avoiding (e.g., ignoring comments); responding (e.g.,
ﬁghting back); adaptive coping (e.g., seeking and/or
providing support); maladaptive coping (e.g.,
self-harming); impacting wellbeing (e.g., feeling
distressed or tired); and a non-issue/do not
experience this.

The beneﬁts of social media use for LGBTQ+ youths
include opportunities for emotional support and
development; general education; entertainment; and
obtaining identity-speciﬁc information. Younger
participants were more likely to use social media for
beneﬁcial factors than older youth.

Participants identiﬁed many issues related to
improving environments to enhance their
psychological and physical safety. “. . . GLBT-focused
youth centers appear to offer layers of protection for
youth in various forms. . . .” (p. 1040), primarily due
to their ability to support a connection with similar
peers.

Three primary areas identiﬁed—developing
protective supports (because GLBTQ youths feel
“unprotected, vulnerable, and invalidated” p. 244);
mental health-related supports are required; and
these need to be culturally relevant services.
Teaching youths how to effectively self-advocate to
enhance supports is also important.

LGB youths handle the visibility of their minority
status differently, depending on the context. Being
“closed” can reduce “. . . external stressors, such as
verbal aggression and discrimination. . . ” (p. 692),
but then risks exposure to internal stressors, such as
the fear of being “caught” and feeling dishonest.

Connectedness is key, themes identiﬁed: afﬁrming
the self; ﬁnding others similar to you; and moving
toward action. Connection recognized for its
potential allowing “. . . one to reach beyond the self,
take action against his/her own oppression and
situates. . . [this] into a larger collective struggle” (p.
1616).

Five main coping mechanisms to manage school
homophobic bullying identiﬁed: cognitive
appraisals of their school’s anti-LGB incidents;
assertive communication; becoming an LGB
community advocate; tactical ignoring; and
questioning and resisting rigid (and culturally
bound) sexuality labels.

Black LGB peers important, as participants derived a
“. . . sense of comfort with other black LGB people;
they could escape homophobia; and it decreased
their social isolation. . . .” (p. 376). Difﬁcult when the
participant did not know or had few Black lesbian
peers. There is a need to address multiple-identity
management.

Anti-homosexual religious messages focus on
“creation, sin, and afterlife” (p. 2189). Coping
strategies (cognitive)—using religious identity
material or sexual minority identity content to
reduce the negative impacts, adding new
information to invalidate the messages, and
distancing oneself from or rejecting the actual
message.

Coping strategies—“Voluntary Engagement” (e.g.,
time within LGBTQ+ community), “Voluntary
Disengagement” (e.g., not coming out to others),
“Involuntary Engagement” (e.g., using religious
beliefs to build conﬁdence), “Involuntary
disengagement” (e.g., apathy), and
“Coping Resources”.

Coping varied from “. . . LGBT connections (e.g.,
going to LGBT pride events, using LGBT online
resources, going to an LGBT youth center, becoming
involved in a gay–straight alliance) to conforming to
heteronormative behaviors (e.g., dating individuals
of the opposite sex. . . .” p. 42).

The more gender non-conforming a young person is,
the more abuse they receive. Higher self-esteem, a
higher sense of personal mastery, and greater
perceived social support predicted positive mental
health outcomes for transgender youths.

Positive factors that enhanced wellbeing were linked
to supporting LGBTQ youths’ own identity
development, peer networks, and involvement in
the LGBTQ community (although this is lacking in
rural areas—so online supports are
especially valuable).

Participants strived to “. . . reach a state of feeling
whole, where they can ‘just be themselves’” (p. 3498).
Their commitment to a male identity transformed
their relationship with their bodies and “. . . made the
participants feel whole and complete” (p. 3498), but
this could lead to new forms of gender dysphoria.

Coping included—transgender youth fostering
inclusion (e.g., “What I used to do, I would go up
before class and make sure they knew to call by my
right name if it was a sub [substitute teacher]” p.
887) and taking steps toward fostering social
connections (i.e., intentional actions to connect to
alleviate the impacts of stressors).

To cope with parental rejection, some participants
described engaging in self-harm behaviors. When
trans adolescents have parents exhibiting rejecting
behaviors, family work will be important, and if not
viable then “. . . attempts should be made to connect
youth to other forms of social support. . . ” (p. 167).

Multiple cognitive and behavioral strategies
identiﬁed, e.g., “preparation for future bias or
harassment”, being “cautious, guarded, or less
trusting”, attempt to “ignore or not be affected by
other’s views or reactions”, “be or focus on oneself”,
and “take care of self and problems” (p. 712).

Coping themes related to thoughts and feelings (e.g.,
“Regulation of immediate emotional reaction in
context of situation” p. 146 and “Analysis of the
anti-LGB incident for personal relevance and
severity” p. 147) and actions or behaviors (e.g.,
engaging in distractions, such as sports and music).

Peers, family members, personnel at school, and
youth services (or a combination of these) formed
critical types of support. SMYs found supportive
staff at school to cope with bullying and it was
suggested that “. . . if you don’t have a support
network, if you don’t have anybody [you should]
ﬁnd somebody” (p. 338).

Participants only asked for help when at a crisis
point. Reluctance to seek help related to
“. . . negotiating sexuality, gender, mental health and
age norms; being unable to talk about emotions; and
coping and self-reliance” (p. 156). Some perceived
self-harming as a positive coping strategy for
managing stress.

Common strategies to manage mistreatment
included “. . . routinization and minimizing of
homophobia; maintaining individual ‘adult’
responsibility; and constructing “proud”
identities. . . .” (p. 820). Self-harming, in particular,
cutting, could be perceived as a coping strategy for
when individuals are very distressed.

Fandoms/online fan groups can assist SGMYs by
increasing connectedness, providing opportunities
for support or mentorship, facilitating the
navigation of challenges, and encouraging feelings
of strength. For instance, these groups help SGMYs
to “cope with real life. . . [and] feel better” about
themselves or their situation (p. 1882).

Key strategies used during
COVID-19—“relationships” (e.g., spending time
with others online), setting “routines”, “body and
mind” (e.g., exercise and meditation), “rest and
reset” (e.g., art and reading), and “tuning out” (e.g.,
binge-watching TV) (p. 1053). Alcohol and drugs
also cited as a strategy.

Participants developed relationships and support
via Facebook, which requires sharing (e.g., thoughts,
behaviors, and ideas), but, at times, they needed to
hide and silence their emerging sexuality. The
tempering of self-presentation, to offset possible
social exclusion, was ongoing and perceived
as treacherous.

Coping strategies were categorized as resilient (e.g.,
drawing strength from resisting discrimination),
managing ambivalence (e.g., being “. . . ”out and
proud”, but also simultaneously uncomfortable with
their sexuality or despising aspects of gay culture”
p. 332), and engaging in self-destructive behavior
(e.g., cutting).

Online strategies identiﬁed included support
received from transgender-related online
communities (including emotional support via peers
and role models), “appraisal support for validating
their experiences” (p. 275), and informational
support for health decision-making and for
educating others.

Daily lived experience of resilience despite racism
and transprejudice encapsulated—“evolving,
simultaneous self-deﬁnition of racial/ethnic and
gender identities” (p. 690), an awareness of adultism
(i.e., dominance of youth by adults), self-advocacy,
ﬁnding a place within the LGBTQ community, and
using social media to afﬁrm this.

SGMYs search for supportive, validating
communities and relevant, accurate information
online. Online resources should represent diverse
identities, be comprehensive and link to both mental
and sexual health, and not be crisis oriented (i.e., not
be solely risk focused, but instead address
health holistically).

Online forms of support include diversionary
activities (e.g., games). Apps and digital resources
are valuable when they include social elements
and/or teach skills (e.g., mental health management
and self-care). Chat/email services useful because of
their availability outside of ofﬁce hours and ability
to maintain privacy.

Mindful responses, e.g., “I am aware that I am upset
because I am encountering discrimination” (p. 434)
versus shameful or judgmental responses, e.g., “I’m
being discriminated against. Something must be
wrong with me” (p. 434). High levels of mindfulness
protective for sexuality-based, but not
ethnicity-based, victimization.

Most participants could identify a natural mentor
(e.g., teacher, school nurse, or neighbor). More
experienced and knowledgeable GBQ peers seen as
valuable for support. Social supports to ideally
encompass emotional, instructional, and informa-
tional elements, as well as unconditional acceptance.

“Buffers to Destabilization” (p. 56) important, e.g.,
connection to others similar to them (and the wider
LGBTQ+ community). Other strategies included
intentionally disconnecting from environments and
people that were not good for them, and personal
growth—“. . . an inwardly focused process and
capacity. . . described as strengthening. . . ” (p. 7).

Social media enabled connectivity and created a
sense of community for rural LGBTQ+ youths (and a
way to come out to many people at a distance). They
could receive afﬁrming messages that fostered
belonging. Collective resilience important, e.g.,
“. . . the gay youth of [this town]. . . just amazing.
We’re strong and we’re powerful” (p. 11).

Alcohol and drug use a possible coping strategy.
Examples of strategies to manage included the use
of secrecy and concealment. Increased visibility was
a potential problem for same-sex-attracted young
Africans. The use of stories (and other narratives)
enabled access to a diverse range of youths.

LGBT youths displayed rainbow symbols to disclose
their community afﬁliation to others (e.g., to family
members and authority ﬁgures). This symbol was
associated with positive emotions, memories, and
aspirations. There were learned meanings associated
with rainbow symbols and these assisted them to
navigate toward supports.

Strategies to enhance resilience involved
transgender young people being “. . . deliberately
proactive in accessing supportive educational
systems” (p. 392); connecting with a trans-afﬁrming
community where they can reframe their mental
health challenges; and skillfully navigating
relationships with family and friends.

4. Discussion

The issues SGMYs face, from physical violence to unsupportive families, have been
well documented in the literature, but there is much less research on how SGMYs can best
cope with environments that are often hostile to them. The present scoping review supports
the earlier ﬁndings highlighting the relative paucity of interventions designed to support
the mental wellbeing of SGMYs, including those that are web-based in format [8–10].
However, a UK Department of Health commissioned report highlighted SGMYs’ strong
preference to access help on the Internet, whereby 82.3% (n = 572) of SGMY participants
reported that they would be “likely” or “very likely” to select help in this format [89].
Prior reviews have not delved into the therapeutic content of interventions, or the speciﬁc
strategies designed to be effective in supporting the mental wellbeing of SGMYs, which
represents a key strength of the present review.

Our current review indicates that a range of techniques or coping strategies have been
considered as effective across cognitive or cognitive/emotional, environmental/social, and
behavioral domains. When incorporated within interventions, the majority have been
provided in-person. Therefore, there exists an untapped potential in adapting successful
psychotherapeutic techniques to a Web-based format, in line with SGMYs’ preferences.
In relation to the intervention-focused studies, many of the techniques or strategies were
evidence-informed and adapted to meet the needs of SGMYs. For example, the CBT tech-
niques of cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation, adapted to be usefully applied
to the lives of SGMYs, are adaptations that have long been advocated by psychotherapy
experts in the ﬁeld of SGMY mental health (i.e., [90,91]).

The review ﬁndings suggest some challenges for the developers of Web-based inter-
ventions for SGMYs. For instance, the ability for SGMYs to connect with other SGMYs has
been reinforced as particularly important in regard to supporting the mental wellbeing of
these young people. However, this connecting requires careful considerations if provided
online, given the feedback provided earlier by both professionals and SGMYs about the
risks [15]. Speciﬁcally, there are risks concerning online stranger connections, and Inter-
net safety and security issues, including the risk of SGMYs being outed on the Web or
speciﬁcally targeted for sexual exploitation. There are also serious challenges associated
with how suicidality is safely managed in a Web-based context [15]. Another salient chal-
lenge is ensuring that interventions do not neglect the needs of SGMYs with other socially
disadvantaged characteristics, such as minority race/ethnicity, disability, or female sex.
Therefore, future interventions should represent multiple identities by fully acknowledging
the intersections between SGM status [65], and other minority characteristics. In part, this
could be achieved by using authentic portrayals of LGBTQ+ people, as suggested by Davis
and colleagues [80], which would ensure that people with multiple identities are included.
Many simple strategies should be straightforward to embed in future Web-based and
other interventions, such as psychoeducation pertaining to minority stress and its impact on
SGMYs, as well as basic behavioral techniques, such as relaxations exercises. Youth-friendly
and inclusive language adopted in interventions should also be easy to apply and readily
adopted in future Web-based interventions, speciﬁcally the promotion of inclusivity by
using an SGMY’s preferred name and pronouns to model transgender supportiveness in
resources. Interventions should also strive to use developmentally appropriate language,
so that the terminology employed is easily understood by younger SGMYs. Therefore,
therapy jargon and psychological concepts will need to be outlined suitably and acceptably
to SGMYs.

Strengths and Limitations

To the best of our knowledge, the present review is the ﬁrst to identify the recom-
mended psycho-social coping techniques or strategies for building resilience and/or en-
hancing the wellbeing of SGMYs, based on the primary data published in peer-reviewed
papers. A drawback of this approach is that we did not explore the gray literature and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 8738

could have potentially missed relevant ﬁndings as a result. Our analysis of the included
studies consisted of a narrative synthesis, as outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [21], which
was required in this review due to it focusing on investigating the types of psychosocial
techniques reported in the previous research, rather than quantifying the quality of the
included studies or their success. In particular, given the diverse nature of the research
reported upon, which included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies, a con-
ventional sensitivity analysis (similar to those frequently applied to quantitative studies)
was not possible. Moreover, given the heterogenous nature of the existing literature and
the lack of intervention trials, a critical appraisal of the clinical outcomes associated with
the intervention-focused studies is currently premature. As is commonplace, we only
included papers published in the English language, due to our limited resources [92]. That
this scoping review only included studies published in English means that the potential
insights from papers written in all other languages will have been missed. Studies from
a range of countries were included, such as research conducted in South Africa, Israel,
and Puerto Rico. However, over two-thirds of the studies were from a single high-income
Western nation, speciﬁcally the USA. American predominance in psycho-social research is
not new [93], but this focus on the USA does create a bias we would like to acknowledge.
Of relevance to the research on LGBTQ+ people is that studies will likely be absent in
countries where social environments make basic survival challenging for SGMYs, such
as in the countries where there is a death penalty for “homosexual acts”. By contrast,
across a range of more progressive countries, there has been considerable social progress
for LGBTQ+ individuals (e.g., marriage equality). However, many SGMYs continue to
face challenging social environments, which need to be improved. Whilst the focus of this
review was on the coping strategies SGMYs could employ themselves, subsequent work
should explore what is likely to be effective in regard to improving social environments for
SGMYs. Fortunately, related work is underway, such as a PROSPERO registered review
entitled “A realist evidence synthesis of mechanisms by which school-based interventions
may widen or reduce inequalities in LGBT adolescents’ mental health”. We set our inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria to emphasize an adolescent sample of SGMYs and we were
holistic in terms of what was to be included regarding a study’s design and particular focus.
Others may have decided to make different decisions in shaping a comparable review;
nevertheless, we strove to be transparent and have provided details around our searching
of the literature and our rationale.

5. Conclusions

For years now, the unique issues and mental health challenges that SGMYs commonly
face have been evidenced in considerable depth in the research literature. It is now timely
to start developing robust and evidence-informed interventions that seek to assist SGMYs
best manage their adolescent years, which are often experienced in unsupportive environ-
ments. This review provides an overview of the coping strategies designed to enhance
the mental wellbeing of SGMYs, and, as such, it can be used to support efforts in assisting
SGMYs to thrive. A range of strategies and interventions appear promising for use in
Web-based tools, in order to support the mental wellbeing of SGMYs. However, issues
around appropriately managing peer-to-peer online interactions and inclusion, especially
for youth who experience multiple social disadvantages, will require careful consideration.
