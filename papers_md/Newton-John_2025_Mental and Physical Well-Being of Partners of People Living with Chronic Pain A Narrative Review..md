Abstract: This narrative review aims to explore the mental and physical well-being of
partners of individuals living with chronic pain. Chronic pain not only affects those who
suffer from it, but also significantly impacts the lives of their partners; however, the impacts
on partners are not well recognised, despite extensive evidence indicating that their quality
of life can be equally affected. This review synthesises current literature to identify the
psychological and physical challenges faced by these partners, including increased stress,
anxiety, depression, and the potential for developing chronic health conditions themselves.
A search of Medline for “chronic pain” and “partner/spouse” from January 1990 to the
present was performed, and relevant articles were selected for review. The main findings
were that while partners often experience a range of negative physical and psychosocial
impacts on their quality of life, dyadic coping strategies can mitigate these effects. This
review underscores the importance of future research to develop targeted interventions
that address the unique needs of this population, promoting better health outcomes and
fostering resilience in the face of chronic pain.

An important element of primary romantic relationships is the idea that couples
undertake to support each other, despite the challenges that they may face in life. Couples
in committed relationships accept the need to support each other—whether they are
physically and emotionally well, or they are not. This means that when one member of a
couple falls ill, there is an inevitable impact on the other member of the dyad—and that
couples need to understand they are accepting that those impacts may be part of a future
relationship together. As has been noted by Adelman and others, being a carer in support
of someone living with a chronic illness can bring with it a host of physical, psychosocial,
financial, and other stressors that significantly add to the strain for the person providing
care [1]. While this carer burden might be most evident where the chronic illness requires
obvious physical assistance, as, for example, in cerebral palsy or spinal cord injury, negative
impacts on the carer are not limited to these clinical groups. Partners of people living with
chronic pain can be similarly affected, and this is the topic of the present review.

1.1. Chronic Pain—Prevalence and Impacts on the Individual

Acute pain (defined as any short-term pain lasting less than three months) and sub-
acute pain (defined as pain lasting between six weeks and three months) are virtually

universal human experiences. They are also typically associated with defined tissue damage
or observable pathological processes [2–4]. Chronic pain, defined as pain that persists on
a more or less daily basis for longer than three months, is a surprisingly pervasive and
debilitating condition that the World Health Organization has recently estimated to affect
approximately 20% of adults worldwide [5]. It has also been estimated that chronically
painful conditions result in severe limitations in daily activities and quality of life for
upwards of 8% of adults in the USA alone—more than 17 million people [6]—with lower
back pain now the primary cause of disability worldwide out of 156 conditions assessed [7].
Unlike in acute or subacute pain states, in many cases, chronic pain develops slowly over
time, such as with arthritis or lower back pain conditions. Chronic pain can also develop
following a surgical intervention for relatively common reasons, such as a mastectomy, joint
replacement, or appendectomy; it is estimated that 10–50% of surgeries result in a persistent
pain state [2,3]. Chronic pain can also be the result of changes to the central nervous system;
hence, terms such as ‘central sensitization’ and ‘hypersensitivity’ are often used to denote
these chronic pain states which do not involve directly observable tissue damage.

It is no surprise then that given such widespread prevalence, there is a massive public
health and economic burden associated with chronic pain conditions. Data indicate that
the cost of diagnosing and managing pain already exceeds the costs associated with heart
disease, cancer and diabetes, and the financial impacts will only increase, as the prevalence
is expected to increase [4]. However, the costs associated with chronic pain are not solely
related to finance and economics. There are often considerable psychological difficulties for
a person with chronic pain (PWCP) that are associated with living with intractable chronic
pain over many months and years, despite many attempts to find a cure via treatments and
various interventions.

Depression is a common concomitant when pain limits the pursuit of activities that
used to provide purpose and meaning in life [8], such as engaging in family life, hobbies,
and social interactions. The effects of low mood can be compounded by problems with
sleep [9], making each worse in the presence of the other [10]. For a PWCP, anger, frustration
and a sense of injustice are also highly prevalent [11], particularly when the onset of the
pain condition is related to an injury or accident that is perceived to have been the fault of
another individual [12]. Reciprocal interactions between all of these negative emotional
states and the experience of pain are well documented [4], such that a mutual maintenance
cycle can be established. Mutual maintenance refers to the reciprocal and reinforcing
relationship between factors common to two conditions [13]. In this case, being in pain
has a negative effect on mood—and, as mood decreases, it leads to increased sensitivity
to pain [14]. Hence, each factor perpetuates or exacerbates the other, creating a cycle that
makes recovery from either condition more challenging.

Finally, chronic pain often has significant impacts upon work and occupational func-
tioning [15], not solely due to the physical limitations associated with prolonged sitting,
standing, lifting and so on, but also due to cognitive effects of reduced concentration and
memory impairment [4,15] that frequently accompany persistent pain. There are obvious
financial implications associated with loss of work, but from a psychological perspective it
is more than that—the loss of identity, of social connection, of having a sense of value and
meaning in the world—all of these factors can be part of being employed [16]. Chronic pain,
and chronic lower back pain in particular, is a major obstacle to occupational functioning.
According to Schofield and colleagues, back pain and arthritis are the leading chronic
conditions associated with premature exits from the labour force [17].

1.2. Treatment of Chronic Pain

The management of chronic pain is challenging and complex, ideally involving an
interdisciplinary and multimodal approach that addresses both the biological and psychoso-
cial aspects of the condition [18]. Chronic pain treatments typically begin with intervention
therapies and may include spinal cord stimulation, injection treatments of steroids and
anaesthetics, or nerve ablation techniques [4]. Patients may be trialled on a range of differ-
ent pharmacological agents, either singularly or in combination, in an attempt to balance
the benefits of reducing pain with the costs of the inevitable side effects. Medications for
chronic pain include analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, antide-
pressants, and muscle relaxants. Physical therapies for chronic pain are also commonly
administered, and range from massage and traction to more active patient involvement
methods such as stretching and exercise-based treatments [19]. The therapeutic value of
providing patients with information about the neuroscience of chronic pain has also been
evaluated, both in conjunction with physiotherapy and as a stand-alone intervention [19].
However, the effectiveness and safety of these treatments vary widely and depend
on individual factors such as the type, intensity, duration, and cause of pain, as well as
the patient’s preferences, expectations, and adherence [18,20]. Moreover, some treatments,
especially opioids, have serious adverse effects and risks of misuse, addiction, and overdose,
leading to the opioid crisis that has claimed thousands of lives and harmed countless
others [20–22].

Unfortunately, while there are many different types of treatment for chronic pain as
have been outlined above, none of them are curative and sustained pain relief is a rarity
for PWCP [18]. Chronic pain is just that, a long-term, persistent condition, despite the best
efforts of those who treat it and those who seek relief from it.

1.3. Beyond the Individual

In contemporary Western society, more than 60% of adults either marry or cohabit [23].
Given all of the negative impacts that have been documented above regarding chronic
pain’s effects upon the individual, we can turn our attention now to the focus of this
article—the impact of chronic pain upon the partner. We have chosen to use the term
‘partner’ as synonymous with ‘significant other’, ‘spouse’, ‘romantic other’ and any other
term which refers to a primary, cohabiting relationship.

Why is it important to explore the mental health of the chronic pain partner as well as
the PWCP? Often, partners are not included when considering the ways in which living
with pain influences day-to-day functioning, which is a significant oversight considering
that dyadic adjustment is one of the most important contributors to mental health [24].
In fact, dyadic adjustment, or the extent to which partners adapt to one another, manage
conflict, and maintain satisfaction and cohesion in their relationship, is a stronger predictor
of mental health than the other way around [25]. This underlines the influence that
relationship factors have in terms of affecting individual well-being [26,27].

The importance of the partner is also critical when considering the reciprocity inherent
in close relationships. As will be shown, many studies have demonstrated how the well-
being of the PWCP can impact the partner, but the influence is bidirectional.

2. Impact of Chronic Pain on the Partner

As described above, extensive research has documented the effects of chronic pain
on the quality of life and well-being of the PWCP, however relatively less is known about
the effects on the partner of the PWCP. Therefore, a search of the Medline database was
performed by the first author using the Medical Subject Headings “chronic pain”, “partner”
and “spouse” from January 1990 to 1 July 2024. Articles considered relevant for this review

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

4 of 12

were selected and assessed, based on inclusion criteria relating to studies in which results
(either qualitative or quantitative) reported on the partner’s experience of chronic pain.
Studies relating to cancer pain or other terminal illnesses were not included. All authors
were involved in determining which articles would be included in the review. The research
that does exist (described below) demonstrates that partners experience a range of practical
demands, relationship changes, and challenges to their psychological and physical well-
being. This provides compelling insight into the importance of supporting both partners
when one (or both) have chronic pain.

2.1. Meeting Practical Demands

Partners of PWCP may experience significant disruption to daily routines, activities,
and quality of life. Both qualitative and quantitative studies have documented how partners
pick up additional household tasks and parenting responsibilities when the PWCP can no
longer meet these demands [28–33], with more than 50% of spouses in one study reporting
moderate to severe problems with duties around the house [34]. Partners also engage
in caregiving roles and ‘illness work’, including attending appointments, helping with
treatment decision making, and contributing to managing the medication, symptoms or
activities of the PWCP [31,32,35].

The impact of chronic pain on occupational functioning for PWCP was noted previ-
ously, but partners may also be affected here. If the PWCP is unable to work, partners
may need to return to work, increase their work hours or seek different or higher paid
employment due to financial pressure [29,30,32,36]. If the PWCP requires caregiving or
support at home, partners may take more flexible work, use leave, work from home, or
find employment closer to home [28,32,33,36]. One study found that 27% of spouses had a
change in their own work status as a result of their partner’s pain [29]. Financial limitations
may also result from the loss of income if the PWCP is not working or due to healthcare
costs [30,32–34,37] and 35% of the spouses of people with fibromyalgia reported a loss
of household income due to the pain condition [38]. Such challenges may affect quality
of life, and one study of the overall impact of a partner’s illness found that partners of
PWCP scored higher on a measure of impact than partners of people with various types of
cancer [34].

2.2. Relationship Changes

Consistently, studies show that chronic pain influences the nature of a relationship. Sex
and intimacy are frequently impacted, not only by pain itself, but also due to accompanying
fatigue, medication, mood changes or fear [31], and partners describe how their role changes
from one of being a lover to being a caregiver [28,30,32,33,36,37,39]. For example, in one
qualitative study of 26 partners of people living with chronic back pain receiving treatment
at an outpatient rehabilitation centre, one woman said “I love him and need him as a
husband. But I feel like his nurse” [35]. Male partners of women with fibromyalgia
described “facing a new sex life”, which involved resisting the loss of the couple’s sexuality
and finding ways to enhance intimacy and increase partner desire [39]. In contrast, partners
of people living with migraine described having to embrace the role as caregiver and find
satisfaction in caring for their spouse [37].

In addition to impacts on intimacy, chronic pain can cause relationship tension and
dissatisfaction. Partners of PWCP in one study described the difficulties of living with
a person who may be frustrated or angry, and the need to distance themselves from
the PWCP as a protective strategy [30]. Partners may feel it is inappropriate to ask for
support from the PWCP because of the inherent stress of living with pain on a daily basis
and therefore deliberately not communicate their own needs and wishes to the patient,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

5 of 12

resulting in a change to the give-and-take nature of the relationship [28,31,37]. Marital
dissatisfaction or relationship burden were reported by approximately 50% of partners of
PWCP [29,40] indicating that strain and tension occur for many couples (though this is not
always the case).

Several studies described how, for some couples, the communication, depen-
dency, team-work and compassion required when facing chronic pain together had
brought them closer together, and thus chronic pain can lead to both disconnection or
connection [28,36,37]. A recent qualitative evidence synthesis of 15 primary studies de-
scribed how in light of the challenges of living with chronic pain, partners may re-evaluate
their commitment to the relationship [28]. A negative re-evaluation could exacerbate dis-
satisfaction whereas a positive re-evaluation can lead to an enhanced level of commitment.
This review found that factors such as a lack of open communication, or heightened ex-
pressions of anger and fluctuating moods, were associated with greater relationship strain
for both patient and partner. Alternatively, expressions of care, compassion, and valuing
time together were the variables related to positive relationship adjustment [28]. Thus,
the effects of chronic pain on a couple’s relationship are highly dependent on the ways in
which couples are able to negotiate the stresses of the condition together, as the evidence
shows that while chronic pain is undeniably stressful, a deterioration in the quality of the
relationship is not an inevitable outcome if the previously mentioned positive relationship
variables can be realised.

In an attempt to understand how it is that, for some relationships, the development
of a chronic pain condition can lead to heightened stress and dissatisfaction, and for
other couples it leads to greater closeness and intimacy, attachment theory is increasingly
being considered [41,42]. Formed as a result of early life experiences of caregiving, adult
attachment styles are broadly categorised as secure or insecure [41]. Adults with a secure
attachment style are comfortable with having close relationships, but are not fearful of
being on their own; by contrast, insecurely attached adults may either avoid intimacy
at all costs (avoidant attachment) or cling desperately to a relationship despite obvious
negative consequences (anxious attachment). As will be discussed later in this review, the
role that attachment style may play in influencing a couple’s adjustment to chronic pain is
of increasing importance.

2.3. Psychological Well-Being

Supporting a partner with chronic pain and its associated demands may cause emo-
tional distress as couples navigate complex changes and losses. First, partners of PWCP may
experience social isolation and loneliness [28,38]. Partners describe being unable to commit
to social events themselves or as a couple, and report that friendships are affected [33,36,37].
Friends or relatives may distance themselves from the couple due to judgement or social
stigma regarding the chronic pain [30,38]. Partners may also receive less support from
within their relationship; for example, they may sacrifice their own emotional needs to
prioritise supporting the PWCP, or even conceal their own negative thoughts and emotions
to stay positive and supportive [28,32].

Second, partners also describe heightened experiences of negative emotions as they
manage and come to terms with living with PWCP and the loss and grief this may include.
Partners in several studies discussed “endless uncertainty”, fear or worry they experience
due to the pain and the effect it may have on the couple’s future life [28,30,31,36]. They
may experience a sense of helplessness at seeing the PWCP suffering and not being able
to help [43], as well as a desire to protect and shield their spouse [36,44]. Partners report
experiencing frustration or anger as a result of the pain [31,43], or directed towards the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

6 of 12

PWCP [30]. This negative emotion could then be compounded by a sense of guilt or
self-blame about the resentment they experience [28,30].

Third, the partners of PWCP may be at higher risk of depression. Higher rates of
depression have been reported in partners of PWCP relative to community samples [40] and
partners of healthy individuals [38]. However, rates of depression remain lower in partners
relative to the PWCP [40], and in one study elevated levels of depression were attributable
to chronic pain symptoms in the partners themselves, noting that many partners also
experience pain [45]. Several studies suggest that these negative mood states may be
directly related to the chronic pain condition, as partner mood or distress has been linked
to the disease severity [46], or the pain intensity of the PWCP [47], or the couple’s approach
to coping with pain [48].

2.4. Physical Well-Being

Relatively little research has assessed the physical health of partners of PWCP. Al-
though evidence shows that caregiving for a spouse, in general, is associated with increased
cardiovascular risk [49], supporting a partner with chronic pain specifically may be differ-
ent from caring for a partner with one of the degenerative or terminal conditions typically
included in caregiver studies. In one study which did explore cardiovascular health, rates
of high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease were similar between the partners of
people with fibromyalgia (a common chronic pain condition) and the partners of healthy
people [38], suggesting cardiovascular risk may not be increased in chronic pain states.
Interestingly, it has been found that partners of PWCP display heightened autonomic
arousal when observing their spouse displaying pain compared to observing their partner
with a neutral facial expression [50], but whether this arousal ends up affecting health in
the longer term is unclear.

Interestingly, partners of PWCP may experience elevated levels of pain themselves.
Partners of PWCP reported more pain symptoms relative to spouses of people with
diabetes [40], and one study found that nearly half of partners of PWCP report pain
problems such as knee pain, lower back pain or osteoarthritis themselves [45]. Partners
may also experience sleep problems, with one diary study demonstrating that patients’
daily knee pain intensity predicted partners’ sleep quality [51].

3. Interventions for Couples with Chronic Pain

Chronic pain interventions have typically been delivered at the individual level of
the person with chronic pain (PWCP) and often do not address the social context in which
the PWCP exists. Intimate partner relationships and those in these relationships are an
important part of a person’s social context and are frequently impacted by the presence of
chronic pain [29], while also impacting chronic pain [52]. In recognising the importance
of the partner and relational factors, work has been carried out to explore the impact of
including partners of PWCP in chronic pain interventions. Smith and colleagues recently
carried out a systematic review of 23 studies assessing couples’ interventions for chronic
pain [53]. Educating couples about chronic pain was the most common strategy (83% of
studies), with teaching relaxation or meditation skills to both patient and partner being the
next most common type of intervention (48% of studies). In terms of outcome variables
assessed, pain intensity was assessed in 15/23 studies (65%) and either a measure of
physical function and/or psychological well-being was assessed in 70% of studies [53].

However, when comparing couples-based interventions with interventions delivered
to the patient only, or with waiting list control groups, this review revealed only modest
benefits for couples-based treatments. Only two studies reported significant reductions
in patients’ pain intensity [54,55], while six studies reported improvements in patients’

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

7 of 12

pain-related outcomes, e.g., depression, pain coping, and functioning [54,56–60]. These
results suggest that the overall impact of couples’ interventions for chronic pain may be
somewhat limited.

One explanation for the modest benefits observed in these interventions is that, in most
cases, the PWCP remains the primary focus of treatment, while the partner is included in a
supportive or coaching role, such as in partner-assisted coping skills training [53,61]. No-
tably, only a small subset of studies have measured outcomes for the partner [58–60,62–64],
and among those that have, only a few report significant improvements [65–67]. Thus, it
seems that the partner’s well-being and the relationship are not being targeted in these inter-
ventions, and hence partners are not benefitting. Given the importance of partner well-being
and relationship factors in the context of chronic pain, a more relational approach—one that
targets both the partner and the relationship itself—could help mitigate the interpersonal
strain and the individual distress associated with chronic pain.

Research has begun to explore relational factors in couples with chronic pain, in
particular in relation to dyadic coping. Dyadic coping refers to the ways in which stress
is managed at the level of the couple, rather than at an individual level [68]. Recent work
examining the role of dyadic coping in couples with chronic pain found that negative
dyadic coping was associated with poorer relationship quality, as well as higher levels of
depression, anxiety, and stress for both the PWCP and the partner [48]. In contrast, positive
dyadic coping was linked to better relationship quality and reduced depressive symptoms
in the partner [48]. While research in this area is relatively new, some promising findings
have emerged from interventions that directly target partner well-being and relational
factors. For example, a motivational interviewing assessment intervention led to significant
reductions in pain severity (self- and partner-reported), negative mood, and increased
marital satisfaction compared to an educational control [69]. Similarly, an intervention
focusing on psychological and relational flexibility in couples showed reductions in pain
and pain-related interference for the PWCP, along with increased social engagement for
the partner [70]. Both members of the couple also reported enhanced emotional intimacy,
physical affection, and overall relationship satisfaction [70]. Such work highlights the
value of addressing relationship factors for chronic pain couples, not just the needs of
the PWCP, to provide meaningful benefits to both partners. However, as is the case for
much of this clinical area, more research is needed to fully explore the potential benefits of
these approaches.

4. Conclusions

There is substantial literature demonstrating a range of negative impacts of living with
persistent pain for individuals. However, this review has highlighted that the partners of
PWCP can also experience a range of physical and mental consequences which are much
less frequently taken into account. Research has shown that chronic pain-related effects,
such as mobility restriction, depression and anxiety, sleep disturbance, and work impair-
ments do not only affect the PWCP; they are also experienced by the partner. Relationship
roles and satisfaction, sex and intimacy are all affected. Similarly, research has shown that
coping with the negative effects of chronic pain can occur at the level of the dyad and not
just for the individual with pain. Dyadic coping improves outcomes for both members of
the couple. Examples of dyadic coping include the partner playing an active role in decision
making about pain treatment, the PWCP not always prioritising their pain management
requirements and instead considering the partner’s needs and wishes, and finally when
communication between the couple is empathic and supportive.

This review has shown that treatments for chronic pain couples have historically
not taken the partner’s health into account, despite the evidence that many partners are

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

8 of 12

negatively affected by the consequences of pain—which can in turn negatively impact
the PWCP. The development of future interventions for chronic pain couples will need
to consider issues of diversity, the role of attachment style in both members of the dyad,
and a move away from a partner-as-coach orientation towards a relational approach which
addresses the needs of both members of the couple.

5. Future Directions

Having outlined the current status of research and the various ways in which chronic
pain can impact the well-being of both the PWCP and the partner, it is possible to consider
the areas that remain inadequately addressed in this research area. First among them is the
fact that to a large extent, the literature on couples is based on cross sectional observations
of white, middle class, heterosexual couples in long term, stable relationships. This research
bias has meant that little is known about the impact of pain on relationships across time, as
well as the processes involved in relationship adjustment (or failure to adjust) over time. It
also means that little is known about the unique experiences of couples from non-European
cultures, including those who form parts of racial minority groups in Western countries,
as well as those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Given that ethnicity and socio-
economic status are known factors associated with chronic pain [71,72], this is a significant
omission in the literature.

Knowledge in this area is also limited by a lack of longitudinal research. For exam-
ple, theoretical models relating to solicitousness [73] hypothesise that partner responses
to patient expressions of pain behaviour exert an influence on patient functioning when
delivered repeatedly over time [74]. However, in order to confirm this theoretical propo-
sition, longitudinal research designs are required to assess the effect of ongoing partner
behaviours—but these are very much lacking in this area. As was previously noted, there
is a further research limitation in that relatively few studies in this area have measured
outcomes for both patients and their partners [58–60,62–64], despite the emphasis on
relationship dynamics.

Another area that has shown promise but is yet to be fully explored is the role of
attachment theory and chronic pain couples’ adjustment [41,42]. Insecure attachment has
been identified as a reliable predictor of poor coping with both acute and chronic pain at
the individual level. Attachment theory further suggests that the dyadic interactions of
anxiously attached and avoidantly attached individuals will be quite different [42], and
hence will require different kinds of intervention. However, we do not yet know how
these differing types of insecure attachment exert their influence on patient communication
styles in their intimate relationships, and nor is there research exploring how the part-
ner’s attachment style interacts with that of the patient when it comes to issues such as
spousal solicitousness [73,74]. There is substantial evidence that partners can inadvertently
reinforce patient communications or expressions of pain over time [50,73–75]; however,
this does not impact all couples in the same way. Some PWCP report being highly de-
sirous of their partner’s attentive responses when they are in pain, hence the potential for
pain behaviours to be reinforced; others report a preference for being ‘left to get on with
it’ [44]—the attachment styles of both patient and partner are likely to play a significant
role in these interactions.

And finally, in relation to treatment itself, the next iteration of couples-based chronic
pain interventions will likely involve a greater focus on the communication of empathy
and less of a focus on applying concepts from operant behavioural theory [75,76]. As was
noted previously, many of the early chronic pain couple’s treatment studies were primarily
directed at improving patient functioning using a partner-as-coach/guide approach, rather
than testing treatments aiming to improve the functioning of the relationship. Partner

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2025, 22, 205

outcomes were often not even assessed, as these interventions were not intended to address
relationship factors (as relationship factors were not considered integral to optimal patient
outcomes). Rather, they were designed to teach the partner how to notice and reinforce the
PWCP’s well behaviours and avoid reinforcing pain behaviours [63,67]. While these inter-
ventions had solid theoretical foundations, the evidence for their effectiveness is relatively
modest. As such, there is a need for future treatment outcome studies to explore the role
of empathic communication in pain couples’ interactions, rather than persist with narrow
behavioural conceptualizations of dyadic exchanges. Understanding the mechanisms by
which pain behaviour expression and solicitous responding build empathy [68,75,76] is
likely to lead to interventions which can significantly improve the quality of life for both
patient and partner.

6. Summary

By definition, chronic pain is a long-term health condition, and there is now a sub-
stantial amount of evidence to show that it often has a wide range of negative impacts
for individuals living with pain, as well as for their partners. When considering the next
steps in the field, we hope that this review encourages clinicians working with chronic pain
patients to routinely ask about relationship changes and partner coping when carrying out
an initial assessment with a patient. This information can be valuable when formulating as
to the causes and/or maintaining factors in a patient’s presentation. As we have shown,
principles from attachment theory can be usefully applied to assist in interpreting patient
and partner behaviour in the context of a chronic pain condition. With regard to research,
we have argued that the next major progressions in this area will come from research
design improvements (greater participant diversity, more longitudinal assessment, regular
inclusion of partner outcomes), and from an updating of the treatments themselves. With a
greater emphasis on enhancing dyadic coping strategies and the optimisation of couple
communications, we look forward to seeing a significant reduction in the psychosocial
burden of chronic pain for both patients and their partners.
