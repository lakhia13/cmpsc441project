Abstract  Somatic disorders occur more often in adult psy-
chiatric patients than in the general adult population. How-
ever, in child and adolescent psychiatry this association is 
unclear, mainly due to a lack of integration of existing data. 
To address this issue, we here present a systematic review 
on  medical  comorbidity  in  the  two  major  developmental 
disorders  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  and  attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and formulate clini -
cal  recommendations.  The  literature  was  searched  using 
the PubMed and PsycINFO databases (2000–1 May 2016) 
with the keywords “[((child and adolescent) AND (Autism 
OR Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder* OR ADHD)) 
AND  (“Cardiovascular  Diseases”  [Mesh]  OR  “Endocrine 
System Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Immune System Diseases” 
[Mesh] OR “Neurobehavioral Manifestations” [Mesh] OR 
“Gastrointestinal Disorders” [Mesh] OR Somatic OR Auto-
immune disease OR Nervous system disease OR Infection 
OR Infectious disease)]. Two raters independently assessed 
the  quality  of  the  eligible  studies.  The  initial  search 

identified  5278  articles.  Based  on  inclusion  and  exclu -
sion  criteria  104  papers  were  selected  and  subsequently 
subjected  to  a  quality  control.  This  quality  was  assessed 
according to a standardized and validated set of criteria and 
yielded  29  studies  for  inclusion.  This  thorough  literature 
search provides an overview of relevant articles on medical 
comorbidity  in ADHD  and/or ASD,  and  shows  that  medi-
cal  disorders  in  these  children  and  adolescents  appear  to 
be  widespread.  Those  who  work  with  children  with ASD 
and/or  ADHD  should  be  well  aware  of  this  and  actively 
promote  routine  medical  assessment.  Additionally,  case–
control studies and population-based studies are needed to 
provide reliable prevalence estimates. Future studies should 
furthermore focus on a broader evaluation of medical disor-
ders in children and adolescents with ADHD and/or ASD to 
improve treatment algorithm in this vulnerable group.

Medical  disorders  occur  more  often  in  adult  psychiat-
ric  patients  than  in  the  general  population  [1].  Moreo-
ver,  somatic  symptoms  may  cause  or  enhance  psychiatric 
symptoms  [2–4]. A  comprehensive  review  of  comorbidity 
of  mental  and  medical  disorders  in  adults  was  presented 
by The  Robert Wood  Johnson  Foundation  in  2011,  which 
included  its  the  prevalence,  origins  and  models  for  effec-
tive  treatment  [5].  More  than  68%  of  adults  with  a  men-
tal  disorder  had  at  least  one  medical  condition.  Thereby, 
comorbidity was associated with elevated symptom burden,

functional  impairment,  decreased  length  and  quality  of 
life  and  increased  costs.  The  pathways  between  psychiat-
ric symptoms and medical disorders are mostly, if known, 
complex  and  bidirectional.  For  example,  adults  with 
hypothyroidism  are  at  risk  for  mood  disorders  [6,  7],  and 
patients  with  schizophrenia  and  bipolar  disorder  have  an 
increased  risk  of  developing  metabolic  syndrome,  due  to 
their psychiatric disease as well as the use of antipsychotic 
drugs [8, 9]. Moreover, adults with mental health problems 
are more likely to have sedentary lifestyles and poor diets 
[5]. Different studies showed that patients with schizophre-
nia, bipolar disorder, or major depression, report less physi-
cal activity compared with those without mental disorders, 
and tend to eat foods that are high in fat and calories while 
avoiding fruits and vegetables [10, 11].

The  increased  risk  for  mental  health  problems  has  also 
been  found  in  children  with  medical  disorders.  Findings 
of the Isle of Wight studies of Sir Michael Rutter and col-
leagues  [12]  starting  in  1964–1965,  already  reported  that 
12% of children with somatic disorders (non-neurological) 
exhibited mental health problems compared to 7% of chil-
dren in the general population [13, 14]. Also, significantly 
higher  rates  of  mental  health  problems  were  reported  in 
children  with  epilepsy:  29%  in  children  with  uncompli-
cated epilepsy and 58% in those with complicated epilepsy 
(i.e., structural brain abnormalities and seizures).

Several  systematic  reviews  have  been  published  on 

the  association  between  specific  medical  disorders  and 
child  psychiatric  disorders,  for  instance  on  the  associa-
tion  between  epilepsy  and  psychopathology  [15],  atopic 
diseases  and  mental  health  [16,  17],  inflammation  and 
neuropsychiatry  [18],  headaches/migraine  and  psychopa-
thology [19, 20], HIV/AIDS and mental health [21], gastro-
intestinal  dysfunction  and ASD  [22],  immune  factors  and 
ASD [23], phenylketonuria and ADHD [24]. Aldinger and 
colleagues  aimed  to  identify  clustering  of  medical  disor-
ders  in  children  with  autism.  In  this  study,  the  prevalence 
of  medical  conditions  ranged  from  10.7  to  77.4%.  A  co-
occurrence  of  sleeping  problems  and  gastro-intestinal  dis-
turbances in children with autism was found. Also, the co-
occurrence  of  gastro-intestinal  disturbances,  seizures  and 
sleep  problems  predicted  more  severe  behavioral  symp-
toms in children with ASD [25]. Buie et al. concluded that 
medical disorders, such as gastro-intestinal problems, occur 
commonly in individuals with ASD [26]. However, medical 
conditions may remain undiagnosed in children with ASD 
due  to  atypical  presentation  of  symptoms.  Nonverbal  or 
minimally verbal ASD individuals cannot verbally express 
pain  or  discomfort  and  instead  often  demonstrate  their 
level  of  discomfort  through  disruptive  behaviors,  includ-
ing  aggressions  and  self-injury  [26].  Even  patients  with 
ASD  who  acquire  verbal  communication  skills  may  have 
difficulty  describing  subjective  experiences  or  symptoms. 

Clinicians should be aware that problem behavior in ASD 
may  be  the  primary  or  sole  symptom  of  the  underlying 
medical  disorder.  Even  more  so,  Schieve  and  colleagues 
showed  that  children  with  specific  developmental  delays 
(autism, ADHD, learning disorder and intellectual disabil-
ity)  were  more  likely  to  have  certain  medical  conditions 
than children without these delays [27]. Based on this find-
ing, Schieve and colleagues state that children with devel-
opmental  delays  require  increased  pediatric  health  ser-
vices and specialist services, both for their core functional 
deficits  as  for  their  health  problems  [27].  However,  these 
results were based on parents or caregivers report, without 
clinical  confirmation  on  developmental  delays  or  medical 
conditions.

Following  the  data  from  reviews  and  clinical  studies, 
Merikangas  and  colleagues  performed  a  study  on  comor-
bidity  of  mental  and  physical  conditions  and  functional 
impairments in 9014 children and adolescents [28]. In par-
ticular, a strong association between ADHD and neurologic 
disorders (seizures and epilepsy) was found. This associa-
tion between neurologic disorders that affect brain systems 
and behavioral disorders is in line with other studies exam-
ining developmental disorders such as autism, ADHD, and 
neurobehavioral  problems  [29,  30].  It  may  implicate  dys-
function  in  the  underlying  network  and  common  genetic 
and/or environmental risk factors [31–34].

In  a  previous  pilot  study  we  evaluated  the  outcome 
of  medical  screening  at  referral  in  children  and  adoles-
cents  with  different  psychiatric  disorders.  This  screening 
revealed new somatic findings in 56% of the subjects [35]. 
These findings included a broad spectrum of medical con-
cerns,  including  weight  and  length  problems,  high  levels 
of  thyroid  hormone,  dyslipidemia,  anemia,  vitamin  D  and 
vitamin  B12  deficiency  and  dysmorphic  anomalies.  Some 
of  these  results  required  consultation  from  other  medical 
specialists, whereas others had direct implications for daily 
medical practice, such as adjustments in psychopharmaco-
logic treatment and/or participation in prevention programs 
for overweight.

These findings all contribute to the increasing awareness 
about  the  association  between  somatic  and  mental  symp-
toms in developmental disorders and may suggest potential 
mechanisms such as common genetic pathways [28]. Also, 
the  simultaneous  assessment  of  medical  and  psychiatric 
disorders could be of major value. It seems important that 
the  interpretation  of  meaningful  somatic  findings  is  done 
by clinicians who are able to relate these findings to differ -
ential diagnostic considerations for both medical and psy-
chiatric interventions.

Most of the available literature on medical disorders in 
child  and  adolescent  psychiatric  disorders  relates  to ASD 
and  ADHD,  but  there  is  a  lack  of  integration  of  existing 
data,  hampering  the  interpretation  of  findings.  Therefore, 

1 3

this systematic review focuses on the association of medi-
cal  disorders  with  autism  and/or  ADHD  in  children  and 
adolescents  and  provides  recommendations  for  future 
studies.  Our  hypothesis  is  that  children  with  ADHD  and 
ASD are at increased risk for a broad spectrum of medical 
disorders.

Methods

Search criteria

The  literature  was  searched  using  the  PubMed  and  Psy-
cINFO  databases  (January  2016)  with  the  following  key-
words:  [((child  and  adolescent) AND  (Autism  OR Atten-
tion  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder*  OR  ADHD))  AND 
(“Cardiovascular Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Endocrine System 
Diseases” [Mesh] OR “Immune System Diseases” [Mesh] 
OR  “Neurobehavioral  Manifestations”  [Mesh]  OR  “Gas-
trointestinal  Disorders”  [Mesh]  OR  Somatic  OR Autoim-
mune disease OR Nervous system disease OR Infection OR 
Infectious  disease)]. To  be  included  in  the  present  review, 
the articles had to be written in English language and pub-
lished between 2000 and the first of May 2016.

Screening procedure

First, the papers were screened on title and abstracts, which 
was  conducted  independently  by  two  of  the  authors  (JM 
and FV) in order to assess the eligibility of the studies. Sec-
ond, this selection of papers was screened based on the full 
text.  The  third  author  (WS)  was  consulted  in  case  of  dif-
ferences in scoring by the other two authors. The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were as follows.

3.  The  age  of  the  study  participants  was  18  years  or 
younger  including  population-based  studies  started 
during childhood with follow-up >18 years.

Exclusion criteria:

1.  Study design: case report, case series, letter to the edi-
tor,  editorial,  or  data  solely  presented  by  means  of  a 
poster presentation.

2.  Study  focus:  intervention  studies  in  which  subjects 
were selected for pharmacological treatment of ADHD, 
exposure  on  chemicals,  effects  of  dietary  supplemen-
tation,  perinatal  complications  and  studies  including 
mental retardation and/or syndromes.

Third, the quality of each study was assessed according 
to a standardized and validated set of criteria based on the 
protocols of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
[40].  The  papers  were  scored  independently  on  the  6  cri-
teria  below  by  2  raters  (JM  and  FV),  in  order  to  quantify 
the methodologic aspects and the quality standard of each 
study. Each study could obtain a maximum of 6 points (1 
point per criterion). Papers with a quality assessment score 
of 5 or higher were considered of high quality and selected 
for  this  review.  Inter-rater  disagreement  was  primarily 
solved by discussion or arbitration of a third rater (WS) to 
enhance uniformity in the scoring procedure. The following 
six criteria were used:

1.  Comparison  group(s):  the  presence  of  at  least  1  com-
parison  group  (control  group),  preferably  a  sample  of 
healthy children from the same population or region as 
the children with medical disorders or ASD/ADHD.
2.  Sample  selection:  a  random  selection  strategy  should 

Inclusion criteria:

be used.

1.  Sample subjects had to fulfill criteria for autism spec-
trum disorders (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorders (ADHD) by DSM-IV [36], DSM-IV-R [37], 
DSM  5  [38]  or  ICD-10  [39]  or  scores  above  a  clini-
cal threshold obtained using instruments for the assess-
ment  of  ADHD  or  ASD.  ASD  encompasses  autistic 
disorders, Asperger’s  disorder  and  pervasive  develop-
mental  disorder-not  otherwise  specified  (PDD-NOS) 
within  the  DSM  classification  system,  and  childhood 
autism,  infantile  autism,  atypical  autism  and  Asper-
ger’s syndrome in the ICD classification system. Con-
sidering  the  diagnosis  of ADHD,  studies  on  attention 
deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity were both 
included.

2.  A  medical  or  somatic  disorder  diagnosed  by  a  clini-
cian,  from  National  Health  Surveys  or  databases,  or 
parents’ report.

3.  Design:  a  case–control  design  based  on  quantitative 

information or population-based cohort studies.

4.  Diagnostic validity: DSM criteria, ICD 10 by clinicians 

(not only by parent, teacher or self- reports).

5.  Outcome measures: medical disorder or ASD/ADHD.
6.  Statistical analyses: hypothesis testing using appropri-

ate statistical analyses should be performed.

Results

The  initial  search  yielded  in  total  5278  papers  (1783 
and  3495  hits,  respectively,  of  which  55  duplicates). 
4665  papers  were  excluded  according  to  the  title  and/
or  the  abstract  and  451  were  excluded  based  on  the  full 
text. The remaining 104 papers were scored of which 29 
papers were considered of high quality (5 or 6 points) and 
presented in this review. Two of these 29 papers focused 

1 31096

on both ADHD and ASD, and are therefore listed in both 
tables (see Fig. 1).

Table  1  presents  the  papers  that  studied  the  associa-
tion  between  ASD  and  medical  disorders:  5  papers  on 
immunology,  6  papers  on  gastroenterology,  1  paper  on 
neurology  and  2  papers  on  other  medical  disorders  (see 
Table  1).  In  Table  2,  the  papers  are  listed  that  studied 
ADHD and medical disorders: 12 papers on immunology, 
1 paper on neurology and 4 papers on other medical dis-
orders (see Table 2).

ASD and immunology

With  regard  to  a  possible  association  between ASD  and 
immunological  disorders,  most  papers  studied  allergic 
disease  or  autoimmune  disease.  Jyonouchi  et  al.  evalu-
ated whether one could clinically distinguish a subset of 
children  with  ASD  and  immunological  disorders  from 
other ASD children based on the frequency of infections 
[41]. In this sample, no significant differences were found 
considering the prevalence of atopy, asthma, food allergy, 
primary immunodeficiency between children in the ASD 
test group and controls (ASD controls, non-ASD controls 
with food allergy, non-ASD controls with frequent infec-
tions and normal controls).

Chen  et  al.  concluded,  however,  that  the  presence  of 
any  atopic  disease  in  early  childhood  increased  the  risk 
of developing ASD (hazard ratio: (HR) 3.40) in later life 
[42]. Greater numbers of atopic comorbidities (4 comor-
bidities  HR:  4.29)  were  significantly  related  to  a  greater 
risk of developing ADHD and ASD.

Gentile et al. found similar rates of contact with Her-
pes Simplex Virus 1 and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 between 
children with ASD and healthy controls [43].

The  study  of  Puig-Alcatraz  et  al.  found  that  the 
increase  in  homocysteine  concentration,  suggestive  for 
disorders  of  the  immune  system,  was  significantly  cor -
related with the severity of the deficit in communication 
skills  in  children  with ASD,  but  was  unrelated  to  deficit 
in  socialization  or  repetitive/restricted  behavior  com-
pared to typically developing children [44].

Contrary  to  the  study  of  Jynouchi  et  al.,  Zerbo 
et  al.  reported  that  allergies  and  autoimmune  diseases 
were  diagnosed  significantly  more  often  among  chil-
dren  with  autism  than  among  controls  (allergy:  20.6 
vs.  17.7%,  crude  odds  ratio  (OR) 
dence  interval  (CI)  1.13–1.31;  autoimmune  disease:  1 
vs.  0.76%,  OR 
  1.36,  95%  CI  1.01–1.83),  and  asthma 
was  diagnosed  significantly  less  often  (13.7  vs.  15.9%; 
OR 
  0.83,  95%  CI  0.76–0.90)  [45].  Furthermore,  pso-
riasis was seen more often in cases than in controls (0.34 
 2.35, 95% CI 1.36–4.08).

ASD and gastroenterology

The study of Valicenti et al. found that children with ASD 
had  a  significantly  higher  rate  of  gastro-intestinal  (GI) 
symptoms  than  children  with  either  typical  development 
or  other  developmental  disabilities  (history  of  GI  symp-
toms 70 vs 28 vs 42%, abnormal stool pattern 18 vs 4 vs 
2%, food selectivity 60 vs 22 vs 36%) [46]. There was no 
association between a family history of autoimmune dis-
ease and GI symptoms in children with ASD.

The  longitudinal  population-based  study  of  Mour-
idsen  et  al.  found  no  evidence  that  patients  with  infan-
tile  autism  (IA)  were  more  likely  than  controls  to  have 
defined  gastro-intestinal  diseases  during  a  30.3-year 
observation period (30.5% against 30.7%) [47]. Only dis-
eases  of  oral  cavity  (dental  problems)  were  significantly 
associated with IA (20.3 vs 1.2%, p value < 0.0001).

In  the  study  of  Wang  et  al.,  parents  retrospectively 

reported  significantly  more  GI  problems  in  children 
with  ASD  (249/589;  42%)  compared  with  their  unaf-
fected  siblings  (20/163;  12%)  (p  <  0.001)  [43].  The  2 
most  common  gastro-intestinal  problems  in  children 
with ASD were constipation (20%) and chronic diarrhea 
(19%).  Next,  individuals  with  ASD  were  grouped  into 
3  autism  severity  groups  (Full  Autism,  Almost  Autism, 
and  Spectrum)  based  on  their  Autism  Diagnostic  Inter-
view-Revised  and Autism  Diagnostic  Observation  Scale 
scores.  Increased  autism  symptom  severity  was  associ-
ated with higher odds of gastro-intestinal problems (AOR 
for trend 

 2.63, 95% CI: 1.56–4.45).

The  increased  prevalence  of  GI  symptoms  was  also 
found  by  Chandler  et  al.  In  this  study,  46.5%  of  children 
with ASD had at least one individual lifetime GI symptom 
compared with 21.8% of typically developing children and 
29.2% of the children with special educational needs [48]. 
No association was found between GI symptoms and intel-
lectual  ability,  ASD  severity,  ASD  regression  or  a  faddy 
diet  (arbitrary  and  often  unusual  likes  and  dislikes  about 
food).

the  same  frequency  of  gastric,  intestinal  and  hepatic  dis-
eases as had controls [49].

The study of Von Gontard et al. showed increased rates 
of  nocturnal  enuresis  (30.0  vs  0%)  and  daytime  urinary 
incontinence  (25.0  vs  4.7%)  in  children  with  ASD  com-
pared  to  controls.  Furthermore,  ASD  children  had  more 
lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (LUTS)  especially  urgency 
and  postponement,  and  they  needed  a  longer  time  to 
become dry and continent [50].

The  study  of  Mouridsen  et  al.  compared  prevalence 
rates  of  gastro-intestinal  tract  diseases  (esophagus,  stom-
ach,  duodenum,  gall  bladder,  biliary  tract,  pancreas,  liver, 
peritoneum, intestines) in patients with PDD-NOS. In this 
study, conducted with data from the Danish National Hos-
pital Register, the difference in prevalence of children with 
autism  (24.7%  (22/88))  and  at  least  one  diagnosis  of  any 
disease  of  the  gastro-intestinal  tract  was  not  statistically

ASD and neurology

Mouridsen et al. studied the prevalence of epilepsy among 
patients  with  Asperger’s  syndrome  using  the  Danish 
National  Hospital  Register  [51].  In  a  follow-up  period  of 
4–18 years, patients with Asperger’s syndrome were more 
likely  to  have  epilepsy  (3.9%  in  4180  cases)  in  compari-
son  with  the  estimated  prevalence  of  2%  in  the  general 
population.

the  general  practitioners’  practice,  in  order  to  enhance 
early  detection  and  reduce  the  delay  in  diagnosing  ASD. 
This  study  found  that  children  with  ASD  presented  with 
more  traumata  (luxations  and  distortions)  (OR  6.57, 
p-value  <  0.01)  compared  to  controls.  Also,  they  were 
more  likely  referred  to  the  physiotherapist/ergotherapist

p-value  <  0.05)  and  ear–nose–throat  specialist  (OR  5.54, 
p-value < 0.05) [52].

Using data from the Swedish Patient Register, Butwicka 
et  al.  studied  the  prevalence  of  ASD  in  men  with  hypo-
spadias  (n 
  9626)  [53].  Hypospadias  is  associated  with 
autism (OR 3.20; 95% CI 2.8–3.8) compared to full broth-

ADHD and immunology

This  review  includes  12  papers  on  the  association 
between  ADHD  and  immunological  disorders.  The 
study of Leslie et al. [48] showed that prior streptococ-
cal  infection  was  associated  with  obsessive–compulsive 

disorder,  tic  disorders,  major  depressive  disorder.  Stud-
ies  have  suggested  a  link  between  Group A  beta-hemo-
lytic  streptococcal  (GABHS)  infections  and  the  onset 
or  worsening  pediatric  obsessive–compulsive  disor-
der  (OCD),  Tourette’s  syndrome  (TS)  and  tic  disorder. 
The  prepubertal  onset  of  OCD, TS,  or  tic  disorder  with 
abrupt  symptom  exacerbation  after  streptococcal  infec-
tion  has  been  termed  PANDAS  (pediatric  autoimmune 
neuropsychiatric  disorders  associated  with  streptococ-
cal  infection).  Furthermore,  this  study  showed  that 
some  patients  prior  to  their  initial  diagnosis  of  ADHD 
were more likely to have had a diagnosis of streptococ-
cal infection in the previous year than controls (OR 1.20, 
95%  CI  1.06–1.35)  [54]. Although ADHD  is  frequently 
comorbid  with  TS,  tic  disorders,  and  OCD,  comor-
bidity  of  ADHD  with  TS,  tic  disorders  and  OCD  were 
excluded. It remains unclear whether this is the result of 
a  nonspecific  stress  response  or  secondary  to  an  activa-
tion of the immune system.

The  study  of  Sanchez  et  al.  indicated  that  frequency 
of anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA) in children with 
ADHD  (non-comorbid  with  obsessive–compulsive  dis-
order  or  tics)  does  not  differ  from  that  in  matched  con-
trols (4 vs 4%), despite the fact that our ADHD patients 
had had more recent pharyngeal group A beta-hemolytic

With  regard  to  atopy,  the  study  of  Schmitt  et  al.  found 
a prevalence of ADHD among patients with atopic eczema 
(AE) of 5.2 and 3.4% among controls. Allergic comorbidi-
ties (asthma, allergic rhinitis) were not significantly associ-
ated with ADHD [56].

In a population-based study of Tsai et al. allergic rhinitis 
patients were more likely to have ADHD than the general 
population (p-value < 0.001) [58].

The  association  between  allergy  and  ADHD  was  also 
found  by  Shyu  et  al.  In  their  study,  allergic  children  have 
a higher risk for developing ADHD in comparison with the 
general  population  (p-value  <  0.001)  [59]. Allergic  rhini-
tis was found to be the most important contributing factor 
for the development of ADHD compared to the impact of 
bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis.

Chen  HJ  et  al.  found  a  significant  association  between 
previously  diagnosed  diabetes  mellitus  type  2  and ADHD 
  1.82–
in  children  aged  5–15  years  (OR  2.75,  95%  CI

1 and ADHD.

Using  the  National  Health  Insurance  Research  Data-
base, Chen MH et al. showed that patients with dual diag-
noses of ADHD and tic disorder had a significantly higher 
prevalence  of  allergic  diseases  including  allergic  rhini-
tis,  asthma,  atopic  dermatitis,  allergic  conjunctivitis  than 
the ADHD  alone  group,  the  tic  alone  group,  and  the  con-
trol group (allergic rhinitis 43 vs. 28.4 vs. 33.6 vs. 19.7%, 
p-value < 0.001, asthma (27.5 vs. 17.2 vs. 18.2 vs. 11.9%, 
p-value  <  0.001,  atopic  dermatitis  10.6  vs.  8.4  vs.  7.0  vs. 
5.9%, p-value < 0.001, allergic conjunctivitis 55.6 vs. 34.7 
vs. 43.5 vs. 26.3%, p-value < 0.001) [61].

The  study  of  Tsai  et  al.  found  a  higher  rate  of  allergic 
disease in children with ADHD compared to controls, par-
ticularly allergic rhinitis (OR 1.80 95% CI 1.69–1.93), and 
allergic  conjunctivitis  (OR  1.69;  95%  CI  1.58–1.81  [62]. 
Children  with  atopic  dermatitis  (OR  1.80;  95%  CI  1.58–
2.05) and asthma (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.24–1.78) were also 
at higher risk of ADHD. The risk of ADHD increased with 
numbers of allergic disease and age.

The  study  of  Bekdas  et  al.  presented  that  patients  with 

ADHD  displayed  significantly  higher  positivity  for  mea-
sles IgG (80 vs. 60%, p-value

Chen  MH  et  al.  found  that  the  presence  of  any  atopic 
disease  in  early  childhood  increased  the  risk  of  develop-
ing ADHD  (HR:  1.97)  in  later  life  [42].  Greater  numbers 
of  atopic  comorbidities  (4  comorbidities  HR:  2.53)  were 
significantly related to a greater risk of developing ADHD.

ADHD and neurology

Using  data  from 
the  Neurodevelopmental  Genomics 
Cohort Study, Merikangas et al. showed that children with 
central  nervous  system  conditions  (seizures  and  epilepsy) 
were  significantly  more  likely  to  have  ADHD  (OR  1.30, 
p-value < 0.001) [28]. There was no significant association 
between  ADHD  and  gastroenterological,  immunological, 
autoimmune,  cardiology,  hematology,  nephrology,  endo-
crine disorders.

ADHD and other medical disorders

The  study  of  DeMaso  et  al.  found  that  adolescents  with 
d-transposition of the great arteries showed increased rates 
of  attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  compared  to 
healthy  controls  (19  vs.  7%,  p-value 
  0.03)  [64].  In  the 
study of Dillon et al. 27.8% of the children that underwent 
adenotonsillectomy had ADHD, whereas only 7.4% of the 
control  group  had  ADHD  [65].  Among  the  22  children 
diagnosed with ADHD before surgery, 50% no longer met 
diagnostic criteria after adenotonsillectomy.

=

The  population-based  study  of  Silva  et  al.  showed  that 
children under 4 years with ADHD were 70% more likely 
to  be  admitted  to  a  hospital  compared  with  controls  [66]. 
Admissions for head injuries, burns, poisons, all other inju-
ries, diseases of the tonsils and adenoids, asthma and early 
infections were all more common in children with ADHD.

Next to ASD, Butwicka et al. also studied the prevalence 
of ADHD in men with hypospadias, and found an increased 
risk of ADHD in men with hypospadias (OR 1.50; 95% CI 
1.3–1.9) [53].

Discussion

The  main  finding  of  this  systematic  review  is  that  medi-
cal  disorders  in  children  with ASD  and ADHD  appear  to 
be  widespread,  e.g.,  can  manifest  across  different  medical 
areas,  such  as  immunology,  neurology  and  gastroenterol-
ogy. Although it was not possible to extract prevalence data 
for  the  medical  disorders,  a  reasonable  number  of  studies 
could be included in this review, which supports the notion 
that  children  and  adolescents  with  developmental  disor-
ders  such  as  ADHD  and  ASD  often  suffer  from  medical 
disorders that needs to be investigated and addressed [67]. 
Likewise, children with medical disorders are at increased 

1 31100

Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2017) 26:1093–1103

risk  for  developmental  disorders,  which  are  unfortunately 
not often recognized [52, 68]. Nevertheless, it is clear that 
these  children  require  multidisciplinary  medical  services, 
including psychiatric help [28].

Increased  awareness  about  the  prevalence  and  types  of 
comorbidity  of  medical  disorders  in  developmental  disor-
ders  is  important  for  several  reasons.  It  is  first  of  all  rel-
evant for treatment and care for patients and their parents. 
Also, it may provide important information for fundamen-
tal research and could help to create a better understanding 
of  the  disease  etiology  of ASD  and ADHD.  Furthermore, 
insight in specific patterns of comorbidity may have impor -
tant implications for the development of effective interven-
tions for these disorders [5].

However,  most  of  the  studies  that  were  identified  by 
our  initial  search  did  not  reach  the  required  level  of  qual-
ity to come to more profound interpretations, because they 
were  hampered  by  limitations  in  study  design,  in  limited 
case–control  matching  and/or  relied  on  parent,  teacher  or 
self-report  of  symptoms  rather  than  systematic  diagnostic 
assessments by experts.

First,  most  studies  provide  cross-sectional  data  thus 
limiting assessment of temporality and inference of causal 
pathways for the various conditions studied. Second, most 
studies  examine  the  impact  of  a  single  medical  comor-
bid  condition,  and  studies  that  looked  at  a  broad  range 
of  comorbid  medical  conditions  are  scarce.  Third,  the 
included studies sometimes show inconsistent results.

There  are  also  limitations  related  to  the  design  of  this 
systematic review. First of all, given the amount of research 
in child psychiatry, it has been decided to limit the current 
systematic  review  to  the  two  main  developmental  disor-
ders:  ASD  and  ADHD.  Consequently,  other  psychiatric 
disorders, such as Gilles de la Tourette syndrome or tic dis-
orders were not included in this review. As for sleeping dis-
order, it was decided to exclude these from the review since 
sleeping  disorders  are  frequently  not  viewed  as  specific 
medical disorder, but rather as part of a symptom complex 
of  several  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  For  a  recent  review 
on sleeping disorders in children with neurodevelopmental 
disorders, see the study by Blackmer and colleagues [69].

Second,  strict  criteria  for  methodologic  quality  of  the 
studies were used for the inclusion and consequently only 
29 studies were selected, out of more than 4000 studies that 
were  identified  in  our  initial  search.  Third,  we  excluded 
studies  that  were  not  published  in  English,  which  might 
have led to the exclusion of potentially relevant studies.

Bearing  these  limitations  in  mind,  several  strong 
aspects about this systematic review allow us to conclude 
that  a  valuable  overview  of  data  is  provided.  First,  the 
methodologic quality and strength of evidence of the var-
ious studies has been assessed in a systematic manner by 

using a standardized set of criteria. This helps to appreci-
ate  individual  studies  in  a  correct  manner.  Second,  two 
raters  independently  assessed  the  quality  of  the  studies, 
selected  from  two  databases,  with  a  standardized  set  of 
criteria.  An  additional  rater  was  consulted  in  case  of  a 
difference  in  scoring  by  the  other  two  raters.  Third,  by 
using  a  predefined  search  strategy,  the  potential  for  bias 
was reduced.

In conclusion, medical comorbidity in children and ado-
lescents with ASD and ADHD appears to occur in numer-
ous  medical  areas  [27,  70].  This  should  lead  to  a  criti-
cal  view  on  current  health  care  systems,  which  are  often 
marked  by  clear  divisions  between  medical  disciplines. 
The  data  of  this  review  clearly  point  to  a  multidiscipli-
nary and integrated approach for children and adolescents 
with ASD and ADHD. Moreover, collaborative care mod-
els  should  be  recommended  including  both  a  psychiatric 
and  medical  approach;  that  is  treatment  models  including 
screening  for  ADHD  and  ASD  in  primary  care  settings, 
and screening for common medical conditions in child and 
adolescent psychiatry. Thereby, clinicians should be aware 
that problem behavior in developmental disorders may be 
the only symptom of the underlying somatic disorder. Fur-
thermore, prevention programs are needed to address com-
mon risk factors for comorbid conditions, such as obesity, 
underweight, vitamin deficiency, hypo or hyperthyroidism 
and  dyslipidemia.  Identifying  and  treating  somatic  and 
psychiatric comorbidities will improve behavior and over-
all improve quality of life for both patient and family.

Also,  developmental  disorders  such  as  autism  can  be 
a feature of several underlying genetic syndromes, many 
of which also entail somatic symptoms. As such, a care-
ful analysis of the combination of ASD and somatic dis-
orders  requires  an  extensive  diagnostic  scheme  to  detect 
such  genetic  syndromes  to  consider  referral  to  a  clinical 
geneticist.  For  a  review  on  this  specific  topic,  see  the 
study by Cohen and colleagues [71].

With  respect  to  research  in  ASD  and  ADHD,  future 
studies should not only focus on psychiatric symptoms, but 
provide a broader evaluation of medical disorders, prefer-
ably with longitudinal studies. Likewise, it would also be 
worth  to  study  a  specific  group  of  medical  disorders  and 
comorbid  ADHD  and/or  ASD.  This  may  ultimately  help 
to  provide  a  more  personalized  treatment  approach  and 
broaden  our  insight  in  etiological  aspects  of  ASD  and 
ADHD.
