with stress. Therefore, we investigated the predictive value of affective and inhibitory pre- 
frontal control for stress burden during the COVID-19 crisis. Physical and mental health burden 
were assessed using an online survey, which was administered to 104 participants of an ongoing 
at-risk birth cohort during the ﬁrst wave in April 2020. Two follow-ups were carried out during 
the pandemic, one capturing the relaxation during summer and the other the beginning of the 
second wave of the crisis. Prefrontal activity during emotion regulation and inhibitory control 
were assessed prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Increased inferior frontal gyrus activity during emo- 
tion regulation predicted lower stress burden at the beginning of the ﬁrst and the second wave 
of the crisis. In contrast, inferior and middle frontal gyrus activity during inhibitory control 
predicted effective coping only during the summer, when infection rates decreased but stress 
burden remained unchanged. These ﬁndings remained signiﬁcant when controlling for sociode- 
mographic and clinical confounders such as stressful life events prior to the crisis or current 
psychopathology. We demonstrate that differential stress-buffering effects are predicted by 
the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and cognitive regulation at different stages 
during the pandemic. These ﬁndings may inform future prevention strategies to foster stress 
coping in unforeseen situations.

Introduction 

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is related to physical 
health impairments and dramatic changes to everyday life 
for hundreds of millions of people around the world. With 
the social contact restrictions beginning in March 2020 in 
Germany, nearly all schools were closed overnight, work- 
ing  environments  changed  radically,  and  social  life  was 
restricted  probably  as  never  before.  Early  studies  inves- 
tigating  the  impact  of  these  initial  “ﬁrst-level  threats”
(imminent threat) on mental health burden reported ele- 
vated  levels  of  perceived  stress,  anxiety,  and  depressive 
symptoms during the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic 
( Benke  et  al.,  2020a ,  b ).  While  sustained  socioeconomic 
“second-level threats” continued throughout the time when 
infection rates lowered during the summer, renewed ﬁrst- 
level health threats emerged at the beginning of the second 
wave of the pandemic in late 2020. 

Appropriate coping in response to these time-dependent 
challenges in the face of an ongoing crisis like the COVID-19 
pandemic requires the balanced use of emotional regula- 
tion and cognitive control strategies ( Feder et al., 2019 ). 
Indeed,  so  far,  several  studies  investigated  the  effect  of 
emotion regulation strategies and cognitive control on well- 
being  and  mental  health  during  the  pandemic.  Findings 
indicate that adaptive emotion regulation strategies pre- 
dicted increased well-being, whereas maladaptive emotion 
regulation strategies and deﬁcits in cognitive control pre- 
dicted  higher  levels  of  anxiety,  greater  depressive  symp- 
toms, reduced quality of life, risky health behavior, and di- 
minished well-being during the pandemic ( Appelhans et al., 
2021 ; Breaux et al., 2021 ; Brehl et al., 2021 ; Low et al., 
2020 ;  Panayiotou  et  al.,  2021 ;  Weissman  et  al.,  2021 ; 
Yang et al., 2020 ). While affective control, such as reap- 
praisal, involves the adaptive modulation of emotions in re- 
sponse  to  unpleasant  stimuli  ( Gross,  2015 ;  Holley  et  al., 
2017 ),  cognitive  control  includes  the  inhibition  of  inap- 
propriate  or  ineffective  behavior  ( Aron,  2007 ).  Both  are 
part  of  the  executive  function  system  ( Holley  et  al., 

2017 ) and reﬂected mainly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC; 
Davidson et al., 2000 ; Ochsner et al., 2002 ). Affective con- 
trol  strategies  are  associated  with  an  increased  activity 
primarily  in  the  inferior  frontal  gyrus  (IFG),  the  middle 
frontal gyrus (MFG), and the ventro-, medial- and dorsolat- 
eral PFC ( Gross, 2015 ; Kanske et al., 2011 ; Ochsner et al., 
2002 ). Cognitive inhibitory control is linked to activity in 
the fronto-basal-ganglia circuit including the MFG and the 
IFG ( Aron, 2007 , 2003 , 2004 ; Verbruggen and Logan, 2008 ), 
indicating shared neuronal underpinnings within the IFG and 
MFG. 

The present longitudinal study investigated the predic- 
tive  value  of  prefrontal  activity  during  an  emotion  regu- 
lation and an inhibitory control task assessed prior to the 
COVID-19  pandemic  for  stress  burden  during  the  COVID- 
19  crisis  in  104  participants  of  an  ongoing  at-risk  cohort 
study following participants since birth. Approximately four 
weeks after the initial lockdown in Germany in March 2020, 
participants rated their current stress burden in an online 
survey (baseline during the ﬁrst wave). Six to eight weeks 
later (ﬁrst follow-up) as well as six months later (at the be- 
ginning of the second wave of the pandemic; second follow- 
up),  participants  completed  the  same  questionnaire.  We 
expected that higher affective and cognitive control pre- 
dict  lower  stress  burden  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. 
Given the ongoing uncertainties about the course and du- 
ration of the pandemic and its unprecedented nature, we 
had no speciﬁc a-priori hypotheses about how neural ac- 
tivity predict stress burden at different stages of the pan- 
demic. However, based on previous ﬁndings ( Brehl et al., 
2021 ; Weissman et al., 2021 ; Yang et al., 2020 ), we spec- 
ulate that the ability to control emotions in order to over- 
come perceived stress burden would be highly necessary at 
the beginning of the ﬁrst wave of the COVID-19 crisis, when 
participants were confronted with direct threat due to high 
infection and death numbers (ﬁrst-level threat). By contrast 
and based on previous ﬁndings assessed during the course 
of the pandemic ( Appelhans et al., 2021 ), we anticipated 
that cognitive control would become increasingly important

in order to cope with the ongoing uncertainties during the 
pandemic (second-level threat). 

2.  Experimental procedures 

2.1.  Sample 

The  present  investigation  was  conducted  within  the  Mannheim 
Study of Children at Risk, an ongoing longitudinal study of the long- 
term outcomes of early psychosocial and biological risk factors fol- 
lowing participants since birth ( Laucht et al., 2000 ). The initial 
sample consisted of 384 children born between 1986 and 1988 in 
the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany. Infants were recruited from 
two obstetric and six children ´s hospitals and were included ac- 
cording to a two-factorial design intended to enrich and control 
the risk status of the sample (distribution in the current sample: 
37 (35.6%) participants without psychosocial risk, 35 (33.7%) with 
low psychosocial risk, and 32 (30.8%) with high psychosocial risk at 
birth). 

Up to the time of the lockdown on March 23rd 2020, 165 par- 
ticipants completed an ongoing assessment wave, including a com- 
prehensive questionnaire package on physical and mental health, a 
structured clinical interview (SCID-5-CV German version; ( Beesdo- 
Baum et al., 2019 )), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ses- 
sion, including an emotion regulation and stop-signal task (see be- 
low). In April 2020 (during the ﬁrst wave), two months later (ﬁrst 
follow up during summer), and six months later (second follow- 
up  in  December),  participants  were  invited  to  take  part  in  an 
online  COVID-19  questionnaire,  adapted  and  modiﬁed  from  the 
Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey (CRISIS, ( Nikolaidis et al., 
2020 )). 133 (80.61%) participants completed the COVID-19 base- 
line  assessment,  of  whom  128  (96.24%)  also  responded  to  the 
ﬁrst  follow-up  questionnaire  and  116  (87.21%)  to  the  second 
follow-up questionnaire. Functional MRI data were available for 
104  participants  for  the  baseline  and  ﬁrst  follow-up  question- 
naire, and for 95 participants for the second follow-up question- 
naire. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
University Heidelberg, Germany, written informed consent from 
all  participants  was  obtained,  and  participants  were  ﬁnancially 
compensated. 

2.2.  Stress burden during COVID-19 

To assess the impact and threat of COVID-19 on physical and mental 
health, we used four items (‘The impact of COVID-19 on my physical 
health is?’, ‘COVID-19 is a potential threat to my physical health’) 
and mental health (‘The impact of COVID-19 on my mental health 
is?’, ‘COVID-19 is a potential threat to my mental health’) rated 
on a 10-point Likert scale (0: completely disagree; 10: completely 
agree). We calculated a sum score for each assessment (baseline, 
ﬁrst follow-up, second follow-up). 

negative affect. The participants were carefully instructed to ei- 
ther view the depicted scenario from a more positive or at least a 
less negative point of view (e.g. a person in jail might be a famous 
actor) or to rationalize the presented picture (e.g. due to enor- 
mous advances in modern medicine, a very premature baby may 
have an entirely normal life). During the neutral conditions, par- 
ticipants were instructed to simply watch the depicted scenarios 
without actively changing their emotional state evoked by the pic- 
tures. 

The task consisted of a randomized block design, in which every 
block started with a jittered 3 s presentation of the instruction form 
(i.e. ‘Look’ or ‘Reappraise’). Subsequently, participants viewed 20 s 
blocks of negative or neutral pictures (each picture was presented 
for 5 s without an interstimulus interval) according to the presented 
condition, and were asked to rate the intensity of currently per- 
ceived negative feelings on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = no negative 
feelings at all; 7 = extremely negative feelings) via a button press 
(max 4 s). After that, a white ﬁxation cross on black background 
was presented during the inter-trial-interval up to a total block du- 
ration of 30 s. The total task comprised four blocks per condition 
(12 blocks in total) and lasted for 6 min 37 s. The blocks were ar- 
ranged in four runs with a randomized presentation of all conditions 
within each run, leading to a maximum of two presentations of the 
same condition in succession. 

2.4.  Inhibitory control 

2.4.1.  Inhibitory control task 
Participants completed the stop-signal task (SST) to assess cogni- 
tive inhibitory control during functional MRI ( Rubia et al., 2003 ). 
Each trial began with a ﬁxation cross (500 ms), which was fol- 
lowed by an arrow pointing to the left or right (go-signal). In the 
go-trials (75% of a total number of 160 trials), participants were 
instructed to react to the arrow as quickly and accurately as pos- 
sible by pressing either the left or the right button according to 
the previously shown arrow. Stop-trials (25% of a total number of 
160 trials) were designed as trials in which a go-signal was followed 
by an arrow pointing upwards (stop-signal). During the stop trials, 
participants were instructed to inhibit their response (yielding suc- 
cessful vs. unsuccessful inhibition). The delay between a go-signal 
and a stop-signal (stop-signal delay; SSD) started at 250 ms and was 
dynamically changed according to the participant’s performance 
using an adaptive algorithm. The SSD latency increased by 50 ms 
whenever the participant correctly inhibited the previous response 
(max. 900 ms), making it more difﬁcult to stop. In contrast, the SSD 
latency decreased by 50 ms whenever the previous stop-trial was 
incorrectly answered (min. 50 ms). Using this procedure, an approx- 
imately equal number of successful and unsuccessful stop-trials can 
be achieved (inhibitory control in the present sample was on aver- 
age 60.79% (SD = 12.68)). Moreover, we excluded participants with 
a negative stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Prior to scanning, all 
participants were given clear instructions. Total scanning time was 
6 min 37 s. 

2.3.  Emotion regulation 

2.5.  Functional mri data acquisition and preprocessing 

2.3.1.  Emotion regulation task 
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, participants performed an adapted 
and modiﬁed version of an emotion regulation task ( Hermann et al., 
2017 )  during  functional  MRI.  In  brief,  participants  were  asked 
to either watch aversive (‘Look negative ’) or neutral (‘Look 
neutral ’) 
pictures  from  the  International  Affective  Picture  System  (IAPS; 
Lang  et  al.,  1999 )  or  to  reappraise  negative  pictures  (‘Reap- 
praisal’). In the reappraisal condition, participants were asked to 
use the strategy of reappraisal to decrease the intensity of their 

Functional MRI data collection consisted of a localizer scan followed 
by a blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-sensitive T2 ∗-weighted 
echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence and structural T1-weighted se- 
quence using a 3T-scanner (PrismaFit; Siemens) with a standard 
32-channel head coil. For functional imaging, a total of 186 vol 
with 36 slices covering the whole brain (matrix 64 ×64, resolution 
3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 mm with 1 mm gap, repetition time = 2100 ms, 
echo time = 35 ms, ﬂip angle = 90 °) were acquired for each task. 
The slices were inclined 20 ° from the anterior/posterior commis-

sure level. The ﬁrst 11 vol of the emotion regulation task and the 
ﬁrst six volumes of the SST were discarded to allow longitudinal 
magnetization to reach equilibrium. 

2.6.  Functional MRI data analyses and statistical 
analyses 

Statistical parametric mapping version 12 (SPM12) implemented 
in MATLAB R2017b was used to analyze functional MRI data. Pre- 
processing included slice time correction of the volumes to the 
ﬁrst  slice,  realignment  to  correct  for  movement  artifacts,  co- 
registration of functional and anatomical data, spatial normaliza- 
tion to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and 
spatial smoothing with a Gaussian ﬁlter of 8 mm full-width at half 
maximum. Motion parameters were examined to ensure head move- 
ment did not exceed 3 mm. 

For the emotion regulation task, individual ﬁrst-level contrasts 
based on onsets and durations of each condition were convolved 
with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) in order 
to model the BOLD time course by using general linear models. Six 
motion parameters were included as regressors of no interest. For 
the group-level analysis, individual contrast images of the Reap- 
praisal > Look 
neutral condition were entered into a random-effects 
analysis to assess emotion regulation. 

Similarly, for the SST, individual ﬁrst-level contrasts for the on- 
sets of the four event types (correct go-trials, incorrect go-trials, 
successful inhibition, and unsuccessful inhibition) were modeled us- 
ing delta functions convolved with the canonical HRF. Again, six 
motion estimation parameters were included as regressors of no in- 
terest. Second-level random effects analyses were modeled for the 
contrast of interest, i.e. successful inhibition was determined by 
contrasting successful stop-trials with unsuccessful inhibition and 
correct go-trials [successful inhibition > (unsuccessful inhibition 
– correct go-trials)]. Whole-brain differences in activation for the 
contrasts of interest for both tasks were estimated using t-tests at 
a family-wise error (FWE) corrected p-value of 0.05. 

The IFG and the MFG were deﬁned as regions of interest (ROIs) 
based on previous studies reporting a strong involvement in emo- 
tion regulation and inhibitory control, and their potential relevance 
in coping under stress ( Berretz et al., 2021 ; Gavazzi et al., 2020 ; 
Golde et al., 2020 ; Rosenbaum et al., 2018 ). To extract predeﬁned 
ROIs, anatomical masks implemented in the Wake Forest Univer- 
sity (WFU) PickAtlas v2.4( Maldjian et al., 2003 ) were used, where 
a p < .05 FWE correction (minimum of 10 adjacent voxels) was 
applied. Mean contrast values of each participant were extracted 

from the FWE-corrected signiﬁcant clusters in the contrasts of in- 
terest ( Table 1 ) and exported to SPSS Statistics 25. The predictive 
power of IFG and MFG activity during affective and inhibitory con- 
trol for the impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health was 
investigated using linear regression models controlling for all co- 
variates (see below). Moreover, a conservative Bonferroni correc- 
tion was applied for the hemispheres, two regions of interest (MFG 
and IFG), and for affective and cognitive control ( α of 0.05 divided 
by 8 tests, resulting in α
adj = 0.0063). Additional sensitivity analyses 
were performed to control for the robustness of signiﬁcant effects. 

2.7.  Covariates 

Several important covariates were added to the main analyses, in- 
cluding gender, psychosocial adversity and obstetric risk at birth, 
current diagnoses of a mental disorder (assessed prior to the pan- 
demic), as well as current life events prior to and during the COVID- 
19 pandemic. 

2.7.1.  Psychosocial adversity 
Psychosocial adversity was assessed using a standardized parent in- 
terview according to an enriched family adversity index ( Rutter and 
Quinton, 1977 ) at the participants’ age of 3 months. The interview 
comprised 11 items covering characteristics of the family environ- 
ment, the parents, and the parents’ partnership (e.g., presence of 
parental psychiatric disorders, overcrowding in the home, ongoing 
parental conﬂicts, or unwanted pregnancy) during a period of one 
year prior to the assessment. A sum score of psychosocial adversi- 
ties was calculated by adding up the presence of all items. 

2.7.2.  Obstetric risk at birth 
Obstetric adversity was assessed using a standardized parent inter- 
view conducted at the participants’ age of 3 months. A sum score 
of obstetric risk factors was computed by adding up the presence 
of nine adverse conditions during pregnancy, delivery, and in the 
early postnatal phase, such as preterm birth or low birth weight 
( Laucht et al., 2000 ). 

2.7.3.  Life events 
Life events were recorded using a modiﬁed version of the Munich 
Events List (MEL) ( Maier-Diewald, 1983 ) within the online question- 
naire at all three time points. The MEL covers several areas of acute 
and chronic, positive and negative stressors, including marriage, 
delivery of a child, but also negative health outcomes, illness of a 
relative or job loss. We adjusted the items depending on the time

point, i.e., presence of life events between the regular assessment 
wave and prior to the COVID-19 crisis for the COVID-19 baseline 
assessment, and life events between baseline assessment and ﬁrst 
follow-up as well as between the ﬁrst and second follow-up for both 
COVID-19 follow-up assessments, respectively. 

2.8.  Sensitivity analyses 

Further sensitivity analyses were calculated to control for the ro- 
bustness of the predictive value of the neural activity, including 
parenthood,  household  income,  current  work  status,  workplace 
changes, and whether the participants were critical workers for the 
COVID-19 response as additional covariates. To control for a con- 
founding impact of a COVID-19 infection, participants were asked 
in a separate question whether they have been infected by the virus 
( n = 1). 

3.  Results 

3.1.  Descriptive data and changes of COVID-19 
impact 

Descriptive data are depicted in Table 2 . There were sig- 
niﬁcant differences for the reported physical and mental 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between the baseline as- 
sessment and the follow-up assessments ( F = 11.812, P < 
.001). Post-hoc analyses revealed no signiﬁcant differences 
between  the  baseline  assessment  and  the  ﬁrst  follow-up 
( P = .894), but signiﬁcant differences emerged between the 
baseline and the second follow-up ( T = - 4.306, P < .001), 
and between the ﬁrst and second follow-up ( T = −3.912, 
P < 0.001), suggesting a continuous burden on mental and 
physical health since the beginning of the COVID-19 out- 
break, with a further increased stress burden at the begin- 
ning of the second wave of the pandemic. 

3.2.  COVID-19-related stress burden at the 
baseline assessment 

Higher right IFG activity during the emotion regulation task 
was associated with a lower stress burden at the baseline as- 
sessment ( β = −.281, T = −3.023, P = .003, Fig. 1 a), after 
controlling for gender and psychosocial and obstetric risk 
factors at birth, current mental disorder prior to the COVID- 
19 pandemic, and current life events. In contrast, left IFG 
and bilateral MFG activity during emotion regulation were 
not related to stress burden at the beginning of the COVID- 
19  crisis  ( P  > 0.121).  In  addition,  inhibition-related  right 
MFG activity was negatively associated with the COVID-19 
burden at the baseline assessment ( β = −.215, T = −2.220, 
P = .029), although this was not signiﬁcant after correction 
for multiple testing. No signiﬁcant relationships emerged 
with regard to left MFG and IFG activity during inhibition.

the  COVID-19  impact  (all  Ps  >  0.61),  suggesting  that  af- 
fective control did not predict stress burden at this point 
of time. In contrast, lower right IFG and right MFG activ- 
ity during inhibitory control was associated with a higher 
COVID-19 stress burden at the ﬁrst follow-up assessment, 
even when controlling for the above-mentioned covariates 
(right  IFG:  β = −.348,  T = −3.638,  P < .001;  right  MFG:  β
= −.375, T = −3.884, P < .001, Fig. 1 b&c). Moreover, a neg- 
ative association for left MFG activity emerged, which did 
not survive correction for multiple comparisons after includ- 
ing the above-mentioned covariates ( β = −.250, T = −2.582, 
P = .011). Inhibition-related left IFG activity was not related 
to stress burden at the ﬁrst follow-up ( P = .093).

ates. In contrast, left IFG and MFG activity during emotion 
regulation were not related to stress burden during the sec- 
ond wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (all Ps > 0.086). Like- 
wise, inhibition-related activity was not related to COVID-19 
burden at the second follow-up (all Ps > 0.105). 

3.5.  Sensitivity analyses 

Separate  subsequent  sensitivity  analyses  were  calculated 
including additional control variables such as parenthood, 
income,  current  work  status,  critical  worker  status,  and 
workplace changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To con- 
trol for a confounding impact of a COVID-19 infection, we 
performed an additional sensitivity analysis after excluding 
one participant, who reported a COVID-19 infection. None 
of the sensitivity analyses changed the results ( Tables 3 and 
4 ). 

4.  Discussion 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to report 
a differential predictive value of emotion- and inhibition- 
related prefrontal control for stress burden at the beginning 
of and during the COVID-19 crisis, respectively ( Fig. 2 ). 

Speciﬁcally, we found a signiﬁcant negative relationship 
between  right  IFG  activity  during  emotion  regulation  as- 

sessed  prior  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  stress  bur- 
den approximately four weeks after the lockdown in Ger- 
many. In light of unforeseen ﬁrst-level threat entailing im- 
mediate  danger  to  health  and  emotional  challenges  due 
to the dramatic, unprecedented social contact restrictions 
at  the  beginning  of  the  crisis  with  high  levels  of  emo- 
tional arousal, fear and the imminent feeling of loneliness 
( Bauerle  et  al.,  2020 ;  Brooks  et  al.,  2020 ;  Dubey  et  al., 
2020 ; Odriozola-Gonzalez et al., 2020 ), affective coping was 
particularly needed ( Groarke et al., 2020 ; Restubog et al., 
2020 ; Weissman et al., 2021 ). Our results support this as- 
sumption, indicating that participants who are character- 
ized by higher affective control were able to cope better 
with these initial threats and uncertainties of an unprece- 
dented  stressor  like  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  At  the  ﬁrst 
follow-up assessment, which occurred during the summer, 
the ﬁrst-level threat decreased due to loosened restrictions 
and lower infection rates. Also, emotional habituation may 
occur if participants are confronted with the same stressor 
for a longer amount of time ( Grissom and Bhatnagar, 2009 ). 
These reasons both may contribute to a decreased neces- 
sity for affective coping. Notably, towards the second wave 
of the pandemic, when infection rates increased dramati- 
cally even above those during the ﬁrst wave and a second 
lockdown was imposed, affective coping was again required 
to face this immediate, even more intense, threat. 

In  contrast,  we  found  an  increased  need  for  cognitive 
control  strategies  when  facing  second-level  threat,  i.e. 
socioeconomic uncertainties. Speciﬁcally, higher cognitive

inhibition-related  activity  in  the  right  MFG  and  IFG  pre- 
dicted lower COVID-19 distress only at the ﬁrst follow-up 
(when restrictions had eased), but was unrelated to stress 
burden at the beginning of the ﬁrst wave (baseline) and the 
second wave (second follow-up). While there was an imme- 
diate threat at the beginning of both the ﬁrst and the sec- 
ond wave, the progression of the pandemic is characterized 
by ongoing socioeconomic challenges, uncertainties about 
one’s own future ﬁnancial and work capabilities, reduced 
working hours, and the length of the crisis ( Cutler and Sum- 
mers, 2020 ; Fegert et al., 2020 ). These sustained and sec- 
ondary challenges ( Pedrosa et al., 2020 ) require increased 
cognitive coping and ﬂexibility over time, thus explaining 
the negative association of the MFG and IFG activity with 
stress burden at the ﬁrst follow-up. 

Given  the  unique  prospective  design  of  our  study,  we 
were  able  to  demonstrate  the  strong  predictive  value  of 
neural activity for stress coping during the pandemic, ir- 
respective  of  the  presence  of  several  important  factors 
which have previously been reported to affect stress coping. 
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁndings were robust against control for the 
presence of other current stressful life events ( Undheim and 
Sund, 2017 ), socioeconomic disadvantages ( McEwen and Gi- 
anaros,  2010 ),  the  occurrence  of  early  life  psychosocial 
adversities  ( Quinlan  et  al.,  2017 ;  Shefﬂer  et  al.,  2019 ), 
or  the  presence  of  a  mental  disorder  before  the  crisis 

( Joormann and Gotlib, 2010 ), thus highlighting the superior 
role of neural self-regulation for coping under stress. 

Coping under stress has become a growing research ﬁeld 
of interest, and is speciﬁcally important for promoting re- 
silience ( Feder et al., 2019 ; Feder et al., 2009 ),Broadly de- 
ﬁned, resilience means staying healthy despite the exposure 
to stressful events, chronic adversities or traumatic expe- 
riences ( Fletcher and Sarkar, 2013 ; Vinkers et al., 2020 ). 
Important personal factors promoting resilience encompass 
an individual’s adaptive abilities, such as appropriate emo- 
tion regulation, inhibitory control, or cognitive ﬂexibility, 
but also include an individual’s social integration, a person’s 
genetic make-up, or the individual neurobiological constitu- 
tion ( Campbell-Sills et al., 2006 ; Feder et al., 2019 ). While a 
variety of studies investigated the beneﬁcial impact of ade- 
quate coping during stress and resilience either after a trau- 
matic event or in response to an artiﬁcially induced acute 
stressor ( Caston and Mauss, 2011 ; Cavanagh et al., 2014 ; 
Gloria and Steinhardt, 2016 ; Min et al., 2013 ; Roos et al., 
2017 ; Shapero et al., 2019 ), predictive assertions on future 
coping with a naturally occurring stressor are lacking. Our 
results provide ﬁrst hints that bridge this gap and provide 
important implications not only for affective and cognitive 
coping with potential further waves of increasing COVID-19 
cases, for instance due to virus mutations around the world, 
but  also  with  unprecedented  stressful  events  in  general. 
Speciﬁcally, we argue that there is a particular need for

distress requires adequate affective coping of the IFG at the beginning of the ﬁrst and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

prevention strategies which aim at improving the individ- 
ual’s affective and cognitive coping capacities in response 
to unforeseen events with a high stress load. As such, we 
suggest that stepped care neuromodulation might mitigate 
stress burden via gaining self-control over neural affective 
and cognitive regulation. Therefore, enhancing neuroplas- 
ticity  through  different  methods,  such  as  mindfulness  or 
even neurofeedback in emotion regulation areas might of- 
fer the potential to acquire and foster primary preventive 
self-regulation  skills  when  initially  encountering  stressful 
events, whereas learning self-control over cognitive regu- 
lation activity might rather serve as a secondary prevention 
tool during ongoing stressful events. In addition, ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA) might be a promising, afford- 
able tool to further foster affective and cognitive control 
strategies in response to real-time, real-life stressors on an 
individual’s own smartphone; this could be addressed by fu- 
ture intervention studies. 

Some limitations of our ﬁndings need to be addressed. 
Only  a  third  of  our  initial  sample  was  able  to  take  part 
in all COVID-19 assessments. Moreover, despite the quick 
start, we were unable to include the ﬁrst days of the lock- 
down, which might have exerted the greatest effects on 
perceived stress. However, since we were particularly inter- 
ested in coping with stress burden caused by the crisis, this 
time period appears to be appropriate to capture stress bur- 
den given that previous studies found no differences when 

comparing well-being, anxiety and depression in the initial 
phase of the pandemic to four weeks later ( Vindegaard and 
Benros, 2020 ). Finally, we concentrated on a more unspe- 
ciﬁc contrast of affective control, which not only captures 
brain activity related to emotion regulation, but also to neg- 
ative emotion processing. While this is not a standard ap- 
proach, the contrast applied here might be more reﬂective 
of the affective challenges provided by the COVID-19 pan- 
demic. 

In the framework of an ongoing longitudinal study follow- 
ing at-risk participants since birth, we thus provide ﬁrst ev- 
idence for the predictive value of neural underpinnings of 
emotion regulation during the ﬁrst and second lockdown and 
cognitive regulation during the COVID-19 pandemic between 
both waves. These ﬁndings may inform future prevention 
strategies seeking to foster stress coping in unforeseen sit- 
uations.
