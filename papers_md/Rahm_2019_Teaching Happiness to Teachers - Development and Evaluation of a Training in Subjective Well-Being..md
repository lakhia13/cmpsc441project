Teaching Happiness to Teachers -
Development and Evaluation of a
Training in Subjective Well-Being

Teachers’ health is a persistent challenge for educational systems all over the world.
Moreover, research results – especially in the domain of positive psychology – indicate
that high levels of well-being are associated with additional beneﬁts improving teachers’
professional performance. Therefore, a training to foster subjective well-being with one
training day, two booster sessions, and exercises before, during, and after the meetings
was developed. It consisted of about 10 h of face-to-face time and about 3 h for the
exercises in total over a 5-week training period. Main contents were conditions and
consequences of positive and negative emotions and well-being, emotion regulation,
time management, savoring and gratitude and the application of positive psychological
interventions (like Three Good Things). Analyses of planned contrasts by means of a
waiting control group design with three measurement points (pre, post, and follow-up)
showed a signiﬁcantly higher increase for the training group (n = 42) than for the control
group (n = 47) in the frequency of positive emotions, life satisfaction, and ﬂourishing
(interaction effects d = 0.44, d = 0.31, and d = 0.32) and a signiﬁcantly stronger
decrease in the frequency of negative emotions, perceived stress, and experiencing
emotional exhaustion (interaction effects d = 0.69, d = 0.51, and d = 0.47) from pre to
1-month follow-up. Training effects were also visible up to 5 months, although no control
group could be realized for this period due to the ﬁeld approach.

INTRODUCTION

The overall aim of our educational systems is to provide students with the best possible preparation
for their lives. Even if the question of the correct operationalization of this goal and the priorities
and methods to be chosen accordingly is answered diﬀerently in diﬀerent societies, one constant
remains: for the best possible education, those who deliver it must be able to make the best possible
use of their potential. For several decades, the scientiﬁc community has been researching the
conditions and consequences of the relatively high levels of stress, emotional exhaustion, burnout,
and health impairments among teachers (e.g., De Heus and Diekstra, 1999; Gray et al., 2017).
Diﬀerent aspects of the teaching profession are studied to explain these ﬁndings. Skaalvik and
Skaalvik (2018) summarize that “Teacher stress is typically conceptualized as unpleasant emotions
resulting from aspects of the work as a teacher” (p. 1251). Beside other stressors discussed (like
student diversity, discipline problems, conﬂicts with colleagues, lack of administrative support,
etc.), time pressure was found by Skaalvik and Skaalvik (2017) to have strong relations to emotional

exhaustion, which in turn is one of the main predictive factors to
develop burnout symptoms (Maslach et al., 1996).

It is clear that teachers with health problems are not able to
fully exploit the potential of their abilities, which has a negative
impact on their professional performance (e.g., instructional
performance; Klusmann et al., 2008) and also causes considerable
economical costs through medical-psychological treatment and
absenteeism. Improving teachers’ health therefore remains an
important goal. A new perspective on health is introduced by
positive psychology, which aims at promoting holistic well-being
and individual growth and at contributing to the unfolding
of one’s full potential. One of the central concepts of positive
psychology and the target construct of this study is subjective
well-being (SWB), which is regarded as the scientiﬁc concept
that comes closest to the general term “happiness” (Diener and
Scollon, 2014; for an overview of well-being terms see Diener
et al., 2018). SWB is composed of life satisfaction and the
frequency of positive and negative aﬀect (Diener, 1984; Pavot
and Diener, 2013). All three domains of SWB are independent
from each other and have distinctive associations with other
variables (Diener et al., 2017). Satisfaction with life (SWL) is the
cognitive component of SWB and encompasses “People’s explicit
and conscious evaluations of their lives, often based on factors
that the individual deems relevant” (Diener et al., 2018, p. 3).
People with high SWL therefore usually have a good balance
of what they desire and what they actually have in their lives –
especially in persistent domains like health, income or quality
of one’s work. The aﬀective component of SWB consists of the
frequency of positive aﬀect (PA) and negative aﬀect (NA). From
a neurobiological point of view, PA is strongly connected to
our reward system where it serves as a source of motivation
and supports learning processes (Esch, 2012). Following the
broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions by Fredrickson
(1998, 2013), the “experiences of positive emotions broaden
people’s momentary thought-action repertoires, which in turn
serves to build their enduring personal resources, ranging from
physical and intellectual resources to social and psychological
resources” (Fredrickson, 2001, p. 218). These additional resources
facilitate success, personal growth, and a “successful life” – which
in turn leads to more positive emotions and to a self-reinforcing
upward spiral. NA, on the other hand, occurs if needs and
relevant values and goals are threatened leading to a narrowing
of the thought-action repertoires toward ﬁght or ﬂight responses
(e.g., Garland et al., 2010) initiated through the release of stress
hormones (Costandi, 2015). NA is not negative per se as it yields
fast information on situations, helps to avoid threats to people’s
goals (e.g., Garland et al., 2010), but experiencing too much
negativity “leads to health problems in the long run” (Diener
et al., 2017, p. 2). In addition to these direct eﬀects of SWL,
PA, and NA, research also shows favorable outcomes of high
overall SWB. In an extensive meta-analysis, Lyubomirsky et al.
(2005) examined 225 empirical studies that tested the eﬀects
of SWB (or individual components thereof) on diﬀerent areas
of life. The ﬁndings show, among other things, that people
with a high level of well-being live longer (Danner et al., 2001;
Veenhoven, 2008), have a more eﬃcient immune system (Barak,
2006), are more eﬃcient and successful at work (Achor, 2010), are

more creative (Baas et al., 2008), and have more versatile social
relationships (Rodríguez-Pose and von Berlepsch, 2012). High
SWB is therefore not only highly relevant for people’s physical
and psychological health but also for their personal growth and
their performance in work and life.

Teachers’ Well-Being Matters
The internationally booming ﬁeld of positive education applies
ﬁndings from positive psychology to schools and, in addition to
academic achievements, focuses on the goal of promoting the
holistic well-being of everyone involved in school (e.g., Norrish,
2015; Larsen, 2016). The most important actors in achieving
school objectives are teachers (Hattie, 2003). If they are to
deliver education with high quality professional performance it
would be favorable to secure a good state of health and even
more a high level of SWB for them. While Lyubomirsky and
Lepper (1999) conclude that high SWB acts as a protective factor
against depression and burn-out, Sutton and Wheatley (2003)
emphasize in their review, that, for example, positive and negative
emotions of teachers signiﬁcantly inﬂuence student outcomes. Of
particular importance for the classroom is the eﬀect of “emotional
contagion,” the transfer of frequent positive emotions from
teachers to their students (Frenzel et al., 2009). The frequency
of positive emotions also corresponds to frequent use of eﬀective
teaching strategies (Moè et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, Kunter (2013)
was able to show that aﬀective well-being (here enthusiasm
for teaching) of mathematics teachers explains changes in
mathematical achievement and the students’ enjoyment of
mathematics. In addition, positive aﬀect is connected with
intrinsic motivation and the ideal
image of the “passionate
teacher,” who is particularly good at stimulating his or her
students and motivating them to develop their potential to
the greatest possible extent (Kunter and Holzberger, 2014).
More recently, Buonomo et al. (2019) found that experiencing
positive emotions toward students partially mediates the negative
inﬂuence of negative emotions toward students on teachers’ self-
eﬃcacy, which in turn is an important predictor for professional
performance of teachers and a protective factor against teachers’
ill-being (Zee and Koomen, 2016).

The ﬁndings thus provide clear evidence that SWB is linked
to many desirable outcomes that are also highly relevant for
the education system and the teaching profession. According to
general and teacher-speciﬁc ﬁndings, increasing SWB of teachers
should contribute to improving their quality of health and have a
positive impact on the teaching-learning processes in schools (see
also Gray et al., 2017).

Training of Well-Being
The question now arising is whether SWB can be improved.
In fact, at the end of the 1990s,
it was still assumed that
an individual set-point existed for SWB, to which it would
always return in the long term. Lykken and Tellegen (1996)
came to the conclusion that “it may be that trying to be
happier is as futile as trying to be taller” (p. 189). Recent
research has shown, however, that this assumption was not
true. In their remarkable review article, Luhmann and Intelisano
(2018) examine studies on hedonic adaptation and come to

the conclusion that “together, these studies indicate that SWB
is relatively stable but nonetheless changeable” (p. 13). In the
following, we describe diﬀerent psychological interventions or
programs aiming at the enhancement of PA and SWL – so called
positive psychological interventions (PPIs) – and at the reduction
of negative emotions.

Positive Psychological Interventions
With the introduction of positive psychology at the turn of the
milennium, more and more studies were carried out with the
explicit aim of achieving a sustainable increase in well-being.
For this purpose, PPIs (cf. Parks and Biswas-Diener, 2013) were
developed and evaluated in various settings. One of the ﬁrst
large randomized placebo-control trials on PPIs was conducted
by Seligman et al. (2005). Of the total of ﬁve PPIs used in this
study, the exercise Three Good Things stood out in particular
causing medium to large long-term eﬀects: participants were
asked to write down three things that went well each day and to
provide a causal explanation for each good thing. The PPI was
instructed completely online and should be performed for only
1 week. Participants were able to signiﬁcantly increase their well-
being and decrease their depressive symptoms in comparison
to the placebo control group, where participants had to write
about early memories every night for 1 week. The eﬀect remained
signiﬁcant at a 6-months follow-up and could be replicated
several times (Mongrain and Anselmo-Matthews, 2012; Gander
et al., 2013). Several meta-analyses (Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009;
Bolier et al., 2013) support the ﬁnding that SWB (or components
thereof) can be sustainably increased by PPIs. However, studies
on individual online interventions predominate so far – probably
because they are easier to implement and have the advantage of
wider dissemination.

Other publications address more complex intervention
programs with multiple exercises and background information
on conditions and consequences of well-being. A good example
is provided by Feicht et al. (2013), who evaluated a 7-week
“happiness training” conducted online. The main focus was on
informative video clips and texts, various PPIs (e.g., Three Good
Things and Gratitude Letter, see below), and reﬂection exercises
on personal behavior and experience. Questionnaire data show
large eﬀects, e.g., for diﬀerent measures of well-being and stress
reduction between training and waiting control group 4 weeks
after completion of training.

Presence-based trainings oﬀer the advantages of more direct
interchange and sharing reﬂections and might better reach
people who could beneﬁt
from a training but would not
participate in an online training. University seminars in positive
psychology represent a distinct group of presence-based complex
interventions, which are usually oﬀered weekly over the course
of one semester. In addition to teaching the theoretical contents
of positive psychology, part of the workload consists of getting
to know PPIs through self-application. Goodmon et al. (2016)
report signiﬁcant improvements in various dimensions of well-
being (including general happiness, SWL, perceived stress, and
depression) in a pre–post design. Participants of a parallel
seminar in social psychology served as a control group. Another
group of face-to-face multi-component interventions is positive

psychotherapy (Seligman et al., 2006). Positive psychotherapy is
mainly applied by psychotherapists in clinical settings, containing
elements of information and reﬂection in groups and PPIs as
homework between sessions. In a current study in a clinical
setting with predominantly depressive participants, Furchtlehner
et al. (2019), for example, found better results after 14 group
sessions of positive psychotherapy than after conventional
cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Basically, it can be assumed that PPIs or more complex
programs can improve well-being in the long term by changing
the participants’ individual experience and behavior. Hendricks
et al. (2019) conducted a meta-analysis of multi-component
PPIs and conclude that they have “a small eﬀect on SWB and
depression, and a small to moderate eﬀect on psychological well-
being” (p. 1). None of the 50 included studies, however, aimed at
the training of teachers. Although more and more programs for
positive education aiming at the fostering of students’ well-being
are being developed internationally (see Norrish, 2015; Larsen,
2016) and most of them contain teacher training in positive
psychology, the evaluation of trainings to improve teachers’ SWB
has so far been neglected. In addition, the aim of increasing
teachers’ well-being could be well-served by combining PPIs
(targeting PA and SWL) with interventions speciﬁcally aiming at
the reduction of NA.

Psychological Interventions on Stress and Negative
Emotions
As pointed out above, dealing with stress and NA is a
persistent challenge in teachers’ occupational life and a threat
to various dimensions of health. In the ﬁeld of emotion
regulation, processes to inﬂuence occurrence, experience, and
expression of emotions are studied. Gross (1998) summarizes ﬁve
points to regulate emotions: “(a) selection of the situation, (b)
modiﬁcation of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d)
change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses” (Gross,
1998, p. 271). Various intervention programs target diﬀerent
strategies to improve emotion regulation processes, leading to
various positive outcomes (for a review see for example Gratz
et al., 2015). Elaborated clinical emotion regulation programs
like the aﬀect regulation training (ART, Berking and Whitley,
2014) use for example psychoeducation, muscle relaxation,
breathing relaxation, non-judgmental perception of emotions,
acceptance and tolerance of emotions, compassionate self-
support, identiﬁcation of the causes of one’s emotional response
and active modiﬁcation of emotions. ART could show its
eﬀectiveness in various applications like for example in the
reduction of depressive symptoms (e.g., Berking et al., 2013).
A special aspect of stress reduction interventions are time
management trainings. As time pressure is one of the main
stressors leading to teachers’ experience of distress (Skaalvik
and Skaalvik, 2018), time management interventions are quite
often delivered in in-school trainings in Germany. Claessens
et al. (2007) reviewed 32 empirical studies and deﬁned time
management as “behaviors that aim at achieving an eﬀective use
of time while performing certain goal-directed activities” (p. 262).
Examples for such behaviors are setting goals, planning tasks,
prioritizing activities, striving for self-awareness of one’s time use,

knowing the limit of one’s capabilities etc. The authors concluded
that “time management behaviors relate positively to perceived
control of time, job satisfaction, and health, and negatively to
stress” (p. 255).

Aims of the Present Training
Altogether, research results show that high levels of SWB are
beneﬁcial in various areas of life and especially in the teaching
profession, and that SWL and the frequency of PA and NA
are improvable through (multi-component) PPIs and other
psychological interventions like trainings in emotion regulation
or time management.

The main aim of the present training therefore is to inﬂuence
the individual behavior and experience of the participants in such
a way that (1) positive emotions are experienced more frequently,
(2) negative emotions are experienced less frequently, and (3)
satisfaction with one’s own life is increased. The methods to
achieve these goals are positive psychoeducation (information),
exercises, and homework in the sense of cognitive-behavioral
therapy as well as reﬂections on experience and behavior in
everyday life and on the experiences gained during the exercises.
Another central concept in positive psychology is ﬂourishing,
which can be understood as a more comprehensive construct of
well-being describing a state of optimal social and psychological
functioning (e.g., Su et al., 2014). As PPIs generally target the
promotion of ﬂourishing, we also included this construct in the
development and evaluation of the training. Additionally, we
were interested whether we could also stimulate and ﬁnd changes
in self-eﬃcacy (Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995) and attributional
style (Weiner, 2000), which are both variables that could explain
the surprisingly high impact of the PPI Three Good Things (which
is a core PPI in the training, see below) on well-being.

In order to create an attractive oﬀer for school-internal and
cross-school further education, the training should require as
little eﬀort as possible for the participating teachers and be easy
to integrate into everyday school life.

Hypotheses
We postulate that the training described below contributes to the
improvement of diﬀerent components of SWB (SWL, PA, and
NA), to ﬂourishing, and to emotional exhaustion and perceived
stress (as additional measures of NA). In addition to the main
aim of increasing SWB, we assume that it might also improve
self-eﬃcacy beliefs and attributional styles. Both constructs are
not common target variables in (multi-component) PPIs, but as
the conception of the training also includes contents that might
evoke changes regarding these constructs, we enclosed them as
additional hypotheses.

Compared to the waiting control group, the training group

reports:

• a higher increase of the frequency of PA (H1),
• a higher increase of SWL (H2),
• a higher increase of ﬂourishing (H3),
• a stronger decrease of the frequency of NA (H4),
• a stronger decrease of emotional exhaustion (H5),
• a stronger decrease of perceived stress (H6).

We assume that all diﬀerences in changes occur immediately

after the training and at 1-month follow-up.

Additional hypotheses: the training group reports a higher
increase in general self-eﬃcacy (AH1) and internal locus of
control (AH2) and a higher decrease in external locus of
control (AH3) than the waiting control group directly and
1 month after the training.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Schedule of the Training
One elementary component of teacher trainings in Germany
are 1-day internal school training courses, which are generally
held annually at most schools. As changes in behavior and
experience are diﬃcult to achieve through 1-day interventions,
the common 1-day format was upgraded by some elements that
increase the probability of sustainable changes and can be more
easily integrated into teachers’ professional and private lives than
additional full-day events.

Thus, a 5-week training phase with an entire training day and
two 2-h booster sessions as well as small homework tasks before,
during and after the training was designed (see Figure 1). The
contents and exercises mentioned here are explained in more
detail in the following two sections.

The training began with an e-mail-instructed Emotion
Diary 1 week before the ﬁrst meeting. Participants were
requested to rate how intensely they experienced 20 given
emotions and to note one situation with negative and one
with positive emotions every evening. On the following 6-
h training day, the experiences with the Emotion Diary were
reﬂected upon and a large part of the contents (described
in the following sections) was delivered. In the following
2 weeks,

In the ﬁrst 2-h booster session, participants’ experiences were
reﬂected upon and the most important contents were reviewed.
Additionally, mindfulness,
and gratitude were
introduced as further topics. The participants wrote a Gratitude
Letter and thought about a personal Savoring Experience. The
task for the next 2 weeks was to carry out a Happiness Day where
participants choose to either make a Gratitude Visit or let the
planned Savoring Experience become reality.

savoring,

In the second and ﬁnal booster session, the experiences with
the Happiness Day were reﬂected upon and important contents
from the previous sessions were repeated. The main objective
of the last session was to ensure sustainability of the training
eﬀects. The participants ﬁrst wrote a letter to themselves, which
was to be opened a month later, reminding them of subjectively
important topics, experiences, and intentions. The participants
then worked out their personal happiness project with concrete
plans for the near future.

An essential message within all sessions was the aﬃrmation
that everyone had much more internal control over their SWB
than he or she was usually aware of. The total attendance time of
the training was approximately 10 h, about 3 h had to be spent

Positive Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation in psychotherapy is to be understood as
[. . . ]
“systematic didactic-psychotherapeutic
which are suitable to inform patients and their relatives about the
disorder and its treatment, to promote the understanding and
the self-responsible handling of the disorder and to support them
in coping with the disease” (Bäuml and Pitschel-Walz, 2003,
p. 3, own translation). Accordingly, through psychoeducation
in positive psychology, participants are to become experts for
the conditions under which well-being evolves. By means of
interactive information transfer they learn to purposefully
inﬂuence the frequency and intensity of both positive and
negative emotions, life satisfaction, stress perception, personal
growth, and ﬂourishing. This type of positive psychoeducation
was implemented in the training in form of short lectures
(20–40 min) on speciﬁc topic units, followed by a reﬂection
break (see below).

Guided Reﬂection
Reﬂection breaks were used to anchor the contents taught and
experienced. After every unit, participants had time to reﬂect
on subjectively signiﬁcant information and insights. The task in
the reﬂection breaks was (1) to review the information received,
(2) to write down one to three sentences of personal relevance,
and (3) to exchange ideas and thoughts about the topic with
one or two other participants. Finally, issues of interest were
collected in the plenary session and questions clariﬁed. Reﬂection
stimulating exercises were carried out at several phases during
the training. For example, participants should think about what
activities reliably generate positive emotions for them, what they
would like to do, if time and money did not matter, or in which
situations less perfectionism would be desirable. In addition

to anchoring the content, the aim was to question current
habits and thereby encourage participants to engage in changes
in attitudes and behavior. In both booster sessions, suﬃcient
time was given to reﬂect on the experiences with homework in
order to provide support in case of diﬃculties or to reinforce
successes through feedback and encouragement from the peer-
group and the trainer.

Homework
Exercise is an important mechanism to consolidate changes in
behavior and experience. In his extensive second-order meta-
analysis, Hattie (2008) reports an overall eﬀect size of only
d = 0.29 for homework on learning success for students, but
points out that eﬀects are higher if learners are older and
more self-regulated and if the homework is about practicing
or repeating of learned contents. Also homework takes place
in addition to learning eﬀects in sessions and therefore can
be considered an important enrichment. Homework also plays
therapy (CBT) and
a decisive role in cognitive behavioral
trainings based on it.

Contents of the Training
The training starts with a focus on the concept of SWB
as a scientiﬁc construct for the everyday term “happiness”
(Diener and Scollon, 2014). Beneﬁts of positive and negative
emotions and life satisfaction are explained from evolutionary,
neurobiological,
and psychological perspectives. Favorable
conditions for creating SWB are explained on the basis of the
three basic psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and
relatedness) of self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2000).
Information on the consequences of high SWB (see above) is
used in particular to create personal relevance and motivation
for the participants.

successful, pleasant, and meaningful
life. By performing the

positive emotions more consciously, more frequently, and more
intensely, thereby setting these upward spirals in motion.

To address the aim of decreasing the frequency of NA,
neurobiological, psychological, and physiological conditions and
consequences of NA are explained and strategies to regulate
NA and stress (like change of cognitions, consciously distracting
oneself, active coping and acceptance) are discussed (cf. Gross,
1998). Participants learn about the functions of NA and are
thereby empowered to distinguish better between helpful and
unhelpful NA. The most important learning objective in this
regard is to realize that the frequency of occurrence of unhelpful
emotions and even more their persistence is changeable.

Additionally,

to reduce stress from time pressure,

time
management techniques are taught and tried out. In particular,
the focus here is on setting priorities that promote well-
being when choosing and designing tasks, saying “no” to
additional assignments, and questioning perfectionist demands.
It is emphasized that one has more inﬂuence on the selection
and order of activities than one is aware of (cf. Claessens et al.,
2007). Participants are encouraged to prioritize their own well-
being (Catalino et al., 2014) and to invest the time gained through
time and priority management in activities that promote SWB
(for an overview on the interconnection between SWB and time
see Mogilner et al., 2018).

Participants are made aware of how SWL develops and that
one can deliberately change the personal perspectives of what
deems relevant in life (Diener et al., 2018). Also, individual
processes of social comparison are addressed. It is explained how
these processes sometimes undermine a fair assessment of one’s
successes and standing in life. Participants are encouraged to
think about what might increase their SWL.

the
In regard to perception processes and their biases,
negativity bias – prominent in positive psychology – receives
special attention.
It describes the tendency that negative,
potentially threatening stimuli have a greater eﬀect on our
experience and behavior than positive stimuli (Baumeister
et al., 2001; Rozin and Royzman, 2001). This distortion toward
an increased attention to negative environmental stimuli
is
explained to the participants. It is made clear that with conscious
attention control, we can inﬂuence how many positive things we
perceive in our environment (the perception of positive things is
particularly practiced with the PPI Three Good Things).

For changes in individual evaluation processes, the training
also addresses the topic of causal attribution (Weiner, 2000).
People seek causal explanations for their action results. Those
who ascribe their success to internal and stable causes promote
their self-esteem and brighten their basic mood. The training
emphasizes that the individual can gain control over evaluation
is possible to improve one’s own
processes and that
attributional style.

(2013) point out, not all
interventions have the same eﬀect on all people. Their person-
activity-ﬁt model stresses the importance of a ﬁt between

interventions and individuals. Also Schueller’s (2014) review
indicates that ﬁtting activities achieve better eﬀects and are more
likely to be maintained. The training takes this into account by
selecting and designing exercises that leave as much room as
possible for their execution. Additionally, we tried to keep the
required eﬀort for them as low as possible.

Emotion Diary
The Emotion Diary is a proprietary translation and adaptation
of the modiﬁed Diﬀerential Emotion Scale (mDES) used by
Fredrickson (2011) in her broaden-and-build theory studies.
Participants were asked to rate the intensity of 10 positive and 10
negative emotions. In addition, each day they were asked to write
down one situation that led to positive emotions and one that led
to negative emotions. The Emotion Diary should be ﬁlled out in
the week before the training day and was instructed by e-mail.
The aim of the intervention was to activate the participants
before the ﬁrst meeting and to make them perceive the variability
of their own emotions. The exercise took about 5 min per
day to complete. The collected situations could be worked on
during the training.

Three Good Things
In the PPI Three Good Things, each evening, the participants were
asked to write down three good experiences of the day which had
provided positive emotions and to indicate what they themselves
had contributed to these experiences. The ﬁrst part of the exercise
aims to increase awareness of positive experiences and thus to
improve the frequency of positive emotions. The second part
deliberately deviates from the more general original instruction
of Seligman et al. (2005) in order to explicitly train a favorable
attributional style by ascribing positive experiences to internal
causes. Seligman et al. (2005), as well as the replication studies by
Mongrain and Anselmo-Matthews (2012) or Gander et al. (2013),
were able to show signiﬁcant improvements in well-being, which
built up over a period of 3 months and were still measurable after
6 months. Participants were encouraged to complete the exercise
for at least a few days. The exercise booklet contained pages
for 14-day practice. Since Gander et al. (2013) found that a 2-
week exercise application did not bring any beneﬁt for well-being,
participants were informed accordingly and oﬀered possibilities
for the variation of the exercise (e.g., to focus on certain domains
like work or hobby or to write down three funny things or the
like) in order to prevent boredom eﬀects. Also it was emphasized
that they should stop after some days if it felt more like a
burdensome duty than an enrichment. This exercise took about
5 min per day to complete.

Letter of Gratitude
The Letter of Gratitude is another PPI from the studies mentioned
above. In the ﬁrst booster session, participants were asked to write
a letter in which they explicitly thanked an important person in
their life. One way to increase the positive eﬀect of the exercise
(Seligman et al., 2005) is to read the letter to the addressee
personally (Gratitude Visit), which could be chosen as one option
for the individual design of the Happiness Day (see below).

Teaching Happiness to Teachers

Savoring Experience
Bryant et al. (2011) assume that “savoring” makes a decisive
contribution to experiencing and intensifying positive emotions.
In the ﬁrst booster session, the participants were encouraged to
imagine being given 2 h of time, which could only be invested in
a Savoring Experience. One of the ideas was to be planned in detail
and was the second option for the Happiness Day activity.

distinguishes between two subscales, each consisting of six
items. Each subscale comprises three more general feelings (e.g.,
“pleasant” or “unpleasant”) and three more speciﬁc feelings
(e.g., “joyful” or “sad”). Participants are asked how often they
experienced the given emotion in the past 4 weeks and answer
on a ﬁve-point scale from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5 (very
often or always).

Happiness Day
The given framework of this mostly self-designable PPI consisted
of planning and carrying out an activity of about 2 h that would
most likely evoke positive emotions. Therefore, participants
could choose between the two PPIs mentioned above. The option
of carrying out a Gratitude Visit was very rarely chosen in
all groups (in total only about 5 of the participants opted for
it). The opportunity to indulge in a Savoring Experience on
the other hand, met with great enthusiasm. Examples of the
activities carried out included a visit to the sauna, a campﬁre or
musical experiences.

Methods to Increase Sustainability
Various elements were integrated into the training to ensure
greater sustainability. One measure was to extend the training
time by instructing a ﬁrst exercise (Emotion Diary) by e-mail
already 1 week before the meeting. Also,
the participants
were encouraged to form so-called implementation intentions
(Gollwitzer, 1999) in order to increase the probability that the
“homework” to be done during the training (Emotion Diary,
Three Good Things, and Happiness Day) would actually be
carried out. These implementation intentions have the form
of an “if, then” sentence and have already been successfully
applied in many contexts. In the second booster session,
the participants had the opportunity to record important
information and insights from the training and to formulate
good wishes for their future selves in a letter to themselves.
The letter should be opened on a ﬁxed date approximately
1 month after the training. The ﬁnal exercise of the training
was to design a personal happiness project for the future and
to specify behavior,
life mottos, and further implementation
intentions, so that concrete action plans would be available
after the training.

Measures
In this study, we assessed the frequency of positive and negative
emotions (SPANE), general life satisfaction (SWLS), ﬂourishing
(BIT), emotional exhaustion (MBI-EE), perceived stress (PSS),
general self-eﬃcacy (GSE), and locus of control (IE-4) as well
as demographic data (year of birth and gender), and a code
for anonymous assignment with an online-questionnaire. In
addition, participants answered 10 self-constructed items on their
subjective training success.

Frequency of Positive and Negative Experiences
The frequency of positive and negative emotions is part of
the target construct of SWB and is assessed with the Scale of
Positive And Negative Experiences (SPANE; Original: Diener
et al., 2010; German version: Rahm et al., 2017). The instrument

General Life Satisfaction
The general life satisfaction represents the cognitive component
of SWB and is measured using the Satisfaction With Life Scale
(SWLS; Original: Diener et al., 1985; German version: Glaesmer
et al., 2011). The instrument consists of ﬁve items on a seven-
point response scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree). Example items are: “In most ways, my life is close to
my ideal” or “If I could live my life over, I would change
almost nothing.”

Flourishing
The construct of ﬂourishing (or thriving) is considered to
be a more comprehensive measurement of multidimensional
well-being. The Brief Inventory of Thriving (BIT; Original:
Su et al., 2014; German version: Hausler et al., 2017) used
here is the unidimensional short version of the Comprehensive
Inventory of Thriving (ibid.) and contains a total of 10 items
on meaning, optimism, emotional state, ﬂow, goal achievement,
energy experience, and sense of belonging, which are evaluated
on a ﬁve-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree). Example items are: “What I do in life is valuable
and worthwhile” or “In most activities I do, I feel energized.”

Emotional Exhaustion
The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI; Original: Maslach et al.,
1996; German version: Büssing and Perrar, 1992) measures
the burnout syndrome on three subscales. In this study, we
only used the subscale Emotional Exhaustion (MBI-EE), as the
corresponding construct is considered to be the main symptom
of burnout. Using ﬁve items (e.g., “I feel burned out from my
work” or “Working all day is really a strain for me”), participants
estimate the frequency of the experienced feeling on a seven-
point scale from 0 (never) to 6 (every day).

Perceived Stress
The perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale
(PSS; Original: Cohen et al., 1983; German version: Klein et al.,
2016). The instrument comprises 10 items on a ﬁve-point scale
from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). Example items are: “In the last
month, how often have you been upset because of something that
happened unexpectedly?” or “In the last month, how often have
you felt that you were unable to control the important things in
your life?”

General Self-Efﬁcacy
The general self-eﬃcacy describes the conﬁdence in mastering
diﬃcult situations and is measured by the General Self-Eﬃcacy
Scale (GSE; Original: Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1999; English
version: Schwarzer and Jerusalem, 1995). The scale contains 10
items that are to be rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale from 1 (not at

all true) to 4 (exactly true). Example items are: “I can remain calm
when facing diﬃculties because I can rely on my coping abilities”
or “I can usually handle whatever comes my way.”

Internal–External Locus of Control
Control beliefs were recorded using the German scale Internale-
Externale-Kontrollüberzeugungen-4 (IE-4; Original: Kovaleva
et al., 2014; English version: Kovaleva, 2012). The scale comprises
two subscales, one for the internal locus of control and one for
the external locus of control, each consisting of two items. All
four items are rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale from 1 (doesn’t
apply at all) to 5 (applies completely). Example items are: “If I
work hard, I will succeed” (internal) or “Fate often gets in the way
of my plans” (external).

Subjective Training Success
For the assessment of
the subjective training success we
constructed 10 additional items which should be answered on a
seven-point Likert scale from 1 (not applicable at all) to 7 (very
applicable). Example items are: “I beneﬁted from the training” or
“I can perceive good things in my environment better than before
the training.”

Sample
The training was oﬀered in three institutions. In two German
schools, a grammar school (Gymnasium) and a vocational
school, participants were recruited via short presentations held
at the teachers’ council that brieﬂy described aims, contents, and
schedule of the training. Interested teachers could voluntarily
participate in the training in their working hours. As the third
institution, the institute of educational psychology oﬀered the
training to staﬀ of the Technische Universität Braunschweig
(recruited via the department of vocational training) and to
public (recruited via a newsletter for people interested in
positive psychology).

For each of the three institutions (grammar school, vocational
school, and university) the training was delivered twice. The
participants of the ﬁrst training round acted as the training group.
The second training round was necessary in order to set up a
waiting control group with similarly interested participants –
eﬀects of the second training were therefore not included in the
data analyses. Participants were assigned to the groups by taking
individual time restrictions into account to realize a suﬃciently
large sample. Table 1 shows the distribution of the N = 89
participants among the groups and institutions. The participants
were between 24 and 67 years old (M = 46.2; SD = 11.4),
74.2% were female.

Procedure
The training was delivered twice in each institution by the ﬁrst
author. Figure 2 shows the sequence of the measurement points
in accordance to the training periods for each institution. All
participants (training and control group) from one institution
(grammar school, vocational school, or university) answered the
questionnaires at the same time, while the exact training dates
and measurement points diﬀered between the institutions. The
ﬁrst training period for the grammar school started in April, for
the vocational school in Mid-August and for the university at the
end of August, all in 2017.

At measurement time point 1 (t1: pre), all participants from
the respective institution received an e-mail asking them to
participate in an online survey. For the participants of the
training group of this institution, this e-mail also contained the
instruction for the ﬁrst exercise (Emotion Diary). One week after
t1, the training group of this institution had their training day,
2 weeks later booster session 1, and another 2 weeks later booster
session 2. One day after the last booster session, all participants
(training and control group) from this institution received an
e-mail asking them to take the second online survey at t2 (post).
The waiting control group had to be trained in the same school
year. Due to organizational reasons, the second round of the
training period (for the waiting control groups) had to start
at diﬀerent times in the diﬀerent institutions. Therefore, the
follow-up measurement t3 took place with diﬀerent time intervals
(29 days for the vocational school, 36 for the university course and
70 for the grammar school) after t2.

To investigate long term eﬀects, participants were asked to
complete two more questionnaires. The second follow-up (t4)
took place 9 weeks (vocational school) to 15 weeks (grammar
school) after the end of training, the third follow-up (t5) took
place 19 to 25 weeks after the end of training. As the waiting
control group had already received the training at t4 and t5, the
analyses of long term eﬀects could only be conducted without
a control group.

For each measurement point, depending on the response rate,
one or two reminder e-mail(s) were sent a few days after the
ﬁrst request. The online-surveys were created with the software
Questback and answered anonymously within 1 week after the
according request per e-mail. All participants were informed
in detail about the voluntary nature of their participation,
the measures taken to maintain anonymity, and the purpose
of
for
the study and gave their written informed consent
further data processing. The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Faculty of Life Sciences, Technische Universität
Braunschweig (FV-2019-07).

Data Analysis
First, a t-test was used to check whether training and control
group diﬀered in their initial values. The changes from t1 to
the other measurement points within the groups were tested
with t-tests for dependent samples. Cohen’s d was calculated
as an eﬀect measure using the standard deviation of the mean
diﬀerences in accordance to Field (2014). The diﬀerences in
changes between groups were tested by planned contrasts. For

each of the scales used, the respective mean diﬀerences between
the measurement points (post: t2 minus t1; follow-up: t3 minus
t1) were compared between training and control group using
t-tests. Cohen’s d was calculated using the pooled standard
deviation at t1 and the bias correction suggested by Morris
(2008). In case of speciﬁc hypotheses, planned contrasts provide
stronger statistical power than ANOVA (Furr, 2008). Power
analyses indicate that with the given sample size and α = 0.05,
eﬀect sizes of d ≥ 0.50 could be detected with 1 – β = 0.80.

To compare the same participants at all measurement points,
only cases with complete data at t1, t2, and t3 were included in the
analyses. Initially 106 participants answered the survey at t1. 17
participants (9 from the training and 8 from the control group)
did not take part in t2 or t3 and were therefore excluded from
analyses, leading to a total sample of N = 89 participants. A t-
test of mean diﬀerences between the N = 89 included and the
n = 17 excluded participants showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
on ﬁve of the six target variables – only the SWLS indicated a
signiﬁcantly higher mean for the included cases. As Questback
enforced complete answers to the questionnaires, there are no
missing values in single items of the questionnaires.

To test long-term eﬀects, changes from t1 to t4 and from t1
to t5 in the training group (n = 42) were tested for signiﬁcance
using t-tests. As some of the participants did not take part in
these measurement points, these analyses had to be carried out
with reduced sample sizes (t4: n = 30; t5: n = 35). Again Cohens
d was calculated. (The results of these analyses, however, are to
be interpreted cautiously as a control group could not be realized
here.) All calculations were carried out with SPSS 25.

RESULTS

Table 2 shows the mean values, standard deviations, and internal
consistencies of the measures used at t1 for all participants.
With the exception of the subscale for external locus of control
(α = 0.58), all scales achieved at least good values of internal
consistencies (α > 0.80). The initial values (t1) did not show

signiﬁcant mean diﬀerences between the training and the control
group on any scale.

Table 3 shows the results of the t-tests for mean diﬀerences
between the measurement points t1 (pre) and t2 (post) within-
groups. With the exception of the variables general self-eﬃcacy
locus of control, all variables in
and internal and external
the training group (n = 42)
improved signiﬁcantly from
t1 to t2. The waiting control group (n = 47) showed no
signiﬁcant changes from t1 to t2, except for the decrease of
the frequency of positive emotions. Analyses of the interaction
contrasts are shown in Table 4. The between-group eﬀects
show a signiﬁcantly higher increase in frequency of positive
emotions (H1), life satisfaction (H2), and ﬂourishing (H3) in
the training group than in the control group (interaction
eﬀects d = 0.65, d = 0.40, and d = 0.43) and a signiﬁcantly
stronger decrease in frequency of negative emotions
(H4),
emotional exhaustion (H5), and perceived stress (H6) with
interaction eﬀects of d = 0.53, d = 0.42, and d = 0.49. Self-
eﬃcacy and internal and external
locus of control were not
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced.

Table 5 shows the results of the t-tests for mean diﬀerences
between the measurement points t1 (pre) and t3 (follow-up1)
within groups. With the exception of the variable external locus
of control, all variables in the training group (n = 42) improved
signiﬁcantly from t1 to t3. In the waiting control group (n = 47),
we found a signiﬁcant improvement in general self-eﬃcacy.
Analyses of the interaction contrasts are shown in Table 6.
The between-group diﬀerences of within-group changes show
a signiﬁcantly higher increase in frequency of positive emotions
(H1), life satisfaction (H2), and ﬂourishing (H3) in the training
group than in the control group (interaction eﬀects d = 0.44,
d = 0.31, and d = 0.32) and a signiﬁcantly stronger decrease in
frequency of negative emotions (H4), emotional exhaustion (H5),
and perceived stress (H6) with interaction eﬀects of d = 0.69,
d = 0.47, and d = 0.51). Additional to the results at t2, an
interaction eﬀect on internal locus of control could be found
(d = 0.38). External locus of control and general self-eﬃcacy were
not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced.

In summary, all main hypotheses (H1 to H6) were conﬁrmed,
the additional hypotheses only for internal locus of control and
only at t3 (AH2).

Outside the waiting control group design, two additional
measurement points were implemented for the training group
round 1. The ﬁrst was about 3 months (t4: 9–15 weeks)
after the training and the second about 5 months (t5: 19–
25 weeks). As can be seen in Table 7, most
instruments
also revealed a signiﬁcant improvement compared to t1. The

improvements in the frequency of positive and negative emotions
were not signiﬁcant at t5. It is important to emphasize that
no comparative data from control groups are available for this
period, as the waiting control group had already received the
training at this time.

In addition to the psychological constructs mentioned,
participants were asked to report their subjective training success.

standard deviations at t5. In particular, the participants reported a

At each measurement point, the training participants also had
the opportunity to leave anonymous comments on particular
strengths and improvement ideas, which was frequently used.
The positive comments often related to gratitude for the training

and for the impulses for personal life improvement or referred to
concrete personal successes attributed to the training. A number
of participants also expressed that some or most of the contents
had already been known before, but that it was good to be assured
of “doing it right.” Suggestions for improvement were, among
other things, often related to individual exercises (e.g., the Letter
of Gratitude was viewed critically) or the timing (more time for or
between booster sessions). Quite often the wish for an additional

booster session after about half a year was expressed. All in all,
the open statements showed a positive picture and a high level of
satisfaction with the training.

DISCUSSION

In general, it could be shown that the developed training was
able to meet the goal of promoting SWB. Immediately after the
training (t2: post), the participants in the training group showed
signiﬁcantly stronger increases in frequency of positive emotions,
life satisfaction, and ﬂourishing than the participants in the
control group and a signiﬁcantly stronger decrease in frequency
of negative emotions, emotional exhaustion, and perceived stress,
accordingly. The eﬀects persisted about 1 month (t3: follow-up
1) after the end of the training. Thus, all main hypotheses could
be conﬁrmed. Therefore, the present study adds another eﬀective
multi-component intervention to the ﬁeld of positive psychology.
However, because of the methodological limitations (see below),
further studies should be carried out to validate the results.

Up to date, there are three meta-analyses on the eﬀectiveness
on (multi-component) PPIs (Sin and Lyubomirsky, 2009; Bolier
et al., 2013; Hendricks et al., 2019), revealing small to medium
eﬀect sizes for the enhancement of well-being and the reduction
of depressive symptoms. Results of the recent study are therefore
in line with other ﬁndings. In these meta-analyses, diﬀerent
measures for well-being were used. It is worth mentioning that
the present study seems to be one of few taking the measurement
of NA into account which seems surprising, as the construction
of SWB with its three composites (SWL, PA, and NA) is quite
common (Diener, 1984; Pavot and Diener, 2013) and most of the
studies included in these meta-analyses claim to increase SWB.
We deem it remarkable that we found the strongest eﬀects at t3
in the reduction of the frequency of negative emotions, although
this was not trained directly in the exercises between the training

day and the booster sessions. The inﬂuence on this variable thus
seems to be achieved mainly through positive psychoeducation
and general reﬂections or as side eﬀects of the PPIs. Therefore,
we recommend including the measurement of NA in future
intervention studies (see below).

A main learning objective of the present training in total and
especially of the PPI Three Good Things was to strengthen the
belief of the participants to have more inﬂuence on their SWB
than they are usually aware of and to motivate them to make use
of this inﬂuence by changing behavior. Therefore, our additional
hypotheses expected increases in general self-eﬃcacy (AH1) and
internal locus of control (AH2) and decreases in external locus
of control (AH3). This was only partly conﬁrmed by a signiﬁcant
increase in internal locus of control and only between t1 and t3
(AH2). In regard of general self-eﬃcacy, it seems plausible that
the training has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on this broad assessment
of beliefs about mastery or problem-solving expectations and
more speciﬁc self-eﬃcacy constructs should be considered (see
below). For locus of control it might also be possible that the
short scales used in the present study with only two items for
each subscale were not suitable to capture all relevant aspects
of the constructs. Additionally, the subscale for external locus of
control only revealed a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.58. Therefore, we
recommend using a more comprehensive scale in future studies.
time of measurement (t1: pre),
signiﬁcant improvements for the training groups were also
observed after approximately two and a half (t4: follow-up 2)
and approximately 5 months (t5: follow-up 3) respectively –
however, due to the lack of a control group, these results
could also be attributed to other circumstances so that they can
only be interpreted cautiously as a ﬁrst indication of long-term
eﬀects. The frequency of positive and negative emotions did not
signiﬁcantly change from t1 to the follow-up after approximately
5 months (t5). Since there was no control group at t5, it cannot
be tested whether the training possibly prevented a decline in
emotions caused by external inﬂuences such as more stressful
phases at school or if this result is due to hedonic adaptation
processes or due to the small sample size.

Compared to the ﬁrst

In addition to its overall eﬀectiveness, the training has the
advantage of a manageable amount of time, which could facilitate
(active) participation: the personal contact time was only 10 h
in total, divided into one training day and two booster sessions,
and the self-structured exercises lasted only about 3 h in total
over a period of 5 weeks. The feedback received during the
training, the results of the subjectively assessed eﬀects of the
training, and the open comments showed that the oﬀer was
well-received by the target group. The integration of coping
strategies for aversive emotions and time management techniques
probably also contributed to this. Both contents are known to
be important skills for work performance and health of teachers
(Skaalvik and Skaalvik, 2018) but have rarely been considered in
multi-component interventions claiming to increase SWB.

Limitations and Further Research
Due to the ﬁeld research approach, this study has two obvious
limitations: (1) For organizational reasons in the schools, the
follow-up measurement could not be carried out in all three

groups after exactly 30 days so that there was a notable diﬀerence
in the amount of time between the end of the training and
the ﬁrst follow-up measurement (t3) for the three institutions,
with the grammar school being assessed more than 1 month
later (70 days in comparison to 29 and 36 days). (2) The ﬁrst
two training groups consisted of teachers from one school each,
while the third group also included some teachers from diﬀerent
schools but mostly members of other professions. In our opinion,
however, the fact that the training has proven eﬀective even
under these suboptimal conditions indicates the robustness of
the eﬀects. Nevertheless, in subsequent studies these restrictions
should be avoided.

As mentioned above, 17 participants who did not

take
part in all three measurement points were excluded from the
analyses. These excluded cases revealed a signiﬁcantly lower
life satisfaction at t1. Therefore, it seems that less contented
people might also be less motivated to complete the follow-up
questionnaires. To avoid biases in this regard, one could consider
working with incentives in future studies.

Another issue are the shortcomings of the evaluation design.
As Hendricks et al. (2019) found an eﬀect of the study quality
in their meta-analysis (expressed, e.g., in randomization and
placebo-control) showing lower eﬀects in high-quality studies, it
may be that the eﬀects of the present study are overestimated.
In a larger project with more resources for recruiting schools
and teachers, it should be possible to secure a larger sample size
which would be especially favorable for two diﬀerent approaches:
(1) A cross-school training with randomized assignment of
the participants to the groups including an active alternative-
treatment-control group would avoid biases concerning the
selection procedure (which was based on available time of the
participants in this study) and could ensure that changes are
due to the training and not due to social interaction or other
confounded variables. Additionally, as more research about the
precise mechanisms of PPIs and multi-component interventions
is still needed (Mongrain and Anselmo-Matthews, 2012; Chow,
2018),
it would be even more valuable to also carry out a
component evaluation to check which individual components
are responsible for the eﬀects. Therefore, one could develop
several independent training modules (e.g., positive emotions,
emotion regulation, or time management) and apply them in
diﬀerent order to several groups to ﬁnd out which modules aﬀect
which facets of well-being. (2) In-school trainings with several
participating schools would allow to investigate the inﬂuence
of school-speciﬁc variables such as openness to change, peer
support, experience of stress, or general school climate on the
sustainability of training successes using multi-level analyses.
For example, Ebersold et al. (2019) were able to show that
teachers’ well-being was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the perceived
autonomy support by their principals, mediated by satisfaction
of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence,
and relatedness (Deci and Ryan, 2000). It can be assumed
that eﬀects of well-being interventions will
last longer in a
supportive environment.

levels (Fredrickson, 2013), one can hope that the present training
will also contribute to build such enduring resources not targeted
directly. This, of course, needs to be examined in additional
studies preferably with long-term follow-ups 6 or more months
after intervention. Regarding the inclusion of interventions to
decrease the frequency of NA, it would also be of interest if such
combined interventions targeting all components of SWB could
be even more eﬀective than focusing PPIs only.

In addition to the constructs used here for evaluation,
self-eﬃcacy seems especially promising,
the construct of
as it
is associated both with well-being (e.g., Luszczynska
et al., 2005) and with intention building and behavior
(e.g., physical activity, Rovniak et al., 2002). Since general
self-eﬃcacy was not aﬀected in this study, domain-speciﬁc
variants should be used in further investigations.
In the
school context, Schmitz and Schwarzer (2000) were already
able to show correlations between teacher-speciﬁc self-eﬃcacy
and job satisfaction or burn-out. Zee and Koomen (2016)
synthesized 165 articles on teacher self-eﬃcacy (TSE) from
over 40 years of research concluding: “Results suggest that
TSE shows positive links with students’ academic adjustment,
patterns of teacher behavior and practices related to classroom
quality, and factors underlying teachers’ psychological well-
job satisfaction,
being,
including personal accomplishment,
and commitment” (p. 981). Furthermore,
in the ﬁeld of
positive psychology, a scale for measuring well-being-related self-
eﬃcacy with seven factors (positive focus, emotion regulation,
engagement, connectedness, meaning, goal achievement, and
time sovereignty) is currently being constructed and validated
(Rahm et al., in preparation).

In order to better classify results from interventions such as
well-being trainings, but also applications of short PPIs or even
more complex changes such as school development processes, it
would be helpful to obtain more precise information about the
ﬂuctuations in well-being over the course of the (school) year.
Findings about such general variations might also contribute
to the explanation of eﬀects of PPIs and multi-component
interventions. In addition, knowledge about periods regarding
well-being or ill-being, such as more relaxed or more stressful
times, could be used to determine the right timing for well-
being interventions. Furthermore, ﬁndings in this area could
also make valuable contributions to the current discussion on
hedonic adaptation and set point theory (Brown and Rohrer,
2019; Luhmann and Intelisano, 2018).

Another promising ﬁeld for further research is the inﬂuence
of improved teacher well-being on students. What happens to
school climate and class climate, what happens to pedagogical
relationships, and what happens to the well-being and academic
performance of the students if the teaching staﬀ is continuously
trained and supported in the sense of positive psychology?

CONCLUSION

As the research on the broaden-and-build theory revealed
favorable outcomes of increasing the frequency of PA, such as
higher resilience, social connection, and functioning at optimal

In summary, it can be concluded that the training was well-
received by the participants and increased their SWB for at least
1 month after the training. Due to the low organizational and

time expenditure, it can be easily integrated into the training
systems for teachers. In the context of the growing ﬁeld of
positive education, the training could prove to be a motivating
starting point for school development processes to promote well-
being and ﬂourishing for teachers and students if the results
found here can also be replicated in methodologically stricter
research designs.
