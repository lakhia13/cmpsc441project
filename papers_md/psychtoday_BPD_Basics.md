Borderlinepersonality disorderis a condition characterized by instability and impulsivity. The term originates from being on the “border” ofpsychosis—those with the condition seem to have a different sense of reality.

Instability manifests in relationships,emotion, andself-concept. Terrified of abandonment, people with BPD cling to those close to them, crave reassurance and validation, and are upset by seemingly small changes. Turbulence in emotion and self-concept can involve angry outbursts, severe mood swings, hopelessness,paranoia,self-harm, andsuicidality; 10 percent of those with the condition die by suicide.

BPD often begins inadolescenceor early adulthood. It affects around1.6 percentof U.S. adults, according to the NIMH, although other estimates place the prevalence closer to6 percent.

Committing to treatment with patience and consistency can help individuals and their loved ones navigate the condition. Various forms oftherapy, particularly dialectical behavior therapy, and medications to manage symptoms can help those with BPD lead a fulfilling life.

## Signs and Symptoms


To be diagnosed with BPD, a person would have at least five of the following symptoms, as determined by a mental health professional per theDSM-5.

- Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.

- A pattern of unstable and intense relationships characterized by alternat&shy;ing between extremes of idealization and devaluation.

- Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstableself-imageor sense of self.

- Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (spending,sex,substance abuse, reckless driving, or binge eating).

- Recurrentsuicidalbehavior or threats, or self-harming behavior.

- Instability of mood (dysphoria, irritability, oranxiety).

- Chronic feelings of emptiness.

- Inappropriate, intenseangeror difficulty controlling anger.

- Transient,stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.

Whether in moods or relationships, instability is a hallmark of BPD. The person may have wide mood swings, switching from effusive praise and love to intense criticism and blame. In moments of anger, they may do things like scream at you in public, hit you, or harm themselves—things that other people wouldn’t do in the same situation. A fear of abandonment may manifest as constant, clinginess or manipulating a relationship you have with someone else. If the person demonstrates these behaviors as a pattern, they may have BPD.

Here are a few more clues to look for in the person’s words, emotions, and behaviors that canidentify borderline personality disorder.

Yes,BPD seems to manifest differently in women and men.With regard to impulsive behavior, men tend to demonstrate substance use, antisocial behavior, and intermittent explosive disorder while women more often have eating disorders. With regard toself-harm, men may engage in more varied forms including bruising, head-banging and biting in addition to cutting.

With regard to treatment, women more often seek out therapy andmedicationwhile men more often seek substance use treatment. Both men and women enter treatment with equal levels of emotional distress.

Splitting is the black-and-white thinking that can engulf those with BPD. In moments ofhappinessthey can fawn over a friend or partner, calling the person “perfect,” while small setbacks or miscommunications can unleash terror or rage, calling the person “terrible” or “never trustworthy.” Theextreme perspectives involved in splittingcan also manifest in how people with BPD see themselves.

The termsquiet BPDandhigh-functioning BPD,which are not diagnostic labels, refer to peoplewho may not have stereotypical symptoms of BPD, such as angry outbursts or self-harming behaviors. Instead, symptoms and emotions are often directed inward or only come out in "pockets," such as when the person is triggered by certain people or situations. These individuals may seem calm and collected on the surface, but in reality they struggle from intenseloneliness,shame, and self-criticism.


## Causes and Risk Factors


The roots of borderlinepersonalitydisorder still aren’t fully understood. As is the case for many mental health conditions, it seems to be caused by complex interactions between one’s biology and environment.

The disorder has a strong genetic component, because the condition is five times more common in people whose first-degree relatives have BPD, according to the DSM-5. The balance of activity in key brain regions—namely the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala—may be shifted in people with BPD. Life circumstances also play an important role, as BPD is more common in those who experiencedchildhoodadversity, such as abuse or abandonment.

Past research has found that BPD occurs three times more in women than in men. Yetnewer researchsuggests that the rates may actually be comparable. Past discrepancies may be due to the condition presenting differently in men and women, diagnosticbias, and more women seeking treatment. Therefore it’s important to remember thatmen and women, and people of all races, struggle with BPD.

The extreme way people withBPD experience the world may reflect a glitch in brain dynamics.Typically, the prefrontal cortex, the part of the forebrain responsible forself-controlanddecision-making, governs the limbic system, an evolutionarily ancient set of brain regions that generate primal emotions such as fear, centered in the amygdala. But people with BPD seem to have less input from the prefrontal cortex to the amygdala. This leads to an overactive amygdala—perceiving threat and rejection where others would not.

Childhood experiences of parental neglect and emotional, physical, orsexual abuseare among the most importantrisk factors for BPD.These circumstances may lead children to frantically keep pace and shift strategies to navigate the unpredictability of parents and caregivers, instilling rejection anddistrustin the context of relationships.


## Treatment and Support


Historically borderline was thought to be nearly impossible to treat. But today experts recognize that the condition is treatable with commitment to therapy, greatly improving the lives of those with borderline.

The first-line treatment for BPD is dialectical behavior therapy, which teaches patients to tolerate emotional uncertainty and distress along with coping skills to regulate their emotions and build stable relationships.

Other forms of therapy can be effective as well. Cognitive behavior therapy targets distorted patterns of thought.Transference-focusedpsychotherapyhelps patients work through the emotional challenges that trigger borderline behavior. And mentalization-based treatment helps patients regain curiosity about others’ mental states to leverage another perspective.

In addition to therapy, medications may be prescribed to help address symptoms such as anxiety ordepression.

The go-to treatment forBPD has long been dialectical behavior therapy(DBT), an intensive program of group skills training onmindfulness, distress tolerance, conflictmanagement, andemotion regulation, supplemented by psychotherapy and phonecoaching.

Developed by University of Washingtonpsychologist Marsha Linehan—herself a BPD sufferer—DBT focuses on controlling the behaviors that characterize the disorder. Clients use techniques of mindfulness and distress tolerance to endure painful emotions instead of acting out through cutting, suicide attempts, unsafe sex, substance abuse, ordisordered eating.

Recovery is possible, but it requires long-term treatment; a10-year studyfound that 85 percent of those withBPD were in remissionby the end of the study. These individuals also showed improved social abilities, although overall they still faced difficulties.

People withborderline personality disorder compulsively test the durability of relationships. If therapists indulge this pressure, therapy aimed atpersonality changewill thereafter seem withholding; if therapists resist the pressure to prove they care, therapy will come to feel like a rejection. Therapists must neither feed or starve abandonment fears; in this way, they can engage the patient in changing how they relate to others.


## Relationships with People Who Have BPD


Close friendships, romance, and family bonds are often what people on the borderline crave the most, and they often move in whirlwind style to win over others. But sustaining intimacy is a colossal challenge, as the disorder embodies a poignant paradox: Sufferers yearn for closeness, but their overriding insecurity tends to drive away those most dear. Despite the self-defeating actions they typically deploy, it is not impossible for them to get beyond the histrionics to maintain closeness—and the very stability of a partner often proves curative.

Instability, volatility, anddrama are central features of relationships with borderline individuals.You may feel fantastic when the person is in good spirits and crushed when they are not. People with borderline respond to fears of abandonment with neediness, which may come across as clingy text messagesor stalking behaviors,or they may respond with anger and fury. They may be hypervigilant for real or imagined signs of rejection or abandonment should you, for example, be late, cancel an appointment, or talk to someone they see ascompetition. A continual sense of distrust may lead to a distorted sense of reality andparanoia.

Even those who recover from BPD are unlikely to ever be low-maintenance partners and friends. Loved ones need to develop skills such as stress management, self-care, and maintaining goodboundariesso they can look out for themselves while helping their partner.

The following tips canhelp a loved one with BPDand strengthen bonds:

• Avoid discussions about conflicts in your relationship until your partner feels calm and safe.

• Stay curious and ask your loved one what they are feeling.

• Emphasize that it's okay for both of you to not be perfect.

• People with BPD may threaten suicide or self-harm to keep you close. If you're staying with a partner or a friend only because you're worried he can't survive without you, it's time to seek help.Couples therapycan be a safe environment to express the impact of the person's behavior on your life.

Creating a stable life outside of aromantic relationshipis key to healing. Prioritizing work, including small, repeated interactions with coworkers, can help those with BPD achieve a steady routine, both professionally and socially. The same pattern can follow for building relationships with neighbors and friends. With a strong foundation in place, people withBPD may then be ready to take on an intimate relationship.
