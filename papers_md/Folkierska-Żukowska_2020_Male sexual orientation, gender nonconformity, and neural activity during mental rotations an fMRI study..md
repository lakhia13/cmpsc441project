The cross‑sex shift hypothesis predicts that gay men should perform more like heterosexual 
women on important neurocognitive tasks on which men score higher than women, such as mental 
rotation. Studies also suggest sex differences exist in the neural correlates of mental rotation. 
However, no studies have taken sexual orientation into account or considered within‑group variation 
attributable to recalled gender nonconformity (a developmental trait reliably associated with human 
nonheterosexuality). We quantified the neural correlates of mental rotation by comparing two groups 
of gay men, gender conforming (n = 23) and gender nonconforming (n = 23), to gender conforming 
heterosexual men (n = 22) and women (n = 22). We observed a sex difference between heterosexual 
men and women in the premotor cortex/supplementary motor cortex and left medial superior frontal 
gyrus. We also observed a sex difference as well as a cross‑sex shift in gay men who recalled being 
gender nonconforming as children in the right superior frontal gyrus, right angular gyrus, right 
amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus, and bilaterally in the middle temporal gyrus and precuneus. Thus, 
cross‑sex shifts may be associated with underlying developmental factors which are associated with 
sexual orientation (such as gender nonconformity). The results also suggest that gay men should not 
be studied as a homogenous group.

Sex differences in certain cognitive functions are well documented. On average, women perform better than men 
on tests of verbal fluency, emotion recognition, and object location  memory1–5. On average, men perform better 
than women on tests of spatial cognition, such as mental rotation and spatial perception (e.g., line orientation), 
and spatial memory tasks, such as navigation and route  learning4. In particular, the sex differences reported on 
mental rotation tasks are robust, reliable, and  large4–6 (ds between 0.56 and 0.735).

Several neuroimaging studies have investigated sex differences (irrespective of sexual orientation) in neural 
correlates of mental rotation using Shepard and Metzler type  tasks7. These studies reported differences between 
the neural activations found in men and women, even when there was no corresponding behavioural difference 
in task  performance8–14. The most common findings were higher activations in parietal areas in  men8,9,13,14 and 
higher activations in frontal areas in  women8,9,11, which were suggested to correspond to women using more 
effortful top-down (or analytic/serial) processing and men using bottom-up (or gestalt)  processing9–11. Never-
theless, two studies found higher activations in some parietal areas in women (with higher activations in other 
parietal areas in men)11,12 and two studies reported higher activations in males in the frontal  areas13,14. These are 
only the most consistent findings—many of the studies have also found unreplicated differences in other areas. 
The results of the relevant papers are summarised in Table 1. In terms of volumetric studies, Koscik et al. reported 
that women had greater grey matter volume in the parietal lobe than men, while men had a proportionally greater 
surface area of the parietal lobe, which corresponded with poorer mental rotation performance in women and 
better performance in men,  respectively15. Such morphological differences may even be present in  childhood16.
Growing evidence supports the notion that people of different sexual orientations also differ in certain types of 
cognitive ability. Heterosexual men perform better, on average, than gay men on tests such as mental rotation, line

(e.g., spatial cognition) and female-favouring (e.g., verbal fluency) cognitive tests, while lesbian women tended

psychological, behavioural, and cognitive traits supports the cross-sex shift  hypothesis26,27.

To date, no study has investigated sexual-orientation-related differences in neural activations during mental 
rotation tasks, however some post-mortem and neuroimaging studies have explored the relationship between 
sexual orientation and brain structure and function. Neuroimaging studies comparing heterosexual and gay men 
and women have reported various differences in structure and function, some of which could be considered to 
be cross-sex shifts. For example, the volumetric patterns of brain activity in both lesbian women and gay  men28, 
or grey matter volumes in the perirhinal cortex in lesbian  women29. Some of these effects seem to be unique to 
sexual orientation, such as cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal and visual  areas30 as well as the anatomy of the 
corpus callosum in gay  men31. Several small-scale neuroimaging studies have also suggested cross-sex shifts in 
homosexual men and women in brain responses to putative sex-specific pheromonal  compounds32,33. However, 
these have not been replicated. Previous post-mortem studies also pointed to small sexual-orientation-related 
differences in hypothalamic regions and the anterior commissure; again, there are no robust replications of 
 these27. All such studies are limited by small sample sizes, inconsistent reporting of methods for assessing sexual 
orientation, or failure to consider important confounders (such as general intelligence).

One important developmental factor associated with sexual orientation and, possibly, with sexual variation 
in cognition is childhood gender nonconformity (CGN). CGN refers to sex-atypical behaviours, interests, hob-
bies, activity levels, and play partner preferences before the age of 12. Both retrospective and prospective studies 
report a strong association between CGN and nonheterosexuality in  adulthood34,35. These studies indicate that 
gay men are, on average, more feminine in behaviour and interests during childhood compared to heterosexual 
men, while lesbian women are more masculine, on average, in these respects compared to heterosexual women. 
It is possible that gender nonconforming behaviours during childhood may influence time spent on sex-typed 
activities (e.g., playing video games) which then influence cross-sex shifted cognitive differences in adulthood. 
Some research suggests that men may also typically spend more time on spatial activities, such as video games, 
which could be associated with better spatial  abilities36,37. Several studies suggest that there are small associations 
between recalled CGN and performance in certain cognitive domains (e.g., object location  memory38 and verbal 
 intelligence20; cf. Rahman et al.39, and Rahman and  Yusuf40). There are also indications that adult psychological 
gender traits are associated with mental rotation performance, with higher masculinity correlating with higher 
scores in both men and  women41. These, albeit small, associations support the hypothesis that developmental 
CGN explains some of the variation in some behavioural correlates of sexual orientation (e.g., cognition)42. Fac-
tors such as genetic influences, prenatal sex hormones, or maternal immunization could comprise a common 
causal mechanism through which CGN is linked to sexual orientation and its neurocognitive  correlates27,42.

Importantly, recent work suggests there is not one single developmental pathway to male sexual orientation, 
but rather several distinct  ones43. Four biodevelopmental subgroups of male sexual orientation have been distin-
guished based on having certain developmental markers including fraternal birth order, handedness, and familial 
clustering of nonheterosexuality. Most heterosexual and nonheterosexual men were grouped in the profile that 
did not have any biomarker, and these also tended to be the most gender conforming. The three profiles linked 
to the biomarkers were mostly comprised of nonheterosexual men. This unique study suggests that there may 
be important and distinct subgroups within nonheterosexual men that require further study.

Given the current literature, the present study aimed to quantify the neural correlates of sexual-orientation-
related differences in performance on mental rotation for the first time. Mental rotation tasks are the most appro-
priate because they show robust sex and sexual-orientation-related behavioural differences and are associated 
with a reliable pattern of neural activity. The present study will also look at sex differences in mental rotation 
in the biggest sample thus far. Previous studies used small samples (most had ≤ 10 individuals per group; only 
one study had 20 per group), and the areas in which differences were reported varied, making it hard to identify 
consistently reported regions of interest (ROIs) associated with these differences. It will also be the first study 
on neural correlates of sexual orientation to consider developmental factors associated with sexual orientation 
or possible subgroups within sexual orientation categories.

As part of this study (described in the Supplementary Material), we found in a sample of over 700 gay and 
heterosexual men that mental rotation performance was related to CGN rather than sexual orientation per se. 
Based on this, as well as previous indications that gender nonconformity may be an important correlate of indi-
vidual differences in cognitive performance between and within the sexes, we hypothesised that gay men would 
score lower on mental rotations than heterosexual men and that individuals who report having been gender 
nonconforming in childhood would also score lower than those who report having been gender conforming. We 
tested these hypotheses in an offline behavioural study on a large sample of gay and heterosexual men (see the 
Supplementary Material). Next, we tested whether gay men show a cross-sex shifted pattern of neural activity 
while performing a mental rotation task in an fMRI scanner. We did this with two groups of gay men (gender 
conforming and gender nonconforming) and compared them with gender conforming heterosexual men and 
women. Specifically, we hypothesised that heterosexual men would show higher activations in the parietal region 
than heterosexual women and that heterosexual women would show higher activations in the frontal regions 
than heterosexual men. We further hypothesised that gender conforming gay men would show patterns of neural 
activations similar to those of heterosexual men and gender nonconforming men would show patterns of neural 
activations similar to those of heterosexual women. As such, our study considers both sexual orientation and 
gender (non)conformity and, thus, can help bring us closer to understanding which of these is more related to 
visuospatial skills. However, it cannot help settle the question of whether the observed differences are due to 
prenatal biological or postnatal psychosocial factors.

Results
Group characteristics.  The groups differed significantly in their CGN scores as expected (F(3,85) = 163.2, 
p < 0.001). Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) tests revealed no significant difference (p = 0.07) in terms 
of childhood levels of femininity/masculinity between childhood gender conforming heterosexual women and 
childhood gender nonconforming gay men and no significant difference (p = 0.898) between childhood gender 
conforming gay men and childhood gender conforming heterosexual men. These tests revealed significant dif-
ferences in childhood femininity/masculinity levels between childhood gender conforming heterosexual women 
and both childhood gender conforming gay men and childhood gender conforming heterosexual men. Further-
more, a significant difference in childhood femininity/masculinity levels was found between childhood gender 
nonconforming gay men and both childhood gender conforming gay men and childhood gender conforming 
heterosexual men (all at p < 0.001; Fig. 1). The groups did not differ significantly in IQ scores (F(3,85) = 0.74, 
p = 0.71) or age (F(3,85) = 0.45, p = 0.72). See Table s3 in the Supplementary Material for mean scores and stand-
ard deviations of these measures for each group.

Behavioural results (in‑scanner performance).  Mean scores and reaction times for these can be found 
in Table s2 of the Supplementary Material.

A two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a significant effect of difficulty level (F(3,255) = 150.16, p < 0.001) but no 
significant group effect (F(3,85) = 0.131, p = 0.941) or significant group–condition interaction (F(9,255) = 0.454, 
p = 0.866) for mental rotation scores (Fig. 2A). Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied to all results, as 
Mauchly’s test revealed that the data were non-spherical.

Similarly in the case of mental rotation reaction times, there was a significant effect of difficulty level 
(F(3,255) = 877.14, p < 0.001), but no significant group effect (F(3,85) = 0.457, p = 0.713) or significant group–con-
dition interaction (F(9,255) = 1.36, p = 0.206; Fig. 2B). Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied to all results, 
as Mauchly’s test revealed that the data were non-spherical.

Brain activations: main effect  of task.  A  whole-brain  F-test  on  the  entire  sample  with  4  conditions 
(compare, rotate easy, rotate medium, and rotate hard) revealed the activations in the brain network presented 
in Fig. 3 and Table 2.

Post-hoc analysis using a t-test identified the structures which were more activated in the rotate condition 

versus the compare condition as well as those which were less activated (Fig. 4 and Table 2).

Brain activations: group differences.  Following previous mental rotation literature (e.g., Butler et al., 
2006),  rotate  conditions  were  combined  for  group  comparisons.  Whole-brain  analysis  (F-test,  height  thresh-
old:  F(3,86) = 5.93,  p < 0.001,  with  FWEc  correction)  revealed  a  significant  main  effect  of  group  in  rotate 
(easy + medium + hard) > baseline in several structures (Fig. 5, Table 3).

Region-of-interest analysis of the clusters in which a main effect of group was observed revealed significant 

group differences. Results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table s3 in the Supplementary Material.

Discussion
This study investigated whether the previously reported cross-sex shift in performance on the mental rotation 
task in gay men could be observed in terms of neural activations. In a behavioural study (described in the Sup-
plementary Material) we found that CGN, but not sexual orientation, explains some of the variance in mental 
rotation performance. This result indicates that the cross-sex shift observed in previous studies may not be 
related to sexual orientation per se, but rather to underlying developmental factors which contribute to sexual 
orientation (namely, childhood gender nonconformity).

This served as a basis for the design of the current study, where, using fMRI, we compared neural activations 
during a mental rotation task between gender nonconforming gay men, gender conforming gay men, and gender 
conforming heterosexual men and women. Based on previous results regarding sex differences, we hypothesised 
that heterosexual men would show stronger activations in the parietal lobe than heterosexual women and het-
erosexual women would show stronger activations in the frontal lobe than heterosexual men. We also hypoth-
esised that this pattern of differences would be cross-sex shifted in gay men who recalled having been gender 
nonconforming in childhood, but not in those who reported having been gender conforming. Our hypotheses 
regarding parietal regions were largely confirmed; however contrary to our expectations, we observed stronger 
frontal activations in men than in women (with only a partial cross-sex shift in gender nonconforming gay men).

Nevertheless, we also observed significant differences in activations between the groups in other regions, some 
consistent with our hypothesis regarding the cross-sex shift, which is discussed in more detail below.

Performance on the mental rotation task in the scanner decreased with increasing difficulty, which indicates 
that the difficulty levels were valid. Whole-brain analysis of the task effect, performed irrespective of sex and 
sexual orientation, revealed a network of task-related activations that were largely consistent with previous 
 findings44.

There were strong positive activations associated with mental rotation bilaterally in the parietal lobe, superior 
frontal gyrus, and thalamus. The activations in the right angular gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left angular 
gyrus, and bilaterally in the posterior/middle cingulate gyrus were higher in the compare condition, when there 
was no need for mental rotation. The network of structures in which activations decreased during mental rota-
tion corresponds partially to the default mode network, which could indicate increasing attentional focus with 
increasing task difficulty or less time spent on mind-wandering, as reaction times increased with task  difficulty45.

Table 3.   Group effects: results of whole-brain one-way ANOVA in the rotate > baseline contrast.

There were no group differences in mental rotation performance in the scanner. However, this might be due 
to the sample size being too small to detect such behavioural differences. Nevertheless, this allowed us to focus 
on group differences in neural activations without them being confounded by performance differences or group 
differences in learning (and groups were matched in terms of general intelligence). In terms of the hypothesised 
group differences in neural activations, we focused on rotate versus baseline contrasts in a whole-brain analysis, 
consistent with previous  approaches9,46,47. Tests for main effects showed group differences in clusters bilaterally 
in the precuneus, right angular gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, bilaterally in the medial segment of the 
precentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, in a cluster extending from the right amygdala to right parahip-
pocampal gyrus, the left medial superior frontal gyrus, and right superior frontal gyrus. The structures in which 
we observed group differences only partially overlap with the structures where sex differences have been previ-
ously  reported8–14.

Post-hoc region-of-interest group comparisons revealed that both of the gender conforming groups of men 
had higher activations than gender conforming women in the precuneus (part of the superior parietal lobule), 
resembling some of the previous reports of sex  differences8,9,13. This is somewhat consistent with our hypothesis 
about the role of childhood gender nonconformity in any cross-sex shift. The superior parietal lobule is the 
structure most consistently reported as central to mental  rotation44. In general, many fMRI studies on sex dif-
ferences in neural correlates of mental rotation report higher activations in the parietal lobe in men, but no such 
study has explicitly measured the sexual orientation of the male and female  participants8,9,13. A similar pattern 
of group differences was observed for the right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus. Previous studies have shown 
that the activity of the amygdala can modulate the activity of the superior parietal lobe through connection with 
subcortical structures, facilitating more efficient mental  rotation48, which could explain the similar pattern of 
group differences in the two areas.

Childhood gender nonconformity was also associated with both the left and right middle temporal gyrus 
activations, where we additionally observed a statistically significant difference between heterosexual men and 
gender nonconforming gay men. Higher activation in this region during mental rotation in men than in women 
has also been previously  reported14. This pattern, together with the pattern observed in the right angular gyrus 
(a region important for number processing and spatial  cognition49) is the most consistent with our hypotheses 
regarding the cross-sex shift. Here too, in addition to the fact that only gender conforming men differed from 
women, there was also a significant difference between the two groups of gay men, and heterosexual men dif-
fered from gender nonconforming gay men. Sex differences in the anatomy and function of the right angular

gyrus have been previously reported: one study found higher activations in this region in men than women 
during performance of mathematical tasks, but greater volume and grey matter density in this area in  women50. 
However, our result is inconsistent with that of Butler et al.9, who demonstrated higher activations in the angular 
gyrus in women than in men during mental rotation; furthermore, this result is surprising in the context of the 
task-effect analysis, which indicated that it was more active when there was no rotation.

In the right superior frontal gyrus, only the gender conforming men differed from women, and their activa-
tions were higher, which is inconsistent with some previous  studies8,9,11, which found higher activations in frontal 
areas in women than in men. This was interpreted as indicating the use of a top-down processing strategy (in 
contrast to the bottom-up strategy employed by men). However, our results are in-line with studies which showed 
higher activations bilaterally in the frontal gyrus in men than in women during mental  rotation12–14. However, 
the differences in the left medial superior frontal gyrus were limited to between-sexes, with lower activations 
in women than in all groups of men. Similarly, in the area of the precentral/paracentral gyrus corresponding to 
the premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex (areas that are also crucial to mental  rotation51), only a 
sex difference was observed, with all groups of men characterised by similar activations—all higher than those 
observed in women.

Since we did not measure spatial strategies in our study, we cannot infer whether strategy differences explain 
some of the group differences observed. However, given that we conducted the fMRI scans under conditions of 
no behavioural differences in mental rotation performance, and yet we observed differences in neural activa-
tions, it is possible that the groups may have employed different strategies to solve the task. Previous studies 
suggest that the different strategies used to solve mental rotation tasks may be associated with different patterns 
of brain  activations44.

The patterns of group differences suggest that the cross-sex shift is substantially associated with gender 
nonconformity, rather than sexual orientation per se—higher activations in the identified structures largely 
correspond to higher masculinity. The results of our study fit well with the idea of the existence of sub-groupings 
within sexual orientation  categories43.

Theoretically speaking, there are several hypothesised developmental mechanisms thought to be involved in 
sex and sexual-orientation-related neurocognitive differences. These primarily include hormonal and psycho-
social influences. Prenatal androgens may act on the developing brain to organise these  differences52. Other sug-
gested mechanisms involve learning or gender-related socialization. On one hand, it has been found that mental 
rotation performance in boys as young as 5 months old correlates positively with perinatal testosterone  levels53. 
On the other hand, parents and peers may encourage more spatial play in boys than in  girls54–56. Interestingly, 
one study suggested that mental rotation performance in 5-month-old girls (but not boys) was correlated with 
the stereotypicality of parents’ attitudes about gender. Some studies on infants show that boys have an advantage 
on the mental rotation task as early as between 3 and 13 months, reporting medium effect sizes (η2p between

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/0.07–0.01557–59), which could be explained by both biological and social influences (however, some studies did 
not find  this60). At present, it is not clear how socialisation-related factors would operate with respect to known 
sexual-orientation-related differences. One might expect that heterosexual and gay men are gender socialised in 
the same manner, yet they still show differences in certain areas of cognitive ability (heterosexual men being more 
male-typical and gay men being more female-typical). Based on our results, we cannot know whether cross-sex 
shifts in brain activations were more likely in gender nonconforming gay men than in gender conforming gay 
men due to prenatal or postnatal (including socialisation) factors. However, there are previous indications that 
childhood gender role behaviours are associated with prenatal factors (such as androgen  exposure61 or maternal 
 immunity43), and our results warrant further investigation of this matter. As well as a direct effect of biological 
influences on both childhood gender nonconformity and mental rotation abilities, there could be an indirect 
effect of biological influences on childhood gender nonconformity, which, in turn, would lead to differences 
in psychosocial factors that affect mental rotation (e.g., being interested in video games or other activities that 
facilitate the development of spatial abilities).

The present study has several important strengths. Our samples were well characterised in terms of sexual 
orientation (using multiple dimensions on a standardised measure) and levels of gender nonconformity (using 
a standardised measure). This has never been done before. Previous studies on sex differences simply assumed 
(or did not mention) that their male and female participants were heterosexual. Our participants were matched 
in terms of important confounders, such as age and IQ scores. Moreover, in order to increase statistical power, 
we defined our CGN groups based on k-cluster analysis, dividing a sample of almost 600 men into three clusters 
and recruiting from the two extreme clusters. We developed and used a robust and validated mental rotation 
task. The lack of mental rotation task differences in the fMRI part of this study allowed us to investigate putative 
group differences, unaffected by task performance or task-related learning processes. This allowed us to better 
quantify possible differences in basic or fundamental neural processes involved in task completion.

Nevertheless, there are several noteworthy limitations. Our study did not include lesbian women. Further-
more, despite the fact that we conducted a k-cluster analysis to create two subgroups of gay men on each extreme 
of the CGN spectrum, we had to include several participants from the low-scoring end of the middle group. 
We did not measure the strategies used by the participants when performing the mental rotation task, and thus 
we cannot know if the observed differences in activations are due to differences in strategies. Participants were 
not explicitly instructed when to ‘rotate’ and when to ‘compare’ the figures (cf. Butler et al.9). In our study, par-
ticipants might also have attempted to rotate the figures they were meant to compare, thus we couldn’t rely on 
the rotate versus compare contrast in our analyses and had to also contrast rotation with baseline. While this 
approach has been used in many previous  studies9,46,47, it is possible that we observed results that are not fully 
specific to the process of rotation, but are also common to other aspects of the visual processing of the stimuli. 
However, it is important to note that this limitation is consistent across groups. The fact that participants prac-
ticed the mental rotation task a day before the fMRI scan could be related to the lack of behavioural difference 
found here. There are also some indications that performance on the mental rotation task may be influenced by 
circulating testosterone levels as well as menstrual cycle  phase62, neither of which were controlled in our study. 
Finally, as the participants were not informed about the hypotheses before the study and were generally naive 
about the study goals, it is unlikely that they could have been primed in a way that would trigger implicit gender 
stereotypes about performance on visuospatial tasks. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that some 
spatial anxiety may have played a role in the performance of female participants in particular.

Conclusion and future directions
We found evidence that a cross-sex shift occurs in gender nonconforming gay men only in several theoretically 
important brain regions of interest. Namely, in the right superior frontal gyrus, bilaterally in the middle temporal 
gyrus and precuneus, as well as the right angular gyrus and right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus. This indi-
cates that further investigations of differences within sexual orientation categories are warranted. Indeed, there 
is growing evidence that gay men are not a homogenous single category but may be characterised by distinct 
biodevelopmental sub-groupings43. Future studies should also aim to better quantify sex and sexual-orientation-
related differences in brain activations when performing mental rotation using fully factorial designs (includ-
ing lesbian women) and test the relationship between behavioural, strategy, and neural activity patterns when 
performing mental rotation in well-powered samples.

Methods
Participants.  We  decided  to  study  men  because  effect  sizes  for  gay  men  performing  similarly  to  hetero-
sexual women on spatial tasks are much greater than those for lesbians outperforming straight women (e.g., see 
meta-analyses by Xu et al., 2017,  202026,63). We divided them into subgroups based on recalled childhood gender 
nonconformity and included only heterosexual women as a comparison group; lesbian women were not studied.
Gender nonconforming gay men (n = 23, mean age: 27.09, SD = 3.95), gender conforming gay men (n = 23, 
mean age: 26.26, SD = 4.48), gender conforming heterosexual men (n = 22, mean age: 25.59, SD = 3.65), and 
gender conforming heterosexual women (n = 22, mean age: 26.33, SD = 3.48) took part in this study. All study 
participants were of Polish nationality and were ethnically white. Behavioural data (scores and reaction times) 
from one subject from the heterosexual male group were excluded from analyses due to technical issues with 
the answering pad during the scan.

Recruitment procedures.  Male participants were recruited in Poland via an online survey completed as a 
part of a larger project concerning correlates of sexual orientation. The survey was distributed through Facebook 
(paid adverts and organic traffic), leaflets, posters, and word of mouth. Male participants for the fMRI study

Material) and had attended the laboratory meeting before June 2018 (N = 594; of whom, 369 were gay and 226 
heterosexual), and consented to be contacted about the fMRI study. For this study, participants were divided into 
three clusters using k-means cluster analysis based on their scores on the Recalled Childhood Gender Identity/
Gender Role Questionnaire. There were 70 (18.97%) gay participants and one (< 0.01%) heterosexual participant 
in the highly gender nonconforming cluster, 191 (51.76%) gay and 50 (22.12%) heterosexual men in the middle 
cluster, and 108 (29.27%) gay and 174 (76.99%) heterosexual men in the highly gender conforming cluster. Gay 
participants were recruited from the highly conforming and nonconforming clusters, while heterosexual par-
ticipants were recruited only from the highly gender conforming cluster. They were asked whether they would 
be willing to participate in an fMRI study and were interviewed regarding fMRI exclusion criteria. Because it 
proved impossible to recruit all 23 gender nonconforming participants from the appropriate cluster, 10 partici-
pants were recruited from among those with the lowest CGN scores in the middle cluster. Groups were matched 
as they were recruited such that there were no statistically significant differences in terms of age or IQ scores. 
Gender conforming female participants were recruited via a separate on-line questionnaire, advertised on-line 
(in the same way as the study pertaining to men), which included the same measures of sexual orientation, gen-
der, and CGN, as well as demographic questions and questions regarding MRI exclusion criteria. Based on their 
age, psychological gender, and levels of CGN, they were invited to take the pen-and-paper IQ test. Women were 
then invited to the fMRI study such that the female group matched the male groups. All participants who com-
pleted the fMRI scan received a remuneration of 135 PLN (about 30 euros). Information about the remuneration 
was mentioned in the advertising materials.

Behavioural measures.  Sexual orientation was assessed using a Polish  adaptation64 of the Sell Assessment 
of Sexual  Orientation65. This tool measures three dimensions of sexual orientation: sexual attractions, sexual 
contact, and sexual identity. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are measured separately. For the purposes of 
this study, we defined predominantly heterosexual men as those who had been sexually attracted to either 0 or 
1 men in the past year; who had never been attracted to a man or were attracted to a man less than once per 
month; whose attraction to a man in the past year ranged from “not at all” to “mildly”; who had been sexually 
attracted to at least one woman in the past year; who had been sexually attracted to a woman at least once a 
month; and who identified as “not at all homosexual” or “slightly homosexual” and as either “very heterosexual” 
or  “extremely  heterosexual”.  Criteria  for  predominantly  homosexual  men  were,  mutatis  mutandis,  identical. 
Questions about sexual contact were not included in our criteria, as they have the limitation of being potentially 
constrained by social censure of same-sex sexuality. Only cis-gender men (i.e., men who reported being assigned 
male at birth and currently identified as male) took part.

Recalled childhood gender nonconformity was measured using a Polish adaptation of the Recalled Childhood 
Gender Identity/Gender Role  Questionnaire66. The questionnaire was adapted for this study with the involvement 
of its author, and was translated and then back-translated. Only items corresponding to Factor 1 of the scale 
(concerning gender conformity) were analysed. An example of an item (and its associated point score) would be 
“As a child, the characters on TV or in the movies that I imitated or admired were: a. always girls or women (1), b. 
usually girls or women (2), c. girls/women and boys/men equally (3), d. usually boys or men (4), e. always boys or 
men (5), f. I did not imitate or admire characters on TV or in the movies”. A mean score was calculated for each 
participant for which the absolute range was 1–5, with 1 corresponding to extremely feminine behaviour and 5 
to extremely masculine behaviour (in the original, scoring for women is reversed; we inverted it, so that scoring 
was identical for both sexes). A response of “I did not do this/feel this way” to an item was omitted. Since the 
questioning of traditional gender roles has intensified in recent years, for clarity we modified the instructions on 
the questionnaire by adding ‘In the case of the words "feminine" and "masculine", we refer to their stereotypical 
definitions functioning in society.’ The Cronbach’s alpha in our sample was 0.91.

General intelligence levels (IQ) were measured using the first half of the pen-and-paper version of the Polish 
 adaptation67 of Cattell’s Revised Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFT20R), with a maximum possible score of 56.

Mental  rotation  task.  The  experimental  procedure  was  prepared  using  Presentation  software  (Version 
20.1, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, www.neuro bs.com), and was based on the Shepard and Met-
zler task and its previous adaptations for fMRI experiment  procedures7,9. Participants assessed whether two 3D 
 figures68 presented next to one another on a grey background were identical or mirror images at four difficulty 
levels: compare, rotate easy, rotate medium, and rotate hard (rotations at 0°, 20°–60°, 80°–120°, and 140°–180°, 
respectively). Stimuli were presented in a block design with 24 pseudo-randomised blocks. Each block consisted 
of eight 5-s trials of the same difficulty level. Each trial consisted of 1 s fixation cross, 5 s stimulus presentation, 
and an inter-trial interval of a randomised duration between 1.5 s–3.5 s. Blocks were separated by 10 s breaks. 
The entire procedure was delivered over 4 fMRI sessions of six blocks each (counterbalanced in terms of the 
number of tasks of each difficulty per session) and lasted a total of about 30 min. Participants had to provide 
their answers during the 5 s of stimulus presentation and could score either 0 (incorrect or timeout) or 1 (cor-
rect) on each trial. The procedure was preceded by training, which consisted of 10 trials at various difficulty lev-
els and with feedback (correct/incorrect/timeout). Participants completed the training twice (once outside the 
scanner and once inside the scanner) in order to familiarise themselves with using the response pads. No feed-
back was given during the actual test. The paradigm is available upon request from the corresponding author. 
Sample stimuli are presented in Fig. 7.

Note that in order to minimise potential performance bias due to men having previously performed the 
mental rotation test in the behavioural study described in the Supplementary Materials, all participants solved 
the Vanderberg and Kuse mental rotation  test69 as practice one day before the scan.

fMRI data acquisition.  The participants performed the mental rotation task during a functional scan in 
a 3 T Siemens MAGNETOM Trio system (Siemens Medical Solutions) equipped with a 12-channel head coil. 
The functional scan (EPI images—TR: 2500 ms, TE: 28 ms, flip angle: 80°, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view: 
216 mm, measurements: 240) was accompanied by a structural scan (T1-weighted image—TR: 2530 ms, TE: 
3.32 ms, flip angle: 7°, voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm, field of view: 256 mm) and a field map scan (TR: 800 ms, TE: 
6.81 ms, flip angle: 60°, voxel size: 3 × 3 × 3 mm, field of view: 216 mm).

Behavioural  analyses  (in‑scanner  performance).  The  behavioral  analysis  was  included  to  assess 
whether the sex and sexual-orientation-related differences in task performance were replicated in the present 
study. Behavioural differences between groups in terms of scores and reaction times for the mental rotation task 
performed during the scans were analysed using a two-way mixed ANOVA in IBM SPSS.

fMRI preprocessing and analyses.  The DICOM series were converted to NIfTI using the Horos (Osirix) 
Bids Output Extension (https ://githu b.com/mslw/horos -bids-outpu t), which is based on the dcm2niix converter 
(https ://githu b.com/rorde nlab/dcm2n iix). The fMRI images were preprocessed and analysed with SPM12 (https 
://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/). The preprocessing pipeline included: correction of inhomogeneous static mag-
netic field-induced distortion; correction for head movement—realignment to the first image; coregistration of 
the anatomical image to the mean functional image; segmentation of the coregistered structural image with the 
default tissue probability maps; normalisation to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (voxel size 
after normalisation: 2 × 2 × 2); and smoothing with an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian Kernel. The Artifact Detection 
Toolbox  (ART;  https ://www.nitrc .org/proje cts/artif act_detec t/)  was  used  to  identify  motion  outliers  (transla-
tion threshold: 2 mm; rotation threshold: 0.02 radians). The resulting regressors were added into the first level 
models.

General linear modeling was used to model the task-related differences. The model included onsets and 
durations of blocks of each difficulty level (compare and all rotate conditions) and the presentation of a fixation 
cross (baseline). A high-pass filter of 256 s was applied. For the second-level analyses, task-related activations 
were first identified for the entire group using an ANOVA model with a main effect of task with 4 levels: com-
pare > baseline, rotate easy > baseline, rotate medium > baseline, and rotate hard > baseline. On the group level, a 
voxel-wise height threshold of p < 0.001 (uncorrected) combined with a cluster-level extent threshold of p < 0.05 
(corrected for multiple comparisons using the family wise error rate) was employed for whole-brain analyses.

Whole-brain group differences were assessed using an ANOVA model where the four groups were compared 
on the rotate (easy + medium + hard) > baseline contrast. Beta values for the clusters in which group differences 
were revealed by the F-test were then extracted using MarsBar (https ://marsb ar.sourc eforg e.net/index .html). A 
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference pairwise comparisons was performed using the R 
 software70 to assess the character and directions of group differences in neural activations (beta values) in these 
clusters. The post-hoc analyses were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Behavioural 
results were visualised using the ggplot2 package for  R71. Imaging results were visualised using MRIcroGL (https 
://www.nitrc .org/proje cts/mricr ogl/).

The study was approved by the Ethics Board of the Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw. All proce-
dures performed in this study were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. 
All participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study.
