Abstract
Background: The benefits of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) for humans with mental disorders
have been well-documented using cats and dogs, but there is a complete lack of controlled studies
using farm animals as therapeutic agents for psychiatric patients. The study was developed in the
context of Green care, a concept that involves the use of farm animals, plants, gardens, or the
landscape  in  recreational  or  work-related  interventions  for  different  target  groups  of  clients  in
cooperation with health authorities. The present study aimed at examining effects of a 12-week
intervention  with  farm  animals  on  self-efficacy,  coping  ability  and  quality  of  life  among  adult
psychiatric patients with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses.

Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial and follow-up. Ninety patients (59 women
and 31 men) with schizophrenia, affective disorders, anxiety, and personality disorders completed
questionnaires to assess self-efficacy (Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale; GSE), coping ability (Coping
Strategies  Scale),  and  quality  of  life  (Quality  of  Life  Scale;  QOLS-N)  before,  at  the  end  of
intervention,  and  at  six  months  follow-up.  Two-thirds  of  the  patients  (N  =  60)  were  given
interventions; the remaining served as controls.

Results: There was significant increase in self-efficacy in the treatment group but not in the control
group from before intervention (SB) to six months follow-up (SSMA), (SSMA-SB; F1,55 = 4.20, p=
0.05) and from end of intervention (SA) to follow-up (SSMA-SA; F1,55 = 5.6, p= 0.02). There was
significant increase in coping ability within the treatment group between before intervention and
follow-up (SSMA-SB = 2.7, t = 2.31, p = 0.03), whereas no changes in quality of life was found. There
were no significant changes in any of the variables during the intervention.

Conclusion: AAT with farm animals may have positive influences on self-efficacy and coping ability
among psychiatric patients with long lasting psychiatric symptoms.

Background
The utilization of agricultural farms as a basis for promot-

ing  human  mental  and  physical  health  in  cooperation
with health authorities is growing in several countries in

Europe  and  in  the  United  States  of  America.  In  some
countries this is called Green care, a concept which is not
restricted to the use of animals, but also includes plants,
gardens,  forests,  and  the  landscape.  Historically,  Green
care  farms  were  associated  with  hospitals,  psychiatric
departments  and  other  health  institutions.  Today,  most
Green  care  projects  involve  community  gardens,  city
farms, allotment gardens and farms. Because many Green
care  farms  are  rather  small  compared  with  traditional
farms, there is often a diversity of activities, with the pos-
sibility of meaningful work for different people and target
groups.  Other  positive  experiences  with  Green  care  like
self-esteem, responsibility and sense of purpose are simi-
lar in the different countries [1]. During the last decade,
an  increasing  number  of  persons  with  mental  disorders
work with farm animals as part of their therapy [2-5].

Although  Animal-Assisted  Therapy  (AAT)  for  humans
with  mental  disorders  has  been  well  documented  with
cats and dogs, there is a complete lack of controlled stud-
ies  of  farm  animals  as  therapeutic  agents  for  psychiatric
patients.  Previous  studies  of  AAT  with  companion  ani-
mals  have  documented  that  human-animal  interaction
may decrease stress levels [6-12], and is shown to improve
self-confidence,  social  competence  and  quality  of  life
[13,14]. As it is shown that different types of animals may
have  different  impact  on  people's  health  [15,16],  it  is
therefore worth investigating to what extent contact and
work  with  farm  animals  will  contribute  to  self-efficacy,
coping  ability  and  quality  of  life  among  psychiatric
patients.

In AAT with farm animals, we suggest that the combined
effect of both contact and work with the animals can affect
the patients positively; by providing a source of physical
contact with a living "other", and increased coping ability
and  self-esteem  through  routines  that  include  feeding,
milking, and caring for other living creatures. Green care
programs  with  farm  animals  can  be  important  supple-
ments  to  a  traditional  psychiatric  treatment  in  reaching
the goals of self-esteem and coping ability. An interven-
tion with farm animals will shift from care in an institu-
integration  and
tional  regime

increased  social 

to 

We have earlier reported increased intensity and exactness
of  work  by  patients  with  psychiatric  disorders  in  a  12-
week  intervention  with  farm  animals  [17,18].  The
patients also showed significantly lower anxiety at the end
of the intervention and at follow-up six months after the
end of the intervention compared with baseline. No such
changes were found for the control group.

In the present paper based on the same sample we report
on effects on self-efficacy, coping ability and quality of life

of a 12-week intervention with farm animals for adult psy-
chiatric patients. The aims of the present study were as fol-
lows:

1)  To  examine  whether  animal-assisted  therapy  for  psy-
chiatric patients  was  associated with  higher self-efficacy,
coping ability and quality of life after treatment and at six
months follow-up.

2) To assess if there were different treatment responses in
the different diagnostic groups.

3) To investigate the relationship between changes in self-
efficacy,  coping  ability  and  quality  of  life  and  specific
questions related to the intervention.

Methods
Sample
Therapists recruited the candidate patients, and informed
written  consent  was  obtained.  The  Norwegian  Data
Inspectorate  and  the  Regional  Committee  for  Medical
Research Ethics approved the project, and the study took
part  between  February  1,  2003  and  January  1,  2006.
Ninety adult psychiatric patients with a variety of psychi-
atric diagnoses were requited, and there were 59 (65.6%)
women  and  31  (34.4%)  men  [Additional  file  2].  The
mean age (± SD) was 34.7 ± 10.7 (range 18–58) years. In
the patient group there were 14 inpatients (15.5 %) and
76  outpatients  (84.5  %).  Diagnoses  were  made  by  the
treating psychiatrists using the ICD 10 criteria [19], and
the main diagnoses were 34 (37.7 %) schizophrenia and
schizotypal disorders (F 20–29), 22 (24.4 %) affective dis-
orders (F 30–39), 10 (11.1 %) anxiety and stress-related
disorders (F 40–49), and 22 (24.4 %) disorders of adult
personality  and  behaviour  (F  60–69).  There  was  one
patient with eating disorders (F 50) in the treatment group
who dropped out, and one patient with behavioural dis-
orders due to psychoactive substance use (F11) in the con-
trol  group  who  completed  the  project.  This  patient  was
omitted  when  analysing  for  effects  of  diagnosis.  For  15
randomly chosen patients, the diagnoses were checked for
consensus  between  treating  and  research  psychiatrists
using  the  ICD  10  criteria  [19]  and  all  were  found  to
accord.

More than 50 % of the patients had been ill for more than
five years, and 72 % had been treated in psychiatric health
institutions for more than three years. As much as 83% of
the  90  included  patients  received  daily  medication,
mainly  antipsychotics  (53  %),  antidepressants  (50  %),
sedatives (35 %) and mood stabilizers (27 %). Exclusion
criteria were: (a) age less than 18 years, (b) acute psychotic
disorders, (c) mental retardation, (d) serious drug addic-

tion,  and  (e)  being  in  a  job  during  the  six  last  months
prior to start of intervention. No minimal levels of symp-
toms were required.

Randomization
The patients were randomized by computerized random
numbers by BOB to intervention with farm animals or to
a control group. There was two-thirds (60 patients) to AAT
and one-third (30 patients) to control. The reason for this
division was that we expected more drop-outs in the treat-
ment  than  in  the  control  group  due  to  experience  in  a
pilot project. Diagnoses and other demographic variables
were  unknown  during  the  randomization  process.  The
patients were well informed of the possibilities of getting
into either of the two groups, and no one withdrew after
the results of the randomization.

The farms and farmers
Among the 15 recruited farmers there were seven women
and eight men. Only two farmers had earlier experience
with  psychiatric  patients.  The  main  productions  were
dairy cows (N = 10 farms, mean 20 animals), specialised
meat  production  with  cattle  (N  =  2,  mean  22  animals),
sheep (N = 2, mean 30 animals), or horses (N = 1, mean
18 animals). All farmers had small animals like rabbits,
poultry, pigs, cats or dogs as a part of the milieu on the
farm.

Intervention
The treatment group received standard therapy (individ-
ual, group therapy or other kinds of therapy) and stable
medical  treatment  in  addition  to  the  intervention.  The
control group got treatment as usual. No significant differ-
ences in standard therapy, medication, educational level
and  outpatient/inpatient  ratio  at  baseline  were  found
between the groups.

The patients visited a farm for three hours twice a week for
12  weeks  to  work  with  the  farm  animals.  One  or  two

patients visited the farm at each time. The patients were
only working with the animals; they were not allowed to
do other kinds of farm work. The farmers were told that
the  work  should  depend  on  the  patient's  coping  ability
and interest, and that patients should have the opportu-
nity  of  physical  contact  with  the  animals.  The  farmers
were always close to the patients during the work with the
animals to ensure that there were no risks related to the
contact with the animals. The patients were also trained in
the working routines during the first week of the interven-
tion.  An  overview  over  the  most  frequent  behaviours  in
the interaction with the animals is given in Table 1.

Outcome measures
Three different inventories were used. These instruments
are all tested for their validity and reliability and are com-
monly  used in psychiatric  research  and  clinical  practice.
The patients' scores were obtained before the intervention
(SB),  in  the  end  of  the  intervention  (after:  SA),  and  six
months after the end of the intervention (SSMA). Self-effi-
cacy  was  measured  with  the  Generalized  Self-Efficacy
Scale (GSE) assessing the strength of an individual's belief
in his/her ability to respond to novel or difficult situations
[20].  The  scale  comprises  ten  items,  and  the  patient
responds  to  a 4-point  scale  from 1 'not  at all true'  to 4'
exactly true'. The score range is 10–40. Coping was meas-
ured  using  the  Coping  Strategies  Scale  of  the  Pressure
Management  Indicator  [21,22].  The  scale  comprises  six
items measuring control coping and four items measuring
support coping and the patient responds to a 6-point scale
from 1 'never used by me' to 6 'very much used by me'.
The score range is 10–60. A Norwegian version of Quality
of Life Scale (QOLS-N) was used comprising 16 items and
reflecting  relations  to  other  humans,  work,  and  leisure
[23]. The patient responds on a 7-point scale with 1 'very
content'  to  7  'very  discontent'  with  the  score  range  of
16–112.  High  scores  reflect  high  degree  of  self-efficacy,
coping and quality of life. Thirty of the patients complet-
ing  the  intervention  answered  a  final  questionnaire

related to their experience with the intervention. The fol-
lowing questions were used: "To what extent has the con-
tact  and  work  with  the  animals  affected  your  coping
ability  in  daily  life;  –  your  mood;  –  your  self-esteem;  –
your working ability; – made you more extrovert and talk-
ative?" and "To what extent has the physical contact with
the animals been important to you as part of the work?".
The  patients  answered  on  a  5-point  scale  from  1  'much
worse/very little' to 5 'much better/very much', with point
3 'no change'.

Statistics
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by standard
least square means with three difference scores (interven-
tion  period:  SA-SB;  intervention  +  post-intervention:
SSMA-SB,  and  post-intervention:  SSMA-SA)  as 
the
dependent variables, patient group (treatment: T/control:
C)  and  diagnosis  as  the  independent  variables,  and  the
interaction  between  patient  group  and  diagnosis.
Matched-paired t-tests were performed to examine differ-
ences in means between time points for each group (T or
C). Spearman correlation analyses were used to measure
correlations  between  self-efficacy  and  coping,  and  to
relate the difference in the patient's scores in the interven-
tion period (SA-SB) to their answers on the experience of
the intervention (treatment group only). Chi-square tests
analysed  for  differences  between  completers  and  drop-
outs. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. All anal-
yses were conducted with SAS [24].

Results
There were 41 completers (68 %) in the treatment group
and  28  (93  %)  in  the  control  group.  The  scores  of  the
completers  on  self-efficacy  (GSE),  coping  strategy  (Cop-
ing Strategies Scale), and quality of life (QOLS-N) at dif-
ferent times are presented in Table 2.

There were no significant baseline differences between the
groups in any of the inventories.

For the GSE scores, the ANOVA analysis revealed no effect
of treatment during intervention (SA-SB) compared with
the  control  group  (Table  2).  However,  the  difference  in
scores between six months after intervention and before
(SSMA-SB) was significantly higher in the treatment than
in the control group, reflecting a larger increase in self-effi-
cacy for the treatment group. A similar effect was found in
the  post-treatment  period  (SSMA-SA).  Within  the  treat-
ment group there was no significant increase in self-effi-
cacy during the intervention. At six months follow-up the
GSE  scores  were  significantly  higher  than  the  baseline
(SSMA-SB = 2.6, t = 3.68, p = 0.001) and higher than at the
end of intervention (SSMA-SA = 2.2, t = 4.38, p = 0.0001).
For the control group there were no significant differences
between any of the time points.

For  the  F30-group  the  ANOVA  analysis  of  GSE  scores
showed  significance  during  the  intervention  (TF30(SA-SB)
(24.8–22.6) = 2.2, CF30(SA-SB) (25.4–27.3) = -1.9, F = 5.01,
p = 0.03), and from before to six months after (TF30(SSMA-
SB) (28.3–22.6) = 5.7, CF30(SSMA-SB) (27.3–27.3) = 0.0, F =
6.36, p = 0.01), reflecting an increased self-efficacy for the
affective  patients  in  the  treatment  group.  Within  this
patient group, GSE showed nearly significant increase in
the intervention period for the treatment group (SA-SB =
24.8–22.6  =  2.2,  t  =  2.09,  p  =  0.066),  and  significant
increases between before and six months after (SSMA-SB
=  28.3–22.6  =  5.7,  t  =  3.56,  p  =  0.006)  and  during  the
post-treatment  period  (SSMA-SA  =  28.3–24.8  =  3.5,  t  =
2.54, p = 0.03). For the control group no such change was
found. There was no significant change in scores for any
of the other diagnoses.

For the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS-N) there was no sig-
nificant  difference  in  scores  between  or  within  the  total
treatment or control groups for any periods. However, the
ANOVA analysis showed significant difference in the F30-
group  between 
intervention
(TF30(SSMA-SB)(71.9–58.5) = 13.4, CF30(SSMA-SB) (64.6–67.4)
= -2.8, F = 6.30, p = 0.01), reflecting an increase in QOLS-
N for the affective patients in the treatment group.

follow-up  and  before 

For  the  Coping  Strategies  Scale  the  ANOVA  analysis
revealed no treatment effect for any of the periods (Table
2).  However,  there  was  significant  positive  change  in
scores  for  the  treatment  group  between  before  and  six
months after (SSMA-SB = 2.7, t = 2.31, p = 0.03). For the
control  group  there  were  no  significant  differences
between any of the registration times. There were no sig-
nificant  changes  in  scores  in  any  of  the  different  diag-
noses.

Patients with the largest increase in self-efficacy during the
intervention also showed the largest increase in coping (rs
=  0.45,  p  =  0.0029).  A  similar  effect  was  also  found
between  baseline  and  six  months  after  (SSMA-SB,  rs  =
0.57,  p  =  0.0002),  and  in  the  post-treatment  period
(SSMA-SA, rs = 0.64, p < 0.0001). There were no such cor-
relations for the controls in any of the registration periods.
There were also significant correlations between the differ-
ence  in  GSE  scores  during  the  intervention  (SA-SB)  and
the  patients'  answers  related  to  the  intervention  (treat-
ment  group  only).  Patients  with  the  largest  increase  in
GSE reported the largest increase in coping ability in daily
life (rs = 0.40, p = 0.03). Similarly, the patients with the
largest  increase  in  coping  strategy  reported  the  largest
improvement  in  mood  (rs  =  0.42,  p  =  0.02),  and  they
favoured to a larger extent physical contact with the ani-
mals (rs = 0.40, p = 0.03).

The dropouts in the treatment and control group left the
project after a range of 1–6 weeks, and there were 31(75.6
%) women and 10 (24.4 %) men among the completers
in the treatment group, and 17 (60.7 %) women and 11
(39.3 %) men in the control group. The main reasons for
dropping out of the intervention was little interest in the
animal species on the farm (26.7 % answering 'very much
the reason'), that the work was boring (20 % answering
'very much'), and private reasons (26.7 % answering 'very
much').  Comparison  between  completers  and  the  drop-
outs showed significant differences between the groups in
institutional  connection,  manifested  as  higher  drop-out
among the hospitalised patients (χ2 = 13.01 p = 0.006).
There was also a higher degree of patients using sleeping
medicine among the dropouts (χ2 = 3.77 p = 0.05). There
were no other differences in medication.

Discussion
During the six months follow-up period self-efficacy was
significantly better in the treatment group, but not in the
control group. According to Bandura, self-efficacy refers to
the  expectation  that  one  can  effectively  cope  with  and
master  situations  through  one's  own  personal  efforts
[25,26].  The  finding  that  self-efficacy  was  higher  during
the six months follow-up period in the treatment but not
in the control group, could be attributed to several expla-
nations.  One  is  that  the  patients  may  have  learned  new
tasks  during  the  intervention,  and  afterwards  felt  more
self-confident. Another potential explanation is effects of
the ordinary psychiatric treatment being improved by the
AAT intervention, i.e. the AAT serving as a catalyst for pos-
itive  development  in  the  patient.  A  third  explanation  is
that  the  contact  with  the  animals  may  have  produced  a
pleasurably experienced social interaction that made the
patients less afraid of new situations, and that the effects
first appeared during the follow-up period. A similar pat-
tern was also found for coping strategy within the treat-
ment group in the period between before the intervention
and six months follow-up. A study of Ventura et al. [27]
concluded  that  psychotic  patients  who  had  greater  feel-
ings  of  self-efficacy  and  problem-focused  coping  strate-
gies, appeared to be more likely to cope with day-to-day
stressors. Our study also showed that the patients in the
treatment  group  with  the  largest  increase  in  self-efficacy
during  both  the  intervention  and  the  follow-up  period,
showed the largest increase in coping strategy in the same
periods, whereas such effects were not found for the con-
trols.  Similarly  the  patients  with  the  largest  increase  in
GSE  scores  also  reported  the  largest  increase  in  coping
ability  in  daily  life  when  relating  the  questions  to  the
intervention  experience.  Likewise,  the  patients  with  the
largest increase in coping also reported favouring physical
contact with the animals. Although there was no signifi-
cance  during  intervention,  these  findings  indicate  that
AAT  with  farm  animals  offer  a  combined  effect  of  both
contact  and  work  with  the  animals  that  have  positive
influences on the development of self-efficacy and coping
ability.

There was no effect on quality of life at any of the registra-
tion periods for the total patient group. This is in contrast
to earlier controlled studies with pets [28,29]. We found
however, as for GSE, increased quality of life among per-
sons with affective disorders. These findings indicate that
patients  in  this  diagnostic  category  profit  most  on  the
treatment. This is in accordance with the study of Antoni-
oli  and  Revely  [30]  who  found  significant  reduction  in
depression during AAT with dolphins compared with the
control group.

It is a question whether the length of the intervention in
our study was too short, or the frequency of farm visits too

low to get significant differences between the groups dur-
ing the intervention. The delayed effect in GSE and Cop-
ing Strategy Scale could indicate this, but this very effect
also indicated that the intervention with farm animals did
have some effects additional to the usual treatments.

Even  if  the  results  on  self-efficacy  and  coping  are  rather
moderate, they are positive based on the limited sample
size and the rather unspecific intervention. According to
Wilson and Barker [31], questions must be raised whether
the characteristics of the animals, the farmer, the settings
and the interaction among these variables may influence
the assessed outcomes. In addition, most of the patients
(72 %) had been treated in psychiatric health institutions
for  more  than  three  years,  which  makes  it  unlikely  to
achieve a rapid and great improvement. We found a sig-
nificantly  higher  drop-out  rate  among  the  hospitalised
patients  compared  with  the  outpatients.  This  indicates
that some inpatients were in an unstable phase. In future
studies these might have to be excluded to minimize the
drop-out rate.

The  strengths  of  this  study  are  that  it  is  the  first  rand-
omized  controlled  follow-up  design  with  farm  animals,
and that the logistics have contributed to increased coop-
eration between health institutions, therapists and farm-
ers, and made Green care more accepted among the health
professions  in  Norway.  Further  strengths  were  that  the
health outcome measures were based on validated stand-
ardized instruments, the completeness of the assessments,
and  the  relatively  moderate  drop-out  rate.  Limitations
were  the  moderate  number  of  patients  in  the  different
diagnostic categories, and the inherent inability to blind
the active treatment.

Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that AAT with farm ani-
mals  may  be  a  useful  addition  to  traditional  psychiatric
treatment,  particularly  for  patients  with  affective  disor-
ders. Self-efficacy was higher at follow-up compared with
baseline  and  at  the  end  of  the  intervention  in  the  treat-
ment  group  but  not  in  the  control  group.  The  patients
with the highest increase in self-efficacy during interven-
tion reported the largest increase in coping ability. Further
controlled  studies  are  needed  for  confirmation  and  to
more accurately define the treatment parameters and the
psychiatric population with the greatest potential of ben-
efiting from an intervention with farm animals.
