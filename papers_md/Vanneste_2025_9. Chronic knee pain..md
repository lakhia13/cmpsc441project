Abstract
Introduction:  Chronic  knee  pain  is  defined  as  pain  that  persists  or  recurs  over 
3 months.  The  most  common  is  degenerative  osteoarthritis  (OA).  This  review 
represents a comprehensive description of the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment 
of OA of the knee.
Methods: The literature on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic knee pain was 
retrieved  and  summarized.  A  modified  Delphi  approach  was  used  to  formulate 
recommendations on interventional treatments.
Results: Patients with knee OA commonly present with insidious, chronic knee pain 
that gradually worsens. Pain caused by knee OA is predominantly nociceptive pain, 
with occasional nociplastic and infrequent neuropathic characteristics occurring 
in a diseased knee. A standard musculoskeletal and neurological examination is 
required for the diagnosis of knee OA. Although typical clinical OA findings are 
sufficient for diagnosis, medical imaging may be performed to improve specificity. 
The  differential  diagnosis  should  exclude  other  causes  of  knee  pain  including 
bone  and  joint  disorders  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  spondylo-   and  other

arthropathies,  and  infections.  When  conservative  treatment  fails,  intra- articular 
injections of corticosteroids and radiofrequency (conventional and cooled) of the 
genicular nerves have been shown to be effective. Hyaluronic acid infiltrations are 
conditionally recommended. Platelet- rich plasma infiltrations, chemical ablation 
of  genicular  nerves,  and  neurostimulation  have,  at  the  moment,  not  enough 
evidence and can be considered in a study setting. The decision to perform joint- 
preserving and joint- replacement options should be made multidisciplinary.
Conclusions: When conservative measures fail to provide satisfactory pain relief, 
a  multidisciplinary  approach  is  recommended  including  psychological  therapy, 
integrative treatments, and procedural options such as intra- articular injections, 
radiofrequency ablation, and surgery.

This narrative review on chronic knee pain 
is part of a series “Update of evidence- based 
interventional  pain  medicine  according  to 
clinical diagnoses.”

Chronic knee pain is defined as knee pain that persists 
or  recurs  for  more  than  3 months.1  The  most  common 
cause of chronic knee pain is degenerative osteoarthritis 
(OA).2–4  Other  etiologies  of  knee  pain  include  rheuma-
toid arthritis, crystal and spondylo- arthropathies, post- 
traumatic pain, and persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP). 
Discussion of all these conditions is beyond the scope of 
this narrative review, and we will focus on a comprehen-
sive  description  of  the  pathology,  diagnosis,  and  treat-
ment of OA of the knee. Special attention will be given 
to minimally invasive interventional treatments of knee 
pain due to OA, how they are performed, and their com-
plications. Based on the discussed literature, recommen-
dations are formulated for these treatment techniques.

OA  is  a  degenerative  condition  that  causes  progres-
sive loss of articular cartilage and remodeling of the un-
derlying  bone,  fibrocartilage,  and  synovium.3  OA  can 
affect any joint, with the knee being the most common 
site in many studies.5–7 OA is a leading cause of disabil-
ity,  with  its  prevalence  increasing  worldwide.4,8–10  OA 
can  affect  all  thee  compartments  of  the  knee  joint:  the 
medial  tibiofemoral,  the  lateral  tibiofemoral,  and  the 
patellofemoral compartment.11,12 Pathogenesis of OA re-
sults from an interplay of biomechanical, inflammatory, 
and metabolic factors that contribute to cartilage dam-
age, synovitis, and various subchondral bone abnormal-
ities.11–15  The  global  prevalence  of  knee  OA  is  16.0%  in 
individuals aged 15 and older and 22.9% in individuals 
aged 40 and older. The global incidence of knee OA was 
203 per 10,000 person- years in individuals aged 20 and 
older.7 Both the prevalence and incidence increase with 
age.11 Knee pain, functional loss, and the accompanying 
psychological burden may lead to substantial disability 

and major socio- economic costs, which were estimated 
at  over  $140,000  per  person  in  the  United  States  in 
2013.16–19 Risk factors of OA include advanced age (espe-
cially those >55 years), obesity, female sex, previous knee 
injury,  and  occupational  factors.8,11  The  10%–15%  are 
attributed to trauma.20 The incidence of knee OA is ex-
pected to increase because of the aging of the population 
and an increase in obesity.10,11,21 Around 50% of the pop-
ulation  first  diagnosed  with  symptomatic  knee  OA  are 
estimated  to  eventually  undergo  surgical  treatment  in 
the form of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) which com-
prises the highest percentage of direct medical costs.11,22 
Between 10% and 35% of patients undergoing TKA ex-
perience  persistent  pain,  with  15%  reporting  that  pain 
has a high impact.23–28

M ET HOD OL OGY

The  paper  includes  peer- reviewed  literature  found  by 
a  search  conducted  in  February  2024  using  the  terms 
“knee” AND “pain” AND “osteoarthritis” in PubMed 
and  Cochrane  databases  (Cochrane  Central  Register 
of Controlled Trials; Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews). Only studies pertaining to chronic knee pain 
were included. Since this is the first review of interven-
tional  pain  medicine  on  chronic  knee  pain,  there  were 
no limitations in the time frame for the literature search, 
and  all  types  of  original  studies  (randomized  and  non- 
randomized trials, prospective and observational trials, 
and  case  series  and  case  reports)  and  reviews  were  in-
cluded.  Based  on  this  initial  search,  the  main  domains 
relevant to the topic were identified. Afterward, multiple 
searches were performed based on the selected domains 
(eg, prevalence, diagnosis, pharmacological treatments, 
and interventional treatments). The literature search on 
interventional  pain  management  techniques  included 
the  following  terms:  “Intra- articular  corticosteroid  in-
jections”  OR  ((“steroid”  OR  “corticosteroid”)  AND 
“injection”);  “Intra- articular  hyaluronic  acid  injection” 

CHRONIC KNEE PAIN 
 
OR  ((“hyaluronic”  OR  “hyaluronic  acid”  OR  “visco-
supplementation”)  AND  “injection”);  “Intra- articular 
injections  with  platelet  rich  plasma”  OR  (“platelet  rich 
plasma”  AND  “injection”);  (“radiofrequency”  OR 
“pulsed  radiofrequency”  OR  “conventional  radiofre-
quency” OR “cooled radiofrequency”) AND “genicular 
nerves”;  (“chemical  ablation”  OR  “phenol”  OR  “alco-
hol”  OR  “neurolysis”)  AND  “genicular  nerves.”  The 
initial  literature  search  and  screening  of  articles  were 
performed by two authors AB and TV. In addition to the 
literature search, the included papers were screened for 
relevant articles and the authors of the manuscript pro-
posed  other  important  missing  articles.  The  data  were 
gathered and summarized per specific domain.

The  group  of  authors  included  in  this  paper  then 
determined  whether  each  intervention  should  be  rec-
ommended  or  not.  The  author  team  was  chosen  based 
on their expertise in the topic of chronic knee pain and 
consists  of  anesthetists  and  surgeons  with  broad  in-
ternational  representation.  Based  on  the  summarized 
data, a table with each recommendation was composed 
together  with  a  treatment  algorithm  for  chronic  knee 
pain. The possible grades of recommendation were “not 
recommended,”  “not  enough  evidence  for  recommen-
dation outside of a study setting,” “conditionally recom-
mended,” “recommended,” and “highly recommended.” 
These recommendations were based on a critical evalua-
tion of the literature focusing on the quality of the trials, 
the relevance of the intervention to the current clinical 
practice, the balance between the invasiveness of the in-
tervention and the effect size, and the balance between 
the  risk  of  adverse  events  and  the  effect  size  of  the  in-
tervention. These recommendations were sent to the au-
thor  team  for  review  and  a  modified  Delphi  approach 
was used to achieve consensus.29 This included multiple 
rounds of comments via email followed by video meet-
ings.  During  the  video  meetings,  the  comments  were 
addressed, disagreements resolved, and a consensus was 
forged. This same process was repeated for the technique 
section. Finally, the manuscript for publication was pre-
pared and submitted to the author team for approval.

History

Patients  with  knee  OA  commonly  present  with  insidi-
ous, chronic knee pain that is gradually worsening. Pain 
caused  by  knee  OA  is  predominantly  nociceptive  with 
nociplastic  characteristics  occurring  in  approximately 
35% of patients, and neuropathic qualities occasionally 
present  in  severely  diseased  knees.11,30  Although  pain 
is  the  most  prominent  symptom,  patients  with  OA  can 
experience  reduced  knee  function,  muscle  weakness, 
morning  stiffness,  joint  instability,  and  psychological 
distress. Knee pain due to OA is usually mechanical and 

|  3 of 21

worsens  with  activity  due  to  the  weight- bearing  capac-
ity of the joint.31,32 While pain may be absent during the 
early stages, symptomatic OA pain is typically described 
as sharp and fluctuating depending on the activity level. 
Moderate  knee  OA  is  often  described  as  constant  pain 
and joint stiffness that affect daily activities. Severe knee 
OA can result in significant disability, function restric-
tion, and decreased quality of life. Patients often report 
flare- ups for up to 72 h that include swelling, increased 
warmth,  worsening  pain,  and  functional  limitations.33 
Burning  electrical  pain,  paresthesia,  hypoesthesia,  hy-
peralgesia,  and  allodynia  over  the  diseased  joint  are 
all  characteristics  of  nociplastic  and  occasionally  neu-
ropathic  pain.  Multiple  joint  pain,  morning  stiffness 
that  lasts  longer  than  30 min  and  other  accompanying 
systemic  symptoms  in  a  patient  with  knee  pain  should 
prompt  a  rheumatology  consultation  to  rule  out  rheu-
matoid arthritis and other arthropathies. Other red flags 
such as fever, a history of trauma, osteoporosis, cancer, 
deep vein thrombosis, or peripheral vascular disease can 
point toward a serious differential diagnosis and require 
further investigations and imaging.

Physical examination

A standard musculoskeletal and neurological examina-
tion is required for the diagnosis of knee OA.34,35 A com-
parison  of  the  diseased  knee  to  the  contralateral  knee 
facilitates  examination.  First,  the  appearance  of  the 
knee  is  inspected  for  redness,  edema,  muscle  atrophy, 
and trophic changes. Mild warmth, edema, and redness 
are  compatible  with  OA  while  marked  signs  of  inflam-
mation should prompt tests for infectious or inflamma-
tory arthritis.31 Second, the flexed knee is palpated for 
bony  enlargements,  crepitus,  and  tenderness  along  the 
joint  line,  patella,  tibial  and  femoral  condyles,  fibular 
head, and tibial tuberosity. Patients should be evaluated 
for  the  presence  of  knee  joint  effusion  in  a  maximally 
extended knee. The following extra- articular knee com-
partments  should  also  be  examined  and  palpated:  the 
quadriceps  tendon,  the  patellar  tendon,  the  iliotibial 
band  on  the  lateral  side  of  the  knee,  and  the  posterior 
knee fossa. Pain where the iliotibial band crosses the lat-
eral  knee  is  characteristic  of  iliotibial  band  syndrome, 
especially in runners. Discomfort at the popliteal fossa 
could indicate the presence of popliteal cysts (eg, Baker's 
cyst).  Tenderness  around  the  knee  could  also  indicate 
the presence of inflamed bursae, the most important of 
which are the supra- , pre- , and infra- patellar bursa and 
the  bursa  surrounding  the  pes  anserine.  Third,  the  pa-
tient's gait, standing and walking knee alignment (varus 
and valgus), active and passive range of motion, and sta-
bility of the knee joint are evaluated. Examinations used 
to  assess  joint  stability  are  the  valgus  and  varus  stress 
tests that evaluate medial and lateral instability respec-
tively; the Lachman test; and the anterior and posterior

drawer  tests  to  assess  anterior  and  posterior  knee  sta-
bility  problems  due  to  anterior  and  posterior  cruciate 
ligament  injuries.  A  knee  compression- rotation  test  is 
used to detect damaged meniscus. In general, the medial 
compartment tends to deteriorate faster than the patel-
lofemoral and lateral compartments absent asymmetri-
cal stressors (eg, valgus deformity predisposing to lateral 
compartment OA).36

It is important that radicular pain is excluded as the 
cause  of  the  knee  pain.  Radicular  pain  resulting  from 
compression of the L3, L4, and L5 spinal nerve roots can 
result in anterior (or lateral for L5 radiculopathies) knee 
pain while S1 and S2 nerve root compression can lead to 
posterior knee pain. Evaluation of the patellar reflex and 
the femoral stretch test can determine the integrity of the 
L3 and L4 nerve roots.37 Allodynia and hypoesthesia to 
touch and prick of the knee should be also evaluated to 
identify  neuropathic  pain.  Questionnaires  such  as  the 
Douleur  neuropathique  4  (DN4)  and  PainDETECT 
questionnaire can be used to determine the probability 
of non- nociceptive pain.30 Due to changes in gait biome-
chanics, other (extra- articular) structures such as the at-
tachment of the patella tendon and hamstring muscles at 
the tibia can become painful due to relative overuse re-
sulting from altered locomotion.38 Lastly, trophic, sudo-
motor, vasomotor, or sensory changes in the joint should 
raise the possibility of complex regional pain syndrome 
(CRPS).39

Technical investigations

A  diagnosis  of  knee  OA  does  not  require  radiography. 
The  American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  out-
lines  three  different  means  to  diagnose  knee  OA.  The 
use of history and physical exam alone requires chronic 
knee pain and at least three of the following criteria: age 
>50 years, <30 min morning stiffness, crepitus with mo-
tion,  bony  tenderness,  bony  enlargement,  and  no  pal-
pable  synovial  warmth.  This  is  the  most  sensitive  way 
to  diagnose  knee  OA,  but  the  least  specific  (sensitivity 
95% and specificity 69%). The addition of radiographic 
abnormalities (eg, subchondral sclerosis) to history and 
physical  requires  pain  in  the  knee,  osteophytes,  and  at 
least one of the following: age >50 years, <30 min morn-
ing  stiffness,  and  crepitus  with  motion.  This  method 
only  slightly  reduces  the  sensitivity  to  91%  but  signifi-
cantly improves the specificity to 86%. Finally, combin-
ing history and physical exam with labs (eg, erythrocyte 
sedimentation  rate  <40 mm/h,  rheumatoid  factor  <1:40, 
and synovial fluid signs consistent with OA provides an 
intermediate sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 75%, 
respectively).40

As noted above, typical clinical OA findings are suf-
ficient  for  diagnosis  according  to  the  ACR  diagnostic 
criteria  and  EURLAR  recommendations  for  diagno-
sis  of  knee  OA.31,40,41  Whereas  disease  modification  is 

probably  only  possible  at  early  stages  of  OA,  because 
patients  often  experience  minimal  symptoms  at  this 
time, the ACR diagnostic criteria are frequently not suf-
ficiently sensitive to detect all cases of knee pain second-
ary to degenerative etiologies.42 The diagnosis of OA is 
more reliable if more affirmative signs of OA are pres-
ent.43 These include risk factors, symptoms, and physical 
examination. Additional testing in the form of imaging 
(radiography,  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  and 
bone scintigraphy), laboratory testing and synovial fluid 
analysis  should  be  considered  in  young  patients  with 
symptoms of OA, knee joint instability, recent traumatic 
event,  persistent  post- operative  pain,  systemic  symp-
toms, and when there is a need to rule out joint infection, 
inflammatory arthritis, or malignancy.41

Knee  radiography,  the  gold  standard  imaging  for 
knee  OA,  can  identify  the  affected  knee  compartment: 
medial  or  lateral  tibiofemoral  (weight- bearing)  arthro-
sis  and  patellofemoral  arthrosis.  Based  on  radiologic 
findings, the severity of tibiofemoral arthrosis is graded 
using  the  Kellgren–Lawrence  (KL)  grading  scale  from 
0  to  IV.44  KL  grade  I  indicates  minimal  radiological 
findings of OA while KL grade IV indicates severe OA 
with  large  osteophytes,  marked  narrowing  of  the  joint 
space,  severe  sclerosis,  and  definite  deformity  of  bone 
ends. Radiographic changes become more common after 
1–2 years of symptoms.45,46 Compared to plain radiogra-
phy, MRI has a higher sensitivity for identifying earlier 
stages of OA that include only cartilage defects and sub-
chondral bone lesions, and as such might aid in the early 
detection of knee OA.31,47

It is widely assumed that treatments such as lifestyle 
changes  or  efforts  aimed  at  reducing  load  bearing  and 
improving  gait  mechanics  such  as  kinesiotaping  are 
mainly useful at an early stage of OA when there is no 
or little pain, in an attempt to modify the disease course. 
From this perspective, there is an ongoing discussion on 
the  function  of  pain  as  a  protective  mechanism  to  off-
load mechanical burdens and prevent further structural 
damage.  If  a  treatment  adequately  reduces  pain,  this 
could theoretically lead to an increased rate of structural 
degeneration. However, aside from extreme levels of ac-
tivities  that  unduly  stress  the  knee  joint,  studies  have 
consistently found that higher activity levels either have 
no significant effect or in the case of otherwise sedentary 
patients,  possibly  a  protective  effect  on  radiographic 
joint degeneration.48 Further research is still needed to 
explore the effects of physical activity versus a sedentary 
lifestyle on pain.49

Radiographic changes in the knee should be carefully 
interpreted as knee symptoms tend to exhibit a poor- to- 
moderate  correlation  with  the  severity  of  radiograph-
ically  observed  joint  alterations.47  The  proportion  of 
patients with knee pain suffering from radiographically- 
confirmed OA ranges between 15% and 76%, with 15%–
81%  of  patients  with  radiographically- confirmed  knee 
OA experiencing knee pain.50 In one systematic review,

most but not all studies, found a positive correlation be-
tween effusion and synovitis and knee pain, with another 
study finding that up to 25% of patients with KL grade 
IV did not experience knee pain.51,52

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of chronic knee pain depends 
largely  on  clinical  presentation,  medical  history,  imag-
ing, and sometimes labs. Knee OA can be divided into 
primary  and  secondary  OA.  Whereas  primary  OA  is  a 
result  of  idiopathic  degenerative  processes,  secondary 
OA  occurs  secondary  to  trauma,  and  other  bone  and 
joint  disorders  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  arthropa-
thies, and infections.41 Post- traumatic knee pain is pre-
ceded  by  trauma  which  can  be  acute,  prolonged  over 
extended periods (eg, distance runners), and occur sec-
ondary to an acute traumatic event that predisposes the 
knee to increased stress and motion (eg, ligamentous and 
meniscal  injuries).  When  preceded  or  accompanied  by 
trauma, surgery, or an intervention, CRPS may ensue.39 
Radicular back pain is characterized by pain involving a 
specific dermatome and typically occurs with concomi-
tant sensory and/ or motor deficits.

Differential diagnosis of chronic knee pain:

•  OA

○ Primary OA
○ Secondary  OA:  OA  enhanced  by  other  factors 
such  as  trauma,  other  bone  and  joint  disorders 
such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  arthropathies,  and 
infections22

○ Patella malposition or mal- tracking53
○ Malalignment
○ Post- meniscectomy pain (degenerative or traumatic)
○ Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)

•  Persistent post- surgical knee pain

○ Mechanical problems (eg, prothesis malalignment, 
mal- sizing,  component  dislodgement,  peripros-
thetic fractures, and ligament instability)

○ Joint infection
○ Inappropriate surgery (eg, joint replacement when 

OA was not the primary cause)

○ Inflammatory  or  allergic  response  to  implanted 

material (metal allergy)

○ Nociplastic pain
○ Neuropathic pain (eg, due to surgical damage to the 

infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve)

○ CRPS
○ Idiopathic

•  Post- traumatic knee pain

○  Fracture
○ Soft tissue trauma and peri- articular disorders (eg, 
ligament tear, meniscal tear, and cartilage defect)

•  Referred knee pain
○ Radicular pain

•  Crystal arthropathy (eg, gout)
•  Malignant knee pain

T R E AT M E N T OP T ION S

The treatment of knee OA should be comprehensive and 
multimodal.  A  combination  of  education,  physiother-
apy, weight management, and medical treatment is indi-
cated for most OA patients.41,54–56 Treatment of knee OA 
is  primarily  symptomatic,  aimed  at  relieving  pain  and 
improving functionality.56 The importance of changes in 
lifestyle, self- efficacy, and a proactive approach to knee 
pain should be stressed. Minimally invasive treatments 
such  as  intra- articular  infiltrations  or  nerve  treatment 
are indicated when the previously mentioned approaches 
are  insufficient.  Surgical  interventions  should  be  per-
formed  when  symptoms  are  refractory  to  conservative 
treatment.57,58 We will further discuss pharmacological 
therapies,  and  the  five  minimally  invasive  treatments 
with the most supporting literature in knee OA: the intra- 
articular  injection  of  corticosteroids,  intra- articular 
injection  of  hyaluronic  acid,  intra- articular  injection 
of  platelet- rich  plasma,  radiofrequency  treatment,  and 
chemical  ablation  of  the  genicular  nerves.  We  will  dis-
cuss evidence of treatments from systematic reviews and 
results  from  distinguished  individual  trials  addressing 
important  clinical  topics  when  aggregated  data  in  sys-
tematic reviews is lacking.

Treatment of chronic knee OA can be 
classified into

1.  Conservative  treatment
1.1.  Non- interventional

1.1.1.  Non- pharmacological (education, physiother-
apy, braces, dietary weight management, life-
style changes, kinesiotaping, and cranes)
1.1.2.  Pharmacological (NSAIDs, paracetamol, du-
loxetine, tramadol, and topical capsaicin)

1.2.  Minimally invasive interventional management
1.2.1.  Pharmacological intra- articular infiltrations

1.2.1.1.   Intra- articular  corticosteroid  injection 

(IACS)

1.2.1.2.   Intra- articular  hyaluronic  acid  injec-

tion (IAHA)

1.2.1.3.   Intra- articular  injection  with  platelet- 

rich plasma (PRP)

tion (prolotherapy), and ozone)

Conservative management

Non- pharmacological care

Non- pharmacological  care  is  considered  essential  to 
all  OA  patients.  Patients  should  be  educated  on  dis-
ease pathology, progression, and treatment modalities. 
Physiotherapy  in  the  form  of  structured  land- based 
exercise  programs,  aquatic  exercise  which  mitigates 
the  effect  of  gravity  and  may  be  particularly  ben-
eficial  in  overweight  patients,  use  of  gait  aids,  and 
self- management  programs  are  considered  safe  and 
efficacious. A Cochrane systematic review comparing 
the  effect  of  land- based  therapeutic  exercise  with  dif-
ferent comparators in OA patients showed that exercise 
significantly  diminishes  pain  and  improves  physical 
function  in  the  intermediate  term  without  additional 
harm  or  accelerated  disease  progression.59  While  the 
importance of non- pharmacological care is supported 
by  scientific  research  and  expert  opinion,  the  imple-
mentation of education, physiotherapy, weight loss, and 
self- management programs in clinical practice is often 
suboptimal.60 Nationwide initiatives on neuromuscular 
exercise  such  as  the  Good  Life  with  osteoArthritis  in 
Denmark (GLA:D) can improve pain and quality of life 
of knee OA patients.61 Transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation (TENS) is another non- invasive technique 
that could be considered in some knee OA patients with 
neuropathic- like or nociplastic symptoms; however, the 
level of evidence is low.62

Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacological  treatments  are  deemed  suitable  for 
most OA patients; however, attention should be paid to 
patients  with  comorbidities  due  to  possible  adverse  ef-
fects,  drug  interactions,  and  complications.  Topical  or 
oral  non- inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  and  paraceta-
mol  are  first- line  pharmacological  treatments  for  knee 
OA.  The  effect  of  NSAIDs  is  superior  to  paracetamol 
with a number needed- to- treat (NNT) of between 4.5 and 
9.8  for  topical  and  oral  NSAIDs  and  4  ONSAID16  for 
paracetamol.63–65 Cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors or topical 
NSAIDs  can  be  used  in  patients  suffering  from  frailty, 
and gastrointestinal comorbidities due to fewer adverse 

effects.55,56,63 Duloxetine is the only anti- depressant that 
is  recommended  as  a  second- line  treatment  for  knee 
OA.66,67  However,  other  antidepressants  can  be  con-
sidered  in  patients  with  depressive  symptoms  or  wide-
spread pain disorders after careful patient selection, with 
tricyclic  antidepressants  having  greater  efficacy,  albeit 
with more side effects, than serotonin- specific reuptake 
inhibitors.54,66  Topical  capsaicin  can  be  considered  de-
spite  studies  reporting  a  small  effect  size.54  High  doses 
of pure mu agonists should only be considered for non- 
malignant knee pain on a case- to- case basis after care-
fully  weighing  the  risks  and  benefits,  with  predefined 
benchmarks  for  success  and  an  exit  strategy.68  Mixed- 
action opioids such as tramadol can be considered, but 
there is moderate- quality evidence that tramadol has no 
important benefit on pain due to OA.54,69 Glucosamine, 
chondroitin,  and  biologicals  (eg,  anti- NGF/TNF  anti-
body therapy) are not recommended for use in patients 
with knee OA.54,70 Presently, no disease- modifying drugs 
are approved for OA.54,70

Interventional pain management

Intra- articular corticosteroid injections (IACS)

Intra- articular (IA) injections with corticosteroids have 
been extensively used in knee OA for over 50 years and 
should  be  considered  when  the  previously  mentioned 
treatments are exhausted. Corticosteroids, being strong 
anti- inflammatory  agents,  are  hypothesized  to  reverse 
intra- articular (synovial) and extra- articular inflamma-
tion involving the degenerative joint, especially during an 
OA  flare.71  Corticosteroids  available  for  intra- articular 
injection are present in a crystalline and non- crystalline 
form. The most frequently used corticosteroids and their 
corresponding dosage are the crystalline triamcinolone 
20–40 mg,  the  non- crystalline  prednisolone  50 mg,  and 
methylprednisolone 40–120 mg.

IACS  injections  are  shown  to  be  more  effective 
for  pain  reduction  and  improvement  in  functionality 
compared  to  placebo  or  no  intervention  in  knee  OA 
according to three recent systematic reviews and meta- 
analyses.72–74  The  effect  size  is  small  to  moderate  with 
a  peak  effect  occurring  around  2–4 weeks  depending 
on  the  formulation.71  The  NNT  for  IACS  injection  in 
knee OA ranges from 8 to 10.72,73 The duration of the ef-
fect  of  IACS  seems  to  be  limited  to  the  short- term,  as 
a meta- analysis found no analgesic effect at 6 months.72 
Compared  to  active  treatment  with  IA  hyaluronic  acid 
or  physiotherapy,  IACS  injections  showed  no  statisti-
cally  significant  effect  6 weeks  after  treatment  in  knee 
OA patients.74 Recurrent IACS do not provide additional 
symptom relief compared with other injectables at mid-  
and  long- term  follow- up.75  Concomitant  injection  with 
viscosupplementation or local anesthetics has not been 
shown to increase the effect of the treatment, though the 

CHRONIC KNEE PAIN 
 
 
addition  of  corticosteroids  to  hyaluronic  acid  has  been 
shown  in  multiple  studies  to  be  superior  to  hyaluronic 
acid alone.72,76,77 A higher equivalent dose than 40 mg of 
methylprednisolone  does  not  increase  the  treatment  ef-
fect.72  Repeated  injections  have  been  shown  in  clinical 
trials to decrease cartilage volume.78 There is insufficient 
data to advise the use of a specific short- acting or long- 
acting corticosteroid preparation.

Intra- articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) 
injection

Hyaluronic  acid  (HA)  is  a  non- sulfated  glycosami-
noglycan  that  is  an  important  component  of  healthy 
articular  cartilage  and  synovial  fluid.3,79  The  hypoth-
esized  mechanism  of  action  of  viscosupplementation 
is through anti- inflammatory, anabolic, analgesic, and 
chondroprotective  mechanisms;  however,  the  physi-
ological effect of HA has not been fully elucidated.71,79 
Injection of IAHA could improve pain and joint func-
tion  by  increasing  lubrication  during  articulation  and 
restoring  the  viscoelasticity  of  synovial  hyaluronan.70 
Viscosupplements  are  available  in  different  formu-
lations  (hyaluronan  and  hylan),  different  molecular 
weights  (high  [>1.5  million  Da]  and  low  molecular 
weights,  and  in  different  molecular  structures  [linear, 
cross- linked,  or  both]).80  Despite  conflicting  clinical 
results, differences in HA molecular weight are hypoth-
esized to result in differences in biological activity, with 
high molecular IAHA generally favored.81,82 Although 
a growing trend is to perform a single IAHA injection, 
injection schedules per patient reported in studies vary 
from 1 to 5 injections.71

The clinical effect of IAHA in knee OA is controver-
sial.  Two  meta- analyses  comparing  viscosupplementa-
tion  to  placebo  or  no  intervention  showed  a  small  and 
non- clinically  meaningful  benefit  for  IAHA  with  an 
increased  risk  of  adverse  events,  while  another  meta- 
analysis  found  significant  improvement  for  pain  and 
function  compared  to  placebo  up  to  24 weeks.83–85  A 
meta- analysis  comparing  IAHA  with  IACS  reported  a 
stronger effect for IACS up to 4 weeks, equal efficacy at 
4–8 weeks, and higher efficacy of IAHA past 8 weeks. A 
network  meta- analysis  of  different  treatments  for  knee 
OA reported that IAHA leads to statistically significant 
improvement  in  pain  and  that  IAHA  was  more  effec-
tive than all conservative knee OA treatments including 
IACS.86  The  systematic  reviews  should  be  viewed  with 
caution as most of the included trials were found to have 
low  methodological  quality,  high  heterogeneity,  and 
were sponsored by industry.87 If effective, IAHA reaches 
its  peak  effect  at  4–8 weeks  and  the  effect  is  detectable 
until 24 weeks.84 Regarding repeated IAHA injections, a 
study by Ha et al.88 comparing a single to three IAHA in-
jections in knee OA resulted in non- inferiority of a single 
IAHA. When IAHA injections are effective, how long to 

|  7 of 21

continue these injections in clinical practice is unknown. 
When comparing low-  and high- molecular weight IAHA 
injections,  subgroup  analyses  in  systematic  reviews  are 
inconclusive. In a randomized, double- blind study com-
paring low-  and high- molecular weight IAHA injections, 
Gigis et al.89 reported that both lead to similar symptom 
reduction. A systematic review of 7 RCTs and 10 cohort 
studies  examined  the  effect  of  repeat  IAHA  injections. 
The  number  of  injections  per  treatment  course  varied 
from 1 to 5, with the number of repeat courses also rang-
ing from 1 to 5 and follow- up periods varying between 26 
and  174 weeks.  All  studies  showed  significant  improve-
ment in pain after the first course of HA. After a repeat 
injection  series,  pain  reduction  remained  significant 
compared to baseline.90 The high degree of heterogene-
ity between studies should be considered when interpret-
ing  these  results.  The  long- term  follow- up  of  knee  OA 
patients  treated  with  IAHA  does  not  indicate  evidence 
for acceleration of knee OA progression, but future stud-
ies  should  address  the  potential  for  disease- modifying 
effects.87

Intra- articular injections with 
platelet- rich plasma

Platelet- rich plasma (PRP) is a highly concentrated vol-
ume  of  platelets  derived  from  centrifugation  of  autolo-
gous  blood.  Both  plasma  and  platelets  in  PRP  contain 
growth  factors  that  can  aid  healing  and  tissue  regen-
eration.91,92  PRP  can  be  prepared  by  different  methods 
(single- spinning  method,  double- spinning  method,  or 
selective blood filtration). Based on the leukocyte and fi-
brin content, PRP is classified into pure PRP, leukocyte- 
rich  PRP,  pure  platelet- rich  fibrin,  and  leukocyte-   and 
platelet- rich  fibrin.91  Although  some  leukocytes  can 
secrete  growth  cytokines,  IA- injected  leucocytes  can 
also  increase  oxidative  stress  and  inflammation,  miti-
gating  any  clinical  effect.93  The  PRP  solution  can  also 
be exogenously activated. IA PRP is on average injected 
three  times  with  1,  2  or  3 weeks  intervals  separating 
treatments.94

Evidence  for  the  clinical  effect  of  IA  PRP  infiltra-
tions  is  mixed.  Compared  to  placebo  or  no  treatment, 
two  systematic  reviews  reported  a  significant  positive 
effect  on  pain.94,95  When  compared  to  hyaluronic  acid, 
there is moderate evidence that PRP is more effective for 
pain and function than IAHA.94–99 Four systematic re-
views found that PRP might be more effective in reduc-
ing pain and function for up to 9 months compared with 
IACS.95,99–101  Although  the  aforementioned  research 
tended to show favorable results for IA PRP, it must be 
noted  that  the  quality  of  data  is  low,  and  the  included 
studies  exhibited  extensive  heterogeneity.  No  knee  OA 
guideline currently recommends PRP.

The heterogeneity of the studies is evident in the vol-
ume  of  plasma  injected,  method  of  PRP  preparation, 

VANNESTE et al.

use  of  exogenous  PRP  activation,  and  frequency  of 
injections.  A  direct  comparison  between  single-   ver-
sus  double- spinned  PRP  by  Filardo  et  al.102  showed 
no  statistical  difference  between  preparation  meth-
ods.  Despite  an  absence  of  randomized,  comparative- 
effectiveness studies, systematic reviews have concluded 
that  exogenously- activated  PRP  is  more  effective  than 
non- activated PRP,103 and that leukocyte- poor PRP may 
be superior to leukocyte- rich PRP for knee OA.96 A sys-
tematic review that evaluated cartilage  degeneration in 
knee OA patients up to 12 months after PRP treatment 
concluded  that  PRP  does  not  result  in  disease  modifi-
cation  or  an  increase  in  degeneration  compared  to  the 
expected OA progression.99,104,105 There is no substantial 
evidence  that  simultaneous  injection  of  PRP  with  hy-
aluronic  acid  or  mesenchymal  stem  cells  improves  the 
clinical effect.106–111 There is corroborating evidence that 
multiple  PRP  injections  may  be  more  beneficial  than  a 
single injection.92,112

Radiofrequency of genicular nerves

Radiofrequency  (RF)  treatment  of  the  genicular  nerves 
aims  to  interrupt  pain  signal  transmission  from  the  sen-
sory  genicular  nerves  by  means  of  a  thermal  lesion.113,114 
RF treatment can be performed using three main different 
RF  modalities:  conventional  RF  with  various  iterations 

intended  to  enhance  lesion  size,  cooled  RF,  and  pulsed 
RF.  In  bipolar  RF,  symmetrically  placed  electrodes  are 
positioned around the targeted area. Both electrodes serve 
as a conduit for electrical current which results in larger le-
sions when compared to conventional RF.115 The targeted 
genicular  nerves  are  branches  of  the  femoral,  obturator, 
and sciatic nerves that innervate the anterior part of the 
knee. The superomedial, the superolateral, and the infero-
medial  genicular  nerve  are  the  traditional  targets  of  RF 
treatment based on the inaugural sham- controlled trial by 
Choi  et  al.  There  is  an  ongoing  discussion  as  to  whether 
targeting more nerves could increase outcomes as there are 
over  10  sensory  nerves  supplying  nociceptive  input  from 
the  anterior  knee  joint.116–119  Figures  1  and  2  display  the 
anatomical variations of the genicular nerves that inner-
vate the anterior knee and possible targets for the RF pro-
cedure for each nerve.

When  results  from  all  clinical  studies  are  evalu-
ated, regardless of the RFA modality employed, suc-
cessful outcomes have been reported in between 30% 
and 74% of OA patients at 6 months.120–126 When RF 
of the genicular nerves is compared to intra- articular 
injections  in  knee  OA,  the  results  from  systematic 
reviews  are  contradictory.  One  reported  the  prob-
ability  of  benefit  after  RF  to  be  4.5  times  higher 
compared  to  IACS  and  1.8  times  higher  compared 
to  IAHA,  while  another  showed  no  significant  dif-
ference in effect between IA injections, RF ablation,

and  genicular  artery  embolization.125,127  There  seem 
to be differences in the efficacy between the three RF 
modalities.  Conventional  RF  treatment  was  shown 
to  be  superior  to  pulsed  RF  in  OA  knee  pain  in  an 
RCT, which is consistent with comparisons for other 
joints.128,129 Studies suggest that cooled RF may pro-
vide advantages over conventional RF but the incre-
mental  benefit  is  small.  Cooled  RF,  which  creates 
larger  lesions  and  thus  a  greater  likelihood  of  accu-
rate  denervation,  could  theoretically  produce  better 
and more prolonged pain relief compared to conven-
tional RF based on a large cohort study.130 The same 
study  also  demonstrated  that  larger  needle  size  and 
thus  larger  lesion  size  was  associated  with  longer 
pain relief. Conversely, although cooled RF provided 
better  symptom  control  in  a  pilot  RCT  in  patients 
with  persistent  postsurgical  pain,  it  did  not  provide 
meaningfully  better  outcomes  in  OA  patients.131,132 
More  studies  are  needed  to  support  the  routine  use 
of the more expensive and resource- intensive cooled 
RF technique.

Concerning the number of  targeted nerves, there is a 
theoretical  advantage  of   lesioning  more  than  3  nerves. 
Most studies up to now targeted three traditional genic-
ular nerves, but there are studies that advocate targeting 
more  nerves.133  Three  retrospective  studies  examining 
factors  associated  with  outcome  demonstrated  that 
greater  KL  grade,  not  being  on  opioids  and  adjuvant 

analgesics,  not  having  psychiatric  co- morbidities,  and 
targeting  more  than  3  nerves  foreshadowed  positive 
RFA  outcomes.117,134,135  Furthermore,  the  study  by 
Malaithong  et  al.115  found  no  significant  differences 
up  to  12 months  between  the  group  that  received  local 
anesthetic  and  steroid  injections  with  sham- RFA  and 
the group with local anesthetic and steroid plus bipolar- 
RFA  targeting  three  genicular  nerves.  Both  groups  ex-
perienced  significant  reductions  in  pain.  It  should  be 
noted  that,  unlike  medial  branch  blocks  before  facet 
joint RFA, there appear to be some patients whose pain 
relief   from  genicular  nerve  blocks  with  steroids  is  sus-
tained.136–138 A study by Kose et al. randomized a total 
of  80 patients to receive either conventional RF of  the 
three  traditional  nerves  or  conventional  RF  of   three 
traditional nerves together with pulsed RF of  the infra-
patellar  and  recurrent  fibular  nerves.  Both  techniques 
provided pain reduction and functional improvement up 
to 6 months after the procedure but the 5- nerve- targeted 
group  showed  significant  improvement  compared  with 
the 3- nerve- targeted group, though the 95% confidence 
intervals overlapped.139

Because  of  methodological  flaws  in  existing  stud-
ies  comparing  different  nerve- targeting  strategies, 
large  comparative- effectiveness  trials  comparing  the 
current  standard  3- nerve  technique  to  more  aggres-
sive  ones  are  needed  to  determine  optimal  lesioning 
parameters.

Chemical ablation of genicular nerves

Ablation of genicular nerves can also be performed with 
chemical agents.140–144 The use of alcohol (50%–100%) or 
phenol  (6%–9%)  are  both  described  to  perform  neuro-
lytic blocks.

Alcohol  neurolysis  of  genicular  nerves  was  only  de-
scribed  in  a  case  report  and  series.142,143  Both  studies 
reported  pain  reduction,  respectively  at  6 weeks  and 
6 months follow- up.

The  phenolisation  of  genicular  nerves  was  de-
scribed  in  a  prospective  cohort  study.140  Forty- three 
patients  underwent  an  ultrasound- guided  injection  of 
1.5 mL  phenol  at  each  target.  At  6 months  follow- up, 
about 50% of patients had ≥50% pain reduction. Yildiz 
et al. randomized 64 patients into conventional RF or 
neurolysis  with  phenol  6%.  There  were  no  significant 
differences between the groups up to three months fol-
low- up.144 There are currently several ongoing studies 
using chemical neurolysis to target a larger number of 
genicular nerves.

In  conclusion,  only  a  small  number  of  studies  cur-
rently  describe  the  use  of  chemical  neurolysis  of  the 
genicular nerves. More research on the clinical effective-
ness of chemical neurolysis is still needed.

Surgery

Whereas  mild  knee  OA  is  generally  well- managed  by 
conservative  treatments,  a  large  number  of  patients 
experience  inadequate  pain  and  symptom  relief  as 
reported  by  the  Study  of  Osteoarthritis  Real  World 
Therapies  (SORT),  a  prospective  observational  study 
conducted in six European countries in 2015.145 Patients 
with longer disease duration, bilateral knee OA, greater 
opioid use, and higher prevalence of co- morbidities are 
more  likely  to  experience  pain  refractory  to  conven-
tional  treatments.  It  is  estimated  that  50%  percent  of 
patients diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA will un-
dergo TKA procedure in their lifetime.22 Currently the 
International Cartilage Repair and Joint Preservation 
Society (ICRS) focuses on joint- preserving treatments 
to  postpone  joint  replacement,  which  typically  lasts 
between 10 and up to 20 years. Surgery to unload joints 
(eg,  joint  distraction  or  osteotomy)  and  repair  OCD 
have been shown to favorably alter biomechanics and 
improve symptoms.146,147

Surgery is indicated in patients with osteoarthritis re-
fractory to conservative treatment. Surgical procedures 
performed for knee OA are57,58

5.  Osteotomy around the knee
6.  Knee  arthroplasty  (unicondylar  or  bicompartmental 
knee arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or revisions 
thereof)

7.  Meniscus replacement/repair
8.  Ligament repair (eg, anterior cruciate ligament repair 

and medial collateral ligament repair)

Arthroscopy  of  the  knee  which  was  extensively  per-
formed  before  randomized  controlled  trials  found  evi-
dence for a lack of effect, may lead to worse short- term 
outcomes  and  does  not  inhibit  disease  progression.148 
Osteochondral  repair  aims  to  repair  damaged  articular 
cartilage in early OA. The results are promising, but the 
technique  is  currently  limited  to  study  settings.149  Early 
correction  of  mechanical  factors  (mal- tracking  patella, 
malalignment, etc.) before they lead to deleterious (osteo)
chondral structural changes should be pursued whenever 
possible  to  delay  the  development  of  OA  and  following 
joint  replacement  at  a  young  age.150  During  osteotomy, 
the bones forming the knee joint are realigned to “unload” 
the damaged cartilage. Total or partial knee arthroplasty 
(TKA) is the treatment of choice in refractive end- stage 
knee OA. TKA is successful in diminishing pain and in-
creasing functionality; however, 20% of the patients are 
dissatisfied postoperatively and many develop PPSP.26–28

Neurostimulation (central and peripheral)

Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) involves using elec-
trical  pulses  from  a  peripherally  positioned  electrode 
to inhibit nociceptive input from small- diameter nerve 
fibers.151 PNS of the femoral and the sciatic nerve have 
been  reported  to  be  effective  in  small  trials  for  re-
fractory  postoperative  and  neuropathic  knee  pain.152 
Evidence of the clinical effect of PNS for osteoarthri-
tis  of  the  knee  is  based  on  case  series  and  thus  sys-
tematic  use  is  not  recommended  outside  of  the  study 
setting.153,154

Spinal  cord  stimulation  (SCS)  and  dorsal  root  gan-
glion  (DRG)  stimulation  are  two  forms  of  central  neu-
rostimulation  wherein  an  implanted  pulse  generator 
produces electrical stimulation directly at the spinal cord 
level or at the nerve root with the aim of reducing pain 
intensity.  Literature  on  SCS  and  DRG  stimulation  de-
scribes  the  successful  use  of  these  techniques  in  severe 
refractory  neuropathic  knee  pain  due  to  pain  after  ar-
throplasty, post- traumatic pain, and CRPS.152,155 There 
are no trials on the use of SCS and DRG stimulation for 
chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis.

OA72–74,156

Recommended

Intra- articular hyaluronic acid 
injection

Intra- articular platelet- rich

Studies failed to establish a benefit, and harm may 
be associated with these injections, therefore the 
conditional recommendation against is made. This is 
consistent with the use of hyaluronic acid injections, in 
the context of shared decision- making that recognizes 
the limited evidence of benefit of this treatment, when 
other alternatives have been exhausted or failed to 
provide satisfactory benefit83–85,156

Research tended to show favorable results for IA PRP, 
although it must be noted that the quality of data 
is low, and the included studies exhibited extensive 
heterogeneity. No knee OA guideline currently 
recommends PRP94–101,156

Intra- articular corticosteroid injections (IACS)

IA corticosteroid injection has been reported to lead to the 
following adverse events: transient local pain and swell-
ing; septic arthritis; acute corticosteroid- microcrystalline 
joint flare; hemarthrosis; and systemic reactions due to 
absorption of  corticosteroids including facial flush, hy-
perglycemia,  and  high  blood  pressure.156  The  incidence 
of  adverse events due to IACS is low and serious adverse 
events are rare.72,156 Long- term adverse effects of  IACS 
are controversial. Although the anti- inflammatory effect 
of   corticosteroids  might  theoretically  slow  disease  pro-
gression, there is evidence of  time-  and dose- dependent 
deleterious  effects  of   corticosteroids  possibly  resulting 
in cartilage damage and chondrotoxicity.157 A Cochrane 
systematic review from 2015 reported that there was no 
evidence  of   an  effect  of   corticosteroids  on  joint  space 
narrowing compared to sham or no interventions for up 
to 6 months; however, this conclusion was based on a sin-
gle  RCT.72  McAlindon  et  al.  published  the  results  of   a 
randomized, double- blind study in 140 patients with knee 
OA  patients  that  found  that  IACS  was  associated  with 
significantly  greater  cartilage  volume  loss  compared  to 
sham injections on magnetic resonance imaging at 2- year 
follow- up, while Latourte et al. reported that IACS injec-
tions  did  not  significantly  increase  the  5- year  incidence 
of  total knee replacement or radiographic worsening in 

knee  OA.78,158  Future  studies  should  address  the  long- 
term safety of  IACS.

Intra- articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) injection

IAHA has a low rate of adverse effects.80,86,156,159 Despite 
a  higher  number  of  serious  adverse  events  and  adverse 
event- related study withdrawal in the systematic reviews 
by Rutjes et al. and Pereira et al.59,76 the most frequent 
adverse  events  are  short- term  knee  pain,  swelling,  ar-
thralgia,  and  effusion.  The  network  meta- analysis  by 
Bannuru et al.156 found similar adverse event rates for all 
IA injections. Unlike IACS, there are no systemic effects 
of IAHA.

Intra- articular injections with 
platelet- rich plasma

Literature  on  PRP  asserts  that  IA  PRP  is  not  linked 
to  any  major  safety  issue  and  that  adverse  events  are 
mild.71,94,107,109 Frequently reported adverse events, simi-
lar to IACS and IAHA, are infection, bleeding, bruising, 
peripheral nerve injury, and temporary exacerbation of 
pain typically lasting from 2 to 7 days.156

Radiofrequency of genicular nerves

Systematic  reviews  report  the  RF  intervention  to  be 
safe  with  limited  non- severe  adverse  events.125,126,160,161 

VANNESTE et al.

Frequent  adverse  events  are  postoperative  pain  (tran-
sient neuritis), hypoesthesia, and bruising. Other possi-
ble adverse events are allergic reactions, knee hematoma, 
infection, and soft tissue damage including skin burns if 
the RF cannula is positioned incorrectly.162

T E C H N IQU E S

IACS injection

There  is  considerable  heterogeneity  in  the  dosage  and 
volume of injection, with most studies reporting the use 
of an equivalent dose of 40 mg prednisolone and a volume 
of 2–6 mL of injectate.72 One randomized study found no 
differences in any outcome measures when comparing 40 
and 80 mg of triamcinolone. We describe an ultrasound- 
guided  procedure  using  the  suprapatellar  approach  as 
this  technique  results  in  a  high  rate  of  intraarticular 
spread even in the presence of knee effusions.163

The patient is placed in the supine position with the 
knee  flexed  30°.  A  high- frequency  linear  ultrasound 
probe is placed on the patella in the transverse position 
and is gently slid proximally to visualize the quadriceps 
tendon.  Subclinical  knee  joint  effusions  can  be  visible 
under the quadriceps and suprapatellar fat pad. The tar-
get point is the suprapatellar bursa between the suprapa-
tellar fat pad and the prefemoral fat pad. The insertion 
point of the needle should be lateral to the probe so that 
the in- plane trajectory does not pass through the quad-
riceps  tendon.  After  subcutaneous  infiltration  of  local 
anesthetic, a 22–25- gauge needle is inserted into the joint 
recession or effusion. In case of excessive joint effusion, 
fluid can also be aspirated. Last, the volume of cortico-
steroid is injected with minimal resistance.

IAHA injection

The  technique  used  for  IAHA  injections  is  similar  to 
the  IACS  injections.  Correct  positioning  of  the  needle 
in  the  intra- articular  compartment  is  essential  for  an 
IAHA injection as injection of hyaluronic acid into the 
periarticular compartment results in little therapeutical 
effect. Studies report injection volumes ranging from 0.5 
to 6.0 mL and concentrations varying from 0.8 to 30 mg/
mL.79

IA PRP injection

The technique of IA PRP injection is similar to the IA 
injection technique for IACS and IAHA.

Intraarticular injections are performed in a “blinded” 
manner  or  using  fluoroscopic  or  ultrasound  guidance. 
Studies  have  found  failure  rates  ranging  between  less 
injections.164,165 
than  5%–30%  for 

landmark- guided 

Image- guided  procedures  may  result  in  larger  effect 
sizes as shown by one large long- term cohort where pa-
tients who were treated with ultrasound- guided viscos-
upplementation were significantly less likely to undergo 
knee  arthroplasty  compared  to  patients  treated  with 
landmark- guided  injections.166  Compared  to  fluoros-
copy, an ultrasound- guided procedure can ensure intra- 
articular needle placement without radiation, but unlike 
fluoroscopy cannot evaluate joint degeneration or iden-
tify capsular tears.72

RF of the genicular nerves

We  describe  here  the  technique  for  targeting  three  tra-
ditional  genicular  nerves:  the  superomedial  (SMGN), 
the superolateral (SLGN), and the inferomedial genicu-
lar nerve (IMGN), as well as the technique to target the 
additional nerves. Whereas the described technique in-
corporates  updated  knowledge  from  recent  anatomic 
studies  evaluating  the  locations  and  trajectories  of  the 
genicular nerves, a number of different approaches to the 
genicular nerves are described in the literature, with no 
studies  comparing  effectiveness.119,167–170  Currently,  the 
optimal  targets  for  the  US-   or  fluoroscopically- guided 
technique are the subject of debate and similar to all new 
techniques it will likely go through adaptations as new 
insights  from  scientific  evidence  emerge.  The  following 
description is based on the expert opinion of the author 
team and aims to present a roadmap for the clinician.

Anatomical variations of the genicular nerves are il-
lustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the innervation of 
the anterior knee capsule.

The  patient  is  placed  in  a  supine  position  with  the 
index knee flexed 10–15° by placing a cushion in the pop-
liteal  fossa.  The  patient  can  be  monitored  using  pulse 
oximetry and if indicated, lightly sedated. The three ge-
nicular nerves are targeted using a high- frequency linear 
ultrasound  probe  or  fluoroscopy  under  sterile  condi-
tions. Ultrasound-  and fluoroscopically- guided RF nee-
dle placement have resulted in similar effectiveness.171,172 
Although an ultrasound- guided procedure does not ex-
pose  the  patient  and  operator  to  radiation  and  enables 
visualization of soft tissues, gauging depth (especially in 
obese  patients)  is  difficult,  and  aligning  the  electrodes 
parallel  to  the  target  nerve  trajectories  is  easier  with 
fluoroscopy. Therefore, which imaging guidance is pre-
ferred depends on the experience of the operator.

A  prognostic  block  is  sometimes  performed  prior 
to  RF,  though  both  direct  (randomized  trials)  and  in-
direct  (comparisons  of  outcomes  between  studies  that 
have  used  and  not  used  prognostic  blocks)  evidence 
demonstrates  consistently  >80%  response  rates  and  no 
improvement  in  outcomes.173,174  When  blocks  are  used, 
the cut- off for designating a block as positive has gener-
ally been ≥50% pain relief, though one study found that 
using an 80% threshold resulted in a higher proportion 

CHRONIC KNEE PAIN 
 
of successful procedures.117,125,174 The prognostic block is 
usually performed with volumes not exceeding 1 mL of 
local anesthetic per genicular nerve. Due to the question-
able prognostic effect and patient discomfort associated 
with the blocks, we presently advise against the routine 
use of a prognostic block.

RF cannula placement for ultrasound- guided RF

SMGN: The transducer is placed in a coronal orientation 
over the medial epicondyle of the femur and repositioned 
between  the  epiphysis  and  diaphysis  of  the  femur.  The 
target  point  is  at  the  posterior  half  of  the  femur.  After 
visualization of the target point, the transducer is then 
turned  90°  into  the  transverse  plane,  and  the  RF  can-
nula is inserted after local anesthetic infiltration to skin 
and soft tissues and advanced in an “in- plane” approach 
until contact is made with the bony cortex at the poste-
rior half of the femur.

IMGN:  The  transducer  is  placed  in  a  coronal  orien-
tation  over  the  medial  tibial  epiphysis  and  diaphysis, 
the  inferomedial  genicular  artery,  and  the  medial  col-
lateral ligament. If the IM genicular artery is visualized 
below the medial collateral ligament and above the bony 
cortex,  the  RF  cannula  is  directed  next  to  the  artery; 
otherwise,  the  target  point  is  the  junction  between  the 
epiphysis and diaphysis under the medial collateral lig-
ament. After visualization of the target point an out- of- 
plane entry point for the needle is used. The transducer 
is then turned 90° into the transverse plane and the RF 
cannula  is  inserted  after  local  anesthetic  infiltration  of 
skin and soft tissues, and advanced using an “in- plane” 
approach until contact is made with the bony cortex at 
the center of the tibia.

SLGN: The transducer is placed in a coronal orienta-
tion  over  the  femoral  lateral  epicondyle  at  the  junction 
between the epiphysis and diaphysis. The target point is 
the posterior half of the junction between the epiphysis 
and  diaphysis  of  the  femur.  The  transducer  is  centered 
on short axis of the femur to visualize this target point. 
After  the  skin  and  soft  tissue  are  anesthetized  with  li-
docaine,  the  cannula  is  advanced  using  an  anterior- to- 
posterior “in- plane” approach in the oblique plane until 
contact is made with the posterior half of the bony cortex 
of the femur.

RF cannula placement for 
fluoroscopically- guided RF

The  traditional  target  points  for  the  fluoroscopically- 
guided procedure are similar to those used for ultrasound.
For  the  SMGN,  IMGN,  and  SLGN,  the  cannulas 
are introduced under true AP fluoroscopic views of the 
tibiofemoral  joint  using  a  “co- axial  (tunnel- view)  tech-
nique.” For the SMGN and the SLGN, the introducers 

|  13 of 21

are inserted medial and lateral to the junction of the fem-
oral  shaft  and  condyles,  respectively,  and  advanced  to 
between 50% and 100% across the depth of the femoral 
shaft. For the IMGN, the cannula is inserted medial to 
the  junction  of  the  medial  tibial  condyle  and  the  shaft 
and advanced to 25%–75% depth across the tibial shaft.

More nerves are recommended with the fluoroscopically- 
guided approach and research on the outcomes incorpo-
rating those new targets is ongoing.

Once  the  cannula  position  is  confirmed  in  multiple 
views, an RF electrode is inserted into the cannula. Sensory 
stimulation (50 Hz) is applied and should ideally produce 
paresthesia at a threshold of 0.5 V or less, but this is not 
always reproducible. The absence of fasciculations below 
1 V is observed after motor stimulation at 2 Hz, confirm-
ing  sufficient  distance  to  relevant  motor  branches,  par-
ticularly for the ILGN and recurrent fibular nerve. If no 
sensory stimulation threshold is obtained at this position, 
the electrode can be repositioned until this is achieved.

For  conventional  RF,  100 mm  long,  large  electrodes 
(eg,  18G)  with  longer  (eg,  10 mm)  active  tips  are  often 
used to increase nerve capture rates although this could 
cause  increased  patient  discomfort  during  the  proce-
dure. During cooled RF, a 100 mm long, 17G RF intro-
ducer with an 18 G cooled electrode containing a 4 mm 
active tip is used.

SU M M A RY OF T R E AT M E N T 
R E COM M E N DAT ION S

We  recommend  the  following  for  patients  with  chronic 
knee pain due to osteoarthritis:

•  All  patients  should  be  advised  to  engage  in  physio-
therapy,  perform  aquatic  and  land- based  exercises, 
use  gait  aids,  participate  in  weight  management  and 
nutritional  programs 
indicated,  consider  self- 
management  groups,  and  utilize  pharmacological 
treatments.

if 

•  Knee  osteoarthritis  patients  should  undergo  trials 
with the following medications unless contraindicated: 
paracetamol, topical or oral NSAIDs, and duloxetine. 
Opioids  are  not  routinely  recommended  for  chronic 
non- malignant knee pain. Mixed- action opioids such 
as tramadol, tapentadol, and buprenorphine in those 
with high- impact pain can be considered.

•  Intra- articular  infiltrations  with  corticosteroids  are 
recommended  for  short- term  pain  relief  in  knee  OA 
patients.  Other  injections  such  as  hyaluronic  acid, 
PRP, stem cells, and so on are not recommended, only 
in trial settings and not on a regular basis but may be 
considered in some circumstances.

•  Conventional and cooled radiofrequency treatment of 
the genicular nerves is recommended in patients suf-
fering  from  therapy- resistant  knee  pain  due  to  OA  if 
the pain is moderate to severe and KL grade is II–IV.
