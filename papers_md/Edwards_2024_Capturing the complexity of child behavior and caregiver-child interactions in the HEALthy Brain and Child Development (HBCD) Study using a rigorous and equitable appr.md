The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study, a multi-site prospective longitudinal cohort study,
will examine human brain, cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional development beginning prenatally and
planned through early childhood. This article outlines methodological considerations and the decision-making
process for measurement selection for child behavior, parenting/caregiver-child interactions, and the family/
home environment for HBCD. The decision-making process is detailed, including formation of a national
workgroup (WG-BEH) that focused on developmentally appropriate measures that take a rigorous and equitable
approach and aligned with HBCD objectives. Multi-level-observational and caregiver-report measures were
deemed necessary for capturing the desired constructs across multiple contexts while balancing the nuance of
observational data with pragmatic considerations. WG-BEH prioritized developmentally sensitive, validated
assessments with psychometrics supporting use in diverse populations and focused on mechanistic linkages and
prediction of desired constructs. Other considerations included participant burden and retention, staff training
needs, and cultural sensitivity. Innovation was permitted when it was grounded in evidence and filled key gaps.
Finally, this article describes the rationale for the selected constructs (e.g., temperament, social-emotional
development, parenting behaviors, family organization) and corresponding measures chosen for HBCD visits
from early infancy through 17 months of age.

The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study is a na-
tional consortium study that aims to better understand how brain and
child development is affected by exposure to various adverse and pro-
tective environmental, social, and biological factors during pregnancy
and after birth. This study is enrolling over 7000 diverse pregnant in-
dividuals and their children at 27 sites across the U.S. and following
them from pregnancy through early childhood (Nelson et al., this issue).
Specific goals of the HBCD Study include characterizing typical neuro-
developmental trajectories of young children; identifying key develop-
mental windows during which exposure to substances, poverty, other
stressors, and protective influences have the greatest impact on neuro-
development; and assessing the impact of early caregiver-child

relationships on risk and resilience pathways, all within an equitable
lens. The purpose of this article is to describe the conceptualization,
methodological considerations, and decision-making processes involved
in selecting specific constructs and measures under the broad umbrella
of “child behavior and caregiver-child interaction” for HBCD.

Consortium Administrative Core (HCAC) and Steering Committee. The
Child Behavior and Caregiver-Child Interactions Workgroup (WG-BEH)
was formed to select constructs and assessments related to child
behavior, parenting and caregiver-child interactions, and the family and
home environment. Initial selection of domains within the WG-BEH
purview were developed with HCAC input but ultimately decided
upon by the WG-BEH chairs and members.

1.1. Decision making principles

WG-BEH decisions were guided by several overarching principles.
Given the large coverage area that could be subsumed under the do-
mains of “child behavior” and “caregiver-child interactions,” the
workgroup selected specific constructs and measures to align with the
HBCD Study design (see Fig. 1) that were also (1) responsive to study
aims; (2) measurable during early childhood in a developmentally
meaningful way (birth to 5 years); (3) pragmatic for implementation in a
large national consortia; (4) relevant and valid for families from diverse
cultural and sociodemographic backgrounds; (5) distinct from those
being identified by other workgroups (e.g., neurocognition, caregiver
mental health); and, (6) that allowed continuity with the Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (abcdstudy.org), when
developmentally appropriate and relevant (Morris et al., 2020). In
addition, WG-BEH prioritized constructs that have (1) established neu-
ral correlates; and/or (2) documented sensitivity to the effects of in
utero substance exposures and other prenatal and postnatal environ-
mental exposures; and/or (3) potential relevance for modifying/mod-
erating exposure effects on developmental trajectories. In prioritizing
domains, WG-BEH was cognizant of including measures that assess
protective and promotive factors as well as those that assess risk and
areas of concern. Following an iterative process of discussions and re-
view, WG-BEH selected essential domains of study that could be assessed
within the study design.

1.2. Measure selection decisions

WG-BEH identified measures that mapped onto the chosen construct
domains. Measure selection was also guided by a number of principles,
including that chosen assessments (1) were valid with diverse pop-
ulations and during the relevant ages of assessment; (2) could be

repeated across time to detect changes in development and/or caregiver-
child relationships; (3) were available and validated in English and
Spanish or could be translated; (4) were feasible to administer in a va-
riety of settings; (5) minimized participant and investigator/staff burden
(i.e., costs, time, equipment, training, managing complexity of required
data collection) without sacrificing construct validity; and (6) when
possible, could be administered remotely and/or flexibly to accommo-
date family needs. Some measures were specifically adapted for use in
HBCD when existing measures were prohibitively long or complex, and
newer measures were considered to assess important constructs for
which established measures were not available. Each measure was
assigned two to three subject matter experts (SMEs) from WG-BEH.
SMEs were responsible for incorporating the measure into the HBCD
protocol at multiple stages (e.g., adapting for HBCD usage, presenting to
the Steering Committee for review and protocol adoption, overseeing
ongoing data quality).

1.3. Considerations for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)

HBCD’s core values statements include supporting participation of
families from all sociocultural backgrounds to reflect the rich diversity
families in the United States (https://hbcdstudy.org/values/).
of
Assessing child behavior and caregiver-child interactions across diverse
participants from different cultural, geographic, and experiential back-
grounds is essential for achieving HBCD scientific goals. WG-BEH strived
to include culturally sensitive assessments, or those that measure child
behavior and caregiver-child interaction in a way that represents the
perspectives of participants from varied cultural backgrounds (Mikko-
nen et al., 2022). In addition, it is important that such assessment tools
are valid, meaningful, and function equitably across racial and ethnic
groups.

DEI considerations were central to deliberations when selecting and
adapting measures for use in HBCD. Diverse cultural backgrounds and
changes in societal arrangements have expanded what was once
considered the traditional definition of family; for example, family
members may not live together, and children may be cared for by
extended family or non-family members at various times. In addition,
past research on parenting and parent-child relationships has had a
strong history of gender bias, with a focus primarily on mothers and
heterosexual parents (Patterson, 1992, 2006). Thus, as often as possible,

measures were edited so that terms such as mother, father, and parent
were adapted to apply to a variety of caregiving environments and to
include non-biased language and gender inclusiveness (e.g., “care-
giver”). WG-BEH also examined the ableist assumptions (e.g., Botte-
ma-Beutel et al., 2021) of commonly used assessments of parents and
children and adapted the administration of the observational assess-
ments to be inclusive of caregivers and children with a range of abilities.
Additionally, caregiver-report measures needed to be accessible to
people with different reading levels, access to technology, and digital
literacy.

The most recent U.S. Census indicated that, after English, Spanish
was by far the most common language spoken in the U.S. (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2020). While it would be ideal to include families who speak all
languages in HBCD, the consortium decided to limit participation to
English and Spanish speakers. This decision was made to ensure that
individuals who speak the two most common languages have access to
all aspects of the study, including recruitment materials, consent forms,
measures, and bilingual research staff. Unfortunately, translating all
materials and hiring staff fluent in multiple languages would present
significant logistical challenges and reduce the likelihood of study-wide
success.

To facilitate adherence to HBCD’s core DEI values, all WG-BEH
recommended measures were reviewed by the HBCD DEI workgroup
(WG-DEI). Both the WG-DEI and WG-BEH include scholars who have
studied diverse families and communities, and members with lived
experience of various languages and cultures. The WG-BEH also con-
sulted with experts within HBCD and the broader field of child devel-
opment regarding antiracist measures and inclusion of those who have
been historically underrepresented in research (Iruka et al., 2022;
Zgierska et al., 2024). The WG-DEI provided feedback around gender
bias, nuclear family assumptions, ableist assumptions, racially or
culturally biased items, and use of coded language (Murray & Slopen,
this issue). In response to DEI concerns, WG-BEH SMEs consulted with
measure creators when possible to obtain permission and ensure that the
proposed changes did not threaten measure validity. In rare instances of
disagreement or unresolved DEI issues concerning measures within
WG-BEH, various steps were taken: the measure creator was consulted;
alternative measures were explored; and/or an anonymous poll was
administered to workgroup members, and, if the majority voted in favor
of the measure, it was presented to the HBCD Steering Committee for
final decision.

1.4. Inclusion of observational measures

WG-BEH concluded that both caregiver-report and observational
measures were essential for assessing child behavior and caregiver-child
interactions (Morris et al., 2020). Caregiver reports are invaluable and
have the advantage of ease of administration and leveraging of care-
givers’ historical knowledge of their children’s development and func-
tioning across a range of contexts. Observational assessments provide
ratings of child behavior that complement caregiver reports, which can
be prone to bias due to caregivers’ difficulty objectively rating behavior
(Briggs-Gowan et al., 1996; Hay et al., 1999; Morris et al., 2020;
Wakschlag et al., 2005). Observational measures provide a more stan-
dardized assessment of the child’s development and may add precision
in detection of prenatal exposure effects, despite the added burden in
terms of time, cost, and training (Massey et al., 2020). The ecological
validity they afford and their unique capacity to capture families’ lived
experience is also critical for advancing an equitable and anti-racist
science (Iruka et al., 2022; Weisleder et al., in preparation).

Unfortunately, observational assessment has had limited traction as
big data approaches have gained momentum for large-scale neuro-
developmental consortia. This may be due in part to their relative
burden for data acquisition (e.g., often done in a laboratory or home
setting requiring a lengthy family visit) and time intensive coding (e.g.,
extensive training and coding time that is 3–4x longer than the

observational paradigm itself). Recognizing the need to balance prag-
matics with developmentally sensitive methods, WG-BEH proposed
including a series of standardized observational assessments adapted for
HBCD to efficiently capture caregiver-child interactions and child
behavior, which will then be coded by a centralized coding team. This
ensures that observational data will be available for public release in a
timely fashion, in parallel to the rigor and quality of the neural data
(Morris et al., 2020).

1.4.1. One-pass coding

Traditionally, observational coding is a lengthy process that includes
extensive training and a multi-pass approach, requiring hours to code
each task. This approach is not tenable for use in a large national con-
sortium, with its large sample size, and imperative for rapid public
release of data. Thus, a WG-BEH subgroup developed an adapted coding
scheme that retains the “essence” of constructs captured by established,
validated codes while distilling them to a simpler form that would
enable a reliable “one-pass” coding method (Morris et al., 2020). This
approach requires sacrificing some nuance while ensuring that obser-
vational methods could be incorporated into the core HBCD protocol.
While not common, there is precedence for one-pass coding to be used
successfully in developmental research (Crnic et al., 2005; Stevenson
and Crnic, 2013).

In one-pass coding, coders rate activities during a single video
viewing, without pausing or replaying, requiring simplification and
reduction in the number of codes. A master coder model is used to
ensure coder reliability, with 20 % of videos double coded. A specialized
training manual is being developed to generate bias awareness and
reduce implicit bias in the coding process. This approach is employed at
initial coding to reliability and in a standard monitoring and discussion
process throughout the data collection period.

1.4.2. Equity in observational assessment

Recent heightened awareness of structural and methodologic in-
equities “baked into” psychological and other research methods, as well
as implicit bias, has propelled the field to re-examine traditional mea-
sures within the lens of anti-racism, cultural humility, and equitable
assessment towards more a more inclusive and representative science
(Iruka et al., 2023; Kamboukos et al., 2022; Nketia et al., 2021; Smith
et al., 2023; Stern et al., 2022). WG-BEH consulted with leading experts
in culturally responsive and anti-racist developmental science (Amso
Iruka et al., 2023, 2022; Nketia et al., 2021;
and Lynn, 2017;
Tamis-LeMonda and Kahana-Kalman, 2009) to operationalize coding for
HBCD. For example, traditional codes, such as caregiver “intrusiveness,”
that rely on coder inference and may have differential meaning and
and contexts,
predictive validity across
(Benito-Gomez, 2022; Diemer et al., 2021) were replaced with codes,
such as “directiveness,” that focus only on observed caregiver behaviors.

2. Domains of assessment

The following sections describe the three overarching domains
within the purview of WG-BEH: (1) child behavior; (2) parenting and
caregiver-child interactions; and (3) family and home environment, and
the specific corresponding measures chosen for HBCD Study visits 3–5.
As visits 1–2 occur during pregnancy and the neonatal period, respec-
tively, no WG-BEH assessments are administered at these visits. Visits
3–5 cover child ages 3–17 months, with staggered age ranges. Though
HBCD will extend beyond these ages, current protocol development is
still underway for visits 6 and beyond, so not discussed here. Table 1
provides an overview of current WG-BEH measures and the timing of
visits. Assessments include caregiver reports and observational assess-
ments, each described in detail below as the applicable domain is
discussed.

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience69(2024)1014223R.C. Edwards et al.

3. Domain one: Child behavior

Socioemotional development is a foundational component of early
childhood; thus, a primary goal of HBCD is to acquire data on child
socioemotional development and mental health, as reflected in the
measures chosen for this domain.

3.1. Socioemotional problems

Early problems regulating emotions and behavior have been linked
to developmental delays and behavioral problems across the lifespan,
with as many as 20 % of children in the U.S. being diagnosed with a
mental health disorder by the age of 3 years (Dougherty et al., 2015;
Stephenson, 2021). Interactions between genetic predispositions and
early life experiences, including prenatal exposures, can disrupt healthy
brain development and increase the risk for mental health problems,
which often manifests as dysregulation (Belsky and De Haan, 2011; Van
den Bergh et al., 2018). A critical goal of HBCD is to track brain
development and associated functioning across infancy and childhood,
with the goal of identifying specific early life vulnerabilities and re-
siliencies and changes in brain functioning that are associated with
mental health.

Irritability has been identified as a transdiagnostic construct under-
lying many mental health problems, an indicator of early neuro-
developmental vulnerability (Wakschlag et al., 2018), and a robust
predictor of lifespan mental health disorders and functional impairment
(Klein et al., 2021; Sorcher et al., 2022; Wakschlag, 2023). Therefore,
irritability was chosen as a focal construct during these early visits and is
assessed both observationally and through caregiver report. At later
developmental stages, WG-BEH plans to incorporate additional mea-
sures to capture a broad range of emerging mental health problems.

3.1.1. The Early Regulation in Context Assessment (ERICA)

The ERICA (Krogh-Jespersen, Kaat, et al., 2022) is an adaptation of
the well-established Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation
Schedule (DB-DOS), a standardized developmental-clinical observation
paradigm, which has been validated in multiple independent and
diverse early childhood samples and has demonstrated sensitivity to
exposure effects and predictive, clinical, and mechanistic utility (Frost
et al., 2018; Lind et al., 2014; Massey et al., 2020; Qui˜nones-Camacho
et al., 2020; Wakschlag et al., 2008). The ERICA was chosen because it is
non-proprietary, efficiently elicits variability in child and caregiver
behavior, and is easily adapted to different developmental stages
through use of appropriate emotion-eliciting activities from infancy
through preschool age. Each age-based version consists of five brief
activities that the caregiver and child are asked to do together. For
example, an activity that elicits frustration might include getting
cleaned up (wiping child’s face and hands) for an infant or completing a
challenging puzzle task for a toddler. An activity that elicits enjoyment
might include blowing bubbles or playing with fun toys. By including a
range of activities, the ERICA allows observation of the amount and
quality of children’s emotions and social engagement, as well as how
these are managed within the caregiving relationship. The ERICA
paradigm and codes were adapted for use in HBCD, weighing the
following considerations: (1) relevance to core HBCD constructs; (2)
ease of administration across multiple sites; (3) feedback from focus
groups with diverse caregivers; (4) codes that could be meaningfully
applied from early infancy through preschool age; (5) potential for
behavioral reduction and simplification; and (6) bias reduction and
enhancement of cultural humility (Weisleder et al., in preparation).

factor in the intensity, duration, context (e.g. “out of the blue” or
developmentally appropriate in response to a challenging task), and
child’s ability to recover.

3.1.2. The Multidimensional Assessment Profiles, Temper Loss Scale
(MAPS-TL)

The MAPS-TL (Wakschlag et al., 2012; Wiggins et al., 2023) is a
caregiver-report survey that assesses child atypical irritability. The
MAPS-TL captures irritable behavior and mood in a developmentally
sensitive manner, including frequency, expression, context, and quali-
tative features (e.g., “wake up fussy,” “break or destroy things during
tantrums”). Versions for infants (<1 year old) and toddlers/preschoolers
(1–5 years) are administered (Krogh-Jespersen, MacNeill, et al., 2022;
Wakschlag et al., 2012).

3.2. Socioemotional competence

Socioemotional competence refers to a young child’s ability to ex-
press and regulate emotions and behaviors, as well as form positive re-
lationships with others (Eisenberg and Fabes, 2006), which are
foundational for lifelong physical and mental health, and academic
achievement (Murray et al., 2015; Shonkoff et al., 2012). Thus, the
WG-BEH felt strongly that including measures of promotive or positive
socioemotional experience were integral
to understanding child
development.

3.2.1. The ERICA

Two aspects of socioemotional competence are assessed with the
ERICA (see Section 3.1.1). (1) Positive Affect measures the child’s in-
tensity and modulation of expression of positive affect, such as play-
fulness, joy, and enthusiasm. Low-level indicators include brief smiles or
excited movements, whereas high-level positive affect may be seen
through laughing, clapping, or bright sustained smiling. (2) Social

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience69(2024)1014224R.C. Edwards et al.

Engagement measures the extent to which the child is responsive to and
initiates interactions with the caregiver. Behaviors can range from
looking with interest to engaging in back-and-forth play in an infant/
toddler, to initiating and sustaining conversation, sharing information,
and engaging in back-and forth conversation in an older child. They do
not include attempts to be soothed by, or irritable/angry behaviors to-
wards the caregiver.

3.2.2. The Early Childhood version of the Patient-Reported Outcome
Measurement Information System (ecPROMIS®)

The ecPROMIS offers clinicians and researchers a brief, efficient, and
precise way to evaluate young children’s well-being (Blackwell et al.,
2020; Lai et al., 2022; Park et al., 2022). The PROMIS initiative devel-
oped item banks that have been normed to the U.S. population,
providing scores in the common T-score metric (Cella et al., 2022, 2007;
Sherlock et al., 2022). The ecPROMIS caregiver reports include a Self--
Regulation-Flexibility scale and Peer Relationships scale. The Self--
Regulation-Flexibility scale assesses young children’s cognitive flexibility,
or the ability to adapt in response to environmental demands, changes,
and expectations (Blackwell et al., 2022; Murray et al., 2015). The Peer
Relationships scale measures young children’s positive peer interactions,
sociability (getting along well with others), and empathic behaviors.

3.3. Temperament

Temperament shapes how children perceive and respond to their
social world. Temperament is conceptualized as constitutionally based
individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation that emerge in
infancy, are relatively stable, and underlie expressions of stress reac-
tivity, emotionality, and sociability (Gartstein and Rothbart, 2003;
Stifter, 2016). Temperament is related to differences in brain develop-
ment (Filippi et al., 2020; P´erez-Edgar and Fox, 2018; Salzwedel et al.,
2019) and can be shaped by maternal mental health and early life ex-
posures (Davies et al., 2021; McGrath et al., 2008). The behavioral in-
hibition temperament profile (e.g., highly fearful or behaviorally
inhibited) is the most potent specific risk factor for anxiety disorders
later in life (Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2009; Goldsmith et al., 2022).
Others (e.g., high positive affect, well-regulated) are related to positive
relationships with caregivers (Planalp et al., 2017, 2019) and lower
behavioral inhibition in adolescence (Moore et al., 2022). For these
reasons, temperament was determined to be a critical socioemotional
domain and is assessed using both observational and caregiver report
measures.

3.3.1. Rothbart behavior questionnaires

Caregiver reported child temperament can be measured using
developmentally appropriate questionnaires originally developed by
Rothbart and colleagues. There are multiple parallel versions that show
strong reliability and validity, relevant for the infancy (Gartstein and
Rothbart, 2003; Putnam et al., 2014), toddlerhood/preschool (Putnam
et al., 2006), and preschool/middle childhood (Putnam et al., 2006;
Rothbart et al., 2001) periods. Each is also available in a very-short form
that is easily administered online, reducing the burden for caregivers
(Putnam et al., 2006, 2014). The very-short form questionnaires provide
scores for three overarching temperament domains: Surgency/Ex-
traversion, Negative Affect, and Effortful Control. The full versions also
include a scale reflecting Behavioral Inhibition, a particularly salient
temperament characteristic that shows unique relations to brain devel-
opment (Planalp et al., 2023) and emerging anxiety (Chronis-Tuscano
et al., 2009). Thus, the broad domains of infant/child temperament are
measured in HBCD using the very short forms plus the Behavioral In-
hibition scale from the long form.

3.3.2. Laboratory temperament assessment

To supplement caregiver report, observed behavioral inhibition (BI)
is collected using the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery (Lab-

TAB; (Goldsmith, 1999; (Planalp et al., 2017)) Stranger task, which
WG-BEH termed the “friendly unfamiliar adult” for HBCD protocols. In
this task an unfamiliar adult approaches a child, either while the child is
seated in a high-chair (9–12 months) or playing on the floor (12 +
months), as might occur when a caregiver and child are sitting in a
doctor’s office or receiving visitors in the home. Coding of bodily, facial,
and verbal fear behaviors will be completed in a similar manner to
ERICA “one-pass” coding by the ERICA coding team.

4. Domain two: Parenting and caregiver-child relationships

Longitudinal investigations, such as HBCD, that track the contribu-
tion of parenting and caregiver-child relationship quality to child out-
comes must reliably elicit and measure relevant, developmentally
appropriate parenting constructs at different child ages.

4.1. Parenting behaviors

Although the specific parenting behaviors that promote healthy child
development may manifest somewhat differently as children grow, there
is general consensus that positive and effective parenting is character-
ized by warmth and acceptance of the child, provision of structure, and
encouragement of age-appropriate autonomy (Skinner et al., 2005). In
contrast, hostile, coercive, unpredictable, and neglectful parenting
deleteriously affects the caregiver–child relationship and undermines
the child’s healthy development (Glynn and Baram, 2019; Martoccio
et al., 2022; Patterson, 2016; Pinquart, 2017). Socialization models posit
that caregiver responsiveness during infancy and early childhood,
coupled with clear caregiver expectations and contingent discipline
appropriate for the child’s developmental stage and the family context
(e.g., clear parental guidance and limit setting; Baker and Brooks-Gunn,
2020; (Morawska et al., 2019)), promotes internalization of caregiver
expectations, resulting in increasingly self-regulated behavior (Bugen-
tal, 2006; Grusec et al., 2000).

4.1.1. The ERICA

concern,

encouragement, and/or

The ERICA (see Section 3.1.1) includes three codes assessing
parenting behavior. (1) Responsive Behavior measures the caregiver’s
contingent, sensitive responses to the child with acknowledgment,
warmth/affection,
reassurance.
Responsive behavior may include encouraging or warm affect (smiling,
warm tone of voice), comforting child’s distress, terms of endearment/
expressions of affection directed toward child or loving touches. (2) Ir-
ritable Behavior assesses the caregiver’s irritable, frustrated, and/or
angry affect and behavior in response to the child. Irritability can range
from frowning, scowling, and sighing on the lower end, to harsh,
negative comments, yelling, and rough handling of the child on the
higher end. (3) Directive Behavior assesses the extent to which the care-
giver directs the child’s activities or places demands on their behavior.
Examples include limit setting, commands, moving the child’s hands
toward a task, or repeatedly directing child’s attention.

4.1.2. Semi-structured play activity

Given evidence that caregiver responses to child distress and non-
distress have different sequelae (Leerkes et al., 2012), WG-BEH felt it
important to include a paradigm that assessed caregiver-child interac-
tion during an unstructured, playful context. Structured play paradigms
are widely used to assess caregiver and child behaviors relevant to child
cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning. In this task, the
caregiver and child sit on a mat with a standard set of age-appropriate
toys and are asked to interact as they typically would at home. The
length of the task has varied between published studies; WG-BEH
limited the task to 5 minutes to reduce study burden. This paradigm
(or ones similar to it, e.g., the 3-bags task) has successfully been used in
several previous large-scale studies, including those with families from
socioeconomic and racially diverse backgrounds (e.g., Fuligni and

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience69(2024)1014225R.C. Edwards et al.

Brooks-Gunn, 2013; Gustafsson et al., 2012; NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 1999), and to assess the behaviors of many different
types of caregivers (e.g., multigenerational co-parents; fathers and
father-figures) (e.g., Barnett et al., 2012; Mills-Koonce et al., 2015;
Cabrera et al., 2007).

and deference to elders, and familism, which underscores the impor-
tance of family loyalty and cohesion, and is categorized under Proper
Demeaner. The FCM is administered immediately following the ERICA.
The FCM will facilitate examination of connections between structured
observations of caregiver-child interaction and culturally informed
values reported by caregivers that may shape early relationship patterns.

4.2. Caregiver-child relationships

In infancy, caregivers and infants together co-regulate their in-
teractions, with caregivers interpreting and appropriately responding to
infants’ affective and physiological cues (Beeghly et al., 2016; Beeghly
and Tronick, 2011). Importantly, self-regulation is thought to be a
product or extension of co-regulation, whereby children learn and
strengthen self-regulation skills through responsive interactions with
caregivers (Murray et al., 2015). Co-regulation and connectedness in
early development lay the foundation for successful self-regulation of
physiology, behavior, attention, and emotion, and the development of
social emotional competencies throughout the lifespan (Feldman, 2009;
Murray et al., 2015). The caregiver-child relationship also provides an
early model of relationship building, and children with positive parental
relationships have better relationships with peers and others (Ladd and
Kochenderfer-Ladd, 2019).

4.2.1. The ERICA

The ERICA (see Section 3.1.1) includes the dyadic code of connect-
edness. Connectedness is a measure of mutual enjoyment, back-and-forth
interactions, shared attention, and cooperative communication between
the caregiver and child. It assesses how well dyads shift behavior and
emotion in response to each other to stay in synchrony and engage with
each other and/or the same activity (e.g., joint attention to same toy). If
conflict or distress arises, this code assesses how well the dyad works
together to resolve the conflict/distress and return to a state of
emotional equilibrium.

4.2.2. The ecPROMIS

The ecPROMIS (see Section 3.2.2) includes a Caregiver-Child In-
teractions scale. This brief caregiver report questionnaire assesses the
degree to which infants and young children develop close and trusting
relationships with their caregivers.

4.3. Socialization goals

Socialization goals are qualities that caregivers value and desire to
see in their children as they develop. Research has established the
importance of studying socialization goals as both a means for under-
standing caregiving beliefs and practices and as a window into the
broader cultural contexts of parenting/caregiving (Ng et al., 2012;
LeVine, 2003). Recent work has emphasized the importance of taking a
dimensional and dynamic approach, recognizing that caregiver goals
can change over time, as children develop (Tamis-LeMonda and
Kahana-Kalman, 2009).

4.3.1. Family Culture Matters (FCM)

The Family Culture Matters (FCM) is a Q-sort activity that captures a
caregiver’s values, desires, and socialization goals for their child. The
FCM was adapted for HBCD from a socialization goals measure devel-
oped by Tamis-LeMonda and colleagues (Ng et al., 2012). The caregiver
is asked to sort a set of 15 qualities (e.g., “to be kind,” “to be a leader,”
“to be obedient”) in order of importance to them for their child, with one
blank card to capture any additional important qualities not listed. They
first sort the qualities into three groups of five (very important; impor-
tant; not as important), and then rank order qualities within those
groups. The 15 qualities fall within five broader goal categories:
Achievement, Self-Maximization, Proper Demeaner, Connectedness and
Honesty/Decency. For example, the value “to be obedient” may reflect
cultural constructs such as filial piety, which emphasizes the respect for

5. Domain of assessment: Family and home environment

Research on a child’s family environment has identified key family
that support a child’s achieving age-
and home characteristics
appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills (Evans, 2004; Lehrl
et al., 2020). Home environments that are organized and rich in learning
materials and stimulation, provide ample opportunities for curiosity and
play, provide appropriate supervision and monitoring, and have safe,
predictable routines are associated with positive developmental out-
comes (Bradley and Corwyn, 2002; Shonkoff, 2003; Wachs, 2000;
Whiteside-Mansell et al., 2007). Family relationships that are warm,
responsive, engaging, and cohesive are also associated with more
optimal developmental outcomes across development
from early
childhood into adolescence (Goodrum et al., 2020; Lucia and Breslau,
2006). Conversely, characteristics such as household confusion and
unpredictability have been directly and indirectly linked with poor ex-
ecutive functioning, academic achievement, and socioemotional
adjustment (Andrews et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2005; Larsen and Jordan,
2020; Matheny Jr et al., 1995) even after controlling for socioeconomic
status and parenting practices (Dumas et al., 2005; Evans et al., 2005).
Therefore, assessment of children’s contexts and experiences in the
home was considered a necessary element for inclusion in HBCD. The
final domains included in the protocol were selected because of
cross-cultural evidence of association with child development (Bradley
and Corwyn, 2005). Further, to reduce the potential for bias in assess-
ment, the WG-BEH was thoughtful to select instruments that have
demonstrated utility and validity across various cultural groups in the
US.

5.1. The Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment
(HOME) Inventory

The HOME (Bradley and Caldwell, 1988) measures characteristics of
the household learning environment (e.g., provision of materials and
household organization) and quality of family relationships the child
experiences. The HOME is one of the most widely used measures of the
quality and quantity of support available to a child in the home envi-
ronment and has been used for a wide variety of sociocultural groups
(Bradley, 2015). The HOME-21 is a modified version of the HOME-Short
Form (Bradley et al., 2014; Mott, 2004), which uses multi-response
caregiver reports that were reworded from the original dichotomous
observer ratings.
items from the
Items on the HOME-21 reflect
Infant/Toddler and Early Childhood HOME scales of Acceptance, Vari-
ety, Learning Materials, Language Stimulation, and Physical Environ-
ment. WG-BEH chose the HOME-21 (Lansford et al., 2023) over the
original HOME to reduce overlap with other assessments and reduce the
need for additional training, reliability, and certification. Importantly,
the HOME-21 has been revised to reflect changes in: (1) family
composition and gender roles, where items were reworded to be
gender-neutral and inclusive of diverse family structures, (2) discipline,
where item scoring reflects changes in acceptance of spanking, and (3)
technology, where revisions to the types of devices available in homes
were made and items were added to capture access to information (the
use of a computer in the home and internet access). The tool covers an
age range from infancy through age 17 and has strong content, con-
current and discriminant validity and has been examined for income,
gender, and racial biases (Bradley, 2015; Lansford et al., 2023;
Whiteside-Mansell et al., 2009).

DevelopmentalCognitiveNeuroscience69(2024)1014226R.C. Edwards et al.

5.2. The McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD)

The Family Assessment Device (FAD) measures the structural and
organizational properties of families and patterns of family interactions
(Epstein et al., 1983; Miller et al., 1985). The FAD consists of seven
scales, but to minimize burden, only the short form of the General
Functioning scale (GF6 +) was chosen for use in HBCD as it has strong
correlations with each of the other subscales (Boterhoven de Haan et al.,
2015). This caregiver-report measure assesses the overall healthy
functioning of the family, such as emotional supportiveness between
family members and acceptance of one another. It has strong test-retest,
concurrent, and discriminant validity; has been widely used in both
research and clinical practice; is valid for families with young children
(Staccini et al., 2015), and has high internal reliability (Mansfield et al.,
2015).

as those that measure infant-caregiver attachment security, were
deemed prohibitively difficult to administer in this study’s context,
given the complexity of protocol administration and coding and the
need to conduct lengthy laboratory (e.g., for the Strange Situation
paradigm; Ainsworth et al., 2015) or home visits (the Attachment Q-sort;
Vaughn and Waters, 1990; Waters and Deane, 1985). The Disturbances
of Attachment Interview (Smyke and Zeanah, 1999) and the Attachment
Relationship Inventory (Spruit et al., 2021) were considered, but ulti-
mately excluded because they are either typically administered by
trained clinicians or utilized as part of clinical assessment, with low base
rates of attachment disorders in population-based samples. The Brief
Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA; Briggs-Gowan
et al., 2002) was also considered, but WG-BEH is electing to administer
the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach and Rescorla, 2000) in
future visits for continuity with ABCD.

5.2.1. The Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS)

8. Future visits

The CHAOS assesses household routines, as well as confusion,
disorganization, and noise in the child’s immediate living environment
(Dumas et al., 2005; Matheny Jr et al., 1995; Wilhoit et al., 2021).
Although the original CHAOS scale used a dichotomous true/false
response set (Matheny Jr et al., 1995), recent studies, including a vali-
dated Spanish translation (S´anchez-Mondrag´on and Flores Herrera,
2019), adopted Likert scales to reflect normative nuance in household
chaos (Andrews et al., 2021; Marsh et al., 2020; Wilhoit et al., 2021).
The CHAOS scale has been used mostly with families of infants and
toddlers, but also in studies with school-aged children and adolescents
(Marsh et al., 2020).

6. Pilot testing

Pilot testing the planned protocol was essential for ensuring high
quality data collection and the feasibility and acceptability of the pro-
posed measures with the HBCD population. Piloting also allowed for
refinement of measures prior to main study launch. SMEs were
responsible for evaluating any missingness patterns and determining
whether variability at the item- and scale-level aligned with expecta-
tions. They then reported any errors to the HBCD Data Coordinating
Center (HDCC) and brought any concerns about measure performance to
WG-BEH for discussion.

Piloting of the observational assessments involved iterative refine-
ment. Every site completed at least two pilots of each observational
assessment protocol (i.e., semi-structured play/BI/ERICA-FCM). Pilot
videos were reviewed by SMEs to monitor quality and provide ongoing
training and feedback to sites (e.g., camera placement, adherence to
protocol), as well as to make iterative changes to protocol to enhance
standardization across sites, ease of administration and comfort for
families. Modifications that were made based on piloting included
adjusting the order of tasks (e.g., adding a recovery activity to avoid two
stressful activities back-to-back), streamlining and simplifying caregiver
instructions, and developing revised guidance for managing child
distress.

At the time of this publication, WG-BEH is actively planning for visits
6, 7 and 8 and has proposed several additional measures for piloting. In
the domain of child behavior, these include the CBCL for Ages 1½ (cid:0) 5
(CBCL 1.5–5; Achenbach and Rescorla, 2000) to assess a broad spectrum
of behavioral and emotional problems in young children, the electronic
versions of the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with
Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F; Attar et al., 2023) a widely-used screener for
risk of autism in toddlers, and a modified version of the Preschool Age
Psychiatric Assessment (Egger et al., 2019), a clinical interview with
caregivers to assess child psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. In the
domain of family and home environment, this includes the addition of
the brief Questionnaire of Unpredictability in Childhood (QUIC-5; Davis
& Glynn, 2024). WG-BEH also plans to re-administer many of the
measures from visits 3–5 described in this paper at future visits.

9. Conclusion

The HBCD Study has the potential to elucidate complex mechanisms
of risk and resilience pathways. Characterizing child behavior, the
caregiving environment, and caregiver-child-interactions within a
nuanced developmental context is essential for understanding brain-
behavior associations in early life. Doing so in the context of prenatal
and early adversity is critical, as these exposures can alter develop-
mental trajectories with potential lifelong implications in unknown
ways. Given the goal of the HBCD Study to reveal how child develop-
ment is affected by various adverse and protective social and environ-
mental social exposures, WG-BEH took a rigorous and equitable
approach to ensure the collection of high quality, developmentally
appropriate, and culturally sensitive measures of child behavior,
caregiver-child interactions, and the family and caregiving environ-
ment. Such an approach enhances the likelihood that the findings from
the HBCD Study will maximally inform the development of preventative
approaches to optimize developmental outcomes across early childhood
and, consequently, the lifespan.

7. Other considerations

CRediT authorship contribution statement

There was some content overlap between WG-BEH and WG-Social
and Environmental Determinants (WG-SED), which was tasked with
measuring environmental stressors (Cioffredi et al., this issue), and
WG-Neurocognition and Language (WG-NCL; Kable et al., this issue).
The constructs selected for inclusion by WG-BEH capture elements of the
child, family and home not measured by other workgroups. Many of
these constructs are specific to socioemotional contexts (e.g., emotion-
ally salient situations), and caregiver-child relationships within the
home itself.

Additional constructs and measures were considered by WG-BEH but
ultimately not included in the HBCD protocol. Some assessments, such
