This paper explores a possible connection between neurochemistry and cognitions in eating
disorders (ED). Cognitions play an important role in ED. However, a possible neurochemical origin
of these cognitions has not been explored. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is known as a
disorder of thinking. Extensive neurochemical research conducted on this disorder indicates a
connection between serotonin (5-HT) dysregulation and cognitions in OCD. This study used research
done on OCD as a template to interpret the available research findings in ED and their possible
meaning in terms of neurochemical origin of cognitions in ED. This paper suggests that the
neurochemical and behavioral expression of both ED and OCD occur on a continuum. At one end
ofthe continuum, ED and OCD are expressed through constrained behaviors of an avoidant quality.
This pole is also characterized by high levels of serotonin markers. At the other end, both disorders
are characterized by disinhibited approach behavior. This end of the continuum is characterized by
low levels of 5-HT markers. It is suggested that these levels of 5-HT generate cognitions that may in
turn promote specific behaviors.

INTRODUCTION

In spite of extensive research, the motivation underlying
severe dieting in anorexia nervosa and chaotic eating in
bulimia nervosa is still poorly understood. The clinical litera-
ture indicates that persistent irrational beliefs play a major
role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders
(ED) (Gamer and Bemis 1985). Cognitions could be causal
in the development of ED. However, the origin of these
cognitions is unknown. Neurochemical imbalances have also

been identified in ED (Fava et al 1989), but the possible
connection between these neurochemical anomalies and the
distorted cognitive style found in ED has been left largely
unexplored. The hypothesis that the distorted cognitive pat-
tern seen in ED may be an expression of neurochemical
imbalances is plausible, and could open new avenues in the
treatment ofED. However, exploring a possible neurochemi-
cal origin of cognitions in ED is difficult, mainly because of
the limited access to these patients for physiological research.
Few psychological disorders are known to be primarily
disorders of thinking. In the neurotic range, only obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD) is known as such. Extensive

Neurochenmstry and cognitions in ED and OCD

research has been conducted to explore the possible neuro-
chemical basis ofthe cognitive style in OCD, and a large body
of results is now available on that topic. This is particularly
relevant to the understanding of the relationship between
cognitions and neurochemistry in ED, since several pheno-
menological and neurochemical similarities have been found
between ED patients and OCD patients. It has even been
suggested that EDs are a modern variant ofOCD (Rothenberg
1986, 1988). Thus, in this paper, the research performed on
OCD is intended to be used as a template to explore the link
between cognitions and neurochemistry in ED.

Although these 2 disorders have often been associated
phenomenologically and neurochemically (Hsu et al 1993;
Kaye et al 1993), this paper suggests that both ED and OCD
occur along a continuum. One end of this continuum is
characterized by avoidance-oriented behaviors and the other
end is characterized by high approach behavior. For example,
at the avoidant end ofthe continuum, the individual suffering
from OCD engages in repeated attempts to avoid contamina-
tion, by compulsive washing, or catastrophic consequences
of forgetfulness, by checking. At the other end ofthe contin-
uum, behavior is characterized by a high level ofapproach to
the environment. Here, the individual's goal is to engage in
extreme levels of contact with the environment such as in
recurrent sexual and violent fantasies. The same polarity is
present in ED. At the avoidant end, the individual avoids food
and engages in restriction. At the approach end, the individual
engages in extreme contact with food and ingests large
amounts. At the avoidant end ofthe continuum, ED and OCD
have similar neurochemical profiles generally characterized
by high levels of serotonin. At the approach end, ED and
OCD are generally characterized by low levels of serotonin.
Our working model further suggests that the behavioral ex-
pression of ED may be driven by specific cognitive patterns,
as seems to be the case in OCD. Such parallels would raise
the possibility that, as in OCD, the cognitive style typical of
ED has a biological basis. In this paper, the position that
cognitions are precursors of behavior has been adopted.

The first part of this paper considers the psychometric
relationships between ED and OCD to determine whether or
not ED and OCD are, in fact, phenomenologically related. In
the second part, the extent to which ED and OCD share
neurochemical features is examined to detennine whether or
not there is a similar neurochemistry in these 2 disorders.
Through such an exploration, the authors hope to clarify the
possible contribution ofneurochemistry to the cognitive style
of ED.

PSYCHOMETRIC STUDIES OF ED AND OCD

Generally, psychometric studies comparing ED and OCD
proceed either by assessing the prevalence of comorbidity
between these 2 groups, or by looking at overall psychologi-
cal profiles on general diagnostic instruments such as the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)

(Hathaway and McKinley 1951) and the SCL-90-R
(Derogatis 1983).

Comorbidity

Studies of comorbidity have found a high prevalence of
lifetime diagnosis ofOCD in ED, ranging from 15% (Laessle
et al 1987) to 69% (Hudson et al 1983) in anorexia nervosa
restrictive subtype; and from 8% (Laessle et al 1987) to 33%
in bulimia nervosa (Hudson et al 1987). The wide range in
the prevalence of OCD in anorexia nervosa across studies
may be attributable to the National Institute ofMental Health
Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), the diagnostic instru-
ment used in these studies. This instrument relies somewhat
on the subjectivity ofthe interviewer, which may have influ-
enced the outcome ofthe interview to show high rates ofOCD
in the Hudson et al (1983) study or low levels in the Laessle
et al (1987) study.

Nevertheless, as bulimic symptomatology increases in
ED, OCD prevalence appears to diminish. Hudson et al
(1983) examined 3 categories of ED patients: anorexia ner-
vosa of the restrictive type, anorexia nervosa with bulimia,
and bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence rate of OCD in
the restrictive group was 3 times that of the bulimic group.
The lifetime diagnosis of OCD in patients suffering from
anorexia with bulimic symptoms fell half way between that
of the restrictive and the bulimic group. Laessle et al (1987)
also found lower rates of OCD in patients with bulimia, than
in patients with anorexia and patients suffering from anorexia
with bulimia. This finding suggests a stronger connection
between OCD and anorexia than between OCD and bulimia.
Studies have also been conducted on the prevalence ofED
symptoms in OCD. Pigott et al (1991) found that patients
with OCD had significantly elevated scores on the Eating
Disorder Inventory (Garner et al 1983) in comparison with
those of a healthy control group, although these scores were
also significantly lower than those of patients with eating
disorders patients. However, Joffe and Swinson (1987) found
no differences between the Eating Attitude Test (Gamer and
Garfinkel 1980) scores ofobsessive-compulsive patients and
those of normal control subjects. The difference between
these 2 studies cannot be attributed to differential gender
representation. In both studies, male and female subjects
were approximately equally represented. However, this dif-
ference might be attributable to the use of different scales
(EDI versus EAT), orto the fact that the sample used in Pigott
et al (1991) included about 20% ofpatients whose obsession
or compulsion were directly related to their body shape and
appearance. No such patients were included in the study
conducted by Joffe and Swinson (1987). In any case, the
number of studies conducted assessing the prevalence of ED
in OCD is still too small to allow one to establish whether the
correspondence between OCD and ED is bidirectional or
unidirectional. Evidence collected so far suggests that OCD

38

is common in ED but there is still insufficient evidence to
conclude that the reciprocal proposition is also true.

Studies of comorbidity (Hudson et al 1983; Hudson et al
1987; Laessle et al 1987) have also found a higher prevalence
of affective disorders in ED than of any other concurrent
disorders. Generally, OCD is the second most prevalent
comorbid disorder for anorexia nervosa restrictive type
(Hudson et al 1983; Laessle et al 1987), and the third for both
anorexia nervosa with bulimia, and bulimia (Hudson et al
1983; Hudson et al 1987; Laessle et al 1987). While this
finding may seem to indicate a stronger association between
affective disorders and ED than between OCD and ED, it
should be noted that affective disorders are also more preva-
lent than OCD in the general population. The prevalence of
lifetime diagnosis of affective disorders in the general popu-
lation is approximately 13% (DSM-IV 1994) compared to
70% (Hudson et al 1983, 1987; Laessle et al 1987) in ED.
Affective disorders are thus approximately 7 times more
prevalent in ED than in the general population. However, the
lifetime prevalence of OCD in the general population has
been estimated to be 2.5% to 3% (Robins et al 1984; Bland
et al 1988; Kamo et al 1988), without exclusion criteria. Rates
with hierarchical exclusions are consistently two-thirds the
rates without exclusions (Robins et al 1984). Therefore, the
lifetime prevalence of OCD can safely be assumed to be
approximately 2% in the general population compared to
30% (Hudson et al 1983, 1987; Laessle et al 1987) in ED, a
15-fold increase. Thus, compared to rates found in the general
population, rates of OCD in ED are more elevated than rates
of affective disorders in ED.

It is reasonable to argue that the presence of obsessive-
compulsive symptoms in ED are secondary to starvation and
chaotic eating rather than primary. However, studies compar-
ing the personality and psychological functioning of ED
patients before and after treatment show that, although
obsessive-compulsive symptoms improve after treatment,
recovered patients still display high levels of obsessive-
compulsive traits and symptoms. Using the Middlesex Hos-
pital Questionnaire (Crown and Crisp 1966), Stonehill and
Crisp (1977) found patients with anorexia before treatment
to have significantly higher obsessional scores than healthy
controls. Although these scores improved somewhat after
restoration of body weight, they were not significantly dif-
ferent from pretreatment scores. At follow-up, 4 to 7 years
later, obsessional scores returned to pretreatment levels al-
though these results are difficult to interpret because approxi-
mately halfofthe patients were symptomatic at that point. In
a retrospective study of patients with anorexia to determine
premorbid personality traits, Beumont et al (1976) found that
76% ofthe patients with anorexia with restrictive features had
premorbid obsessional traits compared to 57% of patients
suffering from anorexia with bulimic features. Strober (1980)
compared the pretreatment Leyton Obsessional Inventory
(Cooper 1970) scores of patients suffering from anorexia
with and without bulimia with those ofdepressed patients and

patients with personality disorders. Patients with anorexia
had significantly higher obsessional symptoms and character
traits than these other 2 groups of patients. Post-treatment
obsessional symptomatology was significantly lower but
changes in trait obsessionality after treatment were negligible
and not significant.

Although these data may suffer from many methodologi-
cal problems, including the retrospective nature of the
reports, they do provide convergent evidence of an elevated
prevalence of obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms in
ED, and particularly in anorexia. Despite the fact that
obsessive-compulsive traits and symptoms do not refer to the
same diagnostic entity and are not always convergent (Joffe
et al 1988; Black et al 1989; Baer et al 1990; Mavissakalian
et al 1990), there is some evidence that traits and symptoms
are highly correlated and that individuals with obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder are more likely to have OCD
and vice versa (Rasmussen and Tsuang 1984, 1986; Lenane
et al 1990; Baer and Jenike 1992; Black et al 1993). It is, thus,
reasonable to suggest that, although starvation and dietary
chaos may contribute to the expression of obsessive-
compulsive symptoms, ED patients are predisposed to OCD
because oftheir premorbid obsessive-compulsive personality
style.

Psychometric profile

Studies ofpsychometric profiles have found OCD and ED
patients to have many similarities. OCD and ED patients have
very similar MMPI profiles (Bulik et al 1992) and are similar
on instruments assessing depression (Solyom et al 1982). In
addition, OCD and ED patients are comparable in their level
of general anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms
(Pigott et al 1991; Solyom et al 1982), and are similar on the
anxiety-related items of the SCL-90-R (obsessive-
compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and phobic anxiety) but not
on items unrelated to anxiety such as psychotism and inter-
personal sensitivity (Bulik et al 1992). These findings suggest
that OCD and ED share common dysfunctions which may
render such patients more susceptible to anxiety symptoms.

STUDIES OF SEROTONIN IN OCD AND ED

Neurochemical studies of OCD have revealed a dysregu-
lation of serotonin functions which is believed to be an
important contributor to the disorder (Barr et al 1992).
Because OCD is primarily a disorder of thinking, this dys-
regulation suggests that the cognitive style characteristic of
OCD could be caused by a 5-HT dysregulation. ED patients
have also been shown to have dysregulated 5-HT functions
(Leibowitz 1990). Although these data have generally been
approached from the point of view of the relevance of 5-HT
to mood disorders and eating behavior itself (Anderson and
Kennedy 1992), there might also be a connection between
5-HT functions and unusual thinking patterns in ED. To

investigate this possibility, studies of serotonergic functions
in OCD will first be reviewed, followed by studies of the
same functions in ED.

Serotonin studies in OCD

Three main methods have been used to study 5-HT
functions in OCD: 1. drug response data; 2. peripheral mark-
ers of 5-HT functions; and 3. neuroendocrine and behavioral
responses to pharmacologic challenges. Nonserotonin selec-
tive antidepressant treatments for OCD have been tried in the
past but met with very limited success (Thoren et al 1980;
Ananth et al 1981; Insel et al 1983; Zohar et al 1987; Leonard
et al 1988). However, potent and selective 5-HT reuptake
inhibitors yielded positive results, stirring a new interest in a
possible serotonin basis ofOCD (Goodman et al 1990). Thus,
drug response studies preceded the assessment of5-HT func-
tions in OCD. The latter were done in order to clarify the
mechanism of action of serotonergic antidepressants in
OCD.
Drug response data in OCD

The efficacy ofserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in the
treatment of OCD has been extensively demonstrated.
Clomipramine (CMI) has been studied the most, and has
consistently yielded positive results, suggesting an involve-
ment of 5-HT in OCD. However, the metabolism of CMI to
desmethylclomipramine raised doubts about the primary in-
volvement of 5-HT in OCD, since this metabolite has norad-
renergic reuptake properties (Barr et al 1992). But selective
SRIs such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and sertraline also
proved to be ofhigh efficacy in the treatment ofOCD (Greist
et al 1995), supporting the central role of 5-HT reuptake
inhibition in clomipramine's antiobsessional effects. Further-
more, desipramine, a noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, was
also tested to verify any involvement of norepinephrine in
OCD. In all studies (Zohar and Insel 1987; Leonard et al
1988; Goodman et al 1990), desipramine was found to be
inferior to 5-HT agents with only 10% ofpatients responding
to the drug, compared to 52% of patients responding to
fluvoxamine, for example (Goodman et al 1990). Finally,
preliminary reports showed that patients resistant to treat-
ment with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors improved after fenflu-
ramine augmentation (Hollander et al 1990), and in a case
report, Rasmussen (1984), showed that one patient improved
after tryptophan augmentation.

Drug response data supporting an involvement of5-HT in
OCD were also collected through an animal model of OCD:
canine acral lick. When affected with this condition, dogs
compulsively lick their front paws and flanks, inflicting
injuries upon themselves that are sometimes serious enough
to require euthanasia. This condition is notoriously resistant
to treatment. Clomipramine and fluoxetine were found to be
ofequivalent efficacy in the treatment ofthis disorder, while
sertraline was slightly less effective (Rapoport et al 1992).

This model has specific interest, since the dogs' response to
the drugs was very similar to that of humans. The doses per
kilogram, percentage of improvement (as rated by owners),
and latency of response to treatment in dogs was equivalent
to that found in the treatment ofhuman patients (Rapoport et
al 1992).

It could be argued that the efficacy ofSRIs in the treatment
of OCD is mediated by the alleviation of depression rather
than through a neurological mechanism specific to OCD.
However, that the beneficial effect of 5-HT antidepressants
in OCD is distinct from their antidepressant effect is demon-
strated by the fact that obsessive-compulsive symptoms im-
prove in OCD patients taking these drugs, whether or not they
had depression when treatment was initiated (Katz and
DeVeaugh-Geis 1990; Goodman et al 1992). In addition, the
profile of action of these drugs in these 2 disorders is differ-
ent. The action ofantidepressants in OCD takes much longer
than in depression: 4 to 6 weeks in depression versus 8 to
12 weeks in OCD (Goodman et al 1992). The therapeutic
doses to treat OCD are much higher than in depression. For
example, it is generally agreed that, for depression, the opti-
mal fluoxetine dose is 20 mg per day (Altamura et al 1988).
However, the optimal fluoxetine dose for OCD is 60 mg per
day (Greist et al 1995). Similarly, paroxetine 10 mg to 50 mg
per day is used in depression (Nemeroff 1994), whereas
60 mg per day is preferred for OCD (Kaye and Dancu 1994).
The maximum sertraline dose for depression is 200 mg per
day (Chouinard et al 1990), whereas this dose is optimal for
OCD (Greist et al 1995).

Furthermore, the effect of antidepressants in OCD is not
as profound as in depression; there is a graded response in
OCD, where patients show some improvement but do not
become completely free ofsymptoms (Goodman et al 1990).
The rate ofresponse is lower in OCD than in depression: 40%
to 60% of patients are responders in OCD (Goodman et al
1992). The rate of relapse in OCD can be as high as 90%
within 2 months after discontinuation oftreatment (Pato et al
1988), which is much higher than in depression. Substitution
ofCMI for desipramine yields a similar relapse rate (Leonard
et al 1991).

In summary, drug response data suggest a definitive but
complex involvement of the serotonergic system in OCD.
Many aspects of the action of SRIs in OCD remain to be
clarified. For example, the physiological effects of SRIs at
the cellular level are visible within hours after initiation of
the medication (Barr et al 1992), but the behavioral effects
take weeks to appear. Although a variety of neurochemical
changes may underlie this effect, downregulation of 5-HT
receptors has been proposed as a mechanism of action. For
example, chronic treatment with fluoxetine has been shown
to cause an overall downregulation of 5-HTI and 5-HT2
receptors in several areas of the brain (Wamsley et al 1987),
and to downregulate presynaptic terminal autoreceptors in
the hippocampus (Blier et al 1988). Long-term treatmentwith
fluoxetine has also been found to downregulate

40

somatodendritic receptors in the nucleus raphe dorsalis with-
out affecting 5-HTIA receptors density in postsynaptic re-
gions (Welner et al 1989). The evidence concerning
fluoxetine is consistent with several studies showing that
citalopram, indalpine, and zimelidine induce a desensitiza-
tion of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the nucleus raphe dorsalis
(Blier and de Montigny 1983; Blier et al 1984; Chaput et al
1986). Another explanation for the delayed behavioral effects
of SRIs is that the effects ofthese medications are not limited
to the serotonergic system, but rather depend on the integra-
tion ofdownstream modifications in a variety ofneurochemi-
cal systems. This integration may require more time than the
modification of one single system, thus explaining the de-
layed behavioral effect.
Peripheral markers in OCD

The investigation of peripheral markers of serotonergic
functions in OCD patients can be roughly divided into cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) studies and blood platelet studies. CSF
studies will be reviewed first.

Cerebrospinalfluid studies in OCD: The measurement of
CSF 5-HT is pertinent to the study of serotonergic functions
in that it is believed to reflect central levels of serotonin.
Because CSF levels of 5-HT are too low to be meaningfully
measured, studies of serotonin activity via the CSF usually
assess the concentration of 5-HIAA, a major metabolite of
5-HT. The studies reviewed here were conducted with
patients who had been free ofdrugs for a minimum of3 weeks
to 4 weeks. Two studies have shown significantly elevated
CSF levels of5-HIAA in OCD patients compared to controls
(Insel et al 1985; Kruesi et al 1990). One study found elevated
5-HIAA in OCD patients compared to controls but this
difference was not significant (Thoren et al 1980). Another
study found no differences (Lydiard et al 1990), and one
study of2 patients who had violent obsessive thoughts found
lower levels of 5-HIAA than normal (Leckman et al 1990).
The number of studies reported above is small, and their
findings may appear contradictory. However, careful exami-
nation reveals an interesting pattern. While the classic OCD
shows a tedious thinking process and behavior oriented
towards avoidance, and is associated with high levels ofCSF
5-HIAA, recurrent desire to or fear of losing control is
associated with low levels ofthis metabolite. This finding is
consistent with the fact that serotonin depletion promotes
approach behavior in animals, and serotonin enhancement
results in increased behavioral avoidance (Spoont 1992). It
may be that high levels of serotonin are associated with
avoidant behaviors such as in classic symptoms of OCD
while low levels ofthis neurotransmitter would be associated
with disinhibited approach behavior such as in violent obses-
sive thoughts. Low levels of CSF 5-HIAA have also been
found in violent and impulsive patients (Linnoila et al 1983;
van Praag 1983; Virkkunen et al 1987; Virkkunen et al 1994).
In normal volunteers, Roy et al (1988) found a significant
negative correlation between CSF levels of 5-HIAA and

scores on the "urge to act out hostility" subscale of the
Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ)
(Foulds 1965). The converging sources of evidence indicate
an association between low levels of 5-HT and disinhibited
approach behavior. This evidence suggests that subcategories
ofOCD may have different physiologies in which high levels
of5-HT are associated with avoidance-oriented behavior and
low levels are associated with approach behavior.

Further evidence indicating a relationship between levels
of 5-HT, as measured through 5-HIAA, and OCD comes
from the fact that, after treatment with CMI, CSF levels of
5-HIAA are significantly decreased (Altemus et al 1994).
Improvement in OCD symptoms has been found to be sig-
nificantly and negatively correlated with decreasing levels of
CSF 5-HIAA (Thoren et al 1980).

Bloodplatelet studies in OCD: The rationale for the stud-
ies of blood platelets in OCD is that platelets model central
5-HT activity. Blood platelets also store and release 5-HT and
are considered to be a modulator of 5-HT uptake (Barr et al
1992). [3H]-imipramine binding may serve as a model for
serotonergic functions (Murphy et al 1989b). The studies
reviewed here were conducted with patients who had been
free of drugs for a minimum of 4 weeks. Only one study had
an abstinence period of 2 weeks (Black et al 1990), and in
another study, subjects had never received any psychotropic
medication (Marazziti et al 1992). Compared to normal sub-
jects, some studies show fewer [3H]-imipramine binding sites
(Bmax) in OCD (Weizman et al 1986; Bastani et al 1991;
Marazziti et al 1992), and others found no differences (Insel
et al 1985; Black et al 1990; Kim et al 1991; Vitiello et al
1991; Won Kim et al 1991). Lower affinity for 5-HT uptake
(Km) was found in only one study (Bastani et al 1991) and
was normal in the others (Marazziti et al 1992; Weizinan et
al 1986a). No differences were found in the affinity for
[3H]-imipramine binding (Kd). Vitiello et al (1991) found
increased uptake velocity of 5-HT (Vm.) in OCD patients
compared to controls.

The evidence provided by the study of blood platelets is
inconclusive. Reduced [3H]-imipramine binding sites are
indicative of reduced 5-HT activity (Bastani et al 1991;
Marazziti et al 1992). However, increased uptake velocity of
5-HT (Vmax) in OCD patients is indicative of a possibly
hyperactive serotonergic system (Vitiello et al 1991). These
contradictory results might be clarified by the fact that de-
pressed patients also exhibit reduced density of
[3H]-imipramine binding sites (B.ax). Therefore, findings
showing reduced 5-HT activity may be attributable to differ-
ing prevalence of concurrent depression between samples of
OCD patients (Barr et al 1992). Close examination of the
above-mentioned studies shows that inclusion criteria for
patient groups were more lenient in studies that have found
lower Bmax values in OCD patients than in control groups
(Weizman et al 1986; Bastani et al 1991; Marazziti et al
1992). These studies may have included more patients with
a history of depression or actual low levels of depression.

Blood platelet studies are inconclusive. However, except
for one study which did not find a difference between OCD
patients and normal subjects (Lydiard et al 1990), cerebro-
spinal fluid studies have shown OCD patients with classic
symptoms to have clearly elevated levels of CSF 5-HIAA
(Insel et al 1985; Kruesi et al 1990), or to show a trend in this
direction (Thoren et al 1980). If indeed CSF levels of this
metabolite reflect brain levels of 5-HT, these results would
indicate that OCD patients with classic symptoms have high
levels of central serotonin. The possibility that these patients
have high levels of central 5-HT activity has much intuitive
appeal in view of the avoidant quality oftheir behavior.

Pharmacologic challenges in OCD

Pharmacologic challenges in OCD are conducted in an
effort to identify more precisely what neurochemical systems
are implicated in the positive response of these patients to
SRIs. The most widely used compound in pharmacologic
challenge in OCD is m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), a
trazodone metabolite. m-CPP is mostly an agonist of 5-HT
receptors at both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Its greatest
affinity is for the 5-HTic receptors (now denoted 5-HT2c
receptors, Hoyer et al 1994), for which it is an agonist, and
5-HT3 receptors, for which it is an antagonist, but it also
interacts with several other 5-HT receptors (Hollander et al
1992). In normal subjects, m-CPP induces an increase in body
temperature and an elevation in serum prolactin and cortisol
(Mueller et al 1985a; Mueller et al 1985b). That these physi-
ological responses are mediated by the 5-HT system has been
demonstrated by the fact that administration of the 5-HT
antagonist metergoline blocks them (Mueller et al 1986).
m-CPP also produces behavioral effects in normal subjects,
as evidenced by increased anxiety with intravenous infusion
(Mueller et al 1986) but not with oral doses (Kahn et al 1990).
Investigation of behavioral responses to m-CPP in OCD
patients has yielded fairly consistent results. OCD patients
experience an increase in obsessive-compulsive symptoms in
responses to oral doses of m-CPP (Zohar and Insel 1987;
Zohar et al 1987; Hollander et al 1991; Pigott et al 1991;
Hollander et al 1992), but fail to show the same response with
intravenous doses (Charney et al 1988). Although the reason
for this sensitivity to route of administration is unclear, these
results suggest serotonergic hypersensitivity in OCD
patients. The involvement ofthe 5-HT system in the response
of OCD patients to m-CPP is further confmned by the fact
that the behavioral effects of m-CPP in OCD patients are
blocked after pretreatment with CMI (Zohar et al 1988),
fluoxetine (Hollander et al 1991), and metergoline (Pigott et
al 1991).

The behavioral effects ofm-CPP suggest that some recep-
tors activated by this compound are hyper-responsive in OCD
patients. The fact that this response is curtailed by pretreat-
ment with SRIs further suggests that SRI medications down-
regulate some receptors specifically associated with OCD.

Summary ofserotonin disturbances in OCD

The evidence provided by the investigation ofperipheral
markers of 5-HT functions, and from pharmacologic chal-
lenges, converges to indicate elevated 5-HT functions in
classic symptoms ofOCD (Thoren et al 1980; Insel et al 1985;
Zohar et al 1988; Kruesi et al 1990), and lowered serotonin
functions in OCD characterized by urges of an impulsive
nature (Leckman et al 1990). Since OCD is primarily a
disorder ofthinking, dysregulations ofthe 5-HT system could
contribute to a cognitive style which in turn would induce
behaviors typical of the 2 poles of the disorder. At one end,
hyperserotonergic functions could be associated with cogni-
tions resulting in avoidance behavior. At the other end,
hyposerotonergic functions could be associated with cogni-
tions resulting in high approach behavior.

Serotonin studies in ED

Several neurotransmitters have been implicated in the
control offeeding and are believed to play a role in ED. Since
serotonin has been shown to mediate and possibly control
satiety (Leibowitz 1990), it has been explored for a possible
contribution to ED. Three main methods are used to study
5-HT functions: 1. measures of concentration of neurotrans-
mitter and metabolites in the CSF; 2. studies of blood plate-
lets; and 3. pharmacologic challenge studies. In all studies of
peripheral markers ofserotonin in ED, subjects were ordinar-
ily abstinent from drugs for at least 4 weeks, except in one
study where subjects were abstinent from drugs for only one
week (Gerner et al 1984), and in 4 studies in which drug
abstinence was not specified (Kaye et al 1984a; Kaye et al
1984b; Hallman et al 1990; Hassanyeh and Marshall 1991).
Peripheral markers in ED

Cerebrospinalfluid studies in anorexia nervosa: A com-
plete understanding of the investigation of 5-HIAA in ano-
rexia nervosa relies on the distinction between stages of the
disorder (before and after weight recovery) and the extent of
the presence ofbulimic symptoms. Kaye et al (1984b) found
levels of 5-HIAA to be low in underweight patients with
anorexia, but to return to normal with weight recovery. More
detailed investigation ofthe same patients showed that, after
weight recovery, patients with anorexia ofthe restrictive type
had levels of 5-HIAA that were higher than those of normal
subjects (Kaye et al 1984a). Kaye et al (1988) also found that
underweight patients with anorexia had levels of CSF
5-HIAA that were lower than those ofnormals but that, after
recent weight restoration, these patients had CSF 5-HIAA
values that were similar to those of nonnal subjects. Gerner
et al (1984) found no differences in CSF levels of 5-HLAA
between patients with anorexia and normal control subjects.
However, patients in this study had already undergone some
degree of refeeding and weight gain, which renders these
results compatible with the finding of normalization of CSF
5-HIAA after refeeding. Finally, patients with anorexia

42

whose weight had been restored for at least 6 months were
found to have CSF 5-HIAA levels that were significantly
higher than those of normal subjects (Kaye et al 1991). This
result indicates elevated serotonin activity (Kaye and Weltzin
1991), and is of particular interest since, after long-term
weight restoration, any disturbance found in monoaminergic
activity could be trait related rather than caused by poor
nutrition or weight loss (Kaye et al 1991). Finally, weight-
restored patients with anorexia of the restrictive type were
found to have CSF 5-HIAA values that were higher than
those of weight-restored patients suffering from anorexia
with bulimia (Kaye et al 1984a). In summary, underweight
patients with anorexia show lower levels of 5-HIAA than
those of normal subjects. Newly weight-restored patients
with anorexia have normal levels of 5-HIAA. However,
long-term weight-restored patients with anorexia show ele-
vated levels of5-HIAA compared to weight-restored patients
suffering from anorexia with bulimia and normal subjects.
These findings suggest that patients with anorexia of the
restrictive type may have had elevated premorbid serotoner-
gic activity.

Cerebrospinal fluid studies in bulimia nervosa: A rela-
tively consistent pattern emerges from the study of CSF
5-HIAA in bulimia nervosa. One study found weight-
restored anorexics with bulimia to have significantly lower
levels of5-HIAA than weight-restored patients with anorexia
ofthe restrictive type and normal subjects (Kaye et al 1984a).
One study found only nonsignificantly lower levels of
5-HIAA in patients with bulimia compared to healthy control
subjects (Kaye et al 1990).

Within patients with bulimia, lower levels of 5-HIAA are
associated with a more severe symptomatology (Jimerson et
al 1988). Jimerson et al (1988) found that patients having
more than 14 binge episodes per week (high binge frequency)
had 5-HIAA levels that were significantly lower than those
ofnormal subjects and ofpatients who had 14 or fewer binge
episodes per week (low binge frequency). It is thus possible
that the Kaye et al (1990) study included amajority ofpatients
with low binge frequency. Despite this slight inconsistency,
studies of CSF 5-HIAA indicate that low serotonergic activ-
ity is related to bulimic symptomatology while high seroton-
ergic activity appears related to a restrictive eating style.

Bloodplatelets in ED: Platelet serotonin uptake has been
found to be comparable between patients with anorexa and
normal subjects (Weizman et al 1986b; Zemishlany et al
1987), although one study reported low [3H]-imipramine
binding (Bmaxc) in patients suffering from anorexia with
weight loss (Weizman et al 1986b). Whole blood 5-HT has
been found to be higher in patients with anorexia nervosa
compared with normal subjects (Hassanyeh and Marshall
1991), which is compatible with the possibility ofhypersero-
tonergic functions in anorexia nervosa (Hassanyeh and
Marshall 1991). Patients with bulimia were shown to have an
increase in platelet serotonin uptake (Goldbloom et al 1990),
which is consistent with decreased availability ofbrain 5-HT

for neurotransmission (Goldbloom and Garfinkel 1990). One
study found no differences between patients with bulimia and
normal subjects in platelet serotonin uptake (Hallman et al
1990). However, the results of this last study are difficult to
interpret because of the lack of information provided on the
composition ofthe patient group. Another study found fewer
[3H]-imipramine binding sites (Bm.) in patients with bulimia
compared to normal subjects (Marazziti et al 1988), which is
also compatible with reduced 5-HT activity.
Pharmacologic challenges in ED

To date, there is only one published study examining the
effects of m-CPP on food intake in humans (Brewerton et al
1994). This study showed a decreased food intake in normal
subjects, and a quasi significant trend for patients with bu-
limia to decrease their food intake after m-CPP. There was
also an intriguing trend for patients with bulimia, but not for
control subjects, to diminish their protein consumption after
m-CPP. In addition, normal subjects reduced their fat intake
after m-CPP, but patients with bulimia failed to do so. Al-
though patients with bulimia and control subjects reacted
similarly to m-CPP for the most part, the decreased food
intake in patients with bulimia is consistent with the sugges-
tion that this group has lower serotonergic functions than
normal subjects.
Summary ofserotonin disturbances in ED

Studies of 5-HT functions in ED are sparse, particularly
studies ofpatients with anorexia ofthe restrictive type. How-
ever, the evidence available indicates that, after long-term
weight restoration, these patients have higher levels of 5-HT
markers than weight-restored patients suffering from ano-
rexia with bulimia, patients with symptoms of bulimia, and
normal subjects. This physiological difference is accompa-
nied by consistent food avoidance in the active phase of
anorexia of the restrictive type. Conversely, patients with
bulimic features such as anorexics with bulimia are charac-
terized by episodes of disinhibited eating and have low indi-
cators of 5-HT, both in periods ofremission and in the active
phase ofthe disorder. Patients with bulimia who are sympto-
matic are found to have slightly lower levels of 5-HIAA than
normal subjects. In summary, patients of the restrictive and
the bulimic groups have CSF levels of 5-HIAA that differ
from the normal population, with the restrictive group having
higher levels and the bulimic group having lower levels. To
the extent that weight-restored patients are behaviorally nor-
malized, these data suggest that the differences found
between them may be trait related rather than exclusively
state driven. Furthermore, the eating behavior of these
2 populations closely follows what would be expected of
their respective neurochemistry. High levels ofCSF 5-HIAA
in the restrictive group correspond to food avoidance and low
levels in the bulimic group are accompanied by episodes of
disinhibited eating. Intermediate levels of 5-HT markers
correspond to an intermediate eating style in the normal

population when compared to the style of the restrictive and
the bulimic groups. Clearly, dysregulated 5-HT functions,
that is, elevated and lowered 5-HT functions, are involved in
ED.

Despite the coherence of behavioral and physiological
observations in ED, the direction ofcausality is still unclear.
High methodological constraints are imposed on studies of
ED patients. Given the difficulties ofprospectively studying
anorexia and bulimia to investigate premorbid or symptom-
free periods, patients are studied either while symptomatic or
when briefly or partially recovered. It is not possible to
evaluate the extent to which the recovered ED patient is
physiologically similar to her premorbid state. Symptomatic
phases may have lasting impacts and the physiology ofthese
patients, once recovered, may not be completely comparable
to their premorbid physiology. It is, thus, not possible to
establish a causal link by which high or low levels of 5-HT
would contribute to the onset of either anorexia or bulimia.
However, this typical neurochemistry, whether a cause or an
effect, could have an impact on the cognitive and behavioral
style ofthe patients and could contribute to the promotion of
either food approach or avoidance.

DISCUSSION

This review suggests that serotonin plays a role in both
OCD and ED. The evidence for serotonin in OCD comes
from drug response data, the results of studies of peripheral
markers, and pharmacologic challenges. Overall, indicators
of 5-HT functions are elevated in OCD involving avoidance-
oriented behavior such as washing and checking. In contrast,
indicators of 5-HT functions are lower than normal in OCD
involving disinhibited approach behaviors such as recurrent
violent or inappropriate thoughts. Paralleling these findings,
a similar trend is observed in ED. Indicators of 5-HT func-
tions are elevated in ED associated with food avoidance, as
in anorexia restrictive type. In contrast, these markers are
lower than normal in ED characterized by episodes of impul-
sive and disinhibited eating behavior, as in bulimia. This
pattern is further confirmed by the fact that, within anorexia,
the presence of bulimic symptoms is associated with CSF
levels of5-HIAA that are lower than in the absence ofbulimic
symptoms. Furthermore, the severity ofbulimic symptoms is
negatively associated with CSF levels of 5-HIAA; more
frequent binges are associated with lower CSF 5-HIAA.
Patients with anorexia also tend to have more obsessive-com-
pulsive features than patients with bulimia who are generally
more disinhibited and impulsive than normal (Johnson et al
1988).

These parallels suggest that both OCD and ED can be
placed on a continuum where at one end, the syndromes are
characterized by avoidance (e.g., of food or contamination)
and at the other end, they are characterized by insufficient
inhibition and high approach (e.g., binge eating or violent and
socially inappropriate thoughts). For both disorders, each end

of this continuum is associated with abnormal serotonin
functions: elevated for the avoidant end, and lowered for the
approach end. Thus, even though ED and OCD are distinct
disorders, they may share a common 5-HT dysregulation
with high levels of 5-HT associated with anorexia nervosa of
the restrictive type and classical symptoms of OCD such as
checking and washing, and low levels associated with bu-
limia and a subcategory of OCD marked by feelings of
impulsivity and lack of inhibition. This paper further raises
the possibility that dysregulated 5-HT functions mediate
specific cognitive styles such that, in ED and OCD, high
5-HT activity generates cognitions leading to avoidance be-
havior, and low 5-HT activity generates cognitions resulting
in high approach behavior.

One important question is: why should the neurochemical
imbalance described above lead to disturbed eating patterns
as in the case of ED, or to disturbed behavioral control as in
the case of OCD? Part ofthe answer could lie in the fact that,
although OCD and ED have common 5-HT dysregulations,
the full neurochemical profiles of these 2 disorders are dif-
ferent. EDs are characterized by many other neurochemical
imbalances that are relevant to feeding (Fava et al 1989) and
are not necessarily present in OCD. These other neurochemi-
cal imbalances may lead individuals with 5-HT dysregulation
to develop eating symptomatology ratherthan OC symptoms.
Thus, although ED and OCD may overlap with regard to
serotonergic dysregulations, the neurochemical network un-
derlying these 2 disorders is apparently different enough to
result in distinct disorders.

While there appears to be a connection between 5-HT,
OCD, and ED, the nature of this connection is complicated
by the numerous receptors in the 5-HT system (Hoyer et al
1994). OCD is classified within the anxiety disorder family
(DSM-IV). Both eating and anxiety involve multiple and
common receptors. Appetite is regulated by 5-HTIA, 5-HTIB
(ID in humans), and 5-HT2 (Montgomery and Fineberg
1989). Anxiety involves 5-HTIA and 5-HT2 receptors
(Charney et al 1990; Eison and Eison 1994), and there is
preliminary evidence for an involvement of 5-HT3 receptors
in animals (Eison 1994) and in humans (Lecrubier et al 1990).
The way these receptors interact with each other has yet to be
clarified. It is possible that, in ED, a specific integration of
anxiety and appetite-related receptors occurs, accounting for
the presence of OC and eating symptoms within one family
of disorders.

Similar patterns of response to drugs which influence
5-HT availability could help to clarify the connection
between OCD and ED. While SRIs are not systematically
used as an exploratory tool of 5-HT functions in ED, they
have been studied as a possible alternative to traditional
antidepressant treatment because they cause fewer adverse
side effects (Gwirtsman et al 1990; Fluoxetine bulimia ner-
vosa collaborative group 1992).Some understanding of5-HT
functions in ED can be drawn from these studies. Patients
with anorexia who were treated with CMI did not gain more

44

weight or gain it more rapidly than patients who were treated
with placebo. However, these patients had better post-
treatment weight maintenance than patients who received
placebo (Lacey and Crisp 1980). This result may indicate
lowered obsessive preoccupations with thinness. In addition,
patients with anorexia of the restrictive type were found to
have a better response to drugs with serotonergic properties
(cyproheptadine and fluoxetine) than patients suffering from
anorexia with bulimia or patients with bulimia (Halmi et al
1986; Kaye et al 1991). These findings are interesting in that
they parallel drug response data in OCD. Both anorexia of
the restrictive type and classic OCD appear to have elevated
5-HT functions, and both respond favorably to serotonin-
enhancing drugs.

With respect to bulimia, antidepressants in general are
effective, regardless of their specific target monoamine
(Bond et al 1986; Fluoxetine bulimia nervosa collaborative
group 1992). This may occur because, among other effects,
they elevate central 5-HT levels. The administration of 5-HT
antagonists concurrently with tricyclic or MAO antidepres-
sants could help clarify this question. For example, the ad-
ministration ofmetergoline concurrently with clomipramine
in OCD patients has been shown to worsen OC symptoms
(Benkelfat et al 1989), which supports the involvement of
5-HT in this disorder. Similarly, the effect of a 5-HT antago-
nist on bulimia nervosa symptomatology in patients receiv-
ing antidepressant medication could also contribute to clarify
the role of 5-HT in this disorder.

In summary, a serotonin connection between OCD and
ED may exist as shown by the pattern of 5-HT functions at
both ends of these disorders; avoidance-oriented OCD and
anorexia ofthe restrictive type have high 5-HT functions, and
high approach OCD and bulimia have low 5-HT functions.
The thinking patterns at both ends ofthe 5-HT continuum are
opposite in terms of degree of intended avoidance, and may
be driven by serotonergic functions. Further study of this
question is important since, for both OCD and ED, cognitions
appear to be a major determinant of behavior.

Some specific hypotheses can be derived from the above
reasoning and serve as guides to the exploration of seroton-
ergic functions in OCD and ED. For example, if, in fact, low
levels of 5-HT are associated with cognitions and behaviors
characterized by disinhibited approach, the obsessive-com-
pulsive symptoms of patients with bulimia should not be
avoidance-oriented as much as those of patients with ano-
rexia ofthe restrictive type. Patients with bulimia should have
obsessive-compulsive symptoms similar to those found in
OCD patients with low peripheral indices of 5-HT, that is,
explosive, disinhibited thoughts rather than symptoms such
as washing and checking. In other words, the specific phe-
nomenology of the OC symptoms of patients with bulimia
should differ from that of patients with anorexia of the
restrictive type and more specifically, be less avoidance-
oriented.

Finally, the results of the studies reviewed above are not
always perfectly consistent (as can be seen, for example, in
the studies ofCSF 5-HIAA in OCD). Conclusions are drawn
despite these imperfections. The goal of this paper is to
suggest a possible new understanding of OCD and ED based
on elements ofthe literature that may still be tentative at this
point. We have attempted to develop a working model to
generate new hypotheses and research in this field. Through
such research, some ofthese inconsistencies may be resolved
to reveal findings that may further our understanding of ED
and OCD. For example, our working model suggests that
studies failing to find differences in the levels of CSF
5-HIAA between OCD patients and normal subjects could
have included OCD patients experiencing violent fantasies.
Such patients with low levels of 5-HLAA may mask the
differences between normal subjects and OCD patients with
classic symptoms of OCD who display high levels of this
metabolite. To explore these questions, research explicitly
differentiating OCD patients on the basis ofthe phenomenol-
ogy oftheir obsessions is needed.
