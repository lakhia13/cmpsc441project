Abstract: Background: Dissociative disorders encompass loss of integration in essential functions
such as memory, consciousness, perception, motor control, and identity. Nevertheless, neuroimaging
studies, albeit scarce, have suggested the existence of particular brain activation patterns in patients
belonging to this diagnostic category. The aim of this review is to identify the main functional
neuroimaging correlates of dissociative disorders. Methods: we searched the PubMed database to
identify functional neuroimaging studies conducted on subjects with a diagnosis of a dissociative
disorder, following the PRISMA guidelines. In the end, we included 13 studies in this systematic
review, conducted on 51 patients with dissociative identity disorder (DID), 28 subjects affected by
depersonalization disorder, 24 with dissociative amnesia, and 6 with other or not speciﬁed dissociative
disorders. Results: Prefrontal cortex dysfunction seems prominent. In addition, changes in the
functional neural network of the caudate are related to alterations of identity state and maintenance
of an altered mental status in DID. Another role in DID seems to be played by a dysfunction of
the anterior cingulate gyrus. Other regions, including parietal, temporal, and insular cortices, and
subcortical areas were reported to be dysfunctional in dissociative disorders. Conclusions: Prefrontal
dysfunction is frequently reported in dissociative disorders. Functional changes in other cortical and
subcortical areas can be correlated with these diagnoses. Further studies are needed to clarify the
neurofunctional correlations of each dissociative disorder in affected patients, in order to identify
better tailored treatments.

Dissociation encompasses loss of integration in essential functions such as memory,
consciousness, perception, motor control, and identity [1]. Although these are estab-
lished conclusions, the classiﬁcation of dissociative disorders has undergone many changes
through the decades, being initially assimilated to what are nowadays called somatoform
disorders, and that were once deﬁned as neuroses. The DSM-II [2] included two categories
of hysterical neurosis (conversion type and dissociative type) and a hysterical (histrionic)
personality disorder, but the atheoretically-oriented DSM-III [3] omitted the term “neurosis”
and initially conserved the term “hysterical” only in brackets, splitting hysterical neurosis
conversion type into conversion disorder and psychogenic pain disorder in the context of
somatoform disorders, and hysterical neurosis dissociative type into psychogenic amne-
sia, psychogenic fugue, and multiple personality disorder in the context of dissociative
disorders (sleepwalking disorder was placed among childhood disorders). This trend was
conﬁrmed in the subsequent revisions up to DSM-IV-TR [4]. DSM-5 has maintained the

Dissociative Disorders, somehow renaming the disorders included and adding new ones
(Dissociative Identity Disorder, Dissociative Amnesia, Depersonalization/Derealization
Disorder, Other Speciﬁed Dissociative Disorder, and Unspeciﬁed Dissociative Disorder).
Dissociative identity disorder in DSM-5 now refers to possession and/or identity fragmen-
tation, in order to be more aligned with possible cultural differences. Dissociative amnesia
includes dissociative fugue as a subtype, since fugue is a rare disorder that always involves
amnesia but does not always include confused wandering or loss of personality identity [5].
Depersonalization disorder also includes derealization, since the two often co-occur. As far
as single symptoms are concerned, severe dissociation has been associated with childhood
trauma exposure [6,7] and meta-analyses have proved that all forms of childhood traumas
are directly associated with dissociation in patients with mental disorders [6]. In fact, pa-
tients affected by dissociative identity disorder (DID) report severe childhood traumas [8,9],
while patients suffering from depersonalization disorder (DPD) report lower childhood
trauma exposure, also compared to patients with depressive disorders [10,11]. It is unclear
whether similar disorders with different severity may share neural correlates and etiology,
but ﬁndings on neural alterations may help solve this puzzle.

In the last four decades, neuroimaging studies have focused on dissociative disorders,
suggesting the existence of particular brain activation patterns in patients belonging to
this diagnostic category. These studies have shown regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) or
glucose metabolism (CMRglu) changes in the temporal, parietal (implicated in dissociative
and conversion phenomena), and orbitofrontal (likely involved in the integration of the
self) cortices, in the hippocampus (involved in memory and in the removal of traumatic
events), in the basal ganglia, and in other areas. However, they have reached different,
and at times conﬂicting, conclusions, ﬁnding out hyperactivation of brain areas in some
cases [12–14], and hypoactivation in others [15]. It is also unclear whether these changes
involve more often the left or right hemisphere, albeit recent evidence suggests greater
damage of the former. Furthermore, most of these studies are limited by low sample size,
heterogeneity of diagnosis and comorbidity, and stage of disease (onset, acute, or chronic).
Established models have linked dissociation with increased recruitment in regions
involved in executive control [16,17], such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior
cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal gyri, resulting in dampened activation of the amygdala.
Attention has also been focused on the connectivity of temporal cortices, speciﬁcally the
temporoparietal junctions, because of its involvement in the neurophysiology of multisen-
sory integration [18], whose processing can be altered in case of out of body experiences
during brain stimulation and lesion studies [19,20].

We hypothesized that there could be common functional changes in patients with a
DSM diagnosis of dissociative disorders across different brain regions during task execution
and/or during resting state, and that these alterations would match impaired performance
of neurocognitive tasks. Considering the low prevalence of dissociative disorders, the
low number of functional neuroimaging studies and their mostly inconsistent results, we
aimed to clarify the main neural functional pattern associated with these diagnoses. This
review aimed to identify alterations in functional neuroimaging techniques reports, and to
correlate them with impaired neurocognitive performance and psychopathology of patients
with DDs.

2. Materials and Methods

A search was conducted using the international scientiﬁc database PubMed (http://
www.pubmed.gov; accessed on 2 August 2022) to identify functional neuroimaging studies
conducted on subjects with a diagnosis of dissociative disorder (i.e., dissociative identity
disorder, depersonalization disorder, dissociative amnesia, and other or not speciﬁed
dissociative disorders). We followed the methods of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA Statement) [21]. First, we searched the
database PubMed with the title/abstract ﬁlter, using the keywords “dissociative disord*”,
“dissociative amnesia”, “identity disorder”, “PET”, “MRI”, “positron emission”, “functional

J. Pers. Med. 2022, 12, 1405

magnetic”, and “spectroscopy.” Second, we collected further studies by examining the
bibliographies of relevant articles in the ﬁrst step or through the “related article” function
of the PubMed database, and bibliographies of reviews on the topic.

We included articles on functional neuroimaging studies in samples of patients diag-
nosed with dissociative disorders (Dissociative Identity Disorder, Dissociative Amnesia,
Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder, Other Speciﬁed Dissociative Disorder, and Un-
speciﬁed Dissociative Disorder) according to the DSM criteria, regardless of the presence
of healthy controls in the study. We excluded case reports, case studies, pharmacological
trials, reviews, studies on children, studies employing techniques other than functional
neuroimaging, and studies involving patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. Three
reviewers screened each record and each report reviewed, and collected reported data,
working independently from each other, and subsequently verifying together the appropri-
ateness of the procedure, and proofreading the included data and results. Two reviewers
independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study, considering the sample
number, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of participants, the consistency of the sample, and
the methods employed, and used the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
quality assessment tool [22]. We did not register and prepare this study on the basis of a
pre-established protocol. We did not use automation tools in our methodological processes.
Based on these criteria, we analyzed 61 studies, from which we excluded 48 studies, of
which 26 were unrelated to the subject, 6 were case reports/case studies [15,23–27], 1 was
focused on schizophrenia [28], 1 was conducted on adolescents with post-traumatic stress
disorder [29], 1 was conducted on healthy subjects [30], 7 used structural neuroimaging
techniques [31–37], and 3 were not focused on dissociative disorders [38–40]. We ﬁnally
included 13 studies published between 2006 and 2022 [14,33,34,41–50]. We grouped the
studies in our discussion on the basis of the most consistently reported dysfunctional brain
areas in affected patients.

The main study outcomes for which data were sought were changes in neural cortical
and subcortical activation patterns and changes in neural metabolism correlated with the
diagnosis of a dissociative disorder and/or with symptom severity in patients with a
dissociative disorder.

Quality Assessment Tool and Risk of Bias

The potential methodological quality of the study and risk of bias were examined
through the SIGN quality assessment tool [22]. All studies addressed an appropriate and
clearly focused question. Two studies had a high risk of bias in terms of study subjects,
because they included two different diagnoses in the sample (view Table 1). In all 13 studies,
nevertheless, the two groups being analyzed are selected from source populations that
are comparable in all respects other than the factor under investigation. Even when rare
differences were present (i.e., age), they were not statistically signiﬁcant. There were
no dropouts in the studies assessed, but no study speciﬁed how many of the people
asked to take part did so, in each of the groups being studied. The outcomes are clearly
deﬁned in every study, the method of assessment of diagnosis is very reliable in each case
(DSM), and all psychiatric diagnoses are established through these criteria worldwide.
Conﬁdence intervals have always been provided when analyzing brain functional changes
in subjects.
In conclusion, the biggest risk of bias lies only in the low sample of the
studies, which could exaggerate the signiﬁcance of the results [51]; nevertheless, given
the low incidence of dissociative disorders in the general population, the results can be
considered reliable. Taking into account clinical considerations, the evaluation of the
methodology used, and the statistical power of the study, there is evidence of association
between the disease and certain brain functional changes. In addition, according to the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system
of rating the quality of evidence and grading strength of recommendations in systematic
reviews [52], also taking into considerations the two aforementioned studies (view Table 1)
which included two different diagnoses in the subject group, and therefore have a higher

J. Pers. Med. 2022, 12, 1405

risk of selection bias, all included studies show consistent ﬁndings with no publication
bias, no imprecisions, no serious limitations, and no serious indirectness. Ultimately,
considering all the studies, their appropriateness of diagnosis as well as appropriate control
of confounding, other aspects of design, conduct, and analysis that inﬂuence the risk of
bias, we can conclude that the quality of evidence is high. Ideally, future systematic reviews
on this topic will comprehensively summarize evidence on all important functional brain
changes in dissociative disorders.

4. Discussion
4.1. Functional Changes in the Limbic/Paralimbic System

The most prominent functional changes have been found across the limbic system of
subjects, mostly when they performed particular tasks whose execution may be affected by
the disease.

Different functional neuroimaging studies were based on the Theory of Structural
Dissociation of the Personality in DID, according to which patients retain traumatic memo-
ries ﬁxed in the emotional part (EP), while some personality parts are apparently normal
(ANP), in order to mentally avoid traumatic memories [41]. The EP parts of DID patients,
when showed human faces expressing certain emotions (neutrality and anger), had a hy-
peractivation of the right parahippocampal gyrus, in comparison with the ANP part and
with the EP part of controls (female actresses). This result can be associated with the clinical
characteristics of EP (ﬁxation on traumatic memories and tendency to reactivate traumatic
memories with speciﬁc triggers). Thus, it can correlate to the fact that the parahippocampal
gyrus are physiologically involved in the retaining of autobiographic memory, speciﬁcally
the right one [53,54]. The ANP part of DID patients had a whole-brain decreased activity
when showed both neutral and angry faces. The insula showed metabolic changes in a
PET study during traumatic re-evocation in a traumatic state of identity (TIS) in patients

Figure 1. PRISMA search strategy on functional neuroimaging studies in dissociative disorders. 4. Discussion 4.1. Functional Changes in the Limbic/Paralimbic System The most prominent functional changes have been found across the limbic system of subjects, mostly when they performed particular tasks whose execution may be affected by the disease. Different functional neuroimaging studies were based on the Theory of Structural Dissociation of the Personality in DID, according to which patients retain traumatic mem-ories fixed in the emotional part (EP), while some personality parts are apparently normal (ANP), in order to mentally avoid traumatic memories [41]. The EP parts of DID patients, when showed human faces expressing certain emotions (neutrality and anger), had a hy-peractivation of the right parahippocampal gyrus, in comparison with the ANP part and with the EP part of controls (female actresses). This result can be associated with the clin-ical characteristics of EP (fixation on traumatic memories and tendency to reactivate trau-matic memories with specific triggers). Thus, it can correlate to the fact that the parahip-pocampal gyrus are physiologically involved in the retaining of autobiographic memory, J. Pers. Med. 2022, 12, 1405

physiological response to alarm [55]. Indeed, the insula seems to hyperactivate during
egocentric learning in these patients [46]. Nevertheless, some peculiar tasks seem to be re-
tained, if not improved, in dissociative disorders. Women with dissociative amnesia or DID
during an egocentric virtual maze learning task showed preserved attentional visuospatial
mnemonic functioning compared with controls [46]. Notwithstanding, higher severity
of the clinical picture directly correlated with better performance, and was accompanied
with the hyperactivation of the cingulate gyrus and the precuneus [47] This is consistent
with the ﬁndings of another study in which DPD patients exhibited greater activation of
the anterior cingulate during self-related processing [45], leading to the hypothesis that
egocentric learning and egocentric tasks may be better in dissociative disorders than in
healthy controls, due to the fact that dissociative defenses have improved and worked
in avoiding the development of PTSD [46], or more severe psychiatric disorders. In fact,
the cingulate gyrus, right anterior, and middle cingulate cortex seem to hypoactivate in
traumatic vs. neutral identity states, as well as during within-identity state assessments [34]
in patients with DID.

DPD patients have also shown anomalies in the neural function of some parts of
the paralimbic system. The right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hyperactivates during
face processing (self vs. stranger), which has been interpreted as a correlate of conﬂict
between the conscious and unconscious aspects of self-processing in DPD [48]. It has been
hypothesized that DPD patients’ problem lies not in consciously recognizing their own face,
but in doing it unconsciously [45,56], associating this phenomenon with the hyperactivation
of the ACC for conﬂict detection and resolution, thus explaining the presence of anguish
In addition, DPD patients also showed

reduced activation of the amygdala in response to faces expressing emotions [48], a ﬁnding
that could be associated with a response to traumatic events, as had previously been
hypothesized in other studies on the matter, particularly on PTSD [57–59]. Different
activation patterns in the right hippocampus and left amygdala have been associated with
DID [50] due to the role of the former in the Papez memory circuit and its involvement in
autobiographical memory. A neurobiological model of DID speculates that acute stress
can be associated with a shift from hippocampal involvement to caudate involvement [50],
which will be explained later to hyperactivate during traumatic identity state condition
(see section below on subcortical areas)

4.2. Functional Changes in Frontal and Prefrontal Cortices

Changes in frontal and prefrontal cortices are an important ﬁnding of the review, and

they particularly correlate with speciﬁc tasks or states of identity explained below.

DID patients showed hyperactivation of the prefrontal cortex during resting state,
particularly in the dorsomedial area, and other areas of the default mode network (DMN),
in comparison with healthy controls (actors) [33]. This suggests that DID patients are
more involved when they need to concentrate on self. The same happened during the
neutral personality state in response to trauma-related vs. neutral words [50], such as if
their hyperarousal state triggered by trauma re-evocation could be lowered by prefrontal
activation. On the contrary, healthy controls showed hypoactivation of the middle frontal
gyrus during resting state [33].

A PET study has shown reduced resting state metabolism of the right inferolateral
prefrontal cortex in patients with autobiographical memory loss due to dissociative amnesia,
compared with healthy controls [42]. This region plays many roles, being speciﬁcally
involved in self-awareness [60], self-regulatory processes [61], emotion regulation [62], and
higher order control mechanisms [63], including active memory retrieval.

During an identity traumatic state in patients affected by DID, a reduced activation of
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and left frontal pole has been observed at fMRI during
an n-back working memory task [43]. In addition, reduced memory performance has
been found in correlation with this reduced activation, together with a higher number of
mistakes during the task. These results can be related with symptoms such as ﬂashback,

J. Pers. Med. 2022, 12, 1405

re-experiencing traumatic events, anxiety, and other symptoms of DID. In fact, another
study has demonstrated that patients with DID in an identity traumatic state, as well
as during within-identity state assessment, compared to a neutral identity state, show
a hypoactivation of the frontal cortex [34]. On the other hand, instead, since trauma
revival is mostly sensorimotor- and anxiety-associated, it could also be related to reduced
mentalization capacity (prefrontal deactivation), considering the essential role of this area
in related functions [64]. These dysfunctions in the frontal cortex in traumatic states of
identity can also relate with the presence of a retracted ﬁeld of consciousness in patients
with DID [43].

Other prefrontal areas (left anterior and dorsolateral cortices) have been found to
hyperactivate during verbal working memory tasks in patients with DID or not speciﬁed
dissociative disorder, when compared to healthy controls, and the same seems to happen in
the left parietal lobe [14]. The same conclusions also apply to DPD patients [47,49]. These
functional changes at fMRI are consistent with a working memory performance improve-
ment in the same group of patients, when exposed to neutral memories. This ﬁnding can
correlate with a different style of cognitive processing that these patients develop along
the way. It is important to underline that hyperactivation in these areas occurs in response
to neutral memories, because, as we have already seen, in traumatic states of identity, the
frontoparietal activation is reduced [43]. The opposite, i.e., hypoactivation in the inferior
parietal lobe, happens when these patients are instead employed in egocentric tasks [46].
This ﬁnding needs further clariﬁcation regarding whether it depends on the task or is a
diagnostic correlate.

Various studies have also conﬁrmed the presence of neurofunctional changes in the
prefrontal cortex of DPD patients. In fact, during face processing (self vs. stranger faces),
these patients had hyperactivation of the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices (PFCs) and left
middle frontal gyrus (MFG), as well as the right anterior cingulate cortex [45,49]. Severity
of depersonalization directly correlated with the increased activation of medial PFCs. This
is consistent with a deﬁcit in implicit self-processing [45].

4.3. Functional Changes in Other Cortical Areas

In addition to what has already been underlined above, other scattered cortical areas

seem to undergo changes in dissociative disorders.

The left occipito-temporal junction was hyperactivated in the EP parts of DID patients,
compared to the EP of controls, correlating with the role of this part of the cortex in face-
sensitivity [41]. In addition, the primary somatosensory cortex was hyperactivated in the
EP of DID patients during resting state, together with motor related areas [33]. This ﬁnding
may be due to the fact that the EP of DID patients is more resting-state concentrated on the
self and somatosensory feelings, and therefore self-awareness, together with an increased
tendency to engage in motor reactions, such as if they are in an alert state due to previous
traumas. Functional changes in numerous other cortical areas have been demonstrated in
the studies we included, indicating that dissociative phenomena are complex and require
further clariﬁcation in their neurophysiopathological correlates.

4.4. Subcortical Functional Changes

Changes in subcortical activation patterns have been found in dissociative disorder

cases, mostly in the thalamic regions.

Compared to the EP part of controls (female actresses), those of DID patients, when
showed neutral human faces, had a hyperactivation in the brainstem area, in correlation
with clinical aspects of DID, for example hyperarousal [41].

The ANP of DID patients, compared to the EP, showed bilateral thalamus hyperactiva-
tion during resting state, and the same happens in healthy controls simulating ANP com-
pared to when they simulate EP [33]. This ﬁnding is also conﬁrmed by Weniger et al. [46],
who found that the thalamus hyperactivates in healthy controls with respect to females with
dissociative disorders and childhood abuse history. Thalamic hyperactivation correlates

J. Pers. Med. 2022, 12, 1405

11 of 14

with the ﬁrst biological models of dissociation in trauma survivors, in which the thalamus
plays a fundamental role. [65] Another explanation for this thalamic hyperactivation lies in
dysfunctional fear extinction processes in response to traumas [66]. Another PET study has
shown that during a trauma re-evocation in a TIS in patients affected by DID, metabolic
changes of the bilateral caudate nucleus were found, thus probably correlating with the role
of the latter in the neurophysiology of anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders
(OCD), and generally in fear processing dysfunction [67–70]. The hypoactivation of the
caudate in dissociative disorders during egocentric tasks has been conﬁrmed by fMRI ﬁnd-
ings [46], whilst DID patients’ caudate nucleus hyperactivates during traumatic identity
state condition, in response to personal trauma scripts [34]. The latter can be explained by
the fact that the dorsal striatum i.e., caudate nucleus is involved both in the switch between
identity states and in the maintenance of the altered identity state [15,41,50,71].

4.5. Limitations

The main limitation of this systematic review are related to the small number of
functional neuroimaging studies in dissociative disorders. Because of this we have focused
on the entire spectrum of dissociative disorders, and for this reason the eligibility criteria
were heterogeneous. Another limitation is the use of only one database (PubMed), although
we performed a further search by examining the bibliographies of relevant articles. The
results of our systematic review should be taken with caution, since most of the included
studies had samples with less than 45 patients, which may involve a signiﬁcant risk of
bias [51]; furthermore, two studies had mixed diagnoses in their samples that may have
led to a high risk of bias.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, few functional neuroimaging studies currently concentrate on disso-
ciative disorders. Nevertheless, it is possible to underline some consistent evidence on
the cerebral functioning correlates of these diseases. Prefrontal cortex dysfunction seems
prominent and can correlate with both traumatic identity states and neutral identity states
in DID, and with the phenomena of depersonalization in DPD. In addition, changes in the
functional neural network of the caudate were related to alterations of identity state and
maintenance of an altered mental status in DID patients. Another role in DID seems to be
played by a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate gyrus. Other areas involved in proprio-
ception, interoception, self-awareness, and theory of mind, including parietal, temporal,
and insular cortices, were reported to be dysfunctional in dissociative disorders. Further
studies are needed to clarify the neurofunctional correlates of single dissociative disorders
in affected patients, in order to identify better tailored treatments.
