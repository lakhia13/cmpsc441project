Abstract: Background: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people in Kenya face pervasive socio-cultural
and structural discrimination. Persistent stress stemming from anti-SGM stigma and prejudice may place
SGM individuals at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes. This study explored experiences
with violence (intimate partner violence and SGM-based violence), mental health outcomes (psychological
distress, PTSD symptoms, and depressive symptoms), alcohol and other substance use, and prioritization
of community needs among SGM adults in Western Kenya. Methods: This study was conducted by
members of a collaborative research partnership between a U.S. academic institution and a Kenyan LGBTQ
civil society organization (CSO). A convenience sample of 527 SGM adults (92.7% ages 18–34) was recruited
from community venues to complete a cross-sectional survey either on paper or through an online secure
platform. Results: For comparative analytic purposes, three sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)
groups were created: (1) cisgender sexual minority women (SMW; 24.9%), (2) cisgender sexual minority
men (SMM; 63.8%), and (3) gender minority individuals (GMI; 11.4%). Overall, 11.7% of participants
reported clinically significant levels of psychological distress, 53.2% reported clinically significant levels
of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and 26.1% reported clinically significant levels of
depressive symptoms. No statistically significant differences in clinical levels of these mental health
concerns were detected across SOGI groups. Overall, 76.2% of participants reported ever using alcohol,
45.6% home brew, 43.5% tobacco, 39.1% marijuana, and 27.7% miraa or khat. Statistically significant SOGI
group differences on potentially problematic substance use revealed that GMI participants were less likely
to use alcohol and tobacco daily; and SMM participants were more likely to use marijuana daily. Lifetime
intimate partner violence (IPV) was reported by 42.5% of participants, and lifetime SGM-based violence
(SGMV) was reported by 43.4%. GMI participants were more likely than other SOGI groups to have
experienced both IPV and SGMV. Participants who experienced SGMV had significantly higher rates of
clinically significant depressive and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Despite current resilience demonstrated
by SGM adults in Kenya, there is an urgent need to develop and deliver culturally appropriate mental
health services for this population. Given the pervasiveness of anti-SGM violence, services should be
provided using trauma-informed principles, and be sensitive to the lived experiences of SGM adults
in Kenya. Community and policy levels interventions are needed to decrease SGM-based stigma and
violence, increase SGM visibility and acceptance, and create safe and affirming venues for mental health
care. Political prioritization of SGM mental health is needed for sustainable change.

1. Background

Kenya is home to an increasingly more visible sexual and gender minority (SGM)
community, as can be seen by the growing number of civil society organizations (CSOs)
and national advocacy efforts focused on improving the health and human rights of lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people [1]. This activism and advocacy is
especially important considering the non-afﬁrming, and in many ways hostile, social and
public policy environment for LGBTQ people in Kenya [2]. This hostility is exempliﬁed by
the Kenya High Court’s decision on 24 May 2019 to reject a petition ﬁled in 2016 by three
LGBTQ-focused CSOs in Kenya that would have declared Sections 162 and 165 of the Kenya
Penal Code unconstitutional, thus decriminalizing same-sex behavior among consenting
adults. Currently in Kenya, consensual same-sex behavior is punishable by up to 14 years
in jail [3]. Within this relatively anti-LGBTQ social and legal context, many SGM people in
Kenya experience regularly documented human rights violations such as physical assault
from mobs and vigilantes, rape and sexual assault by police, and institutional barriers
to housing, education, and employment [2,4–8]. Further, research has shown that SGM
people report experiencing harassment and denial of care from health care workers, and
therefore also report frequently avoiding seeking physical and mental health services for
fear of discrimination and even violence [9,10].

Much of the current stigma and discrimination experienced by SGM people through-
out Sub-Saharan Africa stems from colonial laws that criminalize same-sex behaviors and
diverse gender identities, often supported by Western religions that were also an import
from European colonizers [1,11,12]. There is substantial historical evidence that prior to
colonization by Western countries; there were multiple forms of same-sex behaviors, identi-
ties and relationships, as well as various expressions of gender identities across the African
continent [13–15]. It is important to note that these practices and identities were not neces-
sarily labelled as LGBTQ, as this nomenclature is often considered to have its origins in
Eurocentrism [16,17]. Speciﬁcally in Kenya, multiple scholars and activists have challenged
the notion that same-sex behaviors and identities are in opposition to traditional Kenyan
culture and norms, citing historical examples of culturally sanctioned same-sex relation-
ships in some Kenyan tribes, and calling for the rejection of anti-SGM laws which were
created by oppressive colonizers, but have been maintained post-colonization [1,7,18–20].
Despite these challenges, many SGM people in Kenya experience pervasive violations of
their human rights [2,4–8].

In addition to the direct material and physical impacts of stigma-related violence,
many scholars have identiﬁed the mental health effects of prejudice and stigma related
to sexual and gender minority status. The most empirically validated conceptual model
making this connection is the Minority Stress Model, which posits that exposure to per-
sistent stress stemming from anti-SGM prejudice, stigma, and discrimination places SGM
individuals at increased risk for negative mental health outcomes, including higher rates
of mental disorders and psychological distress, and lowered psychological and social well-
being [21,22]. This model extends extensive transcontinental theory and empirical research
with an array of populations and ages demonstrating that environmental adversity and
stress are critical factors in the development of psychopathology and focuses on the unique
experiences of sexual and gender minority people [23–27].

The forms of stress emphasized by the Minority Stress Model include major life events,
such as assault because of their sexual and gender minority status, as well as everyday
forms of discrimination, such as receiving poor services. Although the initial develop-
ment and empirical research supporting the Minority Stress Model was conducted in
the United States, the utility of this model has been demonstrated globally with popula-
tions of SGM individuals across six continents (c.f. [28–35]); including quantitative and
qualitative studies with sexual minority men in Nigeria [35,36], South Africa [37,38], and
Zambia [39]. For SGM people in Kenya and other resource-poor settings, the Minority
Stress Model is particularly helpful in understanding mental health outcomes since it also
recognizes that SGM minority status is situated within general environmental circum-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

stances (e.g., poverty); resulting in the experience of general stressors (e.g., unemployment)
as well as embedded sexual and gender minority stress processes at both the societal and
individual levels [22,40]. In order to develop public policy efforts aimed at improving
the mental health and wellbeing of SGM people in Kenya, research is needed regarding
experiences of discrimination and trauma, and subsequent mental health concerns within
this population.

Limited national data exist on the mental health of LGBTQ people in Kenya, and
the scant existing research has primarily been conducted with gay and bisexual men and
other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and is typically conducted within HIV
research projects [41]. In addition to not being representative of non-GBMSM members
of the Kenyan SGM community such as lesbian women and transgender individuals, this
research often includes samples that consist predominately of GBMSM who engage in sex
work or transactional sex (due to greater ease of recruitment); thus these limited data are
likely not representative of the broader Kenyan SGM community, or even to the general
GBMSM population in Kenya.

The extant data on GBMSM mental health in Kenya has documented relatively high
rates of violence and traumatic incidents as well as mental health concerns and substance
use. Kunzweiler et al. found that among 711 GBMSM in Western Kenya, 11.4% reported
moderately severe or severe depressive symptoms, 50.1% reported harmful alcohol abuse,
and 23.8% reported moderate substance abuse. In addition, this study found high rates of
childhood physical or sexual abuse (80.9%) and recent physical or psychological trauma
linked to anti-LGBTQ stigma (39.1%) [6]. These results are in line with ﬁndings from
coastal Kenya, where one third of 112 GBMSM met criteria for major depressive disorder,
45% reported alcohol abuse, and 59.8% reported other substance abuse [4]. Additionally,
67% of participants reported some form of abuse within the past year and 77% reported
some form of abuse in childhood [4]. A secondary analysis of data by Korhonen et al.
from 1476 GBMSM abstracted from three HIV-focused studies conducted in the capital city
of Nairobi, coastal Kenya, and Western Kenya (three regions containing the majority of
Kenya’s population) found that 31% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms,
44% reported hazardous alcohol use, and 51% reported problematic substance use—all
higher than Kenyan national rates [5].

High rates of childhood abuse and recent experiences of anti-LGBTQ physical and
psychological violence among GBMSM in Kenya have been repeatedly reported in the
existing literature and provide additional support for examining the health of the Kenyan
LGBTQ community through a Minority Stress lens [4–6]. All three of the studies on Kenyan
GBMSM discussed above found signiﬁcant associations between abuse or trauma and
depressive symptoms, alcohol abuse, and other substance abuse. Such associations between
trauma and symptoms of depression and anxiety have also been found in samples of young
Kenyan GBMSM (ages 18–29) [42,43].

Limited data are available on the health-related experiences of lesbian, bisexual and
queer women in Kenya [44]. Wilson et al. conducted an exploratory study that included
an analysis of comments made during a facilitated community forum and an examination
of the sociopolitical and legal environment relevant to sexual minority women’s health in
Kenya. Participants identiﬁed multiple health-related issues, including concerns related
to healthcare access, healthy sexual relationships, economic instability, and freedom from
violence. The legal and policy analysis indicated that policy is complicated by the presence
of hostile laws regarding same-sex sexuality, an absence of economic policies to protect
women, and health policies that render sexual minority women invisible [2]. Another
quantitative study of 273 sexual and gender minorities assigned female at birth in Western
Kenya found that overall 27.7% of the participants experienced violence due to their sexual
orientation, gender identity or gender expression, with those whose gender expression
was masculine, androgynous/all-gender or who did not use a gender expression or role
term were more than two times more likely to report such violence [45]. Of those who
experienced SGM-related violence, 44% experienced verbal violence, 38.7% experienced

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

emotional violence, 21.3% experienced physical violence, and 14.7% experienced sexual
violence. The majority (55.8%) reported two or more forms of violence [2,45].

The burden of mental health and substance use disorders in Sub-Saharan Africa
is projected to increase by 130% between 2010 and 2050 [46]. Given their status as a
highly stigmatized minority group, this projected increase places Kenyan SGM people
in a uniquely dangerous position. Interventions at multiple socio-ecological levels will
be needed to dismantle the persistent interpersonal and institutionalized violence and
discrimination that the community faces, and data are critically needed to more fully
understand the situation and needs of this diverse population. In order to expand on
the limited existing literature and to provide data on the broader SGM community in
Kenya, this paper presents data from a sample of 527 SGM adults in Western Kenya. In
line with the principles of the Minority Stress Model, which connects experiences of stigma
and discrimination to mental and physical health outcomes, we examine factors such as
experiences with violence (intimate partner violence and SGM-based violence), mental
health outcomes (psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, and depressive symptoms), and
alcohol and other substance use. We also examine the prioritization of needs, as described
by the community members who participated in the study.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Sampling

This study was designed and conducted by members of a collaborative partnership
between a U.S. academic institution and a Kenyan CSO focused on SGM human rights.
Members of the Kenyan CSO, all of whom identiﬁed as LGBTQ, conducted study recruit-
ment, enrollment and data collection activities. The CSO is a network that, at the time
of data collection, included 17 member organizations located throughout nine counties
in Western Kenya. These organizations were divided into seven geographically close
clusters to facilitate regional meetings and activities. Recruitment occurred through a
two-stage process. In the ﬁrst stage, information regarding the upcoming survey was
shared with members of the broader SGM community in Western Kenya through social
media announcements on the CSO’s Facebook page and in WhatsApp groups focused on
LGBTQ people in Western Kenya. This initial sensitization also occurred through verbal
discussions and announcements at member organizations’ group activities and events, and
at social gathering spots such as bars and discos.

In the second stage, the same communication channels used during the study sen-
sitization stage were used to recruit and enroll participants. Individuals were eligible to
participate in this cross-sectional study if they were 18 years or older, lived in Western
Kenya, were able to read English, and identiﬁed as a member of the LGBTQ community.
During this second stage, outreach workers also conducted workshops on sexual and
reproductive health rights in all of the cluster regions, and following those meetings any
interested individuals were able to talk with one of the outreach workers in order to be
screened and enrolled.

Participants had the option of responding to the survey on a paper questionnaire
or online through a virtual and secure Qualtrics platform. All surveys were presented
and completed in English. The measures in the survey were selected by members of the
collaborative research team based on four focus groups that were conducted with members
of SGM CSOs in Western Kenya to understand participants’ mental health conceptualiza-
tions, concerns, and challenges. The ﬁnal survey included items to assess demographics
(e.g., gender identity, sexual orientation, age, county of residence, religion, employment,
educational level), violence (intimate partner and SGM), and the mental health areas of
psychological distress, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and alcohol
and substance use. All items on the survey were reviewed for comprehension and cultural
appropriateness by the Kenyan CSO, and then pilot-tested with a sample of ten SGM
participants from Kisumu. Based on pilot testing, the Kenyan CSO altered the wording on

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

six of eighteen symptom description items in the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 to enhance
local understanding and clarity.

2.1.1. Sample General Demographics

A total of 570 participants completed the survey. Forty-three surveys were excluded
from this analysis due to incomplete data and/or identiﬁcation as cisgender and hetero-
sexual, resulting in a ﬁnal sample of 527 SGM adults. More than 90% of the participants
were between the ages of 18–34 (Table 1). All of the participants resided in the western-
most counties in Kenya, with the vast majority residing in Kisumu (58.1%), Siaya (13%),
Bungoma (9%), or Kakamega (6.5%). Participants reported their religion as predominately
Catholic (37.8%), Anglican (21.5%), Seventh Day Adventist (14.8%), or Muslim (12%). Of
the individuals who indicated their current employment status, almost half were employed
either full time or part time (44.8%) while others were working as a laborer (9.4%), sex
worker (10.6%), or were not working but in school (15.4%). The vast majority of the sample
(82.5%) had either completed primary school, secondary school, or received their diploma.
Very few had received their bachelor’s (5.5%) or master’s degree (0.6%). See Table 1 for
more detailed descriptive demographics.

2.1.2. Sample Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI)

Participants reported a range of sexual orientation identities, with the vast majority
identifying as bisexual (47.4%), gay (23.9%), or lesbian (13.3%). The remaining identiﬁed
their sexual orientation as men who have sex with men/MSM (10.1%), women who have
sex with women/WSW (2.1%), other (1.7%) or queer (1.3%). Among gender minority
individuals, the ﬁfty-seven people who indicated they were transgender reported their
sexual orientation as bisexual (19.3%), gay (36.8%), MSM (21.1%), lesbian (14%), other
(5.3%), or queer (1.8%). Only one participant who identiﬁed as a transgender man indicated
they were heterosexual. Genderqueer or gender non-conforming people speciﬁed their
sexual orientation as either bisexual (60%) or queer (40%).

Participants were asked to identify their sex assigned at birth and their current gender
identity. Seventy-two percent were assigned male sex at birth and 28% were assigned
female sex. Based on participants’ responses to the sex assigned at birth and current gender
identity questions, we created three unique gender identity groups: (1) cisgender men and
women (individuals whose current gender identity is the same as their sex assigned at
birth (88.2%), (2) transgender men and women (individuals whose current gender identity
is different than their sex assigned at birth (10.8%), and (3) gender non-binary (individuals
whose current gender identity is genderqueer or gender non-conforming regardless of their
sex assigned at birth (1.0%). See Table 2 for more detailed sample sexual orientation and
gender identity data.

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Demographic Information

Demographic information was assessed using questions developed by the collab-
orative partnership. Demographic information regarding county of residence, religion,
employment, and educational level were assessed using multiple-choice questions that
included response options previously developed by the Kenyan CSO for prior surveys.
Age was asked as an open-ended question. Gender identity was assessed using a two-
step method (Step 1: current gender identity, Step 2: assigned birth sex) that has been
used globally to assess transgender identity [47]. Sexual orientation was assessed using a
multiple-choice question with the following potential response options, which were used
by the Kenyan CSO for prior surveys: bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, straight/heterosexual,
MSM (man who has sex with men), WSW (woman who has sex with women), and other.

2.2.2. Psychological Distress

Psychological distress was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-
18) [48], an 18-item measure that has been successfully used to assess psychological distress
symptoms among adults in Western Kenya, and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa [49–51].
Based on pilot testing with SGM adults in Western Kenya, wording on six of the eighteen
symptom items was altered to be in alignment with local understanding of these symptoms
(e.g., “feeling blue” was changed to “feeling low” and “spells of terror or panic” was
changed to “moments of fear or panic”). Psychological distress items were categorized
into three areas, somatization, depression, and anxiety based on a scale of 0 = “not at all
likely” to 4 = “extremely likely.” Here, we report speciﬁcally on the global score index
(GSI) of all BSI scores by computing the z-score and then translating it to a t-score where
two groups were created based on a score greater or less than 62, with a t-score greater
than 62 indicating clinical signiﬁcance. If item values were missing for more than three

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

items, the score was considered invalid. The 18-item scale was found to be highly reliable
(α = 0.94).

2.2.3. Depressive Symptoms

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9),
a 9-item measure that has been successfully used to assess depressive symptoms among
GBMSM adults in Western Kenya, and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa [5,52–54]. A total
continuous score was calculated by adding together responses from all nine items, which
required frequency responses ranging from 0 = “not at all” to 3 = “nearly every day.”
Means were imputed for 1–2 missing items and those missing >2 items did not receive
a score. Scores were then categorized as follows: 0–4 (no to minimal depression), 5 to 9
(mild depression), 10 to 14 (moderate depression), 15 to 19 (moderately severe depression),
and 20–27 (severe depression). Categories were dichotomized by not clinically signiﬁcant
levels of depressive symptoms (no to mild depression; ≤9) and clinically signiﬁcant levels
of depressive symptom warranting clinical attention (moderate to severe depression; ≥10).
The 9-item scale was found to be highly reliable (α = 0.88).

2.2.4. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms

Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were assessed using the Primary Care Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PC-PTSD) Assessment, a 4-item measure that has been success-
fully used to assess PTSD symptoms among adults in Kenya, and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan
Africa [55–57]. Items were summed and categorized on a scale of 0–4, with 3–4 indicating
the need for a clinical evaluation for PTSD, and 0–2 indicating that clinical evaluation was
not needed. The 4-item scale was found to be highly reliable (α = 0.88).

2.2.5. Alcohol and Substance Use

The use of alcohol and other substances was assessed using items from the Kenya
National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) Rapid
Situation Assessment [58]. We focused on the use of alcohol, home brew (local home-
brewed spirits), tobacco, marijuana, and miraa or khat (local stimulants). These ﬁve
different types of alcohol and substance use were dichotomized as (1) ever used the speciﬁc
type of alcohol/substance, and (2) never used the speciﬁc type of alcohol/substance. In
addition to the ﬁrst type of dichotomous variable, we also created another dichotomous
variable to determine the potential presence of problematic alcohol/substance use, which
we deﬁned as daily use.

2.2.6. Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual/Gender Minority-Based Violence

Lifetime experiences of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Sexual/Gender Minority-
Based Violence (SGMV) were assessed with questions developed by the Kenyan CSO based
on a prior community needs assessment. For IPV, participants were asked “Have you ever
been the victim of violence from a current or past intimate partner?” and if they responded
afﬁrmatively, follow-up questions assessed the type(s) of violence experienced and the
perpetrator(s) of the most recent episode of violence. For SGMV, participants were asked
“Have you ever been the victim of violence because of your sexual orientation, gender
identity, or gender expression (like, how womanly or manly you seem to others)?” and if
they responded afﬁrmatively, follow-up questions assessed if the violence was because of
their sexual orientation and/or gender identity/gender expression, the type(s) of violence
experienced, and the perpetrator(s) of the most recent episode of violence.

2.3. Statistical Analyses

We calculated descriptive frequencies and means for all variables of interest, and
then for comparative analytic purposes, we created three groups based on participants’
sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). This included the following three groups:
(1) cisgender sexual minority women (SMW; cisgender women who identiﬁed as any non-
heterosexual identity, n = 131, 24.9%), (2) cisgender sexual minority men (SMM; cisgender
men who identiﬁed as any non-heterosexual identity, n = 336, 63.8%), and (3) gender
minority individuals (GMI, transgender and gender non-binary regardless of their sexual
orientation; n = 60, 11.3%).

We conducted chi-square tests for independence to test for the association between
SOGI group and scoring on the following three measures of mental health concerns:
psychological distress, PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms. In order to dichotomize
these three mental health measures, we used the standard clinical cut-off scores associated
with each standardized measure [53,59,60] to create two groups for each—those with
clinically signiﬁcant levels of symptoms and those without. We also conducted chi-square
tests for independence to compare scores on the alcohol and substance use measures across
the three SOGI groups. For these variables, we dichotomized scores based on whether or
not the participant reported potentially problematic use, which we operationalized as daily
alcohol and/or substance use.

We conducted another set of chi-square tests for independence to examine the associa-
tion between lifetime experiences of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Sexual/Gender
Minority-Based Violence (SGMV) and SOGI group, and compared their standardized
residual values. In addition, we used chi-square tests to examine potential associations
between lifetime experiences of SGMV and clinical cut-off scores on our mental health
variables (psychological distress, PTSD symptoms and depressive symptoms). Across all
chi-square tests of independence, we calculated standardized residual values for each cell

3. Results
3.1. Psychological Distress, PTSD, and Depressive Symptoms

Overall, 11.7% of the participants reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of psychological
distress (average t-score > 62 was 50.2, SD 10.09), as measured by the BSI-18 Global Severity
Index. A comparison of the SOGI categories indicated that GMI and SMM had nearly
identical levels of clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress (12.7% vs. 12.3%, Table 3)
indicating a score of 62 or more. They were followed by SMW who had lower levels of
clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress (9.5%), however these differences were not
statistically signiﬁcant. More than half (53.2%) of participants reported clinically signiﬁcant
levels of PTSD symptoms indicative of a probable diagnosis of PTSD (endorsing three
or more items on the PC-PTSD). A comparison of the three SOGI categories indicated
no statistically signiﬁcant differences in PTSD symptom severity, although there was a

slightly higher proportion of GMI who reported more severe PTSD symptoms indicating
the need for clinical attention. See Table 3 for comparisons of psychological distress and
PTSD symptom scores across the three SOGI categories.

The overall averaged score for the PHQ-9 scale was 7.37, SD 6.09. A little over
one third of the participants (35.7%) reported minimal or no levels of depressive symp-
toms, and 38.2% reported mild levels of depressive symptoms; thus approximately three
quarters (73.9%) of the sample were likely not experiencing depressive symptoms at a
severity level associated with a major depressive disorder (PHQ-9 ≤ 9). Moderate levels
of depressive symptoms were reported by 13.1% of participants, while another 13.0%
reported either moderately severe or severe levels of depressive symptoms, thus 26.1%
of the sample reported symptoms that would warrant treatment for a major depressive
disorder. A comparison of clinically signiﬁcant levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9
score ≥ 10) across three SOGI categories indicated no statistically signiﬁcant differences
(SMW = 22.5%; SMM = 28.4%; GMI = 21.4%). A comparison of severe levels of depressive
symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 20) across the three SOGI categories revealed statistically signiﬁcant
group differences, with GMI reporting the highest levels of severe depressive symptoms
(GMI = 8.9%; SMM = 4.3%; SMW = 1.6%). See Table 3 for comparisons of depressive
symptoms across the three SOGI categories.

3.2. Alcohol and Substance Use

Overall, 76.2% of participants reported having ever used alcohol (SMW = 63.6%;
SMM = 80.6%; GMI = 80%); 45.6% home brew (SMW = 24.8%; SMM = 54.7%; GMI = 41.5%);
43.5% tobacco (SMW = 33.6%; SMM = 49.1%; GMI = 33.3%), 39.1% marijuana (SMW = 31.3%;
SMM = 43.5%; GMI = 30.9%), and 27.7% miraa or khat (SMW = 16.5%; SMM = 30.6%;
GMI = 37.0%). SMW had considerably lower than expected residual values for all sub-
stances, whereas GMI were nearly comparable to SMM.

In terms of potentially problematic alcohol and substance use, we examined rates of
daily use across all types of alcohol and substances: 17.1% tobacco, 16.9% alcohol, 9.9% mar-
ijuana, 5.2% home brew and 0.8% miraa or khat. In order to understand group differences
in potentially problematic alcohol and substance use, we compared daily use among the
three SOGI categories. The association between daily alcohol use and SOGI group was
statistically signiﬁcant ( 2 = 6.74, p = 0.034), and the standardized residuals indicate that
the lower than expected levels of daily alcohol use among GMI contributed most to this
association. A similar pattern was seen with daily tobacco use, where the association be-
tween daily tobacco use and SOGI group was statistically signiﬁcant 2 = 12.78, p = 0.002),
and the standardized residuals indicate that the lower than expected levels of daily tobacco
use among GMI contributed most to the association. Examination of daily marijuana use
showed a different pattern, whereby the association between daily marijuana use and SOGI
group was statically signiﬁcant ( 2 = 12.10, p = 0.002), but examination of the standardized
residuals indicate that the higher than expected levels of daily marijuana use among SMM
contributed most to the association. See Table 3 for comparisons of potentially problematic
alcohol and substance use across the three SOGI categories.

3.3. Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Sexual/Gender Minority-Based Violence (SGMV)

Nearly half of participants indicated that they had ever experienced violence from an
intimate partner (42.5%), and 43.4% reported ever experiencing discriminatory violence
perpetrated against them because of their sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender
expression (i.e., Sexual/Gender Minority-Based Violence: SGMV). The association between
ever experiencing IPV and SOGI group was statistically signiﬁcant ( 2 = 19.061, p = 0.000),
and the standardized residuals indicate that higher than expected levels of IPV among
GMI contributed most to this association. A similar pattern was seen with SGMV, where
the association between SGMV and SOGI group was statistically signiﬁcant ( 2 = 43.917,
p = 0.000), and the standardized residuals indicate that the higher than expected levels of
SGMV among GMI contributed most to the association.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, x 10 of 22   0.000), and the standardized residuals indicate that higher than expected levels of IPV among GMI contributed most to this association. A similar pattern was seen with SGMV, where the association between SGMV and SOGI group was statistically significant (ӽ2 = 43.917, p = 0.000), and the standardized residuals indicate that the higher than expected levels of SGMV among GMI contributed most to the association. Among those who reported ever experiencing SGMV, 68.6% reported experiencing SGMV based on their sexual orientation, 25.5% based on their gender identity or expres-sion, and 5.5% based on both their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Among the four types of SGMV assessed, 42.1% reported only experiencing verbal vio-lence, 19.9% reported only experiencing physical violence, 16.9% reported only experienc-ing sexual violence, 5.6% reported only experiencing emotional violence, and 15.3% re-ported experiencing two of more of these types of violence. With regard to the perpetrator of the most recent SGMV incident, 31.6% of participants indicated that it was a former partner, boyfriend or ex-spouse, 18.2% indicated that it was a date, 13.3% indicated that it was a current spouse or partner, and 42.7% indicated that it was someone else (“other”). For the last category participants were asked to write in the type of person who perpetu-ated the last incident of SGMV they experienced and the following persons were indi-cated: friends (30.4%), parents/relatives (19.9%), stranger (19.3%), police (13.0%), healthcare provider (10.6%), religious leader (5.6%), government official (0.6%) and land-lord (0.6%).

See Table 3 for comparisons of rates of ever experiencing IPV and SGMV across the three
SOGI categories.

3.4. Sexual/Gender Minority-Based Violence and Mental Health

In order to understand the mental health consequences of those experiencing SGMV,
we compared scores for mental health variables among those who reported experiencing
violence based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression, and those
who did not report such violence. Those who experienced SGMV had signiﬁcantly higher
rates of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (35.0%) as compared to those who had
not experienced such violence (18.6%; p = 0.000). Similarly, those who had experienced
SGMV were more likely to report clinically signiﬁcant levels of PTSD symptoms (67.3%) as
compared to those who had not reported such violence (41.4%; p = 0.000). Psychological
distress (indicated by a total BSI score > 62) occurred slightly more frequently among
those who ever experienced SGMV than those who never experienced SGMV (13.5% vs.
9.9%) although this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.233). See Table 4 for
comparisons of mental health variables across SGMV categories.

Of the 527 total respondents, 281 offered responses regarding the type of additional
support and services they would like to receive. Two authors manually read all of the
responses and initially categorized them into seventeen main themes, discussing discrep-
ancies until they arrived at consensus. From these seventeen themes, the same authors
further collapsed similar themes into seven broader thematic content areas representing
the types of supports and services that participants stated they needed (not mutually exclu-
sive). These included: Counseling and Mental Health Services (n = 64; 22.8%), Financial
and Economic Empowerment (n = 55; 19.6%), Emotional/Peer Support (n = 42; 14.9%),
Community Organization Support and Advocacy (n = 41; 14.6%), Healthcare Assistance
and Medical Coverage (n = 39; 13.9%), Sexual Education and Prevention Items (n = 20;
7.1%), Nothing/Everything is Good (n = 20; 7.1%). Figure 1 displays the frequency with
which participants expressed each content area.

A similar pattern was seen with SGMV, where the association between SGMV and SOGI group was statistically significant (ӽ2 = 43.917, p = 0.000), and the standardized residuals indicate that the higher than expected levels of SGMV among GMI contributed most to the association. Among those who reported ever experiencing SGMV, 68.6% reported experiencing SGMV based on their sexual orientation, 25.5% based on their gender identity or expres-sion, and 5.5% based on both their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Among the four types of SGMV assessed, 42.1% reported only experiencing verbal vio-lence, 19.9% reported only experiencing physical violence, 16.9% reported only experienc-ing sexual violence, 5.6% reported only experiencing emotional violence, and 15.3% re-ported experiencing two of more of these types of violence. With regard to the perpetrator of the most recent SGMV incident, 31.6% of participants indicated that it was a former partner, boyfriend or ex-spouse, 18.2% indicated that it was a date, 13.3% indicated that it was a current spouse or partner, and 42.7% indicated that it was someone else (“other”).

With regard to the perpetrator of the most recent SGMV incident, 31.6% of participants indicated that it was a former partner, boyfriend or ex-spouse, 18.2% indicated that it was a date, 13.3% indicated that it was a current spouse or partner, and 42.7% indicated that it was someone else (“other”). For the last category participants were asked to write in the type of person who perpetu-ated the last incident of SGMV they experienced and the following persons were indi-cated: friends (30.4%), parents/relatives (19.9%), stranger (19.3%), police (13.0%), healthcare provider (10.6%), religious leader (5.6%), government official (0.6%) and land-lord (0.6%).

4. Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst published study that sought to document mental
health challenges, experiences with violence, alcohol and other substance use, and stated
needs among a sample of 527 SGM adults in Western Kenya. We also believe this to be the
ﬁrst combined sample of SGM individuals in Kenya with a focus on mental health and
related factors. These data will be helpful in planning for future prevention and treatment
efforts aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of SGM people in Kenya, as well as
public policy focused on the health and human rights of this population.

We examine our data through the lens of the Minority Stress Model, which connects
experiences of stigma and discrimination to mental health outcomes for SGM people.
This framing is important in the Kenyan context given that many SGM people experience
high levels of stigma and human rights violations such as physical assault from mobs
and vigilantes, rape and sexual assault by police, and institutional barriers to housing,
education, and employment [2–7]. The Minority Stress Model is useful in understanding
how exposure to persistent stress in the form of anti-LGBTQ prejudice, stigma, and dis-
crimination can contribute to elevated rates of mental health challenges for SGM people in
Kenya, as opposed to there being anything inherently dysfunctional about being a SGM

A similar pattern was seen with SGMV, where the association between SGMV and SOGI group was statistically significant (ӽ2 = 43.917, p = 0.000), and the standardized residuals indicate that the higher than expected levels of SGMV among GMI contributed most to the association. Among those who reported ever experiencing SGMV, 68.6% reported experiencing SGMV based on their sexual orientation, 25.5% based on their gender identity or expres-sion, and 5.5% based on both their sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. Among the four types of SGMV assessed, 42.1% reported only experiencing verbal vio-lence, 19.9% reported only experiencing physical violence, 16.9% reported only experienc-ing sexual violence, 5.6% reported only experiencing emotional violence, and 15.3% re-ported experiencing two of more of these types of violence. With regard to the perpetrator of the most recent SGMV incident, 31.6% of participants indicated that it was a former partner, boyfriend or ex-spouse, 18.2% indicated that it was a date, 13.3% indicated that it was a current spouse or partner, and 42.7% indicated that it was someone else (“other”).

Africa [37,38], and Zambia [39] in supporting the utility of the Minority Stress Model in
understanding the mental health challenges of SGM populations in Sub-Saharan Africa.

4.1. Psychological Distress and Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms

With regard to psychological distress, 11% of SGM adults in our sample reported
clinically signiﬁcant levels of psychological distress as measured by the BSI-18. This level is
higher than that found among 397 adults living with HIV (ages 18–61; 71.5% women; SOGI
not reported) in Western Kenya who were participating in psychosocial support groups
in conjunction with their HIV treatment [49]. That study used the 53-item version of the
BSI and found that only 3.5% scored in the clinical range on the BSI Global Severity Index.
Both adults living with HIV and SGM adults are populations that suffer marginalization
and oppression in Kenyan society, yet our sample demonstrated three times the rate of
clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress as was found among adults living with HIV. It
may be that their sample was gaining beneﬁts from psychosocial support groups and thus
were experiencing less distress, or there may be measurement differences in the BSI-18 and
BSI-53 versions of the scale or measurement challenges due to the cultural adjustments we
made to wording in our BSI-18 measure.

Although the Kenya Mental Health Policy 2015–2030 identiﬁes that there are inade-
quate data on the national prevalence of mental health, neurological, and substance use
disorders in Kenya [61], the Ministry of Health estimates that 10% of the country’s general
population suffers from a common mental disorder; and that this increases to 25% among
people receiving routine outpatient health services [62]. Assuming this estimate is correct,
the 11% of SGM people in our sample that reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of psycho-
logical distress are in alignment with what has been estimated for mental health disorders
among the general public. It is noteworthy though that the BSI-18 is a screening instrument
assessing psychological distress, and not a diagnostic tool assessing mental disorders, thus
caution is warranted in comparing psychological distress ﬁndings directly to rates of diag-
nosed mental disorders. Regardless, the rates of clinically signiﬁcant psychological distress
we found among SGM adults suggest that this population is experiencing mental health
challenges and should be addressed, and potentially prioritized, by the Kenya Ministry of
Health and in the Kenya Mental Health Policy 2015–2030.

More than half (52.2%) of SGM adults in our sample reported clinically signiﬁcant
levels of PTSD symptoms indicative of a probable diagnosis of PTSD. A comparison of the
three SOGI categories indicated no statistically signiﬁcant differences in PTSD symptom
severity, although there was a slightly higher proportion of gender minority individuals
with PTSD symptom proﬁles suggesting the need for clinical attention. These rates of
probable PTSD are nearly 5 times higher than what was found among 1147 residents of
the Maseno area in Kisumu County (the county of residence for 58.1% of our sample)
who participated in a cross-sectional household survey [63]. This study found that 48% of
participants had experienced a severe trauma, but the overall prevalence rate of probable
PTSD was 10.6%, deﬁned as a score of six or more on the Trauma Screening Questionnaire,
and the conditional probability of PTSD was 26%.

A cross-sectional, national, population-based cluster survey of 956 Kenyan adults
aged 18 and older used the same measure of PTSD as we did, and found that 33% of
their sample reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of PTSD [56]. The authors suggest that
their data represent national PTSD symptom prevalence for adults in Kenya, noting the
lack of national comparisons available. If their data are indicative of national levels of
PTSD symptoms in the general population, our data suggest that SGM adults in Kenya
represent a highly vulnerable population for PTSD. The Kenya Mental Health Policy 2015–
2030 designates ﬁve groups as vulnerable to mental health conditions (i.e., children and
adolescents, women, older persons, prisoners, people emerging from conﬂicts and disasters)
and thus in need of targeted mental health interventions. The policy acknowledges that
those engaged in conﬂict experience elevated stress and trauma that can lead to mental
disorders. Our data suggest that SGM adults may fall within the group that experiences

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

14 of 22

societal conﬂict, as evidenced by our data on both violence and PTSD, and thus warrant
consideration as a vulnerable group in the Kenya Mental Health Policy.

4.2. Depressive Symptoms

Data on depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9 demonstrated that approximately
three quarters (73.9%) of the sample were likely not experiencing depressive symptoms at a
severity level associated with a major depressive disorder (PHQ-9 ≤ 9). Given the amount
of stress and oppression members of this community face in Kenya, it is encouraging
that this percentage is as high as it is. Despite this, 26.1% of our sample did report symp-
toms that would warrant treatment for a major depressive disorder. The only depression
symptom difference among our three SOGI groups was with severe levels of depressive
symptoms, whereby gender minority individuals reported the highest levels of severe
depressive symptoms.

Our overall rate of clinical levels of depressive symptoms (26.1%) was lower than
that found in the cross-sectional, national, population-based cluster survey of 956 Kenyan
adults previously referenced, as they also used the PHQ-9 to measure depressive symptoms
and found that 36.5% of their sample reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of depressive
symptoms [56]. As with PTSD, the authors suggest that their data represent national major
depressive disorder symptom prevalence for adults in Kenya, noting the lack of national
comparisons available. The lower rates of depressive symptoms found among our SGM
participants may be a result of our sampling strategies. Since we relied heavily on member
organizations afﬁliated with a regional Kenyan CSO focused on SGM health and human
rights, it may be that participants were more likely to be those connected to SGM services
and programs. These connections with other SGM individuals and organizations may have
provided social support that buffered participants from experiencing more severe levels of
depressive symptoms.

Three studies on GBMSM in Kenya also used the PHQ-9, and from the data reported
in two of these studies it appears that our rates of not experiencing a major depressive
disorder were slightly higher than a study on the coast (58%) but closer to the combined
dataset from three regions in Kenya (69.4%) [4,5]. When examining elevated rates of
depressive symptomatology, in the current sample we found that 13% of participants
reported moderately severe or severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 15), which was
slighter higher than that found among GBMSM in a similar region in Western Kenya
(10.5%) [64] and in the three-region dataset (12.2%) [5], but lower than that found among
GBMSM on the Coast (23.2%) [4]. Examination of PHQ-9 data at these two ends of the
depressive symptom continuum are clinically meaningful when using a brief tool such
as the PHQ-9, as the original validation studies found that scores less than 10 seldom
occurred in individuals with major depressive disorders while scores of 15 or greater
usually signiﬁed the presence of a major depressive disorder [53]. In addition, the PHQ-9
has been used with various populations in Kenya and has been determined to be a reliable
measure of depressive symptomatology [65].

4.3. Alcohol and Substance Use

With regard to alcohol and substance use, more than three quarters (76.2%) of the
sample reported ever using alcohol, followed by home brew (45.6%), tobacco (43.5%),
and marijuana (39.1%). Across the full sample, daily use was most common for alcohol
(16.9%) and tobacco (17.1%), followed by marijuana (9.9%). Statistically signiﬁcant SOGI
group differences in daily use were revealed for these three substances, with GMI reporting
signiﬁcantly lower rates of daily use for alcohol and tobacco, and SMM reporting signiﬁ-
cantly higher rates of daily use for marijuana (as compared to the other groups). Across
these three categories, SMM reported the highest levels of daily use (tobacco = 21.4%;
alcohol = 19.4%; marijuana = 13.3%).

The elevated levels of alcohol and substance use we found among sexual minority
men are in alignment with prior studies of GBMSM in Kenya, although these studies

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

15 of 22

measured it using a more comprehensive questionnaire that assessed problematic alcohol
and substance use. The GBMSM sample in Western Kenya revealed that nearly half (49.9%)
of participants reported harmful alcohol use, whereas the three-region and coastal samples
reported 44.0% and 44.6% respectively.

These rates are higher than those found among the 1147 participants in the cross-
sectional household survey in the Maseno area in Kisumu County previously referenced,
whereby prevalence of lifetime alcohol use for women was 6.8% and for men was 14.5%;
and prevalence of hazardous alcohol use was 9.5% for men and 2.9% for women [66]. In a
nationally representative household survey of 4203 adults aged 18–69 years conducted in
Kenya, nearly 40% of respondents reported having ever consumed alcohol, 40.4% reported
consuming alcohol within the past 7 days, and 12.7% reported heavy episodic drinking
(six or more drinks on at least one single occasion per month) [66]. Our data, and those
from GBMSM studies, illustrates that alcohol use, and potentially problematic alcohol
use, appears to be elevated among SGM individuals in Kenya. This may be related to
members of the SGM community ﬁnding access to others who share their sexual orientation
and/or gender identity in social venues where alcohol is served, or to the use of alcohol
as a way to feel more comfortable interacting with other LGBTQ people due to societal
stigma and shame. It also may be that SGM individuals are using alcohol as a way to
self-medicate against the pain and suffering they experience as a result of societal stigma
and discrimination.

4.4. Intimate Partner Violence and SGM-Based Violence

Our study expanded the scope of data on violence-related data from those of GBMSM
in Kenya by reporting data on lifetime experiences of violence related to sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, and/or gender expression (SGM-based violence; SGMV), as well as
intimate partner violence. We found that rates of lifetime SGMV (43.4%) and IPV (43.2%)
were quite similar for the full sample, and that these rates were higher for gender minority
individuals (SGMV = 84.2%; IPV = 69.9%). These higher rates of violence experienced
by gender minority individuals is similar to data from 273 sexual and gender minorities
assigned female at birth in Western Kenya where 27.7% of the participants experienced
violence due to their sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression, but
these rates were two times higher (32.8% to 37.1%) among those whose gender expression
was masculine (35.2%), androgynous/all-gender (37.1%) or who did not use a gender
expression or role term (32.8%) [45].

Our rates of reported lifetime SGMV were comparable for cisgender sexual minority
women (37.7%) and cisgender sexual minority men (38.3%). In addition, these rates were
similar to the lower end of the range of recent physical or psychological trauma reported
in the Anza Mapema study in Kisumu, where they found 39.1% of GBMSM in their
mixed sample of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants reported such trauma,
as did 51.5% of GBMSM in their HIV-negative sample [6,64]. Data from Coastal Kenya
demonstrated slightly higher rates, with 66.9% of GBMSM reporting forced or coerced
sex, physical abuse, emotional abuse, or threats or intimidation related to their same-sex
behavior within the past year [4]. Korhonen et al. 3-site dataset of 1476 GBMSM found
similar rates of recent trauma or abuse related to same-sex behavior, with a prevalence
of 51.2% [5]. Our rates of SGM-based violence were generally lower and were based on
lifetime violence vs. these other studies which focused on more recent violence (2 weeks to
1 year). Our lower rates of violence may be related to lower rates of sex work reported in
our sample (10.2%) as opposed to rates ranging from 31.3% sex work in the last 3 months
to 63.9% sex work ever.

4.5. SGM-Based Violence and Mental Health

Comparisons of those who did and did not experience SGM-related violence on our
various mental health variables revealed associations between violence and some mental
health indicators but not others. There were statistically signiﬁcant differences between

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

16 of 22

those who had experienced SGM-related violence and those who had not with regard to
their levels of depressive symptoms. When examining levels of depressive symptoms that
warrant therapeutic intervention (moderately severe and severe), those who experienced
SGM-related violence had double these rates, as compared to those who reported no SGM-
related violence (18.6% vs. 9.2%). This association between SGM violence and elevated
levels of depressive symptoms has also been reported in prior studies with GBMSM,
both in bivariate and multivariate analyses [5,6]. This is believed to be the ﬁrst study to
demonstrate this in a sample that included both cisgender sexual minority woman and
gender minority individuals in Kenya.

PTSD symptoms were found to be signiﬁcantly higher among those who experienced
SGM-related violence. Among those who reported experiencing SGM-related violence,
two-thirds (67.6%) reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of PTSD symptoms, as compared
to less than half (42.2%) of those who had not experienced. Psychological distress scores
did not vary signiﬁcantly between those who did and did not experience SGM-related
violence, with 13.7% of those who experienced violence reported clinically signiﬁcant levels
of psychological distress, and 10.3% of those who did not experience violence reported
clinically signiﬁcant levels of distress.

4.6. Supports and Services Needed

Just over half of the participants (53.3%) responded to an open-ended question at the
end of the survey asking respondents to indicate additional support and services that are
needed for SGM people in Kenya. The six speciﬁc areas of support that they requested are
as follows (listed from most to least frequently requested): Counseling and Mental Health
Services, Financial and Economic Empowerment, Emotional/Peer Support, Community
Organization Support and Advocacy, Healthcare Assistance and Medical Coverage, Sexual
Education and Prevention Programs. Of note is that the most commonly provided type of
program in Western Kenya for SGM people (primarily GBMSM and transgender women)
is Sexual Education and Prevention Programs, and this was the least commonly requested
type of service.

These ﬁndings provide avenues for future interventions and programs that could be
delivered to the SGM community in Kenya. The most requested service (Counseling and
Mental Health Services) speaks to the need to develop SGM-sensitive and speciﬁc venues
for the provision of mental health services to members of the SGM community, as well as to
integrate mental health services into existing programs and services for SGM people. The
second most requested service (Financial and Economic Empowerment), along with our
demographic data which revealed that only 10.6% of the sample currently had full-time
employment, speaks to the need for economic development, job skills training, and other
employment-focused programs for SGM people. Due to pervasive societal stigma that
SGM people experience in Western Kenya, some may experience discrimination in hiring
and in the workplace. Support and networking services may assist SGM adults in both
acquiring and maintaining employment in venues that are SGM-afﬁrming.

4.7. Implications of the Findings for Public Health Practice and Public Policy

In July 2020 the Kenyan Ministry of Health’s Taskforce on Mental Health recom-
mended to the government that mental illness should be declared a National Emergency
of epidemic proportions, and urged them to prioritize mental health as a priority public
health and socioeconomic agenda [62]. The taskforce report and the Kenya Mental Health
Policy 2015–2030 [61] discuss current challenges in promoting mental health in Kenya due
to misconceptions and misinformation regarding the origins and course of mental health
disorders, and pervasive stigma and discrimination against those living with mental health
challenges. Public health and policy interventions for SGM people in Kenya will need to
be sensitive to more general societal and cultural understandings and conceptualizations
of mental health and mental disorders, while also addressing the unique needs of this
marginalized population. It is also important for both researchers and practitioners to be

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

17 of 22

mindful that mental health is a socially constructed and deﬁned concept, thus different
cultures and societies may vary in how they view the origins of mental health challenges,
how they determine what is mentally healthy and unhealthy, and what interventions they
perceive as being culturally appropriate. Findings and recommendations from the current
study, as well as those that have preceded it should be viewed through this cautionary lens.
Our data regarding the large number of participants reporting sub-clinical levels of
psychological distress and depressive symptoms suggest that SGM people and communi-
ties have developed resilience processes that serve to protect them from the deleterious
effects of both individual-level and structural-level oppression. Such resilience and protec-
tive processes have previously been demonstrated among gay and bisexual young men in
Kisumu in a study focused on both sexual and mental health [13]. Future practice efforts
aimed at improving the mental health and wellbeing of SGM communities in Kenya should
build collaborations with SGM-speciﬁc CSOs who work directly with these communities,
and have the indigenous knowledge and understanding of how to build on existing re-
silience processes and coping resources. Additional funding should also be directed toward
these CSOs in order to provide needed services for people in safe LGBTQ community
settings, by members of the SGM community.

All of these efforts should be designed with an awareness of the diverse ways in
which SGM people in Kenya may conceptualize and construct their sexual orientation,
gender identity and gender expression. Potential consumers of services may not adhere to
Western conceptualizations of sexuality and gender, and resist labels associated with the
LGBTQ nomenclature. In addition, mental health prevention and treatment efforts should
be cautious about adopting SGM-tailored programs and services developed in non-Kenyan
settings, as these may not address the culturally speciﬁc needs of clients.

Despite the promising data on general mental health, data on PTSD among SGM
people was discouraging, with more than half of SGM adults in our sample reporting
clinically signiﬁcant levels of PTSD symptoms. These ﬁndings suggest an urgent need to
provide SGM populations with mental health services that address the negative effects of
trauma and violence that many SGM people in Kenya experience due to LGBTQ-focused
stigma and discrimination. These services should be developed and provided using trauma-
informed principles of care, and be sensitive to the unique life circumstances and stressors
experienced by SGM people in Kenya. Our open-ended question regarding the needs of
SGM people in Kisumu demonstrated that the most frequent request was for Counseling
and Mental Health Services. There is currently a dearth of mental health providers and
services that support the mental health and wellbeing of SGM people in Kenya. All mental
health providers should be trained in therapeutic approaches that are LGBTQ-sensitive,
and mental health provider training programs should include modules speciﬁc to the needs
of SGM communities.

In addition to individual-level therapeutic approaches to improving the mental health
and wellbeing of SGM people and communities, SGM-based violence and those who
perpetrate it need to be addressed at community, cultural, and policy levels. Nearly half
of our sample reported experiencing at least one episode of anti-LGBTQ violence that
was perpetrated against them because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or
gender expression. In some instances, those in society who should be protecting Kenyan
citizens, namely police, healthcare providers, religious leaders, and government ofﬁcials,
perpetrated this violence. Two-thirds of participants who experienced such violence
reported clinically signiﬁcant levels of PTSD, and had double the rates of moderately
severe to severe depressive symptoms as compared to those who had never experienced
SGM-based violence. These associations support the Minority Stress Model projection
of increased mental health challenges among those who experience anti-LGBTQ stigma
and discrimination.

Cultural and community interventions that focus on destigmatizing SGM people
and communities are needed, including speciﬁc sensitization and stigma reduction inter-
ventions with various groups of individuals in service sector positions who have been

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

identiﬁed as potential perpetrators of violence (e.g., police, healthcare providers, religious
leaders). It will be helpful to create spaces for open dialogue and discussion between
members of the SGM community and those in various service sectors, in order to demystify
sexual orientation and gender identity and to ﬁnd commonalities across the groups. Such
discussions can beneﬁt from taking a human rights approach, and focusing on a shared
national identity as Kenyans. Each sector may need additional focus on the intersection
of their service provision and the SGM community. For instance, Kenya’s 2010 constitu-
tion anchors police reform in that it stipulates that the institution must protect Kenyan’s
fundamental rights and freedoms. Highlighting the humanity and fundamental human
rights of SGM people in Kenya may encourage police ofﬁcers to re-conceptualize their
role as protecting Kenyan citizens (regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity) and
their constitutional rights since the Kenyan constitution states that every person is equal
before the law and shall enjoy equal protection by the law. Media-based interventions also
may help to reduce SGM-based stigma through the presentation of LGBTQ Kenyans in
various social and occupational roles in an effort to normalize SGM people and their lived
experiences. Policy related to punishment for SGM-based violence and hate crimes also
needs to be institutionalized and enforced in order to prevent future acts of violence.

In order to create sustainable improvements in the mental health and wellbeing
of SGM people in Kenya, there needs to be a political level prioritization of LGBTQ
populations, and a securing of human rights and services outside of the HIV narrative. The
vast majority of health-related policy and resources that involve any segment of the SGM
community are currently focused on GBMSM, and more recently transgender women, and
their identiﬁcation as “key populations” for HIV prevention and treatment services. This
HIV work often focuses primarily on mechanics of viral transmission and sexual behavior,
is devoid of a consideration of cultural factors, and eliminates segments of the larger SGM
community such as cisgender sexual minority women and transgender men. It often fails
to take a holistic approach to the lives of SGM people, and puts a primary focus on sex and
sexuality—topics that are often taboo in Kenyan culture.

Although there has been an increased focus on improving mental health in Kenya,
especially with the release of the Kenya Mental Health Policy 2015–2030, there has not
been a speciﬁc focus on the mental health needs of SGM people in the country. This
invisibility of the SGM community in national policy on mental health further restricts
critical funding for mental health services that are urgently needed. Greater levels of social
integration of SGM people into mainstream society are needed, as well as advocacy and
education at all levels around understanding broader deﬁnitions of gender, sexuality, and
identity. Such efforts may occur with collaboration from LGBTQ-speciﬁc CSOs, as well
as allies that support afﬁrming and supportive messaging. Allies can also play a critical
role in joining LGBTQ activists in ﬁghting for equal rights and protections under the law,
such as the decriminalization of same-sex behavior. LGBTQ-inclusive health policies at
the local, county, and national levels are also needed to ensure that SGM people have
access to needed health services and feel comfortable accessing services in a safe and
afﬁrming environment. In order to truly improve the mental health and wellbeing of SGM
people in Kenya, multiple and varied efforts will be needed to protect this population from
exclusions, restrictions, harm and subsequent mental health challenges.

5. Conclusions

The substantial number of participants in this study who reported sub-clinical levels
of psychological distress and depressive symptoms in the midst of pervasive anti-SGM
stigma and violence in Kenya suggests that SGM people and communities have developed
resilience processes that serve to protect them from the deleterious effects of individual-
level and structural-level oppression. On the other hand, elevated rates of PTSD suggest
an urgent need to develop and deliver culturally appropriate mental health services for
SGM adults. These therapeutic interventions should be provided using trauma-informed
principles of care, and be sensitive to the lived experiences of SGM adults in Kenya and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1311

differences across SOGI categories. Community and policy-level interventions are also
needed to decrease SGM-based stigma and violence, increase SGM visibility and acceptance,
and create safe and afﬁrming venues for the delivery of both mental and physical health
care. In order to create sustainable improvements in the mental health and wellbeing of
SGM people in Kenya, there needs to be a political level prioritization of SGM populations,
and a securing of human rights and services outside of HIV-focused programs. The Kenya
Mental Health Policy 2015–2030 would also beneﬁt from an expansion to address the
unique mental health needs of SGM people and communities. In order to truly improve
the mental health and wellbeing of SGM people in Kenya, multiple and varied efforts will
be needed to protect this population from exclusions, restrictions, harm and subsequent
mental health challenges.
