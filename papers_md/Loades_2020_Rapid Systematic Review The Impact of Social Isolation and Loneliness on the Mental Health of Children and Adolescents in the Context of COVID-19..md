Rapid Systematic Review: The Impact of Social Isolation
and Loneliness on the Mental Health of Children and
Adolescents in the Context of COVID-19

Objective: Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how
loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents.
Method: For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1, 1946, and March 29,
2020. Of the articles, 20% were double screened using predeﬁned criteria, and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance.
Results: A total of 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the
mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n ¼ 51,576; mean age 15.3 years). In all, 61 studies were observational, 18 were lon-
gitudinal, and 43 were cross-sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retro-
spective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias, although longitudinal studies were of better
methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time at which loneliness was measured
and between 0.25 and 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness.
Conclusion: Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and most likely anxiety during and after
enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventive support and early intervention where
possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.
Key words: loneliness, pandemic, COVID-19, disease containment, mental health

distancing, and home quarantine. Children and adolescents
are experiencing a prolonged state of physical isolation from
their peers, teachers, extended families, and community
networks. Quarantine in adults generally has negative psy-
chological effects including confusion, anger, and post-
traumatic distress.1,2 Duration of quarantine,
fear of
infection, boredom, frustration, lack of necessary supplies,
lack of information, ﬁnancial loss, and stigma appear to
increase the risk of negative psychological outcomes.1 Social
distancing and school closures may therefore increase
mental health problems in children and adolescents, already
at higher
risk of developing mental health problems
compared to adults3 at a time when they are also

experiencing anxiety over a health threat and threats to
family employment/income.

Social distancing and school closures are likely to result
in increased loneliness in children and adolescents whose
usual social contacts are curtailed by the disease contain-
ment measures. Loneliness is the painful emotional experi-
ence of a discrepancy between actual and desired social
contact.4 Although social isolation is not necessarily syn-
onymous with loneliness, early indications in the COVID-
19 context indicate that more than one-third of adolescents
report high levels of loneliness5,6 and almost half of 18- to
24-year olds are lonely during lockdown.7 There are well
established links between loneliness and mental health.8

REVIEW: SOCIAL ISOLATION AND MENTAL HEALTH

and to determine whether disease containment measures
including quarantine and social isolation are predictive of
future mental health problems. We included cross-sectional,
observational, retrospective, and case control studies if
studies included mainly children and adolescents who had
experienced loneliness or had used validated measures of
social isolation and mental health problems. To capture the
possible effects of social isolation and the expected mediator
(ie,
loneliness) on mental health problems, we included
search terms to capture these two areas.

A truncated quality assessment was conducted by one
author (SR) using criteria adapted from the National In-
stitutes of Health (NIH)14 (Table 1).

Data Synthesis
We conducted a narrative synthesis within the following
categories: (1) the impact of loneliness on mental health in
healthy populations (further divided into cross-sectional and
longitudinal evidence); (2) pandemic-speciﬁc ﬁndings; and
(3) intervention studies.

METHOD
We conducted a rapid review to provide a timely evidence
synthesis to inform urgent healthcare policy decision mak-
ing.9 A rapid review adheres to the essential principles of
systematic reviews, including scientiﬁc rigor, transparency,
and reproducibility. 9,10 It uses “abbreviated” systematic

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Table S1, Table S2, and Table S3, available online,
provide the full search strategy. Brieﬂy, we searched
MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and the Cochrane
Library. Our search terms were informed by recent rapid
reviews in the COVID-19 context1 and included deﬁni-
tions of loneliness and social
isolation to capture the
impact of social distancing and school closures. Terms
captured “children” or “adolescents” AND “quarantine”
or “social isolation” or “loneliness” AND mental health
related terms with a focus on the most common mental
health problems in this age group, namely, depression
and anxiety.

Peer-reviewed studies were selected according to the
following inclusion criteria: published between 1946 and
March 29, 2020; reported primary research; included pre-
dominantly children/adolescents (mean age <21 years)13;
published in English (Web of Science only); participants
had experienced either social isolation or loneliness; and
valid assessment of depression, anxiety, trauma, obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), mental health, or mental
well-being.

Study Selection and Data Collection
We checked 20% of all study eligibility results (both
included and excluded) to ensure adherence to the eligibility
criteria. Data were extracted into a purpose-designed data-
base. A random 20% of the data was double-entered to
ensure accuracy.

RESULTS
We located 4,531 articles (Figure 1), of which 83 articles (80
studies) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 18 articles (17
studies) reported on the impact of loneliness in individuals
with a variety of health conditions, including mental health
problems (12 studies), physical health problems (one study)
and neurodevelopmental
(4 studies). The
remaining 65 articles reported on 63 studies that examined
the impact of loneliness or disease containment measures on
healthy children and adolescents. For the purposes of this
rapid review, we will focus our analyses on these 63 studies.

search results.15

The 63 studies were mainly from the United States,
China, Europe, and Australia. Included studies were also
conducted in India, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand, Israel, Iran,
and Russia. A total of 61 studies were observational, and 2
studies reported on interventions. Of the 61 observational
studies, 43 studies were cross-sectional only, 6 were longi-
tudinal only, and 12 reported both cross-sectional and lon-
gitudinal ﬁndings. One study was a retrospective study after a
pandemic. In cross-sectional studies, likely confounders (eg,
adversity, socioeconomic status [SES]) were rarely controlled
for, meaning that the association between loneliness and
mental health outcomes in these studies is very likely to be
inﬂated.16 Four longitudinal studies used multi-informant
approaches, including self-report and parent and/or teacher
report to assess mental health outcomes. Importantly, they
typically assessed and controlled for confounds and could
assess the most plausible direction of causality between
loneliness/social isolation and mental health.

Impact of Loneliness on Mental Health
Table 217-60 and Table 361-79 describe the 60 studies that
examined the impact of loneliness on mental health. A total
of 53 studies stated that they measured the impact of
loneliness on mental health. Seven studies stated that they
measured the impact of social isolation39,45,50,59,69,70,72 on
mental health, but the social isolation measures used were

A total of 45 studies examined the cross-sectional rela-
tionship between depressive symptoms and loneliness
isolation.17,19,20-24,28-30,32-38,40-42,44,46-49,
and/or
51-56,58,61,63,66,68,73-79 The majority were conducted in
adolescent (N ¼ 23) and young adult (N ¼ 16) samples,
although 6 studies included children under the age of 10
years. Most reported moderate to large correlations (0.12 (cid:2)
r (cid:2) 0.81), and most included a measure of depressive
symptoms. Two studies reported odds ratios, with those
who were lonely 5.846 to 40 times51 more likely to score
above clinical cut-offs for depression. The associations were
stronger in older participants35 and in female participants.47
However, the strength and direction of the associations did
not differ by age of the sample. Fewer studies (N ¼ 23)

examined symptoms of anxiety. Those that did found small
to moderate associations between anxiety and loneliness/
social isolation (0.18 (cid:2) r (cid:2) 0.54). The duration of loneli-
ness was more strongly associated with anxiety than in-
tensity of loneliness.25,41 Social anxiety was moderately to
strongly associated with loneliness/social isolation (0.33 (cid:2)
r (cid:2) 0.72) and there were moderate associations between
generalized anxiety and loneliness/social isolation (r ¼ 0.37,
0.40).45,30 One study found a small association between
panic and loneliness (r ¼ 0.13).75,76 In the single study that
reported odds ratios, being lonely was associated with
increased odds of being anxious by 1.63 to 5.49 times.51
Positive associations were also reported between social

conducted in childhood (N ¼ 6), or adolescence (N ¼ 8),
although three were in university students. Most (N ¼ 12)
had only one follow up time point, usually between 1 and 3
years.

In all, 12 of the 15 studies found that loneliness is
associated with depression and explained a signiﬁcant
amount of the variance in severity of depression symptoms
several months to several years later.61,62,64,65,67-72,74-77,79,80
Two studies found that loneliness in childhood at age 5
years was not associated with depression several years
later,73,74 although other studies that assessed loneliness
during childhood found evidence that it is associated with
subsequent depression.61,64 One large study of adolescents
(n ¼ 3,088) found that loneliness was not associated with
depression 1 year later.63 There were mixed ﬁndings in
another large study of adolescents (n ¼ 541), which found a
signiﬁcant association between loneliness and subsequent

depression, although this did not hold in a cross-lagged
model,69 suggesting a possible bidirectional relationship
between the variables. A study of university students found
evidence of a sex difference, with loneliness being associated
with later depression in female participants but not in male
participants.70 In a large longitudinal cohort of vulnerable
young people, aged 11 to 17 years, after controlling for
caregiver neglect and other relevant covariates, a substantial
increase in self-reported peer isolation (1 SD) was associated
with an increase in depression symptoms (0.49 SD).62
Duration of peer loneliness rather than intensity of peer
loneliness was associated with depression 8 years later (ie,
from age 5 to age 13 years);
in contrast, family-related
loneliness was not independently associated with subse-
quent depression.73

Three of the four studies that examined the longitudinal
effect of loneliness on anxiety found that loneliness was

associated with later anxiety.63,71,78 Two of these studies
assessed social anxiety, and one measured anxiety as a broad
construct. One study did not ﬁnd that loneliness/social
isolation at age 5 years was associated with anxiety at age 12
years.72 One study of young adolescents found differences by
sex, with loneliness being associated with later social anxiety
in male participants but not female participants.71 None of
these studies measured loneliness during childhood.

Other mental health outcomes reported over time
included internalizing symptoms which were associated
with prior loneliness in primary school age children,64 and
suicidal ideation during adolescence, which was not asso-
ciated with prior loneliness during childhood.74

Impact of Social Isolation in an Infectious Disease
Context
One study60 reported on mental health and social isolation
in the context of different infections, including H1N1, se-
vere acute respiratory syndrome, and avian ﬂu (Table 2).
This retrospective study included 398 parents of exposed
children from the United States, Canada, and Mexico, of
whom 20.9% experienced social
isolation and a further
3.8% had been quarantined. Parents of children reported on
their child’s experience of trauma and on their current
mental health. One-third of parents whose children had
been subjected to disease containment measures said that
their child had needed mental health service input because
of their pandemic-related experiences. The most frequently
reported diagnoses were acute stress disorder (16.7%),
adjustment disorder (16.7%), grief (16.7%), and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (6.2%). Two different
parent-reported measures of PTSD symptoms found that
those children exposed to disease containment measures
scored signiﬁcantly higher
for PTSD symptoms post-
pandemic. On the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version, 28%
of children who had experienced isolation/quarantine scored
about the cut-off for PTSD, compared to 5.8% of those
who had not experienced isolation/quarantine. Similarly, on
the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, 30% of children who
experienced isolation/quarantine scored above the cut-off
for PTSD, compared to 1.1% of those who had not expe-
size: Cramer V ¼
rienced isolation/quarantine (effect
0.449). Mean scores were four times higher in the isolated/
quarantined group than in those who had not been isolated/
quarantined. The most common trauma symptoms in the
quarantined/isolated
avoidance/numbing
group were
(57.8%), re-experiencing (57.8%), and arousal (62.5%).

Interventions
Two randomized controlled trials measured loneliness and
mental health outcomes following an intervention aimed at

the general population (peer mentoring81 and classroom
based82 (Table 4). In both instances, the comparator was no
intervention/with follow-up and education as usual. A
relatively intensive peer mentor program, with an adult
mentor, 4 to 6 hours per month for 4 months on average,
reduced loneliness and mental health problems (small to
medium effects) for victims of bullying and victimization.
However, a brief (two-session) universal classroom-based
program delivered in schools including psychosocial sup-
port through peer mentors and a staff mental health support
team did not reduce loneliness. Neither intervention spe-
ciﬁcally addressed mental health problems that had devel-
oped in the context of loneliness; therefore, we are unable to
answer our second review question, which was what in-
terventions are effective for individuals who have developed
mental health problems as a result of social isolation or
loneliness.

DISCUSSION
This rapid systematic review of 63 studies of 51,576 par-
ticipants found a clear association between loneliness and
mental health problems
in children and adolescents.
Loneliness was associated with future mental health prob-
lems up to 9 years later. The strongest association was with
depression. These ﬁndings were consistent across studies of
children, adolescents, and young adults. There may also be
sex differences, with some research indicating that loneliness
was more strongly associated with elevated depression
symptoms in girls and with elevated social anxiety in
boys.70,71 The length of loneliness appears to be a predictor
of future mental health problems.73 This is of particular
relevance in the COVID-19 context, as politicians in
different countries consider the length of time that schools
should remain closed, and the implementation of social
distancing within schools.

Furthermore, in the one study that examined mental
health problems after enforced isolation and quarantine in
children who had experienced
previous pandemics,
enforced isolation or quarantine were ﬁve times more
likely to require mental health service input and experi-
enced higher levels of posttraumatic stress. This suggests
that the current social distancing measures enforced on
children because of COVID-19 could lead to an increase
in mental health problems, as well as possible post-
traumatic stress. These results are consistent with pre-
liminary unpublished data emerging from China during
the COVID-19 pandemic, where children and adolescents
aged 3 to 18 years are commonly displaying behavioral
manifestations of anxiety, including clinginess, distraction,
and
fear of

irritability.83 Furthermore, a large survey of young adult
students in China has reported that around one in four are
least mild anxiety symptoms.84 In the
experiencing at
from the Co-SPACE
United Kingdom, early results
(COVID-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Chil-
dren in Epidemics) online survey of more than 1,500
parents suggest high levels of COVID-19(cid:3)related worries
and fears, with younger children (aged 4(cid:3)10 years)
signiﬁcantly more worried than older children and ado-
lescents (aged 11(cid:3)16 years).85,86

In addition to the more direct effects of enforced
loneliness as an unintended
isolation and quarantine,
consequence of disease containment measures seems to
be particularly problematic for young people.5,7 This
may be because of the particular importance of the peer
identity and support during this develop-
group for
mental stage.87,88 This propensity to experience loneli-
ness may make young people particularly vulnerable to
loneliness in the COVID-19 context, which, based on
our ﬁndings, may further exacerbate the mental health
impacts of
the disease containment measures. More
studies have examined the relationship between loneli-
ness and depression than between loneliness and anxiety.
Losing links to other people and feeling excluded can
in an affective response of depression.89 Social
result
anxiety was more strongly associated with loneliness than
other anxiety subtypes. This may be because social
anxiety is triggered by a perceived threat to social re-
lationships or status.90

It is difﬁcult to predict the effect that COVID-19 will
have on the mental health of children and young people.
The subjective social isolation experienced by study par-
ticipants did not mirror the current features of social
isolation experienced by many children and adolescents
isolation was not enforced upon the
worldwide. Social
participants, nor was social
isolation almost ubiquitous
across their peer groups and across the communities in
which they lived. As loneliness involves social compari-
son,91 it is possible that the shared experience of social
isolation imposed by disease containment measures may
mitigate the negative effects. The studies were also not in
the context of an uncertain but dangerous threat
to
health. These features limit the extent to which we can
extrapolate from existing evidence to the current context.
To make evidence-based decisions on how to mitigate the
impact of a second wave, we need further research on the
mental health impacts of social isolation in the disease
containment context of a global pandemic.
In this
context, to more speciﬁcally understand the impacts of
loneliness, measures such as the Loneliness and Aloneness
Scale for Children and Adolescents (LACA) that assess the

duration and the intensity of loneliness, and that separate
peer-related loneliness
from parent-related loneliness
could be elucidating.

This rapid systematic review was conducted rapidly, in
3 weeks, to inform our response to COVID-19. We double
screened 20% of all articles and data extracted. In line with
Cochrane rapid review guidance,10 gray literature, and trial
registry databases were not searched, hand-search strategies
were not used, and only English-language publications were
included, meaning that some relevant studies may have
been missed. During the rapid data extraction phase, there
was no scope to contact authors to request any missing
information. The main limitation of this review is the lack
of high-quality studies investigating mental health problems
after enforced isolation. All but one study investigated social
isolation that was not enforced on young people and was
not common across a peer group. The effect of widespread
social distancing could mitigate against the social isolation
described with increased use of Internet-mediated relation-
ships, which can be beneﬁcial to adolescents.92 Most studies
were cross-sectional, and therefore the direction of the as-
sociation cannot be inferred. Few studies used independent
(ie, not self-report) measures of mental health or social
thereby increasing the risk of bias.
isolation/loneliness,
Furthermore, the studies were mainly observational and did
not consistently control
for potential confounders. The
majority of studies focused on depression and anxiety, and
other mental health problems are important to measure in
future research.

However, we used all available evidence on social
isolation and loneliness to inform the likely outcome for
healthy children and adolescents subjected to social isola-
tion. The results were consistent across all study method-
ology for depression (but less so for anxiety), suggesting that
these results are reliable. The results are also consistent with
one study investigating mental health problems in chil-
dren60 after pandemics, improving our conﬁdence in the
results. However, the postpandemic study has several limi-
tations in that the sample was self-selecting, and the de-
mographics of the children and the time elapsed since the
experience were not reported. There is little evidence per-
taining to interventions. We have focused on healthy pop-
ulations in this review and will report on those with pre-
existing conditions
including mental health problems
elsewhere.

Implications for Policy and Practice
The review indicates that
loneliness is associated with
adverse mental health in children and adolescents. There is
limited evidence that indicates speciﬁc interventions to
prevent loneliness or to reduce its effects on mental health

isolation,

and well-being. However, there are well-established prac-
tical and psychological strategies that may help to promote
child and adolescent mental health in the context of
example, during the
involuntary social
COVID-19 pandemic. Reducing the impact of enforced
physical distancing by maintaining the structure, quality,
and quantity of social networks, and helping children and
adolescents to experience social rewards, to feel part of a
group, and to know that there are others to whom they can
look for support is likely to be important.8 Finding ways to
give children and adolescents a sense of belonging within
the family and to feel that they are part of a wider com-
munity should be a priority. Therefore, providing accurate
information about the relative risks and beneﬁts of social
media and networking to parents who overestimate the
dangers of allowing their children too much screen time
may help young people to access the beneﬁts of virtual social
contact.

However, simply increasing the frequency of contact
may not address young people’s subjective experience of
loneliness.39 Helping young people to identify valued alter-
native activities and build structure and purpose into periods
of involuntary social isolation may help to provide a wider
range of rewards.93 Addressing negative thoughts about social
encounters (eg, self-blame, self-devaluation) may also be
effective.30,94 During periods of prolonged social isolation,
digital technology that provides evidence-based interventions
to help young people to reappraise their thoughts and to
change their behavior within the conﬁnes of the home setting
may be particularly welcome.

Although this review did not provide evidence on in-
terventions to improve social
isolation or loneliness in
healthy children and adolescents, given social distancing,
digital interventions may be appropriate. A computerized
self-help program that is based on cognitive(cid:3)behavioral
therapy (CBT), BRAVE-TA was shown to be effective for
anxiety following the Christchurch earthquake in New
Zealand.95 Furthermore, computerized CBT,
such as
MoodGym, SPARX, and “Think, Feel, Do” generally have
small but positive effects on mental health.96,97 Although
mobile applications for mental health have been found to be
generally acceptable to children and adolescents, there is a
lack of convincing evidence of effectiveness on intended
mental health outcomes98 and few mobile health apps have
been thoroughly tested.97 Self-help interventions including
bibliotherapy99 and computerized therapy100 have shown a
moderate positive effect size when compared to control
groups although they are generally less effective than face to

face therapies.101 Importantly,
reviews have tended to
conclude that effects are better if there is some therapist
input97,101 and if parents are involved especially for younger
children.96,97

The rapid review suggests that loneliness that may result
from disease containment measures in the COVID-19
context could be associated with subsequent mental health
problems in young people. Strategies to prevent the devel-
opment of
should be an international
priority.
