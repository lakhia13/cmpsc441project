Objective:  We  assessed  the  direct  and  indirect  relationships  between  sleep 
quality, mental health, and physical activity with quality of life (QOL) in college 
and university students.

Methods:  In  a  cross-sectional  design,  3,380  college  students  (60%  females; 
age  =  22.7  ±  5.4) from four continents (Africa: 32%; America: 5%; Asia: 46%; and 
Europe: 15%; others: 2%) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); 
Insomnia  Severity  Index  (ISI);  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale  (ESS);  the  Depression, 
Anxiety,  and  Stress  Scale  21  (DASS);  the  International  Physical  Activity 
Questionnaire short-form (IPAQ); and the World Health Organization Quality of 
Life-BREF (WHOQOL-Brief).

Results:  We  showed  that  sleep  quality,  insomnia,  and  depression  had  direct 
negative  effects  on  the  physical  domain  of  QOL  (β  =  −0.22,  −0.19,  −0.31, 
respectively, p  <  0.001). There was a strong negative direct association between 
depression  and  the  psychological  domain  of  QOL  (β  =  −0.60,  z  =  −22.21, 
p  <  0.001). Both stress and PSQI had direct effects on social relationships QOL 
(β  =  0.11;  z  =  4.09;  and  β  =  −0.13;  z  =  −7.40,  respectively,  p  <  0.001).  However, 
depression  had  the  strongest  direct  impact  on  social  relationships  QOL 
(β  =  −0.41, z  =  −15.79, p <  0.001).
Conclusion: The overall QOL of university students is associated with their sleep 
quality,  mental  health,  and  physical  activity  warranting  further  interventional 
studies aiming at improving students’ quality of life.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines quality of life 
(QOL)  as  “individuals’  perception  of  their  position  in  life  in  the 
context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in 
relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” (1). In 
recent years, the importance of QOL has been acknowledged and 
prioritized by the WHO and many governments across the world. This 
increased priority is attributed to the understanding of QOL’s link with 
critical health issues including chronic diseases and mental disorders 
(2).  In  particular,  the  QOL  of  university  students  has  received  an 
increased attention, as studies have reported that a substantial number 
of students are subjected to psychological and emotional distress and 
burnout.  Indeed,  University  students  may  find  academia  stressful 
because it implies several simultaneous stressors (e.g., the change in 
lifestyle, time management, increased responsibility, financial stress) 
with no guarantee of a favorable return. Therefore, the prevalence of 
mental  disorders,  especially  stress  and  depression,  has  increased 
dramatically  in  recent  decades,  affecting  a  wide  range  of  student 
cohorts (3–5). A lower perception of QOL domains/subcomponents 
(i.e., physical, psychological, social, and environmental) may result 
from this pressure (5). This is concerning given the important role of 
well-being  in  academic  performance  and  in  reducing  students’ 
dropout rates (6). Few studies have examined the connection between 
mental health disorders and QOL in college students, with most of the 
previous research focusing on medical science students (4). Moutinho 
et al. (3) found a high prevalence of mental health disorders among 
Brazilian  medical  students,  including  substantial  prevalence  of 
depression, anxiety, and stress levels, affecting their QOL. Furthermore, 
Freitas et al. (7) reported an association between QOL and symptoms 
of depression, anxiety, and stress in college students, showing that 
approximately 50% of the sample exhibiting mild to severe symptoms. 
They also reported that depressive symptoms were linked to lower 
overall QOL, especially in the psychological domain (7).

Facing  the  above  mentioned  myriad  of  stressors,  university 
students might find their sleep compromised. Studies have shown that 
students could be subjected to several sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia, 
daytime sleepiness, non-restorative sleep) that can potentially affect 
their  mental  health,  and  academic  performance  (8,  9).  University 
students usually sacrifice their sleep to compensate the lack of time 
imposed by their lifestyle (e.g., academic pressure, financial stress, 
screen time, social engagement). For instance, acute sleep restriction 
or deprivation can lead to a range of undesirable effects, from simple 
mood  disruption  (10)  to  more  complex  increase  in  systemic 
inflammation (11). When such sleep deprivation becomes chronic, it 
can contribute to mental health issues (12), metabolic disorders that 
lead  to  overweight  and  obesity  (13),  and/or  an  increased  pain 
sensitivity  (11),  thereby  impacting  physical  health  perception. 
Furthermore, sleep deprivation can result in emotional and social 
issues, cognitive function impairment, reduced work and academic 
performance,  and/or  increased  daytime  sleepiness,  among  other 
consequences (14). Altogether, sleep deprivation/restriction affects 
several aspects of health, potentially affecting the QOL. However, this 
relationship has not been studied in university students.

Of  particular  interest,  physical  activity  (PA)  may  play  a 
cardioprotective role (15) and may counteract the sleep deprivation-
induced cognitive degradation (16). Therefore, by engaging in regular 
PA,  university  students  can  experience  a  variety  of  benefits  that 

contribute to a more positive QOL. Indeed, PA has been associated 
with improvements in at least one of the four QOL domains (i.e., 
physical,  psychological,  environmental  health,  and/or  social 
interaction) in university students (17). Moreover, PA could reduce 
perceived  stress,  enhance  well-being,  and  alleviate  mental  health 
symptoms (4), highlighting the importance of incorporating regular 
PA into the daily routines of university students to optimize their 
overall QOL.

The QOL of college students has been explored in the literature, 
most of which focusing on its’ separate domains. Our study considered 
a more holistic perspective to assess the relationship between QOL 
domains  and  three  key  factors:  (i)  sleep  quality,  (ii)  psychological 
factors, and (iii) PA levels, in an international sample of university 
students. Therefore, we aimed to establish a model of relationships 
between QOL, sleep, mental health, and physical activity in college 
students using structural equation modeling.

Materials and methods

We  conducted  a  web-based,  Google  Forms®  cross-sectional 
survey administered in three languages: Arabic, English, and French. 
The survey was released from 1st October 2021 to 31st of March 2022. 
The closing date has been chosen because it corresponded to the eve 
of Ramadan month for Muslims worldwide. We therefore avoided 
potential  interferences  of  Ramadan  observance  with  the  study 
outcomes (18). We promoted the survey via (i) social-media platforms 
(e.g., Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter), (ii) messaging applications 
(e.g., Viber, WhatsApp,) and (iii) official universities websites.

A  total  of  3,509  survey  responses  were  received  (see Table  1). 
Following the process of data cleaning based on inclusion criteria: 
University/College  students,  aged  18 years  or  more  at  the  time  of 
completing  the  survey,  not  taking  medication  for  chronic  illness 
conditions  and  exclusion  criteria:  Individuals  who  self-reported 
having been diagnosed with chronic sleep disorders were excluded 
from the study, 3,380 responses of students from 49 countries were 
included in our analysis.

The database has previously been used to set descriptive statistics 
about our sample in another article currently under review. The latter 
study does not use any results from the present manuscript.

Ethics

The study’s protocol was reviewed and received approval from the 
Ethics Committee of Qatar University (QU-IRB 1510-EA/21). The 
study strictly adheres to the ethical standards of the Declaration of 
Helsinki  (2013  and  its  subsequent  amendments).  Additionally, 
we ensured participant’s anonymity according to the guidelines in the 
General Data Protection Regulation.1 Participation in the study was 
voluntary, with participants having the option to withdraw from the 
study at any time without facing any penalties or consequences. Before 
commencing  the  survey,  participants  provided  online  informed 
consent for their involvement in the survey.

Data collection

Participation was limited to students who were aged 18 years or 
older at the time of completing the survey. A total of 129 individuals 
with self-reported diagnosis of chronic sleep disorders were excluded 
from the study.

Instruments

The validated tools below have been used in Arabic, English, and 

French (see Supplementary Material Table S1).

The World Health Organization Quality of 
Life—BREF

The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-
BREF comprises 26 items assessing the QOL in four domains: physical 
health (7 items); psychological health (6 items); social relationships (3 
items); and environmental health (8 items). Each item was rated on a 
five-point Likert-scale, ranging from “1” (not at all/very dissatisfied) 
to “5” (completely/extremely/very satisfied). These ratings were then 
linearly converted to a scale of 0 to 100 for analysis and interpretation 
(2, 19, 20).

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses seven key 
areas related to sleep patterns, including self-reported bedtimes and 
wake-up times, total sleep duration, time in bed, sleep efficiency, and 
sleep-onset  latency  and  daytime  dysfunction  over  the  month 
preceding the assessment. The global PSQI score ranges from 0 to 21, 

where lower scores indicate better sleep quality, while higher scores of 
≥5  or ≥8  indicate  poor  sleep  quality,  or  very  poor  sleep  quality, 
respectively (21–23).

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale

The  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale  (ESS)  assesses  excessive 
sleepiness due to sleep debt or clinical sleep disorders. This eight-
item scale assesses how sleepy one has felt; participants indicate the 
likelihood that they would fall asleep while doing everyday-like 
activities (e.g., watching TV, sitting and talking to someone, or 
stopping at a traffic light), with responses from “0” (would never 
doze)  to  “3”  (high  chance  of  dozing).  The  ESS  scores  were 
interpreted  as  follows:  scores  (i)  0  to  5  indicate  lower  normal 
daytime sleepiness; (ii) 6 to 10: higher normal daytime sleepiness; 
(iii)  11  to  12:  mild  excessive  daytime  sleepiness;  (iv)  13  to  15: 
moderate excessive daytime sleepiness, and (v) 16 to 24: severe 
excessive daytime (24–26).

The Insomnia Severity Index

The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) evaluates insomnia in adults, 
capturing information of the preceding month. Each item (e.g., falling 
asleep, staying asleep, early awakening,) in the test is measured using 
a  5-point  Likert  scale.  Scores  (i)  ranging  from  0  to  7  indicate  the 
absence of clinically significant insomnia; (ii) 8 to 14: subthreshold 
insomnia; (iii) 15 to 21: moderately serious clinical insomnia, and (iv) 
22 to 28: severe clinical (27–29).

The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 
21

The  Depression,  Anxiety,  and  Stress  Scale  21  (DASS)  is  a 
quantitative assessment tool designed to measure distress across three 
dimensions:  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress.  Most  versions  of  the 
DASS-21 follow comparable scoring criteria, prompting individuals 
to assess the frequency of symptoms experienced in the preceding 
week using a 4-point scale, ranging from “0” (not applicable to me at 
all) to “3” (highly applicable to me or most of the time). The total score 
correspond to the sum of the three sub-scores: stress, anxiety, and 
depression (30–32).

Short-version of the International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was 
employed to evaluate the physical activity levels of participants. This 
is  the  short  form  IPAQ-SF,  which  consists  of  7  items.  It  includes 
questions on physical activities associated with work, transportation, 
housework, and leisure activities “during the past seven days.” The 
Metabolic  Equivalent  of  the  Task  (METs)-min  was  calculated  by 
multiplying the duration of activity in minutes by the coefficient of 
the activity level (e.g., 1.3 for sitting, 3.3 for walking, 4 for moderate, 
and 8 for vigorous activities) (33, 34).

Statistical analysis

The  collected  data  were  analyzed  using  Structural  Equation 
Modeling (SEM), to assess the relationship between QOL and other 
variables based upon maximum likelihood estimation method within 
STATA  version  SE  18  (35).  The  SEM  is  a  multivariate  statistical 
analysis  technique  used  to  analyze  structural  relationships.  This 
technique is the combination of factor analysis and multiple regression 
analysis and is used to analyze the structural relationship between 
measured variables and latent constructs, enabling the estimation of 
multiple and interrelated dependencies in a single analysis. In this type 
of  analysis,  two  categories  of  variables  are  utilized:  endogenous 
(dependent: QOL with four domains) and exogenous (independent: 
PSQI, ISI, anxiety, physical activity, and stress) variables.

The main outcomes of the SEM analysis are β (the sum of direct 
and  indirect  effect)  and  Z  which  is  the  standard  score  (measures 
exactly how many standard deviations above or below the mean a 
data point).

Results

Model 1: physical health domain of QOL

The SEM analysis revealed significant relationships of sleep quality 
(PSQI), ISI, and depression on the physical health domain of QOL. Sleep 
quality (β = 0.21; z = 10.95; p < 0.001) and insomnia severity (β = 0.35; 
z = 19.19, p < 0.001) were two main predictors of depression score. DASS 
score was the strongest standardized predictor of the physical health QOL 
(β = −0.31; z = −20.11; p < 0.001) followed by sleep quality (β = −0.22; 
z = −12.05; p < 0.001) and insomnia (β = −0.19; z = −10.08; p < 0.001). The 
reported R2 for the outcome variable was 35.5%. Further upon model 
diagnosis  we  discovered  that  root  mean  square  error  was  <0.05  and 
comparative fit index (CFI) was greater than 0.90. Next, we examined the 
direct and indirect effects of each predictor. In addition to the direct 
effects  of  PSQI  on  QOL,  there  was  an  indirect  standardized  effect 
(β = −0.07; z = −9.42; p < 0.001) accounting for 23.1% of the total effect. 
However, insomnia had a higher indirect effect on QOL physical health 
(β = −11;  z = −13.31;  p  < 0.001)  that  accounted  for  36.9%  of  the  total 
observed  effect  (Table  2).  Figure  1  presents  the  SEM  analysis  of 
independent  variables  (PSQI,  ISI,  and  depression)  on  the  dependent 
variable (QOL physical health).

p  = 0.17).  For  Depression,  the  R2  value  was  0.675,  indicating  that 
approximately 67.5% of the variance in the observed depression scores 
can be explained by the fitted model. Depression exhibited a substantial 
negative impact (β = −0.60; z = −23.94; p < 0.001) on the psychological 
QOL. The PSQI showed a negative impact on the psychological QOL 
(β = −0.13; z = −7.09; p < 0.001). PA demonstrated a positive relationship 
(β = 0.05; z = 3.19; p = 0.001) on the psychological QOL. R2 value (0.316) 
indicates a moderate level of explanatory ability (Figure 2).

There was a strong indirect influence of stress on the psychological 
QOL (β = −0.33; z = −18.31; p < 0.001). However, when considering a 
mediating variable, the overall relationship between stress and the 
psychological QOL becomes negative. This suggests that the mediating 
variable associated with stress has a counteracting effect, potentially 
mitigating the positive impact observed in the direct relationship.

There was an indirect influence of anxiety on the psychological QOL 
(β = −0.19; z = −14.26; p < 0.001). Similarly, to stress, when considering a 
mediating  variable,  the  overall  relationship  between  anxiety  and  the 
psychological QOL became negative. This indicates that the mediating 
variable associated with anxiety may attenuate the positive direct effect.

The positive indirect effect (β = 0.01; z = 2.04; p = 0.042) suggests a 
minor indirect influence of physical activity on the psychological QOL 
which represented only 16.7% of the total observed effect (Table 3).

Model 3: social relationship domain of QOL

Both  depression  (β = −0.408;  z = −15.79;  p  < 0.001)  and  PSQI 
(β = −0.133;  z = −7.40;  p  < 0.001)  exhibited  negative  impacts, 
indicating  that  increases  in  either  depression  or  PSQI  scores 
correspond  to  considerable  reductions  in  social  relationships 
QOL.  Conversely,  stress  demonstrated  a  positive  effect  (β = 0.113; 
z = 4.09; p < 0.001), signifying that heightened stress levels were related 
with increased social relationships QOL.

Moreover, the variance explained (R2 values), shows that depression 
accounted for 64.5% of the variance in social relationships QOL, while 
stress and PSQI contributed to 22.3% and 15.6%, respectively. This 
suggests that among the studied variables, depression has the strongest 
explanatory power in predicting social relationships QOL.

The  association  between  stress  and  depression  was  strong 
(β = 0.764; z = 88.10; p < 0.001), underlining the substantial influence 
exerted by stress on depression. Additionally, PSQI had a direct and 
robust impact on stress (β = 0.473; z = 37.40; p < 0.001), indicating its 
considerable influence on stress levels (Figure 3; Table 4).

Model 2: psychological health domain of 
QOL

Model 4: environmental domain of QOL

The predictors for depression were stress (β = 0.55; z = 34.83; p < 0.001) 
and anxiety (β = 0.32; z = 19.04; p < 0.001). However, the variable physical 
activity did not show any significant relationship (β = −0.01, z = −1.36, 

Depression demonstrated a substantial negative impact (β = −0.26; 
z = −10.21; p < 0.001) on the environmental QOL, indicating that for 
every one-unit increase in depression, QOL (environmental domain)

negatively  affected  by  stress,  anxiety  and  poor  sleep;  (iii)  social 
relationships  QOL  was  strongly  and  negatively  associated  with 
depression,  and  poor  sleep;  and  (iv)  environmental  QOL  was 
positively impacted by physical activity and negatively affected by 
depression, and anxiety.

Physical health QOL

There are direct and indirect effects of sleep quality, insomnia 
and depression on the physical health QOL in college students. 
This aligns with previous studies that were conducted among the 
general population. Overall sleep quality was indirectly connected 
to physical and mental health domains of QOL through symptoms 
of insomnia in college students (36, 37). Moreover, lower sleep 
quality was associated with negative mood, lower self-esteem and 
satisfaction  with  physical  well-being  and  higher  daytime 
sleepiness (36, 37). It is noteworthy to mention that sleep quality 
had the stronger impact on mood and physical well-being than 
sleep  duration  (37).  Although  not  investigated  in  our  study,  a 
better  physical  health  QOL  was  associated  to  better  diet  and 
healthier body weight (38). Contrarily to earlier reports, we did 
not observe any association between the level of PA and physical 
health QOL (38).

Regular  PA,  even  at  low-to-moderate  intensities,  seem  to 
be helpful in reducing depression symptoms and perceived stress (4). 
The detrimental effects of poor physical health and sleep quality may 
be  reflected  in  the  psychological  and  social  adaptation  challenges 
experienced by university students (39).

symptoms, including sleep problems, stress, anxiety, depression, 
burnout, internet addiction, substance use, eating disorders, and 
suicidal  thoughts.  These  problems,  which  seems  arising  from 
academic-related stressors, can have severe consequences such as 
poor academic performance, increased thoughts of dropping out 
of  medical  schools,  and  decreased  professionalism  (44).  In  a 
similar  study,  Marques  et  al.  (45)  explored  the  association 
between sleep quality and QOL in healthy young adults, showing 
that sleep quality is a significant predictor of QOL in all domains, 
with the exception of social relationships. Similarly, an earlier 
research  showed  that  poor  sleep  quality  was  associated  with 
reduced physical and psychological well-being (46). Although not 
investigated  in  our  study,  factors  such  as  living  alone  (38)  or 
living with guardians (47) and high caffeine intake (47) contribute 
to poor sleep quality and lower psychological health domain of 
QOL  among  undergraduate  students.  Taken  together,  sleep 
quality is a strong predictor of QOL, and sleep hygiene education 
might contribute to better sleep quality which may, to a certain 
degree, enhance the physical and psychological domains of QOL 
in college students.

We  showed  that  PA  directly  and  indirectly  enhanced  the 
psychological domain of QOL (through enhancing sleep quality). 
In  this  regard,  the  advantage  of  regularly  practicing  PA  could 
be multifaceted. PA could contribute to maintaining a healthy 
body weight and increasing self-esteem (38), enhancing cardiac 
activity and emotion processing (4), reducing stress and anxiety 
(17),  favoring  good  sleep  quality  and  improving  physical  and 
mental  health  (17).  Therefore,  practicing  PA  will  enhance  the 
QOL of college students, which has also been reported by other 
studies (4, 17, 38, 48).

Psychological health QOL

We showed that stress and anxiety scores directly and indirectly 
influenced  psychological  health  domain  of  QOL  (through  higher 
depression scores). This finding aligns with earlier reports showing an 
association  between  lower  mental  health  and  lower  psychological 
QOL (7, 40, 41). Several studies used mindfulness therapy to reduce 
negative feelings (i.e., anxiety, despair, and perceived stress) in college 
students reporting positive results (39, 42, 43). Several studies have 
shown  that  mindfulness  therapy  could  be  used  to  enhance  life 
satisfaction, positive affect, gratitude, self-compassion (39, 42, 43). 
Moreover, lower sleep quality contributed to the lower psychological 
health QOL, confirming earlier reports showing a negative association 
between sleep quality and psychological health QOL (8).

In a recent umbrella review, Jahrami et al. (44) investigated 
the prevalence of psychological and behavioral symptoms among 
medical students. The authors found a substantial prevalence of 

Social relationships QOL

We found strong correlations between sleep quality, depression, 
stress, and the social relationships’ domain of QOL. Our findings align 
with those of Kent et al. (49) reporting a strong correlation between 
various  social  ties  and  sleep  quality,  with  depression  mediating  the 
relationship between social support and the sleep quality of older college 
students (50). Indeed, social relationships are important for improving 
both physical and mental health, which also reduces stress levels (51). In 
this context, personal control closely links with social ties, plays a crucial 
role for positive health habits, mental, and physical health. Alsubaie et al. 
(52) investigated the impact of social support on the mental health and 
wellbeing  of  university  students.  They  showed  a  strong  correlation 
between higher social support from friends and family with (i) lower 
depression  symptoms  and  (ii)  higher  psychological  and  social 
relationships QOL domains. Furthermore, they also observed that a

deficiency of social support contributes to mental health issues. These 
findings indicate that lower levels of depression result in higher QOL 
within the psychological and social relationship domains. Our results 
differ from the literature as we observed a relatively low, but significant 
positive relationship between stress and social relationship’ QOL. Our 
study  design  does  not  allow  assessing  the  reasons  between  the 
discrepancy of this result with the above-mentioned references, however, 
we speculate that this might be because the students constituting our 
study population might have ensured social engagement time at the 
expenses of their study’ time, resulting in a certain amount of stress. This 
deserves to be investigated by future studies.

Environmental QOL

We noted that the impacts of depression and anxiety levels on 
environmental  QOL  exceeded  those  of  sleep  quality  and  physical 
activity. Indeed, environmental QOL is an important element affecting 
life expectancy and mental health (49, 50). This could be attributed to 
the  fact  that  long-term  exposure  to  a  polluted  environment  can 
negatively impact individuals’ cognitive abilities and induce depression 
(53).  Chang  et  al.  (48)  showed  that  access  to  green  space  induces 
higher physical QOL and increased levels of physical activity. Their 
study  emphasized  the  significance  of  individual  health  behaviors, 
environmental factors, as well as perceived stress and sleep quality in 
influencing  various  domains  of  QOL.  They  also  unveiled  that 
satisfaction with public spaces exhibited a positive correlation with all 
domains of QOL. Furthermore, Chang et al. (48) have shown that the 
negative association of environmental quality with QOL, is mediated 
by  perceived  stress  and  poor  sleep.  These  findings  imply  that 
interventions aiming at addressing these factors could potentially lead 
to enhancements in QOL.

Strengths and limitations

Our study included a large international sample (n > 3,300) of 
college/university students from ~50 countries allowing to draw 
robust conclusions and the generalization of the outcome for the 
main results. Further, the study was conducted by an international 
network of university teachers working closely with students which 
favors a greater understanding of the academic-life challenge and 
the communication of the results to the targeted population. Within 
our study limitations, the use of a cross-sectional research design 
based on a survey cannot allow establishing causality and relies on 
subjective reporting that is subject to potential social desirability 
bias. Furthermore, our sample’s sex and continental allotment does 
not  represent  the  world  actual  population  distribution.  The 
overrepresentation  of  women  and  both  Africa  and  Europe 
continents,  should  be  considered  when  interpreting  our  results. 
Additionally,  the  survey  was  conducted  in  three  languages  only 
(Arabic,  English,  French),  and  participation  was  limited  to 
individuals who understand these languages, which may further 
influence  the  generalizability  of  our  findings.  Future  research 
should  consider  using  an  experimental  or  longitudinal  research 
design  to  examine  the  associations  between  sleep  quality, 
psychological factors and QOL.

Practical implication and 
recommendations

Several  researchers  suggest  that  efforts  to  improve  the 
duration, efficiency, and overall sleep habits could have positive 
consequences on individuals’ well-being (54, 55). They suggest 
that sleep hygiene principles should not only be directed toward 
those  suffering  from  sleep-related  disorders  but  should  also 
be extended to healthy young adults and students. Establishing a 
regular bedtime and wake-up routine can greatly enhance general 
well-being and productivity. Consistently following these sleep 
hygiene principles could improve sleep quality, increase energy 
levels, and enhance overall well-being (54). Our study showed 
that  students  might  exhibit  sleep  problems,  anxiety,  and 
depression symptoms, highlighting the importance of promoting 
and supporting physical activity among university students to 
potentially improve various aspects of their QOL. Improving the 
QOL  for  university  students  requires  a  multifaceted  approach 
that addresses sleep quality, mental health, and physical activity 
while promoting supportive environmental and social conditions. 
Such comprehensive strategies are vital for enhancing students’ 
overall  well-being  and  academic  performance,  ultimately 
contributing to their success and satisfaction in their academic 
and personal lives.

Conclusion

students.  Our 

We elucidated the interrelations among sleep quality, mental 
health,  and  physical  activity  on  different  domains  of  QOL  in 
college 
that 
innovative 
environmental QOL was associated with both sleep quality and 
physical activity. The association between sleep quality and both 
physical  and  mental  QOL  implies  a  potential  influence  on 
subsequent  health-related  outcomes.  Depression,  stress  and 
anxiety  strongly  affect  the  psychological  health  QOL.  These 
findings emphasize the advantage of early identification of sleep 
and mental health problems in college students and to implement 
the  appropriate  preventive  strategies.  This,  will  inform  the 
development of effective strategies to promote overall well-being 
in this population, hopefully improving their overall QOL and 
academic performance.
