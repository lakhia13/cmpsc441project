- Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, involves symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder like mania, which may also include depressive episodes.

- Diagnosis requires identifying major manic symptoms with psychotic symptoms, ensuring psychotic symptoms last for at least two weeks even when mood symptoms are managed, and confirming a mood disorder is present for most of the illness.

- Effective management typically includes a combination of medications, such as antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, along with psychotherapy to help improve problem-solving, relationships, and overall quality of life.


## What is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type?


Schizoaffective disorderis a rarer type of mental illness. It’s characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia and symptoms of a mood disorder. This includesmaniaordepression.

The two types of schizoaffective disorder are bipolar and depressive.

Episodes of mania occur in the bipolar type. During a manic episode, you may alternate between feeling overly excited to feeling extremely irritable. You may or may not experiencedepressive episodes.

People who have the depressive type experience episodes of depression.

According to National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), schizoaffective disorder affects0.3 percentof people in the United States. It affects men and women equally, and men may develop the disorder earlier in life.

With proper treatment and care, this disorder can be effectively managed. Read on to learn more.


## What are the symptoms?


Your symptoms will depend on the mood disorder. They can vary from mild to severe and may also vary depending on the person experiencing them.

Manic symptoms are like those seen inbipolar disorder. A person withmanic symptomsmay appear hyperactive or overly restless, talk very fast, and sleep very little.

Doctors may refer to your symptoms as positive or negative, but this doesn’t mean “good” or “bad.”

Psychotic symptoms are similar to those ofschizophrenia. This may include positive symptoms, like:

- disorganized speech

- disorganized behavior

Negative symptoms can occur when something seems to be missing, like the ability to experience pleasure or the ability to think clearly or concentrate.


## What causes schizoaffective disorder?


It isn’t clear what causes schizoaffective disorder. The disorder typically runs in families, so genetics may play a role. You aren’t guaranteed to develop the disorder if a family member has it, but you do have an increased risk.

Birth complications or exposure to toxins or viruses before birth may also contribute to the development of this disorder. People may also develop schizoaffective disorder as a result of certain chemical changes in the brain.


## How is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type diagnosed?


It can be difficult to diagnose schizoaffective disorder because it has many of the same symptoms as other conditions. These symptoms can appear at different times. They can also appear in different combinations.

When diagnosing this type of schizoaffective disorder, doctors will look for:

- major manic symptoms that occur along withpsychotic symptoms

- psychotic symptoms that last at least 2 weeks, even when the mood symptoms are under control

- a mood disorder that’s present for most of the course of the illness

Blood or laboratory tests can’t help your doctor diagnose schizoaffective disorder. Your doctor may do certain tests to rule out other diseases or conditions that can cause some of the same symptoms. This includes substance misuse or epilepsy.


## How is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type treated?


People with the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder usually respond well to a combination of medications. Psychotherapy or counseling may also help to improve quality of life.

Medications can help relieve the psychotic symptoms and stabilize changes in mood.

Antipsychotics control the schizophrenia-like symptoms. This includes hallucinations and delusions. Paliperidone (Invega) is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for schizoaffective disorder. But doctors can still use medicationsoff-labelto treat these symptoms.

Similar drugs include:

- risperidone(Risperdal)

- olanzapine(Zyprexa)


### Mood stabilizers


Mood stabilizers likelithiumcan level out the highs and lows of bipolar symptoms.

You may need to take the mood stabilizers for several weeks or so before they become effective. Antipsychotics work much quicker to control symptoms. So, it isn’t uncommon to use mood stabilizers and antipsychotics together.

Certain drugs fortreating seizurescan also treat these symptoms. This includescarbamazepineand valproate.

Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, can help people with schizoaffective disorder to:

- form relationships

- learn new behaviors

- learn new skills

Talk therapy can generally help you manage your life and your thoughts.

You can get one-on-one therapy with a psychologist, counselor, or another therapist, or you can go to group therapy. Group support can reinforce new skills and allow you to connect with other people who share your concerns.
