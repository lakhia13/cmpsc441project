Abstract
There has been increasing scientific and clinical interest in studying psychedelic and meditation-based interventions in 
recent years, both in the context of improving mental health and as tools for understanding the mind. Several authors suggest 
neurophysiological and phenomenological parallels and overlaps between psychedelic and meditative states and suggest 
synergistic effects of both methods. Both psychedelic-assisted therapy and meditation training in the form of mindfulness-
based interventions have been experimentally validated with moderate to large effects as alternative treatments for a variety 
of mental health problems, including depression, addictions, and anxiety disorders. Both demonstrated significant post-acute 
and long-term decreases in clinical symptoms and enhancements in well-being in healthy participants, in addition. Postulated 
shared salutogenic mechanisms, include, among others the ability to alter self-consciousness, present-moment awareness and 
antidepressant action via corresponding neuromodulatory effects. These shared mechanisms between mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention have led to scientists theorizing, and recently demonstrating, positive synergistic effects when 
both are used in combination. Research findings suggest that these two approaches can complement each other, enhancing the 
positive effects of both interventions. However, more theoretical accounts and methodologically sound research are needed 
before they can be extended into clinical practice. The current review aims to discuss the theoretical rationale of combining 
psychedelics with mindfulness training, including the predictive coding framework as well as research findings regarding 
synergies and commonalities between mindfulness training and psychedelic intervention. In addition, suggestions how to 
combine the two modalities are provided.

Introduction

Mindfulness practice and psychedelic therapy have gained 
increasing attention in the last decade for their potential 
synergistic effects in promoting mental well-being and per-
sonal growth [1]. This overlap in desired outcomes suggests 
a potential complementarity, such as reducing the tendency 
for rumination via decreasing activation of the default mode

network [2, 3] in the treatment of depression and anxiety 
disorders [4, 5].

Several studies [6, 7] and expert opinions [8] suggest that 
combining these two approaches may enhance therapeutic 
outcomes. Some experts argue that mindfulness meditation 
(MM) can complement psychedelics effectively, i.e., by 
helping individuals to develop a heightened sense of self-
awareness and emotional regulation, which can be particu-
larly useful during a psychedelic experience [9]. Experts also 
suggest that vice versa, psychedelics can create a favorable 
mental context for meditation, which is particularly impor-
tant at the beginning of meditative practice marked by high 
obstructions to engage [8]. In simpler terms, psychedelics 
have a remarkable ability to temporarily lead individuals 
toward significant and often abrupt changes in their thinking

patterns, values, attitudes, and behaviors, ultimately promot-
ing more adaptive and positive qualities [10].

The combination of psychedelics and mindfulness can 
also be seen historically. During 1960s, when psychedelics 
gained popularity, they were often associated with practices 
like meditation and mysticism, reflecting an early recogni-
tion of their synergistic potential [11].

Although MM and psychedelics are distinct approaches, 
both share numerous parallel phenomenological, psycho-
logical, and neurobiological effects. The current review aims 
to provide a summary of these complimenting and synergis-
tic mechanisms and to suggest methods for integrating both 
approaches to enhance their positive effects.

Mindfulness meditation 
and mindfulness‑based interventions

Mindfulness, rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions, has 
gained significant recognition in Western psychology and 
healthcare in the recent 2 decades. Mindfulness meditation 
usually involves directing one's attention to the breath, bod-
ily sensations, thoughts, and emotions, promoting a sense 
of presence. One of the most popular definitions describes 
mindfulness as the awareness that emerges when deliberately 
and nonjudgmentally paying attention to the present moment 
experience [12]. Originally developed within Buddhist and 
other wisdom traditions to alleviate mental suffering and 
gain  insights,  mindfulness  has  been  integrated  into  the 
Western mainstream of medicine under the umbrella term 
mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Among MBIs, 
there are two main mindfulness training: mindfulness-based 
stress reduction (MBSR) developed by the pioneer of mind-
fulness John Kabat-Zinn in 1978, and mindfulness-based 
cognitive therapy (MBCT) which has gained more empiri-
cal evidence of effectiveness in mental disorders. MBIs 
encompass structured programs that incorporate mindful-
ness practices within various contexts including clinical set-
tings, education, and workplace wellness programs. Studies 
show that MBIs can enhance emotional regulation, atten-
tional control, and self-awareness [13], inferring positive 
effects on well-being, alleviation of anxiety, depression, and 
stress symptoms [14]. The benefits of MM extend beyond 
psychological well-being, however. Mindfulness meditation 
has been associated with improved physical health outcomes 
and pain management [14].

Mindfulness-based interventions have also shown prom-
ise in behavior change and addiction treatment [15]. They 
help develop a greater awareness of addiction triggers and 
automatic reactions, enabling practitioners to respond more 
skillfully to challenging situations [15]. Beyond that, this 
broader awareness can lead to healthier choices and reduced 
impulsivity.

While mindfulness practices offer numerous advantages, 
their effective implementation requires appropriate training 
and guidance. Skilled instructors play a crucial role in guid-
ing participants through the practices and addressing any 
challenges that may arise. Additionally, research highlights 
the importance of regular practice for sustained benefits 
[16]. These potential shortcomings of MM provide room 
for complementation from psychedelics.

Notably, in recent decades, the rapid advancement of 
information technology has led to a surge in the utiliza-
tion of internet-based psychological interventions (IPIs) 
for addressing emotional challenges [17]. Internet-based 
Mindfulness-Based Interventions (iMBIs) have also been 
created, including iMBCT [18, 19]. Several meta-analyses 
of iMBI studies demonstrated that iMBIs, much like tradi-
tional MBI, effectively reduce stress and alleviate emotional 
distress, including depressive and anxiety symptoms [20, 
21]. This evidence is further corroborated by a meta-analy-
sis of iMBI interventions specifically aimed at individuals 
diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders [22, 23]. 
Similarly to face-to-face MBIs, studies showed that iMBCT 
infers its positive effects on psychopathological symptoms 
through the increase in cognitive defusion and self-compas-
sion abilities [24, 25]. Mindfulness meditation has become 
increasingly accessible through modern technology, specifi-
cally mindfulness apps. These apps offer guided meditation, 
breathing exercises, and tools to promote self-awareness and 
stress reduction. Research has shown that mindfulness apps 
not only have gained increasing popularity, but also can be 
efficient in improving psychological well-being, reducing 
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and emotional distress 
[26, 27]. Given the limited quantity of studies included in 
those meta-analyses, their methodological weaknesses, and 
the absence of randomized controlled trials, it is advisable 
to exercise caution when interpreting the effects of mindful-
ness apps. Future studies should also assess their utility and 
effectiveness in combination with psychedelic interventions.

Psychedelics and psychedelic interventions

Psychedelics as a class of psychoactive substances, which 
induce intense and transformative experiences that might 
provide rapid insights, potentially accelerating some of the 
benefits derived from mindfulness practices [28]. Psych-
edelics themselves induce altered states of consciousness, 
characterized by profound perceptual, cognitive, and emo-
tional experiences [3]. The term, however, is frequently uti-
lized in a sweeping manner to encompass diverse categories 
of hallucinogens related to psychedelics. To prevent any 
potential numerical errors, the term "classic psychedelics'' 
is used, referring to the category of substances that bind 
to serotonin receptors in the brain, with 5HT2A receptor 

1 31400

selectivity [29]. This group includes mescaline, Lysergic 
Acid Diethylamide (LSD), and naturally occurring alkaloids, 
such as 4-phosphoriloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (psilocy-
bin, present in hundreds of Psilocybe mushroom species), 
ayahuasca, and DMT, among others [30]. Additionally, there 
are other types of psychedelics, such as 2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-
2-(methylamino) ketamine and 3,4-MethylenedioxyMetham-
phetamine (MDMA). Ketamine is a dissociative psychedelic, 
which acts as NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) 
antagonists, effectively engaging the glutamatergic system 
[31]. MDMA is known as “empathogenic psychedelics”, 
or “entactogen”, acting primarily by increasing the release 
of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and inhibiting 
their reuptake [32]. As previously noted, mindfulness prac-
tices facilitate behavioral change by enabling individuals 
to identify triggers and habitual responses, whereas psy-
chedelic therapy can amplify this awareness, resulting in 
even deeper behavioral transformations [33]. Furthermore, 
while the effects of psychedelics are not permanent, they can 
produce long-lasting changes from even a single session, 
potentially complementing the regular practice required by 
mindfulness [7].

The potential therapeutic applications of psychedelics, 
often referred to as psychedelic interventions or psyche-
delic-assisted therapy (PAT), have opened new avenues for 
addressing mental health conditions. Classic psychedelics, 
such as synthetic LSD and psilocybin, which is found in cer-
tain mushrooms, have shown promise as aids in psychother-
apy e.g., for mood disorders and substance dependence [1, 
5, 33]. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy involves guided 
sessions where individuals receive a controlled dose of a 
psychedelic under the supervision of trained therapists. This 
approach aims to enhance emotional processing, encourage 
introspection, and facilitate breakthroughs in therapy [34].

Altered states of consciousness

Meditation and psychedelics have garnered significant atten-
tion in recent years, both in the context of altered states of 
consciousness  and  as  tools  for  understanding  the  mind. 
Both psychedelic and meditation, are historically and con-
temporarily considered as methods of alternating states of 
consciousness. Consciousness, in general, includes a wide 
variety  of  experiences,  ranging  from  simple  perceptual 
awareness to introspective thought [35]. One may argue it 
creates our inner "self", which is at the center of what shapes 
our uniqueness [36]. Although this assumption might sug-
gest that our self of identity is permanent and solid, such 
a claim is questioned by altered states of consciousness in 
which the disruption of “self” are observed [36, [37], such as 
in conditions like temporal lobe epilepsy auras [38] or spir-
itual or mystical experiences [39]. The latter can be induced 

by various means, including but not limited to [40] psych-
edelics or meditation [36, 37].

Such phenomena, often termed "self-loss" or "ego dis-
solution", manifest as a blurring or complete disappearance 
of the sense of self, promoting a sense of oneness with the 
world or surroundings [41]. Consequently, in this state, indi-
viduals may more readily engage with their cognitive beliefs 
and emotional states with enhanced detachment and decen-
tration, potentially leading to therapeutic outcomes [42, 43]. 
One of the explanations for these salutogenic effects is that 
the 'ego-dissolution' phenomenon is related to the deactiva-
tion of the groups of interconnected brain regions called 
Default Mode Networks (DMN) [2]. This region includes the 
following regions: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ante-
rior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), 
cuneus/precuneus, and temporoparietal junction/angular 
gyrus (some also list hippocampus, parahippocampal gyri, 
and frontopolar cortex as regions “loosely integrated”) [44]. 
DMN serves as the neurophysiological basis for the 'self' or 
'ego' because of its activation when individuals engage in 
self-referential thought [45]. It has been demonstrated with 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that dur-
ing psychedelic experience, the DMN is modulated, which 
sharply reduces blood flow and connection within its nodes 
[46], leading to decreased functional connectivity within 
the DMN and increased between-network connectivity [47, 
48]. These alterations are believed to foster a cognitive land-
scape that's more malleable, less restrained by traditional 
boundaries, and exhibits decreased ego-centered thinking 
[49, 50]. Similarly, mindfulness meditation has been asso-
ciated with decreased activity in the DMN during periods 
of focused attention [2]. Moreover, long-term meditators 
display reduced DMN activity even during resting states, 
suggesting a lasting effect of meditation on self-referential 
thought and DMN connectivity [51].

Mystical experiences in mindfulness training 
and psychedelics

Mystical  experiences,  often  referred  to  as  transcendent 
encounters  or  spiritual  revelations,  are  deeply  profound 
moments that transcend ordinary consciousness. These expe-
riences are reported across cultures, religions, and historical 
periods, often accompanied by a sense of unity, awe, and a 
connection to the divine. They often involve altered states 
of consciousness and are described as moments of height-
ened awareness that defy ordinary sensory perception. While 
these experiences are deeply personal and subjective, they 
often result in a profound transformation in the individual's 
perspective and worldview [4]. Mystical experiences can be 
triggered by various means, including meditation, prayer, 
and religious rituals or even spontaneous occurrences. These 

1 3

1401

experiences, however, most often are induced by mindful-
ness meditation and the use of psychedelics. While both 
methods share certain commonalities in producing mystical 
encounters, they also exhibit notable differences.

Studies [52] suggest that MM and psychedelics share 
a history of consciousness alteration, although mindful-
ness often evolves through gradual, focused practice, while 
psychedelics induce altered states more rapidly. Moreover, 
psychedelic-induced experiences are often characterized 
by their vivid and elaborate sensory content, a quality that 
is typically lacking in meditative states. Psychedelics can 
evoke intense sensory perceptions, including visual halluci-
nations, enhanced color perception, and heightened auditory 
sensations. This phenomenon is in stark contrast to medi-
tative states, which tend to involve a reduction in sensory 
awareness and a shift toward inner contemplation and mental 
stillness. Meditation often seeks to transcend sensory input 
and achieve a state of heightened awareness devoid of exter-
nal distractions.

Research [53] indicates that classic hallucinogens can 
evoke profound states of unity, described as experiences of 
interconnectedness and oneness with all phenomena, akin to 
deep meditative states. Such states of unity involve ego dis-
solution, which refers to a fading or elimination of the indi-
vidual's normal sense of self, blurring the habitual bounda-
ries between self and other and fostering an encompassing 
feeling of wholeness and integration with the surrounding 
environment [67]. However, psychedelics' effects are largely 
dose-dependent and can vary among individuals, leading 
to potentially unpredictable outcomes. Mindfulness train-
ing, on the other hand, offers a controlled and self-guided 
approach to achieving similar states of consciousness.

Studies showed that similarly to MM, acute effects of 
psychedelics include non-dual experiences [54] and elevated 
interpersonal connectedness [55]. Moreover, psychedelics 
have been found to increase trait mindfulness, and the skills 
of nonjudgement, compassion and non-reactivity [56, 57].
Differences emerge in the mechanisms and sustainabil-
ity of these experiences. Mindfulness relies on self-regula-
tion and introspection, gradually cultivating altered states 
through dedicated practice. Psychedelics, on the other hand, 
offer a shortcut to such states, but their effects can be tempo-
rary and influenced by external factors [29, [58].

However, the challenge of maintaining a mindfulness 
practice over an extended period can often lead to decreased 
motivation and high dropout rates [59]. Psychedelics, by 
temporarily inducing peak experiences and afterglow states 
that resemble the deep meditative states, may serve as a 
motivating factor for individuals to sustain their mindful-
ness practice over time. Research showed that sustaining 
mindfulness practice is essential for achieving and maintain-
ing health benefits and that mindfulness training effects are 
dose-dependent, at least for the first 500 h [60].

Neurobiology of psychedelics 
and mindfulness meditation

Classic psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and 
DMT primarily act as agonists to the serotonin 5-HT2A 
receptor, and considering the extensive range targeted by 
the serotonergic system, they have a significant effect on 
the brain's neurochemistry [61]. The high presence of the 
5-HT2A receptor in regions like the prefrontal cortex—inte-
gral for higher-order cognitive functions—underscores the 
transformative nature of these compounds on cognition and 
perception [62, 63]. The other explanation of psychedelics' 
ability to facilitate altered states of consciousness character-
ized by heightened introspection and diminished ego bound-
aries is their influence on 5-HT1A [64] and 5-HT2B [65], 
and interacting with the dopaminergic [66] and glutamater-
gic systems [67]. Interestingly, the salience network, which 
determines which stimuli warrant our focus, has also been 
investigated as a neural correlate of self [68, 69]. Research 
indicates that psychedelics disrupt the functioning of the 
salience network, potentially leading to altered perceptions 
of self and world [70]. Such disruption is believed to be 
associated with the experience of ego dissolution [71]. Com-
plementing this, there's also a notable link between psych-
edelics and the induction of profound, mystical experiences 
(which are usually marked by ego dissolution), which are 
said to be characterized by heightened brain entropy [50]. 
Brain entropy in the realm of neuroscience serves as an indi-
cator of a system's uncertainty. The higher entropy means 
more complex, diverse, and unpredictable neural activity 
[50]. In the context of the brain, this denotes a blend of 
disorganization paving the way for a more diverse range of 
dynamic neural states [72].

Meditation, particularly mindfulness practices, has gar-
nered significant attention for its profound neurobiological 
effects as well. Similarly to the mechanism of default mode 
network  DMN  influenced  by  psychedelics,  mindfulness 
meditation decreases DMN activity which leads to changes 
in the precision-weighting of beliefs and attention [41]. MM 
was also found to reduce the activity of the midline prefron-
tal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, which are integral 
parts of the DMN, suggesting that mindfulness training can 
alter self-awareness pathways and promote present-moment 
consciousness  [73].  Beyond  these  neural  circuits,  MM 
encourages widespread neuroplastic changes. For example, 
comparative studies between meditators and non-meditators 
have revealed differences in brain connectivity, activation 
patterns, and both gray and white matter density [74]. In 
addition, the thalamus, a key region in sensory gating, is also 
involved in the meditative states [36, 41].

Acknowledging the aforementioned, MM and psych-
edelics  both  play  roles  in  dissolving  self-awareness, 

1 31402

fostering insight, and promoting personal growth and well-
being. Studies have identified overlapping brain connectiv-
ity patterns in meditative and psychedelic states, especially 
within resting-state networks, implying therapeutic prop-
erties. [2, 4, 6, [75].

In the next sections, we will outline the potential common-
alities, synergies and differences of Mindfulness Training and 
Psychedelic Interventions. The following list is not intended to 
be exhaustive, but it is meant to indicate possible ways through 
which mindfulness training can support psychedelic interven-
tions, as well as ways in which psychedelics can aid meditation 
practice.

Effects of mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention on prosociality

Mindfulness training and psychedelics have shown potential 
effects on prosociality. While research is still emerging, some 
studies suggest that both approaches may enhance empathy, 
compassion, and social connectedness [55, [76, 77] as well 
as increased self-compassion and prosocial attitudes [78, 
79]. Psychedelic intervention, especially in combination with 
mindfulness practices, has been proposed to facilitate positive 
changes in social attitudes and behaviors due to its impact on 
self-awareness and perspective shifts [80]. Despite these prom-
ising findings, it's crucial to note that the effects of psychedelic 
therapies on prosociality are complex and context-dependent.

Effects of mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention on decentering

Decentering—defined as the capacity to objectively observe 
one's immediate experience, altering its inherent nature—is 
a pivotal mechanism underpinning mindfulness meditation, 
namely mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) [81]. 
In general, both Mindfulness-Based Interventions and Psyche-
delic Interventions have been recognized for their potential to 
cultivate decentering [82]. Non-ordinary states of conscious-
ness induced by practices like mindfulness meditation and 
psychedelics have shown effects on different cognitive pro-
cesses, including decentering and similar phenomena of cogni-
tive defusion [91]. In addition, studies showed that ceremonial 
use of psychedelics (ayahuasca) is related to an increase in 
cognitive reappraisal which helps to look at and experience 
adverse life events with distance [83].

The effects of mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention on emotion 
regulation

Mindfulness training has shown promising impacts on 
emotion regulation [84,  85]. Studies suggest that MBIs 
can cause increased activation in the dorsolateral prefron-
tal cortex, a region associated with cognitive control of 
emotions, indicating improved emotion regulation [86]. 
While research on psychedelics' effects on emotion regu-
lation is limited, it indicates that psychedelic experiences 
influence emotional processing and self-awareness [87, 
88]. Psilocybin's effects might lead to a reevaluation of 
emotional experiences and enhanced emotional flexibil-
ity. Recent findings suggest that both approaches enhance 
affective self-regulation by influencing emotional reactiv-
ity and emotion regulation [89], however, their synergy in 
this respect warrants further research.

The effects of mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention 
on psychological flexibility

Mindfulness practices encourage individuals to respond 
to all kinds of experiences, whether positive or negative, 
without judgment and with openness which fosters psy-
chological flexibility [90]. This acceptance aligns with 
psychological  flexibility's  core  components,  enabling 
individuals to act by their values even in the presence of 
challenging emotions [79, [91]. Psychedelics, on the other 
hand, can lead to profound insights into personal values, 
and in this way enhance psychological flexibility [92].

Both methods encourage individuals to embrace uncer-
tainty and change, a fundamental aspect of psychologi-
cal flexibility. Psychological flexibility involves moving 
beyond limitations imposed by thoughts and emotions. 
Mindfulness training teaches individuals to observe their 
thoughts without attachment, reducing cognitive rigid-
ity. Psychedelics often induce experiences that challenge 
pre-existing beliefs, allowing individuals to transcend the 
constraining influence of self-concepts and through this 
way promote adaptability and open-mindedness [3, 38]. 
Both offer avenues to increased psychological flexibility 
by  fostering  acceptance,  values  alignment,  embracing 
uncertainty, and challenging ego boundaries. Integrating 
mindfulness skills and psychedelic insights holds prom-
ise for sustained psychological flexibility by facilitating 
a balanced response to internal and external stimuli, and 
adaptive responses to life's challenges [93].

The effects of mindfulness training 
and psychedelic intervention 
on psychopathology reduction

Both methods have shown potential for reducing psychopa-
thology and both, psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilo-
cybin and MBIs, in particular MBCT have preliminary 
evidence for effectiveness in chronic, treatment-resistant 
depression [94]. MBIs have demonstrated their efficacy in 
reducing psychopathological symptoms [14]. Psychedelic 
intervention, particularly with substances like psilocybin 
and ayahuasca, has also shown promise in complementing 
mindfulness practices to improve mental health outcomes 
[98]. Precise mechanisms underlying the psychopathol-
ogy reduction are complex and multifaceted, involving 
changes  in  neural  networks,  psychological  processes, 
and self-reported altered resting states [95]. The synergy 
between mindfulness and psychedelics has the potential to 
create a holistic approach to psychopathology reduction. 
While mindfulness encourages self-awareness and emo-
tional regulation, psychedelics can promote transformative 
experiences that lead to insights and shifts in perspective 
[8]. Both methods have shown potential for reducing psy-
chopathology through a variety of mechanisms, including 
those described in previous sections: decentering ability 
enhancement,  increasing  psychological  flexibility  and 
increasing emotion regulation. Additional mechanisms 
include but are not limited to:

Avoidance  reduction:  Both  MBCT  and  psychedelic 
intervention  have  been  associated  with  a  reduction  in 
avoidance behaviors [101].

Synergic effect on reduction of egocentricity. A com-
bination of MM and PAT increases empathy and reduces 
egocentricity, potentially aiding psychopathology reduc-
tion [7]. Moreover, this effect has been shown even for a 
single dose of psilocybin [7]. The process of decoupling 
within self-referential networks combined with the altera-
tion in one's sense of self induced by psilocybin during 
a meditation retreat, can serve as a predictive factor for 
lasting positive changes in psycho-social well-being [7]. 
This suggests that the experience of self-dissolution when 
integrated  with  mindfulness  practices,  may  contribute 
to sustained improvements in psychological and social 
functioning.

Neural plasticity and rewiring: Both approaches have 
shown the potential to induce neuroplastic changes in the 
brain.  Psilocybin  may  temporarily  enhance  neuroplas-
ticity through its influence on glutaminergic processes 
from the bottom up [96], and foster neural rewiring by 
promoting new synaptic connections, potentially break-
ing rigid thought patterns associated with psychopathol-
ogy [97]. On the contrary, mindfulness meditation can 

increase gray matter volume in regions associated with 
emotion regulation and self-awareness and predominantly 
relies  on  top-down  regulatory  mechanisms  and  gradu-
ally fosters plasticity as training progresses [73]. These 
two approaches could complement each other, with MM 
potentially extending the neuroplastic state triggered by 
psilocybin, and psilocybin potentially accelerating the rise 
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during MM 
training [see also 4]. This synergy may lead to enhanced 
neural plasticity and cognitive benefits.

Neuroendocrine  and  neuroimmunological  factors:  The 
weakening of stress responses has been indicated as a core 
mechanism through which MBIs exert their beneficial effects 
on both mental and physical health [14]. MBIs decrease sub-
jective psychological stress levels [18, [98] and helps people 
handle stress more effectively by making them less reactive 
to it and by improving the brain's ability to regulate stress-
related processes, through its effect on the hypothalamic–pitu-
itary–adrenal (HPA) axis, cortisol secretion [107, [99], and 
additionally reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, includ-
ing IL-6 [107, 109]. The neuroendocrine and neuroimmune 
systems are interconnected via hormone and cytokine signal-
ing [100], and MM and psilocybin act with different mecha-
nisms and possibly complementarily on these systems. While 
MBIs enhance HPA axis regulation leading to a decrease in 
cortisol level, psychedelics appear to mitigate inflammation 
through 5-HT2A agonism, leading to inhibiting the produc-
tion of IL-6 and consequently reducing the stimulation of the 
HPA axis [4]. Notably, psilocybin is associated with a pro-
nounced increase in cortisol levels [101]. This surge may be 
pivotal in facilitating the 'unlearning' of negative associations, 
prioritizing the formation of new memories over the retrieval 
of older ones [102]. The presence of 5-HT2A receptors in 
the prefrontal cortex has been correlated with stress response 
pathways [103] and, as such, a progressive down-regulation 
of these receptors due to psychedelics is thought to be essen-
tial for alleviating stress [104]. In the realm of neuroimmun-
ity, psilocybin is postulated to alter cellular signaling within 
the immune system, given the abundant presence of 5-HT2A 
receptors in immune cells [105]. Psilocybin modulates the 
immune response by suppressing inflammatory pathways 
through actions mediated by this 5-HT2A receptor [106], 117]. 
Preliminary research also suggests that certain psychedelics 
could curtail the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-6 [107], which might elucidate the enduring antidepressant 
effects observed with psilocybin [116].

Studies utilizing a combined methodology

A study done by Griffiths et al. [6] showed that a combina-
tion of psychedelics and meditation generates long-term 
improvements in psychological functioning as well as trait 

1 31404

measures of prosocial attitudes and behaviors [6]. In this 
study, groups of healthy participants were randomized into 
three groups, (1) low-dose psilocybin with standard sup-
port for spiritual practice (SS); (2) high-dose psilocybin 
with SS, and (3) high-dose psilocybin with High Support 
(HS) for spiritual practice. Importantly, the number of 
guide-participant meetings varied between the standard 
and high-support conditions. Between the study's accept-
ance and the 6-month follow-up, participants in the SS 
groups had a combined contact time with their guides that 
amounted to approximately 7 h and 20 min, whereas the 
HS group accumulated a total of 35 h of contact between 
the  guides  and  the  participants  from  the  acceptance 
of the study  to the 6-month follow-up. Psilocybin was 
administered 1 and 2 months following spiritual (mainly 
meditative) practice. The results showed, that high-dose 
psilocybin combined with HS spiritual practices led to 
more immediate and long-lasting effects at a wide range 
of measures including interpersonal closeness, gratitude, 
and life meaning/purpose [6]. Importantly, determinants 
of enduring effects were psilocybin-occasioned mystical-
type experience and rates of engagement with meditation 
practices.

Smigielski  and  colleagues  [7,  108]  reported  similar 
outcomes following the administration of psilocybin to 
individuals  with  long-term  experience  of  mindfulness 
meditation during a 5-day Zen meditation retreat. This 
was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 38 
participants who were screened with psychometric instru-
ments and in addition with functional magnetic resonance 
imaging  during  the  resting  state  and  two  meditation 
forms, pre to post-intervention. The results of brain imag-
ing showed that psilocybin, particularly affected regions 
associated with self-referential processing (DMN). Nota-
bly, changes in this network correlated with participants' 
subjective experience of ego dissolution during the psil-
ocybin-assisted mindfulness session [118]. Four months 
of follow-up indicated that psilocybin produced bigger 
favorable gains in psychosocial functioning than placebo 
[7, 118]. Intriguingly, the results suggest that meditation 
appears to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while miti-
gating potential negative reactions.

Altogether, findings from the aforementioned studies 
suggest that mindfulness meditation when combined with 
psilocybin administration has the potential to alter both 
how we think and the content of our thoughts, making 
them more positive and open-minded. This combination 
may also help individuals maintain control over strong 
emotions that can arise when using psilocybin and could 
lead to improved communication skills. Ultimately, these 
effects  could  improve  various  psychological  variables, 
including  mood,  cognitive  control,  and  satisfaction  in 
relationships.

Mindfulness training and psychedelic 
intervention—predictive coding framework

Predictive coding is a new emerging framework that pro-
vides a promising avenue for understanding the effects of 
both meditation and psychedelics on consciousness. The 
predictive processing framework has been suggested as a 
unifying theory of the embodied brain and its cognitive 
functions [109]. The main assumption of this neurosci-
entific theory is that the brain operates as a prediction 
machine that constantly generates predictions about the 
world based on prior knowledge and sensory input. When 
predictions match sensory data, there is minimal predic-
tion error, leading to a feeling of coherence and confirma-
tion. However, when there is a mismatch, the brain updates 
its predictions, resulting in a sensation of surprise. An 
essential component for not being stuck in the pathologi-
cal forms of rigidity in thinking that underlie a variety of 
psychiatric problems, including depression and addictions 
[110], is to be able to effectively manage predictive errors 
based on sensitivity to error dynamics (the change in the 
rate of error reduction, [111]). Rate fluctuations signify 
that error reduction has deviated from expected outcomes, 
either  improving  or  worsening.  When  agents  perform 
beyond  or  below  expectations,  their  bodies  react  with 
positively or negatively valenced emotional responses. In 
other words, positively and negatively valenced affective 
states are indicators of better than or worse than expected 
error reduction, respectively. Agents who harness these 
emotional states to govern their actions are motivated to 
consistently enhance error reduction, and to function opti-
mally, it is crucial to be attuned to opportunities for mak-
ing progress in error reduction [112].

In the context of meditation, practitioners often aim 
to  reduce  prediction  errors  by  focusing  on  the  present 
moment, thus decreasing mind-wandering and promot-
ing a sense of calm and clarity. The mechanism behind 
this involves minimizing the brain's forecasting of future 
events  or  recall  of  past  ones,  and  as  prediction  errors 
reduce,  the  mind  naturally  wanders  less  since  it  is  not 
engaging in creating alternative scenarios or reflections. 
Consequently, this reduction in speculative and divergent 
thinking, which is achieved through sustained, non-judg-
mental awareness of the present, helps not only to stabilize 
mind, but also fosters mental calmness and stillness, as 
the cognitive load lessens and the mind is not juggling 
between various temporal thoughts. Meditation practices 
like mindfulness meditation train individuals to be aware 
of their sensations, thoughts, and emotions without judg-
ment, allowing them to fine-tune their predictive mecha-
nisms. Along this process, over time, being in the here 
and now decreases predictive processing itself, leading to 

1 3

the gradual reduction of counterfactual abstract process-
ing, including predicting self [113]. However, meditation 
can also induce extraordinary, novel mental experiences 
that cannot easily be accounted for by existing systems of 
beliefs (models), which leads to an increase of their uncer-
tainty and requires revision of them. Importantly, medi-
tation by its emphasis on body and mind stillness, may 
promote facts free learning [114] that is sudden insights, 
discovery or perspective without new information.

Psychedelics, on the other hand, can be seen as agents 
that temporarily disrupt the usual predictive processes. They 
induce alterations in perception, cognition, and self-aware-
ness by introducing unpredictability into the brain's opera-
tions, thus enabling new learning. This disruption can lead to 
profound and often mystical experiences, and in the case of 
psychopathology such as depression where negative beliefs 
form a maladaptive generative model of the world, these 
transformative experiences may lead to positive therapeutic 
outcomes. Specifically, relaxed beliefs under psychedelics 
(the REBUS model) [115] states that psychedelics serve 
to relax prior beliefs. In this context, it refers to softening 
the rigid and often impermeable cognitive and perceptual 
frameworks or assumptions that govern our experiences and 
interpretations of the world. When a collection of these prior 
beliefs forms a maladaptive generative model of the world, 
individuals may become “stuck” in a depressive episode. 
Through altered experiences, psychedelics therefore allow 
patients to shift from a maladaptive model to a healthier one, 
as these top-down depressive beliefs have less influence on 
the generation of conscious experience. Psychedelics might 
temporarily reduce the precision of predictions, allowing 
individuals to perceive the world with fresh eyes, poten-
tially leading to therapeutic insights [116]. In sum, medita-
tion aims to refine predictive processes for greater clarity, 
whereas psychedelics temporarily disrupt them, opening the 
door to novel perceptions and insights.

Conclusions

The relationship between mindfulness practice and psy-
chedelic intervention appears to hold promise as a synergic 
match. Research and historical contexts suggest that these 
two approaches can complement each other, potentially lead-
ing to more profound therapeutic experiences, enhancement 
of the positive effects and better mental health outcomes. 
Mindfulness training enhances the experience of ego dis-
solution induced by psychedelics, while these compounds 
can deepen meditation practices and engagement in spiritual 
practices, in both expert and novice meditators. Addition-
ally, when psychedelics are administered in natural settings, 
they spontaneously boost mindfulness capabilities, which 
can potentially support and enhance contemplative practices.

Those who want to achieve synergistic and improved 
results from a combination of psychedelics and mindfulness 
meditation may benefit from abiding by some basic rules:

1. Professional Guidance Ensure that any combination 
of these interventions is conducted under the supervision 
of trained professionals. Seek guidance from therapists or 
experts experienced in both psychedelic therapy and mind-
fulness practices.

2. Integration After a psychedelic experience, integrating 
the insights gained during the journey into mindfulness prac-
tice can be highly beneficial. Meditation and mindfulness 
can help individuals process and apply the lessons learned 
from the psychedelic experience to their daily lives.

3. Set and Setting Pay careful attention to the environment 
and mindset in which you engage in these practices. Create 
a safe and conducive setting for both mindfulness and psy-
chedelic experiences to maximize their potential benefits.

4. Mindful Preparation Incorporate mindfulness into your 
preparation for a psychedelic journey. Mindfulness tech-
niques can help reduce anxiety and set a positive intention 
for the experience.

5. Mindful Presence During a psychedelic experience, 
practice mindfulness by staying present and non-judgmental. 
This can enhance the depth of the experience and facilitate 
self-awareness.

6. Post-Session Reflection After a psychedelic session, 
engage in mindfulness-based reflection to process emotions, 
thoughts, and insights gained during the experience.

7. Consistency Maintain a regular mindfulness practice to 
support ongoing mental well-being and emotional resilience. 
Combining mindfulness with psychedelics can enhance the 
sustainability of positive changes.

8. Research and Education Continuously educate your-
self about both psychedelics and mindfulness. Stay informed 
about the latest research and developments in these fields.

9. Personalization Understand that the combination of 
these interventions may affect individuals differently. Tailor 
your approach to what works best for your unique needs and 
circumstances.

10. Legal and Ethical Considerations Adhere to legal and 
ethical guidelines regarding the use of psychedelics in your 
location. Ensure that any practices involving psychedelics 
are conducted responsibly and in compliance with applicable 
laws and regulations.

Above suggestions apply to the combination of psyche-
delic-assisted therapy and standard forms of low intensity 
MM. Future research should also consider evaluating if the 
combination of psychedelics and more intense mindfulness 
training in the forms of meditative retreats, could yield more 
significant benefits and, more specifically, for whom. Future 
studies may also benefit from evaluating the combination 
of specific types of mindfulness meditation with particu-
lar psychedelics to enhance specific abilities or alleviate 

1 31406

particular forms of psychological distress. For instance, one 
unconventional and understudied approach involves combin-
ing Metta meditation, also known as loving-kindness medi-
tation, with MDMA. Metta meditation is centered on nurtur-
ing feelings of love and compassion for oneself and others, 
while MDMA is a psychoactive substance renowned for its 
empathogenic effects. There is some evidence that MDMA, 
when administered in a therapeutic context, can enhance 
feelings of empathy and connection, which aligns with the 
goals of Metta meditation. Some observational studies have 
suggested that MDMA may enhance emotional empathy and 
self-compassion [117], the effects that are observed followed 
compassion-based meditation interventions [118].

While the review findings and experts' opinions high-
light the potential synergy and some commonalities in their 
mechanisms of action, it's important to note that this area of 
research is still evolving, individual experiences may vary, 
and not everyone may benefit equally from the combination 
of mindfulness and psychedelics. Research on the potential 
synergistic effects between mindfulness training and psych-
edelics suffers from the presence of methodological limita-
tions. Both fields of psychedelics and meditation are marked 
by strong bias effects [119, 120], so reported in studies ben-
eficial effects can be overestimated. For example, the uncriti-
cal promotion of psychedelics as a strong medicine directly 
affects participant expectancy in ongoing psychedelic trials 
[121]. To establish a conclusive and robust understanding 
of any synergistic relationship between mindfulness training 
and psychedelics, future research must address these limita-
tions. This includes conducting studies with larger sample 
sizes and implementing more rigorously controlled method-
ologies, including independent raters and active placebos. 
Replication studies with these improvements are essential to 
provide a clearer and more reliable picture of the potential 
benefits of combining mindfulness and psychedelics in ther-
apeutic contexts. Further research, clinical trials, and careful 
guidance are necessary to fully understand the mechanisms 
and potential risks and benefits of combined treatment with 
psychedelics and mindfulness training. The current state 
of research, however, suggests that this "marriage" could 
indeed be fruitful and long-lasting.
