Abstract 
Background  Long COVID-19 is characterized by systemic deterioration of the entire body, leading to significant 
physical and mental disorders. Exercise training has the potential to improve persistent symptoms and cardiopulmo-
nary functions.

Method  This was a single-center, randomized, controlled trial. Twenty-four patients aged 18 to 75 years who had 
a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and long COVID symptoms. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either a 4-week exercise training program or an attention control group. The training group participated in 12 super-
vised aerobic sessions on a cycling ergometer over 4 weeks. The outcomes were to assess the impact of a 4-week 
aerobic exercise on the persistent symptoms and cardiopulmonary fitness, the surrogate endpoints of COVID-19 
recovery and cardiopulmonary health.

Results  After the 4-week intervention, significant reductions were observed in the total number of symptoms 
in the training group. Specifically, 67.8% of patients in the training group exhibited reduced or completely resolved 
symptoms, in comparison to 16.7% in the control group (P = 0.013). After adjusting for gender, significant improve-
ments in the training group were observed for exercise time (Pgroup*time = 0.028), maximum load (Pgroup*time = 0.01), 
and peak  VO2 (Pgroup*time = 0.001), as well as  O2 pulse (Pgroup*time = 0.042) and maximum heart rate (Pgroup*time = 0.007). 
The score of Short Form-12, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia did not show significant changes 
between groups (Pgroup*time > 0.05).
Conclusion  A supervised aerobic training program has the potential to alleviate persistent symptoms and improve 
exercise tolerance in patients with long COVID-19. Further research is necessary to confirm these effects in a large 
population. This intervention could be easily implemented in non-hospital settings, potentially benefiting a broader 
range of individuals.

Introduction
With the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring 
that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency 
of international concern, focus has shifted to the man-
agement  of  its  long-term  effects.  Approximately  39  to 
46% of individuals who contract COVID-19 may expe-
rience  a  range  of  new-onset  or  persistent  symptoms, 
including  fatigue,  shortness  of  breath,  cough,  exercise 
intolerance, chest pain, and more [1]. These symptoms 
manifest within 3 months after infection and persist for 
over 2 months, significantly impacting daily life activi-
ties without any other identifiable cause, leading to the 
commonly  recognized  conditions  referred  to  as  “long 
COVID-19” [2].

Long  COVID-19  is  a  systemic  condition  that  affects 
multiple  organ  systems,  leading  to  severe  physical  and 
functional  impairments  [3].  Psychological  manifesta-
tions 
including  depression,  anxiety,  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder,  and  high  perceived  stress  are  also  fre-
quently  reported  [4].  These  prevalent  symptoms  may 
be  associated  with  the  short-  or  long-term  decline  in 
exercise capacity caused by organ and tissue damage in 
the myocardium, lungs, nervous system, and peripheral 
muscle tissue [5–7]. It is worth noting that despite the 
availability  of  vaccines  and  medical  treatments,  effec-
tively  managing  the  adverse  consequences  of  COVID-
19 remains a challenging task.

Given the central role of exercise tolerance in patients 
with  long  COVID-19,  exercise  rehabilitation  is  emerg-
ing as a potentially vital intervention for this condition 
[8].  Aerobic  exercise,  in  particular,  has  been  shown  to 
significantly enhance physical abilities and improve the 
quality  of  life  in  individuals  with  various  chronic  dis-
eases  [9].  It  positively  affects  metabolism,  pulmonary 
function,  cardiovascular  health,  neurocognitive  func-
tion,  and  musculoskeletal  conditions  [10–12].  Studies 
indicate that exercise rehabilitation can improve physi-
cal  function  and  mental  health  and  alleviate  persistent 
symptoms  in  COVID-19  survivors  [13,  14].  However, 
most  studies  on  long  COVID-19  patients  have  con-
centrated  on  pulmonary  rehabilitation  interventions 
and assessments such as pulmonary function tests, the 
6-min walk test, or the sit-to-stand test, while rare stud-
ies  conducted  aerobic  exercise  training  guided  by  oxy-
gen uptake from CPET assessment [15–17]. Although it 
has been suggested that a 4-week exercise program may 
yield  similar  improvements  in  exercise  capacity  and 
quality  of  life  as  longer  rehabilitation  programs  [18–
21],  the  effectiveness  of  such  short-term  aerobic  exer-
cise  training  in  improving  long  COVID-19  symptoms 
and cardiopulmonary function remains unclear. There-
fore,  we  hypothesize  that  a  tailored  4-week  exercise 
training program can alleviate persistent symptoms and 

improve  cardiopulmonary  function  in  long  COVID-19 
patients.

Materials and methods
Study design and randomization

This was a single-center, parallel-group, open-label, ran-
domized,  controlled  trial.  This  study  was  registered  at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05961462), approved by an ethi-
cal  review  board  by  the  Ethics  Review  Committee  (No. 
KY2023-053), and was conducted according to the Con-
solidated Standards of Reporting Trials extension check-
list: CONSORT-Surrogate [22].

Eligible  and  consenting  patients  were  randomized  to 
training or attention control groups in a 1:1 ratio (block 
randomization).  An  independent,  blinded  research  used 
a computer to generate a random sequence. Sequentially 
numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE) were pro-
vided  to  the  trial  assistant  who  arranges  patient  attend-
ance and appointments.

Participants

The  study  recruited  adult  patients  aged  18  to  75  years 
from  January  to  July  2023  in  the  cardiac  rehabilitation 
clinic.  Eligible  patients  were  those  who  had  a  history  of 
SARS-CoV-2  infection,  occurring  3  months  from  the 
onset  of  COVID-19,  and  presented  with  symptoms  per-
sisting  for  at  least  2  months,  without  any  alternative 
diagnosis to explain these symptoms. At least one of the 
following conditions is present: cough, dizziness, fatigue, 
cognitive  impairment  (memory  loss,  loss  of  concentra-
tion,  and  slow  thinking),  palpation,  chest  tightness  or 
pain, muscle pain, vision disturbance, dyspnea, diarrhea, 
anosmia/ageusia,  insomnia,  hair  loss,  voice  change,  or 
other  new  symptoms  after  COVID-19  infection.  Tested 
positive  for  COVID-19  quantitative  RT-PCR  or  antigen 
kit and turned negative for at least 4 weeks before inclu-
sion. Exclusion criteria included patients who have con-
ditions that may be worsened by exercise, such as acute 
cardiac  insufficiency,  exercise-induced  asthma,  or  epi-
lepsy.  Physical  disabilities  are  caused  by  bone  and  joint 
or  neuromuscular  diseases.  Patients  are  complicated 
with  other  serious  diseases  (such  as  unstable  angina, 
resting  oxygen  saturation < 93%,  untreated  heart  failure, 
uncontrolled arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, and 
uncontrolled type 2 diabetes). Women are also ineligible 
if they are pregnant or lactating. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all patients.

Intervention

Tailored  and  supervised  exercise  training  sessions  were 
conducted 3 times per week at the cardiac rehabilitation 
center  in  Guangdong  Provincial  People’s  Hospital.  The 
training  group  underwent  a  4-week  program  consisting 

Bai et al. Trials          (2024) 25:649 

Page 3 of 11

of  12  supervised  aerobic  training  sessions  on  a  cycling 
ergometer,  with  continuous  monitoring  of  heart  rate, 
blood pressure, and blood oxygen saturation.

The exercise intensity was personalized based on indi-
viduals’  peak   VO2  and  peak  power  (peak  WR),  which 
were  determined  through  cardiopulmonary  exercise 
testing  (CPET).  Two  aerobic  training  protocols  were 
employed,  moderate-intensity  interval  training  (MIIT) 
and  high-intensity  interval  training  (HIIT).  Both  began 
with  a  5-min  warm-up.  HIIT  and  MIIT  protocols  have 
been validated for their safety and efficacy in populations, 
which are common modalities for exercise training stud-
ies [21, 23–26].

In the MIIT protocol, the initial session’s intensity was 
set  at  40%  of  peak  WR  for  8  min,  followed  by  a  2-min 
rest,  repeated  for  4  cycles  (RPE12-14).  Subsequently, 
intensity increased to 50% of peak WR for 4 sessions and 
55% for the final 4 sessions (see Supplement Fig. S1A). In 
the  HIIT  protocol,  the  initial  4  sessions  mirrored  MIIT, 
followed by an intensity increase to 80% of peak WR for 
30-s  cycles  with  30-s  rest,  totaling  20–25  cycles.  After 
4  sessions,  intensity  rose  to  85%  and  then  90%  of  peak 
WR,  maintaining  the  same  cycle  duration  and  intervals. 
Repetitions  increased  gradually  from  20  to  25  (RPE15-
17) (see Supplement Fig. S1B). Importantly, total energy 
expenditure  remained  consistent  across  both  groups.  A 
professional  CR  team  with  a  cardiologist,  a  nurse,  and 
a  physician  supervised  the  exercise  program  in  the  hos-
pital,  and  patients  received  encouragement  from  team 
members via telephone or WeChat to ensure attendance.
Control patients were informed to follow the guideline-
based recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and WHO 
guideline:  Self-management  after  COVID-19  Related 
Illness  [3,  27,  28].  Control  patients  were  contacted  by 
telephone or WeChat at 2 and 4 weeks to ensure a reas-
sessment  4  weeks  later.  Patients  in  the  intervention  and 
control groups with cardiovascular risk factors or cardi-
ovascular  disease  were  treated  by  professional  cardiolo-
gists following the guidelines for underlying disease.

Health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  was  measured 
with the Short Form-12 Health Survey, generating Physi-
cal Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Compo-
nent  Summary  (MCS-12)  scores,  ranging  from  0  (poor 
health) to 100 (excellent health) [30–33].

Depression and anxiety levels were evaluated by using 
the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9)  and  the 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales, respec-
tively,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  severity  [34, 
35].  The  Perceived  Stress  Scale  was  used  to  measure 
stress levels, with higher scores indicating elevated stress 
[36]. Insomnia severity was assessed by using the Insom-
nia  Severity  Index  (ISI)  scale,  categorized  as  0–7  points 
(normal  sleep),  8–14  points  (subclinical 
insomnia), 
15–21  points  (moderate  insomnia),  and  22–28  points 
(severe insomnia) [37].

Cardiopulmonary fitness and pulmonary function

All  patients  completed  a  symptom-constrained  maxi-
mum  load  exercise  test  on  a  cycle  ergometer  (JAEGER, 
Germany) while reporting their rate of perceived exertion 
(RPE).  The  test  followed  a  Ramp  protocol  with  power 
ergometer speed maintained at 55–65 r/min. Electrocar-
diogram (ECG), gas exchange, blood pressure, and  SpO2 
were monitored during warm-up, exercise, and recovery 
phases.  Calibration  adhered  to  manufacturer  specifica-
tions, and gas exchange and ventilatory parameters were 
continuously recorded.

Cardiopulmonary  fitness, 

including  peak  oxygen 
uptake  (peak   VO2),  oxygen  uptake  of  anaerobic  thresh-
old (AT  VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER),  O2 pulse, 
slope  of  ventilatory  equivalent  for  carbon  dioxide  (VE/
VCO2),  pulmonary  ventilation  (VE),  and  ∆VO2/∆work 
power  (∆VO2/∆WR),  was  assessed.  Pulmonary  function 
was  evaluated  by  a  computer-based  spirometry  system, 
including  forced  expiratory  volume  in  the  first  second 
(FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. 
The  CPET  procedures  followed  the  American  Thoracic 
Society (ATS) standard guideline [38].

Measurements and outcomes

Statistics

All  the  interested  outcomes  were  assessed  in  the  same 
laboratory  at  baseline  and  4  weeks  later.  The  change  of 
persistent symptoms and physical fitness were surrogate 
outcomes to evaluate the efficacy of exercise training.

Severity of symptoms

Improvements in persistent symptoms were defined as a 
reduction or disappearance of symptoms assessed using a 
designed questionnaire at 4 weeks compared to baseline 
[14, 29]. The total number of long COVID symptoms was 
quantified at baseline and 4 weeks.

Based  on  the  outcomes  of  a  previous  exercise  training 
study,  the  sample  size  was  calculated.  After  a  4-week 
exercise training, the peak oxygen uptake was improved 
significantly  at  18.66 ± 2.26  mL/kg/min  in  the  training 
group  compared  to  14.3 ± 2.22  mL/kg/min  in  the  con-
trol group [39]. To minimize both false positive and false 
negative  errors,  the  type-I  error  rate  (α)  is  set  at  0.01 
and the type-II error rate is set at 0.1. The sample size of 
each  group  was  estimated  to  be  10  per  group.  Taking  a 
20%  drop-off  rate  into  account,  we  finally  recruited  12 
patients per group (N = 24).

Analyses  were  performed  on  an  intention-to-treat 
(ITT) basis. Descriptive data are presented as mean ± SD 
or median (1st, 3rd quartile) for continuous variables or 
as  frequency  and  percentage  for  categorical  variables. 
Changes  in frequency  outcomes were  analyzed by using 
the   X2  test  or  Fisher’s  exact  test.  A  linear  mixed  model 
using maximum likelihood was performed to investigate 
the group, time, and their interaction effects between the 
training  and  control  groups  from  baseline  to  4  weeks. 
Gender  was  included  in  the  model  as  a  covariate  for 
adjustment. “Group” and “time” were designated as fixed 
factors  and  “patient”  as  a  random  factor.  Missing  values 
less  than  5%  were  imputed  using  the  sequence  mean. 
The  significance  level  was  set  at  P ≤ 0.05.  Analyses  were 
performed using SPSS software version 22.0 (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY).

Results
Patients

Twenty-four  patients  exhibiting  long  COVID-19  symp-
toms  were  randomized  into  the  exercise  group  and 
control  group.  All  the  patients  completed  the  baseline 
characteristics,  pre  to  post-coropulmonary  function, 
and mental status assessments. There was 1 patient who 

missed the baseline mental health assessment, for which 
the  research  team  imputed  the  relevant  data  (Fig.  1). 
Patients  in  the  intervention  group  finished  a  minimum 
of  12  exercise  training  sessions,  with  a  median  count  of 
12.5  (interquartile  range = 2)  sessions.  Adverse  events 
were recorded and shown in Supplemental Table S1. No 
patients withdrew from the study.

Overall,  patients  were  46.5 ± 15.1  years  old,  and  58.3% 
female  sex  (n = 14).  The  median  time  from  COVID-19 
diagnosis  to  study  enrollment  was  14  weeks.  Table  1 
shows demographic, clinical characteristics, and baseline 
COVID-19 symptoms. Each patient exhibited at least one 
long COVID-19 symptom and a maximum of six symp-
toms  at  baseline.  Cough,  fatigue,  cognitive  impairment, 
chest  discomfort,  and  palpation  were  the  most  com-
mon  symptoms. There  were  9  (37.5%)  patients  who  had 
the  habit  of  regular  exercise  (except  for  stroll).  All  the 
patients  in  the  training  group  did  not  drink  or  smoke. 
Training RPE and heart rate were recorded and shown in 
Supplemental Table S2.

(Table  2).  There  were  8  (67.8%)  patients  in  the  training 
group  who  had  reduced  or  disappeared  symptoms  after 
4  weeks,  compared  with  only  2  (16.7%)  patients  in  the 
control group  (X2 = 6.17, P = 0.013) (Fig. 2).

After 4 weeks, the score of SF-12, depression, anxiety, 
perceived stress, and insomnia did not show any signifi-
cant  change  between  groups  (all  Pgroup*time > 0.05),  while 
the depression score significantly decreased in the train-
ing group (P < 0.05) (Table 2).

Cardiopulmonary fitness and pulmonary function

Patients  in  exercise  and  control  groups  performed  their 
best during the pre and post-CPET, in which the average 
RER  was  greater  than  1.1.  Following  the  4-week  super-
vised  program,  we  identified  significant  differences  in 
cardiopulmonary function between the training and con-
trol group. Exercise time increased by 80.34s and 20.83 s 
in  the  training  and  control  groups  (Pgroup*time = 0.028). 
Maximum  load  also  increased  in  both  groups  (mean 
change,  watt:  20.25  vs.  3.83;  Pgroup*time = 0.01)  (Table  3). 
Significant  improvement  between  groups  was  observed 
for peak  VO2 in the training group (mean change, mL/kg/
min: 4.64 vs. − 1.06; Pgroup*time = 0.001) and AT  VO2 (mean 
change, mL/kg/min: 2.33 vs. − 0.37; Pgroup*time = 0.041).  O2 
pulse  (mean  change,  %:  6.92  vs.  2.58;  Pgroup*time = 0.042) 
and  maximum  heart  rate  (mean  change,  bpm:  12  vs.  4; 
Pgroup*time = 0.007)  also  revealed  a  significant  increase 
in  the  training  group  from  baseline  to  4  weeks.  No  sig-
nificant  differences  in  changes  between  groups  were 
detected  for  pulmonary  function  (Table  3).  In  the  exer-
cise group, no significant difference in the change of peak 
 VO2  was  found  between  HIIT  and  MIIT  intervention 
from baseline to 4 weeks (Pmode*time > 0.05).

Discussion
To  our  knowledge,  this  study  is  the  first  to  evaluate  the 
effects  of  a  4-week  supervised  aerobic  training  on  per-
sistent  symptoms  and  cardiopulmonary  capacity  in 
long-term  COVID-19  patients.  The  main  findings  dem-
onstrated  the  positive  effects  of  this  intervention  on 
alleviating  long  COVID-19  symptoms  and  enhancing 
exercise capacity compared to the control group engaged 
in  self-management.  Nevertheless,  no  significant  differ-
ences were observed in the improvement of SF-12, men-
tal health, insomnia, or pulmonary function parameters.
Exercise training can alleviate persistent long COVID-
19 symptoms, particularly fatigue, chest discomfort, and 
cognitive  impairment.  Fatigue  and  “brain  fog”  are  the 
most  common  long-term  symptoms  after  a  COVID-19 
infection  [40].  SARS-CoV-2  infection  induces  chronic 
neuroinflammation  and  the  accumulation  of  toxic  sub-
stances  within  the  central  nervous  system  while  simul-
taneously  infecting  skeletal  muscles  and  neuromuscular

junctions. These factors may collectively contribute to the 
occurrence  of  fatigue,  muscular  pain,  cognitive  impair-
ment,  and  psychological  disorders  [41–43].  Aerobic 
training may mitigate these issues through the synergis-
tic  effects  of  mitochondrial  function  boost,  cardiores-
piratory  system,  central  nervous  system  function,  and 
peripheral  muscle  fiber  repair  [9,  44].  Research  indi-
cates  that  a  6-week  home-based  rehabilitation  program 
has shown improvements in dyspnea and fatigue among 
individuals with persistent COVID-19 symptoms [45]. A 

systematic review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue 
syndrome suggests that exercise therapy does not worsen 
symptoms  and  leads  to  improvements  in  fatigue,  sleep, 
and physical function [46]. Additionally, exercise plays a 
role  in  enhancing  various  neurocognitive  abilities,  such 
as  memory  and  learning,  attention,  inhibitory  control, 
and  cognitive  flexibility  [47].  After  4  weeks  of  exercise 
training in the intervention group, the number of physi-
cal  symptoms  such  as  fatigue  and  muscular  pain  symp-
toms  significantly  improved,  and  there  was  a  tendency

Fig. 2  Distribution and changes in persistent symptoms pre to post exercise training. *Significant difference in symptom improvement 
or disappearance pre to post exercise training between the exercise and control group

towards  reduced  cognitive  impairment  compared  to 
the  control  group.  Other  symptoms  were  less  prevalent 
in  either  group,  but  the  overall  number  of  symptoms 
decreased after exercise intervention.

Chest  discomfort  is  a  common  symptom  among  long 
COVID-19 patients in this study. Notably, some patients 
had underlying cardiovascular disease, yet the chest dis-
comfort  and  palpitation  investigated  in  this  study  were 
newly  developed  after  COVID-19  infection.  Potential 
pathological responses include acute cardiac injury, viral 
myocarditis,  and  autonomic  dysfunction  in  individuals 
with  COVID-19  [48].  In  our  study,  the  training  group 
showed  reduced  chest  discomfort,  but  palpitations  did 
not significantly change due to the sample size limitation. 
Non-pharmacological measures should be considered as 
first-line  treatment  options,  especially  aerobic  progres-
sive  exercise  training  [49].  Aerobic  training  may  help 
regulate autonomic function to improve heart rate varia-
bility, enhance mitochondrial function, improve endothe-
lial function, and release myokines from skeletal muscles 
to enhance cardiovascular function [50, 51]. Additionally, 
the  multidimensional  improvements  achieved  through 
exercise therapy may reduce patients’ focus on persistent 
symptoms.

Exercise-trained  patients  did  not  exhibit  greater 
improvement  in  quality  of  life  and  mental  health  com-
pared  to  the  control  group.  However,  the  depression 
symptoms have been relieved in the training group over 
the  exercise  duration.  In  line  with  a  similar  study,  it 
observed improvements only in depression after exercise 
[13].  Evidence  supports  that  aerobic  exercise  improves 
depression and anxiety-related outcomes compared with 
attention  control  conditions  [52].  Potential  mechanisms 

could involve enhanced neural plasticity through neuro-
biological  processes  and  behavioral  learning  of  self-reg-
ulation  skills  [53].  A  study  of  the  effects  of  home-based 
exercise  in  patients  with  long  COVID  showed  patients 
in  the  training  group  had  higher  scores  in  the  physical 
component summary of SF-36 than those in the control 
group [14]. Our study showed similar results in physical 
function. In contrast to our results, a 4-week short-term 
rehabilitation  study  demonstrated  significant  improve-
ments  in  anxiety,  depression,  and  quality  of  life  among 
patients  with  cardiac  disease  [18].  These  benefits  were 
likely attributable to the higher intensity and frequency of 
the  exercise  program,  which  involved  3-h  daily  sessions 
and 5.5 days per week.

Reduced exercise capacity is a prevalent feature follow-
ing  COVID-19.  Possible  reasons  for  the  decrease  may 
involve  changes  in  both  central  (including  cardiac,  pul-
monary,  and  autonomic  functions)  and  peripheral  fac-
tors  (metabolic  parameters).  This  study  identified  that 
compared to the control group, cardiopulmonary fitness 
and peak  VO2/predicted of patients in the training group 
showed a substantial improvement. Peak  VO2 is a robust 
predictor  of  mortality  and  a  risk  factor  for  the  progres-
sion of various diseases [54]. Exercise rehabilitation pro-
grams  can  decrease  mortality  rates,  readmission  rates, 
and  enhance  cardiopulmonary  health  and  functional 
status by improving blood circulation, increasing oxygen 
delivery  to  tissues,  and  enhancing  pulmonary  capacity 
[55–57]. Given the research that suggests that peripheral 
limitation  in  oxygen  extraction  is  the  main  determinant 
of peak  VO2 in patients with long COVID-19 [58, 59], the 
significant improvement in peak  VO2 in our population is 
possibly the main mechanism that explains symptomatic

improvement  in  the  number  of  patients  who  reported 
dyspnea, fatigue, and chest discomfort.

After  4  weeks,  the  training  group  exhibited  significant 
improvements in both maximum heart rate, load time, and 
power  during  the  CPET  test,  indicating  an  enhancement 
in  patients’  exercise  capacity.  At  the  same  time,   O2  pulse 
demonstrated an improvement in the training group, while 
 O2 uptake and heart rate can directly impact the calcula-
tion of  O2 pulse. The capacity of mitochondria to utilize  O2 
is enhanced after exercise training, resulting in a higher  O2 
pulse, even though stroke volume might not have changed.
Based  on  the  assessment  of  each  patient’s  CPET  and 
clinical symptoms, we implemented either HIIT or MIIT 
protocols.  Both  training  modalities  have  been  demon-
strated  to  be  safe  and  effective  in  improving  patients’ 
physical function [24, 25, 60, 61]. While patients under-
going MIIT may not tolerate the high-intensity demands 
of HIIT, the overall energy expenditure between the HIIT 
and MIIT groups remained consistent.

A secure and effective 4-week aerobic training program 
may  alleviate  persistent  symptoms  and  enhance  cardio-
pulmonary  fitness  in  individuals  with  long  COVID-19. 
However, this study is not without limitations. The sam-
ple  size  may  be  considered  relatively  small  (although 
adequately  powered  for  the  main  outcome).  We  did  not 
conduct  intergroup  comparisons  for  individual  persis-
tent  symptoms  separately.  Additionally,  we  conducted 
a  4-week  short-term  training  program  which  has  been 
shown to have the potential to improve physical function 
[21], but further long-term monitoring of changes in phys-
ical function, mental health, and quality of life is needed. 
However,  altogether,  the  overall  reductions  in  symptoms 
and  improvement  in  cardiopulmonary  function  suggest 
that there is a noteworthy indication to conduct a larger 
study, which potentially leads to more conclusive results. 
Besides,  although  we  did  not  use  a  detailed  scale  assess-
ment, the baseline exercise habits were relatively balanced 
between  the  two  groups.  Finally,  we  did  not  conduct 
stratified analysis for patients combined with comorbidity, 
which could potentially modify our findings.

Conclusions
The tailored and supervised 4-week aerobic training pro-
gram alleviated persistent symptoms and improved exer-
cise tolerance in patients with long COVID-19. However, 
no  significant  improvements  were  found  in  pulmonary 
function and quality of life. Exercise may play a substan-
tial  role  in  the  recovery  of  cardiopulmonary  functions 
and  mental  health  when  suffering  long  COVID-19.  In 
the  future,  multicenter  studies  with  larger  sample  sizes 
should  confirm  these  effects  and  address  the  efficacy  of 
different  exercise  modes  among  populations  enduring 
long COVID-19 symptoms.
