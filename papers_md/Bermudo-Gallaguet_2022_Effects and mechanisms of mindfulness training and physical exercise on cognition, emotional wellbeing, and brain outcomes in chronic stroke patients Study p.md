Strategies such as mindfulness meditation, physical exercise (PE), or
computerized cognitive training (CCT) may beneﬁt stroke patients by
impacting neuroplasticity and brain health.

Materials and methods: One hundred and forty-one chronic stroke patients
are randomly allocated to receive mindfulness-based stress reduction + CCT
(n = 47), multicomponent PE program + CCT (n = 47), or CCT alone
(n = 47). Interventions consist of 12-week home-based programs ﬁve days
per week. Before and after the interventions, we collect data from cognitive,
psychological, and physical tests, blood and stool samples, and structural and
functional brain scans.

Results: The effects of
the interventions on cognitive and emotional
outcomes will be described in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.
We will also explore potential mediators and moderators, such as
genetic, molecular, brain, demographic, and clinical factors in our per-
protocol sample.

Discussion: The MindFit Project is a randomized clinical trial that aims
to assess the impact of mindfulness and PE combined with CCT on
chronic stroke patients’ cognitive and emotional wellbeing. Furthermore,
our design takes a multimodal biopsychosocial approach that will generate
new knowledge at multiple levels of evidence, from molecular bases to
behavioral changes.

Introduction

Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide (Feigin
et al., 2017). Advances in acute treatment have increased the
number of people surviving a stroke which, in turn, has led to a
growth in the number of patients with long-term consequences.
It is estimated that up to 50% of stroke survivors experience
some degree of disability at chronic stages of the disease, which
jeopardizes functionality and quality of life (Donkor, 2018). This
burden aﬀects the daily life of survivors and their families and
implies high health costs for governments (Rigby et al., 2009;
Donkor, 2018).

Post-stroke cognitive and emotional complications are
frequent consequences in the chronic stages of the disease.
The prevalence of cognitive deﬁcits one year after stroke
ranges from 30 to 60%, depending on the study (Sexton
et al., 2019). Furthermore,
stroke signiﬁcantly increases
the risk of dementia in the long term (Pendlebury and
Rothwell, 2009). Regarding emotional wellbeing, post-stroke
in
depression and anxiety are common, being present
approximately one-third of
in
the patients at any point
time (Ayerbe et al., 2013). Both cognitive and emotional
disturbances are related to poor rehabilitation outcomes,
morbidity, and mortality (Ayerbe et al., 2013; Obaid et al.,
2020).

Standardized

interventions based on this concept
[e.g., mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR)] have grown substantially
in recent decades and have been successfully applied in
healthy and clinical human populations, with beneﬁts
reported in a broad range of variables: mental health,
cognition, pain,
fatigue, physical health, and quality of
life (Goldberg et al., 2022). In stroke, previous systematic
reviews emphasize the potential utility of mindfulness in
treating emotional disturbances
(Lawrence et al., 2013),
fatigue (Ulrichsen et al., 2016), and sensorimotor functions
(Zou et al., 2018), while its beneﬁts to cognition are still
understudied.

The eﬀects of mindfulness-based interventions may be
explained by multiple biological pathways
involving the
cardiovascular, metabolic, inﬂammatory, and neuroendocrine
systems (Reive, 2019). In healthy and clinical populations, the
most frequently reported ﬁndings (not always in a consistent
way) include reductions in circulating C-reactive protein (CRP),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and cortisol, and increases in brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I) (Sanada et al., 2017; Reive, 2019). Meanwhile,
neuroimaging studies have described structural and functional
brain correlates of mindfulness in areas and networks related
to attentional control, emotional regulation, and self-awareness
(e.g., prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, insula)
(Tang et al., 2015). However, neither blood biomarkers nor
brain data correlates of mindfulness have been addressed yet in
stroke.

beneﬁts of PE on cognition and emotional wellbeing across
diﬀerent age groups and health states (Rebar et al., 2015;
Stillman et al., 2020). In stroke patients, contrarily to the
eﬀects of mindfulness, the gains of PE on cognition and
emotional wellbeing have been more thoroughly studied.
Some meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have
shown small-to-moderate eﬀects of PE on cognition (Oberlin
et al., 2017), depressive symptoms (Eng and Reime, 2014),
and post-stroke health-related quality of
life (Ali et al.,
2021).

There might be a variety of processes behind the beneﬁts
of PE, including cellular and molecular, brain structure and
function, and psychosocial mechanisms (Stillman et al., 2020).

Biological mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional
beneﬁts of PE include increased production of growth
factors (e.g., BDNF, IGF-1), and decreased synthesis of pro-
inﬂammatory molecules (e.g., CRP, IL-6), and accumulation of
markers of neurodegeneration (Kandola et al., 2019; Stillman
et al., 2020; Erickson et al., 2022). At a brain level, the
positive inﬂuence of PE on the hippocampus and prefrontal
gray matter volume (Erickson et al., 2014), global white
matter volume (Sexton et al., 2016), and increased cross-
network speciﬁcity across various functional networks (Stillman
et al., 2019) have been described. Nevertheless, it should be
noted that most of this evidence comes from studies with
healthy older adults. In stroke, knowledge is still scarce,
with preliminary ﬁndings in animal models and clinical
studies focusing mainly on motor recovery (Xing and Bai,
2020).

Computerized cognitive training consists of

standardized cognitive exercises
performed through the computer or mobile technology (Gates
and Valenzuela, 2010). CCT has rapidly evolved in the
last decade because of its potential to systematically apply
personalized cognitive rehabilitation and its straightforward
implementation in at-home use (Solana et al., 2015). In
stroke care, multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
addressed the potential beneﬁts of CCT in cognitive functioning
(Mingming et al., 2022). However, although promising,
results remain inconclusive due to study heterogeneity and
methodological limitations. Some authors have further analyzed
the additive gains of combining CCT with PE in stroke
patients, with preliminary positive results (Amorós-Aguilar
et al., 2021).

From a molecular and brain perspective, applying CCT
following a stroke is based on the idea that repetitive cognitive
tasks might promote neuroplasticity mechanisms and restore
impaired cognitive function (Sigmundsdottir et al., 2016). Based
on animal models using enriched environments, some authors
hypothesize that cognitive stimulation promotes the release of
growth factors (e.g., BDNF and nerve growth factor) which,
in turn, enhances cell survival and proliferation in human
brains (Valenzuela et al., 2007). Few studies have shown
structural and functional brain changes after applying CCT
to stroke (van de Ven et al., 2016), while others have fallen
to prove any changes in neuroimaging data (Nyberg et al.,
2018).

Study oversight and schedule

Aims of the study

The primary objective of the MindFit Project is to examine
the eﬀects of MBSR and PE on cognitive and emotional
outcomes in chronic stroke patients by comparing three groups
of participants who receive: MBSR + CCT, PE + CCT, or CCT
alone. The primary hypotheses sustaining our main objective
are:

(1) All

three groups will experience gains at 3 months
and

emotional status.

(2) Given the study design (i.e., all three groups receive the
same CCT treatment, with the only diﬀerence being the
addition of either MBSR or PE), these improvements in
cognition and emotion will be greater in the combined
treatment groups than in the only CCT group (either to a
greater extent in the same outcomes or diﬀerent cognitive
and emotional measures).

(3) The add-on eﬀects of MBSR and PE will diﬀer from
each other (i.e.,
they will have a speciﬁc proﬁle of
cognitive and emotional gains). Although there is a lack of
studies comparing mindfulness and PE, we expect greater
emotional gains after MBSR than PE, while PE will produce
more cognitive beneﬁts than MBSR.

The secondary objectives of the MindFit Project are:

neurotrophic factors, gut microbiome species), the brain
level [i.e., structural and functional magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)], and the behavioral level (e.g., physical
activity and ﬁtness status, mindful thinking, sleep quality,
fatigue, quality of life).

The MindFit Project is a prospective, parallel, three-arm,
single-blinded randomized controlled trial. The trial consists
of three groups in total, of which two are intervention groups,
and one is the active control group. One hundred forty-one
participants at three to 60 months after stroke are randomly
allocated to one of three arms (1:1:1 allocation ratio). The ﬁrst
intervention group receives an MBSR program combined with
CCT; the second intervention group receives a multicomponent
PE program combined with CCT; and the third group, as an
active control group, receives only CCT. The interventions last
12 weeks, with assessments at baseline and within two weeks
after completion of the trial (see Figure 2). This study is led
by the Faculty of Psychology of the University of Barcelona in
collaboration with Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol
and Institute Guttmann. The responsible ethics committees
approved it following the Declaration of Helsinki. This protocol
follows the SPIRIT recommendations (Chan et al., 2013).

Deviation from the initial protocol

The MindFit Project was initially planned to be entirely
onsite. However, all interventions and most assessments (i.e., all
of them except for biological sample collection and brain scans)
had to be converted to online versions because of the COVID-
19 pandemic. The biological sample collection laboratory and
the MRI center remained open with extra protective measures
during the pandemic.

Furthermore, we ran several pilot groups to practice and
improve our protocols according to participants’ feedback.
Finally,
the project started in November 2020, and data
collection was completed in December 2021 (see NCT04759950
in www.ClinicalTrials.gov for the entire study version history;
ﬁrst posted on February 18, 2021).

(c) To determine the genetic [i.e., apolipoprotein E (APOE)
genotype], clinical (e.g., comorbidities,
level of brain
atrophy), sociodemographic (e.g., sex, age, educational
level), and individual factors (e.g., cognitive reserve, general
intelligence, personality),
that moderate cognitive and
emotional intervention-related changes.

Based on stroke epidemiology (Feigin et al., 2017), we
anticipated approximately 60% of the sample to be men and 80%

samples

All the assessments were online except for brain scans, blood
tests, and stool sample collection, which were done with extra
safety measures at the Hospital Universitari Germans Trias
i Pujol (Barcelona, Spain). We conducted online assessments
through the Zoom platform (except for medical and physical
visits, which were done using a hospital-speciﬁc platform).
A few days before the assessment, we communicated to the
participants the electronic platform which would be used, the
link to access the virtual room, and any material they needed to
have ready for the visit (e.g., printed documents or objects to do
the physical tests).

The assessment timeline is presented in Table 2. Assessors
received speciﬁc training and a written protocol of
the
assessment schedule and instructions. The same evaluators
carried out the baseline and post-intervention measurements to
minimize bias from inter-rater variability.

Randomization and blinding

After baseline assessments, an independent biostatistician
randomized the participants into the three groups through a
simple randomizing procedure with an equal allocation ratio
(i.e., 1:1:1; 47 individuals per arm) created with a random
sequence generator software. We did not use any stratiﬁcation
method due to practical reasons. The randomization sequence
was stored on an institutional server and was password
protected. Only the person in charge of the randomization,
who was not involved in either evaluation or intervention tasks,
had access to it.

Group allocation remained blind for all outcome assessors
and data analysts, while participants and care providers could
not be masked due to the nature of
the interventions.
Participants received instructions not to discuss any activities
related to the intervention with the outcome assessors during
the follow-up assessments.

Interventions

The interventions consisted of ﬁve daily sessions per
week for 12 weeks and were performed entirely remotely.

The mindfulness group received an MBSR program combined
with CCT;
the PE group received a multicomponent PE
program combined with CCT, and the control group only
received CCT. The duration of the combined interventions was
approximately twice that of the active control group. In the
two combined therapy groups, participants did not receive any
speciﬁc instructions regarding the order in which to perform
the interventions.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction and PE interventions
included (a) online synchronous sessions guided by expert
caregivers and done in groups of 8–12 participants and (b)
individual autonomous sessions. In contrast, the control group
performed all sessions independently through a computerized
telerehabilitation platform. To minimize the confounder eﬀect
of beneﬁts from peer interaction and social support in the
combined interventions, we invited participants from the
same intervention arm to communicate and share experiences
through WhatsApp groups.

practice session interspersed between sessions six and seven.
The MBSR intervention took place daily, ﬁve days a week.

20–40 min the remaining four days. An accredited mindfulness
instructor led the program. Participants were provided with
a program dossier that included theoretical explanations and
instructions for daily practice and audio recorded by the
instructor to guide the meditations. A detailed description
of the mindfulness intervention following the template for
intervention description and replication (TIDieR) guidelines
(Hoﬀmann et al., 2014) is given in the appendices (see
Supplementary Material 1).

Multicomponent physical exercise program

The PE intervention was designed following Billinger’s
recommendations for stroke survivors (Billinger et al., 2014). It
consisted of a 12-week program in which ﬁve weekly sessions of
45–60 min were done. Three of these sessions were conducted
in groups through video-conferencing technology and led by a
physiotherapist and a strength and conditioning specialist. The
other two sessions were individualized, and participants were
asked to walk. A detailed description of the PE intervention
following the TIDieR guidelines (Hoﬀmann et al., 2014) is given
in the appendices (see Supplementary Material 2).

Computerized cognitive training program

Computerized cognitive training was carried out using
the Guttmann Neuropersonal Trainer (Solana et al., 2015),
a computerized telerehabilitation platform. The intervention
consisted of a multi-domain task program in which diﬀerent
cognitive processes such as executive function, memory,
speed, and attention were included. The platform created
personalized training based on the scores obtained in the
baseline neuropsychological evaluation, age, and educational
level. From the cognitive proﬁle established, it was possible to
detect the deﬁcits presented by the participant and thus provide
speciﬁc rehabilitation exercises. The diﬃculty of the tasks was
adjusted according to the participant’s performance and the

therapeutic range (i.e., a percentage of correct answers between
65 and 85%). The training was done individually ﬁve days a
week, and the duration was 45 min per session.

Intervention adherence

Intervention adherence was counted as the total number
of sessions performed (i.e., the summation of face-to-face and
autonomous sessions). Instructors recorded attendance at face-
to-face classes, while participants ﬁlled in a diary whether
they had done the independent sessions and any diﬃculties
or inconveniences they may have experienced. Instructors
reviewed the diaries weekly and discussed with participants any
incidents or questions that may have arised. In addition, in the
case of the PE group, participants were provided with a physical
activity bracelet (Fitbit Inspire HR R(cid:13)) that they wore the whole
intervention.

Furthermore, we controlled whether the participant had
already taken any of these interventions before entering the
study and any other therapy he/she had followed concomitantly

Once assigned to a group and before beginning the
interventions, participants received an information session and
a written manual with the safety measures they should take
to avoid injuries or other potential adverse experiences. They
were also instructed to spontaneously report any adverse events

throughout the study and to ﬁll in a diary with any diﬃculties
or inconveniences they experienced during or after the sessions.
Instructors reviewed the diaries weekly and regularly informed
the project manager. Any severe event (e.g., fall, fracture) had
to be reported immediately to the Principal Investigator and the
Institution’s Research Ethics Committee. Adverse eﬀects will be
reported in future manuscripts following oﬃcial guidelines.

Tailoring participants’ individual needs

TABLE 5 Physical ﬁtness components of the Senior Fitness Test (Rikli
and Jones, 1999).

Given the breadth of the eligibility criteria, it was anticipated
that the sample would have a wide range of ages and varying
degrees of physical and cognitive disability. For this reason,
before starting any evaluation or intervention, we determined
the individual needs of each participant. Based on these, we
decided on the necessary accommodations, which could involve
a more comprehensive initial training in digital technologies
or speciﬁc physical,
linguistic, and cognitive adaptations.
For example, in the case of people with mild to moderate
aphasia who had impaired reading ability, self-administered
questionnaires were applied orally by an expert interviewer.
Supplementary Materials 1, 2 provide complete information
about the adaptations made during interventions.

Data management and results

Conﬁdentiality and access to data

Each participant was

identiﬁed with a dissociated
alphanumeric code assigned according to the order of
inclusion (i.e., when the patient signed the informed consent).
The principal
investigator and the project manager kept a
conﬁdential record of the participant’s personal information
and their assigned identiﬁcation codes. All trial data was
incorporated anonymously in a database stored in an
institutional server that requires a password to be accessed
(i.e., a strong password consisting of aleatory numbers, upper
and lowercase letters, and symbols). Once the database is
completed, a double-check process and an assessment of its
quality will be carried out. After results publication, data will be
shared in anonymized form upon reasonable request.

Baseline variables

Demographic data (i.e., age, gender, marital

status,
education, race/ethnicity, employment status, family income)
was obtained at baseline through an online questionnaire
answered by the participants. Further questionnaires were
administered to ascertain cognitive reserve (Rami et al., 2011),
personality (Costa and McCrae, 2008), adverse childhood
events (World Health Organization, 2020), and expectations
about treatment improvements. The Vocabulary and Matrix

Emotional wellbeing

Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were measured

the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Bados et al., 2005). Detailed
information on these questionnaires is provided in Table 4. We
will consider the changes in these questionnaires’ total scores as
primary outcome measures.

Secondary outcomes
Psychosocial and lifestyle measurements

We applied a broad range of online questionnaires (see
Table 4) to assess changes in subjective cognitive functioning
(i.e., dysexecutive symptoms, attention and memory failures
in everyday life), additional emotional wellbeing variables,
mindfulness, fatigue, functioning, quality of life, and lifestyle
behaviors. Furthermore, at

Analysis

Power analysis

Sample size calculations were conducted using the Granmo
v7.12 software. Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk
of less than 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, 47 participants in each
group are required to detect a minimum diﬀerence of 0.75
standard deviations between each pair of groups (assuming that
there are three) after standardization of the variables to have
mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This sample size supports a
20% tracking loss rate. We established a minimum eﬀect size
of 0.75 standard deviations by considering the results of meta-
analyses studying the eﬀects of mindfulness or PE on cognition
or emotional wellbeing in stroke patients (e.g., Abbott et al.,
2014; Oberlin et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2021). The
eﬀect sizes reported in these papers range from small-moderate
(between d = 0.30 and d = 0.50) to moderate-large (between
d = 0.50 and d = 1), depending on the intervention and the
outcome studied. We used an intermediate eﬀect size that was
realistic to the literature and satisﬁed our trial’s practical and
economic possibilities.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis will be carried out with IBM statistical
package for the social sciences (SPSS) Statistics 27 and
R environment. The same statistical pipeline will be run
twice, in two sequential phases: (1) intention-to-treat analysis
considering data from all randomized participants, including
those that complete and drop out of the study (in case of
missing values, an adequate method of imputation will be
executed whenever appropriate, depending on the proportion
of missing data and the missingness mechanisms); (2) per-
protocol analysis including only those who have had a
to or higher than 80%. The
treatment adherence equal
signiﬁcant threshold will be set at a two-tailed p-value of 0.05,

and an appropriate multiple comparisons correction method
will be implemented.

and the baseline score as ﬁxed covariates. Moreover, we
will contemplate the need to adjust for further unbalanced
factors between groups that appear to correlate strongly
with the outcomes. In case of violating the linear regression
assumptions,
the variables or methods

emotional domains.

Secondly, we plan to study the physiological mechanisms
underlying the changes produced by mindfulness and PE
through biomarkers to obtain evidence on the biological
pathways aﬀected by each intervention and the ﬁnal eﬀect
on the structure and functioning of the brain. A ﬁnal step
in understanding the possible eﬀects of our interventions will
be to analyze which personal and clinical variables moderate
their impact. In this regard, we will be able to determine
which strategies are most suitable for each patient proﬁle
and thus lead stroke rehabilitation toward a personalized
treatment model.

As a limitation of our study, we highlight the lack of
a passive control group that prevents us from determining
the eﬃcacy of CCT alone. On the other hand, 3 months

of intervention may not be enough to obtain robust and
clinically meaningful results. There is a possibility that we
will observe changes in biomarkers that are not reﬂected in
behavior. Instead, there may be changes in cognition and
emotional wellbeing that are not yet suﬃciently established
to see their molecular and brain correlates. Despite these
limitations, the MindFit Project has the potential and ability
to generate new knowledge at multiple levels of evidence,
from molecular bases to behavioral changes associated with
mindfulness and exercise therapies in chronic stroke patients. In
addition, the integration of a qualitative perspective will help us
understand the signiﬁcance of these possible changes and their
clinical relevance.

Dissemination

The results of the MindFit project will be presented in
numerous peer-reviewed publications. We will also publish
secondary analyses of the clinical trial, and cross-sectional
studies will be developed with the participants’ baseline data.
The results will also be presented at national and international
conferences. Our research group will strive to publish the
results regardless of their nature or direction concerning the
initial hypotheses.

We will also promote the divulgation of the knowledge
obtained: we will organize a closing day for our participants
the main results; we will provide
where we will present
participants with published articles translated into Catalan and
Spanish; we will create infographics with the results and publish
them through our newsletter and social networks.
