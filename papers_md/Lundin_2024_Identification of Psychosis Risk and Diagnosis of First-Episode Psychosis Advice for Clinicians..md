Abstract: Early detection of psychotic-spectrum disorders among adolescents and young adults is crucial, as the initial years after psychotic 
symptom onset encompass a critical period in which psychosocial and pharmacological interventions are most effective. Moreover, clinicians 
and researchers in recent decades have thoroughly characterized psychosis-risk syndromes, in which youth are experiencing early warning 
signs indicative of heightened risk for developing a psychotic disorder. These insights have created opportunities for intervention even earlier in 
the illness course, ideally culminating in the prevention or mitigation of psychosis onset. However, identification and diagnosis of early signs of 
psychosis can be complex, as clinical presentations are heterogeneous, and psychotic symptoms exist on a continuum. When a young person 
presents to a clinic, it may be unclear whether they are experiencing common, mild psychotic-like symptoms, early warning signs of psychosis, 
overt psychotic symptoms, or symptoms better accounted for by a non-psychotic disorder. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide 
a framework for clinicians, including those who treat non-psychotic disorders and those in primary care settings, for guiding identification and 
diagnosis of early psychosis within the presenting clinic or via referral to a specialty clinic. We first provide descriptions and examples of first- 
episode  psychosis  (FEP)  and  psychosis-risk  syndromes,  as  well  as  assessment  tools  used  to  diagnose  these  conditions.  Next,  we  provide 
guidance as to the differential diagnosis of conditions which have phenotypic overlap with psychotic disorders, while considering the possibility 
of co-occurring symptoms in which case transdiagnostic treatments are encouraged. Finally, we conclude with an overview of early detection 
screening and outreach campaigns, which should be further optimized to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis among youth.

Introduction
Psychotic-spectrum disorders such as schizophrenia have been recognized globally as among the most severe and debilitating 
health conditions that humans can experience.1,2 Psychotic symptoms consist of positive symptoms such as hallucinations and 
delusions, negative symptoms such as diminished emotional expression and motivation, and disorganized symptoms such as 
incoherent speech and atypical behavior, and are often accompanied by disturbances in functioning, cognition, motor skills, 
and one’s basic sense of self.3–5 Symptom onset typically occurs from late adolescence to one’s early twenties, an important 
developmental period referred to as emerging adulthood.6 The onset of psychotic illness during emerging adulthood can lead 
to  tremendous  disruptions  in  key  developmental  milestones  such  as  the  formation  and  maintenance  of  meaningful  inter-
personal relationships, pursuit of educational and career aspirations, and exploration of personal identity and independence.7
Importantly, research has shown that these functional disruptions unfold rapidly within the first few years following onset of 
psychotic illness.8–10 Moreover, longer duration of untreated psychosis (i.e., the delay between onset of psychotic symptoms and 
receipt of adequate mental health care) has been repeatedly shown to relate to poorer outcomes, including increased psychotic 
symptom severity, suicide risk, and criminal justice involvement, reduced quality of life, social functioning impairment, and lower 
likelihood  of  remission  and  treatment  response.11–15  Finally,  the  initial  years  following  onset  of  psychotic  symptoms  may 
represent a critical period for intervention, during which pharmacological and psychosocial treatments elicit the greatest treatment

response.16  Therefore, intervention for youth early in the course of psychotic illness can be critical for improving chances of 
recovery.

Intervening among youth showing initial signs of psychosis is crucial, yet these signs can be difficult to identify and diagnose. 
This difficulty is in part due to the heterogeneity of clinical presentations of psychotic and related symptoms across individuals.5,17 
For example, one individual may struggle with persistent fears of being followed and blunted facial affect, whereas another may 
experience  periods  of  hearing  voices,  speech  disorganization,  and  intermittent  depressive  episodes.  Added  complexity  of 
identifying  early  signs  of  psychosis  comes  with  variability  in  symptom  intensity  and  severity,  as  population-level  genetic, 
neuropsychological, social, and environmental studies have consistently found that psychosis exists on a continuum.18–20  An 
adolescent may present to the clinic reporting unusual perceptual experiences and odd beliefs, yet they may seem to be able to 
distinguish these experiences from reality, or perhaps these symptoms primarily occur when the person is exposed to reminders of 
a traumatic event. In such cases, it may not be readily apparent to the clinician whether the individual is exhibiting mild psychotic- 
like experiences common in the general population, early warning signs of psychosis, overt psychotic symptoms, or symptoms 
related to a non-psychotic illness.

At the lower end of the psychosis continuum, mild or transitory psychotic-like symptoms can include common experiences 
such as thinking that one’s cell phone is ringing or vibrating when it is not.18,19  Attenuated psychotic or clinical high-risk 
symptoms refer to more significant early warning signs of psychosis, such as hearing indistinct voices whispering a few times 
per week, with some distress or behavior change such as reducing social activities due to discomfort in groups of people.21 
Overt psychotic symptoms refer to symptoms meeting full clinical criteria for psychosis, such as hearing a clear voice making 
specific comments about one’s behavior daily, with marked distress or behavior change such as not leaving the house due to 
intense discomfort  interacting  with  others.5  This  psychosis  continuum  has  been  conceptualized as  having  a  dimension  of 
decreasing prevalence in the general population coinciding with a dimension of increasing severity.18 Another key factor to 
consider is level of insight into the symptom, or the extent to which an individual can distinguish the symptom from reality, 
which decreases along the continuum from mild psychotic-like symptoms to overt psychotic symptoms.

Accurate  assessment  of  where  a  person’s  symptoms  fall  on  the  psychosis  continuum  is  important  for  both:  1) 
clarifying  whether  intervention  is  warranted;  and  2)  selecting  the  appropriate  evidence-based  interventions  among 
available  options.  With  regard  to  the  former,  for  example,  youth  experiencing  mild  psychotic-like  symptoms  in  some 
cases  might  not  warrant  clinical  attention,  whereas  youth  exhibiting  distressing,  attenuated  psychotic  symptoms  may 
benefit from intervention (e.g., step-based care22,23), which could lower their risk of developing a psychotic disorder.24 
With regard to the latter, antipsychotic medications have demonstrated efficacy for many individuals with first-episode 
psychosis  (FEP)25–27  but  are  currently  discouraged  as  front-line  treatments  for  individuals  with  attenuated  psychotic 
symptoms given limited evidence of efficacy for preventing conversion to psychosis and high side effect burden.24,28,29
Overall,  the  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  provide  clinicians  with  a  framework  for  determining  whether  a  patient  is 
experiencing symptoms of FEP or early warning signs which may indicate heightened risk for developing psychosis. We 
will begin by outlining the defining characteristics of FEP and psychosis-risk syndromes, as well as common assessment 
tools used to diagnose these conditions. Next, we will provide examples of differential diagnoses which have phenotypic 
overlap with psychotic illnesses but for which different treatments may be indicated. Finally, we will conclude with an 
overview of approaches toward outreach and screening for psychosis in the clinic and community.

Clinical Characteristics of First-Episode Psychosis
Defining First-Episode Psychosis
FEP is a term used to describe a recent onset of overt psychotic symptoms, particularly delusions and/or hallucinations 
that are at times indistinguishable from reality, or disorganized speech that is tangential or incoherent.18 These symptoms 
occur  frequently  (e.g.,  averaging  at  least  1  hour  per  day,  4  days  per  week  for  1  month30)  and/or  are  seriously 
disorganizing  or  dangerous  to  oneself  or  others.  The  term  “first-episode  psychosis”  often  refers  to  the  experience  of 
psychotic symptoms with an onset within the past 2–5 years rather than exclusively referring to the individual’s initial 
psychotic episode. A more accurate term may therefore be “recent-onset psychosis.”31  However, given the widespread 
usage of the term FEP in clinics and research literature, we use it here for consistency.

Symptoms of FEP tend to present in the late teenage to early adult years of life.3,32  The etiology of psychotic-spectrum 
disorders is complex, with research suggesting these are neurodevelopmental disorders which emerge through gene-environment 
interactions.33  Individuals  with  FEP  may  meet  criteria  for  a  variety  of  psychiatric  disorders  outlined  in  current  diagnostic 
systems.3,34  Schizophrenia is the prototypical psychotic-spectrum disorder, consisting of two or more symptoms of delusions, 
hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms, lasting at least six months and 
resulting in functional impairment. Individuals with FEP may also meet criteria for schizophreniform disorder (i.e., schizophrenia 
symptoms lasting less than six months with no requirement of functional decline), brief psychotic disorder (i.e., one or more 
positive or disorganized symptoms of psychosis lasting between one day and one month), schizoaffective disorder (i.e., concurrent 
symptoms of schizophrenia and a major depressive/manic episode, with psychotic symptoms persisting for at least two weeks 
without mood symptoms, and mood symptoms present for  the majority of the illness), major depressive disorder or bipolar 
disorder with psychotic features (i.e., psychotic symptoms present primarily within mood episodes), delusional disorder (i.e., 
delusions as the primary psychotic symptom, with functioning intact aside from the impact of the delusions), or an unspecified 
psychotic-spectrum disorder, among others.

While discrete psychotic disorder diagnoses have clinical and practical utility (e.g., for assessing comorbid mood episodes, 
insurance billing), these disorders often share more overlap than differences with regard to neurobiology, cognitive function, 
and  other  illness  features.35  Specific  diagnoses  may  be  even  less  clear  among  individuals  with  FEP  than  those  with 
longstanding psychotic illness, as consistent patterns of co-occurring symptoms can take years to emerge. Therefore, here 
we  focus  on  the  identification  and  diagnosis  of  FEP  generally  rather  than  specific  psychotic  disorders.  Nevertheless, 
assessment  over  time  of  affective components  of  FEP  (e.g.,  co-occurring  depressive  and/or  manic  episodes)  and  specific 
symptom profiles is warranted to inform pharmacological and psychological interventions. Additionally, clinicians should rule 
out psychosis due to physiological effects of drugs of abuse, medications, and medical conditions prior to intervention.

Overall, though the specific clinical presentation of FEP is diverse and individualized across youth, many symptoms will fall 
into one of several characteristic symptom clusters: positive, negative, and disorganization of thinking, speech, and/or behavior.

Positive Symptoms
Positive symptoms are perhaps the most defining feature of psychotic disorders and are characterized by alterations in perception and 
thinking that often lead to significant impact on behavior and functioning.5 In the context of psychosis, “positive” denotes the addition 
of sensory and/or thought experiences that would not otherwise be present, namely hallucinations and delusions. Though positive 
symptoms are often highly distressing, they are the domain of psychotic symptoms most responsive to clinical intervention.36

Hallucinations within psychotic disorders describe sensory experiences that occur in the absence of external stimuli (i.e., 
another person in the same situation would not share the sensory experience) which are perceived as true stimuli. Hallucinations 
can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile), but most commonly occur in the auditory 
modality among individuals with first-episode37 and longstanding3 psychosis. Common types of auditory hallucinations among 
individuals  with  FEP  include  second-person  voices  making  negative  or  derogatory  comments  and  command  hallucinations 
instructing the experiencer to take certain actions. Common types of visual hallucinations among individuals with psychotic 
disorders include seeing distressing images of animals, people, faces, objects, or events (e.g., a lit fire in front of them).38

Delusions are tenaciously held, false beliefs that are not responsive to contrary information5  and are inconsistent with the 
individual’s  cultural  norms.39  The  content  and  expression  of  delusional  beliefs  is  highly  individualized  among  people  with 
psychotic  disorders.  The  most  common  delusional  themes  among  individuals  with  FEP37  and  longstanding5  psychosis  are 
persecution (i.e., false belief of being targeted or followed by a malicious person or entity, such as belief of being monitored by 
hidden cameras) and reference (i.e., false belief that there are messages or significant meaning in otherwise unremarkable aspects 
of the surrounding environment, such as belief of receiving special messages through the television). Other common delusional 
themes include grandiosity, thought insertion and withdrawal, guilt, mind reading, somatic, nihilistic, erotomaniac, and loss of 
control, among others.3

Negative Symptoms
Negative symptoms of psychosis are characterized by an attenuation or absence of various normative emotional, behavioral, 
and experiential processes.40,41 Negative symptoms can include reductions in motivation and interest, decreased social drive

and  social  behavior,  diminished  emotional  experience  and/or  expression,  and  a  reduced  ability  to  experience  pleasure.42 
Negative symptoms can be pervasive during the course of FEP;43  they are often treatment-resistant, tending to persist even 
when other aspects of illness are well-managed.44  Individuals with prominent negative symptoms during FEP tend to have 
poorer clinical outcomes over time.45 At the same time, negative symptoms can fluctuate early in the course of illness,46 with 
evidence that many individuals with prominent negative symptoms at the onset of FEP experience a significant reduction in 
these symptoms in the first year of treatment.47

Disorganized Symptoms
Many  individuals  with  psychosis  experience  symptoms  of  disorganization  impacting  thinking,  speech,  and/or  behavior.5 
Disorganized  speech  and  disrupted  communication  are  common  among  individuals  with  psychosis  and  can  manifest  in 
a variety of ways, ranging from mild difficulties with tangential speech to moderate or severe impairments that interfere with 
one’s ability to communicate even basic meaning to others.5,48 Disorganized behavior also exists on a continuum of severity 
and can include odd or inappropriate displays of affect, wearing clothing that is grossly mismatched to the weather or situation, 
and changes in movements and overall motoric activity.5 Though current diagnostic systems consider disorganized symptoms 
as a distinct symptom domain,3 these symptoms also overlap with the negative and positive symptom domains.49,50

Associated Clinical Features and Comorbidity
Though the positive, negative, and disorganized symptom clusters are highly representative of psychotic disorders, additional 
signs and symptoms are also common among individuals with FEP. In particular, individuals with FEP have prominent cognitive 
impairments  across  domains  (e.g.,  attention,  memory,  processing  speed)51  by  the  time  of  illness  onset.52  Though  cognitive 
impairment  is  robustly  linked  to  functional  outcomes  in  more  longstanding  psychotic  disorders,53  the  associations  between 
cognitive impairment and functioning among individuals with FEP are less clear.54,55 Many individuals with FEP also experience 
diminished insight or awareness of illness,56 which has been associated with longer inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.57

Individuals with FEP have high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in the early course of illness,58 including mood disorders, 
anxiety, and substance use disorders.59,60 Many comorbid conditions and cognitive impairment predate the onset of psychosis and 
may represent underlying risk factors for FEP.61 Individuals with FEP also have elevated rates of physical health comorbidities, 
including elevated rates of cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., elevated blood pressure and blood lipid levels).62 Longitudinal cohort 
studies suggest that, overall, individuals with FEP have an 11-fold increase in all-cause mortality in the 10 years following illness 
onset.63  Finally,  individuals  with  FEP  are  at  elevated  risk  for  suicide  and  self-harm,64  particularly  in  the  first  three  months 
following the initial diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.65 An estimated 5–10% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide,66 
and suicide is the leading cause of death among individuals with a psychotic disorder in the first five years following initial 
diagnosis.67

Clinical Characteristics of Psychosis Risk
Defining Clinical High Risk for Psychosis
Psychotic disorders are often preceded by a phase in which psychotic-like experiences become progressively more severe 
while daily functioning deteriorates, culminating in a full psychotic episode.68 “Clinical high risk for psychosis” (CHR-P) is 
a term that has been created to identify and provide preventative care to youth who are exhibiting these early warning signs 
prior to onset of a full psychotic episode. In addition to CHR-P, other commonly used terms for this state are “at-risk mental 
state” and “ultra-high risk for psychosis.”24,69 While previously referred to as the psychosis “prodrome”, usage of this term is 
decreasing as the majority of individuals who exhibit early warning signs of psychosis do not go on to develop a psychotic 
disorder.70  The  CHR-P  syndrome  is  also  transdiagnostic  and  dimensional  in  the  sense  that  it  confers  shared  risk  for  all 
psychotic disorders, rather than specific risk for specific psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia).71

Three  subtypes  of  psychosis-risk  syndromes  are  often  recognized.21,30,69  The  most  common  CHR-P  syndrome 
subtype  is  attenuated  positive  symptom  syndrome  (APSS),  comprising  around  85%  of  cases.72  APSS  is  identified  by 
the presence of persistent attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, occurring at least once per week for a month or more. 
A second CHR-P subtype is brief intermittent psychotic syndrome (BIPS), comprising around 10% of cases.72  BIPS is

identified  by  the  presence  of  overt  psychotic  symptoms  which  occur  intermittently  and  spontaneously  resolve  after 
a short span of time (i.e., lasting for at least several minutes, once per month, but occurring less than one hour per day, 
four  days  per  week).  A  third  CHR-P  subtype  is  genetic  risk  and  functional  decline  (GRD),  comprising  around  5%  of 
cases.72  GRD is identified by genetic risk (i.e., a psychotic disorder in a first-degree relative or the individual meeting 
criteria  for  schizotypal  personality  disorder)  plus  significant  decline  in  functioning  (i.e.,  a  greater  than  30%  drop  in 
Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF]73  scores within one year).

Finally,  psychosis  risk  has  also  been  conceptualized  through  the  lens  of  “basic  symptoms.”74  Basic  symptoms  are 
subtle,  subjectively  observed  alterations  in  thinking,  speech,  perception,  motor  function,  stress  tolerance,  affect,  drive, 
and self-experience, which are posited to be early manifestations of the neurobiological processes underlying psychosis. 
These  symptoms  can  fluctuate  over  time  and  might  not  be  observable  by  others.  While  they  can  precede  a  psychotic 
episode75 (and can even precede attenuated psychotic or CHR-P symptoms), basic symptoms may also be present during 
an acute psychotic episode as well as residual states of illness.74

Attenuated Positive Psychotic Symptoms
Most cases of individuals at CHR-P are identified via the presence of attenuated positive psychotic symptoms.21,76 Onset of these 
symptoms may occur following a stressful event (e.g., parents’ divorce, peer conflict, death of a loved one, other traumatic event) 
or following no apparent stressors. For some individuals, attenuated positive symptoms are experienced as longstanding since 
childhood but may become more frequent and impairing over time, and for others, they emerge for the first time in adolescence or 
young  adulthood.  Domains  of  attenuated  positive  symptoms  are  subthreshold  delusional  beliefs,  subthreshold  hallucinatory 
experiences, and subthreshold disorganized thought and speech. For example, an individual at CHR-P may begin to experience 
distressing thoughts that they are living in a simulation (i.e., unusual thought content), thoughts that others are laughing at them or 
playing  tricks  on  them  (i.e.,  suspiciousness),  ideas  that  they  have  special  talents  like  the  ability  to  predict  the  future  (i.e., 
grandiosity),  hearing footsteps or  doors slamming when no one  is present (i.e.,  perceptual abnormalities), and/or difficulties 
connecting their thoughts and conversing clearly with others (i.e., disorganized communication). See Table 1 for further examples 
and comparisons with symptoms at other stages in the psychosis continuum.

Most  people  in  the  general  population  have  had  one  or  more  of  the  mild  experiences  described  in  Table  1  in  their 
lifetime, consistent with fully dimensional models of a psychosis continuum in the general population.20 To meet criteria for 
the  APSS  CHR-P  syndrome,  attenuated  positive  symptoms  must  be  frequent  (e.g.,  occurring  at  least  once  a  week), 
perceived as significant or cause some level of distress, and may interfere with one’s daily functioning (e.g., an individual 
refrains  from  showering  at  night  due  to  worries  about  someone  breaking  into  their  apartment),  among  other  criteria.21 
Unlike overt psychotic symptoms (Table 1), attenuated psychotic symptoms include some capacity to distinguish symptoms 
from reality (in APSS subtype) or include full delusional conviction that is brief and intermittent (BIPS subtype). Of note, it 
is possible for individuals with psychotic-spectrum disorders to experience attenuated symptoms after already experiencing 
overt psychotic symptoms, in which case these would be classified as residual psychotic symptoms.

Associated Clinical Features and Comorbidity
Individuals at CHR-P may also exhibit attenuated psychotic symptoms in domains other than positive symptoms, such as 
negative (e.g., avolition, anhedonia,  blunted affect),  disorganized (e.g., odd behavior or appearance), and general (e.g., 
sleep and mood disturbance) symptoms.21,30  However, attenuated positive symptoms are primarily used in the diagnosis 
of psychosis-risk syndromes.

Youth  at  CHR-P  also  typically  experience  mild-to-moderate  cognitive  impairment  across  many  cognitive  domains 
compared  their  typically  developing  peers,77  which  often  persists  even  among  individuals  whose  attenuated  psychotic 
symptoms remit over time.78  Additionally,  youth meeting CHR-P criteria tend to retrospectively report poorer premorbid 
functioning (i.e., functioning up to one year prior to baseline assessments) in social and academic domains in proportion to the 
severity of their attenuated negative symptoms.79 Premorbid social functioning may be particularly relevant, as rapid declines 
in social functioning are known to increase risk for psychotic disorders within the clinical high-risk syndrome.80 Individuals at 
CHR-P are also at elevated risk for suicide,81,82 with one meta-analysis indicating that 66% of individuals reported suicidal 
ideation and 18% reported suicide attempts, although there were high levels of heterogeneity across studies.83

Notes: Above are examples of symptoms that a clinician may consider to be: 1) mild, non-distressing, not warranting clinical attention; 2) attenuated positive psychotic 
symptoms  potentially  indicating  that  one  is  at  clinical  high  risk  for  psychosis  (i.e.,  at-risk  mental  state;  ultra  high-risk  for  psychosis);  and  3)  overt  psychotic  symptoms 
potentially indicating  that one is experiencing FEP or a persistent psychotic disorder.  Note that thorough clinical assessment and relevant training and certifications  are 
needed to diagnose these symptoms and corresponding syndromes.

Most  individuals  meeting CHR-P also  meet criteria for  at least one other psychiatric  disorder  (roughly 80%), most 
commonly mood  (45%),  anxiety (35%),  trauma-related (30%),  and  personality  (25%)  disorders  (especially  schizotypal 
personality disorder).84 Some comorbid disorders remit over time; at follow-up durations longer than 2 years, prevalence 
of  comorbid  disorders  decreases  to  around  45–50%.  This  suggests  that  individuals  are  more  likely  to  be  identified  as 
being at CHR-P at times when comorbid psychopathology is particularly pronounced.

Likelihood of Developing a Psychotic Disorder
When  individuals  at  CHR-P  develop  a  psychotic  disorder,  they  are  said  to  have  “converted”  or  “transitioned”  to 
psychosis.  Overall,  only  a  minority  of  clinical  high-risk  cases  convert  to  psychosis  within  typical  follow-up  periods. 
At one year since presentation to the clinic, approximately 15% of individuals at CHR-P have converted to a psychotic 
disorder;  at  two  years,  roughly  20%  have  converted;  and  at  four  years  the  conversion  rate  plateaus  between  25%  and 
30%.70  Rates  of  conversion  to  psychosis  differ  between  the  three  subtypes,  with  conversion  being  more  likely  in  the 
BIPS  group  and  less  likely  in  the  GRD  group.72  Conversion  is  more  likely  among  individuals  with  more  severe 
functional  impairment  (especially  recent  declines  in  social  functioning),85  more  severe  attenuated  positive  psychotic 
symptoms, and among those who are male, unemployed, and/or have trauma histories.86

Lundin et al

Personalized risk calculators have been developed to estimate individuals’ risk of conversion.85 Conversion rates have 
decreased somewhat over time, potentially due to a combination of earlier treatment87  and case identification strategies 
based on broad outreach among clinicians and in the general population.88,89  In general, help-seeking individuals appear 
to  be  at  higher  risk  of  conversion  to  psychosis  than  individuals  identified  by  screening  or  outreach  in  the  general 
population.90  However,  individuals  who  do  not  convert  to  psychosis  do  not  necessarily  experience  symptomatic  or 
functional remission; around half experience persistent or worsening symptoms (roughly 60%)78  and functional impair-
ment (roughly 40–45%),91  despite not developing clinical psychotic disorders.

Diagnostic Assessment Tools
In this section, we provide a brief overview of several assessment tools that clinicians and researchers use to diagnose 
psychosis-risk syndromes, FEP,  and particular psychotic-spectrum disorders  (see Table 2).  Many of  these tools require 
specialized training and formal certification prior to use in clinical and research settings. There are numerous additional 
scales beyond those described here which assess level of symptom severity across the psychosis continuum.49,92,93

Tools for Diagnosing Psychosis-Risk Syndromes
The Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS)21,30  and the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental 
States (CAARMS)69 are semi-structured interviews designed to diagnose CHR-P syndromes (SIPS) or at-risk mental states

(CAARMS) and FEP among treatment-seeking individuals. In clinical practice, the clinical high-risk state and the at-risk 
mental state are quite similar, and a new measure has been developed to harmonize the two sets of criteria.94,106  The Bonn 
Scale for the Assessment of Basic Symptoms (BSABS)95  and the Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument (SPI)96,97  are semi- 
structured interviews used to assess basic symptoms, which are also indicative of psychosis risk.75

The SIPS and the CAARMS both include assessment of attenuated positive, negative, disorganized, and general psycho-
pathology symptoms, among other  domains. Psychosis-risk syndromes  defined using  these tools include:  1) APSS in SIPS; 
attenuated psychosis in CAARMS; 2) brief (limited) intermittent psychosis syndrome (BIPS in SIPS; BLIPS in CAARMS); 
and 3)  genetic risk  and  functional decline  (GRD  in  SIPS; vulnerability group  in CAARMS); see  Clinical Characteristics of 
Psychosis Risk section for further detail. These diagnoses are not mutually exclusive (e.g., an individual may have APSS and 
GRD). Attenuated positive symptoms on these measures include unusual thought content, perceptual abnormalities, disorganized 
communication (SIPS and CAARMS), non-bizarre ideas (CAARMS), and suspiciousness and grandiosity (SIPS). Symptoms are 
each rated on a 0–6 scale considering levels of severity, distress, behavioral impact, and conviction (i.e., insight, or ability to 
distinguish the symptom from reality). Ratings of 0–2 are considered to be within the range of typical functioning, ratings of 3–5 
are within the clinical high-risk range, and a rating of 6 indicates overt psychosis. In the SIPS, psychosis-risk diagnoses are given 
only if attenuated positive symptoms are not better explained by another psychiatric disorder. In the CAARMS, diagnosable 
psychosis-risk syndromes require that symptoms be present in the past year.

The  BSABS95  and  the  SPI96,97  assess  basic  symptoms  in  domains  such  as  alterations  in  energy,  drive,  stress  tolerance, 
emotional reactivity, cognition, attention, depersonalization, perception, motor function, self-experience, and central-vegetative 
function (e.g., sleep, appetite, libido, heart rate, thermoregulation). Psychosis-risk criteria using these tools primarily rely on 
cognitive and perceptual disturbances (e.g., thought interference, thought blockage, unstable ideas of reference, decreased ability 
to discriminate between fantasies and true memories, visual and acoustic perception disturbances). Basic symptom cognitive 
disturbances measured in conjunction with SIPS CHR-P criteria have more accurately predicted conversion to psychosis than 
either set of criteria in isolation,107 suggesting clinical utility in combining psychosis-risk assessments.

Of note, inclusion of psychosis-risk syndromes in psychiatric diagnostic classification systems has been debated.108 
“Attenuated psychosis syndrome” currently resides in the “Conditions for Further Study” section of the DSM-V and as 
a specifier of other specified psychotic disorders rather than being represented as a formal diagnostic category. Opponents 
of  adding  psychosis-risk  syndromes  as  clinical  diagnoses  cite  concerns  of  potential  high  false  positive  rates  due  to 
symptom ambiguity and low overall incidence of conversion to psychotic disorders, increases in unwarranted treatment 
(e.g.,  antipsychotic  medication),  and  unnecessary  stigma  to  diagnosed  individuals.108,109  In  contrast,  proponents  argue 
that formalizing psychosis-risk syndromes as clinical diagnoses would promote early identification and intervention for 
help-seeking individuals, catalyze clinical trials to strengthen the evidence-base for relevant treatments, and potentially 
decrease unwarranted treatment by reducing rates of misdiagnosis.110 Lastly, some evidence suggests that stigma may be 
more  related  to  psychosis-risk  symptoms  than  the  diagnostic  label  itself.111  Proponents  for  formalizing  the  diagnosis 
argue that stigma is unlikely to be greater for psychosis-risk diagnoses than the potentially inaccurate diagnoses that these 
individuals are already receiving, and regardless, increased access to care may outweigh any increases in stigma.110

Tools for Diagnosing First-Episode Psychosis and Psychotic-Spectrum Disorders
Psychosis-risk assessment tools  (e.g., SIPS, CAARMS) are useful for assessing for the presence of FEP  in addition to 
diagnosing clinical-high risk and at-risk mental state symptoms. These tools include ratings systems which offer a clear 
delineation between symptoms which fall within ranges of normative functioning, CHR-P, and overt psychosis indicative 
of  FEP  among  youth.  For  example,  if  unusual  thought  patterns,  perceptual  abnormalities,  and/or  communication 
disturbances  are  rated  as  a  6  in  severity  on  the  SIPS,  occur  frequently  for  sustained  periods,  are  not  accounted  for  by 
another psychiatric illness, and began or worsened within the past 2–5 years, the individual might meet criteria for FEP.30
If  an  individual  is  determined  to  be  experiencing  overt  psychotic  symptoms,  a  clinician  may  assess  whether  their 
symptoms  meet  criteria  for  a  specific  psychotic-spectrum  disorder  diagnosis  (e.g.,  schizophrenia,  schizoaffective 
disorder,  delusional  disorder,  etc.)  using  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  for  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5)3  or  the 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD–11).34  Common clinical interviews used to assess these diagnostic criteria

Differential Diagnosis
There are many instances in which a young person presents to the clinic with psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., odd beliefs, 
perceptual  abnormalities,  unusual  speech  patterns),  and  it  is  not  clear  whether  they  are  experiencing  overt  psychotic 
symptoms,  clinical  high-risk  symptoms,  or  symptoms  of  another  psychiatric  illness  altogether.113  Moreover,  comorbid 
psychiatric conditions are the norm rather than the exception for individuals with psychotic disorders, making differential 
diagnosis a challenging task for clinicians.114 Differential diagnosis can have important clinical implications, influencing 
access to care and treatment selection. See Table 3 for case examples of client presenting concerns, preliminary clinical 
impressions,  and  potential  referrals.  Next,  we  provide  examples  and  recommendations  for  differential  diagnosis  with 
a  focus  on  three  diagnostic  categories  that  have  significant  phenotypic  overlap  with  psychotic  disorders:  1)  autism 
spectrum disorder; 2) obsessive-compulsive disorder; and 3) post-traumatic stress disorder.

Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder  characterized  by  social  communication  difficulties  and 
restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or interests.3  Early conceptualizations of ASD and schizophrenia recognized their 
phenotypic overlap, with autism initially considered to be a symptom of schizophrenia.115 While current diagnostic systems treat 
ASD and psychotic disorders as distinct,3,34  their overlap and differentiation are still debated.116  For example, social commu-
nication difficulties among individuals with ASD can be misperceived as negative symptoms of psychosis, disorganized thinking, 
and  paranoia.  Additionally,  ASD  symptoms  of  sensory  sensitivities  and  idiosyncratic  speech  and  thinking  patterns  can  be 
misperceived as hallucinations and delusions. We offer the following recommendations to aid in the differential diagnosis of 
these disorders.

First, age of symptom onset and functional impairment typically begins in childhood for ASD and emerging adulthood for 
psychotic disorders.3 Second, tangential, stereotyped, or unusual speech which returns to specific or restricted topics of interest 
and reflect an individual’s baseline speech patterns may be more characteristic of ASD than psychotic disorders.117  Third, as 
distinguishing  characteristics  of  psychotic  disorders  are  overt  hallucinations  and  delusions,  asking  clarifying  questions  and 
eliciting specific examples is critical for differential diagnosis. For instance, an individual with ASD may endorse seeing or 
hearing things that others do not see due to hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli.118  An individual with ASD may also endorse

Importantly, there is not always a clear distinction between ASD and psychotic disorders even with rigorous clinical 
assessment,116,117  as  there  is  substantial  comorbidity122,123  and  genetic  overlap.124  While  some  individuals  with  ASD 
also experience attenuated positive symptoms, rates of transitioning from clinical high-risk state to a psychotic disorder 
do not appear to be impacted by the presence of ASD.125 Overall, if an individual is ultimately exhibiting comorbid ASD 
and psychotic illness, clinical services addressing the symptoms associated with distress and functional impairment from 
either or both conditions should be carefully considered.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by: 1) recurrent and persistent thoughts that cause significant distress and 
are perceived as intrusive or unwanted (i.e., obsessions); and 2) repetitive behaviors or mental acts (i.e., compulsions) that serve 
to reduce the distress associated with the obsession.3 Symptoms of OCD and psychotic disorders have phenotypic overlap, such 
as obsessions and compulsions which may present similarly to delusional beliefs and corresponding avoidance behaviors. To

further  complicate  matters,  the  DSM-5  includes  a  “with  delusional  beliefs”  OCD  specifier,  indicating  full  conviction  of  the 
obsessional belief(s). The DSM-5 provides few recommendations for  differentiating between OCD and psychotic disorders, 
merely noting that obsessions and compulsions are not diagnostic criteria for psychotic disorders, and hallucinations are not 
diagnostic criteria for OCD. Thus, we offer the following additional recommendations to aid in their differential diagnosis.

First, the content of the belief might be useful in distinguishing between obsessions and delusions.126 For instance, common 
themes in psychotic delusions include persecution, grandiosity, guilt, religion, thought insertion and withdrawal, thought broad-
casting,  mind  reading,  delusions  of  reference,  and  somatic  delusions.  In  contrast,  common  themes  for  obsessions  include 
contamination, violent or sexual thoughts, and “not just right experiences” (i.e., unsettling feeling that something is not as it 
should be). Second, the intrusive quality of obsessions and the experiencer’s retained insight into their excessive nature may be 
useful  for  differentiating  obsessions  and  delusions.126  Finally,  the  repetitive,  ritualistic,  and  often  time-consuming  nature  of 
compulsions might be useful in differentiating between compulsions and psychosis-related avoidance behaviors. For instance, 
checking  locks  a  specified  number  of  times  might  be  more  characteristic  of  OCD,  whereas  using  multiple  locks,  blocking 
windows  and  doorways,  and  using  surveillance  strategies  (e.g.,  security  systems)  might  be  more  characteristic  of  psychotic 
paranoia. However, it is important to note that OCD and psychotic disorders can be comorbid,127 and clinicians should consider 
the possibility of co-occurring disorders.

Post-traumatic Stress Disorder
Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  trauma-related  disorder  characterized  by  the  experience  of  a  traumatic  event 
(exposure to an actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence) followed by at least one month of re-experiencing 
or intrusive symptoms, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in mood or cognition, and increased arousal or reactivity.3 
Trauma history is strikingly high among individuals with psychotic disorders (~28 to 73%),128 and severe symptoms of PTSD 
can overlap with the phenotypic expression of psychotic disorders.129 For instance, hypervigilance may overlap with paranoia, 
flashbacks may overlap with hallucinations, and both disorders can lead to significant occupational and social impairment.129 
To aid in the differential diagnosis of PTSD and psychotic disorders, we offer the following recommendations.

First, hypervigilance and paranoia might be differentiated by inquiring about the patient’s specific reasons for having such 
concerns. Trauma-specific mistrust may be more characteristic of PTSD (e.g., fear of future encounters with a specific male 
perpetrator, generalized fear of all men), whereas fears that are broader or unrelated to the trauma may be more characteristic of 
psychotic disorders (e.g., fear of all people, fear of the government). Second, the content of hallucinations in the context of PTSD 
is often trauma-specific and includes themes related to threat (e.g., hearing the perpetrators voice),130 whereas hallucinations in 
psychotic disorders may  have  broader themes  and  are rarely  solely trauma-specific. Thorough assessment  of the  nature and 
timeline of the trauma can also be helpful for differential diagnosis. For example, psychotic-like symptoms which occur primarily 
in response  to  trauma  cues  (e.g.,  situational  triggers,  anniversary  of  the  trauma)  may  be  more  indicative  of  PTSD,  whereas 
psychotic-like symptoms which occur without a particular cue or in response to stressors more broadly may be more indicative of 
a psychotic disorder. Importantly, studies have demonstrated that common assessment tools for PTSD (e.g., CAPS-5, PCL) are 
valid for use among individuals with psychotic disorders,131,132 and researchers have also developed modified versions of these 
tools to assess for co-occurring PTSD among individuals with schizophrenia.131

Transdiagnostic Approaches
In addition to the recommendations above for aiding in differential diagnosis, we encourage clinicians to identify underlying 
themes (e.g., mistrust, avoidance, social difficulties) that might be useful treatment targets that can guide treatment selection 
among  individuals  with  complex  or  comorbid  presentations.  For  instance,  avoidance  behaviors  may  be  addressed  using 
behavioral techniques (e.g., exposures and reality testing) regardless of whether the patient is experiencing symptoms of OCD, 
overt psychosis, or attenuated psychosis. Additionally, transdiagnostic treatment approaches (e.g., The Unified Protocol)133 
are  utilized  for treating  patients with  various  types  of emotional  disturbances,  including those  at  CHR-P.22  Finally, many 
evidence-based interventions designed for other diagnoses (e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD)134 can be useful for 
addressing comorbidities among individuals with psychotic-spectrum disorders.

Screening and Outreach
Despite  a  rapid  increase  in  specialized  clinical  services  for  individuals  at  CHR-P22  and  individuals  with  FEP,135  the 
majority of individuals early in the course of a psychotic or putative psychotic disorder do not access such specialized 
treatment programs. Consequently, outreach and recruitment activities are critical components for identifying individuals 
early in the course of a psychotic disorder to ensure access to specialized care during the time their  illnesses are most 
malleable.136  Common strategies employed to date include use of screening measures and outreach campaigns.

Screening Measures
Identification  and  diagnosis  of  individuals  at  CHR-P  and  those  with  FEP  typically  requires  completion  of  lengthy  clinical 
assessments such as the SIPS21,30 or the SCID-5.98 Although these assessments are the gold standard for identifying individuals at 
risk for psychosis and those experiencing FEP, they require significant training and time to complete, making them of limited use 
to many clinicians.137 Consequently, there has been increased interest in developing and validating brief, self-report assessments 
that can be administered in the general population to screen individuals prior to completing time-intensive clinical assessments.
Several  questionnaires  specifically  developed  to  screen  for  attenuated  or  overt  psychotic  symptoms  have  shown 
promise  in  identifying  individuals  at  CHR-P  and  individuals  with  FEP,  including  the  Prodromal  Questionnaire-Brief 
Version,101  the  PRIME  Screen-Revised,103  and  the  Youth  Psychosis  At-Risk  Questionnaire,104  among  others102,105,138 
(Table 2). Validity and accuracy of these measures has also been examined across cultures.139–141  Some common mental 
health assessments not designed to screen for psychosis (e.g., Child Behavior Checklist142  and both the self-report and 
parent-report  versions  of  the  Behavior  Assessment  System  for  Children143)  have  also  shown  promise  as  screening 
measures to identify individuals who may be early in the course of a psychotic disorder.

However, several limitations hinder the use of such measures as universal screening tools, including the lack of normative, 
demographic-specific data to inform thresholds for identifying psychosis or psychosis risk,144 the lack of symptom overlap across 
measures,145 and many scales’ exclusive focus on positive (or attenuated positive) symptoms of psychosis.146 Additionally, the 
ability of such scales to accurately differentiate individuals at CHR-P from those already experiencing overt psychotic symptoms 
is often limited.101 Finally, screening measures for psychosis and psychosis risk are in need of cross-cultural validation, as they 
may artificially inflate perceived rates of psychosis-related pathology among individuals from underrepresented and underserved 
backgrounds due to potential factors such as experiences of prejudice, crime, trauma, and variations in cultural norms.147–150

Outreach Campaigns
Many early psychosis intervention services have paired their clinical programming with an active outreach campaign designed to 
facilitate early identification and referrals to their program. To date, such campaigns are most well operationalized within the 
context of FEP programs, and their presence is often considered a marker of a high fidelity program.151 Through such activities, 
FEP clinical services strive to facilitate the early identification and referral of individuals to their service as soon as possible 
following the onset of psychotic symptoms with the goal of reducing the duration of untreated psychosis—a key, modifiable risk 
factor  for  which  longer  duration  of  untreated  psychosis  is  associated  with  a  worse  course  of  illness  for  individuals  with 
a  psychotic  disorder.14,152  Yet,  despite  the  near  ubiquity  of  outreach  campaigns  within  FEP  programs,  available  evidence 
questions their effectiveness in reducing duration of untreated psychosis among program participants.153,154 These findings may 
be in part due to heterogeneity in how both duration of untreated psychosis and FEP were operationalized across studies.154

The  presence  of  structured  outreach  activities  designed  to  facilitate  early  care  are  less  ubiquitous  in  programs  for 
individuals at CHR-P than among FEP programs.155 Although research on outreach campaigns for clinical high-risk programs 
is  limited,  available  evidence  suggests  that  a  combined  outreach  program  geared  toward  simultaneously  increasing  early 
access for individuals at CHR-P and individuals with FEP may increase eligible referrals to a CHR-P clinical service.156 More 
research is needed on the design and delivery of effective community outreach campaigns to facilitate early identification and 
access to care for individuals at CHR-P. Lastly, expansion of early psychosis detection campaigns is particularly needed within 
underserved  communities  which  often  have  limited  access  to  mental  health  care,  such  as  among  individuals  from  under-
represented racial and ethnic groups and those within criminal justice settings.157–159

Conclusion
Psychotic-spectrum disorders and psychosis-risk states are complex, heterogeneous, frequently comorbid with other condi-
tions, and lie on a continuum of human experience. Growing evidence indicates that the early phase of psychotic illness is 
a critical period in which intervention has maximum benefit for individuals in their recovery. Therefore, this review aimed to 
provide clinicians with a framework for identifying and diagnosing psychotic symptoms, attenuated psychotic symptoms, and 
psychotic-like  experiences  to  increase  diagnostic  clarity  for  help-seeking  youth.  Screening  and  outreach  campaigns  are 
particularly important across a variety of key settings (including schools, hospitals, criminal justice settings, and the general 
public) to promote early detection of psychosis and rapidly connect individuals to clinical care. Given that early signs and 
symptoms of psychosis often emerge alongside other forms of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, mood disturbances, trauma- 
related illness), a transdiagnostic approach to identification and treatment is strongly encouraged. Such work will address 
issues related to high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and promote overall wellness among youth.
