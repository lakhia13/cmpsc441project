Abstract
Background  Neurocognitive impairment is one of the prominent manifestations of major depressive disorder 
(MDD). Childhood trauma enhances vulnerability to developing MDD and contributes to neurocognitive 
dysfunctions. However, the distinct impacts of different types of childhood trauma on neurocognitive processes in 
MDD remain unclear.

Methods  This study comprised 186 individuals diagnosed with MDD and 268 healthy controls. Childhood 
trauma was evaluated using the 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. Neurocognitive abilities, 
encompassing sustained attention, vigilance, visual memory, and executive functioning, were measured by the 
Cambridge Neuropsychological Testing Automated Battery.

Results  Multivariable linear regressions revealed that childhood trauma and MDD diagnosis were independently 
associated with neurocognitive impairment. Physical neglect was associated with impaired visual memory and 
working memory. MDD diagnosis is associated with working memory and planning. Interactive analysis revealed that 
physical/sexual abuse was associated with a high level of vigilance and that emotional neglect was linked with better 
performance on cognitive flexibility in MDD patients. Furthermore, childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, and 
emotional neglect were revealed to be risk factors for developing early-onset, chronic depressive episodes.

Conclusion  Thus, specific associations between various childhood traumas and cognitive development in 
depression are complex phenomena that need further study.

Keywords  Major depressive disorder, Childhood sexual abuse, Childhood physical neglect, Vigilance, Cognitive

Introduction
Neurocognitive  impairments  are  a  common  feature  in 
individuals  with  major  depressive  disorder  (MDD)  [1, 
2].  It  has  been  observed  that  approximately  two-thirds 
of  MDD  patients  exhibit  disturbances  in  neurocognitive 
functioning  [3].  Some  reviews  have  consistently  identi-
fied impairments across various domains of neurocogni-
tion  in  MDD,  encompassing  attention,  vigilance,  visual 
memory, working memory, and executive functions such 
as  cognitive  flexibility/shifting,  planning,  and  decision-
making [4, 5]. Furthermore, these neurocognitive impair-
ments  often  endure  even  during  periods  of  remission, 
indicating  that  they  may  not  solely  be  a  consequence  of 
acute depressive symptoms (state-like) but rather possess 
a more enduring nature (trait-like) [6]. Nevertheless, the 
underlying  mechanisms  contributing  to  neurocognitive 
impairment  in  individuals  diagnosed  with  MDD  remain 
elusive.

Childhood  trauma  has  been  widely  studied  as  a  sig-
nificant contributing factor in the development of MDD 
[7]. Research has shown that approximately 54% of MDD 
patients  have  experienced  traumatic  events  during  their 
early  life  [8].  Meta-analyses  consistently  show  a  strong 
link  between  emotional,  physical,  or  sexual  trauma  in 
childhood and an increased incidence of depressive epi-
sodes  in  adulthood  [9,  10].  Such  adversities  not  only 
increase  susceptibility  to  suicidal  ideation,  reduce  qual-
ity of life, and elevate the prevalence of comorbid psychi-
atric  conditions  [11],  but  they  also  contribute  to  earlier 
onset  of  depressive  symptoms  [12],  poorer  treatment 
response  [13],  higher  relapse  rates,  and  a  prolonged 
course of depression [14]. However, further investigation 
is warranted to elucidate how specific types of childhood 
trauma affect the age of onset and duration of depression.
Evidence  suggests  that  childhood  trauma  is  linked  to 
neurocognitive  impairments,  particularly  declines  in 
executive function like inhibitory control, neurocognitive 
flexibility,  decision-making,  organization  and  planning, 
and working memory [15–17]. Individuals with a history 
of  childhood  trauma  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  for  severe 
executive  dysfunction,  which  affects  problem-solving, 
decision-making,  attention  regulation,  and  multitasking 
[18, 19]. Studies show that adults with childhood trauma 
often have poorer performance in cognitive domains like 
visuospatial  skills,  episodic  memory,  language  fluency, 
verbal learning and recognition, and cognitive processing 
speed  [20–22].  Additionally,  different  types  of  trauma, 
such as childhood neglect or abuse, are linked to distinct 
impacts  on  neurocognitive  impairment:  neglect  often 
leads to severe long-term deficits, while abuse is associ-
ated with slower cognitive responses [23–26] .

Incorporating childhood trauma into studies of neuro-
cognitive function in individuals with MDD is critical for 
a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay 

between  trauma,  psychopathology,  and  cognition.  Many 
previous studies, however, did not account for childhood 
trauma  as  a  potential  confounding  factor  when  investi-
gating  neurocognitive  outcomes  in  patients  with  MDD 
[1,  27].  Recent  research  has  increasingly  focused  on  the 
interaction  between  childhood  trauma,  MDD  diagnosis, 
and  neurocognitive  function,  though  findings  remain 
inconsistent.  For  instance,  adults  with  MDD  with  a  his-
tory  of  childhood  trauma  showed  poorer  performance 
in  delayed  visuospatial  recall  and  verbal  memory  rec-
ognition  compared  to  healthy  controls  [28].  Contrarily, 
another study has reported a positive correlation between 
the severity of childhood trauma and the decreased pro-
cessing  speed  in  MDD  patients  [29].  Moreover,  specific 
types  of  childhood  trauma  such  as  physical  abuse  and 
neglect,  have  been  associated  with  enhanced  cognitive 
abilities in visual and verbal memory, respectively, among 
MDD patients [30, 31]. However, some studies have not 
observed significant interactions between MDD diagno-
sis and childhood trauma experiences on neurocognitive 
functions,  highlighting  the  need  for  further  research  to 
clarify these complex relationships [32].

In  this  study,  we  hypothesize  that  specific  subtypes  of 
childhood  trauma  experienced  by  patients  with  MDD 
may  lead  to  distinct  patterns  of  neurocognitive  impair-
ment. Accordingly, the primary aim of the current study 
is to explore the interactions between different subtypes 
of  childhood  trauma  and  MDD  diagnosis  on  neurocog-
nitive  functions.  In  addition,  we  examined  the  potential 
associations between various forms of childhood trauma 
and  clinical  characteristics  observed  in  patients  with 
MDD.

Materials and methods
Participants

The  current  study  comprised  454  individuals,  with  ages 
ranging from 16 to 55 years. This study included 186 par-
ticipants  diagnosed  with  MDD  (125  women,  mean  age: 
27.7 years) and 268 healthy controls (HCs) (169 women, 
mean age: 26.4 years). The recruitment of MDD partici-
pants took place at the Department of Psychiatry in West 
China  Hospital,  Sichuan  University,  while  HCs  were 
enrolled  through  community-based  postings  and  media 
advertising.  The  diagnosis  of  MDD  was  established  by 
experienced  psychiatrists  utilizing  the  Structured  Clini-
cal  Interview  for  DSM-IV.  The  clinical  status  of  MDD 
patients  was  assessed  using  the  17-item  Hamilton  Rat-
ing  Scale  for  Depression  (HAMD),  with  a  score  greater 
than 7. Notably, all MDD patients were either drug-naïve 
or had discontinued psychotropic medication for at least 
three months prior to enrollment to in order to minimize 
the  potential  impact  of  medication  on  neurocognitive 
function [33].

Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:773 Exclusion criteria for all participants included (1) other 
major  psychiatric  disorders,  such  as  bipolar  disorder  or 
schizophrenia;  (2)  uncontrolled  or  severe  physical  dis-
ease;  (3)  substance  or  alcohol  abuse/dependence  his-
tory;  (4)  neurological  disease,  head  trauma,  or  loss  of 
consciousness for more than five minutes of consequent 
neurocognitive  impairment;  and  (5)  less  than  6  years  of 
education or inability to complete neurocognitive assess-
ment.  In  addition  to  these  criteria,  the  HCs  group  was 
further excluded if they had a current or previous psychi-
atric  disorder,  were  on  psychotropic  medication,  or  had 
a family history of mental disorders within three genera-
tions on either side of their family.

Written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all  par-
ticipants  or  their  legally  authorized  representatives.  The 
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and conducted 
in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declara-
tion of Helsinki.

Childhood trauma assessments

To  evaluate  childhood  trauma  experiences,  the  28-item 
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) 
was administered. This questionnaire assessed five types 
of self-reported childhood trauma occurring prior to the 
age  of  16  years,  namely,  emotional  abuse  (EA),  physical 
abuse  (PA),  sexual  abuse  (SA),  emotional  neglect  (EN), 
and  physical  neglect  (PN).  Each  subscale  consisted  of 
five items, with response options ranging from “never” (1 
point) to “always” (5 points). The total score of the CTQ-
SF ranged from 25 to 125, with higher scores indicating 
more  severe  experiences  of  abuse  and  neglect.  Expo-
sure to childhood trauma was defined as the presence of

moderate to severe levels of trauma if at least one CTQ-
SF  subscale  score  exceeded  its  respective  cut-off  value 
(EA score ≥ 13, PA score ≥ 10, SA score ≥ 8, EN score ≥ 15, 
and  PN  score ≥ 10).  The  “number  of  traumas”  variable 
was  then  calculated  based  on  the  number  of  subscales 
that exceeded their cut-off values [34]. The Chinese ver-
sion of the CTQ-SF has demonstrated high reliability and 
validity in patients with depression [35].

Neurocognition assessments

(CANTAB) 

The  Cambridge  Neuropsychological  Testing  Automated 
 (   h t  t p s  : / / w  w w  . c a  m b r  i d g e  c o  g n i t i o n 
Battery 
. c o m / c a n t a b / n e u r o c o g n i t i v e - t e s t s /     )  was  used  to  assess 
neurocognitive  abilities.  Specifically,  six  subtests  were 
administered: Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) 
for  sustained  attention  and  vigilance,  Delayed  Match-
ing  to  Sample  (DMS)  and  Pattern  Recognition  Memory 
(PRM)  for  visual  memory,  Intra/Extradimensional  Shift 
(IED)  for  shifting/cognitive  flexibility,  Spatial  Working 
Memory  (SWM)  for  working  memory,  and  Stockings 
of  Cambridge  (SOC)  for  spatial  planning  and  decision-
making.  Shifting/cognitive  flexibility,  working  memory, 
planning  and  decision-making  are  crucial  aspects  of 
executive  function.  The  neurocognitive  tests  were  con-
ducted in a fixed order, namely, RVP, PRM, DMS, SWM, 
IED,  and  SOC,  and  took  approximately  50  min  to  com-
plete. Detailed information regarding the neurocognitive 
performance testing procedure distribution of neurocog-
nitive variable residuals (Figure S1) were presented in the 
Supplementary  material.  The  neurocognitive  variables 
were Z-transformed for presentation in Fig. 1, using the 
formula: Z = (X - mean) / standard deviation. The main 
outcome  variables  are  provided  in  sTable  1,  with  higher 
scores  indicating  better  neurocognitive  performance, 
except for SWM_Str.

Statistical analyses

Statistical  analyses  were  conducted  using  R  version  4.0. 
Categorical variables (such as sex) were analysed using χ2 
tests,  while  continuous  variables  (such  as  age  and  years 
of  education)  were  analysed  using  two-tailed  t  tests  to 
detect differences between diagnostic groups.

Linear  models  were  employed  to  compare  the  dif-
ferences  in  childhood  trauma  and  cognition  functions 
between  diagnostic  groups,  with  age,  sex,  and  years  of 
education  serving  as  covariates.  The  Benjamini–Hoch-
berg  (BH)  procedure  [36]  was  used  to  control  false  dis-
covery  rates  (FDR)  of  multiple  tests  in  comparisons  of 
childhood trauma and neurocognition functions between 
diagnostic groups. A p < 0.05 after FDR correction (q) was 
considered statistically significant.

Multiple  linear  regression  analyses  were  conducted 
to  explore  potential  interactions  between  childhood 
trauma subtypes and MDD diagnosis on neurocognitive

dimensions,  with  age,  education,  and  sex  as  covariates. 
Partial Spearman correlations were performed to investi-
gate the association between clinical characteristics (such 
as  onset  age,  disease  duration,  and  HAMD  scores)  and 
childhood trauma in MDD, controlling for age, sex, and 
years of education. Given the exploratory nature of these 
analyses, adjustments for multiple comparisons were also 
applied [37].

Results
Demographics and clinical characteristics

As  depicted  in  Table  1,  there  was  no  significant  differ-
ence in age or sex between the MDD and HC groups (all 
p > 0.05).  However,  the  MDD  patients  exhibited  fewer 
years of education than the HCs (t = 5.66, p < 0.001). The 
onset  age  of  depression  was  25.18 ± 8.70  years,  the  total 
disease  duration  was  34.45 ± 50.01  months,  and  the 
HAMD total score was 20.44 ± 5.75.

Differences in childhood trauma between MDD patients 
and HCs

As  illustrated  in  Table  2;  Fig.  2,  the  total  and  subscale 
scores  of  the  CTQ-SF  were  significantly  higher  in  the 
MDD groups compared to and HC groups (CTQ-SF total 
score:  t = 10.4,  q < 0.001,  Cohen’s  d = 1.04;  EA:  t = 8.04, 
q < 0.001,  Cohen’s  d = 0.799;  PA:  t = 3.7,  q < 0.001,  Cohen’s 
d = 0.368;  SA:  t = 2.71,  q = 0.007,  Cohen’s  d = 0.27;  EN: 
t = 10.4,  q < 0.001,  Cohen’s  d = 1.03;  PN:  t = 8.58,  q < 0.001, 
Cohen’s  d = 0.853).  In  the  MDD  group,  56.5%  reported 
experiencing at least one type of childhood trauma, and 
37.1% reported experiencing multiple types of childhood 
trauma.  In  contrast,  these  figures  were  only  18.3%  and 
4.9%, respectively, in the HCs. Moreover, MDD patients 
reported a significantly higher number of childhood trau-
mas than HCs (t = 9.62, q < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.956).

without controlling for trauma, are presented in sTable 2 
and Fig. 2. The results of multiple linear regression analy-
ses are displayed in Table 3.

Sustained attention and vigilance

In the RVP task, MDD patients showed a lower probabil-
ity of hits (RVP_PH: t = -3.25, q = 0.004, Cohens d = 0.324). 
MDD diagnosis showed a negative effect on the sensitiv-
ity to error score (RVP A’, β = -0.136, p = 0.008, FDR cor-
rected). Moreover, sexual abuse was negatively associated 
with RVP A’ scores (β = -0.025, p = 0.001, FDR corrected). 
These  results  indicate  that  both  sexual  abuse  and  MDD 
diagnosis were associated with lower levels of vigilance.

The  interaction  between  MDD  diagnosis  and  emo-
tional  abuse  (β  =  -0.009,  p = 0.031)  indicated  that  a 
higher  score  of  emotional  abuse  was  associated  with  a 
lower  RVP  A’  score  in  MDD  patients.  Nevertheless,  the 
interaction  between  MDD  diagnosis  and  physical  abuse 
(β = 0.011,  p = 0.037),  and  MDD  diagnosis  and  sexual 
abuse  (β = 0.026,  p = 0.002,  FDR  corrected),  suggest  that 
physical  abuse  and  sexual  abuse  were  associated  with  a 
higher level of vigilance in MDD patients.

Visual memory

Without controlling for trauma, MDD patients displayed 
lower percentages of total correct scores in DMS task and 
lower percentages of correct response in the delayed pat-
tern  recognition  in  PRM  task  compared  to  HCs  (DMS_
PC:  t  =  -3.42,  q = 0.004,  Cohen’s  d = 0.34;  PRM_PCd:  t  = 
-3.19,  q = 0.004,  Cohen’s  d = 0.32).  After  controlling  for 
trauma,  no  significant  difference  between  the  MDD 
patients  and  HCs.  The  physical  neglect  score  exhibited 
a  negative  correlation  with  PRM_PCd  (PRM_PCd:  β  = 
-1.26, p = 0.023, uncorrected).

No  interactions  between  childhood  trauma  and  MDD 

diagnosis were found in relation to visual memory.

Executive function

In  MDD  patients,  lower  scores  were  observed  in  the 
number  of  problems  solved  in  minimum  moves  of  the 
SOC task when trauma was not accounted for (SOC_PS: 
t  =  -3.07,  q = 0.004,  Cohen’s  d = 0.307).  After  controlling 
for  trauma,  MDD  diagnosis  was  positively  associated 
with  the  scores  on  the  searching  strategy  in  the  SWM 
task (SWM_Stra: β = 7.32, p = 0.011). Physical neglect was 
positively  corrected  with  SWM  strategy  scores  (SWM_
Stra:  β = 0.433,  p = 0.019)  and  negatively  corrected  with 
scores on SOC_PS (SOC_PS: β = -0.156, p = 0.021).

A  significant  interaction  between  MDD  diagnosis  and 
emotional neglect was found for the number of switches 
completed in the IED task (IED_SC: β = 0.097, p = 0.006),

Association between childhood trauma and clinical 
variables in depression

As  illustrated  in  Table  4,  the  onset  age  of  depression 
exhibited  a  significantly  negative  correlation  with  child-
hood  trauma  (EA:  r  =  -0.180,  p = 0.018,  PA:  r  =  -0.200, 
p = 0.009,  EN:  r  =-0.258,  p = 0.001,  PN:  r  =  -0.160, 
p = 0.037).  Furthermore,  the  total  disease  duration  was 
significantly positively correlated with childhood trauma 
(EA:  r = 0.167,  p = 0.029,  PA:  r = 0.188,  p = 0.014,  EN: 
r = 0.23,  p = 0.003,  PN:  r = 0.183,  p = 0.017).  However,  no 
significant  correlation  was  observed  between  childhood 
trauma and HAMD scores.

Discussion
The  current  study  revealed  that  childhood  trauma,  par-
ticularly  physical  neglect,  and  sexual  abuse,  but  not 
emotional  neglect/abuse,  independently  predicted  neu-
rocognitive  impairment  in  adults.  These  deficits  were 
manifested in diminished strategic planning, visual mem-
ory,  and  vigilance  abilities.  MDD  diagnosis  also  showed 
negative  effects  on  vigilance  and  working  memory,  irre-
spective of trauma. However, individuals with MDD who 
experienced  certain  types  of  childhood  trauma,  namely, 
emotional  neglect/abuse  and  sexual  abuse,  displayed 
heightened levels of vigilance and cognitive flexibility.

Our  findings  indicate  that  childhood  trauma,  particu-
larly physical neglect, is linked to cognitive impairments, 
independent  of  a  diagnosis  of  MDD.  Physical  neglect 
was  associated  with  impaired  visual  memory  and  work-
ing  memory,  highlighting  memory  deficits  in  individu-
als  with  a  history  of  such  trauma  [16,  38]. These  results 
are  consistent  with  prior  research  showing  that  child-
hood  physical  neglect  can  impair  memory  function  and 
increase the risk of developing dementia in later life [39]. 
Furthermore,  physical  neglect  is  also  associated  with 
impaired executive function, which can have a profound 
impact  on  an  individual’s  social  functioning.  As  noted 
by  Moreno-Manso  et  al.  (2022),  individuals  who  expe-
rienced  childhood  physical  neglect  tend  to  exhibit  diffi-
culties in planning and impulsivity, which impaired their 
decision-making  and  problem-solving  abilities  in  their 
daily life [40]. This suggests that physical neglect not only 
disrupts  cognitive  processes  but  also  has  long-lasting 

consequences on an individual’s ability to navigate social 
and psychological challenges. Although we did not mea-
sure  brain  activity  in  this  study,  prior  research  suggests 
that  the  memory  deficits  observed  in  individuals  who 
experienced physical neglect may be related to structural 
and  functional  changes  in  specific  brain  regions,  par-
ticularly  the  prefrontal  cortex  and  hippocampus,  which 
are  crucial  for  memory  and  executive  function  [41,  42]. 
While these results did not survive FDR correction, they 
provide important clues that warrant attention to the role 
of physical neglect in cognitive development.

Our results revealed that patients with MDD presented 
impairments  in  sustained  attention,  visual  memory,  and 
planning  and  decision-making,  consistent  with  previous 
studies  [1,  4].  Nevertheless,  these  neurocognitive  dys-
functions  are  influenced,  at  least  in  part,  by  childhood 
trauma. The differences in sustained attention and visual 
memory between the MDD and HCs groups disappeared 
after controlling for five types of childhood trauma. Par-
lar et al. (2016) highlighted the prevalence of dissociative 
symptoms  among  MDD  individuals,  particularly  those 
with  a  history  of  childhood  trauma.  It  is  possible  that 
dissociative  symptoms,  instead  of  depression  symptom 
severity,  are  linked  with  poor  visuospatial  memory,  ver-
bal memory, and processing speed in MDD patients with 
trauma  history  [28].  However,  the  effect  of  depressive 
symptoms on memory may be confounded by the mild to 
moderate severity of depressive symptoms and the small 
sample  size  in  our  study.  These  findings  suggest  that 
future  research  on  cognitive  function  in  patients  with 
MDD  should  incorporate  an  assessment  of  childhood 
trauma history, as it may be a key factor contributing to 
the cognitive difficulties observed in this population.

The  interaction  between  childhood  trauma  and  MDD 
diagnosis  is  evident  in  our  findings,  which  suggest  that 
physical and sexual abuse are associated with heightened 
vigilance  in  adults  with  MDD.  These  results  are  consis-
tent with some previous studies. For instance, a previous 
study found that individuals affected by childhood sexual 
abuse  may  experience  a  state  of  hypervigilance,  exces-
sive self-reliance, and feelings of guilt [43]. Children who 
have  suffered  physical  abuse  attend  to  selectively  focus 
on anger-related stimuli and more likely to misinterpret-
ing  facial  expressions,  particularly  those  associated  with 
anger or fear [44]. Jaffee (2017) further revealed that the 
victim  of  childhood  abuse  may  develop  a  heightened

state of vigilance towards potential threats, characterized 
by an exaggerated negative bias even in response to mild 
threat  cues  [45].  MDD  patients  often  have  a  subjective 
perception of negative experiences [46], and negative bias 
is  indeed  one  of  the  most  prominent  symptoms  exhib-
ited  by  individuals  with  MDD  [47].  A  potential  mecha-
nism  underlying  this  heightened  vigilance  could  involve 
the  overactivation  of  the  amygdala,  a  brain  region  criti-
cally involved in threat detection and emotional process-
ing [48]. Researches have shown that the amygdala tends 
to be hyperactive in individuals with a history of trauma 
leading  to  an  exaggerated  response  to  perceived  threats 
and contributing to the persistent state of hypervigilance 
[49,  50].  The  findings  of  this  study  also  offer  valuable 
insights  for  providing  rational  psychological  interven-
tions for MDD patients who have experienced childhood 
physical and sexual abuse.

Childhood  emotional  neglect  is  revealed  correlated 
with  better  performance  in  cognitive  flexibility  in  MDD 
patients. While emotional neglect has traditionally been 
linked to deficits in cognitive flexibility [16], and depres-
sion  has  also  been  associated  with  impaired  cognitive 
flexibility [51], this finding suggests a more complex rela-
tionship  between  early  emotional  experiences  and  cog-
nitive  outcomes  in  MDD.  The  underlying  cause  of  this 
apparent  discrepancy  remains  unclear.  Some  evidence 
indicates  that  individuals  raised  in  unpredictable  envi-
ronments may display diminished inhibitory control but 
heightened  cognitive  flexibility  [52].  The  “hidden  talent 
hypothesis”  proposes  that  individuals  have  the  potential 
to  develop  latent  abilities,  particularly  cognitive  skills, 
that are strengthened by challenging circumstances [53]. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that MDD patients who 
experience  neglect  might  possess  better  metacognitive 
abilities  and  greater  resilience  [54].  Therefore,  it  is  cru-
cial to employ more sophisticated methodology to better 
understand  the  impact  of  childhood  emotional  neglect 
on  MDD  patients,  as  emotional  neglect  may  function 
as  an  unpredictable,  mild  stressor  rather  than  a  severe 
threat [53].

Childhood  trauma  can  lead  to  an  earlier  age  of  onset 
of  depression  and  a  longer  disease  duration.  Similarly, 
previous  research  has  indicated  that  childhood  trauma 
predicted  a  younger  age  of  onset,  with  emotional  abuse 
and physical neglect being the strongest predictors [55]. 
Individuals  who  have  experienced  childhood  trauma 
tend  to  experience  depression  episodes  approximately 
four years earlier than those without trauma [56]. Child-
hood trauma can trigger a cascade of neurophysiological 
responses  that  lead  to  persistent  changes  in  the  brain’s 
microscopic  organization  and  function,  contributing  to 
the early onset of MDD and prolonged duration of MDD 
[34, 57].

Several  limitations  should  be  taken  into  account  in 
the  present  study.  First,  while  the  CTQ-SF  is  a  reliable 
method  for  evaluating  childhood  trauma,  its  retrospec-
tive nature makes it susceptible to recall bias. Second, the 
effects of childhood trauma on neurocognitive functions 
are complex and may vary depending on factors such as 
developmental  stage,  timing  of  trauma  exposure,  and 
trauma  severity  [58]. Third,  excluding  MDD  patients  on 
psychotropic  medication  may  limit  the  generalizability 
of  our  findings,  as  such  medications  can  influence  cog-
nitive  function.  Future  studies  should  include  patients 
on  psychotropic  medication  to  better  account  for  how 
these treatments interact with childhood trauma in shap-
ing  neurocognitive  outcomes  in  MDD  patients.  Finally, 
the  cross-sectional  design  of  this  study  does  not  allow 
for  establishing  causal  relationship  between  childhood 
trauma and cognitive dysfunction, which future longitu-
dinal research should aim to address.

Conclusions
In summary, this study suggests that physical neglect and 
sexual  abuse  in  early  life  have  adverse  neurocognitive 
effects.  Physical  and  sexual  abuse  are  associated  with  a 
higher  level  of  vigilance,  and  emotional  neglect  is  asso-
ciated  with  better  cognitive  flexibility  in  MDD  patients. 
Future neurocognitive research in MDD needs to evalu-
ate  and  control  for  childhood  trauma  to  better  under-
stand the effects of MDD and specific childhood trauma 
on neurocognitive functions.
