Managing smoking cessation

Paul Aveyard,1 Robert West2

Cross sectional studies show that most smokers in
countries such as the United Kingdom and the United
States report that they want to stop and intend to stop at
some point.1 The rate of attempts to stop is high—78
attempts per 100 smokers per year in the UK—with
many smokers making several attempts in a year.2
Nearly half of all smokers expect not to be smoking
in a year’s time,3 but only 2-3% actually stop perma-
nently each year.3

The most common reasons smokers give for smok-
ing are stress relief and enjoyment,4 but the main
reason is nicotine dependence. Nicotine acts in the
midbrain, creating impulses to smoke in the face of
stimuli associated with smoking.5 Consequent changes
in brain chemistry also produce “nicotine hunger”
when a smoker goes without nicotine. A third mechan-
ism underlying nicotine dependence is nicotine with-
drawal: unpleasant mood and physical symptoms that
occur on abstinence and are relieved by smoking.6 7
Nicotine dependence is the main reason that most
unassisted quit attempts fail within a week.8 We give
evidence based recommendations and new treatment
options for healthcare professionals to increase the suc-
cess rate of these attempts. Most evidence for treatment
comes from randomised controlled trials summarised
in the Cochrane reviews for tobacco dependence.

Why should healthcare professionals help patients stop
smoking?
Just over half of all smokers manage to stop before they
die,9 but in many cases it is too late. The British doctors
study found that every year that smoking cessation is
postponed after the age of 40 reduces life expectancy
by three months.10 It is vital, therefore, to encourage
and support patients to stop as young as possible.
Even with help, most attempts to stop eventually result
in a return to smoking, and helping smokers stop can
feel futile. But the evidence clearly shows that what
doctors say and do about smoking in consultations
makes a huge difference to their patients—it is a matter
of life and death for many.

How should I broach the subject of smoking?
US and UK guidelines propose the “five A’s”: ask
about smoking, advise patients to stop, assess motiva-
tion to stop and need for pharmacotherapy, assist with
prescription or referral to a behavioural support pro-
gramme, and arrange follow-up. This does not

necessarily fit, though, with what doctors see as their
role and as what patients need.11 A simpler and more
patient centred approach is to ask the patient about
their smoking, acknowledging that they may have
tried to stop many times in the past, and discuss the
options that exist to support a quit attempt (fig 1).
When faced with an offer of support, many patients
(even those who were not thinking about making an
immediate quit attempt) will respond positively.12 13 It
is crucial to offer help, not simply to instruct, nag, or
even just advise patients to do something which most
already know they should do and have tried to do
many times.

Nicotine replacement therapy
A meta-analysis of more than 100 randomised con-
trolled trials shows that all forms of nicotine replace-
ment therapy are roughly equally effective in aiding
long term cessation (odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence
interval 1.66 to 1.88), but the data are insufficient to
exclude worthwhile differences in efficacy between
some forms, particularly the nasal spray, and the
others.14 One option for patients who have previously
used nicotine replacement but still failed to stop is to
give the patch as well as another form of nicotine repla-
cement, such as gum or lozenge. The patch provides
background nicotine replacement and the gum deals
with “breakthrough” urges. A meta-analysis of six trials
shows that patch plus an acute form of nicotine repla-
cement increases the likelihood of long term success
(1.42, 1.14 to 1.76).14

A meta-analysis of seven trials showed that nicotine
gum or inhaler used for 6-24 months by smokers aim-
ing to reduce consumption but not stop led to greater
carbon monoxide-confirmed reduction of smoke
intake than placebo nicotine replacement.15 We have
no good evidence on whether sustained reduction
assisted by nicotine replacement benefits health,
though cohort studies of smokers who reduce con-
sumption without nicotine replacement
found no
reduction in the incidence of smoking related disease

CLINICAL REVIEW

A smoker may feel a desire to stop,
which varies from moment to moment
depending on:
• Worry about health
• Dislike of financial cost of smoking
• Guilt or shame at smoking
• Disgust with smoking
• Hope for success at stopping

The desire or need to stop conflicts
with urges to smoke and desire to
smoke arising from:
• Anticipated enjoyment of cigarette
• Need for the forthcoming cigarette
• Concern about loss of self esteem if
     the quit attempt fails
• Concern about unpleasant short term
     effects of stopping
• Wanting or needing to hold on to the
     perceived benefits of smoking

Depending on the strength of the competing desires and needs, the conflict may result in:
• Putting the idea of stopping out of his or her mind
• Forming an intention to stop at some vaguely conceived future time point
• Forming a definite plan to stop at some future time point
• Deciding to stop immediately

Offering treatment can change this balance - small things can have a big effect on actions

and death.16 17 However, the meta-analysis also found a
relative risk 2.06 (1.34 to 3.15) in the likelihood of long
term abstinence, and modelling showed it is cost
effective.15 Nicotine replacement therapy is licensed
in the UK and elsewhere for reducing smoking before
stopping.

Antidepressants
A systematic review showed that people who stop
smoking experience depressed mood as a withdrawal
symptom, so it is logical to use antidepressants as ces-
sation treatment.6 7 One antidepressant, bupropion, is
licensed for use as a cessation aid and a meta-analysis of
31 trials shows that it approximately doubles cessation
rates (odds ratio 1.94, 1.72 to 2.19).18 Nortriptyline is
not licensed for smoking cessation, but a meta-analysis
of six trials shows that it is effective (2.34, 1.61 to
3.41).18 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the
first choice antidepressant in the UK and reduce with-
drawal symptoms in smokers, but a meta-analysis
shows they do not increase abstinence rates alone or
in combination with nicotine replacement.18 There is
insufficient and conflicting evidence from meta-
analyses on whether bupropion and nortriptyline
when added to nicotine replacement have increased
efficacy.18

A new drug
Varenicline is a newly licensed partial agonist acting
on the α
β
2 nicotinic receptor. A meta-analysis of ran-
4
domised controlled trials sponsored by the company
that makes it showed that varenicline is both more
effective than placebo (odds ratio 3.22, 2.43 to 4.27)
and bupropion.19 A meta-analysis comparing effect
sizes in nicotine replacement studies with those in var-
enicline studies concluded that varenicline is more
effective than nicotine replacement,20 but definitive
evidence will come from direct comparisons. The

studies of varenicline all
included frequent brief
(<10 minutes) support. The pharmacology of vareni-
cline and evidence from studies of other drugs for
cessation14 18 mean varenicline would probably work
without frequent behavioural support, and we suggest
using it if support is unavailable or unwanted. How-
ever, use of varenicline with behavioural support is
much preferred.21

Choosing treatment
Bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy, and vareni-
cline are reasonable first line choices, with nortripty-
line used second line. Smokers have usually stopped
several times and most have tried one or more drugs.
Using a drug that previously suppressed urges to
smoke is sensible. Using drugs that caused marked
side effects, did not work well, or that the patient just
does not believe in is inadvisable. Presenting the pros
and cons and allowing a choice is the ideal.

How do I treat special groups?
Light and social smokers
Almost all trials of medication for smoking cessation
include only moderate or heavier smokers, but a quar-
ter of UK smokers smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a
day, and 12% of all smokers do not smoke daily.2 3
Judging intake from cigarettes per day is unreliable—
differences in puff frequency, depth, and volume play a
bigger role in intake than number of cigarettes.22 A
review of observational studies showed that most
light and social smokers experience urges to smoke
and failure of attempts to stop,23 so we believe it is rea-
sonable to offer treatment. A subgroup analysis of one
randomised controlled trial of a nicotine lozenge
showed that the lozenge approximately doubled cessa-
tion rates and was as effective in light smokers as in
heavier smokers.24 A further randomised controlled
trial enrolling only light smokers showed that nicotine
gum was slightly but not significantly more effective
than placebo,25 but the odds ratio was consistent with
the meta-analysis of all trials of nicotine replacement
therapy.14 Use any short acting form of nicotine repla-
cement, and advise use as often as necessary to reduce
urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms.

Pregnant women
Programmes to help pregnant women stop smoking
reduce the incidence of low birth weight and preterm
delivery, a meta-analysis of randomised trials has
shown.26 Most women who stop in pregnancy in the
UK do so without help from a health professional,
and UK figures show nearly half of all women who
smoke before pregnancy suspend their smoking dur-
ing pregnancy.27 Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, and
there is theoretical concern but no direct evidence
that it could harm the fetus. Three trials of nicotine
replacement in pregnant women showed no evidence
of harm and no increase in cessation in pregnancy.28
However, the trials were too small to exclude benefit
of the size seen in non-pregnant women. The speed of

Age (years)

Fig 2 | Effects on smoking prevalence of strategies to help

nicotine metabolism increases by about 30% in preg-
nant women,29 which could impair the effectiveness of
nicotine replacement. A reasonable position is to dis-
cuss use of nicotine replacement, ideally within the
context of specialist support, and to use acute forms
such as gum or inhaler or take nicotine patches off at
night to minimise exposure to the fetus. The same
advice would apply to women who are breast feeding.

Adolescents
For adolescents aged 12 years and over, nicotine repla-
cement is the only drug treatment licensed in the UK.
Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of
nicotine replacement in adolescents have not found
evidence of efficacy,28 30 but interpretation is hampered

Prescribing smoking cessation drugs

Bupropion
Start bupropion while smoking and quit smoking in the second week. Use 150 mg per
day for six days, then 150 mg twice a day for eight weeks. Take the evening dose early
to avoid wakefulness. Causes 1 in 1000 to have a seizure, which needs discussion with
patient.
Nortriptyline
Start nortriptyline while smoking, increasing the dose from 25 mg to 75 mg. Quit while
taking the maximum dose and continue for 8-12 weeks, tapering down at the end.
Reassure patients that side effects abate in time and fewer than 1 in 10 patients stop
because of side effects.
Varenicline
Start varenicline while smoking. Comes in a starter pack escalating the dose from
0.5 mg daily to 1 mg twice a day by the second week. Quit in the second week. Continue
for 12 weeks. Most people experience mild to moderate nausea, which can be reduced
by taking varenicline after food and with water. Take the evening dose early to avoid
wakefulness. Side effects abate with time and fewer than 1 in 10 patients stop the
drug.
Nicotine replacement patches
Put the patch on smooth, hairless skin. Avoid using the same site for all patches. Put
the 24 hour patches on the night of the last cigarette. If it slides off, tape it on with
micropore. Skin reactions are common: check site rotation, use an emollient or
hydrocortisone cream, consider changing the make of patch or switching to another
form of nicotine replacement.

teachers in the UK will not accept young people

Is behavioural support or counselling effective?

If healthcare professionals specially trained to provide
behavioural support are available, doctors should refer
patients. Research with smoking cessation drugs has
typically been tested in this context. Behavioural sup-
port itself improves success rates: meta-analyses of

A patient’s story
My name is David, I am a smoker. I started smoking
53 years ago, at age 11. At the time there were no health
warnings. My father tried to stop me, owing to my age,
but if anything it made me more determined to smoke.
The first time I was advised to stop smoking on health
grounds was 1979, when I was 36 years old, and that
was at my army discharge medical.

Then the warnings started to appear in the press, with

the medical profession seeming to blame everything
from in-growing toenails to heart disease on smoking.
At the time I had few health problems. Then 18 years
ago I had a minor operation at a private hospital and
afterwards the surgeon told me I was wasting my money
unless I stopped smoking, so I made the first attempt at
stopping by undergoing a session of hypnotism. Alas it
didn’t work. The next attempt was a few years later when
I tried acupuncture, which seemed to be working until
the stud fell out. A year later I tried acupuncture again,
but a lack of determination meant I was smoking again
within three weeks.

The following years produced health problems,
ranging from peripheral vascular disease to irregular
heartbeat; I also had cancer of the bladder, all smoking
related. Needless to say a number of consultants and
my GP advised me to stop smoking, so I attended a
couple of smoking cessation groups, tried patches,
gum, and willpower, only for all to fail.

In March 2007 I had a chest infection, and after hearing

my symptoms my GP sent me to my local hospital for
further examination. This resulted in two days trying to
convince a registrar through a junior house officer that I
had a chest infection and not a heart attack. A succession
of ECGs and a treadmill session convinced her it was not a
heart problem but a chest problem, and I was discharged
with a letter but no treatment.

The meeting with my GP gave me the chance to ask
about a new drug that I had read about in the papers. My
doctor said that to get the drug I had to attend a
smoking cessation group. I enrolled along with my wife
and was prescribed the drug, and as a result my wife
and I smoked our last cigarette on 1 April 2007,
appropriately All Fools day.

Now nearly nine weeks later I am almost ready to call

myself a non-smoker. It hasn’t been easy; there have
been times when I have been dying for a nicotine intake,
but thanks to the support of my wife, the no smoking
group, and the medication I haven’t smoked for almost
nine weeks and I feel wonderful.

SUMMARY POINTS

Stopping smoking before the age of 40 is crucial to improve health—beyond 40, people lose
three months of life expectancy for every further year smoking
The most important factor leading to failure of attempts to stop is nicotine dependence
Nicotine dependence is most effectively treated with a combination of drugs and specialist
behavioural support, such as provided by the NHS Stop Smoking Service
Varenicline, bupropion, nortriptyline, and nicotine replacement are all effective
Relapse during or after treatment is common, and treatment is usually needed several times

trials of support versus brief advice found odds ratios of
1.56 (1.32 to 1.84) for individual support and 2.04 (1.60
to2.60) for group support.31 32 Regular support on the
telephone is also effective. A meta-analysis of 10 trials
of telephone support for people stopping smoking
gave an odds ratio of 1.64 (1.41 to 1.92).33

There is insufficient information to know which ele-
ments of behavioural support are effective or whether
one approach, such as motivational interviewing or
cognitive behavioural therapy, is more effective than
another. There is some evidence to suggest that group
support may be more effective in general than one-to-
one support,34 and that it should involve multiple
sessions.35 There is also evidence that such sessions
can be effective even if conducted over the telephone.
A meta-analysis of 10 trials of telephone support for
people stopping smoking gave an odds ratio of 1.64
(1.41 to 1.92).33 On the other hand, studies assessing
the effectiveness of behavioural support provided by
healthcare professionals in primary care with limited
training who are providing the service in conjunction
with other duties have not shown evidence of efficacy
beyond brief advice.35-37

Of the many web based support packages available
on the internet, only two have been evaluated in ran-
domised controlled trials.38 39 These trials of tailored
programmes enrolled smokers who were using nico-
tine replacement. Both trials showed significant bene-
fits 10-12 weeks after the quit date.

Other strategies
There are few adequate studies examining comple-
mentary therapies in smoking cessation. Meta-analysis

of trials of acupuncture and hypnotherapy showed no
benefit but could not exclude small effects.40 41

A systematic review found no randomised con-
trolled trials of the Allen Carr Easyway method.42
Two cohort studies with rigorous outcome assessments
showed abstinence rates similar to those expected from
behavioural support alone.42 The method discourages
use of medications such as nicotine replacement ther-
apy and thus runs counter to NICE guidance about
treatment for nicotine dependence.

How do I help my patients avoid relapse?

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials
concluded that there are currently no effective psycho-
logical interventions to prevent relapse after the initial
few weeks of abstinence. Extending use of bupropion
for a year delays but does not prevent relapse, but for
some smokers, extended use of nicotine replacement
might be effective.43 One randomised trial showed that
giving an additional 12 week course of varenicline to
people who were abstinent at the end of the first
12 week course reduced relapse to smoking by 30%
up to six months after the end of all treatment, com-
pared with placebo.19

Conclusions

Nicotine dependence is a life threatening disorder, most
of the complications of which can be avoided if it is over-
come before the age of 40. Now that there is strong evi-
dence for the efficacy of several medications and
specialist behavioural support, all doctors should ensure
that they know about these treatment options and regu-
larly offer these to their patients, as this can make a real
difference (fig 2). At least half of all cessation attempts in
the UK are made without any treatment, and only one in
20 are made with optimum treatment. Clinicians have a
key role in improving on this.
