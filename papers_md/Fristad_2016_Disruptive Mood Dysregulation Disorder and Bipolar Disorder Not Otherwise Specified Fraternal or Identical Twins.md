Abstract

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine similarities and differences between disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder (DMDD) and bipolar disorder not otherwise speciﬁed (BP-NOS) in baseline sociodemographic and clinical char-
acteristics and 36 month course of irritability in children 6–12.9 years of age.
Methods: A total of 140 children with DMDD and 77 children with BP-NOS from the Longitudinal Assessment of Manic
Symptoms cohort were assessed at baseline, then reassessed every 6 months for 36 months.
Results: Groups were similar on most sociodemographic and baseline clinical variables other than most unﬁltered (i.e.,
interviewer-rated regardless of occurrence during a mood episode) Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and parent-reported
General Behavior Inventory-10 Item Mania (PGBI-10M) items. Children with DMDD received lower scores on every item
(including irritability) except impaired insight; differences were signiﬁcant except for sexual interest and disruptive-
aggressive behavior. Children with DMDD received lower scores on eight of 10 PGBI-10M items, the other two items rated
irritability. Youth with DMDD were signiﬁcantly less likely to have a biological parent with a bipolar diagnosis than were
youth with BP-NOS. Children with DMDD were more likely to be male and older than children with BP-NOS, both small
effect sizes, but had nearly double the rate of disruptive behavior disorders (large effect). Caregiver ratings of irritability based
on the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R (CASI-4R) were comparable at baseline; the DMDD group had a small
but signiﬁcantly steeper decline in scores over 36 months relative to the BP-NOS group (b = -0.24, SE = 0.12, 95% CI -0.48 to
-0.0004). Trajectories for both groups were fairly stable, in the midrange of possible scores.
Conclusions: In a sample selected for elevated symptoms of mania, twice as many children were diagnosed with DMDD than
with BP-NOS. Children with DMDD and BP-NOS are similar on most characteristics other than manic symptoms, per se, and
parental history of bipolar disorder. Chronic irritability is common in both groups. Comprehensive evaluations are needed to
diagnose appropriately. Clinicians should not assume that chronic irritability leads exclusively to a DMDD diagnosis.

Introduction

Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) was

added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-5) in large part to decrease the overdiagnosis of
bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD), including bipolar disorder not
otherwise speciﬁed (BP-NOS) (in DSM-5, this diagnosis is incor-

porated into Other Speciﬁed Bipolar and Related Disorders, or
OSBARD) (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Although
temper outbursts and irritability are common symptoms in youth
presenting to outpatient clinics, by deﬁnition, DMDD is charac-
terized by persistent, nonepisodic irritability and/or anger that
go far beyond the severity and frequency of typical temper tan-
trums, with symptoms occurring persistently over at least 1 year

(American Psychiatric Association 2013). Additionally, by deﬁ-
nition, youth with DMDD maintain an irritable and/or angry mood
between outbursts, whereas youth with BP-NOS may return to a
euthymic state and are more likely to show spontaneous ﬂuctua-
tions or episodes (Findling et al. 2003; Youngstrom et al. 2008a;
Leibenluft 2011).

Previous studies examined a precursor to DMDD called severe
mood dysregulation (SMD) (Leibenluft 2011). Towbin and col-
leagues (2013) summarized the similarities and differences be-
tween SMD and BP-NOS based on their respective deﬁnitions.
Chronic irritability is required for SMD and allowable, but not
required, for BP-NOS. A history of distinct, recurrent manic or
hypomanic episodes that are too brief in duration (typically 2–3
days) to meet criteria for bipolar disorder type I or II are exclu-
sionary for SMD but required for BP-NOS. A family history of
bipolar disorder and the likelihood of converting to bipolar disorder
type I or II within 7 years is unlikely for SMD but is true for BP-
NOS in approximately half of the cases. A history of a full-duration
manic episode is exclusionary for both SMD and BP-NOS, as is a
history of hypomania. (For the BP-NOS group, this is only true if
there is also a history of major depressive disorder [MDD], which
would lead to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder type II.) However,
empirical comparison of these two diagnoses is quite limited.

The majority of research conducted on SMD has used data
collected from a highly selected sample from the National Institute
of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Program. Within a sample of
146 youth who met the SMD phenotype, the majority were male
(66%) and had elevated rates of attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) (86%), oppositional deﬁant disorder (ODD)
(85%), and anxiety disorders (58%) (Leibenluft 2011). Although
SMD includes the main criteria of DMDD, it also requires symp-
toms of hyperarousal similar to those of ADHD (Leibenluft et al.
2003). Although some research suggests similarities between
SMD/DMDD and bipolar disorder, such as deﬁcits in facial emo-
tion labeling (Guyer et al. 2007), differences are more common. In
an epidemiologic examination of parental psychiatric history,
parents of youth with SMD were signiﬁcantly less likely to be
diagnosed with a BPSD than parents of youth with a BPSD (2.7%
vs. 33.3%) (Brotman et al. 2007). Stringaris and colleagues
(2010) examined the longitudinal course of this cohort and reported
the children with SMD were 50 times less likely to develop a
(hypo-)manic or mixed episode than were youth with bipolar disorder.
According to a community-based follow-up study, SMD has a
lifetime prevalence of 3.3% in youth 9–19 years of age; at an 8 year
follow-up, youth diagnosed with SMD at an average age of 10 were
signiﬁcantly more likely than those not diagnosed with SMD to
have a depressive disorder by age 18 (odds ratio 7.2, conﬁdence
interval 1.3–38.8, p = 0.02) but not bipolar disorder (Brotman et al.
2006). It is of note that of those participants without SMD, one
quarter had other diagnoses, including any emotional disorder
(6.1%), any behavioral disorder (19.6%), any anxiety disorder
(4.5%), or substance abuse/dependence (8.8%) (Brotman et al.
2006). Copeland and colleagues (2014) followed this cohort into
adulthood. Those with SMD (using retroﬁtted criteria to meet
DMDD criteria by these authors) were signiﬁcantly more likely
than those without SMD/DMDD to have an adult depressive or
anxiety disorder, and they had a 10.3 greater odds of having mul-
tiple adult disorders than those without SMD/DMDD (Copeland
et al. 2014). The authors did not report on presence/absence of
bipolar disorder; therefore, it is unknown if rates differed in
adulthood between participants who did versus those who did not
meet criteria for SMD/DMDD as children.

A small number of studies have characterized DMDD. Within a
large community sample of 6-year-old children, 8% met criteria for
DMDD when criteria were retrospectively applied. Of these, 61%
demonstrated comorbidity with an emotional or behavioral disor-
der (Dougherty et al. 2014). Participants with DMDD had signiﬁ-
cantly higher rates of ODD and depression than participants
without DMDD (55% vs. 5%, 13% vs. 5%, respectively) (Dough-
erty et al. 2014). Both ODD and ADHD at 3 years of age predicted
DMDD at age 6 (Dougherty et al. 2014). Familial and environ-
mental predictors included low parental support, lower levels of
marital satisfaction, and parental lifetime substance use disorders.
However, parental internalizing disorders were not associated with
a DMDD diagnosis at age 6 (Dougherty et al. 2014).

Axelson et al. (2012) utilized the Longitudinal Assessment of
Manic Symptoms (LAMS) sample to characterize children who
met all DSM-5 DMDD criteria, with the exception being that
participants with BPSD were allowed in the DMDD group. Just
over one fourth (26%) of the LAMS sample met DMDD criteria
at baseline. Results indicated signiﬁcantly higher rates of ADHD
(79%), disruptive behavior disorders (96%; ODD 78%, conduct
disorder 18%) in children who met DMDD than in those who did
not meet criteria for DMDD. In addition, youth with DMDD had
signiﬁcantly elevated scores on dimensional measures of mania
and depression, and were more impaired than those without
DMDD.

Sparks and colleagues (2014) examined offspring of parents who
had bipolar disorder. They reported that these offspring were more
likely than offspring of community control parents to meet DMDD
criteria (odds ratio 8.3, 6.7% vs. 0.8%) and to have higher rates of
chronic irritability (12.5% versus 2.5%, p < .005). Chronic irrita-
bility was noted in offspring who had diagnoses of bipolar disorder,
depression, ADHD, and disruptive behavior disorders.

Margulies and colleagues (2012) examined rates of DMDD in 82
consecutive psychiatrically hospitalized c,hildren. They reported
that nearly one third (31%) of children met DMDD criteria by
parental report; however, only half of these (16%) did when diag-
nosis was based on inpatient observation. Over half (56%) of the 82
children had parent-reported manic symptoms (scores ‡20 on the
Child Mania Rating Scale-Parent form). Of these 46, nearly half
(n = 21, 46%) met DMDD by parental report but only one third
(17.4%) did based on inpatient observation. The authors concluded
‘‘The overall utility of the DMDD diagnosis and whether it would
prevent children from receiving other and better-deﬁned diagnoses
remains to be seen.’’ (p. 495).

To date, no one has compared DMDD directly with BP-NOS to
determine the similarities and differences between these two di-
agnoses over time. Cross-sectionally, the two diagnoses are ex-
pected to exhibit similarities (and, therefore, the new diagnosis of
DMDD is intended to decrease the misdiagnosis of bipolar disor-
der), but their longitudinal courses are expected to differ. This is
important as treatment, particularly pharmacologic interventions,
likely will differ for these two diagnoses. If DMDD develops into
treatment
depressive and/or anxiety disorders, antidepressant
would be a logical ﬁrst pharmacologic treatment of choice. Alter-
nately, if DMDD continues to show a more externalizing behavior
trajectory – consistent with the overlap in symptoms with ODD
(Axelson et al. 2011) and the cross-sectional comorbidities with
disruptive behavior disorders noted – then a different treatment
package of psychosocial (Eyberg et al. 2008) and pharmacological
interventions would be indicated ( Jensen et al. 2007). In contrast, if
BP-NOS continues to express itself as part of the bipolar contin-
uum, atypical antipsychotics and/or mood stabilizers likely would

be the ﬁrst pharmacologic treatment of choice (McClellan et al.
2007). Therefore, it is crucial to develop clear templates for clini-
cians so that they can precisely differentiate youth with DMDD
from youth with BP-NOS.

This study used a longitudinal cohort to compare children who
met diagnostic criteria for DMDD or BP-NOS at entry into the
study. First, we determined whether the two groups differed on a
variety of sociodemographic and clinical variables. Second, we
evaluated group differences in participants’ parent-rated irritability
over a 36 month follow-up period. We hypothesized that youth with
DMDD and BP-NOS would have many similarities on symptoms
common in outpatient clinics (e.g., irritability, aggression, impul-
sivity) but that children with DMDD versus BP-NOS would differ,
by deﬁnition, in their expression of classically manic symptoms
(e.g., euphoric mood, decreased sleep). Further, given the diag-
nostic criteria for DMDD, the two groups should exhibit distinct
irritability trajectories, with DMDD participants maintaining con-
sistently higher levels of irritability than youth with BP-NOS,
whose irritability should be largely conﬁned to episodes.

Method

Ascertainment of this sample has been described in detail else-
where (Findling et al. 2010; Horwitz et al. 2010). In summary,
institutional review boards at each university-afﬁliated LAMS site
(Case Western Reserve University, Cincinnati Children’s Medical
Center, the Ohio State University, and the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center) approved all procedures. Parents/guardians at
outpatient clinics provided written informed consent before com-
pleting the screening procedure, which consisted of a brief demo-
graphic form and the Parent General Behavior Inventory 10-Item
Mania Scale (PGBI-10M) (Youngstrom et al. 2008b) to screen for
elevated symptoms of mania (ESM). Results from this screening
were used to invite a group of children with ESM and a smaller,
demographically matched sample of children without ESM to enroll
into the longitudinal portion of the study, for which parents provided
consent and the children, assent, prior to their participation.

Sample

A subsample of 217 children 6–12.9 years of age from the
LAMS cohort (n = 685) were included in the current study on the
basis of a BP-NOS (n = 77) or DMDD (n = 140) diagnosis (deﬁned
subsequently) at baseline. In youth from the original cohort, the
diagnoses most commonly assigned at baseline were: ADHD
(76.1%), other disruptive behavior disorders (51.1%), BPSD
(22.9%), depressive disorders (17.5%). and anxiety disorders
(31.3%) (Findling et al. 2010).

Measures

Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-
Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL), with additional items
about depressive and manic symptoms from the Washington Uni-
versity St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL-W) (Kaufman et al. 1997; Geller et al.
2001). Additional questions were added to screen for pervasive
developmental disorders. Study interviewers completed this semi-
structured interview to assess current and lifetime psychiatric di-
agnoses and the duration of each illness. Mood disorder diagnoses
were evaluated at the baseline assessment and every 6 months
afterwards.

DMDD diagnosis. DMDD in the LAMS sample was origi-
nally operationalized by Axelson et al. (2012) using K-SADS-PL-
W items. For this study, we excluded 44 participants with bipolar
diagnoses (n = 27 who met criteria for DMDD and BP-NOS; these
participants were included in the BP-NOS group; n = 16, bipolar
type 1; n = 1, cyclothymic disorder) from the DMDD group to more
closely mirror DSM-5 criteria (American Psychiatric Association
2013).

(cid:2) Severe recurrent temper outbursts. This criterion was derived
from the ‘‘loses temper’’ item (at threshold, frequency is 2–5
times per week).

(cid:2) Chronic irritability. This criterion was derived from the ODD
section of the behavioral disorders supplement: ‘‘easily an-
noyed or angered’’ and ‘‘angry or resentful’’ items (both at
threshold).

(cid:2) Duration. Participants administered the K-SADS-PL-W
ODD supplement were assessed for the presence of symp-
toms for a least 6 months, regardless of if they met full
criteria for ODD. DMDD criterion states that symptoms must
have been present for at least 12 months, with no more than 3
consecutive months when the person was without the pre-
ceding diagnostic criteria.

(cid:2) Impairment in more than one setting. The ODD section of the
behavioral disorders supplement evaluated impairment in at
least two settings.

(cid:2) No presence of a BPSD diagnosis. Youth with any bipolar
spectrum disorder (i.e., bipolar I or II disorder, BP-NOS, or
cyclothymia) were excluded.

BP-NOS diagnosis. The LAMS study uses previously de-
veloped criteria from the Course and Outcomes of Bipolar Youth
(COBY) study to diagnose BP-NOS (Birmaher et al. 2009).
These are:

(cid:2) Child does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria for bipolar
disorder type I or II (American Psychiatric Association
1994)

Demographics. Parents/guardians provided information in-

(cid:2) A distinct period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irri-

cluding age, sex, race, ethnicity, and health insurance status.

Family history. The Family History Screen (Weissman et al.
2000) was completed to collect information on parental psychiatric
disorders. In addition to presence or absence of manic symptoms,
parents were considered to have a probable bipolar disorder if they
had elated mood plus three additional symptoms of mania or irri-
table mood plus four additional symptoms of mania.

Psychiatric diagnoses. Trained interviewers administered
to children and their parent or legal guardian the Schedule for

table mood plus the following
+ Two Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-
orders (DSM-IV-TR) B-criterion manic symptoms (three
if the mood is irritability only) that are clearly associated
with onset of abnormal mood (American Psychiatric As-
sociation 2000)

+ A clear change in functioning
+ Presence of elated and/or

irritable mood and manic
symptoms for a signiﬁcant part of the day (4 hours, al-
though this does not necessarily need to be expressed
consecutively)

Medication history. Parents/guardians provided a compre-
hensive history of the child’s past and current psychotropic medi-
cation usage.

Functional assessment. Study interviewers assigned ratings
on the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) following
completion of their comprehensive evaluation to assess the severity
of current and lifetime impairment (Shaffer et al. 1983). The CGAS
captures children’s functionality at home, at school, and with peers.

Mood ratings. Unﬁltered (meaning that severity of the symp-
tom was rated regardless of whether it occurred in the context of a
mood episode) (Yee et al. 2014) ratings of manic and depressive
symptoms that occurred in the previous 2 weeks were obtained via
interview of the child and parent/guardian using the Young Mania
Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Children’s Depression Rating Scale-
Revised (CDRS-R) (Young et al. 1978; Poznanski et al. 1984). In
contrast to methodology used by Axelson et al. (2012), the current
study included total scores of irritability items so that scores from
the two diagnostic groups in this study could be compared with
results from other studies.

Questionnaires. Several self-report measures were com-
pleted by caregivers to characterize children’s symptoms. Elevated
symptoms of mania were assessed using the PGBI-10M (Young-
strom et al. 2008b). Anxiety symptoms during the past 6 months
were obtained from the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emo-
tional Disorders (SCARED-P) (Birmaher et al. 1997).

Irritability scale. An irritability scale was derived from items
found in the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4R (CASI-
4R) ADHD, ODD, and conduct disorder subscales (Gadow and
Sprafkin 2005). This was done to generate a continuous irritability
variable based on caregiver report of the child’s symptoms. To
secure content validity with a previous well-validated irritability
scale, Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) items (Stringaris et al.
2012), were considered in the selection of CASI-4R items. Six
items were identiﬁed from the CASI-4R that mapped onto the ARI
items: 1) Loses temper, 2) irritable for most of the day, 3) touchy or
easily annoyed, 4) angry or resentful, 5) extremely tense or unable
to relax, 6) deliberately annoys others. Principal axis factor analysis

Statistical analyses used IBM SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp.
2013) and R (R Core Team 2014). Unweighted means, standard
deviations, and frequency counts were calculated for descriptive
statistics. Between-group differences were assessed with v2 ana-
lyses for binary variables and independent t tests for continuous
variables. Cohen’s d effect size using the pooled standard deviation
and u’s for v2 were computed.

To compare caregiver-reported irritability level at baseline and
during the 36 month follow-up observation between diagnostic
groups, a hierarchical linear model, with a random intercept and
slope, with repeated measures nested within subject (level 1), and
time and diagnostic group as ﬁxed covariates (level 2), was used.
The diagnostic group · time interaction was the key outcome, with
the coding using DMDD as the target and BP-NOS as the com-
parison. A model-based (semi) parametric bootstrap method was
used to generate 95% conﬁdence intervals based on 10,000 boot-
strap replicates.

Results

Baseline comparisons

First, demographic variables were compared between the 140
children who met criteria for DMDD and the 77 who met criteria for
BP-NOS. Signiﬁcant age and sex differences between diagnostic
groups were observed (Table 1). Children with DMDD were more
likely to be male and younger than children with BP-NOS, with
small effect sizes for both factors. There were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between groups in clinical
treatment history. When
baseline clinical characteristics were compared, children with
DMDD had lower levels of manic symptoms, but nearly double the
rate of disruptive behavior disorders, with large effect sizes for both
factors.

When speciﬁc items on the unﬁltered (i.e., rated regardless of
occurrence within a mood episode) interviewer-rated YMRS were
compared, children with DMDD averaged equal or lower scores on
every item except impaired insight; all differences were signiﬁcant
except for sexual
interest and disruptive-aggressive behavior
(Table 2). It is of note that children with DMDD had lower YMRS
irritability scores than children with BP-NOS. On the PBGI-10M,
children with DMDD received lower scores on eight of ten items
(only two of the eight reached a signiﬁcant difference) (Table 2).
The two items for which children with DMDD received an identical
or higher score both assessed irritability/rage. Participants with
DMDD did not signiﬁcantly differ from those with BP-NOS in
presence or absence of any manic symptoms in biological parents.
However, participants with DMDD were signiﬁcantly less likely
than those with BP-NOS to have a biological parent with a probable
bipolar spectrum diagnosis (19% vs. 31%, p < 0.05).

Longitudinal comparison

The distribution of scores on the Irritability Scale, which is based
on caregiver report of the child’s behavior, was approximately
normal for the two groups combined, with no outliers (Fig. 1). At
baseline, although caregivers of children with DMDD rated them
higher on irritability than caregivers of children with BP-NOS, this
did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (b = 0.51, SE = 0.48, t test =
1.07, p > 0.05) (Table 3). Irritability decreased slightly faster for the

DMDD & BP-NOS: SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES

particularly YMRS items, and tested whether rates of caregiver-
reported irritability differed between the two groups over time.
DMDD was not clearly distinguished from BP-NOS on most
comparison points other than YMRS items and rates of a probable
bipolar diagnosis in biological parents. It is of note that the YMRS
was administered in an unﬁltered manner (i.e., in a ‘‘what you see is
what you get’’ manner regardless of whether the symptoms oc-
curred within the context of a mood episode) and was not used to
make the diagnosis of DMDD or BP-NOS (for a further discussion
of this, see Yee et al. 2014).

Children with DMDD were younger and more likely to be boys.
However, these were not striking differences; average ages for both
groups were in the 9–10-year-old range and boys were the majority
of each group. Youth with DMDD were similar to those with
BP-NOS on most clinical factors, including: Number of diagnoses;
likelihood of prior hospitalization;
number of medications;
comorbid ADHD, anxiety disorders, pervasive developmental
disorders, elimination disorders, and psychosis; global impairment;
PGBI-10M; and depressive and anxiety symptom severity. Only
disruptive behavior disorders were more common in children with
DMDD, consistent with prior research (Stringaris et al. 2010; Ax-
elson et al. 2012; Towbin et al. 2013). Irritability on the parent-
reported Irritability Scale was nominally higher at baseline, but to a
nonsigniﬁcant degree, for the DMDD group compared with the BP-
NOS group, but then decreased more rapidly over time. The dif-
ference in slopes was statistically signiﬁcant, but unlikely to be
clinically meaningful. The change of a quarter point is miniscule,
given that the scale is only accurate to – -1.90 points for individual
change scores, based on the standard error of the difference score
( Jacobson and Truax 1991).

YMRS total scores and all item scores except impaired insight
(which was negligibly different between groups) were similar or
lower for children with DMDD than for children with BP-NOS.
increased motor activity, decreased
Notably, elevated mood,

impaired language/thought,
sleep, pressured speech,
content, and appearance were all more elevated in children with
BP-NOS. Even irritability on the YMRS was more severe for
children with BP-NOS. Most PGBI-10M item scores were nom-
inally lower for the children with DMDD compared to children
with BP-NOS. One item that measured irritability was identical
for the two groups; one item that assessed rage was nominally
higher for the DMDD group.

Group comparisons of caregiver-reported irritability revealed
three ﬁndings of interest. First, the groups did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly on either the level or change over time in ratings of irrita-
bility. Whereas there was a small decrement in irritability scores
over time for the DMDD group, irritability remained stable in the
BP-NOS group. Second, both groups had midrange irritability
scores of 10–12 on a 0–18 scale that remained fairly consistent over
the 3 years. Although the presence of both DMDD and BP-NOS is
disallowed per DSM-5 rules, when the subgroup who met criteria
for both diagnoses (other than the manic symptom exclusion for
DMDD) was compared on chronic irritability with those children
who had DMDD only or BP-NOS only, the DMDD plus BP-NOS
children had signiﬁcantly less decline in caregiver-reported irrita-
bility over time.

Differences in ﬁndings regarding irritability, depending upon
whether the interviewer rated presence/absence and severity in a
‘‘what you see is what you get’’ unﬁltered manner or whether
caregivers reported on their children’s behavior, are interesting.
Children with DMDD appeared less impaired than children with
BP-NOS using the former strategy, but the two groups appeared

tability levels by groups. The correlation observed between irri-
tability and YMRS total score at baseline was r = 0.07, p > 0.05.

DMDD group over the 36 month-follow up period (b = -0.24,
SE = 0.12, t test = -1.96, p = 0.0499). Trajectories for both groups
were fairly stable, in the mid-range of possible scores (Fig. 2).

As there were 27 children who fulﬁlled criteria for DMDD (other
than the bipolar symptom exclusion) and BP-NOS, we completed
one additional post-hoc comparison, comparing rates of irritability
among three groups, DMDD plus BP-NOS (n = 27), DMDD only
(n = 140) and BP-NOS only (n = 50). The DMDD plus BP-NOS and
DMDD groups had higher levels of caregiver-reported irritability at
baseline than the BP-NOS only group. The only signiﬁcant dif-
ference in slopes was between the DMDD only and DMDD plus
BP-NOS groups, with the latter group showing the slowest decline
in irritability (b = 0.38, 95% conﬁdence interval [0.02–0.74]).

Discussion

We evaluated similarities and differences between DMDD and
BP-NOS on sociodemographic and clinical variables at baseline,

Irritability trajectories over 36 months in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and bipolar disorder

similar when using caregiver report on rating scales. Perhaps the
frustration of raising a child with a disruptive behavior disorder,
which were ubiquitous in the DMDD group, leads to higher care-
giver reports of irritability, whereas interviewer-based questioning
that incorporates parent and child input as well as clinical obser-
vation during the interview, puts a greater perspective on the se-
verity of the behaviors and affect observed. This is in keeping with
previous research showing much lower rates of DMDD when di-
agnoses are based on clinical observation rather than parental self-
report (Margulies et al. 2014).

DMDD was included in the DSM-5 as a way to decrease di-
agnoses of BPSD in children. Pharmacologic management, in
particular, might differ for children with DMDD than those with
BP-NOS. Children with DMDD initially display high rates of
externalizing symptoms and comorbid disruptive behavior dis-
orders with subsequent risk for development of depressive dis-
orders, which would suggest
treatment with antidepressant
medications. Those with BP-NOS are likely to be treated with
ﬁrst-line medications for bipolar disorder. Clarifying the differ-
entiating features of DMDD and BP-NOS is, therefore, crucial
for the effective management of these disorders. Results from this
study point to cross-sectional similarities between these two di-
agnostic groups on nearly every feature except more classically
manic symptoms and family history of probable bipolar disorder
in parents. Further, the trajectory of caregiver-reported irrita-
bility over a 3 year interval does not meaningfully separate the
two groups. Therefore, it will be important for clinicians not to
use caregiver-reported chronic irritability in isolation as a reason
to consider DMDD the most appropriate diagnosis, but rather to
conduct a thorough review of symptoms and course to determine
if a child fulﬁlls criteria for DMDD, BP-NOS, or other primary
and comorbid diagnoses. In this regard, it is noteworthy that
clinicians achieved lower reliability for DMDD than for pediatric
bipolar diagnoses in the DSM-5 ﬁeld trials (Regier et al. 2012).
Semistructured approaches (Rettew et al. 2009) or checklists as a
way of augmenting the family’s description of the presenting
problem could be helpful in improving the reproducibility of

diagnoses (Croskerry 2003; Gawande 2010; Youngstrom et al.
2014).

Limitations

Several limitations of this study are important to note. The
current study utilized retroﬁtted K-SADS-PL-W responses to
determine DMDD diagnoses. Our criteria slightly modiﬁed those
previously reported in Axelson et al. (2012) to better align
with DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. The majority of LAMS study
participants were recruited because of their elevated PGBI-10M
scores, resulting in a sample with disproportionately elevated
symptoms of mania and, therefore, not fully representative of
clinical outpatient samples.

Conclusions

Despite these limitations, these ﬁndings suggest that children
with DMDD and BP-NOS are very similar on most characteristics
other than manic symptoms and a probable bipolar family history.
Even in a sample enriched with children who have elevated
symptoms of mania, DMDD outnumbers a BP-NOS diagnosis
almost 2:1.

Clinical Signiﬁcance

Clinicians will need to complete comprehensive evaluations to
appropriately diagnose children and not assume that caregiver-
reported chronic irritability leads exclusively to a DMDD diagno-
sis. Children with DMDD and BP-NOS are fraternal, not identical
twins, but they may easily confuse the casual observer.
