Introduction: Research shows that mental health-related stigma, stereotypes,
and prejudices have a negative impact on the patients themselves as well as on
their families and social entourage. Healthcare professionals, whose expertise
and professional ethos are historically acknowledged by public opinion, are
expected to play a major role in combating discrimination against psychiatric
patients. In this study, we aimed to assess the attitudes of Greek healthcare
professionals toward mental illness and people suffering from it.

Materials and methods: It is a non-interventional, analytic study, in which 479
health workers from a tertiary hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece, participated.
Every single hospital service –except the personnel of the Psychiatric Clinic–
was included in our study: from the cleaning service to the administrative staff
and the auxiliary staff such as stretcher carriers, food and nutrition services’
staff, and social workers, the nursing staff, and ﬁnally the attending physicians,
taking into consideration that the psychiatric patient, from the moment he/she
enters the hospital, consecutively gets in contact with every work grade of
the healthcare establishment. Participants’ attitudes concerning mental illness
have been evaluated using the Opinions about Mental Illness Scale (OMI), the
Social Distance Scale (SDS), and the Level of Contact Report (LCR-12).

Results: Despite the high level of familiarity [as evaluated with LCR-12; mean
score (µ): 8.82 ± 1.73], the employees displayed a rather poor willingness
to interact with psychiatric patients (as measured with SDS; µ:11.68 ± 4.28),
and endorsed signiﬁcant prejudice toward individuals with mental disorders
(assessed using OMI subscales; Social Discrimination µ: 22.99 ± 12.08, Social
Restriction µ: 17.45 ± 9.07, Social Care µ: 21.04 ± 4.12, Social Integration

as the main determinants of participants’ attitudes, with younger and highly
educated participants to have shown a relatively reﬁned proﬁle.

Conclusion: These results are not signiﬁcantly improved compared to those
of previous decades in Greek healthcare professionals and call for critical
reﬂection and targeted stigma-reduction efforts.

Introduction

The word "stigma" comes from the Greek verb "στíζω"
(stizo) which means "to mark with a scar" (1), and has had,
almost
timelessly and universally, a negative meaning. In
Ancient Greece, slaves were stigmatized, to be distinguished as
the lowest in the social hierarchy (2). As Plato quoted in The
Laws (page 854d), ‘if anyone is captured performing blasphemy,
if he be a slave or a foreigner, let his felony be marked on his
visage and his palms.’

According to the American Psychiatric Association’s
Dictionary of Psychology, stigma is deﬁned as the dismissive
social attitude attached to a feature of an individual that may be
considered as a psychiatric, corporal, or communal inadequacy.
Stigma involves social disapprobation and can gradually result
in unjustiﬁed discrimination and rejection (3).

Researchers today categorize mental health-related stigma
into three diﬀerent types: (a) social (public) stigma which
involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others

is more systemic and involves policies of government and
private organizations that
intentionally or unintentionally
limit opportunities for the psychiatric patients. Examples of
such approaches favoring mental health-related stigma include
lower funding for mental illness research as well as poorer
access to mental health services compared to other healthcare
services (4).

Social stigma that accompanies mental illness has a long-
lasting tradition (5) and has been recognized as a serious
obstacle to requesting help from mental health professionals
(6). Due to mental health stigma, patients face many negative
social consequences. Of all groups with chronic conditions
or disabilities, they are one of the most unlikely to obtain
employment (7), be in a secure and long-lasting relationship
(8), have a proper housing (9), and ﬁnally experience social
they often undergo social
integration (10). Furthermore,

seclusion, experiencing poor self-conﬁdence and internalized
pessimistic thoughts (11).

Social campaigns help to expose these issues as well as
to relieve the arising concerns and currently many people
identify stigma as a problem (12, 13). Unfortunately, disfavoring
opinions still exist, urging mental health patients to refrain from
treatment, ﬁnally resulting to the worsening of their condition
(14, 15).

Public stigma remains a crucial issue also for Greek society.
Research examining the existence of mental health-related
stigma in the Greek culture showed that Greek citizens carry
medium-high level of authoritarian attitudes (the opinion that
psychiatric patients are inferior) and a moderate level of social
restrictiveness (the opinion that they should be secluded and
attentively monitored in the community), despite their high
degree of sympathy toward them (16). This ﬁnding is in
concordance with previous studies, as well (17–19).

Additionally, despite the modern psychiatric reform,
stigmatization phenomena are still observed among Greek
healthcare providers. A survey conducted in a provincial
hospital in Greece revealed that health professionals, although
being more conﬁdent about the competencies of the psychiatric
patients, appear to be biased, conﬁrming that the stigma
of mental illness still exists (20). Some previous researchers
have reported that younger age, less authoritarian personality
characteristics, as well as higher educational and familiarity
levels are associated with more positive attitudes toward
psychiatric patients among health professionals, while doctors
appear to carry fewer stigmatizing notions than other healthcare
workers (21) and nurses display contradictory tendencies
(22, 23).

Furthermore, in a study conducted in Greek psychiatric
rehabilitation centers, health professionals appeared less
disposed to adopt a positive attitude toward the treatment of
mental illness, to propose amelioration of the oﬀered services’
quality, and to motivate the patients for equal presence and
inclusion in the community (24). In a recent study, Greek
mental health professionals appeared willing to keep a social
distance from people with serious mental disorders, while

negative attitudes emerged, including futility of rehabilitation
and considering patients as divergent (25). In another study
examining Greek mental health professionals’ opinions
about psychiatric patients, some stereotypical opinions were
documented regarding treatment duration, perceptions of
psychiatric patients, and ﬁnally probability of recovery (26).

All health professionals are required to treat every patient
with the utmost care and understanding, as they are invited
to oﬀer their services to individuals who are in a state of
vulnerability due to their health condition. Especially regarding
persons with mental disorders, health professionals have an
additional duty to contribute decisively to the reduction
of discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudices against them,
both within their professions and society. Firstly, due to the
historically signiﬁcant role that their professions played in
the exclusion of these patients from society and secondly
because they are perceived by the public as “experts” on
these individuals, and their accounts are likely to be believed
and respected among members of the general public (27–29).
Nevertheless, recent ﬁndings support that health –and mental
health- professionals should realize and specify their role to
a supporting one, by taking a step back and allowing the
psychiatric patients to lead this ﬁght, and focus on decisively
amplifying these eﬀorts (30). Our study seeks to make an
approximate measurement of
the presence and degree of
stigmatization in the care and the reception of psychiatric
patients among the major groups of health professionals
in our hospital.

Materials and methods

Study design

This is a non-interventional, analytic study,

in which
479 employees from “Papageorgiou” General Hospital of
Thessaloniki, Greece, participated. “Papageorgiou” General
Hospital is a Private Legal Non-proﬁt Entity, established in
1999, in the western part of Thessaloniki, providing preventive
care, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation services as well as
inpatient and outpatient services. It is fully integrated within the
Hellenic National Health System and is on duty according to the
on-call schedule of Thessaloniki’s hospitals. The installation of
university clinics in 2004 has completed in the best way by the
Hospital’s personnel, which has been in constant collaboration
with the Aristotle University School of Medicine from that
time. According to the hospital’s recorded statistics for 2021,
“Papageorgiou” Hospital employs a total of 1.871 individuals;
562 doctors, 924 nurses, and 385 other staﬀ members (31).

After the approval of the study protocol by the Institutional
Review Board of “Papageorgiou” General Hospital, the directors
of every working unit were informed about and consented
to the distribution of the questionnaires to the employees.

level of

The personnel of the Hospital’s Psychiatric Clinic (doctors,
nurses, psychologists, special educators, speech therapists) were
purposely excluded, taking into consideration their speciﬁc
familiarity with
training, as well as the diﬀerent
mental disorders, and their exposure to psychiatric patients
in more acute and diﬃcult phases. Their exclusion does
not assume that they necessarily have improved or worse
attitudes, but we considered them as a speciﬁc population
that would be better examined separately, as a topic of a
diﬀerent study. The purpose of the current research is the
evaluation of attitudes toward psychiatric patients from the
very ﬁrst moment they enter the hospital as common citizens,
irrespective of whether their altered mental state is known or
not (another diﬀerence with the psychiatric department, where
the presence of mental disorder for the inpatients or outpatients
is given or implied).

Sociodemographic questionnaire

Participants were asked to provide anonymous demographic
information on their age, gender, family status, education,
work experience, and profession. Regarding work experience,
the following clariﬁcation must be made: the ﬁeld was not
limited to the experience gained in the studied hospital, but
in general. This implies that some professional categories
(such as administrative or auxiliary staﬀ) may have worked in
diﬀerent environments before, probably with a diﬀerent level of
interaction with patients.

Opinion about mental illness scale (OMI)

They were also given the Opinions about mental illness
scale (OMI) (32). The OMI scale was initially developed by
Cohen and Struening in 1959 to evaluate the beliefs of healthcare
workers regarding mental disease. The present structure of the
OMI scale -which was derived from extensive factor analysis
of its initial form of 200 items by more than 8,000 people
experienced in mental health- includes 51 declarations displayed
via a 6-point Likert-type scale (33). Answers vary from 1 (Fully

Agree) to 6 (Fully Disagree). Factor analysis of the 51 items
revealed the following ﬁve subscales: Factor A: Authoritarianism
(A, 11 items): the opinion that people with a mental illness
cannot be held accountable for their acts, and that they should
be controlled by society, Factor B: Unsophisticated Benevolence
(UB, 14 items): an attitude that could be placed between
tolerance and pity/compassion; Factor C: Mental Hygiene
Ideology (MHI, 9 items): the opinion that mental illness is
similar to other illnesses, and that it should receive adequate
treatment by specialists; Factor D: Social Restrictiveness (SR, 10
items): the opinion that psychiatric patients should be restricted
in some social domains, and Factor E: Interpersonal Etiology
(IE, 9 items): the belief that the real cause of a mental illness can
be found in problematic interpersonal relations (32, 33).

The Greek OMI version (Supplementary Table 1),
standardized for the Greek population by Madianos et al. (17),
follows a modiﬁed evaluative scheme (Supplementary Table 2),
which stresses the following ﬁve factors:

• Factor 1: Social Discrimination (SD, 16 items): this factor
refers to the distinguishing characteristics of psychiatric
patients, who are mainly portrayed as inferior individuals
compared to those considered as “normal.” It also includes
a latent belief that patients suﬀering from mental illness
need to be treated in an authoritarian way. Example items:
“There is something about mental patients that makes it
easy to tell them from normal people,” “Psychiatric patients
let their emotions rule them while normal individuals think
about what to do,” “Although patients discharged from
mental hospitals may seem all right, they should not be
allowed to marry.”

• Factor 2: Social Restriction (SR, 13 items): It represents the
tendency that preventive measures should be taken by the
society regarding psychiatric patients. It involves dismissive
and compulsive notions about sanctions during or after a
psychiatric hospitalization. Example items: “There is little
that can be done for patients in a mental hospital except to
see that they are comfortable and well fed,” “Anyone who is
in a hospital for a mental illness should not be allowed to
vote,” “All patients in mental hospitals should be prevented
from having children by a painless operation.”

regarding the treatment

• Factor 3: Social Care (SC, eight items): This factor includes
positive opinions
ideology,
suggesting amelioration of quality of care and social
support. Example items: “Our mental hospitals should be
organized in a way to make the patient feel as much as
possible as if he is living in his home,” “Psychiatric patients
who cannot work because of their mental illness should be
given money to live on.”

• Factor 4: Social

Integration (SI, eight

items): This
one depicts the need to encourage equality in social
participation and inclusion of psychiatric patients in every
aspect of life in the community. Example items: “Many

psychiatric patients are capable of skilled work, even if they
are somehow mentally disturbed,” “Most people in mental
hospitals are not dangerous.”

• Factor 5: Etiology (E, six items): This factor refers to the
conceptions about the etiology of mental illness, expressing
a tendency to attribute that to the patients’ family. Example
items: “If the children of mentally ill parents were raised by
normal parents, they would probably not become mentally
ill,” “Mental patients come from homes where the parents
took little interest in their children.”

For every factor, the ﬁnal score is derived by summarizing
the scores of all the items included and subtracting them from
a constant number. Higher scores indicate that the respondent
leans more toward the attitude expressed by each factor (23).
More speciﬁcally, higher scores for factors 1, 2, and 5 indicate
more stigmatizing and stereotypical attitudes, whereas higher
scores for factors 3 and 4 express more favorable perceptions
toward mental illness and patients suﬀering from it.

and students (23, 37–39).

Social distance scale (SDS)

Participants were also given the social distance scale (SDS)
(40, 41), which consists of seven items (Supplementary Table 3),
answered using a 4-point Likert-type scale. Example items:
“How willing would you feel to recommend a mentally ill person
for a job to someone you know?”, “How willing would you feel
to have a mentally ill person take care of your children?” Options
for the Greek version that was used vary between 0 (Absolutely
Unwilling) and 3 (Absolutely Willing) (42), but the scores were
reversed in the statistical analysis, in order to be comparable
with the results from the international literature. Total scale
scores range between 0 and 21, by summing the individual
scores of all responses. This scale measures the social distance
the interviewee wants to keep toward a person with a particular
condition; in the present study, it measures the distance the
hospital staﬀ wants to keep from mental health patients (42, 43),
with higher scores representing a greater desire to do so.

Level of contact report (LCR-12)

The last questionnaire participants were given was the level
of contact report (LCR-12), which is a scale developed by
Holmes et al. (43, 44). It is a psychometric self-report test that
measures familiarity with mental disorder. LCR-12 consists of
12 phrases/answers (Supplementary Table 4), each one of which
corresponds to a speciﬁc score (from 1 to 12), depending on

the ascending degree of familiarity with mental illness that it
represents (45). Example items: “I have never observed a person
that I was aware had a mental illness” (rank order score 1), “I
have watched a movie or television show in which a character
depicted a person with mental illness” (score 3), “I have a mental
illness” (score 12). Regarding the completion of the scale, the
respondent can choose 1 or more of the 12 statements, in case
he/she has experienced them before (23, 44). The ﬁnal score
of each participant is equal to his/her answer with the highest
score, that is, of the one representing the highest degree of
familiarity (44, 46).

For all questionnaires, the validated Greek version was used

(17, 23, 42).

Statistical analysis

Data were evaluated for deviations from normality by
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Comparison of means scores at
OMI subscales (Social Discrimination, Social Restriction, Social
Care, Social Integration, and Etiology), SDS, and LCR between
categories in sex (male vs. female), age in years [(a) <30, (b) 31–
40, (c) 41–50, (d) 51–60, (e) >60], profession [(f) Physicians,
(g) Nurses, (h) Administrative employees – including social
workers, (i) Stretcher-carriers, (j) Cleaning services, (k) Food-

experience [(w) 5 years, (x) 5–15, (y) 16–20, (z) 21–26, (@)
>26] were performed with parametric tests in case of normal
distribution (t-test, ANOVA). Otherwise, non-parametric tests
were applied (Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis
test). In case of statistical signiﬁcance, post hoc analyses were
carried out, to identify demographic diﬀerences between speciﬁc
groups. The same analysis was performed for items 4, 24, 29, 41,
and 51 of the OMI scale. Cronbach’s alpha was also calculated
in each subscale of OMI, and SDS and LCR scales to assess
the inﬂuence of each one on the subscale’s internal consistency.
Spearman’s correlation was performed to assess the relationship
between subscales of OMI, SDS, and LCR. A signiﬁcance level
of < 0.05 was used for all analyses.

Results

Sample characteristics

In total, 479 subjects were recruited and stratiﬁed based
on gender: 70.6% female, 29.4% male; age: 19.3% < 30 years,
24.3% 31–40 years, 32.5% 41–50 years, 23.4% 51–60 years,

0.6% > 60 years; occupational status: 25.9% physicians, 40.0%
nurses, 7.7% administrative employees, and 5.4% stretcher-
carriers, 1.0% cleaning services’ staﬀ, 7.9% food and nutrition
services’ staﬀ and 11.9% other professions; family status: 56.9%
married, 6.4% divorced, 1.0% widowers, 14.6% in relationship,
and 21.1% single; education level: 30.2% SE graduate, 22.0%
HEI, 26.0% TEI, 17.8% MSc, 4.0% Ph.D. and years of work
experience: 27.0% < 5 years, 31.6% 5–15 years, 20.5% 16–
20 years, 12.1% 21–26 years, 8.8% > 26 years. Detailed sample
characteristics are presented at Supplementary Table 5.

Cronbach’s alpha

The internal consistency was excellent (>0.7) for the
items of Social Discrimination and Restriction OMI’s subscales
and SDS, acceptable (0.689) for the items of Etiology, and
unsatisfactory for the items of Social Care (0.568), Social
Integration (0.564), and LCR (0.594).

Comparison of OMI subscales

Results are presented in Supplementary Table 6.

Social discrimination (SD)

Analysis for mean scores regarding Social Discrimination
revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for
the Social Discrimination based on sex. Statistically signiﬁcant
associations were found for age, profession,
family status,
education, and years of work experience, with lower (less
discriminative) scores for the <30 years, physicians, those
in a relationship,
those with MSc, and those with less
than 5 years of work experience. Nevertheless, all groups
demonstrated moderate levels of discriminative attitudes (with
their answers varying between “probable agreement” and
“probable disagreement” with the given notions), while the
aforementioned groups barely stood out in a more positive way.

Social restriction (SR)

Analysis for mean scores regarding Social Restriction
revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores
for the Social Restriction based on sex, family status, and
work experience. Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found
for age, profession, and education, with lower(less restrictive)
scores for the 31–40 years, physicians, and those with MSc.
However, the majority of all groups (except those > 50 years,
auxiliary staﬀ other than administrative personnel, secondary
school graduates, widowers, and employees of > 26 years work
experience) showed a more distinct disapproval of the restrictive
measures considering their mean scores, even though standard
deviations remained considerable.

Social care (SC)

Analysis for mean scores regarding Social Care revealed no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for the Social
Care based on sex, and family status. Statistically signiﬁcant
associations were found for age, profession, education, years
of work experience with lower (less supporting) scores to be
for the <30 years, physicians, those with a Ph.D. and less
than 5 years of work experience. This factor is considered
to be the one with the most positive impact and greatest
accordance among the respondents, as all groups showed
distinct positive attitudes toward the need for amelioration of
the providence for psychiatric patients (mean scores within the
spectrum of “agreement” with the items included), while those
with work experience > 26 years crossed the barrier to more
deﬁnite and positive “waters” (spectrum of “full agreement”
with the items), and the stretcher-carriers, other auxiliary staﬀ,
those > 51 years old and widowers almost came close, as
well. It should be highlighted that in this factor we observe a
reversal in the classiﬁcation of the age-professional-educational
and work experience groups, compared to the order shown in
the other factors.

Social integration (SI)

Analysis for mean scores regarding Social Integration
revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for
the Social Integration based on sex, age, and work experience.
Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found for profession,
family status, and education, with higher scores (more positive
attitudes toward psychiatric patients) to be found in physicians,
widowers, and those with Ph.D. Nonetheless, all groups were
reluctant to express a positive opinion (mean scores within the
spectrum of “rather agree” with the items included). The only
group that managed to score higher (within the spectrum that
expresses “agreement”) were those > 60 years old, who represent
a mere 0.6% of the sample.

Etiology (E)

Analysis for mean scores regarding Etiology revealed
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for the
family status, and years of work
Etiology based on sex,
experience. Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found for
age, profession, and education, with lower scores (equivalent
to less stereotypical attitudes) for the <30 years, physicians,
and those with MSc. The mean scores of all groups revealed
the participants’ ambivalence, as they ranged at medium levels
(expressing “probable agreement” or “probable disagreement” to
the stereotypical notions mentioned).

Comparison of SDS

Analysis for mean scores regarding SDS revealed no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for the SDS

based on sex and work experience. Statistically signiﬁcant
associations were found for age, profession, family status, and
education, with lower scores—depicting greater willingness to
associate with psychiatric patients—for the <30, administrative
staﬀ, those in relationship, and those with MSc. The mean scores
of all groups were found within the spectrum of “probable
unwillingness,” while administrative staﬀ and MSc holders
managed to enter into the next—but still unsatisfactory—zone
of “probable willingness” to interact with psychiatric patients,
with the rest of the groups mentioned above coming quite
close. Regarding the individual items, respondents appeared
more receptive to having a neighbor with mental illness or
introducing a patient to their friends, while they were more
negative about having a psychiatric patient as the caretaker or
spouse of their children, or as a housemate. Results are presented
in Supplementary Tables 3, 6.

Comparison of LCR

Analysis for mean scores regarding LCR revealed no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for the
LCR based on sex, age, family status, and work experience.
Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found for profession

and food-nutrition services’ staﬀ, those in relationship, and
those with MSc or Ph.D. Respondents appeared more aware
and displayed greater sensitivity in this questionnaire, with
mean scores of all groups (apart from “other” staﬀ – mean
score: 7.70) being over 8.29, where “8” stands for the question
“My job involves providing services/treatment for persons
with a mental illness,” while the items rated higher than that
refer to friends/relatives/family/oneself with mental illness. It is
remarkable that 72.7% consider providing services to psychiatric
patients as part of their job, 40.1% admitted that a relative of
theirs suﬀers from a mental disorder (item rated as 10), while
5.5% declared that they themselves suﬀer from a mental illness
(highest degree of contact report according to LCR: 12). Results
are presented in Supplementary Tables 4, 6. Characteristics and
opinions of those who selected the high-scoring items of LCR
are reported separately in Supplementary Table 7.

correlated with SDS, that is, less stereotyped opinions about the
causes of mental illness are associated with greater readiness
to interact with them, as well as the reverse. Social Integration
was positively correlated with LCR and negatively correlated
with SDS, which indicates that greater familiarity with and
desire to connect with psychiatric patients is associated with
a more supportive ideological stance toward them, regarding
their equal social participation, and vice versa. Social Care
was negatively correlated with SDS, which means that higher
willingness to interact with mental patients corresponds to
a higher desire for social support and improved provisions
for them, and the opposite conclusion as well. Finally,
SDS was negatively correlated with LCR, that is,
level of
familiarity is directly proportional to willingness to associate
with mental patients. Results are presented in Supplementary
Table 8.

Comparison of selected items 4, 24,
29, 41, and 51 of OMI scale

The following questions were selected to be separately
described, due to their speciﬁc weight in capturing stigmatizing
and more problematic attitudes. Results are presented in
Supplementary Table 9.

Item 4

“Even if psychiatric patients may seem to be okay, they
should not be allowed to get married”. It is included in the
social discrimination factor. Analysis for mean scores regarding
Item 4 revealed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores
for the Item 4 based on sex, age, profession, family status,
education, and years of work experience, with higher scores
(less authoritarian) for males, <30 years, physicians, those in
relationship, those that graduated from HEI, and those with less
than 5 years of work experience.

Item 24

“It would be foolish for a woman to marry a man who
once had a serious mental illness, even if he appeared to be
fully mentally restored”. It belongs to social discrimination
items. Analysis for mean scores regarding Item 24 revealed no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for Item 24
based on sex. Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found
for age, profession, family status, education, years of work
experience with lower (more discriminative) scores for the
<30 years, physicians, in relationship, those that graduated from
HEI, and with less than 5 years of work experience.

Item 29

“Anyone who is hospitalized in a psychiatric unit should not
be allowed to vote”. It is included among the items of social
restriction factor. Analysis for mean scores regarding Item 29

revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for
Item 29 based on sex, age, family status, and work experience.
Statistically signiﬁcant associations were found for profession
and education, with higher scores (expressing less restrictive
attitudes) for the administrative employees, and those with MSc.

Item 41

“Most women who have been hospitalized in a psychiatric
unit should be trusted to look after children”. It constitutes
one of the social integration items. Analysis for mean scores
regarding Item 41 revealed no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
family status,
in mean scores for Item 41 based on age,
and work experience. Statistically signiﬁcant associations were
found for sex, profession, and education with lower scores
(more favorable attitudes) for males, administrative employees,
and those with PhD.

Item 51

“All patients in psychiatric units should be prevented from
having children with sterilization”. It is indicative of social
restriction items. Analysis for mean scores regarding Item 51
revealed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in mean scores for
Item 51 based on sex, age, profession, family status, education,
and years of work experience, with higher scores (representing
less restrictive notions) for males, those 31–40 years, physicians,
in relationship, those with MSc, and less than 5 years of
work experience.

Presentation of the OMI items with the
extreme mean scores and standard
deviations

Mean scores and standard deviations for every item of OMI
are presented in Supplementary Table 1. In Tables 1, 2, the
items that stood out in the total sample—either by their mean
score or their standard deviation—are presented.

As shown above, respondents expressed more absolute
opinions in favor of mental health patients,
in matters of
social care (agreement with the items, expressed by low mean
scores) and social restriction (disagreement with the items,
expressed by high mean scores), whereas their answers also
converged regarding the previous two factors (expressed by low
standard deviations).

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to assess the attitudes of
health professionals at “Papageorgiou” General Hospital toward
mental illness and people suﬀering from it. “Papageorgiou”
General Hospital is a fully equipped tertiary healthcare facility,
located in and providing services to Thessaloniki – the largest

Sometimes mental illness is a punishment for bad deeds.

Being hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic is tantamount to failing in real life.

city in Northern Greece, and the second largest city in the
country. Furthermore, it includes a psychiatric ward, where
inpatients come into contact with non-psychiatric health
professionals in a variety of ways: e.g., when food is transferred
to them, their rooms are cleaned, they are carried to other
departments for diagnostic tests or examinations for physical
symptoms that may occur, and when they receive useful services
from social workers and other administrative staﬀ. As a result,
there is a greater level of contact between other healthcare
specialties and psychiatric patients, in comparison with other
hospitals without a psychiatric department. Therefore, it is of
special interest to study the type and extent of the stigmatizing
opinions and beliefs held by healthcare professionals that work
in the other departments of “Papageorgiou” General Hospital
toward people suﬀering from mental disorders.

Greek studies from the last decades indicate that, after the
drastic changes and modernization of mental health services
since the 1980s (47, 48), there has been distinct progress in the
attitudes of the general population and healthcare professionals
toward mental illness. However, it seems that this progress has
continued to move along at the very slow pace of the still "under-
construction" mental health reform that remains incomplete
(18, 48, 49). This discrepancy with the quick development in
many other areas of modern society and human needs poses a
great challenge to the Greek society.

Overall, our study describes a certain degree of positive
attitudes toward psychiatric patients among healthcare workers
at our institution. However, it also documents that a higher

grade of familiarity and interaction with people suﬀering from
mental illness (as indicated by the high LCR scores in our
study) does not guarantee by itself the development of adequate
favorable opinions toward those patients.

In the following section, we describe the speciﬁc features
of stigmatization carried out by each group of healthcare
professionals and identify areas for possible intervention.
Regarding the diﬀerent groups of healthcare professionals, we
observe that:

• Even though there was a diﬀerence between the size of
the female and male samples, sex did not aﬀect any of the
examined factors.

• Family status did not result

• Years of work experience resulted in statistical diﬀerences
only with regard to Social Discrimination, while the
positive attitudes of those working for more than 26 years
regarding Social Care stood out among all groups.

• Younger participants (<40 years old) showed a more
favorable attitude to mental illness in the ﬁelds of Social
Distance, Social Restriction, Etiology, and willingness to
interact with patients. No statistical diﬀerences based on
age were found regarding Social Integration, while Social
Care was the only sector where people older than 40 years
appeared more supportive.

• Education played a consistent role in all examined factors
except for Social Care (alongside “age”). More speciﬁcally,
as higher educational
increases, attitudes toward
mental illness become more and more favorable. We should
mention the exception of Ph.D. holders, who do not
follow precisely the previous rule, probably given that they
were a small sample.

level

• With respect to profession, physicians and administrative
staﬀ presented more deﬁcits regarding Social Care. On the
other hand, the staﬀ of the auxiliary services showed greater
sensitivity in terms of Social Care, with signiﬁcant deﬁcits
in other ﬁelds. It is notable that nurses—that is, the largest
group—did not stand out in any of the examined factors
and were always bridging the—rather small—gap between
the other groups.

Summarizing our results, we can conclude that a high
level of contact with patients suﬀering from mental illness
is not necessarily associated with the suﬃcient willingness
to interact with those patients, nor does it reduce decisively
the existing prejudices. This ﬁnding is consistent with other
studies indicating that contact with people suﬀering from
mental disorders could be of help under speciﬁc conditions,
such as interacting with individuals who are not in the acute
phase, in a frame that endorses companionship (between peers
considered as equal) and includes common goals and joint
eﬀorts (50). In a healthcare environment,
it is of critical
importance to be able to observe the long-term eﬀect of
treatment on psychiatric patients, instead of interacting with
those not receiving appropriate mental support, remaining
unwell, and spreading a sense of hopelessness (51).

respondents

Overall, most of our

showed a rather
paternalistic, but sympathetic view of psychiatric patients, which
reﬂects a certain degree of favorable attitudes toward them.
This ﬁnding is supported by other studies, which have shown
that when it comes to society’s attitudes toward mental health
patients, charitable views tend to prevail and the responsibility
to provide the best possible care is recognized by a large majority
(52, 53).

Of course, our study has certain limitations:

– We report results from a single hospital with speciﬁc
features, as mentioned above. Nevertheless, we claim that
it constitutes a random sample of the Greek National
Health System. The hospital staﬀ is recruited with the
same criteria that are used for the whole public sector.
Furthermore, there are no reports from the literature that
state contrary ﬁndings.

– Some caution is also warranted, as diﬀerent healthcare
professions were not equally distributed in the sample
population. Age distribution among these groups was
not equal, as auxiliary staﬀ (food services’ staﬀ, stretcher–
carriers, and cleaning services)
consists mainly of
employees older than 40 years old, with a lower education
level. Finally, subjects aged over 60 years old, Ph.D. and
widowers constitute small groups, and their results should
be assessed cautiously.

– The sample includes employees that might have previously
worked in diﬀerent sectors, such as the administrative
and auxiliary staﬀ. However, their potential diﬀerence
in previous working experience was not captured by
the questionnaires, and this could have been a factor
leading to a diﬀerentiation in attitudes toward psychiatric
patients, in comparison with those with experience solely
in the health sector.

– The exact response rate was not possible to be determined,
due to the way the questionnaires were distributed
and recollected.

– Diﬀering from other studies, the staﬀ of the psychiatric

clinic was excluded (22, 23).

– The research took place during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Thus, we were unable to assess whether personal health
concerns, anxiety, and professional fatigue inﬂuenced the
employees’ responses.

Taken together, our results show that physicians and
administrative staﬀ—despite the fact that the latter may have
possible previous work experience in diﬀerent sectors and the
former might be able to claim to work more often and more
closely with patients—did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly with regard to
the majority of the examined factors. The same holds true for
the auxiliary staﬀ (stretcher–carriers, food services, and cleaning
services staﬀ). We cautiously conclude that age and educational
level are the main determinants aﬀecting health professionals’
attitudes toward mental illness. This ﬁnding is consistent with
other studies as well (17–19, 23). Moreover, it is promising for
the new generations and it also opens a perspective for intensive
educational eﬀorts aiming at the amelioration of health workers’
attitude toward mental illness.

Possible implications of our study

The results of our study are of clinical, educational, and

research interest.

Despite an impressive amount of positive attitudes toward
patients with mental illness, our study detects a signiﬁcant
degree of stigmatization among healthcare workers of all
professions, although with diﬀerences between the distinct
subgroups. In clinical practice, the presence of prejudiced
notions could negatively aﬀect the way that people suﬀering
from mental illness are treated during their hospitalization.

Regarding future research, it could be very interesting if
staﬀ ’s attitudes were reevaluated after the implementation of
an educative program, in order to detect any diﬀerentiations
and assess the followed procedure. Moreover, the undergraduate
students’ attitudes could be measured and compared to those
of the respective working groups, in order to examine whether
younger generations are more romantic and show greater
understanding, or whether they are indiﬀerent and ignorant (69,
70). Furthermore, possible diﬀerences due to the age gap raise
the question of whether daily clinical reality impacts negatively
the personnel, or instead leads to an increased level of empathy.
Also, it is of interest whether the changes in attitudes are due
to greater exposure to mental illness or to professional burnout
(51). In addition, the attitudes of the employees working in

the primary and secondary health care sector (where there is
greater familiarity with the patients) could be assessed and
compared with our results. The authors are currently running
a study on stigmatizing beliefs in medical students and primary
healthcare practitioners.

Taking into consideration that the level of a civilization is
indicated by the attitude of society toward its most vulnerable
and least favorable members, people suﬀering from mental
disorders should hold a special place in society’s heart and
social policy. In a country that has undergone rapid changes
in the past decades, stigmatization phenomena stemming
from lack of awareness and education should be fought.
Even though the presented numbers demonstrate a level
of amelioration in terms of discrimination, restriction, and
etiology, compared to those of previous decades (17–19, 21–
23), these changes are insuﬃcient. Numbers call for action,
human lives call for understanding, and societies and especially
health professionals should remain alert. The Greek health and
mental health system’s reform should concentrate not only on
the improvement of materials, techniques, and infrastructures,
but equally aim at the improvement and reﬁnement of ways
and attitudes when providing services to each patient. Even
though asylums like Leros are now a thing of the past (47, 71),
many actions are still required (48, 72) to replace the ﬂawed
present depicted in our study with a future characterized by a
decisively positive attitude toward mental illness and the people
suﬀering from it.
