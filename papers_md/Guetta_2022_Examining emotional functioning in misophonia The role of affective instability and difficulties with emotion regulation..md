Abstract

Misophonia is a newly described condition characterized by sensory and emotional reactiv-
ity (e.g., anxiety, anger, disgust) to repetitive, pattern-based sounds (e.g., throat clearing,
chewing, slurping). Individuals with misophonia report significant functional impairment and
interpersonal distress. Growing research indicates ineffective coping and emotional func-
tioning broadly (e.g., affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation) are central to the
clinical presentation and severity of misophonia. Preliminary evidence suggests an associa-
tion between negative emotionality and deficits in emotion regulation in misophonia. Still, lit-
tle is known about (a) the relationships among specific components of emotional functioning
(e.g., emotion regulation, affective lability) with misophonia, and (b) which component(s) of
misophonia (e.g., noise frequency, emotional and behavioral responses, impairment) are
associated with emotional functioning. Further, despite evidence that mood and anxiety dis-
orders co-occur with misophonia, investigation thus far has not controlled for depression
and anxiety symptoms. Examination of these relationships will help inform treatment devel-
opment for misophonia. The present study begins to disambiguate the relationships among
affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation, and components of misophonia. A sam-
ple of 297 participants completed questionnaires assessing misophonia, emotional function-
ing, depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact. Findings indicated that misophonia severity
was positively associated with each of these constructs with small to medium effect sizes.
When controlling for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact, results from this prelimi-
nary study suggest that (a) difficulties with emotion regulation may be correlated with miso-
phonia severity, and (b) misophonic responses, not number of triggers or perceived
severity, are associated with difficulties with emotion regulation. Overall, these findings
begin to suggest that emotion regulation is important to our understanding the risk factors
and treatment targets for misophonia.

Emotional functioning in misophonia

Introduction

Misophonia is a newly described sound intolerance condition characterized by atypical sen-
sory over-responsivity and emotional reactivity to repetitive, pattern-based sounds. These trig-
ger sounds are typically human-produced oral or nasal noises (e.g., throat clearing, chewing,
slurping), can be environmentally produced (e.g., pen clicking, clock ticking, [1, 2]), and are
not attributable to aversive acoustic features such as volume or pitch [3]. The intensity, uncon-
trollability, and disproportionality of emotional reactions to trigger sounds is expressed across
a range of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety, disgust; [3]). Common behavioral responses
include glaring at or mimicking the person producing the sound, verbal aggression, and infre-
quent physical aggression [4], all of which adversely impact interpersonal functioning. Recent
research suggests that distress from trigger noises may be influenced by context. For example,
many people with misophonia report more intense reactions when the sound is produced by
family members and loved ones, or in contexts where the noises are deemed socially inappro-
priate (e.g., chewing with one’s mouth open, pen-clicking in an exam setting [4, 5], highlight-
ing the importance of context in both the perception of and response to triggers. In additional
to interpersonal aggression and conflict, escape and avoidance behavior functions to prevent
exposure and distress associated with misophonic cues. Such intolerance and avoidance of
possible triggering contexts (i.e., family meals and restaurants, certain workplaces; [1, 4]) may
maintain misophonic distress and, over time, lead to diminished capabilities with confidence
and capability coping or regulating emotions.

Misophonia, as currently assessed using self-reported and clinical interview measures (e.g.,
[6, 7]), can be operationalized using a tripartite symptom presentation: (a) presence of bother-
some sounds and related sensory cues (i.e., visual stimuli related to the sounds, such as seeing
someone chewing from afar in the absence of hearing chewing); (b) heightened physiological,
affective, and cognitive distress with accompanying behavioral reactions in response to one (or
more) of the auditory and visual cues; and (c) associated impairment in work, academic, or
social functioning. As such, emotions (conceptualized as including physiological, cognitive,
and behavioral responses in order to fulfill context-dependent needs [8]); and the way in
which emotions are experienced and managed are central to the clinical presentation and
severity of misophonia.

Emotions are typically managed through emotion regulation: the ability to both automati-
cally and consciously apply sets of strategies that influence emotional experience, intensity, and
expression [9]. Successful emotion regulation, given the reported intensity of negative emotions
in the face of aversive auditory and related stimuli, is essential to adaptive coping and manage-
ment of misophonia. Chronic dysregulated emotions, particularly in the moments of being acti-
vated by triggers, can exacerbate overall impairment and subjective distress. Individuals with
misophonia may attempt to disengage from the aversive stimuli and associated internal experi-
ences via escape or avoidance. These strategies, while effective in the short-term to ease contact
with the discomfort, are ineffective over time among emotional disorders broadly [10–12]. For
example, dysregulated anger or disgust in response to misophonic sounds could result in
repeated avoidance of interpersonal situations leading to isolation and loneliness, thereby con-
tributing to impairment caused by misophonia. Although speculative, difficulties with emotion
regulation may have an important role in the development, maintenance, and treatment of mis-
ophonia. To date, however, very little scientific research has been conducted in this area.

Preliminary evidence suggests that emotion regulation deficits mediate the relationship
between trait neuroticism, negative affect, and misophonia [13]. These findings suggest that a
reciprocal relationship between the tendency to frequently experience intense emotions and
deficits in emotion regulation may confer risk for development and maintenance of

misophonia. However, this study was preliminary, limited by small sample size, and did not
control for the presence of other emotional problems that are known to co-occur with miso-
phonia (i.e., depression, anxiety [14, 15]. As such, the relationship between emotion regulation
and misophonia needs to be replicated and clarified in larger samples.

Furthermore, emotional functioning is a complex and multi-dimensional construct that
includes trait features of emotional reactivity as well as those more directly related to emotion
regulation. For example, affective lability (the speed, frequency, and range of changes in affec-
tive states) is an important emotional process observed in those with certain psychiatric disor-
ders (e.g., bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder). More generally, affective lability
is a feature underlying trait neuroticism [16] in non-clinical samples and may be a vulnerabil-
ity factor for psychopathology. Affective lability is a specific process that can be examined as
part of a broader effort to phenotypically characterize emotional functioning in misophonia.

No studies have examined the relative contributions and differential associations of affective
lability and difficulties with emotion regulation with misophonia. Determining the relationships
of these emotional processes with misophonia can help clarify intervention targets for clinicians
and treatment researchers. This clarification is important, as there are currently no evidence-
based interventions designed for adults with misophonia, and few randomized trials have been
conducted [17, 18]. Further, despite empirical evidence that mood and anxiety disorders co-
occur with misophonia [6, 14, 15], investigation of misophonia thus far has not controlled for
depression and anxiety symptoms. For research to elucidate factors specifically underlying mis-
ophonia, it is necessary to increase the scientific rigor by controlling for general psychopathol-
ogy. In addition, no studies have dismantled whether specific components of misophonia (i.e.,
frequency of exposure to triggers, ineffective emotional or behavioral responses, or severity of
functional impairment caused by misophonia) are differentially related to difficulties with emo-
tional functional within this population. Determining which components may be associated
with the greatest problems with emotional functioning could further efforts for treatment devel-
opment (i.e., mindfulness or acceptance-based approaches for sound tolerance versus emotion
regulation strategies to target ineffective behavioral responses).

This study begins to disambiguate the relationships among affective lability, difficulties
with emotion regulation, and the components of misophonia. Data were collected over the
first few months of COVID-19, and due to the heightened stress and presence of anxiety and
depression during the pandemic [19], we account for this psychological impact in our hypoth-
eses and data analytic approach. First, replicating and extending the finding that misophonia-
related impairment is associated with emotional functioning deficits [13], we hypothesized
that misophonia would be significantly associated with (a) difficulties regulating emotions in
moments of distress and (b) rapid shifts in emotional state (i.e., affective lability). We further
hypothesized that difficulties managing emotions may be related to severity of misophonia
over and above affective lability. We expected these relationships would hold when controlling
for symptoms of anxiety and depression and the impact of COVID-19. Lastly, because avoid-
ance and escape are common in misophonia and have been more generally associated with
emotion regulation difficulties across a range of psychopathology, it was hypothesized that,
among the three components of misophonia, ineffective emotional and behavioral responses
to triggers would be differentially associated with greater trait difficulties regulating emotions.

Methods
Participants

We evaluated these aims in a nonclinical sample of 297 adults recruited using the online Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Inclusion criteria required participants to (a) be able

to read and understand English, (b) be between 18–65 years old, and (c) have an MTurk par-
ticipant approval rating of at least 99%. In line with recommended strategies when conducting
research within MTurk, our study included three attention checks [20]. Attention checks were
interspersed throughout the study and consisted of brief multiple-choice questions aimed to
differentiate attentive from inattentive participants. Of the 384 participants who completed the
study, we utilized data from the 297 participants who responded correctly to all three attention
checks.

Demographic information for the final sample is displayed in Table 1. Overall, the sample
predominantly identified as male, White, and non-Hispanic. The majority reported complet-
ing college or a higher level of education and had a household income over $40,000 per year.

Procedures

The Duke Health Institutional Review Board approved study procedures and participants pro-
vided written assent before beginning the study. All participants completed a battery of self-
report questionnaires related to emotional functioning, mental health symptoms, COVID-
19-related stress, and misophonia. Data were collected online via REDCap and MTurk, and
participants received $5.00 for completing the surveys.

Measures

Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ [6]). The MQ contains 17 items across three subscales:
Symptom Subscale, Emotions and Behaviors Subscale, and Impairment Subscale. The Symp-
tom Subscale assesses frequency of bothersome noises (i.e., people eating, repetitive tapping).
The Emotions and Behaviors Subscale assesses emotional (e.g., feeling anxious/distressed,
becoming angry) and behavioral (e.g., escaping or avoiding situations, covering ears)
responses to trigger noises. Response options for the first two subscales are rated from 0 (“not
at all true”) to 4 (“always true”) and are summed for a MQ total score of 0–68. The Impairment
Subscale consists of a single self-reported rating of sound sensitivity and impairment, ranging
from 0 (minimal) to 15 (severe). As per Wu et al. 2014, a cut score of seven on this item indi-
cates clinically significant misophonia symptomology. Initial validation of the MQ demon-
strated good internal consistency (α = .86 - .89; [6]). Cronbach’s alpha in the current sample
was also good for the MQ total score (α = .89), as well as for the Symptom Subscale (α = .87)
and the Emotions and Behaviors Subscale (α = .86).

Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale–Short Form (DERS-SF [21]). The DERS-SF is
an 18-item version of the widely used 36-item DERS [22]. The DERS-SF assesses six processes
associated with difficulties regulating emotions when distressed: (1) Non-acceptance of emo-
tional responses, (2) Difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, (3) Difficulties controlling
impulsive behaviors, (4) Lack of emotional awareness, (5) Limited access to emotion regula-
tion strategies, and (6) Lack of emotional clarity. Item responses are scored from 1 (“almost
never”) to 5 (“almost always”), with higher scores indicating greater difficulty with emotion
regulation. The DERS-SF total score was used in the present study, is commonly used as a
global measure of difficulties regulating emotions, and is the sum of the six subscales. This
score ranges from 18–90, with higher scores indicating greater difficulty regulating emotions.
The DERS-SF total score had high internal consistency in the validation study (α = .89; Kauf-
man et al., 2016) as well as in the current sample (α = .93).

The Affective Lability Scale– 18 item (ALS-18 [23]). This self-report measure assesses

rapid shifts in affective experience and emotional expression. Each item is rated on a scale
from 0 (“very uncharacteristic of me”) to 3 (“very characteristic of me”). Higher total scores

indicate more affective lability. The measure demonstrates good internal consistency (α = .87;
Oliver & Simmons, 2004). Chronbach’s alpha in the current sample was excellent (α = .97).
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7 [24]). This brief self-report ques-

tionnaire assesses generalized anxiety. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0
(“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”) to assess frequency of symptoms. Higher total scores
reflect more severe anxiety. The GAD-7 has excellent internal consistency (α = .92) and test-
retest reliability (intraclass correlation = 0.83; Spitzer et al., 2006). Chronbach’s alpha in the
current sample was .92.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 [25]). The PHQ-9 is the depression module
of the larger Patient Health Questionnaire, a self-administered questionnaire that assesses each
of the nine DSM-IV criteria for depression (i.e., feeling down, hopeless, lack of appetite). The
nine items assess symptom frequency from 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Nearly every day”). Higher
total scores reflect higher depression severity. The PHQ-9 has excellent internal reliability (α =
.89). Internal consistency was also high in the current sample (α = .89).

The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS [26]). The CEFIS is

designed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEFIS includes 25 dichotomous
ratings (“yes” or “no”) of how COVID-19 may have impacted that individual and their family,
including financial stress, education and work disruptions, family or individual exposure to
COVID-19, hospitalizations, and deaths. In order to obtain an indicator of the overall impact of
COVID-19, we summed the 25 items; higher total scores indicate more severe impacts of the
pandemic. Due to the recent onset of COVID-19 at the time of this study, however, there were
no psychometrically validated measures of pandemic stress. We chose to include this unpub-
lished measure in order to control for the effects of COVID-19 on individuals’ daily functioning.

Data analytic plan

All analyses were conducted in SPSS 26.0 [27]. First, data were screened for normality using Sha-
piro-Wilk tests and any data that were non-normally distributed were log transformed. To con-
duct this transformation a value of “1” was added to each score because the lowest possible score
on these measures was zero, and the value of zero cannot be log-transformed. Preliminary explo-
ration of the relationships among misophonia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and COVID-
19 impact was conducted using bivariate correlations. Next, a multiple linear regression was con-
ducted to explore the relationship between misophonia symptoms and difficulties with emotion
regulation and affective lability, controlling for anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 impact. In
order to examine if emotional functioning predicts misophonia symptoms broadly, a z-score was
computed to derive an overall misophonia severity variable (each of the three MQ subscales was
z-scored and the three z-scores were summed to create a standardized composite variable reflec-
tive of overall misophonia severity). This analytic plan enabled exploration of the relationships
among study variables accounting for potentially confounding variables.

Lastly, the relationships among specific components of misophonia (i.e., MQ Symptom,
Emotions and Behaviors, and Impairment Scales) and emotional functioning were examined.
This analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression with significant predictors from
the previous model entered in step two to determine which MQ subscale(s) accounted for
emotional functioning over and above the a priori covariates (i.e., anxious and depressive
symptoms, and COVID-19 impact) in step one.

Results

The total scores for the DERS-SF, PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ALS-18 all deviated from a normal dis-
tribution (as indicated by p < .05 on Shapiro-Wilk tests) and were log transformed to reduce

bias. Following logarithmic transformations, all variables approximated normal distributions
(corrected skewness ranged from -1.78 to .34; corrected kurtosis ranged from -1.31 to 2.76;
[28, 29]). Findings are presented using the transformed variables due to the a priori decision to
log transform variables that were not normally distributed. Analyses were conducted both
with and without transforming the variables and results remained the same.

Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics for all measures are included in Table 1. On average, the sample obtained
a mean item score of 3.63 (SD = 2.51) on the Impairment Subscale, suggesting that the sample
reported mild sound sensitivity on average. Over a tenth of the sample (13.47%, n = 40)
reported clinically significant misophonia symptoms that cause impairment in their everyday
lives, as indicated by a score of seven or higher on the MQ Impairment Subscale [6]. In addi-
tion, the sample’s total scores on the DERS-SF, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 fell within one standard
deviation of the scores reported in their respective validation studies in non-clinical samples
[21, 24, 25]. The mean score on the ALS-18 was 1.80 standard deviations above that reported
in the validation study [23], which used a nonclinical college-aged sample.

Correlations between misophonia, mental health symptoms, and emotion
regulation

Pearson zero-order correlations indicated there were significant, positive correlations between
misophonia severity (MQ total) and (a) depressive symptoms, (b) anxiety symptoms, and (c)
COVID impact. As such, we included these variables as covariates in the remaining analyses.
Additional Pearson correlations were conducted to examine associations between MQ total
and the two planned measures of emotional functioning. MQ total was significantly correlated
with both DERS-SF and ALS-18. All correlations are displayed in Table 2.

Relationship among components of misophonia and emotional functioning

First, we examined the relationship between emotional functioning and misophonia symp-
toms with a multiple linear regression (Table 3). Step 1 controlled for age and gender, as well
as symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the impact of COVID-19. Step 2 included two
measures of emotional functioning: the DERS-SF, measuring specific difficulties with regulat-
ing emotions when distressed, and the ALS-18, measuring strength of variability in affective
experiences. The model indicated that, together, the variables in Step 2 (difficulties with emo-
tion regulation and affective lability) accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in
overall misophonia severity, even after controlling for severity of anxiety and depression symp-
toms and the impact of COVID-19 (F(7,257) = 14.45, p < .0001, R2 = .28, R2 change = .04).
More specifically, the model indicated that the DERS-SF but not the ALS-18 evidenced a sig-
nificant association with the MQ severity score (standardized β = .26, t(3.69), p < .0001).

Next, we conducted a multiple linear regression to examine the specific component(s) of
misophonia related to difficulties regulating emotions (Table 3), after controlling for age, gen-
der, depression and anxiety symptoms and the impact of COVID-19 in Step 1. Only DERS-SF
was included in this model, as ALS-18 was not a significant predictor in the prior model. Step
2 of the model accounted for 50% (p < .0001) of the variance in DERS-SF total score (F(8, 256)

Discussion

The primary aim of this study was to examine the relationships among difficulties with emo-
tional functioning and specific components of misophonia. A community sample was used,
with 13.5% of individuals reporting moderate or higher impairment in functioning due to
sound sensitivities. This result is notable, given that the sampling procedure did not selectively
recruit individuals self-identifying with misophonia. The prevalence of misophonia is
unknown, with previous studies estimating approximately 17% of undergraduate students
reporting moderate or higher impairment caused by misophonia (e.g., [6]). Accordingly,

findings from our study represent a somewhat lower estimate of the prevalence of clinically
significant misophonia compared to earlier studies with college student samples.

As hypothesized in the present study, misophonia severity was correlated with anxiety,
depression, COVID-19 impact, difficulty regulating emotions, and affective lability. These
results are in line with previous findings suggesting misophonia may be associated with higher
depression, anxiety, and difficulty regulating emotions [6, 13, 30]. This is the first study to
examine the relationship of misophonia with affective instability. The association of misopho-
nia with affective lability is consistent with earlier suggestions that misophonia may be charac-
terized by heightened negative emotional reactivity [1]. To the best of our knowledge, this is
also the first study to examine the relationships among misophonia, emotion regulation, and
the impact of COVID-19. Given growing literature highlighting the relationship of COVID-19
with increased rates of depression and anxiety (e.g., [19]), which are also associated with miso-
phonia, it is unsurprising that the impact of the ongoing pandemic is also associated with
greater misophonia severity.

Additionally, results supported our hypothesis that difficulties regulating emotions would
account for misophonia severity after controlling for the presence of anxiety, depression, and
COVID-19 impact. One other study has noted a relationship between misophonia and difficul-
ties regulating emotions [13]; however, this study did not control for the presence of other
mental health symptoms. Thus, the results of the current study replicate and extend those find-
ings by suggesting difficulties with emotion regulation remain significantly related to miso-
phonia even when controlling for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Importantly, although the
amount of variance in misophonia symptoms explained by difficulties with emotion regulation
was statistically significant, it was much smaller than that accounted for by the impact of
COVID-19 and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Nonetheless, this finding raises the ques-
tion of if, and to what extent, general psychological distress may explain the relationship
between misophonia and emotion regulation. One hypothesis is that individuals with miso-
phonia may have problems regulating emotions irrespective of current anxiety, depression, or
the impact of COVID-19. Responses to the DERS-SF represent more trait-like difficulties with
emotion regulation, whereas the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 represent distress in the two weeks prior
to assessment. As such, these findings suggest that an individual’s perception of their ability to
regulate emotions broadly may be associated with misophonia above and beyond the distress
they experienced close to the time of assessment. Still, because symptoms probed on the PHQ-
9 and GAD-7 may also be correlated with emotion regulation, it is important to conduct
research that can investigate and ultimately elucidate the roles that these constructs have in the
etiology and maintenance of misophonia.

In contrast to the role of difficulties with emotion regulation, findings using a multivariate
model indicated that affective lability did not account for misophonia severity when co-vary-
ing the impact of COVID-19, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. This finding points to the
possibility that affective lability, though correlated with misophonia, is not as useful of an indi-
cator of severity compared to difficulties regulating emotions. When considering this pattern
of results, it is possible that the experience of strong and variable emotions is less related to
misophonia symptom severity than how emotions are regulated when one is distressed.
Because this is the first study to explore the relationship between affective lability and miso-
phonia, this result should be considered preliminary until replicated. Future studies, particu-
larly research using ecological momentary assessment and longitudinal designs, can further
disambiguate the temporal relationships among affective lability and emotion dysregulation in
naturalistic contexts including trigger sounds.

An additional goal of this study was to explore whether specific aspects of misophonia were
differentially associated with emotional functioning difficulties. To the best of our knowledge,

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263230 February 11, 2022

PLOS ONEEmotional functioning in misophonia

no study has explored whether the frequency of exposure to misophonic sounds, emotional
and behavioral responses to sounds, or reported impairment due to sound sensitivity is
uniquely associated with emotional functioning. Our results are congruent with the hypothesis
that emotions and responses when hearing a bothersome noise, rather than the frequency of
exposure to bothersome sounds, may be associated with greater difficulties regulating emo-
tions. Put differently, emotion regulation difficulties may be associated with how one responds
to triggering stimuli rather than how often they are exposed to such stimuli. This finding may
be useful for clinicians treating misophonia. Specifically, in an effort to reduce difficulties with
emotion regulation when treating individuals suffering from misophonia, it may be important
to target problems with emotional and behavioral responses to trigger sounds.

These findings add to the emerging literature indicating emotion regulation is relevant to
understanding misophonia and has potentially important implications for intervention devel-
opment [13]. Evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapies that target processes related to
emotion regulation are well established for depressive, anxiety, and emotional disorders [31–
34]. It is possible that the application of these treatments can help remediate symptoms of mis-
ophonia. Although there are no evidence-based treatments specifically for misophonia, an
emerging clinical literature suggests the application of a range of interventions within the
broader family of cognitive behavioral therapies may be useful when treating misophonia [13,
33]. Without more randomized controlled trials or controlled experimental studies testing
interventions for misophonia, it is clear that more research is needed to establish the accept-
ability and efficacy of any treatment approaches for misophonia.

These results should be considered in the context of the limitations of this study. First, the

sample was recruited from Amazon’s MTurk and had a higher percentage of White partici-
pants (83.2%) than is representative of the United States population (76.3%; https://www.
census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219), limiting the generalizability of study results.
Future studies with diverse and under-represented samples are needed. There may also be
associated limitations and concerns regarding data collection and sampling using MTurk,
including less sustained attention and fidelity to survey procedures, perhaps in part due to the
remote, anonymous nature of study administration. There may also be individual differences
among MTurk participants that contribute to limited generalizability of results. For example,
MTurk participants scored lower on extraversion and emotional stability than community
participants on a measure of the Big Five Personality traits [35] a finding reflected in the cur-
rent sample’s ALS-18 scores. Although our sample passed all three attention checks through-
out the study, and numerous empirical studies have suggested MTurk participants produce
reliable results consistent with decision-making biases present in control groups [36], replica-
bility among in-person community samples are warranted.

Second, although the MQ has been used in recent studies [14, 37–40], it was developed and

validated using an undergraduate student sample [6]. Limited validity data have been pub-
lished for the MQ, and its applicability to non-student samples remains unclear. Additionally,
impairment on the MQ is assessed by a single item, limiting reliability of this assessment.
Third, our data were cross-sectional, liming our ability to draw conclusions about causal rela-
tionships between the relevant constructs over time. Future research should aim to collect lon-
gitudinal data (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) to further elucidate the relationship
between emotions and behaviors in the context of misophonia and emotion regulation strate-
gies. This knowledge can lead to targeted intervention development.

A final limitation to consider is that emotion regulation is a multifaceted construct. For
example, Gratz and Roemer [22], who developed the measure on which the DERS-SF is based,
proposed emotion regulation includes components such as awareness and understanding of
emotions, acceptance of emotions, engaging in goal directed behavior when experiencing

PLOS ONEEmotional functioning in misophonia

strong emotions, inhibiting impulsive behavior, and accessing effective emotion regulation
strategies. In this study, we assessed emotion regulation in a global manner, but did not exam-
ine the relationships among specific components of emotion regulation with misophonia. The
finding indicating a significant relationship between misophonia and emotion regulation even
when controlling for other psychological difficulties (e.g., anxiety, depression, COVID-19
impact) highlights the need for future research designed to parse apart components of emotion
regulation that contribute to misophonia severity. When considering the small amount of vari-
ance accounted for in the present study by difficulties with emotion regulation over and above
the impact of COVID-19, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, it is especially important for
future studies to discern whether and which specific difficulties with emotion regulation are
most germane to understanding misophonia. Further, components of depression and anxiety,
assessed in the PHQ and GAD respectively, remained significantly associated with difficulties
regulating emotions when misophonia variables were included in regression analyses. This
result highlights the challenges associated with exploring the relationship of emotion regula-
tion and misophonia while controlling for other psychopathology that is also characterized by
difficulties with emotion regulation. On one hand, the significant relationship of misophonia
with difficulties in emotion regulation while controlling for depression and anxiety suggests
further exploration of misophonia and emotion regulation is warranted. On the other hand,
the significant relationship of all three constructs with emotion regulation raises the potential
that the relationship of misophonia with emotion regulation is driven by the fact that people
with more severe misophonia symptoms often report more depression and anxiety, but that
misophonia is neither uniquely associated with emotion regulation alone nor with symptoms
of depression or anxiety alone. One way to disentangle the relationships among depression,
anxiety, and emotion regulation in misophonia would be to conduct prospective studies (e.g.,
ecological momentary assessment) that examine the variability of these phenomena
longitudinally.

Despite these limitations, this study is among the first to explore and disentangle the rela-
tionships among misophonia and emotional functioning broadly. We hope that these findings
will help pave the way for future research to continue examining the role of emotion regulation
in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of misophonia.
