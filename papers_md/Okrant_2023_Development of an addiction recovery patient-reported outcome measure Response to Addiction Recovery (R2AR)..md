Development of an addiction recovery 
patient-reported outcome measure: Response 
to Addiction Recovery (R2AR)
Elisabeth Okrant1, Sharon Reif1* and Constance M. Horgan1 

Abstract 
Background  Recovery, a primary goal of addiction treatment, goes beyond abstinence. Incorporating broad 
domains with key elements that vary across individuals, recovery is a difficult concept to measure. Most addiction-
related quality measurement has emphasized process measures, which limits evaluation of treatment quality 
and long-term outcomes, whereas patient-reported outcomes are richer and nuanced. To address these gaps, this 
study developed and tested a patient-reported outcome measure for addiction recovery, named Response to Addic-
tion Recovery (R2AR).

Methods  A multi-stage mixed methods approach followed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Infor-
mation System (PROMIS) measure development standard. People with lived experience (PWLE) of addiction, treat-
ment providers, and other experts contributed to item distillation and iterative measure refinement. From an item 
bank of 356 unique items, 57 items were tested via survey and interviews, followed by focus groups and cognitive 
interviews.

Results  Face validity was demonstrated throughout. PWLE rated item importance higher and with greater vari-
ance than providers, yet both agreed that “There are more important things to me in my life than using substances” 
was the most important item. The final R2AR instrument has 19 items across 8 recovery domains, spanning early, 
active, and long-term recovery phases. Respondents assess agreement for each item as (1) a strength, and (2) impor-
tance to ongoing recovery.

Conclusion  R2AR allows PWLE to define what is important to their recovery. It is designed to support treatment 
planning as part of clinical workflows and to track recovery progress. Inclusion of PWLE and providers in the devel-
opment process enhances its face validity. Including PWLE in the development of R2AR and using the tool to guide 
recovery planning emphasizes the importance of patient-centeredness in designing clinical tools and involving 
patients in their own care.

Introduction
Addiction,  encompassing  alcohol  and/or  drugs,  is  a 
chronic  disease  whereby  recovery  is  often  characterized 
by  cycles  of  remission,  recurrence,  and  treatment.  Sus-
tained recovery may take years [1], with significant social 
and economic impact on individuals, families, communi-
ties,  and  health  systems.  While  remission  of  substance

use is generally considered the start of recovery, the tran-
sition  to  sustained  recovery  is  not  well  understood. The 
conflation  of  abstinence  with  recovery  in  clinical  and 
cultural  discourse  emphasizes  remission  as  an  endpoint 
when,  in  fact,  recovery  also  requires  attention  to  social 
determinants of health. With few exceptions [2–4], little 
is known about the combination of factors that contrib-
ute to recovery and, thus, how to measure it.

Pathways  to  recovery  are  highly  personalized,  which 
makes  universal  elements  difficult  to  observe.  Research 
to develop such knowledge collectively with people with 
lived  experience  (PWLE)  of  addiction  as  the  primary 
data  source  could  inform  (1)  what  is  critical  to  ongoing 
recovery and what threatens it; and (2) whether common 
elements define recovery. These data could foster deeper 
insights  into  sustained  recovery,  and  treatment  could 
focus  on  resources  supportive  of  these  factors.  To  date, 
most  addiction-related  quality  measurement  has  relied 
upon near-term process measures that are not indicative 
of long-term recovery or quality of services delivered to 
support PWLE in their recovery journeys. Further, most 
have  not  been  developed  a  priori  and  conceptually  with 
the  goal  of  clinical  integration  and  intention  to  capture 
changes  over  time.  To  address  these  gaps,  this  study 
developed and tested a patient-reported outcome meas-
ure  for  addiction  recovery  with  input  from  both  PWLE 
and  providers,  named  Response  to  Addiction  Recovery 
(R2AR).

Defining recovery

Recovery  definitions  must  incorporate  a  nuanced  and 
multidimensional conceptualization of individual recov-
ery  pathways  [5].  Definitional  efforts  have  spanned 
federal  agencies,  consensus  panels,  and  others  [4, 
6–8].  One  example  uses  a  harm  reduction  approach 
to  advance  recovery  science  and  research:  “an  indi-
vidualized, intentional, dynamic, and relational process 
involving sustained efforts to improve wellness” [9]. The 
National  Institute  on  Alcohol  Abuse  and  Alcoholism 
(NIAAA)  emphasizes  remission  from  heavy  drinking, 
as well as no longer meeting criteria for an alcohol use 
disorder, while also acknowledging that “social support 
and  spirituality…physical  and  mental  health,  quality  of 
life,  and  other  dimensions  of  well-being”  are  critical  to 
ongoing recovery [8].

Existing definitions agree about two main points. First, 
addressing  unhealthy  alcohol/drug  use  and  physical 
dependence  is  only  one  of  many  changes  that  people  in 
recovery  report  as  important  [10].  Therefore,  recovery 
goes  beyond  remission  to  a  broader  view  of  functional, 
psychosocial,  and  environmental  well-being  [5].  Other 
key  dimensions  include  coping  and  functional  skills, 
social  connectiveness,  physical  health,  and  personal 

fulfillment [11, 12]. Second, recovery involves a process. 
The  life-course  that  fostered  addiction  requires  ongoing 
and transformative change [13–15].

Recovery: challenges for measurement

is  ambiguously  deployed 

The  recovery  concept 
in 
research  and  clinical  practice,  mainly  because  recovery 
journeys are unique. People must overcome different bar-
riers and benefit from facilitators specific to their individ-
ual experience. Their navigation of recovery reflects their 
history, socioeconomic situations, and perceptions about 
what constitutes a fulfilling life. A recovery measure must 
be flexible to capture these individual and changing path-
ways.  To  be  sensitive  to  significant  and  clinically  mean-
ingful  changes,  it  must  not  be  constrained  by  “floor”  or 
“ceiling”  effects.  With  addiction  often  cyclical  and  non-
linear,  a  recovery  measure  will  fail  to  capture  progress 
and  outcomes  unless  this  aspect  of  disease  burden  is 
incorporated into its design.

Individualized measurement via patient‑reported 
outcomes

Patient-centeredness  as  a  quality  measurement  con-
cept  incorporates  patients’  voices  in  defining  outcomes 
[16].  Often  contrasted  with  “objective”  tests  and  clinical 
assessments  (e.g.,  urine  drug  screens),  patient-reported 
outcome  measures  (PROMs)  are  tools  that  capture 
patient  perspectives  of  their  health  and  wellbeing  [17]. 
PROMs  allow  clinicians  to  monitor  patients’  subjec-
tive  health  status  over  time  and,  importantly,  function 
as  a  warning  system  if  outcomes  decline,  unlike  pro-
cess  measures  that  focus  on  early-stage  treatment.  Yet 
PROMs must be appropriately developed to incorporate 
outcomes  prioritized  by  patients,  and  enable  sharing 
of  the  information  in  ways  that  are  relevant  to  patients 
[18].  In  short,  PROMs  are  patient-centered  when  devel-
oped to measure outcomes patients have defined, rather 
than  reflecting  the  clinicians’  or  researchers’  definition 
[18, 19]. Additionally, PROMs are patient-centered inas-
much as they invoke shared decision making, so that they 
empower patients to direct care. This means that PROMs 
must be acknowledged as part of the treatment process, 
and the data used to evoke communication between pro-
vider and patient.

PROMs  can  accommodate  variation  in  the  recovery 
definition,  its  chronic  and  cyclical  nature,  and  variable 
and  subjective  pathways.  They  allow  people  to  define 
recovery  themselves,  reflect  subjective  changes,  and 
emphasize patients as central in their addiction care, sim-
ilar to other conditions such as cancer and disability [20, 
21], where outcome definitions differ by person and can 
change over time. Further, given the association between 
self-efficacy and addiction outcomes [22, 23], PROMs are 

Okrant et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2023) 18:52

adaptive to asking PWLE about self-efficacy in the recov-
ery  process,  to  measure  and  predict  outcomes.  Shared 
decision-making may also improve patient-provider rela-
tionships  and  therapeutic  alliance,  and  in  turn  support 
treatment  plan  progress  [22].  Despite  importance  for 
patient-centered care, a PROM that reliably measures the 
complexity  of  recovery,  as  well  as  any  changes  over  the 
course of recovery, does not yet exist for addiction.

Existing recovery measures

Despite  these  challenges,  eight  validated  recovery 
measures  exist  [24–31],  two  of  which  are  shortened 
versions.  Table  1  describes  these  existing  recovery 
measures;  Table  2  compares  their  recovery  domains. 
All  capture  the  fundamental  notion  that  recovery  is 
multidimensional  and  primarily  reflects  changes  that 
occur  outside  of  treatment  [3,  14,  32,  33].  Yet,  gaps 
remain  [34],  including  the  generalizability  of  the  pop-
ulations  tested  [35].  Further,  the  domains  and  items 
differ across the existing measures, and none are com-
prehensive. Okrant [34] offers a comprehensive review 
of the existing measures developed prior to 2019, sum-
marized and updated with new measures here.

The  Assessment  of  Recovery  Capital  (ARC)  [24]  was 
the first recovery measure developed. Including 50 items 
across  10  domains  based  on  biopsychosocial  principles, 
and  developed  iteratively  with  patients  and  providers,  it 
is  inclusive  of  heterogeneous  recovery  pathways.  How-
ever, dichotomous yes/no responses lead to a “flattening” 
of  experience  gradients  and  contextual  meaning  across 
people who share a particular stratum. Furthermore, the 
ARC was not designed to link outcomes to interventions, 
thus  has  limited  clinical  use,  although  a  shortened  ver-
sion was created to address this concern. The Hope and 
Coping in Recovery Measure [25] lacks other important 
recovery  indicators,  and  was  developed  using  only  col-
lege-age students.

The  Substance  Use  Recovery  Evaluator  (SURE)  meas-
ure  used  a  consumer-driven  theoretical  framework 
throughout development, with PWLE contributing to its 
initial  formulation  and  refinement  [26].  Its  21  items  fall 
within  five  domains,  with  recovery  scores  generated  by 
Likert-scale  responses,  with  administration  intended  to 
enhance  the  patient-provider  therapeutic  relationship 
by  eliciting  patient  narratives.  The  Recovery  Progres-
sion  Measure  (RPM)  was  developed  to  incorporate  the 
link between recovery capital and psychometrically valid

outcomes, a limitation of most other tools [27]. Based on 
Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (CBT),  the  RPM  includes 
36 items in 6 domains with demonstrated internal valid-
ity.  Dichotomous  responses  are  used  within  domains, 
along with an 11-point Likert scale to assess each domain 
overall.  However,  PWLE  were  not  included  in  measure 
construction, thus it lacks patient-centeredness as a core 
value, and cannot assert face validity.

Two shortened (10-item) recovery measures have been 
created  to  reduce  burden  and  be  more  amenable  to  use 
within treatment settings. Vilsaint et al. created the Brief 
Assessment  of  Recovery  Capital  (BARC-10),  using  item 
response  theory  to  reduce  the  items  in  the  ARC  [28]. 
Although  the  BARC-10  reduces  burden,  it  also  offers 
less  information  for  treatment  planning  [29].  The  Rapid 
RPM  was  created  to  reduce  response  time  and  burden, 
although without PWLE involvement at this stage [36]. It 
may have the same concerns about sufficient information 
for  treatment  planning  as  noted  for  the  BARC-10.  The 
Brief  Addiction  Monitor  (BAM)  instrument  developed 
by the Veterans’ Association is a 17-item instrument that 
measures  subdomains:  risk  factors  for  substance  use, 
protective factors for sobriety, and drug and alcohol use 
[30]. The BAM does not provide a psychometrically valid 
score [35, 37], but can be used to look at changes across 
domains.

Finally,  the  most  recent  recovery  measure,  Multidi-
mensional  Inventory  of  Recovery  Capital  (MIRC)  by 

Bowen et al. [31] has aggregated the conceptual mod-
els  across  many  pre-existing  measures,  and  added 
negative  recovery  capital,  or  barriers  to  recovery, 
to  operationalize  their  construct.  The  measure  was 
developed for alcohol use disorder only and might not 
generalize  to  other  substance  use  disorders.  We  note 
that the International Consortium of Health Outcome 
Measurement  (ICHOM)  has  recently  completed  work 
on  measures  and  related  methodological  processes 
for assessing the outcomes of substance use treatment 
[38], yet this approach is not a unique instrument, thus 
is not described here.

The  measures  vary  by 

items  and  measurement 
approach. Several ask yes/no questions, which can lead 
to a “flattening” of experience gradients and contextual 
meaning across people. PWLE were not included in the 
development of four measures, which may reduce face 
validity  and  patient-centeredness  as  a  core  value.  Sev-
eral others did involve PWLE, with the SURE doing so 
in  a  most  comprehensive  fashion  [18].  Most  were  not 
tested  in  clinical  settings,  nor  were  they  psychometri-
cally  validated  across  subgroups  and  substance  use 
diagnoses. The shortened measures aim to reduce bur-
den  and  increase  feasibility  within  treatment  settings, 
yet  may  be  too  concise  for  treatment  planning.  The 
R2AR instrument described here was designed to more 
comprehensively address these challenges.

Study objective

This  study  aimed  to  develop  a  PROM  for  addiction 
recovery that captured the complexity of recovery; was 
agnostic to specific types of substances, level of use, or 
place  of  service;  and  incorporated  PWLE  in  develop-
ment  and  testing.  The  R2AR  instrument  accomplishes 
this. It aims to be feasible and useful in clinical settings, 
and relevant beyond specialty addiction treatment set-
tings, including mental health settings and, importantly, 
primary  care  settings  where  standardized  assessments 
are  essential  to  support  non-specialists  in  identifying 
and treating chronic conditions such as addiction. Cur-
rently, primary care might not be offering substance use 
treatment to individuals regularly, but many stakehold-
ers have advocated for practice transformation wherein 
specialty  care  or  functions  of  specialty  care  are  inte-
grated  within  primary  care  to  offer  whole  person  care 
[39]. The R2AR instrument would support primary care 
in monitoring progress of those patients they treat who 
have substance use disorders, even acting as an indica-
tor  that  referring  out  might  be  warranted  in  the  event 
that  patients  are  not  exhibiting  progress.  The  R2AR 
should address limitations of existing measures and set 
the  stage  for  patient-centered  and  measurement-based 
care  in  addiction  treatment  settings  (see  Fig.  1).  This 
paper  shares  the  methods  used  to  develop  and  refine 
the R2AR.

Methods
The  study  relied  primarily  upon  qualitative  methods, 
which are particularly important in establishing patient-
centered  PROMs  with  face  validity  for  the  addiction 
treatment seeking population [40]. The process included: 
(1)  developing  an  item  bank  following  the  PROMIS 
method  [41];  (2)  distilling,  testing,  and  refining  items 
through  an  iterative  mixed  methods  approach,  includ-
ing PWLE and behavioral health (BH) providers; and (3) 
testing with patients and providers at a non-profit feder-
ally qualified health center (FQHC). The first two phases 
are  more  fully  described  by  Okrant  [34]. This  process  is 
summarized in Fig. 2 (item reduction) and Table 3 (stake-
holder input), with additional detail below. The research 
was  approved  by  the  University’s  Institutional  Review 
Board.  All  participants  provided  informed  consent, 
including for audio recording.

Initial R2AR Development

R2AR construction used the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement  Information  System  (PROMIS)  for  meas-
ure research and development recognized by the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (https:// mmshub. cms. 
gov/) [42, 43]. A comprehensive item bank was developed 
from  existing  measures  [41],  including  45  measures  and 
their 652 individual items. All items were imported into 
Atlas.ti.  v.8.4.4,  then  coded  to  identify  unique  concepts 
using inductive grounded theory [44].

Fig. 2  Item Reduction Process and Criteria

The  infrastructure  to  categorize  items  was  developed 
from  eight  recovery  domains  identified  from  the  litera-
ture and existing recovery measures, with review by five 
expert addiction treatment and recovery researchers and 
clinicians to confirm relevance to the recovery construct. 
These  domains  include  meaning  and  purpose,  psycho-
logical  well-being,  environment/housing/safety,  social 
support,  coping  and  life  functioning,  recovery  experi-
ence/risk  taking,  health,  citizenship  and  community 
involvement.

Item bank distillation process

Distilling  the  item  bank  was  iterative.  (1)  Initial  coding 
and  item  reduction  by  the  first  author  (EO).  (2)  A  sur-
vey  with  PWLE,  who  self-identified  as  being  in  recov-
ery  from  any  type  of  substance  use  problem,  and  other 
stakeholders  for  further  item  reduction  and  sorting  by 
recovery  domains  and  stages.  (3)  In-depth  interviews 
with  a  subset  of  survey  respondents.  (4)  Cognitive  test-
ing  interviews  with  PWLE  and  behavioral  health  (BH) 
providers.  Figure  2  illustrates  the  item  reduction  pro-
cess.  The  expert  input  into  selecting  existing  measures 
and  initial  distillation,  as  recommended  in  the  PROMIS 
method,  was  balanced  with  PWLE  input  via  qualitative 
methods immediately following this initial stage, includ-
ing  the  opportunity  to  recommend  any  concepts  that 
were omitted.

Initial item bank coding and reduction

After  removing  duplicates,  356  items  were  assessed  for 
overlapping  meaning.  Core  categories  were  refined  by 
removing  redundancies  and  items  that  did  not  fit,  then 
combined  into  larger  theoretical  themes.  Items  with  lit-
tle face validity or likely relevance to recovery outcomes 
were removed.

Survey of PWLE and stakeholders

The  online  survey  solicited  feedback  about  the  57 
remaining items to ensure that PWLE were part of devel-
oping  and  validating  domains.  Respondents  were  asked 
which  items  were  most  important  to  their  own  recov-
eries  (or  of  people  known  to  them)  on  a  1  to  10  scale, 
and to assign each item to a recovery domain and stage. 
The  recovery  stage  question  aimed  to  capture  changes 
in  recovery  over  time,  to  inform  clinical  recovery  path-
ways  and  understand  transitions  from  early  to  active  to 
long-term  recovery.  The  placements  of  each  item  into 
one recovery domain provided insight into how they per-
ceived  the  underlying  constructs,  approximating  a  data-
driven factor analysis.

Responses  (N = 330)  were  primarily  PWLE  (N = 188) 
and BH providers (N = 94) (see Supplemental Table A1). 
These groups were examined separately and in compari-
son, using a correlation matrix to identify items with sim-
ilar constructs, and Cronbach’s alpha to test the internal 
consistency  of  items  within  domains,  without  defining

a  dimensional  structure  during  this  initial  testing.  The 
remaining  survey  participants  (N = 48)  were  family/
friends  or  other  stakeholders,  who  were  dropped  from 
this analysis.

Interviews with PWLE

PWLE  survey  respondents  also  were  invited  to  share 
their recovery experiences through qualitative interviews. 
Structured open-ended questions aimed to understand if 
the initial items captured their recovery experiences, and 
identify  missing  concepts  or  less  relevant  items.  Inter-
viewees  were  asked  about  the  experience  of  responding 
to the items (e.g., triggering language or positive/negative 
feelings).

Interviews  were  coded  via  grounded  theory.  Codes 
were  examined  across  interviews  to  identify  similar 
underlying  meaning,  and  renamed  as  appropriate.  Ulti-
mately, 31 interview-based codes emerged (Supplemental 
Table  A2).  No  new  codes  were  identified;  rather  inter-
views  provided  confirmation  and  guidance  for  further 
reduction of items.

Iterative development of the R2AR

The 57 items tested in the survey and 31 interview codes 
were  then  examined  together.  Balance  across  domains 
and  response  variation  were  considered.  That  is,  people 
differed  on  which  items  were  or  were  not  most  impor-
tant to their recoveries or items that were less important. 
These distinctions were examined to ensure sensitivity to 
varied  recovery  experiences  and  changes  across  stages. 
Therefore, some items not uniformly thought to be criti-
cal  to  recovery  were  retained.  Some  items  were  modi-
fied  to  enhance  clarity.  The  resulting  preliminary  R2AR 
instrument included 18 items.

Cognitive testing interviews

The original PWLE interview participants agreed to com-
plete  the  preliminary  R2AR  and  were  re-interviewed 
regarding  how  well  the  instrument  captured  individual 
recovery experiences; and whether it promoted any posi-
tive/negative feelings, experiences, etc.

Five  BH  providers  provided  insight  into  how  the  pre-
liminary  R2AR  might  be  further  refined.  They  assessed 
whether  the  items  captured  recovery  progress  and  were 
representative  across  recovery  stages;  item  clarity  and 
meaning; the Likert scale; and the value of asking people 
in recovery about the relative importance of each item to 
their recoveries. The resulting revised R2AR was tested in 
a clinical setting.

R2AR refinement within a clinical setting

Further revisions stemmed from preparations for a pilot 
clinical trial to validate the R2AR among people receiving 

medications  to  treat  opioid  use  disorder  (MOUD) 
(NCT05388045).  The  authors  and  clinical  partners  at 
an  addiction-focused  Federally  Qualified  Health  Center 
(FQHC)  reviewed  the  instrument,  refining  it  to  more 
accurately represent recovery domains and ensuring the 
anchor  questions  and  Likert  scale  optimized  precision 
and variability within and across people during different 
recovery stages.

At  the  same  clinical  setting,  focus  groups  were  held 
with  nurse  care  managers  (NCMs)  who  support  clients 
on  MOUD  and,  separately,  with  a  group  of  addiction 
treatment clients, followed by additional cognitive inter-
views of addiction treatment clients. The addiction treat-
ment clients were recruited from the addiction treatment 
programs at this clinical partner.

Nurse Care Manager (NCM) focus group

The NCM group discussed whether the items addressed 
recovery areas they deemed important to clinical practice 
and its viability for clinical use. They were asked to sug-
gest  alternatives  to  items  that  they  questioned,  to  move 
closer to the intended meaning.

Client focus groups

Individuals  treated  for  addiction  at  the  FQHC  were 
recruited  for  two  focus  groups.  Participants  discussed 
interpretation of each item, dissecting what it was trying 
to capture about recovery. They explained how they com-
prehended  the  item,  and  relevance  to  their  own  experi-
ences.  As  needed,  the  group  collectively  edited  items 
until consensus was reached. The group setting offered a 
unique opportunity to shape the items in alignment with 
their varied lived experiences and meaning. Participants 
also considered whether the items, anchor questions, and 
Likert scales were viable for measuring the recovery con-
struct.  The  R2AR  incorporated  feedback  from  all  three 
focus groups, then was reviewed by the research team.

Cognitive interviews

Again,  cognitive  interviews  with  addiction  treatment 
clients  aimed  to  assess  concordance  with  intended  item 
meaning  and  the  cognitive  approach  that  resulted  in 
a  particular  response.  The  participant  reviewed  each 
item,  then  explained  their  perceived  meaning  and  their 
thought  process  when  deriving  a  response;  discussion 
included the Likert scale and anchor questions.

Response to Addiction Recovery (R2AR) instrument

The research team revised the R2AR a final time prior to 
fielding in the pilot clinical trial. In summary, construct-
ing  the  R2AR  required  balancing  four  components:  (1) 
Prioritizing  items  that  PWLE  and  stakeholder  groups 
expressed were most important recovery, while allowing 

Okrant et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2023) 18:52

for  variation.  (2)  Distributing  items  across  early,  active, 
and long-term recovery. (3) Representing all eight recov-
ery  domains.  (4)  Creating  face  validity  via  iterative  pro-
cess with PWLE and stakeholders, and construct validity 
using qualitative codes to ensure no gaps existed among 
the  items  conceptualizing  the  recovery  construct.  The 
final R2AR instrument is described below.

Results
Survey of PWLE and Stakeholders
Survey participants
The  survey  was  completed  by  N = 330  people  overall, 
with the majority (N = 188) PWLE and (N = 94) BH pro-
viders. Item response rates ranged from 84.0% to 90.5%.

PWLE  survey  respondents  had  a  broad  range  of  sub-
stance use, recovery, and treatment experiences. The vast 
majority were in recovery for 2 + years, with 80% in long-
term recovery. Most reported 10 + years of substance use 
problems before their current recovery, most with multi-
ple substances; alcohol was most frequently the primary 
substance,  followed  by  heroin  and  other  opioids.  About 
60% reported mental health issues. To achieve their most 
recent recovery period, most (80%) received formal treat-
ment. Almost half the states were represented, with most 
from  Massachusetts,  followed  by  California,  Michigan, 
and  Pennsylvania.  (See  Supplemental  Table  A3  for  soci-
odemographics and Table A4 for recovery, substance use 
and mental health characteristics.)

Among  BH  providers,  about  37%  had  a  professional 
degree  (e.g.,  MSW),  and  nearly  9%  had  a  certificate  or 
training  (e.g.,  Certified  Alcohol  and  Drug  Counselor). 
Most  were  from  California  or  Massachusetts.  (See  Sup-
plemental Table A5 for sociodemographics.)

Survey results ‑ ranking of items important to recovery

Overall,  PWLE  rated  item  importance  higher  and  with 
greater  variance  than  BH  providers  (Table  4).  This  sug-
gests  that  PWLE  responded  for  their  individual  path-
ways, whereas BH providers were more likely to respond 
through  the  lens  of  treating  multiple  people,  i.e.,  aggre-
gating across their experiences.

The  57  items  were  moderately  to  highly  correlated 
(range  0.41  to  0.88  for  PWLE,  0.60  to  0.99  for  BH  pro-
viders) indicating similarity of concepts and highlighting 
items for elimination. Cronbach’s alpha (0.97) confirmed 
internal consistency.

Both  PWLE  and  BH  providers  agreed  that  “There  are 
more  important  things  to  me  in  my  life  than  using  sub-
stances” was the most important item for recovery, with 
a mean “importance to recovery” ranking of 9.44 (stand-
ard  deviation  1.54)  out  of  10  points  by  PWLE  and  9.50 
(standard  deviation  0.82)  by  BH  providers.  The  item 

emphasizes that self-efficacy, not abstinence, was central 
to recovery pathways.

Survey results ‑ recovery stages and recovery domains

PWLE  and  BH  providers  responded  similarly  for  recov-
ery  domains  and  stages  for  most  items.  The  items  were 
fairly  well-distributed  across  domains,  although  most 
were  in  the  “Meaning  and  Purpose”  and  “Psychological 
Well-Being”  domains.  Items  were  also  well-distributed 
across  all  recovery  stages.  PWLE  selected  long-term 
recovery for more items than BH providers, who selected 
active  recovery  for  more  items;  early  recovery  items 
were comparable across the two groups. For some items, 
multiple  stages  of  recovery  applied.  Table  5  summarizes 
items by domain and stage.

Iterative selection and revision of themes and items 
for inclusion

The  emergent  themes  identified  through  the  interviews 
were  consistent  with  the  eight  recovery  domains  and 
survey responses. During the NCM focus group, an addi-
tional  item,  “I  am  hopeful”,  was  strongly  recommended, 
and included for final cognitive testing.

To  capture  the  complexity  of  recovery  outcomes 
over  time,  it  was  important  for  final  items  to  be 
included across stages and domains. Some high-ranking 
items  were  ultimately  excluded  due  to  over-emphasis  of 
a recovery stage or domain and to allow for inclusion of 
other key items. For example, the item “I feel connected 
to my community” [45] was retained despite lower rank-
ing  because  it  could  lead  to  interventions  that  support 
reintegration  into  social  networks.  Further,  it  was  sig-
nificantly endorsed through interviews and focus groups 
that linked community connectedness to recovery.

Clarifying wording and meaning

The cognitive interviews validated items’ intended mean-
ings  with  one  exception:  “I  am  dealing  with  my  legal 
problems  (like  custody,  warrants,  paying  fines  or  child 
support).”  PWLE  answered  “strongly  agree,”  but  regard-
ing  past  problems  while  the  question  was  intended  for 
current  issues.  Their  pride  for  remediating  downstream 
addiction  issues  was  considered  still  relevant,  so  their 
responses reflected the item’s importance to their present 
recovery. The item was retained.

Final item selection and balance

The  final  R2AR  contains  19  items,  balanced  across  the 
three  stages  of  recovery  and  eight  recovery  domains 
(Table 5). For each item, the R2AR asks, on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale: (1) In general, how much do you agree with the 
following  statements,  and  (2)  how  important  is  this  to

Discussion
This  study  aimed  to  develop  an  addiction  recovery 
PROM tool that could be feasibly administered, support 
providers  in  measuring  clinically  meaningful  progress 
in  recovery,  and  strengthen  the  therapeutic  relation-
ship  by  focusing  on  what  matters  to  people  in  recovery. 
The  R2AR  instrument  developed  here  systematically 
captures  the  essential  recovery  domains  and  compre-
hensively  incorporates  perspectives  of  PWLE.  It  is  the 
first  to  measure  recovery  through  early,  active,  and  late 
stages,  allowing  for  sensitivity  to  changes  across  time, 
and uses a 5-point scale for each item, potentially a larger 
floor  and  ceiling  to  capture  those  changes.  This  tool 
aligns  with  the  National  Quality  Forum  guidebook  [46] 

to  simultaneously  develop  PROMs  with  performance 
measures  to  drive  high-quality  measurement-based 
clinical  care.  In  other  words,  capturing  items  across  the 
spectrum  of  recovery  progress  will  allow  quantification 
which, in turn, will allow for capture of clinically mean-
ingful change.

As  noted,  a  challenge  to  measuring  recovery  is  that  it 
is  multidimensional,  individually  experienced,  and  fre-
quently  in  flux.  To  date,  measures  have  not  accounted 
for  dynamic  movement.  The  R2AR  uniquely  uses  both 
subjective and objective measures so that individuals can 
dynamically define what is important to them at a given 
time. The R2AR does not intrinsically apply an overarch-
ing  preconceived  idea  of  recovery,  which  would  falsely 
suggest  that  research  and  clinical  practice  fully  know 
what defines recovery and for whom. It moves toward a 
flexible  approach  that  allows  individuals’  definitions  of

recovery to change over time. We requested that PWLE 
define  what  “early,”  “active,”  and  “long-term”  recovery 
mean  to  them  to  analyze  overlapping  themes  for  these 
commonly  used  terms  without  accepted  clinical  defini-
tions.  These  phases  are  important  to  define  to  monitor 
progress in recovery and quantify quality of care. Tradi-
tional definitions using time in remission or time without 
using  substances  are  insufficient  to  explain  how  people 
move along the continuum of care or progress in recov-
ery.  While  there  is  a  potential  of  recall  bias  among  the 
respondents,  methods  that  rely  upon  people’s  interpre-
tation of their own experiences are critical to developing 
measures  that  matter  to  PWLE.  Additionally,  we  were 
able  to  confirm  the  validity  of  these  findings  through 
convergent validity with providers’ view of these phases, 
which were consistent with PWLE.

Through  our  qualitative  interviews  and  focus  groups, 
we learned from patients that the value of assessments is 
in  their  ability  to  evoke  discussions  with  providers,  and 
for providers to acknowledge the responses patients pro-
vided  in  these  surveys.  In  other  words,  simply  complet-
ing  the  instrument  does  not  benefit  patients  (though  it 

might  via  the  Hawthorne  effect);  the  utility  is  in  surfac-
ing the patient voice to the provider. As such, the instru-
ment is not merely meant to be a data point, but rather a 
means for eliciting narratives from the patient that ena-
ble  patient-directed  care.  Given  responses  to  R2AR,  the 
provider would help guide the patient to determine what 
aspects  of  recovery  are  most  relevant  to  work  on  and 
implement a care plan to support those goals.

The  strength  of  this  instrument  development  is  in 
the multi-phased, mixed methods approach and PWLE 
focus,  and  reliance  on  the  gold  standard  for  iterative 
data  collection  and  refinement.  The  R2AR  built  upon 
previous  knowledge  in  the  addiction  treatment  and 
recovery  field  and  applies  learnings  from  other  fields 
that  effectively  use  PROMs.  If  further  validated,  it 
could have enhanced clinical utility over prior measures 
because of its potential to support integrated care mod-
els for patients with any SUD, and balances brevity with 
a  range  of  information  that  can  assist  recovery  plan-
ning.  The  R2AR  was  developed  for  use  in  any  setting, 
including  primary  care,  similar  to  other  standardized 
assessments (e.g., depression screening) which support 

 Okrant et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2023) 18:52 

Page 12 of 14

non-specialists  and  care  coordinators  in  managing 
chronic  disease.  Additionally,  we  carefully  crafted  the 
language  of  each  item  and  tested  items  with  PWLE  to 
ensure  that  the  language  was  not  triggering,  remained 
positive,  and  did  not  reify  negative  self-stigma.  We 
believe  that  this  characteristic  of  R2AR  is  uniquely 
patient-centered.

Testing  for  usability  and  sensitivity  continues,  along 
with  psychometrics  more  broadly.  We  will  continue  to 
pilot R2AR among different subgroups to ensure sensitiv-
ity across subpopulations, within treatment and care set-
tings  that  are  embedded  in  communities  of  people  with 
various  sociodemographic  backgrounds  and  who  expe-
rience different ecological impacts [47], prior to a larger 
trial.  Ongoing  work  is  also  examining  the  feasibility  of 
using  the  R2AR  to  assess  changes  over  time.  We  expect 
that  the  tool  will  be  demonstrated  as  agnostic  to  spe-
cific types of SUD to make it easier to implement across 
PWLE and within clinical settings and easier to aggregate 
for  a  quality  of  care  measure.  If  we  learn  that  the  three 
stages  of  recovery  that  we  initially  partitioned  as  early, 
active,  and  long-term  are  not  representative  across  sub-
groups, future efforts will also address variation in expe-
riences  when  determining  which  items  are  indicative  of 
recovery stages across groups.

The next step is to use the subjective (what is impor-
tant) and objective (how much do you agree) questions 
to  create  a  scoring  methodology  and  usable  “report 
card”  that  prioritizes  the  items  that  individuals  feel 
are  most  important  to  their  respective  recoveries.  The 
score will go beyond summation of Likert scale points, 
to  account  for  individual  perspectives  and  measure 
progress based on achievement toward their important 
items.  For  example,  scoring  of  the  “subjective”  items 
about  what  is  important  for  the  person  to  work  on 
could be compared over time and scores used in clini-
cal conversation about why focus changed (i.e. because 
goals were met and new items have elevated in impor-
tance,  or  if  biopsychosocial  changes  in  their  environ-
ment have altered the way in which people think about 
what is best for their recovery plans), as well as how to 
meet  new  goals.  An  overall  score,  weighted  by  patient 
assessment  of  items  important  to  recovery,  could  be 
used as an overall assessment of progress on individu-
alized  recovery  plans  that  is  meaningful  for  that  that 
person.  As  we  learn  more  about  which  items  belong 
to  early,  active,  and  long-term  recovery,  we  will  aim 
to  develop  minimal  clinically  important  differences, 
which is another tool for evaluating recovery progress. 
From a patient panel perspective, providers could learn 
about  their  operational  and  treatment  effectiveness. 
For  example,  they  would  be  able  to  observe  at  a  prac-
tice  level,  how  effective  they  are  at  addressing  certain 

aspects  of  recovery.  They  could  create  action  plans  to 
improve quality of care and service based on the items 
that they are least able to improve.

Ultimately,  a  primary  goal  of  this  PROM  is  to  have 
a  reliable  tool  that  will  assess  personal  recovery  pro-
gress  in  a  patient-centered  manner  and  measure  qual-
ity of treatment when aggregated across a patient panel, 
and  reflect  clinical  utility  within  existing  workflows. 
Our  approach  to  meet  this  goal  is  consistent  with  the 
ICHOM methodology [38].

Several  limitations  should  be  noted.  The  initial  item 
bank  development  and  refinement  was  completed  by 
the  first  author,  an  expert  in  quality  measurement  and 
patient  reported  outcomes,  without  PWLE  input.  As 
a  more  objective  process  to  identify  all  relevant  met-
rics,  reduce  duplicates,  and  identify  unique  concepts, 
results  from  this  phase  were  less  likely  to  be  uniquely 
driven by PWLE input and our approach reduced their 
burden.  However,  the  iterative  process  with  PWLE 
through  focus  groups  and  interviews  provided  oppor-
tunities  for  new  items  to  be  added.  For  example,  “I  do 
things,  even  when  I  do  not  want  to,  because  I  know  I 
should,”  was  an  item  that  was  added  resulting  from 
the  qualitative  interviews.  PWLE  respondents  in  the 
survey  and  first  set  of  interviews  were  mostly  in  later 
stages  of  recovery  and  involved  with  a  recovery  com-
munity  (e.g.,  mutual-help).  Responses  might  not  gen-
eralize  to  people  in  earlier  recovery  or  not  involved  in 
12-step programs. However, later interviews were with 
people active in treatment, broadening our base; these 
participants  were  treated  for  addiction  at  one  FQHC 
thus  responses  might  be  specific  to  that  experience, 
and might not reflect the sensitivity for all SUD types. 
All  PWLE  were  volunteers,  so  might  be  different  from 
those who chose not to participate. The PWLE popula-
tion was highly educated, employed, and mostly white, 
thus  results  may  not  reflect  the  broader  population 
in  addiction  recovery.  Work  is  underway  to  capture  a 
Black/African-American population in a lower-income 
urban area. This initial study emphasized development 
and face validity of the R2AR; future work will examine 
psychometrics.

The  methods  used  to  develop  the  R2AR  ensure  face 
validity  which  is  critical  to  capturing  the  recovery  con-
struct;  the  ongoing  pilot  study  will  evaluate  whether 
there  is  a  factor  structure  that  supports  the  conceptual 
recovery domains. It also will assess the feasibility of the 
R2AR  in  clinical  practice,  determine  if  the  instrument 
has value to clinicians and people receiving MOUD, and 
capture  changes  over  time.  It  will  collect  reliability  and 
validity data, including correspondence with self-efficacy, 
health-related  quality  of  life,  therapeutic  alliance  and 
substance use itself.

Conclusion
This  study  tested  a  new  concept  for  recovery  PROMs 
that  captured  the  complexity  of  addiction  recovery  and 
allowed for patient feedback on their important goals to 
work  on  specific  to  their  recovery  journey.  This  R2AR 
instrument  embedded  in  its  design  the  notion  of  self-
directed care which brings together measurement-based 
care, patient-directed care, and therapeutic alliance into a 
single clinical instrument.

The  purpose  of  developing  an  addiction  recovery 
PROM  is  threefold:  (1)  to  aid  PWLE  in  self-directing 
treatment  and  establishing  agency  to  track  recovery,  as 
well as evaluate recovery progress from an individual per-
spective;  (2)  to  facilitate  the  treatment  relationship,  and 
actively monitor whether interventions to address recov-
ery  elements,  identified  as  important  by  PWLE,  are  in 
fact improving; and (3), to support integration, efficiency, 
and appropriate referral decision making within primary 
care  settings.  Clinical  tools  that  support  the  therapeutic 
relationship  and  capture  objective  measures  of  change 
over time, allowing patients the agency to report on pro-
gress,  must  be  developed  while  considering  patient  and 
provider burden, feasibility, and usability. For health sys-
tems to transform and serve vulnerable populations like 
the addiction recovery population, innovative approaches 
to  data  collection  and  measurement  are  required.  For 
that  reason,  the  PROM  developed  here,  Response  to 
Addiction Recovery (R2AR) offers an approach to report-
ing outcomes that accounts for differences across people 
and  encourages  them  to  assess  their  recovery  progress 
according to their own recovery definitions.
