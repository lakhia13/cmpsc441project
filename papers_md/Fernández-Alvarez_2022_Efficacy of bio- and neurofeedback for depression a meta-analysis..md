Abstract

Background. For many years, biofeedback and neurofeedback have been implemented in the
treatment of depression. However, the effectiveness of these techniques on depressive symp-
tomatology is still controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted
from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase.
Methods. Two different strings were considered for each of the two objectives of the study:
A first group comprising studies patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and a second
group including studies targeting depressive symptomatology reduction in other mental or
medical conditions.
Results. In the first group of studies including patients with MDD, the within-group analyses
yielded an effect size of Hedges’ g = 0.717, while the between-group analysis an effect size of
Hedges’ g = 1.050. Moderator analyses indicate that treatment efficacy is only significant when
accounting for experimental design, in favor of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in com-
parison to non RCTs, whereas the type of neurofeedback, trial design, year of publication,
number of sessions, age, sex and quality of study did not influence treatment efficacy. In
the second group of studies, a small but significant effect between groups was found
(Hedges’ g = 0.303) in favor of bio- and neurofeedback against control groups. Moderator ana-
lyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by any of the sociodemographic and
clinical variables.
Conclusions. Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and neurofeedback are associated with
a reduction in self-reported depression. Despite the fact that the field has still a large room for
improvement in terms of research quality, the results presented in this study suggests that both
modalities may become relevant complementary strategies for the treatment of MDD and
depressive symptomatology in the coming years.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a worldwide leading cause of disability, with
more than 300 million people affected (WHO, 2017). Not only does it entail a major impact
on people’s quality of life and social functioning (Angermeyer, Holzinger, Matschinger, &
Stengler-Wenzke, 2002; Gili et al., 2013; IsHak et al., 2013; Zuelke et al., 2018), but also
MDD is strongly related with a vast array of other mental disorders, mainly anxiety disorders
(Watson, 2009), as well as a great number of medical conditions, including chronic physical
illnesses (Kang et al., 2015) and neurological diseases (Raskind, 2008).

Although psychotherapy (Cuijpers, Cristea, Karyotaki, Reijnders, & Huibers, 2016), psy-
chopharmacology (Cipriani et al., 2018) and the combination of
the previous two
(Craighead & Dunlop, 2014) have shown to be efficacious, there is still much room for
improvement. Around 40–50% of patients do not respond to treatment (Cuijpers et al.,
2014) and a third of those who do respond present relapses (Beshai, Dobson, Bockting, &
Quigley, 2011; Burcusa & Iacono, 2007). Besides, it is estimated that 75% of depressed people
remain untreated (WHO, 2017). Hence, it is of utmost importance to develop new modalities
of treatment that can help to overcome the aforementioned obstacles (Kazdin & Blase, 2011).
In this sense, biofeedback is considered one of the existing mind-body interventions that
may foster the bridging of physiological and psychological interventions. Biofeedback techni-
ques entail a signal (e.g. video, audio display or tactile) connected to a physiological process
that enables the person to be aware of normally unconscious physiological activity (Browne,
2015). In this sense, individuals are provided with explicit information of a certain psycho-
physiological process in order to foster its regulation.

Sacchet & Gotlib,

Biofeedback has principally been used in the medical
realm, although there is also a long-standing tradition of research
on biofeedback techniques for mental disorders (Lehrer &
Gevirtz,
In particular,
post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder are
among the most researched conditions (Schoenberg & David,
2014). Different physiological processes have been implemented
for biofeedback procedures,
including both the central and
autonomous nervous systems. Electromyography biofeedback
(EMGB), skin conductance biofeedback or heart rate variability
the most used peripheral
biofeedback (HRVB) are some of
responses, while electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) are two
of the most common techniques using neural activity (Sacchet
& Gotlib, 2016).

that depressive

Ample evidence demonstrated that different psychophysio-
logical processes are impaired in patients with MDD. With regard
to the neurocircuitry, functional impairments have been identified
in prefrontal, limbic, striatal, thalamic and basal forebrain struc-
tures (Price & Drevets, 2010). Of particular importance for neu-
there is consistent evidence from EEG research
rofeedback,
demonstrating
individuals present higher
left-hemispheric alpha activity, including hypoactivation in the
left prefrontal area. In this regard, an improvement of the depres-
sive symptomatology has been observed after a neurofeedback-
based training of this asymmetry (Linden, 2014). Likewise, neu-
roimaging and brain structural research indicate that people
with depression present several abnormalities. For instance, the
amygdala has been identified as an important target in neurofeed-
back interventions for depression due to its role in emotional pro-
cessing and responding, interacting with different cortical and
subcortical areas and having shown to be a key marker of the
onset and recovery of MDD (Young et al., 2018).

Likewise, cardiac activity has proven to greatly contribute to
the general physiological dysregulation of depressed patients,
and not only to be a correlate of
the neural dysregulation
(Thayer & Mather, 2018). Heart rate variability (HRV), in par-
ticular the high frequency (HF) of the spectral domain, is consid-
ered to index cardiac vagal tone and thus to be a relevant marker
of MDD. Research in this domain indicates that depression is
associated with lower resting HF-HRV and lower LF/HF ratio
(Hamilton & Alloy, 2016; Kemp et al., 2010).

Taken together, these results indicate that NF and HRVB con-
stitute two techniques that gather consistent theoretical support to
justify a psychophysiological
intervention. Indeed, there are a
number of qualitative reviews (Hammond, 2005; Linden, 2014;
Sacchet & Gotlib, 2016; Young et al., 2018) that have gathered
the available studies of neurofeedback and biofeedback for
MDD and depressive symptomatology. Nevertheless, to the best
of our knowledge, no study has meta-analytically established
the extent to which this approach is efficacious for MDD and
depressive symptomatology, respectively.

Apart from calculating the overall effect of bio- and neurofeed-
back interventions for MDD, this study also aims to calculate the
effect of all bio- and neurofeedback studies that included depres-
sive symptomatology as a secondary outcome measure in subjects
suffering from other conditions than MDD.

Main research questions
(1) What is the pooled evidence for the effectiveness of bio- and

neurofeedback for MDD?

(2) What is the pooled evidence for the effectiveness of bio- and
neurofeedback for depressive symptoms in both medical and
mental/psychiatric conditions other than MDD?

(3) What moderators explain possible sources of heterogeneity

among the effect sizes?

Materials and methods

The systematic review has been developed in accordance with

Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (see Supplementary 1) (Moher et al., 2009).

Items

Search strategy

First, articles were identified through comprehensive searches of
the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and
Embase. The last update was in December 2018. References lists
of review articles were also considered for potential undetected
studies and gray literature has also been examined (for the search
string see Appendix 2).

Eligibility criteria

This study follows a two-step level structure, and thus two differ-
ent eligibility criteria have been considered. To address the first
aim, original articles in English reporting data of the efficacy of
bio- and neurofeedback in the treatment of MDD were consid-
ered. To select studies, the term “clinical depression” utilized in
the DSM 5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) was consid-
ered, which comprises MDD and dysthymic disorder. All studies
that either established a diagnosis of depression using a standar-
dized diagnostic interview (such as the SCID, CIDI, or SCAN) or
participants who presented elevated symptoms of depression
based on self-report measures were considered for inclusion. )

Studies that included subjects taking psychopharmacology or
receiving any other active treatment such as hormone therapy
or psychotherapy were excluded.

To address the second aim, studies that measured depressive
symptomatology through a psychometrically validated instrument
and that presented a condition of bio- or neurofeedback in a ran-
domized controlled trial were considered for inclusion. The
objective of including this second layer of studies was to deter-
to which depressive symptoms are treated
mine the extent
through bio- and neurofeedback techniques in other mental dis-
orders and particularly in medical studies. In other words, all
studies assessing depressive symptomatology as a secondary out-
come measure were comprised.

Unpublished studies, conference papers and proceedings, the-
sis and articles published in non-peer-reviewed were excluded
from the study selection in both searches.

Study selection procedure

One reviewer completed all database searches for both objectives
at the same time. All results were exported to EndNote and dupli-
cates were eliminated. After that, two reviewers (JFA and DC)
screened independently all titles and abstracts to identify poten-
tially relevant article for any of the two objectives. Two different
folders were created, one for each objective. From the total
amount of studies that were included for further examination,
the two independent reviewers read full texts to determine if
the eligibility criteria were fulfilled. Disagreements were resolved

Effect size calculation and coding of studies

We estimated the effect size of both the difference in change
between the groups as well as the pre-post change within the bio-
feedback groups by using Hedges’ g, a variation of Cohen’s d
which takes into account for biases associated with small sample
sizes (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). When the group mean, standard
deviation (S.D.), variance or standard error of the mean, and a
number of subjects were available for each group, these data
were preferably used to calculate the effect size. When some of
these data were missing, we looked for other data allowing for
the effect size computation, such as unstandardized mean differ-
ences, t and p values. If multiple measurements for depression
were used in the same study, a pooled effect size was calculated
in order to include in the meta-analyses only a single effect size
for each study. The pooled estimate of the effect size was calcu-
lated as the average of the different effect sizes of each measure.
The variance of the pooled estimate was also calculated as the
average of the different variances of the effect sizes; as the correla-
tions among the measures are often not reported in the papers,
such approach represents the most conservative way to calculate
the pooled effect size variance (i.e. the strategy that leads to the
largest variances of the estimate of the pool effect size, assuming
a perfect correlation among measures). Similarly, a pooled effect
size was calculated and included in the meat-analysis if either
multiple biofeedback or control groups were used in the study.

In addition, the following study characteristics were coded and
included in the analyses as moderators: (1) sex (% of female sub-
jects in the control group); (2) age (mean age in the control
group), (3) length of treatment (number of sessions), (4) type
of biofeedback intervention (heart rate variability biofeedback or
neurofeedback) (5) year of publication, (6) experimental design
(randomized-control trial), (7) methodological quality of studies.
Coding of moderators 1–3 may be not possible for all studies. In
such case, a “not available” was be inserted.

Two of the authors independently performed the computation
of effect sizes and any discrepancy was resolved before analysis,
with the involvement of a third author in case of persistent
disagreement.

Meta-analytic statistics

Each study effect size was weighted by its inverse variance (the
sum of the within-study variance and an estimate of the between-
studies variance), giving a larger weighting to studies with large
sample sizes than those with small sample sizes. Before excluding
a study because it was not possible to calculate the effect size due
to a lack of enough statistical details reported in the paper, we
the corresponding author (only for studies
tried to contact

The pooled effect sizes were estimated using random-effects
models (Restricted Maximum-Likelihood Estimation), with confi-
dence intervals and statistical test calculated with Knapp–Hartung
method (Knapp & Hartung, 2003), which hypothesizes potential
significant heterogeneity among studies. A significance level of
0.05 was applied.

Q statistic and I2 index were used to investigate the heterogen-
eity of the effect sizes among studies. The significance level of the
Q statistic was set at 0.1 to adjust for the limited statistical power
of this test (Petitti, 2001). I2 can be interpreted as the percentage
of the total variability in a set of effect sizes that cannot be attrib-
uted only to the sampling error within studies. If the Q statistic
resulted significant or I2 suggested heterogeneity, we checked
whether the source of this heterogeneity might have been attribu-
ted to one single effect size outlying from all others. In this case,
we repeated the meta-analytic analyses one-by-one removing each
effect size. The effect size was considered outlying when its exclu-
sion from the analyses yielded a resolution of the heterogeneity,
and its inclusion during the removal of other effect sizes did not.
Finally, moderators were included in the meta-analysis in
order to try explaining possible sources of heterogeneity among
the effect sizes. Moderators were considered only if they were
available in at least four independent studies. Considering the lim-
ited number of studies expected to be included in the current
meta-analyses, moderator analysis will be performed separately
for each moderator.

Publication bias

Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel
plots and by the Egger’s regression test (one-tailed p of <0.05
was considered to indicate the presence of the bias) (Egger,
Davey Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). We also used the
trim-and-fill method from Duval and Tweedie (Peters, Sutton,
Jones, Abrams, & Rushton, 2007) to determine the nature of
potential publication bias and to compute an estimated effect
size that accounts for it.

Results

Included studies

As illustrated in the PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 1), a total of 11 786
records have been retrieved from the initial database searches.
After removing all duplicated articles, the first screening step
(examination of titles and abstracts) identified 7235 references
that were of potential interest for our meta-analysis. Such a process
was carried out by two reviewers and yielded 18 and 24 references,
for each of the respective steps of our study. A total number of 22
papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were finally included in
the study. 24 papers were excluded because they did not satisfy
the inclusion criteria (described in Fig. 1). The whole procedure
was independently done by two reviewers (JFA and DC).

A flowchart of the general inclusion procedure is reported in
Fig. 1. No reply was received from any author we contacted to
obtain missing data. Descriptions of all the included studies
with relevant variables and study-level characteristics coded
for each study are reported in Tables 1–3, for each step of the
study.

Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for MDD (level 1)

Pre-post between-group effect sizes
For the pre-post between-group analysis comparing the bio- and
neurofeedback and control groups, the random-effects analyses
yielded an overall effect size of Hedges’ g = 0.717 (95% CI
0.2121–1.1224, t = 3.357, p = 0.0121) (Fig. 2), indicating a greater
efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback compared to control treat-
ments in the treatment of MDD. In total, this meta-analysis
was based on eight studies and 176 patients. No evidence of sig-
nificant heterogeneity was found considering the Q statistics (Q =
8.193, p = 0.316), while I2 resulted of 29%, indicating a small
potential heterogeneity among the effect sizes of the single studies
(Higgins, 2003).

Moderator analyses and publication bias
The effect of all moderators resulted statistically non-significant
(see Table 4). The occurrence of publication bias was not

suggested by any of the tests used (Trim and Fill analysis) suggests
that no studies needed to fall to the right or left of the mean to
make the plot symmetrical, and Egger’s test resulted not signifi-
cant ( p = 0.4365) as well as by visual inspection of the funnel
plot (Fig. 3).

Pre-post within-group effect sizes
For the pre-post within-group analysis of the sole biofeedback
treatment, the random effects meta-analysis yielded an overall
within-group effect size of Hedges’ g = 1.050 (95% CI 0.492–
1.608, t = 5.991, p = 0.001) (Fig. 4), which indicates a significant
efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback in improving MDD symptom-
atology (n = 110). No evidence of significant heterogeneity was
found considering the Q statistics (Q = 3.353, p = 0.340), and
also I2 (13%) suggests a very limited heterogeneity among the
effect sizes of the single studies.

Moderator analyses
Among the moderators (see Table 5), only the experimental design
resulted in having a significant effect in moderating the overall
within-group effect size (F = 126.582, p = 0.008). The within-group
effect size of biofeedback treatments resulted significant both in
randomized-controlled studies (Hedges’ g = 1.391, 95% CI 1.216–
1.566,
t = 34.164, p < 0.001) and in non-randomized studies
(Hedges’ g = 0.783, 95% CI 0.630–1.566, t = 22.045, p = 0.002),
with the latter resulting significantly greater than the former.

Publication bias
Trim and Fill analysis indicated that one study would need to fall
to the left of the mean to make the plot symmetrical, while no
studies on the other side. This suggests that the overall effect
size calculated in the within-group analysis may be inflated by
the lack of inclusion in the meta-analysis of some unreported
study, as it is also evidenced by visual inspection of the funnel
random-effects meta-analysis

performed adjusting for missing studies still yielded a significant
size (Hedges’ g = 1.196, 95% CI 0.985–1.407,
overall effect
t = 11.102, p < 0.0001), with only a very small reduction of its
previous magnitude. Instead, no evidence of publication bias
was suggested by the Egger’s test ( p = 0.281)

(Fig. 5). However,

Pre-post between-group effect sizes
For the pre-post between-groups analysis comparing the bio- and
neurofeedback and control groups, the random-effects analyses
yielded a significant overall effect size of Hedges’ g = 0.303 (95%
CI 0.121–0.484, t = 2.217, p = 0.003) (Fig. 6), indicating a greater
efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback compared to control treat-
ments for depressive symptoms (n = 736). No evidence of signifi-
cant heterogeneity was found considering the Q statistics (Q =
4.350, p = 0.993), and also I2 (0%) suggests a lack of heterogeneity
among the effect sizes of the single studies.

Moderator analyses and publication bias
The effect of all moderators resulted statistically non-significant
(Table 6) and no occurrence of publication bias was suggested
by any of the tests used (Trim and Fill analysis suggests that no
studies needed to fall to the right or left of the mean to make
the plot symmetrical, and Egger’s test resulted not significant
with a p = 0.911) as well as by visual inspection of the funnel
plot (Fig. 7).

Pre-post within-group effect sizes
Pre-post within-group analysis of the sole biofeedback treatments
could not be performed because only one study (Kayiran, Dursun,
Dursun, Ermutlu, & Karamürsel, 2010) satisfied all the inclusion
criteria for this part of the meta-analysis.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of bio- and neu-
rofeedback techniques for the treatment of MDD and depressive
symptoms. Taken together, these findings suggest that bio- and
neurofeedback constitute effective interventions for both indivi-
duals with clinical depression and with secondary depressive
symptomatology. Besides, the results are in line with the findings
of previous qualitative reviews (Hammond, 2005; Linden, 2014;
Sacchet & Gotlib, 2016; Young et al., 2018).

Bio- and neurofeedback for MDD
While the within-group analyses yielded an effect size of Hedges’
g = 0.717, the between-group analysis revealed an effect size of
Hedges’ g = 1.050. The moderator analyses indicate that treatment
efficacy is only significant when accounting for experimental
design, in favor of RCTs in comparison to non-RCTs. The fact
that all other moderators were non-significant may indicate that
results can be generalized to a range of social and clinical
characteristics.

Nevertheless, these results must be taken with caution given
that only one RCT has been conducted for MDD using HRVB

(Caldwell & Steffen, 2018), and thus making it difficult to con-
clude that this technique is effective for MDD. Additionally,
many of the identified studies targeting clinical depression with
HRVB could not be included due to several reasons, such as the
absence of a control group or the fact that participants were taking
antidepressants. So far, a considerable number of studies have pre-
viously indicated that HRVB is effective for depression, frequently
referring to the research conducted by Karavidas et al. (2007) or
Siepmann, Aykac, Unterdörfer, Petrowski, and Mueck-Weymann
(2008). While it is true that both interventions were effective,
none of them had either a control condition,
in both cases
patients were under psychopharmacological treatment and the
samples were underpowered.

Conversely, neurofeedback gathered more evidence. The exist-
ing studies for neurofeedback comprised both studies brought
forth for EEG (Cheon, Koo, & Choi, 2016; Choi et al., 2011)
and fMRI (Li et al., 2015; Linden et al., 2012; Mehler et al.,
2018; Young et al., 2014, 2017). Among the EEG studies, the tar-
get was to regulate the frontal asymmetric activation increasing
the relative left frontal activity and consequently to improve
depressive symptomatology. In the case of the fMRI studies,
some of them targeted the amygdala (Young et al., 2014, 2017)
and others the insula and lateral prefrontal areas (Mahler et al.,
2018), all of which are involved in the regulation of emotions
(Sebastian & Ahmed 2018). From this point of view, emotion
regulation is a well-established transdiagnostic factor that explains
both the appearance and maintenance of a vast array of affective
disorders (Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema, & Schweizer, 2010), includ-
ing MDD and depressive symptoms. Integrating the evidence

from the prominent theoretical frameworks, it is, therefore, con-
sistent to expect that regulating the principal physiological sub-
strates associated with emotion regulation might increase the
functionality of brain regions involved in several affective disor-
ders, and thus decreasing the associated symptomatology.

Apart from RCTs, there are numerous single cases studies
available in the literature, all conducted with EEG biofeedback
(Baehr, Rosenfeld & Baehr, 1998, 2001; Earnest, 1999; Grin-
Yastenko et al., 2018; Hammond, 2000; Rosenfeld, 2000). Besides,
there are a set of studies that have focused on cognitive, affective
or physiological variables without measuring depressive symp-
tomatology but are worth mentioning given that they show the
improvement of MDD with neurofeedback. Illustrative examples
are the works by Escolano et al. (2014) for the regulation of
cognitive deficits through the regulation of alpha activity or the
in which the authors
study by Hamilton and Alloy (2016),

demonstrated the efficacy in reducing the activity in the salience
network. Last but not least, the cutting-edge research carried
out by the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, who studied
the role of fMRI for the increase of amygdala functional connect-
ivity (Young et al., 2018) or correlation between amygdala activity
and EEG asymmetry during emotion regulation (Zotev et al.,
2016).

Taken together, the results of neurofeedback for MDD indicate

alternative.
Nonetheless, the discussion around neurofeedback is currently a
matter of controversy in the scientific community. Specifically, a
fierce discussion has arisen with regard to the consistency of
results derived from EEG neurofeedback (EEG-nf). While some
authors claim that EEG-nf has a too broad therapeutic target
and thus it is not possible to disentangle specific from placebo effects
(Thibault, Lifshitz & Raz, 2016; Thibault & Raz, 2017, 2018), others

defend a more nuanced position (Micolaud Franchi & Fovet,
2018). In any case, for the specific case of depression, it is clear
that more studies are required before establishing a concluding
statement given that the existing evidence is scant.

According to the results of the meta-analysis, MDD has been
successfully treated either with HRVB or neurofeedback.
Specifically, all studies comprised in level 1 achieved positive
results in their patients. This is consistent with the extant theories
explaining the mechanisms behind the psychophysiological dys-
function in affective disorders. Several theoretical frameworks
such as the Polyvagal theory (Porges, 2007), the Neurovisceral
integration model (Thayer & Lane, 2009) or the baroreflex theory
(Lehrer & Gevirtz, 2014) explored the relationship between vis-
ceral signals, afferent systems, and brain activity. Albeit there
are differences among these models, there is a common under-
standing regarding a reciprocal determination between parasym-
pathetic activity (in particular HF-HRV) and brain activity (in
particular cortical regions like the prefrontal cortex and subcor-
tical regions like the amygdala). In line with this, there is increas-
ing evidence supporting that HRV and certain breathing patterns
might have a causal role on the regulatory brain networks
involved in emotion regulation (e.g. Thayer & Mather, 2018).

Bio- and neurofeedback for depressive symptomatology

Regarding this second group of studies, the effect size was small in
magnitude, albeit significant, and smaller than the pre-post
between-groups effect size found for MDD. However, it can be
stated for the first time that bio- and neurofeedback techniques
are efficacious for the reduction of depressive symptomatology.
Given the fact that many of the included studies presented hetero-
geneous conditions, different baseline levels of depressive symp-
toms and types of biofeedback, the conclusions should be taken
with caution. Moreover, even if many of the included studies pre-
sented heterogeneous conditions, no evidence of significant het-
erogeneity among the effect sizes of the different studies was
found. This suggests a quite stable efficacy of bio- and neurofeed-
back on depressive symptoms independently from the condition.

Gaps and future challenges in the literature of bio- and
neurofeedback for depression

First, it must be clearly stated that only a few of the included stud-
ies were rigorously conducted in both groups. The risk of bias was

Fig. 7. Funnel plot between analyses in level 2.

high or unclear in the majority of the studies, which represents an
undoubted necessity of enhancing the quality of research in this
field.

Besides, regarding the design, some flaws were identified. First,
a great part of the studies was underpowered. Given the increasing
availability of low cost but reliable psychophysiological devices,
bigger samples will be possible to be recruited in the near future.
This would represent an important step in order to more clearly
determine the extent to which bio- and neurofeedback are effect-
ive interventions. In this direction, our results suggest the need for
rigorous RCTs. Due to the high costs of conducting RCTs, single-
case experimental designs appear also as a good alternative
(Bentley, Kleiman, Elliott, Huffman, & Nock, 2019; Kazdin,
2019). Furthermore, future studies should also consider the inclu-
sion of follow-up assessments. Given that depression usually has a
high risk of recurrence (Burcusa & Iacono, 2007), the stability of
the therapeutic gains in the mid and long term is of paramount
importance.

A third important aspect regarding the design of the studies
revolves around control groups. Only a few studies presented
active conditions as comparators and even fewer studies included
both an active and a wait-list condition. Bio- and neurofeedback
techniques permit to easily implement sham conditions. This
may allow to increase the experimental rigor and thus to more
accurately determine the specific contribution of the active aspects
in the final outcome.

A fourth aspect to mention in the primary studies, also iden-
tified by Goessl, Curtiss, and Hofmann (2017), is the necessity to
better specify the amount of time spent with the professional or
practicing bio- or neurofeedback and the therapeutic protocols
that were used. The dose-response relationship may provide
clues to explain mechanisms of change, something that has
been scarcely researched in bio- and neurofeedback yet.

In the present meta-analysis, all included studies were carried
out with traditional bio- and neurofeedback methods. That is, pre-
senting the physiological process in a visual manner but without
transforming the sensing into a particular actuation output that
may be more relevant or engaging for the participants (Kitson,
Prpa & Riecke, 2018). Besides, the field of bio- and neurofeedback
has a lot of potentialities if different technologies are integrated
into classical procedures. New engineering and design develop-
ments may foster multimodal biofeedback systems, taking into
(Bergstrom,
account auditory, visual and haptic feedbacks
Seinfeld, Arroyo-Palacios, Slater, & Sanchez-Vives, 2014; Jones

214

J. Fernández‐Alvarez et al.

& Sarter, 2008). From this point of view and with regard to
depression, a recent study has explored how music neurofeedback
(EEG) could improve symptomatology in elderly people (Ramirez,
Palencia-Lefler, Giraldo, & Vamvakousis, 2015). Also, the cross-
integration of biofeedback, virtual reality, and serious games is
emerging (Schoeller et al., 2019). Some ongoing examples for
affective regulation are already available, such as gamified biofeed-
back in mobile devices for stress management (Dillon, Kelly,
Robertson, & Robertson, 2016) or virtual reality-based biofeed-
back for generalized anxiety disorder (Repetto et al., 2013).
Novel advancements are also very relevant, as the combination
of biofeedback in a mobile-based application for the synchroniza-
tion of HRV and electroencephalography (Lin, 2018).

Finally, machine-learning techniques (MLT) may help to per-
sonalize bio- and neurofeedback. Adapted features, feedback, and
mental strategies could allow for more tailored interventions
based on the characteristics of the user (Alkoby, Abu-Rmileh,
Shriki, & Todder, 2018; Perna, Grassi, Caldirola, & Nemeroff,
2018). In the case of neurofeedback, the complexity of neural pat-
terns suggests the convenience of adopting statistical strategies

Specifically for depression, there have been good signs of progress
to apply MLT for neuroimaging data (Kambeitz et al., 2017) and
this should be applied for future neurofeedback interventions.

Conclusion

Despite the described limitations, the results of the present study
suggest that bio- and neurofeedback constitutes a promising tech-
nique for the reduction of depressive symptomatology in many
diverse populations,
including patients with MDD. Given the
technological advancements in biosensors, a great improvement
of this kind of technique may be expected in the near future.
Furthermore, these interventions could be consistently integrated
into psychotherapeutic contexts
(Lehrer, 2018), constituting
together a potential alternative to the state-of-the-art develop-
ments in the treatment of depression (Hollon, Cohen, Singla, &
Andrews, 2019).

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the
absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could
be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
