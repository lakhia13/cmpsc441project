Objective: Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate, self-inflicted damage of bodily 
tissue without the intent to die, is associated with various negative outcomes. Although 
basic and epidemiologic research on NSSI has increased during the last 2 decades, 
literature on effective interventions targeting NSSI is still emerging. Here, we present 
a comprehensive, systematic review of existing psychological and pharmacological 
treatments designed specifically for NSSI, or including outcome assessments examining 
change in NSSI.

Method: We conducted a systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ERIC 
databases to retrieve relevant articles that met inclusion criteria; specifically, uncontrolled 
and controlled trials that 1) presented quantitative outcome data on NSSI, and 2) clearly 
differentiated NSSI from suicidal self-injury (SSI). Consistent with the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, definition of NSSI, we excluded studies 
examining populations with developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic 
disorders.

Results: Several interventions appear to hold promise for reducing NSSI, including 
dialectical behaviour therapy, emotion regulation group therapy, manual-assisted cognitive 
therapy, dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy, atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole), 
naltrexone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (with or without cognitive-behavioural 
therapy). Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies investigating 
treatment efficacy for NSSI.

Conclusions: Structured psychotherapeutic approaches focusing on collaborative 
therapeutic relationships, motivation for change, and directly addressing NSSI behaviours 
seem to be most effective in reducing NSSI. Medications targeting the serotonergic, 
dopaminergic and opioid systems also have demonstrated some benefits. Future studies 
employing controlled designs as well as a clear delineation of NSSI and SSI will improve 
knowledge regarding treatment effects.

Traiter l’automutilation non suicidaire : une revue systématique 
des interventions psychologiques et pharmacologiques
Objectif : L’automutilation non suicidaire (AMNS), c’est-à-dire les dommages délibérés et 
auto-infligés aux tissus corporels sans intention de mourir, est associée à divers résultats 
négatifs. Bien que la recherche basique et épidémiologique sur l’AMNS ait augmenté 
au cours des 20 dernières années, la littérature sur les interventions efficaces ciblant 
l’AMNS est encore naissante. Ici, nous présentons une revue systématique exhaustive des 
traitements psychologiques et pharmacologiques existants conçus spécifiquement pour 
l’AMNS, ou incluant des évaluations de résultats examinant le changement de l’AMNS.

Méthode : Nous avons mené une recherche systématique dans les bases de données 
PsycINFO, MEDLINE, et ERIC pour extraire les articles pertinents qui satisfaisaient aux 
critères d’inclusion; spécifiquement, les essais incontrôlés et contrôlés qui 1) présentaient 
des données quantitative de résultats de l’AMNS, et 2) différenciaient nettement l’AMNS 
de l’automutilation suicidaire (AMS). En conformité avec la définition de l’AMNS du 
Manuel diagnostique et statistique des troubles mentaux, 5e édition, nous avons exclu les

études qui examinaient les populations souffrant de déficiences développementales ou 
intellectuelles, ou de troubles psychotiques. 

Résultats : Plusieurs interventions semblent prometteuses pour réduire l’AMNS, dont la 
thérapie comportementale dialectique, la thérapie de groupe de régulation émotionnelle, 
la thérapie cognitive à l’aide d’un manuel, la psychothérapie dynamique déconstructive, 
les antipsychotiques atypiques (aripiprazole), le naltrexone, et les inhibiteurs spécifiques 
du recaptage de la sérotonine (avec ou sans thérapie cognitivo-comportementale). 
Néanmoins, il demeure que les études bien contrôlées sur l’efficacité des traitements de 
l’AMNS sont rares.

Conclusions : Les approches psychothérapeutiques structurées axées sur les relations 
thérapeutiques de collaboration, la motivation de changer, et qui abordent directement 
les comportements d’AMNS semblent être les plus efficaces pour réduire l’AMNS. 
Les médicaments ciblant les systèmes sérotoninergique, dopaminergique et opioïde 
ont également démontré des avantages. Les futures études employant des méthodes 
contrôlées ainsi qu’une nette délimitation entre AMNS et AMS amélioreront nos 
connaissances sur les effets des traitements.

Research  on  how  to  effectively  treat  NSSI  is  urgently 

the  deliberate,  self-inflicted 
destruction  of  body  tissue  without  suicidal  intent  and  for 
purposes not socially sanctioned,1 common forms of NSSI 
include  self-cutting,  burning,  scratching,  and  self-hitting, 
with  resulting  injuries  ranging  from  superficial  wounds 
to  severe  and  permanent  mutilation.  Recent  efforts  to 
address  gaps  in  the  current  knowledge  have  culminated 
in  the  inclusion  of  NSSI  in  section  III  of  the  DSM-52  as 
a  condition  for  future  study,  and  emerging  research3,4 
supports this classification. This official recognition in the 
psychiatric nomenclature reflects the prominent and serious 
nature of the behaviour.

NSSI occurs in both clinical and nonclinical populations.5 
Between  4%  and  5.9%  of  adults  in  community  samples 
have  self-injured  at  least  once  in  their  lives.6,7  Rates 
of  NSSI  are  notably  elevated  among  younger  people,

Clinical Implications

•  Brief psychotherapeutic and pharmacological 

interventions can be effective for reducing NSSI.

• 

It may be necessary to treat comorbid disorders before 
using medication to directly address self-injury.

•  Whenever possible, interventions that have been 

supported by level-1 evidence should be offered before 
trying other interventions.

Limitations

•  There is a dearth of well-controlled studies investigating

•  Many treatment studies have relied on very small

•  Many treatment studies conflate operational definitions 

and measurement strategies of NSSI and SSI, 
obscuring knowledge regarding NSSI-specific outcomes.

prospective24,25 associations of NSSI with suicidal thoughts 
and  behaviours.  Between  55%  and  85%  of  people  with  a 
history  of  NSSI  also  report  suicidal  behaviour,26,27  and 
higher frequencies of NSSI are associated with an increased 
risk  of  suicide  attempts.28  Further,  the  overall  functional 
impairment and psychopathology associated with NSSI is 
significant.4

Although  NSSI  and  suicidal  behaviour  have  similar 
behavioural  features,  several  researchers  have  argued 
for  the  importance  of  a  distinction  between  self-injury 
with  and  without  suicidal  intent.29–31  Acts  of  NSSI  and 
SSI  can  be  distinguished  along  several  facets,  including 
intention,  frequency,  medical  severity,  and  methods.32–34 
Additionally,  NSSI  characteristically  occurs  without 
suicidal ideation.7,35

Despite growing recognition that NSSI and SSI are distinct 
(albeit  related)  phenomena,  most  intervention  studies 
focused on self-injury have used definitions and assessment 
methods that fail to differentiate between these behaviours. 
As a result, the target of treatment in these studies is often 
unclear.17 Terms such as parasuicide, deliberate self-harm, 
and self-injurious behaviour sometimes refer to NSSI and 
sometimes to a broader category of behaviours, including 
both  SSI  and  NSSI.  This  lack  of  consistent  terminology 
hampers comparability across studies, and makes it difficult 
to determine whether treatment results in changes in NSSI, 
SSI, or both.

treatment  reviews 

Previous  empirical 
typically  have 
provided  separate  coverage  of  pharmacological  and 
psychological  treatments,20,36,37  and  some  are  limited  to 
particular (for example, adolescent)38,39 populations. These 
previous reviews highlight the following:

1)  a lack of well-established pharmacological treatments 

for NSSI,36,37

2)  a failure to maintain improvements on treatment 

termination,20,40 and

3)  the lack of consistently superior outcomes for specific 

interventions, compared with TAU.5,39 

However, to date, most reviews have included studies that 
conflate NSSI with SSI. Therefore, there is a pressing need 
for a current snapshot of the findings on treatments’ effects 
specific to NSSI.

the  empirical 

Here,  we  provide  a  comprehensive,  systematic  review 
of 
literature  on  psychological  and 
pharmacological  treatments  for  NSSI  in  both  adolescent 
and adult populations. Given the emerging nature of NSSI 
research,  terminological  clarity  is  essential  for  guiding 
appropriate  assessment  and  intervention.33,41  As  such,  we 
employed a conservative definition of NSSI to ensure that 
our  findings  pertain  specifically  and  uniquely  to  NSSI. 
Further,  we  evaluated  the  relative  strength  of  support  for 
various  treatments  to  provide  practical  recommendations 
for clinical practice and research.

Method

Literature Search
We used MEDLINE, ERIC, and PsycINFO search engines 
to identify sources of interest. Search terms included one of 
the following: “self-injur*,” “self-harm*,” “self-mutilat*,” 
“self-wound*,” or “parasuicid*”; and one of the following: 
“intervention,”  “*therapy,”  “treatment,”  or  “medication.” 
We  limited  results  to  empirical  or  quantitative  studies. 
To  identify  additional  sources,  we  consulted  reference 
lists  of  recent  review  articles  investigating  treatments  for 
NSSI.5,17,20,36–40,42–51  Given  the  frequent  co-occurrence  of 
BPD  and  NSSI,  we  also  screened  published  studies  of 
psychotherapies that have garnered support in populations 
with  BPD,  including  DBT,  MBT,  TFP,  and  SFT,  by 
conducting  literature  searches  in  the  same  databases,  and 
by examining a list of studies examining DBT compiled by 
Behavioral Tech, LLC.52

Inclusion and Exclusion
Studies were included in this review if they were published 
in the English language, included human subjects, presented 
quantitative  outcome  data  on  NSSI,  used  an  uncontrolled 
(pre–post) or controlled-trial design, and clearly differentiated 
NSSI  from  SSI  in  the  operationalization  and  measurement 
of  NSSI.  We  excluded  unsystematic  clinical  case  reports, 
owing  to  potential  bias  and  lack  of  experimental  control. 
To  maximize  comprehensiveness,  we  included  studies  of 
treatments directly targeting NSSI, as well as those in which 
the  treatment  addressed  other  mental  health  problems  (for 
example,  depression  and  BPD),  but  outcomes  related  to 
NSSI were assessed. Consistent with the DSM-5 definition 
of NSSI,2 we excluded papers focusing on populations with 
developmental or intellectual disabilities, or with psychotic 
disorders.  We  also  excluded  articles  focusing  on  acute 
care  for  NSSI  (for  example,  wound  care,  and  emergency 
department or psychiatric assessment). Finally, we excluded 
any  study  that  conflated  NSSI  and  SSI,  including  studies 
that  operationally  defined  self-injury  as  including  all  acts 
of  self-injury  regardless  of  the  behavioural  intention,  that 
employed one metric to assess both outcomes (for example, 
counts or rates that included but did not distinguish between 
these types of self-injury), or that used measures that failed 
to distinguish between NSSI and SSI (for example, the Overt 
Aggression Scale53).

Levels of Evidence
Once a preliminary set of articles had been identified, we 
categorized  the  level  of  evidence  presented  in  each  paper 
using  the  United  States  Preventive  Services  Task  Force 
criteria.54  According  to  this  schematic,  level  I  evidence 
denotes having at least one well-designed RCT supporting 
a treatment’s possible efficacy. Level II-1 requires a well-
designed controlled trial without randomization, level II-2 
requires at least one well-designed cohort or case–control 
study, and level II-3 requires a multiple time series design. 
We  excluded  level  III  evidence  (opinions  of  respected

authorities  based  on  clinical  experience  or  descriptive 
studies) from our review.

Search Results
A flow chart diagramming our systematic review process is 
presented in Figure 1. Online eTable 1 summarizes results 
from  the  40  unique  studies  (including  3  sets  of  2  articles 
reporting on overlapping samples) included in this review.

Levels of Evidence
We identified 15 sources that presented level I evidence, 3 
that  presented  level  II-1  evidence,  18  that  presented  level 
II-2 evidence, and 3 that presented level II-3 evidence.

Psychotherapy for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
Empirical  evidence  was  available  for  6 
types  of 
psychotherapy: DBT, ERGT, MACT, TFP, DDP, and VMT. 
We  excluded  several  studies  of  well-known,  manualized 
treatments (for example, MBT and SFT) owing to consistent 
use  of  operational  definitions  or  outcome  measures  that 
failed to clearly differentiate between NSSI and SSI.

DBT  involves  a  combination  of  individual  and  group 
treatment,  in  addition  to  a  therapist  consultation  team  and 
the availability of therapists between sessions for coaching 
and  assistance  with  effective  skill  use.55,56  DBT  prioritizes 
reducing  life-threatening  behaviours,  and  several  studies 
have  demonstrated  that  DBT  leads  to  greater  reductions 
in  NSSI  and  SSI  (considered  together),  compared  with 
TAU.57–60  We  identified  several  empirical  investigations  of 
DBT (including 4 RCTs, 2 non-RCTs, and 10 uncontrolled 
trials)  that  distinguished  NSSI  from  SSI  in  their  outcome 
measures. However, results regarding the efficacy of DBT in 
treating NSSI have been mixed. Although uncontrolled trials 
generally  suggest  that  DBT  reduces  rates,  frequency,  and 
urges to engage in NSSI,34,61–66 2 RCTs found that reductions 
in  NSSI  frequency  were  not  statistically  greater  than  those 
in  active  control  conditions.67,68  Conversely, 
achieved 
however, 2 other RCTs demonstrated that DBT led to greater 
reductions in NSSI frequency than TAU.69,70 Regarding NSSI 
rates,  whereas  one  RCT70  noted  greater  reductions  in  rates 
of  NSSI  in  DBT,  compared  with  TAU,  another  study  did 
not detect any such differences.69 When reductions in NSSI 
are  achieved  during  DBT,  they  are  often  sustained  6  to  12 
months after treatment.67,69,70 Although we identified several 
uncontrolled studies investigating adaptations of DBT across 
various  populations  (for  example,  adolescents  and  patients 
with eating disorders) and settings (for example, inpatient and 
forensic), RCTs have thus far been limited to predominantly 
female adult outpatients with BPD. Thus it is unclear at this 
time whether the promising results achieved in uncontrolled 
trials of DBT are related to differences in the efficacy of DBT 
for  NSSI  across  populations,  or  to  differences  in  research 
designs, particularly given that controlled studies have used 
active  treatment  rather  than  wait-list  control  conditions. 
Investigations regarding potential mediators and moderators 

of  treatment  outcome  for  NSSI  may  help  to  clarify  these 
contradictory  findings.  Currently,  the  available  evidence 
suggests  that  while  DBT  confers  considerable  benefits  in 
reducing  BPD  symptoms  and  associated  psychopathology, 
findings  are  mixed  on  whether  DBT  outperforms  active 
control conditions in the reduction of NSSI specifically.

ERGT  is  the  only  other  psychotherapy  that  has  been 
evaluated  for  its  effects  on  NSSI  in  more  than  one 
controlled trial. Administered in  a  14-week  group  format, 
ERGT  focuses  on  the  development  of  emotion  regulation 
and  acceptance  skills,  as  well  as  on  strategies  to  identify 
and  pursue  important  goals  and  values.71  We  identified  2 
RCTs indicating that ERGT resulted in significantly greater 
reductions  in  NSSI  frequency,  compared  with  TAU.71,72 
Further, 47% of the patients who received ERGT abstained 
from NSSI throughout a 9-month follow-up, supporting the 
durability  of  treatment  effects.72  An  uncontrolled  ERGT 
trial  also  demonstrated  significant  reductions  in  NSSI 
frequency  and  increased  rates  of  NSSI  abstinence  from 
pre- to posttreatment.73 All of the women in these clinical 
samples  had  a  history  of  NSSI,  and  most  (74%  to  100%) 
met criteria for BPD.

Investigations  of  the  other  4  psychotherapies  reviewed 
(MACT, VMT, DDP, and TFP) are each limited to a single 
study; as such, confidence in their findings is contingent on 
further  replication.  MACT  is  a  brief  (typically  6  sessions), 
structured,  problem-solving  treatment,  including  individual 
therapy  and  bibliotherapy.74  Although  MACT  has  been 
evaluated in 2 major RCTs,74,75 the outcome measures did not 
differentiate NSSI from SSI, and thus the studies were not 
included  in  our  review.  However,  a  smaller  RCT  indicated 
a  significant  advantage  of  MACT,  compared  with TAU,  in 
reducing NSSI frequency among female adults with BPD.76

VMT is an integrated expressive arts therapy that aims to 
reduce emotion dysregulation and increase self-awareness 
via  sound-making,  singing,  expressive  writing,  massage, 
movement, and drama activities.77 An uncontrolled, within-
group,  time-controlled  trial  suggested  that  female  young 
adults  engaged  in  less  frequent  NSSI  while  receiving 
10  weeks  of  VMT,  compared  with  during  the  10-week 
pretreatment period.78 The diagnostic characteristics of this 
sample were not reported.

DDP  is  a  manualized  psychodynamic  treatment  for  BPD 
patients with challenging co-occurring conditions that uses 
weekly individual sessions to increase clients’ capacity to 
describe affective and interpersonal experiences in coherent 
narratives.79  In  a  small  RCT  of  adults  with  BPD  and  co-
occurring substance disorders, in which only 7 participants 
reported  engaging  in  NSSI  prior  to  treatment,  3  (57.1%) 
reported abstaining from NSSI during the final 3 months of 
DDP.80 Moreover, among these participants, the frequency 
of  NSSI  within  the  final  3  months  of  DDP  treatment  was 
significantly less than the frequency in the 3 months prior 
to treatment.80 Unfortunately, comparisons of NSSI-related 
outcomes in the DDP and the control group were not carried 
out.

SSI = suicidal self-injury

TFP is a psychodynamic treatment involving twice-weekly 
individual  treatment  using  transference  in  relationships 
(therapeutic and other) as a vehicle for therapeutic change.81 
Results from one uncontrolled trial of TFP for females with 
BPD indicated significant pre- to posttreatment reductions 
in the severity, but not frequency, of NSSI.82 Unfortunately, 
controlled  studies  of  TFP83,84  did  not  meet  our  inclusion 
criteria, as NSSI was not clearly differentiated from SSI in 
these trials.

Regarding  nonantipsychotics,  a  case-controlled,  multiple-
baseline trial showed that the rates and frequency of NSSI 
decreased  significantly  during  augmentive  naltrexone 
treatment in adults with BPD, compared with at baseline.88 
Several  uncontrolled  trials  have  also  reported  benefits  for 
venlafaxine,  buprenorphine,  fluoxetine,  and  naltrexone  in 
reducing NSSI frequency and (or) increasing rates of NSSI 
abstinence,89–92  but  replication  with  controlled  designs  is 
necessary to support these findings.

Pharmacotherapy for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
Empirical  evidence 
regarding  psychopharmacological 
effects on NSSI was available for 5 drug classes: SSRIs (for 
example, fluoxetine), atypical antipsychotics (for example, 
aripiprazole and ziprasidone), SNRIs (venlafaxine), opioids 
(buprenorphine), and opioid antagonists (naltrexone).

Only  1  RCT  has  evaluated  the  efficacy  of  medication  for 
reducing  NSSI  specifically,  demonstrating  that,  among 
adults  with  BPD,  more  participants  abstained  from  NSSI 
during  treatment  with  aripiprazole  and  at  the  18-month 
follow-up,  compared  with  those  receiving  a  placebo.85,86 
Specifically,  only  2  of  the  26  patients  engaged  in  NSSI 
during  8  weeks  of  aripiprazole  treatment,  and  4  engaged 
in  NSSI  during  the  18-month  follow-up  (compared 
with  5  from  the  placebo  group  who  engaged  in  NSSI 
during  treatment,  and  11  reporting  NSSI  during  follow-
up).  Similarly,  a  non-RCT87  found  that  another  atypical 
antipsychotic  (ziprasidone)  resulted  in  lower  rates  and 
frequency  of  NSSI  in  self-injuring  adolescents,  compared 
with  alternative  neuroleptic  medications  (for  example, 
risperidone, olanzapine, chlorproxithen, and promethazine).

Combination Treatments for Nonsuicidal 
Self-Injury
Two  RCTs  have  evaluated  the  incremental  benefit  of 
adding CBT to antidepressants (SSRI or SNRI) in treating 
adolescent  major  depressive  disorder.  Both  studies 
concluded that adjunctive CBT did not reduce the likelihood 
of  engaging  in  NSSI,  compared  with  antidepressants 
alone,25,93,94  and  may  even  increase  risk  for  engaging  in 
NSSI.93  Regarding  the  supplementation  of  CBT-oriented 
treatment  with  medication,  one  RCT  evaluating  DBT  + 
olanzapine,  compared  with  DBT  +  placebo,  for  women 
with  BPD  identified no  incremental benefit of  medication 
for reducing NSSI frequency.95

Comprehensive Therapeutic Programs  
for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
Two  uncontrolled  studies  have  examined  the  effects  of 
comprehensive treatment programs for adults with BPD or 
mixed personality disorders.96,97 These specialized programs 
included  psychoeducation,  pharmacotherapy,  and  group 
and  individual  therapy,  and  both  incorporated  DBT  skills

training as a component of treatment. Both studies detected 
significant  reductions  in  rates  of  NSSI,  postintervention 
(more than 50% and 17% to 25%, respectively). 

Other Interventions for Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
the  effects  of 
studies  have  evaluated 
Numerous 
treatments  that  are  not  formalized  as  psychotherapy  or 
pharmacotherapy. One recent RCT found that a structured 
postcard  intervention  following  deliberate  self-poisoning 
significantly  reduced  suicide-related  outcomes;  however, 
it  did  not  reduce  the  rate  or  frequency  of  self-cutting.98 
Likewise,  one  naturalistic  follow-up  study  investigated 
brief  (8  to  15  minutes),  biweekly  psychiatrist-facilitated 
assertiveness  training  sessions  aimed  at  helping  patients 
increase their self-acceptance and ability to calmly express 
their needs and desires. Among the 13 patients with BPD 
who were treated, 4 (30.7%) reported no NSSI during the 
final  week  following  1  to  4  years  of  treatment.99  Finally, 
one naturalistic, uncontrolled study reported that auricular 
acupuncture  was  associated  with  significant  decreases 
in  NSSI  frequency  among  9  depressed  adolescents.100 
Importantly,  however,  both  of  these  uncontrolled  studies 
were based on very small samples (n < 15).

Discussion
Our  systematic  review  highlighted  an  emerging  empirical 
literature  pertaining  to  psychological  and  pharmacological 
interventions  for  NSSI,  and  identified  several  sources  of 
evidence that have not been included in recent NSSI treatment 
reviews.17,38,39 We identified 15 RCTs—widely considered the 
gold  standard  in  treatment  research19—that  evaluated  NSSI 
treatment  effects.  Our  results  encourage  cautious  optimism 
regarding  the  possible  efficacy  of  ERGT,  MACT,  atypical 
antipsychotics,  and  SSRIs  for  reducing  NSSI.  Additionally, 
we found that, although DBT is often associated with reduced 
rates and frequency of NSSI in uncontrolled trials and reduced 
rates of self-harm more generally (SSI and NSSI considered 
together),  further  research  is  necessary  to  substantiate  its 
advantage over active control conditions for NSSI specifically.

Although  we  have  provided  a  comprehensive  picture  of 
the  current  treatment  research,  more  empirical  work  is 
required  before  we  can  confidently  appraise  the  efficacy 
or  effectiveness  of  NSSI  interventions.  Replication  is 
particularly critical, as most of the treatments identified in 
this review have been investigated in a single study, by a 
single  research  team,  using  small  samples  and  (or)  using 
exclusively BPD samples. Nonetheless, we believe that this 
review can provide useful guidance for clinicians, as well as 
directions for future research.

While  our  results  do  not  identify  a  clear  front-runner 
treatment  for  NSSI,  there  are  numerous  commonalities 
among the treatments identified as potentially efficacious. 
Among  psychotherapeutic 
treatments  demonstrating 
benefits  for  NSSI,  each  stipulate  that  2  preconditions 
for  treatment  are  essential:  a  supportive,  collaborative 
therapeutic relationship; and motivation for treatment.

to 

Consistent  with  these  principles,  patients  who  perceived 
their  therapist  as  warm  and  protecting  reported  fewer 
episodes  of  NSSI  during  the  course  of  DBT.101  Second, 
and  congruent  with  current  theory  suggesting  that  NSSI 
regulate  unwanted  experiences,102  several 
serves 
psychotherapeutic  approaches  recognized  as  beneficial  in 
this  review  incorporate  skills  acquisition,  particularly  in 
the  domain  of  emotion  regulation. Although  mechanisms 
of change in treatments for NSSI remain largely unknown, 
some  evidence  indicates  that  the  use  of  DBT  skills  may 
mediate a reduction in NSSI during the course of DBT.103 It 
is possible that the use of behavioural skills may similarly 
mediate the link between other interventions and reductions 
in  NSSI. Third,  many  advantageous  therapies  incorporate 
idiographic  functional  assessments  of  the  factors  that 
precipitate  and  maintain  NSSI,  and  directly  monitor 
and  target  NSSI  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Supporting  these 
approaches, research has shown that adolescents presenting 
to emergency services with NSSI respond favourably to a 
specific, structured assessment strategy.104

possible 

studies 
Regarding 
atypical 
demonstrating 
antipsychotics, SNRIs, SSRIs, and naltrexone in reducing 
NSSI  are  consistent  with  neurobiological  models 
implicating  disruptions  in  the  dopaminergic,  serotonergic, 
and  endogenous  opioid  systems  in  NSSI.36  However, 
conviction  in  the  effectiveness  of  these  medications  must 
be  moderated  in  light  of  the  very  small  sample  sizes  for 
these  medication  trials.  Some  previous  reviews  have 
advised  initially  targeting  disorders  that  co-occur  with 
NSSI  before  using  medication  to  directly  address  self-
injury.36,105 Consistent with this recommendation, results of 
our review suggest that pharmacological treatment of a co-
occurring disorder may reduce NSSI, at least in depressed 
adolescents.25,93,94  Unfortunately,  there  is  a  paucity  of 
research  on  clinical  decision  making  regarding  which 
medication to try first, and (or) when psychotherapy should 
be  preferred  as  a  first-line  treatment (however,  see  Plener 
et al36). This is an important domain for future research to 
address.

Encouragingly, our results suggest that reductions in NSSI 
can  be  achieved  with  treatments  that  are  relatively  brief 
in  nature  (ERGT:  14  weeks,  MACT:  6  sessions,  atypical 
antipsychotics: 8 weeks, and SSRI with and without CBT: 
12  weeks),  even  among  populations  that  are  challenging 
to  treat  (for  example,  BPD  and  depressed  adolescents). 
Moreover,  some  studies70,76  suggest  that  initial  treatment 
effects  may  persist  up  to  6  months  beyond  termination.
Although cost analyses specific to NSSI have not yet been 
pursued,  treatments  that  attenuate  inpatient  admissions 
and emergency department visits are often cost-effective.58 
Given  that  more  than  one-half  of  patients  who  present  to 
the  hospital  following  NSSI  or  SSI  are  hospitalized,106 
the  development  of  brief  and  effective  interventions  for 
NSSI holds considerable promise for reducing health care 
expenditures.

To  our  knowledge,  this  review  is  one  of  the  first  to 
systematically  exclude  treatment  studies  that  have  not 
clearly differentiated NSSI from SSI. As such, it provides 
an unambiguous picture of the state of treatment research 
for  NSSI.  In  addition,  this  review  underscores  the 
pervasiveness  of  studies  conflating  NSSI  and  SSI  in  their 
operational definitions and measurement strategies. Nearly 
40%  of  the  full-text  articles  reviewed  were  excluded 
because a clear distinction between NSSI and SSI was not 
made.  This  highlights  a  crucial  need  for  future  studies  to 
use  clear  operational  definitions,  as  well  as  measures  that 
disentangle  SSI  from  NSSI.  While  many  interventions 
demonstrating  benefits  for  reducing  broader  classes  of 
self-injury  (NSSI  and  SSI)  may  also  be  effective  for 
reducing NSSI specifically, research must directly address 
this  possibility.  It  is  our  hope  that  the  inclusion  of  NSSI 
disorder as a condition for further research in the DSM-52 
will provide additional impetus for such work.

In  addition  to  the  use  of  consistent  terminology,  we 
believe 3 considerations are most essential as research on 
treatments  for  NSSI  progresses.  Of  primary  importance, 
studies must employ controlled, experimental designs that 
maximize  internal  validity  to  unequivocally  demonstrate 
treatment  efficacy  in  the  absence  of  confounding  factors, 
such as passage of time.19 Additionally, trials based on larger 
samples  will  improve  statistical  power,  generalizability, 
and the ability to investigate mediators and moderators of 
treatment outcome. Finally, given that the preponderance of 
treatment research has been conducted in BPD samples (18 
of the 40 studies reviewed here), it is essential to investigate 
treatment  efficacy  in  other  populations  that  exhibit  high 
rates of NSSI, such as those with depression, anxiety, and 
(or) eating disorders.

Conclusions
Overall,  our  systematic  review  uncovered  encouraging 
evidence of an emerging empirical literature investigating 
treatments effects for NSSI. Unfortunately, it also highlights 
systematic  problems  with  terminology  and  nomenclature 
that make the literature on self-harm difficult to navigate. 
Fortunately, as the treatment literature on disorders such as 
BPD  and  depression  have  revealed,107  building  scientific 
knowledge to guide treatment can occur relatively quickly 
once  potentially  effective  therapeutic  frameworks  are 
formalized and subjected to empirical evaluation.
