HIGHLIGHTS
•  Dissociative  symptoms, 

including  identity 
alterations,  are  closely 
related  to  the  severity  of 
experienced  childhood 
abuse.

•  Somatoform  dissociation 
occurs  on all  levels  of 
overall  dissociation 
severity.

•  Some  subjects  with  a 

history  extreme  childhood 
maltreatment  do  not 
develop  dissociative 
symptoms,  while  some 
subjects  with  extreme 
dissociative  symptoms do 
not  report any  childhood 
maltreatment.

ABSTRACT
Background:  While  several  studies  documented  a  positive  correlation  between  childhood 
maltreatment  severity  and  dissociation  severity,  it  is  currently  unknown  whether  specific 
dissociative  symptoms  cluster  together  among  individuals  with  childhood  trauma  histories 
ranging from none to severe.
Objective:  We  aimed  to  explore  symptom  constellations  across  the  whole  spectrum  of 
dissociative  processing  from  patients  with  severe  dissociative  disorders  to  healthy  controls 
and relate these to maltreatment severity and sociodemographic characteristics.
Methods:  We  employed  latent  profile  analysis  to  explore  symptom  profiles  based  on  five 
subscales,  measuring  absorption,  depersonalization,  derealization,  somatoform  and  identity 
items  of  the  German  short  version  of  the  Dissociative 
alteration,  based  on  the  20 
Experiences Scale-II (Fragebogen  zu  Dissoziativen  Symptomen-20) in a large aggregate sample 
(n = 3,128)  overrepresenting  patients  with  trauma-related  disorders.  We  then  related  these 
profiles  to  maltreatment  severity  as  measured  by  the  five  subscales  of  the  Childhood 
Trauma Questionnaire as well as sociodemographic characteristics.
Results: Based on the five FDS subscales, six clusters differentiated by symptom severity, but 
not  symptom  constellations,  were  identified.  Somatoform  dissociation  varied  in  accordance 
with  the  remaining  symptom  clusters.  The  cluster  with  the  highest  overall  symptom  severity 
entailed  nearly  all  subjects  diagnosed  with  Dissociative 
Identity  Disorder  and  was 
characterized  by  extreme  levels  of  childhood  maltreatment.  Both  abuse  and  neglect  were 
predictive of cluster membership throughout.
Conclusions: The higher the severity of dissociative processing in a cluster, the more subjects 
reported  high  severity  and  multiplicity  of  childhood  maltreatment.  However,  some  subjects 
remain  resilient  to  the  development  of  dissociative  processing  although  they  experience 
extreme childhood maltreatment.

Constelaciones  diferenciales  de  síntomas  disociativos  y  su  asociación 
con el trauma infantil  – un análisis de perfil latente  

Antecedentes:  Aunque  varios  estudios  han  documentado  una  correlación  positiva  entre  la 
severidad  del  maltrato  infantil  y  la  severidad  de  la  disociación,  actualmente  se  desconoce  si 
los  síntomas  disociativos  específicos  se  agrupan  entre  individuos  con  historias  de  trauma 
infantil que van desde ninguno a severo.
Objetivo:  Nos  propusimos  explorar  las  constelaciones  de  síntomas  en  todo  el  espectro  del 
procesamiento  disociativo  de  pacientes  con  trastornos  disociativos  graves  y  controles  sanos, 
y relacionarlas con la gravedad del maltrato y las características sociodemográficas.
Métodos: Se empleó el análisis de perfil latente para explorar los perfiles de síntomas basados 
en  cinco  subescalas,  que  miden 
la  absorción,  despersonalización,  desrealización, 
somatomorfos  y  alteración  de  la  identidad,  basados  en  los  20  ítems  de  la  versión  corta 
alemana de la Escala de Experiencias Disociativas-II (Fragebogen  zu  Dissoziativen  Symptomen- 
20)  en  una  gran  muestra  agregada  (n = 3.128)  sobrerrepresentada  por  pacientes  con 
trastornos  relacionados  con  el  trauma.  Luego  relacionamos  estos  perfiles  con  la  gravedad 
del  maltrato,  medida  por  las  cinco  subescalas  del  Cuestionario  de  Trauma  Infantil,  así  como 
con las características sociodemográficas.
Resultados:  Sobre  la  base  de  las  cinco  subescalas  de  la  FDS,  se  identificaron  seis  clústeres 
diferenciados  por  la  gravedad  de  los  síntomas,  pero  no  por  constelaciones  de  síntomas.  La 
disociación  somatomorfa  varió  de  acuerdo  con  los  grupos  de  síntomas  restantes.  El  clúster

con la mayor gravedad sintomática global incluía a casi todos los sujetos diagnosticados con 
Trastorno  de  Identidad  Disociativo  y  se  caracterizaba  por  niveles  extremos  de  maltrato  en  la 
infancia.  Tanto  el  maltrato  como  la  negligencia  fueron  predictivos  de  la  pertenencia  al 
clúster en todo momento.
Conclusiones: Cuanto mayor era la severidad del procesamiento disociativo en un clúster, más 
sujetos  reportaban  una  alta  severidad  y  multiplicidad  de  maltrato  infantil.  Sin  embargo, 
algunos  sujetos  permanecen  resilientes  al  desarrollo  del  procesamiento  disociativo,  aunque 
experimenten maltrato infantil extremo.

1.  Introduction

Dissociative experiences occur in the majority of men-
tal  disorders  (Lyssenko  et  al.,  2018)  and  can  best  be 
conceptualized  as  a  transdiagnostic  phenomenon. 
However, just like most mental disorders (Carr et al., 
2013; Dvir et al., 2014), the frequency of their occur-
rence is associated with the extent to which individuals 
have suffered traumatic events, especially in childhood 
(Rafiq  et  al.,  2018;  Vonderlin  et  al.,  2018).  Conver-
gently,  the  average  dissociation  severity  per  person, 
as  measured  with  the  most  commonly  employed 
assessment  instrument  for  dissociation  Dissociative 
Experiences  Scale  (DES-II;  Carlson  &  Putnam,  1993), 
is  found  to  be  highest  in  patients  suffering  from 
trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress 
disorder  (PTSD; see  White  et  al., 2022 for  meta-ana-
lytic  evidence  for  the  dissociative  subtype,  e.g.  as 
identified by latent class analyses), borderline person-
ality disorder (BPD) and dissociative disorders (DD), 
(DID; 
especially  dissociative 
Lyssenko  et  al.,  2018).  Because  most  studies  exclu-
sively  employed  the  DES-II  total  severity  score  to 
investigate the association with traumatic experiences, 
little  attention  has  been  paid  to  whether  specific  dis-
sociation  symptom  constellations  are  associated  with 
specific forms of childhood trauma.

identity  disorder 

A  recent  meta-analysis  indicated  that  all  forms  of 
childhood  trauma,  including  both  accidental  trauma 
and  interpersonal  trauma  such  as  neglect  and  abuse 
experiences,  are  associated  with  overall  dissociation 
severity among patients with severe mental disorders 
(Rafiq  et  al.,  2018).  Similarly,  another  meta-analysis 
(Vonderlin  et  al.,  2018)  indicated  that  both  abuse 
and neglect experiences are associated with overall dis-
sociation  in  the  general  population  and  in  patients 
with  less  severe  mental  disorders,  with  strongest 
associations for sexual and physical abuse. In addition, 
earlier  age  of  onset,  longer  duration  of  abuse,  and 
abuse  committed  by  a  parent  were  associated  with 
substantially  higher  dissociation  scores.  Multiplicity 
of  childhood  trauma,  i.e.  exposure  to  more  than  one 
form  of  maltreatment,  has  equally  been  associated 
with  increased  dissociation  severity  (Schalinski  et  al., 
2016).

However,  associations  between  childhood  trauma 
experiences  and  the  DES-II  total  score  might  not  be 
very  elucidating,  given  that  this  scale  should  not  be 

assumed to be unidimensional: most studies indicated 
a  two-factor,  three-factor,  or  four-factor  structure 
both  within  and  across  different  languages  and  Wes-
tern  cultures  (Amdur  &  Liberzon, 1996;  Darves-Bor-
noz  et  al.,  1999;  Espirito  Santo  &  Abreu,  2009;  Larøi 
et  al.,  2013;  Lipsanen  et  al.,  2003;  Mazzotti  et  al., 
2016; Ross et al., 1991; Ruiz et al., 2008; Schimmenti, 
2016;  Soffer-Dudek  et  al.,  2015;  Stockdale  et  al., 
2002).  Doubts  regarding  the  unidimensional  nature 
of  dissociative  experiences  as  measured  with  the 
DES-II are further supported by a correlation network 
analysis, which yielded a representation as a network 
of several layers of dissociative symptoms that interact 
with  each  other  (Schimmenti  &  Sar,  2019).  In 
addition,  somatoform  symptoms  of  dissociation, 
which  are  not  covered  by  the  DES-II,  have  also  been 
associated  with  childhood  trauma  (Cheung  et  al., 
2023;  Maaranen  et  al.,  2004;  Mueller-Pfeiffer  et  al., 
2010).

Given  the  evidence  that  dissociative  experiences 
might best not be conceptualized as a unidimensional 
construct,  it  is  of  interest  to  know  whether  specific 
subsets of dissociation symptoms preferentially appear 
together,  yielding  differential  symptom  profiles  that 
individuals  may  show,  and  whether  these  subsets 
show  a  particularly  strong  association  with  specific 
childhood  trauma  experiences.  The  fact  that  this  is 
currently unknown is surprising in itself. Dissociative 
symptoms in the realm of identity fragmentation and 
the  ensuing  dissociative  amnesia  are  thought  to  be 
limited  to  DID  and  dissociative  disorders  not  other-
wise  specified,  which  in  turn  are  thought  to  stem 
specifically 
from  very  severe  childhood  abuse, 
especially  sexual  abuse  (Putnam  et  al.,  1986;  Ross, 
1991;  Schroder  et  al.,  2018;  Wabnitz  et  al.,  2013).  To 
our  knowledge,  only  one  previous  study  (Millman 
et al., 2021) studied such profiles of dissociative symp-
toms, but this study exclusively included subjects diag-
nosed  with  depersonalization-derealization  disorder. 
In  this  study,  subscale  scores  on  three  different  dis-
sociation  questionnaires  as  well  as  an  anxiety  ques-
tionnaire  were  entered  into  a  latent  class  analysis. 
Besides  three  classes  differentiated  solely  by  severity, 
two classes emerged that were similar in overall sever-
ity,  but  differed  regarding  their  symptom  constella-
tion,  with  one  class  scoring  much  higher  on 
symptoms of identity fragmentation such as amnesia, 

and  the  other  class  scoring  much  higher  on  somato-
form  symptoms.  However,  as  depersonalization- 
derealization disorder is the one dissociative disorder 
that  frequently  shows  very  weak  associations  with 
childhood trauma (Baker et al., 2003; Michal & Beutel, 
2009; Sierk et al., 2018), this class solution might not 
generalize to other patient populations.

1.1.  Aims  of  the  study

As it is currently unknown whether specific dissocia-
tive  symptoms  cluster  together  in  individuals  with 
differential  childhood  trauma  histories,  we  opted  to 
employ latent profile analysis (see e.g. Oberski, 2016) 
to  explore  symptom  profiles  based  on  five  FDS  sub-
scales,  measuring  absorption,  depersonalization, 
derealization, somatoform dissociation as well as iden-
tity  alteration  based  on  the  20  items  of  the  German 
short version  of the  Dissociative  Experiences Scale-II 
(Fragebogen  zu  Dissoziativen  Symptomen-20)  across 
a large aggregate sample representing the whole spec-
trum  from  patients  with  severe  mental  disorders  to 
healthy controls. A latent profile analysis reveals clus-
ters  of  individuals  with  distinct  symptom  profiles.  In 
addition, we hypothesized that dissociative symptoms 
related to identity fragmentation would be associated 
with (1) more severe childhood abuse, especially sex-
ual and physical abuse, than symptoms of absorption, 
depersonalization,  or  derealization  and  (2)  a  higher 
prevalence of trauma-related disorders, especially dis-
sociative disorders (Rodewald et al., 2011).

2.  Methods

We  present  aggregated  data  (n = 3,128)  derived  from 
six separate samples of German-speaking participants. 
Two  samples  (Samples  1  &  2)  were  assessed  anon-
ymously online and four samples consisted of patients 
treated for mental disorders assessed in their respect-
ive  treatment  facilities  (Samples  3–6).  These  samples 
were  selected  to  ensure  (1)  a  broad  representation 
across  the  psychopathology  continuum  including 
healthy  subjects  as  well  as  (2)  an  oversampling  of 
patients  with  trauma-related  and  dissociative  dis-
orders  for  sufficient  statistical  power  to  detect  sub-
group-specific symptom patterns.

We  included  one  sample  that  was  population- 
representative  with  regard  to  sex,  age,  and  education 
(Sample  1:  n = 573).  The  majority  of  this  sample  (n  
= 463)  was  never  diagnosed  with  a  mental  disorder. 
Three  samples  consisted  predominantly  of  patients 
treated  for  disorders  other  than  trauma-related  dis-
orders (Sample 4: n = 208; Sample 5: n = 1602; Sample 
6:  n = 532).  Two  samples  predominantly  consisted  of 
patients  treated  for  trauma-related  disorders,  includ-
ing  dissociative  disorders  (Sample  2:  n = 116,  Sample 
3: n = 97).

Each  study  contained  several  additional  instru-
ments,  which  are  not  covered  here.  Participants  pro-
vided  sociodemographic  information  regarding  their 
age,  gender,  level  of  education,  and  current  employ-
ment  status.  Clinical  diagnoses  of  mental  disorders 
were  either  reported  by  the  participants  themselves 
(Samples 1 & 2) or by their clinicians (Samples 3–6). 
As such, the clinical diagnoses were not independently 
confirmed by the researchers. Sociodemographic data 
were  assessed  in  slightly  different  ways  in  the  six 
studies and were harmonized post-hoc for their joint 
analysis.  For  details  on  the  samples  and  harmoniza-
tion,  we  refer  to  the  supplementary  material  (SM1, 
Table S1, and SM2). No values were imputed. Studies 
were approved by local ethics boards (see supplement 
for details) and participants were informed about the 
proceedings of the respective study and consented to 
study participation.

2.1.  Assessment  instruments

The Fragebogen zu Dissoziativen Symptomen (FDS-20) 
was  employed  to  assess  dissociation  severity  (Spitzer 
et  al.,  2004).  This  German  questionnaire  consists  of 
20 items, of which 15 were translated from the Disso-
ciative  Experiences  Scale-II  (DES-II,  Carlson  &  Put-
nam,  1993).  In  its  development,  16  items  covering 
somatoform dissociation were added to the full DES- 
II.  Subsequently,  the  short-form  instrument  with  20 
items was developed, which contains five somatoform 
dissociation items not included in the original DES-II 
scale (Spitzer et al., 2015). These five items were trea-
ted as one subscale. In accordance with expert ratings 
(provided  in  Mazzotti  et  al.,  2016)  and  the  classifi-
cation in the Structured Clinical Interview for Dissocia-
tive Disorders (Steinberg et al., 1991), the remaining 15 
items  were  structured  into  four  subscales  (see  Sup-
plement):  absorption,  depersonalization,  derealiza-
tion,  and  identity  alterations  (as  a  measure  of 
identity  fragmentation).  All  items  were  rated  on  an 
11-point  scale  from  0  percent  (never)  to  100  percent 
(always), indicating how often the symptom occurred. 
The five subscale scores were computed as the mean of 
the respective items . The total questionnaire showed 
good  internal  consistency  in  the  current  sample  (α  
= .94).  The  subscales  all  showed  acceptable/good 
internal consistency (Absorption: α = .77; Depersona-
lization: α = .83; Derealization: α = .77; Somatoform: α  
= .85, Identity: α = .76). The latent profile analysis was 
executed on the five subscales and a total mean score 
was computed for the sample characterization.

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bern-
stein et al., 2003; German version by Wingenfeld et al., 
2010) comprises 25 items, which assess the frequency 
of  instances  of  emotional  abuse  (EA),  physical  abuse 
(PA),  sexual  abuse  (SA),  emotional  neglect  (EN), 
and  physical  neglect  (PN)  in  childhood  on  a  5-point

Likert  scale  ranging  from  1  ‘Never  true’  to  5  ‘Very 
often  true’.  (An  additional  three  items  assess  denial, 
and  since  they  are  beyond  our  research  interests 
these are excluded from the analyses here.) Summing 
the  five  items  per  subscale  yields  a  subscale  score 
(possible score range 5–25), indicating the severity of 
the  form  of  maltreatment  involved.  The  sum  of  the 
five  subscales  gives  the  CTQ  total  score,  providing 
an  overall  indication  of  severity  of  maltreatment. 
The  subscales  and  total  scale  were  computed  for  the 
sample characterization. Subscale scores were unavail-
able  for  one  participant  on  the  emotional  abuse  sub-
scale  and  for  two  participants  on  the  sexual  abuse 
subscale. The subscales have shown good internal con-
sistency  with  exception  of  the  subscale  ‘physical 
neglect’  (Wingenfeld  et  al.,  2010),  which  was  repli-
cated with the current data (PN: α = .49, all other sub-
scales between α = .90 – .97; Total scale α = .87; based 
on n = 1,526, no data available for Sample 5). For the 
interpretation  of  differences  between  the  clusters,  we 
employed  the  established  cut-off  scores  (Walker 
et al., 1999; see supplement for details) for the ‘clinical 
range’.  To  further  characterize  the  clusters  we  com-
puted  multiplicity scores by summing the number of 
subscales  on  which  an  individual  scored  above  the 
respective cut-off.

2.2.  Participants

Across  the  six  samples,  participants  were  on  average 
38.42 years old (SD: 13.20; Range: 17–76) and predo-
minantly  female  (2,038  females  (65.2%),  1,088  males 
(34.8%),  no  data  available  for  2  subjects;  see  Table 
S1  for  sample-specific  data).  The  largest  subgroup  of 
participants  were  single  at  the  time of  assessment  (n  
= 1469,  47.2%),  while  n = 1130  subjects  (36.3%)  were 
in a committed relationship, n = 376 (12.1%) were sep-
arated  or divorced,  and  n = 134 (4.3%) widowed.  For 
n = 18  individuals  (0.6%)  no  information  regarding 
their  relationship  status  was  available.  On  average, 
participants  reported  having  been  diagnosed  with 
1.55  mental  disorders  (SD:  1.26;  Range:  0–9).  Of  the 
full  sample,  n = 322  (10.4%)  individuals  reported 
suffering from PTSD, n = 611 (19.5%) from borderline 
personality disorder (BPD), and n = 133 (5.1%) from a 
dissociative disorder, of which n = 70 (2.2%) specified 
having  been  diagnosed  with  dissociative  identity  dis-
order (DID). At the time of assessment, 1,637 subjects 
(76.3%)  stated  that  they  were  fit  to  work,  while  509 
subjects  were  declared  unfit  (23.7%;  information  not 
available for 982 subjects).

2.3.  Statistical  analyses

Descriptive statistics were computed for the total sum 
score  on  the  FDS-20,  and  the  five  subscales  of  the 
the  FDS 
CTQ.  Bivariate  correlations  between 

subscales absorption, depersonalization, derealization, 
and identity alterations and each of the CTQ subscales 
emotional abuse (EA), physical abuse (PA), and sexual 
abuse (SA) were calculated.

To identify groups of individuals that show similar 
symptom  constellations  on  the  FDS-20  and  relate 
them to the different forms of childhood maltreatment 
as  measured  by  the  CTQ  and  individual  character-
istics,  latent  profile  analysis  (LPA;  Becker  &  Yang, 
1998; McCutcheon, 1987) using a three-step approach 
(Vermunt,  2010)  were  employed.  The  LPA  was  per-
formed with Latent GOLD 6.0 (Vermunt & Magidson, 
2021). Step 1 involved identifying the (latent) clusters 
underlying the five FDS subscales, while Step 2 and 3 
involved  relating  the  identified  clusters  to  the  CTQ 
subscales and individual characteristics.

In Step 1, the scores on the five FDS subscales were 
modelled  with  a  multivariate  normal  mixture  model. 
Herewith,  it  is  assumed  that  each  individual  belongs 
to  a  cluster  and  that  the  scores  on  the  five  FDS  sub-
scales  are  multivariate  normally  distributed  per  clus-
ter.  The  latter  means  that  each  cluster  is  fully 
described  by  the  cluster  means  of  the  five  FDS  sub-
scales,  and  their  variance-covariance  matrix.  Two 
types of models were fit, namely one with a diagonal 
variance-covariance  matrix  (i.e.  assuming  uncorre-
lated  FDS  subscales  per  cluster),  and  one  with  a  free 
diagonal  variance-covariance  matrix  per  cluster.  For 
both  types,  15  models  with  number  of  clusters  from 
one  till  15  were  fitted,  using  500  starts  to  reduce  the 
probability of ending in a local minimum. The num-
ber of clusters were selected using the Bootstrap Like-
lihood  Ratio  Test  (BLRT),  which  compares  model  fit 
between  k-1  and  k  cluster  models.  If  the  BLRT  indi-
cated  15  clusters  or  more,  the  model  with  the  lowest 
Bayesian  Information  Criterion  (BIC)  would  be 
selected.  If  this  would  be  the  model  with  15  clusters, 
then  a  scree  plot  of  the  BICs  would  be  inspected  to 
select the model with relatively low BIC with a limited 
number  of  clusters.  For  the  type  of  model  given  a 
number  of  clusters,  the  one  with  the  lowest  BIC  was 
selected.  The  BLRT  and  BIC  proved  to  be  the  best 
indicators  for  the  number  of  clusters  in  an  LPA 
(Nylund et al., 2007).

In Step 2, the posterior probability for each individ-
ual  belonging  to  each  cluster  was  estimated,  which 
allows  for  a  more  precise  estimation  of  the  relation-
ship between the cluster membership and the predic-
tors  as  it  takes  the  uncertainty  regarding  the  cluster 
membership  into  account.  In  Step  3,  these  posterior 
probabilities  were  related  to  several  potential  predic-
tors:  the  dichotomized  CTQ  subscale  scores  and  the 
multiplicity  score  based  on  the  clinical  cut-offs  as 
well  as  individual  characteristics  that  we  presume  to 
be  meaningfully  related  to  the  latent  cluster,  namely 
sex and clinical diagnoses of trauma-related disorders 
(i.e. BPD, DID, PTSD). This allowed us to test whether 

the  percentage  of  individuals  diagnosed  with  DID  is 
higher in the cluster(s) characterized by severe identity 
alteration than the remaining clusters (Hypothesis 2). 
We used a significance level of p < .05 / k(k-1)/2 (with 
k being the number of selected clusters) to correct for 
multiple  testing  per  predictor  throughout.  To  assess 
Hypothesis  1,  we  tested  whether  each  of  the  three 
CTQ  abuse  subscales  correlates  stronger  with  the 
FDS  subscale  identity  alterations  than  with  each  of 
the three the subscales absorption, depersonalization, 
or  derealization,  using  nine  one-sided  Z-tests  for  the 
difference  between  two  correlations  (correcting  for 
multiple  hypothesis  testing  by  taking  a  significance 
level of p < .05/9 = .006).

3.  Results

3.1.  Descriptive  statistics

Regarding  dissociation  severity,  the  FDS-20  mean 
scale  score  showed  a  mean  of  16.81  (SD = 17.05, 
Range:  0–100).  The  mean  FDS-20  correlated  signifi-
cantly  with  the  CTQ  total  score  (r = .41,  p < .001). 
The  majority  of  the  participants  (n = 2,149,  68.7%) 
scored  above  the  cut-off  on  at  least  one  subscale  of 
the  CTQ,  indicating  that  they  were  exposed  to  some 
type  of  childhood  maltreatment  (for  sample-specific 
data please see Table S1). The mean CTQ  total score

was  M = 53.11  (SD = 19.93,  Range:  25–125;  Subscale 
scores:  MEA = 12.18,  SDEA = 6.25;  MPA = 8.29,  SDPA  
= 4.85;  MSA = 7.99,  SDSA = 5.61;  MEN = 14.68,  SDEN  
= 5.99; MPN = 9.97, SDPN = 3.82).

3.2.  Clusters  derived  from  FDS  subscales

In Step 1 of the LPA, we identified the clusters, that is 
the groups of individuals that show similar symptom 
constellations on the FDS-20. The BLRT and BIC indi-
cated 15 or more than 15 clusters. The scree plot of the 
BIC values indicated six clusters for both model types, 
where the model with a free diagonal variance-covari-
ance matrix per cluster had the lowest BIC (see Table 
S2). This model was thus selected. For each cluster, the 
cluster  size,  the  mean  FDS  subscale  scores  (see 
Table  1)  and  the  within-cluster  variance-covariances 
(see Table S3) were estimated. The cluster sizes differ 
only slightly between the six clusters, with the percen-
tage  of  individuals  within  each  cluster  ranging  from 
13.4%  to  19.7%.  For  ease  of  reading,  we  present  the 
clusters  from  most  severe  to  least  severe  dissociation 
(see Figure 1), as indicated by the estimated FDS sub-
scale  scores  (i.e.  Cluster  5,  4,  1,  3,  6,  2,  respectively). 
We  included  statistical  comparisons  to  the  next 
lower  cluster  in  the  text,  the  remaining  statistics  can 
be found in Table S4.

this  cluster  as 

Cluster  5,  comprising  19.7%  of  the  sample,  shows 
extremely  frequent  dissociation  across  the  board 
(see  Figure  1).  That  is,  this  cluster  reaches  the  high-
est  mean  score  on  every  single  FDS  subscale  (vs. 
Cluster  4:  all  p < .001;  Cohen’s  d:  1.08–1.48),  with 
an  estimated  mean  FDS  scale  score  of  M = 45.7. 
‘Extreme 
Therefore,  we  denote 
Dissociation’.
Cluster  4 

is  characterized  by  frequent  dis-
sociation,  with  an  emphasis  on  derealization  and 
depersonalization  (vs.  Cluster  1:  both  p < .001; 
Cohen’s  d:  1.22–1.36).  The  mean  values  for  the  sub-
scales  measuring  absorption, 
somatoform  dis-
identity  alteration,  on  the  other 
sociation  and 
hand,  do  not  significantly  differ  from  the  next 
lower  cluster  (Cluster  1;  Wald(1) = 2.95,  p = .085, 
Cohen’s  d:  0.21;  Wald(1) = 0.98,  p = .320,  Cohen’s 
d:  −0.14;  Wald(1) = 0.49,  p = .480,  Cohen’s  d: 
−0.10,  respectively).  Therefore,  we  denote  this  clus-
ter  as  ‘Frequent  Dissociation’.

Cluster 1 exhibits elevated dissociation scores with 
significantly  higher  mean  values  for  all  five  subscales 
than the three remaining clusters (all p < .001, Cohen’s 
d:  0.74–2.09).  Therefore,  we  denote  this  cluster  as 
‘Elevated Dissociation’.

The  three  remaining  clusters  (3,6,  and  2)  all  fall 
into  the  low  dissociation  range  with  mean  FDS 
scale  scores  below  M = 6.0  (see  Figure  1).  Neverthe-
less,  they  differ  significantly  from  each  other  on  all 
subscales  (all  p < .001,  Cohen’s  d:  0.34–2.46),  with 
the exception of Cluster 3 and Cluster 6 not showing 
significantly different levels of derealization (Wald(1) 
= 3.46,  p = .063,  Cohen’s  d:  −0.15)  and  Cluster  3 
and  Cluster  2  not  differing  significantly  regarding 
depersonalization  severity  (Wald(1) < 0.01,  p = 1.0, 
Cohen’s  d:  0).  We  denote  these  clusters  as  ‘Low 
Dissociators’.

3.3.  Relating  the  latent  clusters  to  the  CTQ 
subscale  scores  and  individual  demographic 
and  clinical  characteristics

The individual posterior probabilities of cluster mem-
bership were related to the CTQ scores above cut-off, 
and  the  demographic  and  clinical  characteristic  (see 
Table  1),  and  their  differences  between  all  clusters 
were  tested  pairwise  (see  Table  S4).  Based  on  these 
results we characterize the clusters as follows:

The Extreme Dissociation cluster (Cluster 5) with 
the  highest  severity  of  identity  alteration  also  entails 
the  highest  percentage  of  participants  who  were  for-
mally  diagnosed  with  DID  (10.7%,  p < .001,  support-
ing  Hypothesis  2).  Across  the  whole  sample,  nearly 
all subjects with a diagnosis of DID (93.8%) are allo-
cated to this cluster. This Extreme Dissociation cluster 
also contains the highest percentage of subjects diag-
nosed with PTSD (23.5%; p < .001) and nearly half of 
all  subjects  with  a  diagnosis  of  PTDS  (44.9%)  are  in 
this  cluster.  In  addition,  a  higher  percentage  of  indi-
viduals  diagnosed  with  BPD  were  allocated  to  this 
cluster (35.3%) than all other clusters with the excep-
tion of Cluster 4 (Wald (1) = 0.05, p = .82). This cluster 
also has the highest percentage of female participants 
(77.1%;  significantly  higher  than  all  other  clusters 
with  the  exception  of  Cluster  4;  Wald(1) = 5.03,  p  
= .025).

Regarding  childhood  maltreatment,  the  Extreme 
Dissociation cluster has the highest percentage of sub-
jects  scoring  above  cut-off  on  every  single  CTQ  sub-
scale  (ranging  from  53.1%  to  85.2%,  all  p < .001). 
Consequently,  this  cluster  also  exhibits  the  highest 
level  of  multiplicity  (88%;  all  p < .001),  with  95.4% 
scoring  in  the  clinical  range  for  more  than  one  sub-
scale  and  29.5%  scoring  in  the  clinical  range  on  all 
five subscales concomitantly (see Table 1). On average, 

subjects in this cluster reported values above the cut- 
off on 3.5 of the five CTQ subscales.

However, across all subjects, the FDS subscale iden-
tity alteration did not exhibit a closer association with 
the  severity  of  abuse  than  the  FDS  subscales  absorp-
tion, depersonalization, or derealization. All bivariate 
correlations  were  between  r = .216  and  r = .388  (see 
Table  S5  for  details).  The  pairwise  comparisons  of 
the  correlation  coefficients  between  the  CTQ  abuse 
subscales  and  the  respective  FDS  subscales  did  not 
indicate  any  significant  differences  (all  tests  p > .02, 
see  Table  S5,  not  supporting  Hypothesis  1).  A  small 
minority  (4.6%)  of  subjects  in  the  Extreme  Dis-
sociation  cluster did  not  report  any significant  child-
hood  maltreatment,  meaning  they  scored  below  the 
clinical cut-off on all five subscales.

The  Frequent  Dissociation  cluster  (Cluster  4) 
comprises  significantly more  subjects  diagnosed with 
BPD  (vs.  Cluster  1,  Wald(1) = 23.28,  p > .001):  across 
the  whole  sample,  nearly  a  third  of  the  individuals 
diagnosed with BPD are in this cluster (29.5%). How-
ever,  it  does  not  entail  more  subjects  diagnosed  with 
DID  (vs.  Cluster  1,  Wald(1) = 0.69,  p = .40)  or  PTSD 
(vs.  Cluster  1,  Wald(1) = =.36,  p = .54)  than  the  next 
cluster.  The  Frequent  Dissociation  cluster  is  further 
characterized  by  very  frequent  childhood  maltreat-
ment, exhibiting comparable values as the next cluster 
(see  Table  S4  for  details).  Only  11.9%  did  not  score 
above the clinical cut-off on any of the CTQ subscales 
and multiplicity was high with subjects in this cluster 
scoring on average on 2.7 subscales above cut-off.

The  Elevated  Dissociation  cluster  (Cluster  1) 
entails  more  individuals  diagnosed  with  BPD  (vs. 
Cluster  3,  Wald(1) = 11.45,  p < .001),  but  is  compar-
able  to  the  next  cluster  with  respect  to  prevalences 
for  DID  (Wald(1) = 0.01,  p = .890)  and  PTSD  (Wald 
(1) = 8.15,  p = .004).  The  individuals  allocated  to  this 
cluster reported significantly more frequent emotional 
and sexual abuse in the clinical range (both p < .001), 
but  not  neglect  (both  p > .320)  or  physical  abuse  (p  
= .004) than the next cluster (see Table S4 for details).
The three Low Dissociator clusters (Clusters 3, 6, 
2)  also  exhibit  the  lowest  prevalence  rates  for  all 
three trauma-related disorders, with comparable per-
centages  of  individuals  diagnosed  with  PTSD  in  all 
three clusters (all p > .050) and slightly more individ-
uals diagnosed with DID and BPD in Cluster 6 com-
pared  to  Cluster  2  (Wald(1) = 27.17,  p < .001  and 
Wald(1) = 8.62,  p = .003,  respectively).  Regarding 
childhood  maltreatment,  the  proportions  of  individ-
uals  scoring  above  the  clinical  cut-offs  did  not  differ 
significantly  between  these  three  clusters  for  all  mal-
treatment  types  (all  p > .150),  with  the  exception  of 
emotional  abuse  (Cluster  2  exhibits  significantly 
lower  values  than  the  other  two  clusters,  both  p  
< .001, see Table S4). These clusters still each entailed 
a sizeable subgroup reporting maltreatment above the 

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY

threshold (lowest percentages in Cluster 2: emotional 
(32.7%),  physical  (24.0%)  and  sexual  (14.7%)  abuse, 
emotional (41.2%) and physical (59.7%) neglect), indi-
cating that individuals resilient to the development of 
dissociation are allocated to all three clusters. Overall, 
multiplicity was comparable between these three clus-
ters  (all  p > .022)  with  averages  ranging  from  1.7–1.9 
subscales above cut-off.

4. Discussion

The  current  analysis  provides  data  on  dissociative 
symptoms  in  a  diverse  sample  consisting  of  subjects 
never  diagnosed  with  a  mental  disorder  as  well  as 
in-  and  outpatients  treated  for  different  mental  dis-
orders.  The  sampling  successfully  overrepresented 
patients suffering from trauma-related  disorders (e.g. 
10.4%  were  diagnosed  with  PTSD  instead  of  the 
expected  2.3%;  Jacobi  et  al.,  2014)  and  subjects 
exposed  to  interpersonal  childhood  trauma  (CTQ 
sum  score  M = 53.1  instead  of  the  population-wide 
expected  M = 36.0;  Iffland  et  al.,  2013).  The  majority 
of  the  participants  (68.7%)  scored  above  the  cut-off 
on  at  least  one  subscale  of  the  CTQ  as  compared  to 
33.9%  in  the  population-representative  sample.  Con-
vergently,  average  dissociation  scores  were  also  sub-
stantially  higher  than  in  the  general  population  and 
in  patients  with  mental  disorders  in  general,  but 
lower  than  in  patients  with  trauma-related  disorders 
(Spitzer et al., 2015). Clusters mostly differed regard-
ing  the  overall  severity  of  dissociation,  with  few  dis-
tinctive symptom constellations emerging:

4.1.  Identity  fragmentation

The overwhelming majority (93.8%) of subjects diag-
nosed  with  DID  was  allocated  to  the  Extreme  Dis-
sociation  cluster.  Convergently,  this  cluster  also 
scored  significantly  higher  on  the  identity  alteration 
subscale than all other clusters, with the Frequent Dis-
sociation cluster only showing somewhat elevated, but 
not  high  levels  of  identity  alteration,  supporting  our 
second hypothesis. This is in line with the result of a 
recent meta-analysis indicating that symptom severity 
of identity alterations differentiates well between sub-
jects with and without a dissociative disorder (Mychai-
lyszyn  et  al.,  2021).  As  already  reported  by  previous 
studies, the occurrence of severe symptoms of identity 
alteration was associated with extreme childhood mal-
treatment  and  very  high  levels  of  multiplicity,  that  is 
the  co-occurrence  of  more  than  one  form  of  abuse 
and  neglect  (Dorahy  et  al.,  2014;  Webermann  et  al., 
2014).  On  average,  subjects  allocated  to  this  cluster 
score  above  the  cut-off  on  3.5  subscales,  meaning 
they  experienced  maltreatment  in  the  form  of  com-
bined  abuse  and  neglect.  However,  we  could  not 
confirm  a  stronger  association  between  the  level  of 

8 

J. K. DANIELS ET AL.

abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual) and the severity 
of  symptoms  of  identity  fragmentation  versus  symp-
toms  of  absorption,  depersonalization,  or  derealiza-
tion as stated in our Hypothesis 1.

4.2.  Depersonalization  and  derealization

The  second-most  severe  cluster  (the  Frequent  Dis-
sociation  cluster)  was  characterized  mainly by  symp-
toms  of  derealization  and  depersonalization,  but  did 
not differ significantly from the next cluster (the Elev-
ated Dissociation cluster) regarding absorption, soma-
toform  dissociation  and  identity  alteration.  This 
cluster  might  contain  subjects  that  would  otherwise 
have been characterized as exhibiting the dissociative 
subtype  of  PTSD  as  identified  in  previous  latent 
class/profile  analyses  (White  et  al.,  2022).  However, 
as we do not have data on this subtype differentiation, 
this  remains  speculative.  It  also  entails  a  higher 
percentage of subjects diagnosed with BPD, which in 
conjunction might point in the direction of a prepon-
derance of subjects suffering from emotion dysregula-
tion (van Dijke et al., 2018).

As expected, the majority of individuals diagnosed 
with  a  trauma-related  disorder  were  allocated  to  the 
two  most  severe  dissociation  clusters.  But  while  the 
individuals diagnosed with DID were overwhelmingly 
allocated to the Extreme Dissociation cluster, the sub-
jects diagnosed with BPD or PTSD were mainly spread 
over  the  two  most  severe  clusters. In  short,  the  diag-
nostic  labels  do  not  clearly  differentiate  between  the 
clusters,  which  might  be  due  to  the  fact  that  we 
allowed  multiple  diagnostic  labels  per  person  and 
comorbidity in this sample was high.

4.3.  Somatoform  dissociation

Somatoform symptoms co-occurred with the remain-
ing  dissociation  symptoms  on  all  levels  of  severity. 
This  is  interesting  as  it  indicates  that  the  occurrence 
of somatoform symptoms neither seems to be depen-
dent on the overall severity of dissociation nor child-
hood  maltreatment.  As  previous  studies  indicated 
that  somatoform  dissociation  also  occurs  more  often 
in  several  groups  of  patients  with  somatic  disorders 
such  as  migraines  (Schalinski  et  al.,  2016)  and  fibro-
myalgia (Bohn et al., 2013) as well as mental disorders 
not  typically  seen  as  directly  trauma-related  such  as 
eating disorders (Palmisano et al., 2018), the addition 
of  items  assessing  somatoform  dissociation  to  the 
screening  instrument  for  dissociation  seems  useful. 
Interestingly,  some  preliminary  evidence  exists  that 
points  to  a  role  of  emotional  maltreatment  (Brown 
et  al.,  2005)  in  the  advent  of  somatoform  symptoms, 
especially when combined with low family functioning 
(Cheung et al., 2023).

4.4.  Association  with  severity  of  childhood 
trauma

Across  clusters,  the  severity  of  childhood  maltreat-
ment follows a clear pattern: more severe dissociation 
was  associated  with  more  severe  maltreatment.  Few 
types 
associations  with  maltreatment 
specific 
emerged,  indicating  that  all  types  of  maltreatment 
are associated with the occurrence of dissociative pro-
cessing.  Interestingly,  the  cluster  exhibiting  the  most 
severe  dissociation  symptoms  (the  Extreme  Dis-
sociation  cluster)  also  included  a  small  minority 
(4.6%) of subjects who did not report childhood mal-
treatment severe enough to exceed any clinical cut-off. 
The  same  is  true  for  11.8%  of  the  Frequent  Dis-
sociation  cluster.  This  points  in  the  direction  of  a 
potential  etiology  other  than  exposure  to  childhood 
abuse  and  neglect  such  as  exposure  to  trauma  types 
not  covered  by  the  CTQ  like  peer  bullying,  trauma 
exposure during adulthood, or trauma-unrelated fac-
tors. This finding should be carefully replicated in an 
independent  sample  as  it  might  also  inform  the 
ongoing  debate  about  other  potential  etiological  fac-
tors, 
that 
including  neurobiological  aberrations 
might act as  a diathesis  (Daniels et al., 2015; Lotfinia 
et  al.,  2020;  Roydeva  &  Reinders,  2021).  In  line  with 
recent  meta-analyses  (Rafiq  et  al.,  2018;  Vonderlin 
et  al.,  2018),  we  did  not  identify  a  coherent  differen-
tiation  regarding  the  impact  of  abuse  versus  neglect 
experiences.  Hence,  neglect  can  be  considered  to 
have comparable associations with dissociation sever-
ity and symptom combination as abuse.

4.5.  Association  with  multiplicity  of  childhood 
trauma

In  the  current  sample,  multiplicity  was  the  norm 
rather than the exception. That is, the clusters showed 
average  numbers  of  CTQ  subscales  above  the  cut-off 
between  1.7  and  3.5,  with  the  an  average  of  2.4  sub-
scales in the clinical  range. Multiplicity also differen-
tiated  well  between 
levels  of 
dissociation  severity,  with  the  cluster  characterized 
by the most severe levels of dissociation also showing 
pervasive multiplicity of maltreatment.

the  different 

4.6.  Resilience  regarding  the  development  of 
dissociative  processing

The  three  clusters  characterized  by  low  dissociation 
frequencies  (Clusters  3,  6,  2)  each  contained  at  least 
76.1%  of  subjects  who  reported  at  least  one  form  of 
maltreatment. These three clusters also each contained 
sizeable  subgroup  of  subjects  who  experienced 
extreme  childhood  maltreatment,  scoring  above  cut- 
off  on  all  five  CTQ  subscales  (between  5.2%  and 
6.1%).  This  speaks  towards  the  capacity  to  remain 

resilient to the development of dissociative processing 
even in the face of extreme maltreatment. Thus, while 
there  is  a  strong  association  between  childhood 
trauma  and  dissociation  on  average,  this  confirms 
that  even  multiplicity  of  maltreatment  does  not 
necessarily lead to dissociation.

4.7.  Strengths  and  limitations

The main strength of this study is the size and compo-
sition  of  its  sample.  The  overinclusion  of  individuals 
suffering  from  trauma-related  disorders  combined 
with  healthy  subjects  and  clinical  samples  with  diag-
noses  outside  the  trauma  spectrum  provided  a  good 
basis to characterize the clusters. The main limitation 
of this study is the reliance on clinician- and patient- 
reported  clinical  diagnoses,  which  could  not  be 
confirmed  independently.  As  such,  the  characteriz-
ation of the clusters with regards to clinical diagnoses 
should  be  considered  preliminary.  In  a  similar  vein, 
the cluster solution per se awaits independent replica-
tion. As all our analyses are purely based on self-report 
data, the typical limitations apply, including concerns 
of over- (Merckelbach et al.  2017) and under-report-
ing (Beutler et al. 2020) of dissociative symptoms. As 
many of the participants filled out the questionnaires 
unsupervised,  their  adherence  to  the  instructions  or 
understanding  of  the  items  remain  unknown.  In 
addition, the usual concerns regarding the validity of 
ratings for items assessing amnesia apply, as ‘amnesia 
for the amnesia’ is a commonly observed phenomenon 
in  individuals  suffering  from  severe  dissociative  dis-
orders.  These  concerns  might  then  also  apply  to  the 
ratings  of  childhood  maltreatment  provided  by  sub-
jects  suffering  from  amnestic  periods  during  their 
upbringing.  In  addition,  the  chosen  questionnaire 
instruments  come  with  their  own  limitations,  such 
as  the  CTQ  neither  assessing  victimization  by  peers 
nor  more  subtle  forms  of  maltreatment  by  adults 
that  might  still  impact  the  development  of  healthy 
attachment.

5.  Conclusion

Across clusters, the overall severity of dissociative pro-
cessing  is  closely  associated  with  the  severity  of  the 
reported childhood maltreatment, so that more severe 
maltreatment is generally associated with more severe 
dissociation. However, there are notable exceptions: A 
relevant  percentage  of  subjects  exposed  to  even  mul-
tiple maltreatments seems to be resilient to the devel-
opment of dissociative symptoms. Conversely, a small 
minority  of  subjects  experiencing  severe  dissociation 
do  not  report  clinical  levels  of  childhood  maltreat-
ment.  We  believe  these  results,  in  line  with  previous 
studies,  can  further  inform  the  discussion  regarding 
putative  causal  mechanisms  inthe  development  of

dissociative processing  given  the  clear  dose–response 
relationship  with  childhood  trauma  severity  evident 
in  the  data.  This  dose–response  relationship  also 
holds for symptoms of fragmentation typical for Dis-
sociative Identity Disorder. It might therefore be advi-
sable  to  include  a  measure  of  dissociation  severity  in 
the  routine  clinical  assessment  of  clients  reporting 
exposure to childhood trauma.
