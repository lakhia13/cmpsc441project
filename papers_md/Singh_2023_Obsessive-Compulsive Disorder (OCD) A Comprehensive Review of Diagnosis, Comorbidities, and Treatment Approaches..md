Abstract
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder widely recognized for its recurrent
obsessions and compulsions, which may cause severe impairment worldwide. This review explores the
difficulties in diagnosing OCD, its comorbidities, and its treatment approaches. Psychiatry and neuroscience
face noteworthy obstacles in treating OCD, which is frequently misdiagnosed and inadequately addressed.
This illness, which causes upsetting symptoms that interfere with day-to-day living, affects not only adults
but also children and adolescents to a great extent. Despite the availability of multiple therapy methods,
such as pharmacological and psychological approaches, many patients exhibit resistance, emphasizing the
necessity for alternative therapies. OCD and other psychiatric conditions like bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder substantially overlap, highlighting the
complexity of mental health diagnoses. Furthermore, its comorbidity with these diseases further highlights
OCD's intricacy. Several therapy considerations have been mentioned, such as using larger dosages of
medications and combining different therapeutic approaches. Their association suggests possible common
pathogenic pathways between OCD and other psychiatric illnesses. The review concludes that, given the
significant number of people who still struggle with chronic symptoms, new treatment techniques and
ongoing research are necessary, even in the face of improvements in the understanding and treatment of
OCD.

Introduction And Background
Long-term recurrent thoughts (called obsessions), compulsive activities (called compulsions), or both can be
symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [1]. The chronic and prevalent condition known as
OCD is linked to significant disability worldwide. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are a group of
conditions that are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. They are now included in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, and the International Classification of Diseases,
Eleventh Revision. A severe and incapacitating psychiatric condition, OCD poses several difficulties for
neuroscience. The cortico-striatal circuitry's neurological correlates and hypotheses about an imbalance
between goal-directed and habitual behavior are analyzed and contrasted with metacognitive views [2]. The
underlying processes of these treatments are currently being investigated. In children and adolescents,
OCD is a debilitating illness characterized by a particular collection of upsetting symptoms, such as
stressful, time-consuming rituals (compulsions) and persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) [3]. Up to
2.5% of people will experience OCD at some point, resulting in significant morbidity [4]. The success of
treatments for OCD varies, but they include psychological, pharmaceutical, and surgical methods [4]. A
widespread, long-lasting, and frequently incapacitating disorder is OCD.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs and exposure and response prevention are the only proven first-line
therapies for OCD. Still, a small percentage of individuals do not react to either technique, and even fewer
achieve total remission [4]. Antipsychotic augmentation is the only pharmaceutical treatment for OCD with
significant empirical support, aside from SRI monotherapy [5]. About 1% and 1.5% of adult males and
females, respectively, suffer from obsessions or compulsions that result in social dysfunction or emotional
misery [6]. Most adults with OCD have ongoing issues, whereas the other half experience episodes  [6]. There
were no appreciable variations in the intensity of the majority of anxiety symptoms between the groups of
patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and OCD diagnoses [7]. Despite the enormous benefits
reportedly associated with memantine augmentation, the routine use of memantine as an augmentation
agent for OCD cannot be recommended yet [8]. The perception of the absurdity of obsessive thoughts and
the knowledge that OCD symptoms never go away is rooted in incompleteness and depersonalization [9].
This narrative review article attempts to provide a thorough analysis of the current understanding of OCD,
including its impact on various age groups, treatment approaches, and hereditary interactions. It also covers

current knowledge, which could lead to improved diagnostic and treatment strategies.

Review
Search methodology

A methodical approach using the major databases PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google
Scholar was used in the search methodology for the comprehensive review of OCD. Psychiatric disorders,
neuropsychiatric disorders, diagnosis, comorbidities, treatment methods, OCD, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) were among the terms included in the search technique, which combined medical subject
headings (MeSH) phrases with keywords. Articles about OCD diagnosis, comorbidities, and treatment
strategies were included in the inclusion criteria. These included research with adult and pediatric
populations, investigations into neurological correlates, and talks about co-occurring mental disorders. The
exclusion criteria ruled out articles with little or no information on the stated themes, research only on
animal models, and studies not written in English. Initial screening of abstracts and titles was part of the
research selection procedure. A full-text examination of papers that might be relevant was then conducted
to determine eligibility based on eligibility and exclusion criteria. Next, for the chosen studies, data
extraction was carried out. This review is primarily a narrative review that incorporates both systematic and
narrative elements. Referencing and covering several facets of the condition, it methodically combines data
on the diagnosis, comorbidities, and treatment modalities for OCD. Overall, the material is better
understood because of the narrative components that add to a thorough overview and discussion of the
difficulties of OCD. This dual approach strengthens the review's structure and ensures a thorough
exploration of the chosen topics. The Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
flow diagram is presented in Figure 1.

OCD is a chronic illness characterized by uncontrollably recurrent thoughts (obsessions), repetitive
behaviors (compulsions), or both. Time-consuming symptoms are a common feature of OCD patients, and
they can seriously disrupt everyday life or cause significant discomfort [10]. A widespread and frequently
chronic mental condition that severely impairs a patient's functionality and quality of life is OCD. Excessive,

inappropriate, and intrusive thoughts that evoke anxiety, along with time-consuming compulsions that
significantly impair and disturb the sufferer, are the hallmarks of this condition [11]. The disease is not well
understood by the general public or the professional community, and feelings of guilt and shame frequently
accompany the symptoms, so evaluations that fail to consider these subtleties will frequently overlook OCD
and mistakenly assign its symptoms to mood or anxiety disorders, for which essential treatment differences
exist [11].

Furthermore, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be confused with the delusions of postpartum
psychosis. This can result in either failing to identify the latter as a psychiatric emergency or, more
frequently, in misinterpreting and overreacting to OCD, leading to inappropriate actions that may involve
engaging child services or a higher level of care than is necessary [12]. Recurring unwelcome ideas, pictures,
or cravings are called obsessions (egodystonic). Repetitive behaviors or mental activities carried out strictly
with regulations or to ease the anxiety associated with obsessions are known as compulsions [13]. Many
psychiatric diseases can be aggravated or precipitated by childbirth; however, most of the work published
thus far has been on mood disorders. Following childbirth, OCD may manifest by itself or in conjunction
with other mental illnesses, such as major depressive disorder [14]. OCD may be misdiagnosed or
underdiagnosed as a major depressive illness because patients and physicians are unaware of the connection
between OCD and delivery.

Understanding the complexity of OCD

Panic disorder, social anxiety, agoraphobia, particular phobias, and GAD are among the anxiety disorders.
Apart from the distinct indications of various illnesses, a shared sensation of anxiety and even dysphoria
could exist among them. Naturally, therapy with the same or combination of medications is the norm [15].
Comparing individuals with GAD to those with OCD, the severity of phobic disorders, conversion disorders,
cardiac autonomic dysfunctions, and hypochondria was significantly higher in the former group [15].
Anomalous, invasive sexual thoughts and pictures are a hallmark of OCD sexual obsessions. It is estimated
that 16.8% of people with OCD experience sexual obsessions [16]. The WHO has listed OCD as one of the ten
most incapacitating conditions [17]. The egodystonic aspect of OCD, which implies that those with it are
fully aware of how irrational or excessive their conduct is, has been proposed as a possible contributing
factor. The co-occurrence of other mental health issues with pediatric OCD increases the severity of the
ailment and the difficulty in treating it [18]. Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) effectively treats OCD and
depression and anxiety, two of its most prevalent comorbid illnesses [18]. As a result, treating OCD may also
help symptoms of anxiety and depression in the long run. The three most common and debilitating
psychiatric disorders are addiction, depression, and OCD, which have significant psychological and medical
costs and higher morbidity and mortality rates [19]. A comprehensive overview of anxiety disorders and the
multifaceted nature of OCD is shown in Table 1.

OCD and schizophrenia: diagnosis and treatment

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is becoming more and more popular as a treatment for addiction, OCD, and
depression; nevertheless, administering DBS can be difficult because of the intricate interplay of neuronal
circuits, the requirement for exact targeting, individual differences in brain anatomy, and potential adverse
effects [19]. Compulsive disorder is a significant mental condition that is more prevalent than others.
Treatment and diagnosis may be delayed due to the stigma and shame surrounding it and a failure to
recognize its telltale signs [20]. Schizophrenia is one of the mental illnesses that can exhibit obsessive-
compulsive-like symptoms. Descriptions of this date back to Kraepelin and Bleuler. This review highlights

the concept of pseudo-obsession, which is frequently overlooked. The idea can enhance diagnostic
procedures by helping to distinguish between genuine obsession in OCD and associated psychopathological
symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum illnesses [21]. Effective psychological and pharmacological treatments
are available for the distressing, time-consuming, repetitive thoughts and routines and the resulting
functional impairment [3,20]. The range of responses to the pharmacological treatment of OCD depending
on the type of symptoms, according to the analyses conducted, is not significant enough to support
psychotherapy, as well as surgical treatments [22].

Parental modeling is when an OCD-afflicted parent models problematic behavior patterns daily, which can
impact kids. Contrarily, family accommodation refers to the active involvement of parents in their child's
obsessive rituals through the modification of daily schedules or the facilitation of avoiding OCD triggers to
lessen the child's suffering and the amount of time spent carrying out compulsions [23]. Using medication
would be another method of treatment. Regretfully, antipsychotic drugs rarely help with OCD symptoms.
Antipsychotic drugs can be used to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia first. Treatment for obsessions
would then begin when the psychotic symptoms have sufficiently resolved [23]. Though not proven, it is
thought that some antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine, cause people to develop obsessions or exacerbate
pre-existing ones. Consequently, it is preferable to avoid giving this medicine to someone who is schizo-
obsessive if at all feasible [23]. When CBT alone cannot show sufficient progress in a child, medication with
an SSRI should be used. Doses should be at the higher end of the suggested range, and the child should be
monitored for at least 12 weeks before starting treatment [24].

Considering the limitations of available data and the requirement for drug safety monitoring, antipsychotic
augmentation may be an option for individuals not responding to treatment [23]. Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or cognitive behavior therapy combined with exposure and response prevention
is advised as first-line treatment [25]. SSRIs are the only medications that are helpful in monotherapy for
OCD [4]. Pharmacologic augmentation, thus, with additional medications, is standard in cases where SSRI
monotherapy is ineffective, provided there is convincing evidence that adding low-dose neuroleptics to
stable SSRIs is beneficial [4]. Although many different agents have been studied in this situation, it is
unclear whether they are beneficial. Virtually all of the primary psychiatric diseases are associated with
altered cortico-striatal systems and their modulation, which may also assist in explaining common
comorbidities of OCD like depression and schizophrenia, which have also been associated with altered
processing in these circuits [2]. To distinguish OCD from other diseases, it is crucial to identify the precise
cortico-striatal underpinnings of its symptoms, so determining which elements of these circuits' operation
result from significant "priors" like heredity or prior experiences like stressor triggers is equally crucial [2].

Treatment-resistant OCD can be managed with various approaches, such as combining an atypical
antipsychotic with SSRIs. There is ample documentation of the strong correlation between OCD and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly regarding ADHD in children with OCD. OCD
and ADHD frequently have chronic symptoms that last 40-50% of the time [26]. Bipolar disorder (BD) and BD
comorbid with OCD patients differed so significantly from one another in terms of psychopathological
characteristics (e.g., distinct mood episode onset, history of attempted suicide, seasonality, rapid cycling,
and impulsivity) that the comorbidity of BD and OCD may be a separate form of BD, akin to cyclothymic
BD [27]. Enhancing parent involvement, utilizing interactive, visual, or multimodal teaching strategies, and
incorporating special interests into sessions are some of the ways that empirically supported CBT programs
tailored specifically for young people with ASD and anxiety seek to improve child engagement,
comprehension, retention, and generalization of CBT skills [18,24]. Diverse treatment strategies and
interplay between OCD and other disorders are shown in Table 2.

Bipolar disorder (BD) and OCD

Significant differences between BD and BD comorbid with OCD patients regarding psychopathological characteristics suggest a separate form of BD akin to cyclothymic BD.

OCD: Obsessive-compulsive disorder

On the other hand, comorbidity does not appear to affect cognitive function; for example, there is no
discernible difference between people who experience OCD initially and BD, afterwards, or vice versa [27].
The significant comorbidity of OCD makes it familiar. Pharmacological and psychotherapy interventions are
typically used in combination for treatment. Nonetheless, 30% of patients experience severe chronic
symptoms with a significant functional impact [28]. Larger areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal and
posterior regions, may be involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, according to the data from functional

magnetic resonance imaging studies. It's also important to keep in mind that OCD is diverse and may
include several distinct brain systems that are connected to clinical elements like symptom severity [28].
Recent studies on OCD in neuropsychology and neuroimaging are reviewed in this review. We will also
discuss some recent developments in neurological modeling. Discoveries in these domains will update the
traditional biology model of OCD. A functional deficiency in the system for context-appropriate dynamic
arbitration between model-free and model-based decision-making may cause OCD's rigid dependence on
habit [29]. A noteworthy OCD prevalence in schizophrenia is higher than predicted based on computed
comorbidity statistics [27].

The hypothesized functional circuits of schizophrenia and OCD have much in common, which could result
in co-expression of symptoms [30]. People who suffer from OCD symptoms or schizophrenia symptoms may
benefit from antipsychotic drugs to treat these disorders; some psychiatrists may prescribe an antipsychotic
and an antidepressant; however, taking these drugs together might have dangerous side effects, including
seizures. Instead, other considerations, including the intensity of symptoms, the degree of understanding of
the condition, or the signs of co-occurring disorders with the obsessions, should be considered when
selecting a drug [30]. Neurotransmitter dysfunction overlaps, but intricate relationships exist, particularly in
the dopamine and serotonin systems [4,25]. Compulsions in OCD refer to the recurring behaviors you feel
obligated to carry out to alleviate or eliminate your obsessions. These obsessive behaviors are not
pleasurable for people with OCD and are not something they want to do. However, they believe their anxiety
will worsen if they don't complete them. But compulsions are only helpful in the short term. The
compulsions resume shortly after the obsessions reappear. Compulsions take up time and interfere with
valuable tasks that you enjoy doing. Put items in a particular order, such as the ones on your dresser.
Bathing, cleaning, or repeatedly washing your hands. Neurosurgery is a viable therapeutic option for those
with severe symptoms of OCD, along with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy
[1]. It may be possible to understand OCD further and enhance clinical results by combining translational
neuroscience methods with global mental health.

Conclusions
In addition to presenting distinct symptoms of compulsions and obsessions, OCD is a neuropsychiatric
condition that intersects with many other mental conditions. Due to its chronic nature, it has become one of
the most disabling illnesses and is receiving much attention from the international medical community. One
of the most important things to remember from the overview is that OCD treatment involves several
approaches. Although widely used treatments like SSRIs and CBT have proven successful, some patients still
exhibit symptoms resistant to treatment. This has prompted experts to look into the effectiveness of further
alternative therapies. Moreover, the broad co-morbidity of OCD with diseases such as BD, schizophrenia,
and ADHD emphasizes the complexity of psychiatric disorders and the significance of a thorough diagnosis.
The relationship between OCD and BD suggests possible common pathogenic pathways. Other complexity
includes the egodystonic aspect of OCD, in which sufferers acknowledge the absurdity of their behavior, the
importance of accuracy in diagnostic processes, and help prevent disorders like postpartum psychosis from
being mistakenly classified as OCD. Last, but not least, it's important to remember that even while progress
has been achieved in diagnosing and treating OCD, some individuals still experience symptoms,
emphasizing the need for continued study and the creation of novel treatments.
