Psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine have emerged as potentially effective treatments for rapid amelioration of the symptoms 
of mood and related psychiatric disorders. All clinical data collected so far with regard to psilocybin or MDMA, which have 
reported positive outcomes for treating depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and drug or alcohol use disorders, 
have involved clinician-assisted intervention. While the case for ketamine is assumed to be different, the first report of the 
successful use of ketamine in psychiatry for treating depression was in combination with psychotherapy, and an emerging 
literature suggests that the subjective state of individual experiences with ketamine predicts clinical outcome. This Review 
will focus on (a) a brief review of the literature, showing that the context or the process of drug administration has been an 
integrative component of published work; (b) the importance of clinical trials to compare the efficacy of the drug (“pill”) 
as a stand-alone treatment versus drug in combination with clinician-assisted psychological support (“process”); and (c) 
suggestions for future approaches in animal models that take into account the role of systems and behavioral neuroscience in 
explaining a potential role for context, experience, and expectancy in drug effect.

Introduction
Three  illicit  drugs  —  psilocybin,  3,4-methylenedioxymetham-
phetamine  (MDMA),  and  ketamine  —  have  emerged  as  “novel” 
rapid-acting psychotherapeutic aids for mental health treatment. 
These  compounds  are  not  novel  in  that  they  have  been  around 
for decades and used and abused for recreational purposes. The 
novelty designation refers to their clinical effects, which cause the 
field  to  question  much  of  our  understanding  of  the  mechanisms 
that  guide  pharmacotherapy  of  psychiatric  disorders.  First,  the 
clinical  efficacy  of  these  drugs  often  emerges  after  1  to  2  doses, 
and it tends to be rapid and long lasting (1–3). This is in contrast 
to  most  mainstream  pharmacological  approaches  where  either 
the effect emerges after several weeks of treatment — such as with 
classic  antidepressants  —  or  is  seen  transiently  when  the  drug  is 
on  board  —  such  as  with  benzodiazepine  treatment  of  anxiety. 
Second, their reported clinical efficacy is transdiagnostic: at least, 
with two of these drugs, positive clinical outcomes are reported in 
multiple conditions, including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders (SUD) (1–4). 
Third,  the  clinical  effect  of  these  compounds  may  be  impacted 
by the context in which they are received, by concurrent clinical 
interventions, such as psychotherapy, and by expectancy effects.

Use of these three compounds, which are often grouped under 
the umbrella term “psychedelics,” is receiving enormous attention, 
and  various  modes  of  treatment  employing  them  are  currently 
being tested. Our mechanistic understanding of how these drugs

exert their clinical efficacy, however, remains scant. This is, in part, 
because  many  of  the  basic  science  approaches  to  study  psychiat-
ric drug effects were designed to address the mechanism of action 
of  conventional  antidepressant  or  anxiolytic  treatments  (5,  6).  In 
the context of the therapeutic actions of psilocybin, MDMA, and 
ketamine,  a  critical  mechanistic  question  is  whether  drug  action 
alone, or drug interaction with the setting in which it is received, 
leads to positive effects on disease symptomatology. Here, we will 
outline the current state of the field, particularly as it relates to this 
issue, and identify future challenges in basic and clinical research 
for identifying the mechanism of action of these drugs.

Beyond psychedelics: reclassifying MDMA, 
ketamine, and psilocybin
The  term  psychedelics  traditionally  refers  to  three  classes  of  sub-
stances that include phenethylamines, tryptamines, and ergolines 
(7).  Examining  the  subtle  differences  between  these  classes  and 
their members is beyond the scope of this Review, but it is useful 
to keep in mind that a variety of compounds are included under the 
umbrella of psychedelic drugs. Classical psychedelics are general-
ly grouped together on the basis of their principal pharmacological 
mechanism of action, which is to bind as full or partial agonists to 
the  2A  subtype  of  the  serotonin  (5-HT)  receptor  (5HT2A)  (7–9). 
These  compounds,  however,  also  bind  to  several  other  receptors, 
serotonergic subtypes, as well as other types (7, 8). The most notable 
and well-known members of the classical serotonergic psychedel-
ics are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, the active 
compound in several mushroom species with psychoactive effects.
MDMA  and  ketamine  have  profoundly  different  pharmaco-
logical mechanisms of action and subjective effects despite some 
attempts  to  call  them  psychedelics.  MDMA  has  prosocial  and 
euphoric  effects,  and,  while  it  does  influence  the  serotonergic

potentially  producing  indiscriminate  activation  of  all  serotonin 
receptors  (10),  as  opposed  to  the  relatively  selective  activation 
of certain 5-HT receptors by classical psychedelics. Ketamine is 
an  altogether  different  chemical,  acting  chiefly  on  the  n-meth-
yl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors and hav-
ing a dissociative or anesthetic effect, depending on the dose (11). 
Thus, while these two compounds have in common with psilocy-
bin the potential for treating symptoms of psychiatric disorders, 
here we will refrain from grouping these rapid-acting psychother-
apeutics  under  the  arbitrary  label  of  psychedelics  and  instead 
focus  on  the  specific  features  of  each  drug  and  the  clinical  data 
that support their use as therapeutic agents.

Psychotherapeutic features of MDMA, 
psilocybin, and ketamine
MDMA.  MDMA  increases  openness  and  prosocial  behaviors, 
inducing  feelings  of  trust  and  emotional  connection  in  the  user 
(12).  These  qualities  naturally  led  to  the  idea  that  MDMA  may 
enhance the effectiveness of behavioral therapy by creating a state 
of  increased  openness  and  trust,  fortifying  the  alliance  between 
therapist and patient (13, 14).

Because  of  these  features  and  its  effects  on  reducing  fear, 
including  evidence  of  enhanced  fear  extinction  in  laboratory 
animals (15–17), MDMA was proposed as a possible therapy aid 
for PTSD (18). Current treatment options for PTSD include psy-
chotherapy as well as antidepressant and other forms of pharma-
cotherapy to treat specific symptoms (19, 20). A large proportion 
of  patients,  however,  do  not  respond  adequately  to  currently 
FDA-approved  medications  (18–20).  Moreover,  psychotherapy 
alone  is  ineffective  for  the  treatment  of  PTSD  in  a  substantial 
fraction  of  patients,  and  it  is  not  uncommon  for  symptoms  to 
persist for years or even decades (19).

Psychotherapy  assisted  with  MDMA,  however,  may  revolu-
tionize treatment of PTSD. The first phase II pilot study showed 
promising  results,  with  a  substantial  decrease  in  PTSD  symp-
toms, as assessed using the gold-standard Clinician-Administered 
PTSD Scale (CAPS) up to the last measured time point, 2 months 
after dosing (21). This landmark study effectively set the blueprint 
for most other clinical trials using MDMA by establishing guide-
lines  for  the  use  of  MDMA  in  combination  with  psychotherapy. 
These  guidelines  (22),  inspired  by  early  psychiatric  work  with 
MDMA and classical psychedelics (23), have been updated several 
times  and  are  available  via  the  Multidisciplinary  Association  for 
Psychedelic  Studies  (MAPS;  recently  rebranded  to  Lykos  Thera-
peutics). Briefly, patients receive two nondrug psychotherapy ses-
sions with a team of two therapists in the weeks before the exper-
imental sessions to both prepare them for the experience and to 
establish a relationship with the therapists. The experimental ses-
sions were conducted in the presence of the therapy team. Partic-
ipants reclined on a futon or sofa, were provided with optional eye 
shades,  and  listened  to  music.  The  psychotherapy  provided  was 
nondirective, and patients were encouraged to alternate between 
discussion  and  introspection.  The  duration  of  the  session  was 
determined  by  the  duration  of  the  drug  experience.  Several  oth-
er nondrug therapy sessions, known as integration sessions, were 
conducted thereafter.

This  model,  of  minimal  nondirective  psychological  support 
during  the  drug  experience  preceded  by  preparatory  sessions 
and followed by integration sessions, has been used in most clin-
ical trials of MDMA so far. A pooled analysis of six clinical trials 
compared control doses (placebo or 25 mg or 40 mg MDMA) with 
active doses (75 mg, 100 mg, or 125 mg MDMA). Five of these six 
trials used the psychotherapy model outlined above (24). Results 
showed a significant improvement in symptoms of PTSD after two 
psychotherapy sessions combined with a high dose of MDMA and 
a further improvement after a third session for participants who 
were offered and opted to receive it. The control groups also show 
improved  CAPS  scores,  though  the  magnitude  of  this  improve-
ment  was  smaller.  Notably,  these  improvements  were  shown  to 
last well beyond the drug sessions, with low CAPS scores up to 12 
months later in one study (25) and a follow-up study showing an 
enduring  effect  for  75%–90%  of  participants  up  to  7  years  after 
the sessions (26). The effectiveness and safety of MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy for PTSD has resulted in the approval of phase III 
clinical trials, the results of which were recently published (27, 28). 
These studies reported significantly reduced CAPS scores for par-
ticipants receiving MDMA-assisted therapy compared with place-
bo  with  psychotherapy  as  well  as  increased  incidences  of  loss  of 
diagnosis and remission. Following these successful trials, MAPS 
Public Benefit Corporation (a clinical-stage company) announced 
the submission of a new drug application to the FDA for MDMA 
used in combination with psychological intervention.

Psilocybin. While MDMA was not used formally in therapeu-
tic  settings  until  the  1970s,  the  use  of  classical  psychedelics  in 
research settings dates back to the years between 1943 and 1970, 
i.e.,  between  the  discovery  of  the  subjective  effects  of  LSD  and 
the  passing  of  the  Controlled  Substances  Act  by  the  Congress 
of  the  United  States  (29,  30).  Several  clinical  studies  were  con-
ducted in this period suggesting that psychedelics could be very 
powerful as a therapeutic aid. In contrast to the later work with 
MDMA, the therapeutic approach used in this work is often not 
well described. Although these trials are not up to par with mod-
ern standards, encouraging results were commonly reported (29, 
30). These early studies primarily employed LSD as the drug of 
choice, as it was more readily available than psilocybin. Modern 
day  psychedelic  research  has  instead  mainly  employed  psilocy-
bin, which has quickly become a candidate drug for the treatment 
of several psychiatric disorders, when used in combination with 
psychological intervention.

Clinical trials with psilocybin in the 20th century have largely 
focused  on  anxiety  and  depression.  Improvements  in  symptoms 
have  been  reported  in  patients  with  life-threatening  cancer  (31–
33),  and  an  open-label  trial  of  psilocybin  for  treatment-resistant  
depression  showed  a  significant  reduction  in  the  severity  of 
symptoms  following  psilocybin  sessions  (34).  Recent  trials  have 
replicated these findings in larger patient samples and increased 
our understanding of the parameters that result in improvement 
of  symptoms  (35–38).  First,  the  reduction  in  depression  scores 
depends on the dose of psilocybin, with only high doses conferring 
therapeutic benefits (37). Second, the amelioration of symptoms 
is long-lasting, with effects maintained for several months and as 
long as one year after the psilocybin sessions (39). Finally, two psi-
locybin  sessions,  three  weeks  apart,  improved  depression  scores

escitalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that 
is an established treatment for depression (40).

Psilocybin has also shown promise as a potential treatment for 
SUD and alcohol use disorders (AUD). This is once again in line 
with historical research with LSD, which was tested as a treatment 
for AUD in the mid-twentieth century (41). An initial pilot study 
with psilocybin showed encouraging results for patients with AUD 
(42).  A  later  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial 
showed  a  reduction  in  drinking  and  heavy  drinking  in  the  psilo-
cybin group that was significantly greater than that in the placebo 
group (43). Another study examined the use of psilocybin in combi-
nation with psychotherapy for smoking cessation. With the caveat  
that  this  was  a  pilot  study  with  a  small  number  of  participants 
and an open-label design, abstinence at 6 months and 12 months 
was maintained in 60% of participants, a percentage that is much 
higher than that achieved with current treatments (44, 45).

In  the  psilocybin  trials  for  depression  summarized  above, 
the  design  used  is  relatively  similar  to  the  one  pioneered  in  the 
MDMA-assisted treatment of PTSD. The support provided is non-
directive, and participants are encouraged to focus on introspec-
tion. Interestingly, clinical trials studying psilocybin in the context 
of SUD have not followed this model, opting instead to use cog-
nitive behavioral therapy during the psilocybin sessions (42–45). 
This may underscore the fact that the currently used standard for 
psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has largely been adopted from 
the  work  done  with  MDMA  research.  It  is  interesting,  however, 
that the subjective effects of these two drugs are substantially dif-
ferent. With MDMA, the prosocial effects provide a clear interpre-
tive framework to explain why the therapeutic alliance is strength-
ened. Similarly, its reduction of fear responses logically leads to its 
use in treating PTSD, where accessing and reprocessing traumatic 
memories is the accepted mode of treatment. In contrast, no such 
clear or direct connection between psilocybin’s subjective effects 
and its apparent therapeutic benefits has been put forward.

Ketamine. Using ketamine to treat depression and symptoms 
of other (nonpsychotic) psychiatric illnesses was first reported in 
1973 (46). Two physicians at the Pahlavi University in Shiraz used 
a low dose of ketamine in conjunction with psychotherapy, similar 
to the MDMA studies described above, in 100 patients who were 
hospitalized for a variety of psychiatric symptoms. They observed 
lasting  reduction  in  mood-  and  anxiety-related  symptoms  in  the 
majority of patients after six-month and one-year follow-ups.

This  research  did  not  get  much  attention,  perhaps  because 
at  that  time  the  preferred  way  of  treating  mood  disorders  was 
rapidly  shifting  away  from  psychotherapy  to  the  use  of  antide-
pressant  drugs.  Coincidentally,  the  first  report  of  the  discovery 
of antidepressant drug fluoxetine (Prozac) was in 1974 (47). Fast 
forward to 2000, when a report showed that a single low dose of 
ketamine can attenuate symptoms of depression in treatment-re-
sistant patients (48). This study was in only seven patients, and 
it  lacked  a  placebo  control,  but  it  was  remarkable  nonetheless 
because it questioned the accepted assumption that antidepres-
sants take several weeks to work. This limited study was followed 
by  several  large-scale  and  well-controlled  studies  in  patients 
with  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD).  These  studies 
showed modest but significant effects of ketamine on symptoms 

of TRD (49). This was an exciting finding because while a majori-
ty of patients respond to first-line treatments for depression (i.e., 
SSRIs or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), about 
30% present with TRD. Subsequent studies (50, 51) using intra-
nasal application of one of ketamine’s enantiomers, esketamine 
(Spravato), were promising enough to convince the FDA in Unit-
ed  States  and  the  European  Commission  to  approve  the  use  of 
ketamine for treatment of depression in 2019.

More  recent  clinical  trials  have  shown  a  range  of  strong  to 
weak to no significant effects in relieving symptoms of depression 
(49, 52, 53, 54). Unlike MDMA and psilocybin, ketamine is read-
ily available. This has led to booming business with hundreds of 
clinics  and  spas  that  provide  ketamine  infusions  to  treat  depres-
sion. There are concerns about its unregulated use with vulnerable 
individuals paying a lot of money for repeated ketamine infusions 
when,  in  fact,  we  have  limited  data  on  how  repeated  use  of  ket-
amine can influence the function of the human brain. The clinical 
long-term efficacy of ketamine appears to be highly variable (54). 
Moreover, repeated exposure to ketamine can lead to adverse and 
dangerous  peripheral  side  effects,  such  as  ulcerative  cystitis  and 
the so-called ketamine bladder syndrome (55). The need to repeat-
edly  administer  ketamine  to  maintain  antidepressant  effects,  or 
its limited or lack of clinical efficacy in many individuals, is hardly 
mentioned in media stories about the drug.

Despite recent safety concerns and low effect size in published 
clinical  trials,  ketamine  appears  to  have  impressive  antidepressant 
effects in some individuals with TRD. What explains the variability 
in its clinical efficacy? Clues can come from the original 1973 study 
that showed a sustained success rate when one or two low doses of 
ketamine were given to an in-patient population in conjunction with 
psychotherapy. This suggests that there may be a critical relationship 
between context and subjective drug experience and the therapeutic 
efficacy  of  ketamine.  This  is  supported  by  recent  reports  that  have 
shown a relationship between individuals’ subjective and emotional 
reactions to ketamine infusion and how well the symptoms of depres-
sion  are  treated,  though  this  effect  is  not  consistent  across  studies 
(56).  Notably,  data  from  patients  receiving  ketamine-assisted  ther-
apy shows benefits that may potentially outperform ketamine alone 
(57).  The  antidepressant  effectiveness  of  ketamine  may,  therefore, 
be related to the emotional and affective state of individuals at the 
time that they were receiving the drug. These findings clearly need 
to  be  replicated  and  several  ongoing  clinical  trials  combining  ket-
amine with psychotherapy in TRD are indeed ongoing. A recent study 
demonstrating that the antidepressant effects of ketamine adminis-
tered under anesthesia correlated better with the assumption of hav-
ing  received  ketamine  (versus  actually  receiving  ketamine)  further 
supports the idea that context and setting — in this case expectancy 
— may contribute to ketamine’s therapeutic efficacy (58).

Common neurobiological mechanisms for rapid-
acting psychotherapeutics
There  are  two  fundamentally  distinct  approaches  to  address 
whether  rapid-acting  psychotherapeutics  share  common  mech-
anisms  (Figure  1).  The  first  is  that  the  therapeutic  benefits  of 
MDMA, psilocybin, or ketamine are due to the drug action alone 
(“the  pill”).  The  second  is  that  these  psychoactive  drugs  modify 
how  context  and  internalized  information,  including  memories,

The Journal of Clinical Investigation   REVIEWFigure 1. Two potential paths for the mechanism of action of rapid-acting psychotherapeutics: the pill and the process. (A) In the “pill” model, ketamine, 
MDMA, and psilocybin produce their clinical efficacy by acting purely as pharmacological agents. In this view, their actions on specific receptors and 
individual neurons influence isolated brain networks that directly lead to behavioral changes and alleviation of symptoms. (B) In “the pill and the process” 
model, an interaction between the brain state and drug effect leads to engagement of new brain networks that lead to alleviation of symptoms in a con-
text-dependent manner. Thus, the receptor activity and other neurophysiological effects of these drugs produce an interactive network state that changes 
the ongoing and future computation of context, memory, or subjective states (such as states brought upon by concurrent psychological intervention). This 
interactive state will then result in a different mode of network engagement than the drug alone. In this model, positive effect on symptoms of psychiatric 
illness will, therefore, depend on the effectiveness of the coinciding intervention.

are encoded and processed by the brain (“the process”). While we 
have made excellent progress in establishing drug effect alone at 
molecular  or  cellular  level,  there  is  a  glaring  lack  of  information 
about  the  systems  and  behavioral  neuroscience  of  these  drugs 
when they are administered under different settings and experi-
ences. We explore these two questions separately below.

In  support  of  the  process.  While  with  MDMA,  the  literature 
clearly  supports  therapeutic  efficacy  when  the  drug  is  combined 
with psychotherapy, it is generally assumed that psilocybin or ket-
amine may work as standalone pharmacological agents. Ketamine 
has  been  used  without  clinician-assisted  therapy  or  controlling 
context in multiple clinical trials. While that may explain its widely 
variable results, the question of whether it alone can more effec-
tively  alleviate  depression  if  the  context  is  controlled  remains 
open  for  testing  (59).  A  recent  study  in  which  individuals  with 
TRD  were  given  ketamine  blindly  while  they  were  anesthetized 
reported similar efficacy between ketamine and placebo, suggest-
ing  that  expectancy  or  context  play  a  role  in  the  reported  thera-
peutic  effects  of  ketamine,  as  opposed  to  drug  effect  alone  (58). 
With  psilocybin,  the  literature  reviewed  above  makes  it  evident 
that all clinical trials to date have used a combination of psycho-
therapy or other forms of clinician-assisted psychological support. 
Moreover,  it  is  well  established  that  psilocybin  can  cause  deeply 
meaningful experiences, often described as “peak” or “mystical” 
experiences (60). There is mounting evidence that the occurrence 
and  strength  of  these  experiences  is  correlated  with  changes  in 
depression scores (61). This observation has led to the hypothesis 
that the subjective experience is causally related to the therapeutic 

outcome. The data available, however, are not definitive, as many 
plausible tests of this theory, such as administration of psilocybin 
(or MDMA) during anesthesia or in conjunction with memory-im-
pairing drugs, such as midazolam (62), have not been performed.

In  support  of  the  pill.  It  has  been  suggested  that  dissociative 
effects  of  ketamine  or  mystical  experiences  of  psilocybin  may 
simply be an epiphenomenon and that they may not be required 
for  the  therapeutic  effects  of  these  drugs  (63).  If  this  were  the 
case with psilocybin, 5HT2A-selective agonists that do not cause 
these  subjective  effects  could  be  a  promising  therapeutic  target. 
Whether  this  hypothetical  drug  could  be  as  effective  as  psilocy-
bin  in  reducing  symptoms  of  depression  or  anxiety  will  only  be 
determined by appropriate clinical trials. Regardless, even if such 
a compound were available, the question of whether it would be 
clinically effective without concurrent psychotherapy remains.

The idea that the subjective experience may be superfluous is 
based on the observation that fast-acting antidepressants (includ-
ing  psilocybin  and  ketamine)  may  share  the  ability  to  rapidly 
induce neuronal plasticity in the cerebral cortex (64, 65) and other 
forebrain  regions  (Table  1).  Psilocybin  and  other  5H2A  agonists 
(66) produce structural and synaptic plasticity in the frontal cortex 
and hippocampus of mice (67–69) similar to ketamine. It is, there-
fore, suggested that these forms of plasticity are a common mech-
anism that cause therapeutic benefits of psilocybin, ketamine, and 
other fast-acting antidepressants (70).

While  this  hypothesis  is  attractive,  it  should  be  underscored 
that there is no clear link between the observed effect of promot-
ing  plasticity  and  amelioration  of  depressive  symptoms.  In  fact,

increased plasticity may not always be a good thing: many other 
drugs produce similar patterns of plasticity in rodents, including, 
for instance, repeated exposure to amphetamine and cocaine (71, 
72).  In  fact,  drug-induced  structural  plasticity  in  the  prefrontal 
cortex was first described in 1997 in response to repeated amphet-
amine exposure (73, 74). Moreover, a recent study has questioned 
the  methodological  validity  of  reports  of  psychedelic-induced 
neuroplasticity  (75).  Nevertheless,  it  is  intriguing  to  hypothesize 
that rapid neuroplasticity induced by ketamine or psilocybin pro-
duces therapeutic effects by virtue of modifying how affective or 
cognitive  events  are  processed.  One  possibility  is  that  increased 
plasticity  is  related  to  enhancements  in  cognitive  flexibility 
that  have  been  observed  in  humans  and  rodents  upon  psilocy-
bin  administration  (76,  77).  Alternatively,  it  could  be  a  question 
of  reopening  a  critical  period  of  plasticity  relevant  to  traumatic 
memories, emotional processing, or development of the self (78). 
Importantly, if the latter is a relevant mechanism at work, psycho-
therapy would be an essential part of treatments involving these 
drugs,  which  would  focus  on  leveraging  the  impact  of  increased 
plasticity toward a positive clinical outcome (79).

This leads to another point for consideration: the therapeutic 
approach used so far in all clinical trials of psilocybin may not be 
the  most  effective.  Is  it  possible  that  an  approach  more  tailored 
to  leverage  the  subjective  effects  of  psychedelics  could  produce 
even  greater  benefits  for  depressed  patients?  Interestingly,  some 
ongoing  trials  for  SUDs  are  employing  therapeutic  approaches 
with well-established efficacy for the disorder in question, name-
ly  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (NCT05452772)  or  motivation-
al  enhancement  therapy  (NCT06225232,  NCT05995769).  The 
approach to use for depression and anxiety is less clear. Several pro-
posals have been made that align with the ideas above, i.e., to tai-
lor the therapeutic approach to the cognitive and subjective effects 
of  the  drug  (79,  80).  For  psilocybin,  this  may  mean  an  approach 
centered on behavioral flexibility (81) or focusing on interperson-
al dynamics (80). An important element of future clinical trials of 

psilocybin-assisted  psychotherapy  should  be  to  incorporate  com-
parisons of different therapeutic approaches in the trial design, in 
addition to comparisons of psilocybin alone versus in conjunction 
with specific psychotherapeutic approaches.

Moving forward: employing behavioral and 
systems neuroscience approaches
As mentioned above, there are comparatively more studies looking 
at the molecular and cellular effects of rapid-acting psychotherapeu-
tics than examining their effects on clinically relevant behaviors and 
neural circuitry, particularly in preclinical model organisms. There is 
a glaring lack of information about the systems and behavioral neu-
roscience of these compounds and particularly of psychedelics.

Ketamine and psilocybin have in common the ability to induce 
rapid  plasticity  (Table  1).  Ketamine  mediates  at  least  some  of  its 
effects  on  rodents  via  the  tropomyosin  kinase  receptor  B/brain- 
derived  neurotrophic  factor  (TrkB/BDNF)  pathway.  In  the  hippo-
campus, TrkB and BDNF are required for ketamine-dependent syn-
aptic potentiation, which correlates with antidepressant-like effects 
in mice (82). Interestingly, both traditional antidepressants (SSRIs, 
such as fluoxetine) and ketamine bind directly to TrkB (83). Recent-
ly,  a  study  suggested  that  plasticity  induction  via  activation  of  the 
TrkB/BDNF  pathway  may  generalize  to  LSD  and  psilocybin  (84), 
providing a potential convergent pathway for novel and traditional 
antidepressants, though this study awaits replication.

While these data inform us about the molecular pathways mod-
ulated by these psychoactive drugs, our understanding of the func-
tional implications at the levels of brain networks and behavior is 
very limited. Studies investigating the physiological effects of psy-
chedelics have begun to shed light on their effects on neuronal activ-
ity and neurotransmitter release, particularly in frontal cortex and 
some subcortical areas (85, 86). One issue is that a variety of com-
pounds have been used in these studies, such as LSD, 5-MeO-DMT,  
2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine  (DOI),  psilocybin,  and  oth-
ers.  However,  these  drugs  all  have  slightly  different  activities  at  a

rable their effects are when applied at a systemic, brain-wide level.
We suggest, as others have (85), that the field is in need of stud-
ies using in vivo neural recording methods in behaving rodents to 
further our understanding of the network-level effects of psilocy-
bin  and  other  psychedelics.  Systems-level  approaches  are  need-
ed to understand how the complex pharmacology of psychedelic 
drugs works to modulate neural network activity and, in turn, how 
this  produces  the  observed  behavioral  effects.  In  behaving  ani-
mals, neurons are not simply agents of linear signal propagation. 
Networks of neurons select, modulate, compute, and then gener-
ate adapted and specialized outputs — that are not a copy of the 
input — in a context- and cell- specific manner. Thus, controlling 
the “input,” as in stimulation of 5-HT2A receptor or inhibition of 
NMDA receptors, may not be sufficient to explain the systems and 
behavioral effects of these compounds. It is, therefore, critical that 
we investigate the activity of groups of neurons and how their col-
lective responses (e.g., synchronization, periodicity) are dynami-
cally influenced by these drugs in behaviorally active contexts.

Additionally,  while  theoretical  ideas  about  how  these  drugs 
work are needed and interesting, they should be accompanied by 
neuronal  data.  In  fact,  gaining  an  understanding  of  network-level  
effects  will  refine  our  theoretical  understanding  of  psychedelic 
action. For instance, a popular idea is that psychedelics that act as 
agonists at 5HT2A receptors increase brain entropy by relaxing the 
reliance  on  prior  beliefs  and  tipping  the  balance  toward  external 
inputs  (87).  However,  a  specific  test  of  this  hypothesis  in  rodents 
found  the  opposite  (88),  with  the  psychedelic  DOI  resulting  in 
reduced bottom-up sensory drive. This test may not be definitive, 
and it is certainly possible that different results would be obtained 
with other drugs or in other brain regions. But the point remains that 
it is essential to formally and rigorously test these hypotheses and 
formulate evidence-based ideas on the action of psychedelic drugs.
Finally, and most critically, there is a dearth of behavioral data 
with psychedelics in preclinical models. Moving forward, it is import-
ant to focus on novel behavioral approaches that have strong transla-
tional relevance and investigate the neural consequences of context 
or setting to acute and long-term drug effects. Ketamine and psilocy-
bin have so far been primarily tested in traditional rodent tasks that 
had been used for classical antidepressant screening. These tasks are 
useful to characterize learned helplessness and behavioral despair, 
as measured by the tail suspension test and forced swim test (though 
there are caveats about the latter, see ref. 89), as well as antianhe-
donic properties that interestingly for psilocybin appear to be inde-
pendent of 5HT2A receptor activation (69). Thus, there is a need for 
out-of-the box thinking, as these drugs may act by entirely different 
pathways than classical antidepressants and crucially by influencing 
behavior in a context-dependent manner. For instance, the evidence 
in humans and rodents showing an enhancement in flexibility with 
psilocybin (76, 77) may be translationally relevant if the interaction 
between  this  cognitive  change  and  concurrent  intervention  is  the 

key to the therapeutic effect. Another example is investigating con-
textual learning and “unlearning” associated with both aversive and 
rewarding outcomes, which may tap into memory mechanisms that 
are potentially modulated by these drugs.

Conclusion
Psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine have the potential of improving 
the quality of life in individuals with mood and addictive disor-
ders and whose symptoms have not responded positively to con-
ventional drug therapy. They also offer exciting new possibilities 
for  enhancing  our  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  biological 
basis of these symptoms, because they appear to be working on 
entirely  different  cellular  targets  and  brain  pathways  compared 
with  most  conventional  pharmacological  modes  of  treatment. 
Previous approaches of giving animals the therapeutic drug (such 
as classic antidepressants) and then observing what receptors or 
other proteins or neurons are affected in isolated systems has led 
to many debunked theories (such as the serotonin hypothesis of 
depression)  and  lack  of  progress  in  discovering  novel  therapeu-
tics. Moving forward, applying older behavioral approaches used 
in  studying  classical  antidepressants  to  these  drugs  may  not  be 
transformative because this will not address how these drugs are 
working  in  conjunction  with  psychotherapy,  context,  or  expec-
tancy.  Thus,  we  believe  the  field  will  benefit  from  focusing  on 
the study of how brain networks engaged in high-level behaviors 
(e.g.,  memory  recall,  executive  function,  social  behaviors)  are 
modulated by these drugs.

Finally,  we  highlight  as  a  note  of  caution  that  psilocybin, 
MDMA, and ketamine are all illicit drugs, which have abuse poten-
tial. Their misuse can be dangerous if not deadly. The problem in 
advancing  these  drugs  as  therapies  stems,  in  part,  from  the  fact 
that they are considered “recreational” drugs. The hype that they 
“cure”  depression  or  PTSD  may  add  to  the  glamour  of  their  use 
and give the false impression that, just like self-medicating phys-
ical pain with aspirin or acetaminophen, one can cure psychiatric 
symptoms simply by taking them as needed. Moreover, the diffi-
culty  in  controlling  compound  purity  and  dosage  can  add  to  the 
dangers of the self-medication approach, especially as higher doses 
of any of these three drugs can produce entirely different and often 
deleterious effects. The clinical data reviewed here indicates that, 
in the right setting and under appropriate clinical care, these drugs 
can relieve symptoms in some individuals who have not responded 
to conventional treatments. It is, therefore, imperative that infor-
mation about how these drugs work is clear and precise and that 
their recommended use remains cautious and evidence based, so 
that they remain available and safe for those who need them.
