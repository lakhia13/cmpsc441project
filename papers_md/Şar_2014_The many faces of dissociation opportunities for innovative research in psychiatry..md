The  Many  Faces  of  Dissociation:  Opportunities  for  Innovative  Research  in 
Psychiatry

It has been claimed that the progress of psychiatry has lagged behind that of other medical disciplines over the last few decades. 
This may suggest the need for innovative thinking and research in psychiatry, which should consider neglected areas as topics 
of interest in light of the potential progress which might be made in this regard. This review is concerned with one such field 
of psychiatry: dissociation and dissociative disorders. Dissociation is the ultimate form of human response to chronic devel-
opmental stress, because patients with dissociative disorders report the highest frequency of childhood abuse and/or neglect 
among all psychiatric disorders. The cardinal feature of dissociation is a disruption in one or more mental functions. Dissociative 
amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, identity confusion, and identity alterations are core phenomena of dissociative psycho-
pathology which constitute a single dimension characterized by a spectrum of severity. While dissociative identity disorder (DID) 
is the most pervasive condition of all dissociative disorders, partial representations of this spectrum may be diagnosed as dis-
sociative amnesia (with or without fugue), depersonalization disorder, and other specified dissociative disorders such as sub-
threshold DID, dissociative trance disorder, acute dissociative disorders, and identity disturbances due to exposure to oppression. 
In addition to constituting disorders in their own right, dissociation may accompany almost every psychiatric disorder and operate 
as a confounding factor in general psychiatry, including neurobiological and psycho-pharmacological research. While an an-
ti-dissociative drug does not yet exist, appropriate psychotherapy leads to considerable improvement for many patients with 
dissociative disorders.

chiatric disorders.

There are claims that psychiatry has made insufficient 
progress comparative to that of other medical specialties 
which have benefited from developments in science and 
technology throughout the last few decades in particular. 
This may suggest the need for innovative thinking and re-
search  in  psychiatry,  which  should  consider  neglected 
areas as topics of interest in light of the potential progress 
which might be made in this regard. This review is con-
cerned with one such field of psychiatry: dissociation and 
dissociative disorders. Dissociation is the ultimate form of 
human response to chronic developmental stress, because 
patients with dissociative disorders report the highest fre-
quency of childhood abuse and/or neglect among all psy-

Since the second half of the 20th century, psychiatry has 
been  moving  toward  an  atheoretical  paradigm  which  is 
now questioned by proponents of a neurodevelopmentally 
oriented psychiatry. This atheoretical approach has influ-
enced the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) of the American 
Pychiatric Association1) as well as its updated versions. 
While  the  overall  perspective  and  preferred  strategies 
clearly influence the development of a discipline, it may 
be premature to claim a negative balance in pros and cons 
of the atheoretical understanding of diagnosis and classi-
fication in psychiatry. For example, the contemporary pe-
riod is seeing a revival of interest in psychotraumatology 
and  dissociative  disorders  which  remained  suppressed 
from scientific consciousness throughout the earlier part 
of the 20th century.

While European psychiatry has an impressive history 
of  psychotraumatology  in  the  19th  century,  North 
America has been the origin of both this revival and the 
painful backlash movement of the 1990s which resisted

this growing scientific and social awareness.2) The latter is 
now counterbalanced by growing international research 
on epidemiological, descriptive and clinical aspects of the 
subject .3) While this revival of interest has led to firm es-
tablishment of a new science of psychotraumatology and 
dissociative  disorders,  studies  in  this  field  still  remain 
marginal  in  number  despite  their  highly  creative  and 
promising nature.4)

Trauma and dissociation are phenomena at the cross-
roads of neurobiology and psychology; individual and so-
ciety; psycho-pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. The 
neurobiology of trauma and dissociative disorders is one 
of several areas of potential research interest in psycho-
traumatology. In contrast to several other psychiatric dis-
orders,  there  is  as  yet  no  specific  drug  treatment  for 
post-traumatic and dissociative disorders. This is a unique 
spectrum of conditions which presents challenges to men-
tal health delivery systems, and to psychiatry and medi-
cine in particular. 

In addition to constituting disorders in their own right, 
dissociation  may  accompany  almost  every  psychiatric 
disorder and may influence their phenomenology as well 
as response  to treatment.5) This phenomenon leads  to a 
unique challenge as a confounding factor in psychiatric 
research. At the same time, and subject to this factor being 
taken into account, the same phenomenon may pave the 
way  for  a  new  evidence  base.  This  is  particularly  im-
portant for treatment studies based on psychotherapy or 
drug treatment. As considered with respect to post-trau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) in DSM-5, dissociative sub-
types of major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenic 
and depressive disorders would provide excellent models 
for future research.6-8)

One particular challenge for clinicians and researchers 
is the fragmentary nature of dissociation and dissociative 
disorders.9) This interferes with proper diagnosis and as-
sessment  of  them  in  general  psychiatry.  This  paper  ad-
dresses this very subject of “many faces of dissociation”. 
The  most  pervasive  dissociative  condition,  i.e.,  dis-
sociative identity disorder (DID), is taken as the pivot of 
this spectrum which covers all dissociative phenomena. 
Its  subthreshold  form  (type  I  of  other  specified  dis-
sociative disorders in DSM-5) also belongs to the spec-
trum targeted in this paper because it differs from DID in 
severity only.

WHAT  IS  DISSOCIATION?

The central feature of dissociation is disruption to one 

or more mental functions.6) Such disruption may affect not 
only  consciousness,  memory,  and/or  identity,  but  also 
thinking,  emotions,  sensorimotor  functioning,  and/or 
behavior. Five phenomena constitute the primary clinical 
components  of  dissociative  psychopathology:  amnesia, 
depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, and 
identity alteration. They are usually accompanied by sec-
ondary symptoms of dissociation which may have pos-
itive  (e.g.,  hallucinations,  Schneiderian  experiences)  or 
negative (e.g., somatosensory deficits) character.

All dissociative disorders are either complete or partial 
representations of a single dimension of dissociation. DID 
is the most pervasive form among them, covering all spec-
trum of dissociative symptoms. Partial conditions are dis-
sociative amnesia (may or may not be accompanied by fu-
gue), depersonalisation disorder, and other specified dis-
sociative disorders. The latter section covers categories 
such  as  “subthreshold”  DID,  identity  disorders  in  re-
sponse to oppressive procedures, acute dissociative dis-
orders, and dissociative trance disorder which are at least 
as prevalent as the specific dissociative disorders.10)

PSYCHOLOGICAL  AETIOLOGY

There is a close relationship between PTSD and DID, 
because identity alterations may be considered as an ela-
borated version of trauma-related mental intrusions and 
avoidance. In DID, traumatic memories are decontextual-
ized11) and processed to retain internal and external bal-
ance, which leads to formation of alter personality states 
each with a sense self and agency, personal history, and a 
mission.12)  This  elaboration  is  based  on  trauma-related 
cognitions,  compensatory  structures,  and  emotions  as-
signed  to  these  structures  or  distinct  personality  states. 
Also included is possible striving for a mental status suffi-
cient to maintain daily life in a somewhat coherent man-
ner, despite the presence of intrapsychic conflicts which 
easily lead to crisis states and temporary loss of control.
While PTSD may be related to a single traumatic expe-
rience of either childhood or adulthood, DID usually re-
lates  to  chronic  developmental  traumatization  in  child-
hood (＜10 years of age).13) Ninety percent of all patients 
with  DID  report  at  least  one  form  of  childhood  abuse 
and/or neglect (i.e., incest and other types of sexual abuse, 
physical and emotional abuse, physical and emotional ne-
glect).14) Some of the patients have amnesia for a period of 
childhood, which may lead to underreporting. There are 
also  “apparently  normal”  families  with  covert  dysfunc-
tionality  (e.g.,  pseudomutuality,  double-bind,  marital 

schism, insecure attachment, high expressed emotion and 
other  types  of  affect  dysregulation).15)  Dissociative  dis-
orders can be conceptualized as a syndrome oriented at 
self-protection in response to  threat,  in contrast to self- 
regulation which is the primary modus of functioning if 
living in a safe environment.16) Hence, dissociation is part 
of all trauma-related conditions.17)

CLINICAL  APPEARANCES  OF  DISSOCIATION

Unlike other psychiatric disorders such as depression or 
schizophrenia, dissociative disorders are not conceived as 
a unitary phenomenon in the community. Although lay-
men are familiar with various types of dissociation (e.g., 
estrangement, trance states, multiple personalities, expe-
rience of possession), it is almost impossible for the suf-
fering individual to recognize all these phenomena as hav-
ing a common ground. Hence, most patients with a dis-
sociative disorder claim only a subgroup of their symp-
toms which predominate their current status. Somewhat 
surprisingly, many clinicians are also unable to diagnose 
dissociative disorders, due to omission of this knowledge 
in general psychiatric training. Dissociation may manifest 
in both chronic and acute conditions. It is necessary to be 
aware; however, that any seemingly acute condition may 
be superimposed on a chronic one. In fact, chronic dis-
sociative conditions may have a fluctuating course over 
years.

Dissociative depression: Most patients suffering from 
chronic dissociation report chronic depression leading to 
double depression; i.e., disthymic disorder with repetitive 
major depressive episodes. The latter usually marks peri-
ods  of  crisis  triggered  by  internal  or  external  stressors 
throughout the life course of the dissociative patient. In 
contrast to a primary depressive disorder, this condition is 
usually “treatment resistant” (i.e., it does not respond to 
antidepressant  pharmacotherapy  while  the  depressive 
symptoms disappear instantly upon integration in psycho-
therapy). Sar8) has proposed the term “dissociative depres-
sion” to describe this different pathogenesis, course, and 
treatment response than that for the primary depressive 
disorder.

Trauma-related  dissociative  depression  tends  to  have 
earlier age of onset than primary depression.18,19) Many 
dissociative patients report onset of their depressive mood 
and even suicidal tendencies early in childhood. Women 
with dissociative depression report cognitive symptoms 
(such as thoughts of worthlessness and guilt and dimin-
ished  concentration  and  indecisiveness),  suicidal  ideas

and attempts, experiences of possession, and appetite and 
weight changes more frequently than do those with a pri-
mary depression.18) In a study on a group of women with 
fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis, there was a relation-
ship between dissociative depression and post-traumatic 
anger.20)  In  an  epidemiological  study  on  a  female  pop-
ulation, those with dissociative depression reported child-
hood sexual abuse and neglect more frequently than the 
remaining participants.18)

Affect dysregulation: Trauma-related affect dysregula-
tion and/or switching between alter personalities with dis-
tinct  mood  states  may  resemble  cyclothymia  or  bipolar 
(II) mood disorder.21,22) This can be differentiated from bi-
polar  mood  disorder  by  the  abrupt  nature  of  mood 
changes, which can happen several times in a day and may 
last very briefly (even minutes). Unlike those with a bipo-
lar  mood  disorder,  these  patients  perceive  their  distinct 
mood states as estranged; i.e., their sense of self and agen-
cy  is  affected  by  the  changes  into  distinct  personality 
states. Many patients with dissociative disorders are erro-
neously diagnosed as having bipolar mood disorder or cy-
clothymic disorder due to the mood fluctuations related to 
post-traumatic  affect  dysregulation.  In  fact,  these  alter-
ations do not respond to mood stabilizers but may recover 
in integrative psychotherapy.

“Borderline personality” features: Many patients with a 
chronic dissociative disorder resemble borderline person-
ality disorder (BPD) at the surface. Among subjects who 
fit the DSM-IV BPD criteria, 64.0-72.5% have a DSM-IV 
dissociative disorder in a descriptive evaluation.23,24) This 
observation says little about the true nature of this phe-
nomenological overlap (i.e., whether these subjects have 
BPD or dissociative disorder or both). In fact, DSM-IV 
BPD  criteria  describe  interpersonal  aspects  of  dis-
sociation, and successfully catch many subjects who have 
dissociative disorder.25) Hence, the DSM-IV criteria are 
insufficient to  make  a personality  disorder diagnosis as 
they do not exclude a chronic dissociative disorder. In fact, 
making any diagnosis of personality disorder in a patient 
with  a  chronic  dissociative  disorder  such  as  DID  is 
contentious. 

Experiences of possession: Being under the control or 
influence of an external entity is the core feature of an ex-
perience of possession. Unlike a distinct personality state, 
such an entity is perceived to have an origin in the external 
world and can also possess other individuals. There is a 
significant  relationship  between  possession,  childhood 
psychological trauma, dissociation, and paranormal expe-
riences in the community.26,27) Although certain types pos-

174 V. Şar

session  phenomena  may  be  normative  in  a  community, 
they are not limited to “exotic” cultures.28) As stated in the 
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, the distinct personality states 
in DID may be perceived as an experience of possession in 
certain cultures.6) As possession phenomena are also asso-
ciated with traumatic experiences in adulthood, they may 
be part of the dissociative subtype of PTSD27) which is de-
scribed in DSM-5 as characterized by depersonalization 
and derealization in addition to the symptoms of PTSD.6)
Functional neurological (conversion) symptoms: In the 
general community, 26.5% of women who report having 
experienced at least one conversion symptom in their life 
have a dissociative disorder as well.29) This figure is be-
tween 30.1-50.0% among psychiatric inpatients of both 
genders.30,31)  When  accompanied  by  a  dissociative  dis-
order, patients with a conversion symptom have more psy-
chiatric comorbidity, childhood trauma history, suicide at-
tempts, and non-suicidal self-injury.30) Functional somatic 
symptoms  distinguish  dissociative  disorders  from  other 
psychiatric disorders.32) With their acute and seemingly 
life-threatening  nature,  conversion  symptoms  mark  an 
acute crisis period superimposed on the chronic course of 
dissociative disorder in these patients. The predominance 
of somatic symptoms such as non-epileptic seizure con-
stitutes a medical emergency. This necessarily leads to ad-
mission in neurological or emergency departments (rather 
than in psychiatric units) which may contribute to delayed 
awareness of the broader spectrum of dissociative symp-
tomatology unless a consultation and follow-up is consid-
ered in this direction.

Acute dissociative disorders (with ot without psychotic 
features):  Dissociative  conditions  may  constitute  acute 
and transient response to stressful life events as well as in-
terpersonal problems. Such reactions may be as mild as a 
transient state of stupor; however, they may reach the se-
verity of an acute psychosis. In Latin culture, such a mild 
and  acute  dissociative  disorder  is  known  as  “ataque  de 
nervios”.33,34)  Palpitations,  fainting,  shaking,  and  de-
personalization are common during these episodes which 
may also be associated with a conversion symptom such 
as non-epileptic seizure. On the other hand, an acute dis-
sociative disorder with psychotic features resembles a de-
lirium,  mania  or  schizophrenic  disorder.35,36)  Both  mild 
and severe types of acute dissociative disorders may rep-
resent a crisis condition superimposed on an underlying 
chronic dissociative disorder such as DID. Dissociative 
crises of patients with DID consist of trauma-related flash-
back  experiences,  non-suicidal  self-injury,  “revolving 
door crisis” of the alter personalities competing for con-

trol, and/or amnesia.35-37) Hence, emergency psychiatric 
wards are one of the settings with high prevalence of dis-
sociative disorders.10,38) A similarly high prevalence has 
been recorded among adolescent psychiatric outpatients 
who constitute the age group most prone to dissociation 
and  identity  fragmentation.39)  These  acute  crises  may 
serve as a “diagnostic window” for patients who have DID 
who may have only subtle symptoms between these acute 
decompensation periods.

Repetitive suicide attempts and/or non-suicidal self- 
injury: Several studies have shown a relationship between 
childhood  trauma,  suicidality,  and  non-suicidal  self 
injury.40,41) The majority of patients with DID has suicidal 
ideas;  suicide  attempts  are  not  rare.  The  prevalence  of 
completed suicide is around 1-2%.42) Some patients call 
for help just before or after an attempt, because some of 
the alter personality states (e.g., child personality) may re-
sist  such  an  action.  Alternatively,  one  alter  personality 
may insist on an “internal homicide” which may end in a 
completed suicide occasionally. Many patients with DID 
inflict  self-injuries,  mostly  during  a  dissociative  crisis. 
The patient may suffer from depersonalization during the 
crisis episode or remain amnesic to it.

Dissociative amnesia with fugue: Most cases involving 
dissociative  fugue  have  an  underlying  chronic  dis-
sociative disorder such as DID. Thus, only a minority of 
fugue  cases  get  a  solitary  diagnosis  of  dissociative 
fugue.43) Fot others, dissociative fugue may be a “diagno-
stic window” for DID.

Schizo-dissociative  disorder:  Ross7)  proposed  a  dis-
sociative subtype of schizophrenia which has been dem-
onstrated by subsequent studies as well.44) These patients 
have symptoms of DID and schizophrenia concurrently.44) 
They also report childhood traumas, BPD criteria and gen-
eral psychiatric comorbidity more frequently than patients 
with  non-dissociative  schizophrenia.  Interestingly,  two 
types  of  dissociative  schizophrenia  may  be  identified 
which differ in their childhood trauma histories. The two 
subgroups  did  not  differ  in  emotional  neglect  reports. 
However,  while  those  who  predominantly  had  a  child-
hood emotional abuse history tended to have more symp-
toms  of  DID  and  more  positive  symptoms  of  schizo-
phrenia  than  the  remaining  patients,  the  subgroup  with 
highest childhood sexual and physical abuse and physical 
neglect scores tended to have more general psychiatric co-
morbidity, BPD criteria,and somatic complaints.44) First 
of all, the overlap between schizophrenia and DID is im-
portant  for  differential  diagnosis.  It  also  inspires  future 
studies on schizophrenia in the context of neurobiology, 

drug treatment, and psychotherapy. Although not yet con-
firmed  by  any  empirical  research  study,  these  patients 
seem to respond to anti-psychotic drug treatment and psy-
chotherapeutic  interventions  less  positively  than  ex-
pected.  As  such,  they  constitute  a  challenge  to  general 
psychiatry as well as an important research target.

Substance abuse: Dissociatiative disorders were seen 
in 17.2 % of a large inpatient group seeking treatment for 
substance abuse.45) Patients with a dissociative disorder 
utilize  more  substances  in  a  number  of  types,  drop  out 
from treatment more frequently, have shorter remission 
duration, and tend to be younger. Dissociative symptoms 
started  before  substance  use  in  the  majority  of  cases 
(64.9%)  and  usually  in  adolescence.  Suicide  attempts, 
childhood  emotional  abuse,  and  female  gender  predict 
dissociative disorder among substance users. The preva-
lence of dissociative disorders increased to 26.0% when 
probands with only alcohol dependency were excluded.46) 
These  findings  are  alarming,  because  they  demonstrate 
the importance of recognition of dissociative disorders for 
prevention and succesful treatment of substance depend-
ency among adolescents and young adults.

Other:  In  addition  to  non-specific  forms  of  headache 
usually  triggered  by  personality  switchings,  many  pa-
tients  with  dissociative  disorder  suffer  from  genuine 
migrain. Both child and adult forms of the attention deficit 
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  may  resemble  a  dis-
sociative disorder and comorbidity is possible.39) Among 
adolescents in particular, motor uneasiness and affect dys-
regulation  due  to  dissociative  disorder  may  resemble 
ADHD.  Some  dissociative  patients  have  comorbid  ob-
sessive  compulsive  disorder.  According  to  one  study, 
15.8%  of  patients  with  obsessive  compulsive  disorder 
(OCD) had DES scores of 30.0 or above.47) Significant 
positive correlations were found between DES scores and 
emotional,  sexual,  physical  abuse  and  physical  neglect 
scores. Among children, instructions of a persecutory al-
ter personality may resemble an OCD at the surface unless 
the patient is able to report the connection to dissociative 
symptoms. Among patients with DID, personality switch-
ing  (e.g.,  to  child  or  opposite-gender  personalities)  or 
flashback experiences may occur during a sexual relation-
ship, e.g., such a condition may mimic vaginismus.48)

NEUROBIOLOGICAL  AETIOLOGY

Imaging  and  neurophysiological  studies  have  shown 
discrete  areas  of  interest  in  understanding  DID.49) 
However, the changes in these areas may occur in con-

The Many Faces of Dissociation 175

nection to each other. For example, bilaterally increased 
perfusion in medial and superior frontal regions and occi-
pital areas were accompanied by orbito-(inferior) frontal 
hypoperfusion  in  one  such  study.50)  Studies  using  other 
modalities  of  neurobiological  assessment  are  rather 
scarce.51) Those combining diverse types of assessment 
including  cognitive  variables  remain  an  important  task 
and opportunity for the future.49) Overall, trait measures of 
dissociation  (patterns  enduring  throughout  “switching” 
between personality states) should be handled separately 
from  state  measures  (those  representing  the  switching 
process itself as well as the differences between person-
ality states).

However, trait findings cannot be considered as specif-
ic to dissociation unless comparison groups composed not 
only of healthy individuals and simulators but also those 
with other psychiatric disorders are utilized because dis-
sociative patients usually suffer from diverse syndromes 
such  as  anxiety,  depression,  obsessive-compulsive  phe-
nomena, and PTSD concurrently.52) Such findings may be 
helpful in differentiation of genuine cases from simulation 
(which is also important in forensic evaluations). On the 
other  hand,  a  follow-up  study  using  the  same  method-
ology on patients before and after psychotherapeutic treat-
ment would be of great interest to demonstrate eventual 
neurobiological effects of psychotherapy.

Trait measures

One of the most specific hypotheses about the neuro-
biology of DID has been devoted to hypofunction of the 
orbitofrontal region in the brain.53) The orbitofrontal lobe 
has been proposed to be affected by developmental trauma 
in early life.54) Consistent with this hypothesis, DID pa-
tients  exhibited  bilateral  orbitofrontal  hypoperfusion  in 
comparison  with  normal  controls  in  two  single  photon 
emission  computerized  tomography  (SPECT)  studies 
conducted  when  the  patients  were  in  their  “host” 
identities.50,55) Multiple scannings in a subgroup of these 
individuals when they were controlled by an alternate per-
sonality state did not reveal any differences. Hence, orbi-
tofrontal hypofunction seems to be a trait measure.55)

Studies  using  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI), 
functional  MRI  (fMRI)  and  positron  emission  tomog-
raphy (PET) provided data about cortico-limbic region49) 
which was originally formulated in studies on PTSD.56) In 
a structural MRI study, DID patients had smaller hippo-
campi and amygdalae than normal controls.57) In accord-
ance  with  this,  another  study  on  individuals  with  DID 
found reduced volumes in the parahippocampal gyrus and 

176 V. Şar

strong  correlations  between  reduction  of  parahippo-
campal volume and severity of dissociation.58)

DID can be differentiated from temporal lobe epilepsy 
by structured psychiatric interviews.59) However, the tem-
poral region of the brain has traditionally been associated 
with experiences of depersonalization and derealization, 
as well as with fugue states and automatisms seen in psy-
cho-motor epilepsy.60) Thus, while DID cannot simply be 
considered as a type of temporal lobe epilepsy, studies of 
this region may lead to important informations about dis-
sociative  phenomena.  Nevertheless,  electroencephalo-
graphy  (EEG),  quantitative  EEG  (QEEG),  and  SPECT 
studies provide data about temporal region in DID.49) In 
one  SPECT  study  on  15  patients  with  DID,  the  “host” 
identity showed increased perfusion in the left (dominant 
hemisphere) lateral temporal region compared to healthy 
controls.55) However, this lateralisation was not replicated 
in  a  follow-up  study.50)  A  single-case  SPECT  study61) 
demonstrated  increased  activation  in  the  left  temporal 
lobe in four assessed identities of a DID patient.

“Switching” and inter-identity changes

In  a  QEEG  study,62)  there  were  differences  between 
identity states on beta activity in the frontal and temporal 
regions. In a patient with DID, increased frontal QEEG 
delta activity has been reported in a hypnotically-induced 
personality  state.63)  A  QEEG  study64)  on  a  patient  with 
DID  demonstrated  left  temporal  and  posterior-tempo-
ral-occipital changes in the theta and beta-2 frequencies in 
four of 11 personality states. One study65) demonstrated 
that the average alpha coherence on QEEG was lower for 
alter personality states than for host personality state in 
five DID patients in temporal, frontal, parietal and central 
regions.

Unlike in a preliminary study using SPECT,55) in those 
using PET and fMRI, significant differences have been 
found  between  different  personality  states  in  DID  pa-
tients66-68) and perfusion before and during switching be-
tween personality states in a patient.69) In the PET studies, 
when  compared  to  an  “apparently  normal”  personality 
state, an “emotional” personality state showed increased 
cerebral blood flow in the amygdala, insular cortex, and 
somatosensory areas in the parietal cortex and the basal 
ganglia, as well as in the occipital and frontal regions, and 
anterior cingulate.66,67) In a subsequent PET study, healthy 
controls simulating distinct personality states were unable 
to  reproduce  the  same  network  patterns  as  the  DID 
patients.70)

In a single case fMRI study69) bilateral hippocampal in-

hibition, right parahippocampal and medial temporal in-
hibition, and inhibition in small regions of the substantia 
nigra and globus pallidus were seen during the switching 
to another personality state, as well as right hippocampal 
activation when the participant was returning to the origi-
nal identity. Further fMRI studies71,72) demonstrate activa-
tion of the primary sensory and motor cortices, frontal and 
prefrontal regions, and nucleus accumbens during switch-
ing.

Electrophysiological  differences  between  personality 
states have also been found in a DID patient, who after 15 
years of diagnosed cortical blindness, gradually regained 
sight during psychotherapeutic treatment.73) Absent visual 
evoked potentials (VEP) in the blind personality state in 
contrast to the normal VEP in the seeing personality state 
were demonstrated in this study. The authors proposed a 
top-down  modulation  of  activity  in  the  primary  visual 
pathway, possibly at the level of the thalamus or the pri-
mary visual cortex.

TREATMENT

Dissociation and dissociative disorders can be treated 
succesfully  because  they  originate  from  a  mechanism 
which is not pathological per se. Hence, dissociation and 
dissociative disorders are reversible subject to appropriate 
treatment. Dissociative patients who are not treated appro-
priately become highly complicated, manifesting one of 
the most difficult-to-treat psychiatric conditions.74) Una-
ware of the true nature of their suffering, many patients try 
to  “repair”  themselves  while  struggling  with  their  dis-
sociative experiences beginning from their childhood on. 
However,  without  appropriate  intervention,  this  usually 
leads to further complexity over years. Untreated cases do 
not  integrate  spontaneously.75,76)  Dissociative  disorders 
render the subject vulnerable to abuse. It is a tragical ex-
ample  that  many  patients  abused  by  therapists  sexually 
have  a  dissociative  disorder  which  leaves  them  unpro-
tected. This situation of revictimization has been called 
“sitting duck syndrome”.77)

The classical treatment approach - phase-oriented trau-
ma therapy - is described in the most recently updated ver-
sion of the International Society for the Study of Trauma 
and Dissociation (ISSTD) Treatment Guidelines.78) Basi-
cally, this approach consists of three phases: stabilization, 
trauma-work, and integration. Unlike in PTSD (and in ad-
dition to the relatively direct trauma-resolution) psycho-
therapy for DID requires consideration of solutions for the 
complex system of alter personality states to make their 

existence  unnecessary.  This  means  addressing  intra-
psychic conflicts, defences, trauma-related cognitive dis-
tortions, compensations, scenarios, and distorted or defi-
cient memories which contribute to the persistence of alter 
personality structures. Relational aspects of treatment are 
also important. Maintenance of a therapeutic alliance is 
particularly  important,  and  is  shown  to  be  a  significant 
predictor for positive development79) among various types 
of intervention.80) This may be especially valid for cul-
tures which emphasize an interpersonal understanding of 
self, and may even influence the development of positive 
relationships and empathy between alter personality states 
which operate like an internal family system.81)

There  is  no  specific  drug  treatment  for  dissociative 
disorders. However, pharmacotherapy is often used in an 
attempt  to  alleviate  comorbidity  and  distressing  symp-
toms. This aspect of drug treatment should be explained to 
the patient early in treatment. The search for pharmaco-
logical agents with specifically “anti-dissociative” prop-
erties remains a task for the future. While this suggestion 
may  seem  implausible  for  an  environment-related  dis-
order which is sensitive to psychotherapy, future work and 
findings may also reveal it to be applicable.
