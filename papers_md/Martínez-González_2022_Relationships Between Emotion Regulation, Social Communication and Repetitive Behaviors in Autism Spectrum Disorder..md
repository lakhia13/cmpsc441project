Abstract
The relationship between emotion regulation, social interaction and different types of restricted and repetitive behaviors is 
poorly understood. In the present study, structural equation modeling based on information about 239 individuals with autism 
was used to examine whether emotion regulation and social communication were associated with self-injury and stereotyped 
behaviors. Results showed that poor emotion regulation had a unique association with self-injury while difficulties with 
social communication was uniquely associated with stereotyped behaviors. Emotion regulation and social communication 
were strongly associated and self-injury and stereotyped behaviors moderately associated. This implies that these types of 
behaviors are often expressions of broader negative emotional states in autism. Treatments that help improve coping and 
social communication strategies may benefit individuals with autism.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental 
disorder which is characterized by a persistent deficit in 
social communication and interaction skills, and repetitive 
and restricted patterns of behavior (APA, 2013). In ASD, 
restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are defined as 
a  series  of  behaviors  (e.g.,  stereotyped,  self-injurious,

compulsive,  ritualistic,  sameness,  etc.)  and  activities  or 
interests that manifest regularly and interfere with daily 
functioning (Bodfish et al., 2000).

Studies  have  shown  that  there  is  a  clear  relationship 
between RRBs and emotional states among individuals with 
ASD as RRBs have been linked to anxiety and stress (e.g., 
Glod et al., 2019; Russell et al., 2019). Further, RRBs in 
the form of self-injurious behaviors are closely associated 
with anxiety in individuals with ASD (Russell et al., 2019). 
Empirical evidence also supports a relationship between 
RRBs and emotion regulation difficulties in ASD, which 
has been considered through the lens of theory of mind 
(ToM) and executive functioning (e.g., Carter-Leno et al., 
2018; García-Villamisar & Rojahn, 2015; Iversen, & Lewis, 
2020; Jones et al., 2018). Moreover, difficulties in emotional 
self-control have been associated with self-injurious behav-
ior and externalizing behaviors in ASD (Carter-Leno et al., 
2018; Richards et al., 2017).

Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish et al., 
2000) is the most commonly used scale to assess RRBs in 
adults and children with ASD. The measure has been shown 
to adequately measure RRBs across the age span and no dif-
ferences have been found in RRBs according to age (Inada 
et al., 2015; Lam & Aman, 2007; Martínez-González & 
Piqueras, 2018, 2019a, 2019b). Further, RBS-R has been

shown to be the most accurate predictor of self-injurious 
behavior in individuals with ASD (Handen et al., 2018).

Social communication difficulties are a defining charac-
teristic of ASD (APA, 2013). Even for individuals that use 
speech and language to communicate, social communica-
tion difficulties are often present as the verbal skill does not 
meet all of their communication needs (Beukelman & Light, 
2020). Thus, as a consequence, social isolation and difficul-
ties in creating and maintaining social networks may appear 
(Carter et al., 2014; Smith, 2015). Social communication 
difficulties are a relevant variable for autism research since 
it has implications in both social and emotional spheres. One 
of the most frequently used screeners for ASD in the social 
area is the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; 
Rutter et al., 2003). The SCQ is a commonly used screener 
for ASD along with other scales (e.g., Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule (ADOS), Autism Diagnostic Inter-
view—Revised (ADI-R) and SCQ has been shown to be an 
acceptable screening instrument for autism spectrum disor-
der (area under the curve = 0.89) (Chesnut et al., 2017) in 
both children and adults (Berument et al., 1999).

The appearance of repetitive maladaptive behaviors and 
emotional instability may be factors that could interfere 
with school functioning and social relationships for indi-
viduals with ASD (Inada et al., 2015; Martínez-González 
& Piqueras, 2018; Rojahn et al., 2013) and studies have 
indicated that there is a significant relationship between 
RRBs  and  deficits  in  communication  (e.g.,  Jones  et  al., 
2018; Lampi et al., 2020; Tse et al., 2018). Furthermore, it 
seems that difficulties in social communication and RRBs 
are  closely  associated  with  adaptive  behavior  problems 
(Estabillo et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2017; Golya & McIntyre, 
2018; Inada et al., 2015; Kojovic et al., 2019; Troyb et al., 
2016; Williams et al., 2018). It has also been suggested that 
poor emotion regulation can be a mode of communication 
in autism (Nuske et al., 2017; Welsh et al., 2019). However, 
although there are some studies on the relationship between 
RRBs and social interaction in ASD, this association is over-
all poorly understood (Bahrami et al., 2012; Enloe & Rapp, 
2014; Joosten et al., 2012; Tse et al., 2018). In fact, there are 
a limited number of studies that have examined self-injury, 
stereotyped behaviors, social communication and emotional 
stability in ASD in tandem (Jones et al., 2018). Such work 
could help identify individuals who are at the greatest risk 
for developing self-injurious behavior by identifying strong 
risk factors (Handen et al., 2018).

One of the concerns of school and mental health profes-
sionals is to know the origin and functionality of RRBs. 
Studies have been carried out from the field of education to 
biology to study the factors that could be determining factors 
(e.g., Andreo-Martínez et al., 2018, 2020, 2021; Martínez-
González & Piqueras, 2019a; Martínez-González & Andreo-
Martínez, 2019). In addition, self-injurious behaviors in 

ASD pose a risk to physical health and can lead to sub-
stantial healthcare costs (Shields et al., 2019). Therefore, it 
is necessary to analyze the relationships between emotion 
regulation, social communication, and different types of 
repetitive behaviors (primarily stereotyped and self-injurious 
behaviors) among individuals with ASD in order to identify 
key areas to address in treatment and care (Frost et al., 2017; 
Fulceri et al., 2016; Inada et al., 2015; Troyb et al., 2016).

The  aim  of  the  present  study  is  to  examine  whether 
social communication and emotion regulation is associated 
with stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors in ASD, and 
whether there is an association between social communica-
tion and emotion regulation and stereotyped and self-inju-
rious behaviors, respectively. Importantly, all associations 
will be estimated within a single model where associations 
between these factors are analyzed in tandem, which pro-
vides an opportunity to outline unique associations.

Methods

Participants

An  incidental  sample  of  239  participants  was  recruited 
from 18 educational facilities in Spain: 4 special education 
schools in the Region of Murcia, 2 residential facilities for 
individuals with ID in the Region of Murcia and Province 
of Alicante, 7 daycare centers (5 belonged to the Region 
of Murcia and 2 belonged to the Province of Alicante), 3 
early childcare centers (1 belonged to the Region of Murcia 
and 2 belonged to the Province of Alicante), and 2 regular 
schools with open classrooms in the Region of Murcia. The 
participants belonged to differently sized urban areas, and 
they represented both rural and urban areas. All educational 
centers had coeducational autism support classrooms except 
for one private center, which was open only to boys. Pub-
lic and semiprivate institutions were equally represented in 
the sample of participating special education centers. All 
the residential and daycare centers were managed by the 
associations of individuals with disabilities, which had an 
agreement with the public administration.

The sample inclusion criteria were delineated based on 
the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ASD (APA, 2013). The 
subjects had previously been diagnosed by the mental health 
services and institutions in Spain that are responsible for 
ascertaining the degree of disability and dependency. We 
excluded individuals who presented with other diagnoses 
such as motor disability, multiple disabilities, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive–compulsive disor-
der, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental illnesses. We 
included participants with ASD and ID when ASD was the 
primary diagnosis. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and 
diagnostic characteristics of the sample.

Measures

Sociodemographic Questionnaire

Lam and Aman’s (2007) sociodemographic questionnaire 
was adapted for use in the present study. It consists of a 
series  of  questions  about  (a)  sociodemographic  charac-
teristics (e.g., age, sex, country of birth), (b) the primary 
diagnosis within the autism spectrum as per DSM criteria 
(e.g., Asperger’s syndrome, autism, pervasive developmen-
tal disorder-not otherwise specified), and (c) comorbidities 
(e.g., depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, obsessive–com-
pulsive disorder, ID, schizophrenia; these questions entailed 
dichotomous response options).

Repetitive Behavior Scale‑Revised (RBS‑R)

The RBS-R is a 43-item scale that measures six different 
dimensions of repetitive behaviors in individuals with ASD 
and ID: (a) stereotypic, (b) self-injurious, (c) compulsive, 
(d) ritualistic, and (e) sameness behaviors (Bodfish et al., 
2000). Responses are recorded on a 4-point rating scale 
that ranges from 0 (repetitive behavior does not occur) to 3 
(very severe repetitive behaviors). The assessment of repeti-
tive behavior is based on observations of and interactions 
with the respondent during the past month. The RBS-R 
has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties for use 
with individuals with ASD who belong to different countries 
(e.g., Fulceri et al., 2016; Georgiades et al., 2010; He et al., 
2019; Inada et al., 2015; Martínez-González & Piqueras, 
2018, 2019b; Mirenda et al., 2010; Rojahn et al., 2013). 
The internal consistency of the RBS-R (α = 0.93) is high for 
most of the subscales: stereotypic (α = 0.86), self-injurious 
(α = 0.83), compulsive (α = 0.70), ritualistic (α = 0.80), and 
sameness behaviors (α = 0.88). In this study, we used the two 
subscales assessing stereotypic (items 1 to 6 of the RBS-R), 
and self-injurious (items 7 to 14 of the RBS-R) RRBs.

Social Communication Questionnaire, SCQ Form B (SCQ‑B)

The SCQ-Form B (Rutter et al., 2003; Spanish adaptation 
by Pereña & Santamaria, 2005) is a scale orientated towards 
parents or caregivers, with a total of 40 items that determine 

the possible presence of ASD. It provides an overall total 
score and three possible additional scores (Social Interac-
tion Problems, Communication Difficulties and restricted, 
Repetitive and Stereotyped Behaviors). The duration of its 
administration was 10 min. In the present study, the Form B 
of the scale was used, which assessed behaviors during the 
past three months. Scores above 15, the cut-off, suggest that 
the individual is likely to have ASD and a more extended 
evaluation should be undertaken. The scale has shown ade-
quate psychometric properties (Pereña & Santamaria, 2005). 
For this sample, the internal consistency values were: 0.87 
for social interaction problems; 0.64 for communication 
difficulties; 0.78 for restricted, repetitive and stereotyped 
behavior and 0.90 for the total overall score, but only the 
social communication difficulties scale was used.

Social‑Emotional Rating Scale: Leiter‑R‑Questionnaire

The Social-Emotional Rating Scale-Teacher is included in 
the Leiter’s International Performance Scale-R (Roid & 
Miller, 2011). The Social-Emotional Rating Scale evaluates 
the emotional and regulatory dimension (including Regula-
tory, Temperament, Reactivity and Adaptation subscales) 
and the social-cognitive dimension (including Attention, 
Impulse Control, Activity Level and Social Abilities) in 
children within an educational context. The test provides 
scalar scores of each of the sub-scales according to three age 
groups: from 2 to 4 years, from 4 to 6 years and over 7 years, 
being  used  in  adolescents  and  adults  (Cederlund  et  al., 
2010). All of them indicate positive aspects of a person’s 
performance. The psychometric properties of the instrument 
were also appropriate. The Cronbach’s alphas for this sample 
were: Attention (0.90); Impulsivity (0.86); Activity Level 
(0.92); Social Skills (0.90); Regulation (0.79); Temperament 
(0.79); Reactivity (0.66) and Adaptation (0.84). In this study 
only the emotional and regulatory dimension was included.
In the analysis we exclusively used the two subscales 
assessing stereotypic RRBs (items 1 to 6 of the RBS-R), and 
self-injurious RRBs (items 7 to 14 of the RBS- R); the social 
communication difficulties subscale from SCQ-B; and sub-
scales for emotional and regulatory dimensions (including 
Regulatory, Temperament, Reactivity and Adaptation sub-
scales) from the Social-Emotional Rating Scale. The reasons 
for selecting these scales were the following: (1) the stereo-
typic RRBs (items 1 to 6 of the RBS-R), and self-injurious 
RRBs (items 7 to 14 of the RBS-R) are variables related to 
externalizing symptoms or indicators of emotional distress 
(e.g., Carter-Leno et al., 2018; Richards et al., 2017); (2); 
the Social communication difficulties subscale is a scale that 
focuses on social communication and not so much on prob-
lems that exist in social interaction compared to the Social 
Interaction Problems subscale; furthermore, it is a determin-
ing variable in adaptation difficulties and repetitive behavior

in ASD (e.g., Estabillo et al., 2018; Kojovic et al., 2019); 
and, finally, (3) the Social-Emotional Rating Scale—Leiter-
R-Questionnaire is a questionnaire that includes a version 
for teachers and was considered an ideal instrument to ana-
lyze the emotional and regulatory dimension described in 
the instructions of the same questionnaire (Roid & Miller, 
2011).

Procedures

the measured scales/factors. This was analyzed by including 
covariance parameters between age and each factor in the 
final measurement model. We also analyzed whether there 
were any gender differences using the same approach. After 
establishing a sound measurement model, we tested a struc-
tural model in which we regressed the stereotypic and self-
injurious factors on the social communication and emotion 
regulation factors.

The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
the University of Alicante in Spain (reference: UA-2019-10-
04). We obtained written informed consent from the parents 
and caregivers of the participants who were recruited from 
schools, daycare centers, childcare centers, and residential 
facilities.

The tests were administered in the educational centers by 
educational and behavioral science professionals who were 
knowledgeable about the behaviors of individuals with ASD 
(e.g., psychopedagogues/educational psychologists, special 
education teachers, and general psychologists). The first sec-
tion of the sociodemographic questionnaire, which was an 
adaptation of the original instrument (Lam & Aman, 2007), 
was completed by expert psychologists who had relevant 
information about the diagnoses of the participants who 
were previously diagnosed by the health center as per the 
DSM criteria for ASD (APA, 2013). The rest of the research 
protocol was completed by the professional who had the 
highest amount of daily contact with the respective partici-
pant at the center. All the participating centers underwent a 
training session that was organized by the researchers who 
described the purpose of the research study, the tests that 
were used, and instructions for test administration.

Data Analyses

Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 1.3.959 
using the R library lavaan. First, we examined the psycho-
metric properties of each scale separately using confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA). This was done to investigate whether 
we had adequate measurement of the constructs we wanted 
to examine. We used the following fit indices to evaluate 
model/data fit: χ2, Confirmatory Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standard-
ized Mean Square Residual (SRMR). RMSEA below 0.06, 
SRMR below 0.08 and CFI and TLI estimates greater than 
0.90 are indicative of acceptable model-data fit; CFI and 
TLI estimates above 0.95 are indicative of good model-data 
fit (Hox et al, 2017). A combination of the full set of indi-
ces was used to evaluate model fit. We also calculated the 
internal consistency (alpha) for all factors using the CFA 
models. Because of the large variation in age, we examined 
whether there was an association between age and each of 

Results

Measurement Model

For RBS-R we first tested the stereotypic and self-injurious 
factors separately. Each factor showed good CFI/TLI values 
(> 0.95), but the RMSEA index indicated some problems 
with fit (values above 0.10). We added correlated residuals 
for two items for the self-injurious factor and three items 
for the stereotypic factor. This provided good fit for both 
scales. When we evaluated fit for both scales in the same 
model (including the correlated residuals) fit was also good 
(X2 [73] = 108.2, p for X2 = 0.005, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.98, 
RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.08). The internal consistency of 
both scales was excellent (as > 0.90).

For SCQ-B, CFI and TLI indicated adequate fit for the 
social  communication  difficulties  scale  but  SRMR  and 
RMSEA  were  above  0.10.  Again,  correlated  residuals 
between two items were added and after that addition the 
model/data fit was excellent (X2 [8] = 4.4, p for X2 = 0.823, 
CFI = 1.00, TLI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00, SRMR = 0.03) and 
the scale had adequate internal consistency (a = 0.88).

For Leiter-R, a model that included the four emotional 
and regulation scales had questionable fit. With the addition 
of correlated residuals between two items, the fit was good 
(X2 [163] = 353.9, p for X2 < 0.001, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, 
RMSEA = 0.07, SRMR = 0.07) and all of the scales had ade-
quate internal consistency (as: 0.85, 0.86, 0.76, and 0.90).

Finally, we tested a full measurement model that included 
all of the above-described scales/factors. This model showed 
good model/data fit (X2 [714] = 1053.8,  p for X2 < 0.001, 
CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.09). We 
also fitted a model where we added a higher-order emo-
tion regulation factor with the Leiter-R scales as indica-
tors. This model showed similar fit (X2 [725] = 1103.7,  p 
for  X2 < 0.001,  CFI = 0.96,  TLI = 0.96,  RMSEA = 0.05, 
SRMR = 0.10)  and  we  proceeded  with  the  latter  model 
because of the principle of parsimony. No statistically sig-
nificant associations between included scales/factors and age 
emerged (all ps > 0.09). Females trended to have statistically 
significantly higher scores on the self-injurious factor than 
males (standardized covariance coefficient = 0.21, p = 0.05). 
No other gender differences emerged (all ps > 0.69).

Structural Model

Discussion

Item-level means and standard deviations for the scales 
that were included in the final measurement model is pre-
sented in Table 2. Zero-order Pearson correlations between 
the scales are presented in Table 3. The top part of Fig. 1 
shows the structural model that was fitted. The bottom 
part of Fig. 1 presents the estimated parameters. In sum, 
emotion regulation and social communication was mark-
edly associated, and self-injurious and stereotypic behav-
iors moderately associated. Emotion regulation showed 
a strong negative association with self-injurious behav-
iors (i.e., better emotion regulation, less self-injurious 
behaviors) and social communication a strong negative 
association with stereotypic behaviors (i.e., better social 
communication, less stereotypic behaviors). No significant 
association emerged between emotion regulation and ste-
reotypic behaviors or between social communication and 
self-injurious behaviors.

The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  analyze  the  relationship 
between RRBs (stereotypic and self-injurious behaviors), 
emotion regulation, and social communication in individuals 
with ASD. The results indicate that difficulties with emotion 
regulation have a unique association with self-injury RRBs 
in individuals with ASD. Thus, when people with ASD have 
a better capacity to regulate emotion, they tend to engage 
less in self-injurious behaviors. These results are similar to 
previous findings showing a correlation between self-injury 
and externalizing symptoms such as aggressiveness and 
irritability among individuals with ASD (Carter-Leno et al., 
2018; Richards et al., 2017). One possible explanation for 
this association is the mediating role that executive dysfunc-
tion may play in repetitive behavior (García-Villamisar & 
Rojahn, 2015; Iversen, & Lewis, 2020; Jones et al., 2018).

On  the  other  hand,  social  communication  showed  a 
unique association with stereotypic RRBs. Thus, individu-
als with ASD with more social communication skills tend 
to engage less in stereotypic behaviors. These results are in 
line with previous studies showing a significant association 
between RRBs and deficits in communication in ASD (e.g., 
Jones et al., 2018; Lampi et al., 2020; Tse et al., 2018) and 
point toward a specific link between stereotypic behavior and 
social communication in ASD. Of note, stereotypic behavior 
may be more adaptive than self-injury for communicating 
with the environment. In addition, stereotypic behavior can 
be a manifestation of anxiety in unpleasant situations (Gabri-
els et al., 2013).

A strong association was also identified between emo-
tion regulation and social communication. Thus, individuals 
with ASD with more social communication skills show more 
emotional stability. These results highlight the importance 
of emotional self-regulation in order to perform adaptive 
behaviors (Estabillo et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2017; Golya 
& McIntyre, 2018; Inada et al., 2015; Kojovic et al., 2019; 
Troyb et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018).

Last, a moderate association was found between self-
injury and stereotypic behaviors. This indicates that differ-
ent forms of RRBs are related in ASD and that individuals 
that engage in one form of RRBs can be expected to also 
have other forms of RRBs. Previous research has shown 
that individuals with ASD with more emotional problems 
and non-adaptive behaviors have more self-injury behaviors 
and higher levels of anxiety (Russell et al., 2019; Shields 
et al., 2019). We add to this literature by showing that emo-
tion regulation is uniquely related to self-injury while social 
communication is uniquely related to stereotypic behavior. 
However, it is important to note that stereotypic behaviors 
can  be  functional  and  adaptive  when  they  alleviate  dis-
comfort (Gabriels et al., 2013). All these results lead us 
to the “Continuous emotional state-repetitive behavior in 
ASD” theoretical hypothesis which suggests that repetitive 
behaviors of similarity and stereotypes are associated with 
lower anxiety levels and increasing adaptation to environ-
ment. However, repetitive self-injury behaviors are more 
associated with higher levels of anxiety and non-adaptive 
behavior (Martínez-González & Andreo-Martínez, 2020). 
That is, repetitive behaviors can be conceptualized as a 
continuum that ranges from mild and functional (e.g., ste-
reotypic behaviors) to severe and dysfunctional level which 
lie at the extreme end of the continuum (e.g., self-injurious 

behaviors). Thus, self-injury is the behavioral manifestation 
of a negative emotional state. This behavior would act as an 
important signal for the detection of emotional distress or 
even a maladaptive mode of communication. Therefore, this 
fact has important repercussions for designing treatments 
that can mitigate self-injury behavior and channel anxiety 
levels with other types of behaviors, such as stereotypes 
(Martínez-González & López Gil, 2018).

The present study has several limitations. The cross-
sectional data precludes causal claims and even though it is 
reasonable to assume that communication skills and emo-
tion regulation are factors that cause difficulties with RRBs 
rather than the other way around, longitudinal designs are 
needed to better understand causality. Second, it was pro-
fessionals that worked with and knew the individuals in the 
study who completed the measures and it is unclear to what 
extent these professionals report valid observations. Future 
studies should compare the information from families and 
professionals. Third, it has been shown that there are dif-
ferences in the severity of repetitive behavior depending on 
the comorbidity with ID (Martínez-González & Piqueras, 
2019b). In the present study, the ASD groups with and with-
out ID were pooled to be able to conduct the analysis. Future 
studies should analyze the relationship in the variables stud-
ied according to the type of ASD.

The  scientific  literature  has  related  the  severity  of 
RRBs in ASD to factors such as the educational context 
(e.g., Martínez-González & Piqueras, 2019a; Welsh et al., 
2019) and biological bases (Andreo-Martínez et al., 2020). 
For example, individuals with ASD and gastrointestinal 
symptoms are at risk for problem behaviors and self-injury 
(Buie et al., 2010). Thus, the approach to assessment of 
emotional states should consider gastro-intestinal symp-
toms  (Martínez-González  &  Andreo-Martínez,  2019, 
2020). Different approaches have carried out interven-
tions to improve the emotional state of individuals with 
ASD. Intervention with probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal 
microbiota transplantation provides promising results for 
autism, emotional, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Mar-
tínez-González & Andreo-Martinez, 2020). Another tra-
ditional intervention such as cognitive‐behavioral therapy 
(CBT) has reduced negative emotional states in children 
with high functioning ASD (Perihan et al., 2020; Wang 
et al., 2021) and in individuals with ASD and intellectual 
disability (Blakeley‐Smith et al., 2021). The CBT can help 
improve coping and social communication strategies in 
individuals with ASD. Further, this type of intervention 
is necessary during and after the COVID-19 confinement 
because a high level of repetitive behaviors was found in 
individuals with ASD (Martínez-González et al., 2021). 
Nevertheless, it is necessary to have a multidisciplinary 
perspective in order to understand and influence emotional 
states in individuals with ASD (Andreo-Martínez et al., 
2020;  Martínez-González  &  Andreo-Martínez, 2019). 
Future studies should consider the sensitivity of measures 
and heterogeneity of samples. They should also identify 
RRBs that act as specific predictors of adaptive difficulties. 
Further, by including biological and neurophysiological 
variables (e.g., gut microbiota, hormones, short chain fatty 
acids, gastro-intestinal symptoms, etc.) when studying 
RRBs in ASD, a further understanding of this phenomena 
can be achieved.
