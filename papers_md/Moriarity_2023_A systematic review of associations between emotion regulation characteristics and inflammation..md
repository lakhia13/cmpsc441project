Abstract

Elevated inflammation is a risk factor for many psychiatric (e.g., depression) and somatic 
conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). Inflammation is influenced by psychosocial processes 
such as emotion regulation. Characterization of which emotion regulation characteristics impact 
inflammation could help refine psychosocial interventions aimed at normalizing health-harming 
inflammatory activity for individuals with psychiatric and somatic illnesses. To investigate this 
issue, we systematically reviewed the literature on associations between a variety of emotion 
regulation traits and inflammation. Out of 2816 articles identified, 38 were included in the final 
review. 28 (74%) found that (a) poor emotion regulation is associated with higher inflammation 
and/or (b) strong emotion regulation skills are associated with lower inflammation. Consistency of 
results differed as a function of the emotion regulation construct investigated and methodological 
characteristics. Results were most consistent for studies testing positive coping/social support 
seeking or broadly defined emotion regulation/dysregulation. Methodologically, studies testing 
reactivity to a stressor, adopting a vulnerability-stress framework, or using longitudinal data were 
most consistent. Implications for integrated, transdiagnostic psychoimmunological theories are 
discussed, as well as recommendations for clinical research.

Introduction

Inflammation is a transdiagnostic correlate of many medical and psychiatric conditions 
(Dantzer et al., 2008; Michopoulos et al., 2016; Pearson et al., 2003; Saccaro et al., 
2021; Sattar et al., 2003). Further, evidence suggests that inflammation has a causal

effect on some of these health outcomes including depression (Capuron and Miller, 2004; 
Knight et al., 2022; Kuhlman et al., 2018; Moriarity, Kautz et al., 2020), ulcerative colitis 
(Ek et al., 2021), and osteoarthritis (Ek et al., 2021), positioning it to be a potentially 
important treatment target for a variety of disorders. Although inflammation-modulating 
biological treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, interferon-α therapy, 
and minocycline generally are considered primary interventions for inflammation-mediated 
conditions, psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and 
mindfulness meditation also have been shown to influence inflammatory biology (Black 
and Slavich, 2016; Shields et al., 2020). Inflammatory malleability to these biological 
and psychological interventions affords patients who suffer from inflammation-mediated 
disorders flexibility in treatment options. For example, biological interventions might be 
a useful adjunctive when individuals with both depression and elevated inflammation are 
struggling with the cognitive demands required to engage in evidence-based psychotherapy. 
Conversely, individuals for whom anti-inflammatory medications are contraindicated—or 
who refuse medication for other reasons—may benefit from psychosocial interventions 
(Shields et al., 2020).

Yet, the mere understanding that psychosocial interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral 
therapies) influence inflammation is insufficient to maximize therapeutic impact. It is 
necessary to explore which treatment targets of extant psychosocial interventions actually 
affect inflammatory biology. A nuanced understanding of which specific characteristics of 
psychosocial treatments reduce inflammation would have direct implications for treating 
inflammation-mediated mental and physical health problems and could help advance 
precision medicine approaches aimed at reducing risk for these conditions. Further, this 
work would integrate inflammatory mechanisms into existing, psychosocially oriented 
theories of psychiatric risk and resilience, which would guide theory development 
(Moriarity, 2021) and advance understanding of many complex, multifactorial health 
conditions.

Increasing the quantity and quality of emotion regulation skills, and decreasing emotional 
reactivity, is a shared goal of many psychotherapies (e.g., CBT, dialectical behavioral 
therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy), as strengthening emotion regulation aptitude 
can reduce distress in various areas of psychosocial functioning (Beatty et al., 2016; Ma and 
Fang, 2019). Indeed, skillful emotion regulation is associated with improved communication 
and social relationship functioning overall (Vater and Schröder, Abé, 2015). Additionally, 
individuals with advanced emotion regulation also are better able to select strategies that 
best align with their goals within the situational context (English et al., 2017). Given that 
inflammatory biology is reactive to increases in negative affect such as anger or anxiety 
(Carroll et al., 2011), it is plausible that improved emotion regulation also could influence 
inflammatory biology.

In fact, there are several extant theories/models implicating emotion regulation as a 
modulator of inflammation. The perseverative cognitions hypothesis is not specific to 
inflammation, but describes how perseverative (e.g., rumination, worry) reactions to 
unpleasant situations or emotions can simultaneously amplify the magnitude and duration 
of the physiological stress response-exacerbating downstream consequences for basal stress

biology (Brosschot et al., 2006). Our team has extended this work to include cognitive 
vulnerabilities more generally in an immunocognitive model of psychopathology (Moriarity 
et al., 2018)-attempting to clarify discrepant results in stress/arousal→inflammation 
research by including emotion-modulating cognitive vulnerabilities as a moderator of 
this association. Others have described emotion regulation traits/abilities as a mediator 
of the negative emotionality→inflammation pathway (Renna, 2021) and suggested the 
possibility of bidirectional feedback loops between negative emotions, inflammation, and 
health outcomes. Although comprehensive tests of bidirectional relationships are lacking in 
this area, there is evidence from studies involving experimentally-administered endotoxin 
that inflammatory activity might increase negative reactivity (Dooley et al., 2018) and 
that certain health sequelae of inflammation (e.g., depression) are also predictive of future 
increases in inflammation (Moriarity, Kautz et al., 2020).

A few reviews have explored the association between emotion regulation and inflammation 
for specific emotion regulation constructs (e.g., see Szabo et al., 2022 for a scoping review 
on rumination and inflammation), but there have been no attempts to systematically review 
how a wide variety of emotion regulation characteristics are related to inflammatory biology. 
Given the range of both emotion regulation characteristics and inflammatory proteins, 
a systematic review of the associations between these two constructs is an important 
contribution to the field insofar as it would point to the therapeutic processes that are 
most relevant for reducing inflammation, a key health-damaging process. This is especially 
important given that the identification of cognitive targets that impact inflammatory biology 
could lead to the development of more precise psychological interventions for a variety of 
inflammation-mediated health outcomes (Moriarity, 2021).

We addressed this need by systematically reviewing for the first time all of the available 
evidence for associations between various emotion regulation characteristics and circulating 
inflammatory proteins in clinical (i.e., medical and psychiatric) and nonclinical samples. 
In addition to identifying which emotion regulation characteristics are associated with 
inflammatory biology, we assessed contextual factors that might influence the presence 
or absence of theoretically consistent associations to the extent possible (e.g., emotion 
regulation tested as a moderator of arousal-related characteristics and inflammation, emotion 
regulation as a trait vs. in the context of acute stress). Then, we used the reviewed evidence 
to formulate recommendations for clinical practice, and the integration of inflammation into 
theories of emotion regulation and psychopathology.

2.2.  Search strategy and selection criteria

Several steps were used to identify and assess relevant articles for inclusion in this 
systematic review. First, PubMed and PsycInfo were searched for articles written in English 
and published until June 16th, 2022. Specific search terms are reported in Supplemental 
Table 1 and were filtered for human samples and articles available in English. One notable 
term that we did not include was “mindfulness”, given that the goal of mindfulness 
is to notice emotional states (among other things) rather than directly regulate them. 
Relatedly, broad-based immune terminology (e.g., “immune”, “immune response”, “immune 
activation”) were not included to ensure a focused review on inflammatory biology–
streamlining attempts to connect the results of this review to specific clinical processes. 
Duplicate articles were removed. Then, abstracts and titles were screened for exclusion 
criteria. Studies passing this step had their full texts reviewed for inclusion criteria. To be 
included, studies had to be (1) empirical (i.e., no reviews), (2) based on human samples, 
(3) specifically test the association between a facet of emotion regulation and levels 
of inflammatory proteins (e.g., no gene expression or LPS-stimulated proteins), (4) not 
retracted, (5) devoid of critical analytic flaws (in the case that only some tests in a study 
were critically flawed, the appropriately conducted analyses are reported), and (6) published 
in a peer-reviewed academic journal (e.g., no pre-prints or unpublished theses/dissertations). 
If additional relevant articles were identified during the full-text review process, these steps 
were repeated to determine if the article should be included in the review.

Given the small number of studies testing the associations between identical emotion 
regulation measures + biomarkers, as well as a variety of other methodological disparities 
between studies (e.g., duration of assessment lags in longitudinal or experimental research, 
sample health characteristics, sample developmental stage, whether inflammatory proteins 
were measured in blood or saliva), it was determined that a quantitative meta-analysis would 
be inappropriate and risk contributing to growing concerns about lack of meta-analytic 
replicability (Sotola, 2022). To illustrate, the most popular protein in this review is CRP 
assayed in blood (23 studies) and the most common temporal design with CRP was cross-
sectional (13 studies). Of these 13, the most popular emotion regulation construct was 
cognitive reappraisal (4 studies). Of these 4 studies only 3 used the same measure and all 
three featured fundamentally different samples (community adult, community adolescent, 
trauma-exposed veterans). Meta-analysis is an important tool for scientific advancement 
and we would rather stick to a narrative review that provides space for a detailed look 
into potential drivers of differing results (e.g., emotion regulation construct, longitudinal vs. 
cross-sectional designs) instead of potentially collapsing studies where different effect sizes 
are plausible. Hopefully this systematic review inspires more research on this topic so that 
the literature grows to a point that a meta-analysis would be more methodologically sound.

2.3.  Data extraction

Study characteristics were independently extracted from the reviewed articles by three 
authors, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussion including all authors. 
The information extracted was sample size, sample characteristics (e.g., community, 
clinical), study design (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal, acute laboratory stressor), emotion 
regulation constructs, inflammatory proteins, inflammatory protein measurement method

available), and covariates.

3.  Results

The literature search identified 2816 articles. After exclusion of duplicates and irrelevant 
articles based on screening titles and abstracts, 67 full-text articles were screened, resulting 
in 38 studies included in the systematic review (see Fig. 1 for PRISMA flowchart outlining 
the study selection process). All included studies are systematically summarized in Table 1. 
Results are organized in the following subsections: emotion regulation (broadly defined), 
negative affectivity/emotional reactivity, emotional expression/suppression, perseverative 
cognitions and distraction/disengagement, cognitive reappraisal, and positive coping and 
support-seeking. Studies that tested several relevant emotion regulation constructs are 
described in multiple sections. For ease-of-reading, only significant associations (other than 
studies that only had null results) are highlighted below, but all relevant significant and null 
results are reported (with standardized effect sizes and metrics of significance, to the extent 
available) in Table 1.

3.1.  Study characteristics

Of the studies included in this review, 19 included cross-sectional data, 13 included 
longitudinal data, 8 included acute stressors, and 4 qualified as experimental designs. 
Twenty-six featured community samples, whereas the remaining 12 featured clinical 
samples (6 medical, 5 psychiatric, 1 combined medical and psychiatric). Regarding the 
assessment of inflammatory proteins, 34 studies used blood, 3 used saliva, and 1 used sweat. 
Only 6 studies featured nonadult samples (5 adolescent, 1 preschool-aged).

To provide structure for this review, seven emotion regulation categories were created. 
First, “Emotion Regulation/Dysregulation” describes results using measures that claimed 
to broadly capture the ability, or inability, to adaptively regulate emotions. The rest of 
the categories pertain to more specific emotion regulation skills/traits/strategies. Second, 
“Negative Affectivity/Emotional Reactivity”, includes studies evaluating (often through 
the use of mood-induction tasks) individual differences in the magnitude of emotional 
responses. Although these characteristics are theoretically different from regulation, we 
believe they are important to include in this review both because (a) they illustrate the 
inflammatory correlates of the emotional reactions that regulation traits modulate and (b) 
they are a marker of how successful an individual is at regulating their emotions. Third, 
“Expressive Suppression vs. Emotional Expression” describes studies investigating the 
tendency to keep emotions bottled up and away from others vs. openly communicating 
them. Fourth, “Cognitive Reappraisal” includes studies evaluating individuals’ ability or 
tendency to attempt to reframe stressful situations and/or negative emotions in a more 
neutral or positive light. Fifth, “Perseverance vs. Distraction/Disengagement” describes 
studies testing tendencies to ruminate or worry about stressful situations/emotions or, the 
inverse, to seek opportunities for disengagement from negative situations and emotions. 
Sixth, “Psychological Flexibility” covers research on either “psychological flexibility”—the 
ability to live in the present and change or persist behaviors aligned with values instead

of emotions)—or its subcomponents such as acceptance of positive and negative aspects of 
life. Finally, “Positive Coping/Social Support Seeking” includes several studies of emotion 
regulation strategies commonly seen as adaptive (although this is influenced by the context 
of the stressor in question, discussed in further detail in the Discussion section).

3.2.  Emotion regulation/dysregulation

Five studies investigated emotion regulation broadly. Difficulties with global emotion 
regulation were consistently associated with higher CRP in a mixed sample of adults with 
and without ADHD (Yang et al., 2020). When emotion regulation subscales were probed 
in this study, CRP was related specifically to limited access to effective emotion regulation 
strategies. A similar positive association between emotional dysregulation and CRP was 
observed in a small sample of Black American women with diabetes (Powers et al., 2016). 
Two studies from the New England Family Study corroborate this finding with a related 
construct called “inappropriate self-regulation” (reflecting emotional functioning in children 
whose behavior was unrestrained and impulsive) in childhood predicting adult inflammatory 
outcomes. Children with higher inappropriate self-regulation had higher CRP as adults 
(Appleton et al., 2011) and this association was stronger for participants who grew up 
in families with lower income (Appleton et al., 2012). Counter to hypotheses, a study of 
low-income preschoolers found that stronger parent-reported emotion regulation skills were 
associated with higher TNF-α cross-sectionally (Miller et al., 2013). It is worth noting that 
this study was the smallest (n = 34) and it is possible that such young participants may not 
have experienced enough cumulative emotionally-triggered inflammatory responses to shift 
their inflammatory baseline. Further, this also was the only study on this topic to not include 
covariates; therefore, it is possible that untested confounds drove this unexpected result. 
Finally, if socioeconomic status is an important moderator of the relation between emotion 
regulation and inflammatory proteins in children, restricting this sample to low-income 
children might have reduced the variability in the variables analyzed, influencing results 
via Berkson’s bias (i.e., conditioning sample recruitment based on levels of an analyzed 
variable).

3.3.  Negative affectivity/emotional reactivity

Ten of the studies reviewed analyzed the associations between intensity of negative 
emotional responses and inflammatory proteins. The above-referenced investigations from 
the New England Family Study also evaluated emotional reactivity in the form of 
temperamental “distress proneness” (i.e., the tendency to be emotionally labile and easy 
to frustrate) in children significantly predicting adult CRP concentrations (Appleton et al., 
2011), which was stronger for children in low- and middle-income families relative to their 
high-income peers (Appleton et al., 2012). Further, parallel to the results with perceived 
emotion regulation broadly, the above-referenced study of pre-school aged children found 
that higher negative lability predicted elevated TNF-α cross-sectionally (Miller et al., 
2013). Negative affectivity also was associated with higher TNF-α in a study of the 
immunological correlates of “Type D personality” (defined as a combination of negative 
affectivity and tendency to inhibit emotional expression in social situations) in men with 
congestive heart failure (Denollet et al., 2003). Elevated emotional reactivity also was 
associated with higher levels of CRP in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder using

both continuous methods (Dargél et al., 2017) and clinical cut-offs (Dargél et al., 2020) 
of emotional reactivity. However, two of the cross-sectional studies with clinical samples 
found null associations. One case-control study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—
in which all participants, regardless of whether they had PTSD, had mechanical injuries 
to extremities—found no association between emotional reactivity and five inflammatory 
proteins (Gierlotka et al., 2015). Similarly, a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
found no association between emotional orientation (described as attending to, valuing, and 
experiencing emotions intensely) and IL-6 (van Middendorp et al., 2005).

Two of the studies reviewed tested associations between acute emotional reactivity and 
inflammatory proteins. The first, a case-control study of females with major depressive 
disorder (MDD) found that increased sadness reactivity during a sadness induction predicted 
greater IL-18 increases in controls but not participants with MDD (Prossin et al., 2011). 
The lack of association in participants with MDD might have been due to ceiling effects 
because individuals with MDD had higher IL-18 and negative affect compared to controls 
at baseline and the sample was small (n = 12 per group). Another study found negative 
affect post-Trier Social Stress Test was associated with greater IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, but 
emotional reactivity to an angry autobiographical memory recall was not associated with 
any of these three proteins (Newton et al., 2017). Importantly, both studies randomized 
participants to a distraction group or a resting group to create the opportunity for rumination.

3.4.  Expressive suppression vs. emotional expression

Twelve articles evaluated the association between tendencies to either express or suppress 
emotions and inflammatory biology. A cross-sectional study using data from the New 
England Family Study found that adults reporting higher levels of expressive suppression 
had higher levels of CRP (Appleton et al., 2013). Similarly, expressive suppression was 
positively associated with CRP and fibrinogen in trauma-exposed veterans (Khan et al., 
2020), IFN-γ and TNF-α in recently bereaved spouses (Lopez et al., 2020), and TNF-α 
in men with congestive heart failure (contextualized as “Type D” personality, as described 
in the study above; Denollet et al., 2003). Two studies evaluated expressive suppression 
as a moderator of childhood adversity. The first observed null main effects of expressive 
suppression on changes in CRP and IL-6 but found that expressive suppression interacted 
with childhood abuse such that expressive suppression amplified the positive association 
between child abuse and increases in CRP and IL-6 (Jones et al., 2022). The second 
explored whether expressive suppression also interacted with chronic family stress, which 
was not supported in a separate cross-sectional dataset (Jones et al., 2018). The rheumatoid 
arthritis study described above also did not find associations between IL-6 and subcategories 
of emotion regulation related to ambivalence or resistance to expressing emotions (van 
Middendorp et al., 2005).

Consistent with evidence that suppressing emotions might elevate inflammatory profiles, 
several studies indicated that processing and expressing emotions is associated with lower 
levels of circulating inflammatory proteins. For example, a small longitudinal study of 
men who had undergone radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 
the previous two years found that higher emotional processing predicted lower IL-6 four

months later (Hoyt et al., 2013). One study randomized dyads of married men and women 
to “conflict” or “no conflict” discussion with their partner and assessed changes in IL-6 
and TNF-α over 24 h. Higher cognitive processing word use, an indicator of emotion 
regulation, during conflictual conversation was associated with less steep IL-6 increases 
24-hours post-discussion (Graham et al., 2009). However, another acute stressor study found 
no associations between a related construct, trait “emotion approach coping” (described as a 
combination of purposeful emotional processing and emotional expression), and changes in 
salivary IL-6 (Master et al., 2009). It is important to note that this study was small (n = 22) 
and that emotional approach coping was measured at a different study visit than the stressor 
and inflammation measurements (the study provided no information on the average length 
of time between these visits), which may play a role in the lack of association observed. 
Interestingly, two studies from the same sample suggested that the association between some 
emotional regulation characteristics and inflammatory biology might be sex-specific and 
might also differ between cross-sectional and longitudinal modeling approaches. A cross-
sectional analysis for the INTERHEART study found null gender-stratified associations for a 
variety of emotion regulation-CRP associations (including emotional expression; Shimanoe 
et al., 2014); however, a later longitudinal analysis using the same data found that higher 
emotional expression was associated with less CRP over time in women (Shimanoe et al., 
2018).

3.5.  Cognitive reappraisal

Nine studies tested whether positive cognitive reappraisal, the technique of reinterpreting 
emotionally arousing situations to reduce negative emotions, is associated with 
inflammatory biology. The cross-sectional New England Family study that found that 
expressive suppression was associated with higher CRP also found that the tendency to 
positively reappraise negative scenarios was associated with lower CRP (Appleton et al., 
2013). A longitudinal sample observed consistent findings, with higher cognitive reappraisal 
being associated with decreases in IL-6, but not CRP, over time (Jones et al., 2022). 
A related construct, “shift-and-persist” (a combination of reappraisal and hopefulness/
purpose), was associated with lower CRP and IL-6 (modeled as a composite) in adolescents 
but not parents (Chen et al., 2015). Conversely, no evidence of a direct association between 
cognitive reappraisal and inflammatory proteins (including CRP) was found in a study of 
recently bereaved spouses (Lopez et al., 2020), a large community sample (Shimanoe et 
al., 2014), or a sample of trauma exposed veterans (Khan et al., 2020), all of which were 
cross-sectional.

Five studies evaluated cognitive reappraisal as a moderator to buffer stress or stress-
generative characteristics. Similar to the pattern of results for emotional expression in 
the INKHEART study described above, cognitive reappraisal did not interact with stress 
to predict CRP in cross-sectional data (Shimanoe et al., 2014), but this interaction was 
significant when predicting change in CRP over time (Shimanoe et al., 2018). Specifically, 
cognitive reappraisal buffered the risk that elevated stress in the past year had on 
longitudinal changes in CRP for men. Cognitive reappraisal also buffered the association

(focused on health-related cognitions) also interacted with an inability to disengage from 
unattainable goals (but not the capacity to re-engage with goals) to be associated with 
elevated CRP in female breast cancer survivors (Castonguay et al., 2014). Finally, cognitive 
reappraisal was not a moderator of the cross-sectional relation between chronic family stress 
and CRP in a community sample (Jones et al., 2018).

3.6.  Perseverance vs. distraction/disengagement

The most commonly assessed emotion regulation characteristics were related to 
perseverative cognitive styles. Interestingly, all four studies that tested main effects between 
perseverative cognitive styles and inflammatory biology in observational data (cross-
sectional or gender-stratified analyses in longitudinal data) found null results (Gierlotka 
et al., 2015; Knight et al., 2022; Ysseldyk et al., 2018) and one study found associations 
in the opposite direction than hypothesized (Segerstrom et al., 2017). With respect to the 
latter, this study also found a significant interaction between repetitive thoughts and verbal 
IQ predicting IL-6 in an unexpected direction. Specifically, IL-6 was relatively stable for 
those with higher IQs, regardless of repetitive thought, but was negatively associated with 
repetitive thought at lower IQ levels. Notably, the average IQ of the sample was almost 1 
standard deviation higher than would be expected (IQ tests are normed to have a mean of 
100 and SD of 15). Additionally, as part of an exploratory analysis, a quadratic relation 
between rumination and IQ was found such that the inverse association between repetitive 
thought and IL-6 was strongest at lower levels of repetitive thought.

Three studies that measured acute inflammatory reactivity to acute laboratory stressors 
found results more consistent with theory that perseverative thoughts about negative 
situations and emotions would increase levels of inflammatory proteins. One study of female 
college undergraduates who completed a social stress task found that random assignment to 
an instructed rumination condition led to steeper increases in CRP compared to an instructed 
distraction condition (Zoccola et al., 2014). A different study using a social stressor that 
randomized some participants to a rest condition to make the opportunity for rumination or 
a distraction condition found that although no group difference was observed, higher trait 
rumination was associated with increases in salivary IL-6 after a social stressor (Newton 
et al., 2017). The total number of people in the rest condition who reported ruminating 
in post-stressor assessments was low (8 out of 45 people), which might have attenuated 
observable group-level effects relative to studies that instructed participants to ruminate. 
This publication also featured a second study with an angry autobiographical memory 
stressor and randomization to the same conditions and found that the rest/rumination 
group experienced steeper increases in IL-1β relative to the distraction condition. The final 
experiment randomly assigned textile handcrafters to: (a) a writing exercise designed to 
induce rumination, (b) a neutral ego contemplation, or (c) textile art making (hypothesized 
to be a positive emotional experience) after instructed recall of an upsetting memory (Collier 
et al., 2016). Significant increases in IL-1β only were observed in the rumination condition.

Several of the studies by the authors of this review investigated perseverative thinking styles 
as moderators of the relation between arousal-modulating characteristics and inflammatory 
biology in a vulnerability-stress conceptualization. For example, a more perseverative

cognitive response style ratio (quantified as rumination/[distraction + problem-solving]) 
amplified the relation between reward drive (the domain of reward functioning related to 
intensity and arousal in the pursuit of rewards) and increases in IL-6 (but not IL-8) to a 
social stress task (Moriarity et al., 2020b). When this interaction was followed-up with 
an investigation of individual cognitive styles, all 3 subscales interacted with reward drive 
to predict change in IL-6. Specifically, high rumination amplified the association between 
reward drive and increases in IL-6 (the other subscale results are described in thematically 
appropriate sections, below). Another study in a community sample of adults selected for 
high or moderate reward sensitivity found that self-focused rumination aimed to promote 
positive affect interacted with high reward sensitivity to predict IL-8 (Moriarity et al., 
2020a). Conversely, higher levels of perseverative thought aimed at dampening positive 
affect interacted with low reward sensitivity to predict higher CRP. Finally, in the same 
sample of adolescents as the first study of this paragraph, higher rumination amplified 
the association between baseline anxiety symptoms and increases in IL-6 (but not CRP) 
over time (Moriarity et al., 2018). Further, data supported a moderated mediation in which 
changes in IL-6 partially mediated the association between baseline anxiety and changes 
in depression and this indirect effect was amplified in adolescents who tend to ruminate 
on negative affect. Another study from a different research team found that low levels of 
repetitive negative thinking interacted with higher socioeconomic status (SES) to predict less 
IL-6 in a longitudinal sample of pregnant women (Mitchell & Christian, 2019).

Finally, some studies evaluated tendencies to disengage from perseverative cognitions as a 
protective factor against elevated inflammation. For example, a small study of adult women 
featuring a social stress task followed by either 5 min of directed rumination or distraction 
found that trait reflection, a characteristic of “intellectual self-attentiveness” described as an 
emotionally-neutral cognition compared to the negative focus of rumination, was negatively 
associated with change in IL-6 post stressor (Woody et al., 2016). A study in the same 
sample (referenced above; Zoccola et al., 2014) found that participants in the distraction 
group had shorter inflammatory spikes that started to return to baseline by the end of 
the visit (roughly 50 min post-stressor), unlike the rumination group whose IL-6 did not 
decrease in the timeframe assessed. A separate study pairing an acute stressor (an angry 
autobiographical memory) with a resting/rumination and distraction condition found that 
participants in the distraction condition had less steep increases in IL-1β post-stressor 
(Newton et al., 2017). Further, the tendency to cognitively respond to negative emotion with 
distraction buffered the positive association between reward drive and increases in IL-6 post-
social stressor in adolescents (Moriarity et al., 2020b). The above-referenced cross-sectional 
study in the INTERHEART cohort found that the tendency to disengage from stressful 
situations and negative emotions was associated with lower CRP concentrations in men, 
but not women (Shimanoe et al., 2014). Conversely, a daily diary study in adolescents did 
not support a hypothesized buffering interaction between various negative life events and 
disengagement predicting CRP (Low et al., 2013).

3.7.  Psychological flexibility

Two studies tested either psychological flexibility or acceptance (a skill that helps foster 
psychological flexibility). One cross-sectional analysis examining acceptance in a case-

control study of high-stress caregivers of children with Autism and non-high stress 
caregivers of neurotypical children did not find significant associations between acceptance 
and either CRP or IL-6 (Crosswell et al., 2022). Interactions between acceptance and 
parental stress predicting these proteins were also null. A separate study of overweight or 
obese, high-stress individuals tested post-Acceptance and Commitment Therapy levels of 
psychological flexibility (both general and specific to weight-related difficulties) predicting 
levels of CRP, IL-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin 6 months later also found null results 
(Järvelä-Reijonen et al., 2020).

3.8.  Positive coping/social support seeking

Several other studies investigated emotion regulation characteristics hypothesized to be 
negatively associated with inflammatory proteins. For example, the daily diary study 
described above found that, unlike disengagement, positive engagement coping (the 
tendency to change focus to positive qualities of life, keep a sense of humor, strategize how 
to handle the situation, focus on self-improvement) buffered the positive association between 
(a) conflictual life events, (b) daily interpersonal conflicts/tension, and (c) total negative life 
events and CRP (Low et al., 2013). Further, one study found that reward drive predicted 
greater increases in IL-6 post stressor for adolescents with low trait problem solving when 
feeling negative emotions relative to adolescents with greater proclivities to problem solve 
(Moriarity et al., 2020). Additionally, adults low in coping self-efficacy (confidence in one’s 
ability to navigate difficult situations through emotion regulation, problem-solving, and 
social support) had higher TNF-α and IL-10 (Hladek et al., 2020). Finally, high tendency to 
seek emotional support socially was associated with lower CRP in adults with high levels of 
perceived stress (Shimanoe et al., 2014).

4.  Discussion

This systematic review summarizes the findings of 38 studies that investigated associations 
between emotion regulation and inflammatory proteins. Broadly, there was support for 
the hypothesis that emotion regulation abilities are related to differences in inflammatory 
activity. Specifically, 74% of studies found results consistent with the hypothesis that 
difficulty regulating emotion was associated with elevated inflammatory biology whereas 
skillful emotion regulation was associated with lower inflammation. However, the 
consistency of empirical support differed as a function of the specific aspects of emotion 
regulation examined and study methodology (Table 2), supporting the decision to not 
aggregate these studies in a quantitative, meta-analytic review.

Relations between broadly defined emotion regulation/dysregulation and inflammatory 
proteins were observed in all five articles reviewed, although one of these studies found 
an association in the direction opposite to hypotheses and results from the other four 
studies (i.e., better emotion regulation was associated with higher concentrations of 
inflammatory proteins). Higher negative affectivity and emotional reactivity were associated 
with elevated levels of inflammatory proteins in eight of 10 studies reviewed. Of the 
articles testing associations between tendencies to suppress vs. express emotions and 
inflammatory proteins, five of seven supported the hypothesis that suppressing emotions

would be related to elevated inflammatory biology; whereas a less convincing proportion 
(three of five) found that emotional expression was associated with lower concentrations of 
inflammatory proteins. It is possible that “expressing emotions” is not a specific enough 
construct to reliably associate with inflammatory outcomes. For example, “expressing 
emotions” could equally take the form of collaborative, healthy discussion in a productive 
manner with friends or expressing emotions in a hostile, confrontational manner. Slightly 
above half (five of nine) of the studies that examined cognitive reappraisal supported an 
association between reappraisal of negative situations and emotions as a protective factor 
against higher inflammation. The most common emotion regulation category reviewed was 
perseverative cognition vs. distraction/disengagement. Of the 14 studies reviewed, ten found 
evidence for a relation between these emotion regulation characteristics and inflammatory 
biology, three found null results, and one found results opposite of the hypothesized 
direction (e.g., more repetitive thought led to lower concentrations of inflammation in 
individuals with lower verbal IQ scores; Segerstrom et al., 2017). Neither of the two 
studies testing psychological flexibility (either generally or the subcomponent of acceptance) 
found significant associations with inflammatory biology. Plausibly, this might be due to 
psychological flexibility/acceptance being skills that open up the ability to engage with 
alternate responses to emotion; thus, they could facilitate inflammatory modulation emotion 
regulation but themselves are not sufficient. But, with only two published studies in this 
category, more work is needed. The remaining emotion characteristics were grouped into a 
“positive coping/social support-seeking” category. All four included studies supported that 
these traits predicted lower concentrations of inflammatory proteins. In sum, the evidence 
from this systematic review supports that emotion regulation is a modulator of inflammatory 
biology.

4.1. 

Integration of inflammation into emotion regulation models of risk

Given the breadth of physical and psychological health outcomes associated with emotion 
regulation and inflammation, it is critical for future work to consider integrated, multi-level 
frameworks of risk to develop theory. Establishment of etiological theories integrating 
malleable psychological (e.g., emotion regulation) and biological (e.g., inflammatory 
biology) constructs are critical for maximally comprehensive, and maximally flexible, 
healthcare (Moriarity, 2021). One such model tested by three studies in this review is 
an immunocognitive model of psychopathology (Moriarity et al., 2018, 2020b, 2020a), 
in which cognitive vulnerabilities (e.g., emotion regulation) amplify the impact of stress 
or stress-modulating characteristics (e.g., anxiety) on inflammation in ways that increase 
risk for psychopathology (e.g., depression). However, it is plausible to consider that this 
mechanistic pathway also might be relevant for many, if not all, inflammation-mediated 
disease processes (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).

Clinically, identifying both psychosocial and biological treatment targets better facilitates 
comprehensive health care and coordination among medical and psychological members of 
a treatment team. Fully characterizing a risk pathway provides flexibility for idiosyncratic 
needs of patients. For example, if dysphoria or fatigue are obstacles to treatment adherence 
targeting emotion regulation (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapies), understanding that 
reducing inflammation might improve these symptoms (Moriarity et al., 2022; Moriarity,

Kautz et al., 2020) could warrant consideration of anti-inflammatory adjunctive medications. 
Conversely, some clients are unable, or unwilling, to take anti-inflammatory medications 
for an immune-mediated disease (e.g., arthritis, HIV/AIDS). Targeting inflammation using 
emotion regulation skills in a psychosocial intervention (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapies) 
might be an effective means of symptom reduction. Reduced inflammation might even be 
a biological mediator of some of the beneficial outcomes of psychosocial interventions 
(Shields et al., 2020).

In addition to treatment implications, it is critical to consider how these findings 
might facilitate fostering resiliency. This perspective helps health providers reduce illness 
recurrence and can inform organizational strategy (e.g., first year college orientation 
activities and resources) and policy change (e.g., educational materials provided to public 
schools). This review covers several emotion regulation skills (e. g., cognitive reappraisal, 
problem solving, distraction, social support-seeking) that might buffer the impacts of stress 
on inflammatory biology and inflammation-related outcomes. Although all of these skills 
plausibly could reduce the negative emotional impact of an event/stressor, social support-
seeking (only evaluated in one reviewed study) might be a particularly promising emotion 
regulation skill for future research given empirical work suggesting that social stressors 
are particularly strongly associated with inflammatory stress responses (Dickerson et al., 
2009; Slavich et al., 2020). Social Safety Theory argues that social safety schemas (socially-
specific schemas about social safety or threat) are of particular importance for biological and 
psychological health (Slavich, 2020, 2022, Slavich et al., 2023).

4.2.  Methodological implications

Across different emotion regulation traits, several methodological characteristics seemed 
to be associated with results in the hypothesized directions (i.e., difficulty with emotion 
regulation relating to higher concentrations of inflammatory proteins).

4.3.  Longitudinal data

Longitudinal datasets investigating change in inflammatory proteins as a function of emotion 
regulation traits resulted in a greater proportion of results in the direction hypothesized 
relative to cross-sectional studies (77% vs. 63%), especially for studies testing perseverative 
thinking. For studies with repeated measures, this could be partially due to the benefit 
of being able to account for baseline levels of inflammatory proteins and focus on within-
person change. Given the necessity of longitudinal data for analyses to have the potential 
causal relevance necessary to build and evaluate models of risk and resilience, this finding 
highlights the importance of collecting multiple timepoints of emotion regulation and 
inflammatory data in future research. Importantly, this distinction also suggests temporal 
specificity (Moriarity and Alloy, 2021)—, namely the possibility of the strength of the 
association between emotion regulation and inflammatory biology to change over time. 
This physiometric information is critical to design future research studies testing the extent 
to which emotion regulation characteristics influence trajectories of inflammation, in both 
observational and intervention studies.

4.4.  Acute stressor designs

Testing emotion regulation as a predictor of inflammatory reactivity to an acute stressor 
also provided a higher proportion of theory-consistent results relative to naturalistic, cross-
sectional studies (88% vs. 63%). Similar to longitudinal data, this may be due to the ability 
to account for baseline levels of inflammatory proteins and quantify within-person change. 
Acute stressors also provide the opportunity to evaluate specific contexts (e.g., social 
stressors) that might be most impactful to train emotion regulation skills and mitigate impact 
on inflammatory outcomes. Further, randomization to various conditions with instructed 
engagement in particular emotion regulation strategies (e.g., rumination vs. distraction; 
Woody et al., 2016; Zoccola et al., 2014)) can facilitate direct comparison of different 
emotion regulation options people use in response to a common stressor. Acute stressors 
also provide an important opportunity to test state emotion regulation/dysregulation as a 
predictor of inflammatory reactivity, whereas other designs typically rely on self-report 
of trait emotion regulation/reactivity. Given recent research on how individuals transition 
between using various emotion regulation strategies (Daniel et al., 2022), one important 
future direction that might be testable in an acute stressor design would be to evaluate how 
individual differences in emotion regulation transitions relate to inflammatory outcomes. 
Additionally, given evidence that different affective reactions have different inflammatory 
correlates (Carroll et al., 2011), future acute stressor studies should collect data on specific 
affective responses in addition to generalized distress.

4.5.  Vulnerability-stress framework

Another factor that was associated with high theoretical consistency of results was the 
evaluation of emotion regulation characteristics (especially perseverative thinking) in the 
context of either stress (e.g., perceived stress, childhood trauma) or a variable that modulates 
stress responses or exposure (e.g., anxiety symptoms). Specifically, 81% of such studies 
found theoretically consistent results relative to 69% of the remaining studies. Given that the 
use of emotion regulation characteristics is contingent on emotional responses/exposure to 
emotionally-salient events, moderation studies might be particularly relevant for advancing 
theory on the association between emotion regulation, inflammation, and related health 
outcomes. It is important to note that by “moderation” studies we both refer to statistical 
moderation, as well as study designs that allow for tests of emotion regulation in the context 
of experienced emotion that can be regulated (e.g., acute stressor designs).

4.6.  Context matters: actionable stressors

One critical detail that is not included in any of the reviewed articles, and thus could 
not be evaluated in this systematic review, is how specific contextual details of a stressor 
influence which emotion regulation skills/traits might be adaptive. Specifically, the ability 
of an individual to successfully intervene on a stressor by taking action might influence 
the long-term usefulness of a given emotion regulation strategy (Ford and Troy, 2019), a 
distinction taught as a foundational perspective in several psychotherapeutic frameworks 
(e.g., dialectical behavioral therapy). For example, problem-solving and/or emotional 
expression might be most adaptive in situations where an individual’s actions can change 
the situation (e.g., discussing boundaries and separating household responsibilities with

a roommate). On the other hand, emotion-focused strategies like cognitive reappraisal, 
acceptance, and social support seeking might be best suited for stressors out of an 
individual’s realm of influence (e.g., the loss of a loved one). Future research and theory 
development should be careful to consider the limits of agency in emotionally-arousing 
situations to ensure maximum clinical-translatability. Two strategies for incorporating this 
nuance in future research are (a) comparing the interaction between different types of 
stressors and different emotion regulation traits and/or (b) using “common stressor” designs 
in which all participants experience the same, naturally occurring stressor.

4.7.  Clinical research

Finally, much information could be gained from intervention research targeting emotion 
regulation characteristics. It is worth noting that several intervention studies that plausibly 
target emotion regulation were found during the initial literature search and excluded 
because they did not specifically test whether reductions in dysfunctional emotion regulation 
covaried with reductions in inflammatory biology. Given that the behavioral foci of many 
psychosocial interventions could have impacts on inflammatory biology (e.g., changes to 
appetite, substance use, or diet), there are many opportunities for confounds in psychosocial 
intervention studies unless specifically analyzed to test whether reductions in maladaptive 
emotion regulation are associated with inflammation. Therefore, we look forward to 
secondary data analysis on this topic in the future that, if results support this line of inquiry, 
can inform the design of intervention studies specifically created to test these research 
questions. To the extent that sample size might be a concern for readers with access to 
relevant data, we refer them to integrative data analysis (which facilitates the combination of 
different datasets) as a potential resource (Curran and Hussong, 2009) to aggregate multiple 
relevant datasets.

5.  Conclusion

This systematic review of 2816 studies broadly found support for an association between 
a variety of emotion regulation constructs and inflammatory biology. We propose that 
integrated, multi-level theories of disease risk incorporating emotion regulation and 
inflammation as inter-related risk factors might result in more comprehensive treatment 
plans that provide flexibility for client needs and preferences. Across emotion regulation 
domains, theory-consistent results (i.e., difficulties with emotion regulation being associated 
with higher concentrations of inflammatory proteins) seemed to be more likely with 
longitudinal data, studies leveraging acute stressors, and/or studies testing vulnerability-
stress models of risk for elevated inflammation.

Note: *Vulnerability-Stress is defined as either (a) testing emotion regulation as a predictor of inflammatory reactivity to an acute stressor or (b) 
testing whether emotion regulation moderates the association between reported stress or a stress-modulating variable (e.g., anxiety symptoms) and 
inflammatory biology. Also, note that some individual studies fit into multiple categories.
