Abstract

Importance—Previous evidence has implicated corticostriatal abnormalities in the 
pathophysiology of psychosis. Although the striatum is the primary target of all efficacious 
antipsychotics, the relationship between its functional connectivity and symptomatic reduction 
remains unknown.

Objective—The present study examined the longitudinal effect of treatment with second-
generation antipsychotics on functional connectivity of the striatum during the resting state in 
patients experiencing a first-episode of psychosis.

Design—Prospective, controlled study, with medications administered in double-blind, 
randomized manner.

Setting—Clinical research center

Participants—Twenty-four patients with first-episode psychosis and twenty-four healthy 
participants, matched for age, sex, education, and handedness.

Interventions—Patients were scanned at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with either 
risperidone or aripiprazole. Their symptoms were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating 
Scale at baseline and follow-up. Healthy participants were scanned twice with a 12 week interval.

Main Outcome Measures—Functional connectivity of striatal regions was examined using a 
seed-based approach. Changes in functional connectivity of these seeds were compared with 
reductions in ratings of psychotic symptoms.

Results—As psychosis improved, we observed an increase in functional connectivity between 
striatal seed regions and the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and limbic regions 
such as the hippocampus and anterior insula. Conversely, a negative relationship was observed 
between reduction in psychosis and functional connectivity of striatal regions with structures 
within the parietal lobe.

Conclusions and Relevance—Our results indicate that corticostriatal functional 
dysconnectivity in psychosis is a state-dependent phenomenon. Increased functional connectivity 
of the striatum with prefrontal and limbic regions may be a biomarker for improvement in 
symptoms associated with antipsychotic treatment.

Disruptions in corticostriatal circuitry have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
schizophrenia. Early proposals linked schizophrenia with decreases in dopamine in the 
prefrontal cortex, and excessive dopamine in the striatum1,2. Although elevated striatal 
dopamine has been shown in patients with schizophrenia3, their unaffected relatives4, and in 
individuals who are at-risk for developing psychotic symptoms5, corticostriatal relationships 
have also been demonstrated to play a central role in psychosis. Early positron emission 
tomography (PET) work found that severity of psychotic symptoms correlated with 
abnormal patterns of blood flow in limbic and prefrontal cortical regions6. Studies in 
schizophrenia using functional MRI (fMRI) have reported abnormal corticostriatal 
activation during reward7,8, and executive processing9,10. Evidence from functional 
connectivity and multimodal studies have shown altered corticostriatal circuitry in chronic 
patients with schizophrenia11,12, and in patients with prodromal psychotic symptoms13,14. 
Of note, a recent family-based study suggested that altered functional connectivity between 
striatum and cortical regions may represent a risk phenotype in patients with first-episode 
psychosis and in their relatives15.

Despite the evidence implicating corticostriatal links in psychosis, there is a paucity of data 
directly examining the relationship between corticostriatal functional connectivity and the 
clinical effects of antipsychotic agents. Structures of the striatum are of particular interest 
when considering the effects of treatment since they harbor the largest density of dopamine 
D2 receptors16. Although antipsychotic drugs vary in their potency and effect on cortical 
and subcortical functions, all known antipsychotic agents bind to the D2 receptor17. A few 
studies have used a longitudinal study design to examine the effects of antipsychotic 
treatment with network-based analyses18–20, and during reward processing21, but do not 
directly address the question of symptom-related changes in striatal connectivity.

Methods

Participants

In the present study our goal was to examine the relationship between changes in striatal 
circuitry and reduction in psychotic symptoms after treatment with antipsychotic 
medications. We used a prospective study design in which resting state fMRI scans were 
collected in a cohort of patients with first episode schizophrenia and a matched healthy 
comparison group at two time points. Scans in the patient group were collected at baseline 
and after twelve weeks of treatment with a second-generation antipsychotic; healthy 
comparison participants were also scanned with a twelve week interval.

To interrogate the functional networks of the striatum, we employed a seed-based approach 
first proposed by Di Martino et al 200822. We tested the effect of antipsychotic treatment on 
the functional circuitry of striatum by comparing changes in connectivity of our striatal seed 
regions and changes in psychotic symptomatology. Our primary hypothesis was that 
functional connections with cortical regions would be strengthened and normalized as 
psychotic symptoms resolve, specifically with prefrontal and limbic regions that have been 
implicated to be impaired in schizophrenia. In order to test this hypothesis, we first needed 
to create functional maps from our healthy comparison group at baseline. We hypothesized 
that our functional maps will replicate the anteroposterior separation of positive and 
negative striatal correlations observed previously22. At baseline, we expected to see 
frontostriatal decoupling in our patients relative to the healthy comparison group, which 
would then normalize as a function of successful treatment. By contrast, we did not expect 
to see changes associated merely with the passage of time.

Patients aged 15 to 40 years old with first-episode psychosis (FEP) underwent resting state 
fMRI scanning and symptom ratings at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with either 
risperidone or aripiprazole as a part of an NIMH-funded, double blind, randomized control 
trial (R01MH060004). FEP includes a variety of diagnostic categories; our investigation was 
limited to subjects with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (i.e. schizophrenia, 
schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder, not otherwise 
specified). All patients were required to have 2 weeks or less of cumulative lifetime 
exposure to antipsychotics to enter the clinical trial. A healthy comparison (HC) group was 
also scanned at two time points with a 12-week interval (Table 1). Patient diagnoses were 
based on the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV 
Disorders (SCID), supplemented by information from clinicians and, when available, family 
members. After complete description of the study to the participants, written informed 
consent (written assent and written parental/guardian consent for those under age 18 years) 
was obtained as per a protocol that was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. Additional details regarding exclusion 
criteria for our study participants are available in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

After providing informed consent, all patients received double blind treatment with either 
risperidone (dose range: 1–6 mg) or aripiprazole (5–30 mg) for 16 weeks. Details regarding 
supplemental medications allowed in our patients are available in the eAppendix in the 
Supplement. Clinical ratings were administered weekly for the first month, and then every

two weeks thereafter until week 12. To evaluate psychotic symptoms, the Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale - Anchored version (BPRS-A) was used. For our analyses, we were concerned 
only with symptoms reflective of psychosis. As such, we utilized three items from the 
BPRS-A that assess positive psychotic symptoms -- unusual thought content, hallucinations, 
and conceptual disorganization -- in order to obtain a measure of psychotic symptoms (PSx), 
termed by previous studies, as a thought disturbance rating23.

All fMRI exams were conducted on a 3T scanner (GE Signa HDx). Further details are 
provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement. During resting state scanning, participants 
were asked to close their eyes and instructed not to think of anything in particular. All 
participants were spoken to between scan sequences to ensure they were not asleep, and no 
behavioral differences were observed between groups during scanning.

Image analysis and Preprocessing

We used FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) and AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni) based 
script libraries from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (http://www.nitrc.org/
projects/fcon_1000 35) for preprocessing of resting-state scans (“fcon scripts”). Details 
regarding preprocessing steps are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement.

Functional connectivity analyses

To test the functional connectivity of subregions of the striatum within the putamen, caudate 
nucleus, and nucleus accumbens, we used a seed based approach. We utilized methods 
described in Di Martino et al. 200822. The central coordinates of the regions of interest 
(ROIs) were taken from that study and used to create 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm, spherical ROIs. 
ROIs were defined, bilaterally, in: dorsal caudate (DC) (x = ±13, y = 15, z = 9), ventral 
caudate (VSS) (x = ±10, y = 15, z = 0), ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens (VSI) (x = ±9, y 
= 9, z = −8), dorsal rostral putamen (DRP) (x = ±25, y = 8, z = 6), dorsal caudal putamen 
(DCP) (x = ±28, y = 1, z = 3), and ventral rostral putamen (VRP) (x = ±20, y = 12, z = −3).

Once ROIs were defined, AFNI based scripts from the 1000 Functional Connectomes 
Project were used to create correlation maps for each participant for all 12 of our ROIs. 
Mean activity time courses were extracted from each seed region. Whole-brain voxel-wise 
correlation maps for each ROI were created with the extracted waveform as a reference. The 
resulting correlation maps were Z-transformed.

For group level analyses we used SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). One sample t-
tests were performed with group level correlation maps for each ROI in our baseline HC 
group. Results were visualized at p<0.05, uncorrected, for both positive and negative 
correlations for each of our ROIs. A relatively liberal threshold was used for these initial 
analyses, as these were used to create masks for subsequent analyses testing our primary 
hypothesis. We found good separation of networks with our ROIs in both the positive and 
negative directions, consistent with results from Di Martino et al. 200822. Results for all 
other analyses were considered significant if they surpassed a threshold of p<0.05, corrected 
for false discovery rate (FDR), by the standard function provided with the SPM package24.

Baseline and follow up scans within each group and between groups were compared by two 
sample t-tests in SPM.

To compare changes in PSx ratings with longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of 
our striatal ROIs in our FEP group, we subtracted the baseline scan from the follow-up scan 
(Follow-up - baseline) using FSLMATHS. This image -- representing the change in 
correlation at each voxel -- was then taken into a group level multiple regression analysis 
with reduction in PSx (baseline PSx - follow-up PSx) as a regressor. This analysis was 
performed separately for each ROI, explicitly masked within the binary mask from the 
corresponding HC network. To visualize our correlations, we extracted and plotted data 
from the most significant voxel within clusters that surpassed our threshold for significance.

Results

Demographics

A total of 24 FEP patients and an age-, sex-, education-, and handedness-matched cohort of 
24 HC participants were included in the present study (Table 1). Patients had a median 
exposure of one day to antipsychotic medication prior to being scanned (Mean [SD] = 4.5 
[6.1]; Table 1). Eleven patients were treated with aripiprazole and thirteen patients were 
treated with risperidone. Due to the limited power we did not perform analyses to separate 
drug specific effects (see eAppendix for Supplement).

Baseline correlations

All twelve of our striatal seed ROIs (six per hemisphere) showed well-delineated patterns of 
positive and negative functional connectivity (Figure 1), similar to those described by Di 
Martino and colleagues22. Across all seeds, we observed a general anteroposterior pattern of 
correlative activity: positive correlations were limited to more frontal regions and negative 
correlations were generally observed in more posterior regions (Figure 1). Additionally we 
observe laterality of functional maps. In particular, the DC showed ipsilateral functional 
connectivity with more dorsal prefrontal regions.

Both positive and negative masks were created from all 12 connectivity maps in our HC 
group at baseline with a threshold of p <0.05, uncorrected. Our subsequent analyses that 
involved psychotic symptom ratings were limited within these reference masks.

Between Groups Comparisons

In our between group analyses, we compared connectivity maps of all 12 ROIs at baseline in 
our FEP and HC groups. No results in either masked or whole-brain analyses were observed 
at our level of significance (p < 0.05, FDR corrected).

Between Scan Comparison

Our HC group showed no significant changes in functional connectivity in masked or 
whole-brain analyses of all 12 of our seed ROIs when baseline scans were compared with 
follow-up scans in a paired manner. Our FEP group showed only one significant, masked, 
finding between baseline and follow-up scans in paired comparisons: the right VSS showed

increased connectivity with the thalamus on the left side, and a cluster of voxels adjacent to 
the seed within the nucleus accumbens on the right side (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for 
details).

Increase in Striatal Functional Connectivity with Treatment Response

Antipsychotic treatment in our cohort of patients with FEP resulted in an overall significant 
reduction in positive symptoms (Mean [SD] PSx score at baseline= 11 [2.6], at 12 
weeks=5.6 [2.6]; T = 7.35, p<0.0001), as measured by our PSx score, a composite of items 
reflective of psychosis from the BPRS. We performed multiple regression analyses in our 
FEP group to compare PSx at baseline and follow-up, as well as the reduction in PSx with 
changes in functional connectivity of each of our seed ROIs. No significant correlations 
were observed between PSx and functional connectivity of our ROIs at baseline or follow-
up. Greater reduction in PSx showed a robust, positive correlation with increased functional 
connectivity between right DC and prefrontal regions that include the orbitofrontal cortex, 
anterior cingulate, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Figure 2; Table 2). As 
psychosis resolved, the right VSI seed showed a significant increase in connectivity with a 
cluster of voxels located in the left hippocampus (Figure 2; Table 2). Similarly, as symptoms 
improved, the right VRP seed showed increased functional connectivity with anterior 
cingulate and right anterior insula (Figure 2; Table 2). No other seed regions showed results 
that survived correction for multiple comparisons. We observed no significant findings at 
the whole brain level outside of masks derived from our HC group.

Decrease in Striatal Functional Connectivity with Treatment Response

Conversely, in several ROIs we observed significant negative correlations between symptom 
improvement and change in functional connectivity with posterior regions. This pattern 
mirrored the negative correlation maps we observe with our seeds in the HC group at 
baseline (Figure 1). With improvement in PSx, we observe significantly less connectivity 
between right VSI and bilateral superior parietal lobule and supramarginal gyrus (Figure 3; 
Table 2). Similarly, as psychosis improves, left VSS shows less connectivity with superior 
parietal lobe (Figure 3; Table 2). No additional findings were observed outside of our masks 
at the whole brain level.

Discussion

We utilized resting state fMRI to examine the effects of treatment with either aripiprazole or 
risperidone on functional networks of striatal regions in a unique cohort of patients with first 
episode psychosis. Scans were collected in a longitudinal study design, pre- and post- twelve 
weeks of controlled treatment. With improvement of psychosis, we observed a significant 
increase in functional connectivity between the right dorsal caudate and several prefrontal 
regions that include the anterior cingulate, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the 
orbitofrontal cortex. Additionally, as psychotic symptoms resolved, we observed an increase 
in functional connectivity between the right ventral caudate/nucleus accumbens and 
hippocampus, and between a seed region placed within the ventral putamen with anterior 
insula. Finally, we also found that as symptoms improved, the ventral caudate showed 
decreased functional connectivity with posterior regions. Intriguingly, these regions in

superior parietal lobe and supramarginal gyrus were noted to be negatively connected with 
striatal regions at baseline in our HC group (Figure 1).

As hypothesized, our results demonstrate that symptomatic improvement of psychosis is 
associated with alterations in functional connections of the striatum, a structure consistently 
implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis and shared site of D2 receptor binding of all 
antipsychotic agents17. One region that showed robust changes in functional interactions as 
psychosis improved, is the dorsal caudate, also known as the associative caudate. This 
region has been shown to be anatomically and functionally connected to the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex22, 25, 26. A large body of evidence has linked striatum with dorsolateral 
prefrontal regions in psychosis12–15. Our results extend these findings and demonstrate that 
this link is modulated by pharmacologic intervention in a manner that correlates with 
symptom reduction. Additionally, our finding of significantly increased connectivity 
between striatal regions and dorsal anterior cingulate implicate a role for error monitoring 
and cognitive control in recovery from psychotic symptoms27. Our work supports previous 
results that demonstrate second-generation antipsychotic treatment based alterations in blood 
flow to the anterior cingulate28.

Psychotic phenomenology has been characterized as the result of abnormal assignment of 
salience to internal and external stimuli29, 30. Several brain regions from the present study 
that demonstrate increased striatal connectivity in response to treatment have been 
implicated in the normal attribution of salience. Specifically, as psychotic symptoms remit, 
the ventral putamen showed increased connectivity with anterior insula and anterior 
cingulate, both of which are regions that have been linked to the salience network 11. 
Findings in the present study suggest that changes in the functional coordination between 
striatum and prefrontal and limbic systems may influence salience processing as psychotic 
symptoms are reduced. In support of this hypothesis, induction of psychosis by cannabis has 
shown to modulate activation of caudate and prefrontal cortex during salience processing31.

Interestingly we did not observe significant baseline differences in functional connectivity of 
the striatum between healthy individuals and our patients with psychosis. A recent study by 
Fornito and colleagues suggested that frontostriatal dysconnectivity is an endophenotype for 
psychosis by showing decreased coupling between striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex in the unaffected relatives of patients15. While our study did not address familiality, 
baseline differences in connectivity patterns between studies may be related to differences in 
clinical variables, imaging parameters, and statistical approaches.

While previous fMRI studies have reported cross-sectional evidence linking reduced striatal 
signal and psychotic symptomotology32–34, our study utilized a longitudinal approach to 
examine the effects of antipsychotic medications on network-based functional connectivity 
measures. To our knowledge, only one resting state fMRI study has been reported that 
examines antipsychotic treatment and functional connectivity in first episode schizophrenia. 
Lui and colleagues observed treatment-based disruption in connectivity between brain 
regions and functional circuits in conjunction with altered low frequency fMRI signal within 
cortical regions and striatum18. They did not report changes in functional circuitry that 
correlate with treatment efficacy, and further, the study did not specifically examine cortico-

striatal connectivity with an anatomically driven approach. Additionally, one longitudinal 
PET study observed decreased connectivity of medial frontal cortex with hippocampus and 
ventral striatum after treatment19, while a task-based fMRI study reported alterations in 
default mode network connectivity after olanzapine treatment20. Other neuroimaging studies 
have also taken a longitudinal approach to test the effects of antipsychotic treatment on task-
based activation, and generally report normalization of signal after treatment 35, 36.

The present study also contributes to the evolving field of biomarkers for psychotic 
disorders and treatment response. Previous studies have shown differential neuroimaging 
signals based on treatment response37. Additionally, differences in response to treatment 
with antipsychotic medications have been associated with polymorphisms in the gene coding 
for the D2 receptor38, 39. Independently, DRD2 variation has been shown to be related to 
functional engagement of frontostriatal circuits40. Further studies are required to clarify the 
association between our finding of treatment related modulation of corticostriatal 
interactions and genetic variation.

Limitations of the present study include a relatively modest sample size; however, our 
sample size is comparable to other recent studies that examined first episode schizophrenia 
patients at two time points21, or utilize functional connectivity15, 41,42. Larger sample sizes 
would be useful to examine differential effects of various antipsychotic agents. Additionally, 
we examined a select group of psychotic patients and are unable to extend our results to 
other groups of patients experiencing psychosis. Future studies are required to examine 
striatal connectivity in illnesses such as bipolar disorder. By examining changes in psychotic 
symptoms, our results focus on state dependent changes in corticostriatal circuitry that are 
reflective of successful treatment rather than the effect of treatment alone. Further studies 
are required to separate trait related abnormalities in circuitry.

Conclusions

The present study provides evidence that efficacy of treatment of psychosis with second-
generation antipsychotic medications is associated on a neurophysiological level with 
alterations in functional corticostriatal circuitry. To the extent that psychosis successfully 
improves, functional connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal, as well as limbic 
regions, are strengthened. These data further characterize the pathophysiology of psychosis 
and provide support for the role of neuroimaging as a potential biomarker for clinical 
response.

Figure 1. Locations of seed regions and their representative connectivity maps
Both left and right seed regions of interest are displayed in green in first column. The 
corresponding positive (red) and negative (blue) functional connectivity maps of each of 
these seeds from the right hemisphere in the healthy comparison group at baseline are 
displayed in subsequent columns. Maps are shown with threshold of p <0.001, uncorrected, 
for the purpose of visualization. DC: caudate, VSS: ventral caudate, VSI: ventral caudate/
nucleus accumbens, DRP: dorsal rostral putamen, DCP: dorsal caudal putamen, and VRP: 
ventral rostral putamen.
