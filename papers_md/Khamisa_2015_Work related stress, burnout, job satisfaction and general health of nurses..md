Abstract: Gaps in research focusing on work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and 
general health of nurses is evident within developing contexts like South Africa. This study 
identified the relationship between work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general 
health of nurses. A total of 1200 nurses from four hospitals were invited to participate in this 
cross-sectional study (75% response rate). Participants completed five questionnaires and 
multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine significant relationships between 
variables.  Staff  issues  are  best  associated  with  burnout  as  well  as  job  satisfaction.  
Burnout  explained  the  highest  amount  of  variance  in  mental  health  of  nurses.  These  are 
known to compromise productivity and performance, as well as affect the quality of patient 
care.  Issues,  such  as  security  risks  in  the  workplace,  affect  job  satisfaction  and  health  of

nurses. Although this is more salient to developing contexts it is important in developing 
strategies and intervention programs towards improving nurse and patient related outcomes. 

Keywords: burnout; general health; job satisfaction; nurses; work related stress 

1. Introduction 

Described as a state of physical and emotional depletion, burnout is a result of prolonged exposure to 
stressful working environments [1]. As such, burnout among nurses in particular has been reported to be 
higher than other health professionals owing to the nature of their work [2]. Nursing requires the delivery 
of humane, empathetic, culturally sensitive, proficient and moral care, in working environments with 
limited resources and increasing responsibilities. Such imbalance between providing high quality care 
and coping with stressful working environments can lead to burnout [3]. 

Work related stress is associated with burnout, job satisfaction and physical as well as mental health 
outcomes [3–5]. Stressors contributing to the experience of work related stress, including poor supervision, 
conflict with peers and patients, high job demands [6,7] and overtime [8] are all associated with one or 
more dimensions of burnout. The Maslach Burnout Model [9,10] postulates that prolonged exposure to 
environmental  and  situational  stressors  resulting  in  work  related  stress,  contributes  to  emotional 
exhaustion,  depersonalization  and  a  lack  of  personal  accomplishment.  Similarly,  work  related  stress 
resulting from stressors, such as higher workloads, as well as staff issues, including lack of resources, 
has been found to be associated with poor job satisfaction [11,12]. Spector attributes this to a mismatch 
between job expectations and actual working environments, which contributes to higher levels of work 
related stress and lower levels of job satisfaction [13]. Research confirms higher levels of job satisfaction 
within less stressful working environments [5]. Stressors such as poor patient outcomes, conflict with 
peers, high workload and job demands as well as poor supervision and lack of support are all associated 
with poor physical and mental health outcomes [14–16]. Cannon’s stress theory [17,18] explains this 
response  as  an  imbalance  in  homeostasis,  whereby  prolonged  exposure  to  stressors  results  in  a 
breakdown of the biological system. This breakdown prevents compensatory and anticipatory changes 
that  aid  in  coping,  thereby  resulting  in  poor  health  outcomes  such  as  headaches,  insomnia,  social 
dysfunction and depression [4,19,20]. 

Important to note is that burnout and job satisfaction have also been found to be associated with each 
other as well as poor health outcomes. Although not studied extensively in relation to work related stress, 
existing research shows a negative relationship between burnout and job satisfaction [3]. According to 
the  conservation  of  resources  theory  [21,22],  burnout  directly  affects  health  outcomes  through  the 
depletion of resources necessary for coping, thereby leading to negative states of being characterized by 
exhaustion, fatigue, somatization and social withdrawal [23]. 

With grave impact on work productivity, patient care, staff attrition and turnover rates [24], a better 
understanding of existing relationships between work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general 
health of nurses is required. This is especially important in developing contexts, with majority of research 
exploring these relationships being conducted in developed contexts [25–27]. Moreover, as a consequence 
of uniquely stressful work environments, burnout among South African nurses is reported to be higher

654 

than nurses working in other countries [24,28,29]. Researchers have compared the degree of emotional 
exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment among South African nurses with nurses from 
eight different countries (USA, Canada, UK, Germany, New Zealand, Japan, Russia and Armenia) [30,31]. 
Average burnout scores on each subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory showed a higher degree of 
emotional exhaustion (27.0) and depersonalization (11.1) with lower levels of personal accomplishment 
(21.9) among South African nurses [30]. This study aimed at identifying relationships between work 
related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general health among nurses. 

2. Experimental Section 

2.1. Participants 

Of  a  total  of  1200  nurses  who  were  invited,  895  nurses  participated  (response  rate  =  75%).  
Overall,  majority  of  participants  were  black  (46%)  females  (85%),  from  private  hospitals  (59%).  
A total of 28% were above the age of 50, 72% had a diploma/certificate and 27% had more than 25 years 
work experience. The majority of the participants worked between 4 to 6 days and 31 to 40 h per week. 
The demographic data obtained suggests that nurses working in private hospitals were 51 years and older 
(51%), white (84%), females (68%), with postgraduate degrees (62%) and more years of experience (62%). 

2.2. Procedure 

This study was conducted in the year 2013. All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion 
before they participated in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Human Sciences Research Council 
(HSRC)  (REC  3/20/03/12).  Following  ethics  approval  from  the  Human  Sciences  Research  Council 
(HSRC) as well as permission from the Gauteng Department of Health (South Africa), four hospitals 
across the province were selected using stratified random sampling. All private and public hospitals in 
Gauteng province were stratified by area and size after which two private and two public hospitals were 
randomly chosen. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from hospital and nurse managers at 
each of the chosen hospitals. 

For this study, unit managers were requested to distribute invitation packs containing an explanatory 
statement, consent form, five questionnaires and a sealable envelope. Invitation packs were distributed 
randomly by unit managers to a total of 300 nurses per hospital. 

Participants were given 3 weeks to complete the questionnaires. Reminders were issued verbally and 
in  the  form  of  posters  placed  on  notice  boards  two  weeks  after  initial  questionnaire  distribution. 
Participants  were  requested  to  return  the  completed  questionnaires  together  with  signed  informed 
consent forms in sealable envelopes provided to them. The sealed envelopes were to be placed in sealed 
boxes situated around the hospital. These were only accessible to the researcher.

2.3. Measurement Tools 

All participants received five questionnaires consisting of a socio-demographic questionnaire (SDQ), 
Inventory—Human  Services  Survey  

Nursing  Stress 
(MBI-HSS), Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) [9,13,32–34]. 
The SDQ consisted of questions pertaining to the age, gender, level of education, level of experience, 

(NSI),  Maslach  Burnout 

Inventory 

population group, and number of days/hours worked per week. 

The NSI was designed to specifically measure the frequency and severity of five specific stressors 
identified  among  South  African  nurses  (patient  care,  staff  issues,  supervision/management  issues, 
overtime and job demands). Containing 78 items, the first 39 statements were rated in terms of perceived 
intensity of the particular stressor on a 9-point scale, ranging from 1 (low) to 9 (high). In the second part 
of the questionnaire, participants rated the remaining 39 statements on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 
(no days) to 9+ (more than 9 days) in terms of the frequency with which they experienced the stressors 
over the previous 6 months. Validity and reliability of the NSI was tested among 1780 professional, 
enrolled and auxiliary nurses from seven of the nine provinces in South Africa. Findings confirmed the 
NSI  as  a  reliable  and  valid  measure  of  stress  among  South  African  nurses  with  Cronbach  alpha 
coefficients ranging between 0.91 and 0.93 [35]. The mean inter-item correlation coefficients were in 
the recommended range (0.15 < r < 0.50) [32]. 

The MBI-HSS was designed to measure burnout among individuals working in the human services 
and health care occupations including nursing. Consisting of 22 items in the form of statements based 
on personal feelings and attitudes, this questionnaire contains three subscales. The emotional exhaustion 
(EE)  subscale  (9  items)  includes  statements  such  as  “I  feel  emotionally  drained  from  my  work”,  the 
depersonalization (DP) subscale (5 items) includes statements such as “I feel I treat some recipients as 
if they were impersonal objects” and the personal accomplishment (PA) subscale includes statements 
such as “I have accomplished many worthwhile things in this job”. This tool is a reliable measure of 
burnout among nurses with Cronbach alpha values of 0.90 for EE, 0.71 for DP and 0.79 for PA [9]. It 
to  be  reliable  among  South  African  nurses  with  Cronbach  alpha  
has  also  been  found 
coefficients  exceeding  0.70  for  all  subscales  (emotional  exhaustion  0.78,  depersonalization  0.74  and 
personal accomplishment 0.75) [29]. 

The JSS measures job satisfaction within organizations in the social sector of employment. Consisting 
of 36 items the questionnaire has nine facets (pay, promotion, supervision, fringe benefits, contingent 
rewards, operating conditions, coworkers, nature of work and communication). Responses are indicated 
in terms of how true the statement is (higher scores indicate “truer” statements) based on a six point 
rating  scale  ranging  from  “disagree  very  much”  (1)  to  “agree  very  much”  (6).  The  JSS  is  a  reliable 
instrument  with  Cronbach  alpha  coefficients  exceeding  0.70  for  all 
the  facets  [13,33].  
The JSS has been found to be reliable among nurses (Cronbach alpha = 0.89) and shows good construct 
validity [36]. This tool has also been found to possess acceptable reliability across cultures (Cronbach 
alpha > 0.90 in 17 countries including South Africa) [37]. 

The GHQ-28 was developed to detect psychiatric illness as well as current psychological states and 
perceived quality of life. Undesirable psychological states can have consequences for physical health. 
This instrument consists of 28 items measured on four sub-scales (somatic symptoms (SS), anxiety and 
insomnia  (AS),  social  dysfunction  (SD)  and  severe  depressive  symptoms  (DS)).  The  SS  subscale 

 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 

656 

includes items, such as “been feeling run down” and “been getting pains in the head”. The AS subscale 
contains items, such as “lost much sleep over worry” and “feeling nervous and strung up all the time”. 
The SD subscale contains items, such as “taking longer on things” and “enjoying normal day to day 
activities”. The DS subscale includes items, such as “feeling worthless” and “feeling that life is hopeless”. 
Responses for positive items are scored from 0 (always) to 3 (never) and negative items are scored from 3 
(always) to 0 (never). A high score indicates poor general health and vice versa. This tool is reliable with 
Cronbach alpha values ranging between 0.69 and 0.90 for all sub-scales [34]. The GHQ has been found to 
be 
and  
valid (pclose fit = 1.00) among South African samples [38] including nurses (Cronbach alpha = 0.84) [39].

2.4. Design and Analysis 

This study cross sectionally measured work related stress, burnout, job satisfaction and general health 
of nurses. Data analysis using IBM-SPSS Statistics Version 20 included descriptive statistical analysis 
to determine frequencies. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine significant associations 
between variables. The stressors contributing to work related stress were entered into models with facets 
of burnout, job satisfaction and general health. Burnout was also entered as an independent variable into 
models with job satisfaction and general health. Job satisfaction was entered as an independent variable 
into a model with general health as the dependent variable. Missing data were handled using listwise 
deletion.  Assumptions  of  normality  and  linearity  were  confirmed  using  histograms  and  partial  plots. 
Independence  of  errors  was  confirmed  using  the  Durbin-Watson  test  (values  between  1  and  3). 
Homoscedasticity was confirmed using *ZRESID (Y-axis) and *ZPRED (X-axis) plots. 

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Results 

3.1.1 Work Related Stress and Burnout 

Multiple  linear  regression  revealed  that  staff  issues  contributing  to  work  related  stress  is  best 
associated  with  each  dimension  of  burnout.  All  models  were  significantly  different  from  zero  
(p < 0.05). Staff issues explain the highest variance in emotional exhaustion (16%), depersonalization 
(13%)  and  personal  accomplishment  (10%)  as  shown  in  Table  1.  This was  after  controlling  for  age, 
gender, population group, education, experience and hospital type (public and private), which explained an 
additional  variance  of  12%  in  emotional  exhaustion,  10%  in  depersonalization  and  1%  in  
personal accomplishment. 

3.1.2. Work Related Stress and Job Satisfaction 

Associations  were  found  between  satisfaction  with  pay  and  patient  care  as  well  as  overtime,  
each  explaining  12%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  promotion  is  best  associated  with  patient  care 
explaining  9%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  supervision  is  best  associated  with  supervision/management 
issues  explaining  15%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  fringe  benefits  is  best  associated  with  patient  care 
explaining  10%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  contingent  rewards  is  best  associated  with  staff  issues

explaining  12%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  operating  conditions  is  best  associated  with  patient  care 
explaining  12%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  coworkers  is  best  associated  with  staff  issues  explaining  
14% variance. Satisfaction with the nature of work is best associated with patient care and staff issues, 
each  explaining  3%  variance.  Satisfaction  with  communication  is  best  associated  with  staff  issues 
explaining 17% variance. All associations are significant (p < 0.05). Of all the factors, the highest amount 
of  variance  in  job  satisfaction  is  explained  by  stress  related  to  staff  issues  after  controlling  for  age, 
gender, population group, education, experience and hospital type (public and private), which explained 
an additional variance of 9% in satisfaction with communication. This is shown in Table 2.

3.1.3. Work Related Stress and General Health 

Multiple linear regression revealed that staff issues are best associated with somatic symptoms, social 
dysfunction  and  severe  depressive  symptoms,  explaining  7%,  11%  and  5%  variance,  respectively. 
Patient care is best associated with anxiety and insomnia explaining 11% variance. All associations are 
significant (p < 0.05). Both patient care and staff issues are best associated with general health after 
controlling  for  age,  gender,  population  group,  education,  experience  and  hospital  type  (public  and 
private), which explained an additional variance of 8% in anxiety/insomnia as well as social dysfunction.

3.1.4. Burnout and Job Satisfaction 

Multiple linear regression revealed that emotional exhaustion and satisfaction with pay are associated 
explaining 7% variance. All three subscales are associated with satisfaction with promotion explaining 
4% variance. Emotional exhaustion as well as personal accomplishment and satisfaction with supervision 
are associated explaining 2% variance. Associations between all three subscales and satisfaction with 
fringe benefits were found explaining 9% variance. Emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment 
are associated with satisfaction with contingent rewards explaining 9% variance. All three subscales are 
associated with satisfaction with operating conditions, coworkers and nature of work explaining 7%, 
10% and 10% variance, respectively. Emotional  exhaustion and satisfaction with communication are 
associated explaining 14% variance. All associations are significant (p < 0.05). Emotional exhaustion is 
best associated with job satisfaction with communication after controlling for age, gender, population 
group,  education,  experience  and  hospital  type  (public  and  private),  which  explained  an  additional 
variance of 5% in satisfaction with communication. This is shown in Table 4.

3.2. Discussion 

This  study  examined  the  relationships  between  work  related  stress,  burnout,  job  satisfaction  and 
general health of nurses. Of the five stressors contributing to work related stress, staff issues was found 
to be most associated with burnout as well as job satisfaction. Burnout explained the highest amount of 
variance in general health of nurses. 

Existing  literature  confirms  that  staff  issues  including  excessive  administration,  stock  control  and 
colleagues not doing their job influences the levels of stress experienced by nurses [32,40]. Staff issues 
have  been  reported  as  one  of  the  most  significant  stressors  among  nurses  [28].  In  one  such  study, 
professional, enrolled and auxiliary nurses reported severe stress due to staff issues [32]. This can be 
explained by the overburdened South African health system where nurses may be unable to meet the 
demands of their job due to poor staff management which may negatively affect morale [41], lack of 
resources which may negatively affect patient care [29] and security issues owing to high levels of crime 
in the country [42]. 

This study found that stress related to staff issues in particular was associated with all three dimensions 
of burnout explaining 16% variance in emotional exhaustion, 13% variance in depersonalization and 10% 
variance in personal accomplishment. In support of these findings, studies conducted in developed contexts 
have  found  staff  issues  such  as  poor  staff  management  and  resource  inadequacy  to  be  associated  with 
emotional  exhaustion,  depersonalization  and  personal  accomplishment  [43].  In  this  study,  poor  staff 
management as well as poor or inadequate equipment explained the highest amount of variance in burnout 
(16%). These issues have been reported in several news articles, including the New York Times [44] and 
News24  [45],  however,  empirical  evidence  for  this  association  has  been  shortcoming,  with  minimal 
impact on nursing policies and practices. 

Stress related to staff issues and job satisfaction with communication were also found to be associated. 
Although research has shown that staff issues such as poor staff management and resource inadequacy 
are  associated  with  job  satisfaction  [43],  the  findings  of  this  study  revealed  that  security  risks  in  the 
workplace also play a role in influencing job satisfaction among nurses. Within the South African context, 
political  violence  is  surpassed  by  high  levels  of  violent  crime.  As  such  feelings  of  insecurity  and  fear 
become predominant. This can be understood from Maslow’s needs hierarchy, whereby in order to satisfy 
higher level needs, lower level needs such as safety must first be satisfied. In the event that an individual’s 
safety and security is in danger, patient care becomes less important [46]. 

Security  risks  in  the  workplace,  has  also  been  found  to  affect  general  health  of  nurses  [47,48].  
The findings of this study show that security risks in the workplace as well as other staff issues including 
poor  staff  management  and  resource  inadequacy  explains  11%  variance  in  social  dysfunction.  This 
means  that  nurses  experiencing  work  related  stress  as  a  result  of  staff  issues  are  more  likely  to  feel 
incapable  of  enjoying  activities  and  engaging  in  healthy  social  behavior.  This  prevents  adaptational 
outcomes, such as psychological wellbeing and good somatic health [49]. Furthermore, stress related to 
patient care is equally important in influencing mental health among nurses (explaining 11% variance). 
This is supported by research showing that poor communication with doctors, negative patient outcomes 
and  mistakes  when  treating  patients  are  all  associated  with  mental  health  problems  [14].  Burnout 
(emotional exhaustion) and job satisfaction (with communication) demonstrate a negative relationship

in this study. Limited research shows that opportunities for communication about stress provoking issues 
provides a buffer for emotional exhaustion, which results when coping resources become depleted [3]. 

Based  on  the  findings  of  this  study,  stress  related  to  staff  issues  is  associated  with  burnout,  
job satisfaction and general health of nurses. The major staff issues identified in this study include poor 
staff  management,  resource  inadequacy  and  security  risks  in  the  work  place.  According  to  Fretwell,  
staff  management  is  important  given  that  the  managers’  decisions  influence  the  working  
environment [50]. Poor staff management therefore diminishes the staff morale, which leads to feelings 
of depersonalization (burnout) as well as job dissatisfaction [51]. Moreover, lack of resources invokes 
feelings of insecurity about obtaining and maintaining resources necessary for meeting job demands, 
thereby triggering stress, which manifests in burnout [40]. Lack of essential resources, such as treatment 
equipment, medication and examination facilities, compromises patient care and negatively affects job 
satisfaction  [5].  In  the  context  of  South  Africa,  security  risks  in  the  workplace  involve  situations  of 
violence and crime, whereby nurses are exposed to dangerous situations on their way to work and while 
at work [52]. This prompts stressful responses, which eventually leads to burnout. As such nurses are 
restricted from working to their full potential, thereby negatively affecting their levels of job satisfaction 
[5] and their health [53]. 

In addition to stress related to staff issues, job satisfaction is also significantly associated with general 
health.  However,  both  variables  explain  a  smaller  amount  of  variance  in  general  health  compared  to 
burnout in this study. Although the association between burnout and poor physical, mental as well as 
social health outcomes has been confirmed in many studies [54–58], this study shows that burnout is 
most strongly associated with anxiety/insomnia. With mental health problems reported among the top 
ten  work  related  consequences,  these  findings  can  be  understood  as  the  depletion  of  mental  energy 
(emotional exhaustion) and mental distancing (depersonalization), thereby compromising nurses’ ability 
to perform tasks and resulting in anxiety/insomnia [48]. 

Stress prevention strategies are both person level as well as organization level. Stress management 
programs involving education and training on coping with stress is a person level strategy that provides 
support for nurses dealing with stress related outcomes. Organization centered approaches address work 
related stressors by reducing or eliminating them through better management of nurses and provision of 
adequate resources [59]. These have been found to be successful in work settings, whereby stress in the 
workplace is not viewed as a weakness but rather a phenomenon that can be managed by creating a 
culture  of  openness  and  understanding  [53].  It  is  recommended  that  an  integrated  stress  prevention 
strategy of both person centered and organizational centered approaches be used to address work related 
stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and poor general health among nurses. This should involve input from 
nurses as well as management in order to ensure collective commitment towards improving nurse and 
patient related outcomes. 

These findings provide some empirical evidence confirming the relationship between work related 
stress,  burnout,  job  satisfaction  and  general  health  of  nurses  in  a  developing  country  context.  
Although issues related to security risks in the workplace may be more salient within the context of a 
developing country like South Africa, these study findings also confirm a number of the findings that 
have  been  previously  identified  from  studies  undertaken  in  more  developed  countries.  Poor  staff 
management and resource inadequacy are associated with burnout, job satisfaction and general health of 
nurses in both developing and developed contexts. It is very important to identify and delineate very 

 
 
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 

662 

clearly  which  factors  are  particularly  salient  and  relevant  to  developing  countries  because  it  is  very 
important to develop strategies and intervention programs, which can either prevent or at least ameliorate 
these.  It  is  also  equally  important  to  recognize  that  the  role  of  work  related  stress,  burnout,  
job  satisfaction  and  general  health of  nurses  on  poor  patient  outcomes,  high  turnover,  low  retention,  
poor  job  performance,  absenteeism  and  increased  healthcare  costs  are  also  evident  within  an 
international context. 

Several studies have shown that intervention strategies such as additional training in identification 
and management of work related stress through assertiveness and relaxation have successfully improved 
job  performance  levels  among  nurses.  Support  groups  as  well  as  process  consultation  with  nurse 
managers  have  also  been  effective  in  solving  problems  across  interdisciplinary  staff  teams  [60].  
The effect of such interventions on staff absenteeism and turnover is not well researched and should be 
explored in the context of South Africa. 

Limitations  include  generalizability  (based  on  one  province)  and  study  design  (cross  sectional). 
However, it is the intention of the authors to use this study as a foundation for further evaluation of the 
same sample at a later stage to determine causality. Given that this study included a sample of nurses 
from one province in South Africa, it would be useful to replicate this study among South African nurses 
across the other provinces to compare findings and improve generalizability. Future research should also 
examine  reverse  relationships  between  the  variables.  Personal  stressors  including  family  problems, 
financial  status  and  difficult  relationships  should  also  be  studied  in  relation  to  work  related  stress, 
burnout, job satisfaction and general health of nurses. Differences between nurses working in public vs. 
private hospitals should be explored in future studies. 

4. Conclusions 

In conclusion, stress related to staff issues (including poor staff management, resource inadequacy 
and  security  risks)  is  most  important  in  determining  burnout  and  job  satisfaction  among  nurses  and 
possibly  other  health  professionals.  Burnout  clearly  impacts  on  the  mental  health  and  wellbeing  of 
nurses, which is most likely compromising productivity, performance and the quality of patient care. 
Further research exploring specific strategies for managing stress and improving job satisfaction may 
reduce  the  impact  of  burnout  on  general  health  of  nurses,  while  also  minimizing  absenteeism  and 
turnover.  This  could  be  achieved  through  evidence  based  policies  aimed  at  creating  better  work 
environments where nurses feel more secure and have adequate resources to successfully perform their 
jobs, hence improving their health outcomes as well as that of their patients. 

Acknowledgments 

The study was conducted using a small grant from Monash South Africa (230059-9999). This study 
would not have been possible without the support from hospital, nurse and unit managers at each chosen 
hospital. We would like to particularly thank the participants of this study without whom this study could
