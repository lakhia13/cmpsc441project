Abstract

Background:Decline in cognitive performance is associated with gait deterioration. Our objectives were: 1) to determine,
from an original study in older community-dwellers without diagnosis of dementia, which gait parameters, among slower
gait speed, higher stride time variability (STV) and Timed Up & Go test (TUG) delta time, were most strongly associated with
lower performance in two cognitive domains (i.e., episodic memory and executive function); and 2) to quantitatively
synthesize, with a systematic review and meta-analysis, the association between gait performance and cognitive decline
(i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia).

Methods:Based on a cross-sectional design, 934 older community-dwellers without dementia (mean6standard deviation,
70.364.9years; 52.1% female) were recruited. A score at 5 on the Short Mini-Mental State Examination defined low episodic
memory performance. Low executive performance was defined by clock-drawing test errors. STV and gait speed were
measured using GAITRite system. TUG delta time was calculated as the difference between the times needed to perform
and to imagine the TUG. Then, a systematic Medline search was conducted in November 2013 using the Medical Subject
Heading terms ‘‘Delirium,’’
‘‘Cognitive disorders’’ combined with ‘‘Gait’’ OR ‘‘Gait disorders,
Neurologic’’ and ‘‘Variability.’’

‘‘Dementia,’’

‘‘Amnestic,’’

Findings:A total of 294 (31.5%) participants presented decline in cognitive performance. Higher STV, higher TUG delta time,
and slower gait speed were associated with decline in episodic memory and executive performances (all P-values ,0.001).
The highest magnitude of association was found for higher STV (effect size = 20.74 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 21.05;2
0.43], among participants combining of decline in episodic memory and in executive performances). Meta-analysis
underscored that higher STV represented a gait biomarker in patients with MCI (effect size = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.30;0.65]) and
dementia (effect size = 1.06 [95% CI: 0.40;1.72]).

Conclusion: Higher STV appears to be a motor phenotype of cognitive decline.

Introduction

There is growing evidence that decline in cognitive performance
results in gait deterioration [1–3]. Commonly described in later
stages of dementia, lower gait performance may be also detected
early in the progression of dementia and even before the
prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [1,2,4–9].
there is a motor phenotype of decline in
This suggests that
cognitive performance, which could be used to improve the
prediction of dementia.

Two main gait parameters have been related to the severity of
the decline in cognitive performance (i.e., from cognitively healthy
individuals [CHI] to patients with dementia): gait speed and stride-

to-stride variability of stride time (STV) [1,2,4,10,11]. Slower gait
speed is observed among people with dementia compared to those
without dementia, and it may predict the onset of dementia
[4,10,11]. Verghese et al.
recently described the ‘‘Motoric
Cognitive Risk (MCR)’’ syndrome, which combines a cognitive
complaint and a slow gait speed [4]. The authors showed in a large
sample of healthy older community-dwellers that this syndrome
identified the individuals at high risk of dementia - especially
vascular dementia [4]. The second gait parameter that is likely
related to cognition is higher gait variability, and in particular
STV, which is a measure of
lower-limb
movements, is also likely related to cognition [2,12]. For instance,

higher STV has been associated with diminished executive
function among CHI, and higher STV appears to be indicative
of patients with MCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [5–
7,13,14].

In parallel to the quantitative measure of gait parameters, motor
imagery, which is defined as mentally simulating a given action
without actual execution, is an accurate reflection of the higher-
level control of gait [15–17]. For instance, using the Timed Up &
Go test
it has been observed that older adults with
cognitive decline imagined the TUG much faster than they
actually performed it, as illustrated by an increased TUG delta
time (i.e., the time difference between performing and imagining
the TUG) [17,18].

(TUG),

These three gait biomarkers (slower gait speed, higher STV,
and impaired motor imagery of gait) are common in the course of
cognitive decline. It is still unknown which gait biomarker is
associated with which cognitive domain. As gait variability has
been previously associated with cortical metabolic functioning in
patients with MCI [19], we hypothesized that higher STV could
serve as a gait biomarker of decline in cognitive performance
the diagnosis of dementia. Our
among individuals without
objectives were: 1) to determine, from an original study in older
community-dwellers without the diagnosis of dementia, which gait
parameter, among slower gait speed, higher STV, and TUG delta
time, were most strongly associated to lower performance in two
cognitive domains (i.e., episodic memory and executive function);
and 2) to quantitatively synthesize, using a systematic review and
meta-analysis,
the association between gait performance and
cognitive decline (i.e., MCI and dementia).

Methods

Original study

Population and study design. Between January 2008 and
April 2012, 4192 community-dwellers were recruited in the
French Health Examination Center (HEC) in Lyon, France. From
the 4192 participants, 934 (22.3%) individuals without dementia
performed a quantitative gait assessment using the GaitRite system
and were included in this study using a cross-sectional design.
Participants were excluded if they had a history of dementia, used
anti-dementia drugs or had a score #4 on the Short version of the
Mini-Mental State examination (SMMSE)
[20]. The other
exclusion criteria were institutionalization, inability to understand
and speak French, acute medical illness during the past month,
including
missing clinical examination, neurological diseases
Parkinson’s disease, cerebellar disease, myelopathy, peripheral
neuropathy, and major orthopaedic diagnoses (e.g., osteoarthritis)
involving the lumber vertebra, pelvis or lower extremities, inability
to walk 6 meters unassisted and being younger than 65 years of
age.

Clinical Assessment. Baseline assessments included a full
medical examination along with collecting age, gender, and
measures of height and weight. Body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2)
was calculated based on anthropometry measurements (i.e., weight
in kilograms and height in meters). The number of drugs taken
daily and the use of psychoactive drugs including benzodiazepines,
antidepressants, or neuroleptics, were also recorded. Lower limb
proprioception was evaluated with a graduated tuning fork placed
on the tibial tuberosity [21]. The mean value obtained for the left
and right sides was used in the present data analysis. Distance
binocular vision was measured at 5 m with a standard Monoyer
letter chart [22]. Vision was assessed with corrective lenses on if
needed. Depression was evaluated with the use of the 4-item
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score [23]. A score $1 indicated

the presence of depressive symptoms. Episodic memory was
assessed using the short version of SMMSE with scores ranged
from 0 (i.e., worst performance) to 6 (i.e., best performance) [20].
A SMMSE score of 5 was used to designate decline in episodic
memory performance. Executive function was assessed using the
clock-drawing test, and low executive performance was considered
if one or more errors were made in the execution of drawing the
face of the clock and/or the hands of the clock [24]. STV and gait
speed were measured at steady state walking using GAITRite-
system (GAITRite Gold, CIR Systems, PA, USA) in a 6-meter
corridor. The GAITRite-System is an electronic walkway-
of
integrated
5.660.89 m that is connected to a personal portable computer
via an interface cable. Participants walked one trial at their usual
self-selected walking speed in a quiet, well-lit environment wearing
their own footwear according to European guidelines for spatio-
temporal gait analysis in older adults [25]. Before the assessment in
HEC, all participants were contacted by mail and informed not to
wear high-heel shoes. Coefficient of variation (CoV = (standard
deviation/mean) 6 100) of stride time and mean value of gait
speed were used as outcomes. Furthermore, participants were
asked to perform the TUG at their self-selected normal speed in a
well-lit environment. They all completed one trial for the TUG
and then followed by the imagery of TUG: performing the TUG,
then imagining the TUG while sitting in a chair. The times for
each condition were recorded with a stopwatch to the nearest 0.01
second. Before testing, a trained evaluator gave standardized
verbal instructions regarding the test procedure. Participants were
seated, allowed to use the armrests to stand up and instructed to
walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit
down. The stopwatch was started on the command ‘‘ready-set-go’’
and stopped as the subject sat down. For the imagined condition,
participants sat
in the chair and were instructed to imagine
performing the TUG (iTUG) and to say ‘‘stop’’ out loud when
they were finished. Participants could choose to do the iTUG with
their eyes opened or closed, and they were not instructed on the
modality of mental imagery.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Pa-
tient Consents. Participants in the study were included after
having given their written informed consent for research. The
study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards set
forth in the Helsinki Declaration (1983). The entire study protocol
was approved by Lyon Sud-Est III local Ethical Committee,
France.

Statistical analysis. The participants’ characteristics were
summarized using means and standard deviations or frequencies
and percentages, as appropriate. Normality of data distribution
was checked using a skewness-kurtosis test. As the number of
observations was . 40 for each group, no transformations were
interest. For the current analysis,
applied to the variables of
participants were classified into 4 groups, as
follows: CHI,
individuals with low episodic memory performance, individuals
with low executive performance, and individuals with both low
episodic memory and executive performance. First, between-
group comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni corrections or Chi-square test,
as appropriate. Second, univariate and multiple logistic regression
analyses were performed to examine the association between each
cognitive impairment (i.e., memory, or executive, or memory plus
executive) (dependent variables) and each gait parameter (i.e., gait
speed, STV and TUG delta time) (independent variables) adjusted
on participants’ characteristics (i.e., age, gender, number of drugs
used per day, use of psychoactive drugs, depression symptoms,
lower-limb proprioception, distance vision score, and
BMI,

difference between gait parameters (i.e., gait speed, STV, and
delta TUG) in participants with low cognitive performance and
those without
(Review Manager version 5.1, The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). P-values less than
0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All statistics were
performed using SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

Systematic Literature search and meta-analysis

Literature search. An English and French systematic
Medline search limited to humans was conducted in November
2013 using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms ‘‘Delir-
ium’’, ‘‘Dementia’’, ‘‘Amnestic’’, ‘‘Cognitive disorders’’ combined
with ‘‘Gait’’ OR ‘‘Gait disorders, Neurologic’’ and ‘‘Variability’’.
An iterative process was used to ensure all relevant articles were
obtained. A further hand search of bibliographic references of
considered papers and existing reviews was also conducted to
identify potential studies not captured in the electronic database
searches.

Study selection. One member of the team (Olivier Beauchet)
screened abstracts from the initial search and obtained records
deemed potentially relevant. Initial screening criteria for the
abstracts were: 1) observation studies (case report, case series,
cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies were included), 2)
intervention studies, 3) data collection of gait and cognition, 4) two
groups of participants including cognitively healthy individuals
and individuals with MCI or dementia, and 5) articles in English
and French. If a study met the initial selection criteria or its
eligibility could not be determined from the title and abstract (or
abstract not provided), the full text was retrieved. Two reviewers
then independently
(Olivier Beauchet and Ce´dric Annweiler)
assessed the full text for inclusion status. Disagreements were
resolved by a third reviewer (Gilles Allali). The full articles were
screened using the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational
studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist, which describes
items that should be included in reports of cohort studies [26] and
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
statement
trials [27]. Final selection criteria were
therefore applied when STV (i.e., the gait parameter identified as
the most strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in
the original study) and cognitive performance were measured. The
study selection is shown in a flow diagram (Figure 1).

for clinical

Qualitative analysis. Of

the 68 originally identified ab-
stracts, 46 (67.7%) studies were not retained because 25 studies
focused on motor neurological diseases (i.e., Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s disease or idiopathic normal pressure hydrocepha-
lus); there was no CHI as control group in 11 studies; there was no
participants with cognitive decline in 2 studies; spatio-temporal
gait parameters were not outcomes in 2 studies; 4 studies were not
original studies; and 2 studies were written in a language other
than English or French. Thorough examination of the 22 studies
that met the initial
inclusion criteria, 14 studies (63.6%) were
excluded because STV was not an outcome. The remaining 8
studies were included in the systematic review [5,7,28–33].

Meta-analysis. All studies addressing CoV of stride time in
CHI and in individuals with cognitive decline were meta-analyzed.
We distinguished groups with MCI and with dementia, as these
are two distinct clinical entities that differ, among others, on the
functionality. When applicable, we also distinguished
level of
participants with amnestic MCI and participants with non-
amnestic MCI [33], as well as demented patients with executive
dysfunction and demented patients without executive dysfunction
[32]. All results were expressed in terms of a bias corrected ‘‘effect
size’’ of the difference between gait parameters in cases with MCI

or dementia and cognitively healthy controls. An effect size
calculator worksheet was used to derive effect sizes from mean,
standard deviation, and size of each group (Coe’s Calculator
retrieved November 25, 2013 from http://www.cemcentre.org/
evidence-based-education/effect-size-calculator). Qualitative de-
scriptors of the obtained effect sizes were: less than 0.3, small;
0.4 to 0.8, moderate, and greater than 0.8, large [34]. Fixed and
random effects meta-analyses were performed on the estimates to
generate summary values (Review Manager version 5.1, The
Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Results are
presented as a forest plot. Heterogeneity between studies was
assessed using Cochran’s Chi-squared test for homogeneity (Chi2),
and amount of variation due to heterogeneity was estimated by
calculating the I2 [35].

Findings

A total of 294 (31.5%) participants presented decline in
cognitive performance. One hundred fourteen (12.2%) had low
episodic memory performance, 136 (14.6%) had low executive
performance and 44 (4.7%) had low performance in these two
cognitive domains. Participants with low cognitive performance
were older than those with normal cognitive performance (P,
0.03) (Table 1). Participants with low executive performance took
more drugs and had a higher BMI than those with normal
cognitive performance (P = 0.011 and P = 0.005). Those with low
episodic memory performance used more frequently psychoactive
drugs compared to those with normal cognitive performance (P,
0.001). Participants with low performance either in executive
function or
in executive function plus memory had more
frequently depressive symptoms (P = 0.035 and P = 0.002), and
had also a lower distance vision (P,0.001 and P = 0.0024), lower
handgrip strength (P = 0.024 and P = 0.033), lower gait speed (P,
0.001) but a higher TUG delta time (P,0.001 and P = 0.016)
compared to CHI. In addition, participants combining low
performance in episodic memory and executive function had
specifically more frequently worse lower-limb proprioception
than CHI. Compared to participants with low
(P = 0.020)
performance in executive function,
those with low memory
performance had a higher distance vision score (P = 0.024) and
lower TUG delta time (P,0.001). Participants with a low episodic
memory performance had a higher distance vision score compared
to those combining low performances in episodic memory and
executive function (P,0.001). In final, STV was higher in
participants with a low cognitive performance, whatever the
cognitive domain, compared to those with a normal cognitive

performance (effect size = 20.74 [95% CI: 21.05;20.43]);
whereas, the highest effect size was reported for TUG delta time
among participants with lower executive performance compared
to the other participants (effect size = 20.50 [95% CI: 20.70;2
0.30]).

The meta-analysis was performed on 8 studies with a total of
365 cases (i.e., 227 patients with MCI and 138 patients with
dementia) and 893 controls (i.e., CHI) (Figure 3). For patients with
MCI,
the summary random effect size was 0.48 [95% CI:
0.30;0.65] indicating that STV was overall 0.48 SD higher (i.e.
worse) in patients with MCI compared to CHI (Figure 2 A). This
represents a moderate association of increased STV with MCI
[34]. Using the ‘Common Language Effect Size’ approach of
McGraw and Wong, the probability is about 48% that a patient

with MCI would have higher gait variability than a CHI if both
individuals were chosen at random from a population [27]. For
patients with dementia, the summary random effect size was 1.06
[95% CI: 0.40;1.72], underscoring a large association with
increased STV. In final, when considering pooled populations
with cognitive decline (i.e., patients with MCI or dementia), the
summary random effect size was 0.80 [95% CI: 0.48;1.13]
highlighting a moderate association in total.

Discussion

The results of this study of older community-dwellers without a
diagnosis of dementia showed that higher STV was associated with
a lower cognitive performance in episodic memory and executive

Gait and Cognitive Decline

Figure 2. Effect size of the association of gait speed, stride time variability, and delta time of Timed up & Go with lower cognitive
performance in memory and executive domains (n = 934). TUG: Timed up & Go; delta time of Timed up & Go calculated from the formula:
(Timed up & Go realized – Timed up & Go imagined/((Timed up & Go realized – Timed up & Go imagined)/2) 6100.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0099318.g002

function. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed this result by
underscoring that higher STV was related to both MCI and
dementia. Thus, higher STV appears as the motor phenotype of
cognitive decline before and during the course of dementia.

Our findings corroborate that declining gait performances are
strongly related to cognitive impairments. Most of the previous
studies focused on gait changes in demented patients, and these
studies showed that these gait changes are common in the later
stages of dementia, with a prevalence reaching 90%, and
correspond to various gait changes such as cautious gait or slower
gait with a higher fall risk [13,36–41]. Demented older adults
exhibit greater gait impairments than those impairments expected
as a result of the normal aging process [41,42]. More recently, it
has been reported that gait changes may be detected early in the
course of dementia, including at the prodromal stage of MCI,
which is a transitional
state between normal cognition and
dementia [5,6,14,41,43]. In particular, higher STV has been
results
observed among individuals with MCI
contribute new information by showing that STV is also strongly
related to the level of cognitive performance in individuals without
dementia. Indeed, the lower cognitive performance they had, the
higher STV we observed. Few studies had shown similar results,
but the association between specific cognitive domains and gait
parameters was divergent. For instance, it has been found that a
lower performance on global executive function was associated
with slower gait speed [8,9,44]. And more recently, it has been
reported in older cognitively healthy community-dwellers that

[5,6]. Our

higher STV was associated with impairments in information
updating and monitoring, which is a subdomain of the executive
functions [7]. The fact that we did not find, in the present study,
such an association between higher STV and executive dysfunc-
tion is probably related to the test used to evaluate executive
function. Although less accurate than more comprehensive battery
tests, the Clock Drawing Test is more feasible and widely used in
clinical practice to address executive functions [45,46].

Higher STV appeared as a gait change strongly related to
decline in cognitive performance in both our original study and
the meta-analysis. The reason for the attractiveness of this measure
is based on the fact that STV reflects one of the final pathways of
the outcomes regulated by the central nervous system. The general
assumption is that there is an inverse association between stride
time variability and gait stability [1–6]. Lower STV reflects
automatic processes that require minimal cortical input, and lower
STV is associated with efficient and safe gait patterns [6]. Walking
is one of the most repetitive and ‘‘hard wired’’ human movements;
the normal fluctuations in STV are usually below 3% among
healthy adults [1,2,6,9]. Thus, STV appears as a good biomarker
of higher levels of gait control and, therefore, highlights the fact
that gait should not be considered as a simple automatic motor
behavior but a rather complex and higher level of cognitive
functioning. Understanding the mechanisms of cognitive decline-
related increase in STV seems of particular importance. It is likely
that they depend in part on lesions in the basal ganglia, as
observed in more severe stages of dementia [36–40]. However,

Gait and Cognitive Decline

since it has been reported that an increase in STV is a surrogate
marker of motor power and propulsion abilities among individuals
with MCI [1,2,5–7], it is likely that the involvement of the brain
exceeds the subcortical level, and also relates to cortical cognitive
dysfunction with subsequent cortical misprocessing of sensorimo-
tor information resulting in higher STV [2,3,7]. Because we
showed that higher STV was associated specifically with lowest
episodic memory performance in our study, we thus suggest that
higher STV in non-demented individuals may reflect primarily a
dysfunction of cortical sensorimotor control involving the hippo-
campus. This reasoning is in concordance with the association
between higher gait variability and hippocampus dysfunction
previously reported [1,2,14,47,48]. For instance, the approach of
gait in terms of brain metabolism by Zimmerman et al. showed
that higher stride length variability was associated with lower levels
of hippocampal metabolism [14]. Animal models have also shown
that hippocampus lesions generated memory disorders as well as
limb coordination impairments evaluated by STV [49].
In
functional MRI studies, a greater extent of hippocampal activation
and a trend toward increased entorhinal cortex activation have
been found in MCI patients compared to controls while
performing an episodic memory task of encoding, whereas AD
patients showed a lower degree of activation in these same regions
[50]. In a recent fMRI study comparing mental imagery of gait
between healthy older and younger adults, the elderly showed a
greater activation in the left hippocampus than the young subjects
for a task assessing the precise control of gait [51]. Thus, in line
with the hypothesis of a compensatory hippocampal activity in
cognitively healthy individuals and those with MCI, the associa-
tion between higher STV and low memory performance could
reflect a pathological compensatory mechanism related to
hippocampal dysfunction in prodromal AD.

time [10,42] and,

Slower gait speed was only reported among participants with
cumulative memory and executive impairments. The result is
consistent with previous studies showing that gait speed decreases
in AD and follows the severity of the disease [2,10,42]. This
change in gait speed has been related to a decrease in stride length
and an increase in support
thus, provides
complementary information compared to STV. Indeed, compared
to STV, which seems to be strongly related to highest levels of gait
control, gait speed is a global biomarker of gait disturbance related
to the central but also the peripheral disturbance of neuromuscular
system [52]. Indeed, gait speed is a simple, objective, performance-
based measure of lower limb neuromuscular function, which not
subtle impairments and preclinical
only allows detection of
diseases, but is also a sensitive marker of functional capacity in
older adults [53–55].

Our study also showed that TUG delta time was only related to
results have been previously
executive dysfunction. Similar
[15], but also in patients with
reported in older adults
schizophrenia [16] and multiple sclerosis [56]. Indeed, global
cognitive decline has been related to an important time difference
between TUG and iTUG. This result underscore that gait should
no longer be considered as a simple automatic motor activity
independent from cognition. The exact localization of cortical gait
control disorders remains uncertain. Recently, Wang et al.
reported using fMRI that gait-activated motor-related areas of
included the supplementary motor area, bilateral
the brain,
left dorsal premotor cortex, and cingulated
precentral gyrus,
motor area [57]. Different brain areas such as the prefrontal
cortex, and in particular the Brodmann area 6 and the posterior
supplementary motor cortex, seem to be predominantly implicated
in Motor Imagery [58,59]. One can postulate that our participant
presenting the lowest cognitive performance might also have

deficits in those regions, which may disturb their motor imagery
ability. The latter point could explain the positive association
between lowest cognitive performance and delta time reported in
our study.

Some limitations need to be noted in our original study. First,
the cross-sectional design may be problematic when exploring an
association between gait and cognitive performance compared to a
prospective cohort study design. The causality and direction in the
association of changes in gait with cognitive decline should be
carefully interpreted. Thus, our findings should be replicated in a
longitudinal cohort study with MCI and/or dementia occurrence
information collected prospectively. Second,
an abnormal
SMMSE score as well as an abnormal clock drawing test could
be not sufficient to diagnose satisfactorily memory and executive
declines. These both tests are usually used as screening tests rather
than diagnostic tests in a general population. A diagnosis of
cognitive decline in these two sub-domains usually requires a
multidisciplinary meeting involving geriatricians, neurologists and
neuropsychologists during which the results of neuropsychological
assessment, medical examination, blood tests and brain imaging
are discussed. Third, it is possible that some participants recruited
in this study were MCI and/or mildly demented participants.
Indeed, prevalence estimates of MCI have ranged between 10.7%
and 14.5% among samples in previous European studies [60–62].
The prevalence estimate in the current study is, at most, three
times
the previous reports and may represent a
methodological difference between studies in identifying people
with dementia. The evaluation process in the current study also

larger as

did not specifically seek to identify individuals who would meet the
diagnostic criteria for MCI. Fourth, although we were able to
control for many characteristics likely to modify the association
between gait and cognitive performance,
residual potential
confounders might still be present in our study. Fifth, potential
limitations of our meta-analysis should be also considered. It was
performed on a relatively small number of studies (n = 8), which
underscores i) that research on cognitive-related changes in STV is
still limited at this time, and ii) a potential publication bias. In
addition, while a meta-analysis of effect sizes is equivalent to a
meta-analysis of odds ratios -albeit with loss of power- when there
is an underlying normal distribution and common variance [63],
this assumption may be not entirely correct in the populations
selected in our review due to the relatively small sample sizes.
Finally, the determined summary effect size should be interpreted
with caution due to the substantial heterogeneity, at least for the
analysis of patients with dementia. However, the use of a random-
effects meta-analysis model controlled this limitation and com-
pensated for the different effect distributions across the different
studies [64].

In contrast, our study has a number of strengths. First, it is the
largest population based study in older adults that examined the
association of gait performance with cognitive performance.
Second, compared to previous published studies,
the major
potential confounders (i.e., age, gender, number of drugs used
per day, use of psychoactive drugs, depression symptoms, body
mass index, lower-limb proprioception, distance vision score and
handgrip strength) in our study were taken into account. Third, all

gait assessment with the GAITRite system, which is a validated
portable gait analysis system that allows simple objective gait
measurements. The results of this study should be generalizable to
community-dwelling older adults, which improves the knowledge
translation potential of the study results.

Our results underscore a specific association between increased
STV and cognitive decline from non-demented to demented
patients. This result leads to new perspectives in the diagnosis of
early stages of dementia such as MCI. Indeed, the diagnosis of
MCI is based on a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment
exploring various cognitive domains including episodic memory
and executive function, but also on blood tests and brain imaging
[20]. This diagnosis process is time-consuming and expensive. In
addition,
to conclude that an
individual has MCI. As interventions appear to be more effective
in the early stages of the disease, improving the early diagnosis of
dementia at
the prodromal stage of MCI is challenging for
clinicians. Recently, the use of biomarkers has been proposed to
facilitate the early diagnosis of dementia [65]. Biomarkers are
defined as indicators of a disease process, and their complemen-
tary use to classical neuropsychological tools is essential to this aim
[65]. For example, specific proteins in the cerebrospinal
fluid
(CSF) (e.g., protein tau) constitute validated biomarkers for AD

there are no gold standards

Gait and Cognitive Decline

[65]. However, the main limitation of CSF biomarkers is the
compulsory invasive examination (i.e., CSF tapping). Compared to
these biomarkers, spatio-temporal gait parameters reflecting motor
disorders of early-stage dementia could represent non-invasive
easily accessible biomarkers to improve the prediction of dementia,
and especially in AD [1,2].

In conclusion, higher STV was the gait parameter with the
highest magnitude of association with cognitive decline in both
individuals with and without dementia. This finding could be
applied as potential biomarker of cognitive decline, which will be
useful for the early diagnosis of dementia.
