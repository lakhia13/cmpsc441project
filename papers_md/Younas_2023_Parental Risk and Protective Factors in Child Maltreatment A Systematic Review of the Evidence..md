Abstract
This study systematically reviews and synthesizes evidence on parental risk and protective factors along with identifying 
differences in the presence of these factors based on maltreatment type. In all, 68 quantitative, published, empirical studies 
were included from electronic databases for the systematic review. Quality appraisal did not exclude any studies and data 
were extracted from all. Results were narratively synthesized using the Risk and Resilience Ecological framework. The 
findings revealed more risk factors on the micro (individual and family) ecological level compared to mezzo and macro 
levels. At the micro level, findings mirror results of prior systematic reviews such as parental substance abuse, history of 
childhood maltreatment, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Social support was the most significant protective factor 
across all ecological levels and across all maltreatment types except child sexual abuse but differed in definition widely 
across studies. Physical abuse had the most risk factors unique to this type followed by neglect, and IPV was a common 
risk factor across all maltreatment types. Fewer studies on emotional abuse, sexual abuse, and protective factors were 
identified. The findings of this review delineated key parental risk and protective factors at various ecological levels along 
with  associations  between  distinct  factors  and  types  of  maltreatment.  Interventions  working  with  parents  to  reduce 
child maltreatment risk can use these findings to guide development of targeted programs for families based on risk and 
maltreatment  type.  For  researchers,  the  findings  can  guide  further  investigation  in  under-researched  areas  of  parental 
sexual and emotional abuse and protective factors.

Child maltreatment is defined as any act of commission or 
omission by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custo-
dial role which results in actual harm, potential of harm, or 
threat  of  harm  to  a  child  (CDC,  2014).  Despite  extensive 
research  on  its  detrimental  consequences  (Gilbert  et  al., 
2009),  the  problem  of  child  maltreatment  persists.  This  is 
partly due to heterogeneity of research findings which makes 
it difficult for decision-makers to reach effective conclusions 
to help those at risk of child maltreatment. The COVID-19 
pandemic has further escalated the risk of harm to children 
through lockdown measures fostering social isolation, high 
levels  of  economic  instability,  and  a  rise  in  parents’  stress 
particularly  for  vulnerable  families  (Lawson  et  al.,  2020; 
Pereda & Diaz-Faes, 2020). While not directly relevant, the 
pandemic  further  highlights  the  urgency  to  reduce  risk  of 
child maltreatment. To gain insight regarding buffering risk 
and  protecting  children  from  harm,  this  systematic  review 
synthesizes  evidence  on  four  maltreatment  types  including 
physical,  sexual,  emotional  (or  psychological)  abuse,  and 
neglect  which  is  perpetrated  by  one  or  both  biological 
parent(s).  Another  type  of  child  maltreatment,  witnessing 
intimate  partner  violence  (IPV),  while  important  is  not 

included  in  this  review  and  instead  is  focused  upon  as  a 
parental risk factor rather than a maltreatment type.

While  there  has  been  an  upsurge  in  research  on  risk  and 
protective factors for child maltreatment, immense variability 
in  the  research  (including  samples,  methods,  measures,  and 
outcomes) makes it challenging to reach concrete conclusions 
and apply the best available data to real-world child maltreat-
ment  prevention  methods.  Some  systematic  reviews  have 
focused on only one or a selection of risk factors, a specific 
period, or a specific population (e.g., adolescent mothers). A 
systematic review of protective factors for mothers at risk of 
inter-generational child maltreatment, for example, found that 
mothers’  internal  capacities  (e.g.,  self-esteem)  and  external 
resources (e.g., social support) have a buffering effect on risk 
of  intergenerational  child  maltreatment  (Atzl  et  al.,  2019).

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 24(5)

However, this review focused entirely on the prenatal period 
and only looked at maternal history of child abuse as a risk 
factor and did not consider any other risk factors. Another sys-
tematic  review  (Timshel  et  al.,  2017)  of  risk  and  protective 
factors for family violence among refugee families found that 
parental substance abuse, mental illness, and a parental history 
of childhood maltreatment played a vital role in increasing risk 
of child abuse and neglect. However, this study looked at all 
violence (e.g., domestic violence) rather than only child mal-
treatment, among a subset of the population (refugees), hence 
bringing into question generalizability to parents who are at 
risk of, or maltreat their children. While there have been sys-
tematic reviews of risk and protective factors for child mal-
treatment, no review to date and to the authors’ knowledge has 
exclusively focused on parental factors and included all types 
of maltreatment nor addressed specific risk and protective fac-
tors for different types of maltreatment.

With the aim of understanding risk and protective factors 
that  can  guide  prevention  efforts,  more  research  on  parents 
needs  to  be  conducted  and  a  focus  on  maltreatment  type- 
specific factors can provide insight into the risk and protection 
interplay. Using the Risk and Resilience Ecological Framework 
(Fraser et al., 1999), this systematic review focuses on paren-
tal  risk  and  protective  factors.  The  Risk  and  Resilience 
Ecological  Framework  combines  Bronfenbrenner’s  (1979) 
Ecological Model and the Risk and Resilience model (Fraser, 
1997), examining both risk and protective factors at the micro 
(individual  and  family),  mezzo  (community),  and  macro 
(national) levels. This approach acknowledges the complexi-
ties of individual influences and is useful for demarcating risk 
and protection based on empirical evidence.

This systematic review capitalizes on current knowledge 
and  provides  in-depth  insight  into  the  interplay  of  parental 
risk and protective factors, especially how these correspond 
to  different  types  of  maltreatment.  This  can  contribute  to 
identifying and supporting the most vulnerable parents and 
aid  in  the  prevention  and  reduction  of  harm  to  children. 
There are three research questions. First, what parental fac-
tors  increase  the  risk  of  child  maltreatment?  Second,  what 
protective factors can buffer the risk of child maltreatment? 
Third,  does  evidence  show  that  risk  and  protective  factors 
differ based on type of child maltreatment?

Method

A systematic review method was used to review and synthe-
size the vast literature on risk and protective factors in child 
maltreatment.  Inclusion  criteria  for  studies  were  limited  to 
quantitative studies as these can provide hard numerical data 
and  tend  to  employ  a  larger  sample  contributing  to  greater 
applicability  of  findings  (see  Supplemental  Appendix  A). 
Systematic  reviews  and  meta-analysis  were  included  in  the 
search but only to acquire primary studies from the reviews. 
Once  relevant  primary  studies  were  identified  and  obtained, 
the  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  were  excluded. 
Studies dated from 1980 to 2018.

Cochrane Library, PsychInfo, PsychExtra, Scopus, SAGE, 
and Web of Science were the databases searched. As a check-
ing mechanism, the first author conducted manual searches 
on Child Abuse & Neglect journals (Supplemental Appendix 
B).  Figure  1  displays  a  summary  of  the  screening  process 
using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta Analyses (Page et al., 2020) chart. Coding of all 
included  studies  was  undertaken  using  EPPI-Reviewer  4 
software. A data extraction form was devised to obtain rele-
vant study characteristics (See Supplemental Appendix C).

Searches found 1,480 studies from which 106 were dupli-
cates and 1,374 were included for title and abstract screen-
ing.  From  these,  1,011  studies  were  excluded  on  lack  of 
relevance or unavailability. In all, 363 studies were eligible 
for  full-text  screening.  Majority  of  these  were  excluded 
because  the  design  of  the  study  was  not  quantitative,  the 
study  did  not  include  parents  as  perpetrators  of  child  mal-
treatment, did not measure parental outcomes, or the studies 
were not accessible. A final 68 studies were found eligible 
for inclusion.

The  quality  assessment  criteria  for  all  included  studies 
were adapted from The National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence  (NICE)  guidelines  (NICE,  2012)  based  on 
included  study  methods  and  summarized  in  one  quality 
appraisal tool (see Supplemental Appendix D). The Grading 
of  Recommendations,  Assessment,  Development  and 
Evaluations  (GRADE)  approach  was  used  to  rank  studies. 
The GRADE approach was tailored to specific criteria which 
only  applied  to  methods  of  included  studies.  While  this 
approach is primarily used in intervention evaluation studies, 
it is also useful for our systematic review as it addresses risk 
of bias and confounding which are a primary concern in the 
studies included in our review. Included studies were given 
an initial ranking of low and were then moved up to a rank-
ing of moderate or high if there was no risk of bias, outcome 
measures and processes were reliable and data analysis was 
appropriate and valid (Kirmayr et al., 2021). Studies with a 
high or moderate ranking are fit for inclusion as there are no 
serious risks of bias that compromise a study’s quality. Any 
study which remains at the low ranking after consideration of 
quality criteria is eligible for exclusion as the study may have 
a high risk of bias, uninterpretable findings, and/or signifi-
cant errors. A narrative synthesis approach was used to pres-
ent findings on each ecological level and charts were used to 
illustrate significance of associations and prevalence of stud-
ies on various risk factors.

Results

Quality Appraisal

Following  full-text  screening,  68  studies  were  included. 
Quality assessment did not lead to exclusion of any studies.

Overview of Study Characteristics

Of the 68 studies, 53 measured only risk factors, 14 measured 
both risk and protective factors, and one measured only pro-
tective factors. For maltreatment type, 24 studies focused on 
all types of child maltreatment. Five studies focused on child 
neglect,  19  examined  child  physical  abuse,  one  emotional 

abuse, and one child sexual abuse.  The remaining  studies 
included  more  than  one  type  of  maltreatment  with  nine 
focusing  on  neglect  and  physical  abuse  and  three  on 
emotional and physical abuse. Six focused on three types of 
maltreatment; three researched child neglect, physical abuse, 
and sexual abuse and the other three examined child neglect, 
physical abuse, and emotional abuse.

Issues with data analysis

There were two case–control studies, three cohort studies, 
23 cross-sectional studies, two cross-study comparisons, 18 
longitudinal  studies,  and  six  studies  analyzing  secondary 
data. From the 68 included studies, child maltreatment mea-
sures  included  all  child  protective  service  (CPS)  records 
which  was  used  by  16  studies,  substantiated  CPS  reports 
(14), Conflict Tactic Scale (Straus et al., 1979) by six stud-
ies  and  the  Conflict  Tactic  Scale  Parent-Child  (CTSPC; 
Straus  et  al.,  1995)  by  seven  studies.  The  Child  Abuse 
Potential Inventory (Milner & Robertson, 1990) was used 
by 10 studies. The remaining studies used hospital records 
(2),  national  database  (1),  self-reports  (6),  referral  from  a 
child abuse program (1), and Diagnostic Interview Schedule 
(Robins  et  al.,  1981)  was  used  by  one  study.  Five  studies 
used  more  than  one  measure  which  included  CTSPC  and 
CPS reports (1), self-reports and observational measures (1), 
CTSPC  and  Multidimensional  Neglectful  Behavior  Scale 
(Straus, 2006), and a mix of CPS substantiated cases, court 
referrals,  and  self-referrals  was  used  by  one  study  (see 
Supplemental Appendix E).

Data from the studies were only used as it applied to child 
maltreatment  and  parenting  outcomes.  There  were  studies 
which  also  had  child  outcomes  and  these  outcomes  were 
excluded  and  only  parenting  outcomes  considered  when 
describing study characteristics (see Supplemental Appendix 
E).  Only  the  top  three  findings  for  each  ecological  level 
(micro-individual, micro-family, mezzo, and macro) are pre-
sented in detail.

What Parental Factors Increase the Risk of Child 
Maltreatment?

Micro-level individual risk factors.  Figure 2 shows the individual-
level  parental  risk  factors  studied  at  the  micro-individual 
level and identifies the number of studies finding a signifi-
cant association with child maltreatment. In all, 34 studies 
looked at parental mental health as a risk factor and 21 of 
these found a significant association. Anderson et al. (2018) 
measured psychiatric diagnosis of post-traumatic stress dis-
order  (PTSD)  and  borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD) 
among  mothers  with  childhood  abuse  histories  and  found 
significant links to child maltreatment potential. Similarly, 

other studies showed depression as the most frequent men-
tal  health  issue  among  mothers  (e.g.,  Mash  et  al.,  1983; 
Slack et al., 2011).

In all, 25 studies measured childhood history of mal-
treatment among parents with 21 findings showing a signifi-
cant association. From these 21 studies, maternal childhood 
maltreatment was the focus of 14 of the studies while the 
remaining  six  included  both  parents’  history  of  abuse. 
Bartlett and Easterbrooks’ (2015) longitudinal study found 
that  mothers  with  a  history  of  abuse  compared  to  those 
without such a history were 2.5 times more likely to neglect 
their infants (p = .038). Similarly, De Paul and Domenech’ 
(2000) longitudinal study on adolescent mothers found that 
those  with  memories  of  childhood  physical  abuse  had  a 
higher  risk  of  maltreatment  compared  to  mothers  with 
childhood  physical  abuse  but  no  memories  of  that  abuse 
(p = .02). Another study (Thornberry et al., 2013) found that 
parents with a history of maltreatment were 2.6 times more 
likely to maltreat their children when the parents were aged 
between 21 and 30 years (odds ratio: 2.57, confidence inter-
val: 1.47–4.50) than parents without a history.

Substance  abuse  was  measured  by  28  studies  and  18 
found a significant association with child maltreatment. One 
such study (Ricci et al., 2003) identified parental characteris-
tics of children with abusive head trauma, with 53% having 
parents who abused drugs and alcohol. Another study (Fuller 
& Wells, 2003) found that drug and alcohol abuse was related 
to  maltreatment  recurrence  (p = .03).  Cheng  and  Lo  (2015) 
also showed that recurrence of child maltreatment was posi-
tively associated with parents’ alcohol abuse (p < .05).

Micro-level family risk factors.  Figure 3 displays the risk fac-
tors  within  the  micro-family  level  identified  among  the 
included studies, showing the number that have a significant 
association  with  child  maltreatment.  Of  21  studies,  nine 
found  an  association  between  single  parenthood  and  child 
maltreatment.  Dubowitz  et  al.’  (2011)  longitudinal  study 
explored associations of multiple level risk factors to exam-
ine antecedents and outcomes of maltreatment. In total, 224 
parents  were  followed  for  12  years  by  which  time  43% 
(n = 97)  of  families  had  at  least  one  child  protection  report 
and mothers of these children were less likely to be married 
(p = .07). Similarly, one longitudinal study (Fuller & Wells, 
2003) investigated prognostic factors of recurrent child mal-
treatment  among  parents  with  substance  use  disorders 
(n = 95)  and  found  that  single  parent  families  were  more 
likely to repeatedly maltreat (p = .02). Marital dispute or dis-
cord was significantly associated with child maltreatment in 
five  out  of  six  studies.  A  longitudinal  study  (Zhao  et  al., 
2018)  with  a  Chinese  population  of  neglected  children 
(n = 553) found a correlation between child neglect (p = .03) 
and parental marital discord. Correspondingly, Whipple and 
Webster-Stratton’ (1991) study found that physically abusive 
mothers (n = 92) had higher marital distress and less satisfac-
tion with their marital relationship (p = .04).

Figure 2.  Micro-individual risk factors.

In all, 11 studies examined the number of minor children 
at home as a risk factor and seven found a significant asso-
ciation. Wu et al.’ (2004) cohort study of verified maltreat-
ment cases found that having more than two children at home 
was  significantly  associated  with  infant  maltreatment.  One 
study (Wolfner & Gelles, 1993) surveyed 3,232 households 
and found a correlation between number of children (more 
than 4) and physical abuse (p < .01). Schick et al.’s (2015) 
study  also  found  a  correlation  between  physical  abuse  risk 
for adolescent girls which was higher among those with three 
or more siblings at home (p < .05).

Mezzo-level risk factors.  Economic deprivation was the most 
prevalent risk factor associated with child maltreatment at the 
mezzo level. Low household income, low financial resources, 
poverty,  and  welfare  receipt  encompassed  economic 

deprivation  and  were  linked  to  child  maltreatment  in  six 
studies.  Among  a  national  sample  of  Croatian  adolescent 
moms  (n = 746),  Ajdukovic  et  al.’  (2018)  discovered  that 
welfare receipt was associated with a higher propensity for 
child maltreatment. In Cheng and Lo’ (2015) study, a lower 
family  income  (<$2,000  yearly)  was  linked  to  the  risk  of 
child abuse (p < .01).

Two studies found a strong association between parental 
social  isolation  and  child  maltreatment.  In  Corse  et  al. 
(1990), child maltreating mothers (n = 26) were less satisfied 
with available social support (p < .01), had less child-rearing 
help (p < .05), and less peer support (p < .01) than non-mal-
treating mothers. Compared to parents who break the cycle 
of intergenerational child abuse (n = 126), cycle maintainers 
(n = 9) had more feelings of loneliness and perceived isola-
tion (p < .008).

Figure 3.  Micro-family-level risk factors.

Parents’ unemployment and housing instability (Slack et al., 
2017), reduced satisfaction with housing conditions (Ajdukovic 
et al., 2018), and maternal companionship support (Price-Wolf, 
2014) were some of the other mezzo-level risk factors which 
were all significantly associated with child maltreatment.

Macro-level  risk  factors.  One  study  identified  a  macro-level 
risk  factor  for  child  maltreatment,  which  was  the  usage  of 
mental health services during pregnancy. This study focused 
on characteristics of neglectful mothers (Bartlett et al., 2014) 
and found that adolescent mothers who had previously expe-
rienced IPV1 and received treatment for mental health issues 
during their pregnancy had a higher chance of infant neglect 
(p < .001).

What protective factors can buffer risk of child maltreat-
ment? There were 11 significant protective factors found in 
18 of the 68 included studies. Of the 18 studies, 15 had high-
risk  samples  and  the  remaining  three  studies  focused  on  a 
low-risk sample. Studies described their samples as high risk 
but differed in what was considered high or low risk. A pat-
tern was noted among studies that described their sample as 
high risk and the population had one or more of the follow-
ing:  (i)  the  presence  of  two  or  more  individual-level  risk 
factors (e.g., depression, stress, substance abuse), (ii) previ-
ous  involvement  with  CPSs,  (iii)  substantiated  current  or 
past record of child maltreatment, and (iv) parental history of 
childhood  maltreatment.  A  low-risk  sample,  on  the  other 
hand, had no prior child maltreatment history and were not 
known to CPSs. From these 18 studies, three studies also had 
comparison groups of high risk versus low risk (Bartlett & 
Easterborrks,  2015),  abuse  group  versus  non-abuse  group 
(Chan, 1994), and high risk versus medium risk versus low 
risk (Tracy et al., 2018). Figure 4 depicts the protective fac-
tors,  the  number  of  studies  that  measured  them,  and  their 
respective significant levels (p values).

In all, 10 studies found social support to be a significant 
protective factor (see Discussion, Protective factors for child

maltreatment  section  for  varying  definitions  of  social  sup-
port among studies). Ajdukovic et al. (2018) investigated the 
interaction between cumulative effect of risk (low maternal 
education, low satisfaction with housing conditions, and eco-
nomic hardship) and social support, finding that when social 
support  was  perceived  to  be  high,  the  effect  of  cumulative 
risk on the potential for child abuse was reduced. According 
to one study (Bartlett & Easterbrooks, 2015), mothers with a 
history  of  childhood  maltreatment  had  a  decreased  risk  of 
infant neglect if they received more social support. Negesh 
and Maguire-Jack (2016) also found that social support is a 
protective factor against child neglect and that perception of 
social  service  availability  reduced  the  likelihood  of  child 
physical abuse. Chan’s (1994) study showed that physically 
abusive  mothers  had  less  social  support  compared  to  non-
abusive mothers.

According to Li et al. (2011), mothers with a high level of 
social support were 0.29 times less likely to have a child pro-
tective report for maltreatment. Price-Wolf (2014) found that 
higher  emotional  support  was  linked  to  less  likelihood  of 
child physical abuse in mothers and fathers, but the link was 
stronger in women. There was also a link between fathers’ 
companionship  support  and  a  lower  risk  of  child  physical 
abuse, while mothers’ high companionship support was the 
inverse  (risk  factor).  Companionship  support  provides  a 
sense of social belonging and includes participation in shared 
social  and  recreational  activities.  For  both  parents,  being 
married  or  cohabiting  was  a  protective  mechanism  against 
the possibility of child physical abuse.

In  two  studies,  fathers’  involvement  in  their  children’s 
everyday  activities  was  found  to  be  a  protective  factor. 
According  to  Lee  et  al.’  (2012)  research,  daily  paternal 
involvement in child’s activities reduced the chance of child 
neglect. Lee et al.’s (2012) findings were supported by Slack 
et al.’s (2011) cross-study comparison. Other protective fac-
tors  included  an  increase  in  parenting  knowledge  which 
reduced risk of child maltreatment as well as actual maltreat-
ment  among  teen  mothers  who  had  a  history  of  childhood 
maltreatment (Bert et al., 2009). In the presence of several 
risk variables, having appropriate expectations of child based

reduced  probability  of  child  maltreatment  (DuMont  et  al., 
2012).

Is There Evidence that Risk and Protective 
Factors Differ Based on Type of Maltreatment?

In 44 of the 68 research studies, specific type(s) of maltreat-
ment were identified. The remaining 24 studies did not spec-
ify a type and instead used umbrella terms of child abuse and 
neglect or child maltreatment. There were 32 studies on risk 
factors  and  12  studies  on  both  risk  and  protective  factors 
among the 44 studies. There were 21 studies focused on phys-
ical  abuse,  six  studies  on  neglect,  one  study  on  emotional 
abuse,  and  one  on  sexual  abuse.  The  remaining  15  studies 
focused on various forms of maltreatment: two on physical 
and  emotional  abuse;  eight  on  physical  abuse  and  neglect; 
three  on  physical  abuse,  emotional  abuse,  and  neglect;  and 
two on physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect.

Micro-individual risk factors and maltreatment type.  As shown 
in Figure 5, two risk factors were common among all types 
of  maltreatment:  (i)  parenting  style  and  attitudes  to  child 
which  included  authoritarian  style  of  parenting,  lack  of 
enjoyment of child, and not encouraging autonomy in child 
for physical abuse (Corse et al., 1990); negative view of the 
child or hostile feelings toward the child for physical, sex-
ual,  emotional  abuse,  and  neglect  (Milner  &  Robertson, 
1990); and inconsistent discipline and poor supervision and 
monitoring  for  neglect  and  physical  abuse  (Berkout  & 
Kolko, 2016; Kajese et al., 2011). The second prevalent risk 
factor  was  (ii)  parents’  coping  style  and  mood  quality, 
which included rigidity, emotion-focused coping, dysregu-
lation  in  emotion,  and  this  was  also  common  among  all 
types  of  maltreatment  (Lowell  &  Renk,  2017;  Milner  & 
Robertson, 1990).

Several  risk  factors  were  found  among  three  types  of 
maltreatment: physical abuse, neglect, and emotional abuse 
including  stress,  parents’  mental  health,  substance  abuse, 

3704 

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 24(5)

parents’ young age, and parental history of childhood mal-
treatment. Stress, specifically related to parenting (Berkout 
&  Kolko,  2016;  Kim  &  Maguire-Jack,  2015;  Lee  et  al., 
2012;  Lowell  &  Renk,  2017;  Macguire-Jack  &  Negash, 
2016;  Mash  et  al.,  1983;  Price-Wolf,  2014),  was  found 
among  physical  abuse,  emotional  abuse,  and  neglect.  A 
common risk factor for two types of maltreatment (physical 
abuse  and  neglect)  included  corporal  punishment  of  child 
(Berkout  &  Kolko,  2016;  Slack  et  al.,  2011;  Whipple  & 
Webster-Stratton, 1991).

Risk factors at the individual level for a single maltreat-
ment type were mostly found for physical abuse and included 
memories of childhood abuse (De Paul & Domenech, 2000), 
infant feeding type (bottle feeding and not breast feeding) at 
the time of discharge from hospital (Kelly et al., 2017), mater-
nal low IQ (Pajer et al., 2014), negative parental traits such 
as  hostility  and  impulsivity  (Price-Wolf,  2014;  Rodriguez, 
2010), criminal history (Ricci et al., 2003), and parents’ cor-
poral punishment as children (Ross, 1996). Maternal smoking 
was found to be associated only with child neglect in only one 
study (Bartlett et al., 2014).

Micro-family-level risk factors and maltreatment type.  Among 
family-level  micro  risk  factors,  the  only  commonality 
between  the  four  maltreatment  types  was  IPV  (Banyard 
et  al.,  2003;  Bartlett  et  al.,  2014;  Hunter  et  al.,  2000; 
McGuigan & Pratt, 2001; Paveza, 1988; Ricci et al., 2003; 
Ross,  1996;  Tracy  et  al.,  2018).  Household  size  which 
included  number  of  children  and  number  of  adults  living 
within  a  home  was  common  between  neglect  (Dubowitz 
et al., 2011) and physical abuse (Chaffin et al., 1996; Con-
nelly & Straus, 1992; Wolfner & Gelles, 1993). Single parent 
family as a risk factor was found to be common for neglect, 
child physical abuse, and emotional abuse (Dubowitz et al., 
2011; Kelly et al., 2017; Kim & Maguire-Jack, 2015) while 
marital discord or distress was a common risk factor for sex-
ual  abuse  (Paveza,  1988),  neglect  (Zhao  et  al.,  2018)  and 
physical abuse (Whipple & Webster-Stratton, 1991). Engage-
ment of the father in child’s activities and everyday life was 
a  distinct  risk  factor  for  physical  abuse  (Guterman  et  al., 
2009). The only family-level risk factor for sexual abuse that 
was  not  detected  for  other  types  of  maltreatment  was  the 
low  quality  or  lack  of  closeness  of  the  mother–daughter 
relationship  (Paveza,  1988).  There  were  no  specific  risk 
factors which were found for emotional abuse.

Mezzo-level risk factors and maltreatment type.  There were no 
risk factors for emotional maltreatment found in the studies. 
Low  income  and  social  isolation  were  two  risk  factors  for 
sexual  abuse,  physical  abuse,  and  neglect  (Bartlett  et  al., 
2014; Corse et al., 1990). Economic hardship was a common 
risk factor for physical abuse and neglect (Ajdukovic et al., 
2018;  Maguire-Jack  &  Negash,  2016).  Within  the  mezzo 
level, no distinct indicators of risk for sexual abuse or neglect 
were found. Physical abuse, on the other hand, had three risk 

factors independent from other forms of maltreatment. These 
were parental unemployment (Guterman et al., 2009; Ricci 
et  al.,  2003),  poorer  social  status2  (Pajer  et  al.,  2014),  and 
maternal companionship support (Price-Wolf, 2014).

Macro-level  risk  factors  and  maltreatment  type.  Within  the 
macro-level  risk  factors,  there  were  no  findings  related  to 
emotional abuse. Disadvantaged neighborhood was found to 
be  a  common  risk  factor  for  physical,  sexual  abuse,  and 
neglect (Drake & Pandey, 1996; Freisthler et al., 2017; Price-
Wolf,  2014).  A  distinct  risk  factor  was  found  for  neglect, 
which  was  the  use  of  mental  health  service.  Bartlett  et  al.’ 
(2014)  study  found  that  one  of  the  risk  factors  of  infant 
neglect  among  adolescent  mothers  is  use  of  mental  health 
services since becoming pregnant.

Protective  factors  and  maltreatment  type.  In  all,  13  studies 
found  significant  connections  between  protective  variables 
and types of abuse. Ten of the studies cited social support as 
a protective factor, while three others found positive parent-
ing  and  involvement  in  children’s  activities  as  protective. 
Social  support  was  protective  for  physical  and  emotional 
abuse and neglect. In the studies that were included, no pro-
tective factors for sexual abuse were investigated.

Two  studies  (Freisthler  et  al.,  2017;  Price-Wolf,  2014) 
found  maternal  emotional  support  to  be  associated  a  with 
lower  frequency  of  child  physical  abuse.  Freisthler  et  al.’ 
study (2017) showed an association between high emotional 
support for mothers and a lower potential for child physical 
abuse  and  neglect.  While  Price-Wolf’s  (2014)  study  also 
found  that  being  married  or  cohabiting  (for  mothers  and 
fathers)  was  also  protective  against  child  physical  abuse. 
Paternal  companionship  support  was  discovered  to  be 
inversely related to child physical abuse. One study (Banyard 
et  al.,  2003)  showed  a  link  between  friendship  support  as 
protective  of  physical  abuse  and  neglect  risk.  Ajdukovic 
et al. (2018) investigated mothers’ perception of social sup-
port, finding that if mothers felt that they were in receipt of a 
high level of social support, they were less likely to physi-
cally abuse their children. Negash and Maguire-Jack’ (2016) 
study looked at perception of social support and found that it 
was protective against both physical abuse and neglect.

Discussion

In  this  systematic  review,  most  parental  risk  factors  were 
found  at  the  micro  level  (both  individual  and  family) 
including  stress  (parenting  and  life  pressures),  substance 
misuse,  mental  health  concerns,  IPV,  childhood  maltreat-
ment  history,  single-parent  families,  and  marital  strife. 
Economic  disadvantage  and  social  isolation  were  the 
mezzo-level  risk  factors.  At  the  macro  level,  the  use  of 
mental  health  services  among  adolescent  mothers  since 
pregnancy  increased  the  risk  of  infant  neglect.  Protective 
factors  on  a  micro-family  ecological  level  were  paternal

Maternal history of childhood maltreatment was the second most common risk factor and recollection 
and memories of the maltreatment experienced was more significant than its actual occurrence when 
associated with child maltreatment

18 studies established a link between parental substance use and child maltreatment potential, with the

IPV was found to be significantly associated in 12 studies and most linked to neglect and child physical abuse
21 studies measured single-parent family as a risk factor and 9 found a significant association. This  

co-occurred with multiple other risk factors such as low income and low social support

Marital distress was significantly associated in five studies. This includes separation, divorce, and marital 

disagreement

Mezzo risk factors

Economic deprivation and welfare receipt were linked to physical abuse and neglect and co-occurred with 

more than 3 minor children at home, maternal smoking, low education, and high stress

Social isolation was described differently by the studies with some describing it as lack of child rearing 

support or lack of peer support and others used maternal perceptions and satisfaction with perceived 
support

One specific risk factor was found for paternal sexual abuse—lack of mother–child closeness

12 studies specified type of maltreatment and association with protective factors. Social support was 
a common protective factor for physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Specific types of social 
support such as maternal emotional support and friendship support were protective for child physical 
abuse. Maternal perception of high social support was also found to be protective against child physical 
abuse. No protective factor for child sexual abuse was found in the included studies

daily  involvement  with  child,  positive  interactions  with 
child,  increase  in  knowledge  about  parenting,  and  breast-
feeding for more than 4 months. The most common mezzo-
level protective factor was social support. For differences 
based  on  maltreatment  type,  neglect,  physical,  emotional, 
and sexual abuse were all linked to IPV, parenting style and 
attitudes,  and  parenting  coping  style.  The  remaining  risk 
factors  were  mainly  similar  across  one  or  more  types  of 
maltreatment,  while  physical  abuse,  neglect,  and  sexual 
abuse each had their own distinct set of risk factors. Social 
support  was  found  to  buffer  against  physical,  emotional 
abuse, and neglect but not for sexual abuse. A summary of 
critical findings is presented in Tables 2 and 3. 

Micro-level Individual Risk Factors

A key finding of parental mental health as a risk factor at the 
micro-individual  ecological  level  is  confirmed  by  prior 
research. For instance, parental PTSD symptoms are associ-
ated  with  an  increased  risk  of  child  maltreatment  (Cross 
et al., 2018) and BPD has been linked to child maltreatment 
more than any other personality disorder (Battle et al., 2004; 
Yen  et  al.,  2002).  Further  to  this,  a  lack  of  response  from 
caregivers during childhood can result in a decreased ability 
to regulate emotions as adults (Hughes et al., 2012) which is 
a  key  marker  of  BPD. A  prior  cohort  study  (Widom  et  al., 
2009)  found  that  significantly  more  maltreated  children

associated risk, it was clear that there is a high level of co-occurrence of risk especially for child physical 
abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Interventions need to target multiple ecological levels bearing in 
mind the multitude of risks which may be present at each level

Compared to physical abuse and neglect, studies focusing on parental perpetration of emotional and child 
sexual abuse were fewer. More studies need to be conducted to get a clearer idea of risk and protection 
association with these maltreatment types

Far fewer studies reported protective factors compared to risk factors. A more balanced approach in 

research can help mitigate known risk factors and aid practitioners in developing tools that can buffer 
multiple risks

Studies differed greatly in how they described certain maltreatment types (e.g., terms used for physical 

abuse were interchangeable with harsh discipline or punitive parenting) and in the description of certain 
risk and protective factors (e.g., social support was described as emotional support in one study and 
perceived availability of services in another). Uniformity in categorization, description, and definition can 
help aid research in the field of child maltreatment

(compared  to  non-maltreated,  demographically  controlled 
children) matched criteria for a BPD diagnosis in adulthood. 
Consequently, parents with a childhood history of maltreat-
ment may be more likely to develop BPD, increasing the risk 
of intergenerational transmission of child maltreatment.

Intriguingly, one study’s findings revealed that memories 
of childhood abuse rather than just its occurrence contribute 
to the likelihood of maltreatment continuance. In a longitudi-
nal study conducted by De Paul and Domenech (2000), ado-
lescent  mothers  with  recollections  of  childhood  physical 
abuse  were  more  likely  to  maltreat  their  newborns  than 
women  with  a  history  of  childhood  physical  abuse  but  no 
memory of it. While research in this area is sparse to prove 
that memories of abuse are linked to future abuse potential, 
one study by Caliso and Milner (1992) found similar results 
to that of De Paul and Domenech’s (2000) study. Thornberry 
et  al.’  (2013)  found  a  lesser-known  link  between  parents’ 
experience and timing of abuse in childhood and their future 
maltreatment potential. Using prospective longitudinal data, 
researchers  discovered  that  parents  with  a  history  of  child 
maltreatment  were  2.6  times  more  likely  to  maltreat  their 
children  when  parents  were  aged  between  21  and  30 years 
(Thornberry  et  al.,  2013).  However,  there  can  be  under-
estimation of actual maltreatment as this study only examined 
validated CPS records to determine maltreatment.

This  review  also  found  parental  substance  abuse  to  be 
strongly correlated to child physical abuse and neglect and 
this can be attributed to a variety of variables, including alco-
hol’s  pharmacological  effects  on  the  brain.  Parents  with 
identified substance use disorders are consistently reported 
in the literature to be at a higher risk of child maltreatment, 
particularly for child physical abuse (Lasslett et al., 2012). 
Targeting  prevention  efforts  at  recovery  and  avoidance  of 
relapse among substance abusing parents can help buffer the 
risk of maltreatment.

Micro-level  family  risk  factors.  IPV  was  the  most  common 
micro family-level risk factor and coincides with findings of 
prior  systematic  reviews  (e.g.,  Hindley  et  al.,  2006).  This 
review found that IPV is most closely linked to child physi-
cal abuse and neglect (e.g., Bartlett et al., 2014; McGuigan 
&  Pratt,  2001;  Ricci  et  al.,  2003)  and  that  it  tends  to  co-
occur with other individual-level risk factors such as pater-
nal criminal history (Duffy et al., 2015), maternal depression, 
and  paternal  substance  abuse  (Hunter  et  al.,  2000).  Prior 
research has highlighted the association between poly-vic-
timization  (exposure  to  multiple  and  traumatic  violence; 
Bidarra et al., 2016) in childhood and subsequent perpetra-
tion of IPV and child maltreatment in adulthood (Song et al., 
2022). These findings can aid practitioners to provide early 
prevention services for those children who are exposed to a 
co-occurrence of risk to prevent future perpetration of both 
IPV and child maltreatment and provide tailored services 
to  help  break  intergenerational  cycles  of  violence  within 
families.

One finding of this review is that parents’ single status is 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  child  maltreatment. 
However, single parenthood does not occur in isolation and 
most  of  the  co-occurring  risk  factors,  as  evidenced  by  this 
review’s findings and by prior research, can be a by-product 
of being a single parent, such as low income, low social sup-
port, and associated stresses (Berger, 2004; Stith et al., 2009). 
Single-parent families may benefit from support (e.g., hous-
ing, employment, income support) that can help reduce stress 
resulting from the additional responsibilities of being a sin-
gle parent.

Mezzo risk factors.  This review’s finding that social isolation 
is a key risk factor for child maltreatment is further supported 
by a body of evidence that associates maternal social isola-
tion with a heightened risk of child abuse (Black et al., 2001; 

Younas and Gutman 

3707

Stith et al., 2009). Consequently, provision of a high level of 
social support along with satisfaction from that support may 
help to mitigate child maltreatment risk.

Macro  risk  factors.  At the macro level, there was only one 
significant association with child neglect and use of mental 
health services during pregnancy among adolescent mothers 
who  had  been  victims  of  IPV. This  is  further  linked  to  an 
association  at  the  micro  level  of  adolescent  mothers  and 
infant neglect and paternal mental health and child maltreat-
ment. Prior research has found that adolescent mothers have 
a higher chance of developing postpartum depression (Reid 
& Meadows-Oliver, 2007). A childhood history of maltreat-
ment  can  also  contribute  to  the  development  of  mental 
health disorders, psychological distress, and trauma which 
are  established  risk  factors  for  child  abuse  and  neglect 
(Zelenko et al., 2001). Adolescent mothers battling mental 
health issues may have co-occurrence of multiple adver-
sities  which  inevitably  heighten  their  potential  for  child 
maltreatment.

Protective  factors  for  child  maltreatment.  This  review  found 
fewer protective factors than risk factors with social support 
being the most common protective factor against various risk 
factors. This finding corroborates previous evidence in this 
field (e.g., Meng et al., 2018) where social support is consis-
tently considered a buffering mechanism for child maltreat-
ment. This review found that greater emotional support for 
mothers was correlated with a lower incidence of child phys-
ical abuse than that for fathers, despite its association as also 
protective for fathers (Price-Wolf, 2014). On the other hand, 
companionship support was found to be protective for fathers 
whereas companionship support for mothers was associated 
with  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  child  physical  abuse. 
While  there  is  little  research  on  companionship  support 
explicitly,  one  prior  study  found  that  companionship  sup-
port can act as a conduit for alcohol use, potentially increas-
ing the likelihood of physical abuse (Freisthler et al., 2015). 
It is also possible that mothers might find socializing to be 
arduous  and  stressful  when  coupled  with  childcare  duties 
and  associated  stresses,  whereas  fathers  may  find  it  to  be 
more relaxing.

No protective factors were studied at the macro ecologi-
cal  level  within  the  included  studies.  A  recent  literature 
review with different search criteria than this study (Austin 
et  al.,  2020),  however,  found  research  evidence  which 
shows  macro-level  protective  factors.  Paid  family  leave 
policy has been associated with a decrease in infant abusive 
head trauma (Klevens et al., 2016) and increased minimum 
wage with a reduction in child protective investigations for 
neglect (Raisin & Bullinger, 2017). However, these two cited 
studies  were  based  in  California  and  findings  reflect  only 
that population and has limited application to all parents at 
risk of child maltreatment.

Risk factors by maltreatment type.  While a considerable over-
lap of risk factors among types of maltreatment was found, 
there were a few that were shared by all types of maltreat-
ment, as well as others that were unique to physical, sexual 
abuse, and neglect.

Parenting style and attitudes (micro-family level) which 
included a negative attitude and style of parenting was one 
of the common risk factors for all types. This risk factor was 
defined differently between studies and included unrealistic 
expectations  of  child  (DuMont  et  al.,  2012),  authoritarian 
control (Corse et al., 1990), and erratic disciplining (Berkout 
&  Kolko,  2016). A  prior  systematic  review  of  risk  factors 
also found that poor parenting, such as the ones mentioned 
earlier, increases the risk of maltreatment recurrence (White 
et al., 2015). Maternal negative emotional state (Lowell & 
Renk, 2017) was also found to be common among all mal-
treatment types. This review, however, only found one study 
that  showed  a  link  between  maternal  negative  emotional 
state and child maltreatment potential. One issue with this 
study was that it comprised of a fairly homogeneous sample 
(Caucasian, married, college degrees) which was considered 
to be low risk. Nevertheless, maternal emotional state should 
be investigated further in respect to its links to specific types 
of maltreatment. The final common risk factor was IPV. A 
meta-analysis  of  risk  factors  found  “spousal  violence”  to 
have a large effect size but only for child physical abuse 
and neglect (Stith et al., 2009). Another systematic review 
(White  et  al.,  2015)  supported  this  finding  and  found 
“domestic violence” to be significantly associated with all 
maltreatment types.

There were also risk factors which were exclusive to one 
type  of  maltreatment.  Maternal  smoking,  which  was  mea-
sured  in  two  of  the  four  studies  on  parental  smoking,  was 
only linked to child neglect but mothers in the samples all 
had co-occurrence of other risk factors. Bartlett et al.’ (2014) 
study, for example, found that mothers who smoked during 
pregnancy and neglected their infants also had lower incomes 
compared  to  non-maltreating  mothers.  This  review’s  find-
ings included a retrospective study (Wu et al., 2004) which 
examined  child  protective  records  and  found  neglectful 
mothers of infants also were in receipt of welfare, were sin-
gle mothers, and had two or more minor children at home in 
addition to smoking. Previous research has also revealed that 
child  physical  abuse  is  linked  to  later-life  smoking  (Yoon 
et al., 2020), suggesting that these mothers may have experi-
enced maltreatment as children.

The  lack  of  a  close  relationship  between  mother  and 
daughter was found as a distinct risk factor for paternal child 
sexual  abuse  (Paveza,  1988).  Animosity  between  mothers 
and daughters can increase the risk of daughters being vic-
tims  of  child  sexual  abuse  by  anyone  and  not  just  fathers 
(Schechter et al., 2002). In addition, we found that there was 
a sparsity of studies on parental risk factors for child sexual 
abuse within the included studies. This could be indicative of 

3708 

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 24(5)

trends in the wider literature on child maltreatment as there 
are  fewer  studies  on  child  sexual  abuse.  More  research  is 
needed to see whether there is a link between the quality of 
mother–daughter relationship and paternal sexual abuse.

This  review  did  not  find  any  exclusive  risk  factors  for 
emotional abuse but did find some which were also common 
to other types of maltreatment. A previous systematic review 
(Black et al., 2002) on risk factors for emotional abuse found 
only six studies of relevance demonstrating that this type of 
maltreatment,  on  its  own,  is  far  less  studied  than  physical 
abuse or child neglect; hence, it becomes difficult to extract 
risk factors that only occur for emotional abuse and not other 
types  of  abuse. A  review  by  Black  et  al.  (2002)  identified 
various parental risk factors for emotional or psychological 
abuse,  including  those  previously  mentioned  such  as  the 
prevalence of IPV in the home and low income.

Protective  factors  by  maltreatment  type.  Physical  and  emo-
tional abuse and neglect all had social support as a protective 
factor, however, we did not find protective factors for sexual 
abuse. Social support, everyday father’s involvement in chil-
dren’s lives, and positive parenting behaviors were found to 
be protective for neglect. A meta-analysis on risk and protec-
tive factors for child maltreatment (Austin et al., 2020) had 
similar  findings  showing  that  a  higher  availability  of 
services  (e.g.,  social  services),  community  involvement, 
and support from friends and family, can all provide protec-
tion against child maltreatment. Further to this, fathers’ shar-
ing of domestic responsibility, providing emotional support 
to mothers as well as being actively involved with children 
tend to lower maternal stress and thus the risk of child mal-
treatment (Dubowitz et al., 2000).

Limitations.  This systematic review has a few limitations that 
must be considered. Evidence on risk factors from the mezzo 
and  especially  the  macro  levels  is  sparse,  highlighting  the 
need for more attention and research to be focused on these 
ecological levels. Another issue is that most studies included 
in this review focused on mothers, perhaps because they are 
generally the primary caregivers of children, but this means 
that  findings  from  these  studies  may  not  be  applicable  to 
fathers.  Furthermore,  many  included  studies  were  correla-
tional, thus determining causality is not possible. As a result, 
it is probable that some risk factors are simply indications of 
risk rather than direct contributors. In addition, much of the 
included  literature  focused  on  child  physical  abuse  and 
neglect, and this search did not provide many studies on risk 
and protective variables for child sexual and emotional abuse. 
Lack of clarity in how abuse is defined, recorded, and mea-
sured, as well as difficulty in substantiating parent perpetrated 
emotional and sexual abuse, may contribute to underreporting 
and  less  research  on  these  two  types  compared  to  physical 
abuse and neglect. Furthermore, studies on parental risk and 
protective factors for child maltreatment included in this sys-
tematic review may also not be representative of all studies 

conducted. While the search was thorough, and every pre-
caution taken to ensure relevant studies were not overlooked, 
narrowness  of  the  inclusion  criteria  can  contribute  to  the 
possible exclusion of other valuable research.

A lack of resources prevented second coding of included 
studies  to  establish  inter-rater  reliability.  While  double 
screening is the recommended approach, Shemilt et al. (2016) 
notes that the decision to use a single reviewer in the search-
ing and selecting of studies in a systematic review can “. . .
substantively reduce the overall workload and total costs of 
systematic  review  production”  (p.  11).  A  methodological 
systematic  review  assessing  the  usefulness  of  the  single-
screening approach in study selection concludes that results 
emanating  from  this  approach  are  “. . .robust  enough  to 
establish  this  approach  as  a  methodological  shortcut” 
(Waffenschmidt et al., 2019, p. 8). However, to minimize the 
potential risk of bias emanating from single coding, multiple 
searches were conducted, and keywords revised to ensure no 
relevant study was missed.

Lastly, there were few options to synthesize the extensive 
findings. A meta-analysis was not performed because of het-
erogeneity  among  studies.  A  contentious  method  of  vote 
counting  was  thus  used.  Vote  counting  has  predominantly 
been used in meta-analytic studies (Bushman & Wang, 2009) 
and  this  approach  is  considered  by  researchers  (Friedman, 
2001; Rafaeli-Mor & Steinberg, 2002; Warner, 2001) to be 
limiting  as  focus  is  only  on  the  frequency  of  significance. 
This may not be valuable for studies systematically review-
ing  evaluations  of  interventions,  as  using  vote  counting  to 
differentiate  between  studies  showing  benefit  (positive 
studies) or studies showing harm (negative studies) does not 
reflect  accuracy  of  effect.  But  this  review  did  not  include 
intervention studies and hence, vote counting was chosen to 
synthesize findings (Cwikel et al., 2000).

Implications and recommendations for research.  The findings 
from this review can provide practitioners tools for formu-
lating strategies based on type of maltreatment and type of 
risk. Intervention strategies such as intervening during preg-
nancy,  encouraging  new  and  especially  young  mothers  to 
breastfeed  to  support  positive  attachment  between  mother 
and  child,  enhancing  parenting  knowledge,  among  others, 
may reduce the risk of child maltreatment. Addressing par-
ents’ trauma caused by their own childhood history of mal-
treatment may also reduce risk as it usually co-occurs with 
multiple  risk  factors. Encouraging fathers’ involvement in 
their  children’s  lives  may  contribute  to  reducing  maternal 
stress  and  increasing  perceived  and  actual  social  support, 
thus in turn, lowering the risk of child maltreatment. Further 
to  this,  provision  of  services  which  reduce  parents’  stress, 
such  as  help  with  housing  or  employment,  can  help  mini-
mize risk, especially for vulnerable parents such as adoles-
cent mothers or single-parent families. For example, social 
support provision can help protect against co-occurring risk 
and  reduce  parents’  stress  (micro-individual)  by  helping 

Younas and Gutman

them with practical issues such as childcare (micro-family), 
employment  and  education  (mezzo),  housing  conditions 
(mezzo), or protection from a violent partner (micro-family). 
These  findings  can  further  guide  interventions  targeting 
vulnerable  families  with  co-occurring  risks  and  provide 
strategies that can be effective at multiple ecological levels.
The findings of this review on protective factors also mir-
ror some of the intervening strategies of programs targeting 
reduction of parental risk of child maltreatment. For instance, 
group-based and community-based parenting programs such 
as  the  Durham  Family  Initiative  (Dodge  et  al.,  2004)  have 
been shown to be effective in improving parenting and reduc-
ing child maltreatment risk and this may be due to the addi-
tional social support element present in such programs.

A  recent  qualitative  study  examining  effective  compo-
nents  in  intergenerational  child  maltreatment  interventions 
for parents found social support, regulating parents’ emo-
tions and, enhancement in parents’ child development knowl-
edge  as  some  of  the  protective  mechanisms  that  can  help 
break the cycle of maltreatment (Younas & Gutman, 2022). 
More research, however, needs to be conducted on protective 
factors  to  minimize  or  prevent  child  maltreatment.  Further 
systematic reviews can examine effective parental interven-
tions  and  intervening  strategies  for  type-specific  maltreat-
ment risk to further knowledge on protective factors in child 
maltreatment prevention. Specifically, research focusing on 
delineating risk and protective factors for parent perpetrated 
emotional  and  sexual  abuse  can  further  knowledge  and 
inform  prevention  and  treatment  services.  Certain  nuances 
within the findings of this review, for instance, memories of 
childhood maltreatment history among parents as opposed to 
occurrence  of  child  maltreatment  and  its  association  with 
further  perpetration  of  child  maltreatment,  companionship 
support and its protective effects on fathers versus mothers, 
among others, require further investigation.

Diversity.  From the 68 studies, 52 were conducted in United 
States. Only one study was conducted in each of these coun-
tries:  India,  China,  Canada,  and  New  Zealand,  while  the 
remaining 12 were from European countries. While child 
maltreatment remains a global concern, much of the litera-
ture  and  research  emanates  from  the  Northwestern  part  of 
the hemisphere and this disparity is depicted in the studies 
included in this systematic review. Further to this, the impact 
of culture and the way child maltreatment is defined across 
cultures seems to be lacking within the literature. Given the 
cultural diversity in populations and the impact of globaliza-
tion,  it  seems  relevant  to  contextualize  child  maltreatment 
within  culture.  This  may  bring  to  light  unique  risk  and 
protective factors which can only enrich the study of child 
maltreatment and its prevention and treatment.

There is also a greater emphasis on mothers and less so on 
fathers. This is represented in the included studies’ samples 
with 36 of the 68 included studies which had a population 
sample of mothers while the remaining 31 focused on both 

parents and families. No study looked at only fathers. This 
can pose a variety of problems such as a lack of unique inter-
ventions for fathers which are effective and relevant based 
on the specific needs and strengths of fathers.

Conclusion

The findings are consistent with previous systematic reviews 
and  reflect  well-known  parental  risk  and  protective  factors 
within  this  field.  Expanding  previous  research,  this  review 
highlights the overlap between different types of abuse and 
associated risk and protective factors. IPV was found to be a 
common risk factor for all types of abuse. The findings sug-
gest that fathers’ lack of involvement with their children, rec-
ollections of childhood abuse, and corporal punishment were 
some of the specific risk factors for child physical abuse. A 
lack  of  intimacy  between  mother  and  daughter  was  exclu-
sively linked to an increased likelihood of father-perpetrated 
sexual  abuse.  Maternal  neglect  of  infants  was  exclusively 
linked  to  maternal  smoking.  Neglect,  physical  abuse,  and 
mental abuse were all linked to the buffering effect of social 
support, although the way it was classified differed among 
studies. The  results  illuminate  under-researched  areas  such 
as the significance of memories of childhood abuse in per-
petuating risk (De Paul & Domenech, 2000), the association 
between parental age and the likelihood of maintaining the 
cycle of child abuse (Thornberry et al., 2013), and high com-
panionship support as protective for fathers but a risk factor 
for  mothers  for  physical  abuse  (Price-Wolf,  2014).  While 
these  may  be  stand-alone  findings,  they  present  unique 
insights and require further research.

Overall,  the  findings  reflect  the  complex  field  of  child 
maltreatment  and  that  even  after  decades  of  research,  evi-
dence  is  far  from  conclusive.  More  research  needs  to  be 
undertaken  to  understand  these  phenomenon  to  ultimately 
ensure the effectiveness of prevention services. The findings 
from this systematic review can serve to help target and tailor 
services to at-risk parents on multiple ecological levels.
