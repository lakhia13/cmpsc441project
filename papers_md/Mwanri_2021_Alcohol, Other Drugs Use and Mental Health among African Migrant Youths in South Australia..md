Abstract: This paper was part of a large study that explored suicide among African youths in South
Australia. The paper reports perspectives about alcohol and other drugs (AOD) use and mental health
among African migrant and refugee youths in South Australia. The study employed a qualitative
inquiry, conducting 23 individual interviews and one focus group discussion with eight participants.
An acculturative stress model informed data analysis, interpretation and the discussion of the ﬁndings
that form the current paper. African migrant and refugee youths revealed challenging stressors,
including related to cultural, socioeconomic, living conditions, and pre- and post-migration factors
that contributed to mental health problems and the use of AOD in their new country. The traumatic
loss of family members and social disruption experienced in their countries of origin were expressed
as part of factors leading to migration to Australia. While in Australia, African migrant and refugee
youths experienced substantial stressors related to inadequate socioeconomic and cultural support,
discrimination, poverty, and unemployment. Participants believed that differences in cultural
perspectives about AOD use that existed in Africa and Australia also shaped the experiences of
social stressors. Additionally, participants believed that these cultural differences and the identiﬁed
stressors determined AOD use and mental health problems. The ﬁndings highlight the need to
understand these social and cultural contexts to improve mental health services and help reduce
the use of AOD, which, when problematic, can inﬂuence the health and integration experiences of
these populations.

1. Introduction
1.1. Migration and Resettlement of African Refugees

Across the world, the ease of travel and international mobility have increased, includ-
ing for people from Africa. Additionally, in 2000, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) called for the need to provide resettlement opportunities for
refugees who have spent several years in refugee camps in challenging conditions [1], espe-
cially from the African continent. Following the UNHCR calls, the Australian Government
declared a humanitarian commitment to resettle refugees from African nations, particularly
those living in protracted refugee situations from the Horn of Africa. This commitment
resulted in a sharp increase in the proportion of refugees resettled from African countries,
rising from 33 per cent in 2003 to 70 per cent in 2005 [2]. In 2012–2013, over half of visas
granted under the Humanitarian Program were allocated to people born in Sub-Saharan
Africa, North Africa, and the Middle-East, with 39.2 per cent of all persons granted visas
being aged between 0 and 17 years [3]. There were 317,182 people born in Sub-Saharan
Africa in Australia in 2016, and over 20,000 were living in South Australia [4].

During the process of immigration, migrant and humanitarian refugees are exposed
to multiple stressors [5,6]. Studies among African migrants (the majority of whom have a

refugee background in Australia) have reported signiﬁcant stressors relating to inadequate
employment, housing, education, and integration following settlement [7–9]. Additionally,
there are considerable and diverse migration trajectories experienced between and within
refugee groups. Pre-migration contexts such as cultural backgrounds, the country of origin
and circumstances surrounding the decision to immigrate can affect groups and individuals
in a range of ways, including poor mental health outcomes [10].

1.2. Migrants and Refugee Youths, Alcohol and Other Drug Use and Mental Health

The age at which a migrant and refugee migrate, and the related settlement opportu-
nities and challenges can have a profound inﬂuence on mental health. A study suggests
that compared to other migrant groups, migrant youths are more likely to be at a higher
risk of suicide [11]. Migrant and refugee youths experience an increased risk of self-harm
behaviors and are vulnerable to suicidal ideation because of challenges to the social factors
following resettlement, described previously [12]. Migrant and refugee youths are also at
risk of increased alcohol and other drugs (AOD) use, which increases individual risks to
mental health problems and suicide [13]. AOD use among migrant and refugee youths has
also been linked with experiences of social, emotional, and behavioral problems, including
feeling depressed [14].

In Australia, these are serious issues because a large proportion of young people
who emigrated from war-torn areas in Africa and the Middle East in the last decade
arrived unaccompanied, without parents or guardians, in their critical stage in life [3]. It is
important to point out that despite the increased risks of migrant and refugee youths to
AOD use and mental health, African migrant and refugee youths are resilient, which play
protective roles in reducing the use of AOD and related harms [15].

Although previous research has explored the resettlement and integration particularly
of African refugees [16], there is a dearth of research examining the beliefs about AOD use
and mental health among African migrant and refugee youths in Australia [17]. African
migrant and refugees, including youths, are under-serviced by AOD and mental health
services. This inequity in service requires more research to enhance an understanding of
this community [18].

1.3. Aims of the Study

This study was commissioned by the African Communities Council of South Australia
(ACCSA), an overarching organization for African communities in South Australia, to
determine the perspectives of African youths (the majority of whom has a refugee back-
ground) in South Australia on suicide, AOD use and mental health following increased
suicide among youths in this community. This paper presents part of the ﬁndings from this
project and explores the perspective of African migrant and refugee youths on AOD use
and issues of mental health. This study aims to contribute to the limited existing literature
on AOD use and mental health problems in the African communities by understanding
the contexts in which AOD use and mental health issue occur among African migrant and
refugee youths in Australia. We attempted to achieve this aim by answering the research
question: What are the main factors that inﬂuence AOD use among African youths in
South Australia?

2. Methods
2.1. Theoretical Framework

We employed the acculturative stress model to guide our data analysis and interpre-
tation. This model focusses on understanding the unique stressors that are rooted in the
process of acculturation [19]. Acculturation is a process of cultural change experienced
by migrants following a contact with or living in a different cultural environment, and
it is understood to be complex and dynamic [20]. According to Berry, Kim, Minde, and
Mok [19], the process of acculturation and related stressors can lead to a stressful expe-
rience of resettlement and integration. They argue that individuals might have different

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1534

experiences during the process of acculturation and that stressors might depend on the
degree of their experience.

Culture and identity, reasons for migration, language, demographic characteristics,
social practices, and cultural values are reported factors moderating experiences of accultur-
ation and stressors [21]. Acculturative stress is reported to be a risk factor to mental health
outcomes among refugees [22]. Although the concept of acculturative stress model has
been used in studying different refugee groups, the use of this model is needed to under-
stand the nature of stressors resulting from acculturation of African refugees, particularly
youths following their resettlement in Australia.

2.2. Study Design and Recruitment of Participants

The study employed a qualitative inquiry and respectively conducted 23 face to face
interviews and one focus group discussion with eight youths aged 18–25 years who lived
in South Australia. Participants had arrived in South Australia between 2000 and 2012.
Participants were purposively selected to ensure we had representation from different age
groups, year of arrival, and countries of origin from Central, Eastern, and Western Africa.
Although the majority of the participants had a refugee background, participants who did
not have a refugee background were also included recognizing that the youth population
is susceptible to a mental health issue in their new country [6]. Because we have included
both migrant and refugee youths, we will from here on use African migrant youths to
denote both participants with or without a refugee background and we acknowledge the
overrepresentation of those with a refugee background among the study participants.

We recruited participants through an African community youth worker who invited
potential youths who spoke conversational English to enroll and participate in the study.
This method of recruitment was a strength for the project in that, it did draw from the
perspective of the community strength, using the youth worker’s position, and not rely
upon other service providers to link researchers to participants. The researchers explained
the aim and scope of the research to the community youth worker who then invited other
youths to participate. Individuals then referred the researchers on to friends who were
eligible to be invited to participate face-to-face. All participants were informed about the
study and accepted to participate voluntarily.

Data collection included 23 one-on-one interviews and one focus group discussion
with eight participants. All interviews and focus group discussion were conducted in
English and held at a place where young people felt comfortable.

The interview and focus group guides (Table 1) explored issues on premigration
experiences, challenges and difﬁculties faced in Australia, why some young people may
use AOD or take their own life, how they come to use drugs or alcohol, the impacts of AOD
use, how they would describe the AOD use among their friends, issues concerning AOD
and mental health, social networks and support, family relationships, seeking support from
mental health and AOD services, and community support. The interview and focus group
discussion guides were informed by research literature and questions were designed to
ensure ﬂexibility to expand on points of interest and to explore issues that were important
for the topic [23]. Participants were encouraged to actively engage in expressing their
views and were made to feel safe talking about stigmatized issues.

2.3. Ethical Considerations

The Flinders University Social and Behavioral Ethics Committee (SBREC) approved
the study protocols. The permission to collect information from members of the community
was also obtained from ACCSA. Each study participant received an information sheet
outlining details of the research and its purpose before commencing interviewing or focus
group discussions. Participants were assured that their identity would be kept conﬁdential
and all names would be replaced with pseudonyms. Although they all lived across the
suburbs of Adelaide, some, but not all focus group participants knew each other.

Researchers reminded participants that information disclosed in the focus group
discussion needed to remain conﬁdential. All participants provided written consent and
received information on their rights to terminate their participation at any time during the
focus group discussion or the interview. Each participant received a list of professional
counselling agencies and offered a free, private, and anonymous follow-up counselling
session with costs covered by ACCSA. Each participant was reimbursed $30 for their time
and other expenses incurred to participate in the study.

2.4. Data Analysis

The focus group discussions and interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed ver-
batim. Both authors are experienced qualitative researchers, were part of the investigating
team, and analyzed the transcripts to ensure credibility, rigor, transparency, and validity of
the analytic process [24].

To provide coherence and structure [25], we used the framework approach described
by Ritchie and Spencer [26]. The framework identiﬁed ﬁve steps of data analysis involving
familiarization with the data, coding and identifying themes, indexing, charting, mapping,
and interpreting the data. In line with this framework, the researchers identiﬁed passages
of text according to the context, coded them to several relevant categories and assigned
the related codes into themes. The analysis was dualistic including inductive, with cate-
gories emerging purely from the data and deductive, with categories derived from prior
knowledge and the thematic approach enhanced the rigor, transparency, and validity of the
analytic process [24,25]. Table 2 provides a snapshot of data analysis for the current paper.
The research team members are experienced in working with young people from
African backgrounds and were also members of the African community in South Australia.
This background was vital across the continuum of the project and eased the data collection,
analysis, and interpretations. Additionally, being members of the African community
facilitated trust and rapports between the participants and researchers, although it could
have played out exactly in the opposite way.

3. Findings
3.1. Characteristics of the Study Participants

The average age of the interview (Table 3) and focus group (Table 4) participants
was 22 years old. The interview participants involved 8 females and 15 males from ﬁve
different countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Sudan,
Liberia, Ethiopia, and Burundi. The focus group members consisted of six females and
one male originally from South Sudan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Burundi, and Somalia.
Tables 3 and 4 provide the characteristics of the study participants.

There were three themes describing the perspectives of African migrant youths in
South Australia reported, including (i) Pre-migration contexts and losses, (ii) Post-migration
contexts and realities, and (iii) Contextualizing AOD use and mental health. These themes
are described in detail below.

3.2. Pre-Migration Contexts and Losses

The narratives from the participants revealed that most African youths arrived in
Australia as refugees and stressors related to separations from or witnessing deaths of
family and relatives while ﬂeeing from home countries had signiﬁcant life impacts. The
pre-migration deaths of parents meant that many youths came to Australia with relatives
or sole parents. Some youths described their relationships with their guardians as strained
as the below quote demonstrates:

I don’t have parents. My mum passed away. And most of these young people here
they don’t have like family and some of them might have a mum, but they don’t have
a dad. And they might struggle with the family, but most of them don’t talk about it.
(Participant 21)

Also, some youths ﬂed their countries of origin and lived for many years in refugee
camps in the countries of asylum. Some had to move from one country of asylum to
another in challenging circumstances as the following quote encapsulates.

All my parents and the other families stayed in South Sudan. So, we ﬁrst went to Uganda,
we stayed there for a couple of months, in the northern part of Uganda. At the time, it
wasn’t safe; there was no difference between Northern Uganda and South Sudan because
of the war in South Sudan and the Lord Resistance Army operating in Northern Uganda.
We stayed there for a couple of months, but every night was a nightmare. We moved
from Northern Uganda, and we went to Kenya, and we arrived in Kenya in 1995. So,
we stayed in the refugee camp from 1995 until 2003 when we ﬁnally came to Australia.
(Participant 14)

Similarly, respondents described the experiences of separations from families and
uncertainties related to not knowing whether their parents were alive or dead, factors
that had a lasting emotional impact and effects on their growth and resettlement in a new
country.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1534

Before I came to Australia, I didn’t know that I had a family. When I came to Australia,
people started calling me up and saying, ‘we are your parents’, and I just said, ‘oh my
God’. I didn’t know my family because during the war you don’t live with your parents.
(Participant 20)

Furthermore, as a result of frequent movements from one country of asylum to another,
and before arriving in Australia, African migrant youths reported to have lost important
opportunities, including educational disruption. Some youths noted that these disruptions
were a hindrance to continuing their education in Australia and were forced to grow up
early to meet social obligations including looking after younger relatives and marrying at a
young age. These experiences are illustrated in the following assertion:

Because of the war, I was in a camp. I started my education there from year three to year
12. When I came to Australia, I went to the factory, I work. I decided to marry, so I went
back home and proposed my wife to come to Australia. My wife came with three boys,
one is my nephew, and two are cousins. So, from there, I decided not to go back to school
because it has been a long time plus I have personal issues. (Participant 22)

3.3. Post-Migration Contexts and Realities

Upon resettlement in Australia, some participants experienced poverty, poor em-
ployment outcomes, unfamiliarity with the new environment, and complex systems and
challenges, including language and cultural barriers.

Coming to Australia was a sudden thing, like ‘oh you’re coming to this new place’. Like I
was young and so didn’t know how it was. (Participant 16)

I know a few people even now they don’t have Centrelink [social security assistance in
Australia] money and they don’t have an income. They just live with their parents, but
the parents are poor too, they don’t give them an income. They are looking for work, but
they can’t get a job, so they have to survive like that. (Participant 20)

As a result of disadvantages including poverty, low English proﬁciency and the
difﬁculties associated with growing up as a young person without parents, these youths
were desperate and found it difﬁcult to access job opportunities, ending up with poor
resettlement and health outcomes.

Young people in our community, they have no access to jobs—and because they don’t
have access to jobs, they ﬁnd something to keep themselves busy. Also, because we come
from Africa, some of us don’t know English. Some of us, they came here they don’t have
parents—their parents died—and they come when they are single . . . like the cause of all
the bad thing is because you don’t have a good quality of life, and if you don’t have a good
quality of life, you think you can do bad things. (Participant 5)

They’ll be like saying they’re looking for work, but they’re not going to get a job because
of their low level of skill. They can’t get a job, and they’ll be like ‘what can we do?’
(Participant 20)

Participants reported being anxious, bored, depressed, and perceived themselves as
having failed to improve their lives in their perceived land of opportunities, which they
reported led youths to antisocial and destructive behaviors, including substance use as a
coping mechanism. The following statements encapsulate these claims:

It goes back to the main problems like depression, anxiety, all these kinds of things. When
you start to experience those kinds of things, then you tend to put your problems into
alcohol to forget the problems. (Participant 14)

When they get depressed what I see a lot and is more common, is they tend to drink
alcohol a lot. They tend to drink and pretty much do things like maybe smoking weed and
all that stuff. (Participant 21)

3.4. Contextualising AOD Use and Mental Health

There was a common consensus among the participants that African migrant youths’
experiences of loneliness, the loss of informal social networks and family ties in addition
to their circumstances in Australia made them vulnerable to social peer pressure, which
seemed to facilitate AOD use. One participant observed, “sometimes peer group. Peer group is
one of them, I think. If you fall into the wrong group and the environment” (Participant 6). Other
participants also expressed a similar view.

When you have friends that take alcohol or other drugs, so you tend to follow so that
if you want to ﬁt into that friendship or that company, you have to do what they do.’
(Participant 15)

I have some of my friends here, they use drugs, they ask me . . . they give me—like
smoking or drinking. (Participant 13)

A common agreement among the participant was around the view that there are
high expectations on youths in their community, and they are expected to be respectful to
maintain their ‘reputation’. However, this high expectation sometimes led to a breakdown
of personal and social relationships with the broader community, an issue identiﬁed by
participants as perpetuating AOD use and mental health problems. Additionally, there
was a view among the participants that any ‘reputational damage’ in the community is
hard to mend, leading to youths feeling trapped and marginalized from their community.

If you become frustrated, maybe people don’t pay respect to you sometimes. You say there
is nothing to fear again because I already lost that reputation’. That’s the most important
thing in my community, is if you lose that reputation in the community it’s very hard to
get it back. (Participant 15)

Similarly, respondents noted that the breakdown of intimate relationships inﬂuenced

substance use among youths, a view demonstrated by the following statement.

They come to drug and drinking alcohol because sometimes their relationships break up.
They start smoking, and they start drinking, and they start using drugs. And they think
doing these things can help them. (Participant 13)

Complex and conﬂicting cultural and contextual interplays between the Australian
and African communities encouraged the use of AOD among African migrant youths in
Australia. Unlike in Africa, the Australian society did not prohibit excessive alcohol use, a
freedom which participants revealed African migrant youths preferred but created tensions
with parents. The lack of social consequences in Australia and access to government
ﬁnancial safety nets encouraged the use of alcohol, as illustrated here.

Well because it’s a new environment whereby if you have the money you can buy whatever
you have and there’s the freedom—so the parents are going to advise their kids, but they
do not listen to their parents. (Participant 3)

There is alcohol in Africa, but there’s a way if you’re going to drink alcohol—and you
know there’s no Centrelink—if you’re going to drink alcohol you’re going to die because
you’re not going to have any other help. (Participant 7)

Participants noted the negative impacts of AOD use on physical, psychological, and
social health, with risky alcohol consumption both arising from and perpetuating stressors
related to acculturation amongst African youths. The following statement demonstrates
this sentiment among participants.

Well, I think alcohol is a health issue because a lot of young people are drinking alcohol.
The way I see it, drinking is not the problem, but it’s the amount of alcohol they drink
at one time is the problem because if you drink too much, then it becomes heavy on you.
(Participant 14)

There was acknowledgement among participants that AOD use leads to antisocial
behavior and poor decision making. Participants identiﬁed poor decision making typi-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1534

cally presenting as violence and inappropriate sexual behaviors, and young youths are
being vulnerable to offences committed by older youths within their social group when
intoxicated.

Underage drinking has become a problem because a lot of young boys, a lot of young girls
under the age of 18 are drinking heavily. And as a result of that, they end up doing a lot
of silly things like sexual offences. So they expose themselves into sex earlier because of
alcohol and drugs. Young people, as young as 15 and 16, you know, just because they
drink and take drugs too they become vulnerable to older people that hang out with them.
(Participant 14)

Several participants also elaborated on this sentiment with one respondent suggesting
that a loss of control with intoxication represented a manifestation of the inability to control
turbulent internal emotions. The result of this was violence and arguments with others.

I think that [alcohol] is dangerous. It leads to a lot of disasters because it makes—teenagers
especially when they have alcohol they lose control, they don’t know how to handle that
or control their emotions and stuff like that. They start arguing, they start ﬁghting and
stuff like that, so I think it’s a big problem for teenagers. (Participant 8)

Participants recognized alcohol as an accomplice to suicide, although they did not
clarify the precise role that alcohol plays in suicide ideation, attempts, or completion.
Respondents observed that alcohol consumption precipitates suicide ideation in youths
with underlying psychological problems as the following comment demonstrates.

If their mind is not working, like sometimes if you take alcohol, you know that cause
actually somebody to commit suicide. (Participant 6)

You know mostly these young kids, they tend to drink and with other people making
troubles. They drink, and then they try to kill each other and make themselves suicide
because of those factors. (Participant 5)

4. Discussion

This study explored the perspectives of African migrant youths in Australia about
AOD use and mental health issues. Acculturative stress model provided the framework to
understand these issues in migrant youths because of scarce internal and external coping
resources available to them when adjusting to life in Australia [27]. Upon numerous
challenges that face the youths in the current study, participants were negotiating not
only the transition to a new culture but also that of meeting the expectations of their
community. It has to be understood that, as a result of losses including of parents, some
participants with refugee backgrounds arrived in Australia as unaccompanied minors, had
extended stays in refugee camps with unmet basic nutritional, educational, or recreational
needs, contributing to a poor start of new life in Australia. A combination of social and
peer pressure, vulnerability, and complexities of their social deprivation could inﬂuence
substance use, ultimately leading to poor social and health outcomes [28].

An important aspect of the acculturative stress model is how stressors experienced
because of a lack of internal and external coping resources during acculturation contribute
to stresses [27]. While the paper emphasizes the role of acculturative stress, it is important
to acknowledge that there are also other factors that could contribute to AOD use and
mental health issues among the participants. For example, pre-migration experiences such
as traumas of past lives and losses could contribute to mental health issues among youths
and the use of AOD as coping mechanisms. The current study shows that participants
experienced loss, separation from families and friends, and uncertainties for their future
before and after migration. For example, settlement issues such as lack of employment
and underemployment could be additional factors that would lead to AOD use. There are
views from the data which suggest that such experiences resulted into extreme stresses,
which supports previous evidence that young people with refugee backgrounds expe-
rience extreme challenges predisposing them to a wide range of poor health and social

outcomes [29]. Participants in this study revealed being trapped in vicious cycles of so-
cial disadvantages and socioeconomic situations that affect individuals’ health outcomes,
particularly mental health [30]. The data from this study show that unemployment was
a common issue facing African migrants youths in Australia, which contribute to their
impoverishment and marginalization, often in a state of poor physical and mental health,
leading to them using AOD as a coping mechanism. These ﬁndings support the link
between a lack of employment opportunities and poverty as signiﬁcant determinants of
health [31].

Additionally, missed opportunities and the lack of education due to circumstances
described elsewhere in this paper meant that African migrant youths felt excluded and
at times discriminated against, for example, when accessing social security support. Dis-
crimination is a known stressor and social determinants of health which hampers the
socioeconomic opportunities and has implications for AOD use, poor social outcomes, and
mental health [32,33]. Moreover, participants in the current study also revealed living in
poverty and experiencing other deprivations. These complex experiences, coupled with
AOD use and past trauma could shape the way individuals experience mental health issues
in this population group [10]. Alternatively, the poor socioeconomic, harsh environment,
and other disadvantages and mental health issues experienced by participants in this
study because of past trauma could contribute to this population group having a unique
experience of AOD use [34,35].

Consistent with other studies that have demonstrated the inﬂuence of alcohol on
antisocial, disruptive behaviors [36], and poor health among young people [35], the views
expressed by participants in this study suggest that AOD use may contribute to many
social, emotional, and behavioral problems among African migrant youths. Participants in
the current study revealed that the use of alcohol could contribute to risky behaviors and
overall vulnerability of youths. Additionally, the participants in this study acknowledged
that many migrant youths use alcohol regularly, and this is concerning because the early
onset of alcohol use can contribute to alcohol-related behavioral problems later in adoles-
cence or adulthood [37,38]. Earlier research found that people who began drinking before
age 15 were four-fold more likely to develop alcohol dependence during their lifetime than
were people who started drinking after 21 years old [39].

In Australia, drinking alcohol is a common characteristic of social life among youths
and perceived as a pleasant social norm [40]. For African youths in Australia, it is rea-
sonable to argue that drinking is part of assimilation and acculturation processes [41].
Young people adopting to AOD use can be perceived as embracing the norms in their new
society [28]. It is also likely that alcohol use among African migrant youths is rising because
of conﬂicting attitudes between African and Australian cultures regarding their use. In
Africa, alcohol use by youths is restricted and often carry severe consequences, whereas it
is socially accepted in Australia [40]. Previous studies have supported the assimilation and
acculturation process as facilitators shaping the behaviors of migrants [28,42].

To this end, it is worth acknowledging that African youths are resilient but also
vulnerable because of the social settings and circumstances in which they live. The results
in the current study seem to justify the need for broader social determinants of health
approach and provide opportunities for service providers to work with youths in this
population to improve AOD and mental health services. These youths can be empowered
by service providers through targeted initiatives to become ambassadors and agents of
change in their communities. The information from this study has inﬂuenced youth-speciﬁc
preventive mental health interventions and programs run by the African Communities
Council of South Australia.

Limitations and Strengths

One limitation worth noting is that the data were collected eight years ago. However,
the data are still relevant because similar issues exist in our community. As such, the need
to advocate for programs and policy on AOD use and mental health issue for migrant

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1534

youths in this community persists. The paper has the potential to contribute to the scant
body of literature on AOD use and mental health issue among African migrant youths in
Australia. A lot of the views expressed by participants in the current study were about
their peers and provided essential insights into AOD use and mental health issue in this
population. Another limitation was the use of English language in conducting focus group
discussions and interviews, although only participants with conversational English were
enrolled. Therefore, this limits the transferability of the ﬁndings to youths who do not
speak English as they may have different experiences or barriers that need to be addressed.
Participants of this study were recruited from metropolitan Adelaide and might have
missed African youths living outside of Adelaide. However, the use of an African youth
worker to engage participants in the study was a strength, facilitating capacity building in
the community. Additionally, the strength of the evidence provided by the ﬁndings of this
study outweighs its limitations and thence adding to the body of knowledge. Moreover,
the researchers’ knowledge and lived experiences of the African culture and context in
Australia has shaped the data analysis and interpretations by focusing on pertinent issues
that require attention to support African migrant youths in Australia.

5. Conclusions

African migrant youths in Australia revealed signiﬁcant challenges and barriers which
were rooted in their pre-and and post-migration contexts. As a result of needing to adapt
to their new society, there was a consensus among the study participants that African
migrant youths were conﬂicted, and their effort to ﬁt in led to adverse outcomes, including
AOD use and mental health issue. The ﬁndings of this study are important and provide
some insight into the contexts in which AOD use and mental health issue occur among
African youths in Australia. Recognizing these contexts calls for interventions that address
the underlying social determinants of health among African migrant youths in Australia.
Addressing these socio-environmental factors that foster distress including employment
opportunities and culturally unsafe service provision is necessary in order to provide
effective and supportive services for these population groups and improve their mental
health and wellbeing.
