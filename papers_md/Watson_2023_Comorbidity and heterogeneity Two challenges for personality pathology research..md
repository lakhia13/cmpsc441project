Comorbidity and Heterogeneity: Two Challenges for Personality 
Pathology Research

Abstract

We critique the general state of methodological rigor in contemporary personality pathology 
research, focusing on challenges in study design, assessment, and data analysis resulting from two 
pervasive problems: comorbidity and heterogeneity. To inform our understanding of this literature, 
we examined every article published in the two main specialty journals for personality pathology 
research—Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment and the Journal of Personality 
Disorders—in the 18-month period from January 2020 through June 2021 (a total of 23 issues 
and 197 articles). Our review of this database indicated that only three forms of personality 
pathology have generated substantial attention in the recent literature: borderline personality 
disorder (featured in 93 articles), psychopathy/antisocial personality disorder (39 articles), and 
narcissism/narcissistic personality disorder (28 articles), so we highlight them in our review. We 
discuss comorbidity-related problems that arise from group-based designs and recommend instead 
that researchers assess multiple forms of psychopathology as continuous dimensions. We offer 
separate recommendations for addressing heterogeneity in diagnosis-versus trait-based studies. For 
the former, we recommend that researchers (1) use measures that permit criterion-level analyses 
and (2) routinely report criterion-level results. For the latter, we emphasize the importance of 
examining specific traits when measures are known to be highly heterogeneous/multidimensional. 
Finally, we encourage researchers to work toward a truly comprehensive trait dimensional model 
of personality pathology. We suggest that this might include expanding the current Alternative 
Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD) to include additional content related to borderline 
features, psychopathy, and narcissism.

This paper critiques the general state of methodological rigor in contemporary research on 
personality pathology. We focus primarily on issues involving disorder comorbidity and 
heterogeneity, which present formidable challenges related to study design, assessment,

article published in the two main specialty journals for personality pathology research
—Personality Disorders: Theory, Research and Treatment (PD:TRT) and the Journal of 
Personality Disorders (JPD)—in the 18-month period from January 2020 through June 2021, 
encompassing, respectively, 9 and 14 issues (including 5 supplements). Although we draw 
on the larger published literature as needed, these 23 recent issues constitute our review’s 
primary database. This database contains a total of 197 articles (72 from PD:TRT, 125 from 
JPD).

Our examination of this database revealed a complex literature that has been shaped by 
the publication of the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental 
Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which dramatically altered 
the nature and scope of research on personality pathology. Our review confirmed that 
a substantial portion of published research continues to study the traditional categorical 
diagnoses that now are described in Section II of DSM-5, a point we develop in greater 
detail shortly. At the same time, however, a rapidly growing body of evidence focuses 
instead on the dimensional trait model—widely known as the Alternative Model of 
Personality Disorders (AMPD)—in Section III of DSM-5. For example, 26 articles in our 
database (13.2% of the total) presented results based on some form of the Personality 
Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5; Krueger et al., 2012), which assesses the trait component of 
the AMPD. Finally, several studies have sought to explicate the nature of the associations 
between the Section II diagnoses and the AMPD.

In a review of studies published between 1966 and 1995, Blashfield and Intoccia (2000) 
found that most individual personality disorders had generated surprisingly small literatures. 
A review of our database indicated that this situation has not changed significantly over the 
past 2 decades. To quantify this observation, we examined every article in our database and 
coded whether or not a given condition was featured within it. We coded a condition as 
featured if it was one of a select set of disorders examined in that article (as opposed to 
reporting results for all Section II diagnoses). For example, Buer Christensen et al. (2020) 
presented results for four Section II diagnoses; all four were coded as featured in this study.

Our examination revealed that only three forms of personality disorder (PD) have generated 
substantial research attention in the recent literature: borderline PD (BPD; featured in 
93 articles), psychopathy/antisocial PD (ASPD; featured in 39 articles), and narcissism/
narcissistic PD (NPD; featured in 28 articles). We therefore focus primarily on these three 
disorders in the review that follows.

In contrast, all remaining disorders were sparsely represented in our database. Only five 
studies featured some type of Cluster A condition (e.g., schizotypy, schizotypal PD). Four 
articles focused on obsessive-compulsive PD, three on avoidant PD, two on dependent 
PD, and one apiece on histrionic PD and Cluster C disorders. In some cases, much of 
the relevant research likely is reported elsewhere; for example, studies focusing on Cluster 
A pathology often are published in journals specializing in schizophrenia spectrum and 
psychotic disorders. In other cases, these results suggest that certain conditions simply have 
failed to spark much research interest. For instance, our findings extend those of Blashfield

and Intoccia (2000; see their Figure 1) by demonstrating that histrionic PD continues to be 
largely ignored in the published literature.

Comorbidity

We were trained in the scientific tradition of Meehl and Lykken, who emphasized 
that “everything is related to everything else” (Lykken, 1968, p. 154). The enormous 
literature on comorbidity bears witness to the wisdom of this statement. Comorbidity 
is the term most commonly used to indicate the co-occurrence of different disorders 
beyond chance. It is a pervasive problem in psychopathology research, such that different 
forms of maladjustment tend to co-occur in individuals (e.g., Kotov et al., 2021; Watson, 
Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022). Because of this co-occurrence, virtually all indicators of 
psychological dysfunction—including diagnoses, symptoms, and maladaptive traits—are 
positively correlated with one another, giving rise to a general factor (often referred to as the 
“p factor”) of psychopathology (Caspi et al., 2014). Comorbidity creates serious challenges 
for psychopathology research, as it leads to a situation in which many variables of interest 
are non-specifically related to multiple types of psychological problems. For instance, 
many forms of psychopathology are related to personality traits such as neuroticism and 
antagonism/low agreeableness, and most types of maladjustment have been linked to 
childhood maltreatment and cognitive difficulties (Kotov et al., 2010, 2021; Watson, Levin-
Aspenson et al., 2022).

Comorbidity in BPD

Similar to other forms of maladjustment, indicators of personality pathology tend to 
correlate positively with one another, consequently creating substantial comorbidity. We 
illustrate this problem in the specific context of BPD, the most widely studied disorder in 
our database. Table 1 presents comorbidity data from four studies in this database that all 
investigated relatively large samples of individuals diagnosed with BPD, jointly representing 
a total of 1,685 BPD cases. To their credit, these authors reported extensive evidence 
related to comorbidity, which is not always the case. The table is not exhaustive and only 
summarizes major sources of comorbidity (defined as a prevalence rate ≥ 30% in at least one 
sample).

Table 1 clearly establishes that most individuals diagnosed with BPD also met criteria for 
multiple other conditions, including mood disorders (weighted mean = 60.2% for major 
depressive disorder [MDD]), anxiety disorders (weighted mean = 52.3% for any anxiety 
disorder), substance use disorders (weighted mean = 47.0%), posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD, weighted mean = 37.7%), eating disorders (weighted mean = 34.3%), and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; weighted mean = 33.4%). BPD also is strongly 
comorbid with other forms of personality pathology (e.g., Mneimne et al., 2021; Southward 
& Cheavens, 2020; see also Table 2). In the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol 
and Related Conditions (NESARC), the odds ratio for another PD in those with BPD was 
15.9, the highest among all disorder groups reported (Tomko et al., 2014). The implications 
of these data are clear: When one studies those diagnosed with BPD, one actually is

examining individuals who are reporting serious problems across a much broader range of 
psychopathology.

Viewed in this context, many studies in our database used relatively weak and uninformative 
designs that cannot yield any clear conclusions about BPD, because it is impossible to know 
whether the reported findings actually have some specificity to BPD or are more broadly 
and nonspecifically characteristic of psychopathology. For example, studies recently have 
reported that BPD features are related to maladaptive parenting (Brumariu et al., 2020), 
emotional dysregulation (Haliczer et al., 2020), rumination (Napolitano et al., 2020), and 
dysphoric mood (Harpøth et al., 2021). Without also assessing and analyzing other forms of 
psychopathology, one cannot assert that these findings tell us anything about BPD per se.

Fourteen studies in our database compared individuals with BPD to non-clinical controls. 
For instance, in comparison to healthy controls, studies have found that individuals with 
BPD report higher levels of shame (Buchman-Wildbaum et al., 2021), alexithymia (Edwards 
et al., 2021) neuroticism (Zanarini et al., 2020), and aggression and impulsivity (Cardona 
et al., 2021), as well as lower levels of extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness 
(Zanarini et al., 2020). A review of the broader literature establishes that most of these 
variables are broadly and nonspecifically related to psychopathology (e.g., Kotov et al., 
2010, 2021; Watson, Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022). Consequently, these comparisons with 
non-clinical controls are largely uninformative and tell us virtually nothing about BPD as a 
specific condition.

Of course, many researchers are aware of this problem and are careful to assess multiple 
forms of psychopathology in their studies. Often, however, they still employ suboptimal 
designs that fail to address the comorbidity problem adequately. Fifteen articles in our 
database compared individuals with BPD to some type of clinical control group (and often 
a non-clinical control group as well). Table 2 presents data from seven studies that (1) 
compared individuals with BPD to those with other disorders and (2) reported extensive 
comorbidity information in the BPD group. The control conditions involved a range of 
disorders, including MDD (Herr & Meier, 2021; Southward & Cheavens, 2020), generalized 
anxiety disorder (GAD; Fitzpatrick et al., 2020), and mixed anxiety/depression (Daros et al., 
2020).

It is noteworthy that these studies’ groups were named and characterized by their inclusion 
criterion. For example, the clinical-control participants in both Herr and Meier (2021) and 
Southward and Cheavens (2020) all received MDD diagnoses; hence, the authors labeled 
them the “MDD group.” Similarly, the clinical-control participants in Fitzpatrick et al. 
(2020) all were diagnosed with GAD, so they were referred to as the “GAD group.” 
Although this terminology makes sense at one level, it fosters the misleading impression that 
the reported analyses are comparing one clinical condition to another, thereby at least partly 
addressing the problem of nonspecificity. But forming groups in this way is undermined 
by the problem of comorbidity. For instance, of the 30 individuals in the MDD group in 
Southward and Cheavens (2020), 20 (66.7%) also had comorbid GAD, 11 (36.7%) had 
dysthymia, 8 (26.7%) had social anxiety disorder (SAD) and avoidant PD, and 7 (23.3%) 
had PTSD.

Comorbidity was an even greater problem in the BPD groups. Table 2 summarizes the major 
forms of comorbidity (defined here as a prevalence rate ≥ 30%) within the BPD group in 
each of the seven studies. Consistent with the findings of Table 1, we see high levels of 
comorbid MDD, dysthymia, GAD, PTSD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), substance 
use disorder, and various forms of personality pathology. It is particularly striking that BPD 
patients were allowed to have the same disorder that was used to define the clinical control 
group. Thus, 40% of the BPD individuals in Fitzpatrick et al. (2020) had comorbid GAD, 
whereas 39.1% and 40% of the BPD participants had comorbid MDD in Herr and Meier 
(2021) and Southward and Cheavens (2020), respectively. This was intentional—indeed, 
necessitated—by the rampant comorbidity that typically is found in BPD. For instance, 
Fitzpatrick et al. (2020) stated: “To retain some external validity, individuals in the BPD 
group were not excluded if they had comorbid GAD” (p. 442). Similarly, Herr and Meier 
noted: “Given the high comorbidity of BPD and other disorders…we opted to include 
individuals in the BPD group who had comorbid diagnoses” (p. 154).

Thus, these studies really compare (1) individuals with multiple diagnoses that do not 
include BPD (although most authors did allow subclinical manifestations of BPD in their 
clinical control groups) to (2) those with multiple diagnoses who also happen to have 
BPD. In other words, the comparison essentially involves whether or not BPD is included 
as one of many comorbid diagnoses. In light of the enormous comorbidity in these BPD 
groups—and given that comorbidity is strongly linked to the severity of dysfunction (e.g., 
Clark et al., 1995; Kessler et al., 1994, 2005)—any group-based effects may primarily 
reflect quantitative differences in severity, rather than BPD per se, thereby undermining any 
BPD-specific interpretation.

Other considerations

Comorbidity problems are not restricted to BPD diagnoses: Self-report measures of BPD 
features also show substantial evidence of nonspecificity. Seventeen studies in our database 
used one or more subscales of the Borderline Features (BOR) scale from the Personality 
Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 2007) to assess borderline PD characteristics (e.g., 
Dixon-Gordon & Laws, 2021; Haliczer et al., 2020; Herr & Meier, 2021; Napolitano et 
all, 2020; Southward & Cheavens, 2020). Morey (2007) reports PAI scale correlations in 
two large samples (see Table 10.1). BOR had correlations ≥ .60 with several other PAI 
scales—including Aggression, Anxiety, Anxiety-Related Disorders, Depression, Paranoia, 
Schizophrenia, and Stress—in both samples. In addition, studies in our database reported 
that the PAI-BOR scale correlated .66 (Zalewski et al., 2020) and .69 (Dixon-Gordon 
& Laws, 2021) with depressive symptoms, and .60 with an indicator of internalizing 
psychopathology (Kerr et al., 2021).

More generally, the problem extends far beyond BPD: Most measures of personality 
pathology—both self-report and interview-based—demonstrate substantial evidence of 
nonspecificity. For example, as we highlight in a later section, many indicators of 
psychopathy and narcissism correlate strongly with one another (e.g., Somma et al., 2020; 
Weiss et al., 2021).

Recommendations for Future Research

Many diagnosis-based articles in our database did not present any comorbidity data. 
Moreover, those that did report relevant evidence varied widely in the nature and scope 
of their coverage. Comorbidity data should be routinely reported in diagnosis-based studies, 
either in the main article or in supplemental materials. Ideally, reporting such data would be 
a requirement for publication and these data would include all major forms of comorbidity 
that have been identified in previous research, which admittedly would be a challenge for 
highly comorbid disorders such as BPD (as shown in Tables 1 and 2). On the other hand, the 
field would reap considerable benefit from the routine reporting of comorbidity data, not the 
least of which would be to make this critically important problem more salient to authors, 
reviewers, and editors.

Further, one cannot solve the problem of comorbidity by creating “pure” groups with no 
comorbid conditions (which may not even be possible to do in many instances), because 
the resulting samples would not be fully representative of the target condition; most notably, 
the level of dysfunction would be attenuated due to the exclusion of comorbid cases. A 
better strategy is to assess multiple forms of psychopathology as continuous dimensions, 
because broadening the scope of assessment permits one to draw stronger inferences about 
the nature of observed effects. For instance, if one assesses all 10 Section II PDs, one can 
examine whether a given variable correlates more strongly with one—or a few—of them 
than with the others. Including additional non-PD indicators would permit stronger, more 
general conclusions about the specificity of these relations.

We illustrate this type of dimensional approach using data from the Improving the 
Measurement of Personality Project (IMPP), which consists of 300 high-risk community 
(HRC) adults and 300 psychiatric outpatients. Adults in the HRC subsample were screened 
to ensure that they (1) were not currently in mental health treatment and (2) scored ≥ 2 on 
the Iowa Personality Disorder Screen (Langbehn et al., 1999). The outpatients were referred 
primarily from a community mental health center and local practitioners. The study was 
approved by the local University Institutional Review Board (IRB).

Participants were assessed on the indicators of diagnostic Criterion A for all 10 Section 
II PDs using the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV; Pfohl, Blum, 
& Zimmerman, 1997), which assesses the DSM-IV PDs (and thereby also the DSM-5 
Section II PDs) (APA, 2000, 2013). Interviewers rated each PD’s Criterion A indicator 
on a 4-point scale: 0 = no or minimal evidence, 1 = below threshold, 2 = at or above 
threshold, and 3 = prominent feature. We used these ratings to create two scores for each 
PD: (1) a dichotomous diagnosis (0 = diagnosis absent, 1 = diagnosis present; ratings ≥ 2 
on the requisite number of criteria) (2) an overall continuous score for each PD, created 
by summing their Criterion A ratings (e.g., scores could range from 0–21 for ASPD and 
from 0–27 for BPD). For illustrative purposes, we focus here on results for BPD, NPD, 
and ASPD; parallel findings for the other Section II diagnoses are reported in Supplemental 
Table 1.

Participants also completed the PID-5 (Krueger et al., 2012). To eliminate distributional 
differences between the outpatients and HRC adults—which could distort correlational

analyses—we standardized PID-5 scores on a within-subsample basis (M = 0, 
STD = 1) and then analyzed the combined sample data. Next, we averaged three 
facet scales to create each of five domain scores as currently recommended in 
DSM-5: Negative Affectivity (Anxiousness, Emotional Lability, Separation Insecurity), 
Detachment (Withdrawal, Anhedonia, Intimacy Avoidance), Antagonism (Manipulativeness, 
Deceitfulness, Grandiosity), Disinhibition (Impulsivity, Irresponsibility, Distractibility), and 
Psychoticism (Eccentricity, Cognitive and Perceptual Dysregulation, Unusual Beliefs and 
Experiences). Correlations between the PID-5 domains and the diagnostic scores for BPD, 
ASPD, and NPD are presented in the top portion of each subsection in Table 3. As would 
be expected based on previous research (e.g., Markon et al., 2011), the continuous scores 
consistently produced stronger associations than the dichotomous diagnoses, so we focus on 
them here.

These data demonstrate considerable specificity in these trait-disorder relations. We 
quantified cross-disorder differences by conducting significance tests, using the Williams 
modification of the Hotelling test for two correlations involving a common variable (Kenny, 
1987). These analyses revealed that Negative Affectivity (r = .52), Psychoticism (r = .51), 
Disinhibition (r = .50) and Detachment (r = .37) all correlated significantly more strongly 
(p < .05, 2-tailed) with BPD than with either ASPD (r range = .14 to .43, z range = 2.37 
to 10.09) or NPD (r range = .07 to .31, z range = 5.21 to 10.30); in addition, Disinhibition 
correlated more strongly with ASPD (r = .43) than with NPD (r = .23; z = 5.17). In contrast, 
Antagonism correlated significantly more strongly with NPD (r = .43) and ASPD (r = .37) 
than with BPD (r = 22; z = 5.37 and 4.39, respectively), whereas its correlations with NPD 
and ASPD did not differ significantly from one another (z = 1.55, n.s.).

Next, we conducted a series of multiple regression analyses to examine the unique predictive 
power of each PD score after controlling for its shared variance with the others (see 
Supplemental Table S2). BPD was a significant positive predictor of every PID-5 domain 
except for Antagonism. ASPD had a significant positive association with Antagonism and 
Disinhibition, whereas NPD was positively related to Antagonism and Psychoticism. Finally, 
two suppressor effects (Watson et al., 2013) emerged in these analyses: ASPD had a negative 
association with Negative Affectivity, whereas NPD was negatively related to Detachment.1 
As this example illustrates, a design based on the use of multiple continuous measures is 
effective in establishing specific associations with indicators of personality pathology, and 
thus yields stronger inferences than can be drawn from group-based analyses.

Heterogeneity

Diagnostic Heterogeneity

General considerations.—Many DSM diagnoses are highly heterogeneous and 
encompass a diverse array of characteristics (e.g., Biskin & Paris, 2012; Clark et al., 1995; 
Watson, 2003; Watson et al., 2016; Watson, Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022). For example, 

1Schizoid PD (r = .48) and avoidant PD (r = .46) actually had the strongest associations with Detachment (see Supplemental Table 
S1). When they were included as additional predictors, schizoid PD (β = .36), avoidant PD (β = .27), and BPD (β = .25) all were 
significant predictors.

BPD criterion A includes characteristics such as unstable interpersonal relationships, 
identity disturbance, impulsivity, affective instability, and paranoid ideation. The problem 
of heterogeneity is exacerbated by the use of polythetic diagnoses to assess the Section II 
PDs in DSM-5 (i.e., requiring only X of Y criteria2 for a disorder diagnosis). Consequently, 
patients with the same Section II diagnosis may have few overlapping symptoms. For 
instance, 57, 50, and 30 individuals in the IMPP sample were diagnosed with BPD, ASPD, 
and NPD, respectively. Of those with BPD, 40.4% met the minimum required five (of nine) 
criteria and another 36.8% met six. Similarly, of those with NPD, 43.3% met exactly five 
(of nine) criteria and another 26.7% met six; of those with ASPD, 44.0% met only three 
criteria (of seven) and another 32.0% met four. Moreover, using BPD as an example, of the 
256 different ways that criterion A could be met, the 57 individuals with BPD manifested 
45 different sets, 38 of which were each manifested by a single individual. To be sure, in 
some cases, two individuals manifested the same or highly similar patterns, but in others, 
they shared only two of the nine manifestations. (See Supplemental Figure 1 for the PID-5 
profiles of two such individuals.) Thus, individuals with the same Section II diagnosis can 
present with very different problems.

Over the years, we have expressed considerable skepticism about the value of examining 
these heterogeneous disorders in personality pathology research (e.g., Clark, 2007; Watson, 
2003; Watson et al., 2016; Watson, Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022). Nevertheless, these 
categorical diagnoses continue to be widely studied in the contemporary literature (see, for 
example, Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, we offer two related recommendations for enhancing 
the value of future Section II-based research. First, we recommend that researchers use 
measures—such as the SIDP-IV—that permit analyses at the criterion level. Second, we 
strongly encourage researchers to report criterion-level results, either in the main article 
or in supplemental materials. In some instances, criterion-level findings will not prove 
to be particularly interesting. In other cases, however, they will demonstrate evidence of 
specificity across the individual criteria, thereby explicating the true nature of the effects. 
The routine reporting of criterion-level results eventually will have a cumulative effect that 
will clarify our understanding of personality pathology.

Illustrative data.—We now use data from our IMPP sample to illustrate the potential value 
of a criterion-based approach. Table 3 reports associations between the PID-5 domains 
and the diagnostic criteria for BPD, ASPD, and NPD (parallel findings for the other 
Section II diagnoses are presented in Supplemental Table 1). Some associations show little 
evidence of specificity (e.g., the correlations between the individual ASPD criteria and 
PID-5 Detachment range from only .04 to .14), but other associations are more interesting. 
For example, PID-5 Detachment has correlations with the individual BPD criteria ranging 
from .10 to .42; note, moreover, that it correlates as strongly with BPD criterion 7 (chronic 
feelings of emptiness; r = .42) as it does with the summed total score (r = .37). Similarly, 
PID-5 Antagonism has correlations with individual ASPD criteria ranging from .18 to .42; 
it correlates as strongly with criterion 2 (deceitfulness; r = .42) as it does with the overall 
summed score (r = .37). Antagonism also correlates as strongly with NPD criterion 6 (is 

2Strictly speaking, what are typically termed PD “criteria” are actually potential manifestations of Criterion A for each respective PD. 
However, to avoid confusion, we use the more common term “criteria” here.

interpersonally exploitative; r = .45) as it does with the overall summed score (r = .43). 
These results demonstrate that some diagnosis-level associations are being driven by a small 
number of criteria.

One limitation of this approach is that it is based on single items, which have suboptimal 
psychometric properties (e.g., poor reliability). It obviously would be preferable to use 
multi-item scales, but interview-based measures of this type are not available for most 
Section II criteria3. That said, however, it is important to reiterate that some individual 
diagnostic criteria showed relatively strong associations in Table 3. Moreover, personality 
nuances—which are narrower than facets and typically are assessed by single items—have 
displayed impressive predictive power in previous research (e.g., Mõttus et al., 2017, 2019).

Psychometric Heterogeneity

PAI-BOR.—As with comorbidity, the problem of heterogeneity is not limited to DSM 
diagnostic criteria. Many dimensionally focused measures of personality pathology also 
subsume a diverse set of characteristics. Of the 17 studies in our database that used the 
PAI-BOR, 10 (58.8%) only reported results for the overall scale score. However, this scale 
contains four subscales—Affective Instability, Identity Problems, Negative Relationships, 
and Self-Harm—that were designed to capture the heterogeneous nature of borderline PD 
characteristics (Morey, 2007). Scores on these subscales tend to be moderately to strongly 
related, with correlations typically in the .40 to .70 range (Morey, 2007; Reynolds et 
al., 2021). Nevertheless, they do show some evidence of specificity. For example, Morey 
(2007; see Table 10.2) reports correlations between the PAI-BOR and Depression subscales 
that range from .25 to .67 across two samples. We therefore recommend that researchers 
routinely report subscale-based results when using the PAI-BOR.

Psychopathy and narcissism.—Researchers in our database used a wide variety of 
self-report psychopathy instruments, including various stand-alone measures, such as the 
Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (Levenson et al., 1995; see, for example, Kavish et 
al., 2021; Shou et al., 2021). Studies also have used psychopathy instruments that are linked 
to specific models of personality pathology, such as the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure 
(TriPM; Patrick, 2010) and the Short Dark Triad (SD3; Jones & Paulhus, 2014).

We highlight two popular psychopathy measures that were represented in our database. First, 
as its name suggests, the TriPM assesses three traits that are posited to be components of 
psychopathy: Boldness, Disinhibition, and Meanness. In a recent meta-analysis, Sleep et 
al. (2019) reported that TriPM Disinhibition and Meanness were strongly related to one 
another (r = .53). However, TriPM Boldness was only weakly related to the other two scales 
(with Meanness, r = .16; with Disinhibition, r = −.05). Thus, the TriPM scales clearly show 
substantial heterogeneity.

Second, the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment (EPA; Lynam et al., 2011) contains 178 
items and 18 scales. The subsequent Short Form (EPA-SF; Lynam et al., 2013) includes 

3With regard to self-report measures, the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (Clark, 2014) uses multiple items to 
diagnose almost all of the DSM-5-II PD criteria.

18 4-item scales that yield four higher order factors: Antagonism, Emotional Stability, 
Narcissism, and Disinhibition. A more recent Super-Short Form (EPA-SSF; Collison et al., 
2016) contains 18 items that define three factors: Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Emotional 
Stability. All versions of the EPA display substantial heterogeneity. For example, Vize et 
al. (2020) report correlations among the EPA-SF factors that range from −.24 (Emotional 
Stability vs. Disinhibition) to .44 (Antagonism vs. Disinhibition). Sleep et al. (2021) present 
correlations among the EPA-SSF factors ranging from −.11 (Antagonism vs. Emotional 
Stability) to .52 (Antagonism vs. Disinhibition) in Sample 1, and from .08 (Disinhibition 
vs. Emotional Stability) to .28 (Antagonism vs. Disinhibition) in Sample 2. Note that 
the negative correlations with Emotional Stability are not a matter of the scale’s keying 
direction. That is, those high in psychopathy are thought to be low in neuroticism.

The studies in our database also used a variety of self-report measures to assess 
narcissism, including the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin & Terry, 1988), 
the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI; Pincus et al., 2009), the Short Form of the 
Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI-SF; Sherman et al. (2015), and the SD3 Narcissism 
scale (Jones & Paulhus, 2014). The literature in this area is complicated by the fact that 
some scales assess the grandiose form of narcissism, whereas others focus on vulnerable 
narcissism. Grandiose narcissism subsumes such characteristics as arrogance, entitlement, 
exhibitionism, aggression, and inflated self-esteem, whereas vulnerable narcissism is 
associated with mistrust, low self-esteem, and negative affectivity (e.g., Krizan & Herlache, 
2018; Miller et al., 2017, 2021). In terms of basic personality traits, grandiose narcissism 
is substantially related to the agentic aspect of extraversion, whereas vulnerable narcissism 
is strongly positively associated with neuroticism. In addition, both forms of narcissism 
contain a strong component of antagonism (Miller et al., 2017, 2021).

Given these distinctive characteristics, it is hardly surprising that narcissism measures 
display substantial heterogeneity. For instance, the FFNI-SF was designed to assess both the 
grandiose and vulnerable forms of narcissism. Its 15 scales have been shown to define three 
higher order factors: Antagonism, Agentic Extraversion and Neuroticism (Kaufman et al., 
2020; Vize et al., 2020, 2021). Several studies in our database have reported that FFNI-SF 
Antagonism and Agentic Extraversion are moderately to strongly positively correlated with 
each other; coefficients ranged from .28 to .62, with a median value of .51 (Kaufman et al., 
2020, Studies 1 and 2; Somma et al., 2020; Vize et al., 2020, 2021). However, FFNI-SF 
Neuroticism is weakly related to both Antagonism (rs ranged from −.14 to .14, median r 
= .10) and Agentic Extraversion (rs ranged from −.12 to .07, median r = −.07). Moreover, 
these FFNI-SF factors correlate very differently with other variables. For instance, Kaufman 
et al. (2020, Study 2) found that FFNI-SF Agentic Extraversion was much more strongly 
related to PNI Grandiosity (r = .70) than to PNI Vulnerability (r = .27), whereas the 
opposite was true for FFNI-SF Neuroticism (rs = .29 and 64, respectively). As expected, 
FFNI-SF Antagonism was strongly associated with both PNI factors (rs = .60 and .65, 
respectively). These FFNI-SF factors also showed very different associations with indicators 
of self-esteem, authenticity, experiential avoidance, and psychological well-being.

The situation here differs significantly from the diagnostic literature, in that researchers 
readily acknowledge the heterogeneity of these measures and routinely report separate

results for specific factors and subscales. Consequently, this type of heterogeneity does 
not represent a methodological or data analytic problem. At the conceptual level, however, 
it does raise the issue of whether it makes sense to subsume such a diverse array of 
characteristics within the same purported constructs (viz., psychopathy and narcissism). We 
consider this issue subsequently.

The transdiagnostic nature of traits.—As noted, trait antagonism is common to both 
the grandiose and vulnerable forms of narcissism. However, antagonism hardly is unique to 
narcissism; it also is a strong element in many other forms of psychopathology, including 
psychopathy (Vize et al., 2020). We illustrate this point using data from two recent studies 
(Somma et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2021) that examined relations between the TriPM and 
FFNI-SF. Table 4 presents weighted mean correlations between these two instruments’ 
scales that were computed across these two studies. We begin by noting that the Table 4 
findings clearly demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of both measures (for the FFNI-SF, r 
range = −.02 to .45; for the TriPM, r range = .01 to .72). Moreover, they establish a strong 
association between TriPM Meanness and FFNI-SF Antagonism (mean r = .62), as well as 
a substantial link between TriPM Boldness and FFNI-SF Agentic Extraversion (mean r = 
.49). Thus, purported measures of narcissism and psychopathy both contain strong elements 
of antagonism and agentic extraversion (see also Vize et al., 2020, who report associations 
between the FFNI-SF and EPA-SF; e.g., FFNI Antagonism and EPA Antagonism r = .72; 
FFNI Neuroticism and EPA Emotional Stability r = −.64).

These results raise the further issue of whether these self-report scales show any specificity 
to their target condition. A thorough analysis of this issue is beyond the scope of this 
paper, but we can illustrate the nature of this problem using data reported by Daurio and 
Taylor (2022), who present correlations between the triarchic model traits—assessed with 
the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form (MPQ-BF; Patrick et al., 2002)
—and the Cluster B PD scales from the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (PDQ-4; 
Hyler, 1994) in two samples (combined N = 1,057). It should be noted that the PDQ-4 is a 
self-report instrument whose items were written to parallel the DSM-IV/DSM-5 diagnostic 
criteria for each Section II PD.

The triarchic traits showed reasonable convergent validity in these data, in the sense 
that they all correlated significantly with the PDQ-4 ASPD scale (range = .59 with MPQ-
BF Disinhibition to .21 with MPQ-BF Boldness). However, they displayed questionable 
discriminant validity, in that they correlated comparably with other Cluster B scales. Thus, 
MPQ-BF Meanness correlated similarly with ASPD (mean r = .49), NPD (mean r = .46), 
and BPD (mean r = .44); Boldness had similar associations with histrionic PD (mean r = 
.28), ASPD (mean r = .25), and NPD (mean r = .21); and Disinhibition was strongly linked 
to both BPD (mean r = .66) and ASPD (mean r = .56) and more moderately related to NPD 
(mean r = .42). Based on their results, Daurio and Taylor (2022) conclude that the triarchic 
traits represent transdiagnostic features that are shared across multiple Cluster B disorders 
rather than dimensions characteristic of psychopathy per se.

Recommendations for future research.—As stated earlier, we have questioned the 
value of studying the Section II disorders in personality pathology research (Clark, 2007;

Watson, 2003; Watson et al., 2016; Watson, Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022). These disorders 
are subject to myriad problems, including the two foci of this paper: comorbidity and 
heterogeneity. Table 4 demonstrates that the current psychometric literature on narcissism 
and psychopathy reflects the same basic issues. That is, we see clear evidence of complex, 
heterogeneous constructs that include strongly overlapping elements and that, therefore, are 
substantially interrelated.

Traits such as neuroticism, agentic extraversion, and antagonism truly are transdiagnostic 
and are associated with many different forms of psychopathology. For example, elevated 
levels of neuroticism are linked to most types of internalizing (Kotov et al., 2010; Watson, 
Levin-Aspenson et al., 2022), and agentic extraversion is associated with mania and multiple 
forms of externalizing (Watson et al., 2019; Watson, Clark, et al., 2022). These traits 
also play an important role in the AMPD. It is not surprising, therefore, that trait-based 
measures of borderline features (e.g., Crego & Widiger, 2016; Helle & Mullins-Sweatt, 
2019), psychopathy (e.g., Anderson & Kelley, in press; Anderson et al., 2014; Crego & 
Widiger, 2014; Drislane et al., 2019) and narcissism (e.g., Miller et al., 2013, 2014, in 
press; Wright et al., 2013) show strong and systematic links with the PID-5, the self-report 
operationalization of the AMPD.

For instance, Somma et al. (2020) reported associations between the PID-5 and both 
the TriPM and the FFNI-SF. FFNI-SF Antagonism and TriPM Meanness had moderate-
to-strong correlations with several PID-5 scales, including Callousness, Deceitfulness, 
Manipulativeness, Grandiosity, and Hostility (rs ranged from .37 to .63, mean r = .53). 
FFNI-SF Agentic Extraversion and TriPM Boldness were significantly linked to PID-5 
Attention Seeking, Grandiosity, Manipulativeness and Risk Taking (rs ranged from .20 to 
.62, mean r = .38). FFNI-SF Neuroticism was moderately related to PID-5 Anxiousness, 
Depressivity, Separation Insecurity, and Submissiveness (rs ranged from .32 to .41, 
mean r = .38). TriPM Disinhibition was substantially associated with PID-5 Impulsivity, 
Irresponsibility, Distractibility, and Eccentricity (rs ranged from .40 to .51, mean r = .44).

Rather than continuing to study pathological characteristics within multiple discrete 
literatures, it is preferable to move toward a unified—and truly comprehensive—trait 
dimensional model of personality pathology (for a related discussion, see Anderson 
& Kelley, in press). Clark and Watson (in press) recently offered several specific 
recommendations for modifying both the AMPD (leading to a revised AMPD-5.1) and the 
PID-5 (an augmented PID-5.1). These included several recommendations for expanding the 
content coverage of the model—for example, by adding facets to existing AMPD domains 
(e.g., health anxiety and self-harm to Negative Affectivity; greediness, stubbornness, 
domineeringness, and rudeness to Antagonism) and by including traits related to the 
domain of anankastia (e.g., workaholism, scrupulousness). The current review suggests 
some opportunities for further improvements. We strongly encourage researchers to work 
toward integrating current trait measures of borderline features, psychopathy, and narcissism 
into the AMPD. Based on the existing evidence, it is clear that much of their content already 
will be well modeled in the PID-5. However, if it can be shown that these measures contain 
important trait characteristics that currently are not captured in the AMPD, this would 
provide an excellent basis for a further expansion of the PID-5 and the Section III model.
