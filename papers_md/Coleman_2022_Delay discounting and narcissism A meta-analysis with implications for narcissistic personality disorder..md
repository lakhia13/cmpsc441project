Abstract

Several psychiatric conditions (e.g., substance use, mood, and personality disorders) are 
characterized, in part, by greater delay discounting (DD)—a decision-making bias in the direction 
of preferring smaller, more immediate over larger, delayed rewards. Narcissistic personality 
disorder (NPD) is highly comorbid with substance use, mood, and other personality disorders, 
suggesting that DD may be a process underpinning risk for NPD as well. This meta-analysis 
examined associations between DD and theoretically distinct, clinically relevant dimensions of 
narcissism (i.e., grandiosity, entitlement, and vulnerability). Literature searches were conducted 
and articles were included if they were written in English, published in a peer-reviewed journal, 
contained measures of DD and narcissism and reported their association, and used an adult 
sample. Narcissism measures had to be systematically categorized according to clinically relevant 
dimensions (Grijalva et al., 2015; Wright & Edershile, 2018). Seven studies met inclusion criteria 
(N = 2,705). DD was positively associated with narcissism (r = .21; 95% confidence interval 
[.10, .32]), with this association being largely attributable to measures of trait grandiosity that 
were used in each study (r = .24; 95% confidence interval [.11, .37]). No studies included 
diagnostic NPD assessments. These findings provide empirical evidence that DD is related to trait 
narcissism and perhaps risk for NPD (e.g., grandiosity listed in Criterion B of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, alternative model of personality disorders). 
Considering the positive evidence from this review, and the dearth of research examining DD in 
individuals with NPD, investigators studying NPD may consider incorporating DD measures in 
future studies to potentially inform clinical theory and novel adjunctive treatment options.

Delay discounting (DD) is an aspect of decision-making wherein the rewarding value of 
a commodity decreases as a function of temporal delay to its availability (Bickel et al., 
1999; Madden et al., 1997). Individuals with greater than average DD are said to exhibit 
a decision-making bias in the direction of preferring smaller, more immediate over larger, 
delayed rewards (Bickel et al., 1999; Madden et al., 1997). Greater DD is associated with 
a variety of psychiatric conditions, including substance use disorders, affective disorders, 
schizophrenia, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and borderline personality disorder 
(Amlung et al., 2019; Bickel & Mueller, 2009, Bickel et al., 2019; MacKillop et al., 2011). 
As such, DD has been proposed to constitute a “transdiagnostic process” underpinning a 
wide range of psychiatric conditions (Bickel & Mueller, 2009; Bickel et al., 2019). This 
insight aligns with the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria 
initiative, which advocates characterizing psychiatric conditions in terms of underlying 
biological and psychological processes rather than groups of symptoms (Cuthbert & Insel, 
2013; Insel et al., 2010).

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is highly comorbid with psychiatric conditions 
associated with greater DD, including substance use, mood, and other personality 
disorders (Stinson et al., 2008). There is an ongoing debate over the factor structure 
and operationalization of narcissism (Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018; 
Miller et al., 2017; Pincus & Lukowitsky, 2010; Wright & Edershile, 2018). However, 
narcissism is generally thought to encompass three clinically relevant dimensions of 
personality: grandiosity, characterized by an overriding need for recognition and admiration 
to maintain and enhance an inflated sense of self-importance; entitlement, characterized 
by a prioritization of self-interests and expectations for especially favorable treatment; 
and vulnerability, which involves an inability to regulate affect, self-concept, and behavior 
when needs or self-interests are threatened. As Wright and Edershile (2018) discussed, the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM–5), Section III 
alternative model of personality disorders (AMPD) NPD diagnostic criteria reflect each of 
these dimensions. For example, Criterion A contains content related to vulnerability (e.g., 
“exaggerated self-appraisal may be inflated or deflated or vacillate between extremes”), 
Criterion B encompasses grandiosity (e.g., “firmly holding to the belief that one is better 
than others”), and features of entitlement are found in both Criterion A (e.g., “personal 
standards are […] too low based on a sense of entitlement”) and Criterion B (e.g., “Feelings 
of entitlement, either overt or covert”; American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Importantly, evidence suggests DD may differentially relate to narcissism dimensions. 
For example, research linking narcissism to the behavioral activation and inhibition 
systems has shown that individuals high in grandiosity appear to have greater than 
average motivation to pursue rewards but only weak motivation to avoid punishments 
(i.e., “approach-orientation”; Foster & Trimm, 2008). Consistent with such evidence, those 
high in grandiosity may be more likely to engage in risky patterns of substance use (e.g., 
problematic alcohol consumption) and sexual behavior (e.g., having unprotected sex and 
multiple sex partners; Coleman et al., 2020), suggesting such individuals may have greater 
than average preferences for smaller, more immediate rewards (e.g., intoxication, sexual 
gratification), even when obtaining them could mean forgoing larger, delayed rewards (e.g., 
better long-term health). By contrast, individuals high in vulnerability appear to have no

more or less motivation to pursue rewards but stronger than average motivation to avoid 
punishments (i.e., avoidance-orientation”; Foster & Trimm, 2008), which suggests that DD 
and vulnerability may be unrelated.

Clinical perspectives posit that individuals with NPD can vacillate between grandiose (e.g., 
extraverted/approach-oriented) and vulnerable states (e.g., neurotic/avoidance-oriented; 
Giacomin & Jordan, 2016; Gore & Widiger, 2016; Pincus et al., 2015; Wright & Edershile, 
2018) and that both grandiosity and vulnerability may be anchored by core expressions 
of entitlement (Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018; Wright & Edershile, 2018). 
Therefore, an examination of how DD relates to all three narcissism dimensions is warranted 
and may help inform future psychiatric studies (e.g., efforts to account for comorbidity 
between NPD and other psychiatric conditions or to identify feasible points of intervention). 
More importantly, others have called for research to identify processes to help better 
understand NPD (Eaton et al., 2017). To our knowledge, there have been no prior reviews 
examining potential associations between DD and narcissism. Thus, the purpose of this 
meta-analysis is to examine potential associations between DD and theoretically distinct, 
clinically relevant dimensions of narcissism.

Method

Search Strategy and Study Selection

This review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines (Figure 1).1 Articles were identified through searches of the PubMed, PsycINFO, 
and Web of Science databases from inception through January 31, 2021. Search terms 
included (delay discounting OR temporal discounting OR future discounting OR delayed 
gratification OR deferred gratification OR delayed reward OR intertemporal choice OR 
intertemporal preference OR impulsivity OR risk-taking) AND (narcissism OR grandiosity 
OR entitlement OR exhibitionism OR psychopathy OR machiavellianism OR dark triad). 
The functional search term narciss* was included to produce studies on NPD and trait 
narcissism. Although the term vulnerability is associated with a specific narcissism 
dimension, it was not included in the search, as it was expected to produce excessive 
literature on irrelevant topics (e.g., socioeconomic vulnerability, childhood vulnerability). 
Search results were limited to full-text journal articles in the English language and reporting 
studies conducted with humans. After removing duplicates, the search identified 1,985 
articles for title and abstract screening. Reference sections of relevant articles and reviews 
were also searched, yielding no additional articles.

Sulamunn R. M. Coleman and Anthony C. Oliver screened titles and abstracts of these 
1,985 articles using the following inclusion criteria: (a) written in English, (b) published 
in a peer-reviewed journal, (c) contained an assessment of DD, (d) contained a validated 
assessment of narcissism systematically categorized according to a clinically relevant 
dimension of narcissism (Grijalva et al., 2015; Wright & Edershile, 2018), (e) reported 
an association between DD and narcissism, and (f) used an adult sample. This meta-

analysis focused on adults because narcissism (e.g., symptoms of NPD) may be highly 
prevalent during childhood and adolescence but generally decreases over time (Cohen et 
al., 2005; Hamlat et al., 2020). Articles that both authors recommended were advanced to 
full-text review (interob-server agreement = 99.7%). Disagreements were discussed until 
consensus was reached. Seventeen articles advanced to full-text review. Following full-text 
review, seven articles were selected for inclusion. Finally, authors using the Narcissistic 
Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin & Hall, 1979) were contacted for additional data 
on associations between DD and three NPI subscales, including Leadership/Authority, 
Grandiose Exhibitionism, and Entitlement/Exploitativeness (Ackerman et al., 2011). Dr. 
Buelow provided means and standard deviations for the three NPI subscales as well as 
correlations between DD and the three NPI subscales (Buelow & Brunell, 2014; Table 1). 
No other authors provided additional data.

Data Extraction

Sulamunn R. M. Coleman and Anthony C. Oliver independently read the full texts of 
the seven articles that met inclusion criteria and extracted the data presented in Table 1. 
The primary outcome of interest was the association between DD and clinically relevant 
dimensions of narcissism. To interpret associations between DD and narcissism dimensions, 
it is important to understand that the direction of associations may change depending on the 
index used to quantify DD (Smith & Hantula, 2008). For example, DD measures involve 
hypothetical choice tasks that require choosing between a smaller, sooner reward and a 
larger, later reward over different delay intervals (e.g., Would you prefer: (a) $100 today 
or (b) $1,000 in 1 month? Would you prefer: (a) $100 today or (b) $1,000 in 1 year?). 
The term “delay interval” refers to the amount of time an individual would have to wait 
to receive a larger reward (e.g., one month, one year). One way to index DD is to simply 
count the number of times respondents choose a smaller, sooner reward over a larger, 
later reward (Griskevicius et al., 2011). Greater count scores correspond to greater DD 
(i.e., greater preference for smaller, sooner reward). More commonly, data obtained from 
hypothetical choice tasks are used to generate DD curves (Richards et al., 1999). Once a 
curve is produced, the data are fit according to quantitative discounting models in which 
the parameter k is used to index DD (for a detailed explanation of discounting models, see 
Madden & Johnson, 2010). Larger k values correspond to greater DD. In studies using count 
scores or k values to index DD, positive associations between DD and narcissism indicate 
that greater narcissism is associated with a greater preference for a smaller, sooner reward.

An alternative method of calculating DD is to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), 
which does not require that assumptions be met about the various discounting functions and 
parameter estimates (Myerson et al., 2001). AUC values range from 0.0 to 1.0. Thus, smaller 
AUC values indicate greater DD, as they correspond to more rapid devaluation of reward as 
a function of delay. In studies using AUC to index DD, negative associations between DD 
and narcissism indicate that greater narcissism is associated with a greater preference for a 
smaller, sooner reward. To facilitate the interpretation of results in the current meta-analysis, 
r values derived from AUC values were reverse coded so that all effects faced the same 
direction (i.e., positive r corresponds to a greater preference for a smaller, sooner reward).

All studies included self-report measures of trait narcissism; no studies containing diagnostic 
assessments of NPD were identified. In general, most measures of trait narcissism are 
thought to be captured primarily by one clinically relevant dimension of the construct but 
may be captured by other dimensions at secondary or tertiary levels (Crowe et al., 2019; 
Wright & Edershile, 2018). Measures of trait narcissism in the current meta-analysis were 
coded according to the dimension they are thought to be captured by at a primary level (i.e., 
grandiosity, entitlement, or vulnerability) based on the categorizations of existing reviews 
(Grijalva et al., 2015; Wright & Edershile, 2018; Table 1). Importantly, demonstrating that 
DD broadly associates with trait measures along one or more clinically relevant dimensions 
of narcissism could suggest which DSM–5 AMPD NPD criteria are most likely to reflect 
greater (or lesser) DD. Discrepancies in data extraction were discussed between authors until 
consensus was reached.

Quality Assessment

Quality of evidence was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Quality 
Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies (Table 2; National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2021), which contains 14 criteria used to evaluate the 
risk of bias and the validity for each study contained in the meta-analysis (e.g., “Was the 
participation rate of eligible persons at least 50%?”). The criteria were rated as “yes,” “no,” 
or other (i.e., cannot determine [“CD”], not reported [“NR”], or not applicable [“NA”]). 
Consistent with a recent meta-analysis (Torres-Castro et al., 2021), a total score (i.e., 
percentage) was provided for each study based on the number of criteria rated as “yes” 
divided by the number of criteria applicable to the study. Studies with a total score of ≥75% 
were assigned a quality rating of “good” (i.e., least risk of bias, results are considered valid), 
those with a total score of 50%–74% were assigned a quality rating of “fair” (i.e., some bias 
deemed not sufficient to invalidate the results), and those with a total score of <50% were 
assigned a quality rating of “poor” (i.e., significant risk of bias). Sulamunn R. M. Coleman 
and Elias M. Klemperer independently evaluated the quality of evidence for each study, and 
discrepancies were discussed between authors and resolved by consensus.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses were conducted using the software package Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 
Version 3 (Borenstein et al., 2013). The measure of effect size used in this study was 
r. Consistent with the recommendations of the statistical software, the mean of effect 
sizes was used for studies reporting more than one effect per sample (Buelow & Brunell, 
2014; Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018). Random-effects, meta-analysis models were selected a 
priori to calculate the estimated average effect size and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). Random-effects models, in which each study’s effect is weighted inversely 
proportional to its variance, were used due to the assumption of significant heterogeneity 
of effect sizes across studies. Finally, possible publication bias was examined using funnel 
plots and Egger’s regression test (Egger et al., 1997).

Results

Study Characteristics

Page 6

Included studies were published between 2013 and 2021 (Table 1). Overall sample size was 
2,705 across studies (Mage = 26.21, SD = 7.49; 54% women). The median sample size was 
299. Ten correlations were extracted from the seven articles.

Regarding DD measures and indices (Table 1), a count score was calculated using delay 
intervals in one study (Jonason et al., 2020). Two studies calculated k scores (Buelow 
& Brunell, 2014; Crysel et al., 2013) using either Kirby’s 27-item Monetary Choice 
Questionnaire (Kirby et al.,1999) or delay intervals. The remaining studies used delay 
intervals to calculate AUC (Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018; Malesza & Kalinowski, 2021a, 
2021b; Malesza & Ostaszewski, 2016).

Regarding measures and dimensions of narcissism (Table 1), all studies included measures 
coded as assessing trait grandiosity (Buelow & Brunell, 2014; Crysel et al., 2013; Jonason 
et al., 2020; Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018; Malesza & Kalinowski, 2021a, 2021b; Malesza 
& Ostaszewski, 2016), such as the Narcissistic Grandiosity Scale (NGS; Crowe et al., 
2016; Rosenthal et al., 2020), Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Narcissism subscale (Dirty Dozen; 
Jonason & Webster, 2010), Short Dark Triad Narcissism subscale (Jones & Paulhus, 2014), 
or the NPI (Raskin & Hall, 1979). In addition, Buelow and Brunell (2014) provided data 
on the NPI Leadership/Authority and Grandiose Exhibitionism subscales (Ackerman et al., 
2011), both of which were coded as measures of trait grandiosity. One study (Buelow & 
Brunell, 2014) included the Psychological Entitlement Scale (PES; Campbell et al., 2004) 
and NPI Entitlement/Exploitativeness subscale (Ackerman et al., 2011), both coded as 
measures of trait entitlement, and another study (Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018) included the 
Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (HSNS; Hendin & Cheek, 1997), which was coded as a 
measure of trait vulnerability.

Meta-Analyses (DD and Narcissism Overall or Trait Grandiosity)

The estimated average effect calculated from seven effect sizes of DD and narcissism overall 
(i.e., collapsing across narcissism dimensions) was small to moderate (r = .21; 95% CI 
[.10, .32]) (Figure 2). The mean effect size for the data provided by Buelow and Brunell 
(2014) was calculated using the correlations between DD and the PES, NGS, and NPI full 
scale, and the mean effect size for the data provided by Malesza and Kaczmarek (2018) was 
calculated using the correlations between DD and the NPI and HSNS; r was positive and 
significant for all but one study (Malesza & Ostaszewski, 2016).

There were seven effect sizes used to calculate the estimated average effect size for trait 
grandiosity (Figure 3). Similar to narcissism overall, the estimated average effect calculated 
from seven effect sizes of DD and trait grandiosity was small to moderate (r = .24; 95% CI 
[.11, .37]). The mean effect size for the data provided by Buelow and Brunell (2014) was 
calculated using the correlations between DD and the NGS and NPI Full Scale. Again, r was 
positive and significant for all but one study (Malesza & Ostaszewski, 2016).

Two supplemental meta-analyses were conducted making use of the NPI subscale 
data provided by Buelow and Brunell (2014). For the first analysis (narcissism 
overall), the mean effect size for the data provided by Buelow and Brunell (2014) 
was calculated using the correlations between DD and the PES, NGS, Narcissistic 
Personality Inventory—Leadership/Authority subscale, Narcissistic Personality Inventory
—Grandiose Exhibitionism subscale, and Narcissistic Personality Inventory—Entitlement/
Exploitativeness subscale. The results of this meta-analysis (r = .21; 95% CI [.10, .32]) were 
identical to those of the main meta-analysis for narcissism overall (Figure S1 in the online 
supplemental materials).

For the second analysis (trait grandiosity), we used only the correlations between DD 
and the NGS, Narcissistic Personality Inventory—Leadership/Authority subscale, and 
Narcissistic Personality Inventory—Grandiose Exhibitionism subscale to calculate the mean 
effect for the data provided by Buelow and Brunell (2014). Again, the results of this meta-
analysis (r = .24; 95% CI [.11, .37]) were identical to the results of the main meta-analysis 
for trait grandiosity (Figure S2 in the online supplemental materials).

Associations Between DD and Trait Entitlement or Trait Vulnerability

There were too few effect sizes to conduct separate meta-analyses for trait entitlement or 
vulnerability. DD was positively and significantly associated with trait entitlement measured 
with the Psychological Entitlement Scale (r = .29, p ≤ .001) and the NPI Entitlement/
Exploitativeness subscale (r = .15, p ≤ .001), with small-to-moderate effect sizes comparable 
with the estimated average effect sizes for DD and narcissism overall and trait grandiosity. 
DD was unrelated to trait vulnerability (r =−.08, p = n.s.).

Quality Assessment and Publication Bias

The quality of evidence was rated as “good” for four studies (Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018; 
Malesza & Kalinowski, 2021a, 2021b; Malesza & Ostaszewski, 2016), as “fair” for two 
studies (Crysel et al., 2013; Jonason et al., 2020), and as “poor” for one study (Buelow 
& Brunell, 2014; Table 2). One study was rated as “fair” (Crysel et al., 2013) rather than 
“good” because subjects were recruited from very different populations (United States, 
India, Canada, Indonesia, and Pakistan), but potential group differences by country of origin 
were not reported, and it was unclear whether eligibility criteria were applied uniformly to 
all participants. A second study was rated as “fair” (Jonason et al., 2020) because it was 
unclear whether any participants were missing data that would have excluded them from the 
analyses. In addition, given the study’s very large age distribution (18–82; Mage = 37.11, SD 
= 12.76), there may have been important age-related differences between participants that 
were unaccounted for. One study was rated as “poor” (Buelow & Brunell, 2014) because 
only 31% of the participants completed all measures of narcissism, and it was unclear 
why the measures were not implemented consistently across participants and less than 50% 
of eligible participants completed all assessments. In addition, eligibility criteria were not 
reported. Overall, six of seven (86%) of the studies included in the meta-analysis were rated 
as “fair” or better, and four of seven (57%) of the studies were rated as “good.” Finally, we 
found no evidence of publication bias for narcissism overall (Figure 4) or trait grandiosity 
(Figure 5).

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate associations between DD and clinically 
relevant dimensions of narcissism. Although no studies examining DD and diagnostic 
assessments of NPD were identified, the aggregated effect sizes presented in the main and 
supplemental meta-analyses provide a modest but consistent body of empirical evidence for 
a small-to-moderate positive association between DD and measures of trait narcissism. This 
association was mostly examined using various measures of trait grandiosity. A positive 
association between DD and trait entitlement was also observed in one study (Buelow 
& Brunell, 2014), but there was no association between DD and trait vulnerability in 
another study (Malesza & Kaczmarek, 2018). Consistent with the DSM–5 Section III 
AMPD, these findings suggest that greater DD may be reflected in NPD Criterion B (i.e., 
grandiosity, attention-seeking) but could be more broadly associated with NPD via features 
of entitlement. In the spirit of the Research Domain Criteria Framework, the current findings 
provide initial support for the position that DD may be a process of relevance to NPD that 
could help to account, in part, for comorbidities between NPD and disorders characterized 
by greater DD.

In this study, small-to-medium estimated average effect sizes were observed for associations 
between DD and narcissism overall (i.e., collapsing effect sizes across measures of different 
narcissism dimensions) and trait grandiosity. In terms of magnitude, the strength of 
association between DD and trait narcissism is comparable with that of DD and major 
depressive disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and 
binge-eating disorder but not as strong compared with associations between DD and 
borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, or substance use disorders (Amlung et al., 
2019; Bickel et al., 2019; MacKillop et al., 2011). Thus, the present findings suggest that 
DD could be an important process for understanding aspects of narcissism (e.g., grandiosity, 
entitlement), associated behavioral risks (e.g., problematic alcohol consumption; Coleman et 
al., 2020), or comorbidities between NPD and other psychiatric conditions.

Importantly, although the debate over the number and operationalization of the primary 
dimensions of narcissism remains ongoing (Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018; 
Miller et al., 2017; Wright & Edershile, 2018), it is widely accepted that grandiosity and 
entitlement are pronounced in individuals with NPD. The current findings indicate that 
trait grandiosity and perhaps entitlement may be indicative of greater DD. Therefore, it is 
reasonable to suggest that DD may be greater among those who meet diagnostic criteria 
for NPD. More importantly, this review highlights a dearth of research in the area of 
DD and NPD, and research focused on clinical samples or using diagnostic assessments 
of narcissism is needed to better contextualize the clinical significance of the association 
between DD and narcissism.

Beyond the clinical literature, a growing body of evidence indicates that trait narcissism, 
particularly grandiosity, associates with a variety of risky behavior patterns (Buelow & 
Brunell, 2018), including greater alcohol consumption (Coleman et al., 2020; Hill, 2016; 
Luhtanen & Crocker, 2005), having unprotected sex and multiple sex partners (Coleman 
et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2013), making risky financial decisions (Foster et al., 2011),

Limitations

gambling (Lakey et al., 2008), and even disregarding public health and safety messages 
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Hardin et al., 2021; Nowak et al., 2020; Venema & 
Pfattheicher, 2021; Zajenkowski et al., 2020). Because greater DD is associated with many 
of these same behaviors (Bickel et al., 2019), it may be informative to examine whether 
interventions that have been shown to reduce DD (e.g., Episodic Future Thinking; Peters & 
Büchel, 2010; Snider et al., 2016; Stein et al., 2016) are effective for producing reductions in 
behavioral problems associated with narcissism.

This study has several limitations that merit mention. First, as noted earlier, none of the 
studies in this review included diagnostic assessments of NPD. Although categorizing self-
report measures of trait narcissism according to clinically relevant dimensions may provide 
some insight into how DD could relate to NPD, and measures such as the NPI have been 
shown to correspond with expert ratings of NPD trait profiles (Miller et al., 2016), this study 
provides only preliminary evidence that DD may represent a process of relevance to NPD. 
Second, the topic of interest is relatively understudied, with only seven studies meeting 
inclusion criteria for this review and only two of those studies examining dimensions 
other than grandiosity. This small number of studies precluded, for example, a moderation 
analysis of the association between DD and narcissism by dimensions of narcissism. It will 
be important to further examine associations between DD and narcissism after more research 
by a larger group of investigators emerges on this topic. Third, although the Dirty Dozen 
(Jonason & Webster, 2010) is thought to represent a measure of grandiosity (Grijalva et 
al., 2015), some evidence demonstrates that it positively correlates with the HSNS (i.e., a 
measure of vulnerability), which distinguishes it from other measures of grandiosity that 
negatively correlate with the HSNS (Maples et al., 2014). Given the evidence presented 
in the current study that DD may be unrelated to vulnerability (Malesza & Kaczmarek, 
2018), it is possible that the Dirty Dozen underestimates the association between DD and 
grandiosity. Relatedly, as the NPI and HSNS have been shown to negatively correlate 
(Maples et al., 2014), calculating a mean effect size for the data provided by Malesza 
and Kaczmarek (2018) using the association between DD and the NPI and the association 
between DD and the HSNS likely obscures the effect of DD for both grandiosity and 
vulnerability. Furthermore, most measures of grandiosity and vulnerability capture aspects 
of entitlement, or “self-centered antagonism” more broadly, which encompasses a lack of 
empathy and a willingness to exploit others to meet entitled expectations (Crowe et al., 
2019); however, it was not possible to factor these aspects out of all measures of grandiosity 
or vulnerability contained in this meta-analysis. Together, these limitations underscore the 
need for additional research on this topic, particularly research examining associations 
between DD and narcissism dimensions other than grandiosity. Moreover, it would be 
informative for future studies to report associations between DD and subscales of narcissism 
measures such as the NPI or use narcissism measures that contain subscales demonstrated 
to load primarily onto one narcissism dimension (e.g., the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory 
Short Form, Agentic Extraversion, Antagonism, and Neuroticism subscales; Crowe et al., 
2019; Miller et al., 2016; Sherman et al., 2015).

Conclusion

Page 10

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that DD and trait narcissism are 
positively associated. Given the relative consistency of associations between DD and 
trait narcissism across different samples and measures categorized according to clinically 
relevant dimensions, these findings have implications for placing NPD among other 
psychiatric conditions characterized by greater DD. Further research in this domain could 
help to clarify whether DD represents an important source of transdiagnostic variance 
underlying NPD and psychiatric comorbidities and whether DD links NPD to risky 
behaviors and associated downstream functional impairments (e.g., health, relationship, 
legal, or financial problems).
