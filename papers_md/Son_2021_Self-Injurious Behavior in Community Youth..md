Abstract: The rapid increase of self-injurious behavior among Korean adolescents, and its reckless
spread on social media, has driven the necessity to study this behavior. The present study investi-
gates the characteristics of self-injurious behavior among adolescents in local communities, and the
psychological factors affecting such behavior. Questionnaires were administered to 516 sixth graders
in elementary school and ﬁrst to third graders in middle school of both genders, nationwide. They
measured the prevalence and characteristics of self-injurious behavior and the relevant psychological
factors, such as levels of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. Furthermore, group differences were
assessed for self-injury experience and the characteristics relevant to self-injurious behavior. In
addition, this study performs logistic regression to explore the risk factors predicting self-injurious
behavior. In all, 166 participants (32.2%) reported self-injury, with a higher rate of self-injury in female
students than in male students. Although the study ﬁnds high rates of mild forms of self-injury,
such as “biting”, “pulling hair,” and “hitting self”, it also ﬁnds relatively high reports of more risky
methods, such as “cutting or carving”. The logistic regression shows a signiﬁcant effect of the nega-
tive self-image sub-factor of depression (CDI) and oversensitivity and physical and sleep problems
sub-factors of anxiety (RCMAS) on self-injurious behavior. The rates of self-injury were higher in
female participants than in male ones, and adolescents in local communities reported higher rates of
mild forms of self-injury than the moderate/severe forms. The results of this study suggest that early
screenings and interventions should be conducted through evaluation of self-image and emotional
stability of early adolescents to hinder the risk of self-harm.

1. Introduction

Self-injurious behavior is a broad class of behaviors that directly and deliberately harm
one’s body. These behaviors include non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), in which one directly
and deliberately harms one’s own body tissue without the intent to die [1]. NSSI includes
cutting or carving one’s skin with a sharp object, hitting oneself, and picking one’s wounds.
In addition, banging, burning, and substance abuse are also common forms of NSSI [2].
Previous research has categorized the severity of NSSI as mild, moderate, and severe
according to their forms. Mild forms of NSSI include hitting oneself, picking one’s wounds,
and banging, while moderate/severe forms of NSSI consist of cutting, carving one’s skin,
burning, and substance abuse [3]. Self-injury tends to begin in early adolescence, typically
in ages 12–14 [4]. Meta-analysis studies have reported a 2.9–69.6% lifetime prevalence
of NSSI in children and adolescents, varying with samples and methods of evaluation.
They estimate the overall lifetime prevalence at 22.1% [5]. Self-injurious behavior is highly
correlated with various psychiatric symptoms. For example, symptoms of depression
and anxiety disorders were more associated with self-harm, especially those who did
self-harm had a higher number of borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms than
those who did not [6]. Therefore, such behavior requires care and attention, as repetitive

self-injury desensitizes an individual to physical pain and it can increase the risk of suicide.
Large-scale cohort studies conducted in the United States and United Kingdom found that
adults who deliberately injured themselves had a suicide rate 30 times higher than that of
the general population [7,8].

Recent studies conducted in Korea investigating self-injurious behavior in middle
and high school students report varying degrees of lifetime prevalence, ranging from
8.8% to 22.8%; some studies ﬁnd that the age of onset of self-injury is 12.4~13.8, which
is similar to studies conducted overseas [9–13]. As a result of the Adolescent Personality
and Mental Health Problems Screening Questionnaire conducted by the Korean Ministry
of Education for all middle and high school students in Korea in 2018, the number of
ﬁrst-year middle school students who reported that they had engaged in self-harm was
about 40,500/514,710 (7.9%), and about 30,000/514,710 (6.4%) in the ﬁrst year of high
school reported self-harm experiences [14]. An analysis of the number of counseling cases
at 230 youth counseling and welfare centers nationwide in Korea identiﬁed 27,976 cases
of counseling for adolescents who engaged in self-injurious behavior in 2018, which was
more than three times higher than that of the previous year (8352). During the same
period, the number of suicide-related counseling also doubled from 23,915 (2017) to 43,238
(2018) [15]. In addition, data from the Adolescent Personality and Mental Health Problems
Screening Questionnaire for the last four years revealed that the number of students in the
suicide risk group in 2018 was 23,324, which is an increase of 270% compared to 2015 [16].
Considering that the survey was conducted at the school level, the proportion of students
who have engaged in self-harm may have been less reported. Nevertheless, the fact that
the proportion of students at risk of self-harm and suicide has increased sharply in the last
few years, reﬂecting the recent issue of youth self-harm as a serious problem in Korea.

The degree of self-injurious behavior can be classiﬁed as mild or moderate based on
the severity and frequency of self-injury [3]. The characteristics vary, and depend on the
number of methods used or the age of onset. In general, the severity of self-injury tends to
increase, as both the number of self-injuries and methods used increase [1,17], and with
the decreasing age of onset [18]. Previous research in Korea reports that mild forms of
self-injurious behaviors, such as “biting,” “hitting,” “pulling hair,” and “scratching skin,”
are most common in adolescents in local communities, and 13.7–16.8% of the participants
report moderate forms of self-injury, such as “cutting with a sharp object” [9,12,13]. Lee [11]
reports a moderate degree of self-injurious behavior in 67.0% of middle-schoolers. Prior
research shows that self-injury in adolescents helps them regulate burdensome negative
emotions, as a coping strategy to deal with emotional difﬁculties [19,20]. Early intervention
is essential, because repetitive self-injurious behavior in the early stages of development
can become the main coping strategy of adolescents when they face unpleasant emotions
or situations. With adolescent self-injury in local communities becoming a serious problem
in society, an increasing number of studies in Korea are now focusing on such behavior [21].
However, there remains a lack of foundational research investigating the conditions and
characteristics of Korean adolescent self-injurious behavior.

Recently, adolescents in Korea have begun taking pictures of self-injurious behav-
ior and uploading them on social media or forming cyber communities of self-injury,
such as “ja-hae-gye” (self-injury group) or “ja-hae-ruh” (individual with self-injurious
behavior) [21]. Self-injury occurs to regulate emotions or fulﬁll social purposes, such
as manipulating others or avoiding responsibilities; however, peer pressure is a strong
factor that inﬂuences adolescents to choose self-injurious behavior as a coping strategy
over others [22]. In a longitudinal study targeting adolescents, the number of self-injuries
of the closest friend signiﬁcantly predicted the number of self-injuries in early female
adolescents 11 months later [22]. Another study that examined clinical samples found
that 82.1% of adolescents who harm themselves have friends who also self-harm [23]. The
socialization effect can explain deviant behaviors in adolescents, such as alcohol and drug
use, sexual behavior, and other acts of delinquency, including health-risk behaviors [24].
The socialization effect states that certain behaviors or attitudes of peers strongly affect the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

3 of 16

behaviors and attitudes of other peers within the same group (for a review, see [25]). Peer
relationships provide context for the socialization of behaviors, and in recent years, such
effects have been generalized to include socialization of some extreme forms of behavior,
such as self-injury [22,26]. Considering the trend of self-injurious behavior of adolescents
in real life and on the internet, self-injury is now a sub-culture of teenagers that helps
them form a sense of fellowship in addition to its traditional use as a maladaptive coping
strategy. Self-injurious behavior for early adolescents in the current society seems to have a
different function than before. Therefore, it is necessary to examine these aspects further to
understand these emerging characteristics.

Self-injurious behavior generally means deliberately and directly harming one’s body;
however, it has two subtypes: suicidal self-injury and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), based
on whether or not an individual intends to die [27]. Unlike suicidal behavior aimed to
kill oneself, NSSI accompanies multiple purposes other than death. The affect regulation
model is the most empirically supported among the theories explaining the functions of
NSSI. It describes that self-injurious behavior occurs to regulate emotions that one ﬁnds
very hard to handle [28]. According to the experiential avoidance model (EAM) proposed
by Chapman et al. [19], self-injurious behavior is maintained by negative reinforcement,
as it reduces or terminates unwanted negative emotions. A strong urge to avoid elevated
emotional arousal can occur, especially when one tends to feel overwhelmed by strong
emotional reactivity or experiencing emotional arousals, as unpleasant stimuli, due to
low distress tolerance. When individuals lack effective emotion regulation strategies or
fail to use one due to high arousal levels when experiencing unwanted emotion, they
might choose a maladaptive regulation strategy such as self-injuring to reduce unpleasant
emotional arousals quickly. If self-injurious behavior is negatively reinforced repeatedly, it
can be habituated as a response to the stimuli that cause negative affect, and eventually, it
can function as an automated and conditioned response to emotional arousals.

Previous research shows that individuals who self-injure generally experience higher
levels of negative affect than those who do not injure themselves [29,30]. Similar to adults,
adolescents perform self-injurious behavior primarily to soothe tension and emotional
pain and avoid negative affect [31,32]. One study that examined self-injuring adolescents
in local communities reported that 73.0% of the sample self-harms to obtain relief from a
terrible state of mind [33]. Such results support the thesis that affect regulation is the key
component of self-injurious behavior, as EAM also asserts.

In addition, the integrated theoretical model of NSSI proposed by Nock [34], which
is based on previous studies, claims that early developmental factors, such as childhood
abuse or genetic factors of high emotional and cognitive reactivity, induce internal and
external vulnerability within a person, as they function as the distal risk factors of self-injury.
Individuals with such vulnerability use maladaptive coping strategies, such as self-injuring,
to regulate strong negative emotions induced by stressful events. According to the above-
mentioned model, the negative emotional states that a person experiences, function as the
ultimate proximal risk factors for self-injury. According to the above-mentioned model,
the negative emotional states a person experiences function as the ultimate proximal risk
factors for self-injury. However, this model did not depict speciﬁc negative emotions
as risk factors of self-harm. Previous studies have found a strong relationship between
self-injury among adolescents and negative emotions, namely depression and anxiety.
We aimed to investigate speciﬁc aspects of such negative emotions in association with
self-injurious behavior.

The results of preceding research that insist affect regulation is the key function of self-
injury and negative emotional states are the proximal risk factors of self-injurious behavior,
indicate that further investigations should focus on negative emotion as a critical factor
triggering self-injurious behavior. Many studies have identiﬁed depression as the risk factor
predicting self-injurious behavior in Korea and abroad [10,11,35–48], and anxiety [10,39,40].
They are also strong proximal risk factors for self-injury [43]. Therefore, they are widely
accepted as primary negative emotions inducing self-injurious behavior.

However, a foreign study on psychiatric outpatients found no signiﬁcant difference
in the levels of depression between adolescents who injured themselves and those who
did not [42]. Another study conducted in Korea reported a similar ﬁnding, in which the
levels of depression did not differ between the self-injury group and the non-self-injury
group [40]. In addition, studies are inconsistent in reporting the relationship between high
levels of anxiety and self-injurious behavior [28,38]. Although that part of the research
was on clinical samples, such results propose the possibility of difﬁculties in predicting
self-injurious behavior from the total levels of depression and anxiety. Depression and
anxiety comprise multi-dimensional factors, including cognitive, emotional, physiological,
and behavioral aspects [43–50]. Therefore, further investigation into the sub-factors and
distinct predictive powers of self-injurious behavior is necessary to conﬁrm the aspects of
depression and anxiety that speciﬁcally predict self-injurious behavior.

Moreover, studies show that low self-esteem has a close association with self-injurious
behavior in adolescence [51,52]. As self-aversion and the need to punish oneself trigger
some self-injuries [29], such behavior can be understood as an attempt to avoid nega-
tive emotions induced by unpleasant conditions relevant to negative self-belief or self-
awareness [19]. Similarly, low self-esteem, along with negative emotions such as depression
and anxiety, can be a risk factor causing self-injurious behavior in early adolescence.

This study aims to investigate self-injurious behavior among adolescents in Korea and
the risk factors in such behavior. Speciﬁcally, we attempt to understand the characteristics
of self-injurious behavior trending among Korean adolescents along with the relevant risk
factors to identify the implications for effective prevention and intervention strategies for
early adolescents who are at a high risk of such behavior.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants

The study participants were 516 students residing in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do Province,
Gangwon-do Province, and Jeollanam-do Province. The participants included the sixth
graders from elementary school and ﬁrst to third graders from middle school (i.e., seventh
to ninth graders) of both genders. The second author’s university approved this study,
with IRB (no. HL19C0035). For the schools that approved participation in this study,
the researchers provided both students and legal guardians with explanations on the
description of this study and its procedures, an assurance of conﬁdentiality of personal
information, and a right to participate or withdraw from the study voluntarily. Exclusively
to the participants who understood the purpose of this study and presented written
informed consent signed by both a student and a legal guardian, a link to the online survey
composed of multiple questionnaires was sent via cellular phones. Among the 582 initial
volunteers of the study, 527 turned in their answers. After excluding questionnaires with
insufﬁcient responses (e.g., questionnaires with several missing items), data from a total of
516 students were used for the ﬁnal analysis.

Of the 516 students, 212 were male (41.1%) and 261 were female (50.6%); 43 students
did not identify their gender. The mean age was 13.74 (SD = 0.89), ranging from 11 to 16.

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation (FASM)

This study used the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation developed by Lloyd,
Kelly, and Hope [53] and translated and validated in Korean by Kwon [54] to measure
NSSI. This self-reported scale comprises three parts. The ﬁrst part comprises 12 items
measuring various methods and frequency of NSSI, and whether or not medical treatment
was received; the frequency of use of pertinent method in the past year or earlier is rated
on a 7-point scale (from 0 time or never to 6 or more times). The second part assesses
multiple factors relevant to self-injurious behavior (whether it occurred within the past
year, whether there was intent to die, duration of contemplation before self-injury, whether
they had consumed drugs or alcohol at the time, the amount of physical pain they felt

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

5 of 16

during self-injury, and the age of onset). The third part consisting of 23 items measures
purpose and reasons for participants to engage in NSSI. For analysis, this study only uses
the items assessing methods and frequency of self-injury and involving factors pertaining
to self-injurious behavior. Cronbach’s alpha for 11 items measuring methods and frequency
for self-injury was 0.59.

This study used a total score of frequency of self-injury to analyze correlations with
other scales. The severity of different methods of self-injurious behavior was categorized
based on previous studies [3,27] and items 1, 4, 6, 11 were classiﬁed as moderate, whereas
the rest were classiﬁed as mild.

2.2.2. Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI)

To assess the severity of depression in children and adolescents, this study used the
Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) developed by Kovacs [55], which Cho and Lee [56]
translated and validated in Korean. It is a 27-item questionnaire that uses a 3-point scale
(0, 1, 2), and its score ranges from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating more depressive
symptoms. Factor analysis in Kim et al.’s [46] study ﬁnds the three-factor structure the most
adequate for Korean children; the three factors include negative self-image, interpersonal
problems, and negative affect/somatic concerns. Internal consistency was 0.88 in Cho and
Lee [56] and 0.85 in Kim et al. [46]. In the current study, internal consistency was 0.84.

2.2.3. Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS)

This study used the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale, developed by Reynolds
and Richmond [57] and translated in Korean by Choi and Cho [58]. It is a self-reported
scale designed for youths, from elementary school students to high school students. The
scale consists of 9 lie items and 28 anxiety-related items, each item being dichotomous
to answer as “yes” or “no.” Higher total scores indicate a higher level of anxiety. Park
et al. [49] conducted factor analysis on Korean adolescents and revealed that the four-factor
model had the best ﬁt; the four factors are worry, oversensitivity, physical/sleep problems,
and negative affect/attention problems. Internal consistency in Choi and Cho [50] was 0.81
and in Park et al. [49] was 0.85. This current study has an internal consistency of 0.89.

2.2.4. Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES)

To measure self-esteem, this study used the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [59] translated
in Korean by Jeon [60] and validated by Lee [59]. This scale, which has 10 items, uses a
4-point Likert scale (1: almost never~4: always), and higher scores reﬂect higher self-esteem.
Internal consistency was 0.79 in Lee [61] and 0.84 in this current study.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

After analyzing the descriptive statistics and correlations among key variables, this
study analyzed variables accounting for differences in psychological characteristics be-
tween the self-injury and non-self-injury group. It also explored the characteristics of
self-injurious behavior pertaining to those who having engaged in self-injurious behav-
ior, such as frequency and methods of self-injury. To uncover the risk factors predicting
self-injurious behavior, this study conducted binomial logistic regression. All data were
processed using SPSS 22.0 [62] at the 0.05 statistical signiﬁcance level.

3. Results
3.1. Demographic Statistics

Table 1 shows the demographic statistics of the participants. Among the students
who had completed questionnaires, this study categorized those having engaged in self-
injurious behavior at least once on FASM as the self-injury (SI) group. Of the 516 partici-
pants, 166 were adolescents who having engaged in self-injurious behavior (32.2%) and 350
were adolescent with no experience of self-injury (67.8%). A signiﬁcant gender difference
was found in the self-harm experiences; more female students had self-injured than had

male students. More speciﬁcally, among the SI group, there were proportionally more
females than in the non-SI group.

3.2. Characteristics of Self-Injurious Behavior

Further analysis of the data of the SI group (n = 166) revealed that they had used an
average of 2.04 (SD = 1.31) methods, and on average, self-injured 6.22 times (SD = 6.50)
all their lives until survey completion. In terms of severity, the mean number of mild
self-injury was 5.07 (SD = 5.35) and of moderate self-injury was 1.15 (SD = 2.27). On
average, the number of treatments received following the self-injurious behavior was 0.53
(SD = 1.65). Table 2 lists the characteristics of methods and the frequency of self-injury. The
self-injury group reported higher rates of mild forms of self-injury in the following order:
‘biting,’ ‘hitting’, and ‘pulling hair’.

3.3. Descriptive Statistics and Correlational Analysis of Variables Relevant to Self-Injury

To explore the characteristics relevant to self-injurious behavior, this study examined
the duration of contemplation before self-injurious behavior, whether alcohol or drugs
were consumed, physical pain during self-injurious behavior, whether there was intent to
die, and the age of onset. According to the results, in the SI group, most of the participants
(72.9%) had not contemplated self-injurious behavior before, and only two participants
(1.2%) had used alcohol or drugs during self-injurious behavior. In addition, the majority

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

7 of 16

of participants (90.4%) reported no or mild pain during self-injurious behavior, and 18 par-
ticipants (10.8%) said they had had a suicidal intention, and the average age of onset of
self-injurious behavior was 12.43 (SD = 1.57). Details are shown in Table 3.

The study then investigated the relationships among variables pertinent to self-injury.
Table 4 shows the results of the correlational analysis. Higher frequency correlated with
more methods of self-injurious behavior (r = 0.84, p < 0.01) and more physical pain (r = 0.46,
p < 0.01). Longer time of contemplation correlated with more physical pain (r = 0.44,
p < 0.01). Moreover, the frequencies of mild and moderate self-injurious behavior were
positively correlated with each other (r = 0.34, p < 0.01); the number of medical treat-
ments showed a positive correlation with only the moderate form of severity (r = 0.18,
p < 0.05) among all levels. The age of onset was positively correlated with the duration of
contemplation before self-injury alone (r = 0.35, p < 0.01).

Table 5 shows the correlations among all of the key variables included in the analysis
explored after dividing the data into the SI group and the non-SI group. All the sub-factors
of depression (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) revealed positive correlations among them but
negative correlations with self-esteem (RSES) in both groups. In addition, in the SI group,
the number of self-injurious behavior was positively correlated with every sub-factor of
CDI and RCMAS, but was negatively correlated with self-esteem.

3.5. Risk Factors Relating to Self-Injurious Behavior

To uncover the risk factors affecting self-injurious behavior, this study undertook
logistic regression with the sub-factors of depression (CDI) and anxiety (RCMAS) and
self-esteem (RSES). The results showed signiﬁcant differences in the history of self-injury;
Table 7 lists these ﬁndings. The regression model was statistically signiﬁcant (χ2 = 87.21,
p < 0.001), where negative self-image in depression (B = 0.09, p < 0.05), oversensitivity
(B = 0.18, p < 0.05), and physical/sleep problems (B = 0.20, p < 0.05) in anxiety were the
signiﬁcant factors affecting self-injurious behavior.

This study investigates the conditions and aspects relevant to adolescent self-injurious
behavior in Korea local communities, and conﬁrms speciﬁc risk factors predicting self-
injury in adolescence. The main results and discussion are as follows.

Of the 516 adolescents that participated in this study, 166 (32.2%) had self-injured,
which is higher than the rates of adolescent self-injury in local communities reported
in other studies in both Korea and overseas, at approximately 20% [5,9,13]. The rise in
self-injurious behavior reported could be because of perception, as something more widely
accepted within the peer group today than it was in the past, as such behavior today
is not only to reduce negative emotions but also to earn social support and a sense of
belonging [63]. A recent study by Kim, Kim, Park, and Yoon [64] revealed that 23.7%
of self-injuring elementary schoolers had “deliberately drawn wounds resembling scars
of self-injury.” Such a ﬁnding reﬂects the possibility that adolescent self-injury is now
recognized as a sub-culture of teenage groups. Thus, early detection and intervention of
self-injurious behavior in young adolescents is more crucial than ever.

Further investigation showed that more female students had attempted self-injury
than had male students, consistent with previous research in and outside the country [9,38].
The average age of onset was 12.43, which also aligns with preceding research, reporting
self-injury ﬁrst occurring around the ages of 12–14 [4], and with other studies in Korea
reporting 12.3–13.8, as the average age of onset of self-injury [9–13]. In addition, this study
found that the percentage of mild forms of self-injury, such as “biting,” “hitting,” and
“pulling hair,” was higher than other forms. This is similar to the results of previous research
conducted in Korea, which claimed that mild forms of self-injury are more prevalent than
severe forms among local community adolescents [9,13]. In addition, results of a study on
Korean university students found that the proportion of “biting” was 62.1% among self-
harm methods, accounting for the highest share among self-harm methods [65]. Moreover,
according to a study conducted in the United States, early adult college students tend
to use mild forms of self-injury such as “biting,” “hitting,” and “picking” more than the
moderate forms [27,66]. Among the students who participated in this study, those who
acknowledged self-injury, reported that they self-injured 6.2 times, and used 2.04 methods,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

on average, over their lifetime. Such results are similar to the ﬁndings of Park et al. [13],
who reported 6.54 times of self-injury among male high school students, and Ahn and
Song [9], which revealed 7.13 times of self-injury among middle and high school students
of both genders. Among the previous studies targeting Korean adults, it is difﬁcult to note
one that speciﬁcally investigated the number of self-injuries; however, if students who
begin to self-injure in early adolescence continue to do so until adulthood, the number of
self-injuries is likely to be cumulative. Moreover, the rising trend of self-injury on social
media among teenagers suggests the formation of a new contextual factor. As sharing
self-injurious behavior on social media can possibly normalize self-injury, and continuously
encourage such behavior [67], the corresponding group of adolescents may later form a
habit and use self-injurious behavior for various purposes, as they enter late adolescence
and adulthood. Therefore, it is necessary to continue observing and researching such
phenomenon, as recent self-injurious behavior in teenagers may show different aspects
than self-injury reported in past studies targeting adults.

This study found that higher number of self-injurious behavior was associated with
more methods used and greater physical pain. However, some previous studies reported
different ﬁndings. An earlier study showed that physical pain tends to become desensitized
with repetition of self-injurious behavior [34], and a study on university students also
revealed a negative correlation between the number of self-injuries and pain during self-
injury [65]. Yet, Park et al. [13], who examined male high school students, reported a ﬁnding
similar to this current study, stating that as the number of self-injuries increase, physical
pain also increases. Such complicated results suggest that young adolescents in local
communities who repeatedly injure themselves mildly might have distinct aspects from
adults or the clinical group who severely injure themselves. Thus, further investigation is
necessary to understand these new features of self-injury in non-clinical adolescents.

In addition, this study found that more than 70% of students who engaged in self-
harm did not contemplate this behavior beforehand. This is considered to be consistent
with the results of previous studies showing that adolescents in local communities perform
self-harm in a more impulsive and habitual manner by various internal and external
triggering stimuli [9,13]. Moreover, only two participants in this sample (1.2%) had used
alcohol or substances during self-injurious behavior, which can be partly explained by
Korea having less access to drugs compared to Western countries. In this study, 10.8% of
the SI group reported suicidal intention during self-harm. This is similar to a previous
study that reported 7.0% of male and female adolescents in the self-injury group had
suicidal intentions [3]. According to a previous study conducted in Korea, notably, 32.0% of
female adolescents who engaged in self-injurious behavior reported suicidal intentions [12],
whereas 9.1% of the SI group consisting of male adolescents had suicidal intentions [13].
In future studies, it will be necessary to conﬁrm if a signiﬁcant difference in suicidal
intention during self-injurious behavior exists according to age and gender. On the other
hand, in this study, no signiﬁcant cultural differences were found between Western and
Asian countries in the form of self-injurious behavior and related characteristics. This
may be partly due to the fact that self-injurious behavior was measured in this study
using a scale (FASM) developed in a Western country. Therefore, in future studies it will be
important to develop scales that are more suitable for Korean culture so that culture-speciﬁc
self-injurious behavior can be examined.

This study also explored risk factors, showing that the negative self-image sub-factor
of depression and oversensitivity and physical/sleep problems sub-factors of anxiety best
predicted self-injurious behavior. Few studies have speciﬁcally tested relationships between
the sub-factors of depression and anxiety and the occurrence of self-injury. However, prior
studies frequently report self-punishment as a motivational factor [29,31], which partially
explains why individuals harm their physical bodies, as a coping strategy to reduce
negative affect. Those who think they are worthless and inferior tend to tolerate more pain
during self-injury [68]. Having a negative core belief about the self can reduce the tendency
to value or protect one’s physical body and eventually exacerbate psychological resistance

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

11 of 16

to self-injury or suicidal thoughts [34]. Negative perceptions of the self, such as negative
self-image, can be a signiﬁcant factor triggering self-injurious behavior. Furthermore,
teenagers in early adolescence are in a crucial period of their lives, where they develop and
integrate concepts relevant to self, and thus, the prevention and intervention of self-injury
should focus on perceiving the self positively, and developing healthy self-concepts.

The oversensitivity sub-factor of anxiety can be deﬁned as an individual being too
sensitive or nervous, become irritated or angered easily with a minor stimulus, or easily
hurt from a small event [69]. Research shows that when one shows high physical arousals
following emotionally evocative events, one can perceive corresponding stimulus more
aversively, and excited arousals can cause difﬁculties in regulating negative affect [19].
Therefore, the oversensitivity sub-factor of anxiety signiﬁcantly predicting the occurrence of
self-injury can relate to using maladaptive coping strategies, such as self-injury, effortlessly,
to terminate an aversive emotional state quickly, when an individual who becomes agitated
easily by negative affect experiences a strong unpleasant feeling.

In addition, the failure to recognize and process negative affect can cause physical
symptoms. Physical discomfort is considered to be a factor of alexithymia, and it is under-
stood as a major element provoking inappropriate coping mechanisms, such as self-injury,
when facing negative emotions [4]. Previous research shows that even after controlling
for depression symptoms, sleep problems in ages 12–14 signiﬁcantly predicted suicide
attempts and self-injurious behavior in ages 15–17 [70], and 77.0% of female adolescents
who had reported little or no sleep showed repetitive self-injurious behavior after one
year [71]. Such results emphasize the importance of considering physical symptoms and
sleep problems in preventing self-injurious behavior. Especially, sleep problems not only
reﬂect severe emotional agitation or psychological pain but also can cause unstable af-
fect [72] and can also diminish the ability to use affect regulation strategies [73]. Therefore,
sleep problems seem to be closely associated with incidents of self-injury.

In summary, teenagers in early adolescence injure themselves to ease the feeling of
inadequacy caused by negative self-perception or to relieve negative emotions induced
by multiple psychosocial stresses. These characteristics, combined with their unstable
self-image and affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood were identiﬁed as
risk factors, which are also consistent with the diagnostic characteristics of BPD. Previous
studies on adolescents or early adults also showed that these characteristics of BPD are
strongly related to self-harm behavior [74]. This study did not consider the aspects of
personality disorder, but further studies are needed to explore these aspects. The results of
this study suggest that it is important to evaluate the negative self-image, irritability, and
physical/sleep problems within the group experiencing depression and anxiety symptoms
in order to understand the risk of self-harm.
In addition to the ﬁndings of previous
studies that negative self-image and irritability have associations with self-injury among
adolescents [75,76], we found that physical and sleep problems are important risk factors
in self-injury among adolescents. In particular, in the case of adolescents’ sleep problems,
the relationship with suicidal ideation has been explored in Korea [77], but it is noteworthy
that this study revealed the relationship between sleep problems and actual self-harm
behavior in early adolescents.

Previous research states that as attempts to avoid negative affect become chronic,
individuals experience that the aversive affect is more strong and frequent, making it harder
to learn new and adaptive ways to process unpleasant emotions. Consequently, it creates a
vicious cycle, where one repeatedly uses maladaptive methods involving avoiding negative
emotional experiences [19]. Adolescence is a period known for vulnerability in affect
regulation, and thus, it is a crucial time to develop coping mechanisms to regulate various
emotions effectively [78]. Therefore, guiding teenagers to develop a healthy and available
coping skill, as an alternative to self-injuring, will be helpful in effectively preventing and
reducing adolescent self-injury. For intervention, applying treatments such as dialectical
behavior therapy (DBT), which provides techniques to develop a positive self-image,
interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation skills [79], and cognitive behavioral

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

12 of 16

therapy (CBT), which helps to modify negative self-image [80], can reduce self-injury
among adolescents in the early stages and further decrease the risk of suicide. Moreover,
Whitlock et al. [69] stated that adolescents form mutual relationships and experience social
support on social media by sharing information on self-injury and seeking help. Such
results suggest that it is essential to include elements enhancing social connectedness
among others on top of reinforcing coping skills, in terms of intervention. Peer relationship
becomes a key value in early adolescence, which is when the urge to belong to or ﬁnd
acceptance by peer groups becomes intense. Therefore, it is necessary to help adolescents
deal with feelings of frustration and isolation by letting them share their feelings, and
receive support from others through some means other than self-injury. To do so, it is
necessary to prepare the school and home environments where they can express their
emotional difﬁculties and ﬁnd support, in advance.

This current study ﬁnds that low self-esteem did not signiﬁcantly predict the incidence
of self-injury. Prior studies have reported that self-esteem has some moderating effects on
the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behavior [81]. Considering such ﬁndings,
to conﬁrm the effects of self-esteem on self-injury, it is essential to replicate this research
by examining the relationships among intra- and interpersonal variables from multiple
aspects in future studies.

This study has some limitations and suggestions for future studies. First, the surveys
in this study targeted sixth graders in elementary school to third graders in middle school;
however, the sample contained only a few elementary schoolers. Therefore, the results
of this study reﬂect only a small amount of data of self-injury in younger adolescents.
Secondly, the low value of internal consistency of the FASM should be noted as one of
limitations in the present study. This might be due to the use of the subscale of the FASM;
we only included the ﬁrst part of the FASM consisting of 11 items, which might affect the
low reliability of the measurement. Indeed, Cronbach’s alpha is known to be related to the
number of items included [82–84]. Future studies should use the full range of the scale to
consider the full characteristics of self-injurious behavior. According to Lloyd et al. [53], the
reliability of all 39 questions of the FASM was reported as 0.88. Third, this study focused
on some speciﬁc psychological factors that would have predicted self-injurious behavior
in early adolescents; however, other previous studies suggested that various intra- and
interpersonal variables show meaningful relationships with self-injurious behavior [4,38].
In addition, according to Laukkanen et al. [85], drug abuse such as frequent consumption
of alcohol and legal drugs increased the risk of self-harm in adolescents aged 13–18 years.
Although we investigated the use of alcohol during self-harm, the relationship between
drug-related problems and self-harm was not addressed in this study. Future research
should include more variables known to signiﬁcantly affect self-injurious behavior and
explore the predictive powers of such variables in detail. In addition, because prior studies
ﬁnd gender differences in risk factors of self-injurious behavior [86], future research may
examine the risk factors predicting self-injury for each gender, thereby, providing some
useful data for the prevention and treatment of self-injurious behavior. Finally, in this study,
intrapersonal variables related to self-injurious behavior were measured using self-report
questionnaires. However, according to a previous study using FMRI, adolescents with non-
suicidal self-injury tended to show signiﬁcantly stronger brain response in the amygdala
and decreased activity in the frontal cortex to emotional stimuli [87]. Moreover, it has been
reported that various forms of impulsiveness (e.g., affective, cognitive, and behavioral
impulsivity) are related to adolescents’ self-harm behavior [88]. Therefore, in future
research, it is necessary to additionally explore cognitive and temperamental characteristics
(e.g., frontal lobe function and impulsiveness) related to adolescents’ self-harm by applying
various research methodologies such as brain imaging research and experiments.

Despite the limitations of the present study, it has several implications. Given the
high prevalence of self-harm behaviors in early adolescents, it provides a meaningful
message for mental health professionals to acknowledge the importance of early detection
and intervention for the prevention of adolescents’ self-harm. Acknowledging no proper

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 1955

assessment tool to detect, especially, early adolescents’ self-harm behaviors, it might
be helpful to develop a sensitive screening tool reﬂecting high frequencies of self-harm
behaviors reported by early adolescents. Based on our ﬁndings, clinical intervention
strategies should focus on the modiﬁcation of negative self-image, emotional dysregulation,
and sleep problems using DBT and CBT.

5. Conclusions

This study shows that the prevalence of self-injurious behavior among adolescents
in Korea was reported to be somewhat higher than in previous studies, and it can be
regarded to reﬂect that self-injury has been recognized as a more common phenomenon
in adolescents nowadays. As a result of the study, negative self-image, oversensitivity,
and physical/sleep problems were identiﬁed as risk factors for adolescent self-harm. This
implies the need to assess the risk of self-harm early and intervene through an evaluation
focused on self-image and emotional instability in adolescents.
