ABSTRACT
Aim:  People  living  with  HIV  (PLWH)  have  an  increased  risk  for  lifetime  trauma  and  mental  health 
difficulties.  However,  no  studies  have  evaluated  stress-related  genes  in  relation  to  early-life  adversity, 
lifetime  trauma,  or  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  in  PLWH.
Methods: Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, we evaluated DNA methylation (DNAm) in intron 7 of FKBP5, 
a glucocorticoid feedback regulator, and in the promoter of SLC6A4, the serotonin transporter gene, in 
whole blood of a random sample of 70 PLWH recruited from an HIV program, and 51 individuals 2 years 
later  (n = 48  at  both  time  points).  Exploratory  regression  analyses  were  conducted  with  DNAm  in 
relation  to  trauma  exposure,  mental  health  symptoms,  and  coping  strategies.
Results: Higher DNAm at one site of SLC6A4 was associated with lower levels of anxiety (B = −0.62 (SE = 0.23), 
p = 0.0109),  depression  (B = −0.06  (SE = 0.03),  p = 0.0435),  and  PTSD  symptoms  at  baseline  (B = −0.03 
(SE  =  0.01),  p = 0.0374).  DNAm  at  FKBP5  was  negatively  associated  with  measures  of  anxiety  (B = −0.30 
(SE = 0.07), p = 0.0001) and depression symptoms (B = −0.2 (SE = 0.10), p = 0.0103). Various coping strategies 
were also associated with sites in both genes across time points, e.g. self-blame and substance use.
Conclusion:  Our  findings  generate  intriguing  hypotheses  linking  mental  health  symptoms  and  DNA 
methylation,  to  be  replicated  with  larger  samples.

PLAIN  LANGUAGE  SUMMARY
Many  people  living  with  HIV  experience  high  levels  of  trauma  and  mental  health  difficulties  in  their 
lifetime.  One  way  in  which  this  trauma  may  affect  mental  health,  is  through  a  process  called 
epigenetics,  in  which  chemical  changes  are  made  to  the  DNA  in  response  to  different  exposures. 
Small  chemical  groups  called  methyl  groups  are  placed  onto  a  cytosine  (the  C  in  our  DNA),  which 
can  modify  how  available  the  DNA  is  to  be  expressed  into  a  protein.  These  methylation  patterns  at 
stress-related  genes  can  essentially  tune  up  or  down  a  body’s  response  to  a  stressor.  In  our  study, 
we  examined  how  these  methylation  differences  at  important  regulatory  locations  in  stress-related 
genes  may  be  related  to  exposure  to  lifetime  histories  of  trauma,  as  well  as  symptoms  of  depres-
sion,  anxiety,  and  perceived  stress,  and  various  coping  strategies  people  use  to  deal  with  trauma  or 
stress,  such  as  humor,  denial,  self-blame,  or  substance  use.  We  found  that  higher  DNA  methylation 
levels  at  multiple  positions  in  the  two  studied  genes  were  related  to  lower  levels  of  symptoms  of 
anxiety,  depression,  and  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  in  a  population  of  adults  living  with 
HIV.  Some  of  the  coping  strategies,  such  as  self-blame  and  substance  use,  were  also  related  to  DNA 
methylation  at  both  studied  genes.  These  findings  indicate  that  epigenetic  differences  may  con-
tribute  to  mental  health  symptoms  in  people  with  HIV.

1. Introduction

People living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected by 
traumatic  experiences  and  are  at  an  elevated  risk  for  mental 
health  difficulties  compared  to  the  general  population  [1,2]. 
The prevalence of depression among PLWH is nearly twice that 
of  the  general  population  [3–5].  The  prevalence  of  anxiety  dis-
orders  is  also  higher  among  PLWH  compared  to  the  general 
population  [6–8].  Previous  work  has  suggested  that  higher 
rates  of  depression  and  anxiety  among  PLWH  are  related  to 

lower  levels  of  social  support  [9,10],  internalized  stigma  [11], 
sociodemographic  factors  [12,13],  substance  use  [14],  and 
health-related fears [15]. Individuals with HIV also face a greater 
risk of developing PTSD, with global estimates ranging from 25% 
to  35%,  depending  on  screening  or  diagnostic  tool  utilization 
[11,16]. However, PLWH also benefit from coping strategies that 
alleviate  mental  health  symptoms  [17,18].  Given  that  lifetime 
histories  of  trauma  and  mental  health  difficulties  are  linked  to

Article  highlights

● This study investigated relationships between whole-blood DNA methy-
lation  of  two  stress-related  genes,  FKBP5  and  SLC6A4,  and  different 
models  of  trauma  exposure,  as  well  as  coping  and  mental  health 
symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH) at two time points.

● Higher  DNAm  at  one  site  in  the  promoter  of  SLC6A4  was  associated 
with  lower  levels  of  anxiety,  depression,  and  PTSD  symptoms  at 
baseline.

● DNAm  at  intron  7  of  FKBP5  was  negatively  associated  with  measures 

of  anxiety  and  depression  symptoms.

● Coping  strategies  such  as  self-blame  and  substance  use  were  also 
associated  with  various  sites  in  these  genes  across  both  time  points.
● Our  findings  highlight  an  epigenetic  mechanism  for  the  potential 

embodiment  of  mental  health  in  PLWH.

health risk behaviors [19], poor medication adherence [20], and 
HIV  progression  [21],  further  developing  our  understanding  of 
how lifetime trauma, mental health, and coping become embo-
died in people with HIV is crucial to improving health outcomes 
for PLWH.

One  suggested  pathway  through  which  lifetime  trauma 
may  affect  health  and  well-being  is  through  the  biological 
mechanism of  epigenetics. One  commonly studied  epigenetic 
mechanism is DNA methylation (DNAm) usually found at cyto-
sines  followed  by  guanines  (CpG  sites)  in  the  DNA.  DNA 
methylation  can  be  sensitive  to  environmental  exposures, 
such  as  lifetime  trauma  [22–25].  A  growing  body  of  evidence 
demonstrates  that  epigenetics  may  mediate  associations 
between  trauma,  particularly  during  childhood,  and  increase 
the  risk  of  adverse  physical  and  mental  health  outcomes  [26– 
29]. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) 
axis  and  serotonergic  neurotransmission  has  been  linked  to 
several  psychiatric  conditions 
[30–33].  Candidate  gene 
approaches for investigating molecular pathways that mediate 
relationships  between  environmental  exposures,  such  as  life-
time  trauma,  and  mental  health  difficulties  have  primarily 
focused  on  DNA  methylation  at  stress-related  genes  impli-
cated  in  regulating  glucocorticoid  signaling  and  serotonergic 
neurotransmission,  such as  NR3C1  [24,34],  SLC6A4  [35,36],  and 
FKBP5  [22,37,38]. Directions of effect in these studies are often 
inconsistent, potentially due to differences in tissue studied or 
timing  of  measurements  [39,40].  Further,  the  timing  of  critical 
windows  of  exposure  has  not  been  fully  resolved,  and  may 
vary  by  exposure,  gene  region,  and  disease  outcome  [41,42].

Despite  high  levels  of  trauma  among  PLWH,  coping 
strategies  can  help  improve  health  behaviors  and  overall 
health  outcomes  [43,44].  Coping  can  be  broadly  defined 
as  minimizing  distress  associated  with  adverse  life  experi-
ences.  Coping  strategies  are  often  classified  in  various 
ways;  one  way  is  to  group  them  as  dysfunctional  or  adap-
tive  [45].  Research  on  the  direct  relationship  between 
DNAm  and  coping  is  limited,  but  adaptive  coping  may 
buffer  the  effects  of  depression  and  anxiety,  potentially 
mitigating  stress-related  epigenetic  changes  [34,46,47].

FKBP5  has become a target gene of interest for investigating 
molecular pathways that mediate the relationship between life-
time trauma and mental health difficulties [22,30], as it is a gene 
that  moderates  the  glucocorticoid  receptor  (GR)  sensitivity  and 
HPA-axis  regulation  [48].  Multiple  studies  have  found  lower 

methylation  at  intron  7  of  FKBP5  in  peripheral  blood  to  be 
associated  with  childhood  trauma  and  psychiatric  diseases 
[22,49]. In contrast, Harms et al. [50] found that childhood stress 
was associated with higher FKBP5 methylation at sites in intron 2 
and intron 5 in adult saliva, while a study of Chinese adolescents 
failed  to  identify  any  associations  between  promoter  region 
methylation  and  anxiety  symptoms  [51].  Other  studies  have 
found  associations  between  FKBP5  methylation  and  depressive 
symptoms  [52],  as  well  as  structural  changes  of  the  brain  in 
individuals with major depressive disorder [53].

SLC6A4’s  role  in  regulating  the  neurotransmission  of  ser-
otonin  has  led  it  to  become  a  gene  of  interest  for  exploring 
associations  between  methylation,  trauma  exposure,  and 
mental  health  difficulties.  A  study  examining  SLC6A4  methy-
lation 
in  blood  drawn  from  100  adults  of  the  Detroit 
Neighborhood  Health  Study  found  lower  SLC6A4  promoter 
methylation  mediated  the  relationship  between  the  number 
of  traumatic  events  experienced  and  PTSD  [36].  Another 
study  found  the  opposite  direction  of  effect,  such  that 
resilience  factors  were  associated  with  lower  SLC6A4  promo-
ter  methylation  in  saliva  of  Latinx  mothers  and  children, 
while  stress  factors  were  associated  with  higher  methylation 
[47].  The  same  direction  of  effect  was  found  in  leukocytes  of 
adults  reporting  childhood  adversities,  higher  perceived 
stress,  and  a  greater  family  history  of  depression  had  higher 
SLC6A4  methylation  [35].

Prior  epigenetics  research  with  PLWH  has  primarily  focused 
on identifying differences in epigenome-wide methylation with 
infection  status  or  viral  load  [54,55].  These  studies  have  shown 
that sites near or within immune-related genes were significantly 
associated with HIV infection [54,55]. While epigenetic aging has 
been shown to be accelerated with HIV [56–58], no studies have 
yet 
lifetime 
trauma, mental health symptoms, or coping strategies in PLWH. 
Given  the  high  prevalence  of  mental  health  difficulties  and 
higher  levels  of  lifetime  trauma  among  PLWH,  it  is  essential  to 
explore the relationship between DNAm of stress-related genes, 
trauma, mental health symptoms, and coping in PLWH.

investigated  the  associations  between  DNAm, 

The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  asso-
ciations  between  DNAm  of  FKBP5  and  SLC6A4,  trauma  expo-
sure,  and  mental  health  symptoms  in  PLWH  using  whole 
blood  samples  drawn  at  two  time  points.  Different  models 
of  lifetime  trauma  were  used to  test  different  hypotheses  on 
relevant  periods  of  exposure.  Furthermore,  this  study  aimed 
to  address  the  role  of  coping  strategies  and  their  relation-
ship  to  FKBP5  and  SLC6A4  DNAm.  We  hypothesized  that 
childhood  trauma  would  be  the  most  critical  period  of 
exposure  for  epigenetic  changes  and  that  higher  levels  of 
overall  lifetime  trauma,  along  with  lower  levels  of  adaptive 
coping,  would  be  associated  with  altered  DNA  methylation. 
However,  given  inconsistencies  in  prior  literature,  expected 
directions  of  effect  are  difficult  to  predict.

2. Materials  and  methods

2.1. Study  population

The  study  sample  was  drawn  from  an  HIV  program 
in 
a  suburban  area  using  a  random  sampling  procedure.  Self- 

report  survey  data  were  collected  at  two  time  points  nearly  2 
years  apart  (between  2019  and  2021).  The  first  time  point  is 
referred to as the “baseline,” and the second as the “follow-up” 
for  the  remainder  of  the  study.  Whole  blood  samples  were 
collected  at  baseline  between  March  2019  and  March  2020, 
and  follow-up  whole  blood  samples  were  collected  between 
August  2020  and  December  2021.  The  original  sample  con-
sisted of 70 individuals living with HIV (mean age 50 years, SD  
= 12.6)  at  baseline.  At  the  two-year  follow-up,  48  of  the  70 
baseline  participants  provided  an  additional  sample,  and  four 
new  participants  provided  a  sample  only  at  follow-up,  for 
a total of 52 samples at the follow-up time point. Baseline self- 
reported  demographic  characteristics 
included  age,  self- 
reported  sex,  and  self-reported  race  (pooled  into  three  cate-
gories of Black, White, and Other, based on small sample sizes 
for  other  groups).  All  baseline  samples  were  collected  before 
the  COVID  pandemic,  and  all  but  one  sample  at  follow-up 
were  collected  after  the  COVID-19  pandemic  began.  All  study 
protocols  were  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  at 
Hofstra/Northwell  Health  with  approval  number  18–0660.

2.2. Psychosocial  measures

Psychosocial  stressors  were  measured  using  a  variety  of 
assessments  administered  at  baseline  and 
follow-up. 
Participants  completed  the  Trauma  History  Questionnaire 
(THQ),  a  psychometrically  validated  instrument  [59,60]  that 
covers  a  wide  range  of  potentially  traumatic  events  that  may 
meet  Criterion  A1  of  the  DSM-V-TR  [61],  required  for  the 
diagnosis of PTSD. For this study, investigators operationalized 
the THQ scale into five different measures. First, a total trauma 
scale  comprised  a  sum  of  cumulative  traumatic  events  for 
participants  not  missing  data 
items 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82, indicating high internal consistency). 
Next,  the  sum  of  repeated  events  (1  if  repeated,  0  if  not), 
a sum of recent events (past 5 years), and a sum of childhood 
events (events occurring <18 years of age) was calculated. For 
all  the  summed  scales,  categorical  versions  were  created,  and 
they  were  coded  as  “1”  if  they  had  any  trauma  within  each 
respective  category  (recent  vs.  childhood  vs.  repeated)  or  “0” 
if  not.

for  two  or  more 

Participants were also administered the most recent version 
of  the  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  Checklist  for  the  DSM-5 
(PLC-5)  to  measure  past-month  PTSD  symptoms  [62].  The 
Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder  Checklist  is  a  validated  and 
widely  used  self-report  measure  for  diagnosing  PTSD.  The 
National  Center  for  PTSD  recommends  using  a  cut-point 
score  between  31  and  33  for  an  indication  of  probable  PTSD 
[63].  A  cut-point  of  31  was  used  to  determine  PTSD  sympto-
mology; however, the PCL-5 was coded solely as a continuous 
variable  for  all  analyses.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using 
the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-4  (PHQ-4  [64]).  The  PHQ-4 
consists  of  anxiety  and  depression  subscales,  and  the  total 
score  reflects  the  overall  symptom  burden.  Each  of  the  PHQ- 
4  subscales  was  analyzed  separately.

Stress  was  measured  using  the  Perceived  Stress  Scale-10 
(PSS),  which  was  developed  to  measure  the  extent  to  which 
respondents  found  their  lives  “unpredictable,  uncontrollable,

and  overloading”  [65].  A  higher  PSS  score  indicated  higher 
stress  levels  and  was  used  as  a  continuous  variable.

2.3. Coping  strategies

Coping  strategies  were  measured  using  the  Brief-COPE  [45]. 
Each  of  the  14  dimensions,  or  coping  strategies,  was  sepa-
rately  assessed  for  analyses  using  the  Brief-COPE.  These 
include  emotion-focused  coping  (acceptance,  emotional  sup-
port,  humor,  positive  reframing,  and  religion),  problem- 
focused  coping  (active  coping,  planning,  and  instrumental 
support),  and  dysfunctional  strategies  (self-distraction,  denial, 
venting,  substance  use,  behavioral  disengagement,  and  self- 
blame).

2.4. Generation  of  DNAm  data

DNA from previously collected whole blood samples was ana-
lyzed to  determine DNA  methylation levels for sample partici-
pants.  Following  standard  protocols,  DNA  was  first  isolated 
and  purified  using  Qiagen’s  QIAamp  Blood  Midi  Kit,  and  the 
concentration  and  purity  of  the  DNA  were  assessed  using 
a  Qubit  Fluorometric  Quantification  System  and  a  Nanodrop 
Spectrophotometer.  Then,  250  ng  of  DNA  were  bisulfite  con-
verted  in  duplicate  using  Zymo’s  EZ  DNA  Methylation-GoldTM 
kit  protocols.  All  bisulfite-treated  samples  were  amplified  via 
polymerase-chain reaction using an EpigenDXTM-designed pri-
mer for FKBP5, which amplifies sites within bin 2 of intron 7 as 
referenced in Klengel et al [22]. Positive and negative controls 
were used for each PCR, all assays were validated with known 
methylation controls prior to use, and gel electrophoresis was 
used  to  determine  if  each  sample  was  amplified  successfully 
and without contamination. Each successfully amplified dupli-
cate  for  FKBP5  was  pyrosequenced  using  Qiagen’s  Pyromark 
Q24.  For  assaying  methylation  at  SLC6A4,  optimized  primers 
were used to amplify the DNA [66], and successfully amplified 
duplicates  for  SLC6A4  were  sent  to  EpigenDXTM  for  pyrose-
quencing  using  the  Qiagen  Pyromark  Q96.  Primer  sequences 
and  chromosomal  locations  of  assayed  sites  can  be  found  in 
Supplementary  Figure  S1.  Of  the  original  70  baseline  and  52 
follow-up  samples,  DNA  was  successfully  assayed  for  all  but 
one  sample  at  follow-up  for  FKBP5  and  for  69  samples  at 
baseline  and  51  at  follow-up  for  SLC6A4,  though  numbers 
ranged  across  CpG  sites.  The  percent  methylation  values  we 
report  are  direct  estimates  from  bisulfite  pyrosequencing, 
which  are  comparable  to  the  Beta  values  reported  in  most 
Illumina  microarray  studies.

2.5. Data  analysis

Summary  statistics  for  each  demographic  and  relevant  health 
factor  from  each  time  point  were  calculated.  Because  not  all 
variables  are  normally  distributed,  non-parametric  tests  were 
used  to  compare  mean  differences  at  each  time  point.  We 
tested  for  changes  between  the  groups  at  each  time  point 
using  primarily  unpaired  tests  due  to  high  loss  to  follow-up, 
and  non-parametric  tests  for  the  non-normally  distributed 
data. Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare mean differ-
ences  at  each  time  point  for  continuous  variables,  and  chi- 

300

square  tests  were  used  to  compare  the  categorical  variables 
across  time  points.  Wilcoxon  signed  rank  (paired)  tests  were 
used  to  test  for  stability  of  methylation  data  over  time  within 
the  same  individuals.  Bivariate  Spearman  correlations  were 
tested at each time point to explore the relationships between 
all  factors  that  may  influence  methylation,  including  demo-
graphics,  health  factors  (e.g.,  CD4  counts,  smoking),  coping 
measures,  mental  health  measures,  and  trauma  measures. 
Based  on  these  findings,  and  theoretical  considerations  of 
factors that are known to influence methylation (e.g., smoking 
[67]), we selected covariates to include in the regression mod-
els. For example, because HIV-related health variables, such as 
cell counts or viral load, were not correlated with methylation 
at  either  gene  (Supplementary  Tables  S1  and  S2),  we  did  not 
include  these  in  the  presented  regression  models.  Similarly, 
because heavy alcohol use and recreational drug use were not 
significantly  associated  with  methylation  at  either  gene,  we 
did  not  include  these  behaviors  in  the  subsequent  analyses 
(Supplementary  Tables  S3  and  S4).  The  exploratory  multiple 
linear  regressions  were  conducted  with  the  dependent  vari-
able  of  DNA  methylation  at  each  CpG  site  or  the  average 
across  sites,  controlling  for  covariates  of  age,  sex  (male  as 
the  reference  group),  race  (White  as  the  reference  group),

and  current  smoking  status.  Diagnostic  plots  and  normality 
tests of residuals were run to test for model fit, and all models 
met  the  assumptions  of  linear  regressions.  Because  of  the 
exploratory  nature  of  the  paper,  and  the  fact  that  all  tested 
sites  are  not  independent,  we  opted  not  to  include  multiple 
testing  corrections  in  this  study.

3. Results

3.1. Demographics

Demographic and  health characteristics  of 70 baseline  and 51 
follow-up samples are shown in Table 1. At baseline, the mean 
age  of  the  sample  was  50.5 years;  24%  were  female,  the 
majority  were  born  in  the  U.S.  (72%),  most  participants  had 
a  household  income  of  less  than  $93,000.  Regarding  health 
characteristics at  baseline, 40%  of the  sample had  a history of 
AIDS,  but  only  6%  had  a  detectable  viral  load,  with  similar 
proportions  at  follow-up.  At  both  time  points,  18%  screened 
positive  for  PTSD  upon  completion  of  the  PCL-5.  Current 
smoking  (19%  baseline  vs  10%  follow-up),  heavy  alcohol  use 
(monthly  or  more  frequent,  7%  vs  9%),  and  recreational  drug

and  follow-up  time  points.

Lifetime  Trauma  History  data  are  shown  in  Table  1  and 
Supplementary  Table  S5.  At  baseline,  44%  reported  experi-
ences  of  childhood  trauma  (<18 years  old),  47%  reported 
experiencing  a  recent  traumatic  event  (within  5  years),  and 
56%  reported  repeated  exposure  to  any  traumatic  event.  The 
most frequently reported types of trauma were receiving news 
of  a  serious  injury,  life-threatening  illness,  or  unexpected 
death  of  someone  close  (53%)  and  ever  having  a  serious  or 
life-threatening  illness  (47%).

3.2. Methylation  levels  over  time

Mean  methylation  values  were  very  similar  across  time  points 
in  both  measured  genes  (Table  2).  Values  at  FKBP5  sites  were 
high  (>90%),  while  values  at  SLC6A4  sites  were  relatively  low 
(<10%), consistent with expected levels based on prior studies 
in  blood  at  both  genes  [22,66].

3.3. Correlations  among  study  variables

There were numerous correlations of key study variables with 
DNA  methylation  at  both  time  points  in  SLC6A4,  but  only  at 
the follow-up time point within FKBP5  (Supplementary Tables 
S6  and  S7).  Specifically,  at  baseline,  methylation  at  various 
sites within SLC6A4  was negatively correlated with PTSD, PSS, 
anxiety,  and  depression  symptoms,  and  some  coping 
mechanisms,  including  humor  and  self-blame.  At  follow-up, 
sites  within  FKBP5  correlated  negatively  with  anxiety  and  the 
coping  strategy  of  acceptance.  In  contrast,  various  sites 
within  SLC6A4  correlated  positively  with  overall  trauma, 
repeated  trauma,  and  acceptance  coping  but  negatively 
with  depression  and  self-blame  coping 
(Supplementary 
Table  S7).

3.4. Baseline  regression  results  for  FKBP5

In  linear  regression  models  at  baseline,  adjusted  for  the  cov-
ariates of age, sex, self-identified race, and smoking status, we 
identified  no  significant  associations  between  methylation  at 
FKBP5  and lifetime history of trauma, regardless of how it was 
repeated  vs.

between  humor  and  FKBP5  methylation  at  CpG1  [B:  −0.31 
(0.15),  p = 0.0394;  adj  R2 = 0.102],  such  that  those  who  used 
humor  more  often  as  a  coping  strategy  had  lower  DNAm  at 
this  site.  None  of  the  demographics  or  smoking  covariates 
were  associated  with  methylation  at  this  gene  region.

3.5. Baseline  regression  results  for  SLC6A4

In  linear  regression  models  at  baseline,  adjusted  for  the  same 
demographics  as  in  models of  FKBP5,  we  identified significant 
negative  associations  between  average  SLC6A4  methylation 
and  depressive  symptoms  [B:  −0.35  (0.13),  p = 0.0082],  PTSD 
symptoms  [B:  −0.03  (0.01),  p = 0.0374],  perceived  stress  [B: 
−0.06  (0.03),  p = 0.0435],  and  coping  strategies  of  self-blame 
[B:  −0.43  (0.19),  p = 0.0344]  and  humor  [B:  −0.43  (0.21), 
p  =  0.0151]  (Supplementary  Figure  S2).  These  associations 
were  also  significant  at  individual  CpG  sites,  including  CpG  1, 
2,  4,  and  6  (Table  3).  Total  repeat  trauma  was  also  negatively 
associated  with  methylation  only  at  CpG4  [B:  −0.22  (0.11), 
p  =  0.0423],  and  anxiety  was  negatively  associated  with 
methylation  only  at  CpG  1  [B:-0.62  (0.23),  p = 0.0109].  Of  the 
covariates  included,  only  smoking  status  was  associated  with 
methylation  at  baseline.

3.6. Follow-up  regression  results  for  FKBP5

In  linear  regression  models,  none  of  the  trauma  variables 
were  associated  with  FKBP5  methylation  at  either  site  or 
across  the  average  of  sites  (Table  4).  Methylation  across 
the  average  of  both  CpG  sites  was  negatively  associated 
with  anxiety  symptoms  [B:  −0.30  (0.07),  p = 0.0001],  depres-
sion  symptoms  [B:  −0.26  (0.10),  p = 0.0103],  and  the  coping 
strategy  of 
(0.16),  p = 0.0287] 
(Supplementary  Figure  S3).  Significant  negative  associations 
were  also  identified  at  individual  CpG  sites  with  these  same 
variables, as well as with various coping strategies, including 
substance  use,  acceptance,  and  self-distraction  (Table  4). 
The  only  covariate  associated  with  methylation  at  this  time

associated  with  methylation  at  CpG4,  but  not  after  removing 
one influential outlier. Methylation at CpG1 is marginally nega-
tively associated with depression symptoms [B: −0.71 (0.35), p  
= 0.0494].  Methylation  at  CpG3  is  marginally  negatively  asso-
ciated  with  venting  [B:  −0.71  (0.35),  p = 0.0497].  The  only 
covariate  associated  with  methylation  at  this  time  point  was

4. Discussion

This  study  explored  the  relationships  between  DNA  methyla-
tion  at  two  stress-related  genes  (FKBP5  and  SLC6A4)  and  var-
ious  stress,  trauma,  resilience,  and  health  factors.  To  our 

knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  to  investigate  SLC6A4  and 
FKBP5  methylation  in  PLWH  and  the  first  to  explore  the  rela-
tionship  between  coping  strategies  and  methylation  at  these 
genes.  This  study  also  represents  a  unique  opportunity  for 

investigation  of  lifetime  trauma  and  its  mental  health  and 
epigenetic  correlates,  as  PLWH  tend  to  report  high  levels  of 
trauma  and  high  mental  health  risk  [1,2],  as  was  identified  in 
our  study  as  well.  Associations  were  found  between  methyla-
tion  at  both  genes  and  mental  health  symptoms,  including 
depression  and  anxiety,  and  various  coping  strategies,  includ-
ing  self-blame,  humor,  and  substance  use.  Additional  associa-
tions were also identified with SLC6A4 methylation and various 
measures  of  trauma.  While  many  of  these  associations  were 
not  always  consistent  across  time  points,  potentially  due  to 
small  sample  sizes  at  follow-up,  these  findings  point  to  a  role 
for  methylation  in  the  embodiment  of  trauma  and  mental 
health  in  PLWH.

Below,  we  further  describe  the  implications  of  these  explora-
tory findings, how they relate to similar studies on the epigenetics 
of stress, trauma, and resilience, and how this study contributes to 
the hypothesis that epigenetic differences have a role in contribut-
ing to the impact of stress and trauma on health.

4.1. Stress,  trauma,  and  mental  health

Though FKBP5  methylation was not associated with trauma at 
either  time  point,  we  identified  several  associations  with 
SLC6A4  methylation  and  various  trauma  models  at  both  time 
points.  At  baseline,  we  found  reduced  methylation  associated 
with  greater  levels  of  repeated  trauma,  PTSD,  and  perceived 
stress, which are consistent with prior findings by Koenen and 
colleagues  [36],  who  found  lower  methylation  at  this  gene  in 
blood  mediated  the  relation  of  traumatic  events  with  PTSD, 
and  lower  methylation  was  also  found  in  maternal  leukocytes 
and cord blood in mothers with depression during pregnancy 
[66].  However,  some  prior  studies  have  also  found  opposite 
directions  of  effect,  when  measured  across  different  tissues 
and  populations  [35,47].  Interpretation  of  our  findings  is  lim-
ited  by  small  sample  sizes,  particularly  at  follow-up.

It  was  also  intriguing  that  mental  health  symptoms  of 
depression  and  anxiety  were  associated  with  methylation  at 
both  genes  and  across  time  points  at  SLC6A4.  The  negative 
associations  between  FKBP5  methylation  and  depression  and 
anxiety  symptoms  at  follow-up  are  consistent  with  prior  find-
ings  of  decreased  FKBP5  methylation  at  these  same  loci  in 
association  with  greater  exposure  to  trauma  or  childhood 
adversity  [22,68,69],  and  higher  expression  has  been  linked 
[22]. 
with  greater 
Because  cortisol  binding  can  lead  to  decreased  methylation 
levels  at  the  regulatory  element  in  intron  7  of  FKBP5,  thereby 
increasing  the  expression  of  this  gene,  this  mechanism  can 
ultimately  dampen  the  feedback  regulation  of  the  HPA  axis 
[48,71].

levels  of  depression 

[70],  and  PTSD 

At  both  time  points,  we  identified  a  negative  association 
between  SLC6A4  methylation  and  depression  symptoms, 
which  was  also  in  the  same  direction  as  identified  in  prior 
studies [36]. SLC6A4 is responsible for producing the serotonin 
transporter  (5-HTT)  that  removes  serotonin  (5-HT)  from  the 
synaptic  cleft  [72].  Methylation  at  SLC6A4  is  an  important 
biological  mechanism  for  regulating  serotonin  transporter 
availability,  which  is  well  established  as  relevant  to  mental 
health  outcomes  [31,72].

4.2. Coping  strategies

To  our  knowledge,  no  prior  studies  have  investigated  the 
relationship  between  coping  strategies  outlined  in  the  Brief- 
COPE  and  methylation  at  any  stress-related  genes.  We  identi-
fied  several  associations  between  various  sites  in  each  gene 
and  multiple-coping  strategies  across  time  points,  including 
emotion-focused coping strategies, such as humor and accep-
tance,  and  avoidance-focused  coping  strategies,  such  as  self- 
distraction  and  substance  use.  While  these  findings  provide 
valuable insights, it is important to note that the results varied 
across CpG sites and time points, and directions of effect were 
not  always  as  expected.  However,  associations  with  coping 
may  simply  result  from  more  frequent  experiences  of  trauma 
or  stress  that  facilitate  the  use  of  different  coping  strategies, 
and  thus,  the  association  with  coping  may  simply  be 
a  byproduct  of  high  levels  of  trauma.  Prior  studies  have  also 
shown  that  seemingly  adaptive  or  positive  strategies  may  not 
always yield straightforward or positive health outcomes, such 
as  higher  blood  pressure  has  been  found  with  greater  vigi-
lance  among  African  Americans  [73]. More  research  is  needed 
to  distinguish 
trauma  and  coping  on 
methylation.

4.3. HIV-Related  potential  confounders

Previous research has shown that HIV infection is associated with 
an increased epigenetic age [56–58]. Medication adherence has 
also  been  associated  with  slower  epigenetic  aging  [74].  While 
these studies are beneficial for understanding the pathogenesis 
and treatment of HIV, changes in epigenetic aging could also be 
related  to  higher  levels  of  inflammation  resulting  from  higher 
levels  of  stress  [75,76].  Additionally,  prior  studies  among  PLWH 
have primarily focused on CpGs near or within immune-related 
genes and have identified associations between methylation at 
these loci and HIV infection [54,55]. However, no studies have yet 
investigated methylation at stress-related genes in people living 
with HIV. We found no associations between HIV-related health 
variables and methylation at either gene, even after adjusting for 
potential confounding factors that may occur with active infec-
tions  (e.g.,  white  blood  cell  counts).  This  outcome  was  unex-
pected,  given  that  HIV  typically  alters  immune  cell  levels. 
However, 94% of the participants in our study had undetectable 
levels of viral load, and 93% had high adherence to antiretroviral 
medications,  which  may  have  reduced  their  relevance  in  this 
sample.  Further,  these  variables  may  not  be  especially  relevant 
at the stress-related genes examined in this study.

Our  study  time  points  encompassed  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic,  yet  we  did  not  detect  significant  differences  over 
time  in  measures  of  methylation,  mental  health,  or  perceived 
stress.  This  suggests  that  the  impact  of  COVID-19  may  not 
have  been  relevant  to  these  measures  in  our  population.

4.4. Strengths  and  limitations

Our  study  examines  DNA  methylation  in  relation  to  lifetime  his-
tories of trauma, mental health, and coping in people living with 
HIV. This population is uniquely vulnerable to mental health chal-
lenges, both in the context of disease acquisition and in living with 

304

C.  J.  TOMLINSON  ET  AL.

a  highly  stigmatized  disease.  The  comprehensive  inclusion  of 
measurements  of  trauma,  PTSD,  stress,  anxiety,  depression,  and 
coping  strengthens  the  study.  For  example,  we  tested  various 
models of lifetime trauma history – childhood, cumulative, recent, 
and repeated trauma – to examine their relationships with epige-
netic data. However, our findings did not favor any single model 
over  the  others.  Additionally,  by  employing  the  THQ  to  assess 
trauma  history,  we  adopted  a  broad  definition  encompassing 
crime-related events, general disasters and trauma, and both phy-
sical and sexual abuse across the lifespan. This contrasts with the 
more limited focus of commonly used measures (e.g., ACEs), which 
primarily assess childhood abuse and household dysfunction [77]. 
Moreover,  though  heavy  alcohol  use  and  substance  use  did  not 
associate with methylation at either gene, these factors are often 
underreported,  especially  in  stigmatized  populations  [78].  Our 
hypothesis-driven  approach,  which  focuses  on  select  candidate 
genes, is also critical for understanding how particular genes con-
tribute to the physiological response to stress and trauma, espe-
cially  in  studies  with  smaller  sample  sizes  where  genome-wide 
approaches may not be suitable.

There are several limitations to this study. Our study may be 
the  first  to  analyze  stress-related  methylation  in  PLWH,  but  our 
findings  should  be  interpreted  cautiously  due  to  small  sample 
sizes,  particularly  at  follow-up,  which  may  contribute  to  incon-
sistencies  in  the  direction  of  effects  across  CpG  sites  and  time 
points.  While  the  literature  tends  to  show  early  life  stress  to 
associate with methylation in adulthood, our findings were less 
consistent,  and  we  believe  it  may  be  that  our  measures  of  life-
time stress were prone to significant recall bias. Participants did 
not  always  answer  questions  about  early  life  stress  consistently 
or with similar levels of detail, nor did they report the severity of 
the  traumas.  It  is  also  possible  that  the  coping  mechanisms 
helped  mitigate  effects  of  the  earlier  traumas  for  some  indivi-
duals,  but  we  were  not  able  to  test  this  hypothesis  given  the 
small  sample  size 
interaction  analyses. 
that  precluded 
Additionally,  our  examination  of  DNA  methylation  in  whole 
blood complicates interpretations because of its heterogeneous 
nature  and  potential  for  confounding  from  cell  composition 
effects [79]. However, we partially addressed this issue by includ-
ing individual blood cell count measures, which did not influence 
our findings. The occasional inconsistencies in our results are in 
line with findings from other large studies that have struggled to 
identify  consistent  associations  with  trauma  or  early  life  stress 
using  genome-wide  approaches  [80,81].  Moreover,  it  remains 
possible that blood may not be the optimal tissue for assessing 
trauma effects, and stronger associations may be found in other 
tissues.  Finally,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  HIV  infection  itself 
masked  associations  with  trauma,  but  this  was  unlikely  to  be 
a significant contributor, as all individuals in our study had very 
low  viral  loads,  and  we  attempted  to  account  for  immune 
response differences by adjusting for cell counts, which had no 
effect in our analyses.

5. Conclusions

embodiment  of  mental  health  at  the  molecular  level  in 
PLWH.  Conversely,  the  associations  with  coping  strategies 
indicate  a  potential  buffering  role  for  these  factors  in  peo-
ple  with  high  levels  of  trauma  or  mental  health  symptoms. 
However,  further  research  is  needed  to  test  for  interactions 
and  gather  more  detailed  measures  to  disentangle  coping 
strategies  from  trauma  exposures.  Though  lifetime  histories 
of  trauma  (childhood,  recent,  or  repeated)  did  not  associate 
consistently  across  sites  or  time  points  in  either  gene,  future 
studies  with 
larger  samples  are  needed  to  test  these 
hypotheses  of  critical  windows  of  trauma  exposure  fully. 
Future  research  could  also  examine  other  candidate  genes 
of  interest  (OXTR,  BDNF,  NR3C1)  or  expand  to  genome-wide 
searches  in  studies  with  much  larger  sample  sizes  and 
across  other  tissues.

enced,  on  the  outcome  of  PTSD,  in  a  subset  of  the  Detroit 
Neighborhood  Health  Study.  Despite  a  relatively  small  sample

genotype,  people  with  more  traumatic  events,  and  lower 
methylation levels, were at increased risk for PTSD, but higher 
methylation  levels  at  this  gene  were  protective  against  the 
disorder.
