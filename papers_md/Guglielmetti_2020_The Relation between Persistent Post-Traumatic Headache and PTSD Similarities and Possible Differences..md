Abstract: Post-traumatic headache (PTH) may be considered a secondary headache, which is linked
to severe disability and psychosocial impairment. Interestingly, nearly 30% of subjects with persistent
post-traumatic headache (PPTH) also suﬀer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although
existing studies demonstrated the existence of common pathophysiological characteristics in subjects
with migraine and PPTH, the diﬀerences and similarities between these complex diseases are currently
poorly understood and are yet to be comprehensively elucidated. Thus, the present review aimed to
systematically investigate the nature of PPTH in the eﬀort to better identify both the neurobiological
and clinical aspects underlying this condition. Overall, the included studies reported that: (1) the
predictors for persistent acute traumatic injury to the head were female gender, persistent symptoms
related to mild post-traumatic brain injury (mTBI), PTSD, elevated inﬂammatory markers, prior
mild traumatic brain injury, being injured while suﬀering from alcohol abuse; (2) static/dynamic
functional connectivity diﬀerences, white matter tract abnormalities, and morphology changes were
found between PPTH and migraine in brain regions involved in pain processing; and (3) clinical
diﬀerences which were most prominent at early time points when they were linked to the increased
risk of PPTH. Based on the selected reports, the relation between migraine and PPTH needs to be
considered bidirectionally, but PTSD may play a critical role in this relation. The main implications of
these ﬁndings, with a speciﬁc focus on PTSD, are discussed. Further longitudinal studies are needed
to reveal the exact nature of this relation, as well as to clarify the distinct clinical characteristics of
migraine, PPTH, and PTSD.

1. Introduction: Clinical Characteristics of Post-Traumatic Headache and Migraine, More than
an Overlapping

Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is classiﬁed by the International Classiﬁcation of Headache
Disorders (ICHD) as a secondary headache occurring seven days after injury or trauma, recovering
consciousness, and/or the ability to report pain [1]. The classiﬁcation additionally subdivides PTH into
an acute headache related to traumatic head injury, where the headache resolves within 3 months from

onset, and a persistent headache related to traumatic head injury, where the headache persists beyond
12 weeks. Moreover, head trauma leading to PTH may be mild (usually associated with moderate,
or severe mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) [1].

PTH shows apparent phenotypes which are similar to migraine or tension-type headaches,
and rarely cluster or cervicogenic headache phenotypes. PTH is usually linked to somatic symptoms
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, and photophobia). Moreover, patients suﬀering from PTH and
TBI also manifest cognitive and psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression. Furthermore,
around 30% of those exhibiting persistent PTH (PPTH) also reported post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), but this relation has been not systematically addressed [2,3].

Both migraine and PPTH need to be considered disabling conditions associated with relevant
psychosocial impairment. Migraine aﬀects about 14% of the global population (one billion worldwide),
predominantly females in the age of increased productivity [4]. The Global Burden of Disease (2016)
ranks it in third place in terms of frequency and second place in terms of disability (measured in years
lived with disability, YLDs). From this point of view, migraine may be really considered a social illness.
Migraine and PPTH patients have similar characteristics with PPTH patients who frequently present a
migraine phenotype. Although some studies demonstrated the presence of white matter lesions in
individuals with migraine [5], as well as in subjects with PPTH [6,7], the diﬀerences and similarities
between these diseases are yet to be comprehensively elucidated.

The symptomatology of PPTH is very similar to that of migraine, as nausea, vertigo, diﬃculty
concentrating, irritability, and fatigue characterize both diseases [8]. There are also other symptoms
which are not well described in PTH, for instance, neck pain, premonitory symptoms (e.g., yawning,
polyuria, food craving), aura symptoms such as visual disturbance, language diﬃculties, paresthesias,
and mood/emotional lability. Aura is not common, although patients with PTH have migraine features;
thus, it has been hypothesized that cortical spreading depression (CSD) is not a pathophysiological
mechanism underlying PTH [9]. Some exacerbating migraine factors, such as stress, exercise, sleep,
and hormonal changes, are less represented in PTH. Taking into account that mTBI may provoke
some changes in cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF), it may be useful to highlight whether orthostatism or
clinostatism exacerbate the headache, and therefore changes in CSF pressure might have important
consequences in PTH [9]. Moreover, breathing patterns may modify CSF ﬂow [10,11] and breathing
exercises may be considered as a useful treatment for PTH.

A headache after mTBI may be continuous and it could become discontinuous over time,
but sometimes the headache might be continuous for a long period, while in others PTH takes place
with delay, not immediately after trauma. These temporal characteristics allow the outlining of diﬀerent
phenotypes of headaches that underlie diﬀerent mechanisms and need speciﬁc treatment [12].

The pathophysiological elements of acute mTBI are: axonal injury, cellular ionic ﬂuxes, abnormal
neurotransmitter release, cell swelling, an altered balance between cerebral metabolism and blood
ﬂow, and blood–brain barrier interruption [13].

Symptoms of mTBI (e.g., nausea, headache, consciousness loss, and head pressure) may be related
to abnormally impaired neurotransmitter release, ion ﬂux alterations, abnormal lactic acid release,
enhanced blood ﬂow in the central nervous system, increased glucose metabolism, energy deﬁcit,
and neuroinﬂammation [14].

2. Methods

In the eﬀort to provide a comprehensive review concerning the similarities and diﬀerences between
PPTH and migraine, we carried out a careful MEDLINE search to identify articles in English published
between 2000 and 2019. Speciﬁcally, we searched for the following terms: “post-traumatic headache”,
“chronic headache”, and “migraine symptoms and clinical characteristics”. The Medical Subjects
Headings (MeSH) method was used in order to cross-reference speciﬁc terms with others regarding the
ﬁeld of search. Trials for inclusion were initially selected by the ﬁrst reviewer (M. Guglielmetti), and
later and independently a second reviewer (G. Seraﬁni), who was blind to Dr. Guglielmetti, used the

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4024

speciﬁed search strategy. When the identiﬁed abstract seemed to refer to a study potentially meeting
the criteria for inclusion, the full-text article was downloaded to check the relationship with this
review, according to the criteria for inclusion. Consultations with the senior author (P. Martelletti)
were performed in order to resolve possible discrepancies between the two reviewers. In addition,
we hand-searched the bibliographies from retrieved articles and published reviews. We also contacted
study authors for further additional details/information concerning the selected studies.

While case reports and case series were considered for inclusion into this paper (for more details,
see Tables 1–3), review articles and meta-analyses were not included, although we discuss these
contributions within the main text where appropriate. Tables 1–3 were included for the aim of the
present article and represent original material.

3. Results

3.1. Included Studies about PPTH

Overall, six studies investigated the nature of PPTH (see Table 1). One cohort study [15] showed
the link between hospitalization related to head injuries of a mild degree, and new headaches
associated with an aggravation of an existing headache. Three retrospective studies [16–18] reported
that persistent headaches, beyond the diagnosis type, were linked to negative outcomes in terms of
occupational functioning. They added that an increased severity in post-mTBI symptoms was present
in middle-aged subjects relative to the oldest individuals, and they stressed the signiﬁcant correlation
between the type or severity of PTH and the rate of allodynia. Finally, according to two longitudinal
prospective studies [12,19], traumatic brain injury was a strong predictor of headaches and psychiatric
comorbidities, and headache symptoms were prevalent after mTBI, particularly throughout the ﬁrst
12 months after being injured.

3.2. Included Studies about Migraine Neurobiological/Clinical Diﬀerential Predictors between PPTH
and Migraine

Overall, 11 studies explored the existence of possible diﬀerential predictors of PPTH. Initially,
six case–control studies [20–25] focused on the investigation of neurobiological/clinical diﬀerential
predictors between PPTH and migraine. These studies reported: the existence of diﬀerences regarding
static/dynamic functional connectivity among subjects with migraine and PPTH regarding brain
regions related to pain processing; predominant clinical/neuropathological diﬀerences among PTH
and non-PTH individuals at initial time points; abnormally bilaterally reduced cortical thickness in
frontal areas and right hemisphere parietal regions in PPTH subjects; enhanced autonomic dysfunction
in PPTH individuals; and abnormally decreased central nervous system (CSF) Tumor Necrosis Factor
(TNF) alpha concentrations in most new daily persistent headache (NDPH) patients. Based on one
cross-sectional cohort and another retrospective study without healthy controls as a comparing
group [26,27], increased chronic reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at baseline in mTBI patients
may independently predict the onset of persistent post-concussion symptoms (PPCSs), psychological
impairments, cognitive dysfunctions, white matter tract alterations related to abnormalities in functional
connectivity linked to abnormal pain modulation, and contribute to the onset/maintenance of chronic
persistent headache (CPH). Moreover, in three longitudinal prospective studies [28–30], pathological
imaging ﬁndings and female gender were reported as acute traumatic injury to the head (HAIH)
predictors. Furthermore, previous mTBI, being injured while abusing alcohol, and acute HAIH were
described as persistent HAIH predictors; the disrupted periaqueductal gray-default mode network
(PAG-DMN) connectivity predicted PTH outcomes of mTBI individuals 12 weeks after injury; female
sex, neck pain, two-week post-mTBI symptoms, and two-week post-traumatic stress were signiﬁcant
PPCS predictors (see Table 2).

Longitudinal retrospective
cohort study.

Negative occupational outcomes
are linked to persistent headache,
beyond the diagnosis type.
Headache diagnosis type was not
linked to soldiers’ separations
from service beyond headache
duration.

Relative to patients over 66 years
of age, that are more likely to
report mTBI between 6 a.m. to
12 p.m. (69%), middle-aged
patients (36–55 years) reported a
higher severity of speciﬁc
post-mTBI symptoms.

Military injuries may be considered
not speciﬁc in other populations.
The generalization of the main
ﬁndings is inﬂuenced by the small
sample size and single examiner.

The study used self-report
instruments. The study did not
evaluate prior mTBI episodes or
psychiatric disorders following
mTBI. Subjects were recruited in a
tertiary care center and cannot be
generalized to all mTBI
populations.

The recruited subjects reported a
lower rate of migraine-like
headache and a higher rate (in
particular in males) of allodynia.
PTH type/severity and rate of
allodynia were not correlated.

The study includes a very selected
sample of individuals. It could not
be determined how many of the
children with TBI continued to
manifest headache or other
headache correlates.

TBI alone was a strong predictor
of headache and psychiatric
comorbidities among subjects
with TBI. Importantly, insomnia,
tinnitus, and vertigo predicted
headache persistence only in
individuals with baseline
headache.

Misclassiﬁcation due to ICD-9-CM
code use may be the ﬁrst caveat.
Information about condition
severity was not available. Findings
may be inﬂuenced by the restriction
of the analyses to subjects with
Veterans Health Administration
care in each year of evaluation (due
to the inclusion of only the most
severe individuals). Not all subjects
with depression, PTSD or TBI were
included in the study.

When compared to the general
population, inpatients with mild
head injury are at elevated risk of
headache onset and aggravation.

Subjects with PPTH are at
increased risk of persistent pain.
The most frequent primary
diagnosis type is migraine.
Negative occupational outcomes
were linked to
persistent headache.

Relative to the oldest patients,
middle-aged subjects reported
more severe symptoms after
mTBI. A link between age and
severity of mTBI symptoms has
been identiﬁed.

Children with mild/severe TBI
more frequently manifest
migraine-like and tension-like
headaches. Children with PTH
frequently had allodynia
(common mechanisms related to
central sensitization in PTH and
primary migraine have been
supposed). PTH may be treated
using active treatments
for migraine.

The careful identiﬁcation of
symptoms in the initial phases of
headaches may help clinicians to
understand the illness outcome.

Overall, headaches pre-injury

the existence of pre-injury
immediately in 54%, 62% at three
months, at 24 weeks in 69%, and
at 48 weeks in 58% of subjects.
Cumulative incidence was 91%
after 48 weeks. Migraine was
reported in nearly 49% and
tension-type headaches in 40% of
all headaches.

Only self-report instruments were
used.
Additionally, the investigation of
only one headache type at each time
period represents a further caveat.

Throughout the ﬁrst 12-month
period after injury headache,
mTBI is very frequent and
persistent. Chronicity and
disability may be prevented with
assertive/early treatment.

Conclusions

Migraine and PPTH patients may be
distinguished in terms of diﬀerent
(static and dynamic) functional
connectivity related to speciﬁc pain-
and visual-processing brain regions.

Abnormally reduced GMV in the
right anterior-parietal and left
temporal operculum were found in
PTH individuals reported. Reduced
GMV in the left thalamus were
reported in non-PTH subjects
compared to HC as well. Reduced
GMV in left temporal operculum,
superior frontal gyrus, temporal
parietal junction, right middle frontal
gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and
anterior parietal cortex were ﬁnally
reported in PTH patients.

Functional connectivity results
presumably due to PPTH vs.
ﬁndings related to underlying
mTBI may be not dissected.
No information about the rate
of participants with migraine
at the time of imaging are
available. Half of migraine and
PPTH patients were using
preventive drugs.

Functional imaging
showed functional
connectivity diﬀerences
between migraine and
PPTH in speciﬁc regions
of interest (related to
pain processing),
postulating distinctive
pathophysiology linked
to migraine vs. PPTH.

Patient headache status was
not assessed before injury. In
addition, there is a possible
recall and selection bias linked
to the administration of the
headache questionnaire at visit
four.

Initial diﬀerences linked
to an increased risk of
PTH were predominant
between PTH and
non-PTH.

Fifty-six PPTH
patients, 30 migraine
subjects, and 36 HC.

Cross-sectional
cohort study.

Participants were
assessed with
COMPASS-31
questionnaire.

There were relevant diﬀerences
between migraine and PPTH (in
terms of mean or radial diﬀusivity) in
the cingulum, inferior longitudinal
fasciculi, bilateral anterior thalamic
radiations, the right superior
longitudinal fasciculi-parietal
portion, left corticospinal tract, and
uncinate fasciculi. In migraine
individuals, headache frequency and
forceps major mean diﬀusivity were
correlated, while a correlation
between headache frequency and
cingulum angular bundle mean and
radial diﬀusivity was found in PPTH.
Lower cortical thickness was found
in PPTH patients, relative to HC, in
the caudal middle frontal, left, right
superior frontal, and precentral
cortex, together with lower cortical
thickness in the right superior and
inferior parietal, right supramarginal,
and right precuneus region. A
negative correlation between right
and left superior frontal thickness
with headache frequency, according
to lower cortical thickness, was
reported in PPTH participants.

PPTH and migraine individuals
manifested higher COMPASS-31
mean total scores than HC. Among
subjects with PPTH, total lifetime TBI
was positively linked to
COMPASS-31 total scores, years
spent with headache with vasomotor
subdomain, and headache frequency
with vasomotor subdomain.

Only episodic and chronic
subjects with migraine were
considered. The statistical
model was not controlled for
eventual mood instability.
Medication overuse
individuals were not assessed
in both PPTH and migraine
subjects. Results may be
inﬂuenced by the history of
speciﬁc psychiatric disorders.

The study does not permit to
disentangle the eﬀect that
mood dysfunctions may have
had on altering cortical
thickness patterns and brain
changes related to concussion
vs. those associated with
headaches in PPTH patients.
Finally, the study did not
collect information on
medication intake, history of
smoking, and metabolic
indices.

The range of possible
autonomic symptoms was not
assessed. Moreover, subjects
with PPTH reported fewer
headaches, lower years spent
with headaches, and a higher
rate of males. Subject
recruitment was obtained with
a convenience sampling.
Findings were not corrected for
multiple calculations.

Results hypothesized
speciﬁc diﬀerences in the
neuropathological
mechanisms related to
both migraine and
PPTH.

Lower cortical thickness
in the right hemisphere
parietal regions and
bilateral frontal regions
were found in PPTH
patients. The study
hypothesized that brain
morphology changes in
the superior frontal
regions were modiﬁed
by headache frequency
in PPTH patients.

PPTH subjects exhibited
a higher rate of
autonomic symptoms.

Longitudinal
follow-up study.

Neuropsychological
measurements and MRI
scans were carried out
within 7 days post injury,
with 80% of subjects
followed for 12 weeks.

The mTBI cohort showed white
matter abnormalities associated with
pain aﬀective and modulatory
functions in the right anterior
thalamic radiation and left superior
longitudinal fasciculus. Moreover,
the mTBI cohort exhibited a decrease
in axial/radial diﬀusivity at the
superior longitudinal fasciculus
cluster.

A signiﬁcant increase in persistent
PPCSs (OR = 2.719), persistent
psychological distress (OR = 1.535),
and persistent cognitive dysfunctions
(OR = 1.687) were linked to enhanced
baseline CRP levels. Persistent
physiological problems (OR = 1.330)
were linked to elevated CRP levels.

Individuals with HAIH over the
course of the ﬁrst 12 weeks after
injury may signiﬁcantly improve
before 48 weeks after injury.
Headache aggravation may be
predicted by female sex, CT/MRI
results, history of positive mTBI, and
being injured when aﬀected by
alcohol abuse/dependence.

mTBI + APTH patients presented
reduced PAG-seeded FC within the
DMN compared with HC. The initial
FC strength between the PAG-right
precuneus and the PAG-right inferior
parietal lobule became the important
predictor to identify patients with
mTBI developing persistent PTH 3
months post injury.

Controls were composed of
healthy subjects and not by
mTBI subjects without
headache. In addition, the
sample size of this study needs
to be considered as quite small.

CPH seems to be related
to speciﬁc white matter
tract abnormalities
linked to functional
connectivity dysfunction
in pain modulation.

The study design, and the
relatively small sample size, do
not allow to generalize the
most relevant results to other
populations and countries.
Findings may have been
interpreted with subjectivity.

Abnormally elevated
CRP concentrations at
baseline may
independently predict
PPCSs, psychological
distress, and cognitive
dysfunctions in mTBI
subjects.

Recall bias needs to be
considered a major
shortcoming (participants are
included after their mTBI).

Headache aggravation is
more frequently
correlated to head injury
after 12 weeks following
MTBI. Speciﬁc factors
predicted headache
aggravation.

The study ﬁndings need to be
considered as preliminary. The
relatively small sample size
does not permit to generalize
these exploratory results.

The disrupted
PAG-DMN connectivity
was predictive of PTH
outcomes of subjects
with mTBI after
12 weeks of follow-up.

Main Findings

Conclusions

Military subjects with a
self-reported mTBI who
completed multidisciplinary
treatment reported a reduction
in both PTSD and PPCSs.

Persistent symptoms of anxiety,
dizziness, and headache after
concussion were attenuated
with multiple metrics
identifying/correcting the
visual misalignment with
neutralizing prismatic lenses.
A signiﬁcant reduction in
headache, dizziness, anxiety,
and overall subjective
symptoms was reported.

This was an exploratory
observational study that
used retrospective data
originally collected for
clinical purposes. A large
proportion of participants
were excluded due to
missing PT assessment data.

The multidisciplinary
treatment approach was
associated with reduced
self-reported PTSD and
PPCSs.

Patients diagnoses were
obtained using only history,
physical ﬁndings, and the
prism lenses positive
response. Amounts of
vertical misalignment cannot
be measured using a single
device or test.

Dizziness and anxiety in
participants with persistent
symptoms after concussion
may be signiﬁcantly treated
with neutralizing prismatic
lenses.

OBA may be eﬀective for
PPTH in a population at risk
for cognitive, metabolic, or
behavioral adverse eﬀects.

The small number of highly
selected patients within the
study sample does not
permit to generalize the most
relevant results.

OBA may be eﬀective in the
analyzed sample with
headaches correlated to
concussion.

rTMS inﬂuences headache
severity, frequency, functional
outcomes, symptoms after
concussion, depression, and
quality of life in subjects with
PPTH and PPCSs.

The small sample size may
have been underpowered to
identify signiﬁcant changes
in our outcome measures.
The rTMS intensity was on
the lower end of previously
reported studies.

This study showed full
participant adherence with
no dropouts, a 100%

no serious adverse eﬀects,
and an eﬃcacious blinding

3.3. Included Studies about Currently Available Treatments for PPTH

Overall, 10 studies examined the eﬃcacy and tolerability of available treatments for PPTH
(see Table 3). Two longitudinal prospective studies [31,32] found that IV metoclopramide 20 mg
plus diphenhydramine 25 mg was eﬀective and well tolerated in acute PTH subjects, while the
interdisciplinary outpatient treatment of chronic headache subjects abnormally reduced the individual
mean pain throughout the previous 7 days, together with actual pain severity (with a general
maintenance of results at one-year follow-up). Moreover, according to four retrospective studies in this
ﬁeld [33–35], the multidisciplinary treatment approach was associated with reduced self-reported PTSD
and persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCSs), a relevant reduction in persistent post-concussive
anxiety, dizziness, and headache was linked to identifying/correcting the visual misalignment with
neutralizing prismatic lenses, and onabotulinum toxin A may represent a valid PPTH preventive strategy
in subjects at risk for cognitive, metabolic, or behavioral adverse eﬀects related to standard treatments.
Furthermore, based on two cross-sectional studies [36,37], repetitive transcranial magnetic resonance
(rTMS) inﬂuences headache severity, frequency, functional outcomes, symptoms of post-concussion,
depression, and quality of life in PPTH subjects and patients with PPCSs, and rTMS was linked
to a reduced severity in PPCSs and an enhanced activation of the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex.
Furthermore, two case series and one case report [38–40] reported that the behavioral treatment
approach was an eﬀective treatment for primary headache disorder and a good theoretical ﬁt for
treating PTH after mTBI. Electrical neuromodulation appears to be extremely beneﬁcial for highly
selected head-injured subjects with refractory PTH with disabling headaches, although comprehensive
treatments and chronic refractory primary headaches may be successfully treated in the long-term
with great auricular nerve (GAN).

3.4. A Focus on PTSD: Similarities and Diﬀerences with Persistent Post-Traumatic Headache

A high prevalence of chronic, persistent, daily headaches after mTBI, suggesting the existence of
chronic migraine, which is closely linked to co-morbid PTSD, has been found in U.S. military forces [41].
The history of traumatic experiences and maltreatment is not directly related to predominant migraines
in service members following deployment. Importantly, a pre-existing headache disorder may be
enhanced by many factors such as head traumas, stress and major depression, PTSD, and environmental
cues in the context of deployment [41]. Although PTH may be described as a secondary headache
closely related to head trauma, a pre-existing migraine enhanced by mTBI in military populations
after deployment may be similarly supposed. Usually, mTBI does occur in the combat-related
context, leading to extreme physical and psychological consequences [42]. The associated injuries,
as well as chronic pain disturbances, may enhance cognitive, somatic, or behavioral mTBI correlates.
Combat-related mTBI is sometimes associated with an acute stress reaction, which is able to enhance
psychiatric comorbidities and sleep disturbances, exacerbating behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions
related to mTBI.

Based on existing studies [43–45], older age, female gender, problematic relations, comorbid
conditions (e.g., prior psychiatric disorders, substance abuse/dependence, multiple injuries, mTBI
history, and PTSD), and even psychosocial/situational factors are linked to a persistence throughout
the course of the illness following mTBI.

Sports-related mTBI has been associated with depression or psychiatric conditions, attention
deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, and sleep and learning disorders, together with chronic headache and
migraine [46]. Interestingly, primary headache, sleep disturbances, stressors related to the psychosocial
context, major depression and anxiety, substance abuse/dependence, in particular alcohol, physical
injuries, or consequences of prior head injury have been reported both in military and civilian
populations [47]. For instance, Rosenthal and Erickson [48] reported that in 270 army service members
with PTH, 39% also met the PTSD diagnostic criteria. Similarly, a prevalence of 31% for PTSD in patients
with chronic PTH after minor head trauma has been reported by Kjeldgarrd et al. [2], while Peterlin
and colleagues [49] reported predominant PTSD symptoms in samples of migraine. Post-concussive

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4024

12 of 19

disorders, regardless of the presence or absence of mTBI, seem to be predicted by pre-injury depressive
and anxiety disorders and chronic pain, according to the study of Meares and colleagues [50],
who stressed the nonspeciﬁc nature of symptoms after mTBI, which are conversely reported, based on
their point of view, in the chronic pain population. A predominance of chronic pain with unclear
origin after traumatic brain injury has been found in 51% of civilian and 43% of military cohorts,
suggesting the importance of “early screening” and pain treatment [51]. Furthermore, further associated
factors of persistent post-mTBI syndromes were cumulative stressors and coping strategies [52,53].
After investigating a sample suﬀering from mild to moderate TBI, McCauley and colleagues [54] found
the presence of reduced social support and abnormally enhanced self-reported depressive symptoms
four weeks after mTBI, together with concurrent comorbid PTSD and major depression.

In addition, headaches linked to trauma, aura, opioid abuse/dependence, and comorbid
psychopathology were found to be associated with negative outcomes and decreased rates of return
to duty based on a recent retrospective report, which investigated a sample of service members who
were recruited from war zones due to headache in the context of deployment [55]. Unfortunately,
the consequences of the early detection and treatment of comorbid disabling conditions, that were
reported to impact signiﬁcantly on individual wellbeing following mTBI in civilian and military
populations, are poorly understood.

4. Discussion

4.1. Summary of the Main Findings about the Nature of PPTH

All the considered [56] studies about the nature of PPTH concluded that: (1) being exposed to head
injury enhanced the risk of headache onset and aggravation; (2) the presence of continuous headache
was strongly linked to negative occupational outcomes; (3) the careful identiﬁcation of symptoms
in the initial phase of headache may help clinicians to understand the illness prognosis and avoid
chronicity and enhanced disability; (4) subjects with PPTH were most likely to present continuous
pain (see Table 1).

These studies deﬁne PTH as a speciﬁc diagnostic entity characterized by a common onset after
head traumatic experiences. In the ICHD, PTH is identiﬁed as either acute or chronic, occurring after
mild or severe traumas, with considerable variability regarding the mechanisms of action, clinical
characteristics, and longitudinal illness course. Moreover, the nature of the trauma, for instance,
motor vehicle accidents and sport or blast injuries, and the involvement of the neck, may result in
distinct phenotypes with diﬀerent illness trajectories [9]. In a study based on soldiers, Wilk et al.
reported that in a sample of soldiers suﬀering from mild TBI associated with a loss of consciousness,
when compared to non-blast injuries, blast injuries were more likely to occur related to persistent
headache [57]. Repeated head/neck trauma could be responsible for multiple PTH phenotypes relative to
an isolated trauma. From this point of view, clarifying the mechanisms underlying trauma and whether
trauma may be considered a unique or recurrent manifestation may clinically help to understand the
diﬀerent types of headache [9].

Most PTH subjects present features of migraine but these characteristics may be considered
variable. Pain related to PTH is usually unilateral, pulsating in quality, severe, and it worsen with
physical activity. However, the intensity of PTH and the frequency of attacks generally varies in diﬀerent
treatments. Other reports report that PTH in TBIs of all severities is mostly classiﬁed as migraine or
probable migraine, and hypothesize common pathophysiological mechanisms for these two diseases,
with PTH that may respond to migraine-speciﬁc therapies (e.g., triptans) [12]. PTH patients usually
reported a positive history of traumatic experiences and maltreatment that may be, however, not
temporally related to the occurrence of migraine. Importantly, a prior history of trauma and comorbid
psychopathology were strongly linked to negative outcomes in the PTH patient population.

4.2. Summary of the Main Findings about Neurobiological/Clinical Diﬀerential Predictors between PPTH
and Migraine

All the considered [29] studies concluded that: (1) the predictors for persistent acute traumatic
injury to the head were female gender, persistent symptoms after mTBI, PTSD, elevated inﬂammatory
markers, prior mild TBI, being injured due to alcohol abuse/dependence; (2) based on functional and
structural imaging, static/dynamic functional connectivity diﬀerences, white matter tract abnormalities,
and brain morphology changes were found between PTH and migraine for regions involved in pain
processing; (3) diﬀerences between PTH and non-PTH patients were predominant in the initial illness
phases when they were linked to an increased risk of PTH.

Female gender is, in our opinion, a predictor for the development of persistent post-traumatic
headache. However, some studies reported that females were more likely to suﬀer from acute traumatic
injuries to the head.

Importantly, the history of prior migraine episodes has been reported to enhance the risk of
post-traumatic migraine [29]. It has been hypothesized that the neurovascular trauma response can be
enhanced by migraine mechanisms, resulting in persistent and more disabling symptoms after mTBI.
Alternatively, mTBI may be able to activate, in individuals with a speciﬁc migraine predisposition,
a preexisting headache (and perhaps migraine) mechanisms [58].

According to a comprehensive perspective, mTBI and other brain-related traumas may cause
persistent headache and migraine in individuals with genetic vulnerability. Migraine has strong genetic
roots with some genetic polymorphism speciﬁcally related to type 1 familial hemiplegic migraine
(FHM1) (CACNA1A gene encoding P/Q type calcium channel) and type 2 familial hemiplegic migraine
(FHM2) (ATP1A2 gene encoding Na/K ATPase), associated with diﬀerential phenotypes in response to
minor head trauma [59]. A mild head trauma might provoke hemiplegic migraine attacks. Previous
studies showed how severe migraine symptoms may be induced even after minor traumas by P/Q type
calcium channel or Na/K pump genetic alterations, hypothesizing the existence of similar mechanisms
underlying PTH susceptibility, even among individuals without FHM. Therefore, clinicians may
consider both the P/Q type calcium channel and Na1/K1 ATPase as possible therapeutic targets in
PTH subjects [9]. It is also important to consider the psychological consequences related to mTBI
and trauma-related headache. To this speciﬁc regard, anxiety, depression, and PTSD are collectively
associated with headache and severe/frequent headaches are linked to preexisting mood and anxiety
disorders in a dose–response manner [60].

Given this background, head injuries may activate the same mechanisms underlying migraine or
migraine tension-type headache only in a speciﬁc (more vulnerable) subgroup of patients. The initial
headache symptoms might develop to be persistent due to psychiatric comorbidity and perceived pain,
further exacerbating the psychosocial impairment of the initial mTBI.

4.3. Summary of the Main Findings about Currently Available Treatments for PPTH

All the considered [36] studies concerning currently available treatments for PPTH concluded
that: (1) speciﬁc neuromodulation techniques (e.g., rTMS and electrical neuromodulation in the
short-term period, and the great auricular nerve as a long-term treatment) may inﬂuence headache
severity, frequency, functional outcomes, post-mTBI symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and quality of
life; (2) behavioral treatment and interdisciplinary outpatient treatment approaches may be eﬀective
nonpharmacological treatments for headache disorders; (3) speciﬁc pharmacological strategies, such as
metoclopramide plus diphenhydramine and botulinum toxin A, may be able to restore most subjects
to a normal psychosocial functioning and eliminate symptoms related to mTBI.

According to the current literature, treatments have similar eﬀects, while fremanezumab (CGRP
MoAb) seems to be a promising tool for both headache forms [61]. There are many therapeutic targets
that could be explored in clinical trials, starting from the current available treatments, like exercise,
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, antagonists of substance P receptors (NK1) or glutamate
receptors, adenosine receptor antagonists and agonists, and hormonal treatments [9]. Glutamate

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4024

14 of 19

deserves a further mention because it may be considered the main excitatory neurotransmitter involved
in migraine pathophysiology and there are robust preclinical studies showing that glutamate release or
speciﬁc glutamate receptor alterations may be induced by TBI [62]. High levels of glutamate have
been observed in the serum and in the CSF, both ictally and interictally, in migraine. Early treatment
targeting glutamate receptors with magnesium supplementation may be an important option in PTH
and in migraine [9]. Recent studies showed that migraine may be associated with a calcitonin gene
related peptide (CGRP), and speciﬁc treatments targeting CGRP, as well as CGRP receptors, like the
monoclonal antibodies, have proved their eﬃcacy in clinical trials. Animal models showed how CGRP
is released after TBI and inﬂuences migraine-related behaviors like hyperalgesia and photophobia.
Therefore, these two ﬁndings may suggest that CGRP might also play an important role in PTH [63,64].

4.4. Main Caveats

The present review needs to be considered according to the following limitations/shortcomings.
First, most reports did not investigate the time of headache onset or use self-report instruments to
explore the presence and severity of PTH. In addition, the preliminary/exploratory nature of some
studies selected for this review manuscript, as well as the inclusion of case reports or case series,
could not have allowed the generalization of the most relevant study ﬁndings. The absence of a study
control group in most of the cohort included studies, the extremely small sample sizes, together with
the selection of some studies using a cross-sectional or retrospective design, need to be addressed
as further major caveats that do not allow the drawing of conclusions. Furthermore, we included
some clinical cohort epidemiological reports which are known for having low sample sizes and a
focus on individual outcomes to support our ﬁndings, and studies that had adopted retrospective
designs, thus the ﬁndings may have been hampered by recall bias. In addition, the selection of study
cohorts was highly focused on studies done in military populations suﬀering from battleﬁeld-related
trauma. Although soldiers need to be considered the predominant population when we refer to PTSD
prevalence, this could represent a bias.

Moreover, patients with PPTH represent a very select group of patients that may present
migraine-like headaches; unfortunately, there are no studies, to our knowledge, that have been carried
out in order to primarily identify the similarities and diﬀerences between PPTH and migraine. Thus,
all the conclusions about the nature of PPTH and migraine have been interpreted indirectly and
according to the most relevant selected studies about the main topic. Furthermore, information about
headache severity, as well as the presence of psychiatric comorbidities, was not available in most
studies, and this may have biased the main study results. Finally, the link between post-traumatic
headache and migraine certainly will not be solved in a review article that may foster further controlled
studies in this respect.

5. Conclusions

Based on the most relevant studies about the main investigated topic, the relation between migraine
and PPTH need to be considered bidirectionally. It has been hypothesized that the neurovascular
trauma response can be enhanced by migraine mechanisms, resulting in persistent and more disabling
symptoms after mTBI. However, mTBI may alternatively be able to activate the same neurobiological
mechanisms underlying tension-type headache or migraine only in a speciﬁc subgroup of patients,
raising the possible existence of a genetic vulnerability. In line with this assumption, patients suﬀering
from migraine report a persistent long-term exacerbation of their migraine/headache after head trauma.
In both cases, the presence of PTSD may play a relevant role in disability and psychosocial impairment
related to PPTH. The current literature upon this topic is growing rapidly, showing a spreading
interest in this area in terms of diagnostic tool applications, diﬀerential diagnosis among headaches,
and epidemiological data from emergency and psychiatric departments, which are the ideal frame
for unbiased studies on these patients, in order to have more valid data in the future that will help
us understand if this research path is worth pursuing [65–71]. Importantly, we have also to carefully

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 4024

15 of 19

address the link between emotional turmoil, which is closely linked to suicidal behavior, in PTH
patients. Understanding this is crucial to attenuate stigma [72], improve illness outcome, and provide
a comprehensive and appropriate treatment [71,73–76]. The relevance to the collection of reliable
information in the evaluation of suicide risk cannot be ignored by physicians when approaching
patients with PTH [77,78]. A fascinating journey is only in its initial phases and further longitudinal
studies are needed to reveal the exact nature of the relations between PTSD, migraine, and PPTH,
although the enthusiasm of these times seems to be premature.
