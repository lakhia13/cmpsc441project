Abstract

Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth 
exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, 
not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first 
three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their 
patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children’s postdisaster PTSS, evaluating 
the typical number and types of patterns for children’s PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and 
protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies 
on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 
3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a 
delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely 
across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were 
consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection 
criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were 
significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should 
combine individual level participant data across studies of children’s responses to disasters to 
better understand PTSS trajectories.

Youth are the largest age group affected by disasters (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires, 
droughts) around the world (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction [UNISDR], 
2015). Worldwide, over 100 million children are exposed to disasters each year (UNISDR, 
2011). Disasters may be defined as large-scale, single incident potentially traumatic events. 
In the United States alone, 14.0% of children report experiencing a disaster during childhood 
(Becker-Blease, Turner, & Finkelhor, 2010). This is concerning, given that natural disasters 
are expected to increase in frequency and intensity (U.S. Global Change Research Program, 
2016).

Disasters present a significant threat to children’s mental health (La Greca et al., 2013; 
McDermott, Cobham, Berry, & Kim, 2014). Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are the 
primary presenting problem in children after disasters (Furr, Comer, Edmunds, & Kendall, 
2010). Across studies of disasters, rates of elevated PTSS vary widely, with some estimates 
being higher than 70.0% when assessed within the first 3 months postdisaster (Kucukoglu, 
Yildirim, & Dursun, 2015). The presence of PTSS may be debilitating for children, and in 
the long term PTSS are associated with poor life outcomes in terms of education, jobs, 
physical health, and mental health (Hadi, Lai, & Llabre, 2014). The purpose of the current 
study was to review the literature on children’s patterns of risk and resilience postdisaster as 
well as the factors that predict these patterns or trajectories.

Disaster management experts advocate that stepped care models of intervention are needed 
to effectively address post-disaster mental health needs (Pfefferbaum & North, 2016). 
Stepped care models triage children based on their mental health needs so that children at 
the highest risk for chronic distress (i.e., PTSS that are clinically elevated more than three to 
six months after disasters) receive the most intensive, and therefore most costly, 
interventions. This approach is necessary due to the large numbers of children exposed to 
disasters and the limited funding available to address children’s postdisaster mental health 
needs (Wizemann, Reeve, & Altevogt, 2014).

To date, it is not clear how to stratify children based on their risk for chronic postdisaster 
PTSS. Few studies have assessed children at multiple time points after disasters, and even 
fewer have assessed children beyond the first 12 months postdisaster (Pfefferbaum et al., 
2013). The few existing longitudinal studies that have followed children postdisaster have 
primarily focused on understanding children’s average responses to disasters through the use 
of traditional, variable-centered approaches (e.g., analysis of variance). Although 
informative, these approaches assume that all children in disaster-affected areas follow a 
similar pattern of PTSS postdisaster.

With recent advances in analytic approaches, we now have the ability to examine how and 
when children’s postdisaster PTSS arise and develop, and which children may be at highest 
risk for persistent distress. Person-centered approaches, such as growth mixture modeling 
and group categorization, can identify heterogeneous patterns of disaster response and 
provide information about whether and why children differ in their responses to disasters 
over time.

A growing body of literature documents heterogeneity among adults’ responses to 
potentially traumatic events (Bonanno, Brewin, Kaniasty, & La Greca, 2010; Bonanno & 
Mancini, 2008). Across studies, these trajectories are (a) chronic (persistent elevated PTSS 
over time); (b) recovery (initial elevated PTSS, followed by a decrease in PTSS at later time 
points); (c) resilience (persistent low PTSS over time); and (d) delayed (initial subclinical 
PTSS, followed by an increase in PTSS at later time points).

To date, several studies have examined whether these four trajectories may be directly 
applied to children, using a priori categorization (e.g., choosing cutoff scores to categorize 
children into chronic, recovery, resilience, and delayed trajectories; Fan, Long, Zhou, Zheng,

& Liu, 2015; Kronenberg et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; McDermott et al., 2014). However, 
trajectories identified among adults may provide limited insight into children’s postdisaster 
responses, given that children’s experiences during and after potentially traumatic events are 
distinct from those of adults (Fothergill & Peek, 2015). Bonanno et al. (2010) also highlight 
that displays of disaster-related stress differ by age. Many factors related to resilience may 
differ by age (e.g., the term community may hold a different meaning for a child than an 
adult).

Person-centered approaches are being utilized in child disaster research, but to date no clear 
consensus regarding the number and type of children’s PTSS trajectories has emerged. This 
is due in part to the fact that person-centered approaches are data-driven. Consensus may 
only be developed by examining findings from multiple studies across multiple disasters, 
which has not yet been done. This work is needed to help identify risk and protective factors 
that influence and distinguish children’s likelihood of falling into various PTSS trajectories; 
this work will aid in early identification of subgroups of children at increased risk for mental 
distress (i.e., before symptoms become chronic). In the disaster literature, conceptual 
frameworks highlight several factors as influencing children’s postdisaster PTSS: 
preexisting child characteristics, disaster exposure, ongoing loss/disruption, other stressors, 
and social support (Furr et al., 2010).

This review of children’s trajectories of PTSS postdisaster helps fill critical gaps in 
knowledge about the number and type of PTSS trajectories among children. Our first aim 
was to evaluate the typical number and types of child postdisaster PTSS trajectories 
identified in the literature. We examined whether analytic strategy, assessment timing, and 
study selection criteria influenced findings. Our second aim was to evaluate risk and 
protective factors that distinguished PTSS trajectories.

A literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman, 2009) to 
examine PTSS trajectories in children following disasters. This search was broad, in that we 
allowed for the inclusion of both natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, floods) and man-made 
disasters (e.g., terrorist events, oil spills). The literature search was conducted in May 2016 
and June 2016 using PubMED and all databases available through the EBSCOhost database 
(a total of 92 individual databases at the time of the search, including PsycINFO, 
PsycARTICLES, and MEDLINE). The following search terms were used: (1) trajector*; (2) 
posttraumatic stress, PTSD, depress*, or anxiety; (3) child* or adolescent; and (4) trauma, 
traumatic, incident, or disaster. Because disasters may be defined as large-scale potentially 
traumatic events (Furr et al., 2010), search terms were intentionally broad (i.e., included 
trauma and incident) to ensure that the literature search encompassed all types of disasters, 
including man-made disasters which may not specifically use the term disaster as a 
description of the event.

Three additional search strategies were conducted to ensure all relevant articles were 
included (see complete details in Appendix A in the online Supporting Information). First,

Terminology

the authors searched prominent child and trauma journals. Second, the first three authors 
generated a list of experts in the field of child PTSS trajectories; searches were performed 
for each identified expert. Third, reference lists of electronically identified studies were 
manually searched for relevant literature.

Studies were selected based on six inclusion criteria: (1) participants must have been under 
18 years of age, (2) articles must have been written in English, (3) articles must have been 
published in an academic journal, (4) trajector* must have appeared in the abstract for the 
article, (5) trauma type must have been a natural or man-made disaster, and (6) studies must 
have been quantitative studies specifically focusing on PTSS trajectories of children and/or 
adolescents.

A diagram of data extraction is depicted in Figure 1 in the online Supporting Information. 
After initial article identification, the title and abstract of each article were read to determine 
if the article met inclusion criteria, resulting in eight articles for inclusion in this review. 
Each study was coded by the first three authors. Trauma type, age of participants, time 
points of assessment, symptoms assessed, significant and nonsignificant risk and protective 
factors, and number of trajectories and percent of the sample following each trajectory were 
noted. Inconsistencies were discussed by the first three authors until consensus was reached.

The primary goal was to evaluate trajectory patterns of PTSS after disasters among children. 
Results have been described as a narrative.

Trajectories—Terminology for trajectories in this article was standardized based on shapes 
described in previous articles (Bonanno & Mancini, 2008). Trajectories were defined by 
PTSS patterns over time: chronic (persistent elevated PTSS over time); recovery (initial 
elevated PTSS, followed by a decrease in PTSS at later time points); resilience (persistent 
low PTSS over time); and delayed (initial low PTSS, followed by an increase in PTSS at 
later time points).

Analytic strategy: Trajectory categories chosen a priori—Studies were categorized 
as choosing trajectories a priori if they assigned children to trajectory classes based upon 
predetermined categories. Limitations to this approach include the inability to test 
underlying taxonomic theory (because categories are assumed a priori) and overfitting, the 
creation of trajectory categories that reflect random variation. In addition, this approach does 
not allow for calibrating precision of child classification to trajectories (Nagin, 1999).

Analytic strategy: Person-centered approaches—Person-centered approaches 
recognize patterns in PTSS trajectories using person-level data without the use of a priori 
cutoff scores. Results are data-driven, and thus results should be informed by theory and 
evidence from research using a priori trajectory categorization. This analytic technique is 
especially advantageous over a priori categorization methods for correctly identifying 
children with symptoms near the preselected defined cutoff scores. Person-centered 
approaches can correctly identify these children (Bainter & Curran, 2015). In addition, these 
techniques allow for modeling uncertainty related to group membership (Nagin, 1999).

Social support—Social support consists of perceived care and emotional support from 
family members, teachers, friends, and others. All social support measures used in the 
studies reviewed for this article were validated for use with child populations (Table 1). 
Measures focused on perceptions of emotional support from others, such as having parents 
who understand you, or having a close friend. Social support may also be defined as 
connectedness to others (McDermott et al., 2014), such as having friends to play with during 
school breaks.

Coping—After a disaster, coping refers to the way in which an individual deals with 
disaster exposure and/or related stressors, such as perceived life threat, death of a family 
member, or relocation. Negative coping refers to destructive ways of dealing with exposure 
and stressors, whereas positive coping refers to constructive ways of dealing with exposure 
and stressors. Three specific examples of negative coping were examined in the studies 
included in this review. Blame coping is blaming oneself or others for causing a “bad thing” 
to occur (in this context, a disaster). Anger coping involves yelling, screaming, and/or 
getting mad as a result of the disaster (La Greca et al., 2013). Avoidant coping is trying to 
stay away from reminders of the disaster and from things that make one upset (Weems & 
Graham, 2014). Positive coping as a general concept was discussed in one study (Fan et al., 
2015); however, no specific examples of positive coping were examined in the studies 
included in this review.

Results

Figure 1 in the online Supporting Information outlines the number of articles yielded at each 
stage of data extraction. A total of 166 articles were identified in the initial literature search, 
and 138 were selected for further screening. Among these studies, eight articles eligible for 
inclusion in this review on child postdisaster PTSS trajectories were identified (k = 8, with k 
representing number of articles included in the present review). These studies included 8,306 
children aged 3 to 18 years. Table 1 provides an overview of the characteristics of these 
studies.

Study Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria for all eight studies were based on child enrollment at schools involved in 
the study. For seven studies, schools chosen for inclusion were directly affected by a 
disaster, whereas in the eighth study (Liu et al., 2011), students were sampled from a camp 
school erected after the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in China. No explicit exclusion criteria 
were used at enrollment. However, four studies excluded participants from analyses: Self-
Brown, Lai, Thompson, McGill, and Kelley (2013) excluded participants who did not 
provide PTSS-related responses on any assessment; Weems and Graham (2014) excluded 
participants who were missing one assessment; and Osofsky, Osofsky, Weems, King, and 
Hansel (2015) and Kronenberg et al. (2010) both excluded participants who only completed 
one assessment. To accommodate missing data, McDermott et al. (2014) used estimation 
maximization procedures; Osofsky et al. (2015) used multiple imputation; Self-Brown et al. 
(2013) used maximum likelihood estimation; La Greca et al. (2013) used full information 
maximum likelihood (FIML).

Assessment Timing

Page 6

Timing of first assessments in the studies reviewed ranged from 12 months predisaster 
(Weems & Graham, 2014) to 24 months postdisaster (Kronenberg et al., 2010). Final 
assessment timing ranged from 1 month postdisaster (Weems & Graham, 2014) to 49 
months postdisaster (Osofsky et al., 2015). The number of time points also varied by study, 
with three studies administering two assessments, two studies administering three 
assessments, and three studies administering four assessments (see Table 1).

PTSS Measures

Multiple instruments were used to evaluate PTSS (see Table 1). Across studies, child report 
of PTSS was used for children 8 years of age or older. Parent report was used in one study 
(Osofsky et al., 2015) for children aged 3 to 7 years. Six studies used either the University of 
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Reaction Index for 
Children (PTSD-RI; La Greca et al., 2013; McDermott et al., 2014; Self-Brown et al., 2013; 
Weems & Graham, 2014) or a variation (Kronenberg et al., 2010; Osofsky et al., 2015). The 
PTSD-RI is considered appropriate for children aged 7 years and older; children are asked to 
rate endorsement of statements related to PTSS on a scale of 0 (none of the time) to 4 (most 
of the time). One study (Liu et al., 2011) used the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for 
Children–Alternate Version (TSCC-A). The TSCC-A is designed for children aged 8 to16 
years and consists of 44 items presented as thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Children are 
asked to rate endorsement of items on a scale of 0 (never) to 3 (almost all of the time). One 
study (Fan et al., 2015) used the PTSD Self-Rating Scale (PTSD-SS). In this measure, 
children are asked to rate endorsement of 24 symptoms on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 
(extremely severe).

Aim 1: Evaluate the Typical Number and Types of Child Postdisaster PTSS Trajectories

All of the studies reviewed included at least three trajectories (see Figure 1): chronic, 
recovery, and resilience. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Three studies (37.5% 
of k = 8 studies; k refers to number of articles included in the present review) identified a 
delayed trajectory, but two found no evidence for a delayed trajectory, and three found only 
limited evidence (i.e., less than 5.0% of the children studied fell in a delayed trajectory). 
Given differences in analytic strategy and selection criteria, we examined trajectory patterns 
based on (a) analytic strategy (i.e., trajectories chosen a priori versus person-centered 
approaches); (b) assessment timing (i.e., all assessments completed within the first year 
versus final assessments completed beyond the first year); and (c) study selection criteria 
(i.e., elementary school–aged youth, secondary school–aged youth, broad age ranges).

Analytic strategy

A priori categorization: Four studies predetermined the number and type of PTSS 
trajectories they expected to observe among children exposed to disasters (see Table 1). Two 
studies (Fan et al., 2015; Kronenberg et al., 2010) defined their trajectories based on 
previous literature (e.g., Bonanno & Mancini, 2008; Masten & Obradovic, 2008), whereas 
two studies (Liu et al., 2011; McDermott et al., 2014) did not reference particular theorists. 
Of note, three of these studies only assessed children at two time points. Limited follow-up

assessments may have influenced the choice to use categories chosen a priori, as advanced 
longitudinal modeling strategies generally require at least three time points (Kline, 2016).

Among the studies that utilized categories chosen a priori, the percent of children falling in 
the chronic trajectory ranged from 3.9% to 23.0%; the recovery trajectory ranged from 7.3% 
to 27.1%; the resilience trajectory ranged from 45.2% to 79.4%; and the delayed trajectory 
ranged from 3.1% to 9.4%. The largest trajectory group was the resilience trajectory in all 4 
studies utilizing a priori categorization.

Person-centered modeling: Among the four studies that used person-centered modeling 
techniques, the percentage of children falling in the chronic trajectory ranged from 4.0% to 
38.0%; the recovery trajectory ranged from 10.0% to 43.0%; the resilience trajectory ranged 
from 37.0% to 71.0%; and the delayed trajectory ranged from 0.0% (i.e., no evidence) to 
18.0%. The resilience trajectory was the largest group in three studies that utilized person-
centered modeling, whereas the recovery trajectory was the largest group in the La Greca et 
al. (2013; 43.0%) study.

Of the four studies that used person-centered methods, two studies used growth mixture 
modeling (La Greca et al., 2013; Self-Brown et al., 2013), and two studies used cluster 
analyses to identify PTSS trajectories (Osofsky et al., 2015; Weems & Graham, 2014). All 
four studies referenced prior research and theory on PTSS trajectories. In the La Greca et al. 
(2013) study, unconditional latent growth mixture models (with no predictors) were 
estimated for one to five trajectories. In the Self-Brown et al. (2013) study, unconditional 
latent class growth analysis models (with no predictors) were estimated for one to four 
trajectories. In both of these studies, a decision to retain three trajectories was made; neither 
found evidence for a delayed trajectory. In the Osofsky et al. (2015) study, cluster analyses 
utilizing a Euclidian distance measure indicated that four trajectories provided a good fit for 
the data; hierarchical linear modeling analyses were also completed in order to examine 
PTSS trends over time. In the Weems and Graham (2014) study, cluster analyses using a log-
likelihood distance measure indicated that five trajectories would be optimal for the data. 
Because the “moderate” and “stable high” trajectories presented by Weems and Graham 
(2014) both consisted of persistent elevated PTSS across time points, these trajectories were 
combined into a single “chronic” trajectory for the results of this review.

A key design feature of studies using person-centered modeling is sample size. Although 
there is no general rule of thumb for sample sizes in person-centered modeling, larger 
sample sizes are preferred. For growth modeling, sample sizes of at least 100 are needed, 
depending on study factors such as the number of assessment time points (Curran, Obeidat, 
& Losardo, 2010). Both studies that used this type of analysis included over 400 
participants. For cluster analysis, there is no heuristic for determining an appropriate sample 
size, but larger sample sizes are also recommended (Siddiqui, 2013). One study (Weems & 
Graham, 2014) had a relatively small sample size (n = 141), whereas the other (Osofsky et 
al., 2015) had a larger sample size (n = 4,619).

Assessment timing

Assessments completed within the first year: Three studies completed all assessments 
within the first year postdisaster. Across these studies, the percentage of children falling in 
the chronic trajectory ranged from 3.9% to 38.0%; recovery trajectory ranged from 7.3% to 
43.0%; resilience trajectory ranged from 37.0% to 79.4%; and delayed trajectory ranged 
from 0.0% (i.e., no evidence) to 9.4%. Two of the studies (Liu et al., 2011; Weems & 
Graham, 2014) reported the resilience trajectory was the largest trajectory group. La Greca 
et al. (2013; 43.0%) found the recovery trajectory to be the largest trajectory group.

Final assessment completed after the first year: Among the five studies that followed 
children beyond one year after a disaster, the percent of children falling in the chronic 
trajectory ranged from 4.0% to 23.0%; recovery trajectory ranged from 16.4% to 27.1%; 
resilience trajectory ranged from 45.2% to 72.1%; and delayed trajectory ranged from 0.0% 
(i.e., no evidence) to 18.0%. All five studies reported that the resilience trajectory was the 
largest group.

Study selection criteria

Elementary school–aged children: In two studies, selection criteria for inclusion in the 
study focused on elementary school–aged children, specifically those who were 8 to 11 
years of age at first assessment. These two studies (La Greca et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2011) 
found, respectively, the percentage of children in the chronic trajectory was 20.0% and 
3.9%; the recovery trajectory was 43.0% and 7.3%; the resilience trajectory was 37.0% and 
79.4%; and the delayed trajectory was 0.0% (i.e., no evidence) and 9.4%. The findings from 
these two studies were not consistent. Liu et al. (2011) found the largest group to be the 
resilience trajectory (79.4%), whereas La Greca et al. (2013) found the largest group to be 
the recovery trajectory (43.0%).

Secondary school–aged children: Only one study focused exclusively on secondary 
school–aged children (12 to 16 years of age at baseline). Fan et al. (2015) reported that 
children fell into trajectories as follows: 10.5% were chronic; 20.0% recovery; 65.3% 
resilience (the largest trajectory group in this study); and 4.2% delayed.

Broad age range: Five studies focused on a broad age range (i.e., not exclusively 
elementary or secondary school aged children). These studies found the percentage of 
children falling in the chronic trajectory ranged from 4.0% to 38.0%; recovery trajectory 
ranged from 10.0% to 27.1%; resilience trajectory ranged from 43.0% to 72.1%; and 
delayed trajectory ranged from 0.0% (i.e., no evidence) to 18.0%. All five studies found the 
resilience trajectory to be the largest group.

Aim 2: Evaluate Risk and Protective Factors That Distinguished PTSS Trajectories

There was limited evidence for a delayed trajectory across studies. Thus, we focused on 
factors that distinguished likelihood of falling in chronic, recovery, and resilience 
trajectories.

Factors distinguishing between the chronic and resilience trajectories—
Various factors distinguished the chronic trajectory from the resilience trajectory, including 
age, gender, severe PTSD at Time 1, general anxiety symptoms, numerous exposure and 
recovery stressors, less social support, less positive coping, and more negative coping (see 
Table 2). Of note, female gender was identified by four studies to be a risk factor that 
increased the likelihood of falling into the chronic rather than the resilience trajectory. 
Additionally, community/neighborhood violence was identified by two studies to be a risk 
factor that increased the likelihood of falling into the chronic rather than the resilience 
trajectory. Interestingly, findings regarding age were conflicting: Kronenberg et al. (2010) 
found that younger children had higher odds of falling into the chronic trajectory; however, 
Osofsky et al. (2015) reported that older adolescents had higher odds of falling into the 
chronic trajectory compared to the resilience trajectory.

Factors distinguishing between the recovery and resilience trajectories—
Multiple factors distinguished the recovery trajectory from the resilience trajectory, 
including older age, general anxiety symptoms, numerous exposure and recovery stressors, 
less positive coping, and more negative coping (see Table 2). Of note, female gender was 
identified by four studies to be a risk factor that increased the likelihood of falling into the 
recovery rather than into the resilience trajectory. Two studies found that more loss, trauma, 
or disruption events increased the odds of falling into the recovery rather than the resilience 
trajectory.

Factors distinguishing between the chronic and recovery trajectories—Various 
factors distinguished the chronic trajectory from the recovery trajectory, including severe 
PTSD at Time 1, general anxiety symptoms, use of blame and anger coping, and multiple 
exposure and recovery stressors (see Table 2). Two studies found that adolescents with a 
higher number of negative or intervening life events were more likely to fall into the chronic 
than the recovery trajectory. Additionally, two studies identified less social support, a third 
study identified low social connectedness, a fourth study identified low family 
connectedness, and a fifth study identified less peer support as factors that increased the 
likelihood of falling into the chronic rather than the recovery trajectory. Findings regarding 
age were again conflicting.

Discussion

This study is the first to review the literature on children’s postdisaster PTSS trajectories. 
Understanding how and why children differ in their responses to disasters is critical. Based 
on this review, it is clear that children exhibit multiple responses to disasters. Across all 
studies, children reported at least three trajectories of PTSS: resilience, recovery, and 
chronic. This represents a fundamental shift in understanding children’s responses to 
disasters, as research to date has largely focused on identifying children’s average response 
to disasters (e.g., Martin, Felton, & Cole, 2016). Given these findings, future researchers 
should consider using person-centered approaches to study children’s disaster responses.

Across studies, the resilience trajectory tended to be the largest trajectory group, similar to 
the adult literature (e.g., Orcutt, Bonanno, Hannan, & Miron, 2014). However, across

studies, there was no clear consensus regarding the proportion of children falling into 
various trajectories. Several potential reasons may account for these differences. Studies 
differed in terms of analytic approach. Studies that used a priori categorization were not able 
to test whether a four-trajectory model was the best fit for the data. It would be interesting to 
reanalyze data from a priori categorization studies to see if person-centered approaches 
achieve the same results. However, three of the four studies that used a priori categorization 
approaches only included two assessment time points, limiting their ability to use different 
analytic approaches.

Assessment time points varied widely across studies, ranging from 12 months predisaster to 
49 months postdisaster. This heterogeneity in design is common in the disaster literature, 
due to the challenges of conducting postdisaster research (Pfefferbaum et al., 2013). In 
general, studies with assessments beyond the first year postdisaster showed that the 
resilience trajectory was the most prevalent and the delayed trajectory the least prevalent. 
Further, participant age range varied by study. The studies that included participants of broad 
age ranges showed, in general, that the resilience trajectory was the largest trajectory group. 
In contrast, studies involving elementary school–aged children were divided (one showed 
the resilience trajectory as the most prevalent, the other showed the recovery trajectory as the 
most prevalent).

Studies also varied in their assessment methods. For example, Liu et al. (2011) was the only 
study to use the TSCC-A and found the highest prevalence of the resilience trajectory. All 
other studies used the PTSD-RI or a modified version of this instrument. The studies also 
examined a diverse set of disasters, ranging from smaller scale disasters with fewer physical 
impacts (e.g., Cyclone Larry, which made landfall in Australia in 2006) to large-scale 
disasters in socially vulnerable regions (e.g., Hurricane Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast in 
the United States in 2005) and in developing nations (e.g., the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake in 
China). Future studies that integrate individual-level data would allow for cross-study 
comparisons of the role of differing assessment time points, measures used for assessment, 
methods used for analysis, and scale of disaster.

Another major finding from this review is that evidence was very limited for a delayed 
trajectory among children. In most of the studies (i.e., 62.5% of the studies), less than 5.0% 
of children were classified in a delayed trajectory, in contrast with the abundant evidence 
supporting the presence of delayed PTSS trajectories among adults after potential traumatic 
events (Bonanno et al., 2010; Orcutt et al., 2014). Among the three studies that found 
evidence for delayed PTSS trajectories (i.e., more than 5.0% of children were classified in a 
delayed trajectory; Liu et al., 2011; Osofsky et al., 2015; Weems & Graham, 2014), one used 
a priori cutoffs to identify children falling into that trajectory. It is not clear how many of the 
“delayed” children may have been close to clinical cutoffs at the first assessment time point. 
In other words, it is not clear if children truly displayed delayed symptom presentation or 
merely a small increase in PTSS (from subclinical to clinical levels). Among the four studies 
that used person-centered approaches, the more statistically rigorous approaches, two studies 
failed to identify a delayed trajectory. The lack of evidence for delayed trajectories suggests 
that very few children are likely to develop clinically significant PTSS after initial screening 
periods.

However, it remains an important challenge to distinguish between children who are likely 
to fall into a chronic versus a recovery trajectory. This review suggests that only a very small 
proportion of children are likely to exhibit chronic trajectories and be in need of intensive 
mental health services. Stratifying children based on early symptom levels may misclassify 
children and provide costly intensive services to children who do not need them (i.e., for 
children who will recover). Thus, more information is needed on risk factors that may help 
distinguish children likely to fall in chronic trajectories.

This review provides important novel information about factors that distinguished between 
the chronic and recovery trajectories across studies, including perceived life threat, perceived 
threat to parents, experience of evacuation, housing disruption, violence exposure, and low 
social support or family connectedness. These risk factors are highlighted because they 
specifically distinguished the chronic versus recovery trajectories as well as the chronic 
versus resilience trajectories, although not necessarily the recovery versus resilience 
trajectories. Thus, these risk factors provide new information beyond what is already known 
about how risk factors generally relate to elevated postdisaster distress (La Greca, Lai, 
Silverman, & Jaccard, 2010). Although further study is needed, the trajectory modeling 
approach has the potential to change our view of theory-based approaches to assessment as 
they apply to children affected by disasters. Based on these findings, the risk factors 
mentioned here may be especially important in distinguishing children likely to report 
chronic PTSS trajectory responses, before children experience chronic symptoms.

Further, social support was the main protective factor identified across studies. This 
represents a hopeful finding, as this may be a modifiable protective factor for children. This 
suggests that disaster preparedness and intervention programs should focus on increasing 
children’s social support networks. This is particularly important because disasters tend to 
damage social networks for children (e.g., La Greca et al., 2010).

Despite the strengths of this review, several limitations should be considered. First, risk of 
publication bias is always present in reviews (Torgerson, 2006). This work may be biased 
toward published findings where researchers were able to identify more than one trajectory. 
We view this possibility as unlikely, given that all of the papers reviewed found at least three 
PTSS trajectories among their samples. Second, the present review is subject to the 
limitations of the individual studies included. This study only included eight studies, and this 
review is limited by the limitations of those articles. The most common limitations reported 
throughout the included articles were (a) data that were self-reported and subject to response 
bias, (b) lack of generalizability due to the use of a homogenous sample, (c) incomplete 
information (i.e., data related to baseline or predisaster functioning, disaster exposure, and 
interventions), and (d) naturalistic designs limiting the ability to make causal claims. Third, 
retention rates for individual studies and missing data handling may have influenced results 
for individual studies. It is possible that certain groups (e.g., delayed and chronic) may have 
been more likely to drop out of studies; in this way, differential attrition rates for trajectories 
would influence our understanding of proportions and forms of trajectory groups. 
Additionally, many studies used “modern” methods to handle missing data, such as FIML 
and multiple imputation. However, some studies used “traditional” methods for missing data 
handling such as listwise deletion, which may have produced biased results (Enders, 2011).

This may make growth mixture modeling more appealing in the future, as there are 
numerous robust strategies within mixture modeling for handling missing data. Fourth, this 
review searched for articles related to natural and man-made disasters. All articles in this 
study included exposure to natural disasters, whereas only one article also included exposure 
to a man-made disaster (i.e., children who were exposed to the Gulf Oil spill were also 
exposed to Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav, which hit the Gulf Coast in the United States in 
2005 and 2008, respectively). It will be important for future studies to include examinations 
of children’s responses to other types of disasters. Finally, the number of studies included in 
the present review is small, but by reviewing these studies collectively, the sample is more 
heterogeneous, improving the generalizability of the results beyond what can be concluded 
from any single study alone. This is important, as several studies listed the use of a 
homogenous sample as a potential limitation.

This review serves as a useful guide for planning future research. The number of trajectories 
as well as risk and protective factors discussed here can be considered when developing 
research protocols and analytic plans. Factors found to distinguish children in different 
trajectories should be included in future studies. Of note, factors were heterogeneous, and 
findings were not consistent across studies. Further studies are needed to clarify which 
factors, and under what circumstances, differentiate those who develop chronic PTSS versus 
those who recover. Future research may use this review as a framework for determining 
theoretically plausible models. Based on the results discussed in the present review, more 
research related to PTSS trajectories of children and adolescents specifically is needed, as 
their patterns of response following a disaster differ from those of adults.

Individual studies of child postdisaster PTSS can be limited in terms of their sample size, 
period of child development examined, postdisaster time frame, frequency of assessments, 
risk factors studied, and sample diversity. Meta-analysis and integrative data analysis (IDA) 
are both methods that could be used within the child disaster field to address these issues. 
Meta-analysis is an important strategy that addresses some of the limitations associated with 
drawing conclusions from individual studies. An important future research question is 
whether trajectories are similar across other types of child trauma (e.g., injury, accidents). 
With IDA, data is integrated at the individual level from multiple studies, creating a pooled 
source of data that is more powerful and diverse than any one individual study (Brown et al., 
2013), and which allows researchers to address questions that are difficult to test within 
individual studies alone. For example, pooling assessment time points would allow 
researchers to examine PTSS trajectories over the multiple time points covered by individual 
studies. This information is critical to determine the optimal time to screen for PTSS 
postdisaster and distinguish between children following chronic compared to recovery 
trajectories. This is needed to efficiently allocate resources to children at greatest risk of 
experiencing chronic PTSS. Additionally, IDA could be used to analyze differences in 
trajectories due to disaster characteristics (e.g., large vs. small-scale disasters; natural versus 
man-made disasters), but IDA techniques will need to consider study-level variables, such as 
sample selection, and how these variables might influence findings. Research in this area 
will also need to evaluate how study retention rates may influence findings.

In order to conduct IDA, child trauma researchers need to build repositories of data for joint 
examination of children’s responses to trauma. This type of data repository effort is in 
progress (Kassam-Adams et al., 2012). Efforts to create consortia of interested researchers in 
this area who meet regularly (e.g., at national conferences) are needed. Further, IDA requires 
some overlap of items among pooled data sets. To support these efforts, researchers should 
consider using consistent measures across studies.

Finally, more work is needed that focuses on communities that are particularly vulnerable to 
disasters. Children in developing countries are at highest risk for experiencing negative 
consequences after disasters (UNICEF, 2007). In the United States, some communities, such 
as those in the Gulf region, are highly vulnerable to disaster due to socioeconomic factors, 
location, and history (Emrich & Cutter, 2011). More studies are needed in these 
communities in order to better inform preparedness and recovery efforts.

Figure 1. 
Youth posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories identified in the literature. 
McDermott et al. (2014) assessed primary school and secondary school students separately; 
trajectory totals from each age group were combined for this review. La Greca et al. (2013), 
Osofsky et al. (2013), Self-Brown et al. (2013), and Weems and Graham (2014) utilized 
person-centered approaches rather than a priori categorization.

a

Studies listed in parentheses indicate those articles in which factors were found to be significant.

b

Risk factors included in this table were found to be significant in the full model in La Greca et al. (2013). A follow-up analysis was performed by 

La Greca et al., including only disaster-related exposure and stressor variables, and additional risk factors (not included in this table) were 
significant in this reduced model;

c

Osofsky et al. (2015) and Weems and Graham (2014) did not make odds ratio comparisons between groups;

d

Significant predictor of falling into the chronic trajectory among primary school children in McDermott et al. (2014), but not significant among 

secondary school children;

e

Housing disruption includes living in a greater number of places postdisaster, housing others due to disaster, living in a trailer postdisaster, and 
endorsing housing problems or worries.
