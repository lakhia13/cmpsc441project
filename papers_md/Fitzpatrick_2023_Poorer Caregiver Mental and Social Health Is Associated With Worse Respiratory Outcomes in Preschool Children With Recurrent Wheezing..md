Abstract

Background.—Mental and social health in preschool caregivers has been inadequately studied 
but may influence respiratory symptom recognition and management.

Objective.—This study identified preschool caregivers at highest risk for poor mental and social 
health outcomes based on patient-reported outcome measures. We hypothesized that caregivers 
with the poorest mental and social health would have worse quality of life and preschool children 
with more wheezing episodes.

Methods.—Female caregivers (N=129) with a preschool child 12–59 months of age with 
recurrent wheezing and at least one exacerbation in the previous year completed eight validated 
patient-reported outcome measures of mental and social health. K-means cluster analysis was 
performed utilizing each instrument T-score. Caregiver/child dyads were followed for 6 months. 
Primary outcomes included caregiver quality of life and wheezing episodes in their preschool 
children.

Results.—Three clusters of caregivers were identified (“low risk”, n=38; “moderate risk”, n=56; 
“high risk”, n=35). The high risk cluster had the lowest life satisfaction, meaning and purpose and 
emotional support and the highest social isolation, depression, anger, perceived stress, and anxiety 
that persisted over six months. This cluster had the poorest quality of life and marked disparities

respiratory symptoms and a higher occurrence of any wheezing episode, but lesser outpatient 
physician utilization for wheezing management.

Conclusion.—Caregiver mental and social health is associated with respiratory outcomes in 
preschool children. Routine assessment of mental and social health in caregivers is warranted to 
promote health equity and improve wheezing outcomes in preschool children.

Introduction

Wheezing is a common and troubling symptom in preschool children in the United 
States. Although there is variability in the severity and frequency of wheezing in affected 
children,1–5 the morbidity of this age group is significant. In 2019, preschool children 
accounted for nearly 33% of all pediatric Emergency Department visits and nearly 45% of 
all pediatric hospitalizations for wheezing and asthma exacerbations.6, 7 Preschool children 
with recurrent wheezing, defined as those children with two or more lifetime episodes 
of significant wheezing requiring healthcare attendance,8 are particularly problematic 
and frequently require hospital readmission for acute wheezing management.9 Recurrent 
wheezing in preschool children is therefore a substantial driver of wheezing-related costs in 
children, not only from direct expenditures, but also from missed days of work and other 
indirect expenses.10, 11

Unlike adults and older children with asthma, preschool children with recurrent wheezing 
are completely reliant on their caregivers for care. Although several studies have 
characterized the impact of asthma in older children on caregivers,12, 13 studies of preschool 
caregivers are rare. Existing studies of preschool caregivers have mostly focused on single 
constructs such as asthma-related caregiver quality of life14 or functional status during 
an acute exacerbation,15 or alternatively, have focused on single symptoms of stress and 
depression.16 Most studies have also assessed these constructs at a single point in time. No 
study to date has examined multiple, validated, patient-reported outcomes of mental and 
social health collectively in caregivers of preschool children with recurrent wheezing. This is 
a major shortcoming since caregiver mental and social health may play an important role in 
wheezing recognition and management in preschool children.

Given this gap in knowledge, we administered eight validated and psychometrically sound 
measures of mental and social health from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) and the National Institutes of Health Toolbox to caregivers 
of children with preschool children with recurrent wheezing at baseline and at six months. 
We hypothesized that “clusters” of caregivers with distinct features of mental and social 
health would be identified by k-means cluster analysis and that caregivers with the poorest 
mental and social health would have worse quality of life and preschool children with 
more wheezing episodes requiring healthcare use. We further hypothesized that clusters of

identified caregivers would be associated with social determinants of health and would have 
temporal stability over 6 months.

Methods

Female adult caregivers 18–50 years with a preschool child 12–59 months of age with 
recurrent wheezing and at least one wheezing episode treated with systemic corticosteroids 
in the previous 12 months were included in the study. Recurrent wheezing was defined 
as a lifetime history of two or more episodes of wheezing, each lasting at least 24 hours 
and requiring treatment with albuterol. Caregivers were excluded if their preschool child 
had co-morbid disorders associated with wheezing (such as immune deficiency, cystic 
fibrosis, pulmonary aspiration, congenital airway anomalies, or premature birth before 35 
weeks gestation) or if their child had a significant developmental delay or failure to thrive. 
Caregivers provided informed written consent for themselves and their preschool child 
to participate in the study. All study procedures were performed in accordance with the 
relevant guidelines and regulations in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Overview of recruitment and study design.

Families were recruited from Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, 
consisting of 3 pediatric hospitals, 8 urgent care centers, and a large subspecialty building. 
Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta manages more than 915,000 visits each year from children 
across all 159 counties in Georgia. The population served is 39% White, 36% Black, and 
17% Hispanic. However, many of the patients presenting for asthma care are from two 
surrounding counties which are 34% White, 61% Black, and 3% Hispanic. Potential families 
of children meeting inclusion criteria were identified through a review of electronic medical 
records and were contacted by email, phone, or in person during clinical encounters.

Caregivers completed an in-person, research-only visit and an in-person follow up visit at 
6 months. Visits were rescheduled if the preschool children had an asthma exacerbation 
treated with systemic corticosteroids in the preceding two weeks. Patients were telephoned 
at monthly intervals to assess for respiratory-related healthcare utilization.

Asthma action plan.

At the baseline visit, caregivers received a written action asthma plan for their child, an 
albuterol sulfate metered dose inhaler with a valved holding chamber and face mask, and 
prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day for 2 days followed by 1 mg/kg/day for 2 days). The action plan 
included green, yellow and red zones defined by symptoms. For yellow zone symptoms, 
caregivers were instructed to administer two inhalations of albuterol sulfate every four hours 
as needed for up to 24 hours. The red zone instructed caregivers to initiate the prednisolone 
prescription and to seek medical care (by telephoning the study team or their preferred 
medical provider or initiating emergency medical services). Caregivers were also provided 
with 24-hour direct telephone support from the study team.

Caregiver characterization.

At each study visit, caregivers completed demographic and medical history questionnaires 
and validated, patient-reported outcome measures of social and mental health. These 
measures included the PROMIS tools for general life satisfaction (5a), meaning and purpose 
(4a), emotional support (4a), social isolation (4a), depression (4a), anger (5a), and anxiety 
(4a) and the National Institutes of Health Toolbox fixed form for perceived stress. The 
PROMIS tools assessed symptoms over the past 7 days whereas the NIH Toolbox form 
assessed symptoms over the past month. These tools utilize a T-score metric in which 50 
is the mean of the reference population and 10 is the standard deviation of the reference 
population. Higher T-scores reflect more the concept being measured.17 Caregivers also 
completed the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver’s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), 
which contains 13 questions in two domains (activity and emotional function) that reflect the 
impact of the child’s asthma symptoms during the previous week. Responses were scored on 
a 7-point scale and averaged, with lower scores indicating poorer quality of life.18

Preschool child characterization.

Respiratory symptoms in the preschool child were assessed over the previous week with 
a five-item Child Symptom Questionnaire, which is an adaptation of the Pediatric Asthma 
Caregiver Diary19 with questions pertaining to the severity of cough, wheezing, trouble 
breathing, activity interference and sleep interference. Each of the 5 questions was scored 
from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe), with higher scores reflecting greater respiratory symptoms. 
with higher scores reflecting greater respiratory symptoms. Respiratory and asthma control 
in the preschool child were assessed with the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in 
Kids (TRACK) questionnaire.20 This tool contains three questions pertaining to symptoms 
over the past 4 weeks, 1 question pertaining to short-acting beta agonist use over the past 
3 months, and 1 question pertaining to oral corticosteroids over the past three months 
that each have 5 responses that are summed on a scale between 0 and 20, with scores 
of 80 or more reflecting good control.21 Preschool participants also submitted blood 
samples for total serum IgE and blood eosinophil counts (Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, 
Atlanta, Georgia). Aeroallergen sensitization was determined by specific IgE testing with 
twelve extracts: Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, dog dander, 
cat dander, Blatella germanica, Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumagatis, oak tree, pecan tree, 
Bermuda grass, Johnson grass, and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) (Greer® 
Laboratories, Lenoir, North Carolina). Tests were considered positive if specific IgE values 
were ≥0.35 kU/L (Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia).

Statistical analyses.

T-scores for each caregiver-reported measure of mental and social health (8 in 
total) were obtained from the HealthMeasures Scoring Service available online at 
www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_scoringservice. K-means cluster analysis was performed 
utilizing the T-scores for each instrument at the baseline visit. Analyses with 2, 3, and 4 
cluster solutions and a maximum of 10 iterations were explored and the analysis with 3 
clusters was retained for further testing. Cluster groups were compared with Chi-Square 
tests and analysis of variance with Tukey’s Least Significant Difference post hoc tests. All

analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics software, version 28 (Chicago, Illinois) 
utilizing a 0.05 significance level without adjustment for multiple testing.

Results

One hundred twenty-nine female caregivers and their children were enrolled. K-means 
cluster analysis of the eight pre-selected patient-reported outcome measures of caregiver 
mental and social health yielded three cluster groups (Table 1). Cluster 1 was termed “low 
risk” and was characterized overall by the highest life satisfaction, meaning and purpose, 
and emotional support and the lowest social isolation, depression, anger, and perceived 
stress. Cluster 2 was termed “moderate risk” and was characterized by intermediate scores 
for each instrument, except for perceived stress and anxiety, which were slightly greater 
compared to Cluster 1. Cluster 3 was termed “high risk” and was characterized by the 
lowest life satisfaction, meaning and purpose and emotional support and the highest social 
isolation, depression, anger, perceived stress, and anxiety (Table 1).

Caregiver features at baseline.

Features of the caregivers, by cluster group assignment, are shown in Table 2. Caregivers 
in the low risk and moderate risk clusters had a similar racial distribution, medical 
history, educational attainment, household income and other household features. However, 
caregivers in the moderate risk cluster were more likely to be of Hispanic ethnicity. In 
contrast, the high risk cluster included fewer white and more Hispanic caregivers with lower 
educational attainment, more children in the home, and greater household tobacco smoke 
exposure. Caregivers assigned to the high risk cluster also reported poorer quality of life 
related to their child’s asthma as reflected by lower scores on the PACQLQ instrument, but 
this did not reach the level of significance (6.32 ± 0.98 vs. 5.78 ± 2.38 vs. 5.69 ± 1.16 for 
low vs. moderate vs. high risk, p=0.088).

Preschool child features at baseline.

Features of the preschool children are shown in Table 3. Children from low risk and 
moderate risk caregivers had similar demographic features, medical histories, controller 
medications, daycare attendance and allergic features. However, children from high risk 
caregivers were significantly more likely to have experienced a prior intensive care 
unit admission for wheezing and also had sensitization to more aeroallergens (Table 3). 
Preschool children from high risk caregivers also had more respiratory symptoms triggered 
by tobacco smoke or allergens according to caregiver report. The significant aeroallergens 
that differed between the clusters included dog dander (% with sensitization, 7.9 vs. 16.1 
vs. 30.3% for low risk vs. moderate risk vs. high risk, p=0.043), cat dander (2.6 vs. 5.4 vs. 
30.3%, p<0.001), and cockroach (2.6 vs. 7.1 vs. 30.3%, p<0.001). There were no differences 
in dust mite, mold, tree, grass or weed sensitization between clusters (data not shown). 
Preschool children in the high risk cluster also had more respiratory symptoms in the 
week prior to enrollment reflected by higher scores on the Child Symptom Questionnaire 
(2.68 ± 3.96 vs. 2.84 ± 4.49 vs. 4.20 ± 4.28 for low risk vs. moderate risk vs. high risk, 
p=0.041). Respiratory and asthma control reflected by TRACK questionnaire scores was not

significantly different between groups (62.4 ± 20.4 vs. 62.3 ± 22.5 vs. 64.7 ± 21.2 for low 
risk vs. moderate risk vs. high risk, p=0.857).

Caregiver outcomes at 6 months.

T-scores for the caregiver-reported outcome measures of mental and social health at 6 
months are shown in Table 4. At 6 months, caregivers assigned to the high risk cluster 
continued to report worse life satisfaction, meaning and purpose, and emotional support and 
higher social isolation, depression, anger, perceived stress, and anxiety. Outcome measures 
overall were stable for each group, although some regression to the mean in the outcomes 
measures was noted (Table 4). Repeating the cluster analysis with 6-month data also 
confirmed the stability of the original clusters, with 80%, 75%, and 75% of caregivers 
correctly re-assigned to the low risk, moderate risk, and high risk cluster, respectively.

At 6 months, caregivers originally assigned to the high risk cluster also reported significantly 
poorer quality of life related to their child’s asthma at 6 months (Figure 1A). Poorer quality 
of life was associated with lower general life satisfaction T-scores (Figure 1B), higher social 
isolation T-scores (Figure 1C), and higher perceived stress T-scores (Figure 1D) but was not 
associated with the other measures of caregiver mental and social health (data not shown).

Preschool child outcomes at 6 months.

At 6 months, preschool children from the high risk cluster continued to have more frequent 
respiratory symptoms reflected by higher Child Symptom Questionnaire scores (Figure 2A). 
Higher Child Symptom Questionnaire scores were associated with poorer caregiver quality 
of life (Figure 2B). TRACK scores of respiratory and asthma control did not reach the 
threshold of significance (74.6 ± 18.7 vs. 69.0 ± 20.6 vs. 61.2 ± 23.6 for low risk vs. 
moderate risk vs. high risk, p=0.069) but lower (i.e., worse) TRACK scores were associated 
with higher (i.e., worse) Child Symptom Questionnaire scores (r=−0.492, p<0.001) and 
lower (i.e., worse) caregiver quality of life scores (r=0.465, p<0.001). The percentage of 
children with TRACK questionnaire scores below 80 at 6 months was also not significantly 
different between groups (54% vs. 61% vs. 68%, p=0.563).

By 6 months, approximately 53% of preschool participants overall experienced one 
significant wheezing episode, defined as at least 24 hours of wheezing requiring treatment 
with albuterol. The percentage of children with a wheezing episode was significantly higher 
in the high risk cluster (Figure 2C). Prednisone use as instructed by the written asthma 
action plan was not significantly different between clusters (% of episodes treated with 
prednisone, 68% vs. 45% vs. 59% for low vs. moderate vs. high risk, p=0.302). Emergency 
Department utilization for the wheezing episode was also not significantly different between 
clusters (% seeking emergency care, 30% vs. 39% vs. 36% for low vs. moderate vs. high 
risk, p=0.796), but preschool children from high-risk caregivers were significantly less likely 
to see an outpatient physician for management of the wheezing episode (Figure 2D).

Discussion

In this study, we identified three clusters of preschool caregivers with differing patient-
reported outcome measures of mental and social health. Consistent with our hypothesis,

a cluster of caregivers at highest risk for poor mental and social health outcomes was 
identified which also had the poorest caregiver-related quality of life. This cluster was 
distinguished by other social determinants of health, namely non-White race, Hispanic 
ethnicity, lower educational attainment, more children in the home, and more household 
tobacco smoke exposure. Mental and social health outcomes were essentially unchanged in 
high risk caregivers at 6 months. Preschool children from these high risk caregivers also had 
more frequent respiratory symptoms and a higher occurrence of any wheezing episode, but 
lesser outpatient physician utilization for wheezing management. Collectively, these findings 
highlight the dynamic interplay between caregiver mental and social health and respiratory 
outcomes in preschool children. The findings also argue for routine assessment of mental 
and social health in caregivers of preschool children to promote health equity and improve 
respiratory outcomes.

Although the concept of “caregiver burden” is not new, to our knowledge, this is the first 
study to utilize a battery of validated, patient-reported outcome measures of mental and 
social health in caregivers of preschool children with recurrent wheezing. Other studies have 
evaluated caregivers’ functional status15 and cumulative maternal stress and depression16, 22 
and similarly found altered caregiver emotions, concerns and experiences during acute 
asthma exacerbations and increased frequency wheezing illnesses in preschool offspring 
from caregivers with more stress and depression. Similarly, although mental and social 
health were not directly measured, a European cohort of preschool children with wheezing 
observed lower (i.e., poorer) caregiver asthma-related quality of life in children with severe 
versus mild-to-moderate wheezing.14 In that same study, preschool children with severe 
wheezing also had more mothers who smoked during pregnancy, a higher presence of 
urinary cotinine, more environmental allergies, and poorer symptom control.14

The associations we observed between social determinants of health and wheezing outcomes 
in preschool children are also consistent with previous studies. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, there are five broad determinants of health that influence 
health equity, including genetics, behavior, environmental and physical influences, medical 
care and social factors.23 Social factors in particular are often overlooked. For example, 
a separate study of preschool children with recurrent wheezing noted that children at 
highest risk of social vulnerability (defined by a composite measure of ethnicity, race, 
household educational attainment and household poverty) had more severe symptoms during 
upper respiratory infections and more severe exacerbations despite supervised medical 
care.24 Caregivers of these children also lived in poorer housing conditions and reported 
significantly poorer quality of life.24 Furthermore, Black and Hispanic children have more 
persistent wheezing during the preschool years and increased asthma incidence at age 11 
years in neighborhoods of all income levels.25 National surveillance data also confirm 
racial disparities in healthcare utilization for wheezing and asthma mortality in children.26 
However, other studies have shown that racial disparities in healthcare utilization for asthma 
are mediated by social, economic, and environmental factors, presenting opportunities for 
intervention.27–29 These factors include, but are not limited to, lack of economic stability, 
housing inequality, limited access to quality education and health care, higher exposure 
to pollution and tobacco, and inaccessibility to quality food and medical care. These 
factors are also not limited to Black and Hispanic communities but are also present in

densely populated inner cities with low-income families, neighborhoods, and schools.30 For 
example, inner cities usually suffer from spatial inequality, which influences asthma and 
respiratory outcomes in children.31–35

In the present study, we did not observe differences in emergency department utilization 
between groups. However, the sample size was relatively small, and emergency department 
utilization was collected as a binary variable and not as a utilization rate. Emergency 
department utilization for asthma is also quite complex and can be associated with other 
factors such as comorbidity36 and food allergy.37 Perceptions of asthma control may also 
differ in vulnerable populations.38 In contrast, the low percentage of children from high 
risk caregivers seeking outpatient care for wheezing in the present study was striking but 
also consistent with previous work. A recent analysis of claims from three states found 
that children who had primary care follow-up visits within 14 days after an asthma-related 
emergency department visits were more likely to have commercial insurance.39 In that 
same study, children with primary care follow-up visits also had lower rates of subsequent 
emergency department revisits.39 Other studies have also shown that families of children 
with asthma who routinely use the emergency department for healthcare have to travel 
further distances for outpatient care and have poorer quality of life.40 Similarly, an analysis 
of children enrolled in the California Medicaid program found that Black children had a 
higher ratio of emergency department to outpatient visits that was more pronounced in 
neighborhoods with median household income below the 25th percentile and neighborhoods 
with high poverty.41

Strengths of the present study include the inclusion of infrequently studied caregiver/
preschooler dyads, the characterization of enrolled caregivers with a battery of 
psychometrically sound patient-reported outcome measures of mental and social health, 
and the longitudinal study design. Nonetheless, this study does have limitations. First, our 
study design focused on individual versus community-level variables, and therefore did 
not adequately assess all of the variables in the World Health Organization’s conceptual 
framework for social determinants of health, including structural determinants (i.e., 
governance, macroeconomic policies, housing policies, and public policies), racism, material 
circumstances such as the neighborhood features and food insecurity, and psychosocial 
factors such as childhood adversity and community violence.42 Although we attempted to 
standardize care during exacerbations with the provision of asthma action plans and rescue 
medications, access to healthcare (and access to an outpatient care provider) may still have 
influenced our results. Indeed, it is notable that so many children from high risk caregivers 
had a previous intensive care unit for wheezing, yet were not receiving preventative 
controller medications. In those patients with adequate preventative healthcare access, we 
also cannot exclude systemic racism which may have influenced care approaches and 
resulted in more frequent respiratory symptoms in high risk children. The effectiveness of 
current educational strategies to meet all patient and family needs is another consideration. 
For example, the asthma action plan instructs caregivers to administer medications, but we 
previously observed greater fear of administering rescue medication in caregivers at highest 
risk of social vulnerability.24 This study was also conducted at a single academic medical 
center and may have inadvertently selected for a unique group of caregivers with high 
motivation who were willing to participate in a longitudinal research study.

In summary, the results of this study demonstrate differences in patient-reported outcome 
measures of mental and social health in caregivers that are associated with caregiver quality 
of life and wheezing outcomes in preschool children. Caregivers at highest risk for poor 
mental and social health had little to no improvement in these reported outcomes by 6 
months and were further distinguished by several social determinants of health. Although 
validation studies are warranted, these findings highlight opportunities for interventions with 
caregivers that may improve quality of life and respiratory-related outcomes in preschool 
children and eliminate health inequities. In particular, more effective tools, strategies, and 
procedures are needed for educating all families about wheezing in this age group.

What is already known about this topic?

Highlights Box

Preschool children rely on their caregivers for recognition and management of their 
respiratory symptoms. The mental and social health of caregivers may influence the 
caregiver’s ability to perform these roles for their preschool children.

What does this article add to our knowledge?

Preschool caregivers with the poorest mental and social health had disparities in other 
social determinants of health and the poorest quality of life. Their preschool children had 
more symptoms and wheezing over 6 months with lesser outpatient care.

How does this study impact current management guidelines?

Caregiver mental and social health is associated with social determinants of health and 
respiratory outcomes in preschool children. Mental and social health assessments in 
caregivers are warranted to promote health equity and improve wheezing outcomes in 
preschool children.

Patient reported outcome measures in caregivers at 6 months, by baseline cluster assignment. Data represent 
the mean T-score for each instrument ± standard deviation (SD), the change from baseline (follow up score 
minus baseline score) shown as median (25th, 75th percentile), or the number of participants (%).
