Abstract 
Background  Men represent the majority of suicide deaths globally and men are more likely to die by suicide with-
out contact with formal mental health services. In Australia, three-quarters of suicide deaths are men. If services were 
better able to meet their needs, men might be more likely to seek help. In this scoping review, we sought to describe 
the formal and informal service landscape for men at risk of suicide in Australia, and to determine the extent 
of research evidence for the effectiveness of these in lowering suicidality, and improving mental health or help-seek-
ing behaviours. We limited our investigation to Australian services, in order to comprehensively identify all community 
and health system services.

Methods  Relevant services and initiatives in Australia were identified through multiple methods: (1) a hand search 
of key websites and directories; (2) a systematic search of PsycINFO, Cochrane Central, EmBASE, and PubMed; and (3) 
suggestions by researchers, consumers and clinicians. Evaluations were also identified using multiple methods, 
including the initial systematic search, targeted website searches, and via multiple search engines. Findings are pre-
sented using narrative synthesis.

Results  Included services and initiatives (N = 88) were diverse in their characteristics (e.g., cost to the user, mode 
of delivery, location), however, there was considerable overlap in the types of components offered. Awareness 
and education were the most commonly offered (84.1% of services and initiatives). Only 22.7% of services and initia-
tives had been formally evaluated and existing evaluations varied in quality. Pre-post intervention designs were most 
often used, and only three evaluations assessed outcomes in a randomised controlled trial.

Conclusions  The service landscape for Australian men is broad. However, there appears to be substantial overlap 
in the components offered by services and initiatives. The prevalence of awareness and education-based offerings 
is disproportionate to evidence about men’s preferences for support. There is a lack of high-quality evaluations. We 
conclude that the cohesiveness of men’s suicide prevention approaches must improve through service development 
and policy.

Background
Addressing  high  suicide  rates  in  men  is  a  global  public 
health  issue  that  warrants  urgent  attention.  Men  rep-
resent  the  majority  of  suicide  deaths  in  most  countries 
around  the  world  [1],  despite  the  fact  that  mood  disor-
ders  are  more  prevalent  in  women  [2],  and  that  women 
make more suicide attempts [3]. In Australia, 75% of peo-
ple  who  die  by  suicide  are  men  [4],  with  similar  gender 
ratios in other high-income countries [1].

Gender  differences  in  help-seeking  and  mental  health 
service  use  may  partly  contribute  to  the  higher  suicide 
rate for men relative to women. Indeed, among people at 
risk of suicide, men are less likely than women to disclose 
suicidal ideation [5], and be in contact with formal men-
tal health services such as psychologists and psychiatrists 
[6,  7].  This  was  also  reflected  in  coded  ambulance  data, 
which points to high rates of suicidal ideation and distress 
in men that go undetected [8]. Lower use of formal men-
tal health services by men is often linked to the influence 
of socialised traditional masculinity, whereby norms like 
stoicism and strength are often seen as desirable traits for 
men  [9].  Indeed,  endorsement  of  traditional  masculine 
norms,  and  in  particular,  preferences  for  self-reliance  in 
men are associated with suicidal thinking [10]. Relatedly, 
men may experience greater stigma towards help-seeking 
and mental health services that is both internalised, and 
experienced through interactions with family, colleagues, 
and health professionals [11].

Lower service use in men may also be due to the lack 
of  availability  of  male-oriented  services  that  align  with 
men’s  preferences  for  support.  Existing  research  has 
shown  that  men  prefer  therapies  that  are  goal-focused, 
action-oriented,  and  gender-sensitive  [12,  13]  and  more 
informal  supports  such  as  social  groups  or  community-
based support [14]. Despite gender differences in suicide 
risk  and  help-seeking,  most  evaluations  of  suicide  pre-
vention  interventions  have  not  assessed  whether  gen-
der influences the efficacy of existing suicide prevention 
approaches [15]. However, one experimental study dem-
onstrated  that  mental  health  professionals  were  more 
willing  to  treat  and  refer  a  hypothetical  female  patient, 
relative  to  a  hypothetical  male  patient  when  both  were 
described  as  experiencing  high  suicidality  [16].  Addi-
tionally,  one  review  of  adolescent  interventions  found 
evidence  that  services  such  as  school-based  and  health-
based suicide prevention programs might be less effective 
for males than females [17].

Internationally,  advocacy  in  men’s  suicide  prevention 
has  increasingly  focused  on  the  need  for  new  clinical 
and  non-clinical  approaches  that  recognise  and  are  tai-
lored to men’s strengths, giving rise to new initiatives tar-
geted towards men [18–21]. In Australia, several of these 
approaches  are  funded  by  the  Australian  Government 

[22].  However,  despite  a  plethora  of  new  campaigns, 
grassroots  initiatives,  models  of  care,  and  interventions 
for  men  emerging  over  the  last  decade  across  different 
countries, publicly available or published data evaluating 
these programs is lacking. It is now timely to review our 
current  approaches,  their  suitability  and  effectiveness, 
and to identify any gaps in service provision. Identifying 
existing  suicide  prevention  and  mental  health  services, 
campaigns  and  initiatives  targeting  men  and  determin-
ing their usage and efficacy will shape policy and service 
development. Further, knowledge of the elements of sui-
cide  prevention  service  provision  that  are  successfully 
attracting and retaining men allows investment in suicide 
prevention  initiatives  to  be  directed  towards  the  most 
effective services.

The current scoping review focuses on the suicide pre-
vention  service  landscape  for  men  in  Australia.  While 
there may be differences in the approaches seen in Aus-
tralia  compared  to  other  countries,  there  are  similar 
barriers  to  mental  healthcare  for  men  in  other  high-
income  nations  such  as  the  United  States,  Canada,  and 
the  United  Kingdom  [12].  There  were  several  aims  for 
this review. Firstly, we sought to describe and categorise 
existing  suicide  prevention  and  mental  health  services 
and initiatives (including awareness campaigns, informa-
tion and resources, social and peer support interventions, 
gatekeeper  programs,  referral  services,  clinical/thera-
peutic  interventions  and  helplines)  that  predominantly 
target Australian men. We also sought to report on ser-
vice outcomes and evaluations. The included evaluations 
focused on outcomes related to suicidality, mental health 
or  related  outcomes,  and/or  help-seeking  intentions  or 
behaviours.

Methods
Search strategy

This  scoping  review  followed  an  adapted  version  of  the 
five stages of a scoping review recommended by Arksey 
and O’Malley (2005): 1) defining the research question/s, 
2)  identifying  relevant  information  sources,  3)  informa-
tion source selection, 4) charting the data, and 5) collat-
ing, summarising, and reporting the results. An adapted 
version  of  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic 
Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  extension  for 
scoping  reviews  (PRISMA-ScR)  checklist  (Tricco  et  al., 
2018)  was  used  in  reporting  the  results  of  this  review. 
These  guidelines  were  adapted  given  the  focus  of  this 
scoping review on services/initiatives, rather than scien-
tific studies.

Men’s  services  and  initiatives  were  identified  through 
three  different  strategies,  conducted  in  the  following 
order:

tories that list available suicide prevention services 
and mental health services: Head to Health (https://

(2)  Systematic search of academic electronic databases 
PsycINFO,  Cochrane  Central,  EmBASE,  PubMed. 
Three  key  blocks  of  terms  related  to  (i)  men,  (ii) 
suicide  prevention  or  mental  health,  and  (iii)  Aus-
tralia-based  services  were  used  (see  Appendix  A). 
Databases  were  searched  from  database  inception, 
and only English-language articles were included.
(3)  Services  and  initiatives  suggested  by  Australian 
researchers,  lived  experience  advisors  (recruited 
for this project from a network of lived experience 
advisors  from  the  Black  Dog  Institute),  and  clini-
cians within the project team, with working knowl-
edge  of  the  mental  health  and  suicide  prevention 
landscape in Australia.

This scoping review was preregistered on OSF Regis-

tries: https:// doi. org/ 10. 17605/ OSF. IO/ GE9ZB.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Services/initiatives  were  included  if  they  predomi-
nantly  targeted  Australian  men  aged  18 + and/or  car-
ers/peers of men (with the purpose of supporting male 
loved  ones)  and  describe  mental  health  or  suicide 
prevention  as  a  main  purpose  of  the  service/initiative 
based  on  the  information  provided  on  their  website. 
Services  targeting  specific  populations  of  Australian 
men  (e.g.,  men  in  a  particular  profession,  male-domi-
nated industry, or of a particular cultural group) were 
also  included.  Services  and  initiatives  needed  to  be 
based  in  Australia.  Services/initiatives  were  excluded 
if  they  indirectly  targeted  mental  health  and  suicide 
by focusing on risk factors (e.g., financial stress, social 
isolation,  parenting  stress,  grief  etc.),  if  they  were  not 
promoted  as  specifically  for  men,  male-dominated 
industries,  and/or  carers/peers  of  men,  or  if  they  tar-
geted boys aged at maximum of 18 years or below (e.g., 
school-based interventions).

Selection of services/initiatives

Figure 1 presents an adapted PRISMA diagram. The ini-
tial search was conducted between April 2022 and June 
2022.  Additional  services  were  identified  during  the 
evaluation  search  between  December  2022  and  March 
2023. Across all three sources, services/initiatives were 
independently  assessed  by  NMR  and  ST  to  assess  eli-
gibility  for  inclusion,  with  disagreements  (κ = 0.82) 
resolved  by  reaching  a  joint  consensus  between  the 
two  team  members,  or  by  discussion  and  consultation 
with a third author (HC or AS) if consensus could not 
be reached. Websites identified through key Australian 
online directories were compiled into a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet and duplicates were removed (n = 99).

Titles  and  abstracts  from  the  systematic  search  of 
academic  electronic  databases  were  imported  into 
Covidence  software,  and  duplicate  articles  were 
removed  (n = 1,968).  All  remaining  titles  and  abstracts 
(n = 2,579)  were  independently  screened.  Remaining 
full-text articles and, if available, associated service/ini-
tiative  websites  (n = 29)  were  then  screened.  Duplicate 
services  that  were  already  identified  via  the  search  of 
online directories were also removed.

Service/initiative  websites  were  also  suggested  by 
researchers,  lived  experience  advisors,  and  clinicians 
within  the  project  team  or  identified  through  other 
service  websites.  Duplicate  services  that  were  already 
identified via search of online directories and academic 
databases were removed (n = 24).

Evaluations of identified services/initiatives

We  sought  to  identify  evaluations  of  the  men’s  ser-
vices and initiatives included in the review through five 
search  methods  conducted  between  December  2022 
and March 2023:

(1)  Manual  search:  Evaluations  were  identified  via  the 
initial  systematic  search  of  the  scientific  literature 
(see  above)  and  during  data  extraction  from  the 
service/initiative website.

(2)  Google search: A Google search combining the ser-
vice/initiative/organisation name and terms such as 
‘evaluation’ and ‘report’ (see Appendix B for the full 
list of search terms);

(3)  Google  Scholar:  First,  the  name  of  the  service/ini-
tiative/organisation  was  searched.  If  there  were  no 
results,  the  Google  Scholar  search  ceased.  If  there 
were  multiple  results,  the  same  search  terms  from 
the Google search were combined with the service/
initiative/organisation name;

Page 4 of 42

Fig. 1  Adapted PRISMA flowchart

(4)  Website search: A targeted Google site search of the 
website  of  each  service/initiative/organisation  for 
specific terms (see Appendix B for examples);

(5)  DuckDuckGo search: As the Google search engine 
uses  sophisticated  algorithms  to  influence  the 
ranking  of  search  results  [23],  we  complemented 
our  search  methods  using  another  search  engine 
–  DuckDuckGo.  Unlike  Google,  DuckDuckGo 
searches  are  not  influenced  by  past  search  history 
[24].  We  combined  the  same  service/initiative/
organisation  name  and  search  terms  from  search 
method  two  to  detect  any  evaluations  that  may 
have  been  missed  with  the  prior  search  strategies. 
The region was set to Australia to improve the rele-
vance of search results; this does not restrict results 
to  only  those  from  Australia,  but  it  helps  increase 
search results from that region [25].

The  purpose  of  an  evaluation  is  to  assess  a  program’s 
quality  or  value  [26].  As  the  services  included  in  this 
scoping review aim to improve mental health and suicide 
prevention  outcomes,  evaluations  were  only  included 
if  they  assessed  outcomes  for  service  users  that  were 

specific  to  mental  health  and  suicidality  (e.g.,  changes 
in  suicidal  ideation,  depression,  loneliness,  help-seeking 
intentions  and  behaviours),  or  that  captured  the  users’ 
experiences or satisfaction with the service. Other essen-
tial eligibility criteria for this review were that the evalu-
ation should be reported in a primary source, be publicly 
available,  and  clearly  describe  the  methodology  used  to 
obtain outcome data (in order for it to be classified using 
NHMRC Evidence Hierarchy guidelines; see below). Pro-
tocols were excluded in our search. If the same evaluation 
was  reported  in  multiple  formats  (e.g.,  in  a  report  pro-
duced as part of an independent evaluation and the same 
data was later published in a peer-reviewed journal), the 
most rigorous format was included in this review.

In  line  with  scoping  review  guidelines,  and  given  the 
focus  of  this  review  on  the  identification  of  services, 
rather than treatment evaluations, study quality was not 
assessed in this review [27].

Data extraction and synthesis
Services.  Two  authors  (AS  and  NMR)  independently 
extracted  data 
into  a  customised  Microsoft  Excel 
spreadsheet.  All  disagreements  were  resolved  through 

Slade et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1593 

Page 5 of 42

discussion  between  the  two  authors.  Data  extracted  for 
included services were: service name and website, target 
population,  service  status  (active/inactive),  the  cost  to 
user (free/paid), components offered by the service (e.g., 
awareness/education,  gatekeeper  training,  clinical  inter-
vention etc.), the mode of delivery (e.g., in person, online 
etc.), the service location (e.g., national, or specific states 
or  cities),  whether  the  service  described  suicide  preven-
tion as an explicit aim, service usage, and whether or not 
the service had been evaluated.

We also extracted information on the funding arrange-
ments  for  each  service  or  initiative  using  the  Austral-
ian  Charities  and  Not-for-profits  Commission  (ACNC) 
website  (https:// www. acnc. gov. au/).  The  ACNC  is  the 
national  regulator  for  charities  in  Australia  and  main-
tains  a  public  register  of  information  about  registered 
charities, including their sources of revenue. We adapted 
the revenue categories listed on the ACNC website: gov-
ernment  funding,  donations  and  bequests  (which  could 
include  from  individuals  and  organisations),  revenue 
from  goods  and  services,  and  other  revenue  (includ-
ing  from  investments).  For  those  registered  with  the 
ACNC,  we  extracted  whether  they  received  revenue  for 
each  category  (‘Yes’/’No’).  For  those  not  registered,  or 
whose registration was revoked, we examined their web-
site, associated research, and grey literature (e.g., annual 
reports) for information on funding arrangements.

Next,  we  examined  only  those  services  that  were  reg-
istered  on  ACNC,  extracting  data  on  the  proportion  of 
funding  received  from  each  of  the  revenue  categories 
noted  above.  For  organisations  with  multiple  initiatives 
(i.e.,  Beyond  Blue,  Black  Dog  Institute,  Movember),  we 
extracted  funding  data  from  the  ACNC  website  for  the 
overarching  organisation  rather  than  the  specific  initia-
tive within the organisation. This was because the ACNC 
website only provided funding information for the over-
arching organisations.

Between search completion and data extraction, some 
of the included services were discontinued or their web-
sites  had  become  inaccessible  (n = 12).  Where  possible, 
data were extracted using a digital archive (n = 6), where 
the URL was searched in a digital library to find the last 
available version of the webpage. The remaining services 
had  insufficient  information  available  to  determine  the 
components offered and were excluded at the extraction 
stage (n = 6).

Evaluations.  Two  authors  (AS  and  HF)  indepen-
dently  extracted  data  into  a  customised  Microsoft  Excel 
spreadsheet.  Disagreements  (κ = 0.36)  were  resolved 
through  discussion  between  the  two  authors,  or  with 
a  third  author  (ST)  if  consensus  could  not  be  reached. 
The  following  data  was  also  extracted  by  AS  and  HF: 
description  of  service/initiative,  description  of  the  key 

evaluation  (e.g.,  time  points,  sample  size),  outcomes 
assessed  (e.g.,  presence  of  suicidal  ideation,  depression, 
loneliness, help-seeking intentions and behaviours), find-
ings  of  the  key  evaluation,  whether  the  evaluation  was 
peer-reviewed,  the  total  number  of  evaluations  for  each 
service/initiative,  the  total  number  of  peer-reviewed 
evaluations for each service/initiative, and the evaluation 
methodology  (e.g.,  randomised  controlled  trial  [RCT], 
pre-post intervention).

We  did  not  assess  the  quality  of  included  evaluations 
using a multi-item assessment tool given that such assess-
ments are not typically included in scoping reviews [27]. 
However,  we  classified  evaluation  methodology  using 
a  similar  approach  to  the  Aboriginal  and  Torres  Strait 
Islander  Suicide  Prevention  Evaluation  Project,  which 
used  an  evidence  classification  scale  adapted  from  the 
NHMRC Evidence Hierarchy in their meta-evaluation of 
suicide  prevention  programs  [28]  (please  see  Appendix 
C). This hierarchy classifies evaluations according to their 
methodology,  with  higher  levels  of  the  hierarchy  corre-
sponding  with  a  higher  level  of  evidence.  Ratings  using 
this tool therefore also provide an indicator of evaluation 
quality.

If  multiple  evaluations  existed  for  a  single  service/ini-
tiative, information was extracted for the key evaluation. 
The key evaluation was selected based on a combination 
of factors, such as the quality and comprehensiveness of 
the  evaluation,  and  all  other  evaluations  were  summa-
rised in a column for additional evaluations.

Synthesis.  A  narrative  synthesis  approach  was  under-
taken to summarise findings in relation to each identified 
variable.

Results
Service characteristics

A  total  of  5,177  websites  and  articles  were  identified 
across  three  search  methods.  Following  screening  and 
removal  of  duplicates,  there  were  88  services  and  ini-
tiatives that met inclusion criteria. Characteristics of the 
services and initiatives including all components offered 
are presented in Table 1, and the service landscape is vis-
ualised in Fig. 2.

Services and initiatives were diverse in their target pop-
ulations, mode of delivery, and whether there was a cost 
to  the  user.  A  total  of  47  (53.4%)  services  targeted  men 
in general, 22 (25%) targeted specific groups of men (e.g., 
new and expecting fathers, elderly men in aged care), and 
19  (21.6%)  targeted  male-dominated  industries  (e.g.,  the 
construction  industry,  the  Australian  Defence  Force). 
Regarding  cost,  42  (47.7%)  services  offered  completely 
free  components,  12  (13.6%)  offered  only  paid  compo-
nents,  19  (21.6%)  services  offered  a  combination  of  free

and  paid  components,  and  15  (17%)  did  not  report  the 
cost of their service on their webpage.

There  were  41  (46.6%)  services/initiatives  that  offered 
a  component  in  one  modality  (e.g.,  online  only),  while 
46  (52.3%)  offered  a  combination  of  delivery  modes. 
One  service  did  not  have  information  available  about 
how  their  program  was  delivered.  The  most  common 
modes of delivery were in person, followed by online (see 
Table 2). Some of the unique offerings included delivery 
via digital app (e.g., MindMax), SMS (SMS4dads), or tel-
evision (the Man Up documentary).

Forty-seven  (53.4%)  services  were  available  nationally, 
while  32  (36.4%)  were  delivered  in  specific  geographi-
cal areas, such as one of Australia’s states and territories 
(e.g., Coach the Coach training was rolled out to multiple 
sports  clubs  in  Victoria),  or  a  specific  town  or  city  (e.g., 
Menslink  supports  young  men  in  Canberra).  Another  5 
services (5.7%) were delivered across multiple states (e.g., 
Trojan’s  Trek  run  programs  in  Queensland  and  South 
Australia).  There  was  insufficient  information  to  deter-
mine location for four of the services.
the 

services/initiatives 
described  their  aim  to  be  specific  to  suicide  prevention, 
while  the  remaining  services  described  their  aims  to  be 
related  to  mental  health.  Thirty-nine  (44.3%)  services 
reported service usage information, either on their web-
page, in reports or published papers.

Twenty-eight 

(31.8%)  of 

Of the 88 services, 18 (20.5%) offered only one compo-
nent while the majority (70; 79.5%) offered two or more 
components.  The  components  offered  are  summarised 
below, with further detail available in Table 1.

Awareness and/or education

The most common component was awareness or educa-
tion, which was offered by 74 (84.1%) services and initia-
tives, with 10 of these services offering this as their sole 
component.  Many  of  these  services  were  predominately 
online  and  aimed  to  raise  awareness  or  reduce  stigma 
related  to  mental  health  and  suicide  by  providing  fact

sheets, information, resources or educational modules on 
topics related to mental health and suicide, help-seeking, 
or  having  conversations  about  mental  health  and  sui-
cide with friends and family (e.g., Beyond Blue Dadvice, 
Movember Conversations). Others provided similar con-
tent via in-person facilitated workshops, or in addition to 
online information or virtual workshops (e.g., Men’s Talk, 
Tomorrow  Man),  and  one  provided  similar  content  via 
an app (MindMax). There were also two awareness cam-
paigns targeting men which aimed to reduce stigma asso-
ciated with help-seeking for men (Boys Do Cry, Man Up). 
Other initiatives included an awareness-focused support 
group (Victorian Brotherhood) and initiatives for mental 
health  conversations  while  having  a  haircut  (The  Barter 
Barber, Might & Mane).

Social and/or peer support

There  were  40  (45.5%)  services  that  included  social  or 
peer  support  components.  Many  offered  social  and 
community  events  such  as  meetups,  barbecues,  crea-
tive  activities,  walks  or  fundraising  events  to  provide 
an  opportunity  for  men  to  gather  and  connect  with 
one  another  (e.g.,  Mongrels  Men,  TOMNET,  When  No 
One’s  Watching).  Other  services  provided  formalised 
peer mentoring in either a one-to-one (e.g., Mentors for 
Men,  Mentoring  Men)  or  a  group  setting  (e.g.,  Circle  of 
Men, The  Men’s  Table).  A  number  of  initiatives  focused 
on  exercise  and/or  connection  with  nature  as  a  setting 
for  social  and  peer  support  (e.g.,  Beyond  the  Barbell, 
Movember  WOW  Sand  n’  Surf ),  or  peer  support  and 
therapy  (e.g.,  Trojan’s  Trek).  Many  of  the  services  offer-
ing  social  or  peer  support  also  had  resources  targeting 
awareness or education. There were only six services that 
provided  social  support  or  peer  support  as  their  only 
component.

Clinical or therapeutic services

A  total  of  28  (31.8%)  services  provided  clinical  or  ther-
apeutic  sessions  tailored  to  men,  including  counsel-
ling,  clinical  psychology,  or  group  therapy. The  majority 
offered  telehealth  or  online  sessions  as  an  option  (e.g., 
Blokes  Psychology,  Mantle,  MOSH),  while  a  few  offered 
only  in-person  sessions  (e.g.,  Men’s  Resource  Centre). 
Some  services  included  online  or  app-based  self-help 
that  incorporated  clinical  or  therapeutic  intervention 
components  (e.g.,  HeadGear,  ifarmwell).  One  additional 
initiative  aimed  to  provide  clinical  training  to  mental 
health  professionals  who  work  with  men  (Movember 
Men in Mind).

Gatekeeper training

A  total  of  13  (14.8%)  services  provided  formalised  sui-
cide prevention gatekeeper training to men in workplace 

 Slade et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1593 

Page 24 of 42

settings  (e.g.,  Mates  in  Construction,  Incolink  Bluehats 
Program, OzHelp) or to community leaders (e.g., Coach 
the  Coach,  Alive  and  Kicking  Goals)  in  order  to  upskill 
people in recognising and responding to suicidal distress. 
One service also provided gatekeeper training to barbers 
(Might and Mane). All of the services that included gate-
keeper training also offered other components.

Referral

Another key component offered by 10 (11.4%) of the ser-
vices and initiatives was referral or linkage to other types 
of  services,  such  as  crisis  or  short-term  accommoda-
tion,  employment  and  educational  pathways  programs, 
and  workshops,  support  services  or  programs  for  spe-
cific  issues  such  as  violent  behaviour  or  difficulty  sleep-
ing  (e.g.,  EveryMan  Australia,  Open  Arms,  Soldier  On). 
Other services provided advice and referral to local men-
tal health services and supports (e.g., You Got This Mate).

Helplines and crisis lines

Helplines were offered by 10 (11.4%) of the services. Two 
of  the  identified  services  were  dedicated  helplines  for 
men (MensLine) and current and ex-serving ADF mem-
bers (Australian Defence Force All Hours Support Line). 
Some  services  included  a  helpline  or  callback  service  in 
addition to other offerings (e.g., Gidget Foundation Sup-
port for Dads, TIACS).

Services targeting male‑dominated industries

Many  of  the  identified  services  and  initiatives  targeted 
male-dominated  industries  such  as  construction  and 
mining (e.g., Mates in Construction, The Healthy Tradie 
Project),  farming  (e.g.,  The  Ripple  Effect,  ifarmwell), 
transport  and  logistics  workers  (e.g.,  OzHelp,  Healthy 
Heads  in  Trucks  and  Sheds),  and  emergency  services 
workers  (e.g.,  Black  Dog  Institute  Bush  Fires  Support 
Service,  now  named  the  National  Emergency  Worker 
Support Service). A variety of services also targeted cur-
rent  and  ex-serving  members  of  the  Australian  Defence 
Force (e.g., Australian Defence Force Suicide Prevention 
Program,  Mates4Mates,  Open  Arms).  These  services 
were not exclusive to men and often consisted of multiple 
components delivered in workplace settings.

Other

Other  unique  components  were  offered  by  29  (33.0%) 
of services and  initiatives, which included  case  manage-
ment,  critical  incident  support  and  postvention  (e.g., 
Mates  in  Construction),  outreach  initiatives  such  as 
physical and mental health checks available ‘on the road’ 
(e.g.,  OzHelp),  and  exercise  sessions  and  mindfulness 
(e.g., The Healthy Tradie Project, Beyond the Barbell).

Funding
Half  of  the  services  or  initiatives  (n = 44)  were  either 
directly registered or under an organisation that was reg-
istered  with  the  ACNC.  There  were  36  (40.9%)  unique 
services  registered,  and  8  (9.1%)  initiatives  linked  to 
overarching organisations (Beyond Blue n = 3; Black Dog 
Institute  n = 2;  Movember  n = 3).  Of  all  the  identified 
services/initiatives  included  in  this  review,  35  (39.8%) 
received  government  funding,  43  (48.9%)  received  rev-
enue  from  goods  or  services  (e.g.,  paid  psychology  ses-
sions,  workshop  fees),  and  26  (29.5%)  received  some 
other  form  of  revenue  (including  from  investments). 
Funding  information  was  lacking  for  a  large  proportion 
of  services/initiatives  that  were  not  registered  with  the 
ACNC (see Table 3).

For  services/initiatives  that  were  registered  with  the 
ACNC (Table 4), the average proportion of total revenue 
coming from government funding was 34.0% (SD = 0.4%, 
range  0%  to  94.9%).  The  average  proportion  for  dona-
tions and bequests was 36.1% (SD = 0.3%, range 0.40% to 
100%). Revenue from goods and services was on average 
18.2% of total revenue (SD = 0.3%, range 0% to 97.2%) and 
other  forms  of  income  were  11.7%  (SD = 0.2%,  range  0% 
to 84.5%).

Service outcomes and evaluations

Twenty of the 88 services included in this review (22.7%) 
had  a  published  or  publicly  available  evaluation  (see 
Table  5).  There  was  a  total  of  45  evaluations  across  the 
20 services, 34 of which were peer-reviewed. Fifteen ser-
vices had at least one evaluation that was published in a 
peer-reviewed  journal.  The  number  of  evaluations  per 
service ranged from 1–14 (see Fig. 3).

Of the services that had been evaluated, most had only 
one  evaluation  (n = 12,  60%).  The  service  with  the  most 
evaluations  (most  of  which  were  peer-reviewed)  was 
Mates  in  Construction  (and  in  Mining/in  Energy).  Only 
three  services  (HeadGear,  Man  Up  and  a  smartphone 
intervention delivered as part of Mates in Construction) 
used  a  RCT  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  their  offer-
ings. All RCTs were published in peer-reviewed journals. 
Pre-post  intervention  designs  were  the  most  common 
(used  in  20  of  the  45  evaluations;  44.4%),  followed  by 
mixed methods (used in 11 of the 45 evaluations; 24.4%). 
The  frequency  of  evidence  classifications  across  the  dif-
ferent evaluations are summarised in Table 6.

Of  the  20  pre-post  evaluations,  two  were  pilot  stud-
ies  (HeadGear  [29],  and  Men  in  Mind  [30];  both  peer-
reviewed)  and  one  assessed  outcomes  for  the  first  100 
clients  after  implementing  a  new  therapy  (Open  Arms 
[31]; peer-reviewed). Six of the pre-post evaluations used 
non-validated  measures  [32–37],  and  a  further  three

changes  to  suicide  stigma  and  literacy  scores  measured 
through validated scales [49]. For both the pre-post and 
mixed method evaluations, non-validated measures were 
commonly used for assessing awareness and beliefs about 
suicide,  and  the  perceived  usefulness  of  the  program 
about  the  program  (e.g.,  questions  about  whether  users 
would  recommend  the  program,  whether  they  found  it 
helpful).

The  key  findings  of  included  evaluations  are  sum-
marised  in  Table  5.  Evaluations  of  awareness-based  and 
gatekeeper  training  services  tended  to  find  an  improve-
ment in awareness of signs of mental ill health and suici-
dality, and improved awareness of how to seek help (e.g., 
Prevention  is  the  Only  Cure  [32],  HALT  [50],  Incolink 
[46], Mates in Construction [51], Coach the Coach [41], 
MindMax  [52]).  However,  few  evaluations  assessed 
actual  help-seeking  or  use  of  skills  to  help  others.  One

evaluation  of  a  gatekeeper  training  service  (which  was 
peer-reviewed)  reported  that  there  was  no  change  in 
the use of skills to help others and no evidence of trans-
fer  of  training  benefit  to  others  (Coach  the  Coach  [41]). 
Only  one  awareness-based  initiative  was  evaluated  in  a 
peer-reviewed RCT (Man Up [53]), which found that the 
intervention was effective in improving help-seeking atti-
tudes.  However,  the  effect  was  small  (SMD  of  0.13)  and 
the  authors  did  not  examine  any  behavioural  outcomes 
such  as  actual  help-seeking.  A  separate  peer-reviewed 
evaluation of a website accompanying the Man Up cam-
paign  measured  help-seeking  behaviour  operationalised 
as  clicks  on  links  to  support  organisations  and  number 
of  downloads  of  health  information  [47].  However,  the 
authors  did  not  include  a  control  group  or  establish  a 
baseline.

Key  evaluations  of  services  offering  a  clinical/thera-
peutic or peer support component (of which 7 out of 12 
were  peer-reviewed)  mostly  revealed  improvements  in 
mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, dis-
tress,  wellbeing  and  life  satisfaction  (e.g.,  ifarmwell  [54], 
Mates4Mates [55], Open Arms [56], Tools for Depression 
[39],  Trojan’s  Trek  [57],  Menslink  [58],  The  Men’s  Table 
[44]).  However,  improvements  were  often  not  sustained 
at  long-term  follow-up.  Moreover,  not  all  evaluations 
utilised  validated  questionnaires.  Two  smartphone  apps 
were  evaluated  in  peer-reviewed  RCTs  (HeadGear  and 
the  ‘MATESmobile’  smartphone  app  delivered  as  part 
of  Mates  in  Construction).  The  evaluation  of  HeadGear 
found  that  this  intervention  was  effective  in  reducing 
depressive symptoms and improving wellbeing and resil-
ience, but not anxiety symptoms [59]. The MATESmobile 
app increased intentions to seek help from MATES work-
ers  to  a  greater  extent  than  face-to-face  training  alone, 
but there were no significant changes in suicide preven-
tion literacy or intentions to seek formal or informal help 
[60]. The authors noted for both smartphone app evalu-
ations  that  effect  sizes  were  small  (HeadGear:  Cohen’s 

d = 0.15; MATESmobile: Cohen’s d = −0.14). One uncon-
trolled peer-reviewed evaluation of a training course for 
health  practitioners  working  with  male  clients  demon-
strated  a  significant  pre-post  treatment  improvement 
in  self-reported  competency  in  engaging  male  clients  in 
therapy, with a large effect size (Δ = 2.04) [30].

Notably,  no  evaluations  assessed  suicide-specific 
outcomes  (e.g.,  severity  of  suicidality,  suicide  deaths), 
aside  from  awareness  of  suicide  risk  factors  and  how  to 
respond to those who may be suicidal.

Discussion
This scoping review characterises the suicide prevention 
service  landscape  for  men  in  Australia  and  summarises 
service  and  initiative  evaluations.  We  identified  a  total 
of  88  services  that  were  diverse  in  their  aims,  how  they 
are delivered, and who they specifically target. However, 
services  and  initiatives  appeared  to  be  siloed,  with  con-
siderable overlap in the types of components offered. The 
most  common  component  offered  by  services  and  ini-
tiatives  was  awareness  and/or  education.  Approximately 
half  of  the  included  services  were  available  nationally 
(largely  due  to  being  online  or  over  the  phone).  How-
ever,  services  still  differed  in  their  reach  and  accessibil-
ity, with many services being small in scale and resources. 
Additionally,  only  22.7%  of  services  and  initiatives  have 
been formally evaluated and existing evaluations vary in 
quality.

Contrary  to  the  belief  that  there  is  a  lack  of  services 
that  specifically  target  men,  the  current  review  reveals 
that  the  service  landscape  for  Australian  men  is  broad. 
Of  the  88  services  identified  in  this  review,  78.4%  tar-
geted  either  specific  groups  of  men  or  men  in  general 
(e.g.,  Blokes  Psychology)  while  the  remaining  21.6%  of 
services targeted male-dominated industries (e.g., Mates 
in Construction). While we have demonstrated that there 
are  many  services  specifically  targeted  at  men,  it  is  still 
unknown whether these services do a better job of engag-
ing men, particularly given that not all services have pro-
vided  data  about  service  uptake  and  demand.  It  is  also 
unclear  whether  these  services  achieve  better  outcomes 
compared to services that are not male-specific, with no 
identified  evaluations  having  assessed  this  question.  As 
such, it is important that future evaluations consider gen-
der differences in service outcomes and uptake.

Services  offered  a  range  of  components,  with  almost 
80%  of  services  offering  two  or  more  components.  The 
various  offerings  of  existing  services  have  the  potential 
to address the diverse needs of men. For example, online 
information  and  resources  may  be  particularly  appeal-
ing for some groups of men as they meet needs for self-
reliance  and  anonymity  [61].  Other  groups  of  men  may 
highly  regard  the  involvement  of  peer  workers  [62].

Although the services varied in their approach, there was 
still considerable overlap in the types of components they 
offered,  suggesting  a  lack  of  cohesion  within  the  service 
landscape.

The most common component offered by services was 
awareness,  education,  and  resources.  Awareness-based 
initiatives are likely common because this type of compo-
nent is less resource intensive [63], but it is essential that 
these  are  developed  based  on  an  understanding  of  what 
processes  or  ‘active  ingredients’  may  result  in  changes 
to  attitudes,  intentions,  or  behaviours  [64].  In  terms  of 
their  effectiveness,  past  research  suggests  public  aware-
ness campaigns can improve help-seeking behaviour, but 
there is mixed evidence for reductions in suicidal behav-
iour  [65].  One  campaign  targeted  at  men  in  Québec, 
Canada increased awareness and visits to suicide preven-
tion  websites,  but  there  was  no  evidence  of  changes  to 
help-seeking intentions or behaviours, or rates of suicide 
[66].  Another  suicide  prevention  awareness  campaign 
that targeted men in Nagoya, Japan observed short-term 
reductions in suicides, but this effect was not maintained 
long-term [67]. Awareness-based campaigns appear to be 
more effective when they are delivered as part of a multi-
faceted  suicide  prevention  strategy  than  as  a  standalone 
initiative [68], particularly for long-term impact [14].

In  the  current  review,  services  or  initiatives  with  an 
awareness-based  component  that  had  been  evaluated 
were  found  to  be  effective  in  increasing  knowledge  and 
awareness  of  mental  health  symptoms  and  how  to  seek 
help, but no studies found or assessed changes in actual 
help-seeking.  For  example,  the  Man  Up  documentary 
and MindMax Australian Football League (AFL)-themed 
mental  health  app  both  increased  help-seeking  inten-
tions  [52,  53],  however,  this  may  not  translate  to  help-
seeking behaviours, as was the case in a review of suicide 
prevention  awareness  campaigns  across  other  countries 
[68].  Ultimately,  the  number  of  awareness  and  educa-
tion-based campaigns within the Australian male suicide 
prevention  landscape  appears  to  be  disproportionate  to 
men’s preferences for informal forms of support, such as 
social  groups  or  community-based  support  [14],  high-
lighting  the  need  to  develop  and  evaluate  services  that 
are codesigned with service users and other stakeholders 
(e.g., funders, clinicians, researchers).

Despite  a  broad  men’s  service  landscape  in  Australia, 
few  services  had  been  formally  evaluated.  Of  the  88 
services  included  in  this  review,  only  20  services  had  a 
published  or  publicly  available  evaluation,  and  evalua-
tions  varied  widely  in  the  outcomes  assessed,  preclud-
ing  direct  comparisons  in  the  effectiveness  of  services. 
The small proportion of evaluated services indicates that 
the community is being offered services that may not be 
effective in addressing their needs. Most of the identified 

evaluations were pre-post intervention studies, with only 
three  evaluations  using  an  RCT  design,  the  gold  stand-
ard for effectiveness research [69]. Many of the included 
services and initiatives likely do not have the resources or 
capacity to spare for running intensive RCTs, particularly 
given  that  several  services/initiatives  were  formed  by 
individuals  or  small  groups  within  the  community  who 
do not have expertise in research or evaluation (although 
may  have  lived  experience  of  suicidality  and/or  mental 
health  difficulties).  Additionally,  the  settings  in  which 
these  services  are  delivered  make  it  difficult  to  design 
an  RCT  (e.g.,  challenging  to  assign  individuals  to  a  pla-
cebo  or  another  treatment  condition  in  a  non-research 
setting).

Mates  in  Construction  (and  in  Energy  and  Mining), 
a  workplace-based  initiative  that  provides  suicide  pre-
vention  awareness  and  gatekeeper  training,  was  the 
most  extensively  evaluated  using  a  range  of  methodolo-
gies.  The  evidence  suggests  their  offerings  are  effective 
at  changing  beliefs  about  suicide  and  suicide  preven-
tion  [35],  improving  mental  health  literacy  and  increas-
ing  help-seeking  behaviours  [70].  Further,  an  economic 
evaluation of this service suggested their offerings could 
potentially save an estimated AUD$3.66 million annually 
by  averting  fatalities,  full  incapacity,  and  short  absences 
due  to  suicide  and  self-harm  [71].  Considering  the  suc-
cess  of  workplace-based  programs  demonstrated  in  the 
evaluations identified in the present review [51, 71], and 
past evidence about the utility of workplace interventions 
[72],  it  is  recommended  that  funding  bodies  continue 
development  of  suicide  prevention  initiatives  within 
workplaces.  Workplace-based  interventions  provide  an 
opportunity to easily access individuals who may not seek 
help otherwise [73].

Satisfaction  and  subjective  ratings  of  improvement 
were  frequently  used  to  measure  the  impact  of  a  pro-
gram.  While  these  are  considered  valuable  outcomes, 
it  is  recommended  that  they  are  assessed  in  a  rigorous 
way [74]. The rigour of measuring these outcomes varied 
across the evaluations. For example, in the evaluation of 
Menslink  [58],  participants  were  asked  to  provide  esti-
mated  scores  for  their  life  and  relationship  satisfaction 
‘pre’  and  ‘post’  intervention  retrospectively  when  pro-
viding  their  ‘follow-up’  score  during  an  interview,  thus 
making them prone to recall bias. Some evaluations used 
broad questions or statements to assess satisfaction (e.g., 
“Overall  the  program  was  helpful”  [39]),  while  others 
assessed  whether  the  program  improved  more  specific 
outcomes  (e.g.,  “Presentation  increased  knowledge  of 
how to respond to a suicidal person” [32]). Tools such as 
the  Multi-Dimensional  Treatment  Satisfaction  Measure 
could be adapted to more thoroughly assess the different 
components  of  satisfaction  with  services;  its  strength  is

Table 7  Summary of policy and service development recommendations

• Continue development of services within workplaces

• Offer infrastructure for grassroots organisations to capture service-use data

• Consider the broader social determinants of health

• Ensure that program design and delivery are informed by co-design

• Do not fund well-established services that do not have an evidence base, and support and favour transparency in the not-for-profit sector

• Require funded organisations to capture service-use and outcome data and encourage rigorous evaluations to assess the effectiveness of services 
in achieving intended outcomes

• Include the use of services as routine questions in Coroner’s reports

• Set up an advisory group within the new Mental Health Commission structures to guide the sector

that it assesses multiple aspects of satisfaction relating to 
the  person’s  experience  of  the  process  and  outcomes  of 
treatment [75]. A measure such as this would allow ser-
vices to capture more nuanced information about users’ 
satisfaction with their offerings.

The  lack  of  evaluation  also  raises  questions  about 
how  services  are  funded  and  whether  funding  is  being 
directed towards services and initiatives that are effective 
in  improving  mental  health  or  suicide  prevention  out-
comes. Services  and initiatives were funded by a variety 
of  sources  including  government  funding,  donations  or 
bequests,  goods  and  services,  and  profits  from  invest-
ments.  While  the  ACNC  register  provides  visibility  for 
registered  services/initiatives,  it  was  difficult  to  deter-
mine  funding  arrangements  for  the  remaining  50%  of 
services/initiatives that were not registered. Given that a 
proportion of services were no longer available between 
screening and data extraction, this may also indicate dif-
ficulties with obtaining or sustaining funding, which has 
negative  implications  for  service  users  in  terms  of  con-
tinuity  of  care.  Services  are  likely  to  face  challenges  in 
navigating  different  funding  streams,  shifting  policies, 
and  mental  health  priorities  [76].  However,  there  must 
be  accountability  and  transparency  around  whether 
funding is used to support evidence-based services. It is 
recommended that policymakers and funding bodies do 
not fund mature or well-established services that do not 
have an evidence base, support and favour transparency 
and competency in the not-for-profit sector, and require 
funded organisations to capture data on service use and 
outcomes (see Table 7 for a summary of policy and ser-
vice development recommendations).

The lack of evaluations may also point to a lack of avail-
able funding and resources for high-quality evaluations or 
data collection. As such, it is also recommended that pol-
icymakers  offer  the  infrastructure  for  grassroots  organi-
sations  to  capture  data  on  service  use  and  outcomes. 
Such funding could also be utilised by local services that 
have insights into the unique needs of their local commu-
nities, to develop and evaluate peer-led interventions and 

initiatives. These interventions should be informed by co-
design  that  aims  to  instil  diverse  masculinities  into  pro-
gram design and delivery. We also encourage that the use 
of suicide prevention and mental health-related services 
should  be  included  as  routine  questions  in  Coroner’s 
reports  as  an  additional  way  of  evaluating  the  uptake  of 
suicide  prevention  services  among  the  population  that 
these services target.

Strengths and limitations

There are several key strengths of the current review. To 
our  knowledge,  this  was  the  first  scoping  review  of  the 
men’s  service  landscape  for  mental  health  and  suicide 
prevention  in  Australia,  and  to  the  best  of  our  knowl-
edge, the first to be conducted worldwide. We employed 
a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant ser-
vices and initiatives and to identify relevant evaluations, 
with  searches  performed  of  both  the  peer-reviewed  and 
grey  literature. This  comprehensive  search  allowed  for  a 
detailed  overview  of  the  Australian  men’s  service  land-
scape,  including  information  about  service  offerings, 
funding and evidence-base.

There  are  also  a  number  of  limitations  of  the  current 
review.  Some  services  for  men  were  excluded  from  this 
review  as  they  do  not  explicitly  state  suicide  prevention 
or  improving  mental  health  in  their  aims,  even  though 
they may be seen as part of the men’s landscape in Aus-
tralia by various stakeholders (e.g., Australian Men’s Shed 
Association).  Services  may  avoid  using  these  phrases 
to  reduce  stigma  associated  with  service  use  or  to  have 
a  broader  appeal.  Broadening  the  inclusion  criteria  to 
capture  such  services  would  have  meant  including  ser-
vices unrelated to suicide prevention and mental health. 
The  exclusion  criterion  we  used  also  meant  we  did  not 
include services that may indirectly target mental health 
or  suicide  by  focusing  on  risk  factors  such  as  financial 
difficulties,  childhood  abuse  (e.g.,  Supporting  Male  Sur-
vivors  of  Childhood  Sexual  Abuse)  and  social  isolation 
(e.g.,  Average  Joes,  Blokes  Lounge).  Nevertheless,  these 
services play an important role in the suicide prevention 

 Slade et al. BMC Public Health         (2025) 25:1593

landscape, given the role of social determinants of men-
tal health [77], and it is recommended that these services 
are evaluated in terms of their impact on suicide-related 
outcomes.

We are aware that additional evaluations have been pub-
lished since the evaluation search end date (e.g., an RCT for 
Men in Mind [78]). Additionally, some services have added 
or removed components, or become inactive entirely. This 
is a dynamic space, with new services often appearing and 
existing  services  disappearing.  This  review  still  captures  a 
snapshot  of  the  service  landscape  and  highlights  systemic 
issues  that  exist  within  this  landscape  (i.e.,  overlap  and 
redundancies  between  services,  and  lack  of  evaluation). 
Additionally,  while  we  used  the  NHMRC  Evidence  Hier-
archy to classify evaluations according to their level of evi-
dence, this tool did not allow us to assess quality indicators 
specific to different study designs. Quality assessment was 
not performed based on current scoping reviews guidelines 
[27], although it is likely that evaluations varied within each 
classification  (e.g.,  pre-post  intervention  designs  may  not 
always use validated questionnaires).

This review characterises the mental health and suicide 
prevention  service  landscape  in  a  high-income  country, 
which is likely similar to other high-income countries. For 
low-  and  middle-income  countries,  there  may  be  unique 
cultural  considerations  and  challenges  (e.g.,  inequity  and 
injustice), and fewer resources and funding [1]. Neverthe-
less, some of the recommendations we have made will still 
be  valuable  (e.g.,  evidence-based  services  and  initiatives, 
monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  focusing  on  the  social 
determinants  of  health  [79])  to  ensure  that  resources  are 
not wasted on ineffective approaches in these contexts.

Conclusions
Our review found that there was a plethora of services for 
Australian men at risk of suicide, with much duplication 
and overlap. There was a lack of high-quality evaluations, 
and  service  use  data  was  not  systematically  collected. 
Our  previous  work  suggests  that  some  men  seek  help 
from these organisations but not all men do so [80]. The 
focus should not be developing new services but instead 
on  evaluating  and  improving  the  quality  and  reach  of 
existing services. It is important to reduce redundancies 
in  the  components  they  offer,  and  ensure  that  these  are 
in line with men’s preferences for support [14]. This will 
allow for a more cohesive and effective approach to male 
suicide prevention.
