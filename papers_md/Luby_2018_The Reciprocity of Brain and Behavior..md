The Reciprocity of Brain and Behavior

Joan L. Luby, MD
Washington University in St. Louis.

The rise of neuroscience in our field has raised legitimate questions about the relative value 
of brain versus behavioral data to inform our understanding of the etiology and treatment of 
childhood mental disorders. There is no doubt that data on brain function and structure has 
wielded unique power and influence in mental health research over the last two decades. 
This may be based in part on its inherent objective and quantitative features in a field that 
has searched for, and thus far generally failed to find, clearly measurable markers of 
psychopathology for clinical use. However, it may also be based on a reductionist 
philosophy that posits that the brain is the source and driver of all human emotions and 
behavior and therefore should be of central importance. Contrasting this view, recent 
neuroscience perspectives have emphasized that detailed studies of behavior are essential to 
inform neuroscience1. While the brain basis of behavior is clear, this reductionist approach 
also fails to take into account the more reciprocal nature of brain behavior relationships in 
which emotions, behavior and life experience can also influence and change the brain2,3.

In the article “Preschool and School-Age Irritability Predict Reward-Related Brain 
Function” by Dougherty et al, the authors demonstrate a relationship between early life 
irritability and functional connectivity within reward networks measured at school age.4 The 
article provides an excellent illustration of this issue and the need to account for signals from 
both brain and behavior. Irritability, measured behaviorally during the preschool period and 
again at school age, was related to functional connectivity of reward networks (measured 
during a reward task performed in the scanner), even after controlling for the effects of prior 
or concurrent measures of irritability. Also notable and important, was that irritability at 
preschool and school age was only very weakly correlated. Notwithstanding design 
limitations such as the lack of availability of neuroimaging during the preschool period, this 
study suggests is that irritability displayed behaviorally early in life left a detectable mark on 
brain function later in childhood which remained significant even after accounting for 
concurrent irritable behavior. Importantly, this detectable alteration in brain function was 
specific to the core of the behavioral abnormality in that irritability, which is often 
operationalized as “frustrative non-reward”5 was associated with alteration in brain function

most strongly during experiences of non-reward during the task. Findings suggest a 
relationship between early behavior and later brain function in the same core domain even 
when the behavioral abnormality may no longer be obvious.

There is increasing evidence from multiple empirical studies that measures of brain function 
may provide greater power to detect abnormalities when they are not yet observable, or 
manifest as symptom states. Consistent with this principle, the findings from the Dougherty 
et al paper suggest that brain function abnormalities can be detected related to earlier 
experiences of symptoms when symptoms may no longer be manifest.4 This should not be 
interpreted to suggest that brain imaging should be conducted on our patients as a more 
powerful means of detecting abnormalities. This would be neither pragmatic nor cost 
effective and there is no evidence of its utility in individual patients. However, the use of 
brain imaging may be useful towards the goal of guiding more refined behavioral 
assessments by providing clues from alterations in underlying neural correlates of specific 
emotional and behavioral processes. Such information gleaned from studies targeting brain 
function might then lead to the identification of more subtle and specific symptom 
manifestations and observable developmental processes to enhance early detection and guide 
more targeted prevention prior to clinical symptom manifestation.

Another advantage that measures of brain function may offer are evidenced by the finding in 
the Dougherty et al study that children with high preschool irritability showed alterations in 
connectivity during both receipt and non-receipt of reward.4 This suggests that reactions to 
achieving success and failing to achieve success are both heightened in irritable children, a 
finding that is less evident based on behavioral observations alone which have emphasized 
abnormal response to frustration and non-reward. Along the line of the above, these findings 
suggest further behavioral study of irritable children’s reactions to successful receipt of 
reward should also be the focus of future study and potentially clinical attention.

Another area that the article does not investigate but could in the future, is how behavior 
might better inform our understanding of brain function. Currently, the interpretation of 
connectivity and what it means for emotional and behavioral function remains highly 
ambiguous with studies suggesting that increased connectivity may be associated with better 
regulatory function and other studies suggesting it is associated with higher need and less 
efficient regulation. The current study could potentially inform this issue by using 
concurrent behavior to inform the interpretation of findings of higher or lower connectivity. 
This could be achieved by rating the child’s objective ability and subjective experience of 
emotion regulation during these tasks.

Overall, the current study provides new insights into the nature and later developmental 
consequences of irritability in childhood. Brain measures elucidated alterations in reward 
processing related to early irritability and suggest possible new dimensions of abnormality in 
reward processing less evident by observation. Alternatively, these data could also be useful 
to give more meaning and clinical interpretation of the alterations in brain function regularly 
reported but poorly understood from a behavioral perspective. This study provides a salient 
example of how measures of brain function enhanced our understanding of behavior and

need for careful measurement in both domains to advance the public health.
