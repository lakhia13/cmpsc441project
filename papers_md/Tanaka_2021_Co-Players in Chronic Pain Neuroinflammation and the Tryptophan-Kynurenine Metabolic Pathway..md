Abstract: Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs more
than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing. Recently, nociplastic pain has
been introduced as a descriptor of the mechanism of pain, which is due to the disturbance of neural
processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic
pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)
compiled a systematic classiﬁcation of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was
published in 2018 and will ofﬁcially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International
Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health
Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in
chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic
pain are missing. Earlier pain disorder was deﬁned as a condition with chronic pain associated
with psychological factors, but it was replaced with somatic symptom disorder with predominant
pain in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) in 2013.
Recently clinical nosology is trending toward highlighting neurological pathology of chronic pain,
discounting psychological or social factors in the pathogenesis of pain. This review article discusses
components of the pain pathway, the component-based mechanisms of pain, central and peripheral
sensitization, roles of chronic inﬂammation, and the involvement of tryptophan-kynurenine pathway
metabolites, exploring the participation of psychosocial and behavioral factors in central sensitization
of diseases progressing into the development of chronic pain, comorbid diseases that commonly
present a symptom of chronic pain, and psychiatric disorders that manifest chronic pain without
obvious actual or potential tissue damage.

Chronic pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that persists or recurs
more than three months and may extend beyond the expected time of healing [1,2]. Chronic
pain occurs as a part of symptoms due to an underlying medical condition or remains
despite successful treatment of the condition that originally caused it [3]. Chronic pain
frequently becomes the sole or predominant clinical complaint [4]. The prevalence of
chronic pain estimates as much as 20%, and the incidence reaches about 10% every year of
the world adult population [5]. Nearly 10% of individuals with chronic pain was found
to suffer from moderate to severe debilitating pain [6]. Furthermore, individuals with
severe chronic pain are twice more likely to die of respiratory disease or heart disease than
those with mild pain or without pain [5]. The Global Burden of Disease Research ranked
low back pain and migraine ﬁrst and second place of Years Lived with Disability (YLD),

respectively, and thus, chronic pain imposes a substantial socioeconomic burden directly
and indirectly on society [7].

The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11), classiﬁes
chronic pain into primary and secondary. Primary chronic pain is ﬁbromyalgia or low-back
pain; the secondary chronic pain occurs secondary to an underlying medical condition
subcategorizing into cancer-related, post-trauma, neuropathic, headache and orofacial, vis-
ceral, and musculoskeletal pain. ICD-11 offers minimal options for recording psychological
or social factors in chronic pain [8]. Meanwhile, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) recognizes chronic pain in the diagnosis of somatic
symptom disorder (SSD), having replaced pain disorder, a condition with chronic pain
due to psychological factors [9]. SSD is caused by somatosensory ampliﬁcation, which is
associated with ﬁbromyalgia [10]. The trend toward a neurological explanation obviously
discounts cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathomechanism of chronic
pain. Hyperalgesia is a condition of abnormally increased sensitivity to pain caused by
injury to tissues or nerves. Nociceptive sensation is also caused by exposure to opioids
used for pain treatment, which paradoxically makes individuals more sensitive to cer-
tain stimuli. Hyperalgesia is a challenging issue for pain specialists who treat patients
at terminal care [11]. Chronic pain is often elicited by stimuli that previously did not
provoke discomfort sensation. It is called allodynia. Allodynia is commonly observed in
patients with neuropathies, ﬁbromyalgia, migraine, complex regional pain syndrome, and
postherpetic neuralgia [12]. Chronic pain may proceed to clinical conditions accompanied
often by mood alterations, such as depression, anxiety, anger, cognitive disturbance in-
cluding memory impairment, sleep disturbances, fatigue, loss of libido, and/or disability,
called chronic pain syndrome (CPS). CPS appears to be linked to the dysfunction of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the central nervous system (CNS), but exact
mechanisms remain unknown [13].

Neuroinﬂammation has been intricately linked to the pathogenesis of chronic pain.
Chronic pain was proposed to be caused by the disturbance of peripheral nociception, neu-
ropathy in the somatosensory system, motor system, central and peripheral nociplasticity,
and/or psychosocial system [14]. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic inﬂammation
is strongly tied to aberration in each mechanism of chronic pain. Furthermore, the tryp-
tophan (TRP)–kynurenine (KYN) pathway and its metabolites were observed to play an
important role in neuroinﬂammation and chronic pain [15]. This review article presents the
components of the pain pathway; mechanisms of chronic pain based on the components;
the development of chronic pain through peripheral and central sensitization; evidence
of the presence of chronic neuroinﬂammation in each pain mechanism; the involvement
of the TRP–KYN metabolic pathway; and the need of a psychogenic component in the
pathogenesis of chronic pain.

2. The Pain Pathway, Mechanisms, Neuroinﬂammation, and Tryptophan Metabolism

Pain perception is signaling through the pain pathway, whose components consist
of transduction, conduction, transmission, modulation, and perception. Transduction is
the process by which noxious or potentially damaging stimuli activate the nociceptors to
convert to neural signals. Transmission refers to the signal transfer from the peripheral
neurons to the second-order neurons in the spinal cord, which wire the signals to the
thalamus and brain stem in the brain. Pain modulation takes place by inhibition of pain
signaling in the spinal cord and the activation of the descending inhibitory ﬁbers. The
third-order neurons project to the somatosensory cortex, enabling the perception of pain.
Perception is the subjective awareness in connection with arousal, physiological, and
behavioral brain centers, involving the integration of psychological processes such as
attention, expectation, and interpretation [16–18] (Figure 1).

Pain is a complex and intricate process attributable to nociceptic, neuropathic, and/or
neuroplastic mechanisms. The most common type of pain is nociceptive pain caused by
damage or potentially harmful to peripheral tissues involving nociceptors responsible for
transduction. Neuropathic pain is caused by lesions or diseases affecting the somatosensory
nervous system responsible for the transmission of peripheral to central pain signals.
Nociplastic pain refers to the condition caused by altered nociceptive processing without
actual or potentially harmful tissue damage activating peripheral nociceptors (nociceptive
pain) or without lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system (neuropathic
pain). Cortical perception is one of the main components in the pain pathway; however, the
ICD-11 excludes psychogenic pain [19] (Figure 2). Thus, participation of cortical perception
in chronic pain mechanisms remains ambiguous.

Inﬂammation is generally involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases and plays
a key role in diseases that cause chronic pain [20]. Resident and recruited immune cells
release inﬂammatory mediators at peripheral nerve innervating damaged or inﬂammatory
tissue to trigger action potentials in sensor neurons or sensitize neurons by increasing
transduction and excitability. Inﬂammatory mediators also act directly on peripheral
nerves to damage peripheral transmission [21]. Immune cells inﬁltrate the spinal cord
and the dorsal root ganglia to damage the central transmission and/or modulate pain
sensitivity [22]. Activated immune cells release inﬂammatory cytokines, chemokines,
and other factors that inﬂuence cognition, mood, and behaviors through immune-to-
CNS signaling [16,23]. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic dysregulation of the
immune response is involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as mood
disorders, substance abuse disorders, psychotic disorders, attention-deﬁcit disorders, and
autism spectrum disorders [24–26] (Figure 2).

Inﬂammation is invariably linked to the activation of TRP metabolism [27,28]. The
essential amino acid TRP is a precursor to serotonin, melatonin, and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+), among others. More than 95% of TRP is metabolized through the
TRP–KYN pathway, synthesizing various bioactive metabolites such as neuroprotective
antioxidants and neuroprotectants, toxic oxidants and neurotoxins, as well as immunomod-
ulators. The disturbance of KYN metabolites has been linked to immune disorders, can-
cers, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders [29]. Furthermore, TRP–KYN
metabolites are under extensive research in search of peripheral biomarkers as well as novel
drug prototypes for a wide range of diseases [30–36]. Inﬂammation activates the TRP–KYN
pathway, elevating the levels of oxidative compounds or neurotoxic ligands to receptors
of the excitatory glutamatergic nervous system, which damage the peripheral nervous
system or CNS through the broken blood–nerve or blood–brain barrier, respectively [16].
Furthermore, immunomodulators are known to trigger the shift of acute inﬂammatory
status toward tolerogenic and chronic inﬂammation, perpetuating low-grade inﬂamma-
tion [28,37]. KYN is synthesized from TRP by the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO)
in the liver and the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDOs) in the brain and the immune
system, which are induced by cortisol, and interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α, respectively [38]. Anthranilic acid (AA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK),
or kynurenic acid (KYNA) are produced from KYN by the kynureninase (KYNU), the
KYN-3-monooxygenase (KMO), or the kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), respectively.
The KATs also convert 3-HK to xanthurenic acid (XA). XA converts into cinnabarinic acid
by autoxidation. AA and 3-HK convert into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) and then
into picolinic acid and quinolinic acid (QA). QA converts into NADH, which is a feedback
inhibitor of TDO [31] (Figure 3). Generally, 3-HK and QA are described as neurotoxic,
while KYNA is considered to be neuroprotective. The 3-HK/KYNA ratio is often applied
as an indicator of neurotoxicity. However, emerging evidence suggests that some metabo-
lites of the TRP–KYN pathway possess Janus-face properties, depending on the dose or
the situation. For example, KYNA is excitatory in lower concentrations but inhibitory in
higher concentrations at α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)
receptors. 3-HK is known to be an oxidant but observed to be an antioxidant in certain
conditions [27,39].

The stress hormone cortisol, the strong immune activator lipopolysaccharide, proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines, positive feedback loops, diminished levels of antioxidant system
enzyme superoxide dismutase, and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines all lead to the potentiation
of the TRP–KYN pathway [28]. Furthermore, the action of the KYN enzymes and metabo-
lites are complicated by the interactions with adjacent biosystems such as the oxidative
stress complex, the antioxidant enzyme systems, the serotonin neurotransmission, the
glutamate neurotransmission, the tetrahydrobiopterin pathway, the cannabinoid system,
and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling [28,39].

3. Transduction and Nociceptive Pain

The transduction of the pain sensation takes place when noxious stimuli depolarize
the afferent terminal of nociceptive myelinated A-beta (Aß) and A-delta (Aδ) ﬁbers and
unmyelinated C ﬁbers through the terminal membrane proteins and voltage-gated ion
channels converting them into electric signals in the neurons (Figure 1a).

Nociceptive pain is the most common pain that originates from a tissue injury or
inﬂammation in which the nociceptor of peripheral sensory nerves detects noxious or
potentially harmful stimuli [40]. In chronic pain, the peripheral nociceptors continue to
transmit painful stimuli even after the original injury has healed [41]. Osteoarthritis is
a classical nociceptive pain condition when abnormal loading of a damaged joint opens
mechanogated ion channels on nociceptive nerve endings [42]. Overextending or tearing a
ligament sensitizes nociceptors, which causes acute nociceptive pain, such as in the case of
an ankle sprain. In addition to mechanical irritation or physical injury, the primary cells
of the epidermis, keratinocytes, induce pain by releasing endogenous mediators, such as
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), Interleukin (IL)-1 beta (β), prostaglandin E2, endothelin, and
nerve growth factor. However, keratinocytes act in a dual matter in pain sensation: They
release β–endorphin that help pleasurable feeling during modest sun-bathing but activate

transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) and release
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, eliciting the pain sensation of a sunburn [43,44] (Figure 2a

Inﬂammation also activates nociceptors in the nerve endings. Inﬂammatory mediators
bind to their receptors on nociceptive sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system,
resulting in pain [20]. Pro-inﬂammatory factors including TNF-γ and IL-1β secreted by
monocytes and macrophages at the site of a peripheral injury facilitate pain transduction
and conduction by modifying ion channels including transient receptor potential cation
channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), transient receptor potential cation channel sub-
family V member 1 (TRPV1), and Nav1.7–1.9. However, those cells secret anti-inﬂammatory
factors such as IL-10 and/or pro-resolution mediators, including resolvins, protectins, and
maresins, to reduce nociception in the resolution phase of acute inﬂammation. Different
phenotypes of macrophages, such as pro-inﬂammatory M1 and anti-inﬂammatory M2,
contribute to the induction and resolution of pain, respectively [45]. Schwann cells of the
peripheral nervous system also secret TNF-γ and IL-1β to sensitize nociceptors at axons
in neuronal injury. Activated Schwann cells secrete matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9 that
help open the blood–nerve barrier, resulting in the recruitment of immune cells that release
inﬂammatory cytokines [22,46]. Furthermore, nociceptive afferent sensory neurons directly
modulate inﬂammation by releasing inﬂammatory mediators, such as substance P, calci-
tonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A, and endothelin-3. The process is called
neurogenic inﬂammation (Figure 2d).

The disturbance of TRP metabolism is observed in neurogenic inﬂammation. The
increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol and inﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN-α,
IFN-γ, and TNF-α activate the TRP–KYN pathway producing higher levels of oxidant
KYN metabolites which leak into the peripheral nervous system through the damaged gap
junction following the immune reaction. The oxidative KYN metabolites 3-HK, 3-HA, and
QA are harmful compounds to nerve endings of the afferent sensory neurons (Figure 3).

4. Conduction, Transmission, and Neuropathic Pain

In conduction, the electrical signals are conducted from the peripheral neurons to
the central neurons where a network of interneurons facilitates or inhibits transmission
to the second-order neurons in the dorsal horn [47]. The presynaptic terminals of C ﬁbers
release glutamate, substance P, and CGRP, which activate postsynaptic AMPA receptors,
NK1 receptors, and CGRP receptors, respectively [48] (Figure 1b). In transmission, the
activation of the postsynaptic receptors generates an action potential of the second-order
neurons and interneurons, which relay signals through the contralateral spinothalamic
tract to the thalamus; or the spinoreticular and spinomesencephalic tracts to the medulla
and brain stem; or the spinohypothalamic tract to the hypothalamus [49] (Figure 1c).

Biomedicines 2021, 9, 897

Neuropathic pain originates from lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous
system made up of peripheral and central components. Peripheral neuropathic pain is
commonly caused by diabetic neuropathy, metabolic disorders, shingles, HIV-related distal
symmetrical neuropathies, nutritional deﬁciencies, toxins such as arsenic and thallium,
a paraneoplastic manifestation of cancer, immune-mediated inﬂammatory diseases such
as Guillain-Barre syndrome, amyloidosis, Fabry’s disease, and nerve trunk injuries [50].
Presumably, burning and poorly localized pain is transmitted by C ﬁbers, while sharp and
lancinating pain is relayed by Aδ ﬁbers [51]. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common
neuropathy associated with severe pain, which presents a distal symmetrical polyneu-
ropathy with numbness and loss of sensation in the distal extremities, often accompa-
nied by peripheral vascular diseases, leading to infection and ultimately amputation [52].
Neuropathic pain is also caused by direct invasion to peripheral nerves by tumor, side
effects of chemotherapy, radiation injury, or surgery [53] (Figure 2b and Table 1). Central
neuropathic pain is a common sequela to injury to the CNS such as vascular accidents,
including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, infections, including abscess, encephalitis,
and myelitis, demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, tumors, and brain or
spinal cord [54–56] (Figure 2b and Table 1). Mixed pain is a term never formally deﬁned,
but it indicates pain caused by a combination of nociceptive and neuropathic mechanisms
observed in patients who suffer from osteoarthritis, sciatica, and cancer.

Neuropathic pain is often manifested as a part of the symptoms of psychological
disorders. The lifetime and current prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with
chronic peripheral pain were 39% and 20%, respectively [57]. Diseases that cause neuro-
pathic pain include diabetes, herpes zoster infection, nerve compression, nerve trauma,
channelopathies, and autoimmune diseases. The most common psychiatric disorders were
generalized anxiety disorders and mood disorders [57]. Furthermore, antidepressants
showed efﬁcacy for neuropathic pain in patients with depression, suggesting neuropathic
pain and depression have a bidirectional relationship [58]. Individuals with chronic neuro-
pathic pain were associated with substance abuse or suicide ideation [59] (Figure 2b and
Table 1).

Inﬂammation plays an important role in neuropathic pain. Around afferent peripheral
nerves, monocytes and macrophages release pro-inﬂammatory factors, including TNF-γ
and IL-1β, while they secrete anti-inﬂammatory factor IL-10 and pro-resolving lipid media-
tors at the resolution of acute inﬂammation [60]. T lymphocytes (T-cells) play an important
role in neuropathic pain. T-cells secret a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-17 and accumulate
in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to release pro-analgesic leukocyte elastase, inducing
mechanical allodynia. In the resolution phase, T-cells secrete anti-inﬂammatory cytokines
IL-4 and IL-10. In response to noxious stimuli, the satellite glial cells (SGCs) are activated
and proliferated at DRG to release pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1β and a noci-
ceptive neurotransmitter ATP signaling through P2 receptors [61]. SGCs also release MMPs
that open the blood–nerve barriers, allowing entry of immune cells [62]. Bone marrow stem
cells trigger analgesic actions by secreting anti-inﬂammatory cytokine-transforming growth
factor-beta 1 by suppressing glial activation induced by nerve injury and migrating to
DRG via a (C-X-C motif) chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12 chemotactic signal after intrathecal
injection [63].

Spinal cord microglia play major roles in pathological pain. Following peripheral
injury, ATP, colony-stimulating factor 1, chemokines including (C-C motif) chemokine
ligand (CCL) 2 and fractalkine (CX3CL1), and proteases activate spinal microglia [64].
Meanwhile, the expression of the receptors for ATP and CX3CL1 increases, converging an
intracellular signaling cascade, leading to the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase, which, in turn, elevates production and release of TNF-γ, IL-1β,
IL-18, brain-derived growth factor (BDNF), and prostaglandin E2. TNF-γ and Il-1β increase
synaptic transmission and decrease inhibitory synaptic transmission of lamina II spinal
cord neurons [22]. BDNF suppressed gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory synaptic trans-

mission in projection to lamina I spinal cord neurons. Microglia release anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine IL-10 in the resolution phase of inﬂammation [65].

An astrocyte is in contact with more than one million synapses, and thus, chronic
pain in astrocyte activation is more persistent [66]. Astrocytes communicate with neurons
through gap junction mediated by connexin-43 (Cx43). Cx43 is upregulated in astrocytes
after nerve injury, serving as a paracrine modulator. The paracrine modulation results
in elevating the release of glutamate, ATP, MMP2 and chemokines, including CCL2 and
CXCL1. The chemokines function as neuromodulators that potentiate excitatory synaptic
transmission. Meanwhile, following nerve injury, spinal cord neurons upregulate CXCL13
that activates astrocytes via C-C chemokine receptor type 5 to sustain neuropathic pain [67].
The spinal cord and cortical astrocytes upregulate thrombospondin 4 that leads to new
synapsis formation and subsequent somatosensory cortical circuit rewiring, causing neuro-
pathic pain [68]. Astrocytes cause neuronal hyperexcitability resulting from disturbance
of homeostasis of extracellular potassium and glutamate. IFN-α produced by astrocytes
inhibits nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord [66].

Oligodendrocytes form myelin sheath insulating axons in the CNS [69]. Little is
known about their roles in pain. IL-33 produced from oligodendrocytes contributes to pain
sensitivity via MAP kinases and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B
cells in chronic constriction injury model of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain [70].
Diphtheria toxin ablation of oligodendrocytes leads to neuropathic pain, suggesting anal-
gesic roles of the cells. Following nerve injury, T-cells inﬁltrate the spinal cord, contributing
to the development of mechanical sensitivity. T-cells release pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
TNF-γ, they secrete anti-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in the resolution phase of
inﬂammation [71]. Following chemotherapy, intrathecal injection of cytotoxic T-cells en-
hanced neuropathic pain, while the injection of regulatory T-cells diminished neuropathic
pain [72] (Figure 2d).

The involvement of the TRP–KYN pathway was reported in inﬂammation-induced
neuropathic pain. The enzyme activities of the TRP–KYN pathway were studied in a
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated chronic constriction injury at the spinal cord and DRG lev-
els of rats. The intrathecal administration of L-KYN and the intraperitoneal injection of
L-KYN and an organic anion transport inhibitor probenecid signiﬁcantly reversed tactile
allodynia in L5-L6 spinal nerve root-ligated rats, suggesting that the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor, an organic anion transport inhibitor agonist KYNA, mediates relieving
the allodynia [73]. The increased ratio of QA/KYN and the mRNA expression of KMO,
KYNU, and 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase (HAOO) was elevated in neuronal nuclear
antigen-positive neurons of the contralateral hippocampal dentate gyrus in a neuropathic
mouse model [74]. TDOIDO1 and 2, KMO, KYNU, and HAOO were found to be derived
from cerebral microglial cells, and mRNA expression of IDO2, KMO, and HAOO were
upregulated at the spinal cord after one week. Microglia inhibitor, minocycline, decreased
the levels of IDO2 and KMO enzymes and tactile and thermal hypersensitivity; further-
more, IDO2 inhibitor 1-methyl-d-tryptophan and KMO inhibitor UPF 648 signiﬁcantly
decreased mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity [75]. This suggests the participation of
IDO2 and KMO enzymes in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. The intracerebroventric-
ular administration of KMO inhibitor Ro 61-8048 alleviated spared nerve injury-induced
depressive-like behavior, and the intrathecal injection of Ro 61-8048 attenuated both the
depressive-like behavior and mechanical allodynia in rats [76]. The NMDA receptor seems
to play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dex-
tromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Both animal and human studies
showed that NMDA antagonist ketamine was beneﬁcial for analgesics [77] (Figure 3).

5. Modulation and Nociplastic Pain

Modulation of pain transmission occurs at all levels of the pain pathway from pe-
ripheral to the brain, as well as from upward-to-downward pain regulations, involving
both excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms that facilitate or suppress the responses of

Biomedicines 2021, 9, 897

second-order neurons, respectively [48]. Peripheral pain modulation is achieved through
local growth factor, hormonal, and peptide release, which alters signaling through neuro-
transmitter, ion, or receptor-based mechanisms. The pain modulation takes place neuronal
signaling through corticospinal, corticoperiheral, and intraspinal pathways and neuroplas-
ticity regulation [78] (Figures 1d and 4).

Nociplastic pain is deﬁned as pain that arises from altered nociception despite no
clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage causing the activation of peripheral
nociceptors or no clear evidence of diseased lesions of the somatosensory nervous system
causing the pain [79,80]. Nociplastic pain is generally chronic and widespread and is caused
by the disturbance of central pain processing mechanisms, such as elevated excitability of
ascending and descending pain facilitatory pathways and/or reduced inhibition of the
descending anti-nociceptive pathway [14,81,82] (Figure 4). The condition refers to central
sensitization in which pain is elicited by innocuous stimuli or different kinds of stimuli,
resulting in central hyperalgesia or allodynia, respectively [83]. The process involves
increased activity of the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and the prefrontal cortex, which
becomes active during acute pain sensation as well as of the brain stem nuclei, dorsolateral
frontal cortex, and parietal cortex, which do not participate during acute pain sensation [84]
(Figure 4). Fatigue, negative affect, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive dysfunction are
common accompanying ﬁndings in centralized nociplastic pain [85]. This typical pattern
of nociplastic pain is observed in ﬁbromyalgia, a medical condition of unknown cause
but known to be involved in genetic and environmental factors [86]. Temporomandibular
disorder and nonspeciﬁc back pain are also characterized by central sensitization (Figure 2c
and Table 1).

The inﬂammatory response is remarkable in nociplastic pain. The levels of proin-
ﬂammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-8 were observed to be higher, while anti-
inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1 receptor antagonist was higher and IL-4 was lower in patients
with ﬁbromyalgia. Several chemokine levels were elevated in ﬁbromyalgia patients. They
were monocyte recruiting such as protein eotaxin (CCL11), TARC (CCL17), and MDC
(CCL22) and neutrophil chemoattractant MIG (CXCL9) and I-TAC (CXCL11) [87]. Further-

more, the disruption of the proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine network was
considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of central sensitization in ﬁbromyalgia.
Chronic inﬂammation has been considered to induce central pain in rheumatoid arthri-
tis [88]. Thus, inﬂammation certainly contributes to the development of nociplastic pain, as
in ﬁbromyalgia (Figure 2d).

The alteration of TRP metabolism has been linked to nociplastic pain such as the
temporomandibular disorders myalgia and ﬁbromyalgia. The levels of TRP were observed
to be signiﬁcantly lower in the plasma of ﬁbromyalgia patients compared to control, and
the KYN/TRP ratio was negatively correlated with anxiety levels. The plasma TRP levels
were negatively correlated with the wrist pain intensity, whereas the KYN/TRP ratio was
positively correlated with the average and wrist pain intensity in temporomandibular
disorders [89]. TRP depletion appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of ﬁbromyalgia
and temporomandibular disorders; however, little is known about the roles of NMDA
receptor agonists 3-HK and QA and NMDA receptor antagonist KYNA. Furthermore, the
direct link between KYNs and nociplastic pain has not been reported (Figure 3).

6. Cortical Perception and Psychogenic Pain

The perception of pain is processed in the brain and the spinal cord. The thalamus,
sensorimotor cortex, insular cortex, and anterior cingulate decode signals of unpleasant
sensation carried through ascending spinothalamic tract, whereas the amygdala and hy-
pothalamus decode signals of urgency and intensity brought through ascending the spinob-
ulbar tract. The third-order neurons transfer signals and communicate with the cortex
centers. Overall, the integration of sensations, emotions, and cognition in the brain lead to
the perception of pain [90] (Figure 1e). Psychogenic pain is pain without relevant anatomic
tissue injury or inconsistent with functional causes in distribution and is considered to be
caused by psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, and emotion [91]. Depression,
anxiety, and cognitive disturbance are common symptoms that manifest in a wide range of
diseases and comorbidity [92]. Individuals with depression and anxiety often experience
psychogenic pain all over their bodies without any relevant physical cause [93,94]. Other
psychiatric disorders frequently observed in individuals with chronic pain include sub-
stance abuse, somatoform disorder, and panic disorders [95]. Furthermore, chronic pain is
associated with the disturbance of cognitive functions such as attention, working memory,
reasoning ability, information processing, and verbal communication [96,97].

Inﬂammation is obviously involved in psychiatric disorders such as depression
and anxiety. Meta-analyses reported strong evidence of signiﬁcantly increased levels
of c-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and soluble IL-2 receptor in the serum of ma-
jor depressive disorder (MDD) patients [98–102]. A higher concentration of CCL2/MCP-1
was also reported in patients with MDD. CRP levels in blood, serum or plasma samples was
signiﬁcantly raised in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients by meta-analysis, and
IFN-γ and TNF-α levels were signiﬁcantly increased in at least two or more studies [103].
Lower levels of IL-10 and higher ratios of TNF-α/IL-10, TNF-α/IL-4, IFN-γ/IL-10, and IFN-
γ/IL-4 were observed in the serum of GAD patients, showing signiﬁcantly increased pro-
to anti-inﬂammatory cytokine ratios, which suggests a distinct cytokine imbalance [104]
(Figure 2d).

Similarly, activation of the TRP–KYN pathway has been reported in depression and
anxiety. Meta-analyses reported decreased TRP levels in plasma and decreased levels of
KYN and KYNA in MDD patients, while antidepressant-free patients showed an increased
level of QA. The postmortem brain tissues from patients with MDD showed the increased
QA immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus [105,106]. Magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy suggested a higher turnover of cells with KYN and the 3-HAA/KYN
ratio in adolescent depression. Those ﬁndings are in accordance with the activation of
the TRP-KYN pathway toward 3-HK and QA branches by pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
activating IDOs, and KMO, resulting in higher neurotoxic 3-HK and QA levels [107]. De-
creased plasma KYN levels were observed in endogenous anxiety and normalized after

Biomedicines 2021, 9, 897

treatment [108]. The alteration of the TRP-KYN pathway by stress or inﬂammation may
cause serotonin and melatonin deﬁciency, making an individual more susceptible to anxiety
(Figure 3).

7. Conclusions and Future Perspective

The pain pathway, pain mechanisms, inﬂammation, KYN metabolites and enzymes
of the TRP–KYN pathway, and diseases associated with chronic pain are overviewed in
this review article. Pain sensation can be attributed to damage and/or potential harm in
various components of the pain pathway and corresponding pain mechanisms, involving
inﬂammation and alteration of the TRP–KYN pathway [109]. Chronic inﬂammation triggers
not only nociceptive pain but induces other pain mechanisms, including psychogenic pain.
Thus, a search for unique inﬂammatory signatures and various interventional targets
in chronic inﬂammation is currently under extensive research [110–113]. Intervention
through the TRP–KYN pathway is under comprehensive research to alleviate oxidative
stress and excitotoxicity in various illnesses [114–121]. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of
motor cortex stimulation and spinal cord stimulation to alleviate chronic pain caused by
various underlying conditions is under evaluation [122,123].

Chronic pain arises through a complex pathogenic process involving more components
and developing into the pain continuum. Central sensitization, peripheral sensitization,
and somatization are pathogenic processes of pain development in the pain continuum
spanning components of the pain pathway and the pain mechanism, which is hardly under-
stood without the presence of the cortical perception (Figure 5). The nociplastic mechanism
of pain attempts to delineate pain without relevant cause or lesions of the somatosensory
nervous system, such as altered perception of nociception. Chronic pain presented in
ﬁbromyalgia syndrome, chronic back pain, and complex regional pain syndrome is best
understood in the framework of pain perception, including cognitive, emotional, and
social components. Chronic pain experienced in psychiatric conditions, in particular, is
not fully explainable in the view of the nociplastic pain mechanism. Pain sensation is
developed through complex interactions with higher cortical centers governing mood,
emotion, and cognition.
