Abstract

Aim: There is a growing appreciation that subthreshold but clinically elevated levels of

autistic traits are clinically relevant. This study examined autistic traits in Singaporean

patients with first-episode psychosis and their association with 1-year psychosis recovery.

Methods: The relationship between baseline patient characteristics, autistic traits (mea-

sured with autism screening questionnaires) and psychosis recovery outcomes at 1-year

were examined in 180 adults in the Early Intervention Psychosis Programme in Singapore.

Results: Out of 180 participants, 50 (27.8%) had clinically elevated above screening-

cut off levels of autistic traits on the self-reported 10-item Autism Spectrum Quo-

tient and 8 (4.4%) on the staff-rated Autism Spectrum Disorder in Adults Screening

Questionnaire. At baseline, those with more autistic traits were more likely to be

unemployed, economically inactive (ie, students or homemakers); and to have diagno-

ses of mood disorder with psychotic features, brief psychotic disorder or psychotic

disorder not otherwise specified as compared to schizophrenia spectrum and delu-

sional disorder diagnoses. Although most participants showed improvements in their

clinical outcomes at 1-year, those with higher autistic traits improved less in the Posi-

tive and Negative Syndrome Scale general psychopathology scale and in Global

Assessment of Functioning symptomatology.

Conclusions: Autistic traits are common in those with first-episode psychosis and

may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Validated screening tools should be

developed in this population to support earlier reporting.

Statistical analyses

The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 was

used. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors associ-

ated with higher AQ-10 scores at baseline. Multiple logistic and linear
regression models1 that were adjusted for potential confounding vari-

ables (eg, age, gender, DUP, baseline employment, diagnosis, etc.)

examined the role of autistic traits in predicting clinical change at

1-year. Partial eta squared was used as a measure of effect size. All

ENDNOTES

1 General linear modelling (GLM) was used to run the linear regression
analysis. GLM uses effect coding which is automatically generated by
the software when categorical variables are keyed in as a factor variable
in the analysis as opposed to dummy coding.

2 392 patients were screened for potential participation in the study, using
a fortnightly review of the outpatient attendance list. 306 service users
were approached based on convenience sampling. 58 declined, 64 were
deemed ineligible for the study by their primary psychiatrist or case
manager. Four participants were withdrawn as they were erroneously
recruited before their 21st birthday.
