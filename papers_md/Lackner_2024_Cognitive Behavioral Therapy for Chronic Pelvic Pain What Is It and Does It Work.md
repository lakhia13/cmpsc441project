Abstract

Purpose.—Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), which encompasses interstitial 
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome in women and men, and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain 
syndrome in men, is a common, often disabling, urological disorder that is neither well understood 
nor satisfactorily treated with medical treatments. The past 25 years have seen the development 
and validation of a number of behavioral pain treatments of which cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT) is arguably the most effective. CBT combines strategies of behavior therapy, which teaches 
patients more effective ways of behaving, and cognitive therapy, which focuses on correcting 
faulty thinking patterns. As a skills-based treatment, CBT emphasizes “unlearning” maladaptive 
behaviors and thoughts and replacing them with more adaptive ones that support symptom self-
management.

Materials and methods.—This review describes the rationale, technical procedures, and 
empirical basis of CBT.

Results.—While evidence supports CBT for treatment-refractory chronic pain disorders, there 
is limited understanding of why or how CBT might work, for whom it is most beneficial, or the 
specific UCPPS symptoms (e.g., pain, urinary symptoms) it effectively targets. This is the focus 
of the Easing Pelvic Pain Interventions Clinical Research Program (EPPIC), a landmark NIH trial 
examining the efficacy of low-intensity CBT for UCPPS. relative to a nonspecific comparator 
featuring self-care recommendations of AUA guidelines.

Conclusions.—Systematic efforts to increase both the efficiency of CBT and the way it is 
delivered (e.g., home-based treatments) are critical to scaling up CBT, optimizing its therapeutic 
potential and reducing the public health burden of UCPPS.

Introduction

Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), encompassing interstitial cystitis/ bladder 
pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in women and men, and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain 
syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men, is estimated to affect nearly 5 million Americans1, 2 3. 
The hallmark symptom of UCPPS is chronic pain in the pelvic region and/or genitalia. 
Additional urinary symptoms include urgency and/or frequency. UCPPS lacks a diagnostic 
biomarker and is neither well understood nor satisfactorily treated with conventional 
medical, dietary or rehabilitative treatments4. Economically, UCPPS exacts steep annual 
costs estimated at $881.5 million for outpatient care for females alone5–7. This figure does 
not include the cost of medications8. The associated disease burden 7, 9 leaves UCPPS 
patients10 11, providers 12, employers, and payers largely dissatisfied, seeking more effective 
treatment options.

Beyond the pelvis

Treatment is further complicated by the frequency of a specific subset of co-occurring pain 
conditions (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome). This 
clinical phenomenon, collectively referred to as Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions13 
(COPC; Figure 1), are also poorly understood and share common underlying disease 
mechanisms (e.g., altered nociceptive processing resulting in hypersensitivity to noxious 
stimuli) that result in symptoms in multiple distinct organ systems (e.g., bladder, 
abdomen, head, musculoskeletal) without corresponding evidence of physical pathology 
or somatosensory change 14. COPCs interact with UCPPS to potentiate its onset15 and 
complicate symptom presentation, quality of life, and treatment response16. UCPPS patients 
suffer considerable lifetime morbidity resulting in significant loss of work productivity and 
quality of life 17 18, 19.

The illness burden of UCPPS involves significant medical and psychiatric comorbidity 
associated with a wide range of psychosocial complications. For example, depression and 
anxiety diagnoses have been found to be 2.4–6.6 higher, respectively, in IC/BPS compared 
to healthy controls 20 21. Although less well studied, similar elevated rates of anxiety and 
depression are reported for CP/CPPS 22. Findings from the Multidisciplinary Approach to 
the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network demonstrate increased negative 
affect, higher levels of current and lifetime stress, maladaptive coping, cognitive problems 
and quality of life impairment across mental and physical health domains. The severity

of psychosocial problems increases among UCPPS patients with more severe urogenital 
symptoms as well as those with co-existing non-urogenital pain symptoms23. Seventy five 
percent of UCPPS patients report pain beyond the pelvis -- 38% of which is widespread 
-- suggesting that pelvic pain represents a local manifestation of a more widespread, 
centralized phenotype representative of COPCs 24.

The science of pelvic pain “chronification”

Notwithstanding their symptom and nosological distinctions, UCPPS and other regional 
COPCs involve a dysfunction in pain modulatory mechanisms that amplify processing or 
decrease inhibition of pain stimuli within the nervous system, particularly at the CNS 
level25. As pain persists beyond 3 months (i.e. chronic), it becomes, mechanistically, 
more strongly tied to cortical circuits (e.g., corticolimbic system26) that control pain’s 
affective-motivational system governing avoidance or escape responses to expectation of 
harm through associative learning and memory processes and the emotional unpleasantness 
of pain 27 (e.g., its suffering component or bothersomeness) than sensory-perceptual 
circuitry that encodes the intensity and spatiotemporal qualities of nociceptive signals 
from the periphery (pain sensations) 28. This neural processing shift in cortical and 
emotional circuitry is activated by higher-order cognitive factors (e.g., thoughts, attention, 
expectancies, memory, etc.) and negative emotional states (e.g., anxiety, depressed mood) 
29, potentiating a “chronified” pain experience 30 that locks patients into persistent 
pain and suffering that (1) broadens the scope and depth of illness burden (distress, 
functionable disability, etc.), (2) undermines responsiveness to conventional therapies 
with antinociceptive properties by interfering with endogenous pain control29, and (3) 
challenges patients’ ability to self-regulate the very thoughts and emotions that influence 
symptom perception (e.g., pain) 29 31. The significant prevalence of other centralized 
pain states co-aggregating with UCPPS, across genders and diagnoses, strongly suggest 
a centralized pain phenotype whose shared maintaining factors define the symptom burden 
in a substantial subset of patients refractory to conventional medical therapies. Because 
complaints are widespread and their apparent mechanisms extend beyond organ-based, 
peripheral mechanisms (e.g., pain sensitization 32), UCPPS and frequently co-morbid 
COPCs are regarded as nociplastic pain states 33 14 mechanistically dissimilar from pain 
conditions with well-defined nociceptive or neuropathic involvement and clearer etiologies.i

Beyond descriptive similarities UCPPS shares with other widespread chronic pain 
conditions, the presence of psychosocial and widespread pain comorbidities has a clear and 
negative impact on health outcomes. In a 12-month prospective longitudinal MAPP study of 
usual care patients both presence of non-pelvic symptoms and decreased physical wellbeing 
at baseline predicted poorer outcomes after controlling for initial symptom severity 34. 
Another study found reciprocal relationships between pelvic pain and negative mood, such 
that negative mood changes directly corresponded with increased symptoms two weeks later 
and vice versa 35. Interacting emotional and cognitive processes36 are critical components of 
the pathophysiology of chronic pain as demonstrated by both clinical studies and a growing 
neuroimaging literature37 37 38 that implicates cognitive control brain networks governing 

i.The nociplastic pain term is the pain phenotype previously known as centralized pain or central sensitization.

emotional and pain responses underlying UCPPS. For example, a recent prospective study 
demonstrated that increased connectivity in frontal parietal cognitive control networks 
predicted UCPPS pain reduction over three-months, supporting the important role of 
cognitive factors modulating symptoms 39.

Last, pain -- the cardinal symptom of UCPPS -- is definitionally an emotional 
(unpleasantness) and sensory (intensity) experience 40 best understood from a 
biopsychosocial perspective (Figure 2) defined by physiological (e.g., underlying disease 
processes, genetic vulnerabilities) and psychological (e.g., cognitive-affective processes 
such as attention, emotions, expectations, memory, beliefs as well as learned behaviors) 
factors that are dynamically related and played out in a social context. The social context 
-- typically involving family, friends, coworkers, providers, caretakers et al -- is where 
persistent pain problems are expressed and maintained.

The clinical advantage of maintenance vs vulnerability factors

A biobehavioral model emphasizes actionable factors (e.g., correctable skills deficits) that 
maintain symptoms as opposed to vulnerability processes that play a causal role in the 
emergence of UCPPS. To illustrate, there is evidence of a genetic predisposition to UCPPS 
in certain individuals. First-degree relatives are at increased risk 41 and twin studies have 
shown high concordance in monozygotic twins 42 43 44 with heritability approximately 40% 
45, These figures do not explain whether family aggregation is due to genetic contributions 
and/or to shared experiences such as social learning, or “learning from others”, and 
modeling46. A child may develop similar pelvic pain symptoms as his/her parent(s) because 
of a genetic carryover and/or partly because of early observation of parental sick role 
behavior (e.g., overreliance on maladaptive coping strategies), parental reinforcement of 
offspring sick role behaviors (e.g., overprotective parenting style), or transmission of verbal 
threat information (e.g. children may become fearful when they hear or read that a pain 
stimulus is dangerous or has catastrophic consequences). Nonetheless, genetic contributions 
represent an important generalized biological vulnerability to develop UCPPS rather than 
a specific clinical syndrome itself. Clinically, biological vulnerabilities do not explicitly 
inform our understanding of how best to deliver treatments or identify proactively the 
subgroups of patients for whom they are most (or least) effective.

The same limitation applies to psychological vulnerability factors that arise, for example, 
from exposure to adverse childhood experiences (e.g. sexual trauma, neglect, family 
conflict) which is not uncommon among UCPPS patients 47. Psychological vulnerability 
may increase likelihood of developing UCPPS as well as mental health (e.g., anxiety) 
and medical comorbidities (e.g., COPCs) but are stable, resistant to change, and provide 
little practical guidance for clinical decision making. In fact, attributing symptoms to a 
distal vulnerability factor like genetics or abuse may make it more difficult for patients 
and providers to understand what actionable factors currently drive symptoms long after 
symptom onset, what evidence-based behavioral treatments have analgesic properties, 
and how behavioral self-management treatments overcome the influence of vulnerability 
mechanisms or other external forces beyond one’s personal control to provide symptom 
relief.

What is CBT?

Page 5

Because the influence of psychosocial factors increase as pain persists beyond 3 months 48, 
behavioral interventions that reverse the core components that drive symptom experience 
have potential therapeutic value. The psychosocial treatment for which there is most 
empirical support for chronic pain disorders is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Current 
American Urological Association guidelines49 provide a general recommendation of 
“behavioral modification” strategies drawn from cognitive behavioral model of chronic 
disease management 50 as a first line approach “to improve symptoms and ….manage…
flares” 51.

CBT combines strategies of two skills-based treatments: (1) behavior therapy teaches 
patients more effective ways of behaving through skill- and reinforcement-based strategies 
(2) cognitive therapy focuses on correcting faulty thinking patterns (such as catastrophizing 
pain beliefs which is the tendency to focus on and magnify pain sensation and to feel 
helpless in the face of pain52). CBT rests on an empirically validated model of behavior 
change that assumes that the way individuals think about an event influences their reactions 
and thereby maintains a problem. CBT also assumes that because individuals’ response 
to pain – their behaviors (overt actions as well as covert ones like thoughts), emotions, 
physiology -- is shaped by their learning history53, these responses can be changed -- or 
unlearned -- which, leads to symptom relief and improvement in functioning. The way 
patients interpret themselves, their future and the world around them (i.e. cognitions) has 
a particularly strong impact on health outcomes (e.g., painful symptoms, compliance with 
medical regimen, physical activity) 54.

This “cognitive appraisal” model has had a major impact on our understanding of how 
people perceive pain 29 55, who transitions from acute to chronic states 56, and who suffers 
more from their impacts 57. This review focuses on CBT as it applies to UCPPS because it is 
the most studied and empirically validated psychological treatments for chronic pain. 58.ii

What does CBT involve?

CBT aims to teach patients like Sam practical skills to break this chain of thoughts and 
feelings (emotions, bodily symptoms), and replace them with more useful patterns of 
thinking. CBT’s goal is not “positive thinking” or “mind over matter” but learning how to 
become more constructive in sizing up and responding to triggers with symptom-aggravating 
potential. CBT differs from traditional “talk therapy” in several ways. Rather than focusing 
on the root causes of a problem, CBT focuses on the cognitive and behavioral patterns 
that maintain symptoms. A focus on changing their maintaining mechanisms lends itself to 

ii.This reviews focus on CBT is not to dismiss the clinical utility of alternative approaches (e.g., acceptance and commitment, 
mindfulness, exposure-based therapies) but the literature supporting their efficacy is not sufficiently developed to make evidence-
based conclusions for clinical urologists, urogynecologists and other providers 58. Williams, A. C. C., Fisher, E., Hearn, L., 
Eccleston, C.: Psychological therapies for the management of chronic pain (excluding headache) in adults. Cochrane Database 
Syst Rev, 8: Cd007407, 2020. We have chosen not to include behavioral treatments based on operant conditioning principles by 
which patients receive rewards for pain-incompatible behaviors such as physical activity as opposed to pain behaviors (moaning, 
medication, limping) 59. Gatzounis, R., Schrooten, M., Crombez, G., Vlaeyen, J.: Operant Learning Theory in Pain and Chronic 
Pain Rehabilitation. Curr Pain Headache Report, 16, 2012. These treatments have no empirical advantage over cognitive behavioral 
approaches and little, if any, analgesic properties60. Eccleston, C., Morley, S. J., Williams, A. C.: Psychological approaches to chronic 
pain management: evidence and challenges. Br J Anaesth, 111: 59, 2013.

UCPPS symptoms because their root cause is often unknown or when it is known (e.g., UTI, 
trauma) differs from actionable factors that perpetuate their severity. Another difference is 
that CBT is a learning-based treatment that teaches skills for controlling UCPPS symptoms 
much as a hypertensive patient learns behavioral strategies for lowering blood pressure (e.g., 
lowering salt intake, increasing physical activity).

CBT typically follows a standardized treatment manual and has structured or semi structured 
session content that is delivered like a course with a series of planned “lessons” for 
each session. Sessions are regularly scheduled (e.g., weekly, monthly) “classes” during 
which time a specific skill is introduced, practiced in session, and reinforced through 
regularly scheduled home practice to facilitate generalization to everyday situations much 
like an athlete learns and practices skills before game-time performance. Rather than a 
definitive set of techniques, CBT is an “umbrella” term that includes a set of strategies that 
share a common focus on “unlearning” the behaviors and thoughts that underlie symptom 
fluctuations. When combined into a cohesive treatment protocol, strategies typically proceed 
in three phases.

The first phase introduces the rationale for treatment, engages patient in treatment, 
and provides information and education about UCPPS with an introduction of the 
biopsychosocial model as an alternative to biomedical model for understanding long-term 
pelvic pain. Particular focus is on cognitive and behavioral factors that maintain symptoms 
long after pain progresses beyond an acute (0–6 month) phase when peripheral factors 
dominate.

This approach is reinforced through real-time self-monitoring. Self-monitoring involves the 
ongoing, “in the moment” record keeping of important triggers and reactions to symptoms. 
Self-monitoring is a hallmark feature of CBT and essential to its success. CBT focuses on 
what a person is doing, feeling, and thinking in a specific situation that triggers symptoms. 
This focus reflects research showing that patients exhibit different behaviors in different 
situations and that problems do not always just “happen” or “come out of the blue” but 
are subject to situational factors. This means that if the goal is to change behavior, patients 
benefit from systematically assessing the environment where – and when and how -- the 
problem behavior occurs. In CBT for UCPPS, self-monitoring involves briefly tracking 
“chains” of externals triggers like work or family strain that cue symptoms as well as 
responses such as somatic sensations such as muscle tension, urinary symptoms, negative 
emotions, and associated thoughts). Patients are taught to complete monitoring forms as 
soon as possible as a problem event occurs. Real time monitoring is important to obtain 
accurate symptom data readings rather than relying on retrospective recall (e.g., end of day 
or week) data that are vulnerable to inaccuracy or distortion that comes with passage of time. 
An example of a self-monitoring sheet shown in Figure 5.

With practice, patients learn how to become more objective observers of the often-
predictable chain of internal (e.g., thoughts, emotions) and external (foods, stressors) cues 
that drive symptom flares. Self-monitoring promotes a critical understanding of patients’ 
automatic reactions and response habits which sets the stage for more advanced symptom 
self-management skills training in CBT’s second phase. Because the very act of self-

monitoring increases awareness of the how symptoms unfold and the specific situational 
variables that influence them (reactivity)61, reactivity effects are particularly useful for 
UCPPS patients who describe “flare unpredictability” as a significant source of distress and 
life interference 62. This increased awareness can be self-reinforcing which offsets initial 
inconvenience of monitoring. This is reflected in the comments of one of our non-research 
patients after she completed her first week of monitoring.

“I definitely think tracking is very helpful! I found that I’m worrying a little bit less 
day-to-day than I was before I started tracking. Also stepping back and writing out my 
thoughts, triggers and reactions to things shows how one little worry quickly spirals out of 
control into big picture things, so I’m trying to stop the little worries sooner before things 
get out of control.”

For relaxation training, respiratory retraining is emphasized because it is an intuitive way of 
counteracting tension, easy to learn, and transferable to everyday life. Breathing retraining 
is based on the assumption that patients with stress-sensitive somatic complaints develop 
inefficient respiratory patterns (e.g., shallow chest breathing) which, if chronic, can intensify 
physiological arousal that aggravates physical sensations. Learning how to slow down 
respiration through diaphragmatic breathing dampens tension and elicits a sense of physical 
calm associated with increased parasympathetic tone. With home practice, an individual 
develops an extremely quick and portable tension-reduction strategy that they apply during 
their daily routine. A goal is for the person to use physical discomfort (pain, urgency) as 
a retrieval cue for activating a more effective coping response before tension escalates and 
aggravates UCPPS symptoms.

CBT’s second phase focuses on cognitive techniques designed to challenge and dispute 
biased thinking patterns that fuel symptoms. For many chronic pain patients, their thinking 
is characterized by a rigid “mindset” or cognitive style in the way they process information 
from their environment. They focus narrowly on potential threats (e.g., bodily harm) and 
interpret ambiguous (neutral) situations in a threatening way that overinflates the estimate 
of danger or harm of future events (thinking the worst: What if….?). When negative events 
occur, they focus on their costs or consequences without factoring in mitigating factors that 
reduce their impact (catastrophizing the meaning of a negative event and expressed as If 
only….) and help them bounce back quicker from setbacks. Because self-defeating thinking 
styles are learned (albeit incorrectly), CBT teaches patients to identify and treat biased 
thoughts as hypotheses to be tested and coaches them to generate more constructive ways 
of thinking by, for example, questioning the evidence to support or disconfirm thoughts. 
Patients learn to defuse worries about past events by learning distress tolerance skills 
that “reboots” uncomfortable internal reactions (e.g., separating the distress/discomfort a 
negative event (e.g., flare) elicits from its tolerability, gauging the usefulness of worries that 
do not generate a solution to an existing problem, “letting go” of reactions to situations over 
which s/he has no control. When individuals apply these thinking skills more objectively 
and systematically, stressors presumably evoke less intense reactions, and they can more 
effectively self-manage even more severe symptoms and optimize symptom-free periods.

Another skill CBT, flexible problem solving 63, aims to expand the range of coping skills 
for managing problems regardless of their controllability. Steps involved in flexible problem 
solving include appraising the controllability of a stressor then deploying a situationally 
appropriate coping response. For controllable stressors (e.g., a flat tire), the ideal response 
is active problem solving that aims to resolve a problem. For uncontrollable stressors (e.g., 
a loved one battling terminal cancer), the solution is emotion-focused coping responses 
that are geared toward managing the emotional unpleasantness of a stressor through 
cognitive reappraisal, enlisting support, muscle relaxation, etc. By deploying a situationally 
appropriate coping response based on an objective appraisal of stressor controllability (vs 
preference or habit), individuals learn to proactively dampen severity of stress-sensitive 
symptoms.

CBT’s second phase concludes by examining core beliefs that can aggravate symptoms. 
Core beliefs are firmly held rules or assumptions -- shaped by culture, childhood 
experiences, innate dispositions -- that inform how people see themselves and the world. 
Examples include perfectionism (e.g.: “I hate being less than the best at things”), need for 
approval (e.g.: “I must do well and get others’ approval or else am disappointed”), and 
illusion of control (e.g., “There is a solution for everything”). Whereas worries (“What 
if X ….?”, “If only Y …”) function as snapshots of how a patient sees the world at a 
given moment of time, core beliefs are the lens through which those snapshots are framed. 
When beliefs process incoming information in a biased, rigid way, they can aggravate 
stress-sensitive symptoms like pain. CBT teaches tools to identify and refute these beliefs, 
replacing them with more constructive strategies.

CBT’s third phase emphasizes relapse prevention skills for maintaining gains after 
treatment ends. This skill involves reviewing progress since starting treatment, with a focus 
on identifying the specific tools that the patient found most helpful. Patients are taught to 
identify warning signs (e.g., lack of control, work overload, conflict) and how they will deal 
with setbacks without returning to square one by treating them as learning opportunities for 
reestablishing progress made in treatment. Developing a personalized relapse management 
plan for “getting back on track” (self-monitoring, thought tracking, etc.) helps explain 
CBT’s track record of sustained treatment effects long after treatment ends 64. Specific CBT 
strategies for each phase are outlined in Table 1.

Engaging the patient

While all UCPPS patients can benefit from support and encouragement to take an active role 
in their own care, providers may find the following patient characteristics a useful guide for 
identifying those patients that may benefit from targeted behavioral pain treatments.

Persistent UCPPS symptom without adequate symptom relief beyond 3 months 
of onset

Preference for a non-drug option

Symptom onset corresponds with major life stressors (e.g., a loss, transition from 
high school to college, relationship breakup, etc.).

Patients who recognize that managing the day-to-day UCPPS symptom burden is 
beyond the scope of treatment regimen.

Symptoms is a source of distress (anxiety, depressed mood, frustration, 
helplessness, worry) but the provider should not wait for distress to escalate 
to triage patient for behavioral support at which point they become more 
challenging and intractable.

Presence of non-urogenital symptoms including widespread pain (e.g., IBS, 
chronic fatigue, low back pain) suggestive of a centralized phenotype (even when 
urogenital pain is the focus of a clinical examination).

Patients with major cognitive deficits due to brain trauma or organic pathophysiology are 
unlikely to be good candidates because they may struggle with the cognitive demands 
of a learning-based treatment like CBT at least without significant remediation. Patients 
with severe mental health symptoms may have difficulty with adherence and attendance 
until they are sufficiently stabilized and should be referred for such treatment before 
beginning a course of pain-focused CBT. CBT has a strong “intrapersonal” focus in that 
it targets patients’ thoughts and behaviors that aggravate symptoms in relative isolation of 
others in their social network (e.g. family members). Patients whose symptoms fluctuate 
with interpersonal stressors (e.g., marital discord, parental conflict) may require a more 
interpersonal focus that involves family member to optimize treatment gains. This is an 
unexplored empirical question.

Of course, one challenge is communicating a persuasive rationale that prompts patients to 
act on a referral for behavioral treatment without making them feel dismissed or frustrated. 
In our clinical and research work, we have developed a script to help physicians make a 
compelling case for why a medical doctor makes a referral to a behavioral medicine provider 
for a physical problem like chronic pelvic pain. An important part of the message is to 
validate the legitimacy of the patient’s symptoms without conveying a sense that they are

imagined or a psychiatric problem or that the provider does not care. Framing the referral 
as a normative part of managing any chronic disease is intuitive to many patients and 
critical to “taking the referral baton” that empowers them to take control over symptoms 
where medical treatments fall short. It is also helpful for patients to know that they are 
referred to learn skills not to “have their head shrunk.” By describing symptoms as part of 
a chronic pain problem, the provider is giving a specific positive diagnosis (e.g., chronic 
pelvic pain) that is far more useful than telling patients what they don’t have (e.g., evidence 
of physical pathology that explains severity of symptoms). This recommendation echoes 
research showing that patients understand the difficulty and ambiguity in treating chronic 
pain but want an explanation for their symptoms65. This can be the basis for more fully 
engaging patient in a self-management approach.

Clinical Practice Considerations

A practical consideration concerns insurance reimbursement. As empirical support for 
behavioral treatments for pain has increased 66, barriers to fiscal authorization among 
carriers has decreased and health care insurance routinely covers CBT. Further, the 
Affordable Care Act mandates that health care companies cover mental health conditions 
on par with coverage for medical or surgical procedures, removing another barrier to 
coverage. The parity law also covers non-financial treatment limits. For instance, limits 
on the number of mental health visits allowed in a year were once common. The law 
has essentially eliminated such annual limits. However, it does not prohibit the insurance 
company from implementing limits related to “medical necessity” and this is something that 
the referring physician may need to add to referral letter. Individual plans and coverage vary 
depending on carriers and the patient may need to contact their provider for more detailed 
information. As an evidence-based treatment, CBT is covered by Medicare and Medicaid. 
Information on providers who accept Medicaid and Medicare can be obtained through the 
U. S Department of Health and Human Services webpage that provides links to various 
resources and information regarding providers who accept these types of insurance.

Billing Codes for CBT and ICD-11 for chronic pelvic pain

Pertinent CPT codes for CBT include 90832: Psychotherapy, 30 minutes; 90834: 
Psychotherapy, 45 minutes; 90837, Psychotherapy, 60 minutes. Relevant ICD-10 diagnostic 
codes include Pain disorder associated with both psychological factors and a general medical 
condition (F45.42) and appropriate secondary code (e.g., N30.10 for interstitial cystitis 
(chronic) without hematuria).

The new ICD classification system (ICD-1167) was developed to standardize the collection 
and reporting of health data 65 in better harmonization with what is known about pain 
conditions like UCPPS than ICD-10. Details regarding ICD-11 are beyond the scope of 
this review but can be found elsewhere including an informative webinar developed by 
the World Health Organization and the International Association for the Study of Pain68. 
ICD-11 features a multiaxial classification system that bifurcates chronic pain into chronic 
primary pain69 (i.e. disorders for which pain is a problem in its own right as, for example, 
fibromyalgia, chronic headaches, chronic pelvic pain) as well as chronic secondary pain for

pain that is secondary to an underlying disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis) 
but whose severity is discordant with disease severity and therefore requires multimodal 
treatments that targets biobehavioral drivers of pain 70. ICD-11 emphasizes a cut off time 
of longer than three months to define chronic primary pain. Because etiology is unknown 
for many chronic pain disorders (e.g., UCPPS and co-morbid COPCs), ICD-11 adopts an 
“agnostic” 71 approach to the underlying physical pathology of persistent pain not better 
explained by another painful medical condition. For the medical provider, this means that 
the defining issue for establishing chronic primary pain is the duration of pain and its impact 
on the patient in terms of distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, frustration) and functional 
disability (interference in ADLs, role limitations).

The designation of primary and secondary pain is not mutually exclusive (i.e., they can 
coexist in the same patient). ICD-11 also includes optional descriptors that capture pain 
intensity, pain-related distress and interference, as well as factors that contribute to pain 
(e.g., psychosocial factors 72). The rationale for the new classification system is that by 
promoting the notion that chronic pain is a problem in its own right with pathological 
changes and its set of clinical and behavioral characteristics, patients and their providers will 
disband (and unhelpful) anachronistic notions that pain is either “real”, medically explained 
and physical or “not real”, inexplicable and mental in nature and move away from the search 
for an elusive biomedical explanation/”fix” towards multimodal treatments 73and clinical 
practices that are more patient-centered, efficient, and firmly grounded in contemporary 
(i.e. biopsychosocial) understanding of chronic pain conditions like UCPPS and their “most 
helpful” 72 treatments (e.g., self-management therapies).

Future Directions

Empirical support for CBT as a self-management treatment for chronic pain is based on well 
over 20 systematic reviews58. Meta-analyses generally conclude that CBT improves pain, 
wellbeing, and ability to perform daily activities when compared to usual care. Evidence 
supporting CBT vs an active control is strongest for COPCs (IBS74, headache75) that 
frequently co-occur with UCPPS. The efficacy profile of CBT is less fully developed for 
UCPPS in part because RCTs have focused on specific disorders within the syndrome. 76, 77 
To the extent that CBT relieves UCPPS symptoms, it is important to know which symptoms 
are most responsive. Pelvic pain/discomfort? Urinary frequency? Urgency? Nonurogenital 
symptoms? How do symptom changes compare to improvement in other clinically relevant 
outcomes (e.g., distress, disability, quality of life) used to gauge the efficacy profile of 
pelvic pain treatments? One may expect that psychological treatments have a stronger 
impact on psychological outcomes but in our research with other centralized pain disorders 
behavioral treatments are consistently more effective at reducing target pain complaint than 
comorbid depression or anxiety 78. It is unclear whether this pattern extends to behaviorally 
treated chronic pelvic pain patients. RCTs with UCPPS patients have not included all 
genders and have tended to focus on specific diagnoses within UCPPS complex (IC/BPS 
or CP/CPPS). There is a need for studying a “transdiagnostic” (across disorder) version 
of CBT that effectively treats all diagnoses within UCPPS complex as well as those that 
co-aggregate and influence UCPPS severity (e.g., IBS, headache, anxiety etc.). Because 
transdiagnostic interventions target shared processes underlying mechanistically related

disorders, they emphasize symptom-driving commonalties across different disorders rather 
than their relatively superficial symptomatic or diagnostic differences (pain location in 
patients with IC/BPS vs CP/CPPS). Emphasizing a common set of therapeutic procedures 
effective for a class of mechanistically similar (e.g., nociplastic) disorders (UCPPS and 
others COPCs) could improve real-world applicability of treatment protocols by reducing 
their complexity, cost, and training demands of community-based practitioners and create 
opportunities for integrated care in clinical settings where UCPPS patients are seen (primary 
care, urology clinics).

This is the focus of the Easing Pelvic Pain Interventions Clinical Research Program 
(EPPIC). EPPIC, a landmark NIH trial led by the University at Buffalo in partnership with 
the University of Michigan and UCLA, examines the efficacy of a very brief regimen of 
CBT for UCPPS and its durability 3- and 6-months post treatment79 relative to a credible 
nonspecific comparator that emphasizes AUA self-care guidelines 51 (e.g., stress, diet 
modification) and accounts for the generic effects of simply entering treatment. Additional 
aims include characterizing the operative processes, so called mediators, that drive CBT-
induced UCPPS symptom relief and pre-treatment patient variables that moderate or predict 
differential treatment response. In an era of personalized medicine80 that recognizes that 
individuals respond differently to treatments (many of which are, on average, equally 
effective), and that these differences can be studied and characterized81, research on 
treatment “moderators” is needed to inform providers, payers, and policy makers about 
treatments tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of UCPPS patients to optimize 
their efficacy profile. In this respect, lessons learned from EPPIC have implications for 
strengthening the quality of clinical trials for urological disorders beyond UCPPS and 
reducing their public health impact.

The reciprocal relationship among pelvic pain, thought, and emotion: A 
case example

CBT does not regard cognitions (thoughts) and emotions as background noise to 
presenting symptoms but interconnected (Figure 3) in a way that that fuels their severity. 
Consider Sam, a 42-year-old IC female, who is buckled in the middle seat on a cross-
country flight waiting for takeoff (Figure 4). As she raises her head from her iPad, Sam 
notices the lit seatbelt sign (situation) and immediately thinks that she will need to use 
the bathroom before the sign turns off. This thought triggers a cascade of anxious – and 
unhelpful -- worries (thought) each more catastrophic than the previous: waiting will 
trigger an unbearable flare, if not an accident, the embarrassment (emotion) that will 
ensue inf front of two strangers sitting next to her, uncertainty (thought) about whether 
she packed extra pair of underwear in her carry-on, and if not, the tortuous walk to 
baggage claim. As her mind races, anxiety (emotion) heightens as do feelings of urgency, 
bladder fullness, burning, and muscle tension (bodily symptoms). Gripping the arm rests, 
all she can think about is a desire to use the bathroom-- but she can’t and it’s eating away 
at her.

Optimizing the goals of managing persistent pelvic pain and other chronic urological 
diseases depends on patients’ ability to self-manage treatment refractory symptoms 
by learning specific skills. For guidance on practical strategies to motivate patients 
to facilitate behavior changes chronic disease management requires, please see

As you know, we are dealing with a challenging chronic pain problem. Unlike acute pain 
that is short lived, chronic pelvic pain lasts long after the body has had a chance to heal 
from physical injury caused by infection, trauma, etc. There is no simple cure or fix 
for chronic pelvic pain. This is hard to accept but I owe it to you to be straightforward 
and help map out a plan for getting better. Like other chronic conditions like high blood 
pressure or diabetes, multiple factors influence pelvic pain. Some factors I can help you 
with through medications or procedures. As effective as they are for some patients, they 
oftentimes aren’t enough for others. This is where you come in. I will need you to learn 
how to play a more active role in taking control of some aspects of pain beyond the 
reach of what I can offer. I would like you to work with specialists at the Behavioral 
Medicine Clinic who will teach you practical skills for learning how to work around pain 
to improve the quality of life, function at your best, and live more comfortably. I am not 
asking you to consult with these specialists because I think pelvic pain is “in your head” 
or that it is “not real”. I want you to follow up with them because I care for my patients. 
I want to see that you get the best care possible based on what science tells us works 
best for patients with pain problems like yours. You know yourself better than anyone. If 
you feel that you are managing things just fine, there is no reason for us to consult with 
these pain specialists. But if you find that that pelvic pain is taking a toll, please make an 
appointment to get the help you deserve.

Components of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for UCPPS

Table 1:

Phase One: Psychoeducation and Behavioral Strategies
  1. Psychoeducation (nature of UCPPS and its maintaining factors with focus on physiology, cognitions, behavior, treatment rationale, 
establish treatment goals, etc.)
  2. Establish real-time self-monitoring.
  3. Muscle relaxation (e.g., breathing retraining)
  4. Home practice assignment
Phase Two: Cognitive Strategies
  1. Worry Control
  2. Flexible problem solving
  3. Challenging underlying core beliefs (e.g., perfectionism)
  4. Home practice assignment
Phase Three: Relapse Prevention
  1. Review of progress tackling maintaining factors and planning for future.
  2. Educating about risk of relapse, highlighting patient’s specific triggers for relapse (e.g., stress, diet), and importance of detecting 
problems early on
  3. Specific plan for lapse and relapse scenarios
  4. Home practice assignments
