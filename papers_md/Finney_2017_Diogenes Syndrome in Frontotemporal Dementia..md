Abstract
Diogenes syndrome refers to the combination of extreme self-neglect and excessive collecting with clutter and squalor, which is
often present in patients with dementia. Diogenes syndrome may be particularly common in behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia (bvFTD), and the investigation of these patients may help clarify the nature of this syndrome. We describe 5 patients
with bvFTD who exhibited a decline in self-care accompanied by hoarding behaviors. These patients, and a review of the liter-
ature, suggest a combination of frontal lobe disturbances: loss of insight or self-awareness with a failure to clean up or discard, a
general compulsive drive, and an innate impulse to take environmental items. This impulse may be part of the environmental
dependency syndrome in frontal disease, with specific involvement of a right frontolimbic–striatal system. Further investigation of
the similarities and mechanisms of these symptoms in bvFTD could help in understanding Diogenes syndrome and lead to
potential treatment options.

Introduction

Definition

Diogenes syndrome refers to the unique combination of severe
self-neglect and excessive hoarding, often in the context of
dementia.1 Originally named for the Greek philosopher and
cynic who chose to live in squalor as a rejection of the outside
world,2,3 Diogenes syndrome is accompanied by a lack of con-
cern or awareness of their condition, a disheveled appearance,
disregard of house and living environment, and overt clutter
and disorganization.4 Although the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), isolates
hoarding disorder (“syllogomania”) as a distinct condition,5
DSM-5 does acknowledge a potential association between
self-neglect and hoarding behavior.6

Clinical Features

Researchers have described Diogenes syndrome, previously
referred to as “senile” or social breakdown7,8 or “senile
squalor,”4 as occurring predominantly in older adults who live
alone and who may have a detached or suspicious personality
and a cognitive decline.7 Diogenes syndrome has no clear
socioeconomic or gender difference3,9,10 and can occur in
couples as “Diogenes a` deux.”4 Because individuals with this
syndrome do not recognize their behavior as problematic,
they are unlikely to seek help unless they require immediate
medical attention or are referred by a neighbor or family
member.1,9 Hence, Diogenes syndrome is a serious condition

with reported mortality rates of 47% to 50% within 1 to
4 years of diagnosis.7-9

The existence of a primary Diogenes syndrome is probably
rare. In at least two-thirds of cases, Diogenes syndrome is
associated with a comorbid neuropsychiatric condition.3,10
Although secondary Diogenes syndrome occurs with
obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressive or bipolar disorders,
schizophrenia, personality disorders, and alcohol abuse,1-3 it is
particularly associated with dementia. One report found Dio-
genes syndrome in about 15% of older adults with dementia,11
and another describes clinical hoarding behavior, frequently
associated with self-neglect, among 23% of patients with mod-
erate or severe dementia.12 Among the dementias, Diogenes
syndrome may have a special relationship with behavioral var-
iant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD),2 where it occurs in
about 36% of patients.13 Behavioral variant frontotemporal
dementia involves medial “frontolimbic” and related areas
and commonly presents with behavioral changes.14 The

International Consensus Criteria for bvFTD include 3 of the
following: behavioral disinhibition; apathy or inertia; loss of
sympathy or empathy; early perseverative, stereotypical, or
compulsive/ritualistic behavior; hyperorality and dietary
changes; and a neuropsychological profile with deficits in
executive tasks and relative sparing of episodic memory and
visuospatial skills.15 These criteria for bvFTD encompass the
essential elements of Diogenes syndrome: compulsive-like
behaviors and the neglect of personal hygiene.14,16

Diogenes and Frontotemporal Dementia

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia may offer a unique
window into the neurobiological mechanisms for Diogenes
syndrome.3 The unique combination of behavioral symptoms
of bvFTD may predispose to a high likelihood of developing
Diogenes syndrome, suggesting that clinicians need to consider
bvFTD when this syndrome occurs in middle or late life. We
report and examine 5 patients with bvFTD and Diogenes syn-
drome, review the literature on this relationship, and discuss
the potential insights to this syndrome afforded by patients with
bvFTD. This study is part of an institutional review board
approval from the David Geffen School of Medicine at the
University of California at Los Angeles.

Case Presentation

Case 1

Initial presentation. A 48-year-old left-handed man presented
with a 3-year history of a progressive personality change. It
started with difficulty completing his work, following through
on complex activities, managing his money, and initiating and
maintaining positive productive interactions. The patient also
exhibited disinhibited behavior, saying inappropriate things
and touching others inappropriately. He became disheveled
in his personal appearance and in the upkeep of his home,
which was extremely disordered and cluttered from compulsive
hoarding. He had amassed stacks of things, such as magazines,
heaps of mail, and other items that he had previously deemed of
value (See Table 1). Every surface in his home was covered
with these items. He did not have insight into his hoarding
behavior as a problem nor did he object to being prevented
from accumulating items. He had other compulsive behaviors
and repetitive pacing back and forth, as well as dietary changes
including ice cream at breakfast and lunch, daily peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches, and meat tacos (formerly a vegetarian).

Cognitive evaluation. On examination, he sat quietly with little
spontaneous verbal or physical activity and a flat affect. He was
stimulus-bound on testing, did poorly on several frontal bed-
side tasks, but did not have utilization (tendency to use items
within grasp) or imitation (tendency to mimic another’s
actions) behaviors associated with frontal disease. He had neu-

imaging showed significant bifrontal encephalomalacia, and
positron emission tomography (PET) of the brain showed
bifrontal hypometabolism consistent with bvFTD.

Treatment, diagnosis, and outcome. His hoarding behavior did not
respond to gabapentin (300 mg twice a day), bupropion (75 mg
every day), aripiprazole (5 mg every day), lithium (300 mg
twice a day), or memantine (10 mg twice a day). The patient
eventually died, and autopsy was consistent with bvFTD with
t-immunoreactive neurons and astrocytes within frontal and
temporal neocortex. There was no identified hereditary source
for his tauopathy.

Case 2

Initial presentation. A 57-year-old right-handed man presented
with a 3-year history of progressive behavioral changes. He had
become disinhibited, saying or doing things that were inap-
propriate and demonstrating excessive familiarity with stran-
gers. Without invitation, he would walk into his coworkers’
offices and defrag their computers and walk into a neighbor’s
home and play their piano. He lost his job when he sponta-
neously blurting out that the workplace was “god-awful.” He
also had a significant decline in his hygiene, claiming that it
was not a problem. At 1 point, he was said to not have bathed
for at least 6 weeks until he was asked to do so, and his response
was that it was not necessary because he never had body odor.
He developed new and prominent hoarding behavior, collect-
ing items that he was known to value, such as dozens of coffee
grinders and Hawaiian shirts, which accumulated in his home.
Further changes included prominent compulsive behavior
along with dietary changes where he would eat the exact same
fast foods over and over again.

Cognitive evaluation and neuroimaging. On examination, he
showed no insight into his disease or behavioral changes. There
was no utilization behavior although he tended to echo the
examiner’s comments. The rest of the neurologic examination
was normal. Neuropsychological testing found executive defi-
cits and decreased memory retrieval. Magnetic resonance ima-
ging and PET imaging confirmed the presence of asymmetric
frontotemporal atrophy, severe in frontal lobes and moderate in
temporal lobes, affecting the right more than the left side.

Treatment, diagnosis, and outcome. During the course of his ill-
ness, several medications were tried with possible effects of
sertraline (150 mg every day) in decreasing his collecting beha-
vior. The patient eventually died, and his autopsy showed t-
positive Pick bodies consistent with bvFTD. There was no
evidence of a genetic form of bvFTD.

Case 3

Initial presentation. A 52-year-old right-handed man presented
with a 4-year decline in overall function and ability to under-
stand instructions at work, leading to his dismissal. He had

become disengaged and withdrawn from his usual activities
of interest. His wife complained that he was no longer affec-
tionate or concerned about her feelings and those of their chil-
dren. Further history indicated a significant decline in self-care
and hygiene involving dressing, grooming, and his environ-
ment, coupled with a paradoxical compulsion to shower. Indul-
ging a long-standing appreciation of art, he became consumed
with collecting and accumulating art and design-related items,
frequently actively searching for these items in stores. This was
coupled with the compulsion to check out every art-related
store or second-hand store in the vicinity. The patient devel-
oped other compulsive-like behaviors and became fixated on
eating only fish.

Cognitive evaluation and neuroimaging. On examination, he was
detached during the interview and denied that anything was
wrong with him. There was no utilization or imitation behavior
and the rest of his neurological examination was normal. Neu-
ropsychological testing showed executive deficits, decreased
verbal fluency and disturbed memory, but spared visuospatial
functions. Magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebral atro-
phy possibly more prominent in the frontotemporal regions,
and PET confirmed bifrontal and right orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC)-anterior temporal hypometabolism.

Diagnosis and outcome. His collecting and compulsive behaviors
subsided as the disease progressed without drug intervention.
There was no evidence of a genetic form of bvFTD, and the
family declined autopsy on his death.

Case 4

Initial presentation. A 68-year-old right-handed woman with
12 years of education presented with a 5-year history of per-
sonality changes. She appeared to lose interest in everything,
including self-care and paying her bills, and she became impul-
sive and disinhibited, at 1 point approaching overweight people
and telling them that they were fat. The patient, who had pre-
viously enjoyed dressing well, began hoarding clothes, often
compulsively going to thrifty shops to make multiple clothing
purchases that she did not need. Despite an accumulation of
clothes, the patient appeared poorly groomed and unkempt, and
her living environment was cluttered and in disarray. She had
other compulsive-like behaviors, such as going into the bath-
room and repeatedly folding and unfolding toilet paper. She
had a change in her dietary habits and would eat everything that
was put in front of her.

Cognitive evaluation and neuroimaging. On examination, the
patient was alert and cooperative. Her insight was limited
because she denied any change in her behavior or personality
when questioned. The patient had difficulty on memory and
executive tasks, and her neurological examination was remark-
able for a frontal grasp reflex, stereotypical movements, and
akathisia-like restlessness. Magnetic resonance imaging

Finney and Mendez

showed frontotemporal atrophy, and PET showed frontotem-
poral hypometabolism.

Treatment, diagnosis, and outcome. The family history was neg-
ative for a familial bvFTD, and the family declined genetic
testing. She was tried on multiple medications at different times
by multiple providers (sertraline 200 mg every day, quetiapine
25 to 50 mg every day, lorazepam 0.5 mg, divalproex 250 mg
twice a day, propranolol 10 mg twice a day, and risperidone
5 mg) without clear benefit of her compulsive-like behaviors.

Case 5

Initial presentation. A 41-year-old right-handed man had a 3-year
history of an insidiously progressive change in his personality.
He had a decline in his ability to follow-through on tasks and
activities, yet he became very disinhibited, often making
personal-referent comments to others and incessantly com-
menting and joking. His self-care declined prompting the need
for his wife to remind him to maintain his hygiene and envi-
ronment. A lover of music, he developed collecting behavior
focused on old recordings, despite the fact that he would ignore
them once collected. His wife had no trouble removing the
accumulated items before it resulted in too much clutter. Addi-
tionally, the patient compulsively watched certain television
shows, listened to specific radio programs, and became
obsessed with eating carbohydrates. In general, he lacked
insight regarding his illness and changes in behavior. The
patient’s medical history and family history were negative for
similar disease or behavioral changes.

Cognitive evaluation and neuroimaging. On examination, he con-
tinued to intrude comments and jokes. There was no utilization
or imitation behavior or frontal grasp reflex. The rest of his
examination showed executive deficits, including on neurop-
sychological testing, and a normal neurological examination.
Magnetic resonance imaging showed bifrontal and right tem-
poral volume loss, and PET had frontotemporal hypometabo-
lism greater in right OFC-anterior temporal area.

Diagnosis and treatment. Sertraline (200 mg every day) had
some effect in decreasing his compulsive-like behaviors.

Discussion and Conclusion

The spectrum of Diogenes syndrome in our bvFTD patients
included a decline in self-awareness and self-care and collect-
ing behavior leading to a tendency for clutter and a disordered
environment.14,21 Common to these patients, as well as cases in
the literature, was a lack of insight and denial that their beha-
viors were problematic. Also observed in these patients were
prominent compulsive behaviors. Distinct from hoarding syn-
drome, most patients displayed little interest in the accumu-
lated items once collected and were able to allow others to
discard them without distress. Additionally, none of our
patients experienced anxiety or discomfort associated with

hoarding or collecting or were driven by obsessions or preoc-
cupations. These observations further suggest that Diogenes
syndrome is facilitated by a pathological orientation to envi-
ronmental items of interest in frontally diseased patients.22

There may not be a pure form of Diogenes syndrome outside
of dementia, schizophrenia, OCD, and other severe psychiatric
illness. There is no consistent confirmation of Diogenes syn-
drome in otherwise normal individuals, most patients have had
dementia or psychiatric conditions, and this syndrome may be
most commonly secondary to specific symptoms of dementia.9
The specific manifestations of this syndrome in dementia, in
turn, argue for a distinct Diogenes syndrome, not explained by
the coincident occurrence of hoarding and decreased personal
hygiene, but by the interaction of these conditions along with
an orientation to environmental items.

Diogenes syndrome in bvFTD appears due to the combina-
tion of 3 frontally mediated disturbances. First, these patients
lack insight and are indifferent about maintaining their personal
appearance, hygiene, environment, and avoiding clutter.14,15
The lack of self-awareness results in a failure to discard col-
lected items once they result in clutter and disorganization.
Second, compulsive behavior is a prominent feature for
bvFTD. Their collecting behavior occurs in the presence of
additional “compulsive” behavior characteristic of bvFTD,
which are more repetitive impulsions without obsessions,
buildup of anxiety, or relief after the act.14 Third, there is an
orientation to environmental stimuli which may facilitate col-
lecting behavior.1 Many patients with frontal lobe deficits are
drawn to visual stimuli or tactile perception of objects, which
may activate prehension with grasping and groping behavior.
These responses reflect an environmental dependency, which,
in individual patients, can manifest in different ways, including
utilization behavior, imitation behavior, echolalia, touching–
handling, and reading outloud.23 The environmental depen-
dency spectrum may extend to collecting behavior, hoarding,
and even pathological stealing or borrowing.24,25

Previous neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated
abnormalities in the frontal lobe in association with decrease
self-awareness and personal hygiene, compulsions, and the
release of a need to accumulate objects. Neuroimaging studies
of patients with bvFTD have shown that collecting behavior
may be related to frontal hypoactivity26; frontolimbic–striatal
limbic hypometabolism27; and abnormal activity in the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC),26 its supervisory attentional system,20
and adjacent insula.26 Other reports have also associated col-
lecting or borrowing behavior with lesions in the right ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex, right OFC, ACC, and adjacent white
matter.28,25 These specific frontolimbic regions may be impor-
tant in regulating neurophysiological functions that, when
deranged, may present with compulsive collecting behaviors.29
Additionally, similar to OCD, some patients exhibit altered
frontolimbic–striatal connectivity,30 and bvFTD patients with
specific gray matter loss in the basal ganglia (striatum) have
had behaviors similar to OCD, including hoarding.31 Together,
our patients and this literature suggest that dysfunction of a
frontolimbic–striatal system, predominantly in the right, causes

release of an internal drive to collect external items.32 This
drive may have an evolutionary origin in a subcortical or meso-
limbic mechanism for stockpiling or accumulating perceived
important resources in case of scarcity.28

Understanding Diogenes syndrome in bvFTD could lead to
strategies for treatment and intervention. Many drugs were
tried on the patients reported here, but only high-dose selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline,
seemed to have some improvement in reducing hoarding. Nev-
ertheless, the effects of SSRIs were mixed in our patients.
Others have reported benefit from other SSRIs and a combina-
tion of valpromide and quetiapine in treating patients with
bvFTD and secondary Diogenes syndrome.17 In other patients
with this syndrome, previous studies show some improvement
from the tricyclic clomipramine, paroxetine, and risperidone in
some individuals.2,3 Ultimately, providing individuals with a
structured environment, with decluttering and cleaning, along
with behavioral distraction and similar techniques, may be
more effective than medications.21

In conclusion, Diogenes syndrome may result from the com-
bination of frontal lobe deficits resulting in decreased concern
for personal care and decluttering their environment, compul-
sive behavior, and disinhibition of responsiveness to environ-
mental items of interest. Moreover, patients with disease
affecting a right frontolimbic–striatal system may be unable
to inhibit a drive for collecting. Further research into this last
frontal mechanism may help clarify collecting behavior and
suggest treatment options for patients with dementia and others
with Diogenes syndrome.
