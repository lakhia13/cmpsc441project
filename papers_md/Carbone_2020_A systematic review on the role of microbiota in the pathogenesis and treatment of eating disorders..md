Abstract

Background. There is growing interest in new factors contributing to the genesis of eating
disorders (EDs). Research recently focused on the study of microbiota. Dysbiosis, associated
with a specific genetic susceptibility, may contribute to the development of anorexia nervosa
(AN), bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, and several putative mechanisms have already
been identified. Diet seems to have an impact not only on modification of the gut microbiota,
facilitating dysbiosis, but also on its recovery in patients with EDs.
Methods. This systematic review based on the PICO strategy searching into PubMed, EMBASE,
PsychINFO, and Cochrane Library examined the literature on the role of altered microbiota in
the pathogenesis and treatment of EDs.
Results. Sixteen studies were included, mostly regarding AN. Alpha diversity and short-chain
fatty acid (SCFA) levels were lower in patients with AN, and affective symptoms and ED
psychopathology seem related to changes in gut microbiota. Microbiota-derived proteins
stimulated the autoimmune system, altering neuroendocrine control of mood and satiety in
EDs. Microbial richness increased in AN after weight regain on fecal microbiota transplantation.
Conclusions. Microbiota homeostasis seems essential for a healthy communication network
between gut and brain. Dysbiosis may promote intestinal inflammation, alter gut permeability,
and trigger immune reactions in the hunger/satiety regulation center contributing to the
pathophysiological development of EDs. A restored microbial balance may be a possible
treatment target for EDs. A better and more in-depth characterization of gut microbiota and
gut–brain crosstalk is required. Future studies may deepen the therapeutic and preventive role of
microbiota in EDs.

Introduction

There is growing interest in factors contributing to the genesis of eating disorders (EDs),
supported by the great impact on patients’ quality file and burden [1]. The etiology of EDs is
multifactorial due to the presence of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors that
allow the onset and maintenance of the disorders [2].

Recently, research has focused on the microbiota [3] and its composition, with 100 trillion
microbial cells residing in different human body areas [4]. The two phyla “Bacteroidetes” and
“Firmicutes” represent about 90% of the bacterial populations identified, whereas the remaining
10% is mainly composed of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [5,6]. The phylum Firmicutes is
represented by more than 200 different genera: Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Enterococcus, Rumino-
coccus, and Clostridium. Bacteroidetes essentially consists of two predominant genera, the
Bacteroides and the Prevotella. Bifidobacterium belongs to the Actinobacteria. A preponderance
of Lactobacilli has been detected in the area of the stomach and duodenum and Streptococci at the
jejunal level, whereas the ileocolic regions show a profound heterogeneity of bacterial species,
including Lactobacilli, Escherichia coli, and other Enterobacteria, Enterococci faecalis, Bacter-
oides, Bifidobacteria, Peptococci, Petostreptococci, Ruminococci, and Clostridia [5]. The compo-
sition of microbiota is not stable during life: presents rapid changes from early childhood,
stabilizes in adulthood, and then deteriorates in old age [7,8]. Different factors contribute to
both lifetime variation and stability of the gut microbiota (i.e., age, sex, ethnicity, geographical
location, environment, climate, delivery mode, breastfeeding, weaning, body mass index (BMI),
exercise, smoking, alcohol, drugs, and diet) [9,10].

Evidence highlighted that the alteration in the normal microbial composition, called dysbio-
sis, may contribute to the development of EDs when associated with a specific genetic suscep-
tibility [11–16], and several putative mechanisms have already been identified. Furthermore,

nutritional rehabilitation represents one of the essential focuses for
EDs, and the intake of macronutrients can significantly affect the
composition of microbiota [17,18], reducing dysbiosis. To date,
therapeutic strategies that can correct the microbiota are repre-
sented by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) [19], but the use
of prebiotics and probiotics to restore microbiota alterations has
also been proposed [20,21].

A recent research and systematic review demonstrated that gut
dysbiosis may represent hallmarks in AN [22] suggesting the
potentially interesting therapeutic targets.

Nevertheless, there are no review focusing on the other ED as
bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge eating. Thus, in order to fill this gap,
we aimed to update and critically analyze the existing literature on
the possible role of altered microbiota in the etiopathogenesis and
treatment of patients with EDs.

Methods

This systematic review was done according to Participants Inter-
vention Comparator and Outcome (PICO) methodology, and
quality was measured by means of Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) [23].
Structured question: Does dysbiosis play a role in the pathophys-
iological development and outcome of EDs?

Inclusion criteria
- Participants. The review considered studies that included partic-
ipants diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN), BN, binge eating
disorder (BED), or ED not otherwise specified.

- Intervention(s). This review considered studies that evaluate qual-
itative and quantitate microbiota analysis in EDs with/without a
pathogenesis implication and studies that evaluate microbiota
dysbiosis in EDs with/without the use of probiotics/prebiotics/
microbiota transplantation.

- Comparator(s). This review considered studies that compare the
intervention in outpatients and inpatients to other ED or health
control (HC) group.

- Outcomes. This review considered studies that evaluated if dys-
biosis accounts for eating symptoms, maintenance, or treatment
of the disorders. Various instruments are likely to be used to
measure these outcomes. This review focused on those using
validated questionnaires/tools as patient-reported outcome mea-
sures, measures of mood, anxiety, and eating psychopathological
symptoms.

- Types of studies. To present a complete overview of the literature,
we included randomized and nonrandomized, qualitative, and
quantitative studies with and without comparison groups, case
reports, and observational studies with any sample size.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded in the following cases: studies on animals;
patients with EDs due to other medical conditions or induced by
substances; pregnant or postpartum women; patients with digestive
disease (i.e., inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
and coeliac disease); patients undergoing other psychiatric and/or
metabolic treatments that could modify affectivity, weight, and appe-
tite; or patients receiving nonstandard medications or any other
therapy (i.e., antibiotics or steroids). Handbooks, manuals, editorials,
letters to editor, reviews, or meta-analyses were also excluded. If
duplicated data were found, datasets with the highest number of

participants were included. Only eligible publications meeting the
inclusion criteria have been included and cited in this review.

Search strategy

Articles published up to August 1, 2020, were retrieved from
PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library, on
human data without language or time restriction, based on the
PICO strategy.

Gray literature and unpublished studies were also considered.
The following MESH search strings were used: (Microbiota OR
dysbiosis OR gut microbiota OR intestinal microbiota OR gastro-
intestinal microbiota OR microbial metabolites OR microbial pep-
tides OR microflora OR probiotics OR prebiotics OR FMT) AND
(EDs OR feeding OR anorexia OR AN OR bulimia OR BN OR
binge eating OR BED) AND (etiopathogenesis OR cause OR etiol-
ogy OR pathogenesis OR pathophysiological).

Selected articles were reviewed independently by two authors
(EAC and PDA), who screened the titles and abstracts and read the
full texts of any articles that met the eligibility criteria. In case of
any disagreement, consensus was reached through discussion. All
relevant original publications obtained from the literature search
were identified, and the full texts were retrieved and reviewed. The
reference lists were screened, and additional data were included.
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) criteria and recommendations were followed
to improve the clarity and plainness of the review process [24]. -
Figure 1 shows the research strategy.

Assessment of quality

The quality of the studies was assessed using the GRADE approach
[23]. Two reviewers (EAC and CSG) used GRADE approach to
assess the quality of evidence from five items of research limitations,
inconsistency, indirectness, inaccuracy, and publication bias.

The quality of evidence was rated as “high,” “moderate,” “low,” or
“very low” based on GRADE rating standards. “High” quality of the
evidence indicates that future research is very unlikely to change
existing evidence, “moderate” indicates that future research may
change the results, “low” level indicates that future research is likely
to change the evaluation results, having an important impact on
existing evidence, whereas “very low” indicates highly uncertainty
about the existing evidence. In this review, GRADE ratings ranged
from moderate to low or very low quality of evidence. The quality
assessment was finally reviewed and agreed by the whole review team.

Results

Our search strategy resulted in 4,369 papers. After removing dupli-
cates and irrelevant titles, only 234 articles were considered suffi-
ciently relevant to warrant abstract review. Among them, 199 were
excluded, because they were editorials, letters, reviews, systematic
reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines, expert opinions, or different
interventions, leaving 35 to be assessed for eligibility, with relevant
references within these publications also identified and reviewed.
Following the screening of literature according to inclusion and
exclusion criteria, 18 studies were excluded, because they did not
fulfill the inclusion criteria; the remaining 17 were included in the
review. Table 1 describes the characteristics of these 17 studies.

Although most of the studies used the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV [14,25,26,29,37] and DSM-5
the International Classification of Diseases
[32,34,35,40]) or

(ICD-10) [33,38], some studies did not specify according to which
criteria the diagnosis was made [27,28,30,31,36,39]. We included
seven observational studies [14,25,26,30,33,34,37], three longitudinal
studies [29,31,40], four case reports [27,28,36,39], one case series of
three cases that was also longitudinal in its design [32], and two pilot
studies [35,38]. The samples included mostly patients with a diag-
nosis of AN. Only one study evaluated BN and BED patients [30]. All
studies included a control group matched for age and gender
[14,31,33,34,40], with the exception of case studies [27,28,32] and
studies on FMT cases [36,39]. A group of overweight and/or obese
participants were collected in three studies [25,26,33]. And FMT was
analyzed in two studies that presented case reports of female patients
with chronic and severe AN [36,39].

The gut microbiota was examined from stool samples in all
included studies. Other assessments comprised SCFAs [34,35],
fecal pH [14,31], culture growth and mass spectrometry [27],
anthropometric measures, ultrasound measurement of subcutane-
ous adipose tissue thickness [29,33], caseinolytic peptidase B (ClpB)
protein concentrations [30], or fecal metabolomics [40]. Regarding
psychiatric measures, the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2), Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Montgomery–Asberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression,
Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90, Brief Symptom Inventory, and
Beck Anxiety Inventory scores were evaluated in relation to changes
in microbiota composition [29,30,33,34,39,40].

In AN, significant changes in the quality, quantity, and composi-
tion of gut microbiota were found during weight modification. Alpha
diversity was lower during the phase of weight loss [29,33,37–40],
resulting in a reduction of Firmicutes [14] and SCFAs [14,34,35] and
the increase of Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and

Methanobrevibacter smithii. A re-established Firmicutes/Bacteroides
(F/B) ratio and an increase of SCFAs levels were reported during
renourishment and weight gain [29,31,32]. Data on BN and BED are
limited but point in the direction of low alpha diversity and increase
Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae. Interestingly, elevated ClpB con-
centration produced by E. coli suggested a role in stimulation and an
autoimmune response, affecting the melanocortin system that regu-
lates feeding behavior [30]. The FMT led to an increased number of
bacterial producing SCFAs, alpha bacterial diversity, richness, and gut
microbiome evenness increased in the AN patient [36,39]. For an
overall view, see Figure 2.

Discussion

Microbiota homeostasis is essential to promote a healthy gut,
ensuring its structural [41], immune protective [42], and metabolic
functions [43–45]. The imbalance between pathogenic and symbi-
otic or commensal species, so-called dysbiosis, seems to contribute
to the development of EDs through several mechanisms [11–16]
(see Supplementary Figure 1). This systematic review analyzed the
contribution of dysbiosis to the pathophysiological development of
EDs and the restored microbial balance as a possible treatment
for EDs.

We found noteworthy evidence that quality and quantity of gut
microbiota change in different way according to phase of AN
disorder as well as indirect measures of microbiota diversity. SCFAs
levels, lower during the restriction phase, increase during renour-
ishment and weight regain. Unfortunately, only few studies had a
longitudinal design, and results of cross-sectional studies should be
read with attention, considering the absence of a control group. The
role of microbiota in the etiology of BN and BED should be better

Gut microbiota dysbiosis

in malnourished
patients with AN is
correlated with the
severity of FIDs and the
severity of
undernutrition.

Decreased alpha diversity
can have an additional
negative impact on
calorie intake in AN by
changing in nutrient
absorption.

FMT led to the

improvement of gut
barrier function. The
need for an in-depth
analysis of the donor’s
stool and correct
selection pre-FMT is
evident.

(cid:129) AN: marked dysbiosis and
lower alpha diversity.
(cid:129) AN: higher Klebsiella, and

Salmonella.

(cid:129) AN: lower Eubacterium

and Roseburia.

(cid:129) Lower Peptostreptococca-
ceae in patients with FIDs.
(cid:129) Undernutrition negatively
correlated with Verruco-
microbiaceae and Rumi-
nococcaceae, and
positively correlated with
Clostridiales order and
Eubacteriaceae families.

(cid:129) AN: significantly lower

alpha diversity.

(cid:129) Similar Zonulin in AN and

HC.

(cid:129) No significant correlations
between serum parame-
ters and alpha diversity.

(cid:129) Pre FMT: very low bacterial
alpha diversity, lack of
beneficial bacteria, and
great abundance of fungal
species.

(cid:129) After FMT: both bacterial
species richness and gut
microbiome evenness
increased. Fungal alpha
diversity decreased. Grad-
ual increase of total SCFAs
levels. Serotonin: tended
to decrease throughout
the observation period.

deepened, conducting longitudinal trials. According to a transdiag-
nostic model of EDs, it would be interesting to identify possible
markers of switch from AN to BN or BED, and vice versa, and to use
them as therapeutic targets.

Gut–brain axis

The two-way communication network between microbiota and the
Central Nervous System [19,46] is finely controlled and regulated
by neurotrophic substances (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid, mel-
atonin, serotonin, catecholamines, acetylcholine, and histamine)
synthesized by the intestinal microflora that “mimic” the endoge-
nous molecules physiologically produced by our body [47]. Several
authors have underlined the importance of the role of gut microbial
balance for metabolism and appetite regulation [11,48–50]. Dysbio-
sis alters the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis [51], the hunger/
satiety regulatory system [11,52,53], and mood [54]. Neuropeptide-
like proteins produced by altered microbiota in EDs can simulate
the endogenous appetite and satiety hormones [11,52] and cause a
cross-reaction of immunoglobulin produced in stressful conditions
(as in EDs) [55], such as autoantibodies against α-melanocyte-
stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Studies have shown that high stress
and psychopathological symptoms in patients with AN and BN are
directly related to an increase in these anti-α-MSH antibodies
[50,56,57] that act directly on the arcuate nucleus and on appetite
regulation [58] (see Supplementary Figure 2).

Anorexia nervosa

The possible role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of AN has
become a topic of recent interest [12,13], considering the close relation
with gut microbiota composition according to the dietary intake in
both the short term [59] and the long term [60]. Microbial diversity
seems to change during diet restriction and also during weight regain.

Microbial diversity during diet restriction, renourishment, and
weight regain
Significant changes in the composition of gut microbiota (in terms
of phyla quality and quantity) on the basis of caloric intake were
evaluated in patients with AN during weight loss [26,31,34,37],
renourishment [32,40], and weight gain [26]. A significant decrease
in Firmicutes levels [31,37], especially Roseburia [34], Lactobacillus,
Streptococcus [14], and Clostridium [14,37], was found in patients
with AN compared to healthy controls (HCs), independently of
subtype (restrictive or binge/purge) or any compensatory behavior
[14]. The majority of studies included in this review showed that
alpha diversity in AN patients was lower [29,33,37–40] and sug-
gested to interfere with nutrient absorption and calorie intake
[38]. In humans, a lower F/B ratio was reported in underweight
subjects compared to normal-weight subjects [61]. A diet with low
carbohydrate or low lipid intake, as with that of AN patients, can
favor an increase in Bacteroides [62], Actinobacteria, Proteobac-
teria, Enterobacteriaceae [31,34], E. coli [26,34], and M. smithii
[25]. M. smithii (methane producers) seem to increase significantly
in the intestinal epithelium of malnourished patients, providing a
more efficient and increased supply of energy and calories
[25,63,64]. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that acute malnutri-
tion is characterized by gut dysbiosis and that the malnutrition
phenotype can be transmitted via the intestinal microbiota in a
gnotobiotic mouse model [65,66]. The imbalance in excess of
commensal species in the patient’s intestine is a result of the
restriction in food intake and may also account for the maintenance

European Psychiatry

of the disorder. This microbial dysbiosis may interact with a
nutrient-deficient diet affecting energy metabolism and causing
the persistence of malnourishment. A reduction in microbial bio-
diversity also leads to an alteration of the immune system and to the
assimilation and accrual of calories from food [13,67]. On the other
hand, the systemic inflammation, as a result of the increased gut
permeability, [68] and an altered neuronal activity are reported in
various psychiatric disorders [15,69], and the same mechanism
may be proposed for AN. More recently, 11 completely new bac-
terial species [27] and 4 new microeukaryotic communities never
previously found in humans [28] were identified. Future studies
should investigate new species and their contribution to gut micro-
biota stability.

Patients’ BMI and physical activity also showed a complex
relationship with gut microbiota: patients with AN, similar to
individuals during intense physical activity [70], have shown high
levels of Coriobacteriaceae in their stool samples [33]. It has also
been hypothesized that moderate and controlled exercise can pro-
vide an improvement in gut inflammation, decrease intestinal
permeability, and positively regulate the composition of microbiota
enhancing the number of beneficial microbial species [71].

Nutritional rehabilitation represents one of the essential focuses
for EDs and has an impact on the composition of microbiota. The
intake of macronutrients, such as fatty acids, proteins, and carbo-
hydrates, especially fibers, can significantly affect the gut micro-
biota composition [17], facilitating the onset of dysbiosis [18] or
restoring it. Weight regain with unbalanced diet, as high-lipid
nutrition, in AN patients showed a reduction in Firmicutes and
an elevation of Bacteroides and Ruminococci [29,31], an increase of
mucin-degrading bacteria, and a reduction of butyrate-producing
bacteria [72]. Interestingly, the microbiota changed qualitatively
and quantitatively, and microbial richness increased after weight
regain in patients with AN [29,31,32], but in some patients the

trend of changes in alpha diversity was lower compared to HCs [40]
and gastrointestinal symptoms did not recover at the end of 3
months treatment [31]. This may be due to a diet rich in fibers and
suggests that energy derived from macronutrients is crucial for
modest alpha diversity. Another explanation may be that microbial
richness is related to colonic transit time [73]. It is well known that
patients with AN often suffer from constipation and this could
affect the measures for alpha diversity.

Short-chain fatty acids
SCFAs are fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, and propionate) produced
by the gut microbiota during the nondigestible polysaccharides
fermentation (fibers and resistant starch) [74]. The levels of SCFAs
represent the indirect measurement of the microbial composition
and are influenced by dysbiosis. SCFAs were lower in stool samples
of AN patients [14,34,35], especially in the AN-Restricter subgroup,
compared to the control group [14]. The reduction of SCFAs in
patients with AN is a consequence of the low abundance of Rose-
buria [31,34]. A significant increase in both fecal acetate and
butyrate levels during renourishment of AN patients [29] and
changed microbiota composition, especially increased Firmicutes,
after weight regain [31] were demonstrated. Bacterial species rich-
ness, gut microbiome evenness, and SCFA levels gradually
increased in severe or chronic AN patients and also after FMT
from a healthy donor. FMT resulted in an increase of specific genera
and total SCFA levels, especially butyrate-producing Roseburia, 1
year after FMT, contributing to the improvement of gut barrier
function [36,39]. A beneficial role in appetite regulation [75] as well
as the involvement of SCFAs in energy homeostasis regulation has
been suggested [76]. The importance of SCFAs on appetite and
energy metabolism suggests SCFA modulation as new nutritional
target to prevent or counteract EDs. Nevertheless, it is important to
remind that the analysis of the fecal microbiota only indirectly

reflects the upper intestinal flora and that the weight loss process
instead of production
involves consumption of metabolites
[40]. Studies demonstrated also a significant enrichment difference
in the gut microbiota composition according to the gut
section [5]. Analysis of these microbial metabolites will surely
improve the understanding of the etiology of EDs.

Bulimia nervosa

If more data are available for AN, a dramatic lack of data is evident
for BN. To date, only one study focused on microbiota changes in
BN even if it is a life-threatening condition. Appetite regulation
mechanisms seem modulated by changes in the microbiota even
during BN [49,50,77,78]. ClpB was detectable in plasma of both HC
and ED patients, but plasma levels were more elevated in the
patients’ group. ClpB produced by E. coli is capable of “mimicking”
α-MSH [79] and stimulating an autoimmune response [80]. IgG
autoantibodies against α-MSH allow internalization of
the
IgG/α-MSH immunocomplex [30]. Furthermore, this mechanism
has been highlighted in both AN and BN [81]. Therefore, a
“hunger” rather than a “satiety” effect is due to the epitope switch
of the IgG forming the immunocomplex in BN patients [82]. Bind-
ing occurs at the N-terminal in AN and at the C-terminal in BN,
and in both cases is associated with anxiety and a high EDI-2 total
score [77,82]. This cross-reactivity of α-MSH autoantibodies may
also explain the possibility of shifting from AN to BN or BED
[81,82], and vice versa, through modulation of the melanocortin
system that regulates feeding behavior. Funding new evidence on
the role of microbiota and its alteration in BN is the new challenging
to address. Future research should investigate composition in
patients with BN compared to HCs and other EDs and evaluate
change in gut microbial species in prospective studies.

Binge eating disorder

Studies regarding BED are still lacking. However, the relationship
between microbiota and BED remains in the shadows, awaiting
further research. A similar but opposite mechanism to that
already described in AN has been hypothesized due to the
cross-reactivity of IgG toward α-MSH in overweight [50,82] and
obese patients [81]. Plasma concentrations of ClpB in patients
with AN, BN, and BED were higher compared to HCs, without
any significant differences according to diagnosis, suggesting a
link between bacterial ClpB and EDs [30]. Serum concentrations
of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors seem related to
dysfunctional eating behaviors at the extremes of BMI, including
BED [83]. As noted, BED is very often associated with numerous
comorbidities, especially obesity [84], and patients with BED and
obesity exhibited an unfavorable metabolic and inflammatory
profile related to their characteristic eating behaviors [85]. It is
evident that microbiota in obesity, similar to AN, differs in
comparison to healthy, normal-weight subjects [26,33]. A diet
rich in lipids is able to raise levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria
and decrease levels of Bacteroides [86], thus leading to an
increased F/B ratio [87]. A lower alpha diversity has been dem-
onstrated in gut microbiota in both underweight and obese
patients, with a significant correlation with BDI score indicating
greater levels of depression [33]. In this light, the evidence of
dysbiosis in gut microbiota with extreme BMI could justify its
possible role in BED. In a transdiagnostic view of EDs [88], the
hypothesis of neuroinflammation and gut dysbiosis in the etiology
of EDs should be screened. Recently, a new a continuum model

was presented, suggesting that changes in proinflammatory cyto-
kines, serotonin levels, and microbiota cause shifts in EDs [89].

Therapeutic approach: FMT

FMT is a new and promising therapy, already indicated in the
treatment of diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile [90–92],
inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative rectocolitis [92], auto-
immune diseases, allergic syndromes [93], neurological syndromes
such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia, as well as
metabolic diseases (i.e., obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic
syndrome). The first FMT was performed in 2018 on a 26-year-old
patient with severe restrictive AN after 2 years of standard therapies.
Following FMT from a healthy donor, at a 36-week follow-up, the
patient had gained 6.3 kg. The authors hypothesized that the patient’s
microbiota remodeling could be due to the increased number of
bacterial elements producing SCFAs, detected in the donor sample,
in comparison with the basal
levels recorded in the recipient
[36]. More recently, another case report detailed the use of FMT
on a 37-year-old female with severe chronic AN from a 67-year-old
first-degree female relative donor [39]. Pre- and post-treatment
analyses showed changes in gut microbiota composition: alpha
bacterial diversity, richness, and gut microbiome evenness increased
in the patient; and the fungal alpha diversity decreased, persisting for
1 year. Restoration of the F/B ratio can rehabilitate homeostasis or
regulate the composition of the gut microbiota and correct abnormal
responses of the mucosal immune system to chronic gut inflamma-
tion [94]. Despite bias, the results remain encouraging and indicate
that, if replicated in a controlled trial, FMT may represent a new line
of treatment in patients with AN; perhaps its use could be studied in
other EDs. Although these results are promising, it should be taken
into account that FMT is also associated with adverse events such as
diarrhea, constipation, infections, and others not yet known.

Microbiota and outcome
Gut–brain interplay is fundamental, and numerous intestinal
microflora have an important role through the synthesis of neuro-
transmitters [47]. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting
the associations between the intestinal microbiota and depression
or anxiety disorders in humans [95,96]. In this systematic review,
few studies have cleared up the relationship between dysbiosis and
psychopathology in AN [29,30,33,34,39,40], with only one study in
BN and in BED [30].

Depression, anxiety symptoms, and ED psychopathology seem
to be related to a change in diversity of gut microbiota, especially
bacterial species producing butyrate [12,33,34,97]. In particular, a
lower bacterial diversity is associated with more severe depression
and anxiety [29,30,33,34]. Longitudinal studies on AN cohorts
suggested that weight gain during renourishment leads to the
improvement of psychological symptoms with specific changes in
microbial composition that might participate in AN pathophysiol-
ogy [29]. Serotonin secretion regulation and the role of gut micro-
biota during its synthesis in the intestine are well documented
[98,99]. It could be speculated that variableness in gut microbiota
in EDs may affect the expression of the tryptophan hydroxylase
protein or serotonin transporters and result in consequential
abnormalities in serotonergic activity and psychopathological
symptoms [97]. The altered homeostasis in gut microbiota seems
related to the altered secretion of serotonin [100] and the cross-
reactive mechanisms through the productions of autoantibodies

European Psychiatry

against neuropeptides [80]. As above mentioned, the ClpB concen-
tration in BN and BED stimulates the production of autoantibodies
against α-MSH. The different binding of ClpB has been associated
with psychological traits in BN and BED patients, especially with
more anxiety, high MADRS, and EDI-2 total score [77,82], sup-
porting a link between bacterial ClpB and ED pathophysiology
[30]. In a recent case report, serotonin levels tended to decrease
throughout after FMT [39], but mood and eating pattern of pur-
gative AN remained unmodified, despite significant improvement
in the microbiota post-FMT [39] probably due to the long duration
of illness or a short follow-up. On the other hand, patients with AN
were treated with antidepressants, which are known to induce
microbiota alterations due to their antimicrobial activity [101]
and could be responsible for contrasting results.

power to detect differences between patients and controls over the
course of renourishment. Third, interpretation of the results of the
included studies is hindered by limitations inherent in the confound-
ing variables affecting dysbiosis: self-reported information on dietary
intake, impact of starvation, short timeline of longitudinal studies,
antidepressant
treatment, and indirect analysis of microbiota
through the fecal sample. However, the strongest limitation concerns
the composition of a “normal” microbiota, which changes according
to geographical area of origin, eating habits, food choice, gender, age,
and type of birth delivery. Moreover, current scientific research
focused mainly on bacteria and less on other microbial species.
Randomized, placebo-controlled studies designed to unravel the
gut–microbiota cross-talk mechanisms are therefore needed.

Future directions

New therapeutic options in the clinical management of EDs are
currently being investigated as direct and/or adjunctive therapies
[102]. Among them, the so-called psychobiotics have been studied
more extensively. These are probiotic live organisms that, when
ingested in adequate amounts, produce a health benefit in patients
suffering from psychiatric illness [103]. Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria,
Enterococci, and yeasts are used mostly in the formulation of
probiotics [104] and are important for the production of SCFAs,
the biosynthesis of vitamins B and K, the production of neuroactive
substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, the
activation of the immune system and regulation of cytokine and
immunoglobulin release, the reinforcement of intestinal barrier
function through tight junctions, and the increase of mucin levels
[103,105]. Studies on mice [106,107] were replicated in human
volunteers [108] and demonstrated an increase in neuropsychiatric
disorders after inducing dysbiosis that subsided after oral admin-
istration of probiotics. These results provided evidence of antide-
pressant and anxiolytic effects of probiotics probably due to a
decrease in the levels of proinflammatory plasma cytokines [109].
Enterococcus and Lactobacillus seem to regulate the Enterobac-
teriaceae responsible for the production of autoantibodies against
α-MSH [80]. Probiotics such as Roseburia, a butyrate producer
[16,31], are among the proposals for future therapeutic protocols
in the management of AN.

Other studies have confirmed how these supplements have been
able to rehabilitate malnourished and hungry rodents, confirming
the usefulness of this supplement in the treatment of malnutrition
[110–112].

Strengths and limitations

This represent a comprehensive systematic review on the role of
microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment in individuals with
EDs. It is also the first to include studies on AN, BN, and BED in an
attempt to explain the possible role of dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of
these EDs. Nevertheless, some limitations should be noted. First, the
heterogeneity among the included studies may be a confounding
variable in interpreting results. Few studies have a longitudinal
design, and the majority of studies are cross-sectional observational
or case report studies that preclude conclusions about causality. We
found only two studies evaluating FMT in AN to illustrate the
therapeutic potential of this innovative treatment. Second, the study
samples were mainly made up of female participants, which limits
generalizability to males, and the variable sample size reduces the

Conclusions

Understanding the composition and functions of microbiota and
dysfunctional mechanisms could be important in preserving and
improving its balance. However, this is only the tip of an iceberg of
complex interactions between the microbiota and the host. A
healthy gut microbiota profile improves health and prevents several
disorders. The importance of the diet in regulating the physiological
balance between Firmicutes and Bacteroides is well known, show-
ing how diets rich in fibers and biotic supplements can restore the
normal commensal flora even in EDs. Sufficiently strong and solid
scientific evidence has not yet been produced, but the activity of
SCFA-producing bacteria, especially butyrate, is known to be fun-
damental in preserving the epithelial integrity of the gut. The
depletion of these bacteria and the consequent increase in the
number of mucin-degrading bacteria promote intestinal inflam-
mation, permeability of the enteric epithelium, and therefore the
passage of lipopolysaccharide and ClpB protein into the circulation.
These can trigger immune reactions in the hunger/satiety regula-
tion center by losing the ability to control food intake. The reduc-
tion of butyrate-producing bacteria and the increase of pathobiont
bacteria, such as Clostridium, are related to cross-reactive mecha-
nisms involving the HPA axis in patients with EDs, anxiety, and
depression.

This systematic review highlights the extreme and delicate
communication network between gut, endocrine system, and brain.
A better and more in-depth characterization of gut bacterial species
in the near future may provide useful indications to improve not
only the therapeutic but also the preventive approach in EDs.
Future research may be able to distinguish between changes of
intestinal microbiota that reflect weight gain versus recovery from
EDs and identify microbial biomarkers of renourishment versus
recovery from psychopathology used as therapeutic targets. In this
light, it may be possible to identify the patients who will benefit
most from these new therapies and those who may not have any
benefit at all. Just think of the latest proposed procedure, the FMT,
where a desired phenotype could induce other disorders. A new
promising therapeutic strategy may be the administration of pro-
biotics or prebiotics for restoring the gut microbiota in patients with
AN, BN, and BED. It is also increasingly evident that the gut
microbiota represents a real “organ” with specific and fundamental
functions for the protection and prevention of many disorders, as
well as playing a possible role in their pathogenesis.

Further research may investigate in-depth microbiota changes
with particular regard for BN and BED comparing to HCs. Future
studies should also disentangle if there are differences in gut
microbiota composition between obese patients after weight loss
