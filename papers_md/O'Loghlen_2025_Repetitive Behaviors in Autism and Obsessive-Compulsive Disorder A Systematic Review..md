Abstract
Purpose  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and autism are characterized by the presence of repetitive behaviors. Differ-
entiating between repetitive behaviors attributable to a diagnosis of autism, and those attributable to OCD, poses challenges 
for differential and co-occurring diagnosis. Differentiation is important to inform appropriate supports and interventions for 
phenotypically similar but functionally distinct behaviors. In this systematic review, the quantitative literature was examined 
to explore the similarities and differences in repetitive behaviors (including restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests, 
and obsessive-compulsive behaviors) in autistic individuals and those with OCD, and those with co-occurring diagnoses, in 
terms of: (1) expression, (2) content, and (3) associated factors. Methods: Thirty-one studies were identified that compared 
repetitive behaviors in autistic individuals, individuals with OCD, or individuals with both diagnoses. Results: The results 
suggest considerable overlap in the intensity and content of repetitive behaviors between groups. The findings of this review 
highlight that research aimed specifically at understanding similarities and differences in repetitive behaviors between autis-
tic individuals and individuals with OCD is limited and frequently only compare at total score or composite measure lev-
els. Conclusion: Further research into differences in the presentation of repetitive behaviors at a subscale and item level is 
required to inform clearer differentiation of specific behaviors in autism versus OCD. Understanding and more accurately 
differentiating is essential for efficient diagnosis, effective treatment, and better outcomes.

Introduction

Autism  and  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  diag-
nostic criteria each include forms of restricted or repetitive 
behavior (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022). 
For  autistic  individuals,  this  includes  stereotyped  move-
ments,  ritualized  patterns  of  verbal/nonverbal  behavior, 
and restricted interests. For people with OCD, this includes 
compulsions  related  to  cleaning,  checking,  ordering,  or 
arranging (APA, 2022). These repetitive behaviors (hence-
forth used to include restricted and repetitive behaviors and 
interests [RRBIs] and obsessive-compulsive behaviors) can

appear  similar,  e.g.,  repeated  recital  of  verbal  information 
such  as  a  movie  script  in  autism  or  repetitive  chanting  in 
OCD. Autism frequently co-occurs with psychiatric condi-
tions  including  OCD  (> 17.4%;  van  Steensel  et  al.,  2011) 
and  autism  diagnoses  are  often  un/under-detected  in  indi-
viduals with OCD, even for those receiving clinical support 
(e.g.,  Wikramanayake  et  al.,  2018).  Considering  the  high 
rates of co-occurrence and phenotypical similarities, clini-
cians  likely  encounter  presentations  of  repetitive  behavior 
that  do  not  clearly  correspond  to  one  diagnosis  over  the 
other.

Two  review  papers  have  begun  to  explore  differences 
in  repetitive  behavior  in  autism  and  OCD.  In  a  narrative 
review,  Paula-Pérez  (2013)  posited  that  the  emotional 
valence  attached  to  engagement  in  repetitive  behaviors 
was a key feature to inform differential diagnosis, based on 
the  ego-syntonic  (i.e.,  expressions  harmonious  with  self-
concept and goals, without sparking heightened anguish or 
self-recrimination) experience of RRBIs for autistic people 
versus the ego-dystonic (i.e., expressions inconsistent with

self-concept and goals and accompanied by an increase in 
anguish or self-recrimination) experience of compulsions in 
people with OCD. Dystonic experiences were also described 
by the sensation that the content of the thought or behavior 
was foreign, and out of the control of the person experienc-
ing it, which aligns with experiences of engaging in com-
pulsive behavior reported by individuals with OCD (Keyes 
et al., 2018). This review highlights potential internal differ-
ences between repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism 
versus OCD, noting emotional valence differences, despite 
similar observable behaviors.

In a comparative review, Jiujias et al. (2017) posited that 
repetitive behaviors could be differentiated between autistic 
individuals and individuals with OCD based on differences 
in  associations  with  anxiety,  executive  functioning  (EF), 
and sensory processing. They hypothesized that while anxi-
ety has a bidirectional role in OCD (i.e., obsessions produce 
anxiety and compulsions alleviate anxiety), the directional-
ity of the relationship between anxiety and RRBIs in autism 
is unclear (i.e., does anxiety perpetuate RRBIs, or do RRBIs 
relieve  anxiety?  ).  They  also  found  different  relationships 
between  EF  and  repetitive  behaviors  between  conditions. 
Poor inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to control and man-
age thoughts and impulses) was associated with repetitive 
behaviors in OCD, and difficulties with set-shifting (i.e., the 
ability to shift attention between one task and another) were 
associated with repetitive behaviors in autism. Finally, they 
acknowledged differences in sensory processing as contrib-
uting  to  repetitive  behaviors  in  both  conditions  based  on 
emerging  literature  showing  associations  between  sensory 
integration  difficulties,  obsessions,  and  an  increased  need 
for  control.  This  review  highlights  important  distinctions 
and potential overlaps between RRBIs and obsessive-com-
pulsive  behaviors,  including  shared  associations  with  sen-
sory processing, which is widely acknowledged in autism, 
but less commonly recognized in OCD.

While these reviews provide an important starting point, 
the absence of a systematic approach to either review limits 
the degree to which these interpretations can be considered 
representative of the extant literature, which is essential for 
informing  clearer  parameters  for  differential  diagnosis,  as 
well  as  meaningful  directions  for  future  research.  Further, 
the most recent review (Jiujias et al., 2017) was published in 
2017, since which time many more studies have been pub-
lished  (e.g.,  Dingemans  et  al.,  2022;  Kushki  et  al.,  2019). 
Thus,  the  aim  of  this  systematic  review  is  to  examine  the 
similarities and differences in repetitive behaviors in autis-
tic  individuals  and  individuals  with  OCD  in  terms  of:  (1) 
expression,  (2)  content,  and  (3)  associated  factors  (e.g., 
anxiety).

Method

This review was conducted following the Preferred Report-
ing  for  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA)  statement  (Page  et  al.,  2021)  with  quantitative 
components informed by Pickering and Byrne (2014). The 
review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (Registration No. 
CRD42022351325)  with  a  minor  variation  (12/07/2023) 
added that eligible studies needed to include both a quan-
titative  measure  of  repetitive  behavior  and  a  comparison 
between diagnostic groups, leading to the exclusion of stud-
ies which did not report an explicit comparison (e.g., Zandt 
et al., 2009).

Search Strategy

Search terms were grouped by target population (i.e., autism 
and  OCD)  and  behavior  of  interest  (i.e.,  RRBIs  and  com-
pulsive  behaviors)  (see Appendix A).  Electronic  database 
searches were conducted in five databases: Science Direct, 
PsycINFO,  Web  of  Science,  Scopus,  and  CINAHL.  All 
searches were performed by the first author (JO). The initial 
search was executed on 18 August 2022. An updated search 
was executed on 30 June 2023.

Review Criteria

Participants

Eligible  sample  participants  were  individuals  of  any  age 
with a diagnosis of autism and/or a diagnosis of OCD, and 
pattern(s)  of  restricted  and  repetitive  behaviors  and  inter-
ests, and/or compulsive behaviors.

Comparator

Studies  were  required  to  include  at  least  two  groups  that 
could comprise autism-only compared to OCD-only, OCD-
only compared to autism + OCD, or autism-only compared 
to autism + OCD, and include a measure of repetitive behav-
iors.  Studies  with  three  or  more  groups  (i.e.  autism-only, 
OCD-only, and autism + OCD) were also included.

Eligibility Criteria

Quantitative  studies  of  all  designs  were  considered.  This 
included  non-randomized  studies  of  interventions  and 
randomized  control  trials.  For  intervention  studies,  only 
measures of repetitive behavior collected at baseline were 
included, because the interventions implemented may have 
influenced group differences. Inclusion criteria were studies

were also excluded. In the absence of a comparable previ-
ous systematic review, no date restrictions were placed on 
the searches.

Study Selection and Coding

The screening process comprised: (1) removal of duplicates; 
(2) title and abstract screening; and (3) full text screening and 
data charting (Fig. 1). Covidence was used to manage the 
screening  process.  Database  searches  (August  2022;  June 
2023)  yielded  16,736  papers,  including  6307  duplicates. 
Following  de-duplication,  the  remaining  10,429  papers 
were screened by title and abstract by the first author. A sec-
ond reviewer screened 20% of titles and abstracts (n = 2086) 
against  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  Papers  were 
sorted into exclusions, inclusions, or assigned for full text 
review  if  unclear  based  on  the  title/abstract.  Initial  agree-
ment between reviewers was substantial (Cohen’s κ = 0.85), 
with 100% agreement following discussion. A total of 194 
papers  were  then  reviewed  in  full  text.  These  remaining 
papers were reviewed by the first author, with 20% checked 
by a second reviewer (n = 39). There was 100% agreement 
on papers meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This 
review resulted in 31 papers deemed eligible for inclusion, 
and data from these was extracted using a template in Covi-
dence. A  sample  of  20%  were  also  extracted  by  a  second 
independent  reviewer  and  checked  to  confirm  reliability, 
with 100% agreement on the extracted data.

that: (1) included participants of any age with a diagnosis 
of autism, (2) included a comparison group of any age with 
a  diagnosis  of  OCD  (including  co-occurring  autism  and 
OCD), (3) included a quantitative measure of RRBIs, and/
or compulsive behaviors, and/or OCD symptomology, and 
a  comparison  of  this  measure  between  diagnostic  groups 
(i.e.,  between  autistic  individuals  and  individuals  with 
OCD,  or  either  group  and  a  comparison  group  with  both 
conditions), (4) were peer-reviewed, (5) were full-text, and 
(6)  were  written  in  English.  Diagnosis  of  autism  included 
Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD,  e.g.,  DSM-5-TR; APA, 
2022), and earlier diagnoses made using previous diagnos-
tic criteria (e.g., DSM-IV; APA, 1994) or other diagnostic 
systems (e.g., ICD-10; WHO, 2004) including Autistic Dis-
order, Asperger’s Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental 
Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified. Diagnoses included in 
earlier  classifications  of  Pervasive  Developmental  Disor-
ders (i.e., Rett Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disor-
der; APA, 1994), but not included under the current autism 
classification (APA, 2022), were excluded.

Papers  including  participants  with  other  additional  co-
occurring  conditions  were  also  considered  for  inclusion, 
given  the  high  rates  of  co-occurring  conditions  observed 
in autistic individuals (APA, 2022). Exclusion criteria were 
studies  that  involved:  (1)  non-human  research  (e.g.,  mice 
models),  (2)  participants  without  diagnoses  (e.g.,  traits 
only),  (3)  a  single  clinical  population  only  (i.e.,  with  no 
comparison clinical group), (4) an autism or OCD popula-
tion  not  separately  reported  in  a  study  evaluating  a  range 
of diagnoses, and/or (4) those that did not include a quan-
titative measure of repetitive behaviors. Qualitative studies

Data Extraction

Data  extracted  from  each  full  text  record  included  title, 
author(s), year of publication, country of origin, objective(s), 
design  and  methodology,  community  involvement  in  the 
research (i.e., input from autistic individuals or individuals 
with OCD), participant demographics (age, gender, ethnic-
ity, IQ/cognitive ability, and communication/language abil-
ity),  diagnostic  characteristics  (including  diagnostic  tool/
method  used  to  ascertain  autism  and/or  OCD  diagnosis), 
presence of other co-occurring conditions (e.g., anxiety dis-
orders), inclusion/exclusion criteria, method(s) of data col-
lection, RRBIs/obsessive-compulsive behavior(s) measured 
(including measure), level of measurement (total score only, 
subscale  scores,  or  item-level  analyses),  presence/level  of 
repetitive  behaviors  by  group  (mean,  standard  deviation), 
reported  experience  of  repetitive  behaviors  (if  reported), 
content/focus of repetitive behaviors (e.g., special interests), 
covariates  assessed  (e.g.,  anxiety),  functional  assessment/
motivation behind repetitive behaviors (if reported), statisti-
cal analyses used, statistical results of group comparisons, 
correlations/interactions with covariates, and key findings. 
Where  possible,  findings  based  on  specific  sub-categories 
of behavior were also extracted such as subscale scores and 
individual item scores.

Quality Assessment

Quality  assessment  was  conducted  by  the  first  author, 
with a sample of 20% conducted by a second independent 
reviewer.  The  quality  of  included  studies  was  appraised 
using published guidelines by Hawker et al. (2002). These 
guidelines were selected due to their suitability for assessing 
methodological rigor across studies using different research 
designs.  The  methodological  rigor  of  each  aspect  of  the 
study  (e.g.,  theoretical  framework,  sampling,  approach  to 
and  explanation  of  data  analysis)  and  the  generalizability 
and  implications  of  the  findings  is  ranked  from  (1)  Very 
Poor to (4) Good, based on established individual criteria, 
and these scores are summed to indicate the quality of each 
study (i.e., overall scores of < 10 = Very Poor to 40 = Very 
Good; Hawker et al., 2002). Initially, there was 89% agree-
ment  between  reviewers.  Following  discussion  of  seven 
discrepancies,  100%  agreement  was  achieved.  Resolution 
of these discrepancies did not impact on the final rating of 
any study. A web-based AMSTAR 2 (A [revised] MeaSure-
ment Tool to Assess systematic Reviews; Shea et al., 2017) 
checklist was also used to assess the quality and reliability 
of the systematic review as a whole.

Data Synthesis

Data  were  synthesized  through  quantitative  and  narrative 
synthesis. To address the review questions, data pertaining 
to specific sub-categories of behavior were critically com-
pared.  Categories  of  behavior  were  determined  based  on 
the  measure  used  to  assess  repetitive  behaviors  across  the 
included studies. For example, for studies including a sub-
scale analysis of RRBIs using the Repetitive Behavior Scale 
–  Revised  (RBS-R;  Bodfish  et  al.,  2000),  these  sub-cate-
gories were differentiated as: (1) stereotyped behavior, (2) 
self-injurious behavior, (3) compulsive behavior, (4) routine 
behavior, (5) sameness behavior, and (6) restricted behavior. 
Sub-categorization of OCD behaviors was made in line with 
recognized OCD symptom dimensions, for example, based 
on the Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist (i.e., cleaning/washing, 
checking,  repeating,  counting,  ordering/arranging,  hoard-
ing, and miscellaneous compulsions; Storch et al., 2010).

Results

Overview of Included Studies

A total of 31 studies were included from the United King-
dom (n = 5; 16%), the Netherlands (n = 4; 13%), the United 
States  (n = 4;  13%),  Japan  (n = 3;  10%),  Italy  (n = 2;  6%), 
Australia  (n = 2;  6%),  Canada  (n = 2;  6%),  Norway  (n = 1; 
3%), Sweden (n = 1; 3%), and France (n = 1; 3%). Six studies 
(19%) were conducted across multiple countries including 
data from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, 
and Sweden. Most employed a cross-sectional (n = 9; 29%) 
or case control (n = 9; 29%) design. Appendix B outlines the 
key characteristics of each included study.

Demographic  data  for  the  total  sample  are  provided  in 
Table  1.  In  the  31  included  studies,  1123  autistic  partici-
pants,  982  participants  with  OCD,  and  262  participants 
with both conditions (i.e., autism and OCD) were included. 
Only  four  studies  reported  participants’  ethnicity  (Akker-
mans  et  al.,  2019;  Hollestein  et  al.,  2021;  Lewin  et  al., 
2011;  Pertusa  et  al.,  2012).  Of  the  253  participants  repre-
sented across these four studies, 231 (91.3%) were White. 
Only two studies (6.3%) included participants with a below 
average  intelligence  or  intellectual  impairment,  with  most 
studies  (n = 23;  74%)  excluding  participants  on  the  basis 
of  below  average  intelligence,  co-occurring  intellectual  or 
developmental conditions, or language impairment. Sixteen 
studies (52%) examined repetitive behaviors in children or 
adolescents and fourteen studies (45%) examined repetitive 
behaviors in adults. One study (3%) included both adoles-
cent and adult participants.

Quality of Included Studies

The quality of most included studies (n = 29; 94%) ranged 
between good and very good, except for two studies which 
were  rated  as  fair-poor  (n = 1;  3%)  and  poor-very  poor 
(n = 1;  3%)  (for  full  scoring  see Appendix  C).  No  studies 
reported explicit input from autistic individuals or individu-
als with OCD.

Quality of the Systematic Review

A high level of confidence in the results of this review was 
indicated based on a critical appraisal via AMSTAR 2, sug-
gesting  that  the  current  review  provides  an  accurate  and 
comprehensive summary of the results of the available stud-
ies that address the question of interest (Shea et al., 2017; 
Appendix D).

reported on the intensity or severity of repetitive behavioral 
presentations  (e.g.,  Y-BOCS)  whereas  others  reported  on 
the  frequency  or  breadth  of  repetitive  behaviors  endorsed 
(e.g., RBS-R and Repetitive Behavior Questionnaire [RBQ; 
Turner,  1995]).  Thus,  expression  of  repetitive  behaviors 
in the following analyses encompasses both the frequency 
and/or intensity of repetitive behavioral presentations.

Expression of RRBIs

Relatively consistent findings were observed when compar-
ing  autism-related  RRBIs  between  groups.  The  majority 
of studies (91% of studies making this comparison) found 
no significant differences in the overall intensity of RRBIs 
between  autistic  individuals,  individuals  with  OCD,  and 
individuals  with  both  conditions  (Akkermans  et  al.,  2019; 
Cadman  et  al.,  2015;  DiCriscio  et  al.,  2016;  Gooskens  et 
al., 2019, 2021; Hollestein et al., 2021; Jacobs et al., 2021; 
Lamothe  et  al.,  2022;  Naaijen  et  al.,  2017;  Zandt  et  al., 
2007). In contrast, a single study (Sturm et al., 2018) found 
autistic children to have more intense levels of RRBIs com-
pared  to  children  with  OCD.  However,  these  differences

may be related to the measure used, with differences in the 
endorsement  of  RRBIs  only  found  when  using  the  Social 
Responsiveness Scale (SRS; restricted interests and repeti-
tive  behavior  subscale;  Constantino  &  Gruber,  2012)  in 
this study, but not the RBS-R or RBQ in other studies (e.g., 
Akkermans et al., 2019). Three studies also compared inten-
sity  of  compulsive  behaviors  as  a  sub-construct  of  RRBIs 
between autistic children and children with OCD. Two stud-
ies  found  that  children  with  OCD  reported  significantly 
greater compulsivity (Gooskens et al., 2019, 2021), whereas 
another  study  found  that  autistic  children  reported  signifi-
cantly greater compulsivity (Naaijen et al., 2017).

Expression of Compulsions

When comparing individuals with a single diagnosis, find-
ings in relation to OCD-related compulsions were relatively 
consistent.  Six  studies  (86%  of  studies  making  this  com-
parison)  reported  individuals  with  OCD  had  significantly 
greater total obsessive-compulsive symptom severity com-
pared to autistic individuals (Bejerot et al., 2014; DiCriscio 
et al., 2016; Kushki et al., 2019; Russell et al., 2005; Ruta 
et al., 2010; Zandt et al., 2007; also Niemeyer et al., 2022 
though  significance  was  not  reported).  Three  studies  also 
reported  that  children  with  OCD  had  significantly  greater 
compulsive  symptom  severity  at  the  subscale  level,  than 
autistic children (DiCriscio et al., 2016; Kushki et al., 2019; 
Zandt  et  al.,  2007).  Significantly  greater  total  obsessive-
compulsive  symptom  severity  in  individuals  with  OCD 
was reported using a variety of different measures includ-
ing the Brief Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (BOCS; Bejerot 
et al., 2014), Toronto Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (TOCS; 
Park et al., 2016) (Kushki et al., 2019), and CY-BOCS/Y-
BOCS (DiCriscio et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2005; Ruta et 
al., 2010; Zandt et al., 2007). Exceptions were Dingemans 
et  al.  (2022)  who  reported  no  significant  differences  in 
obsessive-compulsive  symptom  severity  between  autistic 
individuals and individuals with OCD via the Padua Inven-
tory  –  Revised  (Sanavio,  1988),  Mack  et  al.,  (2010)  who 
reported no significant differences in impairment associated 
with  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  between  children 
with OCD and autistic children with co-occurring OCD via 
the  Children’s  Obsessive  Compulsive  Inventory  (ChOCI; 
Shafran et al., 2003).

The majority of studies (67% of studies making this com-
parison) comparing individuals with OCD with individuals 
with  both  conditions  found  no  significant  differences  in 
total  obsessive-compulsive  symptom  severity  (Griffiths  et 
al., 2017; Lewin et al., 2011; Mack et al., 2010; Mito et al., 
2014; Murray et al., 2015; Nakagawa et al., 2019; Tsuchi-
yagaito  et  al.,  2017;  Wikramanayake  et  al.,  2018).  Stud-
ies that did report differences between these groups found 

that individuals with both conditions reported significantly 
greater symptom severity than autistic individuals (Helver-
schou  et  al.,  2009;  Lamothe  et  al.,  2022;  Niemeyer  et  al., 
2022), except for Cath et al. (2008) who found that adults 
with  OCD  reported  significantly  greater  total  symptom 
severity (but not compulsive symptom severity at the sub-
scale  level)  compared  to  autistic  adults  with  co-occurring 
OCD.

Content of Repetitive Behaviors across Groups

Content of RRBIs

Studies  examining  differences  in  the  content  of  autism-
related RRBIs were limited, with mixed results. Hollestein 
et al. (2021) found no significant differences in the intensity 
of stereotypy, compulsivity, ritualistic behaviors, or limited 
interests between children with OCD and autistic children. 
However, in the same study, autistic children reported sig-
nificantly  greater  insistence  on  sameness  behaviors  com-
pared to children with OCD at the first time point. One year 
later, children with OCD reported significantly more insis-
tence  on  sameness  behaviors  than  autistic  children.  Simi-
larly, Zandt et al. (2007) found that children with OCD were 
rated similarly to autistic children in their intensity of most 
types  of  RRBIs  (repetitive  language,  stereotyped  move-
ment,  self-injury,  manipulation  of  objects,  sameness  envi-
ronment,  attachment  to  objects,  limited  interests),  except 
for routines and rituals, where children with OCD reported 
greater intensity of routine and ritual behaviors.

In  adults,  only  one  study  examined  RRBIs  between 
groups at the symptom level. Fusar-Poli et al. (2020) exam-
ined  the  presence  of  RRBIs  via  two  individual  items  on 
the Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  in Adults  Screening  Ques-
tionnaire (ASDASQ; Nylander & Gillberg, 2001) between 
autistic adults and adults with OCD. Autistic adults reported 
more  ritualized,  routine-  and  rule-oriented  behaviors,  and 
special interests than adults with OCD.

Content of Compulsions

Mixed  findings  in  relation  to  the  content  of  compulsive 
behaviors  were  found,  with  most  studies  comparing  the 
content  of  compulsions  via  the  Children’s  Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS; Goodman et al., 
1991) or Y-BOCS. The frequency of counting compulsions 
endorsed  by  autistic  individuals,  individuals  with  OCD, 
and individuals with both conditions was generally similar 
(Griffiths et al., 2017; Lewin et al., 2011; Mack et al., 2010; 
Mito  et  al.,  2014;  Nakagawa  et  al.,  2019;  Russell  et  al., 
2005; Wikramanayake et al., 2018). Two exceptions found 
conflicting results. McDougle et al. (1995) found that adults 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 3with OCD endorsed more counting compulsions than autis-
tic adults, whereas Zandt et al. (2007) found that counting 
compulsions were highly endorsed by autistic children and 
not at all by children with OCD. The frequency of repeating 
compulsions  endorsed  was  also  generally  similar  between 
groups (Griffiths et al., 2017; Mack et al., 2010; McDougle 
et al., 1995; Mito et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2019; Ruta 
et al., 2010; Wikramanayake et al., 2018), with some excep-
tions  reporting  more  frequent  endorsement  of  repeating 
compulsions by individuals with OCD compared to autistic 
individuals (Russell et al., 2005; Zandt et al., 2007) or indi-
viduals with both conditions (Lewin et al., 2011).

More  variable  findings  were  found  for  checking  and 
hoarding compulsions. A number of studies reported greater 
frequencies  of  checking  compulsions  by  individuals  with 
OCD compared to autistic individuals (Bejerot et al., 2014; 
McDougle  et  al.,  1995;  Russell  et  al.,  2005;  Ruta  et  al., 
2010; Zandt et al., 2007) or individuals with both conditions 
(Lewin  et  al.,  2011),  although  others  found  no  significant 
differences between groups (Griffiths et al., 2017; Mack et 
al., 2010; Mito et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2019; Wikra-
manayake  et  al.,  2018).  In  support  of  the  former,  others 
reported more severe checking compulsions by individuals 
with OCD (Cadman et al., 2015) or both conditions (Cad-
man  et  al.,  2015;  Helverschou  et  al.,  2009)  compared  to 
autistic individuals via the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory 
– Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al., 2002) and Psychopathology 
in Autism Checklist (Helverschou et al., 2009) respectively. 
In contrast, Dingemans et al. (2022) found no differences in 
the  severity  of  counting  compulsions  between  groups  via 
the Padua Inventory – Revised. The use of different assess-
ment measures may have contributed to differences in these 
findings.

Several  studies  also  found  that  hoarding  compulsions 
were  endorsed  in  similar  frequencies  between  groups 
(Griffiths et al., 2017; Lewin et al., 2011; Mack et al., 2010; 
Russell et al., 2005; Ruta et al., 2010; Wikramanayake et al., 
2018; Zandt et al., 2007). However, some variable findings 
were  reported  amongst  adults.  Several  studies  found  that 
hoarding  compulsions  were  more  frequently  endorsed  by 
(McDougle et al., 1995) or more intense in (Cadman et al., 
2015; Pertusa et al., 2012) autistic adults compared to adults 
with  OCD.  Others  found  that  hoarding  compulsions  were 
more frequently endorsed by (Mito et al., 2014; Nakagawa 
et al., 2019) or severe in (Cadman et al., 2015) adults with 
both conditions compared to adults with OCD only.

In many studies, the intensity (Cadman  et  al.,  2015) or 
frequency (Griffiths et al., 2017; Lewin et al., 2011; Mack 
et al., 2010; Mito et al., 2014; Russell et al., 2005; Ruta et 
al., 2010; Wikramanayake et al., 2018; Zandt et al., 2007) 
of  ordering/arranging  compulsions  was  similar  between 
groups.  In  others,  adults  with  OCD  more  frequently 

2313

endorsed  ordering/arranging  compulsions  compared  to 
autistic  adults  (Bejerot  et  al.,  2014).  In  further  contrast, 
others found that autistic adults (McDougle et al., 1995) or 
adults  with  both  conditions  (Nakagawa  et  al.,  2019  [post-
treatment])  endorsed  significantly  more  ordering/arrang-
ing  compulsions  than  adults  with  OCD  only.  Differences 
between these studies’ methodology that may explain con-
trasts in results including the use of different standardized 
measures (e.g., BOCS; Bejerot et al., 2014), the inclusion of 
autistic participants with cognitive impairments (McDougle 
et al., 1995), or the effects of a therapeutic intervention (i.e., 
cognitive-behavioral therapy; Nakagawa et al., 2019).

Mixed findings were also found in relation to washing/
cleaning  compulsions.  Some  studies  reported  no  signifi-
cant differences in severity (Dingemans et al., 2022) or fre-
quency  (Griffiths  et  al.,  2017;  Mack  et  al.,  2010;  Mito  et 
al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2019; Russell et al., 2005; Ruta 
et al., 2010; Wikramanayake et al., 2018) between groups. 
In some cases, these lack of significant differences may be 
attributable  to  differences  in  sample  characteristics  across 
studies,  including  the  absence  of  formal  autism  diagnoses 
in the comparison group (Mito et al., 2014; Wikramanayake 
et  al.,  2018)  or  the  use  of  different  standardized  measures 
(i.e., Padua Inventory – Revised; Dingemans et al., 2022). 
In  contrast,  other  studies  reported  more  frequent  (Bejerot 
et al., 2014; McDougle et al., 1995; Zandt et al., 2007) or 
more intense (Cadman et al., 2015) washing/cleaning com-
pulsions by individuals with OCD or individuals with both 
conditions (Cadman et al., 2015; Helverschou et al., 2009; 
Lewin et al., 2011) compared to autistic individuals.

A limited number of studies examined differences in mis-
cellaneous compulsions (Griffiths et al., 2017; McDougle et 
al., 1995; Mito et al., 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2019; Wikra-
manayake et al., 2018; Zandt et al., 2007) and compulsions 
involving others (Griffiths et al., 2017; Mack et al., 2010; 
Ruta et al., 2010; Zandt et al., 2007), each finding no sig-
nificant  differences  in  the  frequency  of  these  compulsions 
endorsed  between  groups.  Magical/superstitious  compul-
sions were only compared in children. Two studies reported 
more  frequent  endorsement  of  magical/superstitious  com-
pulsions amongst children with OCD compared to autistic 
children (Zandt et al., 2007) and children with both condi-
tions (Mack et al., 2010). Griffiths et al. (2017) reported no 
significant  differences  between  autistic  children  and  chil-
dren with both conditions.

Only  two  adult  studies  examined  differences  in  self-
injurious  behaviors,  with  mixed  findings.  McDougle  et 
al.  (1995)  found  that  autistic  adults  reported  more  fre-
quent ‘self-damaging’ compulsions than adults with OCD, 
and  Helverschou  et  al.  (2009)  found  that  adults  with  both 
conditions  endorsed  more  severe  self-injurious  behaviors 
compared  to  autistic  adults.  However,  differences  in  the 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 32314

measures  used  to  assess  self-injurious  behavior  (Y-BOCS 
versus Psychopathology in Autism Checklist, respectively), 
or the presence of an intellectual impairment in Helverschou 
et al. (2009)’s sample, may have contributed to the differ-
ences in these findings. Taken together, while some consis-
tent patterns emerged in relation to the content of repetitive 
behaviors, there were exceptions in relation to the frequency 
and severity of some types of compulsions between groups.

Factors Associated with Repetitive Behaviors Across Groups

A number of studies investigated correlates or predictors of 
repetitive  behavior,  including  associations  with  neurologi-
cal factors, aspects of EF, social and communication factors, 
psychological or experiential factors, and age.

Neurological Factors

Several  studies  highlighted  associations  between  neuro-
logical  factors  and  repetitive  behavior.  Seven  child  stud-
ies  incorporated  a  brain  imaging  component  (Akkermans 
et al., 2019; Gooskens et al., 2019, 2021; Hollestein et al., 
2021;  Jacobs  et  al.,  2021;  Kushki  et  al.,  2019;  Naaijen  et 
al., 2017), with only three reporting differences in repetitive 
behavior based on neurological markers. Two studies asso-
ciated  the  intensity  of  repetitive  behaviors  with  decreased 
glutamate  concentration  in  autistic  children,  or  increased 
glutamate  concentration  in  autistic  children  and  children 
with  OCD  (Hollestein  et  al.,  2021;  Naaijen  et  al.,  2017, 
respectively). Akkermans et al. (2019) implicated increased 
functional  connectivity  in  some  brain  areas  with  greater 
intensity of repetitive behaviors in autistic children and chil-
dren  with  OCD,  though  between-group  comparisons  were 
not  reported.  Further,  Hollestein  et  al.  (2021)  associated 
increased  striatal  activity  (i.e.,  cognitive  demand)  during 
failed inhibitory control to greater compulsivity in children 
with OCD, suggesting an association between compulsivity 
and difficulties in inhibition in OCD. In contrast, Naaijen et 
al. (2017) found no differences in striatal activity between 
autistic  children  and  children  with  OCD,  despite  signifi-
cantly greater compulsivity amongst autistic children.

Executive Functioning

Several  aspects  of  executive  functioning  (EF)  were  also 
related  to  the  intensity  of  repetitive  behaviors.  Four  stud-
ies  incorporating  a  brain-imaging  component  examined 
differences in behavior between children with OCD versus 
autism  (Gooskens  et  al.,  2019,  2021),  or  between  empiri-
cally derived transdiagnostic subgroups (Jacobs et al., 2021; 
Kushki  et  al.,  2019).  Due  to  the  nature  of  their  approach, 
Jacobs et al. (2021) and Kushki et al. (2019) did not report 

autism-  and  OCD-specific  group  comparisons.  Gooskens 
et  al.  (2019)  and  Gooskens  et  al.  (2021)  found  no  asso-
ciations between repetitive behavior and cognitive control 
assessed via a modified stop-signal task. In contrast, in an 
eye-tracking  study,  DiCriscio  et  al.  (2016)  reported  a  sig-
nificant association between antisaccade errors and RRBIs 
(via the ADOS) in a group of autistic children, and in con-
trast  no  relationship  between  cognitive  control  of  visual 
attention and the intensity of compulsions in children with 
OCD). This suggests a link between autism-specific repeti-
tive behavior and cognitive control of visual attention.

Via a network analysis, Dingemans et al. (2022) posited 
difficulties  relating  to  cognitive  flexibility  (i.e.,  problems 
with set-shifting and attention switching, and rigid cognitive 
style)  as  central  and  potentially  perpetuating  factors  asso-
ciated  with  manifestations  of  repetitive  behavior  in  adults 
with a range of disorders (including autism and OCD). Also 
using a mixed sample of adults with a range of psychiatric 
conditions including autism and OCD, Bejerot et al. (2014) 
reported that greater obsessive-compulsive symptom sever-
ity  was  associated  with  poorer  global  functioning,  though 
in both cases between-group differences were not reported. 
As  well,  in  a  sample  of  adults  with  OCD  and  adults  with 
co-occurring conditions, Mito et al. (2014) found the over-
all obsessive-compulsive symptom severity was positively 
correlated with difficulties in attention switching, attention 
to detail, and imagination (via the AQ) in the total sample.

Social and Communication Factors

Several  studies  found  that  social  and  communication  fac-
tors contributed to manifestations of repetitive behavior. In 
every case, these factors were compared using the Autism 
Spectrum  Quotient  (AQ;  Baron-Cohen  et  al.,  2001).  In 
addition to cognitive inflexibility, Dingemans et al. (2022) 
posited difficulties related to components of social behavior 
(social  communication,  perception  of  social  cues)  as  cen-
tral, perpetuating factors associated with repetitive behavior 
in  autistic  adults  and  adults  with  OCD.  Cath  et  al.  (2008) 
reported  that  obsessive-compulsive  symptom  severity  was 
significantly  associated  with  social  difficulties  in  autistic 
adults and adults with OCD. Pertusa et al. (2012) found that 
hoarding  behaviors  (difficulties  discarding,  and  excessive 
acquisition) were positively correlated with communication 
difficulties amongst autistic adults, but not adults with OCD.

Psychological/Experiential Factors

Three studies reported on psychological or experiential fac-
tors  associated  with  repetitive  behavior,  generally  finding 
no  differences  in  metacognitive  beliefs  about,  or  control 
associated  with,  engaging  in  repetitive  behaviors  between 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 3autistic  adults  and  adults  with  OCD.  Cath  et  al.  (2008) 
examined ego-dystonia associated with repetitive behaviors 
between adults with OCD and adults with both conditions, 
finding  no  significant  differences  in  the  degree  to  which 
repetitive behaviors were experienced as excessive, unrea-
sonable, strange, abnormal, or inappropriate, or the extent 
to  which  the  person  felt  the  need  to  exhibit  control  over 
their thoughts or actions. Melchior et al. (2021) examined 
beliefs  about  the  necessity  of  performing  ritual  behaviors, 
via the Beliefs About Rituals Inventory (BARI; McNicol & 
Wells, 2012), also finding no significant differences between 
autistic  adults  and  adults  with  OCD.  Comparatively,  Ruta 
et  al.  (2010)  examined  insight  (i.e.,  individuals’  degree  of 
awareness  into  the  senselessness/excessiveness  of  beliefs 
related to repetitive behaviors) via a single CY-BOCS item. 
While neither the autistic or OCD groups displayed excel-
lent  insight  into  their  repetitive  behaviors,  and  ratings  of 
good,  fair,  and  poor  insight  were  similar  between  groups, 
autistic  individuals  displayed  significantly  higher  rates  of 
absent insight, which was attributed to potential differences 
in perceiving, processing, and describing repetitive behav-
iors, which may indicate group differences in the experience 
of these behaviors.

Age

One  study  posited  differences  in  repetitive  behavior  in 
children with OCD as a product of age. Zandt et al. (2007) 
found sameness behavior to be significantly more prevalent 
in  younger  children  with  OCD. Age  was  not  significantly 
related  to  endorsement  of  sameness  behaviors,  repetitive 
motor behaviors, or compulsions in autistic children.

Discussion

We systematically examined similarities and differences in 
repetitive behavior between autistic individuals and individ-
uals with OCD, finding considerable overlap in the expres-
sion  and  content  of  repetitive  behaviors  using  a  range  of 
measures.  There  were  generally  no  significant  differences 
between  groups  in  the  overall  endorsement  of  autism-
related  RRBIs  for  adults,  although  some  exceptions  were 
noted when comparing groups of children. In a single study, 
Sturm et al. (2018) found that autistic children reported sig-
nificantly greater endorsement of RRBIs compared to chil-
dren with OCD via the SRS. This is perhaps unsurprising as 
the SRS is an autism measure and thus may be more sensi-
tive to the identification of autism-specific behaviors rather 
than more general presentations of repetitive behavior such 
as those observed in OCD. Further discrepancies were noted 
when compulsivity (measured in the context of RRBIs) was 

2315

compared via the RBS or the RBS-R, which seem to corre-
spond with revisions made to this measure where the revised 
form  includes  more  complex  RRBIs  such  as  ritualized 
behaviors, insistence on sameness behaviors, and restricted 
interests  (Bodfish  et  al.,  1999,  2000).  Thus,  significantly 
greater endorsement of RRBIs by children with OCD when 
assessed via the RBS-R rather than the RBS may be a result 
of more complex forms of repetitive behaviors now being 
captured and may indicate differences in the complexity of 
repetitive behaviors endorsed by children with OCD com-
pared to autistic children of a similar age.

The presence of an OCD diagnosis was generally asso-
ciated  with  significantly  higher  obsessive-compulsive 
symptom severity than in autism only. Studies which found 
non-significant  effects  predominantly  compared  behav-
iors  between  individuals  with  OCD  and  those  with  both 
conditions,  suggesting  similar  symptom  severity  irrespec-
tive of whether OCD occurs in conjunction with autism or 
alone. Only one of the thirty-one included studies reported 
no  significant  differences  in  overall  obsessive-compulsive 
symptom  severity  when  comparing  individuals  with  OCD 
to autistic individuals (Dingemans et al., 2022). However, 
this result may have been an artifact of the measure used; 
Dingemans  et  al.  (2022)  assessed  OCD  symptoms  via  the 
Padua  Inventory  –  Revised,  whereas  most  other  studies 
used the CY-BOCS/Y-BOCS. Overall, these results suggest 
that while autism and OCD populations may be differenti-
ated  in  terms  of  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  obsessive-
compulsive symptomology at a group level, they generally 
could not be differentiated based on characteristics related 
to autism with similar results at a group level.

Findings  related  to  the  content  of  repetitive  behaviors 
were mixed, particularly in relation to OCD-related compul-
sions. The  frequency  of  endorsement  of  washing/cleaning 
and ordering/arranging compulsions was mixed across stud-
ies,  indicating  that  more  research  is  needed  to  understand 
if  different  repetitive  behavioral  content  is  seen  in  each 
condition.  In  contrast,  relatively  consistent  findings  were 
reported for checking and hoarding compulsions. Generally, 
checking compulsions were more frequently and intensely 
endorsed  by  individuals  with  OCD.  This  aligns  with  pre-
vious  research  acknowledging  checking  compulsions  as 
one of the most common types of compulsions manifested 
in  OCD  (Ruscio  et  al.,  2010). The  ego-dystonic  nature  of 
these compulsions may be more characteristic of the anxi-
ety  which  underpins  OCD,  which  may  explain  why  these 
behaviors are more frequently endorsed by individuals with 
OCD than by autistic individuals (Paula-Pérez, 2013).

Autistic  adults  generally  endorsed  more  hoarding  com-
pulsions  compared  to  individuals  with  OCD.  Previous 
research  suggests  that  hoarding  behaviors  are  common 
among  autistic  individuals  (e.g.,  Storch  et  al.,  2016).  In  a 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 32316

recent qualitative study, autistic adults reported that hoard-
ing behaviors were motivated by difficulties discarding pos-
sessions,  a  need  for  emotional  aids,  and  collecting  items 
related  to  their  special  interests  (Goldfarb  et  al.,  2021). 
Thus, for autistic people, hoarding behaviors may be more 
often motivated by emotional attachment rather than a com-
pulsive need or response, differentiating them from hoard-
ing behaviors manifested in OCD. In relation to this finding, 
it is noted that recent changes to the diagnostic criteria view 
hoarding  disorder  as  separate  from  OCD  (APA,  2022). 
Regardless, hoarding behaviors were commonly included in 
measures of both autism- and OCD-related repetitive behav-
ior and were hence included in the current review. Consid-
ering recent amendments to the diagnostic classification of 
hoarding  behaviors,  more  research  examining  the  distinc-
tion between these behaviors and other types of repetitive 
behaviors is still needed.

Findings  were  mixed  in  terms  of  the  factors  associated 
with  repetitive  behaviors.  In  many  cases,  studies  reported 
on  factors  associated  with  an  autism  or  OCD  diagnosis, 
rather  than  correlates  of  repetitive  behavior  specifically. 
Further, associated factors were only reported for repetitive 
behaviors  as  a  unidimensional  phenomenon,  so  compari-
sons based on specific subtypes of repetitive behavior were 
not  possible.  In  children,  studies  highlighted  associations 
between  repetitive  behavior  and  neurological  factors  such 
as  differences  in  glutamate  concentration  or  striatal  activ-
ity. However, only two studies examined these differences 
between groups. Hollestein et al. (2021) associated increased 
striatal activity with increased compulsivity in children with 
OCD,  suggesting  a  relationship  between  increased  cogni-
tive demand and compulsive behavior in OCD. In contrast, 
Naaijen et al. (2017) found no differences in striatal activity 
between  autistic  children  and  children  with  OCD,  despite 
significantly  greater  compulsivity  amongst  autistic  chil-
dren.  Several  previous  studies  have  also  highlighted  links 
between  striatal  activity  and  repetitive  behavior,  though 
much  of  this  research  has  been  conducted  using  animal 
models (e.g., Longo et al., 2022; Muehlmann et al., 2020). 
To  better  understand  the  links  between  neurological  fac-
tors  and  manifestations  of  repetitive  behavior,  more  stud-
ies  assessing  repetitive  behaviors  as  a  multidimensional 
construct are needed. This may allow for clearer identifica-
tion  of  the  neurological  features  associated  with  different 
types of behavior. As well, longitudinal studies which track 
changes in repetitive behavior over time may be helpful for 
understanding  how  these  behaviors  change,  and  whether 
changes in repetitive behavior correspond with physiologi-
cal, neurodevelopmental, or environmental factors.

Challenges in EF were associated with greater intensity 
of repetitive behaviors in autistic children. This association 
did  not  extend  to  children  with  OCD,  suggesting  that  EF 

may  be  a  factor  related  more  closely  to  RRBIs  in  autism 
than  to  obsessive-compulsive  symptomology.  In  support, 
a  recent  meta-analysis  by  Iversen  and  Lewis  (2021)  con-
firmed  significant  associations  between  elevated  levels  of 
RRBIs  and  poorer  EF  (including  set  shifting,  inhibitory 
control,  and  parent-rated  EF)  in  autistic  children.  Based 
on  their  findings,  Iversen  and  Lewis  (2021)  surmised  that 
impairments in EF, particularly set shifting, may contribute 
to the intensity of repetitive behavioral presentations, due to 
difficulties related to control over thoughts and behaviors.

While much of the previous literature has evaluated EF 
and  RRBIs  in  younger  children,  similar  findings  relating 
impairments in EF to more intense RRBIs have also been 
found for autistic adolescents (e.g., Miller et al., 2015) and 
adults (e.g., Lopez et al., 2005). Two studies included in the 
current review (Dingemans et al., 2022; Mito et al., 2014) 
suggested an association between the intensity of repetitive 
behaviors and aspects of EF, including cognitive flexibility 
and attention switching. However, these associations related 
to individuals with a variety of obsessive-compulsive spec-
trum  disorders  (including  autism  and  OCD),  limiting  the 
degree to which these findings can be attributed to one con-
dition over the other. Further research investigating the role 
of EF on manifestations of repetitive behavior, particularly 
in  autistic  adults  and/or  adults  with  OCD  including  group 
comparisons,  is  warranted  to  understand  specific  mecha-
nisms that affect each condition and better inform support 
or treatment.

The association between social and communicative fac-
tors and repetitive behaviors was acknowledged in several 
studies involving adults. While some previous research sug-
gests  connections  between  repetitive  behaviors  and  social 
behaviors (e.g., Martínez-González et al., 2022; Rojas et al., 
2006),  others  posit  that  autism-related  social  and  commu-
nication differences are  not  associated with  corresponding 
levels of RRBIs (e.g., Mandy & Skuse, 2008). Further, stud-
ies  directly  comparing  these  differences  between  autistic 
individuals and those with OCD appear limited. Thus, more 
research  exploring  the  associations  between  social  skills 
and corresponding engagement in RRBIs may be warranted 
to understand the social mechanisms that may drive transdi-
agnostic engagement in repetitive behaviors.

Similarities related to psychological and experiential fac-
tors when engaging in repetitive behaviors were also noted 
between  autistic  individuals,  individuals  with  OCD,  and 
those with both conditions. Cath et al. (2008) reported no 
significant  differences  in  the  ego-dystonicity  of  repetitive 
behaviors,  or  perceived  control  over  repetitive  behaviors, 
between  adults  with  OCD  and  adults  with  both  OCD  and 
autism.  This  non-significant  finding  may  be  due  to  both 
groups having OCD, thus experiences associated with repet-
itive behaviors may have been associated with compulsions 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 3rather  than  with  autism-related  RRBIs.  In  contrast  to  this 
hypothesis  however,  Melchior  et  al.  (2021)  also  found  no 
group differences in beliefs about the necessity of perform-
ing ritualistic behaviors between autistic adults and adults 
with OCD. This may indicate that, irrespective of whether 
repetitive behaviors are experienced as ego-dystonic or ego-
syntonic,  autistic  individuals  and  individuals  with  OCD 
may feel equally compelled to engage in repetitive behav-
iors. The reasons underpinning this drive, however, remain 
unclear.  Differentiating  between  the  motivating  factors 
underpinning engagement in repetitive behaviors in future 
research may offer new insights into how these drivers may 
be  different  or  the  same  in  autism  versus  OCD  and  could 
inform supports or treatment.

Several  gaps  in  the  extant  literature  are  highlighted  by 
this  review.  In  comparison  to  OCD-specific  compulsive 
behaviors,  contrasts  between  groups  in  relation to  autism-
related  RRBIs  were  more  rarely  investigated  and  are 
important  to  further  explore.  Nine  of  the  included  studies 
examined  autism  characteristics  via  the AQ  or  SCQ,  nei-
ther of which includes a subscale measure of RRBIs. As a 
result, this limited the number of studies which could offer 
insights  into  the  content  of  RRBIs  and  how  these  varied 
between  groups.  As  well,  item-level  comparisons  based 
on subtypes of repetitive behavior were generally missing 
from the literature, particularly in relation to autism-specific 
RRBIs, limiting the degree to which between-group differ-
ences based on specific types of repetitive behaviors could 
be compared. Features associated with repetitive behaviors 
also  tended  not  to  be  compared  between  groups.  Instead, 
features  were  associated  with  diagnosis,  rather  than  with 
repetitive  behaviors  directly,  limiting  the  degree  to  which 
assertions about the links between these factors and repeti-
tive behaviors could be made.

A lack of sampling diversity was also noted. From the 31 
studies included in this review, it is likely that some mem-
bers  of  the  autistic  and  OCD  communities  may  be  under-
represented,  limiting  the  generalizability  of  the  results  to 
these populations. Few studies reported on ethnicity (n = 4), 
and  where  reported,  participants  were  mostly  White,  sug-
gesting that other ethnicities may not be well represented in 
the current review. Further, in the autistic and co-occurring 
condition subgroups, a large proportion of participants were 
male  (74%  and  65%,  respectively;  Table  1),  and  none  of 
the included studies examined sex or gender as a potential 
predictor of repetitive behavior. This is an important omis-
sion to note given the associations between sex and gender 
differences and different manifestations of repetitive behav-
iors often seen between autistic men and women (Bourson 
&  Prevost,  2022).  Further,  only  two  studies  included  par-
ticipants with an intellectual impairment or below average 
intelligence, despite individuals with intellectual differences 

2317

representing  as  much  as  38%  of  the  autistic  community 
(Maenner et al., 2023). Repetitive behaviors may manifest 
differently, and be motivated by different factors, amongst 
individuals  with  an  intellectual  impairment.  The  ego-dys-
tonic  versus  ego-syntonic  experience  of  these  behaviors 
may  be  less  clear  than  in  populations  without  intellectual 
or language impairment as understanding relies more heav-
ily on observable behaviors rather than reported experience. 
Underrepresentation  of  autistic  individuals  with  higher 
support  needs  remains  an  enduring  issue  in  the  scientific 
literature  and  represents  an  important  direction  for  future 
research to ensure that individuals with a variety of support 
needs are included in, and can benefit from, the findings of 
future research.

The results of this review should be interpreted with some 
limitations in mind. First, grey literature was not included, 
nor were non-English publications, the latter of which may 
have exacerbated cultural/ethnic bias. Second, while a thor-
ough  appraisal  of  the  quality  of  each  included  study  was 
undertaken,  this  review  did  not  exclude  eligible  papers 
based on quality. While care was taken to consider the qual-
ity of each study during analysis of the results, in instances 
where studies did not attain adequate quality ratings, these 
findings  must  be  interpreted  cautiously. Alongside  quality 
ratings, studies were also considered for input from autistic 
or OCD community members. Of the included studies, none 
acknowledged input from individuals with lived experience 
of repetitive behaviors in the context of autism and/or OCD, 
which  may  provide  more  subjective  insights  into  differ-
ences in behavioral experiences between diagnostic groups. 
Future  research  must  consider  how  to  better  integrate  co-
design  practices  and  involve  individuals  with  lived  expe-
rience  (in  this  case,  autistic  individuals  and/or  individuals 
with OCD) in the research process. Relatedly, while the cur-
rent review was focused on quantitative studies, qualitative 
studies may yield differing insights into subjective experi-
ences of repetitive behaviors, and their underlying motiva-
tions and outcomes, and are thus an important consideration 
in future research.

Given  the  significant  degree  of  overlap  in  repetitive 
behavioral presentations observed across diagnostic groups 
based  on  standardized  scores,  the  results  of  this  review 
emphasize  that  accurate  differential  diagnosis  cannot  be 
determined, nor accurately informed by a score above a cer-
tain threshold on one or more measures, given overlapping 
and  often  non-significant  group  findings.  Total  scores  on 
questionnaires are not sufficient to inform accurate clinical 
diagnosis  without  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  factors 
and functions driving the repetitive behavior. While a pleth-
ora  of  research  has  identified  anxiety  as  an  inherent  com-
ponent  of  obsessive-compulsive  behavioral  manifestation, 
the links between function and behavior are not clear in the 

Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2025) 55:2307–23211 32318

context of autism. Based on the findings of this review, OCD-
specific measures of repetitive behavior (e.g., the Y-BOCS) 
may be more helpful than autism-specific measures in dif-
ferentiating  between  conditions  as  evidence  indicates  that 
total and some subscale scores may differ at least between 
OCD and OCD and autism, and autism alone. Despite this, 
given  the  high  degree  of  co-occurrence  observed  between 
autism and OCD and the evidenced overlaps in the expres-
sion  and  content  of  repetitive  behaviors,  it  may  be  useful 
for  clinicians  to  utilize  diagnostic  measures  that  consider 
both  conditions  in  early  diagnostic  assessments.  Further-
more, analyses of repetitive behaviors based on total scores 
only limit the degree to which unique behaviors can be criti-
cally  compared  and  subsequently  understood.  Some  types 
of repetitive behaviors may be more frequent or severe in 
autism or OCD, such as hoarding in autistic adults or magi-
cal/superstitious  compulsions  in  children  with  OCD,  as 
highlighted in the current findings. However, more research 
at the subscale and item-level is needed to confirm differ-
ences  in  the  manifestation  of  different  types  of  repetitive 
behaviors between conditions.

We  highlight  the  ambiguity  surrounding  characteriza-
tions of repetitive behaviors in autism versus OCD in this 
review. Despite the use of similar assessment tools, findings 
pertaining  particularly  to  the  content  of  repetitive  behav-
iors  are  inconsistent,  suggesting  more  research  is  needed 
to  understand  to  degree  to  which  behavioral  presentations 
across  these  two  conditions  are  the  same  and  different. 
At least at a phenotypical level, similarities in the expres-
sion and content of repetitive behavior are notable. There-
fore,  deeper  understanding  of  the  function  and  experience 
of  repetitive  behaviors  is  needed  to  differentiate  between 
behavioral features in these two clinical populations more 
clearly. While individuals may exhibit the same behaviors, 
the factors driving the use of these behaviors may differ, and 
subsequently correspond to a distinct underlying diagnosis 
and  importantly,  different  treatment  and  supports.  In  the 
case  of  co-occurring  diagnosis,  this  may  be  a  particularly 
pertinent  consideration,  given  that  these  individuals  may 
exhibit both autism-related repetitive behaviors which sup-
port  self-regulation,  and  OCD-related  compulsions  mani-
fested in response to psychological distress. Future research 
aimed  at  clearly  differentiating  between  these  experiences 
with  repetitive  behavior  will  inform  more  accurate  differ-
ential  diagnosis  and  treatment  planning  and  maximize  the 
benefits of therapeutic support for autistic individuals, indi-
viduals with OCD, and individuals with both conditions.
