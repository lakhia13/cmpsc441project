Alcohol Use Disorder and 
Co-Occurring Mental Health 
Conditions

Laura E. Kwako, Jenica Patterson, Ihsan M. Salloum, and Ryan S. Trim

This issue of Alcohol Research: Current Reviews (ARCR) delves into 
studies on co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) and mental health 
conditions, exploring how this co-occurrence affects symptom severity, 
prognosis, and outcomes. Increased risk because of co-occurrence, 
challenges because of disorder heterogeneity, and efficacy of treatment 
interventions are reviewed.

Among people with AUD, depressive disorders are one of the 
most common co-occurring psychiatric conditions. In Alcohol Use 
Disorder and Depressive Disorders, McHugh and Weiss discuss the 
prevalence, course, and treatment of co-occurring AUD and depressive 
disorders. They also examine disproportionately affected populations, 
developmental pathways to co-occurrence, and the challenges of 
diagnosis because of overlapping symptoms.

In the “Focus On” review Suicidal Behavior: Links Between Alcohol 

Use Disorder and Acute Use of Alcohol, Conner and Bagge explore 
the connection between alcohol use and suicidal behavior. Postmortem 
investigations on individuals who have died by suicide have found that 
AUD is prevalent among this group and that acute use of alcohol was 
often present. In their review, Conner and Bagge discuss the role alcohol 
plays in increasing risk for suicidal behavior and consider the efficacy of 
various interventions.

Anker and Kushner consider the association between AUD and 

anxiety in Co-Occurring Alcohol Use Disorder and Anxiety: Bridging 
Psychiatric, Psychological, and Neurobiological Perspectives. They 
review the research on the psychiatric classifications of alcohol misuse 
and negative affect and examine the relationship between negative affect 
and alcohol use from a neurobiological standpoint.

Weera and Gilpin, in the “Focus On” review Biobehavioral 

Interactions Between Stress and Alcohol, examine how brain stress 
systems mediate the effects of stress on alcohol drinking. They summarize 
key findings from animal models and suggest that brain stress systems 
may be useful targets for medications development.

In Alcohol Use Disorder and Antisocial and Borderline 

Personality Disorders, Helle and colleagues focus on co-occurring 
AUD and personality disorders. They discuss prevalence rates, potential 
explanations and causal models of comorbidity, and the status of 
treatment research. Helle and colleagues also discuss how personality 
traits, symptoms, and etiology can affect diagnosis and treatment.

In Alcohol Use Disorder and Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective 
Disorder, Archibald and colleagues explore schizophrenia spectrum 
disorders and their high co-occurrence with AUD. They describe how 
shared neurobiological mechanisms may explain the co-occurrence of 
these disorders. These authors suggest that combining pharmacologic 
interventions with other therapeutic modalities may address both issues 
more effectively.

Yule and Kelly, in Integrating Treatment for Co-Occurring 
Mental Health Conditions, consider the prevalence and treatment 
of co-occurring AUD and mental health conditions. They discuss 
screening tools, assessment, and the development of different treatment 
approaches. They also review the challenges to effective treatment and 
emphasize the importance of treating of both conditions.

From the Editor in Chief

After much consideration, NIAAA leadership and journal staff have 
made the decision that ARCR will transition to an online-only 
publication format in 2020. An analysis of the readership found that 
although print subscriptions have declined in recent years, readers 
regularly access ARCR content online through PubMed, PubMed 
Central, and the ARCR website. The online-only format will allow for 
more frequent and timely publications, permit reviews of emerging areas 
of alcohol research, and reduce ARCR’s carbon footprint. As an open-
access journal, ARCR will continue to be freely available to the public 
and the alcohol research community.
