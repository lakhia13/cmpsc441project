Abstract

Background and Objectives: Poor sleep is prevalent among individuals with social anxiety 
disorder (SAD) and may affect treatment outcome. We examined whether: (1) individuals with 
SAD differed from healthy controls (HCs) in sleep quality, (2) baseline sleep quality moderated 
the effects of treatment (Cognitive-behavioral group therapy [CBGT] vs. mindfulness-based stress 
reduction [MBSR] vs. waitlist [WL]) on social anxiety, (3) sleep quality changed over treatment, 
and (4) changes in sleep quality predicted anxiety 12-months post-treatment.

Design: Participants were 108 adults with SAD from a randomized controlled trial of CBGT vs. 
MBSR vs. WL and 38 HCs.

Methods: SAD and sleep quality were assessed pre-treatment and post-treatment, and SAD was 
assessed again 12-months post-treatment.

Results: Participants with SAD reported poorer sleep quality than HCs. The effect of treatment 
condition on post-treatment social anxiety did not differ as a function of baseline sleep quality. 
Sleep quality improved in MBSR, significantly more than WL, but not CBGT. Sleep quality 
change from pre- to post-treatment in CBGT or MBSR did not predict later social anxiety.

Conclusions: MBSR, and not CBGT, improved sleep quality among participants. Other results 
were inconsistent with prior research; possible explanations, limitations, and implications for 
future research are discussed.

Introduction

Page 2

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by intense fear and avoidance of social 
situations (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). SAD is highly prevalent 
(lifetime prevalence 12.1%; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005), and 
individuals with SAD experience decreased life satisfaction (Eng, Coles, Heimberg, & 
Safren, 2005; Hambrick, Turk, Heimberg, Schneier, & Liebowitz, 2003; Olatunji, Cisler, & 
Tolin, 2007) and impaired functioning across multiple domains including work, school, and 
general social functioning (Aderka et al., 2012; Katzelnick et al., 2001; Ruscio et al., 2008). 
In addition, SAD is often associated with increased sleep dysfunction (e.g., Buckner, 
Bernert, Cromer, Joiner, & Schmidt, 2008; Ramsawh, Stein, Belik, Jacobi, & Sareen, 2009; 
Roth et al., 2006), the presence of which has been associated with greater severity of 
symptoms among individuals with SAD (Kushnir, Marom, Mazar, Sadeh, & Hermesh, 
2014).

Sleep dysfunction is a widespread problem, with about 30% of the general population 
reporting at least some symptoms of insomnia and sleep-related disturbances (Ancoli-Israel 
& Roth, 1999; Morin, Leblanc, Daley, Gregoire, & Merette, 2006). Past research has 
indicated that many anxiety disorders, including SAD, are associated with sleep dysfunction; 
one study found that, after controlling for past month substance use and mood disorders, 
SAD, along with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and agoraphobia, was associated with 
a three-to-fourfold increase in the likelihood of reported sleep difficulties (Ramsawh et al., 
2009). Overall, however, the literature on the association between SAD and sleep 
dysfunction is somewhat less consistent than the literature on the association between sleep 
dysfunction and other anxiety disorders, such as GAD, posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), and panic disorder (Mellman 2006; Mellman 2008); some studies have 
demonstrated that sleep disturbance among individuals with generalized SAD is only mildly 
elevated (Pace-Schott et al., 2018) or is no worse than that of non-anxious controls (Brown, 
Black, & Uhde, 1994). However, studies that do find an association between SAD and sleep 
disturbance have report the percentage of individuals with SAD reporting such disturbances 
to be around 50-60% (e.g., Stein, Kroft, & Walker, 1993; Zalta et al., 2013). When present, 
the association between SAD and sleep dysfunction may be explained in part by the close 
relationship between repetitive negative thinking—an important cognitive process in the 
characterization and maintenance of SAD (e.g., Brozovich & Heimberg, 2008)—and 
reductions in sleep quality (Guastella & Moulds, 2007; Harvey & Payne, 2002). Evidence 
also suggests that poor sleep may lead to greater social avoidance (Simon & Walker, 2018) 
and that there is a bidirectional relationship between sleep problems and anxiety more 
generally (Alvaro, Roberts, & Harris, 2013), suggesting that poor sleep may, in turn, worsen 
social avoidance and anxiety over time. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that poor 
sleep may impair extinction learning, which in turn contributes to the etiology and 
perpetuation of multiple anxiety disorders (e.g., Pace-Schott, Germain, & Milad, 2015). 
Therefore, it is important to both clarify the association between SAD and sleep dysfunction 
and to address such problems in treatment for SAD when they are present.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), an efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders (e.g., 
Olatunji, Cisler, & Deacon, 2010), appears to be associated with moderate improvements in

sleep over the course of treatment for numerous anxiety-related conditions that are 
associated with sleep difficulties, such as GAD, panic disorder, and PTSD; however, little 
data exist on whether improvements in sleep occur over the course of CBT for SAD 
(Belleville, Cousineau, Levrier, St.-Pierre-Delorme, & Marchand, 2010). In addition, no data 
exist on improvements in sleep over the course of other treatments for SAD, such as 
mindfulness-based treatments, which have also been shown to be efficacious in the treatment 
of SAD (e.g., Koszycki, Benger, Shlik, & Bradwejn, 2007; Norton, Abbott, Norberg, & 
Hunt, 2015; Hjeltnes et al., 2017; Goldin et al., 2016). Therefore, it is important to 
investigate whether there are concomitant improvements in sleep quality over the course of 
effective treatments for SAD, as well as whether certain modes of treatment for SAD are 
more effective in improving sleep quality than others. Furthermore, it is important to 
determine whether improvements in sleep quality over treatment for SAD are associated 
with subsequent improvements in social anxiety symptoms, in order to clarify the extent to 
which improvements in sleep contribute to more holistic improvements for individuals with 
SAD over time.

Another important area of investigation is whether and how pre-treatment sleep difficulties 
may affect the progression and outcome of the original target of treatment for SAD. There 
are several reasons to conjecture that sleep difficulties may impede learning and dampen the 
effects of both CBT and mindfulness-based treatments for SAD, such as mindfulness-based 
stress reduction (MBSR). Accumulated evidence suggests that reduced sleep impairs the 
abilities to reason logically (Blagrove, Alexander, & Horne, 1995), sustain focus on complex 
cognitive tasks, and think flexibly (Gobin, Banks, Fins, & Tartar, 2015; Harrison & Horne, 
1999; Horne, 1988), and improvements during both CBT and MBSR often rely on such 
cognitively taxing activities. For instance, cognitive reappraisal—defined as an emotion 
regulation strategy that involves modifying the meaning of a stimulus or context that gives 
rise to an emotion (Gross, 2013)—mediates improvements in social anxiety during CBT for 
SAD (Goldin et al., 2012; Goldin et al., 2016), and there is evidence to suggest that poorer 
sleep quality is associated with reduced ability to use cognitive reappraisal to decrease 
negative emotion (Mauss, Troy, & LeBourgeois, 2013). In addition, mindfulness-based 
treatments such as MBSR place a large emphasis on engaging attention and “mindful 
awareness” (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). However, because alertness and vigilance are the cognitive 
capacities most consistently and severely affected by poor sleep (Gobin et al., 2015; Goel et 
al., 2009; Lim & Dinges, 2008; McCarthy & Waters, 1997; Van Dongen et al., 2003), it also 
seems likely that individuals experiencing poor sleep quality may have difficulty cultivating 
the focused attention and awareness that are central to mindfulness-based treatment 
modalities. Other important mechanisms of treatment for SAD that may be affected by poor 
sleep include memory and learning; sleep has been shown to be important in supporting 
memory consolidation processes (Diekelmann & Born, 2010), and poor sleep likely 
interferes with the fear extinction learning that takes place in the exposure exercises integral 
to treatments like CBGT (e.g., Craske et al., 2008; Silvestri & Root, 2008). Few studies thus 
far have examined the dampening effect poor sleep quality may have on the improvement of 
social anxiety symptoms during treatment. Zalta and colleagues (2013) demonstrated that 
poorer baseline sleep quality was associated with slower improvement over time and poorer 
endpoint outcome among individuals in group CBT for SAD. However, the effect of poor

Method

Participants

sleep on improvement in social anxiety symptoms over the course of other efficacious 
treatments for SAD (e.g., MBSR) has not yet been examined. More work is needed to 
replicate and expand on initial supporting evidence that poor sleep quality is associated with 
worse outcomes in treatment for SAD.

In the present study, we examined four questions: (1) whether self-reported sleep quality 
differed in individuals with SAD compared to healthy controls, (2) whether sleep quality 
moderated treatment outcome in CBGT vs. MBSR vs. WL for SAD (3) whether sleep 
quality improved over the course of CBGT or MBSR relative to WL and to each other, and 
(4) whether changes in sleep quality during treatment predicted social anxiety 12 months 
post-treatment.

Hypothesis 1: We expected that individuals with SAD would report lower sleep quality 
compared to healthy controls. Hypothesis 2: We expected that sleep quality would moderate 
the effect of treatment on social anxiety symptoms, such that lower baseline sleep quality 
would be associated with less pronounced improvements in social anxiety symptoms for 
those in both CBGT and MBSR relative to WL. Hypothesis 3: We expected that sleep 
quality would significantly improve over the course of both CBGT and MBSR for SAD 
relative to WL, but not relative to each other. Hypothesis 4: We hypothesized that greater 
improvement in sleep quality over treatment would predict lower social anxiety symptoms 
12 months post-treatment.

Participants (N = 146) comprised 108 treatment-seeking adults with a primary diagnosis of 
generalized SAD according to DSM-IV (APA, 1994) who were enrolled in a RCT 
investigating the effects of CBGT vs. MBSR vs. WL for SAD (Goldin et al., 2016), as well 
as 38 healthy control participants (HCs). Sample characteristics are reported in Table 1. To 
be eligible for the RCT, participants had to be 18 years of age or older, have a primary 
diagnosis of generalized SAD as evidenced by greater than moderate fear in five or more 
distinct social situations listed in the social phobia module of the Anxiety Disorders 
Interview Schedule for the DSM-IV-Lifetime Version (ADIS-IV-L; Di Nardo, Brown, & 
Barlow, 1994), and score 60 or higher on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale–Self-Report 
(LSAS-SR; Fresco et al., 2001; Liebowitz, 1987; Rytwinski et al., 2009). Participants were 
excluded if they had a lifetime history of neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, 
thought disorders, eating disorders, or bipolar disorder; significant symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder; major depressive episode in the 
past month; current substance or alcohol abuse/dependence; pharmacotherapy, CBT for 
anxiety, or any other psychotherapy in the past year; or previous MBSR or long-term 
meditation experience. Less than half of participants in the RCT met criteria for one or more 
current comorbid conditions (42.6%), including generalized anxiety disorder (28.7%), 
specific phobia (17.6%), panic disorder (13%), agoraphobia (7.4%), dysthymia (6.5%), 
major depressive disorder (3.7%), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.9%). All 
participants gave informed consent. This study was approved by the Stanford University 
Institutional Review Board.

Procedure

Page 5

Participants completed measures of social anxiety and perceived sleep quality, among other 
measures not considered here (for details, see Goldin et al., 2016). HCs completed these 
measures only once. Participants with SAD completed these measures prior to 
randomization to CBGT (n = 36), MBSR (n = 36), or WL (n = 36)1 and after completion of 
treatment or waitlist. Additionally, participants assigned to WL were randomized to CBGT 
or MBSR following the 12-week waiting period but their outcomes are not further 
considered here. All participants receiving CBGT or MBSR completed SAD symptom 
measures again 12 months post-treatment.

CBGT and MBSR were each comprised of 12 weekly, 2.5-hour sessions conducted in a 
group format with six participants per group. The CBGT protocol incorporated 
psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring skills, graduated exposure to feared social 
situations (both within session and at home), and an emphasis on relapse prevention and 
termination (Heimberg & Becker, 2002). Portions of the protocol developed by Hope, 
Heimberg, and Turk (2010) were also incorporated into the group treatment. The MBSR 
protocol followed the standard outline designed by Kabat-Zinn (1993), with some 
modifications to the protocol to match the duration of the CBGT group. The intervention 
included training in body scan meditation, sitting meditation, and mindful stretching, as well 
as a focus on the application of mindfulness as a method for noticing reactions and 
responding in new ways in social situations. The intervention also included additional 
readings and mindfulness exercises to supplement ongoing practice (Stahl & Goldstein, 
2010). Detailed information about the methodology of the parent RCT is available in the 
primary outcome paper (Goldin et al., 2016).

Diagnostic Assessment.—Diagnostic interviews were conducted at baseline using the 
ADIS-IV-L (Di Nardo et al., 1994). The ADIS has previously demonstrated excellent inter-
rater reliability (Brown, Di Nardo, Lehman & Campbell, 2001). In the present study, 
interviews were conducted by doctoral-level or masters-level clinicians and trained doctoral 
students, and 20% of the interviews were reviewed to assess inter-rater reliability. There was 
100% agreement with the original principal diagnosis of SAD (κ = 1.0) in this study.

Perceived Sleep Quality.—Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989), a widely-used scale for the measurement of subjective 
sleep disturbance. The scale consists of seven component items: subjective sleep quality, 
sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficacy, sleep disturbances, use of sleep 
medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Component items are scored from 
0 (Not during the past month/Very good) to 3 (Three or more times a week/Very bad) and 
summed to create a global PSQI score ranging from 0-21, with higher scores reflecting 
poorer sleep quality. A score of 5 has been shown to differentiate between good sleep quality 
(lower scores) and poor sleep quality (higher scores). The PSQI has exhibited adequate 

Measures

protocol.

internal consistency (α = .80), high convergent validity with other measures of sleep quality 
(rs > .69; Carpenter & Andrykowski, 1998), and good test-retest reliability over a two-day 
period (r = .90) and a 1.5-2 month period (r = .86) (Backhaus, Junghanns, Broocks, 
Riemann, & Hohagen, 2002). Internal consistency of the PSQI was adequate in the current 
sample (α = .74).

Treatment Outcome.—The primary outcome measure for this study was the Liebowitz 
Social Anxiety Scale-Self Report (LSAS-SR; Fresco et al., 2001; Liebowitz, 1987; 
Rytwinski et al., 2009). The LSAS-SR is a 24-item scale that assesses patients’ fear and 
avoidance of social and performance situations. Each item asks individuals to rate both their 
fear and avoidance of a situation over the past week on a 4-point Likert-type scale, with a 
range from 0 (None/Never) to 3 (Severe/Usually). Item ratings are summed to create a total 
score ranging from 0-144. The LSAS-SR has demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .
96; Rytwinski et al., 2009) and is highly correlated with the original clinician-administered 
version (rs = .85-.98 among individuals with SAD; Fresco et al., 2001). It is sensitive to 
treatment change (e.g., S. Baker, Heinrichs, Kim, & Hofmann, 2002; Goldin et al., 2012, 
2016) and has demonstrated strong convergent validity (r = .62-.71) with other measures of 
social anxiety among individuals with SAD (Fresco et al., 2001). The measure has also 
demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r = .83) over a 12-week period (S. Baker et al., 
2002). The LSAS-SR exhibited high internal consistency (α = .92) in the current study.

Missing Data

All 108 participants with SAD and 38 healthy controls had complete data at baseline. There 
were 6 participants with SAD who dropped out of the parent RCT and did not have post-
treatment data. In addition to the 6 individuals who dropped out, an additional 11 
participants (10.8% of completers) did not have full post-treatment data. To examine 
whether those missing data at post-treatment significantly differed from those with full data 
at post-treatment on clinical (treatment condition, baseline social anxiety severity) and 
demographic (gender, age, race/ethnicity) characteristics, a series of t-tests (for continuous 
baseline variables) and chi-square tests (for categorical variables) were conducted 
comparing these groups. Those with complete data at post-treatment and those with missing 
data at post-treatment did not significantly differ on any of the baseline clinical or 
demographic characteristic examined. Therefore, listwise deletion was used to handle 
missing data when examining baseline sleep quality as a moderator of the effects of 
treatment on social anxiety, as well as to examine sleep quality improvement over treatment.

Of participants in the CBGT or MBSR conditions, post-treatment LSAS data were missing 
for 17 participants in the full sample (23.6%) and for 12 participants in the completer sample 
(17.9%). Because there was a high number of missing data at follow-up, we used multiple 
imputation to handle missing data at 12 months post-treatment and to conduct analyses 
examining changes in sleep quality as a predictor of follow-up social anxiety. These analyses 
were run in Mplus Version 7.31 (Muthén & Muthén, 2015).

Results

Baseline sleep quality

Page 7

Our first hypothesis was that individuals with SAD would report overall lower baseline sleep 
quality than HCs. To examine this question, we compared the pre-treatment sleep quality of 
individuals with SAD to that of HCs using an independent samples t-test. At baseline, 
individuals with SAD reported significantly poorer sleep quality than HCs. In addition, there 
was a significantly greater proportion of individuals with SAD who reported a global sleep 
quality score above the clinical cutoff of 5, with higher scores indicating poorer sleep quality 
(see Table 2 for complete results).

Among individuals with SAD, there were no significant differences in baseline sleep quality 
between participants in the CBGT, MBSR, and WL conditions. Using the cutoff score of 5 
or above, there was no significant difference in distribution across groups of those who were 
considered poor sleepers at baseline (see Table 2).

Baseline sleep quality moderation of effect of treatments on social anxiety

As reported in Goldin et al. (2016), relative to WL, both CBGT and MBSR resulted in 
reliable and clinically significant improvement in social anxiety. In order to examine 
whether treatment condition (CBGT vs MBSR vs. WL) would differentially predict post-
treatment social anxiety symptoms as a function of baseline sleep quality, we conducted a 
linear regression analysis. Treatment condition was dummy coded with WL as the reference 
group. Pre-treatment LSAS-SR and PSQI scores were mean-centered. The interaction 
between treatment condition and baseline sleep quality did not significantly predict outcome, 
as indexed by post-treatment social anxiety (LSAS-SR), controlling for baseline social 
anxiety (see Table 3).2

We next hypothesized that sleep quality would improve in both CBGT and MBSR relative to 
WL, but not relative to each other. We first examined whether there was an improvement in 
sleep quality from pre- to post-treatment in each treatment condition. Participants showed 
significant improvement in sleep quality over treatment in MBSR (Ftime(1,26) = 7.93, p < .
2 = .05) or WL (Ftime(1,33) =

CBGT and MBSR relative to WL and to each other, we compared change in sleep quality 
from pre- to post-treatment in a series of 2 (time: pre-treatment, post-treatment) by 2 
(treatment: CBGT vs WL, MBSR vs. WL, or CBGT vs. MBSR) mixed analyses of variance. 
Participants in MBSR showed significantly greater improvements in sleep quality compared 
2 = .10), but did not differ from those in CBGT (F(1,55) 
to WL (F(1,59) = 6.55, p = .013, ηp

quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction) in addition 
to the total PSQI score. Results for all analyses were also non-significant, with no specific components of the PSQI at baseline 
moderating the relationship between treatment condition and post-treatment social anxiety. We do not report full details of these post 
hoc analyses here but will provide them to interested parties on request.

Change in sleep quality as a predictor of follow-up social anxiety

To examine whether treatment-related changes in sleep quality in the overall sample 
predicted follow-up social anxiety symptoms, we conducted a linear regression with a 
residualized change score for sleep quality predicting social anxiety symptoms 12 months 
post-treatment for participants receiving CBGT or MBSR, controlling for pre-treatment 
social anxiety. No association was found between changes in sleep quality from pre- to post-
treatment and social anxiety symptoms at follow-up (β = .16, p =.28)

Discussion

Poor sleep is common and prevalent in anxiety disorders such as SAD. However, literature 
on the relationship between SAD and sleep dysfunction has not always been consistent, and 
little is known how sleep quality both affects and is affected by treatment for SAD. In the 
present study, we investigated differences in perceived sleep quality between individuals 
with SAD and healthy controls, sleep quality as a potential moderator of treatment outcome 
among individuals with SAD, changes in sleep quality over the course of treatment for SAD, 
as well as change in sleep quality over treatment as a predictor of social anxiety symptoms 
one year post-treatment.

Our first hypothesis, that sleep quality would be significantly lower among individuals with 
SAD compared to healthy controls, was supported. In addition, two-thirds of the study 
participants with SAD reported poor sleep quality at baseline, consistent with research 
suggesting that sleep disturbance is highly prevalent among individuals with anxiety 
disorders (Cox & Olatunji, 2016; Roth et al., 2006) including individuals with SAD 
(Ramsawh et al., 2009; Stein et al., 1993; Zalta et al., 2013).

Our second hypothesis was that baseline sleep quality would moderate the effect of 
treatment on outcome such that treatment gains for individuals in CBGT and MBSR would 
be less pronounced relative to WL among those with poor sleep quality at baseline. 
However, our results did not support this hypothesis; sleep quality was not a significant 
moderator of the relationship between treatment condition and outcome, suggesting that 
social anxiety outcome was not impacted by sleep quality. These results were surprising 
given existing evidence from one previous study that poor sleep quality had a significant 
influence on the course and outcome of social anxiety symptoms in group CBT for SAD 
(Zalta et al., 2013). There are a few possible explanations for this unexpected result. First, it 
is possible that sleep quality truly does not affect treatment outcome in the way that we 
would expect, despite accumulated research on the effect of sleep disturbance on important 
cognitive and attentional mechanisms (e.g. Gobin et al., 2015; Lim & Dinges, 2008) that are 
likely implicated in both CBGT and MBSR, as well Zalta et al.’s (2013) finding of a 
negative effect of poor baseline sleep quality on the course and outcome of CBT for SAD. In 
the current study, there were significant, but only moderate, effects of the difference in sleep 
quality between participants with SAD and healthy controls, which may perhaps indicate 
that, although individuals with SAD experience sleep difficulties, these are not severe

enough to play a significant role in SAD symptomatology and treatment. Another possible 
explanation for these results is that, while many studies that examine the relationship of poor 
sleep and related deficits rely on manipulated sleep disturbance, including extensive sleep 
deprivation, to study these effects (e.g., Lim & Dinges, 2008), we relied on a measure of 
naturally-occurring sleep quality to examine the relationship between sleep quality and 
outcome. Therefore, it is possible that the effects were less pronounced then they would be 
under conditions in which sleep quality is manipulated (or, as stated above, in a sample with 
more severe sleep dysfunction).

Out next hypothesis was that that sleep quality would improve in both CBGT and MBSR 
relative to WL (but not relative to each other). Most research on the improvement of sleep 
during anxiety treatment is both limited to studies focused on anxiety disorders other than 
SAD and studies examining only CBT (Belleville et al., 2010). Few studies have examined 
whether sleep quality concomitantly improves during mindfulness-based treatments for 
anxiety, although some pilot research suggests that it does (Yook et al., 2008). Our results 
indicated that only individuals in the MBSR treatment condition reported significant 
improvements in sleep quality, both within-condition and relative to WL. Individuals in the 
CBGT condition experienced a non-significant improvement in sleep quality at post-
treatment, and this was not different from WL. Furthermore, there was no significant 
difference between the MBSR and CBGT groups in changes in sleep quality over treatment. 
Overall, these results may suggest that mindfulness-based approaches may be particularly 
helpful in reducing sleep difficulties among individuals with SAD. One possible explanation 
for this finding is that although neither CBGT or MBSR involve any intervention 
specifically directed at sleep dysfunction, the mindfulness skills taught in MBSR are more 
easily generalizable by individuals with SAD and are able to address a broader range of 
symptoms in this population, including poor sleep.

Our final hypothesis, that changes in sleep quality over treatment would predict lower social 
anxiety 12 months post-treatment, was also not supported. Although there were 
improvements in sleep for some individuals in the study over the course of treatment, our 
findings suggest that these changes do not necessarily predict later improvement in social 
anxiety symptoms. These findings perhaps indicate that improvements in sleep quality that 
take place during treatment do not precede reduction in social anxiety symptoms, but instead 
may follow from positive treatment outcomes.

Our study had a few limitations that should be noted. One limitation of our study was its sole 
reliance on self-report measures of sleep quality. Although the investigation of perceived 
sleep quality is both important and informative in understanding the subjective experience of 
individuals undergoing treatment, some research suggests that self-report measures of sleep 
quality and duration are not as highly correlated with more objective measures of sleep 
quality, such as actigraphy and polysomnography, as they are with other subjective measures 
of sleep quality (Backhaus, Junghanns, Broocks, Riemann, Hohgen, 2002; F. Baker, 
Maloney, & Driver, 1999; Lauderdale, Knutson, Yan, Liu, & Rathouz, 2008). Therefore, it is 
possible that the associations between sleep quality and treatment outcome that we predicted 
may differ when examining objective versus subjective measures of sleep quality. 
Furthermore, the self-report measure used is a retrospective measure of sleep quality that

asks participants to recall sleep difficulties over the past month. Other subjective measures, 
such as daily sleep diaries or a report of sleep quality more proximal to treatment sessions, 
may have proven more informative or pertinent to the questions of the current study.

Additionally, our study examined measures taken only at baseline and post-treatment. 
Because we did not examine week-to-week changes in sleep quality and outcome, our study 
may have been limited in elucidating our understanding of how sleep quality affects changes 
in social anxiety over the course of treatment. It is possible and likely that sleep quality 
affects anxiety symptoms on a week-to-week basis, as was shown in the Zalta et al. (2013) 
study. Because our study only measured sleep quality at two time points, we may not have 
accurately captured the ways in which sleep quality affects psychological symptoms over 
time. Alternatively, it may be the case that sleep quality is simply not a powerful predictor of 
treatment outcome over time. Our finding that changes in sleep quality over treatment did 
not significantly predict social anxiety 12 months post-treatments does seem to support this 
notion, indicating that improvements in sleep quality do not necessarily precede 
improvements in social anxiety.

Our study found that individuals with SAD report significantly lower sleep quality than 
healthy controls and that sleep quality improves over the course of MBSR, but not CBGT, 
for SAD. However, our study does not support the current literature on the relationship 
between poor sleep quality and poorer treatment outcome for SAD. Further studies are 
needed to replicate past findings on the relationship between sleep quality and SAD 
treatment outcome for a more conclusive understanding of these relationships, potentially 
adding more extensive measures of objective and subjective sleep quality over time. In 
addition, more research is needed to replicate our finding that sleep significantly improves 
over the course of MBSR treatment for SAD. These future directions will allow us to better 
understand if and under what conditions concurrent sleep interventions are a necessary 
augmentation to SAD treatment.

Sleep quality significantly improved over treatment for the MBSR condition only. These 
changes were significant in comparison to WL, but not CBGT. PSQI = Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index; MBSR = mindfulness-based stress reduction; CBGT = cognitive-behavioral 
group therapy; WL = waitlist control.
