Editorial on the Research Topic
A new science of suffering, the wisdom of the soul, and the new behavioral
economics of happiness: towards a general theory of well-being

This Research Topic is designed to extend the theme of existential positive psychology
(EPP) to new research areas. Theoretically, it is oriented toward a general theory of global
well-being, which incorporates three pillars of EPP (Wong et al., 2022):

(1) the existential universals of suﬀering, ultimate concerns, and the deep-seated human

yearning for meaning, social connection, and spirituality;

(2) unique expressions and experiences of existential universals in diﬀerent seasons of

life and diﬀerent cultures; and

(3) personal transformation through suﬀering.
A general theory of well-being needs to cover the complete spectrum of existential
well-being, which includes not only diﬀerent facets of personhood but also wide-ranging
dynamics of nature and culture that aﬀect human existence, such as globalization, climate
change, ecology, and the mysterious invisible forces capable of impacting well-being. It must
be capable of integrating the bright and dark sides of life, as well as the unknown forces that
may beneﬁt or threaten humanity.

Shifting to a new science of suffering

A new science of suﬀering (also known as positive psychology of suﬀering) is needed to
better understand (1) diﬀerent kinds of suﬀering (e.g., necessary vs. unnecessary suﬀering)
and (2) the bidirectionality of suﬀering (i.e., the conditions under which suﬀering can either
degrade or strengthen us). This new science of suﬀering is essential for creating a more
complete picture of human ﬂourishing, just as the science of pain and disease control is
essential for physical health and medical science.

Melios et al. provide one of the latest multinational empirical
studies on low subjective well-being by leveraging cross-sectional
data from the Gallup World Poll. Although individual-level factors
had the greatest explanatory power, evidence of
interactions
between individual and country-level factors on subjective well-
being support the idea that human ﬂourishing is shaped by a
complex system involving people and the places in which they live
(Counted et al., 2021; VanderWeele et al., 2022).

Fayard and Mayer’s qualitative study indicated that young male
university graduates understand the challenges of transitioning to
the workplace and are able to transform their stressful experiences
into a salutogenic process. Their work represents a paradigm shift
from a pathogenic approach toward a positive health paradigm
in which an individual’s position on the continuum from health
to disease is determined by the interaction of environmental
threats, their degree of resistance, and the strength of their sense
of coherence.

Kaftanski and Hanson’s conceptual article forms part of the
emerging trend of ﬂipping the common narrative that suﬀering
is wholly an impediment to human well-being. Consistent with
recent theoretical (e.g., Wong et al., 2022) and empirical literature
(e.g., Wilkinson et al., 2023), the authors recognize that conceptions
of well-being typically overlook suﬀering or assume an unrealistic
version of human life in which suﬀering is nonexistent.

Sease et al.’s perspective article focuses on existential isolation,
which is a special case of existential suﬀering (Wong, 2015). Based
on their review of relevant literature, they theorize that existential
isolation could thwart therapeutic interventions in justice settings
because people involved in the justice system may feel more
disjointed from their counselors and peers.

Güven and Arslan explore EPP by studying themes of suﬀering
and happiness in Turkish folk poetry. Their research shows that
suﬀering is an inescapable part of human life, but it can also be
source for building resilience. These ﬁndings support the notion
of transforming suﬀering for an adaptive purpose (Ho et al.,
2022; VanderWeele et al., 2023), and suggest that suﬀering has the
potential to promote growth and contribute to mature happiness.

Wong and Laird’s perspective article explores the universality
and complexity of human suﬀering. They present some possible
ways of classifying suﬀering in everyday life as well as in the clinical
setting, while acknowledging the diﬃculty of developing a complete
taxonomy of suﬀering.

Advancing a framework of existential
intelligence

Since a general theory of well-being deals with big questions
about human nature and human existence, existential intelligence
(also known as existential thinking or life intelligence) plays a
major role in the prevention and transformation of suﬀering.
Existential intelligence involves having the necessary existential
wisdom to navigate adverse situations in ways that lead to a
meaningful and honorable life, and it may be one of the most
important capacities for dealing with the complex questions related
to good and evil, happiness and suﬀering, as well as life and
death. For example, in situations where there is a need to balance
conﬂicting values and demands, a person must consult their

conscience and wisdom of the soul to decide on the best course
of action.

some
self-transcendence
enables people to endure and transcend suﬀering. From an
examination of the empirical literature, they propose that self-
transcendence may support endurance of suﬀering at
three
levels: (1) self-transcendent experiences (aﬀect),
psychological
thinking (cognition), and (3) need for
(2) self-transcendent
self-transcendence (motivation).

Lau et al.’s brief report investigates the relationship between
mindfulness, stress, savoring beliefs, and life satisfaction in a cross-
sectional sample of Hong Kong adolescents during the COVID-19
pandemic. They found that mindfulness is related to lower stress
and greater life satisfaction and savoring beliefs.

In Kam and Bellehumeur’s perspective article, they argue
that deeper levels of unconsciousness are needed to adaptively
cope with the uncomfortable experience of
the ambiguous
coexistence of opposites. Their work is comparable to ideas
concerning wisdom of the soul or life intelligence, which explicate
the importance of navigating and resolving the paradoxes of
human existence through transcending opposites (Wong et al.,
2021).

Horikoshi’s perspective article

focuses on the positive
psychology of challenge. He argues that studying activities and
processes involving challenges can provide insights into dialectical
integration of opposites because the concept of challenge
encompasses both positive and negative elements.

Lau and Tov used experimental data from a sample of
Singaporean university students to explore whether meaning-
making strategies facilitate adaptive processing of daily negative
experiences. They found that positive reappraisal and self-
distancing aﬀected situational meaning, but that the circumstances
under which these strategies supported meaning-making varied.
This work emphasizes the importance of wisely selecting and
applying diﬀerent coping strategies to eﬀectively make meaning out
of negative life events.

Rajkumar’s brief research report uses data from the 2021
World Happiness Report to explore the relationship between
culture and self-reported happiness in 78 countries before (2017–
2019) and during (2020–2021) the COVID-19 pandemic. The
ﬁndings provide some support for the importance of studying
cultural diﬀerences in existential universals, such as happiness
and suﬀering.

Han et al. used repeated cross-sectional data from Chinese
adolescents to examine group orientation and mental health
before (2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2021). Their
ﬁndings demonstrated the protective value of group orientation in
transcending egotistic concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and that contextual factors may inﬂuence the protective beneﬁts of
group orientation on mental health.

In their original research article, Liu et al. use two waves
of longitudinal data from a sample of Chinese adolescents to
investigate whether the relationship between self-transcendence
is mediated by emotion
values and emotional adjustment
regulation. Their ﬁndings shed light on potential avenues to
support adolescents’ emotional adjustment, as well as provide
further evidence on the beneﬁts of self-transcendence.

Developing a new behavioral
economics of happiness

The new behavioral economics of happiness does not presume
that human beings are well-informed rational decision-makers
capable of choosing what is in their best interest. Instead,
it
recognizes that rational choices are aﬀected by three human
limitations: (1) humans often have ﬂawed perceptions of reality,
including what they really want in order to be happy; (2) universal
human challenges, such as diﬃculties exercising self-control and
a lack of self-understanding; and (3) the tendency for humans to
choose immediate self-gratiﬁcation rather than the long-term gain
of something meaningful and of enduring value. It recognizes that
true ﬂourishing is only possible when people are awakened to the
existential truth of overcoming their dark side and “inner demons”
to become who they are meant to be.

In their opinion article, Mead et al. suggest that personal
development progress must be reinforced by a commitment to
making systemic changes that allow for new “ecological economics”
to emerge in post-growth societies. The authors suggest that
the new era of Symbiocene has much potential for developing
evidenced-based approaches that could shape government policies
and transform societies.

Tweed et al.’s conceptual article draws on ideas from Martin
Buber to touch on the core issue of developing a new model of
behavioral economics. Rather than viewing people as instruments
to be used for advancing self-interests, this model advocates
treating people as human beings (i.e., as ends in and of themselves
rather than as means to an end). By simply changing our views and
attitudes toward others, we can become more just, authentic, and
compassionate in our interactions with others.

Conclusion

This Research Topic draws attention to some key blind spots
in research on well-being, including notions that (1) ﬂourishing
necessarily involves the dialectic integration of positives and
negatives; (2) ideal happiness is more about inner peace, balance,

and harmony in the midst of adversity and hardship than attaining
maximum happiness; (3) triumphing over suﬀering requires having
a courageous stance toward one’s fate and making conscionable
choices despite the constraints imposed by one’s circumstances;
and (4) the science of human ﬂourishing requires a delicate
balance between studying existential universals, the particularities
of each culture, and the unique experiences of each person (Arslan
and Wong, 2021; Wong et al., 2021; Wong and Cowden, 2022;
Cowden et al., 2023). These points are at the heart of EPP’s
research agenda and align with a dialectic general theory of
well-being, which is constituted by the integration of human
agency and divine support, noble idealism and brutal realism, and
ancient wisdom in the humanities and the scientiﬁc research of
contemporary psychology.
