Abstract

Therapeutic Fairytales can support child development, and many studies have recognized its benefits for  children. 
However, no one has integrated storytellers as a holistic tool to support children’s overall development, whether 
in a clinical, educational, or family-based practice context. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic literature 
review  to  effectively  explain  how  story  therapy  can  be  used  in  clinical,  educational,  and  family-based  practice 
contexts  to  support  children’s  holistic  development.  The  study’s  novelty  provides  a  new  perspective  on  story 
therapy in child development with a systematic approach that highlights the unique contribution of a story as a 
therapeutic tool that supports mental health, educational aspects, and family dynamics. This systematic litera-
ture review follows the PRISMA guidelines to collect 33 articles indexed by the Scopus database identified and 
 selected for review. The review identified two main themes in the context of clinical, educational, and family-based 
practice: various forms of story therapy utilization and types of child development. The research results show that 
Therapeutic Fairytales has various benefits in supporting children’s holistic development, including emotional, 
cognitive, social, moral, and language development. This study implies that Therapeutic Fairytales becomes a 
more structured and integrated tool in child intervention programs in various fields, inspiring further research on 
its effectiveness in other contexts.

Introduction

The  holistic  development  of  children  is  gaining  increasing 
attention, not only in a clinical context but also in the context 
of  integrating  educational  approaches  [1–3]  and  family 
intervention  [4].  Fairy  tales  have  been  proven  to  improve 
children’s development in various holistic aspects. [5,6]. The 
influence of fairy tales on children’s development uses various 
psychological  mechanisms  [7].  Fairy  tales  as  literature  are 

entertaining, so the various values   of goodness in them will 
be  more  likely  to  be  understood  easily  and  accepted  with 
a  feeling  of  comfort  (happiness)  than  teaching  life  values   
through conventional methods. 
The term Therapeutic Fairytales refers to fairytales that are 
designed  or  used  with  the  specific  purpose  of  supporting 
the 
healing,  emotional  development,  and 

improving

psychological well-being of children [8]. Not all fairytales are 
directly designed for therapeutic purposes (in the context of 
psychotherapy). Still, from a broader point of view, every fairy 
tale can be considered to have therapeutic elements because 
it  always  has  the  nature  of  Dulce  et  utile  (entertaining  and 
educating).  Even  in  a  therapeutic  context,  the  fairytales 
used  are  not  always  Therapeutic  Fairytales  (in  the  specific 
sense); they may also include classic fairytales or folk tales 
employed  as  Therapeutic  Fairytales  in  a  broader  sense  [9]. 
Therefore,  this  article  uses  the  term  “Therapeutic  Fairytale” 
to  encompass  the  entire  spectrum  of  fairytales  capable  of 
providing  therapeutic  effects,  whether  explicitly  designed 
for  therapy  or  implicitly  supporting  the  holistic  development 
of  children.  This  approach  highlights  the  universal  potential 
of  fairytales  across  various  contexts,  including  educational, 
clinical, and familial settings.
Recent research has highlighted the importance of preparing 
teachers  to  use  fairytales  in  learning  as  a  therapeutic 
technique  for  students  [9].  This  supports  the  argument  that 
fairy tale interventions can also be categorized as therapeutic 
actions  in  non-clinical  contexts.  In  Family-Based  Practices, 
storytelling is done for various purposes [10], such as building 
emotional  bonds  and  supporting  language  and  literacy 
development.  These  are  the  same  as  general  therapeutic 
procedures,  which  are  always  carried  out  to  positively 
influence the patient’s development. 
In the context of family-based practice, children often ask their 
parents  to  read  their  favourite  fairytales  repeatedly  so  that 
children really remember the details of the story, which has an 
impact on their development [11]. This is similar to therapy in a 
special sense, usually done repeatedly. The similarity implies 
that  learning  in  schools  and  certain  parenting  practices  at 
home,  which  aim  to  support  the  development  of  children, 
can  be  seen  as  a  procedure  of  child  development  therapy. 
Thus,  fairytales  used  in  therapy  in  the  context  of  education 
and family can also be seen as therapeutic fairytales used in 
therapy to support the development of children.
This study supports previous research on the role of children’s 
literature  in  supporting  children’s  holistic  development  and 
well-being [12]. The literature review “Examines pedagogical, 
didactic  and  psychological/therapeutic  dimensions  of 
children’s literature, to highlight its role in promoting students’ 
holistic development and well-being” [12]. Previous research 
did not look at the perspective of utilising fairytales in family-
based practices, even though families play an important role 
in  children’s  mental  health  therapy  [13]  in  various  areas  of 
child development [14].
In this study, the use of fairy tales is seen in the didactic, clinical, 
and psychiatric aspects of practice and family-based practices 
at home. This article offers a new perspective on using fairy 
tale therapy in child development with a systematic approach 
that  has  not  been  widely  discussed  in  previous  literature. 

While many studies have recognised the therapeutic benefits 
of fairy tales, this article will highlight the unique contribution 
of fairytales as a therapeutic tool that supports mental health, 
educational aspects, and family dynamics.
By  examining  clinical,  educational,  and 
family-based 
practice,  this  article  aims  to  demonstrate  that  story  therapy 
can be a holistic method to support children’s development. 
This  creates  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  how 
stories  can  serve  as  a  medium  for  learning,  healing,  and 
strengthening family bonds. Through this systematic literature 
review,  this  article  contributes  to  the  development  of  story 
therapy theory and practice, making it a more accessible and 
applicable resource for parents and educators in their efforts 
to support the holistic development of children.

Methodology

This  research  uses  a  Systematic  Literature  Review  of 
questions  formed  using  systematic  and  explicit  methods  to 
identify,  select,  and  critically  evaluate  previous  research 
relevant to collecting and analysing data from these studies 
[15,16].  To  conduct  a  Systematic  Literature  Review  on  fairy 
tale therapy for child development, a search for articles from 
2015-2024  was  conducted  through  the  Publish  or  Perish 
application. The Scopus database was determined to maintain 
the  quality  of  the  articles  and  for  free  access  in  searches 
published or perished. The keywords used were fairytale, fairy 
tale,  fable,  storytelling,  storybook,  fairytale  therapeutic,  and 
fairytale  therapy.  672  papers  were  found  consisting  of  200 
articles each with the following keywords: fairytale storytelling, 
storybook; 20 articles for fairy tale; 30 articles for fable; 6 for 
fairytale therapeutic; and 16 for fairytale therapy.
This  Systematic  Literature  Review  follows  the  PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
Analysis) guidelines [17]. A total of 25 of them were excluded 
because they were identified as duplicates of the Covidence 
application.  The  selected  papers  were  only  articles  and 
conference papers, totalling 528 papers. Other papers, such 
as  books/book  chapters,  reviews,  editorials,  notes,  letters, 
and short surveys, were excluded. Potentially relevant articles 
underwent full-text review to determine eligibility for inclusion 
in our analysis. The inclusion criteria were: 1) articles published 
in  English  and  French  to  ensure  wide  understanding  and 
dissemination  in  the  academic  community;  2)  articles  must 
mention the use of fairy tales in supporting child development, 
both  in  educational  (school),  clinical  (psychotherapy),  and 
family  contexts;  3)  the  article  employs  Western  fairytales  or 
those  rooted  in  Western  cultural  contexts.  Fairytales  from 
different cultural backgrounds possess distinct characteristics 
[18], and ignoring these differences could result in unwarranted 
generalisations.

Masri et al.: Therapeutic Fairytales for Holistic Child Development: A Systematic Literature Review of Clinical, EducationalFor  articles  with  the  keywords  storybook  and  storytelling,  at 
least  there  is  an  explanation  that  the  concept  of  storytelling 
and  storybook  in  question  includes  fairytales  and  does  not 
specifically refer to non-fiction books/stories. Of the 58 relevant 
articles in English and French, 20 were removed due to closed 
access,  uncertainty  of  the  target  group,  and  uncertainty  of 
fairy tales as the object of research (for example, in articles 
with  the  keywords  storytelling  and  storybook,  the  intended 
ones  are  not  fairy  tales,  but  non-fiction  stories).  Finally,  33 
articles were left for analysis.

Table 1 systematically reviews children’s holistic development 
from therapeutic fairytale intervention.
All articles that met the inclusion criteria touched on the role 
of fairytales in the development of children between the ages 
of 2 months and 17 years. This systematic review found that 
therapeutic fairytales in the context of clinical, educational, and 
family-based practices play a role in the holistic development 
of children.
In  a  clinical  context,  therapeutic  fairytales  play  a  role  in 
language  development    [19];  cooperation  during  medical 
procedures  [20];  emotional  and  psychological  development, 
including  anxiety  reduction,  healing  from  trauma  [20–23], 
development  of  coping  mechanisms  and  mother-child 
attachment [22]. 
In  the  clinical  context  of  psychotherapy,  storytelling  plays 
a  role  in  healing  certain  traumatic  impacts.  Therapy  using 
storytelling is personalised to promote psychological growth,

meaning  in  life,  resilience,  self-realisation,  and  increased 
well-being  [21,23,24].  Fairytales  are  used  as  metaphors  to 
describe  the  condition  of  children  who  experience  trauma. 
One  article  metaphors  the  traumatic  condition  of  children  in 
the fairy tale Humpty Dumpty [22]. 
In  the  educational  context,  Fairy  tales  play  a  role  in  the 
development  of  narrative  understanding 
[25–29]  and 
conceptual  understanding  [27,30–32].  The  development 
of  critical  thinking  includes  questioning,  analysing,  and 
exploring  different  perspectives  from  the  fairy  tales  they 
read [33,34]. The development of creative thinking includes 
Divergent Thinking (the ability to generate many alternative 
ideas  or  different  solutions  to  a  problem)  and  Integrative 
Thinking  (the  ability  to  combine  various  elements  into 
one  original  and  effective  idea)  [35].  Executive  function 
development  includes  Inhibitory  Control/IC  (the  ability 

to  switch 

to  control  impulses  and  focus),  Working  Memory/WM 
(the  ability  to  remember  instructions  and  information), 
and  Attention  Shifting/AS  (the  ability 
from 
one  perspective  or  task  to  another)  [36].  Imagination 
development is obtained from the ability to create fairy tales 
[25].  Language  development  includes  the  development  of 
grammatical  skills  (phonology,  morphology,  vocabulary, 
and sentences) [25,33,37–40], narrative language [25], and 
science  vocabulary  [40].  The  development  of  social  skills 
through  learning  fairytales,  including  interaction  skills  and 
self-regulation in social situations [25]. The development of 
students’ moral values   in learning through fairy tales cannot 
be  denied  because  fairy  tales  contain  various  moral  and 
character  values,  such  as  religiosity,  hard  work,  creativity, 
discipline,  and  responsibility  [34],  also  including  self-
confidence [31].

Masri et al.: Therapeutic Fairytales for Holistic Child Development: A Systematic Literature Review of Clinical, EducationalIn the context of Family-Based Practices, therapeutic fairytales 
play  a  role  in  language,  emotional,  and  social  development 
domains.  Fairytales  play  a  role  in  language  development, 
including  grammatical  language  development  to  narrative 
understanding  [41–45].  Fairytales  play  a  role  in  children’s 
emotional  development,  especially  empathy  [46].  Fairytales 
play  a  role  in  social  development,  especially  the  skills  of 
initiating and maintaining communication [42,47].  
Children’s  exposure  to  storybooks  (especially  fairy  tales) 
contributes  significantly  to  Lower  Level  Language  Skills 
(LLL)  and  Higher  Level  Language  Skills  (HLL)  [41–45, 
47–49]. Children also showed receptive language development 
(understanding words heard) and expressive language (using 
words to express thoughts and feelings) through home story-
telling  interventions  [44,47].  Storytelling  not  only  mediates 
the  development  of  reading  skills  [43]  but  also  speaks  [48]. 
Storytelling not only mediates the development of verbal skills 
but  also  non-verbal  (eye  contact,  joint  attention,  and  use  of 
gestures)  through  responses  to  questions  and  instructions 
during  reading  sessions  [47].  Storytelling  activities  together 
support  children’s  development  in  initiating  communication 
[42,47].  It should be noted that appropriate reading techniques 
support  the  development  of  language  skills  through  reading 
fairy tales or support children’s involvement [47], the intensity 
of  reading  exposure  [44,49]  and  parental  awareness  of  the 
importance of reading fairytales [49]. Fairytales are also said 
to play a role in the development of children’s empathy [46]. 
Fairytales play a role in children’s social development [42]. 

Discussion

In  general,  this  study  found  that  fairy  tales  used  in  clinical, 
educational,  and  Family-Based  Practices  contexts  have 
therapeutic  qualities 
that  support  children’s  holistic 
development. The fairy tales employed to support children’s 
development are not limited to those specifically created for 
developmental  and  therapeutic  purposes  but  also  include 
general fairy tales such as classic tales like The Little Mermaid 
or Peter Pan [50]. These findings further reinforce the use of 
the term therapeutic fairytale to describe the general potential 
of fairy tales as a medium for supporting holistic development. 
These findings and opinions are supported by other research, 
which  also  found  that  traditional  fairy  tales  not  specifically 
designed for healing purposes can be utilised for therapeutic 
aims  and  have  been  proven  to  have  therapeutic  effects  on 
well-being  and  positive  development,  particularly  among 
stressed women [51].
In  the  clinical  context,  fairy  tales  and  their  application 
procedures  are  selected  using  an  individualised  approach 
tailored  to  each  child’s  specific  needs  to  support  their 
language, social, emotional, and psychological development. 

This is because fairy tale interventions aim to facilitate healing, 
whether  addressing  language  issues,  social  development 
challenges, or emotional and psychological concerns.
Regarding  emotional  and  psychological  development,  fairy 
tales with symbolism that aligns with the patient’s condition and 
their appropriate use are effective in addressing and healing 
psychological issues such as anxiety, depression, excessive 
fear, and low self-esteem, often rooted in traumatic experiences 
or loss [21,22,24,52]. Children with trauma frequently struggle 
to integrate their emotional experiences. Fairy tales, with their 
symbolic nature, enable children to project their emotions onto 
characters or situations within the story. For instance, children 
may project feelings of being “broken” through the symbolism 
of the fairy tale Humpty Dumpty [22]. Fairy tale interventions, 
such  as  reading  or  completing  stories  relevant  to  a  child’s 
psychological challenges, help them understand and accept 
their  emotions.  Writing  fairy  tales  provides  a  safe  space  for 
children to express their feelings without fear of judgment or 
threat.  These  interventions  can  also  be  combined  with  play 
or  drawing  therapy  as  a  means  for  children  to  present  and 
express  their  emotions  [22].  This  allows  therapists  to  gain 
deeper insights into the patient’s emotional and psychological 
state, which is crucial for the healing process.
One of the language development issues that can be addressed 
through  fairy  tale  interventions  is  the  narrative  language 
development of bilingual children [19]. This includes limitations 
in  lexical  diversity,  mean  length  of  utterance,  narrative 
structure, and coherence in story construction. Interventions 
using wordless picture storybooks are particularly relevant, as 
fairy tales contain words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs 
organised  into  cohesive  stories.  By  practising  storytelling 
based on wordless picture storybooks, children enhance their 
ability to construct words, form sentences, and organise ideas 
logically into engaging and coherent narratives. This process 
develops vocabulary sentence structure and broader narrative 
skills, such as connecting events, describing characters, and 
conveying  conflict  and  resolution  verbally.  Thus,  fairy  tales 
serve  as  an  effective  tool  for  supporting  holistic  language 
development [19].
In the context of social and emotional development, engaging 
fairy tales in visual formats, such as a child’s favourite video 
fairy  tale,  can  help  them  cooperate  more  easily  with  family 
and medical staff during clinical procedures [20,23]. Watching 
or listening to their favourite fairy tales distracts children from 
the intimidating clinical environment and reduces their anxiety. 
This makes children more cooperative as they feel safer and 
more  comfortable,  fostering  a  positive  social  atmosphere 
between the child, parents, and medical staff. It also provides 
children with an experience of managing emotions to create 
positive  social  interactions,  which  they  can  replicate  in 
other  social  contexts.  Furthermore,  the  success  of  fairy  tale 
interventions during medical procedures, such as anaesthesia 

140

Journal of Mother and Childthe 

induction or Intrathecal Nusinersen, significantly impacts the 
patient’s physical recovery and overall holistic development.
In  the  educational  context,  therapeutic  storytelling  supports 
children’s language and literacy, as well as cognitive, social, 
and  moral  development.  To  achieve  this  goal,  storytelling 
is  implemented  in  group-based  learning  practices.  Unlike 
clinical  contexts,  which  use  a  personalised  approach,  the 
school  environment  emphasises  collective  needs  while  still 
considering  individual  requirements  and  their  relevance  to 
everyday  life,  such  as  the  general  needs  of  early  childhood 
education  (ECE)  students.  Attention  to  individual  needs 
ensures that each child can be actively involved and benefit 
optimally  from  learning  activities.  For  children  undergoing 
trauma  recovery, 
therapeutic 
this  approach  allows 
effects  of  storytelling  to  work  subtly  on  the  subconscious 
level,  as  storytelling  is  not  explicitly  designed  for  healing. 
Thus,  storytelling  promotes  the  holistic  development  of 
children  through  inclusive,  relevant,  and  enjoyable  learning 
experiences.
In relation to the aspect of language development, wordless 
storybooks are also used in educational contexts to stimulate 
narrative production, as in clinical contexts. Story interventions 
in  educational  contexts  are  not  only  to  support  narrative 
language  development  but  also  to  enrich  vocabulary  in 
specific areas, such as mathematics and science vocabulary 
[30,40].  This  supports  holistic  language  development.  In 
addition, technology-based story interventions are also used 
to support children’s language development, for example, by 
using  digital  story  books  (e-books)  equipped  with  animation 
[26]. This opens opportunities for children to develop not only 
their  language  skills  but  also  other  skills,  such  as  cognitive, 
imagination, or digital literacy through educational contexts.
Fairy tales uniquely support children’s cognitive development. 
Through  stories,  children  learn  to  follow  plots,  understand 
cause-and-effect  relationships,  and  intuitively  grasp  moral 
lessons. Critical thinking develops as they analyse characters’ 
actions and seek solutions, while creative thinking is stimulated 
by  creating  new  endings  or  retelling  stories  from  different 
perspectives.  Executive  functions,  such  as  working  memory 
and impulse control, are enhanced by recalling story details 
and  engaging  in  role-play.  Additionally,  their  imagination 
expands through exploring the fantastical world of fairy tales, 
fostering creativity. With this approach, fairy tales serve as an 
effective tool for promoting holistic cognitive development.
As  explained  in  the  clinical  context,  fairy  tale  interventions 
in  education  are  also  combined  with  play  therapy,  such  as 
the  Storytelling  and  Story-Acting  (STSA)  method,  which  is 
effective  for  children’s  social  development  [25].  This  activity 
enhances  communication  skills,  teamwork  abilities,  and 
self-regulation, including impulse control and the capacity to 
share roles and responsibilities. Research [53] supports that 
learning should employ various techniques to foster children’s 

development, including simple storytelling followed by fairy tale 
dramatisation involving painting, construction, and exercises. 
Combining  fairy  tale  interventions  with  play  therapy  can  be 
a valuable approach to maximising the therapeutic effects of 
fairy tales on children’s development.
Fairytales play a crucial role in shaping children’s morals by 
teaching ethical values and character, such as distinguishing 
between  right  and  wrong  and  understanding  the  story’s 
message. The selection of fairytales should consider cultural 
contexts,  as  each  culture  has  different  value  priorities.  For 
example,  in  Indonesia  [53],  fairytales  instil  values  related 
to  relationships  with  God,  oneself,  family,  society,  and 
the  environment,  while  in  Western  cultures,  they  tend  to 
emphasise  individualism  or  freedom  of  expression.  Thus, 
fairytales serve as an effective medium for conveying moral 
values tailored to the cultural needs of each society.
Therapeutic  fairy  tales  play  a  crucial  role  in  supporting 
children’s 
language,  emotional,  cognitive,  and  social 
development in the context of family-based caregiving. Fairy 
tales in the family setting are particularly important for fostering 
development  through  activities  such  as  reading  aloud  or 
storytelling. Reading fairy tales effectively promotes children’s 
growth  [46].  The  selection  of  stories,  reading  methods,  and 
the  repetition  or  intensity  of  reading  activities  significantly 
enhance  the  effectiveness  of  these  activities  in  supporting 
children’s development.
Interactive  shared 
reading,  which  emphasises  child 
engagement while maintaining contact and intimacy between 
parents and children, should be considered. This method not 
only  supports  language  and  cognitive  development  but  also 
strengthens parent-child attachment (emotional development) 
[41] and enhances communication and empathy skills (social 
development) [18,21]. Conducted in a relaxed home setting, 
parents  often  ask  simple  questions  or  provide  comments  to 
expand the story, creating opportunities for dialogue, reflection, 
and  the  reinforcement  of  social  skills  in  a  comfortable  and 
enjoyable environment.
The limited time allocated for fairy tale therapy in schools and 
clinical contexts often restricts its full potential. In this regard, 
the home environment is crucial to filling these gaps. Families, 
particularly  parents,  are  responsible  for  complementing  and 
reinforcing the learning provided at school or through clinical 
therapy.  By  engaging  children  in  regular  fairy  tale  reading 
activities  at  home,  parents  can  amplify  the  positive  effects 
of  therapy,  enrich  their  learning  experiences,  and  create 
an  environment  that  supports  comprehensive  cognitive, 
emotional,  and  social  development.  Collaboration  between 
home,  school,  and  clinical  therapy  is  essential  to  ensure 
continuity and maximise the impact of learning.
In  the  context  of  cognitive  development,  fairy  tales  in  family 
settings  focus  more  on  laying  the  foundation  for  early 
development.  They  informally  build  cognitive  basics,  such

narrative comprehension. This contrasts with the educational 
context,  where  fairy  tales  are  utilised  to  hone  higher-order 
and complex thinking skills, such as critical thinking, abstract 
concept understanding, executive functions, and logic. Thus, 
fairy tales in family settings serve as an informal foundation 
for  cognitive  development,  while  in  education,  they  target 
advanced  thinking  skills.  Together,  they  complement  each 
other in supporting a child’s comprehensive cognitive growth.
This  systematic  review  provides  evidence  that  the  family 
environment  also  plays  a  crucial  role  in  child  development, 
suggesting that interventions typically applied in schools and 
clinical practices, such as therapeutic fairy tales, should also 
be  implemented  at  home.  The  parent-child  relationship  has 
the greatest impact among the many relationships influencing 
a child’s development. Responsive parenting is a key factor in 
promoting early childhood development [54]. Across various 
countries, cultures, and contexts, caregiver support programs 
have  improved  short-term  Early  Childhood  Development 
(ECD) outcomes by fostering responsive parenting and age-
appropriate  caregiver-child  interactions  [55].  Recent  efforts 
to  extend  the  relational  health  model  into  the  field  of  child 
development  emphasise  the  roles  of  parents,  children,  and 
contextual  factors  in  supporting  and  maintaining  healthy 
parent-child relationships [56].

Conclusions

Beyond  clinical  and  educational  contexts,  family-based 
fairy  tale  interventions  are  vital  in  supporting  children’s 
holistic  development.  Families  can  complement  clinical 
practices  and  fairy  tale-based  learning  by  replicating 
practices such as shared reading at home and establishing 
reading routines. With active family involvement, fairy tale 
interventions in all contexts can profoundly impact holistic 
child development.
These  findings  guide  healthcare  and  therapy  practitioners, 
educators,  and  families  to  design  specific,  targeted,  and 
evidence-based fairy tale interventions. Collaboration among 
schools,  families,  and  clinical  professionals  is  also  crucial 
to maximising the benefits of fairy tales as a developmental 
intervention.  Adopting  approaches  tailored  to  the  child’s 
needs  and  environment,  fairy  tales  can  serve  as  a  dynamic 
and relevant tool to support their comprehensive growth.
