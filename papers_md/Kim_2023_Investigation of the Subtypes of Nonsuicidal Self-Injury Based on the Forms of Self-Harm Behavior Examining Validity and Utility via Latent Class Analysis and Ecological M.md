ABSTRACT

Background: This study aimed to empirically derive and validate subtypes of nonsuicidal self-
injury (NSSI) based on the forms of self-harm behavior.
Methods: Sixty young adults who exhibited repetitive NSSI completed a clinical interview 
and baseline measures, followed by a two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA). 
A latent class analysis was administered to identify NSSI subtypes based on the forms of 
self-harm behavior. The subtypes were then compared to baseline clinical and EMA variables, 
including emotions and urges to self-harm.
Results: The best-fitting model supported two subtypes: 1) substance abuse and suicide 
attempt subtype and 2) cutting and scratching subtype. The substance abuse and suicide 
attempt subtype reported a higher rate of engaging in lifetime suicide plans and suicide 
attempts and a higher number of lifetime suicide attempts. They also showed significantly 
higher severity of self-harm behavior, borderline personality traits, anger, posttraumatic 
symptoms, and difficulties in emotion regulation when compared to the cutting and 
scratching subtype. However, there was no inter-subtype difference in self-esteem. In the 
EMA data, anger toward others, feeling of rejection, loneliness, and helplessness were 
significantly high in the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype. The variability of 
anger toward others was also higher in this subtype compared to the cutting and scratching 
subtype. Finally, in the two-week research period, the substance abuse and suicide attempt 
group showed a higher rate of reported urges to self-harm with or without suicidal intent.
Conclusion: Findings support the validity of the subtypes based on the forms of self-harm 
behavior, suggesting the clinical utility of addressing heterogeneity within individuals 
exhibiting self-harm for assessment and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Self-harming behavior includes a wide range of behaviors that directly and deliberately 
harm one’s body. Among these behaviors, nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is the intentional 
damaging of body tissue without the intent to die.1 The prevalence of NSSI is nearly 6% in the 
general population.2 Even higher rates were found among college students and adolescents, 
with studies reporting 15% to over 35% NSSI prevalence in samples.3,4 Self-harm is a 
severe problem that not only causes physical damage but is also strongly associated with 
various mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, borderline 
personality disorder (BPD), and suicidality.5,6 Especially the high risk of suicide among 
individuals with NSSI stresses the importance of early screening for NSSI. Although they 
begin to engage in self-harming behaviors without serious suicidal intent, individuals who 
repetitively harm themselves experience desensitization to physical pain, increasing the risk 
of suicide.7,8 As large-scale prospective studies have demonstrated, individuals with NSSI 
show a 2 to 3 times higher risk of suicide ideation and suicide attempts compared to the 
general population.9 Furthermore, the rate of completed suicide was 37.2 times higher in 
individuals with NSSI than in the matched general population.10 There are also significant 
studies on the relationship between suicidality and NSSI in Korea. Research has shown 
that 57.4% of adolescents with a history of self-harm reported suicidal ideas.11 And in a 
retrospective chart review study on psychiatric patients with NSSI and/or suicide attempts, 
33.75% of the participants reported both NSSI and suicide attempts, 17.5% reported NSSI 
only, and 48.75% reported only suicide attempts.12 These findings indicate coexisting but 
distinguishable characteristics of NSSI and suicidality.

NSSI includes a wide range of behaviors such as cutting, scratching or carving one’s skin with 
a sharp object, hitting oneself, banging, burning, or substance abuse. As a high percentage of 
the population engages in NSSI and exhibits various self-harm behaviors, it seems necessary 
to pay attention to the heterogeneity within them and to provide differentiated interventions 
for specific subtypes. Forms of self-harm are explicit and comparably easy to assess via early 
interviews or self-report measures in clinical settings. This makes collecting information 
about them helpful in checking the characteristics of individuals exhibiting NSSI, including 
the lethality of their NSSI behaviors.

A few studies have demonstrated that the forms of NSSI are associated with psychological 
characteristics of individuals who engage in NSSI to help explain psychiatric heterogeneity 
in NSSI.5,13,14 Andover et al.5 identified differences in psychiatric symptoms among 
individuals with different NSSI methods. They reported that individuals who adopted skin 
cutting exhibited higher anxiety than those who engaged in other forms of NSSI. In their 
latent class analysis (LCA) study, Klonsky and Olino13 found that a preference for aggressive 
forms of NSSI, such as hitting oneself, was prevalent in one class, while a preference for 
other forms of NSSI, such as cutting, was prevalent in another class. They have also reported 
significant differences between groups of individuals with a preference for specific NSSI 
forms: individuals who used hitting as their NSSI method showed lower levels of depression 
in comparison to those who adopted other forms of NSSI. Similarly, Kleiman et al.14 focused 
on trait aggression and predicted that individuals who engage in hitting would be different 
from those who engage in other forms of NSSI methods, such as cutting. In their large 
sample, higher levels of trait aggression differentiated those who engaged in self-hitting 
from those who did not, and levels of trait aggression were also associated with the frequency 
of self-hitting. Given this small but growing body of research, it is suggested that different

factors are involved in different forms of NSSI. Unfortunately, previous research contained 
limitations in terms of ecological validity, as they are retrospective and mainly focused on 
limited numbers of self-harm behaviors and a few emotions such as aggression, depression, 
and anxiety. Therefore, more research is required to investigate the various forms of NSSI 
and the underlying factors (e.g., emotions, behaviors) influencing certain forms of NSSI with 
multifaceted measures.

In addition to the studies on the forms of NSSI, there is an increasing number of studies 
examining differences in self-harm behavior at the longitudinal level, not limited to 
retrospective cross-sectional methods such as interviews or self-reports. One of the early 
studies utilizing longitudinal assessment by Nock et al.15 investigated forms and functions of 
self-injurious thoughts and behaviors among adolescents and young adults via an ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA). A recent study that reviewed EMA research on NSSI16 has 
supported that research with intensive longitudinal data was distinguishable from the ones with 
cross-sectional data: the EMA studies had strength in investigating emotional and cognitive 
contexts of self-harm, self-harm motives, and temporal changes in psychological variables 
before and after self-harm behaviors. Furthermore, a few studies have predicted the proximal 
time of self-harm episodes based on emotional changes and devised preventive interventions 
for individuals exhibiting self-harm behaviors.17,18 Therefore, it would be even more meaningful 
to verify the validity of the subtype of individuals exhibiting self-harm, by comparing the 
differences in emotions and behaviors in daily life according to the differences in the subtypes.

This study had two primary objectives. First, we aimed to identify forms of self-harm-based 
NSSI subtypes using an empirical classification approach. We administered latent class 
analysis on the items of the Self-Harm Inventory (SHI),19 which is a widely used and broad 
measure for self-harm to identify subtypes of NSSI. Second, we aimed to examine the validity 
of the subtypes by using: 1) baseline measures of relevant clinical variables and 2) EMA 
measures of emotion and self-harm-related variables. We compared the subtypes based on 
self-harm behaviors and investigated cross-sectional differences in psychosocial constructs 
relevant to NSSI. Intensive longitudinal data from a two-week EMA were used to examine the 
differences between subtypes in daily life. The data included real-time reports of participants 
on emotion experience, emotion variability, and urges to self-harm in their natural 
environment. By adopting EMA, an ecologically valid and clinically informative method,20 
we expected to examine the extent to which the forms of self-harm-based subtypes were 
associated with significant differences in specific emotions. Based on the above analysis 
results, we propose an intervention method tailored to the characteristics of each subtype.

METHODS

Participants
The current study recruited adults aged 19 or older who repeatedly engaged in self-harm 
behavior within the last six months. All participants volunteered for this study and gave 
written informed consent after obtaining sufficient information regarding the study 
procedure. Individuals with developmental disorders, psychotic symptoms, and other 
neuropsychiatric disorders were excluded from participating in the study. Of the 65 
individuals who voluntarily applied for the study, five participants who exhibited suggested 
psychotic symptoms were excluded from participating in the study after structured clinical 
interviews. As a result, 60 individuals were included in the final sample.

Measures
Clinical interviews
1. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders Clinician Version (SCID-5-CV)
SCID-5-CV is a semi-structured interview that can be conducted by clinicians or trained 
mental health professionals, enabling systematic evaluation of major DSM-5 diagnoses. 
SCID-5-CV is a reliable and valid measure to diagnose mental disorders accurately.21 The 
Korean version of the SCID-5-CV, which was translated by Oh et al.,22 was adopted in the 
current study. We used questions in the SCID-5-CV to assess diagnoses, lifetime suicide 
planning, and suicide attempts in participants.

2. Suicide Attempt and Self-Injury Interview (SASII)
SASII is a structured interview developed by Linehan et al.,23 which comprehensively assesses 
factors related to self-harm behavior and suicide attempts. It intensively evaluates methods 
of suicide and self-harm, the lethality of the method, impulsiveness, suicidal intentions, 
and rescue possibilities and consequences of each self-harm behavior. In a review study,24 
SASII showed the highest reliability among the measures for suicide attempts and self-harm 
behavior. The current study used the Korean version of the SASII, which was translated by a 
group of researchers, including the two authors (S. K. & J-S. L.) of this study.

Self-report measures
1. SHI
The SHI was developed by Sansone, Wiederman, and Sansone19 to measure intentional self-
harm behavior. The Korean version of the SHI was validated by Kim, Woo, Koo, and Lee.25 It 
consists of 22 binary (Yes/No) questions on self-harm behaviors. A higher total score on the 
scale indicates engagement in many different self-harm behaviors. The internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α) was 0.76 in the Kim et al.25 and 0.70 in the current study.

2. Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ)
The BPAQ is a self-report measure of aggression developed by Buss and Perry.26 The scale 
consists of 29 items on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (extremely uncharacteristic of me) 
to 5 (extremely characteristic of me). The BPAQ has four empirically derived subscales: physical 
aggression, verbal aggression, anger, and hostility. We used the Korean version of the BPAQ 
validated by Lee,27 and the internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) was 0.89 in this study.

3. Personality Assessment Inventory-Borderline Features Scale (PAI-BOR)
The PAI-BOR is one of the 11 clinical scales of the Personality Assessment Inventory 
developed by Morey28 to evaluate adult personalities. It consists of 24 questions, including 
features of borderline personality disorder such as impulsivity/dyscontrol, mood instability, 
chronic emptiness, separation concerns, negative relations, and reckless spending. Items are 
rated on a 4-point Likert scale with items ranging from 0 (false) to 4 (very true). We used the 
Korean version of the PAI-BOR validated by Hong and Kim,29 and the internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α) for the present study was 0.90.

4. Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS)
The DERS is a 36-item measure that assesses difficulties in emotion regulation.30 Items 
are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5; 1 is almost never (0–10%), 2 is sometimes 
(11–35%), 3 is about half the time (36–65%), 4 is most of the time (66–90%), and 5 is almost 
always (91–100%). Higher total scores indicate greater emotion dysregulation. The Korean 
version of the DERS was validated by Cho,31 which consists of six subscales: impulse control

Subtypes of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

difficulties, lack of attention to and awareness of emotions, nonacceptance of emotions, 
lack of emotional clarity, limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and difficulties in 
engaging in goal-directed behavior, respectively. The present study’s internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α) was 0.92.

5. Impact of Event Scales-Revised (IES-R)
The IES-R was developed by Weiss and Marmar.32 They revised the IES,33 which was designed 
to measure symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder. The IES-R consists of 22 
items measuring intrusion, avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and numbness. The 
frequency of experienced symptoms over a period of a week is rated on a 5-point scale 
ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). We used the Korean version of the IES-R validated 
by Lim et al.34 The current study’s internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) was 0.91.

6. EMA
Based on previous studies on self-harm and suicide (e.g., Nock et al.15), we devised questions 
on emotions, thoughts, and urges related to self-harm and suicide. Participants were asked to 
respond to each question according to their experiences in their daily lives. The participants 
were given an ID and password and submitted their answers on a secured research web app 
via their smartphones. They were asked to mark their experienced emotion since the last 
online survey on their visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very much). 
In addition, participants reported their thoughts, urges, and behaviors related to self-harm 
and suicide since the last online survey.

Procedures
Participants were recruited by posting recruitment advertisements on Social Networking 
Services (SNS) (KakaoTalk, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), online communities 
at universities, online cafes, and suicide prevention-related organizations. Those who 
volunteered for the study were contacted by a research assistant to check their history of 
repetitive self-harm. All participants were provided with sufficient information on the entire 
research procedure and signed a written consent form before their participation. In addition, 
participants accessed an encrypted web app using a personal ID and password to complete 
a packet of self-report measures, which took approximately 30 minutes and scheduled a 
structured interview. Clinical psychologists with a master’s degree or a Ph.D. conducted a 
structured interview using SCID-5-CV and SASII and gave a brief education on EMA. From 
the day after the interview, participants received text messages four times a day (10 a.m., 2 
p.m., 6 p.m., and 10 p.m.) for 14 days and accessed an encrypted research web app to provide 
responses. In order to increase compliance, additional encouraging text messages were sent 
within 30 minutes of receiving the first text notification. Each online survey took an average 
of 2 minutes (ranging from less than 1 minute to 4 minutes, according to their experiences). 
Participants were fully debriefed and received pro-rata monetary compensation.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses and subtype difference analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS, version 
25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). To test group differences t-test was used for continuous 
variables, and χ2 test was applied for categorical variables. LCA was performed using Mplus 
version 7.35 LCA was used to discriminate homogeneous subtypes of NSSI based on their 
self-harm behavior. The LCA model included 21 dichotomous indicator variables, which 
were items of the SHI. The last item of the SHI (item 22. abused laxatives to hurt yourself ) 
was excluded from the LCA since no participant endorsed it. These items reflected whether

the participant had ever engaged in different forms of self-harm behavior. A step-by-step 
model class enumeration process was used. In each step, the number of the latent classes was 
increased by one. Better fitting models were those with relatively lower values for the Akaike 
Information Criterion (AIC),36 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),37 and Sample Size 
Adjusted Bayesian Information Criterion (SABIC).38 In addition, a significant Bootstrapped 
Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT)39 implied that a particular k-class model showed a more 
optimal model fit than the previous k-1-class solution. Item endorsement probabilities helped 
with labeling latent classes. Entropy was used to inform classification accuracy.

After class enumeration, the association between latent classes and external variables was 
examined. Subtype differences were examined in terms of age, gender, level of education, 
histories related to self-harm, psychotherapy, and medication. Furthermore, subtypes 
contrasted in clinical variables, including self-esteem, borderline personality features, 
aggression, posttraumatic symptoms, and difficulties in emotion regulation on self-report 
measures. Lastly, means and variabilities of emotions and urges to self-harm in daily life 
collected by EMA were also used to contrast the subtypes. Cohen’s d was used as an effect size 
measure for subtype differences.

Ethics statement
All the procedures of this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Kangwon National University (KWNUIRB-2019-11-001-006). Informed consent was 
submitted by all participants before their participation.

RESULTS

Demographic characteristics
The mean age of the participants was 22.47 years (standard deviation [SD] = 3.35), ranging 
from a minimum of 19 years to a maximum of 36 years. Majority of the participants were 
female (n = 56, 93.3%). Among the participants, thirty-four (56.7%) were undergraduate 
students, nine (15%) were unemployed, four (6.7%) were part-time workers, four (6.7%) were 
graduate students, and four (6.7%) had other occupations. Clinical interviews via the SCID-
5-CV showed that the mean number of psychiatric diagnoses was 2.57 (SD = 1.35). In terms of 
primary diagnosis, 49 participants were diagnosed with depressive disorders, which accounted 
for the highest percentage (81.67%): 27 had major depressive disorders, 14 had persistent 
depressive disorders, and eight had premenstrual dysphoric disorders. It was followed by 16 
(26.67%) individuals with social anxiety disorders, 15 (25%) with trauma and stress-related 
disorders, including nine individuals with posttraumatic stress disorders, and six individuals 
with other specified trauma- and stress-related disorders. In addition, a total of 14 individuals 
(23.33%) had bipolar disorders, including four individuals with bipolar I disorder, nine people 
with bipolar II disorder, and one with unspecified bipolar and related disorder. For detailed 
information on the demographic characteristics of the participants (Table 1).

Latent class analysis on the forms of self-harm behaviors
In order to determine the number of latent classes based on the SHI, the indices calculated 
by latent class analyses were examined. Table 2 displays fit indices for models with different 
numbers of latent classes. Models with two to four latent classes were estimated. The two-
class solution showed the lowest values of AIC,36 BIC,37 SABIC,38 and BLRT.39 Furthermore,

Subtypes of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

The two identified classes were labeled as substance abuse and suicide attempt (Class 1; 
n = 30; 50%) and cutting and scratching (Class 2; n = 30; 50%) subtypes, and the classes 
significantly differed regarding indicator variables on the SHI items (Fig. 1). The identified 
latent classes showed quantitative differences or severity-based differences in self-harm 
behaviors as well as qualitative differences that reflected different subtypes of self-harm. 
The substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype exhibited higher scores in overall items 
except item 8 (item 8. Scratching your body deliberately) when compared to the cutting and 
scratching subtype. Inter-class differences were observed in the items on drug abuse, suicide 
attempt, and setting oneself in non-rewarding circumstances (item 1. Overdosed, item 12. Set 
yourself up in a relationship to be rejected, item 13. Abused prescription medicine, and item 
18. Attempted suicide). For these items, the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype 
showed significantly higher endorsement than the other subtype (endorsement rate of 
class 1–class 2 > 0.60). The cutting and scratching subtype was characterized by high scores 
in items 2, 4, 8, 20, and 21 (item 2. Cut yourself on purpose, item 4. Hit yourself, item 8. 
Scratched yourself on purpose, item 20. Tortured yourself with self-defeating thoughts, and 
item 21. Starved yourself to hurt yourself ). The substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype 
showed the highest endorsement rates in items 1, 2, 18, and 20 (item 1. Overdosed, item 2. 
Cut yourself on purpose, item 18. Attempted suicide, and item 20. Tortured yourself with self-
defeating thoughts). Both subtypes showed a simultaneous rising in items 2, 8, and 20 (item 
2. Cut yourself on purpose, item 8. Scratched yourself on purpose, and item 20. Tortured 
yourself with self-defeating thoughts).

Subtypes of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

Differences between subtypes of demographic data and self-reported measures
Subtype differences were investigated in demographic data such as age, gender, level of 
education, and psychiatric histories, including self-harm-related histories such as the onset age 
of suicidal plan/attempt, number of uploads of self-harm and suicide experiences on the internet 
and/or SNS, number of self-harms in the previous year, lifetime suicide plans and suicide 
attempts, lifetime number of suicide attempts and histories of psychotherapy and medication 
(Table 3). Results demonstrated no subtype differences in age, gender, or level of education, all P 
> 0.05. Among the psychiatric histories, lifetime suicide plans and attempts, lifetime number of 
suicide attempts, the number of diagnoses and medication history were significantly different. 
The substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype engaged in lifetime suicide plans and attempts 
more frequently (χ2 = 11.43, P = 0.003) and reported higher numbers of lifetime suicide attempts 
(t = 2.90, P = 0.005). They also showed a higher number of diagnoses (t = 3.27, P = 0.002), and 
higher endorsement in medication history (χ2 = 9.32, P = 0.002).

In terms of self-report measures, t-tests were conducted to find inter-subtype differences in 
self-esteem, borderline personality characteristics, aggression, posttraumatic symptoms, 
and difficulties in emotion regulation. Results showed that mean scores of the substance 
abuse and suicide attempt subtype were significantly higher than those of the cutting and 
scratching subtype in terms of borderline personality characteristics (t = 3.64, P = 0.001), 
aggression (t = 3.07, P = 0.003), posttraumatic symptoms (t = 2.91, P = 0.005), and difficulties 
in emotion regulation (t = 2.05, P = 0.045). No significant difference in self-esteem was 
identified between the two subtypes (t = −0.60, P = 0.55) (Table 4).

Differences in emotions and urges to self-harm in daily life
Emotion experiences and emotion variabilities in daily life
In order to investigate the differences in emotion experiences and emotion variabilities in 
daily life, inter-subtype differences in EMA data on discrete emotions were compared via 
t-tests. Scores of emotions at each time point in the EMA during the two-week period were 
averaged to calculate the means of the emotions, and the variances were also calculated to 
investigate the variability of the emotions for each subtype.

Results of the t-tests on the mean level of emotion experiences in EMA demonstrated that 
the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype showed significantly higher scores in anger 
toward others (t = 2.22, P = 0.031), feeling of rejection (t = 4.06, P < 0.001), loneliness (t = 2.85, 
P = 0.006), and helplessness (t = 2.10, P = 0.042) when compared to the cutting and scratching 
subtype. There were no significant differences in other items, all P > 0.05 (Table 5).

Further, to examine the inter-subtype differences in the variabilities of emotions, t-tests 
were conducted. Results showed a significant difference in anger toward others (t = 2.04, P 
= 0.046, d = 0.54), which indicated that the degree of changes in anger toward others was 
greater in the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype than that of the cutting and 
scratching subtype. There were no significant differences in other items, all P > 0.05.

Urges to self-harm in daily life
The difference between the two subtypes in the presence of urges to self-harm with or 
without suicidal intent for a two-week EMA period was investigated via cross-analysis. Of the 
total sample, four individuals who did not respond to the question were excluded, and data

from the remaining 56 individuals were analyzed. More than half of the participants reported 
having the urge to self-harm at least once during the two-week EMA period (n = 29, 51.8%). 
Results of the cross-analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the frequency 
of urges to self-harm between the two groups (χ2 = 7.212, P = 0.007): Among the total of 
27 individuals in the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype, approximately 70% of 
the individuals reported the urge to self-harm (n = 19, 70.4%), while only 34.5% of the 29 
individuals in the cutting and scratching subtype reported urges in the same two-week EMA 
period (n = 10, 34.5%). The results indicate that the individuals in the substance abuse and 
suicide attempt subtype were more likely to develop the urge to self-harm compared to the 
cutting and scratching subtype in their everyday lives (Table 6).

DISCUSSION

The current study identified subtypes of NSSI based on the forms of self-harm behavior in 
the Korean community adult sample and provided evidence of their validity using baseline 
psychological variables in self-reports and naturalistic data on emotion experience, emotion 
variability, and the urge to self-harm via EMA. The LCA yielded two subtypes: substance abuse and 
suicide attempt subtype and cutting and scratching subtype. The first subtype was characterized by 
more severe symptoms in overall self-harm behaviors, and especially substance abuse, relational 
problems, and suicide attempts were highly reported among them. In contrast, the second subtype 
showed lower probabilities in endorsements of self-harm behaviors and mainly endorsed cutting 
and scratching. The two subtypes were significantly different in their psychiatric history, clinical 
variables in self-report measures, and everyday emotions and urge to self-harm in EMA.

Previous literature has categorized self-harm behavior in accordance with the severity of their 
forms. Mild forms of self-harm include hitting oneself, picking one’s wounds, and banging, 
while moderate/severe forms of self-harm consist of cutting, carving one’s skin, burning, 
and substance abuse.40 Both subtypes provided by the LCA in the current study were mainly 
endorsed in moderate/severe forms of self-harm rather than mild forms. This finding might 
be relevant to the characteristics of our sample, which were young adults in the community. 
Compared to early adolescents who start to engage in NSSI, adults have a higher possibility 
of having a long history of NSSI engagement and adaptation to more severe methods.13,41 
Considering the early onset age of self-harm identified within our sample (mean age, 15. 92 ± 
4.04 years), the self-harm methods of participants may have evolved into more serious forms 
over time. In addition to the general characteristics of our sample, there were significant 
differences between subtypes. The substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype showed a 
higher probability of endorsing a broad range of self-harm behaviors and was characterized 
by more severe methods, including substance abuse and suicide attempts. These results 
correspond with previous findings, which state that individuals who use various and more 
severe self-harm methods tend to show a higher risk of suicide attempts.13

Subtypes of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

At the item level, the most evident differences between the two subtypes were found in 
items 1, 10, 12, 13, and 18 (item 1. Overdose, item 10. Making medical situations worse 
on purpose, item 12. Setting oneself up in a relationship to be rejected, item 13. Abused 
prescription medication, and item 18. Attempted suicide). The substance abuse and suicide 
attempt subtype showed more lethal self-harm behaviors, which could lead to irreversible 
consequences such as substance abuse, injuring oneself, and ultimately, suicide attempts. 
In addition, they tend to use passive coping behaviors and maladaptive interpersonal 
behaviors (e.g., setting themselves in a relationship to be rejected, preventing wounds from 
healing, and making medical situations worse on purpose). These features may reflect 
complex problems in personality and deficits in coping resources underlying self-harm in the 
substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype.

Significant differences in psychiatric history, self-report measures, and EMA data supported 
the differences between the two subtypes. First, in psychiatric history, the substance 
abuse and suicide attempt subtype showed a higher endorsement of lifetime suicide plans 
and suicide attempts and a higher number of lifetime suicide attempts. These results 
supported the findings from the LCA on the SHI in this study that a higher risk of suicide 
can characterize the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype. Moreover, this subtype 
demonstrated a higher number of diagnoses and higher endorsement of medication history 
than the cutting and scratching subtype. These findings suggest that the substance abuse 
and suicide attempt subtype tend to have more comorbid disorders other than self-harm 
itself, which means that they may have more complicated psychological problems and are 
more likely to visit clinical settings where medication is available. It not only shows their 
severity of impairment but also supplies a clinical implication in the treatment. Considering 
the high endorsement of overdose and abuse of prescription medication of this subtype, it 
is suggested that clinicians pay more attention to guiding and monitoring the medication of 
their patients who exhibit self-harming behaviors.

Second, the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype also showed significantly higher 
scores on the majority of psychological measures: scales on the borderline personality 
trait, anger, posttraumatic symptoms, and difficulties in emotion regulation, except for 
one measure on self-esteem. As supposed by the data on psychiatric history, the substance 
abuse and suicide attempt subtype had more serious personality problems, psychological 
symptoms, and difficulties in emotion regulation. However, the finding that the two 
subtypes did not differ in self-esteem was unexpected, as negative self-cognition is one of 
the cardinal risk factors of self-harm.42,43 Our conjecture is that this finding might be related 
to the fact that both subtypes share common characteristics as self-harm subtypes. Since 
negative self-cognition is pervasive among individuals who exhibit self-harm, all participants 
in our study who engaged in repetitive self-harm behaviors have reported low levels of self-
esteem. Furthermore, it could be due to the limitation of the measure on general self-esteem. 
Previous research on self-cognition has examined more specific constructs such as self-
criticism, self-disgust, or self-punishment.43-45 Therefore, it would be meaningful to examine 
the subtype differences in those self-related constructs in future research.

Lastly, the two subtypes were different in their experiences of emotion and the urge to self-
harm in daily life. On the mean level of the emotion experience in EMA data, the substance 
abuse and suicide attempt subtype showed higher scores in anger toward others, feeling of 
rejection, loneliness, and hopelessness, than the other subtype. On emotion variability, a 
significant subtype difference was observed only in anger toward others. Other emotions,

Subtypes of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury

such as depression, anxiety, anger toward oneself, self-disgust, emotional numbness, 
sadness, emptiness, and guilt did not differ between the two subtypes. These results reported 
that neurotic emotions such as depression, anxiety, and negative emotions toward oneself 
did not show significant inter-subtype differences, while anger toward others, loneliness, 
and feeling of rejection was higher in the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype, 
suggesting that they may have insecure and negative interpersonal perception. Also, the 
fact that their hopelessness was higher might be related to the chronicity of experienced 
problems and lack of coping resources.46 Furthermore, in the two-week real-time tracking of 
urges to self-harm in daily life, the substance abuse and suicide attempt subtype reported a 
significantly higher probability of urges to self-harm, which was almost double the number 
than in the cutting and scratching subtype, which strongly implies that their emotional 
vulnerabilities increase the risk of self-harming behaviors via the urge to self-harm.

In conclusion, it is suggested that forms of self-harm behavior can identify subtypes 
of NSSI, and individuals with more severe symptoms are characterized by more severe 
psychological symptoms, difficulties in emotion regulation, and unstable interpersonal 
relationships. Previous research found that individuals who engage in self-harm while 
also having borderline personality disorder were distinctive from those without borderline 
personality disorder.41,47,48 Individuals with borderline personality disorder present a 
variety of symptoms which include identity disturbance, unstable and intense interpersonal 
relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, 
impulsivity, affective instability, chronic emptiness, inappropriate and intense anger, and 
frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.49 They show pervasive patterns 
of these problems, making interventions for borderline personality disorder difficult. 
Corresponding with the suggestions from previous research, which stated that differentiated 
approaches should be given to self-harm groups with and without borderline personality 
traits,47,50 the results of this study support the need to assess personality traits and problems 
in coping skills and to provide specialized interventions for each subtype of self-harm. 
Furthermore, intensive behavioral and cognitive interventions for emotion regulation are 
required to prevent lethal self-harm behaviors for each subtype.

This study contributes to the literature as it examines the ecological difference between the 
two subtypes in daily life by analyzing intensive longitudinal data obtained via EMA as well as 
conducting self-report measures and clinical interviews. It was particularly meaningful that the 
two subtypes were identified based on a broad range of direct and indirect self-harm behaviors, 
and the validity of the subtypes was confirmed with both real-time and retrospective data.

There are also some limitations to note in this study. We had a small sample size, and the 
majority of our participants were females in their twenties. We welcome future research to 
examine the subtypes of self-harm that we found in the study with a larger sample, including 
males who engage in self-harm and recruit clinical and community samples to increase the 
generalizability of these research findings.
