Abstract
Background:  Coping  is  essential  to  manage  palliative  care  professionals’  challenges.  The  focus  has  been  on  the  effects  of  coping 
mechanism; however, little is known about coping itself in palliative care.
Aim: To synthesise evidence of coping strategies in palliative care professionals, and how different strategies play roles over time.
Design: Systematically conducted integrative review.
Data sources: PubMed; CINAHL; Medline; PsycINFO and B-ON were searched (1996–2021) combining ‘coping’ AND ‘palliative care’. A 
predefined data extraction sheet was developed to report data. Two researchers performed constant comparative analysis using Nvivo®.
Results: Thirty-one studies were included. Four main strategies with recurrent reference to time were found: (a) proactive coping, 
involving activities to achieve self-confidence and control situations and emotions; (b) self-care based coping, including self-protection 
and self-awareness activities, with behavioural disconnection; (c) self-transformation coping, involving activities to accept limits; and 
(d) encountering deep professional meaning, is a coping mechanism based on meaning, frequently considering the deepest meaning 
of work. The dynamic and influencing factors were training, team interaction, professional motivation and family. They were usually 
protective factors, though sometimes they represented risk factors. The emotional burden associated with healthcare and systemic 
stressors were always risk factors. An explanatory model describes a complex and dynamic process, in which everyday strategies and 
more introspective strategies are combined.
Conclusions: The model showed a process of adaptation and learning to persevere in palliative care. It changes over time under factors 
and strategies, and evolves in a personal and professional transformation, parallel to the working life. It would be worth assessing coping 
in healthcare professionals who chose to leave palliative care and to investigate the reasons they did so and their coping mechanisms.

What is already known about the topic?

••

Coping is essential to manage the challenges that palliative care professionals face in their daily clinical work and most 
well-known explanations focus on emotion or problem-based coping.

•• Many of the studies about coping tend to focus on its effect and consequences.
••

The last review about coping in palliative1 care used a dichotomous approach for influential factors (risk or protective), 
professional and personal strategies.

What this paper adds?

Palliative Medicine 36(1)

••

Coping can include a variety of strategies from proactive coping, self-care based coping, self-transforming coping and 
encountering deep professional meaning.
Specific training, healthcare team, professional motivation and family were found to be sometimes protective and other 
times risk factors. Emotional burden and the systemic or administrative factors always appear as risk factors.
Throughout a dynamic adaptation and learning process over time, coping strategies and influencing factors become 
intertwined; impacting on professional and personal development throughout the career.

Implications for practice, theory or policy

••

••

Palliative care professionals coping strategies evolve and change, being intrinsically related to a progressive and greater 
response capacity with respect to emotionally demanding situations.
Coping mechanisms in palliative care imply a personal and professional development, extending beyond the manage-
ment of emotions and problems, or the separation between personal and environment aspects.
The  professional  development  is  a  central  pillar  in  training  on  providing  healthcare  to  others  and  can  be  promoted 
through training self-awareness.
The coping process seemed to be linked to the development of professional careers in palliative care.

Background

Working with individuals approaching the end of life can 
be  a  personal  and  professional  challenge.2  Healthcare 
professionals  are  required  to  develop  coping  strategies. 
Coping is defined as the set of cognitive and behavioural 
strategies developed by individuals to face internal and/or 
external  demands  of  the  relationship  between  the  indi-
viduals  and  the  environment.3,4  Individuals  make  a  first 
assessment of the potential stressors and, if they consider 
them stressful, a second assessment is performed in order 
to consider what they can do.3

Folkman et al.3and Antoniazzi et al5 proposed a trans-
actional  coping  model  based  on  coping  mechanisms 
focused on the problems and emotions, with an emphasis 
on  both  processes  and  personality  traits.  In  this  model, 
the individuals make an effort to change their emotional 
states associated with stress, and try to perform activities 
to confront the situation that generated stress so that it 
can  be  overcome.3,5  Thus,  emotion-focused  coping  can 
facilitate  problem-based  coping  by  reducing  emotional 
stress,  and,  conversely,  problem  management  can 
decrease emotional stress.

This first proposal has evolved. Antoniazzi et al5 recog-
nised  that  other  authors  added  coping  mechanisms 
focused on interpersonal relationships, in which the indi-
viduals  seek  the  support  of  others  in  their  social  circle. 
Even Park and Folkman6 added meaning-based coping to 
the transactional coping model. These authors suggested 
that, when faced with possible stressful events, the indi-
viduals make an assessment of the meaning of the situa-
tion, and the congruence or not with their own beliefs and 
purposes  (global  meaning).  Subsequently,  they  apply  a 
coping strategy focused on the meaning to relieve stress.6
Vachon1 has made important contributions in the field 
of  coping  strategies  and  palliative  care.  This  author 

performed  a  literature  review  and  described  the  coping 
mechanisms of palliative care professionals as being per-
sonal coping strategies (e.g. physical activity) or organisa-
(e.g.  regular  meetings). 
tional  coping  mechanisms 
Likewise, Vachon enunciated a list of stressors, grouping 
them into environmental (e.g. work role) or personal (e.g. 
personality). This personal or organisational grouping fits 
in  with  the  person-environment  model  that  this  author 
used.7,8  This  model  affirms  that  there  is  occupational 
stress when there is imbalance between the profession-
als’  resources/demands  and  the  demands/resources  of 
the  work  environment.7,8  In  the  literature,  many  factors 
have been determined as stressors for palliative care pro-
fessionals.  Frequent  exposure  to  death,  lack  of  time, 
heavy  workloads  and  communication  difficulties  have 
been  mentioned.9  The  ineffectiveness  of  coping  mecha-
nisms and a possible feeling of helplessness arising from 
emotional  responses  that  include  pain,  depression  and 
guilt, uncertainty and the awareness of not being able to 
offer a cure have also been mentioned.9

Despite the mentioned stressors, comparative studies 
that assessed palliative care professionals and those from 
other healthcare areas have observed low levels of stress 
or burnout in the former.1,2,10–13 It may seem that, in com-
parison,  palliative  care  professionals  do  not  have  large 
burnout problems. However, some studies have indicated 
that between 24% and 38% of palliative care physicians in 
different countries suffered from burnout,13–16 which is a 
warning sign.15 In recent years, the focus has been on the 
results or effects of coping mechanisms; however, little is 
known about coping itself, and less about coping mecha-
nisms  in  palliative  care  professionals.  There  have  been 
changes  in  the  field  of  palliative  care.  It  has  spread  and 
obtained  certain  acknowledgment  as  a  field.  It  is  worth 
mentioning that there are physicians and nurses with sig-
nificant professional experience. Understanding how the

coping  mechanisms  of  these  professionals’  function  can 
help  promote  initiatives  to  encourage  or  teach  coping 
strategies. It is necessary to update the state of the evi-
dence from that approach of personal and organisational 
coping strategies,1 and to consider the possible evolution 
of  coping  strategies  throughout  the  professional  health-
care  provided  to  patients  with  advanced  or  terminal  ill-
nesses; carried out by palliative care professionals during 
their professional careers. The aim was to synthesise evi-
dence of coping strategies in palliative care professionals, 
and how different strategies play roles over time.

Primary objective

The main objective of the present study was to assess the sci-
entific evidence about coping mechanisms of physicians and 
nurses in palliative care, in order to understand the different 
coping strategies used by healthcare providers when caring 
for patients with advanced diseases or at the end of life.

Secondary objectives

The secondary objectives were to determine the factors 
that  influence  these  healthcare  professionals’  coping 
mechanisms,  and  characterise  the  possible  evolution  of 
coping strategies, over time and in each professional.

Design

The  present  study  is  an  integrative  review  conducted 
according  to  the  method  proposed  by  Whittemore  and 
Knafl17 This type of review is the broadest type of research 
review method as allows including experimental and non-
experimental research to understand more fully a particu-
lar  phenomenon.  It  makes  it  possible  to  include  diverse 
methodologies  and  varied  perspectives  on  a  topic.  It 
allows  integrating  quantitative,  qualitative  and  mixed-
method designs. The integration was conducted consider-
ing  current  recommendations18  that  will  be  explained 
throughout the integrative review phases.17

developed,  or  how  they  evolved  when  dealing  with 
demanding clinical situations. Therefore, these four litera-
ture  review  questions  arise:  (1)  How  do  palliative  care 
physicians  and  nurses  cope  with  emotional,  existential, 
and/or  spiritual  demands,  when  caring  for  end-of-life 
patients?;  (2)  What  factors  influence  this  coping  pro-
cesses, in a negative or positive sense?; (3) What coping 
strategies do these palliative care professionals use? and 
(4) How do these strategies evolve? Understanding coping 
mechanisms and strategies involved will promote a better 
understanding  of  how  coping  skills  are  developed.  The 
questions  required  combining  qualitative  and  quantita-
tive evidence.18

Literature search

The  search  in  the  scientific  literature  was  systematically 
conducted 
in  CINAHL,  Medline,  PubMed,  PsycINFO/
EBSCO and B-ON databases. The search strategy was com-
pleted  following  the  iterative  approach  proposed  by 
Zwakman  et  al.19  Pearl  growing  and  reference  tracking 
were performed. Vachon’s1 work was considered a ‘pearl’, 
and those publications that cited it were reviewed.

Two keywords were combined with Boolean operators: 
‘Coping’ AND ‘Palliative Care’, in titles and abstracts. Medical 
subject headings (MeSH) terms were not used. Thus, there 
was a more inclusive and objective-oriented approach. For 
example,  ‘coping’  as  a  MeSH  term  includes  concepts  not 
related to the subject of study (e.g. chemical coping in ath-
letes) (Supplemental Appendix 1). The search was narrowed 
(Table 1) and limited from January 1996 to September 2019, 
based  on  the  bibliographic  review  conducted  by  Vachon.1 
This  search  was  updated  up  to  1  June  2021,  following 
reviewers’ suggestion. The same string equation was used 
but adding not Covid-19, as the focus of the review was on 
palliative care professionals’ coping during normal working 
life. The articles considered were those published in English, 
Spanish  or  Portuguese  (Table  1).  All  the  references  of  the 
articles included in the review were also assessed, tracking 
the references backwards and forwards (citation tracking).

Identification of the problem

Selection criteria

It is common to talk about stressors and coping strategies, 
but  little  is  known  about  how  they  are  integrated  and 

The inclusion criteria were: (1) Studies that described the 
coping  of  physicians  and/or  nurses  within  the  palliative 

18

care context; (2) Projects carried out in any type of pallia-
tive  care  services  (home,  hospital  and  support);  and  (3) 
Studies with any type of methodological design (quantita-
tive, qualitative or mixed).

Studies with the following features were excluded: (1) 
Studies focused on health professionals such as psycholo-
gists  or  other  health  professionals.  Psychologists  have  a 
training process that enables them in a particular way for 
professional coping strategies; other professionals are not 
so exposed; (2) Validation studies of scales or other instru-
ments  for  measuring  coping  and/or  professional  stress; 
and  (3)  Studies  focused  on  coping  mechanisms  of  chil-
dren, patients, relatives or students.

The  article  eligibility  stage  was  carried  out  indepen-
dently  by  two  researchers  focusing  on  the  titles  and 
abstracts according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. As 
mentioned in the introduction, there was an emphasis on 
studying  the  ‘final  result  of  coping’,  such  as  burnout  or 
stress levels. Therefore, if the central subject of the stud-
ies were ‘stress’ or ‘burnout’, they were excluded, unless 
the topics ‘coping’ or ‘coping strategies’ were present in 
the results and in the discussions. In addition, the system-
atic  literature  review20  and  two  theoretical  reviews21,22 
identified were excluded. Their reference list was checked 
to identify potential new articles to add. However, none 
was  added  as  the  articles  were  already  included  in  the 
review or; were too old or did not fulfil inclusion criteria.

Data quality assessment

Based  on  Whittemore  and  Knafl’s17  argument  quality 
appraisal of included evidence was not considered essen-
tial.  Structured  data  extraction  allowed  having  a  quality 
idea. No study was eliminated based on its quality.

Data analysis

A data extraction sheet was developed taking into account 
the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research 
(COREQ),23  as  among  the  included  articles  there  were 
more with qualitative design. The guideline was modified 
to systematically extract data for all types of study designs. 
For example, at the ‘study design’ domain; the theoretical 
framework  was  registered  and  if  there  was  one  coping 
framework  that  shaped  the  study  it  was  registered  too. 
Likewise,  within  the  subdimension  of  data  collection,  if 
the  study  was  quantitative  or  mixed-method  it  was 
extracted and registered the type of tool used. The data 
extraction sheet included the following sections: journal, 
country, year, title, objectives, design, research team and 
reflexivity,  coping  framework,  context,  participants  and 
samplings,  data  collection/instruments,  analysis  (type, 
validation  and  rigor),  results  (positive  or  negative  influ-
encing factors, coping strategies and their evolution) and 
conclusions. The sheet promoted to systematically extract 
the  data.  The  data  were  recorded  in  Microsoft  Excel®. 

Verbatim citations, as well as the most descriptive and the 
most  interpretive  results  were  considered  data.  One 
researcher performed the data extraction, consulting the 
second researcher in case of doubts.

The  NVivo12®  software  was  used  to  organise  and 
manage  the  data  from  the  original  studies.  A  constant 
comparative  analysis  was  performed,  comparing  and 
categorising  the  data,  through  abductive  reasoning24 
(inductive  and explanatory or interpretive). This  proce-
dure allowed the development of more abstract themes 
and  theoretical  categories  that  described  latent  pat-
terns.25–27 Two researchers independently reviewed the 
codes  and  discussed  code  regrouping  until  consensus 
was reached. A data-based convergent synthesis design 
was  used  to  integrate  qualitative  and  quantitative  evi-
dence.18,28 In the case of quantitative studies, we consid-
ered  the  ideas  and  interpretations  of  the  reported 
results.  These  were  integrated  through  the  analysis  on 
the  categories  that  make  sense.  The  review  results  are 
presented together. The quantitative data was reported 
specifying  if  the  relationships  were  or  not  statistically 
significant; as shown in the results section. The catego-
ries  were  added  by  hierarchical  classification  with  an 
organised  conceptual  structure,  thus  answering  the 
research  questions  and  meeting  the  objectives  of  the 
present study, discriminating the factors that influenced 
the coping processes and strategies that physicians and 
nurses had developed.

Data presentation

The  data  were  presented  through  the  PRISMA29  flow 
chart,  a  summary  of  the  studies  included  in  the  review, 
and  representative  figures  of  the  results  obtained  by 
inductive analysis.

Results

Thirty-one articles were finally selected (Figure 1).

Characteristics of the studies

The studies selected had been conducted in: United States 
(n = 7);  Canada  (n = 4);  United  Kingdom  (n = 4);  Australia 
(n = 2);  Spain  (n = 3);  and  Portugal  (n = 2).  Brazil,  China, 
India, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, 
South Africa, Malaysia, The Netherlands and Taiwan had 
one article. The number of publications, except for 2015, 
was distributed almost evenly over the years.

Of  the  31  articles,  16  used  qualitative  methodology. 
Nine  articles  used  generic  qualitative  designs,30–38  five 
used  grounded  theory,39–43  one  phenomenology,44  and 
the  last  one  ethnography.45  On  the  other  hand,  eleven 
studies were quantitative (descriptive and/or correlation 
studies),13,46–55, four used mixed methodology (quantita-
tive and qualitative).11,12,56,57

Most studies had been conducted exclusively in pallia-
tive care/hospice services (n = 20).2,13,30,32–39,42–46,48–50,53–57 
One in a hospital,51 two specifically in hospital oncology 
services,40,52 and one with nurses who had provided care 
to end-of-life patients; though without specifying the ser-
vices.34 There were four studies that compared palliative 
care services with other services such as emergencies,11,12 
haematology and oncology40,52 (Table 2).

Coping strategies of health professionals in 
palliative care

Healthcare professionals use a diversity of proactive and 
thoughtful  activities,  in  order  to  meet  the  challenges 
posed by the process of providing care to others. Activities 
occur  sequentially  and  evolve  in  a  complex  manner. 
Studies  have  indicated  that  ‘time’  and  ‘experience’  had 
been  recurrently  mentioned.  Inductive  and  interpretive 

analyses indicated coping strategies, understood as a set 
of varied activities that tend to be used in the same way, 
and  configure  styles  of  action  in  the  face  of  challenges. 
These styles are not watertight compartments. Healthcare 
professionals combine them according to their needs and 
evolution in the face of challenges. The coping strategies 
observed were: (a) Proactive coping (doing things proac-
tively); (b) Self-care based coping (taking care of oneself); 
(c)  Self-transformation  coping  (adaptation);  and  (d) 
Encountering  deep  professional  meaning  (experiencing 
the deep meaning of their work).

Proactive coping

is  action-oriented  coping. 

This  modality 
It  groups 
together the set of activities in which the professionals 
adopt  ‘behaviours’  based  on  facing  the  situations  in  a 
proactive  manner.  It  is  characterised  by  the  search  for

self-confidence, and control of the situations and one’s 
own emotions, in order to face the problems as well as 
possible.  It  includes  three  main  types  of  activities  in 
which healthcare professionals: (a) bear a responsibility 
towards  themselves,  their  patients,  and  families  as  an 
active  coping  strategy21,30,38,44,45,49,51,53;(b)  plan  and 
organise their work, so that they can gain self-confidence 
and focus on it 13,21,32,34,40,42,49,51,53,56; and (c) manage the 
situations  by  controlling  aspects  related  to  their  prac-
tice, themselves, and their emotions.21,30,41,43,45,48,51,53

Self-care based coping

This  coping  mechanism  is  awareness  that  considers  the 
protection itself. Healthcare professionals frequently use 
intentional  strategies  to  protect  themselves,  repeating 
activities  that  are  progressively  developed.  These  main 
activities are developed at three levels. At the first level, 
the professionals promote self-knowledge,20,38,39,43,54 try-
ing to know themselves better, thus promoting an eman-
cipator/liberating reflection.11,20,32,36,39,43–45 At the second 
level,  they  perform  self-care  activities,  disconnect  from 
work, and use their free time to rest and perform hobbies 
and activities to ‘nourish’ themselves. Healthcare profes-
sionals have mentioned a variety of activities for this pur-
pose,  such  as:  painting;  music;  travelling;  relaxation; 
gardens or contact with nature.39,55 There were also other 
individual activities to ‘nourish’ from, for example, medi-
tation  or  religious  resources.  Activities  such  as  coexist-
ence 
family, 
teammates13,32,36,38,39,41–44,46,47,49,50,55,56  have  also  been 
mentioned as a source of support and care. Using emo-
tional  support  activities  has  been  statistically  related  to 
quality of life.49 At the third level, the professionals per-
form  a  behavioural  disengagement.  They  temporarily 
apply  this  strategy  to  protect  themselves,  putting  work 
aside, so they do not take it home and do not think about 
it.21,35,38–42,49–51,56  In  addition,  they  detach  themselves 
emotionally from their patients, through a psychological 
separation from recently deceased patients.32,39–41

Self-transforming coping

It is a coping mechanism based on self-transformation. 
It groups together the set of activities in which the pro-
fessionals  evolve  by  accepting  their  personal  and  pro-
fessional  limits.  This  action  takes  place  through  a 
process  of  continuous  reflection,  over  time,  reviewing 
and  sometimes  reformulating  values  and  meanings  in 
life. It includes four main types of activities in which the 
professionals:

••

accept limits, as persons, and recognise the need to 
maintain  professional  boundaries,13,32,33,37,38,40,42,43 
overcome initial frustrations,39,44 consider that it is 

and 

training, 

not their fault that the patients are ill, and recognise 
their own limits.20,21,39

12,30,31,35,37–39,44–46,51;
look  for  balance  and  harmony  in  their  personal 
lives, seeking a healthy balance between work and 
life 30,31,35,39,42–45,49,56;
review  values  of  life,  with  (re)meaning  of  death, 
accepting  it  as  natural11,30,32,34,36,38–41,43,45–47,52  and 
confronting their own deaths. There has also been 
a  renewal  of  the  meaning  of  life.11,36,38–41,44–46,52 
Coping  strategies based  on  meaning  and  purpose 
in life were statistically related to better scores in 
the burnout dimensions.52

Encountering Finding deep professional 
meaning

This is a coping mechanism aimed at finding deep mean-
ing in what healthcare professionals do. They experience 
the deep meaning of their work, find job satisfaction and 
grow professionally. Activities in this coping style include: 
feeling an external professional (re)appreciation; having 
sense  of  achievement  and  meaning  of  the  work  per-
formed  30,34,43,44,46;  and  the  feeling  that  the  healthcare 
they  provide  makes  the  difference.30,34,38  Patients  and 
family members value and validate the healthcare these 
professionals provide,30,38,41,43,44,51 which makes them feel 
satisfied and fulfilled at work.30,39,41,44,47,51 They reformu-
late their actions13,30,44,46,49 adopting open attitudes37,38,44 
that  lead  them  to  have  realistic  expectations,13  find  a 
sense of coherence,30 and face challenges cognitively.30,46 
Positive reinterpretation has been statistically associated 
with professional and spiritual quality of life.46

In summary, the four coping strategies include differ-
ent activities that, in a dynamic continuum and evolving, 
can  range  from  ‘common  day-to-day’  activities  to  more 
introspective ones, which are combined. The latter allow 
deeper self-knowledge, learning, and  growth  that  trans-
form and train healthcare professionals. These strategies 
are used according to the different influencing factors pre-
sent in each situation.

Factors that influence coping strategies of 
healthcare professionals

The factors that influence coping strategies are very var-
ied. They include characteristics of the professionals and/
or circumstances associated with work and caring for oth-
ers. Most of these factors can influence positively or nega-
tively, suggesting that they are dynamic. Sometimes, they 
become protective (resources), and, other times, risk fac-
tors, depending on the context and how the professionals 
experience them.

Training and healthcare team acquire special relevance 
in the dynamic factors group. Thus, feeling well trained is 
a source of greater security and confidence. These health-
care professionals feel better prepared, even to face the 
death of the patients.12,32,36,38,45,54,56,57 Proper training also 
encourages self-control44 and improves individual coping 
skills.57  Training  is  positively  and  statistically  related  to 
greater satisfaction resulting from compassion.47

On the other hand, if there is lack of training, health-
care professionals feel ill-prepared to deal with patients’ 
cases,  feeling  mentally  and  emotionally  unprepared.33 
This factor includes the lack of knowledge and/or under-
standing  of  the  philosophy  among  the  team  members. 
This fact creates disagreements with respect to the treat-
ment  goals,  considering  more  aggressive  or  invasive 
options.48,50,57  Even  the  lack  of  training  of  other  health-
care professionals is a risk factor, given that they do not 
understand or value their work.32,33,50 They are considered 
a second-class form of medicine, which makes them feel 
isolated and be seen as ‘freaks’.39

The healthcare team becomes a protective factor when 
it  creates  a  favourable  work  environment,30–32,39,40,46,48 
supports colleagues,30,31,34,38,40,42,43,46,48,49,51,55 shares expe-
riences,11,30–32,38–41,43,44,48,49,55  and  has  good  manage-
ment.31,40,48,49 On the contrary, it is a risk factor when it is 
a source of stress. This situation can result from interper-
sonal stress, lack of communication and limits, difficulty in 
responding  to  changes,  support  problems  within  the 
team,  and  few  opportunities  to  share  experiences  and 
feelings.11,30,32,33,39,40,42,50,57 The same fact occurs with per-
sonal characteristics, which are quite static. Aspects such 
as  temperament,  age,  being  married,  sex,  previous  per-
sonal  experience,  personality  and  philosophy  of 
life12,13,30,39,46,51,57 seemed to be protector factors. On the 
other hand, problems resulting from coping with death or 
dysfunctional behaviours (addiction) seemed to represent 
risk factors.43,49

Professional motivation is also influential. It protects 
when the following aspects are present: there is love and 
passion for the work performed  13,31,38;the professionals 
have a vocation for palliative care 11,30,31,38,39,45;there is an 
active and unequivocal desire to work in this field 31,38,39,42; 
and these professionals do not find their job particularly 
stressful.48 However, it is a risk factor if there are discrep-
ancies  between  individuals’  expectations,  the  clinical 
reality, and the expectations of the team members. It is 
also a risk if the initial enthusiasm fades; if they have not 
found balance; or if there is a perception of not having 
done enough.31–33,36,56

The  families  of  professionals  are  protective  if  they 
provide  support,  but  they  can  be  a  risk  factor.37,38,44–46 
Patient families can also be both risk factors and protec-
tive.  These  families  entail  challenges,  shocking  emo-
tional 
associated 
negative feelings.13,31,36,42,47,50–53,56

experiences,35,36,39–41,44,45,47 

and 

There are two factors that seemed to be only risky: (1) the 
emotional burden associated with providing healthcare for 
patients  with  shocking  emotional  experiences11,32,39,42,45 
and  associated  negative  feelings  13,31,42,45–49,51;  and  (2)  the 
presence of systemic or administrative stressors. The latter 
are due to institutional policies or malfunction of the system, 
administrative issues, and poor working conditions, includ-
ing  too  much  workload  or  staff  turnover,  and  difficulty  in 
managing time.33,39,40,42,48,50,57

Coping process model in palliative care

The  interpretive  and  conceptual  analysis  carried  out 
inductively indicated a model of coping strategies in palli-
ative care that was a process of personal and professional 
development  over  time.  As  explained  below,  coping 
mechanisms of healthcare professionals evolve over time.
Throughout  a  dynamic  adaptation  and  learning  pro-
cess over time, coping strategies and influencing factors 
become intertwined. Faced with stressful events, health-
care professionals implement coping strategies by means 
of  different  activities.  Sometimes,  the  combination  of 
activities  also  entails  combinations  of  coping  strategies. 
The results of the different studies assessed allowed infer-
ring that there were coping strategies developed in a pro-
active and intentional way and, at the same time, there 
were  strategies  that  resulted  from  experience,  training, 
and  professional  maturity.  The  different  combinations 
imply more or less introspection, which promotes greater 
or lesser learning and development in the coping process, 
reflected in the impact of job challenges on palliative care 
professionals. There was interdependence between influ-
encing factors and coping strategies. It was observed that 
there was coalescence between all of them.

For example, there were cases in which these health-
care professionals talked with their colleagues and shared 
experiences.  This  is  a  concrete  activity  that  promotes  a 
strategy to enable these professionals to reassess them-
selves and their professional meaning. They can apply this 
strategy if the team is a protective factor. However, if the 
team becomes a risk factor, the professionals do not share 
with  their  colleagues  and  take  the  responsibilities  as  an 
active confrontation strategy. In addition, different profes-
sionals can use the same activities in different ways. For 
example, some professionals go out for a walk. This activ-
ity  allows  them  to  disconnect  from  work.  On  the  other 
hand, professionals can go out for a walk to deliberately 
reflect  and  gain  perspective  about  their  work.  Coping 
strategies  may  change  as  the  professionals  evolve,  and 
the  combinations  also  vary  according  to  influencing  fac-
tors,  some  of  which  are  changing  and  others  are  static 
(e.g. personal characteristics).

In this evolution, the professionals carry out a learning 
process, combining various coping strategies, which trans-
form them personally and professionally. This evolution,

in turn, makes their coping strategies evolve and change, 
configuring  a  coping  style  intrinsically  related  to  a  pro-
gressive  and  greater  response  capacity  with  respect  to 
emotionally demanding situations.39,47,54

The  coping  is  a  diachronic  process  of  responses  to 
influencing  factors  that  involve  the  use  and  develop-
ment of different coping strategies. These strategies can 
evolve  in  introspection  throughout  the  professional 
career, thus leading to personal and professional devel-
opment (Figure 2).

Discussion

The  present  literature  review  indicated  that  the  coping 
mechanisms  of  palliative  care  professionals  were  more 
complex  and  dynamic  than  what  has  been  indicated  so 
far.1  These  professionals  used  and  combined  different 
coping strategies. The strategies described functioned at 
different  levels  of  introspection  and  were  dynamic. 
Proactive coping included activities in search of trust and 
control,21,30,48,51,53 focusing more on action and empower-
ment.  It  approached  the  perspective  of  Folkman  and 
Lazarus  with  a  focus  on  the  problems  and  their  resolu-
tion.3,4,6 When facing the problems, the individuals make 
an effort to change the situation that exists between the 
environment and themselves minimising stressors. Coping 
mechanism  based  on  self-care  has  been  described  as  a 
progressive  strategy  applied  through  self-knowledge, 

while  developing  self-care  activities  and  behavioural 
disengagement.

This coping mechanism is intentionally targeted at self-
protection.  The  inability  to  separate  oneself  from  work 
and/or  having  a  restricted  social  support  network  were 
regarded  as  greater  risks  of  developing  compassion 
fatigue.39,58  The  fact  that  these  professionals  protect 
themselves does not mean a less compassionate practice, 
since it is necessary to know oneself in order to be com-
passionate  and  protect  oneself.59,60  Self-knowledge  is 
essential for self-care by providing the additional possibil-
ity of finding regeneration within the work environment 
and  clinical  activities  (i.e.  establishing  healing  connec-
tions).61 A study62 that implemented a 10-week of mind-
fulness  training  revealed  a  perceived  improvement  in 
self-care,  the  integration  of  conscious  disruptions  into 
work routines, a reduction in rumination and anxiety gen-
erated in contact with the patient, as well as an improve-
ment in connection interpersonal skills. An improvement 
in team communication was also identified.

Kearney and Weininger61 stated that self-care was not 
so much about managing stress and harm limitations, but 
finding ways to remember and stay engaged at the work-
place with the wholeness that already exists. This is in line 
with more recent work47,54,63 If we are not aware of our 
own  needs,  we  cannot  be  available  to  help  others  with 
theirs63,64  This  approach  partly  coincides  with  that  of 
Vachon,20  who  affirmed  that  personal  coping  strategies, 

Sapeta et al. 

25

such as developing a sense of competence, having control 
over  the  activities,  and  finding  pleasure  from  work,  are 
not enough; the individuals need something more in the 
long term. Developing a self-care plan can be an effective 
strategy65  and  the  Self-Care  Matters  resource  can  guide 
the  health  professional  through  his/her  own  self-care 
planning process.64

The  present  review  revealed  that  there  was  coping 
based on self-transformation as a consequence of a pro-
cess of continuous reflection and emancipation. This find-
ing suggests a different coping model from the one based 
on  the  regulation  of  emotions  and  the  management  of 
problems that generate suffering,66 or from the one based 
on  personal  and  organisational  strategies.6  This  review 
suggests that these healthcare professionals accept their 
limits, reformulate their values, and renew the meaning in 
life. This aspect was not included in the conceptual model 
proposed  by  Folkman  et  al.3  Saunders67  highlighted  the 
need for self-reflection and self-care in palliative care pro-
fessionals,  in  order  to  maintain  the  joy  of  performing  a 
vocational  profession.  This  resonates  with  the  more 
recent  concept  of  total  care,  representing  a  continuum 
beginning with care and compassion for oneself, extend-
ing to care and compassion for others32,38

The  importance  of  setting  limits  is  perceived  in  the 
‘dynamics  of  the  wounded  healer’.  While  the  physicians 
continue  doing  everything  they  can  to  solve  patients’ 
problems and alleviate their suffering, the wounded heal-
ers  do  so  with  the  awareness  of  not  being  omnipotent, 
accepting the vulnerability and limits as a source of com-
petence to help the others. The wounded healers realise 
that  patients  have  innate  abilities  within  themselves  to 
heal physically, psychologically and spiritually. Therefore, 
they make efforts to awaken that innate potential in the 
patients,  without  being  ‘hurt’.9,68  This  aspect  is  reminis-
cent of the last phase of ‘deep compassion’ in the Harper-
based  model,  which  has  been  criticised  for  describing  a 
time-limited  process  for  each  phase  (i.e.  depression 
6–9 months) and an end point.66,68,69 The model is based 
on  American  healthcare  professionals  caring  for  dying 
patients.68 However, our analysis did not indicate an end 
point, but a continuous evolutionary process.

Another coping strategy, that we called ‘encountering 
deep professional meaning’ has also been observed. It is a 
cycle of personal growth and constant (re)appreciation of 
the caring process,58 and the professional approach in a 
search  for  meaning.  This  concept  supports  the  recom-
mendation  of  Antoniazzi  et  al,5  including  the  search  for 
global and situational meaning as a thoughtful and active 
coping strategy. It should be considered that this ‘search 
for meaning’ in the explanatory model includes two areas: 
rethinking the professional sense, and reconsidering one-
self and own values. The model shows that the two strate-
gies are important, but also the other ones explained. This 

aspect  should  be  taken  into  account  when  considering 
Pargament’s  model,  which  focuses  on  the  existential 
dimension, mentioning the mechanisms of clinging to the 
meaning that one gives, and changing the meaning when 
it is no longer valid.40

The  coping  strategies  found  may  recall  the  division 
between ‘personal coping strategies’ and ‘environmental 
strategies’.20We  did  not  use  these  terms,  because  the 
results did not support this distinction. Systemic stressors 
were observed in our review  30,33,42,48,50,56; however, they 
were not addressed, because there were no coping strate-
gies at this level of work context. Collaborative work rela-
tionships,  support  groups,  and  administrative  policies 
have been mentioned as strategies of this type,20 within a 
person-environment fit approach to stress.70 The support 
of colleagues has been mentioned, but as personal rela-
tionships  with  co-workers,  that  is,  as  personal  and  indi-
vidual  strategies  more  than  organisational  ones  or 
institutional philosophies.71–73 If the emphasis of the dec-
ade on healthy work environments is taken into account, 
the  fact  that  labour  resources  for  facing  the  challenges 
were not found is striking.74–76 It would be worth promot-
ing  coping  strategies  and  combating  workplace  stress, 
developing quality workplace resources that consider the 
person-environment  relationship,47  and,  at  the  same 
time, build coping strategies that decrease administrative 
stress and promote rotation or self-care initiatives such as 
art-therapy for professionals.71–73

The present review indicated that the factors influenc-
ing the coping mechanisms can vary and range from being 
protective to risk factors and vice versa; in line with the 
situations, activities or resources. These results convey a 
different  view  compared  to  the  more  dichotomous 
approach  proposed  by  Vachon,77  who  grouped  coping 
mechanisms into two categories, that is, risk or protective 
factors. Lazarus78 stated that these mechanisms are some-
thing subjective that depend on whether the individuals 
perceive  the  situations  as  potentially  dangerous  events 
for  their  psychological  well-being  or  not.  Our  analysis 
showed  that  the  perception  of  the  factors  was  not  only 
subjective, but also changing, and there could be interre-
lations between them. It is worth considering the stress-
ors that should be decreased, but also the protectors that 
should  be  promoted.  It  was  observed  that  teamwork, 
training or patients’ families can change and be protective 
or  stressful.  Even  some  personal  characteristics  such  as 
motivation  and  vocation  for  palliative  care  vary.2,68 
Motivation  and  vocation  gained  greater  relevance 
together with training  in the present review than in the 
study conducted by Vachon.20 This is in line with positive 
effects showed on compassion satisfaction or pleasure in 
one’s work. This result could be due to the emphasis on 
the necessary training and professional choice targeted at 
providing healthcare to patients with advanced diseases 

26 

Palliative Medicine 36(1)

in  recent  years.67,68The  emotional  burden  –  associated 
with  caring  for  the  patients  –  and  systemic  stressors 
remain  as  stressor  factors  20;  although  the  ambiguity  of 
the role as stressors was not observed.

The  proposed  model  indicated  that  coping  mecha-
nisms were iterative and transformative processes, and 
not just resolution of emotions or problems. The influ-
encing  factors  vary,  the  coping  strategies  combine  and 
evolve and, in turn, palliative care professionals develop 
personally  and  professionally.  This  model  covers  a 
knowledge  gap  between  the  factors,  the  different  con-
frontations,  and  the  results  of  the  coping  strategies. 
Until  now,  negative  results  have  been  emphasised  (i.e. 
burnout,  increased  mood  and  sleep  disturbances  in 
healthcare  providers);  however,  positive  results  were 
present (i.e. professional satisfaction). Personal and pro-
fessional development occurs over time, resulting from 
emancipatory  reflection,  a  sense  of  achievement,  job 
satisfaction, acquisition of greater personal and profes-
sional  maturity  and  resilience.  In  his  works  on  moral 
resilience,  Frankl79  affirmed  that  the  true  existential 
meaning  derived  from  three  sources,  namely:  (1) 
achievements  and  creative  activities  such  as  solving  a 
problem or creating something; (2) experiencing some-
thing or someone inspiring, such as the beauty of nature, 
love for a spouse or family, or the value of a friend; and 
(3) accepting the inescapable value in inevitable suffer-
ing.  We  can  choose  within  ourselves  to  make  sense  of 
each situation, which helps us to be morally resilient. In 
our  analysis,  it  was  observed  that,  in  the  coping  pro-
cesses, the professionals made this development trajec-
tory in the evolution of their skills and competence. The 
G.R.A.C.E.80  is  a  process  has  been  developed  to  offer 
nurses and others a practice to enable them to respond 
more compassionately and with greater clarity and ethi-
cal grounding as they endeavour to find a compassion-
ate path through complex clinical situations. The process 
can  enable  nurses  to  understand  and  focus  on  specific 
and  integrated  elements,  ideally  allowing  compassion 
and  resilience  to  emerge  in  the  relationship  between 
nurse  and  patient,  nurse  and  nurse,  inter-professional 
team members, and nurse and family caregivers. p.124’

This  coping  mechanism  approach  is  consistent  with 
studies on the career path of palliative care professionals, 
which had observed different stages towards greater pro-
fessional  development  and  maturity.  These  studies  also 
suggested  that  these  healthcare  professionals  experi-
enced  situations  of  emotional  impact  that  they  should 
address in order to be able to successfully perform their 
professional  activities.39,44  Remen81  said  that  burnout 
happens  as  grieve  is  not  done  and  hearts  become  filled 
with loss and there is no room left to care. Addressing the 
experienced emotional situations is a ‘professional trajec-
tory’ of transformation or metamorphosis.39 Those stud-
ies briefly mentioned some activities that they had used, 

such as development of communication skills, and  reas-
sessment and adaptation of their strategies.38,39,44

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprec-
edented challenges to palliative care providers, recogniz-
ing a greater need for self-care practice.82 It has increased 
mood  and  sleep  disturbances  on  healthcare  workers,83 
and concerns about risk of infection coupled with limita-
tions  in  personal  protective  equipment.82  It  would  be 
interesting to explore if their common coping mechanism 
are  applicable  to  this  situation  or  palliative  care  profes-
sionals have developed different coping mechanisms.

Implications for practice

These healthcare professionals learn to take care of them-
selves while taking care of others. The model showed that 
coping mechanisms in palliative care extend beyond the 
management  of  emotions  and  problems,84  and  beyond 
the disengagement of personal aspects from the environ-
ment.51 It is a learning process over time, in which influ-
encing  factors,  coping  strategies  and  personal  and 
professional development are interrelated. This develop-
ment is probably the most central pillar in training on pro-
viding healthcare to others. The degree of self-awareness 
can  be  trained  with  practices  oriented  to  the  develop-
ment of attention, allowing better management of emo-
tions and greater emotional balance.65 This is a factor that 
makes  a  difference  between  ‘suffering’  and  ‘enjoying 
work’.85

As Balint86 suggests, health professionals are the most 
powerful  medicine  for  patients,  emphasising  the  impor-
tance of personal and professional aspects. The effective-
ness of the healthcare process for end-of-life patients and 
their families will depend on providing healthcare ‘with-
out getting burned’, and, to that end, harmony and per-
sonal  balance  is  necessary.  If  these  health  professionals 
manage  to  establish  a  deep  relationship,  in  which  the 
bond is healing for both the patients and themselves, they 
will achieve deep personal satisfaction an expanded per-
ception of reality and participation in the transmutation 
of others’ suffering. This practice is not only non-exhaust-
ing,  but  a  source  of  satisfaction  and  personal  growth, 
which  promotes  self-care  activities  performed  by  the 
health professionals during the therapeutic processes.2

Limitations of the study

One limitation was that, in the literature reviewed, it was 
not possible to find studies addressing palliative care pro-
fessionals who had abandoned the activity, as well as the 
coping  strategies  they  used.  No  denial  or  escape  strate-
gies have been observed. In fact, they were mentioned in 
a single study as the least used by the health profession-
als.51 As Collier49 concluded, adaptive responses are more 
frequent  than  maladaptive  ones  in  palliative  care.  Even 

Sapeta et al. 

27

so, the cases of professionals who have not been able to 
continue  performing  in  palliative  care  would  provide  a 
complementary vision that might contribute to the under-
standing of coping mechanisms in this area. Another limi-
tation  is  not  including  the  global  impact  and  ongoing 
nature of the COVID pandemic that happened after start-
ing  this  review.  It  goes  beyond  the  review  aim,  and  has 
posed new challenges to palliative care professionals dur-
ing COVID, distorting normal work.

Conclusions

Coping  mechanisms  are  evolutionary  processes,  in  which 
there is interdependence between influencing factors (pro-
tective  and  risky)  and  coping  strategies.  It  was  observed 
that there was a systemic coalescence or fusion between all 
of  them.  There  were  coping  strategies  developed  proac-
tively, intentionally, and, at the same time, resulting from 
greater  experience,  training  and  professional  maturity. 
Resilience takes a central value. Time is a variable that influ-
ences personal and professional development and, conse-
quently, coping strategies. The coping process seemed to 
be linked to the development of professional careers in pal-
liative  care.  The  complexity  of  the  phenomenon  and  the 
link  of  coping  strategies  to  factors  and/or  circumstances 
and the development of the professional careers are areas 
to  be  explored,  particularly  assessing  professionals  with 
more years of experience in this area.
