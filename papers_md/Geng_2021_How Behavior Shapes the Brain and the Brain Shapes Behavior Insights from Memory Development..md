Source memory improves substantially during childhood. This improvement is thought to be closely related to hippocampal
maturation. As previous studies have mainly used cross-sectional designs to assess relations between source memory and hip-
pocampal function, it remains unknown whether changes in the brain precede improvements in memory or vice versa. To
address this gap, the current study used an accelerated longitudinal design (n = 200, 100 males) to follow 4- and 6-year-old
human children for 3 years. We traced developmental changes in source memory and intrinsic hippocampal functional con-
nectivity and assessed differences between the 4- and 6-year-old cohorts in the predictive relations between source memory
changes and intrinsic hippocampal functional connectivity in the absence of a demanding task. Consistent with previous stud-
ies, there were age-related increases in source memory and intrinsic functional connectivity between the hippocampus and
cortical regions known to be involved during memory encoding. Novel findings showed that changes in memory ability early
in life predicted later connectivity between the hippocampus and cortical regions and that intrinsic hippocampal functional
connectivity predicted later changes in source memory. These findings suggest that behavioral experience and brain develop-
ment are interactive, bidirectional processes, such that experience shapes future changes in the brain and the brain shapes
future changes in behavior. Results also suggest that both timing and location matter, as the observed effects depended on
both children’s age and the specific brain ROIs. Together, these findings add critical insight into the interactive relations
between cognitive processes and their underlying neurologic bases during development.

Significance Statement

Cross-sectional studies have shown that the ability to remember the contextual details of previous experiences (i.e., source
memory) is related to hippocampal development in childhood. It is unknown whether hippocampal functional changes pre-
cede improvements in memory or vice versa. By using an accelerated longitudinal design, we found that early source memory
changes predicted later intrinsic hippocampal functional connectivity and that this connectivity predicted later source mem-
ory changes. These findings suggest that behavioral experience and brain development are interactive, bidirectional processes,
such that experience shapes future changes in the brain and the brain shapes future behavioral changes. Moreover, these
interactions varied as a function of children’s age and brain region, highlighting the importance of a developmental perspec-
tive when investigating brain-behavior interactions.

Introduction
Source memory improves substantially during childhood (e.g.,
Riggins, 2014). Specifically, with age, children become better at
reporting and retaining contextual details of life experiences
(Bauer, 2007). This development is closely related to hippocampal
maturation, as evidenced by age- and memory-related differences
in hippocampal structure and function across development (see
Ghetti and Bunge, 2012 for review; Sastre et al., 2016; Tang et al.,
2018; Riggins et al., 2020). Previous studies have mainly used
cross-sectional designs to assess relations between brain and
memory development, which do not allow for investigating true

developmental changes and may be influenced by confounding
factors, such as cohort effects. Therefore, it remains unknown
whether changes in the brain precede improvements in memory
or vice versa. Additionally, previous studies have focused on either
young children or school-aged children, which make comparisons
of different developmental periods difficult. To address these gaps,
the current study used an accelerated longitudinal design to follow
4- and 6-year-old children for 3 years. This design allowed us to
explore developmental changes in intrinsic hippocampal func-
tional connectivity (iHFC) and to assess differences between the 4-
and 6-year-old cohorts in the predictive relations between source
memory and functional connectivity (see Fig. 1).

In adults,

intrinsic functional connectivity is thought to
reflect the brain’s functional architecture, which emerges as a
result of task-elicited coactivation between brain regions (Fox
and Raichle, 2007). Children’s intrinsic functional connectivity
patterns are likely constructed in a similar manner; however,
the long-term molding hypothesis has proposed that these
connectivity patterns are shaped over time as a result of both
maturation and experience (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2016). For
example, by following 4- to 18-year-olds over 2 years, prospec-
tive analyses indicated that task-elicited amygdala functional
connectivity predicted resting-state functional connectivity
2 years later, but not concurrently (Gabard-Durnam et al.,
2016). These findings suggest associations between task-based
brain activation and intrinsic functional connectivity in both
children and adults; however, such associations may differ
across development.

Empirical data also support bidirectional influences between
the brain and behavior. First, previous studies support the
notion that behavioral changes shape task-based and intrinsic
functional connectivity (e.g., Jolles et al., 2016; Clark et al.,
2017; Rosenberg-Lee et al., 2018). For example, in 8- to 9-year-
old children, 8 weeks of math tutoring strengthened iHFC to
intraparietal sulcus (Jolles et al., 2016). Second, empirical stud-
ies have shown that intrinsic functional connectivity can pre-
dict gains in cognitive abilities later in development (e.g., Hoeft

et al., 2011; Supekar et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2015). For exam-
ple, Supekar et al. (2013) found that iHFC measured before
math tutoring predicted performance improvements after
tutoring during middle childhood.

Based on these studies, we explored whether there were bidir-
ectional influences between source memory changes and intrin-
sic functional connectivity from the hippocampus to brain
regions reported to support encoding contextual information
(Geng et al., 2019). We used an accelerated longitudinal design
to assess the following: (a) age-related changes in concurrent
relations between source memory and iHFC; (b) predictive rela-
tions between early source memory changes and later iHFC; and
(c) predictive relations between early iHFC and later source
memory changes (Fig. 1).

We hypothesized that early source memory gains would pre-
dict later iHFC because the impact of experience is thought to
build up over time (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2016). Accumulating
experiences with everyday memory activities were expected
to drive developmental changes in iHFC during childhood.
Additionally, because of greater plasticity early in develop-
ment (e.g., Tottenham and Sheridan, 2010), we expected that
memory changes would more robustly predict later connec-
tivity in the younger versus older cohort.

As brain connectivity has been suggested to shape later
behavior (e.g., Evans et al., 2015), we hypothesized that iHFC
would predict gains in source memory abilities. Additionally,
because hippocampal function is more mature during middle
versus early childhood (Geng et al., 2019), we hypothesized that
connectivity at 6 years would more robustly predict future mem-
ory than connectivity at 4 years.

Materials and Methods
Participants
Children were participants in a large study investigating memory and
brain development in early childhood that used an accelerated longitudi-
nal design (N = 200, 100 males) (Riggins et al., 2018; Geng et al., 2019).
The first wave (W1) of the study included 4- to 8-year-old children. The

female adult (“Abby”) and a male-voiced puppet (“Henry”) via digital
videos (Drummey and Newcombe, 2002; Riggins, 2014). Each source
provided 6 facts for a total of 12 facts. Presentation of facts was blocked
by source, where children first learned 6 facts from one source followed
by 6 facts from the other source, and the order of blocks was randomized
across participants. There were three lists of facts; each list consisted of
unique facts that were similar across lists (e.g., “A group of kangaroos is
called a mob” or “A group of goats is called a tribe”). These lists were
randomly assigned across participants. Children were asked to pay atten-
tion to the facts as they would be tested on the facts the following week,
but were not told that they would be tested on the source of the facts.
Children were asked whether they knew the facts before the experiment.
Known facts were excluded and were replaced with additional novel facts
from the list of the same source (but this rarely occurred). Each source
had 8 possible facts to account for the possibility that children would
know 1 or 2 of the facts. If a child knew 3 or more facts from one source,
the total number of facts the child was tested on was reduced (but this
was rare, n = 4).

Retrieval. During the second visit, children were tested on their
memory for the facts and sources from the first visit. Children were
asked to answer 22 trivia questions and to tell the experimenter where
they had learned the answers to those trivia questions. They were told
that they had learned some of the questions the week before from either
“Abby” or “Henry,” some they might have learned outside the laboratory
(e.g., from a teacher or parent), and some they may not know. The chil-
dren learned 6 of the 22 facts presented from “Abby,” 6 from “Henry,” 5
were facts commonly known by children (e.g., “What color is the sky?”),
and 5 were facts that children typically would not know (e.g., “What is
the colored part of your eye called?”). Each list of 22 facts had two ran-
dom presentation orders, and these orders were counterbalanced across
participants. If children were unable to recall the source for a particular
question, five multiple choice options were given: parents, teacher, girl
in the video, puppet in the video, or just knew/guessed.

Source memory was calculated as the proportion of questions for
which children accurately recalled or recognized both the fact and the
source out of the total number of facts learned (see the formula below).
This measure of source memory is thought to reflect the binding of facts
and sources, which is an important aspect of episodic memory (Miller et
al., 2013; Cooper and Ritchey, 2020).

Imaging data acquisition
Participants were scanned in a Siemens 3.0 T scanner (MAGNETOM
Trio Tim System, Siemens Medical Solutions) using a 32-channel coil.
Children first completed the task-free scan, followed by a T1-weighted
structural scan (T1, see Riggins et al., 2018). In the first wave of data col-
lection, children also completed a memory encoding task if time permit-
ted (for results, see Geng et al., 2019). During the task-free scan, children
were not given any overt task but were instructed to lie as still as possible
with their eyes open. The duration of the scan was 7 min and 6 s. To
minimize motion, Inscapes, a movie designed to reduce head motion
during fMRI data collection, was played (Vanderwal et al., 2015). A total
of 210 whole-brain volumes were collected using a T2p-weighted gradi-
ent EPI sequence (TR 2 s, TE 25 ms, slice thickness 3.5 mm, voxel size
3.0 mm (cid:2) 3.0 mm (cid:2) 3.5 mm, voxel matrix 64 (cid:2) 64, flip angle 70°, FOV
192 mm, 36 slices). Structural images were acquired during a 4 min 26 s
scan with a T1-weighted MPRAGE (TR 1.9 s; TE 2.32 ms; slice thickness
0.9 mm with no gap; voxel size 0.9 (cid:2) 0.9 (cid:2) 0.9 mm; voxel matrix
256 (cid:2) 256 mm; flip angle 9°; FOV 230 (cid:2) 230 mm).

During the task-free scan, participant head motion was monitored in
real-time. If a participant exhibited excessive head motion (.2 mm in
any direction) during the first half of any run, the scan was restarted and
the participant was reminded to stay as still as possible.

Number of waves children participated in the study and their age at each wave

4- and 6-year-old children were invited back for two subsequent waves
of testing (W2 and W3; Fig. 2). In total, there were three waves, and each
wave included young and old cohorts (young cohort: W1 = 4 years,
W2 = 5 years, W3 = 6 years; old cohort: W1 = 6 years, W2 = 7 years,
W3 = 8 years). Table 1 shows the number of children who provided 3, 2,
or 1 waves of data for final analyses in each cohort. The main reasons for
loss of neuroimaging data were that the children moved too much, fell
asleep during the scan, refused to enter the scanner, or the families failed
to follow up.

We measured children’s IQ at W1 by using the vocabulary and block
design subtests from either the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children
(Ed 4) (Wechsler, 2003) or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale
for Intelligence (Wechsler, 2012). All children included in analyses had
average to above-average estimated IQ. No difference was found
between the young and old cohorts in scaled scores on the vocabulary
(young: mean = 11.07, SD = 2.96; old: mean = 11.66, SD = 2.55; p = 0.33)
or block design subtests
(young: mean = 12.96, SD = 2.73; old:
mean = 13.03, SD = 3.00; p = 0.92). Parents reported all participants to be
healthy without any neurodevelopmental disorders, neurologic condi-
tions, or psychiatric conditions. Additionally, parents reported 88.5%
children as righthanded, 6.8% as lefthanded, 3.7% as ambidextrous, and
1% as not able to be determined.

Experimental design

Encoding. During the first visit, children learned novel facts (e.g., “A
group of rhinos is called a crash”) from one of two different sources, a

Imaging data preprocessing
In the analyses, all 210 collected resting-state fMRI images were included,
as the first four volumes were discarded before data collection because of
the instability of
the initial MR signal and participant adaptation.
Preprocessing included the following steps. First, slice time correction,
head motion correction, and smoothing were performed using
DPABI 1.3 (Yan et al., 2016). An independent component analysis
was then run on smoothed data using MELODIC, an FSL toolbox,
to remove artifact-related components (Geng et al., 2019). After
removing all artifact-related components, brain extraction, nor-
malization, and filtering were conducted. Following the procedure
suggested by Tillman et al. (2018), brain extraction on T1-weighted
image was conducted separately in six toolboxes:
the Advanced
Normalization Tools, AFNI, FSL, BSE, ROBEX, and SPM8 to ensure
high-quality data. The voxels extracted by at least four toolboxes were
included in the brain mask. Advanced Normalization Tools was used to
perform coregistration and normalization. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted in AFNI (Cox, 1996). Temporal bandpass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz)
and spatial smoothing with a 5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel were per-
formed in AFNI on normalized data.

Individual seed regions (bilateral anterior and posterior hippocam-
pus) were derived from the structural scan using Freesurfer 5.1 (https://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) (Fischl, 2012) and edited using Automatic
Segmentation Adapter Tool (www.nitrc.org/projects/segadapter) (Wang
et al., 2011). The hippocampus was divided into anterior and posterior
segments using manual identification of standard anatomic landmarks.
The uncal apex served as the border between anterior and posterior hip-
pocampus (Duvernoy, 2005; Weiss et al., 2005). Raters were blind to par-
ticipant age and sex. Reliability for identification of these landmarks
indicated 94.60% agreement within 1 slice and 99.99% agreement within
2 slices. Intraclass correlation coefficients were high and ranged from
0.897 to 0.985. When there was disagreement between raters on the cor-
rect slice location, the more experienced rater’s slice was used.

Task-free functional connectivity analyses were conducted in AFNI.
First, to minimize the effect of head motion, volumes with framewise
displacement (FD) (cid:3) 0.5 mm were scrubbed in addition to 1 volume
before and 1 volume after the offending volume. All children included in
the final statistical analyses had data (cid:3) 4.87 min in length and mean FD
from 0.05 to 0.50 (0.20 6 0.10, mean 6 SD). Mean FD, absolute move-
ment, and data length for each age group are reported in Table 2. There
was a marginally significant relation between age and mean FD for the
analyses testing the age-related changes in concurrent relations using the
fixed effects model (b = (cid:4)0.011, SE = 0.006, t = (cid:4)1.773, p = 0.077). For

the two prediction analyses, independent t tests indicated that there were
no differences in any motion parameters between young and old cohorts
(p . 0.70).

Correlations between the time series of the individual seed regions
(bilateral anterior and posterior hippocampus) and those of the whole brain
were calculated to generate individual resting state functional connectivity
maps. Subsequently, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was used to convert r
maps into z maps to obtain normally distributed values of the connectivity
maps. The z values were extracted from 6 ROIs: inferior/superior parietal
lobule (IPL/SPL), inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), left inferior temporal gyrus
(ITG), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), fusiform gyrus, and orbital frontal
gyrus (OFG) (Fig. 3). These brain regions were defined according to previ-
ous research, which indicated that 4- to 8-year-old children showed greater
activation in these regions during encoding for items (i.e., pictures of animal
and objects) subsequently remembered with correct sources than the ones
with incorrect sources (i.e., pictures of cartoon characters) (for details, see
Geng et al., 2019). The activation differences suggest that these six brain
regions are critical for encoding contextual information. Therefore, these
regions were chosen as ROIs in the current study.

Statistical analyses
Linear mixed models were used given their capability to handle unbalanced
and incomplete longitudinal data. Specifically, a series of fixed effects mod-
els were run in SPSS 20.0 to test the associations between age, source mem-
ory, and iHFC. First, age-related changes in source memory were assessed.
Then, relations between age, source memory, and iHFC to each ROI were
analyzed to assess the changes in concurrent relations. Next, the models
were used to examine whether earlier changes in source memory predicted
later iHFC with each ROI and whether earlier functional connectivity with
each ROI predicted later changes in source memory.

As suggested in the Introduction, it takes time for behavioral and
brain changes to mold each other. Therefore, we analyzed the relations
of memory changes between W1 and W2 to functional connectivity at
W3 (Fig. 1). In addition, we calculated the relations of functional con-
nectivity at W1 to memory changes between W1 and W3 (Fig. 1).
Another practical reason for why the memory change intervals were dif-
ferent between the two prediction analyses was that there was no signifi-
cant change in source memory between W2 and W3 in the old cohort.
[Another question of interest would be how changes in source memory
are related to changes in iHFC; however, in the current sample, there
was too much data loss because of motion to examine changes in iHFC
within the two cohorts. Therefore, single time point data are used for
functional connectivity analyses.]

age (cid:2) cohort interaction had better fit
than the model that only included main
effects. Age was positively related to
source memory performance (b = 0.051,
t(353) = 2.281, p = 0.023), and
SE = 0.023,
there was a significant interaction between
age and cohort (b = –0.075, SE = 0.031,
t(353) = (cid:4)2.423, p = 0.016). When this
interaction was probed, results showed
that age-related changes in source mem-
ory were greater in the young versus old
cohort (p , 0.001 vs p = 0.028; Fig. 4). No
differences were observed between the 6-
year-old children from the young cohort
who were tested at W3 and the 6-year-old
children from the old cohort who were
tested at W1 (p . 0.90). Additionally, we
tested whether there were differences in
source memory between age groups in
each cohort. All the comparisons between
age groups reached significance with the
exception of the difference between 7 and
8 years (p = 0.24).

Age-related changes in concurrent
relations between source memory and
functional connectivity
Fixed effects of the linear mixed models
included subregion, age, and source mem-
ory as independent variables and iHFC as
the dependent variable. Mean FD was also
included in the model because of the
marginally significant relation between
age and mean FD as reported above. The
main effects models had better fit than
the models with age (cid:2) source memory
interaction. There were significant main
effects of age in predicting the connec-
tivity between hippocampus and left
IPL/SPL, IOG, left ITG, left IFG, fusi-
form gyrus, and OFG. Specifically, as
age increased, iHFC increased as well
(Fig. 5). The main effect of source mem-
ory was not significant for the connectivity between hippo-
campus and any ROI.

Additionally,

there were differences in the connectivity
between anterior versus posterior hippocampus and fusiform,
left ITG, IOG, OFG, and left IPL/SPL (Table 3). In all regions
except OFG, connectivity was greater for posterior compared
with anterior hippocampus. In IFG, there was a trending differ-
ence in hippocampal functional connectivity (anterior , poste-
rior; Table 3).

Predictive relations between source memory changes from
W1 to W2 and functional connectivity at W3
Fixed effects of the linear mixed models included subregion (an-
terior vs posterior), cohort (young vs old), and source memory
change (defined as the differences in source memory between
W1 and W2). Mean FD was not included in the models because
there was no difference in any of the motion parameters (mean
FD, absolute movement, and data length) between young and
old cohorts (p . 0.60). The models containing the cohort (cid:2)
source memory change interaction resulted in better model fit

Figure 4.

Relations between age and memory performance for each cohort.

Continuous covariates (age, mean FD, source memory change, and
iHFC) in these models were standardized across the full sample.
Akaike’s Information Criterion was used to compare models of main
effects to models that included both main and interactive effects. Models
with the lowest Akaike’s Information Criterion value were selected as
the best fitting model. Given the moderate sample size (see Table 1) and
the limited number of ROI, corrections for multiple comparisons were
not applied. If interactions involving cohort (young vs old) were
observed, the relation between source memory measures and iHFC was
estimated again for each cohort by restandardizing the covariates for
each group separately and re-estimating model parameters.

For all linear mixed models involving iHFC as the dependent mea-
sure, bilateral hippocampal subregion (anterior vs posterior) was
included as a within-subjects factor. Since differences between hippo-
campal subregions have been reported in a previous study (Blankenship
et al., 2017), results related to subregion differences are reported briefly.

for left IFG and OFG. In contrast, the main effects models had
better fit for the other four ROIs. Source memory changes
between W1 and W2 were positively related to W3 hippocampal
functional connectivity with left IPL/SPL, IOG, left ITG, and
fusiform gyrus (Table 4; Fig. 6).

There were significant interactions between cohort and
source memory change predicting intrinsic functional connec-
tivity from hippocampus to left IFG and OFG (Table 4). To
probe these interactions, the fixed effects models were used to
assess each cohort separately. In the young cohort, source
memory changes were significantly related to iHFC with left
IFG and OFG (b = 0.109, SE = 0.025, t(73) = 4.341, p , 0.001;
b = 0.068, SE = 0.022, t(73) = 3.117, p = 0.003). However, in the
old cohort, these associations were not apparent (p values
. 0.20). Therefore, only in the young cohort did behavioral
improvements in source memory shape later intrinsic functional

connectivity between hippocampus and these cortical regions
(Fig. 7). Moreover, we reran the analyses above with source mem-
ory at W1 and W2 included in the models to test the relations
between source memory changes and later hippocampal func-
tional connectivity. All results stayed the same, except that the
main effect of source memory changes in left IPL/SPL and IOG
became nonsignificant (p = 0.18; p = 0.11).

Additionally, posterior hippocampus showed greater connec-
tivity to fusiform, left ITG, IOG, and left IPL/SPL than anterior
hippocampus. The difference in OFG and left IFG did not reach
significance (Table 3).

in the model as it was not significantly different between cohorts
(p . 0.70). For left ITG and fusiform, the interaction models had
better fit. For the other ROIs, the main effects models had better
fit but did not generate any significant finding.

The interactions between cohort and iHFC in left ITG and
fusiform gyrus significantly predicted source memory change
(Table 5). To probe the interactions, fixed effects models were
used to test the relations in each cohort separately. In the older
cohort, iHFC with left ITG and fusiform gyrus was related to
source memory change (b = –0.090, SE = 0.024, t(60) = 3.76,
p , 0.001; b = 0.086, SE = 0.029, t(60) = 2.998, p = 0.004). However,
this association was not observed in the young cohort (p . 0.80).
Therefore, only in the old cohort did functional connectivity

between hippocampus and left ITG and fusiform gyrus predict later
improvements in source memory (Fig. 7).

Discussion
This study used an accelerated longitudinal design to investigate
the predictive relations between source memory changes and
iHFC across childhood. First, we found age-related increases in
source memory performance, supporting previous studies high-
lighting age-related differences in source memory in this age
group (Drummey and Newcombe, 2002; Riggins, 2014). Second,
results indicated that iHFC within the memory network increased
across childhood, which is consistent with previous cross-sectional
studies showing similar associations between age and hippocampal

functional connectivity (Blankenship et al., 2017; Geng et al., 2019).
Finally, results indicated that changes in memory performance pre-
dicted later functional connectivity and early functional connectivity
predicted later source memory changes.

Source memory changes predicted later hippocampal
functional connectivity
Source memory changes early in life predicted later intrinsic con-
nectivity between the hippocampus and cortical regions in the ab-
sence of a task, suggesting that behavior shaped later functional
connectivity. Specifically, across all children, changes in memory
predicted intrinsic connectivity from hippocampus to fusiform,
left ITG, IOG, and left IPL/SPL 1 year later. Additionally, within
the younger cohort, early memory changes also predicted hippo-
campal functional connectivity with left IFG and OFG. However,
in analyses assessing aged-related changes in concurrent relations,
memory ability was not related to iHFC. These findings support

the idea that life experience shapes the brain across development,
a notion that has received support from other findings as well
(Fox and Raichle, 2007; Gabard-Durnam et al., 2016). For
instance, task-elicited functional connectivity has been shown to
predict resting-state functional connectivity 2 years later but not
concurrently (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2016). Additionally, as sug-
gested by the interactive specialization framework, we interpreted
the findings to show that changes in memory early in life may
drive functional integration within the hippocampal memory net-
work and that this process takes time to unfold (Johnson, 2011;
Poppenk et al., 2013). In other words, early memory gains may
reflect gradual refinement of the hippocampal memory network
over time, which ultimately leads to enhanced iHFC even during
the absence of a specific task. This is consistent with previous
research in other cognitive domains showing that arithmetic train-
ing induced changes in hippocampal-parietal connectivity in mid-
dle childhood (Rosenberg-Lee et al., 2018).

Hippocampal functional connectivity predicted later source
memory changes
Connectivity from hippocampus to fusiform and ITG predicted
memory changes 2 years later. However, this was only true for
the older cohort, such that iHFC with fusiform and left ITF at
6 years predicted memory changes 2 years later. These findings
support the claim that activity in the brain can also shape behav-
ior, and suggest that functional integration within the hippocam-
pal memory network can predict future developmental gains in
memory ability in children as young as 6 years of age. This find-
ing is consistent with previous studies suggesting that earlier
iHFC can predict intervention-induced behavioral changes in
typical and atypical developmental populations (Hoeft et al.,
2011; Supekar et al., 2013). Therefore, our study suggests that,
early in life, the interaction between brain and behavioral devel-
opment is not unidirectional, but instead a reciprocal process:
behavioral changes shape future brain activity, and brain activity
shapes future behavioral changes.

Timing effects in the interaction between behavioral and
brain development
Our results suggest that timing matters in terms of the interac-
tions between brain and behavioral development. Specifically,
although earlier memory changes predicted later hippocampal
connectivity with certain cortical regions in both young and old
cohorts, only within the younger cohort were early memory
changes related to the functional connectivity from hippocampus
to left IFG and OFG. In contrast, early functional connectivity
with fusiform and left ITG significantly predicted later memory
changes in the older cohort only. We propose two possible
explanations of these timing differences. First, these findings
may result from known differences in the magnitude of age-
related changes in the development of source memory during
childhood. Consistent with previous behavioral studies suggest-
ing accelerated rates of change in source memory before the sixth
year of life (Riggins, 2014), the current study indicates that mem-
ory changes for the 4-to-6-year old cohort were more substantial
than for the 6-to-8-year old cohort. Greater memory changes
may drive greater changes in the brain. This may help explain
why earlier memory changes in the younger cohort predicted
connectivity between the hippocampus and IFG and OFG.

Alternatively, the timing difference may result from known
differences in developmental changes in the hippocampus during
childhood. Studies in humans and animals consistently indicate
that the hippocampal memory network experiences significant
development around the sixth year of life (Serres, 2001; Lavenex
and Lavenex, 2013). Therefore, 4-6 years may be a sensitive pe-
riod for hippocampal development, characterized by greater
plasticity (Tottenham and Sheridan, 2010). This claim is consist-
ent with the argument that shaping functional architecture may
be particularly pronounced during developmental periods when
neural systems are most plastic and amenable to environmental
inputs (Bick and Nelson, 2017). After the sensitive period ends,
the more mature hippocampal memory network may begin driv-
ing developmental changes in memory abilities. This may
explain why iHFC predicted behavioral changes in the older
cohort only. Therefore, we speculate that only after the brain
reaches a certain threshold of maturation can its function reliably
and consistently predict behavior.

The timing effects may also depend on the specific brain
regions exhibiting functional connectivity with the hippocampus.
Early memory changes from 4 to 5 years predicted functional
connectivity between hippocampus and prefrontal regions (IFG

and OFG) at 6 years. However, in the older cohort, functional
connectivity at age 8 years was not predicted by behavior changes
from 6 to 7 years. In contrast, only in the older cohort did iHFC
predict memory changes 2 years later, and this was specific to the
fusiform and ITG. These findings may be because of the different
developmental trajectories of these neural regions. Previous
research has shown that brain development proceeds in a hier-
archical sequence from sensory to association cortices to regions
important for cognitive functions (Gogtay et al., 2004; Shaw et
al., 2008). IFG and OFG are regions associated with higher-order
cognition that mature later than sensory or association regions.
Thus, the findings of the current study are consistent with the
notion that prefrontal regions, such as IFG and OFG, are less
mature, and therefore more plastic, in the younger versus older
cohort. This is also consistent with previous studies indicating
that increased hippocampal functional coupling with the PFC is
related to the development of memory abilities (Qin et al., 2014).
The present findings extend this work and suggest that 4-6 years
may be a sensitive period for the functional integration between
hippocampus and frontal regions. In contrast, fusiform and ITG
are related to visual processing and mature earlier than prefron-
tal regions. Such early maturation might underlie the ability of
fusiform and ITG to predict behavioral changes.

Strengths and limitations
The current study has several strengths. By using an accelerated
longitudinal design, we traced developmental changes in source
memory, iHFC, and relations between them. This design also
allowed us to test timing differences by comparing two cohorts
of children. By focusing on a proposed sensitive period for the
development of source memory, we were able to examine how
the hippocampal memory network is refined within this impor-
tant developmental window and how it relates to improvements
in memory.

This study also has limitations. Because of the limited sample
size, we were unable to examine how changes in functional con-
nectivity over time relate to memory. Also, because of the sample
size, we elected not to conduct whole-brain analyses and instead
relied on ROIs derived from a task-based study involving chil-
dren from the same longitudinal study. Thus, findings with addi-
tional brain regions, not included in the current set of ROIs, may
also exist. Additionally, the ROIs were defined in a task using
only pictorial material. In contrast, source memory in this study
was measured in a task involving both pictorial and verbal mate-
rial. It is unknown whether different brain regions would be acti-
vated to encode contextual information tapping visual versus
verbal modalities. Finally, although a proportion of children in
the sample provided task-based fMRI data to define ROIs, we
did not have enough task-based MRI data to assess developmen-
tal relations between the task-based hippocampal functional con-
nectivity and the connectivity measured without a demanding
task imposed.

In conclusion, our study focused on the mechanisms related
to developmental changes in source memory and the underlying
hippocampal network between 4 and 8 years of age. Results indi-
cate that behavioral experience and brain changes are interactive
processes, such that experience shapes changes in the brain and
the brain shapes changes in behavior. Additionally, our findings
support and extend previous studies of brain development by
showing that timing matters in terms of behavioral changes
molding brain connectivity and such timing differences also
depend on which brain regions are involved. Together, these
findings add critical insight into the development of source
