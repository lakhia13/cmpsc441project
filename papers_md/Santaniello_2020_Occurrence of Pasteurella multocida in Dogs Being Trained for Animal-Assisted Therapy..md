Abstract: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a non-pharmacological therapy aimed at people with
physical and/or mental disabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out interventions that guarantee
its beneﬁts for patients while also avoiding the risk of zoonoses due to contact with the animals or
their mucous membranes. The present study aimed to detect the occurrence of Pasteurella multocida
in the oral cavity of dogs attending a “dog educational centre” and training for AAT interventions.
In addition, some of the potential predictable factors of infection (i.e., age, sex, breed, and living
conditions) were analyzed. In total, 25/200 dogs examined (12.5%; 95% conﬁdence interval = 8.4–18.1%)
were positive for P. multocida, as conﬁrmed by PCR. Sex, breed, and living conditions were risk
factors associated with P. multocida as revealed by the logistic regression analysis. Speciﬁcally,
cross-bred female dogs living prevalently outdoors were signiﬁcantly associated with the presence of
P. multocida (p < 0.05). This study represents the ﬁrst epidemiological survey of the prevalence of
P. multocida in the oral cavity of dogs involved subsequently in AAT interventions, highlighting the
potential risk of P. multocida infection in patients, often belonging to risk categories (e.g., children,
the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals). Therefore, healthcare guidelines could be
suggested to integrate the current literature related to the health check of dogs involved in AAT.
In this way, it could be ensured that, even with bodily contact during AAT, the risk of pathogen
transmission by the co-therapist dog can be avoided.

1. Introduction

The human–animal bond is considered as “a mutually beneﬁcial and dynamic relationship
between people and animals that is inﬂuenced by behaviors that are essential to the health and
well-being of both” [1]. Likewise, the connection with other living organisms (i.e., biophilia) is
considered a fundamental biological human need [1]. As is known, dogs generously contribute to
many aspects of medicine and their relationship with humans is becoming ever closer, more frequent,
and important—particularly concerning physical as well as psychological beneﬁts [2–4]. In this regard,
dogs also play a central role in animal-assisted therapy (AAT) as co-therapists or as a support for
people with physical or mental health problems. Animal-assisted therapy is a goal-oriented, planned,
and structured therapeutic intervention which is directed and/or delivered by health, education,
and human service professionals (e.g., psychologists) and focuses on the socio-emotional functioning

of the patients, either in a group or individual setting [5]. Usually, these therapeutic interventions
are performed in healthcare facilities and are addressed to patients with mental or physical distress,
depression, dementia, autism, or other illnesses [6–8]. During AAT, patients (usually young, old,
or immunocompromised people) interact with dogs through diﬀerent activities of an interspeciﬁc
nature (i.e., petting, brushing, leading on a leash, hiding a ball, etc.) [4]. In this regard, Shen et al. [9]
showed that bodily contact signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the eﬀectiveness of AAT. On the other hand,
during these interventions, because of repeated contact with the dog’s mucosae (e.g., mouth mucosa),
patients can be exposed to zoonotic pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and fungi) transmitted by the
dog through direct contact [3,10–17]. Several reports describe human P. multocida infections acquired
subsequent to close contact with a dog, such as sharing a bed or by licking or sniﬃng [10,16,18].
P. multocida is part of the normal mouth microbiota of mammals; in dogs, its oropharyngeal colonization
rates range from 50% to 66% [15]. Zoonotic transmission usually occurs through a bite from a dog and
by contact with the animal’s saliva or nasal secretions [19–21]. Although cases of P. multocida infection
have been reported more often in people from risk categories, such as young children, the elderly,
pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals [22], case reports of infection have also been
reported in immunocompetent subjects [23–26]. In humans, P. multocida can cause serious infections,
both invasive and localized, in the oral cavity, respiratory tract, and soft tissue, including pharyngitis,
sinusitis, meningitis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, empyema, and abscess [10,18,23–30].

Considering that bodily contact is the main way to ensure the eﬃcacy of AAT, with the high
prevalence of P. multocida in the mouth microbiome of dogs and the possibility of transmission during
the interaction time in the setting, the present study was carried out in order to evaluate the prevalence
of P. multocida in the oral cavities of dogs in training for future interventions of AAT; in addition,
the study aimed to evaluate whether age, sex, breed, and living conditions may represent predictable
factors for the presence of this bacterium in the oral cavity of the dog.

Our evidence could be useful to suggest new guidelines regarding health protocols of dogs
involved in AAT by integrating the information from current literature. In this way, bodily contact and
other activities with dogs during AAT may be ensured while avoiding the risk of pathogens, such as
P. multocida, being transmitted.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Sampling

The present study was performed from May to November 2018 on 250 dogs attending a dog
educational centre in Southern Italy. As a preliminary step, the owners were interviewed using a
pretested, standardized questionnaire to obtain a full history for each dog. The questionnaire was
divided in two main parts: the ﬁrst part included details on the animal’s age, sex, breed, and living
conditions, whereas the second concerned the medical history of the dog (Supplementary Materials).
A homogeneous sample of 200 healthy and not neutered dogs (based on the second part of
questionnaire) was classiﬁed by several categories: two age groups, one representing animals ranging
from three to twelve months old (n = 30) and the other representing animals over twelve months
(n = 170); two sex groups—male (n = 125) and female (n = 75); two breed groups—crossbred (n = 110)
and purebred (n = 90); two living conditions groups—indoor (n = 142) and outdoor (n = 58). Each dog
was individually sampled using sterile, cotton-tipped swabs in the oral cavity (palate, internal gums
and teeth, and tongue). All of the sampled dogs showed an absence of a periodontal procedure.

The animals examined in this study were sampled upon approval by the Animal Ethics and
Welfare Committee of the University of Naples Federico II (protocol number 10418/03 February 2014).

All oxidase-positive, catalase-positive, and small Gram-negative rods or coccobacilli observed under
the light microscope were sub-cultured. The identiﬁcation of P. multocida colonies was ﬁrst performed
biochemically [31,32], and then conﬁrmed colonies were picked for DNA extraction using the PrepMan
sample reagent (PE Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer’s protocol. For P. multocida PCR
identiﬁcation, a pair of primers (Euroﬁns) were used: KMTJB-for TGCCACTTGAAATGGGAAATG and
KMTJB-rev AATAACGTCCAATCAGTTGCG, (available in GenBank) encoding the outer-membrane
protein (KMT-1) [33]. The reaction mixture (50 µL) contained 2 µL of mix oligos, 25 µL of MyTaq
Red Mix (Bioline), and 2 µL of DNA. In total, forty PCR cycles of denaturation at 95
C for 1min,
annealing at 57
C for 10 min were performed in a Model 9600 thermal
cycler (PE Applied Biosystems). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose
gel (Gibco-BRL), stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light, and the results were
recorded using a ChemiImager 5500 (BSI). PCR ampliﬁed without DNA was used as a negative control,
whereas reference P. multocida strains ATCC 43137 were used as positive controls (LGC Promochem).

2.3. Statistical Analyses

The chi-square test was used as a statistical method to determine whether age, sex, breed and living
conditions were predisposing factors for P. multocida positivity. Furthermore, the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel
test was used for the independent variables that showed signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) as well as to obtain
an adjusted odds ratio (OD) with a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI). Statistical analyses were performed
in R [34,35]. Moreover, to gain insight into the diﬀerent factor combinations aﬀecting positivity for
P. multocida, we performed a logistic multivariate regression [36] over all of the factors (age, sex,
breed, and living conditions) in order to identify signiﬁcant predisposing factor combinations with the
following formula:

Log [p/(1 − p)] = β0 + β1 × sex + β2 × breed + β3 × living conditions + β4 × age

(1)

where p is the probability to be positive for P. multocida; β_i are the regression coeﬃcients; coding of
the factors was the following: female = 0, male = 1; cross-breed = 0, pure-breed = 1; indoor = 0,
outdoor = 1; young = 0, old = 1. This analysis was carried out in R [34,35].

3. Results

Out of the 200 dogs examined, 25 subjects (12.5%; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 8.4–18.1%)
were positive for P. multocida, as found by the biochemical identiﬁcation and then conﬁrmed by PCR.
As shown in Table 1, female dogs showed a high prevalence for P. multocida of 22.7%, whereas male dogs
showed a prevalence of 6.4%. This diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). Moreover, crossbred
dogs showed a prevalence of 18.8% (95% CI = 14.0–23.5%) for P. multocida, whereas purebred dogs
showed a prevalence of 5.6% (95% CI = 3.0–9.5%); this diﬀerence was statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05).
Finally, dogs living outdoor showed a prevalence of 22.4% (95% CI = 6.5–11.0%) for P. multocida,
whereas dogs living indoors showed a prevalence of 8.4% (95% CI = 15.0–31.5%); this diﬀerence was
statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence related to age (p > 0.05).
With respect to the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test results, sex and living conditions were potential
predictable risk factors for P. multocida positivity (Table 2).

Regarding the logistic regression analysis, the results conﬁrmed that age was not a predictable risk
factor (old dogs: 21/170 = 0.12; young dogs: 4/30 = 0.13, p > 0.05). On the contrary, sex, breed, and living
condition factors showed signiﬁcant predictable risk values as reported in the corresponding computed
coeﬃcients and p-values in Tables 3 and 4. It should be highlighted, for example, that habitat is the
most important factor because outdoor living can almost triplicate the OR (associated term in Table 3
is 2.870). In summary, P. multocida positivity matched with high probability in female, cross-bred,
outdoor dogs (p < 0.05).

Probabilities are estimated by means of counts and number of actual positives clustered with the

4. Discussion

The present study represents the ﬁrst evaluation of the presence of P. multocida in the oral cavity
of dogs being trained for AAT, in order to avoid the risk of zoonotic transmission to patients involved
in this non-pharmacological therapy. The ﬁndings of the present study showed that P. multocida was
isolated in 25/200 dogs attending a dog educational center. Particularly, sex (female vs. male) and living
conditions (outdoor vs. indoor) were signiﬁcant risk factors for P. multocida positivity as shown in Table 2.
According to the results of our logistic regression analysis (reported in Tables 3 and 4), the match of
female/cross-bred/outdoor dogs showed high probability in the epidemiology of P. multocida infections.
In our opinion, higher positivity in female dogs (22.7%), was not clearly understood considering the
lack of data present in the literature. We can only hypothesize that the periodic change in the physiology
of the reproductive apparatus of females and the diﬀerent behavioral set with respect to males could be
predisposing factors to be further explored. Regarding the greater positivity of crossbreed dogs (18.8%),
it is not possible to give a motivation that has scientiﬁc support. The higher prevalence of P. multocida
in dogs living outdoors (22.4%), might be related to the possible repeat contact with excreta of other
vector animals (i.e., birds, rodents, or wild mammals) [37]. Contrasting data concerning P. multocida
prevalence in the oral cavity of dogs involved in animal-assisted interventions were reported in the
literature. Guay D.R. [15] reported the prevalence of P. multocida in the oral cavity of dogs, with a
range from 50% to 66%. Meanwhile, Lefebvre et al. [16] showed the presence of 7/102 (6.9%) positive
samples in dogs visiting hospitalized people in Ontario. Although it is diﬃcult to speculate on these
data, we can only hypothesize that diﬀerent factors, such as geographic area, recent changes in the
eating and hygiene habits of dogs, the method of sampling, and methods of bacterial identiﬁcation,
may have inﬂuenced the diﬀerent prevalence of each study. In contrast, our study represents the
ﬁrst evaluation of P. multocida risk infection in dogs being trained as co-therapists in AAT. In fact,
this non-pharmacological therapy has been performed in healthcare settings such as hospitals or
healthcare facilities and is often aimed at patients belonging to risk categories (e.g., dialysis patients,
Alzheimer’s disease patients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients) [7,38–40].
In line with the current literature, the zoonotic risk is much higher for immunocompromised people
but is also present for immunocompetent people [23–25,41]. In recent scientiﬁc literature, diﬀerent case
reports of transmission to humans through licking and other forms of contact with dogs have been
reported. Ryan and Feder [27] reported a case of meningitis from P. multocida in a 12-day-old child due
to frequent licking by house dogs. The authors point out that contact with a dog’s saliva by licking can
result in exposure to commensal organisms from its oral cavity, such as P. multocida or other bacteria.
Navarro-Navajas et al. [21] described a clinical case of P. multocida bacteremia in an 88-year-old male

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 6385

6 of 9

patient who became infected by contact with a dog’s saliva, with whom he shared food. The authors
suggested maintaining a high degree of attention especially for immunocompromised patients when
they are in contact with pets. Zarlasht and Khan [26] presented a case of P. multocida bacteremia
that occurred following contact with a dog’s saliva in a 61-year-old immunocompetent male subject.
Therefore, the authors recommended considering this organism as a diﬀerential diagnosis not only in
immunocompromised patients, but also in immunocompetent patients. Maraki et al. [25] described a
case of a P. multocida infection in a 57-year-old immunocompetent male adult who had a decubitus
ulcer of the lower limbs, emphasizing the need to avoid contact between the wound and the saliva of
dogs. Abreu et al. [28] reported the case of a urinary tract infection by P. multocida in an 83-year-old
male person. In addition, they performed a molecular genetic analysis of the P. multocida strains
obtained by the patient and his dog, strongly suggesting a zoonotic transmission of this bacterium.
Bardou et al. [24] reported a case of P. multocida meningitis in a 25-year-old immunocompetent woman
through contact with her dog’s saliva. Although the reported cases of infection are all individual, of the
P. multocida infections, we underlined the variety of infected people (i.e., age, gender, immune status)
and their respective clinical conditions.

Even in AAT, the patients involved have very diﬀerent characteristics both in terms of age and,

above all, in the type of disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s, autism, depression, ADHD, and others).

Considering the few data and more generic guidelines often referenced in the scientiﬁc literature,
our ﬁndings might serve to enrich the general recommendations for the health control of dogs and
related risk assessment in the ﬁeld of AAT [42–45]. In addition, given the prevalence of P. multocida
found in our study (12.5%) and considering the close and necessary contact between co-therapist
dogs and patients, we recommend applying some simple rules of hygiene and behavior: perform a
microbiological analysis approach of the oral cavity in all animals involved in AAT as a sane screening
procedure to preserve the health of patients; keep the dog indoors by avoiding uncontrolled external
access, especially in the days preceding the AAT sessions; disinfect the dog’s coat and especially the
mouth and nostrils (through wipes or patented preparations for the dog); pay attention to the game
equipment and tools that are brought into the setting; avoid contact with other dogs or other animal
species whose clinical history is unknown.

Limits

Our epidemiological investigation has some weaknesses since it only addressed P. multocida
presence when there are other bacterial species of commensal zoonotic agents in the oral cavities of
dogs (i.e., Capnocitophaga canimorsus); the number of dogs sampled was not very large and, at the time
of sampling, the subjects were still in training or being selected; only four predictable infection factors
(i.e., age, sex, breed, and living conditions) were considered; antibiotic sensitivity tests of isolated
strains were not performed; the sampling was not repeated despite suggestions and corrections on
lifestyle habits to limit the possibility of infection from the environment.

5. Conclusions

The dog represents the species most frequently involved in Animal-assisted Interventions (AAIs)
and, particularly, in AAT. Knowing that its health status is an essential way to protect both the health
of patients and the well-being of the animal itself, speciﬁc health checks targeting zoonotic pathogens,
which are sometimes underestimated, should be standardized and become routine for co-therapist
dogs who must interact with patients or people in a healthcare setting. In addition, it is important to
detect P. multocida infections as they represent a latent risk in the case of contact with patients who are
co-infected during AAT, considering that serious and systemic infections are not only determined by
bites and scratches but also by contact with animal secretions, which are a potential transmission source.
Therefore, by our ﬁndings, dogs that are considered to be at high risk of P. multocida infection (i.e.,
female, crossbred, outdoor housed) should be screened for infection as a priority alongside the other
hygiene measures listed above.

Obviously, our evidence is not intended to represent a deterrent to carrying out AAT with dogs
but an invitation to work with them carefully, allowing interaction with the animal while respecting
the safety of the setting. Therefore, clear general hygiene rules should be reported and strictly applied,
particularly in the setting of AAT.
