Abstract 
Background  Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 12‑fold more likely to develop type 2 
diabetes (T2D) 4–6 years after delivery than women without GDM. Similarly, GDM is associated with the development 
of common mental disorders (CMDs) (e.g. anxiety and depression). Evidence shows that holistic lifestyle interventions 
focusing on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and mental well‑being strategies can prevent T2D and CMDs. 
This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention (mHealth) with post‑GDM 
women in preventing T2D and CMDs in a community setting in Singapore.

Methods  The study consists of a 1‑year randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 3‑year follow‑up period. Post‑GDM 
women with no current diabetes diagnosis and not planning to become pregnant will be eligible for the study. In 
addition, participants will complete mental well‑being questionnaires (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep) and their child’s 
socio‑emotional and cognitive development. The participants will be randomised to either Group 1 (Intervention) 
or Group 2 (comparison). The intervention group will receive the “LVL UP App”, a smartphone‑based, conversational 
agent‑delivered holistic lifestyle intervention focused on three pillars: Move More (PA), Eat Well (Diet), and Stress Less 
(mental wellbeing). The intervention consists of health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily “Life 
Hacks” (healthy activity suggestions), slow‑paced breathing exercises, a step tracker (including brisk steps), a low‑
burden food diary, and a journaling tool. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for track‑
ing physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the “HAPPY App”, a mHealth app which 
provides health promotion information about PA, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display body mass 
index, blood pressure, and results from the oral glucose tolerance tests. Short‑term aggregate effects will be assessed 
at 26/27 weeks (midpoint) and a 1‑year visit, followed by a 2, 3, and 4‑year follow‑up period.

Discussion  High rates of progression of T2D and CMDs in women with post‑GDM suggest an urgent need to pro‑
mote a healthy lifestyle, including diet, PA, sleep, and mental well‑being. Preventive interventions through a holistic, 
healthy lifestyle may be the solution, considering the inextricable relationship between physical and psychologi‑
cal health. We expect that holistic lifestyle mHealth may effectively support behavioural changes among women 
with a history of GDM to prevent T2D and CMDs.

Trial status  The protocol study was approved by the National Healthcare Group in Singapore, Domain Specific 
Review Board (DSRB) [2023/00178]; June 2023. Recruitment began on October 18, 2023.

Trial registration  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05949957. The first submission date is June 08, 2023.

Introduction
Background and rationale {6a}

Individuals,  families,  and  societies  worldwide  are 
affected  by  diabetes.  According  to  recent  reports, 
one  in  ten  adults  has  diabetes  worldwide,  account-
ing  for  10.5%  of  the  global  population  [1,  2].  Globally, 
it  is  projected  to  be  700  million  people  with  diabetes, 
with  women  being  343  million  by  2045  [2].  Diabe-
tes  ranks  ninth  for  women  and  eighth  for  men  in  the 
global  ranking  of  disability-adjusted  life  years  (DALYs) 
[3,  4].  There  is  a  parallel  increase  in  obesity  and  type 
2  diabetes  (T2D)  in  the  general  population,  as  well  as 
a  rise  in  gestational  diabetes  mellitus  (GDM)  inci-
dence [5]. GDM affects between 1 and 30% of pregnan-
cies worldwide [6] and is particularly prevalent among 
Asian  women  [7],  showing  distribution  in  the  Middle 
East  (8.8–20.0%),  Southeast  (9.6–18.3)  and  Western 
Pacific  (4.5–20.3%),  respectively  [6].  A  recent  report 
in Singapore shows that GDM prevalence is 23.5% [8]. 
GDM can cause pregnancy and birth complications and 
long-term  chronic  conditions  such  as  cardiometabolic 
disorders  and  T2D  in  both  mother  and  offspring  [9, 
10]. Compared to women with a normoglycemic preg-
nancy, women with a history of GDM are more likely to 
develop T2D [11]. The prospective birth cohort study in 
Singapore,  Growing  Up  in  Singapore  Towards  Healthy 
Outcomes  (GUSTO),  showed  that  the  risk  of  devel-
oping  T2D  is  12-fold  higher  in  Singaporean  women 
4–6 years after their GDM diagnosis [12].

Risk  factors  for  T2D  among  those  with  a  history  of 
GDM  included  greater  pre-pregnancy  Body  Mass  Index 
(BMI), excessive weight gain, unhealthy dietary patterns, 
physical  inactivity,  and  a  short  period  of  lactation  [13]. 
Post-natal risk, such as missing medical assistance in the 
continuum of GDM care after delivery, could be another 
risk  for  progression  to  T2D  among  Asian  mothers  with 
a  history  of  GDM  [7].  In  terms  of  the  pathophysiology, 
GDM  has  several  similarities  to  T2D,  namely  impaired 

insulin sensitivity and dysfunction of the β-cell caused by 
the metabolic stress of pregnancy [5, 14].

Besides T2D and cardiometabolic diseases, current lit-
erature suggests that women with a history of GDM also 
have  a  higher  risk  of  developing  common  mental  disor-
ders  (CMDs)  (depression,  anxiety)  [15,  16].  CMDs  are 
the  most  common  morbidity  in  the  peripartum  (during 
pregnancy and up to 1 year following delivery). Approxi-
mately  one  in  five  women  develop  CMDs  during  preg-
nancy  or  in  the  year  following  delivery  [17],  which  is 
associated  with  adverse  maternal  and  foetal  outcomes 
as  well  as  emotional  and  behavioural  difficulties  in  the 
offspring  [18].  Likewise,  poor  quality  of  sleep  associ-
ated with gestational diabetes can pose significant health 
risks  to  both  mothers  and  their  newborns  [19–21].  Pre-
vious  studies  have  shown  that  women  with  GDM  have 
shorter  sleep  time,  less  efficient  sleep,  and  more  sleep 
disorders and daytime dysfunction [19]. The evidence has 
been  demonstrated  that  sleep  disturbances  can  impair 
glucose  metabolism  by  affecting  insulin  sensitivity  and 
β-cell function, which is also associated with obesity and 
depression  [20].  Thus,  women  with  a  history  of  GDM 
also may present poor sleep quality and CMDs. However, 
effective interventions that aim to improve these women’s 
mental well-being and sleep quality remain scarce.

A  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  about  the  pre-
vention of T2D in women with previous GDM has shown 
that  lifestyle  interventions  produced  only  a  borderline 
reduction in T2D risk (RR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.55–1.03) [22]. 
The  interventions  did  not  focus  on  modifiable  risk  fac-
tors  like  sleep  and  mental  well-being,  which  could  have 
been  addressed  to  improve  the  outcome.  Observational 
studies  suggest  that  approximately  45%  of  GDM  cases 
might  be  preventable  by  the  adoption  of  a  healthy  diet 
and increased physical activity (PA), including psychoso-
cial  factors  (stress,  anxiety,  depression  interventions)  [6, 
23–25].  However,  most  preventative  studies  are  under-
taken in Western countries [21], and it is challenging to 
directly  apply  these  strategies  in  Asian  countries  due  to 

Salamanca‑Sanabria et al. Trials          (2024) 25:443 

Page 3 of 16

differences  in  demographics,  socioeconomics,  ethnicity, 
and cultural factors [7]. A recent systematic review study 
concluded that in most of the studies, the evidence-based 
intervention  might  not  be  culturally  appropriate  for  the 
prevention of T2D in women with a history of GDM [13].
Postpartum  women  often  report  difficulty  engaging 
with  lifestyle  management  interventions  due  to  several 
barriers [26, 27], including multiple face-to-face sessions, 
travel  distances,  time  constraints,  and  cost  are  some 
factors  [26,  28]  that  may  be  alleviated  by  technological 
advancements [29]. Thus, lifestyle interventions delivered 
through mobile health (mHealth) interventions represent 
a  feasible,  affordable  and  scalable  solution  for  the  pre-
vention of T2D and CMDs among women with a history 
of  GDM  [30].  While  several  mHealth  lifestyle  interven-
tion  studies  have  been  conducted  to  prevent  NCDs  [31, 
32] and CMDs [33] few have taken a holistic approach to 
improving health and mental wellbeing. The inextricable 
link between physical and psychological health [2, 4, 22–
24]  highlights  the  combined  effects  of  holistic  interven-
tions integrating body and mind may have a greater total 
effect  than  any  single  intervention  in  preventing  T2D 
and CMD [34]. The LvL UP is a scalable holistic mHealth 
intervention to prevent NCDs and CMDs in Asian popu-
lations [35]. The intervention has been informed by lead-
ing  evidence-  and  theory-based  frameworks  in  mental 
health  [36]  and  behaviour  change  [36]  to  deliver  moti-
vational  interviewing-inspired  digital  coaching  via  con-
versational  agent  and  behavioural  tools  centred  around 
three core pillars: Move More, Eat Well, Stress Less. The 
intervention  has  undergone  rigorous  development  and 
refinement, including feasibility and user-centred design 
studies  (unpublished  data)  to  assess  its  technical  feasi-
bility  and  acceptability,  but  has  not  yet  been  tested  for 
effectiveness.

Objectives {7}

This  study  aims  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  a  scal-
able  smartphone-delivered  holistic  lifestyle  coaching 
intervention  for  the  prevention  of  T2D  and  CMDs  with 
post-GDM Asian women from the community setting in 
Singapore. We have five specific objectives:

Objective  1:  To  carry  out  a  1-year  randomised  con-
trol trial (RCT) followed by a 3-year follow-up period 
with post-GDM women from the community setting 
in Singapore.
Objective 2: To examine the potential impacts of the 
proposed intervention on the health and mental well-
being of women and their children.
Objective  3:  To  determine  the  diabetes  risk  of  the 
participants over a 3-year follow-up period.

Objective  4:  To  explore  the  potential  economic 
impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g. healthcare 
expenditures)
Objective  5:  To  study  the  importance  of  gut  micro-
biota  and  epigenetic  factors  in  changes  in  glucose 
metabolism.

Trial design {8}

This study is a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
with  3  years  of  follow-up.  We  will  conduct  a  two-arm 
individually  randomised 
single  parallel  assignment 
equal  allocation  control  trial  on  n = 400  women  with 
a  history  of  GDM.  It  will  compare  the  aggregate  effects 
of  the  Intervention  group  (receiving  a  holistic  lifestyle 
mHealth  intervention  (LvLUP  App),  Sleep  tracker,  Oura 
ring/Oura App and psychoeducation to promote healthy 
lifestyle  (Happy  App))  and  (comparison  group  (Happy 
App  (psychoeducation  only),  Oura  ring  and  Oura  App) 
at  26/27  weeks,  and  1-year  visit.  After  completing  the 
1-year  RCT  period,  both  groups  will  be  followed  up  in 
years  2,  3,  and  4.  We  hypothesise  that  the  intervention 
will  reduce  the  risk  of  T2D/pre-diabetes  and  CMDs  in 
post-GDM women.

of participants to be re-contacted and re-consent for the 
ancillary study following DSRB approval.

Interventions
Explanation for choice of comparators {6b}

mHealth  may  provide  practical  and  scalable  support  to 
women adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The 
effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting lifestyle 
behaviours  has  been  demonstrated  [31,  34,  37].  More 
recently, studies have supported that prevention and pro-
motion request more than one pillar, meaning that holis-
tic lifestyle behaviours, such as PA, diet, sleep, and mental 
well-being,  are  more  effective  in  parallel  [34].  Studies 
have shown that education alone is insufficient to support 
individuals in changing their lifestyles, and it is important 
to incorporate techniques and behavioural strategies that 
facilitate  and  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  interven-
tions [31, 34, 37]. Therefore, we propose to compare two 
mHealth  interventions,  the  intervention  group  (LvL  UP 
App,  Happy  App,  and  Oura  Ring)  and  the  comparison 
group (HAPPY App and Oura Ring). The LvL UP App is 
based on evidence-based strategies and interactive tools 
developed in Singapore [35]. The HAPPY App is available 
to every eligible participant (both groups) in the trial; it 
provides  public  holistic  health  recommendations  and 
displays participants’ health data measured during study 
visits over time. Also, the Oura ring is a sleep tracker that 
includes  heart  rate  variability,  and  a  step  tracker  will  be 
provided to both groups.

Intervention description {11a}

The comparison and intervention group will be assigned 
to holistic lifestyle mHealth interventions. The compari-
son  group  (Happy  App  and  Oura  ring)  will  receive  only 
psychoeducation  to  promote  a  healthy  lifestyle  through 

the  HAPPY  App  and  sleep  tracking  using  an  Oura  ring 
and  associated  App.  The  Happy  App  was  developed  by 
the  Singapore  Institute  for  Clinical  Sciences  (SICS);  it 
encompasses only educational content on lifestyles based 
on  resources  from  the  Singapore  Health  Promotion 
Board,  including  information  about  diet  intake,  physical 
activity,  sleep,  and  mental  well-being.  The  HAPPY  app 
also  displays  health  outcome  data  collected  during  the 
study visits (e.g. body weight, blood pressure, fasting glu-
cose, and 2-h 75 g OGTT). The Oura Ring is an activity-
tracking  wearable  that  monitors  physical  activity,  sleep, 
and  heart  rate  variability,  which  can  be  synced  with  the 
Oura App.

The intervention group (LvL UP App, Happy App, and 
Oura Ring) will receive the same Happy App, Oura Ring 
and  Oura  App,  with  the  additional  LvL  UP  App  version 
2.0. The  LvL  UP  App  has  been  developed  by  the  Future 
Health Technologies Programme at the Singapore ETH-
Centre  (SEC)  for  iOS  and  Android.  It  is  designed  to  be 
culturally relevant in Singapore and is based on evidence-
based  behavioural  strategies  [35].  A  separate  paper[35] 
describes  the  conceptual  model,  development  process, 
and  characteristics  of  LvLUP  version  1.0.  In  this  study, 
we will use an updated 2.0. version. The LvL UP App 2.0 
is  a  smartphone-delivered  holistic  lifestyle  intervention 
focusing on three core pillars: eat well (diet), move more 
(PA),  and  stress  less  (mental  well-being),  including  sleep 
content in each pillar delivered through a coaching health 
and tools paradigm.

LvL UP App: coaching health

The  participants  assigned  to  LvL  UP  will  receive  weekly 
motivational  interview-inspired  coaching  sessions  from 
a  digital  coach  (conversational  agent;  CA)  on  topics 
related  to  the  core  intervention  pillars.  Coaching  ses-
sions  are  text-based  dialogues  between  the  participant 
and the CA based on predefined rules, and each session 
lasts  between  pillars,  which  are  recommended  in  a  pre-
defined order, although participants can choose the order 
and topic if they wish. There are eight coaching sessions 
per pillar, which are recommended in a predefined order, 
although  participants  can  choose  the  order  and  topic  if 
they wish. The participant starts the intervention with a 
welcome dialogue, which introduces the LvL UP App and 
assesses the participant’s needs in each of the core pillars 
using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) [38], a 
Modified Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) based on 
dietary  recommendations,  and  the  International  Physi-
cal  Activity  Questionnaire-Short  Form  (IPAQ-SF)  [39]. 
Based on the participant’s needs, a starting pillar is rec-
ommended, but the participant can still choose the pillar 
they  wish  to  focus  on.  Following  the  welcome  dialogue, 

Salamanca‑Sanabria et al. Trials          (2024) 25:443 

Page 5 of 16

the  participants  complete  two  short  sessions  to  iden-
tify their perceived values and strengths, which are later 
reflected  to  the  participant  by  the  CA  during  coaching 
sessions.

LvL UP App: tools

Additionally, the LvL UP App includes different tools that 
complement each pillar, including a set of self-regulatory 
behaviour  change  techniques,  actionable  habit-forming 
suggestions,  and  a  slow-paced  breathing  training  mini-
game.  The  self-regulatory  tools  include  a  low-burden 
image tracking food diary (MakanMemo), a step tracker 
(StepLah!)  that  displays  steps  collected  by  Apple  Health 
(iOS) or GoogleFit (Android) and allows users to set and 
track  step  goals,  including  brisk  steps  (120  steps/min  or 
higher),  and  a  Journal  with  different  templates  inspired 
by  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  to  support  mental 
well-being.  Life  Hacks  are  actionable  tips  for  improving 
healthy habits and are designed to be easily executed dur-
ing  the  daily  routine.  They  operate  on  the  premise  that 
taking  small,  concrete  actions  can  accumulate  and  lead 
to noticeable changes over time. Finally, Breeze is a slow-
paced  breathing  training  mini-game  that  uses  breathing 
data collected by the smartphone microphone to move a 
sailboat along a river in real time [40].

The  intended  use  of  the  LvL  UP  intervention  is  to 
complete  weekly  coaching  sessions  and  use  the  tools 
daily.  Gamification  is  built  into  the  App  whereby  a  puz-
zle piece is awarded for completed activities to fill up the 
LvL  UP  Shield.  Once  the  shield  is  filled,  the  participant 
progresses  to  the  next  level  and  the  shield  resets.  There 
are three levels in total. The LvL UP App delivers remind-
ers and prompts (push notifications) related to interven-
tion actions to encourage the participant to complete the 
intervention as intended.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated 
interventions {11b}

The  participant  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  study  if  she 
becomes pregnant during the 1-year intervention period. 
If a participant becomes pregnant during the 3-year fol-
low-up  period,  she  will  skip  the  follow-up  visit  for  the 
year and return to the subsequent follow-up visit(s) post-
pregnancy. In the same way, if a participant is diagnosed 
with  T2D  by  her  doctor  during  the  1-year  intervention 
period, she will be invited to complete the endpoint study 
visit measures before being withdrawn from the study. If 
the participant is diagnosed with T2D by the study team 
during  the  follow-up  visits,  she  will  be  removed  after 
completing that visit.

Strategies to assess and improve adherence 
to interventions {11c}

User adherence in mHealth interventions varied based on 
user-related,  content-related,  and  technology  (personal-
ise remainders, user-friendly, technically stable App, per-
sonal support, and gamification features) related barriers 
and facilitators of engagement [41, 42]. The intervention 
group  [LvL  UP]  will  receive  notifications  and  reminders 
about the coaching session’s date and time, daily random 
lifehack,  and  motivational  messages  to  engage  with  the 
LvL  UP  App.  Additionally,  a  dashboard  link  to  monitor 
the  participant’s  live  activity  regarding  last-time  inter-
action,  tools  used,  and  the  current  level  is  considered 
to  reach  up  to  support  adherence  with  the  participants. 
Thus, the following three strategies will be implemented: 
calling participants who have not interacted for 2 weeks 
with  the  LvL  UP  App  after  baseline;  texting  the  partici-
pants who have low interaction (e.g. using the App once/
twice for 2 weeks), and sending automatic SMS 3, 5 and 
7 weeks after the baseline visit to encourage them to use 
the App.

The  HAPPY  App  will  detect  the  number  of  logged 
entries  and  the  last  interaction  with  the  app.  A  manual 
schedule reminder will be sent by the App if the partici-
pant has not read the suggested articles or documents.

Relevant concomitant care permitted or prohibited 
during the trial {11d}

The participants will be excluded if they have enrolled in 
a concurrent lifestyle intervention research study during 
the  study.  However,  trial  participants  can  receive  con-
comitant  treatment  (e.g.  psychotherapy,  pharmacology), 
which will be assessed during the follow-up period.

Provisions for post‑trial care {30}

Access to the Happy App will continue for the 3-year fol-
low-up period after the trial for all the participants.

Outcomes {12}

Table  1  shows  the  outcomes  and  timeline  of  the  study. 
The primary outcome will be the onset of T2D/confirmed 
by a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) over a 
4-year study period. OGTT will be done at the screening 
visit, year 1 visit, and follow-up visits in years 2, 3, and 4. 
Secondary outcomes include (a) onset of impaired fasting 
glucose  and  impaired  glucose  tolerance;  (b)  changes  in 
cardiometabolic  variables  (body  weight,   HbA1c,  insulin, 
blood lipids, blood pressure), and (c) changes in women’s 
body  composition  as  assessed  by  bioelectrical  imped-
ance analysis (BIA). Secondary measures will be taken at 
baseline visits, middle point, year 1, and 2, 3, and 4-year 
follow-up period.

Additionally, we will assess changes in women’s mental 
well-being by completing the following questionnaires at 
all study visits:

Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI-II):  A  21-item  self-
reported rating inventory using a 3-point Likert scale that 
measures symptoms and severity of depression, classified 

as follows: minimal (0–13); mild (14–19); moderate (20–
28); and severe (29–63). The BDI-II internal consistency 
as  measured  by  Cronbach’s  alpha  ranges  from  0.87  to 
0.93 [43].

State-Trait  Anxiety  Inventory  (STAI):  A  40-item  self-
report  questionnaire  using  a  4-point  Likert  scale.  The 

 
Salamanca‑Sanabria et al. Trials          (2024) 25:443 

Page 7 of 16

STAI  measures  two  types  of  anxiety  —  state  anxiety 
and trait anxiety, which are classified as no or low anxi-
ety (20–37), moderate anxiety (38–44), and high anxiety 
(45–80).  Internal  consistency  coefficients  for  the  scale 
have ranged from 0.86 to 0.95 [44].

Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ): 
A 36-item self-report measure designed to identify the 
cognitive  emotion  regulation  strategies  (or  cognitive 
coping  strategies)  someone  uses  after  having  experi-
enced adverse events or situations. It is commonly used 
to assess individual differences in the cognitive regula-
tion  of  emotions  in  response  to  stressful,  threatening, 
or  traumatic  life  events.  Internal  consistency  ranges 
from 0.72 and 0.83 [45].

Subjective  Happiness  Scale  (SHS):  A  4-item  self-
report  measure  to  assess  an  individual’s  overall  happi-
ness. Internal consistency ranges from 0.79 to 0.94 [46].
WHO-5  Wellbeing  Index  (WHO-5):  A  5-item  self-
reported  questionnaire  that  aims  to  assess  mental 
wellbeing  over  the  last  2  weeks.  The  WHO-5  shows 
reliability across countries between 0.86 and 0.96 [47].

Perceived  Stress  Scale  (PSS-4):  A  brief  self-report 
measure  of  the  extent  to  which  recent  life  events  are 
considered  stressful.  The  PSS-4  has  demonstrated 
acceptable  criterion  validity  and  internal  consistency 
(α = 0.72) [48].

The short Form Health Survey (SF-36): Indicates overall 
health status; it aims to assess the impact of clinical and 
social interventions on quality of life in several domains. 
The SF-36 has shown a reliability of 0.90 [49].

Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ): The HLQ exam-
ines  an  individual’s  understanding,  access  and  engage-
ment  with  health  information  and  health  services.  The 
HLQ Cronbach’s alpha has shown an internal consistency 
of 0.87 [50].

Moreover,  changes  in  women’s  sleep  will  be  assessed 

using the following measurements:

Morningness-Eveningness  Questionnaire 

(MEQ):  A 
19-item  MEQ  aims  to  assess  morningness  and  evening-
ness where questions are asked preferentially, i.e. asking 
respondents  to  indicate  when,  for  example,  they  would 
prefer  to  wake  up  or  start  sleep,  rather  than  when  they 
do. MEQ internal consistency is 0.82 [51].

Pittsburgh  Sleep  Quality  Index  (PSQI):  Measures  the 
quality  and  patterns  of  sleep-in  adults.  It  differenti-
ates  “poor”  from  “good”  sleep  quality  by  measuring 
seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep 
latency,  sleep  duration,  habitual  sleep  efficiency,  sleep 
disturbances,  use  of  sleeping  medications,  and  daytime 
dysfunction  over  the  last  month.  The  PSQI  Cronbach’s 
alpha has shown good internal consistency ranging from 
0.64 to 0.83 [52].

Furthermore,  changes  in  the  health  and  well-being  of 
the  women’s  children  will  be  collected.  Only  children 
born during a GDM pregnancy will be considered in this 
study. The following measurements will be used:

Cognitive  Home  Environment  Questionnaire  (StimQ): 
The  StimQ-toddler  (age  12–35  months)/StimQ-pre-
school  (for  age  36  –  72  months)  is  designed  to  identify 
the  different  types  of  toys  and  games  that  children  have 
in  the  home  and  the  kinds  of  activities  that  mother  and 
child  do  together  [53].  The  StimQ  has  demonstrated 
good internal and external reliability (α = 0.85) [54].

Ages & Stages Questionnaires-3 (ASQ-3) (1–66 months): 
The  ASQ-3  development  screening  tool  assesses  chil-
dren’s  communication,  autonomy,  compliance,  adaptive 
functioning,  affect,  and  interaction  with  people.  ASQ-3 
is  a  reliable  and  valid  instrument  with  a  test–retest  reli-
ability  of  92%,  a  sensitivity  of  87.4%  and  a  specificity  of 
95.7% [55].

Behaviour  Rating  Inventory  of  Executive  Functions-2 
(BRIEF-2)  parent  form:  BRIEF-2  is  designed  for  use  in 
medical  and  educational  settings  to  estimate  the  global 
executive  function  of  children/youth  and  determine 
whether a comprehensive assessment is appropriate (age 
5–18  years).  BRIEF-2  has  shown  reliability  coefficients 
ranging between 0.8 and 0.9 [56].

Behavioural  and  Emotional  Screening  System  (BASC-
3-BESS)  Parent  Form:  This  screens  children  and  ado-
lescents’  behavioural  and  emotional  strengths  and 
weaknesses  (age  3–18  years  11  months).  BASC-3  BESS 
has high internal consistency at 0.80 [57].

Changes  in  the  child’s  sleep  will  be  assessed  at  the 
baseline  visit  and  the  first-year  visit.  The  following  is  a 
description of child sleep questionnaires:

The  Brief  Infant  Sleep  Questionnaire-Revised  Short 
Form (BISQ-R-SF): A parent-reported toddler (0–3 years) 
sleep  over  the  prior  1  week,  assessing  sleep  patterns, 
ecology,  and  parental  perceptions  of  sleep.  The  BISQ-R 
indicates excellent reliability at 0.80 [58].

Children’s  Sleep  Habits  Questionnaire  (CSHQ)  Short 
Form  (SF)version:  The  SF-CSHQ  assesses  the  frequency 
of  children’s  behaviours  associated  with  common  pae-
diatric  sleep  difficulties  for  children  between  48  and 
72  months.  The  SF-CSHQ  has  been  validated,  showing 
Internal  consistency  coefficients  ranging  from  0.90  to 
0.94 [59].

After  completing  the  1-year  RCT  period,  both  groups 
will be followed up for 3 years. During the follow-up vis-
its,  body  measurements,  OGTT,  bio-sampling,  and  data 
collection  will  be  conducted,  and  the  questionnaires 
listed above.

Additionally, the intervention group will also complete 

the following questionnaires through the LvL UP App:

symptoms. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0–3), 
and scores range from 0 to 27. The score can be used to 
describe  a  patient’s  symptoms  in  one  of  the  five  catego-
ries: none (0–2), mild (3–5), moderate (6–8), and severe 
(9–12), The PHQ-4 has been shown to have good internal 
reliability (Cronbach alpha = 0.82) [38].

Modified  Food  Frequency  Questionnaire  (MFFQ):  A 
7-item  self-report  checklist  of  food  and  beverages  with 
a frequency response section based on My Healthy Plate 
Singapore[60].

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short 
Form (IPAQ-SF): A self-report measure assesses the type 
of intensity of physical activity and sitting  time[39]. The 
IPAQ-SF  has  shown  a  moderate  internal  consistency  of 
0.647 [61, 62].

Screening survey overview and follow‑up

The  screening  surveys  will  include  questions  of  8  types: 
(i)  socio-demographics,  (ii)  GDM  and  family  history  of 
diabetes,  (iii)  medical  history,  (iv)  lifestyle,  (v)  dietary, 
(vi) diabetes awareness, (vii) paternal demographics and 
health  and  (viii)  child  demographics  and  health  (see 
Table 2). Those surveys will also be completed in baseline 
and 1-year visits (see Table 1).

Participants timeline {13}

The  participants’  flow  for  the  trial  is  outlined  in  Fig.  1. 
Once  participants  are  identified  through  one  of  the 
recruiting  methods,  they  will  be  invited  to  the  SICS 
clinic  for  screening,  in  which  a  consent  form  will  be 
explained  and  signed,  and  OGTT  test,  height,  weight, 
blood  pressure  measures,  HbA1c  (finger  proc  test)  and 

sociodemographic  survey  will  be  completed.  Those 
who  are  eligible  will  be  randomised  to  one  of  the  two 
arms  (comparison  or  intervention  group)  and  will  sub-
sequently be asked to take follow-up height, weight and 
blood  pressure  measurements,  BIA,  report  the  child’s 
height  and  weight,  fasting  blood  draw,  collection  of  the 
buccal  swab,  saliva,  and  stool  sample,  and  complete 
questionnaires  for  the  mother  and  their  child  at  mid-
point  (26/27  weeks)  visit,  and  year  one  visit  after  ran-
domisation.  After  the  midpoint  assessments,  additional 
interventions  will  be  delivered  via  the  HAPPY  App  to 
subjects  in  the  intervention  group  who  require  further 
recommendations to improve their BMI or manage their 
body  weight.  During  the  3  year-followed-up  periods, 
participants  will  be  asked  to  complete  the  following:  (a) 
OGTT test; (b) height, weight and blood pressure meas-
urements;  (c)  BIA;  (d)  fasting  blood  draw;  (e)  collection 
of the buccal swab, saliva and stool samples; (f ) reported 
child’s height and weight; (g) complete mother and child 
questionnaires;  (h)  issue  of  Oura  Ring  (8  weeks);  and 
(i) 14-day e-Diary recording in year 2, 3 and 4 visit. The 
schedule of enrolment, intervention, and assessments for 
the trial is outlined in Fig. 2.

Sample size {14}
Expected number of participants

The  sample  size  is  estimated  based  on  the  cumulative 
diabetes risk identified from the GUSTO study [12]. We 
assume  groups  of  equal  size,  with  a  significance  level 
of  0.05%  and  a  power  of  80%.  Additionally,  we  consider 
a  median  survival  time  of  6  years  for  the  non-interven-
tion  group  (based  on  GUSTO  data),  a  follow-up  period 
of  3  years,  and  an  expected  50%  reduction  in  the  risk 
of  developing  T2D  for  the  intervention  group  (hazard

ratio = 0.5).  These  assumptions  yield  a  cumulative  event 
rate  of  0.22  for  the  comparison  group  and  0.12  for  the 
intervention group. Considering a 20% censoring rate, we 
calculate a sample size of 189 for the intervention group 
and  188  for  the  comparison  group,  aiming  for  a  total  of 
65 events over the study period[63].

Recruitment {15}

The study protocol was approved by the National Health-
care  Group  in  Singapore,  Domain  Specific  Review 
Board.  There  are  four  avenues  of  recruitment.  The  first 
is  contacting  participants  from  a  previous  pilot  study 
conducted  by  the  same  research  team  in  this  proto-
col  [64].  The  second  avenue  is  recruiting  participants 
using  snowball  sampling  (e.g.  friends,  family),  the  third 
is  via  electronic  flyer  invitation  through  corporate 
e-mails (National University Healthcare System (NUHS) 
and  Agency  for  Science,  Technology  and  Research 
(A*STAR)), and the fourth is advertising on social media 
(e.g.  LinkedIn,  Instagram,  Facebook  advertisements). 
Interested  individuals  will  contact  the  study  team  via 
phone  or  e-mail.  The  study  team  will  explain  the  study 
and  answer  any  questions  raised.  Potential  participants 
will  be  invited  to  attend  a  screening  visit  for  informed 
consent  and  screening  procedures.  Those  who  are 
screened passed will be scheduled to attend baseline and 
midpoint visits (26/27 weeks), year 1, and follow-up visit 
periods  in  years  2,  3,  and  4.  All  the  participants  will  be 
able to provide written informed consent.

Assignment intervention: allocation
Sequence generation {16a}

A  total  of  400  women  will  be  stratified  and  randomised 
based  on  prognosis  factors  to  either  group  1  (interven-
tion) or group 2 (control) based on 1:1 allocation using R 
statistical software.

Concealment mechanism {16b}

is  concealed 

The  allocation 
in  that  the  allocation 
sequence  is  automatically  generated  in  R  software  and 
simultaneous with the assignment.

Implementation {16c}

The  allocation  sequence  will  automatically  be  generated 
in the Block Rand R software at the end of the baseline, 
and  a  screen  will  show  participants  to  which  group  she 
has been assigned.

Assignment of interventions: blinding
Who will be blinded {17a}

Given the nature of the study design, blinding of partici-
pants  and  research  personnel  will  not  be  possible.  The 
study team will instruct the participants in the interven-
tion and comparison groups to download the Apps, and 
each participant will be provided with a unique identifi-
cation code.

Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}

In the case of high depression scores on the BDI, includ-
ing  item  9  (suicidal  ideation)  and  anxiety  on  the  STAI, 
the  participant  will  be  flagged  and  reported  to  research 
coordinators, who will contact the participant to provide 
additional  referral  and  helpline  resources  in  Singapore. 
Similarly,  scores  that  reveal  a  potential  developmental 
delay  in  the  child  measured  by  the  ASQ-3  will  be  noti-
fied to the mother, and a referral will be made for further 
evaluation.

Data collection and management
Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes{18a}

The  baseline,  midpoint  visit  (26/27  weeks),  1-year  visit, 
and  3-year  follow-up  assessments  will  be  administered 
on-site  through  the  Recap  platform  assisted  by  research 
coordinators. The REDCap will be used for all the meas-
urements  and  will  follow  complex  skip  logic  developed 
for this study, based on participants’ responses to reduce 
respondent  burden  and  increase  the  completeness  and 
accuracy of responses.

The intervention group randomised to the LvL UP App 
will  collect  objective  and  self-reported  scales  from  the 
mHealth App throughout the intervention.

Plans to promote participant retention and complete 
follow‑up {18b}

Participants  will  be  reimbursed  for  their  time,  incon-
venience and transportation costs as follows: (a) screen-
ing  visit  —  S$20;  (b)  completion  of  baseline  study  visit 
—  S$80;  (c)  completion  of  midpoint  study  visit  —  S$40; 
(d) completion of year 1 study visit — S$80; (e) comple-
tion of level 1 to level 3 digital coaching sessions via LvL 
UP App (applicable to participants in intervention group) 
will be a total of S$120 and S$40 per level of completion; 
(f ) completions for all three study visits, participants will 
be given an additional S$80 as bonus; and (g) completion 
of year 2, 3 and 4 yearly visit the participants will receive 
S$80 per visit. The research team will call the participants 
to remind them to attend the visits.

Additionally,  the 

intervention  group  will  receive 
reminders  from  the  LvL  UP  App  regarding  the  day  and 
time  of  the  coaching  session  and  daily  random  lifehack 
from any of the pillars.

Data management {19}

The Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences (SICS) team 
will  maintain  a  master  dataset  for  all  participants  who 
were  referred  to  the  project  for  recruitment,  along  with 
a record of whether they withdrew before or after com-
pleting the screening and baseline measurements or after 
initiating the intervention, were considered ineligible for 
participation, or were terminated from the study or con-
ducted  the  study.  Protection  of  participant  privacy  con-
cerning  biological  samples  and  questionnaire  data  will 
be  achieved  by  assigning  each  participant  a  study  iden-
tification  number  and  then  creating  a  separate  de-iden-
tified  file.  Anonymised  data  from  the  participants  will 
be shared between SEC and SICS through a secure AWS 
server. All data analyses will be carried out with the de-
identified data file.

Confidentiality {27}

Identifiable  individual  participant  information  obtained 
from this study is confidential, and disclosure to non-rel-
evant third parties is prohibited. Participant confidential-
ity will be further ensured by assigning each participant 
a  unique  participant  identification  code  for  anonymised 
data entry and sample identification. All computer entry 
and networking programs will be done with coded num-
bers only.

with outcome measurement (at the three follow-up time 
points) as the dependent variable and based on the inten-
tion-to-treatment (ITT) principle.

Multiple  linear  regressions  will  determine  the  relation-
ship  between  outcome  measures  and  predictors,  adjust-
ing  for  potential  confounders.  Multiple  linear  regression 
analyses  will  estimate  the  effects  between  groups  at  the 
end  point  follow-up.  Generalised  estimating  equations 
and mixed effect models will be used for longitudinal data 
analysis. A p-value of < 0.05 will be considered statistically 
significant. Correction for multiple tests will be performed. 
All  statistical  analyses  will  be  conducted  using  the  R  pro-
gram  or  STATA  for  Windows  (Stata  Corporation).  The 
treatment effect within and between the two groups will be 
assessed using the Cohen d statistics [65].

Interim analyses {21b}

Interim analyses will be conducted to examine initial trial 
efficacy  and  safety  outcomes.  Frequencies  (percentages), 
means  (standard  deviations),  or  medians  (interquartile 
ranges) will be used to summarise the data collected from 
questionnaires  and  surveys.  Statistical  tests  will  be  per-
formed, e.g. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
variables, and two independent sample t-tests or ANOVA 
for continuous variables. Nonparametric tests will be used 
as deemed fit. For binary outcomes, the strength of associa-
tions between independent and dependent variables will be 
assessed by odds ratio estimated in logistic regression mod-
els.  Crude  associations  will  be  evaluated  using  univariate 
models. Subsequently, associations will be evaluated using 
multivariable models adjusted for potential confounders.

Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) 
{20b}

We  will  carry  out  additional  analyses  that  evaluate  the 
effect  of  the  intervention  on  the  children  born  to  the 
women during the GDM pregnancy with a focus on cog-
nitive and socio-emotional development (ASQ-3, BASC-3-
BESS, BRIEF, StimQ) and sleep (BISQ-R-SF, CSHQ) using 
linear mixed models (LMM) with outcome measurements 
(baseline  and  the  three  follow-up  time  points)  based  on 
intention-to-treat (ITT).

Descriptive  statistics  will  be  used  to  establish  the  inter-
vention  response  rate  based  on  the  number  of  coaching 
sessions  completed,  logins  into  the  App,  and  estimated 
time spent.

Statistical methods
Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes 
{20a}
Analysis of aggregate intervention effects

The  primary  continuous  outcome  for  the  onset  of  dia-
betes will be analyzed with linear mixed models (LMM) 

Methods in analysis to handle protocol non‑adherence 
and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c}

Intention-to-treat  analysis  will  be  used  to  examine  trial 
efficacy.  Total  scores  will  be  modelled  using  fixed  effects 
of time, intervention group, interaction between time and

Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant‑level 
data and statistical code {31c}

The anonymized datasets analysed during the current study 
and  statistical  code  are  available  from  the  corresponding 
author on reasonable request, as is the full protocol.

Oversight and monitoring
Composition of the coordinating centre and trial steering 
committee {5d}

The study team will have overall responsibility for moni-
toring  the  integrity  of  the  study  and  participant  safety. 
The  study  team  will  monitor  consent  procedures,  and 
safety plans prior to study initiation, amendments there-
after, and monitoring study progress, in terms of recruit-
ment  and  retention  of  participants,  adverse  events,  and 
protocol deviations.

Composition of the data monitoring committee, its role 
and reporting structure {21a}

The committee comprises research coordinators (RCs), a 
data manager, co-investigators, and the principal investi-
gator (JGE). RCs are responsible for electronic data cap-
ture following the standard operating procedure, and the 
data  manager  monitors  data  collection.  The  data  man-
ager  will  raise  queries  with  RCs  during  data  monitor-
ing. The data manager prepares data exports for monthly 
review  and  reports  to  the  principal  investigator  and 
co-investigators.

Adverse event reporting and harms {22}

The Principal Investigator (PI) (JGE) will manage the data 
and safety monitoring after participant enrolment. In the 
event of any adverse events or safety issues, appropriate 
reporting  will  be  made  to  DSRB  accordingly.  Regarding 
the  questionnaires,  we  have  the  following  monitoring 
plan: (a)BDI-II: participants who exhibit suicidality idea-
tion (item 9) or have scored 29 or above (severe depres-
sion)  will  be  offered  a  clinical  referral.  If  the  participant 
declines the referral, she will be provided with local hel-
pline  contact  numbers  (Samaritans  of  Singapore  and 
Institute  of  Mental  Health);  (b)  STAI:  for  participants 
who  exhibit  high  anxiety  with  a  score  of  45  or  above  in 
the STAI, the study team will provide a local helpline con-
tact  number (Singapore Association for Mental Health). 
Additionally, the PHQ-4 will be completed by the LvL UP 
App participants (intervention group) with a score of 9 or 
higher  (severe  anxiety  depression);  the  LvL  UP  App  will 
provide  information  regarding  mental  health  services  in 
Singapore, including local helplines. The study team will 
follow up with the participant if she wishes to get a clini-
cal referral. Finally, based on the ASQ-3, if a child shows 
scores  suggesting  developmental  delay,  we  will  discuss 

with  the  participant  if  she  has  any  concerns  and  would 
like a referral for clinical follow-up.

Biological  samples  will  be  collected  through  blood 
tests,  which  will  be  analyzed  by  an  accredited  lab  pro-
viding the normal reference range of the lab results. The 
PI  (JGE)  will  review  blood  test  results.  For  all  abnormal 
blood  test  results  and  incidental  findings  discovered 
during  the  study  period,  the  study  PI  will  determine  if 
the findings are clinically significant and actionable. The 
study PI will sign a referral letter to seek primary health-
care.  Subsequently,  a  delegated  study  team  member  will 
contact  the  participant  to  relay  the  internal  findings  on 
behalf  of  the  study  PI.  Participants  who  agree  to  be  re-
identified  and  notified  of  the  internal  findings  will  be 
contacted  at  their  primary  contact  number  provided  in 
the  consent  form.  The  referral  letter  will  be  emailed  to 
her. If the participant is uncontactable on her direct con-
tact  number,  her  next  of  kin  listed  on  the  consent  form 
will  be  contacted.  If  the  participant  and  next  of  kin  are 
not  contactable  after  1  month,  the  referral  letter  will  be 
sent  directly  to  the  participant’s  home  address.  In  the 
case incidental findings meet the study exclusion criteria, 
the affected participant will be informed and withdrawn 
from the study.

For  the  rest  of  the  study  measures/questionnaires, 
there is no clinical validation available. Hence no applica-
ble management plan will be carried out.

Frequency and plans for monitoring trial conduct {23}

Study  activities,  including  those  related  to  consent,  ran-
domisation,  data  collection,  and  intervention,  will  be 
monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis.  The  data  management 
team will monitor the data on the Amazon Web Services 
(AWS)  server  and  REDCap  platform.  The  study  team 
will upload outcome data by the participants at the AWS 
server monthly.

Plans for communicating necessary protocol amendments 
to relevant parties (e.g. trial participants, ethical 
committees) {25}

Changes  to  the  study  protocol  will  be  communicated  to 
the  DSRB  when  required.  Deviations  from  the  proto-
col will be fully documented using a breach report form 
and it will be updated to the protocol in the clinical trial 
registry.

Dissemination plans {31a}

Study  results  will  be  disseminated  through  webinars, 
written  documents,  conferences,  and  research  meetings 
at  SICS.  We  will  also  prepare  scientific  reports  of  the 
study results for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

Discussion
This study aims to identify post-GDM women from com-
munity settings in Singapore and assess the effectiveness 
of a holistic lifestyle mHealth intervention for the preven-
tion of T2D and CMDs. It is essential to develop preven-
tative interventions to encourage healthy lifestyle habits, 
given the high incidence rates of T2D and CMD among 
women  following  GDM.  This  study  may  provide  fur-
ther  support  for  the  effectiveness  of  preventative  inter-
ventions  that  consider  the  close  relationship  between 
physical and psychological health. Holistic lifestyle inter-
ventions  that  promote  healthy  habits  such  as  maintain-
ing a balanced healthier diet, engaging in regular physical 
activity,  getting  adequate  sleep,  and  prioritising  mental 
well-being  can  work  together  to  produce  more  effective 
results [34, 66, 67]. mHealth also offers practical, afford-
able,  and  scalable  intervention  support  for  individuals 
adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyles. The evidence 
has shown that holistic mHealth targeting lifestyle behav-
iours are available and have shown to be effective [31, 34, 
37].  However,  few  studies  have  been  tested  using  multi-
competent  lifestyle  using  mHealth  [34]. This  RCT  study 
represents a pioneer attempt to investigate the effective-
ness  of  a  holistic  lifestyle  mHealth  intervention  focused 
on  the  prevention  of  T2D  and  CMDs  in  women  with  a 
history of GDM.

mHealth  has  the  potential  to  transform  preventive 
healthcare,  and  particularly  support  post-GDM  women 
who  encounter  challenges  due  to  fatigue,  child-caring 
responsibilities,  and  motivation  to  change  their  life-
styles.  Additionally,  we  expect  that  the  holistic  mHealth 
proposed  will  permit  to  build  capacities  to  disseminate 
interventions  and  could  have  enormous  public  health 
implications  for  the  region  and  serve  as  a  model  for 
implementing  preventative  interventions  in  Asia  and 
globally.
