Abstract

Background and aims—Resilience and recovery are of increasing importance in the field of 
alcohol dependence (AD). This paper describes how imaging studies in man can be used to assess 
the neurobiological correlates of resilience and, if longitudinal, of disease trajectories, progression 
rates and markers for recovery to inform treatment and prevention options.

Methods—Original articles on recovery and resilience in alcohol addiction and its 
neurobiological correlates were identified from ‘PubMed’ and have been analyzed and condensed 
within a systematic literature review.

Results—Findings deriving from (f)MRI and PET studies have identified links between 
increased resilience and less task-elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia, and benefits of 
heightened neural prefrontal cortex (PFC) engagement regarding resilience in a broader sense, 
namely resilience against relapse in early abstinence of AD. Furthermore, findings consistently 
propose at least partial recovery of brain glucose metabolism and executive and general cognitive 
functioning, as well as structural plasticity effects throughout the brain of alcohol-dependent 
patients during the course of short, medium and long-term abstinence, even when patients only 
lowered their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. Additionally, specific factors were found 
that appear to influence these observed brain recovery processes in AD, e.g. genotype-dependent 
neuronal (re)growth, gender-specific neural recovery effects, critical interfering effects of 
psychiatric comorbidities, additional smoking or marijuana influences, or adolescent alcohol 
abuse.

Conclusions—Neuroimaging research has uncovered neurobiological markers that appear to be 
linked to resilience and improved recovery capacities that are furthermore influenced by various 
factors such as gender or genetics. Consequently, future system-oriented approaches may help to 
establish a broad neuroscience-based research framework for alcohol dependence.

Introduction

Imaging recovery and resilience

The toxic effects of alcohol are particularly seen in the brain as demonstrated by several 
post-mortem and in vivo neuroimaging studies in individuals with alcohol dependence (AD; 
e.g. (1–3)). Structural changes are clearly observed in the brain, including atrophy of gray 
and white matter with sulcal widening and ventricular enlargement. In addition, chronic 
alcohol consumption is accompanied by neural adaptations within different neurotransmitter 
systems, such as the dopamine system (cf. reviews (4–9)). These neural and molecular 
changes have been further shown to be associated with dysfunctional brain functions 
underlying psychological and behavioral processes in AD (10–19).

Once harmful alcohol use stops or is reduced, beneficial recovery processes can be observed 
regarding physical and mental health (see (20)), and in the brain using various neuroimaging 
techniques (21–24). One of the main questions for neuroimaging research in the field of 
addictive disorders is to characterize predictors of recovery and treatment outcome (25). It is 
notable however that a clear standard definition of the term “recovery” is not generally 
established yet. In this review, we will focus on structural and functional changes within the 
brain associated with reduction of alcohol intake or abstinence in AD investigated by studies 
using neuroimaging techniques as identified by our literature search.

Another consideration is to what extent abnormalities in brain structure and function are 
caused by the toxic effects of alcohol, or whether some of these differences might have been 
pre-existing and putatively predispose some individuals to develop alcohol dependence 
while others seem to have a protective effect i.e. confer resilience (26). Resilience is 
traditionally defined as the ability to adapt to adverse/ traumatic environments thus resulting 
in healthy long-term psychological functioning and better developmental outcomes (27–29). 
Resilience research also concentrates on high-risk groups, which do not develop the disorder 
of interest despite carrying risk genes and/or experiencing adverse environmental conditions. 
Studying those individuals already affected, however, adds a new perspective to the 
understanding of disease development, disease progression, and future potential treatment 
strategies by focusing on neurobiological factors that promote a good treatment outcome 
despite adversities. Thus, studies using neuroimaging techniques may help to identify such 
resilience mechanisms regarding the structural and functional markers of neural patterns 
associated with attenuating further disease progression and/or relapse in AD (10, 11, 30, 31). 
Such factors are not defined by the absence of vulnerability markers but rather by 
compensatory changes in biological markers that distinguish individuals with good treatment 
outcome from those who relapse and healthy controls.

We therefore reviewed the available literature to answer the following questions 1) why are 
some people less vulnerable in developing addictive disorders in comparison with others? 2) 
to what extent can recovery processes be observed? 3) why some individuals with alcohol 
dependence achieve and maintain abstinence better i.e. are more resilient than those who 
relapse?

Methods

Search strategy

Page 3

We systematically reviewed the existing literature up to November 2017 using PUBMED 
electronic database for the identification of neuroimaging studies investigating recovery 
and/or resilience in alcohol dependence or alcohol dependence in humans, respectively. We 
therefore used the following search terms: imaging, neuroimaging, addiction, dependence, 
alcohol*, substance use*, substance use disorder, recovery, resilience. Bibliographies of 
relevant articles were additionally screened for further relevant information.

Study selection

We included peer-reviewed original studies irrespective of when the study was conducted 
and excluded single case studies, reviews and meta-analyses. For the sake of parsimony, we 
further excluded neuroimaging studies using imaging techniques other than functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), or 
positron emission tomography (PET). Additional exclusion criteria were: not in English, 
substances other than alcohol, neuropsychological studies without neuroimaging.

Extraction and quality assessment

One reviewer (KC) screened abstracts of articles identified for potential relevance. Then, two 
reviewers (AB and KC) independently extracted study data and further screened 
bibliographies of relevant articles. In the event of uncertainty or disagreement regarding 
criteria for eligibility between AB and KC, selected articles and manuscript draft were 
further discussed with the third and fourth reviewer (FWL and AH). Decisions on study 
selection were documented by AR.

Results

Search results

The initial term search identified a total of 1066 articles, of which 175 were considered 
potentially relevant. Additionally, 7 were identified through screening the reference lists of 
selected articles. Of those, 145 articles were further excluded as described in Figure 1 
according to the PRISMA group (32). Finally, 35 studies were included in our review (in 
detail please see Table 1, Appendix).

Resilience and Recovery Markers detected by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(fMRI)

We found 9 relevant fMRI studies (10–12, 33–38) investigating the role of cognitive 
functions commonly seen in AD such as executive, motivational aspects of behavior and 
emotion processing (for review see (4, 7, 39)).

Weiland et al. characterized resiliency as the ability for flexible adaptation of psychological 
control functions appropriate to the respective environmental context (36). Since low 
resiliency is known to be associated with later alcohol/drug problems and poor working 
memory performance (36), they investigated young healthy adolescents with and without a

positive family history for alcohol dependence using a 2-Back working memory task and 
observers’ ratings based on the California Child Q-Sort as a measurement for resiliency. 
Resiliency negatively correlated with number of alcohol problems and illicit drugs used but 
did not differ regarding family history. This might point to the importance of environmental 
factors apart from genetic influences.

Another study reported that: in those with AD who became abstinent, higher functional 
engagement of brain areas within and outside of the “classical” working memory network 
(e.g. rostral/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) was associated with executive behavioral control 
(11). This may constitute a resilience factor in terms of flexible recruitment of neural 
resources inside the classical working memory network and further compensatory processes 
associated with longer duration of abstinence. This is consistent with another fMRI study 
that also showed functional recruitment of neural working memory network in alcohol 
dependence (33) and suggests that such higher activity is productive rather than an 
impairment.

Drug-associated cue-reactivity has been associated with drug craving (e.g. (16, 40)) and risk 
of relapse after detoxification (e.g. (10, 14)). Two recent prospective studies reported altered 
cingulate cortex connectivity during individualized imaginary scripts provoking either 
alcohol-, stress-associated, or neutral states in AD (38). Those patients who showed greater 
posterior cingulate connectivity during alcohol imagery, or less anterior, mid-cingulate 
connectivity during neutral trials showed longer abstinence in the following 90-days and 
resembled healthy controls. These results emphasize the benefit of functional connectivity 
analyses in the investigation of neurobiological substrates and relapse risk in AD (38).

In their prospective study, Beck et al. (10) observed increased neural reactivity during 
presentation of alcohol-associated cues within midbrain/subthalamic nucleus as well as 
ventral striatum in those AD who achieved abstinence compared to relapsers (<3 months 
follow-up) (10). Further, patients who remained abstinent demonstrated increased functional 
connectivity between midbrain and amygdala as well as orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during 
this alcohol-associated “cue reactivity” task compared to those patients who relapsed within 
3 months. The authors argued that the increased connectivity between dopaminergic brain 
areas such as the midbrain and the amygdala/OFC might help to discriminate and signal 
aversive aspects of drinking alcohol and thus may support abstinence.

In the context of reward deficiency, Yau et al. observed reduced ventral striatal response 
during the anticipation of monetary reward and loss using a monetary incentive delay task 
(MID) in a group of healthy children of alcohol-dependent (COA) individuals (aged 18 to 22 
years) compared with controls (37). In addition, in COAs only, activation of ventral striatum 
was positively correlated with externalizing behavior as well as current and lifetime alcohol 
consumption.

Another important, but rarely studied domain in addiction research regarding recovery or 
resilience is the neural basis of emotion processing. Heitzeg et al. (35) conducted a 
longitudinal cohort study to investigate externalizing behavioral problems and neural 
activation patterns during an fMRI task presenting emotional words in adolescents (16 to 20

years) with a family history of AD, who were considered vulnerable (risky drinking 
behavior) or resilient (no risky drinking behavior). These groups were compared to 
adolescents without any parental history of AD or risky drinking behavior (35). In response 
to emotional stimuli, increased activation in OFC, insula and putamen was observed in the 
resilient group. The vulnerable group showed more activation of dorsomedial prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) and less activation of ventral striatum and extended amygdala. Increased 
dorsomedial PFC activation and decreased subcortical activation were linked to greater 
externalizing behavior (35).

Another study by Charlet et al. (11) assessed brain responses during a face-matching task to 
investigate implicit emotion processing among detoxified AD and healthy controls. Greater 
activation of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the processing of aversive faces 
correlated with longer subsequent abstinence and less subsequent binge drinking during the 
subsequent 6 months. This ACC response may indicate a possible resilience/recovery factor, 
presumably reflecting successful emotion regulation and error monitoring (12).

Taken together, findings derived from the fMRI studies indicate potentially important roles 
of basal ganglia and prefrontal brain. While 2 of 3 studies in COAs point to an increased 
resilience associated with less task-elicited neural activation within the basal ganglia (36, 
37), those in AD patients showed that greater PFC engagement may underpin resilience 
against relapse in patients during early abstinence (cf. (41); (10–12, 33, 38)).

Resilience and Recovery Markers detected by Studies using Positron Emission 
Tomography

Despite the wealth of preclinical and clinical evidence about dopaminergic function in 
addiction (41, 43, 48), studies focusing on resilience and recovery in alcohol dependence are 
sparse (16, 44–47).

Two 11C-raclopride PET studies measured D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability in healthy 
young adults with either a positive (FHP) or a negative (FHN) family history of AD pre and 
post an amphetamine challenge. In both, unaffected FHP displayed higher level of striatal 
D2 (46) and D2/D3 (44) dopamine receptor availability in striatal regions compared with 
FHN. Interestingly, while amphetamine resulted in the expected increase in dopamine and 
positive subjective effects in FHN individuals, this was not found in FHP individuals (44). 
Such results support the hypothesis that high D2 receptor availability may serve as a 
protective biomarker compensating for the higher inherited vulnerability (p.1004; (46)). 
Further, striatal D2 receptor availability in FHP was also significantly linked to prefrontal 
glucose metabolism, which in turn was positively associated with emotional positivity (46). 
This suggests dopaminergic modulation of cognitive control over emotional responses 
protects against developing alcohol addiction.

In AD, PET studies have demonstrated lower levels of DA receptor availability and DA 
release compared with healthy controls (e.g. 16, 48).

Two early studies used PET to assess recovery of brain glucose metabolism during 
abstinence in AD. One reported a significant increase in brain glucose metabolism

predominantly within 16–30 days, especially in frontal brain regions, whereas low 
metabolism persisted in the basal ganglia (47). Another study showed that the four patients 
who remained abstinent compared with two who relapsed showed partial recovery in brain 
metabolism within frontal cortex areas as well as significant improvement in general 
cognitive and executive functioning (45).

In sum, PET studies concentrating on recovery and resilience in alcohol dependence are 
sparse but do suggest that differences in dopaminergic function may result in vulnerability or 
resilience depending on the genetic background of an individual. Whilst high D2/D3 
receptor availability may serve as protective non-alcoholic FHP, low D2 receptor availability 
may render individuals more vulnerable to alcohol abuse. Further, similarly to fMRI studies, 
normalization in metabolism is associated with abstinence.

Resilience and Recovery Markers detected by Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging

We found 21 relevant studies investigating changes in brain structure during abstinence (21, 
50–69) cf. Table 1)).

Smaller gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes have been found throughout the 
brain and were associated with relapse within 6 months after detoxification (67). 
Interestingly, increases in brain volumes were seen even in those patients with moderate 
alcohol consumption (<10g of pure alcohol per day) after detoxification. This indicates 
beneficial effects of reduced alcohol consumption in AD who are not ready or able to 
become abstinent (67). Some brain areas appeared to recover faster, such as the cingulate 
gyrus in comparison to the fusiform gyrus, which led the authors to propose that recovery in 
one area triggers recovery in other connected areas.

Along with ventricular volume recovery, significant volume increases in subcortical GM 
weremainly observed within the first month of abstinence in AD compared with the 
following 7.5 months of abstinence (55, 64). Indeed, frontal GM normalized to control level, 
though total cortical and regional GM volumes (e.g. parietal, temporal, thalamic) remained 
lower after 7.5 months of abstinence (55). Likewise, Gazdzinski, et al. (56) showed that 
recovery of brain tissue was six times faster in the first three weeks of abstinence than during 
the subsequent twelve months of abstinence (56). Brain volume gain was more prominent in 
heavier drinkers with less tissue at baseline (56). Partial recovery of cortical thickness was 
also found after only 2 weeks of sobriety with full normalization seen in medial OFC and 
rostral ACC. Regeneration of sulci was here more pronounced in all affected brain areas 
than in gyri (69). Another study showed significant normalization of hippocampal GM 
volume within the first two weeks of abstinence in AD, especially in those with greater 
withdrawal severity at baseline (21).

Other studies have also found smaller tissue volumes associated with greater previous 
alcohol intake (21, 53), e.g. in frontal and temporal cortices (53).

Mon et al. (60) mathematically modelled longitudinal brain structure changes in AD patients 
and found that in those with greater GM/WM atrophy at baseline (usually directly after 
detoxification), greater dynamic neuroplastic changes occurred within the first month of

cessation of alcohol intake (60). Two studies by Cardenas et al., using deformation-based 
morphometry, reported that, one week after detoxification, patients had smaller frontal and 
temporal GM and WM volume but those that stayed abstinent regained WM and GM tissue 
in cortical and subcortical regions after 6–9 months (53). Apart from structural GM 
reductions in AD patients relative to controls, subsequent abstainers and relapsers showed 
different patterns of GM volume loss (52). In particular, future relapsers showed reduced 
GM in bilateral OFC in relation to abstainers, which might indicate conservation of GM in 
this region to benefit recovery in AD patients (52). In terms of subcortical regions, 
Deshmukh et al. (54) also discovered regional volume atrophy in caudate, putamen and 
nucleus accumbens in AD men abstinent for approximately 204 days compared to healthy 
controls, with greater volume deficits in the nucleus accumbens seen in the more recently 
abstinent patients (54).

Interestingly, some studies did not find significant WM differences between AD and controls 
(55, 69), although WM volume gain has been detected with abstinence. DTI is probably 
more sensitive to WM change than structural MRI as detailed architecture of white matter 
tissue can be analyzed by visualizing molecule diffusion patterns (50, 57). For example, a 
longitudinal study utilizing DTI reported improvement of white matter fibre tract coherence 
and myelin integrity in the corpus callosum of recently detoxified AD during one year of 
abstinence (50). Notably these WM indices in AD no longer differed from controls (50). 
However, there was no relationship between these WM changes with normalization of 
working memory function in the AD (50). Similarly, normalization of whole brain fibre tract 
integrity was observed in abstainers with multiple scans over the course of 8 years, while 
relapsers showed accelerated microstructural damage of the white matter, i.e. faster ageing 
(63).

Potential modulators—One potential mechanism underlying recovery could be related to 
genotype, such as has been shown for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF Val66Met 
(rs6265) polymorphism), a promyelination neurotrophin which serves as a neurobiological 
marker of neuronal growth and maintenance (61, 70). AD who are homozygous for Val 
demonstrated frontal, parietal and thalamic GM increase during the first 5 weeks of 
abstinence and greater hippocampal volume recovery over 7 months of sobriety (59). This 
was not seen in Val/Met heterozygotes though both, Val/Val and Val/Met carriers showed 
tissue gains in temporal GM (61). Interestingly, Mon et al. (61) observed significant 
increases in frontal WM volumes only in Val/Met heterozygotes but not in Val homozygotes, 
as well as subcortical volume decreases in caudate GM in Val but not Met carriers. 
Furthermore, Hoefer et al. found hippocampal volume changes to be associated with 
improvements in visuospatial memory performance only in BDNF Val homozygotes (but not 
in Met carriers) (59).

Structural atrophy and recovery may also vary between gender. Here, a recent study 
observed that the duration and quantity of heavy drinking was significantly related to WM 
reductions that regionally differed between male and female AD (65). Furthermore, stronger 
positive associations between duration of abstinence and WM volume were seen in women 
while men showed this association more so than women after 1 year of sobriety (65), 
confirming gender specific recovery processes (62, 71). Another gender-driven GM

difference indicating heightened vulnerability to brain atrophy in women was observed by 
Sameti and coworkers (66): long-term abstinent alcohol-dependent women (mean 6.3 years) 
displayed smaller nucleus accumbens volumes compared to healthy women and male 
controls. However, no significant gender effects have also be detected such as in GM 
increases and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) decreases in some brain areas observed within the 
first two weeks of alcohol abstinence (68).

Comorbid nicotine dependence is also important to consider because up to 80% of AD 
smoke (72, 73) and is itself neurotoxic (57, 58). Evidence is however inconsistent. Whilst 
non-smoking AD revealed faster microstructural recovery (i.e. in frontal, temporal, parietal 
and occipital lobes) compared with smoking alcohol dependent patients, faster 
macrostructural increases in frontal and temporal WM volume were seen in smokers only, 
with no changes of metabolic concentrations in both groups (57). Contrary to those WM 
volume findings, smoking AD were found to show less recovery with increasing age 
especially in frontal (and total cortical) GM volume. Moreover, beneficial effects regarding 
processing speed were associated with the found morphological GM increases, but again in 
non-smoking AD only (55). Another study could not support any of these smoking-
dependent recovery findings (59).

Studying neurobiological underpinning of resilience and its predication of problematic 
alcohol use, a recent European adolescent study by Burt et al. including 1870 teens (average 
age 14.56 years), identified elevated GM volumes in prefrontal areas (BA 11, 10, 6) in 
resilient adolescents (high competence in academic, social and emotional domains despite 
experiencing adverse lifetime events in the past) compared with other peers, which also 
correlated negatively with problematic drinking. Thus, potentially preventing those teens 
from future AD development by the PFC regulating behavior with protective executive 
control (51).

In summary, structural neuroimaging studies demonstrate beneficial plasticity effects 
throughout the brain of AD during short-, medium- and long-term abstinence, even when 
patients only lower their alcohol consumption to a moderate level. However, recovery of 
neuronal tissue (GM vs. WM, or sulci vs. gyri) appears to recover variably across regions 
(frontal areas first in early abstinence) and at different time rates.

Discussion and Future Avenues for Research

Neuroimaging research has been key in shedding light on possible dysfunctional domains 
and affected brain regions in AD and their potential of recovery after alcohol cessation (or 
reduction). In summary, lower dopamine receptor availability as shown in PET studies, 
related to craving in AD patients (16) which in turn has been associated with relapse (10, 
15). Moreover, functional MRI studies have linked deficient reward and emotion processing 
to negative treatment outcomes while structural MRI studies have shown that conserved PFC 
morphology in particular is linked to resilience and abstinence in AD patients. Altogether, 
investigations of morphology identified specific factors that influenced these observed brain 
recovery processes and should be considered in future studies on brain recovery in AD, e.g. 
genotype-dependent neuronal (re)growth (59, 61), gender-specific neural recovery effects

(54, 62, 65, 66, 68, 71), additional smoking influences (58, 59, 74) or adolescent alcohol 
abuse (51).

Overall, the reviewed research suggests that volumetric brain tissue recovery processes 
follow non-linear trajectories, suggesting that faster reconstitution of regionally specific 
brain areas during early abstinence might trigger consecutively recovery of associated 
regions. Consistent with these results, additional lifetime and current psychiatric diagnoses 
(such as anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder or externalizing disorder) 
have been identified as a critical factor that interfere with morphometric brain recovery in 
alcohol dependence (66).

However, in reviewing these studies, one must be aware of some methodological diversity 
when trying to compare or summarize the existing study findings. Here, in addition to 
replication studies, meta-analyses that weigh findings by their effects sizes could be 
employed to preserve false positive findings or small effect sized results from 
overestimation. Also, usage of different self-report instruments (without verification by 
collateral information) to assess measures of alcohol consumption (e.g. lifetime drinking 
amount, onset and pattern of drinking) has to be regarded in light of potential bias toward 
socially desirable answers, which might cause underestimation of reported drinking due to 
embarrassment (e.g. (10–12)).

Future studies that aim at systematic investigation of factors that mediate recovery and 
resilience are at the focus of some system-oriented approaches (cf. (75)). On a functional 
level, different domains play a crucial role for the development and maintenance of addictive 
disorders and thus are important factors for recovery on one hand and resilience on the 
other: Executive functions including inhibitory control and working memory, reward 
processing as well as processing of emotional stimuli are potential targets for diagnosis, 
prognosis and therapy (10–12).

However, up to now most of imaging studies in this field of research are cross- sectional, and 
there is clear necessity of longitudinal studies for the characterization of disease trajectories, 
progression rates and markers for recovery and resilience to inform treatment options. 
Indeed, cohort studies as carried out by the IMAGEN consortium (e.g. (76)) can shed light 
on potential future research directions; here researchers from multiple European countries 
aim to identify neuronal predictors for developing addictive disorders as well as potential 
targets for AD prevention approaches. Additional application of machine learning 
algorithms may further help to generate models of current and future alcohol misuse by 
incorporating the assessed brain processes and structures, personality as well as cognitive 
factors, environmental conditions and finally genetic markers (76). Regarding the 
identification of intermediate phenotypes of resilience, clearly more studies are needed since 
this field of neurobiological research is rather unexplored. Here, investigations of individuals 
with and without heightened genetic or environmental risk for AD are needed to help 
disentangling resilience markers from vulnerability risk factors. Recent studies also 
introduced epigenetic mechanisms in AD, adding valuable information about modulating 
processes to the genotype-phenotype interaction (77). Those investigations should use 
appropriate study designs, such as comparisons of i) adolescent/young adult COAs with vs.

without AD on their own or ii) adult AD patients vs. adult individuals without AD but with a 
positive family history of AD (e.g. first degree relatives of AD patients) vs. healthy 
individuals without familiar or own AD (as in the recent ongoing prospective cohort study 
“e:Med SysMed Alcoholism”; (75)), respectively. Clearly, findings testing neurobiological 
traits of vulnerability to AD (cf. (78–80)) may give rise to new hypotheses and research 
questions, but caution is warranted that vulnerability markers are not simply the opposite of 
resilience. Rather, vulnerability demonstrates conditions and aberrations which exist before 
AD and may facilitate developing AD but are not only caused by e.g. neurotoxic alcohol 
effects. Resilience, on the other hand, refers to factors that promote good treatment outcome 
despite negative effects of long-term alcohol intake on neural structure and function.

Further, future research should not only continue to strengthen knowledge about recovery 
processes and resilience markers (in high-risk groups without alcohol dependence as well as 
in already affected AD) but should also address whether they can be translated to various 
drugs of abuse in terms of general markers or can be characterized specifically for different 
substance classes.
