AbsTrACT
Obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric 
disorder that is characterised by obsessions and 
compulsions. The recommended treatments for OCD 
are cognitive– behavioural therapy using exposure and 
response prevention and/or pharmacotherapy. On the other 
hand, some nutritional and herbal supplements may be 
effective in the treatment of OCD. Nutritional and herbal 
supplements in OCD treatment will be reviewed in this 
paper. PubMed (Medline), Cochrane Library and Google 
Scholar databases were reviewed for the topic. There are 
some supplements that have been researched in OCD 
treatment studies such as vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic 
acid, homocysteine, trace elements, N- acetyl cysteine, 
glycine, myoinositol, St John’s wort, milk thistle, valerian 
root, curcumin and borage. The effectiveness of herbal and 
nutritional supplements in the treatment of OCD should be 
supported with more conclusive evidence.

InTroduCTIon
Obsessive- compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  a 
neuropsychiatric  disorder  that  is  character-
ised  by  obsessions  and  compulsions.  OCD 
usually  begins  in  childhood  or  adolescence 
and  comorbid  disorders  such  as  mood, 
anxiety, psychotic and somatoform disorders 
are common in patients with OCD.1

Structural,  neurochemical,  genetic  and 
immunological  factors  play  a  role  in  the 
aetiology  and  pathophysiology  of  OCD.2 
Alterations  in  certain  neurotransmitters  are 
involved  in  OCD  symptoms.  Serotonin  defi-
ciency and the dysfunction in the availability 
of serotonin transporter (5- HTT) have been 
in  OCD  symptomatology.3  In 
implicated 
addition,  elevated  glutamate,  glutamine  and 
gamma  aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  levels  in 
the  caudate  nucleus4  and  increased  gluta-
mate  levels  in  the  cerebrospinal  fluid  have 
been found in patients with OCD.5 Also, the 
glutamatergic  ionotropic  N- methyl  D- aspar-
tate  (NMDA)  receptor  has  been  associated 
with OCD.6

The  recommended  treatments  for  OCD 
are  cognitive–behavioural 
therapy  using 
exposure  and  response  prevention7  and/or 

pharmacotherapy  with  selective  serotonin 
reuptake 
inhibitors  (SSRI),  the  tricyclic 
antidepressant  clomipramine,  or  serotonin 
noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitors  such  as 
venlafaxine or duloxetine.8 9

Limited  effectiveness  and  possible  side 
effects of present treatments have lead to the 
search  for  alternative  strategies.  It  is  known 
that  various  nutritional  deficiencies  can 
be  detected  in  patients  with  mental  disor-
ders.  Therefore,  nutritional  supplements 
are  thought  to  be  effective  in  treatment. 
In  this  paper,  use  of  nutritional  and  herbal 
supplements in the treatment of OCD will be 
reviewed.

Vitamin d
Vitamin D has important functions in immu-
nity modulation, inflammatory response and 
antioxidant processes.10 It is also essential for 
normal brain development and functioning, 
and plays key roles nervous system processes 
such as neurotransmission, neuroprotection, 
proliferation and differentiation.11 12

Vitamin  D  is  synthesised  in  the  epidermis 
as vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and then it is 
converted to 25- OH D3 in the liver by hydrox-
ylation.  After  rehydroxylation  in  the  kidney, 
25- OH  D3  becomes  1,25- dihydroxy- vitamin 
D3, the active form of vitamin D.11

deficiency  is  associated  with  numerous  neuropsychiatric 
diseases  that  include  autism,  major  depressive  disorder, 
schizophrenia  and  OCD.13–15  There  are  several  possible 
relationships  between  vitamin  D  and  OCD  pathophysi-
ology. One of these is the association between the active 
form of vitamin D3 (1,25- dihydroxy- vitamin D3) and tyro-
sine/tryptophan hydroxylase. While tyrosine hydroxylase 
is  the  rate- limiting  enzyme  in  dopamine,  epinephrine 
and norepinephrine synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase is 
the rate- limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis. Levels of 
these two enzymes are regulated by 1,25- dihydroxy- vitamin 
D3.16 17 Therefore, vitamin D deficiency may contribute to 
OCD aetiology by affecting the pathway of serotonin and 
catecholamines synthesis.

The other relationship between vitamin D and OCD has 
to do with the neuroprotective effect of vitamin D. In some 
studies, the role of free radicals, especially increased levels 
of nitric oxide, is shown in OCD.18 Vitamin D has antiox-
idant effects and inhibits an essential enzyme (inducible 
nitric  oxide  synthase)  for  nitric  oxide  synthesis.19  Thus, 
vitamin D deficiency may play a role in OCD by causing 
the deterioration of neuroprotection.

In the literature, all available papers on OCD and vitamin 
D are studied with child and adolescent patients. There is 
no adult study on this topic. Esnafoğlu and Yaman have 
compared vitamin D, vitamin B12, homocysteine and folic 
acid levels between 52 patients with OCD and 30 healthy 
controls.  They  found  that  there  was  a  negative  correla-
tion  between  severity  of  OCD  and  the  level  of  vitamin 
D  and  also  vitamin  D  levels  were  lower  in  patients  with 
OCD.20 On the other hand, Yazici et al showed no signif-
icant  difference  in  vitamin  D,  calcium,  phosphate  and 
alkaline  phosphatase  levels  between  patients  with  OCD 
and healthy controls. But the level of vitamin D was nega-
tively  correlated  with  symptom  severity  in  patients  with 
OCD.21  This  study  has  compared  60  patients  with  OCD 
and 60 healthy controls. Similarly, Celik et al found lower 
vitamin D levels in paediatric autoimmune neuropsychi-
atric  disorders  were  associated  with  streptococcal  infec-
tion (PANDAS)- in patients with OCD (n=33) compared 
to  healthy  controls  (n=20),  but  the  difference  was  not 
statistically  significant.22  PANDAS  is  a  neuropsychiatric 
disorder that OCD symptoms manifest in following strep-
tococcal infections. There may be a relationship between 
vitamin  D  levels  and  increasing  oxidative  stress  due  to 
recurrent infections in patients with PANDAS.22

Vitamin  D  levels  can  be  influenced  by  latitude  and 
season,  due  to  sunlight.  Celik  et  al  and  Yazici  et  al  have 
stated the time interval of blood samples taken. But in the 
study of Esnafoğlu and Yaman, it is not clear.

Vitamin b12, folic acid and homocysteine
Vitamin  B12,  folic  acid  and  homocysteine  play  an 
important role in carbon transfer metabolism that main-
tains the methylation of proteins, neural membrane phos-
pholipids  and  neurotransmitters  such  as  serotonin  and 
other  monoamines.  Thus,  neurotransmitter  levels  may

decrease due to deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid.23 
Increased  plasma  homocysteine  levels  are  accepted  as  a 
sensitive marker of folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency.24 
Increased  homocysteine  levels  may  cause  DNA  damage, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of apoptotic signals 
and increased oxidative stress.25 All these findings suggest 
that  vitamin  B12,  folic  acid  and  homocysteine  may  be 
related with the aetiology of OCD.

In  the  literature,  there  are  case  reports  of  patients 
with  OCD  having  vitamin  B12  deficiency.26  27  Also,  some 
studies  have  investigated  the  association  between  OCD 
and vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine levels both 
in  adult  and  child- adolescent  patients.  Hermesh  et  al 
have  compared  30  patients  with  OCD,  30  patients  with 
chronic schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls. They have 
reported that vitamin B12 deficiency was more frequent in 
patients with OCD compared with controls, but there was 
no significant difference between vitamin B12 and folate 
levels among the three groups.28 Atmaca et al found lower 
folate  and  higher  homocysteine  levels  in  patients  with 
OCD  (n=23)  compared  with  controls  (n=23)  and  those 
levels  were  significantly  correlated  with  the  symptom 
severity  of  OCD.29  Türksoy  et  al  showed  that  vitamin 
B12  deficiency  was  significantly  higher  in  patients  with 
OCD (n=35) compared with control (n=22).30 But folate 
deficiency  was  not  found  in  either  group.  Additionally, 
homocysteine levels were significantly higher in the OCD 
group, and highest in the OCD group with major depres-
sive disorder. Similarly, Esnafoğlu and Yaman found lower 
vitamin B12 and higher homocysteine levels in the group 
of  children  and  adolescents  with  OCD  compared  with 
healthy controls. However there was no significant differ-
ence in the folic acid levels of both groups.20 A double- 
blind, 12- weeks study was conducted in 36 patients with 
OCD  who  were  randomly  assigned  to  folic  acid+fluoxe-
tine or placebo+fluoxetine group. They have reported no 
significant  difference  in  Yale- Brown  Obsessive  Compul-
sive Scale (Y- BOCS) scores between folic acid and placebo 
groups.  Also,  all  baseline  folate  levels  of  patients  with 
OCD were not lower than the normal range.31

Folate  and  vitamin  B12  levels  might  be  influenced  by 
dietary habits. So the results of studies can vary in samples 
from different societies.

Trace elements
Imbalances in trace elements may be associated with the 
pathophysiology  of  OCD.  Selenium  is  an  essential  trace 
element that plays a role in the antioxidant properties of 
glutathione peroxidase.32 Ozdemir et al found that serum 
selenium  level  was  lower  in  patients  with  OCD  (n=28). 
They reported a positive correlation between plasma gluta-
thione peroxidase activity and selenium concentration.33 
In  another  study,  48  patients  with  OCD  were  compared 
with 48 healthy controls and found that serum zinc, iron 
and  magnesium  levels  decreased  in  patients  with  OCD; 
however,  manganese  and  calcium  levels  were  increased. 
Also, they reported an imbalance in the trace elemental 
homeostasis  and  element- to- element  inter- relationship 

Kuygun Karcı C, Gül Celik G. General Psychiatry 2020;33:e100159. doi:10.1136/gpsych-2019-100159General Psychiatrypattern.34 In a pilot, randomised, double- blind, placebo- 
controlled  study,  patients  with  OCD  (n=30)  who  had 
taken an SSRI for at least 3 months were divided into two 
groups. While one group took 400 mg selenium capsules 
plus  SSRI,  the  other  group  took  placebo  plus  SSRI.  At 
the end of the 6 weeks, it was reported that there was a 
significant difference in Y- BOCS scores between the two 
groups.35 Selenium is a dietary element, so results of these 
studies could be affected by dietary habits.

Zinc  is  an  antioxidant  trace  element  that  is  required 
for  many  processes  such  as  gene  expression,  protein 
synthesis  and  enzymatic  catalysis.36  Zinc  presents  in  the 
central  nervous  system,  cerebral  cortex,  pineal  gland 
and  hippocampus,  and  modulates  inhibitory  and  excit-
atory  transmissions  such  as  GABA  and  NMDA.37  In  a 
randomised  placebo- controlled  clinical  trial,  one  group 
received fluoxetine plus zinc, other group received fluox-
etine plus placebo for 8 weeks. This study showed that the 
zinc  group  had  a  greater  improvement  compared  with 
the placebo group.38

Because of the possible role of oxidation mechanisms 
in  OCD  pathogenesis,  trace  elements  associated  with 
antioxidant  processes  are  thought  to  be  useful  in  OCD 
treatment.

n-acetyl cysteine
N- acetyl  cysteine  (NAC)  is  a  better  source  of  cysteine 
rather than parenteral cysteine due to being less reactive, 
less toxic, more resistant to oxidation and more soluble 
in water.39 Some high- protein foods may be the source of 
cysteine but NAC should be taken as a supplement. NAC 
is well tolerated thus an oral dose of it can be increased 
up to 8000 mg/d without significant adverse effect.40

NAC, which is orally taken, is converted to cysteine in 
the  liver  and  used  for  glutathione  synthesis.40  Cysteine 
may cross the blood–brain barrier. So, cysteine prodrugs 
such  as  NAC  inhibit  the  synaptic  glutamate  release  by 
cysteine- glutamate  exchange  and  may  contribute  to  the 
treatment  of  psychiatric  disorders.41  When  the  role  of 
oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of OCD is considered, 
NAC that reduces oxidative stress and inflammation may 
be beneficial for OCD.42

In a case study of a patient with SSRI- refractory OCD, 
Lafleur et al showed that there was a significant improve-
ment  in  OCD  symptoms  due  to  the  NAC  (3000  mg/d) 
augmentation  of  fluvoxamine.43  In  contrast,  a  series 
of  six  case  reports  of  patients  with  treatment- resistant 
severe OCD observed little efficacy of NAC (3000 mg/d) 
treatment.44  A  randomised  clinical  trial  assessing  NAC 
treatment  in  OCD  showed  a  significant  improvement 
of symptoms in the SSRI plus NAC group (2400 mg/d) 
compared  with  SSRI  plus  placebo  group.  But  patients’ 
comorbidities  have  not  been  included  in  evaluations.45 
Sarris et al46 have conducted a randomised, double- blind, 
placebo- controlled  clinical  trial  of  NAC  augmentation 
in  patients  with  OCD  who  have  been  taking  psycho-
tropic  drugs  or  adjunctive  therapies.  The  NAC- treated 
group  had  more  reduction  in  Y- BOCS  score  compared 

with  the  placebo  group.  The  same  authors  have  made 
a  further  analysis  and  reported  that  NAC  is  more  effec-
tive  in  younger  patients  with  a  shorter  diagnosis  period 
of OCD.47 The other randomised double- blind placebo- 
controlled trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit 
of  NAC  in  reducing  OCD  symptoms  in  patients  with 
treatment- resistant OCD but NAC might have effects on 
reducing  anxiety  symptoms  in  these  patients.48  In  this 
study,  patients  were  taking  at  least  an  SSRI.  Paydary  et 
al49 have compared NAC augmentation plus fluvoxamine 
treatment  with  placebo.  There  was  no  significant  differ-
ence in Y- BOCS scores between the two groups, however 
NAC- treated  patients  accomplished  remission  more 
than the control group. Ghanizadeh et al50 performed a 
randomised, double- blind, placebo- controlled study that 
searched  NAC  augmentation  of  citalopram  treatment 
in children and adolescents. Y- BOCS scores were signifi-
cantly decreased in the NAC group.

Glycine
Glycine  is  an  amino  acid  that  is  associated  with  cortical 
glutamatergic function. Glycine has potential to amelio-
rate  OCD  symptoms  due  to  its  agonist  effect  on  NMDA 
receptors.51 High- protein foods such as meat, fish, beans 
and dairy products include glycine. A case report showed 
benefit of glycine in patients with OCD and body dysmor-
phic disorder but large amounts of glycine (60 g/d) are 
required and unfortunately the large daily dose of glycine 
had  side  effects  such  as  significant  nausea.52  There  is 
only a placebo- controlled, double- blind study on glycine 
augmentation  in  patients  with  OCD  (n=24).  Dropout 
rates  in  this  study  were  high  due  to  adverse  effects  of 
glycine. Evaluable patients have showed near significant 
improvements in Y- BOCS scores.53

Myoinositol
Myoinositol (MI) is an endogenous isomer of glucose and 
has  been  used  in  the  treatment  of  psychiatric  disorders 
for a long time. High amounts of MI have been found in 
fruits, grains, nuts and beans. Also, MI is synthesised de 
novo from glucose-6- phosphate in the brain. A sustained 
supply  of  MI  is  essential  for  the  synthesis  of  membrane 
phospholipids and for intracellular secondary messenger 
cycle.54

It  is  suggested  that  MI  may  modulate  the  reuptake  of 
serotonin and increase 5- HT2 receptor density. Its thera-
peutic effects may be due to these mechanisms.55 There 
are few studies with small samples that investigate the effi-
cacy of high- dose MI (18 g/d) in OCD treatment. Fux et 
al and Carey et al reported positive data of MI supplemen-
tation  in  OCD  treatment.56  57  The  participants  of  these 
studies  were  not  receiving  concurrent  SSRI  treatment. 
In contrast, Fux et al and Seedat and Stein failed to find 
evidence for efficacy of MI in OCD treatment.58 59 In these 
studies, MI has been used as augmentation for concurrent 
SSRI  treatment.  The  existing  clinical  evidence  suggests 
that MI may potentially be effective as monotherapy for 
OCD.

St  John’s  wort  (SJW)  is  derived  from  a  plant  and  has 
been used for centuries as a traditional medicine to treat 
a  wide  range  of  disorders.  The  effectiveness  of  SJW  has 
been mostly studied in depression and found to be equiv-
alent to antidepressants.60 61 SJW contains flavonoid that 
has some anxiolytic effects. The neurobiological effects of 
SJW  include  monoamine  reuptake  inhibition,  neuroen-
docrine modulation, increased sensitisation and binding 
to receptors (eg, 5- HT).61 These monoaminergic effects 
may have potential benefits on OCD symptoms.

Evidence for efficacy of SJW in OCD is based on only 
two studies. A 12- week open- label trial showed significant 
improvements with the treatment of SJW (900 mg/d) in 
patients  with  OCD  (n=12).62  A  placebo- controlled  trial 
with  a  much  larger  sample  size  (n=60)  failed  to  show  a 
significant  difference  between  SJW  (600–1800  mg/d) 
treatment group and placebo group.63

Milk thistle (Silybum marianum)
Silybum  marianum  (milk  thistle)  is  a  medicinal  plant, 
which is grown in Mediterranean and Persian regions.64 
It contains flavonoid complex silymarin, which has anti- 
inflammatory,  antioxidant,  immune  modulator,  sedative 
and  antidepressant  effects.65  Also  silymarin  has  been 
found  to  increase  serotonin  in  the  cortex  and  acts  as  a 
monoamine oxidase inhibitor.66

Results of the only randomised controlled trial (n=35) 
of milk thistle for OCD treatment revealed no significant 
difference in treatment effects between milk thistle (600 
mg/d) and fluoxetine. It is indicated that milk thistle has 
similar effects with fluoxetine in OCD symptoms and its 
positive effect starts in the fifth week without severe side 
effects.64

Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis L)
Valerian is a perennial plant, which was used as a perfume 
in  the  16th  century.  Valerian  roots  have  aleuronic  acid 
that  is  associated  with  the  modulation  of  GABAA  recep-
tors.67  The  other  content  of  valerian  roots  is  valepotri-
ates, which is effective in treating the psychotic symptoms 
of  severe  anxiety.68  Valerian  is  most  commonly  used  in 
insomnia  and  migraine  treatment  due  to  its  sedative, 
pain  reliever  effects.  There  is  only  one  double- blind 
placebo- controlled trial of valerian extract in OCD treat-
ment (n=31). They found that valerian extract was more 
effective in OCD treatment compared with placebo. Also, 
they  observed  the  rapid  onset  of  the  effects  of  extract 
(28, 42, 56 days). Low incidence of impairment of libido 
with valerian extract was an important advantage of this 
treatment.69

Curcumin
Curcumin  is  an  active  constituent  of  turmeric.  Both 
turmeric  and  curcumin  are  thought  to  strengthen  the 
overall  energy  of  the  body,  relieving  gas,  dispelling 
worms,  improving  digestion,  regulating  menstruation, 
dissolving  gallstones  and  relieving  arthritis.  Curcumin 

4

is  most  commonly  used  to  ameliorate  pain  associated 
with  arthritis  and  other  musculoskeletal  disorders  due 
to  its  anti- inflammatory  effect.70  Potential  pharmacody-
namic  benefits  of  curcumin  in  neuropsychiatric  disor-
ders are associated with the monoaminergic imbalances, 
hypothalamus- pituitary- adrenal  axis  disturbances,  oxida-
tive stress, mitochondrial disturbances and dysregulated 
inflammation.71

Although  there  are  no  human  studies  that  examine 
benefits  of  curcumin  in  OCD  treatment,  in  an  OCD 
animal  model,  rats  were  injected  with  the  dopamine- 
agonist quinpirole and compulsive checking was induced. 
After  the  oral  curcumin  administration  for  35  days, 
compulsive  checking  and  ritualistic  behaviours  were 
significantly  reduced,  and  quinpirole- induced  deteri-
orations  were  reversed.  These  effects  of  curcumin  were 
comparable with paroxetine.72

borage (Echium amoenum)
Borage is a traditional Persian plant, which has anxiolytic 
and  sedative  effects  comparable  to  diazepam  and  also 
antidepressant effects. In only one study, borage extract 
(n=24) has been compared with placebo (n=20) in OCD 
treatment.  While  no  significant  difference  was  observed 
between the groups in the first week, a significant differ-
ence occurred at week 4 and week 6. In addition, anxiety 
symptoms  were  significantly  improved  with  the  borage 
treatment over placebo.73

ConClusIon
There  are  limited  studies  about  herbal  and  nutritional 
supplements  for  OCD  treatment  in  the  literature.  OCD 
and vitamin D association has been studied only in chil-
dren  and  adolescents.  Limited  data  show  a  negative 
correlation between OCD symptom severity and vitamin 
D. But these studies have been conducted in small samples 
and have some controversial points in methodology.

Vitamin  B12  and  folate  are  thought  to  be  effective  in 
OCD treatment due to their associations with neurotrans-
mitters. Depending on their antioxidant effect, zinc and 
selenium can be used in augmentation therapy for OCD. 
However, both trace elements and vitamin B12/folate can 
be  affected  by  diet.  Therefore,  dietary  habits  of  partici-
pants  have  to  be  considered  when  designing  studies  on 
OCD treatment.

There  are  some  studies  and  case  reports  that  have 
shown  improvement  with  NAC  in  OCD.  However,  these 
studies had small samples and participants who use SSRI 
or any psychotropic drug or psychotherapy. Data on the 
effect of glycine in OCD treatment are quietly restricted. 
On  the  other  hand,  maintaining  treatment  with  glycine 
is  very  difficult  due  to  its  adverse  effects.  The  existing 
limited  clinical  data  suggest  that  MI  may  potentially  be 
effective as monotherapy for OCD.

Some herbal medicines may provide a synergistic effect 
with  pharmaceuticals.  On  the  other  hand,  it  should 
be  noted  that  some  herbal  supplements  should  not 

Kuygun Karcı C, Gül Celik G. General Psychiatry 2020;33:e100159. doi:10.1136/gpsych-2019-100159General Psychiatrybe  used  with  some  drugs,  for  example,  SJW  with  SSRIs 
due  to  potential  serotonin  syndrome.  SJW,  milk  thistle, 
curcumin,  valerian  root  and  borage  are  herbal  supple-
ments  that  have  been  researched  in  OCD  treatment. 
Despite the few studies on herbal supplements for OCD 
treatment,  double- blind  randomised  controlled  studies 
with  standardised  preparations  of  these  herbals  are 
needed.  Although  previous  studies  showed  that  some 
herbal  and  nutritional  supplements  might  be  poten-
tially  effective  in  OCD  treatment,  further  double- blind 
randomised  controlled  longitudinal  studies  with  struc-
tured  measurement  procedures  in  larger  samples  are 
needed.
