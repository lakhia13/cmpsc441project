BACKGROUND Virtual reality and hypnosis are little studied
in complex contexts, such as intensive care, where patients
need signiﬁcant physical and psychological assistance.

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Anxiety, pain, fatigue, relax-
ation, physiological parameters, and opioid use were evalu-
ated before and after each session.

OBJECTIVES To compare and combine hypnosis and virtual
reality beneﬁts on anxiety and pain on patients before and
after cardiac surgery.

DESIGN Prospective randomised controlled clinical trial.

SETTING The study was conducted in the University Hospi-
tal of Liege (Belgium) from October 2018 to January 2020.

RESULTS The main results did not show any signiﬁcant
differences between the groups.
In all groups, anxiety
decreased and pain increased from baseline to the postop-
erative day. Relaxation increased in all groups in the pre-
operative (P < 0.0001) and postoperative period (P ¼ 0.03).
There were no signiﬁcant differences for fatigue, physiologi-
cal measures, or opioid use.

PATIENTS One hundred patients (66 (cid:2) 11.5 years; 24
women, 76 men) were included. Participants were adults
undergoing cardiac surgery. Exclusion criteria: psychiatric
diseases, claustrophobia, acrophobia, hearing loss, visual
impairment, extreme fatigue, confusion surgery cancelled.

CONCLUSION As there were no signiﬁcant differences
between groups for the measured variables, we cannot afﬁrm
that one technique is better than another. Additional studies
are required to compare and evaluate the cost-effectiveness
of these techniques for critical care patients and caregivers.

INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to four
arms (control; hypnosis; virtual reality; virtual reality hypnosis)
and had 20 min of one of the techniques the day before and
the day after surgery.

Introduction
Patients who are undergoing cardiac surgery are exposed to
psychological and physiological distress.1 Anxiety and
catastrophising are associated with impaired recovery after
surgery, for example, persistent pain.2–4 Moreover, the
stay in intensive care units (ICU) is accompanied by
additional stress, confusional states, cognitive dysfunction

(e.g. memory decline, delusion, postoperative delirium)
and depression.5

Today complementary techniques (e.g. music, relaxation,
hypnosis) are used together with pharmacological treat-
ment and have been shown to decrease peri-operative

anxiety, pain, nausea and the use of analgesic medica-
tion.1,6–9 Hypnosis and virtual reality have been investi-
gated in numerous studies in the medical ﬁeld (e.g.
algology, oncology, anaesthesia) to reduce pain and anxiety
and increase patient comfort.10–13 Hypnosis is deﬁned as a
‘state of modiﬁed consciousness involving focused atten-
tion and reduced peripheral awareness characterised by an
enhanced capacity for response to suggestions’.14 The
hypnotic state involves the capacities of absorption (ten-
dency to be fully involved in a mental experience), disso-
ciation (a mental separation from the environment) and
suggestibility (the responsiveness and ability to follow
hypnotic suggestions).15 Hypnosis can be used during
surgery in combination with local anaesthesia and con-
scious sedation. This technique is called ‘hypnosedation’
and is effective in decreasing anxiety and pain and anal-
gesic drug use, and it increases patient comfort, improves
surgical conditions and aids a faster recovery.16 Several
studies and a meta-analysis of 26 randomised clinical
trials showed a large effect size in favour of hypnosis for
the reduction of emotional distress among patients under-
going medical procedures, such as abdominal surgery.17–20
Despite the reduction in postoperative pain without
adverse effects risks,16 hypnosis can be difﬁcult to organise
routinely as it is time-consuming and requires a therapist.20
Distractive virtual reality (e.g. a game) or contemplative
virtual reality (e.g. relaxation) are techniques involving the
‘use of computer technology to create the effect of an
interactive three-dimensional world in which the objects
have a spatial presence’.21 Such virtual reality could reduce
distress related to a medical procedure, without side effects
and with no need for additional staff.22 Mosso-V(cid:2)azquez
et al. 23 in 2014 gave 30 min of virtual reality (contemplation
in a beautiful landscape) to 67 patients 24 h before cardiac
surgery: 88% of patients reported a decreased level of pain
post-virtual reality; 37% had a lower heart rate; 52% had
reduced mean arterial pressure. As both virtual reality and
hypnosis seem effective in the reduction of anxiety and
pain, a few studies have compared and combined these
techniques together. The combined technique is today
known as virtual reality hypnosis (VRH).24 VRH has shown
its success in the management of anxiety and pain in
different medical contexts, such as physical trauma,
chronic pain management or intensive care12,25–27 but
randomised studies are needed to investigate and compare
the effectiveness of these techniques in cardiac surgery
and ICU.
As VRH reduces both clinical and experimental pain,28,29
our hypothesis was that VRH could be beneﬁcial in the
reduction of pain and anxiety before and after cardiac
surgery.

Registration and ethical approval
This trial was registered retrospectively on clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT03820700). Registered on 29 January 2019, the
recruitment started in October 2018 and closed in January
2020. The complete protocol of the study has previously
been published.30 Ethical approval was provided by the
Ethical Committee of Liege University Hospitals,
Domaine Universitaire du Sart Tilman (B35) 4000 Liege,
Belgium on 22 June 2018 (Ethical Committee N8
B707201836498). Written informed consents were obtained
from all patients before inclusion.

Recruitment and patient involvement
Before any patient recruitment, a pilot study was under-
taken to reﬁne the choice of the questionnaires and evalu-
ate the virtual
reality setting. Randomisation was
undertaken in blocks of ﬁve patients. Inclusion criteria
were: age more than 18 years, cardiac surgery [coronary
artery bypass graft (CAB); mitral valve replacement
(MVR); aortic valve replacement (AVR); other] at the
University Hospital of Liege (Belgium), French speaking,
Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 14,31 Richmond
Agitation-Sedation Scale score constituted of (cid:3)1, 0 and
þ1,32 who have given their consent. Exclusion criteria
were: psychiatric diseases, claustrophobia, acrophobia,
hearing loss, visual impairment, extreme fatigue, confu-
sion, surgery cancelled or postponed.

Intervention components
This study is a prospective single-centre randomised
study with four arms: a control group and three experi-
mental groups.

(1) Control group: daily standard care.
(2) Hypnosis: in addition to the daily standard care, a
20 min prerecorded hypnosis session. The audio track
was created and recorded by M-EF and A-SN, both
experts in clinical and experimental hypnosis. The
recording included suggestions for positive body
sensations along with an invitation to observe a
sunrise and a beautiful landscape while relaxing in a
white cloud chair.

(3) Virtual reality: in addition to the daily standard care, a
20 min virtual
reality session wearing a head-
mounted display with goggles (Oncomfort). Partici-
pants watched a tridimensional graphical landscape,
consisting of a mountain cabin near a lake at sunrise,
followed by a relaxing moment in the clouds (Fig. 1).
The display was visual and audio, with sounds of
ambient nature but no voice.

bed monitor.

We also recorded whether patients received spinal mor-
phine (0.5 mg). To examine the confounding effects of
analgesic medication after surgery, the ‘on-demand’ opi-
oid intake was recorded 2 h before the session and until
6 h after. Nurses and doctors usually administered ‘on-
demand’ opioids during the day when pain intensity was
greater than 3 on the VAS 10-point scale. Whenever pain
was extreme, patient-controlled intravenous analgesia
(PCIA) was administred.

Statistical analyses
The sample size calculation was based on repeated
measures ANOVA test. Alpha was set at 0.05, power at
95% and the standardised effect size at 0.5. Studies which
aim to assess the effect of hypnosis on patients’ presur-
gery anxiety deﬁne an effect size of 0.2 as small, 0.5 as
moderate and 0.8 as large.1 With these parameters, 12
patients were required in each group, a total of 48
patients. We decided to enroll 100 patients (25 per group)
to allow for dropouts on the postoperative day. The
normality of data was assessed graphically with histo-
grams and quantile-quantile plots, and was tested with
the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables were
reported as mean (cid:2) SD, or median [IQR] for skewed
distributions whereas counts were used for qualitative
variables. Categorical variables were compared using the
x2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The homogeneity of the four
groups were assessed with the chi-squared test for quali-
tative and dichotomous variables and with a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA-1) or the nonparametric
Kruskal–Wallis test for the quantitative variables. A

repeated measures ANOVA test was used to compare
the evolution of the parameters between the pre-operative
day and the postoperative day according to the groups.
This analysis was adjusted by potential confounding
factors. Calculations were always carried out with the
maximum data available. Results were considered as
statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level (P < 0.05). Anal-
yses were performed using R 3.5.3 (R Core Team) and
the package Rcommander (Rcmdr) and using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Results
Study population
Between October 2018 and January 2020, 100 patients
were randomised to the four arms. Analyses included data
from 100 patients on the pre-operative day (T0, T1) and
from 70 patients postsurgery (T2, T3) (Fig. 3).

Dropouts
Data from 30 (30%) patients could not be collected after
surgery because of patient fatigue, sedation or confusion;
patients who were intubated and sedated or in the
recovery room; patients who did not like hypnosis, virtual
reality or VRH; or if patients were undergoing a medical
or nursing procedure. There were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the groups in the dropout rates (x2 ¼ 6.29,
P ¼ 0.09) (Fig. 3).

Patient characteristics
The patients initially recruited consisted of 24 women
and 76 men. The mean age was 66 (cid:2) 11.5 years. Forty
(40%) consumed more than three glasses of alcohol per
week and 33 (33%) smoked. The patient characteristics

were well balanced between the four arms and the
dissociation-trait scores of patients ranged from 0 to
48.6. Spinal morphine was given to 47% of the patients
and this was balanced across the groups. The type of
surgery was heterogeneous between groups (P ¼ 0.002)
(Table 1). This was corrected in the analysis.

Anxiety
Age was signiﬁcantly associated with anxiety (P ¼ 0.017):
older individuals were more anxious at baseline. Anxiety
evolved differently over time (P ¼ 0.023): patients in the
hypnosis group reported signiﬁcantly more anxiety than
those in VRH group at all times, even at baseline
(P ¼ 0.007). Anxiety was higher at baseline (T0) than
at T1 (P < 0.0001), T2 (P < 0.0001) and T3 (P < 0.0001)
in all groups. Apart from the baseline difference between

VRH and hypnosis and its durability over time, there
were no signiﬁcant differences between the groups
(Fig. 4).

Pain
Pain correlated with time (P < 0.0001) and was lower at
baseline (T0) and at T1 as compared with T2 and T3 in
all groups (P < 0.0001). No patient factors correlated with
pain. No signiﬁcant differences in the pain scores were
observed between the four groups (Fig. 5).

Fatigue
The patient’s sex was associated with fatigue: women felt
more fatigue than men irrespective of the time and group
(P ¼ 0.009). Fatigue correlated with time (P < 0.0001):
levels of fatigue were lower at T0 and T1 than at T2 and

T3 in all groups (P < 0.0001). No signiﬁcant differences
were found between T0 and T1. Levels of fatigue before
and after surgery were not signiﬁcantly different across
the groups (Fig. 6).

Relaxation
There were differences between times for patient relax-
ation (P ¼ 0.013): patients at T0 were less relaxed than at
T1 (P ¼ 0.008) and T3 (P ¼ 0.008) in all groups. After the
surgery, patients felt more relaxed at T3 than at T2 in all

groups (P ¼ 0.039). There were no signiﬁcant differences
between groups at any time (Fig. 7).

Physiological variables
Arterial pressure depended on the time of assessment.
Levels of arterial pressure were more elevated at T0 than
at T1 (P ¼ 0.030), T2 (P < 0.0001) and T3 (P < 0.0001) in
all groups. Heart rate was lower at baseline (T0) and at T1
(before surgery) than at T2 and T3 (after the surgery)
(P < 0.0001). There were no signiﬁcant differences across

the groups at any time. The techniques did not inﬂuence
pupil size, oxygen saturation or respiratory frequency at
any time.

Opioids
On the postoperative day in ICU, all patients received
paracetamol (4 (cid:4) 1 g per day). No patients received PCIA
and 48 patients out of the 70 (68.57%) received additional
opioids ‘on-demand’. There were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences across the groups in terms of on-demand opioids
(P ¼ 0.63) (Table 2).

Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the inﬂuence of recorded
hypnosis, virtual reality or VRH and compared these
against each other and with a control group, on anxiety,
pain, fatigue and relaxation, physiological parameters and
use of opioids. The main results were that there were no
signiﬁcant differences among the four groups for any
variable and none of the techniques was better than
another, nor better than the control group – no treatment.

Our results are in contrast to some studies evaluating the
effects of hypnosis in surgery or in the ICU (for a review,
see Rousseaux et al.34). Montgomery et al.35 showed that a

brief hypnosis session (15 min) performed within 1 h
before breast surgery reduced pain, nausea, emotional
upset and increased comfort. In a randomised trial of 50
patients, hypnosis was administered before and after coro-
nary artery bypass surgery. Patients in the hypnosis group
showed better coping strategies for emotional distress, and
anxiety and depression were reduced compared with a
control group.18 Another randomised trial of 60 patients in
ICU investigated the beneﬁts of therapy with positive
hypnotic suggestions and showed a signiﬁcant diminution
of the ventilation period and the length of stay in ICU in
the hypnosis group compared with the control group.36
Virtual reality was also documented as beneﬁcial for reduc-
ing anxiety before surgery. In a prospective study of 20
patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery, 5 min of a vir-
tual reality video signiﬁcantly reduced the patients’ stress
levels and salivary cortisol (a stress physiological indica-
tor).2 In a recent review of the literature on virtual reality
and hypnosis, authors reported pain and anxiety reduction
in different clinical settings (chronic pain, burns pain,
physical trauma)27, nevertheless a few studies investigated
VRH in randomised trials. Most of these were case studies,
and the results for VRH and pain did not show a consistent
effect over patients and days.22,24,25 Another example, in a
nonrandomised trial of 59 ICU patients showed signiﬁcant

reductions in anxiety and depression when virtual reality
was combined with guided meditation every day for a
week, but no effects were found for pain, sleep and
physiological parameters.26

Anxiety and pain levels were low to moderate, and the
variables evolved similarly in the four groups, suggesting
that perhaps the usual medical treatment was already
effective enough for these patients. In addition, the reduc-
tion of anxiety and increase in pain on the postoperative
day is normal in association with cardiac surgery. One
hypothesis regarding the reduction of anxiety in all groups
between T0 and T1 would be that the investigator’s input
may have an inﬂuence on the patients’ feelings. Thus, the
investigator visiting the patients before the surgery may
have reassured them and decreased their anxiety, inde-
pendently of the technique used.

These results did not show a higher beneﬁt of adding
virtual reality to hypnosis (or hypnosis to virtual reality),
nor indeed any difference from the control group with no
treatment. This question remains unsolved in the liter-
ature even for healthy participants. According to Enea et
al. (2014), highly hypnotisable individuals reported less
pain when using hypnosis and VRH, whereas low hyp-
notisable individuals reported less pain when using vir-
tual
reality and VRH than hypnosis alone or no
treatment.28 Researchers hypothesised that the cognitive
processes involved in distraction as well as the mecha-
nisms of how pain is reduced during virtual reality differ
from those involved in hypnosis.28,29 Nevertheless,
phenomenological and psychological mechanisms of
VRH have not yet been tested in randomised trials
implying further studies are required.

This study has some limitations. First, the patient-dropout
because of the inability to participate the day after surgery.
Some of the patients expressed the fact that extreme
fatigue as well as deep sedation because of surgery are a
barrier to following hypnotic suggestions and virtual reality
images. The second limitation is that given the nature of
the techniques, neither patients nor the investigators were
blinded to the treatment assignment. We can consider
randomisation as a methodological strength and also a
clinical limit. Standardisation of the techniques did not
allow an adaptation to the patient situation.37 In our study,
we used one design of ‘passive VR’ with no interactions
and no user’s control of the environment. Users’ interac-
tions with the virtual reality environment and possibility of
action (e.g. with eyes tracking or joystick) is an important
factor that has a positive inﬂuence on immersion and
presence in virtual reality.38

Future perspectives
Only a few studies have compared hypnosis, virtual
reality and virtual reality hypnosis.28,29 More studies
are required to improve the comparison of these comple-
mentary techniques in terms of efﬁcacy and cost-

effectiveness, cognitive functions and psychological
mechanisms in healthy participants and patients.

Our randomised study investigated the clinical effective-
ness of these techniques among patients in cardiac sur-
gery and in ICU and the results challenge current
perceptions around virtual reality in the medical ﬁeld,
the high expectations that stem from it, and the willing-
ness to use it for assorted medical issues. Publications
stating that hypnosis and virtual reality are effective
techniques abound in the literature but this could be
publication bias. It is important for our understanding
that studies showing nonsigniﬁcant results are published
more often. Only then, with the beneﬁt of diversiﬁed
information can we analyse for whom, and when these
techniques work for critical care patients.

Another perspective to investigate in terms of the effec-
tiveness of these techniques would be the importance of
the psychologist’s interaction with the patient, and how
this affects the patient’s motivation to use the technique.
Future studies should consider this therapeutic relation-
ship and include the investigator as a variable.

Most of the studies investigated the efﬁcacy of these
complementary techniques on pain reduction, and did
not establish a global evaluation of their use. This study
indicates a necessity to rethink protocols on hypnosis and
virtual reality by using multidimensional evaluations with
a view to assessing their real appropriateness for both
health-care staff and patients’ needs. Such complemen-
tary techniques should also be compared in terms of
applicability, agreeability, ease of use and adaptability
to the situation. A recent meta-analysis showed that
active peri-operative psychological interventions (beha-
vioural therapy, relaxation, guided imagery) moderately
reduced persistent postsurgical pain and physical
impairment.39 The authors concluded that researchers
and clinicians have to take into account individual pain
and distress following cardiac surgery and identify
patients who are more likely to beneﬁt from psychothera-
pies and complementary techniques: in other words, to
adapt the therapy to the patient.39

Conclusion
This randomised trial of cardiac surgery patients com-
pared hypnosis, virtual reality and VRH given presurgery
and postsurgery in ICU but results did not show any
differences in effectiveness, either between the techni-
ques themselves or between the techniques and no
treatment (i.e. the control group). At a fundamental level,
future randomised controlled trials could inform us as to
the phenomenological differences between hypnosis,
virtual reality and VRH. Regarding clinical practice,
further studies should consider multidimensional mea-
sures to compare techniques in order to establish guide-
lines for virtual reality and hypnosis use in cardiac surgery
or intensive care units.
