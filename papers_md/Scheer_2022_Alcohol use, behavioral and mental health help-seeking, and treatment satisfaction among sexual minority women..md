Abstract

Background:  Sexual minority women (SMW) report higher rates of heavy episodic drinking 
(HED) and alcohol-related outcomes, including poor mental health, than heterosexual women. 
These disparities indicate a greater need for behavioral and mental health treatment for SMW. 
This study examined associations between alcohol outcomes, behavioral and mental health help-
seeking, and treatment satisfaction among SMW by age, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and 
income.

Methods:  Participants included a community sample of 695 SMW (Mage = 40.0, SD = 14.1; 
74.1% lesbian, 25.9% bisexual; 37.6% White, 35.8% Black, 23.2% Latinx; 26.3% annual 
income $14,999 or less). We used bivariate analyses to characterize the sample’s demographic 
characteristics and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine associations among 
variables.

Results:  SMW subgroups based on age, race/ethnicity, and annual income differed in alcohol 
outcomes (i.e., HED, DSM-IV alcohol dependence, alcohol-related problem consequences, 
alcohol problem recognition, and motivation to reduce drinking); help-seeking; and treatment 
satisfaction. SMW who engaged in help-seeking for alcohol-related concerns, compared to those 
who did not, were more likely to meet criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence (adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR] = 7.13; 95% CI = 2.77; 18.36), endorse alcohol-related problem consequences (aOR 
= 11.44; 95% CI = 3.88; 33.71), recognize problematic drinking (aOR = 14.56; 95% CI = 3.37;

alcohol outcomes did not differ based on their satisfaction with treatment or with providers.

Conclusions:  This study’s findings confirm SMW’s elevated risk for HED and other alcohol-
related outcomes and underscore the importance of identity-affirmative and accessible behavioral 
and mental health treatment for young, Black, and low-income SMW. Clinicians and intervention 
scientists should develop or enhance existing brief behavioral and mental health treatments for 
SMW engaging in HED who may not recognize problematic drinking or who are not motivated to 
reduce drinking.

Introduction

Heavy episodic drinking (HED; defined as four or more drinks in one day for women; 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015) and other alcohol-related outcomes 
(e.g., alcohol dependence, alcohol-related problem consequences) place individuals at risk 
for poor health, representing a serious public health problem in the United States (U.S.; 
Linden-Carmichael et al., 2017). Rates of HED vary among women. Sexual minority women 
(SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual) are substantially more likely than heterosexual women to 
report HED (Hughes et al., 2020). For example, findings from a U.S. national sample 
demonstrated that compared to heterosexual women, SMW are nearly four times as likely 
to engage in HED (Fish et al., 2018). Another national study using probability sampling 
methods found that SMW are also 11 times more likely than heterosexual women to meet 
criteria for alcohol dependence (Drabble and Trocki, 2005). Given these disparities and that 
women with alcohol use disorders in the general population are less likely than men with 
alcohol use disorders to seek help (McCrady, 2020), it is essential to understand alcohol 
outcomes among SMW and identify which SMW are more likely to seek help, which 
are more likely to be satisfied with the help they receive, and the relationship between 
help-seeking and treatment satisfaction and alcohol outcomes.

SMW’s Sociodemographic Differences in Alcohol Use

Minority stressors (i.e., discrimination and associated stress reactions; Brooks, 1981; 
Meyer, 2003) account for some proportion of SMW’s higher risk of HED, alcohol 
dependence, and alcohol-related problem consequences (Evans-Polce et al., 2020; Hughes 
et al., 2020; Meyer, 2003). For instance, one study documented prospective associations 
between minority stress and alcohol-related problem consequences among 18 to 25-year-
old SMW (Wilson et al., 2016). SMW’s risk of HED, alcohol dependence, and alcohol-
related problem consequences likely varies across age, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, and 
income. Documenting sociodemographic differences related to these alcohol outcomes 
among SMW may confirm needed health disparities-reduction initiatives for this population 
(Terry-McElrath and Patrick, 2020).

In the general population researchers consistently find higher rates of HED among younger 
women than older women (Tucker et al., 2020). This pattern is also evident among 
SMW. For instance, a recent review demonstrated that rates of HED, alcohol dependence, 
and alcohol-related problem consequences were higher among younger than older SMW 
(Hughes et al., 2020). However, research on alcohol use and HED tend to show lower and 
slower age-related declines among SMW than heterosexual women (Hughes et al., 2006; 
Veldhuis et al., 2017).

Recent studies using nationally representative samples provide consistent evidence of 
within-group heterogeneity in HED and other alcohol-related outcomes across SMW’s 
sexual identity (Gattis et al., 2012). For example, findings from the 2015–2017 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health demonstrate that relative to monosexual SMW (i.e., 
lesbian), bisexual women had elevated odds of HED and alcohol use disorder (Schuler 
and Collins, 2020). Bisexual women’s risk of HED and other alcohol-related outcomes 
may be attributed to stressors that are more prevalent among bisexual women than lesbian 
women (e.g., anti-bisexual prejudice, sexual assault) (McConnell and Messman-Moore, 
2019; Scheer et al., 2019). Nevertheless, many researchers aggregate data across SMW 
subgroups, potentially masking unique risks for bisexual women (Hughes et al., 2020).

Rates of HED, alcohol dependence, and alcohol-related problem consequences also vary 
by race/ethnicity among SMW (Hughes et al., 2020). For example, one study using a 
community sample found that adult Black SMW were two to three times as likely as White 
SMW to report heavy drinking and were almost twice as likely to report drinking-related 
consequences (Hughes et al., 2006). Another study demonstrated that Latinx SMW were 
nearly three times as likely to report alcohol dependence as White SMW (Jeong et al., 
2016). However, Balsam and colleagues found no racial/ethnic differences in a national 
online study of young SMW’s alcohol use (Balsam et al., 2015).

There is a dearth of literature on income-based disparities in HED and other alcohol-related 
outcomes among SMW (Schuler et al., 2019). Nonetheless, there appears to be an income-
based discrepancy between women in the general population who consume more alcohol 
and those at greater risk of alcohol-attributable harms. For instance, although low-income 
women engage in HED at lower rates, they report alcohol-related problem consequences 
at higher rates than women with higher incomes – also referred to as the “alcohol harm 
paradox” (Mulia and Bensley, 2020). However, no studies have investigated whether this 
alcohol harm paradox exists among SMW.

Motivation to Reduce Drinking Among SMW

Alcohol harm reduction approaches focus on minimizing harm caused by excessive 
alcohol consumption with or without reductions in alcohol use (Witkiewitz et al., 2020). 
Nevertheless, reduced drinking is associated with improved quality of life among those with 
alcohol use disorders (Witkiewitz et al., 2019). Although prior research has documented 
SMW’s drinking motives (e.g., to increase positive affect, reduce negative affect, obtain 
social rewards, avoid social rejection; Dworkin et al., 2020), few studies have examined 
SMW’s motivation to reduce drinking.

Individuals’ varying levels of motivation to change their drinking patterns can influence 
the delivery and effectiveness of alcohol treatment (Witkiewitz et al., 2010). For example, 
motivational interviewing is more effective than behavioral skills training in reducing 
alcohol consumption for low-motivated clients (Witkiewitz et al., 2010). Moreover, whether 
SMW’s motivation to reduce drinking varies by age, sexual identity, race/ethnicity, or 
income has received little attention.

SMW’s Help-Seeking

Approximately 70% of people with an alcohol use disorder reduce or resolve their 
drinking problem without intervention (Tucker et al., 2020). However, engaging in treatment 
improves alcohol outcomes, including remission and recovery (Timko et al., 2006). 
Individuals with alcohol-related problems seek help from alcohol treatment programs and 
mental health providers, among other services (e.g., clergy assistance, mutual aid programs; 
Bourdon et al., 2020). Those with problematic alcohol use are more likely to seek mental 
health treatment than alcohol treatment (Edlund et al., 2012). In addition, individuals who 
engage in HED but do not meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder may benefit from early 
intervention approaches, such as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment 
(Babor et al., 2007).

Perceived need for services robustly predicts help-seeking for alcohol-related concerns 
(Lewis et al., 2016; Tucker et al., 2020; Tuithof et al., 2016). Yet, fewer than 25% of 
individuals who perceive a need for treatment (e.g., those who report comorbid mental 
health and substance use concerns, those with greater levels of alcohol dependence) utilize 
services for alcohol and related problems (Schuler et al., 2015; Tucker et al., 2020). 
Research using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related 
Conditions highlighted that only 7.5% of individuals who met criteria for DSM-IV alcohol 
abuse and 24.7% who met criteria for alcohol dependence reported seeking help at some 
point in their lifetime (Oleski et al., 2010).

The large and chronic gap between the perceived need for treatment and help-seeking is 
particularly pronounced among women (Tucker et al., 2020). For example, compared to 
men, women who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence had 
one-third to one-half the odds of seeking alcohol treatment services (Gilbert et al., 2019). 
Barriers to help-seeking (e.g., anticipated stigma, childcare issues, cost) may help explain 
the treatment gap between women who express concern about their drinking or who desire 
to reduce alcohol-related harm and women who access treatment (Pinedo et al., 2020; 
Schuler et al., 2015).

The gap between problematic alcohol use and help-seeking behavior may be even greater 
among SMW. Despite their increased health risks (Cerezo et al., 2021) and overall greater 
unmet mental health needs and perceived need for services (Filice and Meyer, 2018), SMW 
are less likely than heterosexual and sexual minority men to engage in alcohol treatment, but 
engage in alcohol treatment at about the same rates as heterosexual women (Batchelder et 
al., 2021). Recent findings also demonstrate that SMW, particularly bisexual women, report 
more barriers to accessing behavioral and mental health treatment than heterosexual women 
(Williams et al., 2021). Delayed help-seeking and unmet behavioral and mental health needs

among SMW may be compounded by a lack of identity-affirmative care (Cerezo et al., 
2021).

Help-seeking behaviors also likely vary within the SMW population. Understanding 
subgroup differences in help-seeking is essential to identify those in greatest need of 
services, develop culturally competent interventions, and reduce alcohol-related harms 
among SMW (Fish et al., 2021). However, research documenting SMW’s help-seeking is 
sparse (Cerezo et al., 2021; McCabe et al., 2013; Mulia and Bensley, 2020). Results from the 
few existing studies are inconsistent (Fish et al., 2021; Jeong et al., 2016). For example, one 
study found no interaction between race/ethnicity and sexual identity on service use (Filice 
and Meyer, 2018). Another study demonstrated that Latinx SMW accessed alcohol treatment 
at lower rates than White SMW (Jeong et al., 2016).

SMW’s Treatment Satisfaction

As identified recently in the general population (e.g., Kendra et al., 2015), treatment 
satisfaction is a critical component of patient-centered care. For example, clients who 
were more satisfied with their substance use treatment reported better treatment outcomes, 
including lower alcohol-related morbidity and dropout rates, reduced drinking days, and 
higher therapeutic alliance scores (Kendra et al., 2015; McCallum et al., 2016; Windle et al., 
2020). Women’s treatment dissatisfaction is associated with individual factors (e.g., financial 
difficulties), program characteristics (e.g., lack of gender-responsive services), and systemic 
factors (e.g., the societal stigma surrounding women’s substance use) (Gilbert et al., 2019).

Among women who seek alcohol treatment, SMW report lower levels of treatment 
satisfaction than heterosexual women (McCabe et al., 2013; Senreich, 2021); this is 
especially true for bisexual women (Beard et al., 2017). Similar findings have been reported 
among SMW accessing mental health services (Filice and Meyer, 2018; Williams et 
al., 2021). SMW report treatment dissatisfaction related to providers’ limited knowledge 
about SMW’s needs and discriminatory attitudes toward sexual minorities, as well as lack 
of programming tailored to SMW’s needs (Allen and Mowbray, 2016; McCabe et al., 
2013). Bisexual women and SMW of color report lower satisfaction with healthcare than 
monosexual SMW and White SMW, likely due to compounding effects of perceived and 
enacted biphobia, homophobia, and racism on the part of providers (Fish et al., 2021).

Help-Seeking, Treatment Satisfaction and Alcohol Outcomes among SMW

Findings regarding the relationship between help-seeking and alcohol problem severity are 
inconsistent. Some results show a strong positive association between help-seeking and 
alcohol use disorder severity (Grella et al., 2009), while others show a negative association 
(Tucker et al., 2020). Yet, the extent to which these findings apply to SMW is unknown. 
Moreover, given that alcohol problem recognition may be the first step toward behavioral 
change (Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982), there have been calls for research examining 
the role of help-seeking in promoting alcohol problem recognition and motivation to 
reduce drinking (Glass et al., 2015). Despite this promising line of inquiry, no studies 
have examined SMW’s help-seeking in the context of alcohol problem recognition and 
motivation to reduce drinking. Moreover, whether alcohol outcomes among SMW vary

based on behavioral and mental health treatment satisfaction and satisfaction with providers 
remains poorly understood.

SMW’s Self-Perceptions of Problematic Drinking

Motivation to change is critical to engaging in drinking-reduction strategies, including 
help-seeking (Chang et al., 2021). Likewise, alcohol problem recognition, a cognitive 
dimension of motivation, is critical to promoting behavior change (Miller and Rollnick, 
2012; Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982). Findings suggest that many people who report 
HED and other alcohol-related outcomes do not recognize harms associated with their 
drinking (Chang et al., 2021). In addition, prior studies have mainly focused on the 
extent to which drinking expectancies influence drinking behavior (Madden and Clapp, 
2019). Facilitating SMW’s accurate perceptions of their drinking and readiness to change 
(Morgenstern et al., 2016) represent essential treatment targets in reducing alcohol-related 
harms among SMW. Yet virtually no studies have examined SMW’s alcohol problem 
recognition and motivation to change in the context of HED and other alcohol-related 
outcomes (i.e., alcohol dependence and alcohol-related problem consequences).

The Present Study

Aims of the current study were to examine: (1) whether alcohol outcomes (i.e., HED, 
DSM-IV alcohol dependence, alcohol-related problem consequences, alcohol problem 
recognition, and motivation to reduce drinking) varied by SMW’s age, sexual identity, 
race/ethnicity, and income; (2) sociodemographic correlates of behavioral and mental 
health help-seeking, including for alcohol problems, and satisfaction with treatment and 
with treatment providers: a) in general, and b) after controlling for alcohol outcomes; 
and (3) associations between SMW’s help-seeking and treatment satisfaction and alcohol 
outcomes, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Our fourth, exploratory aim, was 
to examine bivariate associations among alcohol outcomes, adjusting for sociodemographic 
characteristics. Figure 1 represents a conceptual model of the hypothesized directionality of 
variables in the first three study aims.

Defining alcohol dependence and alcohol-related problem consequences is necessary 
to make meaningful comparisons in epidemiological research (Stickel et al., 2017). 
The current study used DSM-IV criteria of alcohol dependence, including tolerance to 
the physical effects of alcohol, physiological withdrawal, preoccupation with alcohol, 
difficulty controlling alcohol use, and continued consumption despite harmful consequences 
(American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Alcohol-related problem consequences were 
defined as adverse harms and risk behaviors related to alcohol use (Keyes et al., 2019).

Method

Participants and Procedures

Data are from Wave 3 of the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women (CHLEW) 
study (see Hughes et al., 2021 for more details), a community-based, 21-year, five-wave 
longitudinal study of SMW aged 18 and older. Wave 3 data were collected in 2010–2012 
(N = 353 women were retained [response rate= 79%] from the original cohort). By Wave 3,

Measures

approximately 100 participants had moved out of the Chicago metropolitan area. A modified 
version of respondent-driven sampling was used to recruit a supplemental sample of bisexual 
women, younger (18–25 years) SMW, and Black and Latinx SMW (N = 373). Notably, 
some SMW of color in Wave 3 were recruited in Wave 1. We used data from Wave 3 
because it includes the largest and most diverse sample (N = 726; 353 SMW from the 
original cohort and 373 SMW from the supplemental cohort). Of these, four SMW who 
were believed to have misrepresented their sexual identity were not included in this study. 
Consistent with our prior research, women who identified as mostly heterosexual, only 
heterosexual, or other were also excluded from analyses, leaving a final sample of 695. 
Data were collected using computer-assisted in-person or telephone interviews (Hughes et 
al., 2021). The Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) 
approved study procedures.

Help-seeking.—Behavioral and mental health help-seeking, including for alcohol 
problems, was assessed with two questions. First, help-seeking for alcohol problems was 
assessed using responses to the question, “During the past five years, have you gone to 
anyone – a treatment agency, Alcoholics Anonymous, anyone at all – for help with a 
drinking problem of your own?” (0 = no; 1 = yes). Second, inability to access needed 
services for a behavioral or mental health problem, including alcohol use, (hereafter, 
“inability to access needed services”), was characterized by an affirmative response to, 
“During the past five years, has there been a mental health problem, including alcohol use, 
for which you wanted or needed services that you were unable to obtain?” (0 = no, 1 = yes).

Treatment satisfaction.—Treatment satisfaction for behavioral and mental health 
problems (hereafter, “treatment satisfaction”) was assessed by asking participants who 
received help to what extent their needs were met. Response options were: none of my 
needs were met (0), only a few of my needs were met (1), most of my needs were met (2), or 
almost all my needs were met (3). Responses were dichotomized as no needs were met (0) 
vs. at least a few needs were met (1). Satisfaction with mental health providers was assessed 
with the question, “Thinking about the mental health provider(s) you saw most recently, did 
the services… hurt you a lot (0), hurt you a little (1), make no difference (2), help you a little 
(3), help you a little (4) or help you a lot (5).” Responses were dichotomized as services hurt 
or did not help (0) vs. helped at least a little (1).

Alcohol outcomes.—The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism’s 
(NIAAA’s) current definition of HED among women is ≥4 drinks in one day (U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Because the CHLEW study replicated 
a 20-year longitudinal study of alcohol use among women in the general population, the 
alcohol quantity question used “6 or more drinks” as the cut-off for HED (a threshold 
that was adopted from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Bradley et al., 2003; 
Wilsnack et al., 1984). Thus, we combined responses to this question with responses to 
a question asking about the typical number of drinks participants consumed on drinking 
days to increase our measure’s sensitivity for detecting NIAAA-defined HED while also 
maintaining its specificity for identifying this particular drinking behavior. Participants were

classified as having past-12-month HED if they consumed either ≥6 drinks on one or more 
days in the past 12 months or if they typically consumed ≥4 drinks on drinking days (1 = 
at least one episode of consuming ≥6 drinks on one or more days in the past 12 months or 
consuming ≥4 drinks on drinking days, 0 = neither).

Participants who endorsed three or more past-year DSM-IV alcohol dependence symptoms 
(e.g., continued alcohol use despite drinking-related consequences) from five criteria were 
coded as meeting study criteria for past-year DSM-IV alcohol dependence (Cronbach’s α = 
.74; Hasin et al., 2003).

An eight-item scale was used to assess past-year alcohol-related problem consequences (e.g., 
drunk driving; Cronbach’s α = .65; Midanik, 1982; Wilsnack et al., 1984). We created a 
binary variable indicating the presence of fewer than two (0) vs. two or more alcohol-related 
problem consequences (1).

Lifetime alcohol problem recognition was determined by whether participants indicated that 
they had ever wondered if they were developing a drinking problem (0 = no, 1 = yes).

Motivation to reduce drinking was defined based on whether participants endorsed wanting 
or trying to cut down or stop drinking alcohol in the past year (0 = no, 1 = yes).

Sociodemographic characteristics.—Participants reported their age, sexual identity 
(lesbian, bisexual), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latinx), income (annual income over 
$14,999 vs. annual income $14,999 or less), parental status (non-parent vs. parent), and 
relationship status (currently in a relationship vs. not currently in a relationship). Response 
options for sexual identity included ‘only lesbian/gay,’ ‘mostly lesbian/gay,’ ‘bisexual,’ 
‘mostly heterosexual,’ ‘only heterosexual/straight,’ and ‘other.’ We created a dummy 
variable to represent those who identified as ‘only lesbian/gay’ or ‘mostly lesbian/gay’ 
(0) or ‘bisexual’ (1). Income was assessed with the following question: “For the last tax 
year, which of these categories represents your total household income, from all sources? 
Household means everyone living in your house that you consider part of your family.” 
Response options ranged from ‘under $1,000’ to ‘$200,000 or more.’ Consistent with prior 
studies on barriers to help-seeking for alcohol-related problems, we used a dichotomous 
variable (0 = above lowest quartile [> $14,999]); 1 = under lowest quartile [≤ $14,999]; 
Gayman et al., 2011).

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and proportions, were used 
to characterize the sample’s demographics. Bivariate analyses were used to examine 
associations among sociodemographic characteristics. Next, in separate multivariable 
logistic regression models, we examined associations between sociodemographic 
characteristics and alcohol outcomes. Then, in separate multivariable logistic regression 
models, we regressed help-seeking and treatment satisfaction variables (i.e., help-seeking 
for alcohol problems, inability to access needed services, treatment satisfaction, satisfaction 
with providers), respectively, on sociodemographic characteristics. Only participants who 
accessed services were asked about treatment satisfaction and satisfaction with providers.

Finally, in separate logistic regression models, we regressed alcohol outcomes on behavioral 
and mental health help-seeking and treatment satisfaction. As an exploratory aim, logistic 
regression analyses examined bivariate associations among alcohol outcomes.

Sample sizes depended on the amount of missing data for each model. Missing data for 
explanatory variables and covariates ranged from 0 for age to 31 (4.5%) for income. Missing 
data for alcohol outcomes, behavioral and mental health help-seeking, and treatment 
satisfaction variables ranged from 0 for inability to access needed services to 97 (14.0%) 
for motivation to reduce drinking. We used complete case analysis (i.e., missing data were 
handled using pairwise deletion; Jamshidian and Mata, 2007). Only SMW who sought 
help for behavioral or mental health problems, including alcohol use, were included in 
the treatment satisfaction models. Specifically, 57.1% (n = 397) of the total sample were 
included in the treatment satisfaction models and 58.7% (n = 408) were included in the 
satisfaction with provider models. Additional sample size information for each model is 
presented in Tables 1–4 and in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2.

We present exponentiated coefficients (adjusted odds ratios [aORs]), 95% confidence 
intervals (Cis), and p-values. Analyses were conducted in SPSS version 27. We also 
performed a post-hoc adjustment of p values using Benjamini-Hochberg procedures, given 
that we examined multiple regression models (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

Three post-hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, we assessed SMW who reported 
four or more (vs. one) episodes of past-year HED based on NIAAA’s criteria for women 
(≥4 drinks in one day; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted for all models; these analyses revealed negligible differences in 
results (below). Second, we regressed help-seeking and treatment satisfaction variables, 
respectively, on sociodemographic characteristics after accounting for differences in alcohol 
outcomes, given the well-established relationship between alcohol outcomes and help-
seeking across epidemiologic studies (Tucker et al., 2020). Third, we regressed help-seeking 
and treatment satisfaction variables, respectively, on sociodemographic characteristics 
among SMW who reported past-12-month HED.

Results

Sample Characteristics

Participants were, on average, 40.0 years of age (SD = 14.1; range = 18 to 82). The majority 
identified as lesbian (74.1%); 25.9% identified as bisexual (see Table 1). Relatively equal 
percentages of participants identified as White (37.6%) and Black (35.8%); fewer (23.2%) 
identified as Latinx. More than a fourth (26.3%) of the sample reported annual incomes 
of $14,999 or less. The majority of participants did not have children (61.9%) and were 
currently in a relationship (60.7%).

Compared with bisexual women, lesbian women were older, more likely to report annual 
incomes over $14,999, and more likely to be in a current relationship. Similarly, White 
SMW were older, more likely to report annual incomes over $14,999, more likely to be in a 
current relationship, and less likely to have children than SMW of color. SMW who reported

annual incomes over $14,999 were older and more likely to be in a current relationship than 
those who reported annual incomes of $14,999 or less.

Of the total sample, 292 (43.0%) reported past-year HED, 72 (10.4%) met study criteria for 
past-year DSM-IV alcohol dependence, 82 (11.8%) reported two or more past-year alcohol-
related problem consequences, 271 (39.0%) reported lifetime alcohol problem recognition, 
and 153 (22.0%) reported past-year motivation to reduce drinking.

Of the total sample, 27 (3.9%) reported seeking help for alcohol-related problems; 519 
(74.7%) did not indicate that they had sought help for alcohol-related problems. Rates of 
help-seeking for alcohol-related problems were the same when restricting the sample to 
those who reported past-year HED. Of the total sample, 96 (13.8%) reported being unable 
to access needed services for a behavioral or mental health problem, including alcohol use, 
whereas 599 (86.2%) did not report being unable to access needed services for a behavioral 
or mental health problem, including alcohol use. Of those who received help, 365 (52.5%) 
reported that at least a few needs were met and 32 (4.6%) reported that no needs were met. 
Less than half (339; 48.8%) reported that their providers helped at least a little; and 69 
(9.9%) reported that their providers hurt or did not help them.

Associations between Sociodemographic Characteristics and Alcohol Outcomes

Older SMW were less likely than younger SMW to report HED (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI = 
0.94; 0.96) and alcohol-related problem consequences (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.93; 0.97; 
see Table 2). Black SMW were four times as likely as White SMW to meet study criteria for 
DSM-IV alcohol dependence (aOR = 4.08; 95% CI = 1.95; 8.54) and two times as likely to 
report motivation to reduce drinking (aOR = 2.01; 95% CI = 1.25; 3.25). Latinx SMW were 
less likely than White SMW to report alcohol problem recognition (aOR = 0.62; 95% CI = 
0.40; 0.95). Alcohol outcomes did not vary by sexual identity or income.

Our first post-hoc sensitivity analysis examining SMW who reported four or more (vs. one) 
episodes of past-year HED based on NIAAA’s definition of HED among women revealed 
consistent findings across SMW’s age, sexual identity, and income. However, with respect 
to race/ethnicity, Black SMW were more likely than White SMW to report four or more 
episodes of past-year HED (aOR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.02; 3.09). Similarly, Latinx SMW were 
more than twice as likely as White SMW to report four or more episodes of past-year HED 
(aOR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.27; 3.89).

Associations between Sociodemographic Characteristics and Help-Seeking and Treatment 
Satisfaction

Compared to younger SMW, older SMW were less likely to report inability to access needed 
services (aOR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95; 0.99). Older SMW who received help were more 
likely than younger SMW to report treatment satisfaction (aOR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.03; 1.13) 
and satisfaction with mental health providers (aOR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02; 1.08; see Table 
3). These patterns persisted when adjusting for alcohol outcomes (see Supplemental Table 
1).

We found no differences in help-seeking or treatment satisfaction by sexual identity even 
when accounting for differences in alcohol outcomes. However, over and above the effects 
of sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol outcomes, Black SMW were less likely 
than White SMW to report inability to access needed services (aOR = 0.42; 95% CI = 
0.22; 0.83). Black SMW were also less likely than White SMW to report satisfaction with 
treatment (aOR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.12; 0.82); this finding held after adjusting for alcohol 
outcomes. We found no differences in help-seeking or treatment satisfaction between Latinx 
SMW and White SMW with and without adjusting for alcohol outcomes.

Compared to SMW with annual incomes over $14,999, those whose incomes were $14,999 
or less were less likely to report satisfaction with mental health providers (aOR = 0.44; 95% 
CI = 0.24; 0.79); this finding held after adjusting for alcohol outcomes. Over and above 
the effects of alcohol outcomes, compared to SMW with annual incomes over $14,999, 
those whose incomes were $14,999 or less were more than eight times as likely to report 
help-seeking for alcohol-related problems (aOR = 8.06; 95% CI = 1.93; 33.73).

These patterns persisted when examining associations between sociodemographic 
characteristics and help-seeking and treatment satisfaction only among SMW who reported 
engaging in HED in the past 12 months.

The Role of Help-Seeking and Treatment Satisfaction in SMW’s Alcohol Outcomes

Table 4 displays results from logistic regression models examining associations 
between help-seeking and treatment satisfaction and alcohol outcomes, adjusting for 
sociodemographic characteristics. Help-seeking for alcohol problems was positively 
associated with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (aOR = 7.13; 95% CI = 2.77; 18.36), alcohol-
related problem consequences (aOR = 11.44; 95% CI = 3.88; 33.71), alcohol problem 
recognition (aOR = 14.56; 95% CI = 3.37; 62.97), and motivation to reduce drinking (aOR 
= 5.26; 95% CI = 1.74; 15.88). Inability to access needed services, treatment satisfaction, 
and satisfaction with mental health providers were not associated with alcohol outcomes. 
However, our post-hoc sensitivity analysis revealed that inability to access needed services 
was positively associated with reporting four or more episodes of past-year HED (aOR = 
1.79; 95% CI = 1.05; 3.07).

Associations among SMW’s Alcohol Outcomes

We also examined associations among alcohol outcomes. As shown in Supplemental Table 
2, HED was associated with DSM-IV alcohol dependence (aOR = 12.49; 95% CI = 
5.44; 28.67) and alcohol-related problem consequences (aOR = 8.57; 95% CI = 4.06; 
18.08). DSM-IV alcohol dependence was positively associated with alcohol-related problem 
consequences (aOR = 9.85; 95% CI = 5.19; 18.68). Alcohol problem recognition was 
associated with HED (aOR = 2.32; 95% CI = 1.61; 3.33), DSM-IV alcohol dependence 
(aOR = 7.78; 95% CI = 4.20; 14.42), and alcohol-related problem consequences (aOR = 
3.25; 95% CI = 1.91; 5.53), and motivation to reduce drinking (aOR = 3.63; 95% CI = 2.41; 
5.48). SMW who were motivated to reduce drinking were more likely than those who were 
not to report HED (aOR = 3.48; 95% CI = 2.24; 5.41), DSM-IV alcohol dependence (aOR

95% CI = 1.97; 5.72).

Discussion

Extending previous research (Evans-Polce et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2020), the current 
study highlights heterogeneity in SMW’s alcohol outcomes, behavioral and mental health 
help-seeking, and treatment satisfaction.

HED, DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and alcohol-related problem consequences varied 
among SMW by age and race/ethnicity, but not by sexual identity or income. Specifically 
and aligned with prior findings (Hughes et al., 2020; Schuler and Collins, 2020), younger 
SMW were more likely than older SMW to report HED and alcohol-related problem 
consequences. Also consistent with existing research (Balsam et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 
2006; Hughes et al., 2020), Black and Latinx SMW were more likely than White SMW 
to report HED and to meet criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence, but no more likely to 
report alcohol-related problem consequences. In fact, Black and Latinx SMW were more 
likely to report four or more episodes of HED in the past year. The finding that Black and 
Latinx SMW were no more likely than White SMW to report alcohol-related consequences 
differs from research with general population samples which indicates that racial/ethnic 
minorities report more severe alcohol-related problem consequences than White individuals 
(Witbrodt et al., 2014). Future studies should examine potential moderators, such as drinking 
to cope with heterosexist, racist, and sexist discrimination, to identify SMW of color who 
may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol-problem consequences (Cerezo and Ramirez, 
2020). SMW reported similar HED and other alcohol outcomes regardless of sexual identity 
or income. Thus, we found no evidence of the “alcohol harm paradox” (i.e., low-income 
people engage in HED at lower rates but report alcohol-related problem consequences at 
higher rates than people with higher incomes; Mulia and Bensley, 2020). Additional research 
is needed to examine whether alcohol outcomes vary among SMW across sexual attraction 
or behavior and other socioeconomic factors, including financial distress and access to 
health insurance.

SMW differed in their motivation to reduce drinking only across race/ethnicity. Specifically, 
although Black SMW were less likely than White SMW to report alcohol-related problems, 
they were more than twice as likely to report being motivated to reduce drinking. Future 
studies should examine whether anticipated stigma from interviewers and normative beliefs 
(e.g., perceptions of others’ approval of drinking levels; Blevins et al., 2018) might influence 
SMW’s likelihood of recognizing or disclosing problematic drinking to interviewers.

This study also extended previous findings (McCabe et al., 2013; Mulia and Bensley, 2020) 
by demonstrating heterogeneity in SMW’s behavioral and mental health help-seeking and 
treatment satisfaction across sociodemographic characteristics. For example, older SMW 
were more likely than younger SMW to report accessing needed behavioral or mental health 
services and being satisfied with treatment and providers, even after accounting for alcohol 
outcomes. In addition, consistent with some research (Filice and Meyer, 2018; Jeong et al., 
2016), Black SMW were more likely to report accessing needed services but were less likely

to report treatment satisfaction than White SMW. Similar patterns have been observed in the 
general population, with research indicating that people of color are less likely than White 
people to receive high-quality and culturally sensitive care, likely due to implicit provider 
biases and institutional racism (Mays et al., 2017).

We found significant differences in help-seeking for alcohol-related problems based on 
income. When accounting for alcohol outcomes, SMW whose incomes were $14,999 or less 
were more than eight times as likely to report help-seeking for alcohol-related problems 
but were less likely to report satisfaction with mental health providers than SMW whose 
incomes were over $14,999. Few people living in poverty report satisfaction with healthcare 
services (Willie et al., 2020) and access to high-quality services (Funk et al., 2009). SMW 
living in poverty may not benefit from behavioral and mental health treatment to the same 
extent as SMW with higher incomes (Hodgkinson et al., 2017). Moreover, low-income 
SMW may be more likely to access alcohol services than SMW with higher incomes 
because they may be more likely to have coverage for substance use disorder treatment (e.g., 
through Medicaid), yet this expansion of coverage may not translate to increased access to 
identity-affirmative treatment (Olfson et al., 2018).

We also examined behavioral and mental health help-seeking and treatment satisfaction 
by sociodemographic characteristics in a subsample restricted to SMW who reported past-
month HED. Findings suggest that young, Black, and low-income SMW who engage in 
HED but do not meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder may benefit from increased access 
to brief behavioral and mental health interventions (e.g., Screening, Brief Intervention, and 
Referral to Treatment; Babor et al., 2007) with identity-affirmative providers.

When examining associations between help-seeking and alcohol outcomes we found that 
SMW who sought help for alcohol-related problems were more than seven times as likely 
to meet study criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence and more than 11 times as likely 
to report alcohol-related problem consequences than SMW who did not seek help. This 
study extends prior research that has primarily applied self-selection models to explain why 
HED and other alcohol-related outcomes influence help-seeking (Moos and Moos, 2004). 
For example, one study found that individuals with elevated risk of HED were more likely 
to seek help than those with less severe alcohol-related problems (Witkiewitz et al., 2019). 
The current study is among the first to find that an inability to access needed behavioral and 
mental health services was associated with four or more episodes of past-year HED. Future 
studies should build on these results and examine whether continued treatment engagement 
is associated with a reduction in alcohol-related problems among those who seek behavioral 
and mental health services.

SMW who engaged in help-seeking for alcohol-related problems were more than 14 times 
as likely to report alcohol problem recognition and were more than five times as likely 
to be motivated to reduce drinking. These findings are supported by the transtheoretical 
model (Prochaska and DiClemente, 1982). For instance, SMW who sought help for alcohol-
related problems may have decreased or resolved their ambivalence about drinking (Rice 
et al., 2014). It could also be that participants who chose to seek help for alcohol-related 
problems were already less ambivalent about needing to change their drinking behavior.

Other psychological factors, including self-efficacy and help-seeking attitudes, may also 
contribute to recognizing problematic drinking and being motivated to reduce drinking 
(Glass et al., 2015).

Among individuals in the general population who misuse alcohol, many do not recognize 
alcohol-attributable harms (Chang et al., 2021). However, we found that SMW who reported 
HED, met study criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and reported two or more alcohol-
related problem consequences were more likely to report alcohol problem recognition than 
SMW who did not report HED and other alcohol-related outcomes. Similarly, SMW who 
were motivated to reduce drinking were over three times as likely to report HED, meet 
study criteria for DSM-IV alcohol dependence, report two or more alcohol-related problem 
consequences, and report alcohol problem recognition. SMW who engage in HED and 
report other alcohol-related outcomes seem to accurately recognize problems associated 
with their drinking. SMW may respond well to motivational interviewing approaches that 
are tailored to their awareness of drinking problems and level of motivation to reduce 
drinking (Miller and Rollnick, 2012).

Clinical and Policy Implications

Our findings offer support for person-centered and multimodal treatment approaches 
tailored to SMW’s unique needs (e.g., psychoeducation about alcohol-related consequences, 
motivation to reduce drinking) and individual characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, 
income). Evidence-based, coordinated care is also needed to improve communication and 
shared decision-making – promising treatment strategies that can enhance healthcare quality 
among low-income people (Santiago et al., 2013), and SMW in particular (Steele et al., 
2017). Reimbursement for comprehensive addiction treatment among SMW who access 
public insurance plans is also needed. Recognizing problematic drinking behavior could 
serve as a treatment target for SMW, given the overlap of SMW who wondered whether 
they were developing a drinking problem and those who reported high-risk drinking (e.g., 
HED) and who were motivated to reduce drinking. Tailored behavioral and mental health 
interventions that match SMW’s motivation level in reducing drinking may also prove 
helpful (Witkiewitz et al., 2010).

Limitations and Future Research Directions

Several limitations should be considered. Whether our results generalize to SMW living 
outside of the Chicago Metropolitan Area in Illinois remains unknown. Data were cross-
sectional, and measures used inconsistent timeframes, limiting our ability to address 
temporal sequencing among study variables. Further, data were collected in 2010–2012. 
Societal attitudes toward sexual minorities appear to have improved; SMW today may report 
fewer barriers to and greater satisfaction with treatment. Newer studies need to determine 
whether this is the case or whether our findings are replicated, particularly for younger 
SMW, bisexual women, racial/ethnic minority SMW, and SMW living in poverty.

This study utilized retrospective self-report measures and several measures were single-item 
indicators. There were no measures of the reasons SMW utilized services, or of services 
or provider characteristics. For example, individuals with problematic alcohol use are more

likely to seek mental health treatment than alcohol treatment (Edlund et al., 2012). This 
study did not distinguish among substance use disorder treatment, general mental health 
providers, and other support sources. Also, our HED measure may not have identified HED 
among SMW who typically drank three or fewer drinks, but occasionally consumed four or 
more.

Several directions for future research are reviewed below. To improve understanding of 
help-seeking and treatment satisfaction among SMW, additional research is needed to 
compare our results with those from samples of SMW who are in recovery or who engage 
in high-intensity HED. Future research should also consider including SMW who are not 
exclusively cisgender and who report a broader range of sexual identities and racial/ethnic 
identities. Other variables not included in this study, such as mental health comorbidities 
and prior help-seeking experiences, may be associated with help-seeking and treatment 
satisfaction among SMW (Allen and Mowbray, 2016; Hughes et al., 2020; McCabe et 
al., 2013). Longitudinal studies are needed to test prospective associations between help-
seeking, treatment satisfaction, and alcohol outcomes among SMW. Future studies could 
build on our findings by exploring the potential role of ambivalence in reducing drinking 
among SMW and whether different mechanisms (e.g., alcohol craving, alcohol expectancies, 
alcohol cue reactivity) influence alcohol problem recognition and motivation to reduce 
drinking across SMW’s sociodemographic characteristics.

Interventions are needed that enhance treatment motivation among SMW, particularly 
those who are ambivalent about changing their behavior – for example, by eliciting client 
statements for change (Kuerbis et al., 2018). Also, no studies to date have examined whether 
SMW benefit from receiving treatment tailored to their perceptions of problematic drinking 
or their motivation to reduce drinking (i.e., modularized treatment approaches; Witkiewitz 
et al., 2010). Researchers should also aim to understand SMW’s goals for treatment (e.g., 
moderate drinking vs. abstinence) to help develop tailored behavioral and mental health 
interventions for this population (Pachankis et al., 2020; Scheer et al., in press). Finally, 
determining whether the timing of SMW’s help-seeking impacts alcohol outcomes could 
identify resources for those who delay needed treatment compared to those who report 
repeated treatment episodes.

Conclusion

The current study highlights heterogeneity in SMW’s alcohol outcomes, behavioral and 
mental health help-seeking, and treatment satisfaction across age, sexual identity, race/
ethnicity, and income. Our findings underscore the importance of increasing SMW’s access 
to culturally sensitive and effective personalized behavioral and mental health treatment – 
especially SMW who are at heightened risk for HED and negative alcohol-related outcomes, 
who are unable to access needed services, and who are not satisfied with their treatment or 
providers. Delivering alcohol interventions that match SMW’s level of motivation to reduce 
drinking and identifying multi-level barriers to recognizing problematic alcohol use may be 
particularly important for younger SMW, SMW of color, and SMW with low incomes.
