Abstract
Purpose  Lifestyle factors of children and adolescents’ mental health problems are an emerging health issue in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a lack of studies on lifestyle factors in LMICs. This study examined the 
socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with mental health problems among school-age children in Mongolia.
Methods  A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 4th-year students at public elementary schools in 
one district in Ulaanbaatar. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and a self-administrated socioeconomic and 
lifestyle questionnaire were completed by participants’ guardians. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed.
Results  Of the 2301 children surveyed, 1694 without missing responses were included in the analysis. The multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that male gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.64 (1.29–2.10)], low maternal educa-
tion [AOR 1.89 (1.16–3.05)], short sleep [AOR 1.41 (1.10–1.80)], no physical activity [AOR 1.31 (1.03–1.67)], and long 
screen time (AOR 1.53 (1.20–1.94)) were associated with high risk of mental health problems. Low maternal education, low 
household income, no physical activity habit, and long screen time were associated with internalising problems. Meanwhile, 
male gender, low maternal education, and long screen time were associated with externalising problems.
Conclusion  The results are consistent with previous studies in high-income countries, indicating that there are globally com-
mon socioeconomic and lifestyle risk factors. The findings of this study may help develop a targeted preventive intervention 
for high-risk groups, such as socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, as well as a universal preventive intervention to 
foster a healthy lifestyle in Mongolia.

Introduction

Children’s and adolescents’ mental health is an impor-
tant health issue. Globally, about 10–20% of children and 
adolescents experience some form of mental health prob-
lem [1]. In low-middle-income countries (LMICs), where 
about 90% of the child population in the world reside [2], 
it has been estimated that 13.2–20.1% of years lived with 
disability among children under 20 years of age was attrib-
utable to mental disorders and 0.4–1.1% to substance use 
disorder in 2019 [3]. As childhood mental health problems 
can lead to lasting social and professional impairment, 
the prevention, detection, and treatment of mental health 
problems in children and adolescents are important [4].

In addition to basic socioeconomic risk factors [5], the 
influence of a modern lifestyle on children’s mental health 
is gaining attention. With lifestyles becoming more mod-
ernised, children are spending less time on physical activi-
ties and more time on sedentary activities, especially those 
involving digital devices (screen time). A day consists of 
sleep time, sedentary time, and various intensity physical 
activities. Moreover, due to the lifestyle changes brought 
about by the COVID-19 pandemic, more attention is being 
paid to the influence of modernised lifestyles on children’s 
and adolescents’ mental health [6, 7]. Systematic reviews 
have shown that physical inactivity has association with 
depression and anxiety among children and adolescents 
[8], and that screen time is associated with depression 
among  children  and  adolescents  [9,  10].  Some  studies 
demonstrated that long screen time causes attention prob-
lems among children [11, 12]. One meta-analysis reported 
that sleep loss is associated with depression [13]. Accord-
ing to another systematic review, physical inactivity, long 
sedentary time and short sleep together pose higher risk 
on children’s and adolescents’ depression [14]. Consider-
ing the various risks as a result of lifestyle behaviours, 
the World Health Organisation recommends increasing 
physical activities, reducing sedentary time—especially 
screen time—among children, and initiating national plan 
to promote these healthy habits in each country [15]. Can-
ada and Australia developed 24-h movement guidelines 
and recommend 60 min or more of moderate to vigorous 
physical activity per day, no more than 120 min of leisure 
screen time per day, and 9–11 h of sleep for children aged 
5–13 years [16, 17]. However, most countries that have 
implemented national policies to address lifestyle changes 
among children are high-income countries (HICs).

In LMICs, where epidemiological transition is occur-
ring,  the  impact  of  children’s  and  adolescents’  mental 
health problems including psychological developmental 
problems is increasing. However, it is known that child 
and adolescent mental health problems have been severely 

Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2022) 57:791–803

underserved in most LMICs [18]. Untreated mental health 
problems among children and youth in LMICs have long-
term effects such as poor academic attainment, lost produc-
tivity, and chronic disability in adulthood and ultimately 
hinder development at the national level [18]. Understand-
ing the risk factors for mental health and behavioural prob-
lems is highly beneficial as it helps develop and implement 
preventive interventions [19,  20]. However, even basic 
socioeconomic risk factors have not been fully investi-
gated  in  LMICs.  Several  studies  conducted  in  LMICs 
have suggested an association between low socioeconomic 
status (e.g. low maternal education and one-parent fam-
ily) and children’s mental health and behavioural prob-
lems [21–25]. Regarding lifestyle factors, analyses of the 
Global school-based Student Health Survey revealed that 
long sedentary time increases the odds of depressive and 
anxiety symptoms among adolescents from LMICs [26, 
27]. Nevertheless, very few studies have investigated the 
association between lifestyle factors and mental health 
using a valid assessment tool [28, 29]. To promote child 
and adolescent mental health in LMICs, there is a need to 
elucidate whether there exist similar basic risk factors and 
similar preventive strategies are applicable in LMICs com-
pared to HICs. Considering the obvious lack of evidence, 
more studies of basic child and adolescent mental health 
risk factors are needed in LMICs.

There is a paucity of studies pertaining to mental health 
and its associated factors among children and adolescents 
in Mongolia. Thus, this study aimed to identify the socio-
economic and lifestyle factors associated with children’s 
mental health problems, using data from a population-based 
study on school-age children in the capital city of Mongo-
lia. Children’s mental health was assessed using a validated 
mental health screening tool, and their socioeconomic fac-
tors, physical activity time, screen time, and sleep duration 
were analysed to determine their association with children’s 
mental health. In addition to contributing to the Mongolian 
health policy, this study sought to contribute to the literature 
on child and adolescent mental health in LMICs—particu-
larly countries where the epidemiological transition is occur-
ring—by accumulating evidence.

Methods

Study design

This is a cross-sectional analysis. We analysed a part of the 
data from a randomised controlled trial to examine the effec-
tiveness of exercise intervention for academic achievement, 
cognitive function, and physical health among children in 
Mongolia, which was conducted by our research team in 

1 3Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2022) 57:791–803

2018. Details of the study methodology and results are pro-
vided elsewhere [30, 31].

Study setting

The original randomised controlled trial (RCT) was con-
ducted in the Sukhbaatar district of Ulaanbaatar, the capital 
city of Mongolia. Mongolia is a lower-middle-income and 
former communist country in Western Pacific Asia with a 
population of approximately 3,170,000 people [32]. The 
country  has  already  developed  a  primary  healthcare 
and a social insurance system, and the health standards of 
Mongolian people are above the average levels compared to 
the health standards of citizens of countries with a similar 
economic level [33]. Mental health needs are considered to 
be high according to previous surveys that reported that a 
considerable proportion of children and young people have 
mental health concerns [34–36]. To date, only one risk fac-
tor analysis has been performed in Mongolia, and it revealed 
a strong association between family factors (e.g. maternal 
depression and children’s behavioural problem) and mental 
health among young children in a rural area [35].

The capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is the main cultural, indus-
trial and administrative centre of the country, where almost 
half of the country’s population resides. It has nine dis-
tricts with no distinct differences in administration, socio-
economic conditions, health, and cultural factors among 
inhabitants. The population of the Sukhbaatar district rep-
resents roughly 10% of the population of Ulaanbaatar [37].

Study population

Participants in this study were the participants of a baseline 
survey of the original RCT. The original RCT recruited all 
fourth-year students from 10 of the 11 public elementary 
schools in the district (one school participated in the pilot 
phase) and examined the effectiveness of a short exercise 
programme on their achievement at the national examina-
tion in a 10-month follow up. Inclusion criteria were: (1) 
attendance at one of the 10 schools that participated in the 
study; (2) written consent from parents/guardians; and (3) 
age-appropriate Mongolian literacy. Exclusion criteria were 
(1) presence of comorbidities or contraindications prohibit-
ing participation in an exercise programme; and (2) enrol-
ment in a special needs programme. In Mongolia, inclu-
sive education for children with special needs is provided 
in mainstream schools. Children with mild disabilities who 
are diagnosed by doctors are enrolled in the regular pro-
gramme. Those who have severe disabilities are enrolled in 
special schools. However, dropout rate among children with 
disabilities is high due to inadequate school resource [38].

This study was approved by the ethical committee at 
National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, 

Japan (Number 1541) and the Mongolian National Institute 
for Physical Education, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (Number 
238).

Written consent was obtained from the primary guardians 
prior to the original RCT. Researchers encouraged guardians 
to explain the study to their children, but informed assent 
was not obtained from the children.

Measures

Demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors were col-
lected using a self-administered questionnaire distributed to 
the participants’ guardians. Mental health was measured 
using the parental version of the SDQ [39–42].

Socioeconomic factors

The  socioeconomic  factors  included  living  area,  family 
structure, maternal education, and household income. Liv-
ing area was a binary variable: (1) urban area and (2) non-
urban area (i.e., infrastructure is less developed), according 
to the administrative category of the school location. Fam-
ily structure had two categories: (1) two-parent family, and 
(2) one-parent/no-parent family. Maternal education was 
measured as the highest level that the mother achieved and 
converted into a binary variable: (1) low education (lower 
secondary education or less, 9 years and less) and (2) mid-
dle to high education (upper secondary education and more, 
10 years and more). Household income was categorised 
into eight groups and converted into binary variable: (1) 
low income and (2) middle to high income. Low income 
was determined by the threshold of 700,000 Mongolian 
Tugrik (MNT) per month, which was equal to about USD 
280 in 2018, when this study was conducted [37]. Accord-
ing to the Mongolian national statistics, the proportion of 
households whose household income was below 700,000 
MNT was 23.9% in Ulaanbaatar in 2019 and closest to the 
poverty headcount (25.9%) in Ulaanbaatar in 2018 [37, 43].

Lifestyle factors

Lifestyle factors were selected according to 24-h movement 
guidelines from Canada and Australia [16, 17] and sleep, 
physical activity, and screen time were included. Sleep was 
measured by sleep hours and converted into two catego-
ries by the guideline recommendation [16,  17]: (1) short 
sleep (less than nine hours per day), and (2) recommended 
sleep  and  more  (nine  hours  per  day  and  more).  Physi-
cal activity was measured by the frequency of children’s 
moderate to vigorous physical activity (physical activity 
that causes the child to sweat and breathe harder) besides 
physical education classes. Frequency of moderate to vigor-
ous physical activity was grouped into five categories and 

1 3794 

Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2022) 57:791–803

converted to two categories: (1) not engaging in physical 
activity (less than once per week), and (2) engaging in physi-
cal activity (once or more per week). The reason for measur-
ing the frequency of moderate to vigorous physical activity 
per week to indicate exercise habit was based on the general 
trend of Mongolian children being physically inactive due 
to urbanisation, air pollution, and severe winter coldness. 
Global School-based Student Health Survey in 2013 dem-
onstrated that 25.2% of school children were engaged in the 
recommended level of physical activity, which was one hour 
of moderate physical activity per day [36, 44].

Screen time was grouped into five categories and con-
verted to two categories according to the guideline recom-
mendation [16, 17]: (1) recommended screen time (less than 
2 h per day), and (2) long screen time (2 h and more per 
day).

Mental health

The SDQ has been widely used in international studies to 
screen a range of behavioural problems among children and 
adolescents aged 4–17 years. The SDQ consists of 25 sim-
ple questions on strengths and difficulties across four dif-
ficulty subscales: (1) emotion, (2) conduct, (3) hyperactiv-
ity, and (4) peer problems, as well as one strength subscale. 
Summing the four difficulty subscale scores yields the total 
difficulties score; summing emotion and peer problems sub-
scales yields the internalising score; and summing conduct 
and hyperactivity subscales yields the externalising score 
[45]. Using these scores, the levels of risk were categorised 
as abnormal, borderline, and normal by the normative band-
ing that categorizes children with the highest 10% score 
range as abnormal and the second highest 10% as borderline 
following the original method [41]. The SDQ has already 
been validated in Mongolia by a previous study that com-
pared a community population (the same study population 
as this study) and a clinical population comprising patients 
at a child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient service at the 
National Mental Health Center [42]. In this study, mental 
health problems were assessed using the SDQ total difficul-
ties score, internalising score, and externalising score. This 
study adopted a total difficulties cut-off score for borderline, 
which was recommended for the screening of community 
children in the previous study [42]. The cut-off scores for 
internalising and externalising behaviours were determined 
by the same level of normative banding—categorising par-
ticipants above the 80th percentile as high risk. Using these 
cut-off scores, the total difficulties score, internalising score, 
and externalising score were converted into a binary vari-
able: (1) high risk (total difficulties score of 17 or higher, 
internalising/externalising score above 80th percentile); and 
(2) low risk (total difficulties score of 16 or lower, inter-
nalising/externalising score below 80th percentile). Each 

subscale was not used due to their poor fit to the five-factor 
model in the Mongolian context [42].

Statistical analysis

Descriptive analysis

The participants’ socioeconomic variables were descrip-
tively analysed and compared between participants with and 
without missing values among the explanatory variables and 
the SDQ, to address any selection bias. For age, a t test was 
performed. For variables other than age, a chi-squared test 
was performed. Among participants without missing values, 
explanatory variables were compared between high-risk and 
low-risk participants. All the explanatory variables were cat-
egorical variables, and a chi-squared test was performed.

The SDQ total difficulties score, internalising score, and 

externalising scores were descriptively analysed.

Normative banding of internalising and externalising 
scores

Normative distribution tables for the internalising and exter-
nalising score were created. The cut-off scores were set 
around the 80th percentile level so that the highest 20% was 
categorised as high-risk, which is equivalent to the cut-off 
of the total difficulties score in Mongolia.

Logistic regression analysis

The explanatory variables included in the logistic regres-
sion analysis comprised gender, living area, family struc-
ture, maternal education, household income, sleep, physi-
cal activity, and screen time. Reference categories were 
as follows: gender: female; living area: urban area; family 
structure: two-parent family; maternal education: middle to 
high education; household income: middle to high income; 
sleep: recommended sleep; physical activity: engaging in 
physical activity; and screen time: recommended screen 
time. As the participants were students of the same year in 
elementary school and because their age was considered to 
be virtually the same, age was not included as an explana-
tory  variable.  The  dependent  variable  was  high-risk  of 
mental health problems based on the total difficulties score, 
internalising score, and externalising score. All the explana-
tory variables were hypothesised to be associated with the 
dependent variable. Thus, a forced entry method was used. 
Multicollinearity was examined by variance inflation factor.
First,  the  association  between  mental  health  prob-
lems  and  each  explanatory  variable  was  analysed  using 
a univariate logistic regression analysis, after which the 
crude odds ratio was calculated. Second, the association 
between mental health problems and all the explanatory 

1 3Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2022) 57:791–803 

795

variables was analysed using a multivariate logistic regres-
sion analysis, after which the adjusted odds ratio was calcu-
lated. Statistical significance threshold was set at p = 0.05.

Missing  values  were  not  complemented.  Participants 
without missing values in all the explanatory and depend-
ent variables were included in the analysis.

All analyses were conducted using R software, version 

3.6.

Results

Participants

A total of 2309 children were enrolled in the 10 schools 
participating  in  the  original  RCT  study.  Of  these,  2301 
children provided consent to participate. None of them met 
the exclusion criteria. Of the 2301 children, 1694 children 
(82.8%) did not have any missing values among the SDQ 
and explanatory variables, hence were included in the logis-
tic regression analysis. One hundred and fifty-one (10.9%) 

participants did not answer any item of the self-administered 
questionnaire or SDQ.

Description of participants

The mean age of the participants was 9.7 (SD: 0.4), and 
1,051 (51.3%) participants were male. Other socioeconomic 
variables are presented in Table 1.

Comparison of participants 
with and without missing values

Age and gender did not differ between 1694 participants 
without missing values (73.6%, analysed participants) and 
607 participants with missing values (26.4%, not analysed 
participants). Socioeconomic variables, such as living area, 
family structure, maternal education, and household income, 
differed between the two groups. The group with missing 
values had a larger proportion of individuals with low socio-
economic status (Table 1). Thus, a greater number of partici-
pants from low socioeconomic groups were excluded from 
the analysis.

The mean total difficulties score on the SDQ was 12.9 
(SD: 4.9) among participants without missing values and 
13.3 (SD: 4.8) among participants with missing values, 
although there was no statistically significant difference.

Results of the SDQ

Among all participants, the mean total difficulties score was 
12.9 (SD: 4.8). The mean internalising score was 6.7 (SD: 
2.9), and the mean externalising score was 6.2 (SD: 3.2).

Using normative distribution and its 80th-percentile level, 
a cut-off score of 10 was set for the internalising score 9 
for externalising score. Based on these cut-off scores, of 
the 2046 participants who answered the SDQ, 349 (17.1%) 
participants were classified as high risk for internalising, 
and 461 (22.5%) participants were classified as high risk for 
externalising. Normative distribution is presented as Sup-
plementary Table 1.

Of the 440 children who had an SDQ total difficulties 
score above the high-risk cut-off score, 245 (55.7%) were 
classified as high risk for internalising problems and 308 
(70.0%) for externalising problems. The distribution of each 
score is presented in Fig. 1.

Multicollinearity

The variant inflation factor was < 10 between all the explana-
tory variables. The highest was 1.11 between living area and 
household income.

Logistic regression analysis

Total difficulties score

A univariate logistic regression analysis and a multivari-
ate  logistic  regression  analysis  were  performed,  using 

total difficulties score as an indicator of the presence of a 
mental health problem (Table 2). The crude odds ratio for 
male gender was 1.59 (95%CI 1.26–2.02), 1.39 for non-
urban (95%CI 1.10–1.77), 2.07 for low maternal education 
(95%CI 1.3–3.22), 1.56 for low household income (95%CI 
1.23–1.99), 1.37 for short sleep (95%CI 1.08–1.74), 1.32 for 
not engaging in physical activity (95%CI 1.05–1.67), and 
1.57 for long screen time (95%CI 1.24–1.99); these were 
statistically significant in the univariate analysis. Among 
these  estimates,  male  gender,  low  maternal  education, 
short  sleep,  not  engaging  in  physical  activity,  and  long 
screen time remained significant in the multivariate logis-
tic regression analysis. The adjusted odds ratio for male 
gender was 1.64 (95%CI 1.29–2.10), 1.89 for low maternal 
education (95%CI 1.16–3.05), 1.41 for short sleep (95%CI 
1.10–1.80),  1.31  for  not  engaging  in  physical  activity 
(95%CI 1.03–1.67), and 1.53 for long screen time (95%CI 
1.20–1.94).

Internalising score

A univariate logistic regression analysis and a multivariate 
logistic regression analysis were performed using inter-
nalising score as an indicator of the presence of a mental 
health  problem  (Table  3).  The  crude  odds  ratio  for  low 
maternal education was 2.29 (95%CI 1.40–3.65), 1.91 for 
low household income  (95%CI 1.46–2.49), 1.44 for not 
engaging in physical activity (95%CI 1.11–1.87), and 1.33 
for long screen time (95%CI 1.03–1.73), all of which were 
statistically significant in the univariate and multivariate 
analyses. The adjusted odds ratio for low maternal educa-
tion was 1.82 (95%CI 1.09–2.98), 1.72 for low household 
income (95%CI 1.27–2.31), 1.34 for not engaging in physi-
cal activity (95%CI 1.03–1.75), and 1.37 for long screen 
time (95%CI 1.05–1.79).

Externalising score

A univariate logistic regression analysis and a multivariate 
logistic regression analysis were performed using externalis-
ing score as an indicator of the presence of a mental health 
problem  (Table  3).  The  crude  odds  ratios  for  male  gen-
der was 1.78 (95%CI 1.41–2.25), 1.38 for non-urban area 
(95%CI 1.09–1.74), 1.9 for low maternal education (95%CI 
1.19–2.95),  1.41  for  low  household  income  (95%CI 
1.11–1.79), 1.71 for long screen time (95%CI 1.36–2.15), 
all of which were statistically significant in the univariate 
analysis. Among these, male gender, low maternal education, 
and long screen time remained significant in the multivariate 
logistic regression analysis. The adjusted odds ratio for male 
gender was 1.79 (95%CI 1.41–2.27), 1.78 for low maternal 
education (95%CI 1.09–2.86), and 1.65 for long screen time 
(95%CI 1.30–2.08).

Discussion

Summary of the results

Among Mongolian elementary school children, male gen-
der, low maternal education, short sleep, not engaging in 
physical activity, and long screen time were significant risk 
factors for general mental health problems. For internalising 
problems, low maternal education, low household income, not 
engaging in physical activity, long screen time were signifi-
cant, whereas male gender, low maternal education, and long 
screen time were significant for externalising problems.

Comparison of the results of general 
mental health problems with previous 
studies and extrapolability of the results

Gender

The results showed that males are at a higher risk for general 
mental health problems and externalising problems but not 
for internalising problems. This coincides with the fact that 
the prevalence of some childhood mental disorders is higher 
among males [46–48].

Socioeconomic factors

Lower maternal education was strongly associated with gen-
eral mental health problems. Other socioeconomic factors 
were not consistently associated with mental health prob-
lems at a statistically significant level, but the adjusted odds 
ratios for all factors were around 1 and higher. With larger 
sample size, other socioeconomic factors might also dem-
onstrate significant association with general mental health 
problems. This corresponds to previous results about the 
association between low socioeconomic status and mental 
health in high-income countries [5]. It has been known that 
maternal education is an important social determinant of 
children’s health, particularly in LMICs [49]. A previous 
study in Mongolia also reported an association between sub-
scales of the SDQ and lower maternal education [22].

Lifestyle factors

This study demonstrated the general association between 
short sleep, not engaging in physical activity, long screen 
time and general mental health problems. Although the evi-
dence is stronger for the association between these lifestyle 
factors and specific mental health symptoms such as depres-
sion and anxiety [8–10, 13], some previous studies demon-
strated an association between lifestyle factors and general 
mental health problem [50–52]. This study suggested that 
multiple lifestyle factors contributed to poorer mental health, 
which imply that the needs of fostering healthy lifestyle 
among children are applicable to greater population.

Comparison of the results of internalising problems 
and externalising problems with previous studies

Internalising  problems  refer  to  depressive  or  anxiety 
symptoms and externalising problems refer to hyperac-
tive, inattention or conduct symptoms. The association 
between physical inactivity, long screen time and inter-
nalising problems is consistent with the previous studies 
mainly conducted in high-income countries [8–10]. Our 
results demonstrated the association between long screen 

time and externalising problems which is consistent with 
emerging evidence on the association between long screen 
time and inattention problems [11, 12]. Gender, house-
hold income and physical activity demonstrated different 
impact on internalising and externalising problems. Gen-
der reflects epidemiological difference between boys and 
girls. The prevalence of some childhood mental disorders 
which frequently exhibit externalising problems—such as 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and conduct dis-
order—is higher among males [46, 47]. Low household 
income demonstrated significantly higher odds of internal-
ising problems and non-significant higher odds of exter-
nalising problems. However, as the lower limit of 95% 
confidential interval was close to 1 for externalising prob-
lems, the difference might disappear when it is examined 
with larger sample size. Not engaging in physical activity 
posed higher odds only for internalising problems. This is 
consistent with the existing evidence that physical inactiv-
ity is a risk factor for depressive or anxiety symptoms, thus 
this might be a true difference between internalising and 
externalising problems.

Implications for practice

Our  results  indicate  that  children’s  lifestyle  needs  more 
attention in LMICs. As WHO recommends [15], our results 
suggests that national plans to promote healthy lifestyle 
among children is beneficial for children’s mental health in 
LMICs.

In LMICs, where resources are limited, a universal inter-
vention utilising existing resources is more feasible than 
targeted intervention employing new resources. Regarding 
lifestyle factors, there have been many studies investigated 
the effects of school-based and home-based intervention on 
physical activity and screen time in HICs [53, 54]. As physi-
cal activity, screen time and sleep are interrelated, interven-
tions often targeted multiple factors [54, 55]. School might 
be a most feasible place to deliver intervention to children 
in LMICs but children are under strong influence of par-
ents [53, 54]. Thus, interventions combining school-based 
activities and education and support to parents are consid-
ered to be effective [55]. For example, school-based physical 
activity intervention (e.g. increasing the number of physical 
education classes, improving the quality of physical educa-
tion classes) and health education at school is a possible 
intervention in LMICs.

Regarding socioeconomic factors, strengthening social 
welfare services for disadvantaged population and child 
maltreatment is recommended [56]. Allocating appropri-
ate resources in this area in LMICs is an essential policy 
response. Delivering public education about child care are 
possible universal interventions in LMICs.

Limitations

Conclusion

This  study  has  some  limitations.  First,  this  study 
could only demonstrate the association of some socio-
economic and lifestyle factors with mental health. The 
cross-sectional  design  of  this  study  precludes  causal 
inferences. Second, as this study is a secondary analysis, 
this dataset was not optimized for the analysis of men-
tal health risk factors. Therefore, some well-known risk 
factors such as maltreatment or abuse, parental mental 
health problems and perinatal complications were not 
adjusted [18]. Regarding basic socioeconomic factors, 
this study did not investigate the association of ethnic-
ity, food security or community factors such as commu-
nity deprivation and community safety [56]. Regarding 
lifestyle factors, this study did not investigate sedentary 
time or diet [10, 57].Third, this study excluded 607 par-
ticipants with missing values for explanatory variables 
or the SDQ from the logistic regression analysis. The dif-
ference in socioeconomic background between partici-
pants without missing values and those with missing val-
ues may have caused a sampling bias. As more children 
from low socioeconomic groups were excluded from the 
analysis due to missing values, the association between 
socioeconomic  variables  and  mental  health  problems 
might be underestimated. To address this issue, future 
studies should collect data through interviews to minimise 
the possibility of missing values, thereby reducing sam-
pling bias.

Fourth, this study may have been affected by seasonal 
factors. The data were collected during the winter season, 
and it is possible that the season may also have affected 
participants’  lifestyle.  A  severe  winter  might  lead  to 
further lifestyle changes, limiting physical activity and 
increasing screen time.

Lastly, this study was conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mon-
golia’s capital city. Children living in rural areas where 
more people are living as nomad were not included in this 
study. As the lifestyle of children living in the capital city 
and those in rural areas differ, lifestyle risk factors for 
rural children might also be different. For example, rural 
or nomadic children may exhibit higher levels of physi-
cal activity and spend less time on digital devices than 
do children in Ulaanbaatar, resulting in different risk lev-
els for these factors. However, the results of the lifestyle 
factors might be applicable to children living in urban 
areas  of  LMICs,  as  less  physical  activity  and  longer 
screen time are common among children living in urban 
areas in LMICs. Thus, the findings of this study may be 
used as a basis to develop and implement health policies 
for improving the mental health of children and adoles-
cents in Mongolia and similar countries.

Low socioeconomic status, especially low maternal edu-
cation and short sleep, lack of physical activity, and long 
screen time were identified as factors associated with men-
tal health problems among school-aged children in Mon-
golia. The results contribute to social implementation of 
preventive interventions in LMICs.
