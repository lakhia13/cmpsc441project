Abstract

Background: Research suggests four modal trajectories of psychological symptoms after 
traumatic injury: Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery. However, most studies focus on 
symptoms of psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, depression), which are 
limited by heterogeneity and symptom overlap. We examined trajectories of cross-cutting 
posttraumatic symptom dimensions following traumatic injury and predictors of trajectory 
membership.

Methods: In this longitudinal study of 427 predominantly Hispanic/Latino traumatic injury 
survivors, posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and 
approximately one and five months post-trauma. Using latent class growth analysis, we estimated 
trajectories of several posttraumatic symptom dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious 
arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat. We then examined sociodemographic and 
trauma-related characteristics (measured during hospitalization) as predictors of trajectory 
membership for each dimension.

Results: Four trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, Recovery) emerged for all 
dimensions except loss and threat, which manifested three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, 
Delayed Onset). Across dimensions, membership in the Chronic (vs. Resilient) trajectory was 
consistently predicted by unemployment (7 of 7 dimensions), followed by older age (3/7), female 
sex (3/7), and assaultive trauma (2/7). For several dimensions, unemployment also distinguished

between participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma, but then 
diverged over time.

Limitations: Measures of posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs differed across 
assessments.

Conclusions: This study provides evidence of distinct trajectories across transdiagnostic 
symptom dimensions after traumatic injury. Employment status emerged as the most important 
predictor of trajectory membership. Research is needed to better understand the etiologies and 
consequences of these posttraumatic symptom dimension trajectories.

Introduction

Each year in the United States, approximately 30 million individuals present to emergency 
departments for traumatic injuries resulting from incidents including motor vehicle 
accidents, assaults, and gunshot wounds, with nearly 3 million hospitalized (Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). For these patients, the ramifications of traumatic 
injury rarely end once the physical wounds heal. Psychological distress is common after 
these experiences, and it manifests in various ways that often persist long after the injury 
(deRoon-Cassini et al., 2019). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the quintessential 
trauma-related mental disorder; other common adverse psychological responses to traumatic 
injury include depression and anxiety (deRoon-Cassini et al., 2019; deRoon-Cassini et al., 
2010; Shih et al., 2010; Zatzick et al., 2007). The emotional sequelae of traumatic injury 
have important consequences for patients’ health and functioning, as persistent 
psychological distress is associated with worse general health, greater disability, and lower 
quality of life (deRoon-Cassini et al., 2019; Haagsma et al., 2012; Holbrook et al., 1998; 
O’Donnell et al., 2005).

Given the significant mental health impact of traumatic injury and its consequences for long-
term functioning, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (2018) has 
recommended mental health risk screening among injury survivors. The task of assessing 
psychopathology risk after trauma is complicated by the substantial variability in who 
develops posttraumatic psychopathology and how it manifests over time. A large body of 
work has identified distinct trajectories of emotional distress after trauma, including 
traumatic injury. Although most individuals are resilient after trauma and experience 
minimal impact on their emotional health, others exhibit chronic elevations in symptoms of 
PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety, gradual recovery of symptoms, or delayed onset of 
symptoms (Bonanno et al., 2012; Bryant et al., 2015; deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; Galatzer-
Levy et al., 2018; Lowe et al., 2020; Osenbach et al., 2014; Ravn et al., 2019). Given the 
heterogeneity in emotional responses to trauma, being able to predict who is likely to 
develop lasting symptoms of psychopathology—especially early after traumatic injury—is 
critical for allocating finite resources in a targeted manner.

To date, research aimed at understanding risk for posttraumatic psychopathology after 
traumatic injury has focused on symptoms of distinct psychiatric diagnostic entities, such as 
PTSD or depression, an approach with limitations. For one, diagnostic categories are 
clinically heterogeneous (Clark et al., 1995; Hyman, 2010). A PTSD diagnosis, for example, 
can reflect 636,120 symptom combinations (Galatzer-Levy & Bryant, 2013). Different 
symptom presentations may result from distinct biological processes, but these various 
mechanisms are not considered when all manifestations are included under a single 
diagnostic umbrella (Casey et al., 2013). Furthermore, many posttraumatic psychiatric 
diagnoses have overlapping symptoms; for example, loss of interest and sleep disturbance 
are symptoms of PTSD and depression. Comorbid diagnoses are thus the norm rather than 
the exception (Breslau, 2009; deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; Kessler et al., 1995), calling into 
question the validity of distinct diagnostic entities (Clark et al., 1995; Hyman, 2010). This 
conundrum has prompted many researchers to advocate for dimensional approaches to 
defining psychopathology (Casey et al., 2013; Clark et al., 1995; Cuthbert & Insel, 2013).

Growing research in posttraumatic psychopathology suggests that discrete and more 
homogeneous dimensions, which align more closely with underlying biological 
mechanisms, underlie several traditional psychiatric diagnoses (Armour et al., 2016; Casey 
et al., 2013; Forbes et al., 2010; McLean et al., 2019). Focusing on these transdiagnostic 
dimensions is consistent with the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research 
Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework for studying dimensions of functioning that cut across 
mental disorder diagnoses and can be linked to disrupted neurobiological processes 
(Cuthbert, 2014; Cuthbert & Insel, 2013). Examining the latent structure of PTSD, symptom 
dimensions of re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, anxious arousal, and dysphoric arousal 
have been identified after trauma (Armour et al., 2016; Elhai et al., 2011). This five-factor 
dysphoric arousal model emerged as the best-fitting model in a review of over 100 studies 
examining the underlying structure of PTSD (Armour et al., 2016). Dimensions of loss (e.g., 
dysphoria) and threat (e.g., anxiety) have also been proposed in RDoC as key dimensions of 
psychopathology, and they are relevant to manifestations of posttraumatic psychopathology, 
including symptoms of depressive and anxiety disorders (Cuthbert & Insel, 2013).

Examining underlying symptom dimensions circumvents issues of symptom overlap 
between psychiatric diagnoses. Furthermore, these dimensions have unique correlates in 
trauma-exposed individuals. Numbing, for example, has been uniquely linked to problematic 
substance use and poor mental health (Sumner et al., 2014; Tsai et al., 2015), and dysphoric 
arousal to interpersonal conflict (Sumner et al., 2014). However, as trajectory analyses in 
traumatic injury patients have only focused on symptoms of psychiatric diagnoses, research 
has yet to consider predictors of trajectories across different symptom dimensions. Given the 
more homogeneous nature of posttraumatic symptom dimensions and their potentially 
distinct etiologies and consequences, predicting trajectories of these different dimensions 
may yield important insights for the pathophysiology and treatment of posttraumatic 
distress.

In this investigation, we harnessed data from a predominantly male, Hispanic/Latino sample 
of traumatic injury survivors presenting to a Level 1 trauma center. The longitudinal design 
of the parent study examining salivary biomarkers of posttraumatic psychopathology

allowed us to examine how trajectories of underlying dimensions of posttraumatic 
psychopathology manifested after traumatic injury. Using information on posttraumatic 
psychopathology symptoms assessed during hospitalization and approximately one and five 
months after injury, we investigated trajectories of the following cross-cutting symptom 
dimensions: re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric arousal, anxious arousal, loss, 
and threat. Based on research on emotional distress trajectories after traumatic injury, we 
hypothesized that we would identify resilient, chronic, delayed onset, and recovery 
trajectories (Bonanno & Mancini, 2012; Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018). Examining trajectories 
of these posttraumatic symptom dimensions in a predominantly Hispanic/Latino sample is 
particularly notable given some evidence of ethnic disparities in manifestations of 
posttraumatic psychopathology, with Hispanic/Latino individuals reporting distinctive 
patterns of greater distress (Galea et al., 2004; Marshall et al., 2009).

As our second aim, we examined predictors of trajectories of underlying dimensions of 
posttraumatic psychopathology. We considered several sociodemographic and trauma-
related characteristics that have been associated with trajectories based on symptoms of 
psychiatric disorders, including female sex, minority race/ethnicity, indicators of low 
socioeconomic status, and assaultive trauma (Brewin et al., 2000; Bryant et al., 2015; Lowe 
et al., 2020). In addition to comparing the resilient and chronic trajectories, we focused on 
patients who appeared similar in terms of their initial distress but then diverged over time 
(e.g., Lowe et al., 2020). Specifically, we sought to identify factors that distinguished the 
chronic and recovery trajectories, and the delayed onset and resilient trajectories.

Methods

Participants and Procedure

Participants were English or Spanish-speaking adult trauma patients treated between January 
2014 and June 2018 at the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical 
Center (LAC-USC), an urban Level 1 trauma center. Eligible participants were identified by 
the trauma care team and confirmed by research staff. Written informed consent was 
obtained using procedures approved by LAC-USC’s Institutional Review Board. Participants 
were excluded if they had a grievous injury, required multiple restorative surgeries, and/or 
were medically unstable; had facial injuries or oral lacerations that could contaminate saliva 
with blood (saliva samples were collected concurrently); evidenced cognitive impairments or 
psychiatric problems; were in police custody or institutionalized; or were unwilling to return 
for follow-ups.

The main aim of the parent study was to identify salivary biomarker predictors of 
posttraumatic psychopathology after traumatic injury. Given a pragmatic study design that 
mapped onto the dynamic trauma care setting and a largely vulnerable patient population, 
the study employed readily assessable measures of risk factors. Assessments were conducted 
during hospitalization [median: 2 days post-admission, interquartile range (IQR):1–3 days; 
T0] and approximately one month (median: 38 days, IQR:32–53 days; T1) and five months 
(median: 143 days, IQR:127–203 days; T2) after injury. T0 was completed in-hospital, and 
participants returned to LAC-USC for T1 and T2. Questionnaires were administered by 
trained and calibrated staff at T0 and T1 to assess posttraumatic psychopathology symptoms,

and diagnostic interviews were administered at T2 to measure symptoms and diagnoses of 
posttraumatic psychopathology. Sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics were 
queried at T0. Of the 695 participants who completed T0, 386 (56%) completed T1, 368 
(53%) completed T2, and 327 (47%) completed all assessments. The analytic sample 
comprised 427 participants who completed at least 2 assessments (61%).

Measures

Posttraumatic Symptom Dimensions.—Several measures were collected at the three 
assessments. At T0 and T1, staff administered the PTSD Checklist, Specific (PCL-S) version 
(Weathers et al., 1993) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) depression and anxiety subscales 
(Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983). The PCL-S assesses the 17 DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for 
PTSD; participants indicated the extent to which they were bothered by these symptoms in 
response to the trauma resulting in hospitalization. The PCL is a reliable and valid measure 
of PTSD symptoms, with good correspondence with the Clinician-Administered PTSD 
Scale (CAPS) diagnostic interview (Blanchard et al., 1996; Ruggiero et al., 2003). The BSI 
depression and anxiety subscales each comprise six symptoms; participants rated the extent 
to which they were bothered by symptoms. These BSI subscales have been shown to have 
good psychometric properties (Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1983). At T0 and T1, the PCL-S 
and BSI measures queried symptoms since the traumatic injury and in the past week, 
respectively. At T2, staff administered the CAPS (Blake et al., 1995) and Inventory of 
Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-30) (Rush et al., 1986; Rush et al., 1996). The CAPS is 
the gold-standard diagnostic interview for PTSD, with excellent psychometric properties 
(Weathers et al., 2001). The CAPS assesses the 17 DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD. 
Participants indicated the extent to which they were bothered by symptoms in the past month 
with respect to the index trauma. The IDS-30 assesses the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a 
major depressive episode, along with some anxiety symptoms; participants reported on 
symptoms in the past two weeks. This measure has been found to have good reliability and 
validity (Rush et al., 1996; Trivedi et al., 2004).

Using items from these measures, we defined several posttraumatic symptom dimensions. 
As in some prior studies of trajectories of emotional distress after trauma (e.g., deRoon-
Cassini et al., 2010; Meli et al., 2020; Nash et al., 2014), the same measures were not 
administered at all assessments due to the parent study design. However, when different 
measures were used across assessments, they captured the same construct that constituted a 
symptom dimension with the same number of items. This consistent coverage of constructs 
thereby facilitated trajectory analyses. Accordingly, we used corresponding items from 
measures at T0, T1, and T2 to estimate trajectories of the following symptom dimensions: 
re-experiencing, avoidance, anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat 
(see Table 1 for item mappings). At each assessment, symptom dimension scores were 
calculated by summing the relevant item responses. To harmonize each dimension score 
across assessments, a constant was subtracted at T0 and T1 to anchor the score at 0 without 
affecting the difference between the maximum and minimum score. The loss and threat 
dimension scores at T2 were rescaled in range to match the respective scores at T0 and T1, 
with resulting non-integer values rounded to the nearest integer (Table 1).

Predictors of Trajectory Membership.—Sociodemographic and trauma-related 
characteristics were collected as part of the parent study and examined as predictors of 
trajectory membership. At T0, age, sex, race, ethnicity, relationship status, educational 
attainment, and employment status were queried. Race and ethnicity data were categorized 
as Hispanic/Latino, White, Black, and multiracial/other, and, given small numbers of 
participants in the non-Hispanic/Latino categories, dichotomized as Hispanic/Latino 
(yes/no) for analyses. Relationship status was coded dichotomously, indicating whether a 
participant was married or lived with a partner. Educational attainment was categorized as 
“less than high school,” “high school,” or “greater than high school.” Employment status 
was classified as “full,” “part-time,” “none/unemployed,” or “disabled/other.” The index 
trauma resulting in injury was classified as assaultive (e.g., gunshot wound, assault) versus 
non-assaultive (e.g., motor vehicle accident, fall).

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics for sociodemographic and trauma-related characteristics were compiled 
for the analytic sample and for those excluded due to only completing T0. Group differences 
were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for age and χ2 tests for categorical variables.

Latent Class Growth Analysis.—We conducted latent class growth analyses (LCGA) to 
identify discrete patterns of change from T0 to T2 within each symptom dimension. The 
criteria of the GRoLTS-Checklist (Van De Schoot et al., 2017) were applied when reporting 
analyses and results. LCGA accounts for heterogeneity in individual patterns of change by 
clustering participants into unobserved classes or trajectories underlying the sample. A 
preliminary investigation of dimension scores revealed that participants frequently exhibited 
nonlinear trajectories. We, therefore, employed a latent basis growth model in which the 
optimal shape of the change trajectory is estimated from the data (Grimm et al., 2016). 
Compared to a linear growth model, the latent basis model required estimation of one 
additional free parameter per class (the shape growth factor loading at T1; Supplementary 
Figure 1). Thus, the model afforded the flexibility to identify any type of change trajectory 
(linear or nonlinear) even with three measurement occasions while remaining parsimonious. 
Since observed dimension scores were highly left-skewed, we assumed a negative binomial 
distribution to avoid overextraction of classes (Bauer & Curran, 2003). Unobserved classes 
were allowed to differ in initial symptom severity (mean of the intercept growth factor), as 
well as in the magnitude (mean of the shape growth factor) and pattern of change. Residual 
variance not explained by class membership was assumed to be constant across time and 
latent classes. In exploratory analyses, we relaxed this restrictive assumption by estimating 
residual variances that were either a) class-specific and fixed across time or b) time-specific 
and fixed across classes. Under both scenarios of a less constrained error structure, model 
estimation problems arose. We explored relaxing the assumption of homogeneous individual 
trajectories within each class, but encountered model convergence issues.

To determine the most likely number of trajectories for each symptom dimension, we 
estimated a series of models for which the number of latent classes varied from one to five. 
The most plausible model was selected by evaluating several fit statistics and substantive 
criteria [e.g., the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), approximate likelihood ratio tests

(LRTs), entropy (a measure of classification confidence ranging from 0–1)], in addition to 
considering theory, parsimony, and interpretability (Andruff et al., 2009; Jung & Wickrama, 
2008; Lo et al., 2001). We also required that classes comprise at least 5% of the sample. 
Estimated mean trajectories were plotted for each candidate model (Supplementary Figure 
2) and assessed for distinctiveness and interpretability. All LCGA models were estimated 
using Mplus 8.4 (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2017) with 2,000 initial-stage random starts, 20 
initial-stage iterations, and 20 final-stage optimizations for models with two or more classes. 
Although all participants provided data at T0, missing data at T1 and T2 were 
accommodated by using full information maximum likelihood estimation under the 
assumption that the data were missing at random.

Predictive Analysis.—Latent class membership was regressed on sociodemographic and 
trauma-related characteristics in a multinomial logistic regression analysis following the 
three-step method proposed by Vermunt (2010). In the LCGA, participants were modally 
assigned to a class based on the estimated probabilities of class membership. In the 
regression analysis, class membership was a nominal indicator of the latent class variable, 
and the measurement relationships between the latent class variable and the indicator 
variable were set to the logits of the classification probabilities obtained during LCGA 
estimation (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2014). The analysis was carried out with two alternative 
parameterizations depending on the comparison of interest, using either the resilient or 
recovery trajectory as the reference.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Table 2 presents characteristics of the analytic sample. Participants were mostly young, 
single, male, and Hispanic/Latino. Consistent with the LAC-USC catchment area, many 
participants were socioeconomically disadvantaged. Approximately one-third of the sample 
presented with an assaultive injury. Compared to participants who only completed the 
baseline assessment, participants in the analytic sample were more likely to be Hispanic/
Latino (76.1% vs. 64.6%, p=.001) and reported higher educational attainment (<HS/HS/
>HS: 26.5/32.1/41.5% vs. 34.0/34.7/31.3%, p=.019; Supplementary Table 1).

Trajectories of Posttraumatic Symptom Dimensions

Descriptive statistics for the posttraumatic symptom dimensions are shown in 
Supplementary Table 2. Statistical information for all candidate LCGA models for the 
different dimensions is provided in Table 3. There was considerable consistency in the 
LCGA results across symptom dimensions. Specifically, a four-class solution was selected 
as the best-fitting model for all dimensions except loss and threat, where a three-class 
solution was selected. For the re-experiencing, anxious arousal, and avoidance dimensions, 
consistent improvements in BIC and significant LRTs until the five-class model was 
specified suggested a four-class solution. In the case of dysphoric arousal, the BIC was 
lowest and nearly identical for the four- and five-class models, but the LRTs, which were no 
longer significant in the five-class model, supported the four-class solution. For numbing, 
the BIC reached its minimum with four classes, but the LRTs failed to reach significance for

models with more than three classes. After examining the estimated mean trajectories for the 
three-class and four-class models for numbing (Supplementary Figure 2), we selected the 
four-class model because the resulting four trajectories were qualitatively distinct and 
theoretically meaningful. For loss, the BIC was lowest for the three-class model, but the 
LRTs retained significance with up to five classes. Here, we selected the three-class solution 
because the estimated trajectories of the four-class model lacked distinctiveness. Finally, a 
three-class solution for threat was indicated by the BIC, which reached its minimum with 
three classes, and by significant LRTs with up to three classes. We also carried out a 
complete-case LCGA, excluding participants with missing data at T1 or T2. Results closely 
matched those from the analytic sample: the BIC supported a four-class solution for re-
experiencing, anxious arousal, dysphoric arousal, numbing, and avoidance and a three-class 
solution for loss and threat.

Figure 1 displays the estimated mean trajectories based on the selected model for each 
dimension (Supplementary Figure 3 shows mean estimated trajectories together with 
observed individual trajectories; Supplementary Table 3 presents parameter estimates for the 
selected models). For dimensions with a four-class solution, participants were classified into 
Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, and Recovery trajectories; given the similarity with prior 
studies, we adopted the terms for the four modal trajectories of psychological symptoms 
observed after traumatic injury (Figure 1). The Resilient and Chronic trajectories were 
characterized by stably low and elevated symptoms over time, respectively. Elevated 
symptoms at T0 that decreased over time indicated a Recovery trajectory, whereas initially 
low symptoms that subsequently increased constituted the Delayed Onset trajectory. For the 
loss and threat dimensions, participants were classified into Resilient, Chronic, and Delayed 
Onset trajectories. Although a large percentage of participants fell into the Resilient class 
across dimensions (ranging from 17% for dysphoric arousal to 37% for avoidance), this 
class was only the most populous for avoidance. For example, 41% of participants were 
classified into the Delayed Onset trajectory for threat, 34% of participants were classified 
into the Chronic trajectory for numbing, and 33% of participants were each classified into 
the Chronic and Delayed Onset trajectories for dysphoric arousal. To determine how 
consistently participants were clustered into trajectories across the dimensions, we 
conducted a supplementary analysis. For each trajectory, we calculated the intraclass 
correlation [ICC(A,1)] across the latent class posterior probabilities for that trajectory in 
each symptom dimension. For the Resilient and Chronic trajectories, ICCs of 0.46 (95% CI, 
0.42–0.51) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.50–0.59), respectively, indicated moderate classification 
agreement. For the Delayed onset and Recovery trajectories, agreement was low (ICC=0.21, 
95% CI, 0.17–0.25; ICC=0.02, 95% CI, 0.00–0.04, respectively).

Predictors of Trajectory Membership

Predictors of trajectory membership for the posttraumatic symptom dimensions are 
presented in Table 4. We first considered membership in the Chronic versus Resilient 
trajectory to identify factors that could distinguish between consistently elevated and low 
symptoms of emotional distress after injury. For all seven dimensions, unemployment and, 
often, part-time employment were associated with greater odds of being in the Chronic 
trajectory compared to full-time employment, with odds ratios (OR) ranging from 3.17 to

9.44. Older age increased the odds of membership in the Chronic trajectory for avoidance, 
numbing, and loss (OR range:1.03–1.05), whereas female sex was related to greater odds of 
membership in the Chronic trajectory for re-experiencing, anxious arousal, and threat (OR 
range:2.72–4.29). Furthermore, participants who experienced assaultive trauma exhibited 
greater odds of being in the Chronic trajectory for avoidance and anxious arousal (OR 
range:2.55–3.20). Additionally, being married or cohabitating was linked to lower odds of 
membership in the Chronic trajectory for anxious arousal (OR:0.40).

Next, we examined whether we could distinguish between patients who initially appeared 
similar in terms of emotional distress but then diverged over time. Specifically, we 
considered predictors of being in the 1) Chronic versus Recovery trajectory and 2) Delayed 
Onset versus Resilient trajectory. Unemployment was associated with greater odds of being 
in the Chronic (versus Recovery) trajectory compared to full-time employment for three of 
the five dimensions that permitted this comparison: re-experiencing, numbing, and anxious 
arousal (OR range:3.19–5.75). Participants employed part-time (versus full-time) also 
showed greater odds of being in the Chronic trajectory for re-experiencing. For re-
experiencing only, participants with a high school education exhibited lower odds of being 
in the Chronic trajectory compared to those with less than a high school education 
(OR=0.29). Unemployment also predicted membership in the Delayed Onset versus 
Resilient trajectory for re-experiencing and avoidance (OR range=2.90–3.45). Interestingly, 
being married or cohabitating was linked to higher odds of membership in the Delayed 
Onset trajectory for re-experiencing, and having greater than a high school education was 
associated with greater odds of being in the Delayed Onset trajectory for dysphoric arousal.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated significant heterogeneity in psychological responses after 
traumatic injury in a predominantly male, Hispanic/Latino sample and identified distinct 
trajectories of posttraumatic psychopathology. Rather than examining trajectories of 
symptoms of psychiatric diagnoses that are common after trauma (e.g., PTSD, depression) 
as in previous studies, we are the first to investigate trajectories of dimensions of 
posttraumatic psychopathology. By considering trajectories of re-experiencing, avoidance, 
anxious arousal, numbing, dysphoric arousal, loss, and threat symptoms, this study 
examined the diversity in how transdiagnostic symptom dimensions manifest over the first 
five months after traumatic injury. Furthermore, we identified sociodemographic and 
trauma-related predictors of membership in distinct trajectories across different dimensions.

Participants were classified into four trajectories—Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset, and 
Recovery—in five of the seven dimensions. Only in the loss and threat dimensions did we 
observe a best-fitting model with three trajectories (Resilient, Chronic, Delayed Onset). Not 
only did we see consistency in the patterns of trajectories across dimensions, but our 
findings align with other studies of trajectories of psychiatric diagnoses after traumatic 
injury, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which have often supported a similar four-
class model (e.g., deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018; Lowe et al., 
2020). However, unlike many of these studies, we did not find resilience was the modal 
response to traumatic injury. Others have notably questioned whether resilience is always

commonplace after trauma (e.g., Infurna & Luthar, 2018; Steenkamp et al., 2012). Although 
a large percentage of participants fell into the Resilient class across dimensions, this class 
was only the most common for avoidance. For other dimensions, the Chronic (numbing, 
anxious arousal) and Delayed Onset (loss, threat) classes comprised the most participants; 
for dysphoric arousal, the Chronic and Delayed onset classes were both the largest. Only for 
re-experiencing was the Recovery trajectory the largest class. Additional research is needed 
to confirm whether trajectories with more dispersed membership are obtained when focusing 
on symptom dimensions, rather than diagnoses, after traumatic injury.

Whereas most studies have focused on trajectories of separate diagnoses such as PTSD or 
depression, we examined symptom dimensions that cut across traditional diagnostic 
categories. Focusing on cross-cutting symptom dimensions avoids issues of diagnostic 
comorbidity (Clark et al., 1995; Hyman, 2010), aligns with the NIMH RDoC framework for 
mental disorders (Cuthbert, 2014; Cuthbert & Insel, 2013), and these more homogeneous 
dimensions may be more closely tied to underlying biology (Casey et al., 2013; McLean et 
al., 2019). Even though a similar pattern of trajectories was observed across the symptom 
dimensions, we found that proportions of individuals in the trajectories varied for the 
dimensions; this could potentially reflect differences in their mechanisms (e.g., biological 
underpinnings) and risk and protective factors. Future research is needed to directly address 
these questions. Furthermore, the cross-dimension comparison results for a given trajectory 
demonstrated that participants did not cluster consistently across the different symptom 
dimensions; this was particularly the case for the Delayed Onset and Recovery trajectories 
and somewhat less so for the Chronic and Resilient trajectories. If individuals fell in the 
Delayed Onset trajectory for re-experiencing, they did not necessarily fall in that trajectory 
for the other dimensions. An important extension of the current study is to examine how 
symptom dimension trajectories cluster within individuals and identify predictors of these 
patterns.

In predictive models of trajectory membership, employment status at the time of traumatic 
injury emerged as an important candidate to include in risk prediction models for developing 
chronic manifestations of posttraumatic symptom dimensions, followed by sex, age, 
assaultive trauma, education, and relationship status. The Chronic versus Resilient trajectory 
comparison could help identify participant characteristics associated with long-lasting 
symptoms of posttraumatic psychopathology that could be used in screening and prevention 
efforts in the acute aftermath of trauma. Whereas employment status consistently predicted 
Chronic versus Resilient trajectory membership across different dimensions, other predictors 
(e.g., sex, age, assaultive trauma) emerged only for certain dimensions. The directions of 
these associations were consistent with previous studies of diagnostic trajectories after 
traumatic injury (Bryant et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2020). Female sex, for example, was 
linked to an increased likelihood of being in the Chronic trajectory for re-experiencing, 
anxious arousal, and threat. Re-experiencing and anxious arousal have been considered to be 
threat-related symptom dimensions of PTSD (Forbes et al., 2010), and thus these findings 
may suggest that female sex could be particularly linked to a more chronic manifestation of 
threat-related symptoms after traumatic injury. Unemployment also emerged as a way to 
distinguish participants who presented with similar symptom levels days after trauma but 
then diverged over time, namely individuals who were 1) initially high on re-experiencing,

numbing, and anxious arousal symptoms and then stayed high (Chronic trajectory) as 
opposed to recovered (Recovery trajectory) and 2) initially low on re-experiencing and 
avoidance symptoms and then exhibited an increase in symptoms (Delayed onset trajectory) 
as opposed to stayed low (Resilient trajectory). Thus, our findings suggest that employment 
status may be useful for identifying individuals who may require more long-term attention 
and care after traumatic injury. The consistency in our findings linking unemployment status 
to more long-term manifestations of multiple posttraumatic symptom dimensions is notable. 
Several trajectory studies have identified that socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., low 
educational attainment) is associated with more chronic symptoms of posttraumatic 
psychopathology after traumatic injury (e.g., deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; Lowe et al., 
2020). Unemployment could signal a lack of access to resources that could aid in recovery 
after trauma (e.g., healthcare, stable living situation, support network at work). Furthermore, 
unemployment could reflect other pre-trauma risk factors such as preexisting 
psychopathology, which has been linked to emotional distress after trauma (e.g., Ozer et al., 
2003). Additional research is needed to better understand the mechanisms linking 
employment status with more chronic manifestations of posttraumatic symptom dimensions. 
Further studies are also required to address whether this risk factor is particularly salient due 
to the sociodemographic composition of our sample (e.g., predominantly male, Hispanic/
Latino) or whether it applies to individuals from different backgrounds.

Several limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting our findings. First, despite 
attempts to follow up with participants, there was substantial dropout, with nearly 39% of 
the initial sample not completing subsequent assessments. However, our attrition rate is 
consistent with those observed in other traumatic injury patient samples (deRoon-Cassini et 
al., 2010; Ravn et al., 2019). Furthermore, participants included in the analyses were 
generally similar to those excluded due to missing data, although those included were more 
likely to be Hispanic/Latino and had higher educational attainment. Second, even though we 
were able to measure similar posttraumatic symptom dimension constructs from T0 to T2, 
the measures differed across time points and symptom reference timeframes, as in previous 
studies of trajectories of emotional distress after trauma (e.g., deRoon-Cassini et al., 2010; 
Meli et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the different measures captured the same constructs and 
used similar response scales at each assessment, and we scaled scores so the ranges were 
equivalent across time. Additionally, prior trajectories research has used both the PCL and 
CAPS to index PTSD symptoms (Nash et al., 2014), as we did here. However, future 
research should employ the same measures at all assessments for maximum consistency. 
Third, this study was designed before the DSM-5 revision; thus, we used DSM-IV-based 
measures of posttraumatic psychopathology. Despite substantial overlap between the DSM-
IV and DSM-5 criteria for disorders like PTSD and depression, research using DSM-5-based 
measures is needed. Fourth, due to the design of the parent study, we lacked information 
about pre-trauma functioning, including preexisting psychopathology, which plays a role in 
psychological responses to trauma (Lowe et al., 2020; Osenbach et al., 2014). Fifth, results 
were obtained in a predominantly male, Hispanic/Latino sample with relatively low 
socioeconomic status, and thus may not generalize to other populations. That said, our study 
adds granularity to previous research by Marshall et al. (2009) revealing that Hispanic/
Latino individuals report distinctive patterns of PTSD symptoms after traumatic injury

compared to non-Hispanic/Latino individuals. Future research is needed to determine 
whether factors like race/ethnicity impact manifestations of posttraumatic symptom 
dimension trajectories and patterns of trajectory membership.

Conclusions

Many survivors of traumatic injury experience psychological distress related to these 
experiences (deRoon-Cassini et al., 2019; Zatzick et al., 2007). Our study demonstrates that 
there is substantial heterogeneity in trajectories of transdiagnostic symptom dimensions 
during the first five months after injury. Further research is needed to examine how these 
posttraumatic symptom dimension trajectories relate to other aspects of functioning over 
time, such as disability and quality of life. In addition, biomarker research may point to 
distinct etiologies underlying different longitudinal symptom dimension presentations. 
Incorporating factors across multiple levels of analysis has the potential to inform the 
development of comprehensive risk prediction models that could be used to target prevention 
efforts aimed at offsetting psychological distress after traumatic injury.

Longitudinal study of traumatic injury patients from a Level 1 trauma center

Examined transdiagnostic symptom dimensions of posttraumatic distress over 
time

Latent class growth analysis identified 3 or 4 trajectories for each dimension

Transdiagnostic symptom dimensions manifested in diverse ways after trauma

Unemployment emerged as the most important predictor of trajectory 
membership

Note. AIC = Akaike information criterion; BIC = Bayesian information criterion; VLMR = Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test; LMR = 
Lo-Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test. Lines highlighted in bold indicate the model that was selected to represent the latent trajectory 
structure for the symptom dimension.

a
The shape growth factor mean was estimated to be 0 and the basis coefficient at time t1 needed to be fixed to avoid singularity of the information 
matrix.

b

The shape growth factor mean for the fifth class was fixed to avoid singularity of the information matrix.

c

The residual variance needed to be set to 0 to avoid singularity of the information matrix.

d

The shape growth factor mean for the second class was fixed to avoid singularity of the information matrix.

e

The shape growth factor mean for the fourth class was fixed to avoid singularity of the information matrix.

f
Non-positive definite first-order derivative product matrix involving the shape growth factor mean for the fifth class.

Note. Results for “employment: disabled/other vs. full-time” are not reported because the small number of participants in the “disable/other” 
category rendered estimates unreliable. Cohab = cohabitating; CI = confidence interval; HS = high school; OR = odds ratio.
