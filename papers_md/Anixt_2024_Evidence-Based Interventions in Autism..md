INTRODUCTION

Primary care pediatricians have a crucial role in screening for autism and other intellectual 
and developmental disabilities1 and providing longitudinal care to children with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families. This review provides an overview of evidence-
based treatments to support optimal developmental-behavioral outcomes and independent 
living skills for children with ASD. The review is organized by treatment domains (ie, 
early intervention, communication, adaptive skills, and so forth) and within those domains 
information is presented by general age groups (ie, toddlers, preschoolers, adolescents).

Autism is a heterogeneous diagnosis including individuals with a wide range of intellectual 
abilities, communication skills, and associated behaviors. Every child with ASD has a 
unique set of strengths and challenges and there is no “one size fits all” model for treatment. 
Intervention recommendations should be customized to best meet the needs of each child, 
align with a family’s goals and priorities, and be feasible for the child and family in terms of 
time and cost. Families seeking care for autistic children may be inundated with information 
about therapy options of varying levels of evidence. Pediatricians play an important role in 
advising families that they are likely to hear about interventions for autism that are both 
evidence-based and non-evidence based. Conversations between pediatricians and families 
about ASD treatment choices can be enhanced using a shared decision-making approach. 
This allows the clinician to provide evidence-supported information and to identify a 
family’s goals, priorities, and values to ensure that the treatment plan is a good fit for 
the child and family. When making decisions about their child’s treatment, families should 
understand which practices have clear evidence of positive outcomes based on multiple 
research studies. To address the need for evidence-based practice guidelines for ASD based

on systematic review of the literature, the National Autism Center published the National 
Standards Project (NSP2, published in 2015)2 and the University of North Carolina National 
Clearinghouse on Autism Evidence and Practice (NCAEP) Review Team published an 
Evidence-Based Practices report in 2020.3 Both reports provide comprehensive and detailed 
information about ASD evidence-based interventions and associated outcomes. The findings 
from these reports are reflected in this review article.

Pediatricians play an important role in encouraging early diagnosis and intervention, 
advising families about evidence-based treatments for ASD, and supporting family’s 
emotional health as they care for a child with a developmental disability.4 The purpose 
of this article is to provide pediatricians with information about evidence-based autism 
treatments.

DISCUSSION

Importance of Early Intervention

Autism can be diagnosed with accuracy in children less than 2 years of age5 and when 
possible, the goal is to diagnose children before 3 years of age.6 The rationale for 
encouraging early identification and diagnosis of ASD is that interventions started before 
age 3, at a time when the brain is still developing and has more plasticity, are more likely 
to be effective long-term.7 The use of evidence-based early intervention (EI) services that 
promote building developmental skills sequentially and positive parent-child interactions 
improves outcomes.8–10 Unfortunately, common misconceptions such as giving it more time 
with a “wait and see” approach or that young children with developmental delays will “catch 
up,” can lead to delays in referrals to services11 and lost opportunities for intervention 
during critical windows for development. Several EI treatment models offer clear benefits to 
autistic children less than 3 years of age.5

Goals of Intervention Across the Lifespan

Younger age at enrollment into EI services has been associated with achieving greater 
gains in social communication, cognitive abilities, adaptive skills, and reduction of ASD 
symptom severity.12 There is a greater positive impact from interventions started before age 
3 years compared to those started after age 5 years.5,13,14 However, intervention services are 
beneficial for children with ASD at any age and can be started as soon as an ASD diagnosis 
is suspected or diagnosed. Treatment goals for children with ASD include (1) minimizing 
impact of challenges associated with core ASD symptoms (social communication difficulty, 
restricted interests/repetitive behaviors); (2) maximizing functional independence/adaptive 
skills; and (3) preventing, reducing, or minimizing the impact of behaviors that interfere 
with acquisition of functional skills.15 Intervention services need to be individualized to 
the specific child’s strengths and areas of difficulty and aligned with families’ goals and 
priorities. Shared decision-making between clinicians and families can be used to determine 
the best fit for a child’s participation in therapy services. Clinicians should provide 
information about evidence-based treatment options and consideration should be given 
to families’ sociocultural beliefs, family dynamics and support system, health insurance

coverage for treatments, and the family’s economic situation, all of which can impact the 
feasibility of participation in therapy.5,15

Determining a treatment plan for a child with autism requires an understanding of evidence-
based interventions, the family’s goals and priorities, and the unique strengths and needs 
of the child. Goals and needs may change over time and vary based on the child’s 
developmental stage. Table 1 provides information about potential evidence-based therapy 
options.

Federally Mandated Interventions and Services in the United States

Note: this section describes EI and educational services that are federally mandated in the 
United States and, therefore, may not be applicable in other countries. In 2012, guiding 
principles were published to support the international community to develop or refine EI 
programs to yield optimal outcomes for children with developmental delays/disabilities 
consistent with 2 United Nations international human rights treaties: the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.16

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding to 
states to support EI services for infants and toddlers from birth up to 3 years (part C) and 
special education services for preschool and school-aged children of 3 to 21 years (part B).17 
This is also discussed in the article Autism Spectrum Disorder at Home and in School.

Early intervention (part C): birth to age 3 years—Participation in EI services 
for infants and toddlers with developmental delays is associated with positive long-term 
outcomes in language, cognition, academics, and behavior.8 An Individual Family Service 
Plan (IFSP) is developed by the EI professionals with family input documenting the 
child’s goals and services. Best practices for EI services include creating opportunities for 
“learning in the natural environment” and using a family “coaching” model.8 The contact 
information for every state’s EI program can be found on the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) website: https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/parents/state-text.html. 
The CDC’s “Learn the Signs. Act Early.” Program18 provides resources to parents to track 
developmental milestones and learn more about EI services.

Part B services: preschool-aged and school-aged services—Preschool-aged 
children (3–5 years old) with ASD can be referred to their public school district for 
evaluation for eligibility for special education preschool services (part B). For children 
less than 3 years receiving EI services, the IFSP team will orient families and facilitate 
the transition of supports to part B special educations services.17 Preschool-aged (3–5 
years) and school-aged children (6–21 years) referred to the school district will undergo 
multidisciplinary team evaluations to determine eligibility for Individualized Education 
Program (IEP) services. Eligibility for an IEP is based on the child meeting criteria for 
a categorical determination of a disability as defined by IDEA (such as autism, intellectual 
disability, speech or language impairment, other health impairment, and so forth) and this 
condition affecting school performance and learning.17 If eligible, children can begin to 
receive services once an IEP is developed. The IEP documents goals and services and is

or therapy reports with the school district to support the development of IEP goals.

EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS

Core Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptoms

For children less than 3 year old with ASD, best practice involves participation in 
interventions starting as early as possible that include a combination of developmental 
and behavioral approaches, meaning therapies that are evidence-based and are adjusted 
to the child’s developmental level and use behaviorally based strategies and teaching 
methods.5 Evidence-based interventions for autism treatment are described in 2 categories: 
(1) comprehensive treatment models (CTMs) and (2) evidence-based practices (EBPs) or 
focused intervention practices.3,19–21 Both CTMs and EBPs are effective across a range of 
ages and developmental levels, although CTM programs target building essential skills for 
younger children (0–9 years of age).2 Additionally, participation in outpatient therapies 
(described in following paragraph #3) such as speech-language therapy, occupational 
therapy (OT), and behavior therapy can support skill development to address common 
symptoms of autism (ie, communication difficulty) and co-occurring developmental delays/
disabilities or behavioral challenges.

Comprehensive treatment models: target age range 0 to 9 years—CTMs 
include intensive EIs that address skills important for early childhood development 
including communication, social, and adaptive skills. CTMs are based on a conceptual 
framework that supports broad learning and skill development to impact core features 
of ASD.20 Additionally, CTMs are characterized by the use of manualized procedures, 
intensity (substantial number of hours per week), longevity (treatment occurs for 1 year 
or longer), and a focus on broad outcomes (ie, communication, behavior, social).3 CTM 
programs may use approaches of applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and/or naturalistic 
approaches (strategies provided in the context of typical social activities in community 
settings).15 Examples of CTM programs include Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention 
(EIBI), Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-Handicapped 
Children, the Early Start Denver Model, or similar behavioral inclusive programs.2,15 Table 
2 describes characteristics of several CTMs. These programs use similar evidence-based 
strategies such as using a visual schedule to communicate the activities that the child will 
be doing and providing reinforcement when a child is learning a new skill. In addition to 
building developmental skills such as self-feeding using utensils or toilet training, CTM 
programs integrate behavioral approaches to increase or decrease target behaviors. There 
is no evidence to support which specific CTM approach is the best fit for each child. 
There are also regional differences in the availability of programs. However, pediatricians 
can confidently recommend these evidence-supported CTMs (see Table 2) and should 
encourage families to choose a program based on their goals, preferences, and factors such 
as availability and cost.

Evidence-based practices (also called focused intervention practices): all 
ages—EBPs are strategies designed to teach an individual skill or to address a specific

goal.19,21 EBPs are the basic units or building blocks that are combined to form educational 
programs for children with ASD including CTMs, public school special education 
interventions, and outpatient therapies.20,21 Some examples of EBPs are discrete trial 
training (an instruction is given, child responds, a planned consequence is provided, and 
a pause before presenting next instruction), prompting (verbal or gesture assistance given 
to learner to support acquiring a skill), video modeling (video-recorded demonstration of a 
target skill is shown to learner), and visual supports (visual display to support learner engage 
in behavior without additional prompts).21 These focused interventions can be used for short 
periods of time, until a specific goal is achieved, and may address skills in the areas of 
behavior, development, or education.

Outpatient therapies: all ages—Children with ASD benefit from participation in 
outpatient therapies delivered by licensed professionals to support skill development across 
multiple domains. Examples of outpatient therapies include speech-language therapy, OT, 
and behavior therapy. Children receiving part C or part B services (EI or school-based 
services) can supplement these interventions with outpatient therapies to provide increased 
frequency and intensity of intervention and address goals impacting the child outside of the 
educational setting (ie, difficulty getting haircuts, tantrums when transitioning from activity 
to another). Caregiver involvement and practicing specific skills at home and within the 
community are critical components for the success of outpatient therapies. For example, if 
a child is learning to use 1 to 2 word phrases to request or make choices in speech therapy, 
the caregiver should work on practicing this skill at home (eg, choosing what snack the 
child wants, choosing what toy the child wants to play with) and within the community (eg, 
choosing a book to check out at the library, choosing a cereal to buy at the grocery store). 
The role of outpatient therapies will be described in each developmental domain section 
in the following paragraphs (ie, social communication, adaptive, behavior). Of note, for 
some children, outpatient therapies are not a feasible option due to challenges such as lack 
of access to pediatric therapists, long wait times, and financial barriers (limited insurance 
coverage, high co-payment fees).

Applied Behavioral Analysis and Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention

Principles of ABA are the foundation for most evidence-based treatment models for autism. 
ABA is a general behavioral learning theory, not a specific set of interventions.22 ABA 
has been defined as the process of applying learning theory principles to improve socially 
meaningful behaviors and evaluating if changes in behavior are due to the interventions.23 
ABA methods can include reinforcing social, communication, and other skills and are 
effective at reducing challenging behaviors that may interfere with a child’s progress 
toward educational or independent living goals.15,22 The goal of ABA is to promote 
meaningful growth in skill development (eg, adaptive skills, functional communication, 
emotional regulation) and generalize skills across environments (eg, community, home, 
school, different caregivers). EIBI programs, which are CTMs using ABA principles, 
have demonstrated positive outcomes, including 20% to 50% of children participating in 
EIBI programs achieving average intelligence quotient and placement in general education 
settings upon completion of treatment and 20% to 40% achieving moderate gains, but still 
requiring supports.13,22

ABA therapy can be delivered in a variety of settings including 1:1 or group settings, center-
based, or in more natural environments (home, school). An individualized treatment plan 
should be developed collaboratively between the family and the professional supervising 
the child’s ABA therapy program, typically a board-certified behavior analyst, to address 
identified priorities.

Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions

Naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI) approaches foster back-and-forth 
engagement between the child and the intervention provider.12 The intervention provider 
responds to the child’s interests, play, and communication approaches in an intentional way 
(eg, reading the child a book after a child points and requests it). Cues are provided to the 
child to promote behaviors with consequences naturally found in the environment providing 
reinforcement.2,12 Naturalistic interventions can be incorporated into typical activities and 
routines to support and encourage learners to build and promote skills in natural and 
contextually relevant environments, such as home, school, and the community.2,3,12

Parent-Mediated Intervention

Parent-mediated intervention, also called parent training, describes a variety of approaches 
in which parents receive training to implement strategies to promote building their child’s 
social communication skills or reducing challenging behaviors.2,3,15 Parent training can 
occur individually or in group settings and can provide strategies to target core ASD 
symptoms (eg, building expressive language and joint attention skills) to teach new skills to 
a child (eg, engaging in play with other peers) or to reduce disruptive behaviors.

SOCIAL COMMUNICATION

Building communication and social skills is a key focus of interventions for children 
with ASD from the toddler/preschool years through adolescence. Interventions supporting 
communication are generally delivered by speech-language pathologists and those 
supporting social skills can be delivered by professionals in multiple disciplines, including 
speech-language pathology, psychology, special education, and OT.

Toddlers and Preschool-Aged Children

When toddlers and preschoolers are diagnosed with ASD, they may have no or limited 
verbal language and no or limited means of functionally communicating their needs and 
wants (eg, requesting items, asking for help). Developing both areas is critical at this age, 
especially the latter. Evidence-based strategies that target communication skills include 
behavioral interventions, naturalistic teaching strategies, functional communication training, 
language training (production), modeling, scripting, and augmentative and alternative 
communication (AAC).2,3

Communication goals can be incorporated into treatment programs utilizing behavioral 
interventions or naturalistic teaching strategies. Functional communication training, as 
a circumscribed intervention, is complementary to these strategies. It seeks to identify 
problematic behaviors in a child that serve a communication purpose and replace them

with more appropriate means of communication, for example, verbal language or AAC. 
Language training (production) centers on helping autistic children use their spoken words 
functionally. Modeling and scripting are ways a desired behavior or response to social 
situation can be modeled for children with ASD. With scripting, a verbal script for a specific 
social situation is modeled for and practiced with the child. Given the range of evidence-
based strategies available, it is beneficial for children with ASD to have a speech-language 
pathologist with competencies in ASD as part of their larger treatment team.

AAC focuses on the use of communication systems that do not rely on verbal language, 
including sign language, Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS), and speech-
generating devices (SGDs). Across these approaches, the use of PECS and SGDs, 
compared to sign language, has been found to be more effective in building fundamental 
communication skills, like requesting.24 Effectiveness of AAC is enhanced when it is 
used to teach communication skills in specific routines (eg, mealtimes).25 Many parents 
express concern that using AAC will prevent their child from developing verbal language. 
Contrary to this belief, studies have shown that AAC does not impede verbal language and 
may increase it modestly. More research is needed on child and treatment (frequency and 
intensity of intervention) factors that influence outcomes with AAC.26

The evidence-based strategies described earlier are also effective for building social and play 
skills (eg, imitative play, make-believe play, turn taking with peers and adults) in toddlers 
and preschoolers with ASD. Additionally, parent training, peer-mediated interventions, and 
social narratives are effective in building these skills.2,3 Social narratives have similarities 
with modeling and scripting. They utilize visuals and/or written words to describe to the 
child what they can expect of a specific social situation and how to respond to it. There 
is emerging evidence for interventions centered on specific social communication skills 
like imitation, eye contact, gestures, joint attention, and play.27,28 THe effect sizes for this 
intervention are moderate and enhanced for children of younger ages with higher dosage of 
treatment.

School-Aged Children

For school-aged autistic children, the same evidence-based strategies utilized to promote 
communication and social skills in toddlers and preschoolers with ASD are applicable. 
Peer-mediated interventions in home or school settings may be more impactful. Peers are 
trained in how to respond during social interactions with the child who has ASD (eg, 
engaging in back-and-forth conversation, taking turns playing a game). These interventions 
have been shown to increase frequency and duration of social interactions, as well as help 
build the use of AAC.29 It is unclear if they have impact on verbal language.

Adolescents

In adolescents with ASD, the following evidence-based strategies remain effective for 
promoting communication and social skills—modeling, scripting, AAC, parent training, and 
peer-mediated interventions. Additionally, social skills packages are an effective, evidence-
based strategy for this age group.2,3,30 This intervention centers on helping a teenager 
with ASD build skills needed to participate in social experiences across settings, namely,

home, school, and in the community. The Program for the Education and Enrichment of 
Relational Skills (PEERS) is a manualized social skills intervention package for autistic 
adolescents and young adults that has been designated as evidence-based in increasing 
specific social skills31,32 (eg, reciprocal conversations, interactions with same-aged peers, 
etc.) both immediately after treatment and at follow-up. PEERS for adolescents consists 
of 14 weekly and concurrent sessions for both adolescents and their parent/caregiver. In 
the adolescent group, evidence-based strategies such as direct instruction, modeling, video 
modeling, and reinforcement are used to teach concepts such as having a back-and-forth 
conversation, dealing with teasing and bullying, and hosting a get-together for a friend. In 
the caregiver group, caregivers receive instruction on what the adolescents are learning and 
also receive coaching on how to provide feedback to adolescents during weekly homework 
assignments (eg, joining a club or activity, having a friend over, and so forth). Research has 
shown that many social skills packages have a positive impact on their social knowledge, but 
it is unclear how much it improves their participation in social activities.30

Lastly, there is growing research on extended reality interventions, for example, virtual or 
augmented reality (VAR) environments, for child and adolescents with ASD. In studies of 
VAR interventions, the effectiveness of this intervention ranges from weak to strong for 
promoting social skills.33,34 Older age was found to contribute to larger improvements, 
while the presence of comorbid conditions was found to contribute to smaller improvements.

It is important to note that, sometimes, families seek interventions that are not evidence-
based. Currently, facilitated communication and rapid prompting method do not have an 
evidence base for building communication and social skills in children with ASD. They are 
also not supported by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.35

ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR

Adaptive behavior is defined as the ability of an individual to be independent and self-
sufficient in the areas of communication, socialization, and daily living skills.36 The authors 
will focus on daily living skills in this section since communication and socialization are 
covered in other sections of this review. Daily living skills are the everyday tasks and 
behaviors an individual does to take care of themselves at home, school, work, and in 
the community and are categorized into personal/self-care (eg, getting dressed, brushing 
teeth, showering, taking medications), domestic (eg, picking up belongings, cleaning one’s 
room, cooking meals, doing laundry), and community (eg, telling time, buying items at the 
store, getting around the community, and managing and budgeting money).37 Interventions 
supporting adaptive skills can be delivered by professionals in multiple disciplines, including 
OT, psychology, and special education.

Toddlers and Preschool-Aged Children

Daily living skills that are critical for toddlers and preschoolers include getting dressed, 
eating and drinking, basic personal hygiene (eg, washing hands, brushing teeth), toileting, 
and simple household chores (eg, picking up toys). Increased age, higher cognitive abilities, 
few behavior problems, and less severe ASD symptoms are associated with better daily 
living skills in this age group.38 Preschool children with autism demonstrate a significant

gap between their chronologic age and daily living skills, which suggests these skills need 
to be prioritized in intervention to increase the likelihood of attaining positive outcomes 
in adulthood.38,39 Evidence-based interventions for this age range are typically behavioral 
(eg, discrete trial training, extinction, reinforcement, prompting), and may also include video 
modeling, visual supports, social narratives, or the use of technology.3 It can be highly 
beneficial for caregivers to work with psychologists or occupational therapists to develop 
goals and implement evidence-based strategies when targeting the acquisition and mastery 
of these skills.

School-Aged Children

Adolescents

Daily living skills that are critical for autistic school-aged children include hygiene (eg, 
taking a bath or shower), cooking snacks and simple meals, helping with their laundry, 
cleaning their room, understanding the concept of time, and developing an understanding 
of spending and saving money. The gap between chronologic age and actual daily living 
skills continues to widen as children start school, which makes it critical to intervene.39,40 
While many evidence-based strategies to address age-appropriate daily living skills continue 
to be behavioral (eg, reinforcement, prompting), additional strategies such as task analysis 
and cognitive behavioral intervention strategies may be useful. For example, if a school-aged 
child is struggling to complete their morning hygiene routine before school, this skill could 
be explicitly broken down into its component steps (eg, wake up with alarm, get dressed, 
put pajamas in hamper, brush teeth, comb hair, and so forth) using a task analysis and then 
used as a checklist to help them consistently and independently complete this routine (Fig. 
1). The child could then be rewarded (eg, verbal praise, 10 minutes of screen time before 
school) for completing the routine independently or with minimal prompts from a caregiver.

Daily living skills that are essential for continuing to build independence and autonomy 
prior to the transition to adulthood include personal care and hygiene (eg, wearing 
deodorant, taking medications, beginning to manage health care appointments), cooking 
meals, cleaning the home (eg, vacuum/mop, taking trash out), household maintenance 
(eg, cutting the grass), managing money (eg, budgeting for expenses), and navigating 
the community (eg, biking, walking, driving). The gap between daily living skills and 
chronologic age is often very apparent in adolescence such that a teen’s skills may be 6 to 
8 years behind their peers,41,42 which then directly affects their ability to achieve positive 
adult outcomes in college, employment, independent living, and quality of life.42 Evidence-
based strategies such as prompting, reinforcement, visual supports, and task analysis 
continue to be effective for teaching these skills. However, additional strategies such as self-
monitoring and technology-aided instruction may be particularly effective in adolescence. 
For example, surviving and thriving in the real world is a manualized intervention that 
has shown promise in increasing age-appropriate daily living skills in autistic adolescents 
in the areas of hygiene, laundry, cleaning, cooking, and managing money.43 An essential 
intervention component is the use of a contract to define specific daily living skills goals and 
expectations, monitor daily/weekly progress, and specify the reward or privilege that will be 
earned. Technology strategies such as alarms (eg, to switch laundry from the washer to the

AM everyday) are often incorporated to build autonomy.

BEHAVIOR AND MENTAL HEALTH

While disruptive behaviors are not a core feature of ASD, it is common for children with 
ASD to experience challenging behaviors such as inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, 
anxiety, irritability, tantrums, refusal behaviors, aggression, and self-injury.44 In a population 
of about 600 children with ASD from 13 sites across North America participating in an 
autism learning health network, 93% of parents of children of ages 6 to 12 years reported 
problematic behaviors in the past month, with 85% indicating these behaviors were of 
moderate or worse intensity (moderate [47%], severe [28%], or extremely severe [10%]).44 
Co-occurring psychiatric conditions occur in up to 70% of children with ASD.45 Attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and oppositional defiant disorder are among 
the most commonly reported conditions45 and 41% to 61% of children with ASD have 2 or 
more psychiatric conditions.46

Identifying Triggers and Patterns of Challenging Behavior

Conducting a functional behavioral assessment (FBA) is the first step to developing an 
effective intervention plan to address challenging behavior. The FBA involves observation 
and data collection to identify the “ABCs” of a behavior—the antecedent (what happens 
before the behavior), the behavior of concern, and the consequence (what happens after the 
behavior). These data are then used to determine the function of a maladaptive behavior 
(why is the child engaging in the behavior?) to determine how to respond to the behavior to 
make a change and disrupt the persistence of the behavior. Common functions of behavior 
include wanting to get something, such as attention or a tangible object, or wanting to 
escape something. Sometimes it can be difficult to identify the function of a behavior. 
If disruptive behavior seems to occur “out of the blue,” without an identifiable trigger, 
it is important to evaluate for possible underlying medical reasons for the behavior such 
as pain, dental problems, sleep disorders, or constipation, for which children with ASD 
are at increased risk.47,48 Additionally, clinicians may want to consider evaluation for a 
possible co-occurring mood disorder. The FBA approach can be used in therapy and school/
classroom settings to develop effective behavior plans.

Behavior and Mental Health Interventions

Parent training—Parent training models are an evidence-based intervention for the 
treatment of disruptive behaviors including ADHD in typically developing children. 
These include programs such as Incredible Years, Positive Parenting Program, and Parent-
Child Interaction therapy.49–51 Through participation in these programs, parents gain an 
understanding of the child’s behavior and skills to respond to the child and reinforce desired 
behaviors. However, less is known about the effectiveness of parent-mediated interventions 
in children with developmental disabilities including autism.52 While parent training was 
found to be superior to parent education in reducing disruptive behavior in a randomized 
control trial,53 a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of parent training for children

with ASD concluded that methodological limitations make it difficult to draw conclusions 
about effectiveness and generalizability of specific parent training programs at this time.54

Cognitive behavioral therapy—Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective 
treatment for pediatric anxiety disorders in the typically developing population, with 
approximately 60% of children rated as much improved or very much improved on the 
Clinician Global Impression-Improvement Scale after 14 sessions of CBT.55 Systematic 
reviews have found moderate efficacy of CBT for the treatment of anxiety in autistic youth 
without an intellectual disability.56,57 Manualized CBT intervention programs have been 
adapted to meet the needs of individuals with ASD, including adjustments to materials to 
provide visual cues and role-playing.2 CBT interventions teach participants to evaluate their 
thoughts and emotions and then use step-by-step strategies to change their thinking and 
behavior.3 These interventions can be helpful at addressing challenging behaviors related to 
emotions such as anger and anxiety.3

Facing your fears—Facing Your Fears (FYF) is a cognitive behavioral intervention 
for autistic school-aged children (ages 8–14) that uses evidence strategies to increase 
recognition of anxiety symptoms (eg, thoughts, feelings, physical reactions) and then teaches 
a range of age-appropriate coping strategies (eg, worry bugs, exposure strategies). FYF 
sessions are attended by both children and their caregiver, and they then break into separate 
groups to allow for additional instruction, practice, and coaching. In particular, caregivers 
are coached to provide supportive feedback and support as their child learns how cope with 
their anxiety and generalize these skills to other settings (eg, school, social interactions with 
peers).58

Additional evidence-based strategies—For children who do not have the cognitive 
or communication skills to participate in CBT, other evidence-based strategies and tools 
can be helpful for reducing stress and anxiety such as use of visual supports. Visual 
supports provide information in a visual format, which can include photographs, pictures, 
or checklists that may or may not be paired with words (eg, listing the steps for calming 
down when feeling frustrated or anxious). Visual schedules are a type of visual support that 
prepares children to participate in an activity or routine by providing information about what 
to expect, including what they need to do, what will happen as a result, and when the activity 
will be done.3

Executive Functioning

School-aged and adolescents—It is estimated that between 35% to 70% of autistic 
children and adolescents have significant challenges in the area of executive functioning, 
which includes skills such as organization, planning, prioritizing, time management, 
initiating tasks, persevering on tasks, completing tasks, multitasking, and working 
memory.59 Executive functioning impairments have been shown to impact performance 
at both home (eg, completing homework assignments, getting household chores done) and 
school (eg, writing down assignments in a planner, taking notes, bringing materials to 
class) and are also predictors of poor outcomes in adulthood.60 The profile of executive 
functioning in autistic individuals appears to be similar to those with a diagnosis of

ADHD61 and they may benefit from similar treatments. For example, several evidence-based 
supports and strategies (eg, task analysis, graphic organizers, technology such as alarms 
and reminders) and interventions (eg, Unstuck and On Target, Achieving Independence and 
Mastery in School) have been identified to be implemented at both home and school to 
address specific executive functioning difficulties in autistic individuals.3,62 Children and 
adolescents may benefit from attending group or individual treatment to learn compensatory 
strategies (eg, using a binder to organize classroom materials, creating flash cards to study) 
to address executive functioning challenges. Caregivers are often an integral component of 
treatment so that they can assist their child in implementing specific strategies (eg, writing 
down and prioritizing assignments in a planner) at home and school.

Sensory processing—Many children with ASD have difficulty with sensory processing. 
Hyperactivity or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual sensory interests in aspects of 
the environment is one of the restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior symptoms included 
in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic 
criteria for ASD.63 In children with ASD, sensory processing difficulty can present with a 
range of behaviors such as food selectivity and restricted eating habits, sensitivity to loud or 
unexpected noises (covering ears, becoming upset), visual examination (looking at objects 
out the side of the eye, visual fixation on spinning objects or lights), or tactile sensitivity (not 
liking how it feels to wear clothes or shoes). Sensory sensitivities can negatively interfere 
with day-to-day functioning and participation in therapies and educational activities. 
Occupational therapists can work with a child and their family to gradually expose the 
child to sensory challenges and support them in learning strategies to cope with it.22 The 
evidence-based Ayres Sensory Integration64 approach uses individually customized activities 
to support sensory processing, motor planning, movement, and organization in space, and 
“just right” challenges to help children process and tolerate sensory information from their 
body and the environment (visual, auditory, tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular).3

Case presentation #1: preschool-aged child with autism, delays in communication and 
adaptive skills, and behavior challenges.: Henry is a 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed 
with ASD and global developmental delay at the age of 2 years. He has minimal verbal 
language and only uses a few single words for requesting. He is not toilet trained. He has 
sensory aversions, especially related to toothbrushing and feeding. He has 10 foods that he 
eats consistently. Henry also has difficulty with transitions which often cause him to have 
a meltdown (eg, dropping to the floor, screaming, and throwing things). He was enrolled 
in EI services when he was 18 month old. After his diagnosis of autism, he also received 
outpatient speech therapy and OT. His parents tried to enroll him in ABA therapy but were 
not successful due to long waitlists for ABA programs in their community. Since turning 
3 years old, he has been enrolled in an EIBI preschool program. In the classroom, he is 
using PECS and more single words to communicate. Initially he handled transitions well in 
the classroom, although transitions continued to be a challenge at home. However, recently 
he has been having more meltdowns at school. His teachers describe him as seeming more 
irritable. Henry and his parents are currently concerned that his behavioral meltdowns have 
become more frequent both at home and at school.

Clinical question.: What additional questions would you ask Henry’s parents about his 
behavior? What guidance would you offer them?

Case discussion.: This case illustrates some of the challenges that parents of preschool-aged 
children with ASD face in navigating behavior. The history shared by Henry’s parents 
indicates that he had frequent meltdowns, but they have acutely worsened and are now 
occurring more frequently at his preschool. It is helpful to think about antecedents or 
triggers for these meltdowns and it may even be helpful for school personnel to conduct 
a FBA. For example, in preschool, was there a change in classroom staffing, structure, 
or routine? Was there recently an extended school holiday (ie, winter break)? Henry’s 
parents responded “no” to these questions and also noted that his daily routine at home 
is unchanged. Medical factors like dental cavities or constipation can cause discomfort 
and pain, which, in turn, can result in behavior changes in a child with limited verbal 
language. Henry’s parents explain that he has always been a picky eater. They worry about 
his nutrition and fiber intake. Usually, he has bowel movements about 2 to 3 times a week, 
but it has been less frequent in the last month (1–2 times a week). You determine he has 
constipation and recommend a bowel clean out and use of a daily stool softener. You also 
discuss the use of visual supports to help with understanding the structure of his day and 
up-coming transitions. For example, a “first, then” board could help Henry transition to 
a non-preferred task (eg, get shoes on and get in the car to drive to school) and then be 
rewarded with a preferred activity (eg, looking at a book about vehicles).

Treatment recommendations

•

•

•

•

•

Continue use of daily stool softener for constipation and monitor symptoms.

Consider referral for feeding therapy with OT or psychology to work on 
expanding Henry’s food repertoire.

Continue participation in EIBI program. Discuss Henry’s behavior concerns at 
home with EIBI team for suggestions of strategies that have been helpful at 
school and could be generalized to the home setting.

Continue use of visual support strategies, such as “first, then” board and visual 
schedule to help Henry prepare for transitions and increase his communication 
skills.

Consider referral for speech therapy to assist parents with understanding how to 
build communication skills at home.

Case presentation #2: school-aged child with autism and executive functioning 
difficulty.: Leo is a 10-year-old male in the fourth grade who was diagnosed with autism 
at 4 years of age. He also has a diagnosis of ADHD-combined type and takes a stimulant 
medication. Leo has an IEP at school and receives speech-language therapy to address 
social communication difficulties (eg, asking for help, initiating interactions with peers) 
and OT (eg, coping with changes in his schedule, managing his emotions by taking a 
break). His cognitive abilities are in the low average range and he struggles with reading 
comprehension, which is impacting his ability to do well in school and complete homework

on his own. He currently struggles with having back-and-forth conversations with peers and 
adults and wants to have friends, but he struggles to interact with peers at school and at 
baseball. Leo is very interested in video games, prefers to talk about this topic with others, 
and wants to play video games whenever he has free time at home. Leo has executive 
functioning difficulties (eg, organizing materials, planning, and prioritizing tasks). His daily 
living skills are below average for his age in that he still needs a lot of assistance and 
prompting to do simple chores (eg, clean his room, put belongings away) and personal 
hygiene tasks (eg, shower, brush teeth). Leo struggles to cope with his emotions at home and 
school such that he yells and cries when he is feeling overwhelmed, or when he does not get 
what he wants.

Clinical question.: What types of interventions would be helpful for optimizing Leo’s 
academic success, emotional functioning, and independent living skills?

Case discussion.: This case illustrates that children with autism benefit from a 
multidisciplinary intervention approach. This child in the case is receiving school-based 
services through an IEP. With an IEP, children with autism can receive educational supports 
for learning difficulties, in this case with reading comprehension, and related services such 
as speech-language therapy and OT services. An IEP for a student with Leo’s ADHD 
and executive functioning difficulties could also include accommodations to support slower 
processing time (ie, extended time on tests) and organizational difficulty (ie, use of a 
planner to be signed daily by his teacher). In addition to impacting his functioning in 
an educational setting, Leo’s autism-related challenges also affect his social and daily 
skills functioning at home and in the community. Therefore, Leo would also benefit from 
receiving outpatient therapies such as social skills training and OT or psychology treatment 
to support independence with daily living skills and strategies to improve executive 
functioning.

Treatment recommendations—After meeting with his developmental pediatrician and 
reviewing his current presentation and caregiver concerns, the following recommendations 
were made:

•

•

•

Continue to receive services at school through his IEP and inquire about specific 
intervention to help with reading comprehension.

Social communication—(1) enroll in a social skills group to receive instruction 
on specific skills, (2) set up play dates with peers he is interested in having 
a relationship with, to practice social skills and provide him with feedback on 
what he did well and what he can improve upon, (3) continue involvement in 
extracurricular activities.

Executive functioning—(1) work with occupational therapist or psychologist to 
develop strategies that may increase his organization and planning/prioritizing 
skills (eg, setting up a homework routine that includes a quiet space, creating 
a “to-do” list of assignments in his planner, working for 20 minutes, and then 
taking a 5-minute break).

Daily living skills—work with an occupational therapist or psychologist to 
develop a plan for building his skills by utilizing evidence-based strategies such 
as a task analysis (eg, break down the steps for cleaning his room and then teach 
him how to do each step until he is independent).

Emotion management—work with a psychologist to develop a plan by utilizing 
cognitive behavioral–based strategies to increase his ability to identify and then 
cope with emotions (eg, take a break by going to his room and playing Legos for 
5 minutes when he is overwhelmed with homework).

SUMMARY

Developmental outcomes for autistic children are optimized when a diagnosis is made at 
a young age (<3 years) and with prompt connection to intervention services as early as 
possible when a diagnosis of ASD is suspected or confirmed. Children less than 3 years of 
age with suspected ASD or other developmental delays should be referred to their state’s 
EI (part C) services, or if age 3 years or older, to their public school district (part B) for 
eligibility evaluation and to start services as soon as a concern is identified, even if a child 
has not yet completed medical diagnostic evaluations. Goals of treatment for ASD include 
(1) minimizing the impact of core ASD symptom–associated challenges, (2) maximizing 
adaptive skills and independence, and (3) reducing the impact of behaviors that negatively 
affect achievement of functional skills.15

Evidence-based interventions that address core ASD symptoms are categorized as 
either CTMs or focused intervention practices. Participation in CTMs, which generally 
use an ABA approach and focused intervention practices, is associated with optimal 
outcomes for the child. Younger age at enrollment in CTM intervention is associated 
with greater gains in social communication, cognitive abilities, adaptive skills, and 
reduction of ASD symptom severity.6 Children and adolescents with ASD benefit from 
connection to multidisciplinary professionals including speech-language pathologists, 
occupational therapists, and psychologists, behavior therapists, and other mental health 
professionals. Participation in speech-language therapy supports the development of 
functional communication skills through strategies such as AAC, modeling, and scripting. 
PEERS social skills intervention package improves adolescent social knowledge.

Challenging behavior and mental health concerns are common in autistic children and 
adolescents. Collaboration with psychologists and the use of FBAs can support the 
development of effective behavior plans to address disruptive behaviors. CBT is an effective 
treatment for anxiety in autistic youth without intellectual disability. Interventions that 
address adaptive behaviors and executive functioning promote independent living skills and 
success in school and work environments. Table 1 provides a summary of intervention 
services and therapies that may be considered to support optimal outcomes for children and 
adolescents with ASD.

KEY POINTS

•

•

•

Refer children with suspected autism for diagnostic evaluations and early 
intervention services as soon as possible.

Participation in evidence-based interventions for autism improves outcomes 
across multiple domains: core autism symptoms, communication, cognition, 
behavior, and adaptive and social skills.

There is no “one size fits all” approach to autism treatment—consider each 
child’s strengths and challenges and families’ priorities and goals.

CLINICS CARE POINTS

•

•

•

•

•

Children with suspected autism should be referred for diagnostic evaluations 
and EI services as soon as possible.

Starting evidence-based EI at a young age (<3 years) is associated with 
greater positive impact on outcomes.

CTM interventions are associated with improvement in core autism 
symptoms, cognitive abilities, communication skills, adaptive skills, and 
behavior.

Consider referral for evidence-based therapies to support communication, 
social skills, adaptive skills, sensory processing, behavior, and mental health 
in children with autism, depending on each child’s strengths and challenges.

Pediatricians play an important role in advising families about evidence-based 
versus non-evidence–based treatments for autism.
