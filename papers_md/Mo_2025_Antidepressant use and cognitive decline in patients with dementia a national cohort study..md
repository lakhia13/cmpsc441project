Abstract 
Background  Dementia is associated with psychiatric symptoms but the effects of antidepressants on cognitive func‑
tion in dementia are understudied. We aimed to investigate the association between antidepressants and cognitive 
decline in patients with dementia, and the risk of severe dementia, fractures and death, depending on antidepressant 
class, drug, and dose.

Methods  This is a national cohort study. Patients with dementia registered in the Swedish Registry for Cognitive/
Dementia Disorders‑SveDem from May 1, 2007, until October 16, 2018, with at least one follow‑up after dementia 
diagnosis, and who were new users of antidepressants, were included. Antidepressant use as a time varying exposure 
defined during the 6 months leading up to dementia diagnosis or each subsequent follow‑up. We used linear mixed 
models to examine the association between antidepressant use and cognitive trajectories assessed by Mini‑Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) scores. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate the hazard ratios for severe 
dementia (MMSE score < 10), fracture, and death. We compared antidepressant classes and drugs, and analyzed 
dose–response.

Results  We included 18740 patients (10 205 women [54.5%]; mean [SD] age, 78.2[7.4] years), of which 4271 (22.8%) 
received at least one prescription for an antidepressant. During follow‑up, a total of 11912 prescriptions for anti‑
depressants were issued, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) being the most common (64.8%). 
Antidepressant use was associated with faster cognitive decline (β (95% CI) = − 0.30(− 0.39, − 0.21) points/year), 
in particular sertraline (− 0.25(− 0.43, − 0.06) points/year), citalopram (− 0.41(− 0.55, − 0.27) points/year), escitalopram 
(− 0.76(− 1.09, − 0.44) points/year), and mirtazapine (− 0.19(− 0.34, − 0.04) points/year) compared with non‑use. The 
association was stronger in patients with severe dementia (initial MMSE scores 0–9). Escitalopram showed a greater 
decline rate than sertraline. Compared with non‑use, dose response of SSRIs on greater cognitive decline and higher 
risks of severe dementia, all‑cause mortality, and fracture were observed.

Conclusions  In this cohort study, current antidepressant use was associated with faster cognitive decline; further‑
more, higher dispensed doses of SSRIs were associated with higher risk for severe dementia, fractures, and all‑cause

of different antidepressants use in patients with dementia.

Keywords  Dementia, Antidepressants, Cognitive decline, Mortality, Cohort

Background
Antidepressants are widely used in patients with demen-
tia  to  improve  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  such  as 
anxiety,  depression,  aggression,  and  sleep  disorders  [1]. 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and sero-
tonin  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  (SNRIs)  are 
considered first-line pharmacotherapy for depression due 
to fewer side effects compared to other classes of antide-
pressants. However, older adults with depression receiv-
ing  SSRIs/SNRIs  were  associated  with  an  increased  risk 
of dementia compared to psychotherapy [2].

The  clinical  efficacy  of  antidepressants  on  demen-
tia  progression  is  uncertain.  Tricyclic  antidepressants 
(TCAs) are anticholinergics and negatively impact cogni-
tion [3]. In contrast, a beneficial impact of SSRIs on neu-
rogenesis  and  pathologic  biomarkers,  including  amyloid 
burden and tau deposits, has been reported [4, 5], along 
with evidence suggesting they may delay the progression 
from  mild  cognitive  impairment  (MCI)  to  Alzheimer’s 
dementia  (AD)  [6,  7]  among  persons  with  depression. 
The  different  cognitive  effects  of  antidepressant  classes 
may be due to the different mechanisms of action, driven 
by how these drugs proximally act on various neurotrans-
mitters in the brain [3]. Based on the national guidelines 
for care of depression and anxiety syndrome in Sweden, 
sertraline and escitalopram form the first-line of therapy 
for  older  patients  [8].  However,  antidepressants  do  not 
seem to work as well in people with dementia, and dys-
functions  of  cognitive  control  in  dementia  appears  to 
decrease the effectiveness of some SSRIs [9].

Findings  from  observational  studies  investigating  the 
impact  of  antidepressant  use  on  cognitive  outcomes  are 
inconclusive.  Some  longitudinal  data  observed  slower 
declines in cognition with antidepressant use in patients 
with AD [10, 11], while most of the cohort studies found 
no  evidence  for  an  association  between  antidepressant 
use  and  post-treatment  cognitive  decline  [12–15],  and 
negative  associations  of  antidepressant  use  with  sub-
sequent  cognitive  impairment  has  been  reported  [16, 
17].  Previous  analyses  were  limited  to  the  period  before 
dementia  diagnosis  [15],  a  single  population,  such  as 
patients with depression but not in patients with demen-
tia  [12,  14,  16],  a  short-term  follow-up  11  [13],  and 
reporting the effect of antidepressants on cognition as a 
secondary  outcome  [17].  There  is  a  gap  in  understand-
ing  how  different  antidepressant  classes,  specific  drugs, 
and  doses  affect  the  progression  of  cognitive  decline  in 

patients  with  dementia.  Moreover,  existing  studies  have 
not  thoroughly  explored  how  individual  factors,  such  as 
age, sex, and dementia severity, may modify the associa-
tion between antidepressant use and cognitive outcomes.
Some  antidepressants  have  anticholinergic  activities 
which  could  contribute  to  worse  cognition,  and  poten-
tially,  falls  and  mortality,  particularly  in  dementia  types 
with  cholinergic  deficit  such  as  AD  and  dementia  with 
Lewy  bodies  (DLB)  [18–20].  Moreover,  previous  stud-
ies were conducted mainly in patients with AD; findings 
related  to  other  dementias,  such  as  vascular  dementia 
(VaD)  [21],  frontotemporal  dementia  (FTD)  [22],  DLB 
[23], and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) are scarce. 
Long-term  follow-up  studies  are  difficult  due  to  high 
attrition rates and loss of follow-up [24]. Currently, direct 
comparisons  of  different  individual  drugs  on  cognitive 
decline in patients with dementia are lacking.

This  study  examines  the  long-term  effect  of  antide-
pressants  on  cognitive  decline,  fractures,  and  mortality 
in patients with dementia. It aims to address the knowl-
edge  gap  by  providing  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  how 
different antidepressant classes, drugs, and doses impact 
dementia progression, and whether factors like dementia 
subtypes, severity, and medications modify these effects. 
The  findings  may  inform  clinical  care  and  contribute  to 
future research, providing insights for primary care prac-
titioners and specialists involved in dementia healthcare.

Methods
Study design and data source

Based  on  nationwide  Swedish  registers,  we  conducted 
a  population-based  cohort  study  between  May  1,  2007, 
and  October  16,  2018.  Using  the  Swedish  Registry  for 
Cognitive/Dementia  Disorders  (SveDem),  we  identified 
patients  with  incident  diagnosed  dementia.  SveDem  is 
a  quality  registry  established  in  2007  aiming  to  register 
and follow-up all patients with incident dementia in Swe-
den.  SveDem  includes  patients  with  incident  dementia 
diagnosis from either primary care or specialist memory 
clinics and contains information on demographics, diag-
nostic  process,  and  cognitive  and  mortality  outcomes. 
For  this  study,  we  used  the  type  of  dementia,  cognitive 
evaluation by MMSE, coresident status, and type of diag-
nostic unit from SveDem [25]. The National Patient Reg-
ister contains nationwide records on inpatient care since 
1987  and  more  than  80%  of  specialized  (hospital-based)

outpatient care since 2001 [26]. The Swedish Prescribed 
Drug Register provides complete data on dispensation of 
prescription  medications  from  all  pharmacies  since  July 
2005 [27]. The Cause of Death Registry contains data on 
overall and specific mortality and dates of death [28]. The 
Swedish  unique  personal  identity  number  was  used  to 
identify patients across sources and to merge data.

Study population

The  study  population  included  patients  with  incident 
dementia  registered  in  SveDem  between  May  1,  2007, 
and  October  16,  2018.  We  defined  index  date  as  the 
date of the dementia diagnosis in SveDem. We excluded 
patients if any of the following applied: missing informa-
tion on MMSE score at baseline; a record of antidepres-
sant dispensation prior to the 6-month period before the 
date  of  dementia  diagnosis  or  no  follow-ups.  To  permit 
comparisons  between  drugs,  we  also  excluded  patients 
who  received  prescriptions  for  different  antidepressants 
within  a  class  or  antidepressants  from  different  classes 
in the same 6-month period. Additional file 1: Figure S1 
presents a flowchart for the selection of participants.

Dementia  disorders  are  clinically  diagnosed  and 
recorded  according  to  the  International  Classification 
of  Diseases,  Tenth  Revision  (ICD-10)  codes  [29],  with 
the  McKeith  criteria  [30]  used  for  DLB,  the  Lund-Man-
chester  criteria  [31]  for  FTD,  and  the  Movement  Disor-
der Society Task Force criteria [32] for PDD, respectively 
(Additional  file  2:  Table  S1).  Dementia  was  defined  at 
the time of the establishment of the dementia diagnosis, 
coded  as  AD,  mixed  dementia,  VaD,  DLB,  FTD,  PDD, 
and other dementias, which included unspecified demen-
tia  and  other  dementia  types  not  classified  above.  DLB 
and  PDD  share  pathological  and  clinical  characteristics, 
are considered part of a continuum within the spectrum 
of LBD [33, 34], and were therefore merged for this study 
as LBDs.

Antidepressant exposure

We treated antidepressant use as a time varying exposure 
and defined it as a dispensation of medication during the 
6  months  leading  up  to  the  dementia  diagnosis  or  each 
subsequent follow-up date through the Prescribed Drug 
Register by ATC codes (Additional file 2: Table S2). This 
is followed by grouping of antidepressant drugs into five 
classes  according  to  the  mode  of  action:  SSRIs,  SNRIs, 
TCAs, and other antidepressants.

We extracted information on the dose of each dispen-
sation  of  antidepressants  within  the  6-month  period 
preceding  each  SveDem  entry  date  or  each  subsequent 
follow-up  date.  Cumulative  doses  dispensed  during 
these time periods were expressed as number of defined 
daily doses (DDD) in each package or dispensation. The 

DDD for each medication is defined by the World Health 
Organization  [35]  and  was  used  to  allow  dose  compari-
sons between different medications. When multiple dis-
pensations were used, their DDD were added [36].

Outcomes

The  main  outcome  for  this  study  was  cognitive  decline, 
defined as MMSE score change over the years. Informa-
tion  of  baseline  and  follow-up  MMSE  scores  were  col-
lected  from  SveDem.  The  secondary  outcomes  included 
severe  dementia,  fracture,  and  death.  Severe  dementia 
was  specifically  defined  as  MMSE  score < 10  during  fol-
low-up  [37].  Information  of  death  from  all  causes  was 
extracted  from  the  Cause  of  Death  Registry  based  on 
ICD-10  codes.  Data  on  fractures,  defined  as  any  frac-
tures  occurring  at  skeletal  sites  during  follow-up,  were 
extracted  from  the  National  Patient  Register  and  Cause 
of Death Registry by using the ICD-10 codes (Additional 
file 2: Table S3). Patients were observed from index date 
through October 16, 2018, for any secondary outcomes.

Covariates

We  defined  covariates  at  the  index  date,  including  age, 
sex, coresident status, type of diagnostic unit, and calen-
dar year of diagnosis. We used ICD-10 codes to identify 
common and major physical disorders diagnosed within 
3  years  before  the  date  of  dementia  diagnosis  from  the 
National Patient Register (Additional file 2: Table S3). We 
used  the  Charlson  Comorbidity  Index  score  [38]  (CCIs) 
to assess medical comorbidities, using a weighted sum of 
diagnosed  chronic  disorders  [39]  but  excluding  demen-
tia. In addition, we also included depression and fracture 
diagnosed  within  3  years  before  the  date  of  dementia 
diagnosis (Additional file 2: Table S3).

Data  on  medications  were  ascertained  by  ATC  codes 
and  defined  as  the  presence  of  filled  pharmacy  pre-
scriptions  within  the  6  months  prior  to  and  at  the  date 
of  dementia  diagnosis,  including  angiotensin-convert-
ing  enzyme  inhibitors/angiotensin  receptor  blockers, 
β-blocking  agents,  calcium  channel  blockers,  nonsteroi-
dal  anti-inflammatory  drugs,  diuretics,  lipid-modifying 
agents,  antiplatelets,  antipsychotics,  anxiolytics,  and 
hypnotics  (Additional  file  2:  Table  S4).  Anti-dementia 
medications  (i.e.,  cholinesterase  inhibitors  [ChEIs]  and 
memantine) use was defined as a dispensation of medica-
tion during the 6 months after dementia diagnosis (Addi-
tional file 2: Table S4).

Statistical analysis

We  used  linear  mixed  models  to  examine  the  associa-
tions  between  the  use  of  antidepressants  and  cognitive 
decline (MMSE score change) over the years. We treated 
antidepressant use as a time varying exposure to account 

 Mo et al. BMC Medicine           (2025) 23:82

for  patients  stopping  treatment  and  changing  between 
treatments  during  follow-up.  We  considered  patients  to 
be exposed to treatment if no gaps of more than 90 days 
existed between the end of one prescription and the start 
of the next. Follow-up time was treated as a continuous 
measure defined as years since first cognitive assessment. 
The  model  included  antidepressant  use  and  follow-up 
time and an interaction between drug use and time. Fol-
lowing our previous work in SveDem [36], a linear trend 
over time was assumed and the model allowed for a ran-
dom  intercept  and  random  slope  for  each  patient.  We 
also included the inverse probability of censoring weight-
ing considering the potential effects of dropout or to the 
presence of a competing risk before the end of follow-up 
such as death [40].

In addition to examining any dementias, we separately 
examined  the  effects  for  different  subtypes  of  dementia 
(AD  and  mixed,  VaD,  LBD,  FTD,  and  other  dementias). 
The  beta  coefficients  (β)  and  95%  confidence  intervals 
(CIs)  were  obtained  from  adjusted  models  including 
age,  sex,  calendar  year  of  dementia  diagnosis,  the  type 
of  dementia,  MMSE  score  at  diagnosis,  coresident  sta-
tus,  type  of  diagnostic  unit,  depression,  fracture,  CCIs, 
and medications. For patients diagnosed with AD, mixed 
dementia,  and  LBD,  we  further  adjusted  for  ChEIs  and 
memantine.

The analysis was initially conducted for any antidepres-
sant,  followed  by  each  class  of  antidepressants  (SSRIs, 
SNRIs,  TCAs,  and  other  antidepressants)  compared 
with  no  current  treatment.  We  compared  use  of  indi-
vidual  antidepressant  drugs  with  no  current  treatment 
when  numbers  were  sufficient.  In  addition,  different 
antidepressant classes and individual drugs were directly 
compared.  We  investigated  the  impact  of  antidepres-
sant dosage by examining it as a continuous variable and 
categorizing it into three groups within each class (≤ 0.5 
DDD, > 0.5/ ≤ 1.0  DDD, > 1.0DDD).  Given  that  94.8%  of 
patients  prescribed  TCAs  were  using  a  low  dose  (≤ 0.5 
DDD) (Additional file 2: Table S5), the analysis compar-
ing  SSRIs  and  TCAs,  specifically  citalopram  (SSRI)  and 
amitriptyline (TCA), was performed within the low-dose 
group (≤ 0.5 DDD).

We  did  subgroup  analysis  to  explore  the  poten-
tial  effects  of  age  (median < 78, ≥ 78  years),  sex  (male/
female),  coresident  status  (cohabiting  or  living  alone), 
type  of  diagnostic  unit  (specialist  care  or  primary 
care),  living  in  nursing  home,  calendar  year  of  diag-
nosis  (2007–2012,  2013–2018),  baseline  MMSE  score 
(0–9,  10–19,  20–24,  25–30)  and  current  use  of  antip-
sychotics,  anxiolytics  and  hypnotics,  on  the  associa-
tion between antidepressant use and cognitive decline. 
Interaction tests between these factors and antidepres-
sant  use  were  conducted  separately  to  assess  possible 

modifying effects. For patients diagnosed with AD and 
mixed dementia, and LBD, we also conducted stratified 
analysis by current use of ChEIs and memantine.

We estimated crude incidence rates per 1000 person-
years  for  fracture  and  all-cause  death  in  all  patients  at 
the  end  of  follow-up,  and  severe  dementia  in  patients 
who  had  baseline  MMSE  score > 10.  We  used  time-
to 
dependent  Cox  proportional  hazards  models 
estimate the associations between time-varying antide-
pressants and each outcome and calculated the hazard 
ratios  (HRs)  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs).  We 
used  time  since  cohort  entry  as  the  underlying  time-
scale.  Considering  the  high  mortality  of  patients  with 
dementia  after  diagnosis,  we  applied  a  competing  risk 
model for outcomes of severe dementia and fracture.

Since depression itself has been linked with dementia 
and cognitive impairment [41,  42], we did a sensitivity 
analysis  among  patients  without  depression  to  reduce 
the indication bias. Furthermore, to avoid floor effects, 
we  did  a  sensitivity  analysis  among  patients  with 
MMSE ≥ 10 and without depression, excluding patients 
with baseline severe dementia.

Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version 
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R 4.2.1, with sta-
tistical tests using a 2-tailed P < 0.05 as the level of sta-
tistical significance.

Results
Patient characteristics

In  total,  18,740  patients  were  included  in  this  cohort 
study, 10,205 (54.5%) were women. The mean (SD) age 
and  MMSE  score  at  baseline  were  78.2  (7.4)  years  and 
22.1 (4.3), respectively (Additional file 2: Table S6). The 
total  number  of  person-years  of  follow-up  was  80,737, 
with a mean (SD) of 4.3 (2.2) years per patient.

Patterns of antidepressant treatment

During  follow-up,  a  total  of  11,912  prescriptions  for 
antidepressants  were  issued,  4271  (22.8%)  patients 
received  at  least  one  prescription  for  an  antidepres-
sant.  SSRIs  were  the  most  commonly  prescribed  class, 
accounting for 64.8%, followed by TCAs (2.2%), SNRIs 
(2.0%),  and  the  group  of  other  antidepressants  (31.0%) 
(Additional  file  1:  Figure  S2  and  Additional  file  2: 
Table  S5).  The  six  most  commonly  prescribed  antide-
pressant drugs comprised 99.0% (n = 11 788) of all pre-
scriptions,  including  citalopram  (SSRI),  mirtazapine 
(other), sertraline (SSRI), escitalopram (SSRI), amitrip-
tyline  (TCA),  and  venlafaxine  (SNRI),  were  analyzed 
separately in some analysis.

Antidepressant and cognitive decline by antidepressant 
dose

Higher  dispensed  doses  of  antidepressants,  specifically 
for  SSRIs  and  the  group  of  other  antidepressants  were 
associated with faster cognitive decline during follow-up 
(Table 3 and Additional file 1: Figure S3). Similar results 
were  observed  in  sensitivity  analysis  among  patients 
diagnosed  with  AD  and  mixed  dementia,  patients  with-
out  depression  or  patients  with  baseline  MMSE ≥ 10 
and without depression (Additional file 1: Figure S3 and 
Additional file 2: Table S7-S10).

Subgroup analysis of antidepressant and cognitive decline 
by dementia subtypes

Subgroup  analysis  of  the  associations  between  anti-
depressants  and  cognitive  decline  is  shown  in  Table  4. 
Compared  with  patients  who  were  women,  had  higher 
MMSE  score  at  baseline,  using  anxiolytics  and  hypnot-
ics,  the  effect  size  of  cognitive  decline  was  greater  in 
those who were men, had lower MMSE score, not using 
anxiolytics  or  hypnotics.  Modifying  effects  of  sex  and 
use of anxiolytics on the association between antidepres-
sant  use  and  cognitive  decline  were  observed  (P  for  inter-
action < 0.05).  A  slower  cognitive  decline  was  observed  in 
younger (< 78 years) patients with FTD (β = 1.61 points/
year; 95% CI, 0.05 to 3.17). Patients with the lowest initial 
MMSE  scores  (0–9)  exhibited  the  greatest  subsequent 
cognitive  decline  (β =  − 1.51  points/year;  95%  CI, − 2.82 
to − 0.20). Furthermore, the results were similar between 
users and non-users of ChEIs; among patients not using 
memantine,  compared  with  non-use,  antidepressant  use 
showed  faster  cognitive  decline  for  patients  diagnosed 
with  AD  and  mixed  dementia  (β =  − 0.30  points/year; 
95% CI, − 0.45 to − 0.15), and for LBD (β = − 0.85 points/
year; 95% CI, − 1.64 to − 0.06) (Additional file 1: Figure S4 
and  Additional  file  2:  Table  S11).  There  were  no  signifi-
cant differences between subgroups of coresident status, 
type of diagnostic unit, living in nursing home, calendar 
year  of  dementia  diagnosis,  and  current  use  of  antipsy-
chotics on cognitive decline.

patients with AD and mixed dementia (Additional file 2:

Discussion
In  this  nationwide  cohort  study,  we  found  that  the  cur-
rent  use  of  antidepressants  was  associated  with  faster 
cognitive  decline  in  patients  with  dementia  compared 
with non-use, and this association was driven mainly by 
patients with severe dementia. Higher dispensed doses of 
SSRIs  were  associated  with  more  cognitive  decline  dur-
ing  follow-up,  and  higher  risk  of  severe  dementia,  frac-
ture, and all-cause mortality.

Previous  studies  of  antidepressant  use  and  cognitive 
decline in people with dementia have shown mixed find-
ings.  Most  clinical  trials  reporting  the  effect  of  antide-
pressants  on  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  and  cognition, 
did  so  as  a  secondary  or  safety  outcome  [43,  44].  In  the 
majority  of  the  cases  reported,  antidepressants  had  the 
same  effect  on  cognition  as  placebo  [44–47],  but  some 
reported  a  significant  decline  on  the  MMSE  scores  in 
antidepressant  users  [43,  48].  Many  of  the  clinical  trials 
were too small to provide precise estimates of the mod-
erate  benefits  on  cognition  that  might  realistically  be 
expected [49]. A recently conducted RCT reported wors-
ening of cognition in patients with AD who used citalo-
pram  over  9  weeks  [43].  In  contrast,  other  RCTs  in  AD 
indicated that another two SSRIs, sertraline and escitalo-
pram, had no effect on cognitive function [49, 50]. Indi-
vidual antidepressants even within same class cannot be 
considered  identical  drugs.  Evidence  has  shown  some 
differences  regarding  the  speed  of  onset  of  response 
and adverse events among individual SSRIs [51]. Recent 
findings  demonstrated  that  specifically  sertraline,  escit-
alopram, and mirtazapine had relatively higher responses 
and lower dropout profile compared to other antidepres-
sants  [52].  These  differences  may  influence  medication 
choice  for  a  given  patient  and  may  show  varied  effect 
on  dementia  progression.  More  studies  are  needed  to 
explore  the  underlying  mechanisms,  optimal  timing  for

Our study showed significantly faster cognitive decline 
in  patients  with  SSRIs  (i.e.,  citalopram,  sertraline,  and 
escitalopram)  compared  to  non-use.  However,  the  mag-
nitude of the effect of citalopram (0.41 points/year), ser-
traline (0.25 points/year), and escitalopram (0.76 points/
year)  appears  to  be  lower  than  the  minimum  clinically 
significant change in MMSE score of 1–3 points [53]. A 
meta-analysis  that  included  15  RCTs  involving  a  total 
of  1616  patients  with  AD  found  that  second-generation 
antidepressants had no effect on global  cognition meas-
ured by MMSE, and this remained in subgroup analyses 
of  duration  of  medication,  drug  classes,  combination 
with anti-dementia medication, various NPS, and degree 
of  AD  [47].  However,  results  from  meta-analyses  may 
be  biased  without  adjustment  for  the  clinical  status  of 
patients  such  as  chronic  physical  disease  and  are  not 
quantitatively  assessed  since  most  of  the  trials  included 
used  flexible  doses  of  antidepressants.  Sertraline  and 
escitalopram  are  first  hand  choices  for  depression 
among  older  individuals  in  Sweden  [8].  However,  anti-
depressants do not seem to work as well in patients with 
dementia,  possibly  because  “depression  in  dementia  is  a 
different  illness”  than  depression  in  people  with  intact 
cognition [54]. Cognitive control dysfunction in demen-
tia  appears  to  decrease  the  effectiveness  of  some  SSRIs 
[9]. In our study, we found SSRIs were associated with a 

Evidence regarding the long-term effect of antidepres-
sants on cognitive decline in VaD is lacking. In previous 
open-label studies in patients with VaD [21], MMSE score 
increased  significantly  in  the  fluoxetine  (SSRI)  group 
but  not  in  the  control  group.  Another  study  conducted 
in  patients  with  vascular  cognitive  impairment  without 
dementia [55] found that, compared with controls, fluox-
etine  (SSRI)  was  associated  with  better  performance  on

tive functioning and greater ability to understand spatial 
relationships, plan, and execute tasks, but no significant 
differences in change of Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment 
Scale  cognitive  subscale  score.  In  this  study,  we  found 
that antidepressant use was associated with a significant 
decline  in  cognition  in  patients  with  VaD  compared  to 
non-use. Furthermore, we also observed a slower cogni-
tive decline in younger (< 78 years) patients with FTD. In 
line with our observation, Laura et al. [56] found that cit-
alopram can partially restore the dysfunctional prefrontal 
cortical  systems  by  increasing  serotonergic  neurotrans-
mission in FTD. Future long-term studies are warranted 
to validate our findings.

the association between antidepressant use and cognitive 
decline was not modified by use of ChEIs but was worse 
in  non-users  of  memantine.  In  a  RCT  (n = 95)  among 
older  adults  with  major  depression  and  memory  com-
plains,  a  combination  of  memantine  and  escitalopram 
significantly improved delayed recall and executive func-
tioning  at  12  months  [58].  However,  the  differences  in 

specific  antidepressants  or  anti-dementia  drugs,  sample 
size, and cognitive function at baseline might be the main 
reason related to the heterogeneity between studies.

Population-based  cohort  studies  have  found  that 
antidepressant  use  was  related  to  no  or  lower  risks  of 
all-cause  mortality  in  patients  with  dementia  [59,  60], 
but  increased  risk  of  fracture  [61,  62].  In  our  study,  we 

 Mo et al. BMC Medicine           (2025) 23:82

found that SSRIs were associated with increased risks of 
all-cause  mortality  and  fracture  compared  with  no  cur-
rent  treatment.  Thus,  careful  and  regular  monitoring  is 
needed to assess the risks and benefits of different antide-
pressants and decrease the risk of adverse events.

This  study  has  several  strengths,  including  a  large 
nationally  representative  cohort  of  individuals  with 
dementia, long follow-up assessments, and a range of dif-
ferent types of dementia. In addition, demographic char-
acteristics, medical disorders, and characteristics related 
to dementia were also explored. To our knowledge, this is 
the first systematic assessment of the long-term effects of 
commonly used antidepressants on cognition in patients 
with  dementia.  Our  medication  exposure  was  time-
dependent,  taking  into  account  the  change  in  prescrib-
ing patterns that occur after dementia diagnosis and thus 
more  accurately  reflective  of  medication  use  at  the  time 
of  event.  Furthermore,  we  had  detailed  information  on 
prescriptions for antidepressants throughout the follow-
up period, so we could do comprehensive analyses inves-
tigating effects of individual drugs and dose.

This  study  has  limitations.  The  main  concern  is  indi-
cation  bias,  which  occurs  when  patients  are  prescribed 
drugs  for  a  condition  that  is  itself  associated  with  the 
outcome  of  interest.  Depression  has  been  linked  with 
dementia  and  cognitive  impairment  in  normal  people 
with  depression  [41,  42],  which  means  that  the  associa-
tions with antidepressants may be due to depression for 
which it was prescribed rather than to the drug itself. To 
reduce  this  bias,  we  repeated  and  restricted  our  main 
analysis to include only patients without depression and 
found  consistent  results.  In  addition,  in  this  study  only 
patients  who  were  new  users  of  antidepressants  were 
included, previous users of antidepressants with depres-
sion  were  not  included.  However,  the  clinical  diagnosis 
of  depression  was  obtained  through  specialized  in-  and 
out-patient care, which primarily represents more severe 
manifestations:  less  severe  depression  is  generally  man-
aged through primary care and would have been missed. 
And  there  is  an  overlap  in  symptoms  between  depres-
sion  and  dementia,  making  diagnosing  depression  par-
ticularly  challenging  in  these  cases.  Furthermore,  we 
did  not  have  information  on  the  severity  of  depression 
and  actual  intake  of  antidepressants,  only  dispensation. 
Residual confounding due to lack of diagnosis of depres-
sion  in  dementia  would  thus  reduce  the  differences 
between antidepressants users and non-users since more 
individuals are likely to end up erroneously in the group 
of  non-users.  However,  many  patients  with  demen-
tia  seem  to  have  received  antidepressant  medications 
for  other  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  as  the  sensitivity 
analyses  among  non-depressed  patients  did  not  change 
the  results.  But  the  direct  comparisons  among  treated 

groups  exhibit  reduced  susceptibility  to  confounding  by 
indication  or  factors  influencing  treatment  prescription. 
Second,  although  direct  comparisons  between  antide-
pressant  classes  or  drugs  could  to  some  extent  reduce 
the  influence  of  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  they  may 
still be influenced by channeling bias. This bias can occur 
when  distinct  antidepressant  drugs  with  similar  indi-
cations  are  prescribed  based  on  varying  patient  char-
acteristics  [52].  Third,  the  severity  of  dementia  could 
independently  contribute  to  cognitive  decline,  making 
it  difficult  to  definitively  attribute  the  observed  effects 
solely  to  antidepressant  use.  However,  we  observed 
antidepressant  use  was  associated  with  faster  cognitive 
decline in patients with different MMSE scores at demen-
tia  diagnosis,  though  the  effect  size  of  cognitive  decline 
was  greater  in  patients  with  lower  MMSE  score.  Future 
research is needed to further elucidate the complex inter-
play  between  antidepressant  use,  dementia  severity,  and 
cognitive  decline.  Fourth,  SveDem  is  a  real-world  data-
base, which suffers from significant patient loss to follow-
up. In this study, we calculated and adjusted the inverse 
probability of censoring weighting to address the issue of 
selective dropouts. Furthermore, the national coverage of 
SveDem for new dementia cases is not absolute, it covers 
100%  of  memory  clinics  and  75%  of  primary  care  units, 
and almost one-third of all expected new dementia cases 
in Sweden [63, 64]. Thus, the generalizability of our find-
ings to other populations remains to be studied. However, 
the dementia diagnostic workup follows standard clinical 
practice, and few patients have a changed dementia diag-
nosis  at  follow-up,  which  suggests  adequate  diagnostic 
accuracy  [65].  Lastly,  some  of  the  analyses  were  impre-
cisely estimated due to the small number of patients with 
some individual antidepressants and in stratified analysis.

Conclusions
In  this  cohort  study,  use  of  antidepressants  was  associ-
ated with faster cognitive decline in patients with demen-
tia,  in  particular  SSRIs  (i.e.,  citalopram,  sertraline  and 
escitalopram)  and  mirtazapine.  These  effects  appeared 
to  be  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  more  severe 
dementia.  Compared  with  sertraline,  escitalopram  pre-
sented  faster  cognitive  decline,  while  citalopram  was 
linked to a slower cognitive decline. Additionally, higher 
dispensed  doses  of  SSRIs  were  associated  with  greater 
cognitive  decline,  as  well  as  increased  risks  of  severe 
dementia,  all-cause  mortality,  and  fracture.  Our  study 
cannot distinguish whether these findings are due to the 
antidepressants or the underlying psychiatric indication.
