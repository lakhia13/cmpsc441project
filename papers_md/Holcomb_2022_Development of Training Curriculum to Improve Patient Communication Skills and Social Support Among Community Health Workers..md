ABSTRACT

Background: Effective provider communication skills are important for patient decision-making and under-
standing, particularly for those with low health literacy. A gap exists in training methods and curriculum for 
community health workers (CHWs). Brief description of activity: Through a clinical and academic partner-
ship,  pilot  training  curriculum  focused  on  patient  communication  skills  was  developed  to  align  with  CHW 
scope  of  work.  Implementation: The  curriculum  was  implemented  in  three  2-hour  training  sessions  over 
WebEx with seven state-certified CHWs. The goal was for CHWs to understand the key elements and applica-
tion of active listening, Teach Back, and action planning in a clinical setting. The sessions included didactic and 
skills practice modules for each skill. Results: A survey was distributed to CHWs to evaluate knowledge, skills, 
and attitudes and reactions to training methods, instructors, and relevance using the Kirkpatrick’s evaluation 
model  (Reaction  and  Learning).  Although  CHWs  agreed  that  they  had  actively  participated  in  the  training 
and that the instructors were well-prepared, there was less agreement that the course was relevant. CHWs 
reported an increase in understanding of active listening and action planning, capability of using Teach Back 
and providing social support, and ability to teach, whereas a decrease was reported in the capability to use 
action planning. When probed about training relevance, CHWs felt action listening and Teach Back were rel-
evant, but that action planning was not relevant to their responsibilities. This gap in responsibilities was also 
acknowledged by the clinical leadership. Lessons learned: The training allowed the CHWs to build on sub-
sequent skills from previous sessions and to discuss struggles. A need for tools for integrating the skills in 
the clinical workflow were requested by CHWs and clinical leadership. These tools offer the opportunity to 
tailor future trainings on communication skills or patient scenarios. Future trainings should include CHWs to 
provide insight into scope of work. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2022;6(2):e142–e150.]

Plain Language Summary: It is important for community health workers to communicate with patients so 
that patients can understand information and make their own decisions. There is not enough known about 
the best way to train CHWs in patient communication. This training was created to help CHWs use three pa-
tient communication skills in their clinic. 

Effective  communication  skills  are  necessary  for  health 
care  providers  to  positively  affect  patient  health.  Providers 
can share information, but the patient must comprehend and 
retain the information as well. Almost one-half of adults in 
the  United  States  have  trouble  understanding  and  applying 
health  information  (Nielsen-Bohlman  et  al.,  2004).  People 
with low health literacy have less understanding of medica-
tion  regimens,  disease  processes,  and  methods  for  disease 
management (Cavanaugh et al., 2008; Neter & Brainin, 2019; 

Sarkar  et  al.,  2015).  Given  this,  health  literacy  has  become 
a priority for providers. However, providers might not have 
awareness  of  the  patient’s  literacy  level  or  be  able  to  assess 
health literacy in a clinical setting. Providers have also been 
shown to overestimate patients’ health literacy and therefore 
miss  opportunities  to  appropriately  connect  with  their  pa-
tients  (Voigt-Barbarowicz  &  Brütt,  2020).  A  universal  pre-
cautions approach to health literacy through patient commu-
nication has shown to be effective for patients with varying

levels  of  health  literacy  (Cifuentes  et  al.,  2015;  Glick  et  al., 
2020). Communication skills such as active listening, Teach 
Back, and action planning help providers communicate more 
effectively with patients. Active listening calls for providers to 
pay close attention to the speaker by focusing on what they 
say and how they say it (Colton et al., 2006). Kaphingst el al. 
(2014)  found  that  engaging  with  patients  and  asking  them 
questions led to an increase in self-reported patient decision-
making after a health care visit. In Teach Back, a provider asks 
the patient to repeat back the information that was covered 
to check for understanding (Anderson et al., 2020; Caplin & 
Saunders, 2015). An action plan consists of short, easy steps 
for patients to complete to achieve their health-related goals. 
Creation of a patient action plan has been shown to improve 
patient  outcomes  for  a  variety  of  health  conditions  includ-
ing  diabetes,  weight  management,  asthma,  and  depression 
(Mauksch & Safford, 2013).

There are varied published methods available for training 
health care providers in patient communication skills, includ-
ing  didactic  sessions,  modeling,  role  playing,  instructional 
videos, and informational hand-outs (Anderson et al., 2020; 
Cifuentes  et  al.,  2015;  Kornburger  et  al.,  2013;  Mahramus 
et al., 2014; Morony et al., 2018). One method has not been 
found to be more effective. The literature is currently lacking 
data on which training methods might work best for nonclin-
ical providers, such as community health workers (CHWs). 

Previous trainings have been tailored for an advanced degree 
(e.g.,  Physicians,  Nurse  Practitioners)  or  clinical  provider 
audiences  (e.g.,  Medical  Assistants,  Nurses).  CHWs  have  a 
unique  set  of  core  competencies  to  improve  patient  under-
standing  and  social  support,  to  promote  healthy  behaviors 
in  health  literacy  interventions,  and  to  facilitate  discharge 
follow-up (Han et al., 2017; Kangovi et al., 2014; Rosenthal et 
al., 2018). During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic, CHWs have been indispensable in contact tracing 
and public health messaging (Rosenthal et al., 2020). As more 
patients experienced unemployment, food insecurity and so-
cial isolation, providing support and follow-up care became 
more important. An opportunity existed to develop patient 
communication training curriculum to align with CHW core 
competencies and scope of work. To address the gap in train-
ing  methods  and  curriculum,  a  didactic  and  skill  building 
pilot training was implemented. The curriculum focused on 
communication skills needed to address patient needs and to 
provide effective social support in a clinical setting. To assess 
implementation, a mixed-method evaluation was conducted. 

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The training was a project between an academic health in-
stitution and the clinical practice arm focused on preventing 
hospital readmissions. The academic partners had expertise

and community-based trainings with CHWs. The academic 
partner included a faculty member, two staff members, and a 
graduate assistant. The clinical partner, the outpatient clini-
cal practice plan, conducts ongoing population health inter-
ventions  and  practice  improvement  activities.  The  clinical 
partner  included  a  Director  of  Population  Health  and  two 
CHW  coordinators.  A  total  of  seven  state-certified  CHWs 
who  had  worked  for  the  clinical  partner  for  at  least  1  year 
and  had  been  identified  as  future  co-trainers  attended  the 
training  The  CHWs  served  patients  who  were  uninsured, 
refugees, recently discharged, high-acuity utilizers, and those 
with a high-risk pregnancy, diabetes, and sickle cell disease. 
The responsibilities of CHWs included discharge follow-up, 
appointment scheduling, and navigation to resources such as 
food,  maternity  care,  and  financial  prescription  assistance. 
The training was deemed quality improvement and did not 
need Institutional Review Board approval.

CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT

A  collaborative  approach  was  used  to  identify  training 
content.  In  May  2020,  a  pilot  Teach-Back  training  with  the 
same seven CHWs was delivered (Holcomb et al., 2022, un-
published). A need to reinforce Teach Back alongside devel-
oping additional patient communication and social support 
skills  was  identified.  Few,  if  any,  CHW  curricula  focused 
on  social  support  skills  could  be  identified.  We  did,  how-
ever,  identify  evidence  suggesting  that  social  support  pro-
vided  by  CHWs  was  an  effective  component  in  improving 
health  (Taylor  et  al.,  2019).  Taylor  et  al.  (2019)  proposed  a 
framework  for  understanding  CHW-mediated  health  im-
provement  through  assessing  social  support  needs;  provid-
ing  appropriate  informational,  appraisal,  instrumental,  and 
emotional  social  support;  and  engaging  with  patients.  The 
framework  was  connected  to  patient  communication  skills 
identified in literature. The clinical partner team chose active 
listening, Teach Back and action planning for focus. After re-
viewing the literature and existing curricula, a four-step cycle 
with each skill was created to align with CHW scope of work. 
The  training  addressed  pre–COVID-19  standard  of  care 
and  the  most  pressing  needs  of  the  clinic  population  dur-
ing  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  As  patients  were  hesitant  to 
attend clinic appointments, CHWs spent increased time on 
the phone with patients discussing COVID-19. Screening pa-
tients for social needs and navigating them to resources was 
the standard of care for CHWs before COVID-19. However, 
given the effect of the pandemic on employment, social re-
lationships, and communities, CHWs spent time addressing 
the needs of patients in socially isolated settings. An opportu-
nity was identified for CHWs to use communication skills to 

provide  informational,  appraisal,  and  instrumental  support 
through  community  resource  referrals,  in  addition  to,  ex-
planations about vaccines and testing, dispelling COVID-19 
myths,  and  tangible  incentives  to  keep  appointments  (e.g., 
distribution  of  emergency  food  boxes).  Across  these  activi-
ties, CHWs could also provide emotional support (i.e., em-
pathy) to patients.

Active Listening

The goal of active listening is to understand patient con-
cerns  and  to  show  understanding  of  a  patient’s  experience. 
The  four-step  cycle  created  included  (1)  Ask,  (2)  Reflect, 
(3)  Affirm,  and  (4)  Rephrase  (Colton  et  al.,  2006;  Laurenzi 
et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2013). First, the CHW asks open-
ended questions so the patient can explain in detail what they 
are  thinking  and  feeling.  Open-ended  questions  are  used 
throughout the steps, but they are an essential in gathering 
information.  The  CHW  uses  verbal  acknowledgments  like 
“Tell  me  more  about.  .  .”  to  assure  the  patient  they  are  lis-
tening. The CHW reflects on the patient’s message, feelings, 
and verbal and nonverbal cues to gain a deeper understand-
ing. The CHW must integrate the patient’s message, feelings, 
and/or behaviors through verbal prompts. The CHW affirms 
the patient’s self-efficacy, abilities, and current efforts through 
affirming statements like, “It seems like you are really good 
at. . .” Lastly, the CHW rephrases or summarizes the patient’s 
message  in  their  own  words.  Paraphrasing  starters  such  as 
“Let  me  see  if  I  understand  you.  .  .”  are  used  to  clarify  the 
message and place the responsibility of understanding on the 
CHW. 

Teach Back 

Teach  Back  is  method  to  educate  the  patient  with  the 
necessary  information  and  confirm  their  understanding  by 
asking  them  to  repeat  the  information  in  their  own  words. 
Although an operational term for Teach Back is not always 
reported, the four-step cycle included (1) Explain, (2) Teach 
Back, (3) Assess, and (4) Repeat (Anderson et al., 2020; Cap-
lin & Saunders, 2015; Prochnow et al., 2019). The CHW ex-
plains the information to the patient in short, plain language 
statements without medical jargon. Next, the CHW asks the 
patient to Teach Back by repeating the information in their 
own  words  to  check  for  understanding. The  CHW  assesses 
patient understanding through verbal probes to put respon-
sibility on the CHW, for example: “Can you please explain it 
back to me so I can be sure I explained everything clearly?” 
A CHW can “chunk and check” to assess patient understand-
ing. A CHW breaks down the main points of the information 
into two to three smaller “chunks” or concepts. The CHWs 

e144

reviews the first “chunk” with the patient and assesses un-
derstanding through verbal prompts and asking questions. 
Once the patient expresses understanding, the CHW moves 
to the next “chunk.” The patient is ultimately asked to repeat 
back the “chunks” in a grouped meaningful way.

Action Plan

Action  planning  is  a  key  tool  for  effective  patient  self-
management (Lenzen et al., 2017). Action plans have been 
hypothesized  to  address  self-management  of  medical,  so-
cial,  and  emotional  needs.  Regardless  of  foci,  provider 
training  is  critical  as  they  work  with  patients  to  identify 
goals and actions to improve their health. Although there is 
not a standard set of essential elements for action planning 
in  the  literature,  studies  to  date  have  applied  steps  across 
patient self-assessment of a focal area for goal development, 
formulation of goals and an action plan, strategies for cop-
ing (e.g., addressing barriers), and follow up (Lenzen et al., 
2017). The four-step cycle included (1) Ask, (2) Brainstorm, 
(3) Assess, and (4) Create. First, the CHW uses open-ended 
questions and applies the skills learned from active listening 
to engage the patient. The CHW works with the patient to 
brainstorm a list of potential goals and to identify the goal 
the patient wants to work on, and feels is attainable through 
small steps. Next, the CHW uses a confidence question and 
scale to assess readiness. They use open-ended questions to 
assess  barriers  to  goal  achievement.  Lastly,  the  CHW  and 
patient  create  a  follow-up  plan  that  includes  a  date,  time, 
and mode (e.g., telephone, in person) for reconnecting.

CURRICULUM DESIGN

Adult  learning  theories  and  practices  including  forma-
tive  assessment,  active  learning,  problem-based  learning, 
and  multiple  learning  styles  were  adopted  (Bryan  et  al., 
2009;  Knowles,  1984).  Adult  learning  principles  focused 
on  actively  engaging  the  learner,  interactive  methodolo-
gies,  and  skill-building  exercises  have  been  used  in  previ-
ous  instruction  design  and  training  with  CHWs  (Nebeker 
&  López-Arenas,  2016;  Ruiz  et  al.,  2012;  St  John  et  al., 
2015). The CHWs were presented information in multiple 
strategies  through  instructional  online  video,  “in  person” 
(WebEx)  instruction,  written  material  (PowerPoint  pre-
sentation  and  skill  checklists),  interactive  practice  activi-
ties,  and  observation  of  the  training  team  and  their  peers 
role-playing patient scenarios. A formative assessment and 
problem-solving opportunities were provided in the home-
work activity. Adult learning literature suggests that learn-
ing is effective if the information presented is contextually 
relevant and recognizable (Bryan et al., 2009). The clinical 

team provided input on clinical workflow to inform practice 
activities and role-playing scenarios.

Implementation

The  curriculum  was  delivered  in  three  training  sessions 
over WebEx video conference. The training was originally in-
tended to be delivered in-person; however, due to in-person 
restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, implemen-
tation was shifted to WebEx. Each session was developed to 
be a 1-hour didactic information and a 1-hour skills practice 
module. 

Active Listening

We expected to implement a 1-hour didactic and 1-hour 
skills module but shifted to one 2-hour module focused on 
practicing  each  step  (Ask,  Reflect,  Affirm,  Rephrase).  We 
were able to role-play multiple scenario-based conversations 
to reinforce the didactics. The session began with an exercise 
for CHWs to describe in-person and phone conversations in 
which they felt someone listened to them. We led a discus-
sion on how they knew someone was (or was not) listening 
and the effect on the conversation. We then introduced ac-
tive  listening  steps,  techniques,  and  verbal  statements.  An 
example of each step was presented in a scenario reflecting 
the CHW scope of work. The CHWs practiced active listen-
ing steps in a similar scenario. The CHWs were asked to in-
corporate previous steps in subsequent practice activities. For 
example, to practice affirming patients, we asked CHWs how 
they would incorporate open-ended questions and reflect on 
a patient’s message, feelings, and behavior. The training team 
role-played  three  scenario-based  conversations  combin-
ing both active listening ideal techniques and mistakes. The 
CHWs used checklists to evaluate the conversations and to 
discuss opportunities for improvement. We had planned to 
include 1-hour for skills practice but shifted the practice to 
homework for the CHWs to incorporate all the steps of active 
listening. We were unable to complete the 1-hour skills prac-
tice within the session as additional time was spent reviewing 
each step of active listening. In the homework, CHWs wrote 
a conversation reflecting how to best use active listening with 
a patient.

Teach Back

As  planned,  we  delivered  a  2-hour  session  across  two 
modules. The first 1 hour consisted of a review didactic ses-
sion followed by another 1 hour of discussion and skills prac-
tice (CHWs  had been  introduced to Teach Back  [Holcomb 
et  al.,  2022,  unpublished]).  We  started  the  session  with  a 
discussion  and  exercise  demonstrating  the  importance  of 

HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice • Vol. 6, No. 2, 2022

Teach  Back.  CHWs  were  asked  how  about  experiences  re-
ceiving  instructions  from  an  automobile  repair  company. 
The  challenges  identified  in  the  exercise  were  aligned  with 
the challenges in communicating information with patients. 
We  presented  the  four  steps  of  Teach  Back  (Explain,  Teach 
Back, Assess, Repeat), and techniques on how best to explain 
information to patients (e.g., using plain language). We then 
reviewed examples of verbal prompts to use when asking a 
patient to Teach Back and open-ended questions to assess the 
patient’s understanding. We discussed using these examples 
to repeat or rephrase the information. Next, the training team 
role-played a scenario-based scripted conversation combin-
ing active listening with Teach-Back techniques. The CHWs 
assessed the use of the steps and techniques in the conversa-
tion and opportunities for improvement. Lastly, two CHWs 
were given similar case scenarios prior to the session to role 
play  with  a  partner  for  the  group  in  the  second  hour.  The 
other CHWs observed and critiqued how well both the ac-
tive listening and Teach-Back steps were integrated into the 
conversation. For homework, CHWs were encouraged to in-
tegrate these steps into patient interactions that week.

Action Plan

We  planned  to  deliver  a  1-hour  action  plan  module  fo-
cused on didactic content and a 1-hour action plan practice 
module while incorporating active listening and Teach-Back 
skills  from  previous  sessions.  In  addition  to  didactic  mate-
rial, role playing and patient scenarios were used to practice 
each step of action planning (Ask, Brainstorm, Assess, Cre-
ate). Before the session, the CHWs were asked to view a video 
which action planning implemented incorrectly followed by 
correct use of the steps. At the beginning of the session, the 
video was discussed. CHW experience with action planning 
was assessed at the beginning of the session and we discussed 
how action planning was implemented in person versus over 
the  phone  in  their  clinical  settings.  We  then  presented  the 
four-step action planning cycle. First, we reviewed active lis-
tening and asking open-ended questions with a specific fo-
cus on identifying patient areas for goal development. Then, 
we  reviewed  goal  development,  defined  SMART  (Specific, 
Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timebound) goals and ex-
plored strategies to brainstorm and prioritize goals with the 
patient. Third, we reviewed ways to assess patient confidence 
and barriers. A confidence scale was presented, and the ef-
fect of naming barriers reviewed. Finally, follow up strategies 
were reviewed and practiced, including specifying a day and 
time,  mode  for  follow  up  and  using  open-ended  questions 
and rephrasing to ensure understanding by both the CHW 
and patient. Lastly, the training team role-played a scenario-

based conversation with a patient combining both active lis-
tening and Teach Back with action planning steps. The CHWs 
listened to the conversation and discussed opportunities for 
improvement and benefits of applying the skills in the patient 
interaction.  During  the  discussion  of  the  action  planning 
video, it became evident that the CHWs’ role in the clinical 
practice was less focused on chronic disease management or 
medication adherence and more focused on patient social 
needs. We discussed how they would appreciate discussing 
patient conversation scenarios that more closely align with 
their scope of practice. Scenarios were adjusted to focus on 
topics like patient referral to community resources. 

RESULTS 
Pre–Post-Training Survey

An electronic survey was distributed to CHWs to evalu-
ate  two  levels  of  the  Kirkpatrick’s  Model  on  a  Likert-type 
scale  (Fernandes  et  al.,  2020)  (Table  1).  The  scale  had  five 
options from 5 - Strongly Agree to 1 - Strongly Disagree and a 
mean score was created. The pre-survey was sent 1 week be-
fore the training to evaluate knowledge, skills, and attitudes 
related to the training goals using level 2 of the Kirkpatrick’s 
Model  (Learning).  The  post-  survey  was  sent  after  the  last 
training  to  assess  level  2  in  addition  to  reactions  to  train-
ing methods, instructors, and course relevance in level 1 of 
the Kirkpatrick’s Model (Reaction). The level 1 and 2 results 
are outlined in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. All seven 
CHWs completed the survey. In level 1, although the CHWs 
reported  they  actively  participated  in  the  training  and  the 
instructors  were  well-prepared,  there  was  less  agreement 
that the course was relevant and the course and instructors 
were motivating. For level 2, a Wilcoxon sign-rank test were 
performed  with  pre-  and  post-survey  responses.  Only  one 
statistically significant change was detected (understanding 
of the Teach-Back protocol, p < .05) but descriptive changes 
were identified. An increase was seen in the understanding 
of  active  listening  and  action  planning,  capability  of  using 
Teach Back and providing social support, and ability to teach 
all three skills. A decrease was seen in capability to use ac-
tion planning and understanding patient communication as 
an important tool in a clinical setting and in effective social 
support. 

Debrief Meetings

The  training  team  facilitated  a  1-hour  debrief  meeting 
with  the  seven  CHWs  and  then  with  the  three  members 
of  the  clinical  leadership  team.  The  CHWs  felt  the  train-
ing  overall  was  useful  in  their  daily  work,  particularly  the 
role-playing  exercises  and  continued  skill  reinforcement.

both  levels  of  the  Kilpatrick’s  Model.  When  probed  about 
course relevance and motivation from level 1 (Reaction), the 
CHWs noted the active listening and Teach-Back skills were 
relevant to their work and they were motivated to use them. 
The disagreement in relevance of action planning and social 
support varied depending on the clinic setting and respon-
sibilities.  Some  CHWs  felt  this  skill  was  an  encroachment 
on  other  clinical  staff  responsibilities  (e.g.,  case  managers), 
whereas others involved in transitions of care felt it fit within 
their scope of work. The leadership noted action planning is 
a current gap in CHW responsibilities, but recent transitions 
of  care  initiatives  have  focused  on  patient  follow-up  over  a 
longer period. Similarly, the leadership discussed a need for 
tailoring training in new clinics while maintaining focus on 
the CHW core competencies of patient communication and 
social support. The goal is to trigger CHWs to use communi-
cation skills and provide social support no matter the patient 
through a universal approach to health literacy. CHWs com-
municate with all patients as if they have low health literacy 
rather than screening patients for literacy status. From level 2 
(Learning), CHWs noted social support had been interpreted 
as a clinical term (i.e., counseling). When discussed, CHWs 
felt they were able to offer social support in terms of offer-
ing empathy and understanding to patients. When discussing 
the decrease in the agreement for using action planning, one 
CHWs called it a “rude awakening.” She described misjudg-
ing her action planning skills: “. . .laughing at myself because 
I thought I was doing a great job before, but when I took this 
[course], I was like, maybe not. . .It showed me where I was 
not  as  strong  as  I  thought  I  was…”  Both  groups  expressed 
interest in tools to improve the use of the skills in the clinic. 
In addition, the leadership expressed the need to track skills 
through observation, checklists, and team meetings. Lastly, in

menting  the  Teach-Back  skills 
they  had  learned.  We  suspect 
Anderson et al.’s (2020) method 
of  providing  refresher  sessions 
several  months  after  the  initial 
training  to  the  CHWs  will  be 
needed as Teach Back is not the 
cultural  norm  for  the  CHW’s 
environment.  Until 
clinical 
Teach Back as well as active lis-
tening  and  action  planning  are 
universally  practiced  and  rein-
forced  by  leadership,  there  will 
be  the  risk  of  CHWs  slipping 
back to easier and faster modes 
of  conversation  with  patients. 
The  training  team  created  one-
page skill checklists to reinforce 
of skills during patient calls. The 
CHWs  noted  that  these  were 
helpful  in  their  initial  phone 
conversations  after  each  train-
ing,  although  additional  tools 
for  integrating  the  skills  in  the 
clinical  workflow  were  request-
ed  by  both  CHWs  and  clinical 
leadership.  The  tools  include 
phone call scripts, adapted skills 
checklist  like  those  used  in  the 
training,  and  action  planning 
templates. The tools provide an opportunity to identify gaps 
in skill development for quality improvement as a less bur-
densome method of skill reinforcement. The tools are com-
plementary to refresher trainings and can help tailor future 
trainings on certain skills or patient scenario examples. We 
were also not able to monitor the use of the skills after train-
ing  implementation  due  to  COVID-19  restrictions.  In  the 
debrief meetings, we heard from both groups that the skills 
were being integrated into patient calls, but we were not able 
to capture this in a standardized way. Increased monitoring 
and evaluation across multiple modes (e.g., observation ru-
bric, meeting discussions) is necessary to examine the inte-
gration of skills and the training effectiveness.

Opportunities for future training adaptations were iden-
tified.  The  sustainably  of  current  and  future  recommended 
trainings will rely on curriculum alignment with CHW scope 
of work (Anderson et al., 2020). The CHWs noted a need to 
update practice and role-playing scenarios to reflect a broad-
er scope of work. Although we were not able to monitor the

importance of incorporating the CHWs in the maintenance 
and tracking of skills as they provide feedback for training for 
the next cohort and participate as co-trainers. 

LESSONS LEARNED

Though the training was required to adapt to the changing 
health care environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
still employed many of the same educational techniques (e.g., 
presentations,  interactive  practice  activities,  scenario-based 
role-playing)  as  previous  studies.  Similar  to  Morony  et  al. 
(2018), we instituted a 2-hour Teach-Back session; however, 
instead of ongoing check in sessions with our CHWs regard-
ing Teach-Back proficiency after the initial session (Holcomb 
et al., 2022, unpublished), we continued to have 2-hour ses-
sions on communication techniques. Our additional sessions 
served as a method of allowing the CHWs to check in with 
the training team and their colleagues about struggles imple-

daily clinical workflow, we were able to receive input on cur-
riculum from clinic leadership. As in previous studies, tailor-
ing training practice activities, scenarios, and checklists were 
helpful.  (Anderson  et  al.,  2020;  Laurenzi  et  al.,  2020).  Al-
though beneficial, a need to include CHWs to better under-
stand daily clinical workflow and align course relevance was 
identified. We expect that including the CHWs as co-trainers 
in  the  next  training  cohort  will  help  better  reflect  scope  of 
work, particularly in the action planning session. In the next 
trainings, the CHWs will serve as role models to their peers 
by role playing scenarios to demonstrate the skills. This also 
allows an opportunity for skill development for those CHWs. 
In addition, while the CHWs reflected a range of clinic pop-
ulations  and  responsibilities,  all  were  state-certified  CHWs 
who met state training standards across a cohesive list of core 
competencies. However, the applicability of this curriculum 
extends  beyond  CHW  training  in  Texas  communities.  Al-
though  states  have  various  core  competencies  and  training 
standards, there is a growing consensus to standardize CHW 
core  competencies  (Rosenthal  et  al.,  2018).  Future  studies 
could examine the alignment of curriculum to state and na-
tional CHW core competencies to ensure consistency across 
training implementation.
