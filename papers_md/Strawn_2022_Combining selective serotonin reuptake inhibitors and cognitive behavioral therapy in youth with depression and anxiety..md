Abstract

Background: Treatment studies of children and adolescents with internalizing disorders suggest 
that the combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) consistently produces greater improvement than either treatment alone. We 
sought to determine how response to combined treatment varies across disorders (anxiety versus 
depression), and by specific patient characteristics.

Methods: Three large National Institutes of Health-funded trials of children and adolescents 
with major depression (n=2) and anxiety disorders (n=1) were evaluated, each comparing CBT + 
SSRI to SSRI only, Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHMs) were used, for endpoint response, time 
course of response and predictors of response in participants who received SSRI or SSRI+CBT.

Results: SSRI+CBT significantly decreased symptoms by week 4 (p<0.001) across disorders. 
This improvement continued at week 8 and 12 (p<0.001); however, the additive benefit of 
CBT over SSRI monotherapy was not statistically significant until week 12 (p<0.001). The

fastest response to SSRI+CBT was for patients who were younger, with milder baseline anxiety/
depression symptoms and depressive disorders. The slowest response for SSRI+CBT was for boys, 
adolescents, minoritized children, those with severe symptoms and externalizing disorders.

Limitations: Limitations included inconsistent moderators, variation in the number of 
observations over time and a lack of genetic or pharmacokinetic variables related to SSRI 
exposure across studies.

Conclusions: The superiority of SSRI+CBT for youth with depression and anxiety is further 
supported. For purposes of rapid and greater relief, combination treatment is the superior approach 
across anxiety and depression and is robust to a range of participant characteristics. However, 
the added value of CBT (with an SSRI) occurs late in treatment. These findings represent a 
step towards understanding heterogeneity of treatment response and raise the possibility that 
interventions could be better tailored or adapted based on patient characteristics.

Background

Anxiety and depression are among the most common psychiatric conditions of childhood 
and adolescence, and they carry a risk for devastating long-term sequelae (e.g., heightened 
risk of suicide, educational underachievement, impaired parent and peer relationships, and 
secondary mental health disorders such as substance use). Selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) (Asarnow et al., 2009; Emslie et al., 2009, 2002; March et al., 2009) 
offer a well-supported, evidence-based intervention strategy that can meaningfully improve 
symptoms and functioning. Ample evidence documents their safety and tolerability in 
children and adolescents, and they offer the added advantage of being readily available 
in most communities. And while SSRIs are useful as a monotherapy, when combined with 
cognitive behavior therapy (CBT, COMB) they consistently produce the largest positive 
effects for youth anxiety (Walkup et al., 2008) and depression (Brent et al., 2008a; March 
et al., 2009). What is less understood, however, is which patients are likely to benefit most 
from combination treatment versus SSRI monotherapy, and what kinds of differences to 
expect in magnitude or rate of response when choosing this approach. Such information is 
crucial given the context of limited resources and the investment of time and money that 
comes with initiating a course of CBT.

Prior multi-site trials of treatments for youth anxiety and depressive disorders provide a 
valuable platform for examining which treatments work best for which youth. The following 
NIH-funded, studies have compared SSRI, CBT, and COMB: the Child/Adolescent Anxiety 
Multimodal Study (CAMS) (N=488), the Treatment of SSRI-Resistant Depression Study 
(TORDIA) (N=334) and the Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS) 
(N=438). These were sophisticated studies with systematic, evidence-based assessment 
and well-characterized samples. In each, combination treatment outperformed medication 
monotherapy for average endpoint response (CAMS: 81% for combination therapy vs.

55% for SSRI monotherapy; TADS: 71% for combination therapy vs. 61% for SSRI 
monotherapy; TORDIA: 55% for combination therapy vs. 40% for SSRI monotherapy) 
(Brent et al., 2008a; March et al., 2009; Walkup et al., 2008). Despite this average endpoint 
response across treatments, however, many youth failed to significantly improve. The 
reasons for this remain poorly understood but are directly relevant to practice (Brent et 
al., 2008a; March et al., 2009; Walkup et al., 2008). Additionally, several international trials 
have attempted to understand the contribution of this heterogeneity using a more pragmatic 
design, including the Adolescent Depression Antidepressant and Psychotherapy Trial 
(ADAPT) (Goodyer et al., 2007) and the Youth Depression Alleviation-Combined Treatment 
(YoDA-C) (Davey et al., 2019), although these studies introduced additional heterogeneity 
with the inclusion of young adults (age 18-25 years), partial blinding, assessment of 
outcomes by non-clinicians, and relatively few acute outcomes being measured.

TADS, TORDIA, and CAMS laid the foundation for understanding the potentially 
synergistic effects of CBT and SSRIs and provided a glimpse into individual predictors 
of treatment response. Across all three studies, lower levels of baseline symptom severity 
predicted better treatment response (Asarnow et al., 2009; Compton et al., 2014; Curry et 
al., 2006). Additionally, being younger in TADS (Curry et al., 2006), having less family 
conflict and no non-suicidal self-injurious behavior in TORDIA (Asarnow et al., 2009), and 
having lower caregiver strain and a primary diagnosis other than social anxiety disorder in 
CAMS (Compton et al., 2014) predicted better responses across treatments. Although this 
information is helpful for understanding endpoint outcomes, clinicians selecting from both 
treatment strategies when treating youth with depressive and anxiety disorders currently 
lack data on individual predictors of differences in the trajectory and magnitude of response 
and the differences in this response. This is important given that treatment decisions are 
made in a fluid manner throughout the course of treatment; few providers will wait 12 
weeks to consider a shift in strategy. Thus, there is a need not only to understand who 
responds to which treatments, but also how quickly improvement occurs in different groups. 
Understanding this heterogeneity of treatment response could allow us to refine treatment 
approaches and identify patients who would benefit most from specific interventions, 
particularly as different patients may benefit from monotherapy with an SSRI or CBT versus 
combined treatment with an SSRI and CBT.

As would be expected, response to SSRI monotherapy and SSRI+CBT varies considerably 
across patients. This variation results from differences in treatment delivery, timing of 
enrollment, prior treatment, expectations of treatment success and, importantly, unobserved 
differences between patients (e.g., differences in SSRI metabolism, pharmacodynamic 
differences). These features also vary across CAMS, TADS and TORDIA. While studies 
have examined individual response in subsets of patients and in individual studies, these 
examinations lack power or have yielded conflicting findings. Understanding this variation 
across patients and across these studies is better accomplished with Bayesian hierarchical 
models (BHMs). BHMs integrate multi-level information (e.g., individual patient, treatment, 
comorbidity) to estimate the change in symptoms or probability of improvement at each 
level of a hierarchy, with sub-models within the hierarchy combined with the observed data 
to account for uncertainty (Figure 1) (McGlothlin and Viele, 2018). BHMs allow observed 
variability to be separated so that random differences vs. true differences in treatment

outcomes can be identified (McGlothlin and Viele, 2018). For example, applying a BHM to 
studies of depressive and anxiety disorders that use different SSRIs, allows us to examine 
the influence of disorder (e.g., MDD or anxiety disorder) and different SSRIs on response 
while controlling for the influence of other factors. Thus, the BHM allows us to determine 
treatment effects “in relation to the totality of information available in all the studies” 
(McGlothlin and Viele, 2018). Finally, while subgroup analyses have been conducted in 
individual trials, BHMs that evaluate multiple studies can estimate treatment effects at 
each level of the hierarchy (e.g., study, sex, age, disorder, type of SSRI). By including 
more information and using a multi-level approach, BHMs provide more accurate estimates 
of treatment effects compared to separately examining multiple subgroups, which boosts 
statistical power (McGlothlin and Viele, 2018).

Aggregating response data from large NIH-funded trials of SSRIs and CBT in pediatric 
anxiety and depressive disorders allows not only the primary comparison but also the impact 
of specific variables to be evaluated with greater statistical power than can be accomplished 
in individual trials. With these considerations in mind, this study aimed to examine the 
magnitude and trajectory of response to SSRI or combined SSRI+CBT using BHMs and 
posterior updating from the three large, NIH-funded randomized controlled trials of SSRIs 
and SSRI+CBT in children and adolescents with anxiety and/or depressive disorders. We 
hypothesized that SSRI+CBT would be associated with greater improvement in symptoms 
(and response) compared to SSRI monotherapy and that the additional benefit of CBT would 
emerge later than the improvement associated with SSRI treatment, given general response 
patterns in the individual component studies. We further hypothesized that improvement 
would vary greatly among individuals (compared to the average treatment effect) and that 
individual response (and improvement in symptoms) for all treatments would have the 
greatest effect in younger patients, patients without externalizing disorders, and those with 
milder baseline symptoms. For patients who receive SSRI monotherapy, we hypothesized 
that patients with MDD would have attenuated responses compared to those without MDD 
given expert opinions and commentaries in the field (Mohat and Walkup) and that younger 
patients would have greater responses secondary to increased medication exposure. For the 
SSRI monotherapy and SSRI+CBT treatment models, we examined additional covariates; 
however, these were exploratory and were included to capture observable heterogeneity. 
Finally, we anticipated that additional benefits of CBT would be greatest in younger patients 
and in patients with anxiety disorders rather than major depressive disorder.

Methods

Source of data

The study team accessed the complete, de-identified, original TORDIA, TADS and CAMS 
data sets from the NIMH (Brent et al., 2008b; March, 2004; Walkup et al., 2008). The 
analyses focused on the acute phase of each trial in which symptom severity (based on 
Clinical Global Impression-Severity [CGI-S]) was determined at baseline, week 4, week 8 
and week 12. While some studies included CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) at post-baseline visits 
and some included other dimensional measures of symptom severity, CGI-S was selected as

the primary outcome as it was the consistent measure across all time points in all studies. 
Clinical and demographic data were extracted as previously described (Suresh et al., 2020).

Study details

TORDIA was a prospective, randomized controlled trial of outpatients (N=334) aged 12 to 
18 years with MDD. Patients who failed at least 8 weeks of SSRI trial were randomized, 
using a 2×2 balanced factorial design, to a switch to a different SSRI (paroxetine, 
citalopram, or fluoxetine, 20-40 mg daily) or venlafaxine ER (150-225 mg) or to switch 
to a different SSRI plus CBT or to a switch to venlafaxine plus CBT. Additional study 
details and its results have been described elsewhere (Brent et al., 2008b, 2009; Kennard et 
al., 2009). Medication switches that were combined with CBT yielded higher response rates 
compared to a medication switch (without addition of CBT).

TADS was a prospective, randomized trial involving adolescents (aged 12-17) with MDD 
(N=439) who were randomized to (1) fluoxetine monotherapy (10-40 mg/d), (2) CBT 
monotherapy, (3) CBT + fluoxetine (10-40 mg/d), or (4) placebo. Following 12 weeks 
of treatment, patients who received fluoxetine + CBT were significantly more improved 
compared to patients who had received either CBT or fluoxetine monotherapy. Additionally, 
fluoxetine was superior to CBT and all active treatments were superior to placebo.

CAMS randomized children and adolescents, aged 7-17 years (N=488) to sertraline 
monotherapy, sertraline + CBT, CBT or placebo. Sertraline monotherapy was well tolerated 
and was superior to placebo, but did not statistically differ from CBT, while the combination 
treatment was superior to both monotherapy conditions in terms of clinical global 
improvement scores.

Institutional review boards at each site approved and monitored the protocol in addition to 
external monitoring by a data safety and monitoring board. Patients and at least one parent 
per participant provided informed assent and consent. For this study, no additional ethics 
approval or informed consent was required; this secondary analysis used publicly available 
data.

Symptom Severity and Response Trajectory Modeling

Individual trajectories of symptom severity and response were modeled using log-linear 
trend and individual log-linear trend “random effects” coefficients BHMs. Compared to 
a standard mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), these models have several 
advantages (Suresh et al., 2020; Walker and Shostak, 2010). Logarithmic and logistic trend 
BHMs explicitly model a patient’s correlation in symptoms over time rather than adjusting 
for estimation bias, and the BHM does not rely on asymptotic theory (Gelman et al., 2004). 
Further, BHMs facilitate examination of the sensitivity of the results to varying degrees 
of heterogeneity (Suresh et al., 2020). Specifically, the BHM for individual trajectory of 
symptom severity was specified as follows:

where μ it = α + δitrendt + (Xi × trendt)β, trendt = log(t), t = 1, 2, 3, 4, so that the δis capture 
unobserved heterogeneity in individual patient improvement trajectories, and the interaction 
terms (Xi × trendt) capture variations in trajectories across individuals due to observed 
individual characteristics, with Xi containing individual covariates (i.e., a treatment type 
indicator for CBT, age, sex, race, presence of MDD, baseline symptom severity, presence 
of externalizing disorder). The same models were used to analyze improvement related to 
specific SSRIs.

Improvement in symptoms (i.e., CGI-S score) was defined as: yit = CGISit – CGISi1 
= change in symptom severity from baseline. Prior parameter values used for all BHM 
estimation were: α ~ N(0,1) μ 0 = −0.5, σ0 = 1, a = 0.01, b = 30, β0 = 0, v0 = 1, ω0 
= 0.3. Prior and posterior densities were compared to ensure the priors were relatively 
uninformative (i.e., reasonably flat over the domain of the posterior with non-negligible 
probability, Supplemental Figure 1).

For categorical response (CGI-S ≤ 2), the BHM was specified as a Bernoulli distribution 
with a logistic link function, yit ~ Bern(zit), zit = 1/(1 + e−μit ) with hierarchical priors, α ~ 
N(0,1), δi ~ N(0,1), μ  ~ N(0,1), β ~ N(μ , σ), σ ~ U[0.01,30].

Heterogeneity

Multi-level BHMs which specify a study level between the patient level and overall effect 
level distributions allows for both heterogeneity across studies and heterogeneity across 
individuals within each study. In a BHM, changes in heterogeneity assumptions affect 
the sensitivity of the model. Reducing the number of levels substantially reduces the 
number of model parameters, improving estimation precision at the cost of assuming greater 
homogeneity. Thus, models with and without study level distributions were estimated to 
evaluate across-study heterogeneity, and individual heterogeneity with and without across-
study heterogeneity (i.e., with and without the second row of distributions in Figure 1). 
Finally, models with and without individual heterogeneity were also examined to evaluate 
the robustness of the results to changes in the heterogeneity assumption (i.e., with and 
without the third row of distributions in Figure 1).

Sensitivity Analyses

Additionally, to evaluate the robustness of the results, a variety of trajectory model 
specifications were estimated, including a time indicators specification, and the sensitivity 
of the results to variations in the degree of unobserved heterogeneity across individuals was 
examined. Individual covariates (i.e., a treatment type indicator for SSRI+CBT, age, sex, 
race, indicator for MDD or anxiety, presence of externalizing disorder, baseline symptom 
severity) were included in all model specifications. Linear, log-linear, linear-log, and time

indicator dummy variables (fixed and random effects) specifications were estimated to 
evaluate robustness of results across reasonable model specifications. The logarithmic trend 
individual “fixed effects” model was specified using a difference in differences approach, 
which cancels out the individual fixed effects from the model, yit = Xitβ + δitrendt + εit, εit 
= (uit − ui1) ~ N(0, σ2). The same logarithmic trajectory modeling strategy was utilized to 
examine and compare improvement related to individual SSRIs.

For the end-point analyses, change from baseline to week 12 was examined using two 
approaches. First, adopting the standard distributional assumptions of a Normal distribution 
for mean change in symptom severity and Bernoulli/Binomial for categorical response leads 
to Student-t and Beta posterior distributions respectively, from which a Monte Carlo pseudo-
sample can be directly obtained (Strawn et al., 2018; Suresh et al., 2020). Means, SDs, CrIs 
and p-values were obtained by posterior simulation assuming uninformative priors. Second, 
longitudinal models with time indicators (fixed and random effects models) were estimated 
to incorporate patient characteristics.

Models were estimated using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo No U-Turn Sampler in the 
package Turing.jl, in Julia (version 1.6) (Bezanson et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2018). This 
approach—Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)—utilizes repeated random sampling to 
numerically estimate the probability distribution for change in symptom severity (e.g., 
CGI-S) and response (CGI-S ≤2). From the BHM posterior simulation samples, differences 
in response were computed along with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) and other summary 
statistics. Means are expressed ± their posterior standard deviation (SD). For all analyses, 
Bayesian posterior p-values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant (Suresh et al., 
2020). Further details of this approach and the MCMC estimation procedure for the BHM, 
including examples and executable code, is available at https://github.com/tszanalytics/
Juliacon2019 (Kruschke, 2014; McGlothlin and Viele, 2018; Mills and Strawn, 2019).

Results

Linear, log-linear, linear-log, time indicator dummy variables (fixed and random effects) 
specifications were estimated and the results were consistent across all specifications 
and matched the end-point analyses. Additionally, we specified multi-level BHMs with 
study level specification to identify heterogeneity within studies and in the total sample 
(Supplemental Table 1).

Time course of CBT+SSRI benefit relative to SSRI benefit

Patients who received SSRI+CBT had statistically significant decreases in symptoms 
(reflected by CGI-S score) by week 4 (p<0.001) and improvement continued at week 8 
and 12 (p<0.001). The additive benefit of CBT was not statistically significant at week 
4 (p=0.287) or 8 (p=0.890) but became statistically significant by week 12 (p<0.001). 
Additionally, alternative models (e.g., linear and log-linear trend models) also demonstrated 
this delayed additive benefit from CBT. At week 8, patients who received SSRI+CBT 
did not enjoy significant improvement relative to those who received SSRI monotherapy 
(p=0.667); however, by week 12, SSRI+CBT was associated with a statistically significant 
advantage (βweek 12 SSRI = −0.557±0.028, p<0.001, (βweek 12 additive effect of CBT=−15±0.032,

p<0.001). In other words, adding CBT to SSRI treatment was associated with 27% 
additional improvement compared to simply providing an SSRI. For response (CGI-S 
≤2), youth who received SSRI+CBT were significantly more likely to respond by week 
8 (p<0.001) and this improvement continued at week 12 (p<0.001). The additive benefit 
of CBT in terms of the probability of response was not statistically significant at week 4 
(p=0.839) or 8 (p=0.153) but became statistically significant by week 12 (p<0.001, Figure 
2A).

Predictors of SSRI-related improvement trajectory

In patients treated with SSRIs, younger patients (β=−0.227, CrI: −0.342 to −0.112, p<0.001, 
Figure 3) had greater improvement over time. Having MDD as the primary disorder was also 
associated with a greater improvement over time in treatment response trajectory relative 
to anxiety as the primary disorder (β=−0.249, CrI: −0.357 to −0.141, p<0.001, Figure 3). 
For patients who received SSRIs, girls (β=−0.064, CrI: −0.138 to 0.009, p=0.088) and boys 
had similar responses over time. Patients who had more severe symptoms (β=0.498, CrI: 
0.403 to 0.593, p<0.001, Figure 3), had significantly less improvement over time. Patients 
who were not white (β=0.187, CrI: −0.013 to 0.171, p=0.092, Figure 3) did not differ 
from patients who were white. Finally, patients with externalizing disorder (β=−0.032, CrI: 
−0.131 to 0.066, p=0.520, Figure 3) did not differ from those without an externalizing 
disorder over time.

SSRI-related improvement at endpoint

Patients with more severe baseline anxiety or depressive symptoms were less likely to 
improve with SSRI treatment at endpoint compared to patients with milder symptoms at 
baseline (Cohen’s d: 0.865; mean difference: 1.19 [positive value reflects less improvement]; 
CrI: 0.769 to 1.609; p<0.001). Sex (Cohen’s d: −0.147; p=0.193), age (Cohen’s d: 0.115, 
p=0.389), MDD (Cohen’s d: −0.083; p=0.481), being white (Cohen’s d: 0.086; p=0.560) and 
having an externalizing disorder (Cohen’s d: −0.059; p=0.715) were not associated with the 
endpoint response (Figure 2B).

Predictors of CBT+SSRI-related improvement trajectory

For patients who received CBT and SSRI, girls (β=−0.078, CI: −0.001 to −0.155, p=0.048) 
and younger patients (β=−0.141, CI: −0.250 to −0.033, p=0.011) had greater improvement 
over time. By contrast, patients who had more severe symptoms (β=0.276, CrI: 0.185 to 
0.367, p<0.001), were not white (β=0.187, CrI: 0.081 to 0.294, p=0.001) and those who 
had an externalizing disorder (β=0.166, CrI: 0.064 to 0.269, p=0.002) had less improvement 
over time. The presence of MDD was not associated with a difference in treatment response 
trajectory (β=0.066, CrI: −0.038 to 0.170, p=0.216, Figure 3).

CBT+SSRI-related improvement at endpoint

In patients who received both CBT and SSRIs, being older (Cohen’s d: 0.489; mean 
difference: 0.645; CrI: 0.321 to 0.969; p<0.001), having MDD (Cohen’s d: 0.455; mean 
difference: 0.596; CrI: 0.309 to 0.883; p<0.001), having an externalizing disorder (Cohen’s 
d: 0.387; mean difference: 0.487; CrI: 0.093 to 0.881; p=0.016) and being non-white

(Cohen’s d: 0.392; mean difference: 0.0520; CrI: 0.114 to 0.926; p=0.012) were associated 
with a lower likelihood of response at endpoint. The severity of baseline anxiety or 
depressive symptoms (Cohen’s d: 0.223, p=0.101) nor sex (Cohen’s d: −0.125, p=0.267) 
were associated with endpoint response (Figure 2C).

Differences in endpoint improvement for individual SSRIs in patients receiving CBT

For sertraline-treated patients, there was a statistically significant additive benefit of CBT 
(Cohen’s d=−0.452; mean difference: −0.688, CrI: −1.05 to −0.327; p<0.001). Similar 
effects were observed for paroxetine-treated youth (Cohen’s d=−0.618; mean difference: 
−0.727; CrI: −1.384 to −0.068; p=0.030). Patients who received citalopram and those who 
received citalopram + CBT had similar responses (Cohen’s d=0.574; mean difference: 
0.639, CrI: −0.113 to 1.385; p=0.096). Patients who received fluoxetine or fluoxetine + CBT 
had similar responses (Cohen’s d=−0.012; mean difference: −0.015; CrI: −0.335 to 0.038; 
p=0.929).

Improvement for individual SSRIs

Sertraline and paroxetine were associated with a statistically significant advantage in 
symptom reduction over time when combined with CBT, but this difference was not 
statistically significant for citalopram (mean difference: 0.639±0.383; p=0.096) and 
fluoxetine (mean difference: −0.015±0.164, p=0.929, Table 1). Statistically significant 
advantages were observed, at endpoint, for sertraline (p<0.001) and at a trend level for 
citalopram (p=0.065), but not for paroxetine (p=0.233 or fluoxetine (p=0.448, Table 1).

Among the SSRIs, citalopram was associated with the greatest improvement over time 
(β=−0.795, p=0.001) followed by sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (Table 1).

Assessment of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses

The mean trend coefficient estimates for change in symptoms were similar in the models 
with individual trends (βtrend = −0.742, p<0.001; βSSRI+CBT = −0.074, p=0.034) and those 
that assume a homogeneous trend (βtrend = −0.739, p=0.04; βSSRI+CBT =−0.074, p=0.027). 
That said, there was greater heteroegeneity of improvement in patients receiving SSRI 
monotherapy compared to patients receiving SSRI+CBT (Figure 4, Supplemental Figure 2). 
All models were estimated with covariates (e.g., age, sex, race, presence of externalizing 
disorders) and the results were robust across specifications. For CAMS, TADS and TORDIA 
the response trajectory coefficients were: −0.665 (CrI: −0612 to −0.717), −0.584 (CrI: 
=0.522 to −0.645), and −0.607 (CrI: −0.554 to −0.659). Further, the average treatment 
effects across studies did not significantly differ (CAMS vs. TADS, p=0.280; CAMS vs. 
TORDIA, p=0.420; TADS vs. TORDIA, p=0.710). Similarly, treatment effects in patients 
who received CBT+SSRI did not significantly differ across trials nor did they differ in 
patients who received SSRI monotherapy (Supplemental Table 1).

Limitations

While this is one of very few applications of BHMs in psychiatry and sheds new 
light on treatment selection in youth with depressive and anxiety disorders, there are

several important limitations that warrant additional discussion. First, there may have been 
differences in exposure, with some SSRIs, related to pharmacokinetic genes (Strawn et al. 
2019) and other factors, that contributed to variability in response (Sakolsky et al. 2011). 
Second, several of these findings are based on an assumption of a deterministic logarithmic 
trend model to gain degrees of freedom, which imposes a more restrictive functional form 
for the trajectory of response but leads to greater precision in evaluating response, though we 
also examined a nonparametric time indicator specification and these results confirmed our 
findings. Third, prior treatment experience (e.g., failed SSRI trial) may have influenced 
treatment response and this would have been most pronounced in TORDIA wherein 
individuals were required to fail one prior SSRI trial. However, response trajectory was 
statistically similar across all three studies. Fourth, we were limited in our ability to examine 
all moderators of treatment response and, despite the impressive sample size of TORDIA, 
TADS, and CAMS, had a limited number of observations over time, which precluded a 
deeper analysis examining differential trajectories of improvement within putative subgroups 
that included combined characteristics (e.g., sex + age + ADHD comorbidity). Similarly, 
because of small sample sizes, we could not explore specific predictors of treatment 
response in patients with anxious depression. Fifth, several international trials of depression 
(Adolescent Depression Antidepressant and Psychotherapy Trial (ADAPT) (Goodyer et 
al., 2007) or depression and anxiety (Youth Depression Alleviation-Combined Treatment 
(YoDA-C)) (Davey et al., 2019) were not included in this analysis. These studies included 
heterogeneous samples, with young adults (age 18-25 years), had partial blinding, outcomes 
assessed by non-clinicians, and only measured outcomes at weeks 6 and 12 (which limits 
trajectory modeling). Sixth, regarding differences in response and response trajectory for 
individual SSRIs across studies, these differences could relate to multiple factors which 
generally represent unobserved factors, including pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
variation that are linked with differences in response and tolerability in children and 
adolescents. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some SSRIs may be more 
effective in MDD vs anxiety disorders or vice versa. Finally, though quality of life and 
tolerability measures were collected, heterogeneity and inconsistency (with regard to side 
effect ratings, duration, severity and temporal stability) precluded their incorporation in our 
BHM.

Discussion

This study—the largest examination of SSRIs and CBT in youth with depressive and 
anxiety disorders to date—examined predictors of COMB and SSRI monotherapy response, 
finding evidence that combination treatment is robust across disorders. Younger youth and 
those with milder baseline symptoms respond best to COMB, whereas males, adolescents, 
minority participants, and those with more severe baseline symptoms and externalizing 
disorders may take longer to respond. Importantly, while the addition of CBT significantly 
improved the overall magnitude of response, on average increasing response relative to SSRI 
monotherapy, it did not accelerate the speed of response.

Given that, across studies, the response to SSRI monotherapy leaves considerable room 
for improvement, it is encouraging that COMB offers substantially better and less 
heterogeneous outcomes and that it does so for youth across depressive and anxiety

disorders. At the same time, the present findings highlight key considerations for both 
parents and providers. First, the advantages of including CBT in treatment take time 
to appear. Although the endpoint outcome may be clearly superior, in this study the 
additional benefit of CBT was not evident until week 12. This is to be expected, given 
that for both anxiety and depression, CBT is a skills-based approach comprising a range 
of different techniques. These techniques build on each other sequentially over time, and 
in some cases (e.g., anxiety), key ingredients (i.e., exposure) are not introduced until 
well into treatment. For families deciding between SSRI monotherapy and COMB, setting 
expectations regarding treatment course will be key. Moreover, as the evidence base for brief 
and single-session CBT interventions grows (Schleider et al., 2020; Schleider and Weisz, 
2017), it will be important to examine how these treatments work in concert with SSRIs and 
whether it is possible to achieve significant treatment effects more quickly.

Separate from this issue, several patient characteristics meaningfully influenced response to 
COMB, but not SSRIs. Boys, older and minority participants, and participants with more 
severe baseline symptoms and externalizing disorders had a slower response when treated 
with CBT+SSRI. Younger participants and those with depressive disorders and milder 
baseline symptoms improved fastest when treated with SSRI monotherapy. Regarding 
externalizing disorders, and specifically ADHD, it is worth noting that when stimulants 
were used in the component studies, they consisted primarily of shorter-acting medications. 
It is commonly observed in clinical practice that breakthrough ADHD symptoms often 
emerge in the afternoon—roughly the time when these youth with ADHD were beginning 
psychotherapy. Thus, it is possible that optimizing treatment of the externalizing disorder 
could restore the benefit associated with CBT. Additionally, that older youth did not do 
as well with CBT+SSRI treatment may relate to developmental factors. For example, 
older patients with depression and anxiety disorders may report impairment or specific 
symptoms (e.g., psychic, somatic, avoidance/withdrawal) differently than younger patients. 
For example, in older adolescents, the interpersonal context of symptoms may be more 
amenable to therapies that include an interpersonal focus, such as IPT-A. Of note, these 
factors may be less represented in the traditional CBT included in CAMS, TADS, and 
TORDIA. Ultimately, strategies to tailor CBT interventions to specific patient characteristics 
are urgently needed to realize the value of combination treatment over SSRI alone.

For patients with more severe symptoms, both COMB and SSRI monotherapy had 
significantly slower improvement over time while the endpoint response was also 
significantly attenuated in patients treated with SSRI monotherapy. This finding is consistent 
with prior analyses suggesting that anxious patients with severe (compared to moderate) 
symptoms do best with COMB (Taylor et al., 2018). The reasons why patients with 
more severe illness fare worse with SSRI monotherapy is complex and may relate to 
COMB addressing non-biological contributors to high symptom severity. For example, 
in patients with more severe symptoms, caregiver strain is increased (Compton et al., 
2014) and caregiver strain may be addressed indirectly in COMB by the psychosocial 
component. Additionally, more family accommodation contributes to more severe symptoms 
and ostensibly perpetuates psychopathology in youth with more severe symptoms (Walkup 
et al., 2021). Also, such family factors, including accommodation and caregiver strain are 
uniquely addressed in COMB.

In our analysis, girls did better with COMB compared to boys. While the reasons for this 
difference are speculative, there are a number of potential mechanisms that could subtend 
this difference. First, cortical, and subcortical maturation is sexually dimorphic (Shaw et al., 
2014; Raznahan et al., 2010). Secondary to earlier prefrontal maturation, girls may have 
a prefrontal advantage that could relate to age-specific superiority in cognitive functions 
that are required for maximal benefit from CBT and are based in prefrontal regions. 
Additionally, subcortical development is sexually dimorphic and ventral striatal systems 
that subserve inhibitory control and reward processing develop later in boys compared to 
girls (Shaw et al., 2014). Given the development of skills in CBT that rely on inhibitory 
control and reward processing, this delayed development raises the possibility that boys—at 
certain developmental stages—may lack the neurobiologic substrate to maximally benefit 
from CBT-related interventions that target these processes. Finally, given that many of the 
therapists participating in these trials were female, the pairing of female-female may have 
contributed to differences in the therapeutic alliance which is known to affect outcomes in 
some children and adolescents (Cummings et al., 2013).

While individual differences among SSRIs should be interpreted with caution secondary 
to the sample sizes, several of the SSRI monotherapy findings warrant additional 
discussion. Citalopram monotherapy produced greater improvement over time, and, at 
endpoint, sertraline (at a 7% threshold) and citalopram monotherapy produced greater 
improvement compared to the other SSRIs. Both sertraline and citalopram are metabolized 
by the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19 which produces substantial variability in plasma 
concentrations in pediatric patients (Strawn et al, 2021). However, in the trials included in 
this analysis, both citalopram and sertraline were aggressively dosed compared to routine 
clinical practice; this may have enhanced their apparent efficacy, particularly in rapid and 
ultrarapid metabolizers. Additionally, these SSRIs are among the most serotonergically 
selective and, in meta-analyses of SSRIs in pediatric patients, greater serotonergic selectivity 
predicts greater response (Strawn et al, 2015). Both paroxetine and fluoxetine have greater 
pharmacokinetic complexity and, unlike sertraline and citalopram, have non-linear kinetics 
which may contribute to difficult to predict exposure associated with dose titration. Finally, 
paroxetine is poorly tolerated in multiple meta-analyses of SSRIs in pediatric patients, 
potentially secondary to its short half-life, anticholinergic properties, and mechanism-based 
CYP2D6 inhibition (Cipriani et al, 2018; Dobson et al, 2019). These factors could contribute 
to its relative inferiority to other SSRIs in some of our comparisons.

It is important to note that minority youth did not respond as well to COMB, particularly 
in light of the growing recognition that psychosocial treatments are not always developed 
using diverse and representative sets of youth and that they are not always administered 
in a culturally sensitive manner. Concerningly, these findings dovetail with data suggesting 
that minority youth are much less likely to receive quality, standard of care psychotherapy 
and pharmacotherapy (Cummings et al., 2019). The finding that minority participants did 
not benefit as much from COMB as their white counterparts underscores the need to 
develop and test culturally tailored CBT adaptations, and to carefully consider the role 
of variables such as alliance, engagement, and family involvement in mediating outcome. 
Interestingly, in a recent prospective trial of CBT-based interventions in youth with OCD, 
minority youth had better outcomes with enhanced family therapy. This finding and others

suggest that specific aspects of CBT may be particularly important for minority youth 
but are underemphasized in current protocols. For example, family involvement varies 
considerably across CBTs, and greater family involvement in psychotherapy predicts greater 
improvement in non-whites (Pina et al., 2009). Further, family involvement in these cases 
may relate to cultural factors; some minority families may see family involvement as 
particularly important, especially in families that see individuals as interdependent on 
one another. Further, given that the understanding of symptoms and psychopathology 
varies across races and groups, the relative importance of attribution of symptoms and 
autonomy may complicate treatment of depression and anxiety within some families. 
Most importantly, members of minority groups, in particular Blacks, have suffered 
institutionalized discrimination within the white-dominated healthcare system (Nong et 
al. 2020) for centuries, and this discrimination has enduring consequences in terms of 
distrust in the healthcare system (Armstrong et al., 2013; Boulware et al., 2003). If this 
discrimination and the resulting distrust is the primary factor that attenuates the effectiveness 
of CBT across disorders in pediatric patients, the solution may require much more than 
adaptation of a CBT protocol.

Given the time course of improvement associated with the addition of CBT in SSRI-treated 
patients, research should focus on individualized approaches to psychotherapy as opposed 
to contemporary one-size-fits-all approaches. Sequential or staged approaches introducing 
psychotherapy later in treatment also warrants further study. For example, one small study 
of depressed patients treated with interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents (IPT-A) found 
that adapting the intervention (frequency of IPTA-A or addition of fluoxetine) earlier (week 
4) produced greater improvement compared to the same “augmentation” changes just 4 
weeks later (Gunlicks-Stoessel et al., 2019). The heterogeneity in response associated 
with the one-size-fits-all approach to CBT suggests that tailoring interventions could be 
warranted in some individuals with slow responses to combined CBT+SSRI treatment.

In youths with depression and anxiety, SSRIs +CBT consistently produce 
greater improvement than monotherapy.

How SSRI+CBT vs SSRI response varies across disorders and patients is 
unknown.

SSRI+CBT significantly decreased symptoms by week 4 across disorders.

The additive benefit of CBT over SSRI monotherapy is not statistically 
significant until week 12.

The fastest response to SSRI+CBT was for patients who were younger, with 
milder baseline anxiety/depression symptoms and depressive disorders.

Figure 2: Improvement in youth with depressive and anxiety disorders who received treatment 
with SSRIs or SSRIs+CBT.
Individual trajectories of improvement are shown for patients who receive SSRIs (blue 
line) or SSRI+CBT (red line) in panel A. Endpoint improvement for patients who received 
SSRI monotherapy or SSRI+CBT are shown in B and C. Note: Positive values reflect less 
improvement. For example, in 2B, a large and significant value corresponds with patients 
who had greater severity improving significantly less, matching the trajectories for symptom 
severity comparisons shown in Figure 3F
