Olfactory deficits predict cognitive decline
and Alzheimer dementia in an urban
community

ABSTRACT

Objective: To determine the predictive utility of baseline odor identification deficits for future
cognitive decline and the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia.

Methods: In a multiethnic community cohort in North Manhattan, NY, 1,037 participants without
dementia were evaluated with the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test
(UPSIT). In 757 participants, follow-up occurred at 2 years and 4 years.

Results: In logistic regression analyses, lower baseline UPSIT scores were associated with cogni-
tive decline (relative risk 1.067 per point interval; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.040, 1.095;
p , 0.0001), and remained significant (relative risk 1.065 per point interval; 95% CI 1.034,
1.095; p , 0.0001) after including covariates. UPSIT, but not Selective Reminding Test–total
immediate recall, predicted cognitive decline in participants without baseline cognitive impair-
ment. During follow-up, 101 participants transitioned to AD dementia. In discrete time survival
analyses, lower baseline UPSIT scores were associated with transition to AD dementia (hazard
ratio 1.099 per point interval; 95% CI 1.067, 1.131; p , 0.0001), and remained highly signif-
icant (hazard ratio 1.072 per point interval; 95% CI 1.036, 1.109; p , 0.0001) after including
demographic, cognitive, and functional covariates.

Conclusions: Impairment in odor identification was superior to deficits in verbal episodic memory
in predicting cognitive decline in cognitively intact participants. The findings support the cross-
cultural use of a relatively inexpensive odor identification test as an early biomarker of cognitive
decline and AD dementia. Such testing may have the potential to select/stratify patients in treat-
ment trials of cognitively impaired patients or prevention trials in cognitively intact individuals.

Neurofibrillary tangles in the olfactory bulb are an early pathologic sign of Alzheimer disease
(AD). Odor identification deficits during life are associated with tangles in the olfactory bulb
and central olfactory projection areas at autopsy.1,2 Odor identification deficits distinguish
patients with AD dementia from controls,3,4 and these deficits are greater in mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and mild AD dementia compared with cognitively intact controls even after
accounting for odor detection and odor discrimination abilities.5

Odor identification deficits predict the transition from MCI to AD dementia.4 In a 3-year
follow-up study, these deficits were associated with 4 to 5 times increased likelihood of tran-
sitioning from MCI to AD dementia.6 Epidemiologic studies show similar, although smaller,
effects.7 In older adults without significant cognitive impairment, odor identification deficits
increase the likelihood of transitioning to MCI,8 but their utility in predicting cognitive decline
more broadly remains unclear.

In a multiethnic elderly community study,
University of Pennsylvania Smell Identifica-
tion Test (UPSIT) scores were similar between
English and Spanish test administrations after
controlling for age, sex, and education.9 Par-
ticipants without MCI had higher UPSIT
scores
than participants with nonamnestic
MCI, who had higher UPSIT scores than par-
ticipants with amnestic MCI.

We now report on follow-up data in this
cohort. We hypothesized that baseline odor
identification deficits would predict cognitive
decline and be superior to episodic verbal mem-
ory deficits in this prediction. We also hypoth-
esized that odor identification deficits would
significantly predict the transition from MCI
to AD dementia even after controlling for
demographic, clinical, and cognitive measures.

METHODS Participants. A stratified random sample of 50%
of all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older, obtained
from the Health Care Finance Administration, was recruited ini-
tially from a specific region of North Manhattan, NY.10 This
Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP)
cohort includes participants recruited originally in 1992 (approxi-
mately 25% of subjects) and a new cohort recruited between 1999
and 2001 (approximately 75% of subjects).11 At each visit, all
participants received a standardized neuropsychological test battery
that included measures of learning and memory, orientation,
abstract reasoning, executive function, language, and visuospatial
ability. The sum of 6 items for instrumental activities of daily living
formed a function score.11 A standardized neurologic examination
included a 10-item version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease
Rating Scale12 that was used to diagnose Parkinson disease based
on research criteria.13

Olfactory testing. Odor identification testing was performed
with the UPSIT, a highly reliable, sensitive, and well-validated
olfactory test.14–16 The research technician administered the
English or Spanish version of the UPSIT depending on the
participant’s language preference. The neuropsychological tests and
the UPSIT were administered in the same language. In the UPSIT,
each of 40 common odorants is embedded in microcapsules located
on separate pages of 10-page booklets. The participant scratches an
odorant strip containing the microencapsulated odorant page, sniffs
the emanated odor, and chooses the best answer from 4 items listed
as multiple choice. The total score ranges from 0 (no odors correctly
identified) to 40 (all odors correctly identified). For study inclusion,
the participant needed to complete a minimum 38 of 40 UPSIT
items. For participants who completed 38 or 39 items, a score of
0.25 was imputed for each missing item.8

The study sample comprised participants without dementia
who received the UPSIT and met specific inclusion/exclusion crite-
ria.11,17 Clinical stroke and Parkinson disease were excluded.11 The
UPSIT was first administered at the evaluation between 2004 and
2006, identified as “baseline” for this report. Follow-ups occurred
during 2006–2008 (first follow-up) and 2008–2010 (second
follow-up). At all time points, consensus diagnoses of dementia,
including AD dementia, were made as described previously, based
on available clinical, cognitive, and functional information but

without UPSIT data. Cognitive decline was defined a priori as a
decline in the average of the 3 cognitive composite scores of 1 SD or
greater for 4-year follow-up or a decline of 0.5 SD or greater if
follow-up was limited to 2 years. Outcomes at the last available
follow-up time point were used.

MCI classification and cognitive composite scores. Based
on a previously published factor analytic approach within this
cohort, composite cognitive domain scores were derived for mem-
ory, language, and visual-spatial ability.18 The memory composite
comprised three 12-item 6-trial Selective Reminding Test (SRT)
measures (total immediate recall or SRT-TR, delayed recall, and
delayed recognition); the language composite comprised measures
of naming, letter and category fluency, verbal abstract reasoning,
repetition, and comprehension; and the visual-spatial ability
composite comprised the Benton Visual Retention Test recognition
and matching variables, the Rosen Drawing Test, and the Identities
and Oddities subtest. The classification of amnestic MCI required
memory complaints, intact function, and a score of 1.5 SD below
standardized norms on a composite of verbal and nonverbal memory
measures with or without other cognitive domain deficits.
in any
Nonamnestic MCI required a similar level of deficit
nonmemory cognitive domain composite.18 In this epidemiologic
study, norms adjusted for language of administration and other
demographics have been described elsewhere.11

MRI protocol. Scan acquisition was performed on a 1.5T Phi-
lips Intera scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands)
at Columbia University Medical Center and transferred electronically
to the University of California at Davis for morphometric analysis. As
described previously,9,19 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery weighted
axial images were used to assess white matter hyperintensities, and
T1-weighted images acquired in the axial plane and resectioned
coronally were used to quantify hippocampus and entorhinal
cortex volumes. The sum of right and left hippocampal and
entorhinal cortex volumes were used in analyses.

APOE genotyping. DNA was amplified by PCR and genotypes
were assessed by sizes of DNA fragments. APOE genotypes were
determined blinded to participant status.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The Columbia University–New York State Psychiatric
Institute institutional review board approved the study protocol
and informed consent forms.

Statistical analyses. Distributions and group differences in
demographic and clinical variables were examined by x2, t test,
and general linear models. Spearman correlations between UPSIT
scores and demographic, cognitive, functional, and MRI meas-
ures were evaluated. The definition of cognitive decline was based
on the trend (change) in the composite cognitive domain scores
during follow-up instead of being measured directly as the outcome
at each visit. Therefore, logistic regression analyses were used for the
outcome of cognitive decline. Discrete time survival models were
used to evaluate the associations between baseline UPSIT scores
and the outcome of AD dementia. Covariates were age, sex,
education, SRT-TR (cognitive measure selected a priori), and
functional impairment. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

compared across different models using the bootstrapping

Follow-up. In 757 participants who completed at
least one follow-up, 109 transitioned to dementia,
among whom 101 transitioned to AD dementia. Two
participants
transitioned to vascular dementia, 3
participants to Lewy body dementia, and 3 participants
to other causes of dementia. For participants with
baseline status of no MCI, nonamnestic MCI, and
amnestic MCI, transition rates to dementia at final
follow-up were 35/498 (7.03%), 32/129 (24.81%),
and 42/130 (32.31%), respectively (x2 5 67.11, p ,

In participants without MCI at baseline (n 5
498), those who showed cognitive decline (n 5
102) had a mean baseline UPSIT score of 24.58
(SD 6.30) compared with a mean baseline UPSIT
score of 28.54 (SD 6.20) in nondecliners (n 5
387). Participants not followed (n 5 9) had the low-
est UPSIT scores (mean 22.33, SD 7.66). In logistic
regression analyses, a lower UPSIT score was strongly
associated with subsequent cognitive decline (RR 5
1.096 per point interval; 95% CI 1.060, 1.135; p ,
0.0001). Lower baseline UPSIT remained highly sig-
nificant (RR 1.089 per point interval; 95% CI 1.050,
1.130; p , 0.0001) after the inclusion of covariates in
the model (table 2). When only the UPSIT and SRT-
TR measures were included in the logistic regression
model, the UPSIT remained significant (RR 1.094
per point interval; 95% CI 1.057, 1.133) but SRT-
TR was not significant (RR 1.010 per point interval;
95% CI 0.983, 1.037; p 5 0.478).

Transition to AD dementia. In discrete time survival
analyses in the follow-up sample (n 5 757), lower
baseline UPSIT scores were strongly associated with
transition to AD dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.099
per point interval; 95% CI 1.067, 1.131; p , 0.0001).
Lower baseline UPSIT scores
remained highly
significant (HR 1.072 per point interval; 95% CI
1.036, 1.109; p , 0.0001) after the inclusion of sex,
age, test language, education, SRT-TR, and functional
impairment as covariates in the model. Compared to
the fourth quartile with the highest UPSIT scores, the
HRs for transition to AD dementia for the first,
second, and third quartiles of UPSIT scores were
10.33 (95% CI 4.55, 23.49), 5.68 (95% CI 2.44,
13.20), and 3.92 (95% CI 1.60, 9.58), respectively
(figure 1).

In survival analyses restricted to participants with
MCI at baseline (n 5 259), lower baseline UPSIT
scores were associated significantly with transition to
AD dementia (HR 1.064 per point interval; 95% CI
1.024, 1.106; p , 0.0017). Lower baseline UPSIT
scores remained highly significant (HR 1.058; 95%

of either cognitive decline or MCI transition to AD
dementia. Smoking (current or past smoker) also was
not a significant covariate in the analyses of cognitive
decline or AD dementia as outcomes. In all analyses,
including SRT–delayed recall instead of SRT-TR led
to similar results (e.g., table 2).

ROC analyses. In ROC analyses, for the prediction of
cognitive decline, the AUC for the UPSIT was signif-
icantly greater than for SRT-TR (0.638 vs 0.513, p ,

the UPSIT and SRT-TR combined was not superior
to the UPSIT alone (figure 2). For the transition to

combined (0.77) improved prediction compared with
the individual AUCs (0.65 and 0.73) as displayed in
figure 3. For the UPSIT alone, for a fixed sensitivity
of 50%, the specificity was 66.89% for cognitive
decline and 73.13% for
the transition to AD
dementia.

DISCUSSION The UPSIT, unlike SRT-TR, signif-
icantly predicted cognitive decline and retained signifi-
cance with both measures included in the model,
indicating an advantage for odor identification
deficits over episodic verbal memory in predicting
cognitive decline in cognitively intact individuals.
Our findings with episodic verbal memory support
another report showing that cognitive test perfor-
mance does not predict subsequent cognitive decline
in cognitively intact community-residing older adults.22
In community studies, olfactory identification def-
icits have been shown to be associated with decline in
Mini-Mental State Examination scores23 and verbal
memory.24,25 In a sample of 589 cognitively intact
elderly subjects, lower scores on the Brief Smell Iden-
tification Test (a 12-item subset of the UPSIT) were
associated with a 50% increased risk of developing
MCI over a 5-year period.8 The Brief Smell Identifi-
cation Test also predicted cognitive decline during

2 years of follow-up in a Japanese-American epidemi-
ologic cohort. This effect was prominent in APOE e4
carriers,7 similar to findings in smaller clinical sam-
ples.26,27 We did not observe an association between
UPSIT scores and the APOE e4 allele; other reports
from the WHICAP multiethnic cohort have shown
an APOE e4 predictive effect only in participants
already diagnosed with AD dementia.28

In this study, odor identification deficits predicted
both cognitive decline and AD dementia in the same
population-based community cohort. The UPSIT
showed significant predictive utility for the outcome
of AD dementia in this community sample with rel-
atively low transition rates to AD dementia, support-
ing the findings in clinical samples with higher
transition rates to AD dementia.4,6 Both episodic ver-
bal memory deficits and odor identification deficits
predicted AD dementia, and the combination was
superior
to each measure in this prediction as
observed in clinical prediction studies.6

The results support the use of the UPSIT in both
English- and Spanish-speaking individuals provided
age, sex, and education are taken into account.9 In an
Italian clinical study, the UPSIT was modified to
include 34 (of 40) culturally relevant items. In that
study, in 88 patients with MCI, 47% of patients with
low olfactory scores (,24) progressed to dementia in 2
years compared with 11% of patients with normal
olfactory scores ($24).29 The UPSIT and similar tests,
with culturally appropriate modifications when needed,
can be a useful predictor of cognitive decline and the
transition to AD dementia across different ethnicities.
In AD, there is disease pathology in both the olfac-
tory bulb and higher order olfactory processing areas
that are involved in olfactory function. Therefore, a
variety of olfactory deficits can occur, and among them
odor identification deficits can precede the clinical
manifestation of cognitive impairment. Odor identifi-
cation impairment as a biomarker of future cognitive
decline, even if not very specific to AD, is consistent
with the evidence that AD neuropathology develops
decades before classic clinical manifestations.30

There were some limitations to this study. Partic-
ipants who were not followed had lower UPSIT and
memory test scores, indirectly suggesting that survi-
vor bias may have rendered the prediction an under-
estimate. Odor identification is superior in women
compared with men and declines markedly with
age, especially after the sixth decade.14 Therefore,
absolute unadjusted numerical UPSIT cutoff scores
cannot be used to define abnormality, and age and
sex adjustments are needed.14,16 Age-related changes
also occur with other markers of MCI and AD
dementia: cognitive test performance, MRI atrophy
indices, FDG (2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose)-PET
and amyloid PET abnormalities, and decreased

b-amyloid 42 with increased tau and phospho-tau in
CSF.31–34 Also, odor identification deficits have lim-
ited specificity because they occur in nonspecific
anosmia, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and alco-
holism.16,35,36 These disorders need to be excluded
before olfactory testing is used as a predictor of cog-
nitive decline or transition to AD. In addition to AD
dementia, odor identification deficits occur in Lewy
body dementia and probably vascular dementia,37,38
and therefore cannot be used to subtype dementia
diagnosis. The value of biomarkers will improve when
more effective treatments for AD dementia are devel-
oped. Nonetheless,
accuracy in predicting AD
dementia can be useful to improve clinical manage-
ment and to help patients and family members plan
for their future.

The UPSIT was stronger than SRT-TR in predict-
ing cognitive decline, and their combination was not
superior to the UPSIT alone. Predictive accuracy for
cognitive decline was moderate in this community
cohort, suggesting that the UPSIT may need to be
combined with other measures for use as a screening
tool to identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline
in the general population.

Clinicians consider age, education, cognitive test
performance, and functional ability when evaluating
patients with suspected cognitive decline, MCI, or
AD dementia. This study’s findings indicate that

188

Neurology 84 January 13, 2015

odor identification can contribute significantly to pre-
diction over and above the assessment of these meas-
ures.4,6 MRI hippocampal volume did not show
predictive utility in this cohort, supporting the poten-
tial advantage that a relatively inexpensive odor iden-
tification test has over expensive procedures to predict
future cognitive decline and AD dementia. In the
future, odor identification test performance may be
a useful measure to select/stratify patients in treat-
ment trials of patients with cognitive impairment,
or prevention trials in cognitively intact individuals,
because olfactory deficits can predict cognitive decline
in cognitively intact individuals and are an early bio-
marker of AD neuropathology.
