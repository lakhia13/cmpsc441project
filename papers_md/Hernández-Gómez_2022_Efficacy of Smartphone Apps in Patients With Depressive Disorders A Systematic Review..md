practice to provide better support for patients with mental disorders. However, the
clinical efﬁcacy in patients with depressive disorders is not well known. We aimed to
determine the efﬁcacy of smartphone applications (apps) in patients diagnosed with a
depressive disorder.

Method: An electronic database search was performed of PubMed, PsycINFO, and
Web of Science, to identify relevant articles up to June 12, 2021. Peer-reviewed articles
were screened and selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Seven articles met

the inclusion criteria and therefore were selected
Results:
for
the systematic review, which included a total of 651 patients. The results
were heterogeneous, essentially due to the different methodologies used in the
selected studies.

Conclusions: Digital smartphone-delivered interventions do not appear to reduce
depressive symptomatology nor improve the quality of life in patients diagnosed with
depressive disorders when compared to an active control group. Taking into account the
inherent methodological difﬁculties and the variability among such studies, it is apparent
that further research—with more methodologically reﬁned clinical trials, including larger
sample sizes—is needed.

INTRODUCTION

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mood disorder characterized by low or depressed mood
present for two weeks or more, along with other symptoms such as loss of interest or pleasure, loss
of energy, sleep and appetite disorders, diminished ability to concentrate and recurrent negative
thoughts as main features (1). The lifetime prevalence of MDD varies from 2 to 21% (2), presenting
approximately twice as often in women than in men (3). MDD is one of the medical conditions that
generates the largest chronic disease burden adjusted by “years lived with disability” in populations
of any socioeconomic status. Additionally, MDD increases the risk of developing other medical
conditions [i.e., cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases, (3)]. Social and health care costs associated

Smartphone Apps in Patients With Depressive Disorders

with MDD are high (4), and patients still have barriers to
access to quality treatment. Since the emergence of the COVID-
19 pandemic, the prevalence of depression and anxiety has
continued to increase globally (5). This points to the need
for urgent and cost-eﬃcient solutions for people experiencing
this symptomatology.

The progress of new technologies is having an impact on
clinical practice in mental health. In regard to developing
improvements in clinical attention for people with mental
smartphone apps are in the spotlight.
health disorders,
App interventions delivered via smartphones are low cost
and of special relevance for public health (6). Apps are
ﬂexible interventions that can be therapist-guided, unguided
(7)], or applied as a stand-alone or
[i.e., self-help apps;
combined treatment.

Regarding psychotic disorders, the literature suggests that app
interventions are feasible and well accepted by people with such
disorders, especially during early stages of the disease (8), and
therefore may improve treatment adherence, symptomatology,
and duration of hospital admissions (9). In addition, evidence
suggests that people presenting with more severe psychotic
and depressive symptoms seem to have a better engagement
interventions compared to people experiencing
with digital
mild symptoms (10). In this vein, apps seem to improve
manic and depressive symptomatology in people with bipolar
disorder, especially when interventions include psychoeducation
techniques (11) without any apparent limitation in their use
by these patients (12). On the other hand, to date, possible
negative eﬀects associated with the use of digital interventions in
patients with depressive disorders have been detected, such as the
appearance of new symptomatology, worsening of the existing
disorder, trouble when implementing the designated tasks or
a subjective feeling of pressure while trying to complete them
on time (13). Similarly, other barriers, such as worry about the
eﬃcacy of the intervention, diﬃculties in app use, privacy issues
and lack of direct professional feedback, were detected (14).

Regarding anxiety and depressive disorders in particular,
the literature suggests that apps may have a role in reducing
anxious-depressive symptomatology. One systematic meta-
the use of mobile-
review of meta-analyses revealed that
based interventions is a promising approach to achieving a
modest reduction in depressive and anxious symptoms, although
there are no clear diﬀerences when such interventions are
compared to active therapeutic interventions (6). In terms of
assessing the extent of the clinical improvement, it is paramount
to consider the level of
intervention adherence, which is
greater when the intervention involves a higher degree of user
engagement (15). However, maintaining user engagement is a
challenge in relation to app interventions because, often, there
is a rapid drop in their use (6). In a previous systematic
review, contradictory results regarding the eﬃcacy of apps
based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in patients
suﬀering from mild and moderate depression were found (16).
According to Hrynyschyn and Dockweiler (16), the clinical
and methodological heterogeneity in the clinical trials interferes
with the outcome analyses and prevents us from drawing solid
conclusions. However, the review conducted by Hrynyschyn

the
and Dockweiler (16) provides limited evidence about
eﬃcacy of these interventions, since it focuses exclusively on
apps based on CBT, includes patients with mild or moderate
depression selected by using cutoﬀ scores in questionnaires
about depression (without the need of being diagnosed by a
health professional) and only analyzes studies carried out from
2015 onward. In their meta-analysis, Serrano-Ripoll et al. (17)
found smartphone app interventions had a moderate eﬀect on
depressive symptomatology. Nonetheless, these authors include
studies conducted with participants with depressive symptoms,
and not in all the studies were the patients diagnosed by a
health professional. Additionally, in this systematic review, only
studies that compared app interventions to non-active control
groups (i.e., minimal intervention, treatment as usual, waiting-
list control) were analyzed. This could overestimate the eﬀect of
app interventions.

is more diﬃcult

Some studies have highlighted the advantages of digital
interventions, such as the motivational aspects of the apps
and their accessibility (18). This is especially relevant to those
individuals for whom it
to access face-
to-face clinical appointments (19). Despite these advantages,
implementing digital
interventions still presents numerous
challenges before such interventions can be incorporated into
daily clinical practice, such as the lack of integration of apps into
computer systems in public health care, or issues surrounding
the protection of client privacy (20). This contrasts with the
increasing worldwide popularity of apps among smartphone
users, which is leading to an overload of the app market (21),
along with the proliferation of apps that employ non-evidence-
based techniques (22). In line with the aforementioned and as a
result of the mental health problems associated with the COVID-
19 pandemic, the rise of apps continues to increase (23). Thus, a
systematic review to critically analyze and reﬂect on the eﬃcacy
of such apps is needed.

Given the high availability of these apps in app stores (21) and
their growth in both the app market and clinical practice (20), it
is necessary to critically assess the eﬃcacy of these interventions
in patients with depressive disorders diagnosed by a health
professional. Therefore, the aim of the present systematic review
is to determine the eﬃcacy of smartphone app interventions for
patients with depressive disorders.

To achieve the aims of the present systematic review, the

the Preferred Reporting Items

Study Selection Criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) randomized clinical
trials regarding the eﬃcacy of apps (based on diﬀerent theoretical
orientations, not only CBT) in patients with a diagnosis of
depression, including another intervention (active control group)

as a comparative group1; (b) studies written in English and
published in peer-reviewed indexed journals up to June 12, 2021;
(c) studies conducted in adult and/or adolescent populations with
a primary diagnosis of MDD or another depressive disorder,
with any clinical severity, reported by a health professional in
accordance with the current psychiatric classiﬁcations of the ICD
(International Classiﬁcation of Diseases) or DSM (Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), in any edition2;
and (d) use of a smartphone-delivered digital intervention. The
exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) studies that were not
a clinical trial, such as narrative or systematic reviews, meta-
analyses, protocols, case series, congress conferences, and short
communications, (b) studies carried out in populations without
a diagnosis of mental disorder (or a diagnosis not reported
by a health professional) or analog study, (c) studies including
patients with depression and other clinical comorbidities (unless
the primary diagnosis was a depressive disorder), (d) studies
that did not include a smartphone app (i.e., computers, website
intervention) as an intervention group. No temporal ﬁlter was
used; thus, all evidence to date was screened up to June 12, 2021.
Ethical approval was not required since this was a systematic
review of published studies.

Search Strategy
The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases
were searched until June 12, 2021 to conduct this systematic
review. The search strategy employed in these databases
was
(“Depression” OR “Depressive”) AND (“App” OR
“Smartphone”). To meet the inclusion criteria, diﬀerent ﬁlters
were applied to each of the three databases (ﬁlters are available
upon request from the corresponding author). Additionally, an
informal manual search through Google Scholar was performed
to identify possible articles of interest.

Study Selection Process
The study selection was conducted in four phases. First, in
the identiﬁcation phase, articles were identiﬁed from the three
databases, and duplicates were removed. Second, in the screening
phase, the titles and abstracts of articles meeting the inclusion
criteria were reviewed. When there were disagreements in the
screening process, full texts were assessed independently by AH-
G, MJV-F, NA-G, and GL. Finally, in the eligibility and inclusion
phases, articles were examined entirely and ﬁnally selected for
inclusion in the systematic review.

These data were coded independently by the authors and
included in a previously standardized designed template to
register homogeneously all the information for the analysis,
synthesis, and interpretation of the results. Any disagreement in
the data recorded was resolved through a reasoned discussion
until a consensus was reached.

RESULTS

Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected.
Figure 1 shows the selection process of the articles included in
this systematic review. The main characteristics of the selected
studies are shown in Table 1.

The seven studies included a total of 651 patients. All of the
participants were adults, and their weighted average age was
35.49 years. In six of the selected articles, the patients had a
diagnosis of MDD (according to the ICD-10, DSM-IV or DSM-
5), whereas in one of the articles, the diagnosis was other speciﬁed
depressive disorder [according to the DSM-5; (25)]. The average
percentage of females was 69.52%.

Type of Intervention, Components, and
Control Group
Five of the seven studies were based on elements of CBT
[i.e., cognitive restructuring and psychoeducation; (25, 28–31)].
One of these aforementioned articles included components
of CBT in conjunction with third-generation therapies, such
as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Mindfulness-
Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Behavioral Activation
Therapy [BA; (29)]. Two of the seven studies included BA in
the app intervention (26, 27). Five of the interventions explicitly
included psychoeducation components (26–30), whereas four
incorporated some kind of self-registration (26–28, 30). Six of
the seven articles selected applied interventions that allowed
some degree of asynchronous support by a therapist, often
on an exceptional basis (26–31). Last, Mantani et al. (28)
included a CBT-based smartphone app in combination with an
antidepressant switch.

Regarding control groups, the intervention was face-to-face
in one of the seven studies included (27). On the other hand,
two of the seven studies used smartphone-delivered digital
interventions as a control group; one of them consisted of
daily monitoring of mood and sleep quality and quantity
(25), and the other included mindfulness techniques (26).
Additionally, Tønning et al. (30) employed a standard treatment
in combination with a smartphone app (which only allowed for
the collection of objective data, with no access to content) as
a control group. Watts et al. (31) used the computer-delivered
“Get Happy Program”, while Mantani et al. (28) applied an
antidepressant medication switch in the control group. In two of
the selected studies, the app intervention was compared to the
treatment as usual (TAU) in the pertinent country (29, 30).

Number of Assessments
Regarding the number of assessments over time, the results
were variable. Most studies made three measurements over time
(26, 27, 30, 31). Hur et al. (25) included two measurements
(at baseline and three weeks after using the app), whereas Ly
et al. (26) took ten measurements of depressive symptomatology
assessed by the PHQ-9 and ten measurements of experiential
avoidance assessed by the AQQ-II. In the study by Ly et al. (27)

Smartphone Apps in Patients With Depressive Disorders

depressive symptomatology was measured by means of the PHQ-
9 thirteen times. Watts et al. (31) recorded four measurements
of depressive symptomatology as assessed by the PHQ-9 and
four indicators of nonspeciﬁc psychological distress, as assessed
by the K-10 measure. Both Mantani et al. (28) and Raevuori
et al. (29) recorded ﬁve measurements of their outcome variables.
Despite the diﬀerence in the timing of the measurements,
six studies incorporated at least one follow-up measurement
(26–31).

Efﬁcacy on Depressive Symptomatology,
Symptom Severity, Recovery, and
Readmissions
Only Mantani et al. (28) found that patients who used an
app on their smartphones had a greater improvement
in
their depressive symptomatology compared to the control
group. However, six studies found no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in depressive symptomatology between patients who used an
app compared to those in the control group (25–27, 29–31).
It is noteworthy that three of these six studies found within-
group improvements in depressive symptomatology in both
the app intervention and the control group. In the study by
Hur et al. (25), there was a signiﬁcant reduction in BDI-II
scores within both the app intervention group and the control
group (which also used an app, although only for recording
mood state and sleep quantity and quality) after three weeks.
Something similar was observed in the study conducted by Ly
et al. (26), who found large within-group size eﬀects in depressive
symptomatology in both the app intervention group and control
group (i.e., app based on mindfulness). In this same vein, Watts
et al. (31) found signiﬁcant diﬀerences within both groups
(i.e., the app intervention group and the same intervention in
a computer version) in depressive symptoms assessed by the
PHQ-9 and the BDI-II. Finally, one outstanding result is that
of the research conducted by Ly et al. (26), who found that
the severity of initial depression could moderate the degree of
response to the interventions. In patients with higher levels of
depression (assessed using the PHQ-9), BA intervention was
found to be superior to a mindfulness intervention; whereas
in patients with lower levels of depression, the mindfulness-
based intervention was found to be more eﬀective than the
BA intervention.

Regarding symptom severity, no signiﬁcant improvement was
shown in either of the two studies that measured it (30, 31). For
its part, in the research of Tønning et al. (30) an improvement in
the number of readmissions or in their duration was not shown.
Lastly, one of the three studies that analyzed the recovery
rates found results favoring the eﬃcacy of apps. Tønning
et al. (30) found a signiﬁcant improvement in recovery in
the app intervention group compared to the control group.
The study by Ly et al. (26) revealed signiﬁcant recovery
rates for both groups (BA intervention app and mindfulness
intervention app), although there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between them. Similarly, Ly et al. (27) found no diﬀerences
between the app intervention group and control group in terms
of recovery.

Effectiveness on Quality of Life

the ﬁve studies that assessed the quality of life of patients
(25–27, 29, 30).

signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the

Experiential Avoidance
In the two studies that assessed experiential avoidance, no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the app intervention group and
control group were found (26, 27).

Efﬁcacy on Psychological Distress,
Perceived Stress, and Anxious Symptoms
Regarding psychological distress, in the study by Watts et al.
(31), it was found that patients who used an app on their
smartphones signiﬁcantly improved in this variable. However, in
this study, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found when
the app intervention group was compared to the control group.
In relation to perceived stress, Raevuori et al. (29) found that the
reduction in this variable in the intervention group was greater
than that in the control group when measured at 20 and 32
weeks. Tønning et al. (30) found no diﬀerences in perceived stress
between the app intervention group and control group. Finally, in
the study by Hur et al. (25), a signiﬁcant change in anxiety level
was observed in the intervention group, compared to the control
group, after a 3-week period of using the app. Nonetheless, no
signiﬁcant improvement in anxious symptomatology was found
in any of the other three studies that assessed it (26, 27, 29).

Efﬁcacy on Other Outcome Variables
In a study using an intervention based on mindfulness, it was
found that patients who used an app on their smartphones
signiﬁcantly improved both the internalization of mindfulness
skills and their levels of resilience compared to the control
group (29). Mantani et al. (28) observed that CBT participants
experienced a lower burden of side eﬀects in the total sample
analysis, although this diﬀerence was not statistically signiﬁcant
compared to the control group. In the per-protocol sample
analysis, the reduction in the burden of side eﬀects in the app
intervention was signiﬁcant. Hur et al. (25) found a signiﬁcant
improvement in dysfunctional attitudes after a 3-week period
of using the app in the intervention group, compared to the
control group.

Finally, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in
self-esteem (25); sleep disturbances (29); empowerment (30);
rumination (30); worrying (30); frequency, intensity, and burden
of side eﬀects [total sample, (28)]; psychosocial functioning (30);
number of depressive episodes (30); wellbeing (30), satisfaction
with care (30); adherence to medication (30); and BA (30)
between the app intervention group and control group in the
studies that included these variables.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the eﬃcacy
of smartphone apps in patients with depressive disorders. After
reviewing the seven articles included in this article, it can be

Hernández-Gómez et al.

Smartphone Apps in Patients With Depressive Disorders

concluded that the use of apps does not reduce depressive
symptomatology nor improve the quality of life in patients
diagnosed with depressive disorders when compared to an active
control group. However, the eﬀect of these interventions on
perceived stress and anxious symptomatology remains unclear.
The studies are characterized by a considerable degree of clinical
and methodological heterogeneity, making it diﬃcult to draw
ﬁrm conclusions.

Regarding the eﬃcacy of apps on depressive symptomatology,
the analyzed studies show that app interventions do not reduce
depressive symptoms in depressed patients when compared to
an active control group. Only the study by Mantani et al.
(28) found an improvement
in depressive symptoms in a
smartphone app intervention group, compared to a control
group. However, in six of the seven studies of this review,
no signiﬁcant changes in depressive symptoms were observed
in the app intervention group when compared to an active
control group. When interpreting this result, the considerable
level of heterogeneity among the selected studies should be taken
into account. Diﬀerent methodologies were used in the selected
studies (including the application of diﬀerent interventions,
the combination of their components without verifying which
ones were responsible for their eﬃcacy, and the diﬀerent
measurements used at diﬀerent times of the intervention and
at diﬀerent follow-up periods), and they include participants
with diﬀerent clinical characteristics (e.g., clinical severity).
Furthermore, as noted by Kerst et al. (32), most studies include
some sort of clinical support—although the vast majority is
minimal, which makes it diﬃcult to verify the unique eﬀect of
app interventions.

eﬃcacy of CBT-based apps

The ﬁndings of this review contrast with those of Hrynyschyn
and Dockweiler (16), who found contradictory results on
the
in reducing depressive
symptomatology in patients with mild or moderate depression,
and highlight the considerable degree of heterogeneity of the
articles included in their work. The review of these authors only
included studies from 2015 onward, which only analyzed the
eﬃcacy of CBT-based apps in patients with mild to moderate
depression (who in the majority of studies were recruited from
a cutoﬀ score on a depressive symptom questionnaire). Unlike
the work of Hrynyschyn and Dockweiler (16), in this review,
we consider studies published over a longer period of time, in
which patients with a depressive disorder (diagnosed by a health
professional) took part and received diﬀerent types of treatment
(including pharmacological treatment).

The results of this systematic review are not consistent with
those of Serrano-Ripoll et al. (17), who found that app-based
interventions resulted in a moderate reduction in depressive
symptoms. These authors included in their meta-analysis
participants with depressive symptoms, which in some studies
had not necessarily been diagnosed by a health professional.
In terms of interpreting the ﬁndings of Serrano-Ripoll (17),
we should be taking into account that these authors analyzed
studies comparing an app intervention group to a non-active
control group, which could account
found.
App interventions rarely outperform active interventions [i.e.,
therapeutic interventions acting as an active control group;

for the eﬀect

(6, 33)]. In our systematic review, we only included studies
comparing an app intervention group to an active control
group, which could make it diﬃcult to identify any signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the interventions. In fact, there are studies
included in our systematic review that incorporate apps in
both the intervention and control group, and although they
do not ﬁnd diﬀerences between the conditions, within-group
improvements in both the intervention group and the control
group in depressive symptoms (25, 26) are observed. Watts
et al. (31) also found signiﬁcant within-group improvement
in the app intervention in relation to depressive symptoms
(though they found no diﬀerences between the app and the
same intervention in a computer-based version). The fact that
within-group improvements in app intervention groups have
been observed oﬀers promise for future treatments. Another
diﬀerence between our systematic review and that of Serrano-
Ripoll et al. (17) is that our work only involves patients with
depressive disorders diagnosed by a health professional. This
allows us to ensure that the sample of patients between the
diﬀerent studies is as homogeneous as possible.

Regarding the eﬀectiveness of the apps on quality of life,
this variable did not improve signiﬁcantly in any of the ﬁve
studies that measured it. Therefore, the results of our review
suggest that the app intervention does not appear to improve
the quality of life in depressed patients. However, these results
are tentative and should be regarded with caution. Hrynyschyn
and Dockweiler (16) outline that the eﬃcacy of app interventions
in improving quality of life is inconclusive. We, however, state
that it is possible that longer follow-up periods are required to
detect improvements in the quality of life of depressive patients
who are undergoing an app intervention. In this way, patients
could apply the skills learned and achieve changes in their
daily life.

With regard to the eﬃcacy of apps for reducing perceived
stress and anxiety, the results are unclear. A reduction in
perceived stress was only signiﬁcant in the study by Raevuori
et al. (29), whereas Tønning et al. (30) found no signiﬁcant
improvement in perceived stress. Thus, no conclusions can
be established. Additionally, a signiﬁcant improvement in the
reduction of anxious symptoms was found in only one (25) of
the four studies that analyzed this variable. This is not consistent
with the eﬃcacy of apps to reduce anxiety in meta-analytic
studies (15). As is the case with depressive symptomatology, it
may be diﬃcult to detect signiﬁcant improvements in anxiety
when an app intervention group is compared with an active
control group. Finally, our results are in line with the ﬁndings
of the review by Hrynyschyn and Dockweiler (16), who found
contradictory results regarding the eﬃcacy of apps to reduce
anxiety in depressive patients. Therefore, the results regarding
the eﬃcacy of apps in reducing anxious symptoms in depressive
patients are inconsistent.

In relation to experiential avoidance, in two of the seven
studies that measured this variable, no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the app intervention group and control group were
found. To the best of our knowledge, this variable has not
been extensively explored in studies that employ apps to treat
depression. Taking into account the rise of third-generation

therapies (34), it is possible that in the coming years more studies
will consider this variable.

it

is worth highlighting that

With regard to other outcome variables, the studies analyze
very diﬀerent variables, which makes it diﬃcult to draw ﬁrm
conclusions. However,
in the
study by Mantani et al. (28),
in their per-protocol sample,
there was a lower burden of side eﬀects in the intervention
group than in the control group at nine weeks. Although
this was only analyzed in one study, it opens the possibility
treatment. The
of combining apps with pharmacological
combination of treatments (i.e., app + medication) could be
suitable for patients who do not respond to antidepressant
treatment or who experience signiﬁcant side eﬀects while taking
medication (28).

it diﬃcult

This systematic review has the following limitations. First,
the selected articles showed a considerable degree of clinical
and methodological heterogeneity, which explains the disparity
in the results and makes
to draw any ﬁrm
conclusions. For example, the selected studies use diﬀerent
treatments;
include various components (e.g., mindfulness,
BA) without knowing which ones are responsible for the
eﬃcacy; use diﬀerent measurement instruments (at diﬀerent
time points), diﬀerent app interventions, and diﬀerent control
conditions; and include depressed patients with varying levels
of clinical severity. This heterogeneity has also been found
in studies that analyze the eﬃcacy of app interventions (16,
17). In this review, we attempted to reduce heterogeneity by
selecting studies conducted in clinical patients with depression
diagnosed by a health professional. Second, although most
studies use the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II to assess depressive
symptomatology, other authors use diﬀerent
instruments,
to analyze the results regarding
which makes it diﬃcult
the main variable of
interest. Third, only English-language
studies were considered; therefore, language bias could not be
ruled out.

The costs in social and public health policies associated with
depression are high in all countries and continue to grow (4),
and apps are accessible tools for most citizens. Despite the
ﬁndings of our systematic review, we consider that the potential
beneﬁcial eﬀect of apps merits investigation in future studies
since they represent a low-cost and potentially far-reaching
intervention of interest in the public health system. If they are
shown to be eﬀective, they could represent an opportunity for
the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders. To date,
however, the increased use of these interventions in clinical
practice has not been accompanied by an increase in any
associated scientiﬁc evidence (35), which generates a certain
degree of mistrust on the part of users and professionals when
it comes to recommending such interventions. In the future,
it will be necessary to continue looking into the eﬃcacy of
apps for depressive patients and explore the mechanisms of
change and moderators of the eﬃcacy of the intervention (e.g.,
gender, age, socioeconomic and educational levels, symptom
severity, medication, therapist-guided or unguided). Studies that
aimed to address this question have not been able to identify
moderating variables (6). To determine the mediators of change,
it will be necessary to carry out dismantling studies that consider

the components of the treatment in isolation (alone and/or in
combination). Another step will be to analyze the eﬃcacy of
apps based on diﬀerent eﬀective treatments (e.g., psychotherapy
and medication) and the role that apps play in changing the
pharmacological treatment received by patients. Taking into
account that intervention via apps is often applied to patients
with subclinical depressive symptoms, it will be necessary to
look into the eﬃcacy of these interventions not only at an
intervention level but also at a prevention level. Given the
considerable degree of heterogeneity observed in the studies,
it will be necessary to reﬁne clinical trial methodology in the
coming years.

According to the

On the other hand, in regard to applying apps in the clinical
setting, some barriers have been found, such as a lack of
engagement, which could explain the high dropout rates in some
studies (36). Finding strategies that improve adherence to these
interventions—such as oﬀering feedback by a professional, daily
monitoring of mood, or applying the principles of behavioral
economics (15)—is a pending issue (36). In addition,
the
protection of personal data is a widespread problem when using
apps to treat depressive disorders (14, 37) and is an important
issue to consider. Multidisciplinary teams (e.g., psychologists,
psychiatrists, computer scientists) should work on this issue.
Lastly, the eﬃcacy of using apps as a complementary intervention
to the usual pharmacological and/or psychological treatment
should be analyzed. It is possible that the inclusion of apps in
conventional treatments could improve adherence to them (38).

suicide, the use of an app could be of interest for suicide
prevention (41) as well as to facilitate professional contact in
emergency situations. However, the use of apps in patients
at risk of suicide should always be complementary to usual
treatment, and should support, but not replace, professional
judgment (42). Lastly, we must not forget that, to date, app
interventions cannot be regarded as a single treatment or be
indiscriminately recommended.
