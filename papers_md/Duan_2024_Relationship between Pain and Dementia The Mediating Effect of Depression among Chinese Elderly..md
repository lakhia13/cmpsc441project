Abstract

Background: Chronic pain poses a significant prob-
lem for older adults and may potentially impact cognitive
function. This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional
relationship between pain severity and cognitive function
in elderly individuals residing in the community. Addition-
ally, this study sought to examine the mediating effect of
depression on the relationship between pain and dementia.

Methods: The study sample was derived from
the 2018 China Health and Aging Longitudinal Study
(CHARLS), comprising cross-sectional data from 4559
community residents aged 65 years or older. The primary
outcome assessed was the occurrence of dementia, while
the main independent variable was pain severity (none, lit-
tle, somewhat, quite a bit, very). Depression score served as
the mediating factor. Chi-square and binary logistic regres-
sion analyses were performed to examine the relationship
between depression and the occurrence of pain and demen-
tia. An intermediate model was constructed by stepwise
regression.

Results: The study indicates a significant association
between cognitive impairment and both chronic pain and
depressive symptoms in older adults living in China. Indi-
viduals who frequently report experiencing pain exhibit a
higher likelihood of developing dementia when compared
to those who do not report any pain (odds ratio (OR) = 1.72,
p < 0.001). Moreover, depressive symptoms significantly
mediate the relationship between pain and dementia, with
the mediating effect accounting for 65.25%.

Conclusions: Chronic pain not only directly impacts
patients’ cognitive function but also indirectly exacerbates
cognitive impairment through depressive symptoms as a
mediating variable. For elderly individuals experiencing
depressive symptoms, it is important to provide appropriate
psychological treatment in conjunction with pain manage-
ment strategies.

Background

Pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation and emo-
tional response associated with real or potential tissue dam-
age. When pain persists or recurs for more than 3 months,
it is characterized as chronic pain [1]. Its occurrence and
development involve biological, psychological, and so-
cial factors, posing significant challenges to both physi-
cal and mental well-being. As individuals age, degener-
ative changes in various bodily systems and the presence
of multiple diseases contribute to a higher prevalence of
chronic pain among the elderly [2,3]. According to statis-
tics, chronic pain affects 25%–50% of the global popula-
tion, with rates as high as 83% among elderly individuals
in nursing homes [4].

Chronic pain is characterized by abnormal sensory
processes and is closely linked to cognitive, emotional,
and social dysfunction [5]. Among older adults, chronic
pain interferes with daily functioning and often leads to se-
vere physical disability and impaired mobility. Moreover,
chronic pain is documented as one of the primary contrib-
utors to disability and medical consultations among the el-

derly [6–8]. Despite its significant impact, pain in the el-
derly is often overlooked and underestimated. Alarmingly,
more than one-third of patients with persistent pain do not
receive analgesic treatment [9], which has a serious impact
on their health, daily functioning, and overall quality of life.

Cognitive decline is a neurodegenerative condition
that becomes evident as individuals age, with dementia rep-
resenting the most severe manifestation. The increase in
the age and number of populations is expected to increase
the prevalence of dementia, exerting significant adverse ef-
fects on families, societies, and healthcare systems world-
wide [10,11]. Research indicates that interventions target-
ing modifiable risk factors could potentially reduce demen-
tia incidence by up to 40% [12]. Prior studies have con-
firmed the association between cognitive impairment and
several diseases marked by chronic pain as the predomi-
nant symptom, including fibromyalgia (FM), diabetic neu-
ropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and migraine [13–18]. More
than 50% of patients with chronic pain exhibit impaired at-
tention [19,20], particularly notable in those with neuro-
pathic pain and fibromyalgia. These individuals demon-
strate lower cognitive screening scores and difficulties with
memory and executive function [18,21].

Research has indicated that individuals with chronic
pain often experience depression and other negative emo-
tions [22,23]. Furthermore, individuals with chronic pain
and concurrent depression tend to experience more signifi-
cant functional decline, reduced treatment responsiveness,
and higher healthcare costs [24]. Several studies have es-
tablished a notable link between depression and cognitive
decline [25,26]. While previous research has clarified the
relationship between pain, cognition, and depression, few
studies have investigated the potential mediating role of de-
pression in the association between pain and cognitive im-
pairment.

Studying the impact of pain intensity on cognitive
function holds significant potential for risk stratification
and informing the development of early interventions for
cognitive impairment. Consequently, this study aims to ex-
amine the relationship between pain and cognitive function
among elderly individuals in the community, aiming to de-
termine whether pain serves as a risk factor for cognitive de-
cline. Additionally, the study will investigate whether de-
pression mediates the relationship between pain and cogni-
tive function in elderly individuals through mediating anal-
ysis. Moreover, this research aims to clarify the interre-
lationships among pain, depression, and cognitive func-
tion, aiming to provide a scientific foundation and prac-
tical guidance for preventing and intervening in cognitive
decline among elderly individuals in community settings.

Ultimately, the goal is to reduce cognitive decline and its
associated adverse outcomes, thereby improving physical
function and quality of life among the elderly.

Materials and Methods

Study Population and Sampling

This study utilized data from the 2018 China Health
and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS https://char
ls.charlsdata.com/pages/data/111/zh-cn.html). A baseline
survey was conducted in 1988, followed by eight subse-
quent surveys from 2000 to 2018. The study involved indi-
viduals aged 65 and older in 22 provinces, municipalities,
and autonomous regions across China, using questionnaires
and household surveys as the primary data collection meth-
ods.

Based on the purpose of this study, the exclusion cri-
teria for the selection of participants are as follows: (1) age
<65 years old; (2) no pain and depressive symptoms data;
(3) no age, sex, education, marital status, current residence,
current smoking, alcohol drinking, or chronic diseases in-
formation available for this group of individuals; (4) indi-
viduals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease.

After applying the aforementioned exclusion criteria,
we selected 4559 subjects from the original 17,708 individ-
uals who participated in the fourth wave of the CHARLS
for further analytical research.

Measures

Depressive Symptoms

A 10-item scale was developed to measure depressive
symptoms and is considered a simplified version of the de-
pression scale developed by Radolff at the National Institute
of Mental Health. The scale was developed using the 20
items from the geriatric depression scale, selecting the 10
most relevant items for diagnosing clinical depression [27].
A higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms.
Respondents rate the frequency of their experiences over
the past week on a scale of 1 to 4, with questions 5 and 8
designated for “Reverse Scoring”. This abbreviated scale
is more concise and efficient while maintaining efficacy in
depression screening.

Pain Assessment

Pain is an inherently subjective experience that can-
not be measured using physiological markers or biometrics.
Thus, pain assessment relies heavily on self-reports. Pain
characteristics were collected using self-reported questions.
In the CHARLS questionnaire, respondents were asked,
“Are you often troubled by any bodily pains?” Pain vari-
ables were divided into “yes” and “no”, with pain severity
classified as none, little, somewhat, quite a bit, or very.

Cognitive Status

Patient cognitive status was evaluated using the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. The MMSE is
widely used for clinical assessment of patients’ cognitive
function. It was initially developed by Folstein et al. [28] in
1975 and has since undergone several revisions and adap-
tations. Comprising 30 questions, the scale assesses vari-
ous cognitive domains including orientation, memory, at-
tention, calculation, recall, language, and visuospatial abil-
ity, yielding a total score of 30 [29,30]. Cut-off values for
dementia diagnosis on the MMSE were established based
on the participants’ education levels: scores of ≤17 for il-
literate individuals, ≤20 for those with elementary school
education, and ≤24 for participants with middle school ed-
ucation and above.

Covariates

The covariates included various sociodemographic
characteristics of the respondents, including gender, age,
residence area (urban or town, rural), education (Unedu-
cated, primary school, Middle school, college or above),
marital status (unmarried,
including divorced and wid-
owed), past/current smoking (yes or no), past/current alco-
hol consumption (yes or no), and chronic diseases such as
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

Statistical Analysis

The study used IBM SPSS version 25.0 (Chicago, IL,
USA) for all statistical analyses. Categorical variables were
expressed as frequencies and percentages and analyzed by
chi-square analyses, while continuous variables were ex-
pressed as mean (M) ± standard deviation (SD) and ana-
lyzed by independent-sample T-tests. Logistic regression
was used to analyze the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) for the cross-sectional associations be-
tween pain and dementia at baseline. Specifically, a binary

logistic regression analysis was conducted with dementia as
the dependent variable and pain severity as the independent
variable. The regression models were constructed in a step-
wise manner, incorporating various covariates.
Initially,
Model 1 included pain as the sole predictor. Model 2 in-
corporated additional covariates such as age, sex, urbanity,
education level, marital status, education, smoking, alcohol
consumption, and hyperlipemia. Model 3 further included
the depression scale. To demonstrate the correlation be-
tween pain, depressive symptoms, and cognitive function,
a stepwise regression method was used to analyze the inter-
mediary effect. Initially, a linear regression model was es-
tablished to examine the relationship between pain and cog-
nitive function. Subsequently, depression symptoms were
included as mediating variables to assess whether the im-
pact of pain on cognitive function was attenuated or elim-
inated. If the effect of pain on cognitive function dimin-
ishes or disappears in the presence of depressive symptoms,
it suggests that depressive symptoms act as a mediator be-
tween pain and cognitive function. Statistical significance
was considered at p < 0.05 for all statistical analyses.

Results

Among the 4559 respondents, the mean age was 71
± 5.28 years, with 2373 males (52.1%) and 2186 females
(47.9%). A total of 2731 individuals reported experiencing
pain, representing 59.9% of the total. Among the 2731 re-
porting pain, 1531 (56.1%) were women. Additionally, 353
individuals reported frequent pain, representing 7.7% of the
total respondents, while 1380 elderly individuals were af-
fected by dementia, accounting for 30.3% of the total. As
indicated in Table 1, individuals diagnosed with dementia
were significantly older on average (p < 0.001), more likely
to be female (p < 0.001), unmarried (p < 0.001), residing in
rural areas (p < 0.001), had lower levels of education (p <
0.001), higher depression scores (p < 0.001), and a history
of regular alcohol and smoke consumption (p < 0.001).

The findings from the binary logistic regression anal-
ysis indicated a higher likelihood of dementia development
among individuals who frequently reported experiencing
pain compared to those who did not report any pain (OR
= 1.72, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the association between
pain and dementia persisted even after controlling for de-
mographic variables, chronic illnesses, and other relevant
factors, as shown in Table 2. However, upon inclusion
of depression scores in the model, the association between
pain and dementia was attenuated and lost statistical signif-
icance.

To gain a deeper understanding of the correlation be-
tween pain and dementia, we analyzed the mediating effects
of pain, depression, and cognitive function scores (Fig. 1).
The results of the linear regression analysis indicated a sig-
nificant negative correlation between pain scores and cog-
nitive function scores (C = –0.155, p < 0.001). Addition-
ally, a notable positive correlation was observed between
the pain score and depression score (a = 0.389, p < 0.001).
When including the depression score into the regression
model examining the association between pain score and
cognitive function score, the regression coefficient of pain
on cognitive function decreased but remained statistically
significant (C’ = –0.054, p < 0.001). Additionally, a signif-
icant association was observed between depressive symp-
tom score and frailty score (b = –0.260, p < 0.001). After
assessing multicollinearity in the aforementioned models,
it was determined that the Tolerance values exceeded 0.2
and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) remained below 5,
suggesting the absence of multicollinearity among the vari-
ables in the model. The results indicated that depressive

symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between
pain and dementia, with the mediating effect accounting for
65.25%.

Discussion

The results of our study indicate a significant associ-
ation between cognitive impairment and both chronic pain
and depressive symptoms in elderly adults in China. Fur-
thermore, it was found that depressive symptoms played a
partial mediating role in the relationship between chronic
pain and cognitive function.

The study revealed that 59.9% of individuals aged 65
and above have encountered pain, with 7.7% frequently
reporting pain. Of note, the prevalence of pain was no-
tably higher among women compared to men, consistent
with prior research findings. This gender difference may
be attributed to physiological differences, as women tend
to exhibit increased pain perception and reaction. Addition-

ally, women may also experience unique types of pain, such
as menstrual pain, childbirth, and breastfeeding. More-
over, women’s heightened susceptibility to emotional fac-
tors may exacerbate or trigger chronic pain compared to
men [31,32]. Despite the evident prevalence of pain among
the elderly community, there has been insufficient focus on
the diagnosis and treatment of pain [9], leading to its fre-
quent neglect or delayed management.

Previous research, both cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal studies, has demonstrated an association between
chronic pain and cognitive function.
In a longitudinal
study tracking cognitive trajectories among individuals in
American neighborhoods, participants experiencing persis-

tent pain exhibited a 9.2% decline in memory scores over
time, with a corresponding 7.7% higher dementia preva-
lence compared to those without such pain [33]. Similarly,
a study in Taiwan found that individuals aged 50 and above
experiencing pain had an increased risk of dementia com-
pared to those without pain (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]:
1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15–1.26) [34]. The
findings of our study align with previous research, reveal-
ing elevated pain levels among older adults with dementia
compared to cognitively normal older adults. Further anal-
ysis revealed a notable association between pain and cog-
nitive function, indicating lower cognitive function scores
in elderly adults experiencing pain. Chronic pain has been
identified as a risk factor for cognitive decline; however,

the biological mechanism through which pain induces cog-
nitive impairment remains unclear. Prior studies suggest a
potential link between cognitive decline in individuals with
chronic pain and alterations in the volume of gray matter
in the brain [35]. Individuals enduring chronic pain exhibit
diminished cortical gray matter in the bilateral dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), thalamus, brainstem, primary
somatosensory cortex (S1), and posterior parietal cortex,
alongside atypical brain functional patterns associated with
cognitive functions [36]. These changes result in a decrease
in cognitive function. However, pain treatment can lead to a
significant increase in cortical thickness in affected regions
and a return to baseline levels of functional brain activities
[37]. Moreover, chronic pain-induced dysfunction of the
LC-NE system can result in cognitive and emotional be-
havioral abnormalities [38]. Additionally, chronic pain can
elevate microglia activation and neuroinflammation, which
is considered contributing factors to Alzheimer’s disease
pathogenesis [39,40].

Although the limitations of our study precluded con-
firmation of the aforementioned potential biological mech-
anisms, our mediating analysis revealed that depressive
symptoms partially mediate the link between pain and cog-
nition. This finding offers an alternative perspective on
how pain contributes to cognitive impairment. Previous re-
search suggests that individuals experiencing pain are more
likely to develop depression or anxiety disorders [22]. Fur-
thermore, the quantity of pain sites, pain severity, and pain
frequency have emerged as the most reliable indicators of
depression in elderly adults within the general population
[41,42]. Psychological and epidemiological studies have
also established a correlation between the exacerbation of
depressive symptoms in elderly adults and the deterioration
of cognitive function. Depressive symptoms are recognized
as a risk factor for the progression of mild cognitive impair-
ment to dementia. Additionally, negative emotions, sleep
disorders are also considered to be precursors of cognitive
function decline [42–44]. This observation aligns with our
research results. In conclusion, it can be inferred that per-
sistent chronic pain may result in depression and contribute
to cognitive deterioration in the elderly population.

This study elucidated the correlation between pain, de-
pressive symptoms, and cognitive function in elderly Chi-
nese adults. This discovery holds significant implications
for both public health policy and clinical practice.

Assessing and managing pain in community residents
is a complex undertaking that necessitates the use of more
comprehensive and reliable tools for accurately identifying
pain. Additionally, it requires a multidimensional approach
to pain management. The effective management of pain

should be considered an essential component of both pre-
ventive and interventional strategies for addressing cogni-
tive impairment in the elderly. Particularly for older indi-
viduals exhibiting symptoms of depression, it is essential
to implement appropriate psychological treatment measures
alongside pain management.

The study’s strength lies in its substantial sample size
and strong representativeness. However, the study is still
subject to certain limitations. Due to the cross-sectional
study design, this investigation was unable to establish a
causal relationship between the different variables. Future
longitudinal studies are necessary to verify the association
more comprehensively between pain and cognitive impair-
ment, and to elucidate its underlying mechanism. Further-
more, the present study did not evaluate the specific pain lo-
cation, pain duration, or the type of pain relief treatment re-
ceived by the elderly. Subsequent research endeavors could
incorporate these factors to enhance comprehension of the
association between pain and cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

In this study, we identified a significant negative cor-
relation between pain severity in elderly adults and their
current cognitive function. After adjusting for confound-
ing variables, we observed a notable increase in the risk of
cognitive impairment among elderly individuals experienc-
ing frequent pain. Furthermore, our findings reveal that de-
pression, often comorbid in older adults, is more prevalent
among those who frequently experience pain, further ex-
acerbating the risk of cognitive impairment. Additionally,
depression partially mediates the relationship between pain
and cognitive impairment. There is a necessity to advocate
for regular pain assessment and prompt implementation of
pain management and psychological interventions. These
measures could potentially delay cognitive decline and sup-
port the process of healthy aging.
