ABSTRACT
Supporting individuals to develop adaptive coping strategies is critical to improve health and wellbeing. A history of nonsuicidal 
self- harm (NSSI) is linked with increased risk of maladaptive coping strategies. We aimed to identify whether emotion regulation 
(ER) mediated the relationship between historical NSSI behaviours and coping strategy use in adults from the general popula-
tion. Participants reported their lifetime frequency of NSSI; then they completed self- report measures of emotion regulation, mal-
adaptive coping strategy use (behavioural disengagement, self- blame and substance use) and adaptive coping strategy use (active 
coping, instrumental support use and emotional support use). Regression analyses investigated relationships between historical 
NSSI and coping strategies, with mediation analysis testing for the mediating role of ER. A total of 303 individuals participated: 
180 with a history of NSSI and 123 without. Results indicated that poor emotion regulation mediated the relationship between 
having a history of NSSI and the use of maladaptive coping strategies; however, there was no notable association between adap-
tive coping strategies and historical NSSI. These findings highlight the necessity for ER development in people with a history of 
NSSI and suggest important avenues for future research, including exploring the role of ER to support NSSI cessation.

1   |   Introduction

Mental health problems cost the United Kingdom £117.9 billion 
in 2019, largely due to loss of productivity in employment and 
informal  care  costs  (McDaid  and  Park  2022).  There  is  a  well- 
established connection between experiencing high levels of stress 
and  increased  risk  of  poor  mental  health.  Understanding  and 
improving  stress  coping  mechanisms  may  have  important  im-
plications for improving mental health outcomes (Thoits 2010). 
Richard Lazarus (1966) defined coping as a way of cognitively 
or behaviourally responding to demands that are viewed as tax-
ing  for  the  individual.  Our  appraisal  of  these  demands  can  be 
influenced by the effectiveness of our coping response (Lazarus 
and  Folkman  1984).  Coping  strategies  are  often  divided  into 
adaptive  (improving  wellbeing  and  resilience  through  healthy 
behaviours) or maladaptive (hindering wellbeing and resilience 

through  unhealthy  behaviours)  (Dijkstra  and  Homan  2016). 
Maladaptive  coping  strategies  have  been  associated  with 
lower  psychological  wellbeing  (Lehavot  2012).  Whereas  adap-
tive coping strategies may build resilience to stress (Earnshaw 
et al. 2015). Understanding the contributing and consequential 
factors for the use of certain coping strategies can inform future 
research on improving mental health- related outcomes and re-
duce its economic impact.

Although there are over 400 identified subtypes of both adap-
tive  and  maladaptive  coping  responses  (Skinner  et  al.  2003), 
there  is  growing  evidence  highlighting  the  importance  of 
nonsuicidal  self- injury  (NSSI;  Nock  2009),  behavioural 
disengagement  (Carver  et  al.  1989),  self- blame  (Ullman 
et al. 2014), substance misuse (Carver et al. 1989), active cop-
ing  (Flouri  and  Mavroveli  2013),  emotional  support  seeking

(Döveling  2015)  and  instrumental  support  seeking  (Lobel 
et al. 2014) as particularly relevant for understanding mental 
health problems (Budimir 2021; Gurvich et al. 2021). NSSI is 
defined as the direct and deliberate harm caused to one's own 
body without suicidal intent (Nock 2009) and has been found 
to be strongly associated with other maladaptive coping strat-
egies  (Sorgi  et  al.  2021),  such  as  behavioural  disengagement 
(Nock and Mendes 2008) and self- blame (Kelada et al. 2018). 
Both  cannabis  and  alcohol  use  are  reported  to  have  positive 
relationships  with  NSSI  (Bresin  and  Mekawi  2022;  Escelsior 
et  al.  2021;  Turner  et  al.  2022),  with  self- harm  during  ado-
lescence being a predictor for future substance use in young 
adulthood (Moran et al. 2015).

Active  coping  occurs  when  individuals  make  direct  and  ef-
fortful  attempts  to  remove  or  respond  to  the  stressor  (Carver 
et  al.  1989).  Emotional  support  seeking  involves  individuals 
seeking  emotional  support  and  understanding  from  others 
(Carver et al. 1989). Instrumental support seeking involves in-
dividuals  seeking  advice  or  assistance  regarding  the  stressor 
(Carver  et  al.  1989).  Active  coping  is  reported  to  have  a  nega-
tive  relationship  with  NSSI,  as  well  as  with  NSSI  frequency 
(Chapman et al. 2014). Reports in older adults show that their 
perceptions of never receiving emotional support are positively 
related to hospitalizations for self- harm, and that seeking sup-
port  predicts  less  self- harm  in  adolescent  samples,  although 
this was specific to social support rather than emotional (Shaw 
et  al.  2021).  Similarly,  in  adolescent  samples,  instrumental 
help- seeking  for  self- harm  is  uncommon,  even  though  help  is 
likely wanted (Doyle et al. 2015; Michelmore and Hindley 2012). 
Relationships between NSSI and adaptive coping strategies have 
received considerably less attention despite their possible effects 
on resilience (Earnshaw et al. 2015).

Emotion  regulation  (ER)  may  be  a  crucial  factor  in  explain-
ing  the  link  between  NSSI  and  coping.  ER  is  the  ability  to  re-
spond healthily to emotions to control their duration, intensity 
and  expression  (Gratz  and  Roemer  2004;  Rolston  and  Lloyd- 
Richardson 2016). The ability- based model of ER proposes that 
there  are  abilities  that  help  facilitate  and  create  the  potential 
for  ER  (Gratz  and  Roemer  2004;  Naragon- Gainey  et  al.  2017). 
Maladaptive  coping  strategies  may  only  temporarily  regulate 
emotions,  doing  so  superficially  and  without  full  resolution 
of  the  emotion,  often  impacting  negatively  on  life  experiences 
(Midkiff et al. 2018). Research has found that ER is associated 
with active coping (Flouri and Mavroveli 2013), emotional sup-
port seeking (Döveling 2015), and instrumental support seeking 
(Flouri and Mavroveli 2013; Lobel et al. 2014), and difficulties in 
emotion regulation (DER) are associated with behavioural dis-
engagement (Kahn et al. 2022), self- blame (Ullman et al. 2014), 
and substance use (Garke et al. 2021; Weiss et al. 2022). However, 
child and adolescent samples have dominated much of the cop-
ing literature (e.g., Doyle et al. 2015; Flouri and Mavroveli 2013; 
Garke  et  al.  2021;  Michelmore  and  Hindley  2012;  Nock  and 
Mendes 2008).

Reasons behind engaging in NSSI can vary from individual to 
individual  (Edmondson  et  al.  2016),  but  most  often  its  func-
tion  serves  to  reduce  negative  affect  through  ER  (Brereton 
and  McGlinchey  2020;  Hasking  et  al.  2017).  The  notion  that 
ER  is  the  primary  driving  force  of  NSSI  has  been  suggested 

and included in models, such as the four- factor model of NSSI 
by Nock and Prinstein (2004). Davis et al. (2014) asked adult 
participants  with  and  without  a  history  of  deliberate  self- 
harm (DSH) to watch a sad film clip and self- report negative 
emotions  with  and  without  implementing  reappraisal  as  an 
emotion regulation ability. Their results demonstrated DER is 
correlated with having a history of DSH; however, there was no 
distinction between those who had recently engaged in DSH 
and  those  who  no  longer  engage  in  DSH.  Evidence  has  sug-
gested  these  two  groups  have  significant  differences  in  their 
ER.  For  example,  Zielinski  et  al.  (2018)  collected  self- report 
measures of NSSI recency and DER and found that those who 
are currently self- injuring display greater DER than those who 
have engaged in NSSI previously. However, again, they miss 
important comparisons with individuals who have no history 
of  NSSI.  Such  research  reports  individuals  with  current  or 
past NSSI engagement experience more DER than those with-
out  a  history  (Anderson  and  Crowther  2012),  and  that  these 
individuals without a history of NSSI have greater ER instead 
(Nielsen et al. 2017). There have also been further distinctions 
within NSSI involving frequency. Researchers have explored 
this  relationship  and  share  similar  findings  showing  greater 
DER  is  associated  with  increased  NSSI/self- harm  frequency 
(Davis et al. 2014; Zielinski et al. 2018).

The  current  study  addresses  the  complex  interplay  between 
NSSI,  ER  and  coping  (Clapham  and  Brausch  2022),  offering 
an original contribution to the literature by exploring the me-
diating  role  of  ER  between  NSSI  and  both  maladaptive  and 
adaptive  coping  strategies  (Clapham  and  Brausch  2022).  It 
is  beneficial  to  explore  potential  mediational  effects  ER  may 
have  in  the  relationship  between  historical  NSSI  behaviours 
and current maladaptive and adaptive coping strategies to in-
form future research and mental health support. While prior 
work has often focused on clinical or adolescent samples, this 
study  extends  the  literature  by  assessing  whether  these  rela-
tionships persist in a community- based context. Results may 
differ from those in clinical samples due to underlying psychi-
atric morbidity and high severity symptom experiences in clin-
ical  populations.  Some  studies  have  included  control  groups 
in clinical samples for NSSI, but often these have low sample 
sizes  (Tschan  et  al.  2015).  Therefore,  increased  information 
about NSSI in the general population is needed. Moreover, the 
proposed mediation model in the current paper adds mecha-
nistic  insight  into  how  emotional  functioning  might  sustain 
maladaptive coping, even after NSSI cessation. These distinc-
tions  enhance  the  applicability  of  findings  to  early  interven-
tion and preventative care settings.

It is hypothesized that:

1.  The  presence  of  historical  NSSI  and  higher  frequency  of 
NSSI will predict increased use of the maladaptive coping 
strategies: behavioural disengagement, self- blame and sub-
stance use.

2.  The absence of historical NSSI will predict increased use 
of the adaptive coping strategies: active coping, emotional 
support seeking and instrumental support seeking.

3.  The  presence  of  historical  NSSI  and  higher  frequency  of 

NSSI will be associated with poorer ER.

behaviours  and  both  maladaptive  and  adaptive  coping 
strategies.

2   |   Methods

2.1   |   Sample

In  this  cross- sectional  study,  data  were  collected  via  Qualtrics 
surveys  through  opportunity  sampling  from  social  network-
ing  sites,  University  of  Sussex  staff  and  student  circulars,  and 
leading  mental  health  organizations.  Recruitment  lasted  from 
April  to  December  2022.  This  study  was  ethically  approved 
by  the  Sciences  &  Technology  Cross- Schools  Research  Ethics 
Committee at the University of Sussex (ER/FM409/2).

Individuals needed to meet the following criteria to participate: 
reside in the United Kingdom, be at least 18 years old, have not 
engaged in self- injury within the past 12 months, and not be dis-
tressed by topics of NSSI or substance use. It was important for 
participants to have not self- injured within the past 12 months 
as people's ER has been found to significantly differ depending 
on  the  recency  of  their  last  self- injury  (Zielinski  et  al.  2018). 
Power  calculation  was  based  on  multiple  linear  regression 
conducted  to  detect  an  association  between  the  presence  of 
historical  NSSI  and  the  use  of  adaptive  or  maladaptive  coping 
strategies. Assuming an alpha of 0.05, power at 80%, and adjust-
ment for two covariates, a sample size of at least 80 people per 
NSSI group (with/without a history of NSSI) would be required 
(Faul et al. 2007).

2.2   |   Measures

2.2.1   |   Demographics

Participants  reported  on  their  age  and  gender  as  categorical 
variables. They selected their age from the following categories: 
18–29 years  old,  30–39 years  old,  40–49 years  old,  50–59 years 
old,  and  60 years  or  older.  Participants  indicated  their  gen-
der  by  choosing  from  the  following  categories:  Female,  Male, 
Nonbinary, Other and Prefer not to say.

2.2.2   |   Nonsuicidal Self- Injury

To  assess  NSSI,  the  Deliberate  Self- Harm  Inventory  (DSHI; 
Gratz 2001) was used. The DSHI is a 17- item questionnaire in-
volving an index question and five follow- up questions for each 
item.  Items  in  the  questionnaire  are  methods  of  DSH  that  are 
implemented into the index question. As methods of NSSI were 
not  being  explored,  all  items  were  combined  to  just  one  (‘hurt 
yourself?’).  Responses  were  either  ‘Yes’  or  ‘No’  A  response  of 
‘Yes’ resulted in further follow- up questions.

Firstly, addressing the recency of participants' last NSSI episode, 
options for this question were ‘Within the past 12 months’ and 
‘Over 12 months ago’. Participants indicating self- injury within 
the past 12 months were excluded from the analysis. The second 
follow- up question asked about frequency of NSSI. Options for 

this were limited to fixed choice ranges (‘1–5 times’, ‘6–10 times’, 
‘11+  times’)  to  avoid  extremely  high  self- reported  frequencies 
(Kapatais et al. 2022). This was implemented as those who have 
self- injured many times are more likely to be inaccurate in their 
estimation of total episodes compared with those who have self- 
injured  fewer  times  (Nielsen  et  al.  2016).  The  DSHI  has  been 
found to have adequate test re- test reliability over a mean period 
of 3.3 weeks (φ = 0.68, p < 0.001; Gratz 2001), and adequate con-
struct,  convergent,  and  discriminant  validity  (Gratz  2001).  In 
this study, it had good internal consistency (α = 0.87).

2.2.3   |   Emotion Regulation

Emotion  regulation  was  measured  using  the  Difficulties  in 
Emotion  Regulation  Scale  Short  Form  (DERS- SF;  Kaufman 
et al. 2016). The DERS- SF comprises of 18 items loaded onto six 
subscales. Each item is scored from 1 (Almost never (0%–10%)) 
to 5 (Almost always (91%–100%)), with exception for the reverse- 
coded items. Items were summed to create a total score (rang-
ing  from  18  to  90)  whereby  a  higher  score  represented  poorer 
emotion  regulation.  The  DERS- SF  has  comparable  concurrent 
validity to its original DER scale which demonstrated good test–
retest reliability and adequate construct and predictive validity 
(Gratz and Roemer 2004; Kaufman et al. 2016). In this study, it 
had good internal consistency (α = 0.84).

2.2.4   |   Maladaptive and Adaptive Coping Strategies

To  measure  both  maladaptive  and  adaptive  coping  strategies, 
the Brief Coping with Problems Experienced inventory (COPE; 
Carver  1997)  was  used.  The  Brief  COPE  inventory  includes  14 
scales with two items in each scale. Three scales were chosen for 
maladaptive coping strategies: behavioural disengagement, self- 
blame and substance use. Another three scales were chosen for 
adaptive  coping  strategies:  active  coping,  using  emotional  sup-
port and using instrumental support. Each item is scored from 
1 (I haven't been doing this at all) to 4 (I've been doing this a lot). 
Items were summed to create a total score for each scale (rang-
ing from 2 to 8) whereby a higher score represented more use of 
that coping strategy. Each scale had good internal consistency: 
behavioural disengagement (α = 0.76), self- blame (α = 0.80), sub-
stance  use  (α = 0.96),  active  coping  (α = 0.78),  using  emotional 
support (α = 0.86), and using instrumental support (α = 0.90). The 
Brief COPE inventory had comparable internal reliability to its 
original COPE inventory which demonstrated adequate conver-
gent and discriminant validity (Carver et al. 1989; Carver 1997).

2.3   |   Data Analysis

All  statistical  analyses  were  conducted  using  IBM  SPSS 
Statistics Version 28, with a significance threshold set at p < 0.05. 
Preliminary checks, alongside reference to the central limit the-
orem (Field 2018), confirmed that the assumptions of the linear 
model were satisfied, allowing analyses to proceed as planned.

To  address  Hypothesis  1,  linear  regression  analyses  were  per-
formed.  Separate  models  were  computed  with  NSSI  history 
and  NSSI  frequency  as  predictor  variables,  and  behavioural

disengagement, self- blame and substance use as outcome vari-
ables. All models were adjusted for age and gender.

with significance indicated by intervals that did not contain zero 
(Field 2018).

For Hypothesis 2, linear regression analyses were similarly con-
ducted, with NSSI history entered as the predictor variable and 
active coping, instrumental support and emotional support use 
as outcome variables. These models were also adjusted for age 
and gender.

Hypothesis  3  was  tested  using  independent  samples  t- tests, 
with  NSSI  history  and  NSSI  frequency  as  the  predictor  vari-
ables and difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) as the out-
come variable.

Finally, Hypothesis 4 was examined in two steps. First, Pearson's 
correlations with confidence intervals were calculated to assess 
the  relationships  between  DER  and  all  coping  strategy  vari-
ables.  Subsequently,  mediation  analyses  were  conducted  using 
the PROCESS macro (Hayes 2017), with NSSI history as the pre-
dictor, maladaptive coping strategies as the outcome variables, 
and  emotion  regulation  (ER)  as  the  mediator.  Mediation  anal-
yses followed the criteria outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986), 
requiring significant associations between the predictor, medi-
ator  and  outcome  variables.  The  significance  of  mediation  ef-
fects was determined using bootstrapped confidence intervals,

3.1   |   Participant Characteristics

Recruitment  resulted  in  407  potential  participants.  Fifteen 
(3.69%)  were  excluded  due  to  incomplete  data,  and  33  (8.11%) 
due  to  having  reported  NSSI  within  the  past  12 months  (mak-
ing them ineligible to participate), leaving a final sample of 303 
(74.45%) participants; 180 with a history of NSSI and 123 with-
out a history of NSSI. Only 24 respondents reported having en-
gaged in NSSI six- to- ten times. These responses were combined 
with the responses from those reporting NSSI one- to- five times 
to  create  a  new  group  consisting  of  those  having  self- injured 
one- to- ten times.

Table  1  presents  the  descriptive  statistics  for  all  study  vari-
ables.  In  comparison  with  those  with  no  history  of  NSSI, 
those with a history of NSSI were significantly more likely to 
be in the youngest age group (18–29 years), had higher DER, 
increased  behavioural  disengagement,  self- blame  and  sub-
stance use.

3.2   |   Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis 1.  The presence of historical NSSI, and higher 
frequency  of  NSSI,  will  predict  increased  use  of  maladaptive 
coping strategies.

Results of the linear regressions examining the relationships be-
tween a history of NSSI, frequency of NSSI, and the maladaptive 
coping strategies are reported in Table 2. There were significant 
relationships  between  NSSI  history  and  all  three  maladaptive 
coping  strategies  when  both  unadjusted  and  adjusted  for  age 
and gender from the p- values and 95% CIs. The b- values for the 
relationships between NSSI history and the maladaptive coping 
strategies  show  that  in  comparison  with  those  with  no  history 
of  NSSI,  a  history  of  NSSI  increases  these  maladaptive  coping 
strategies by less than one point on its 4- point Likert scale. There 
were  no  significant  relationships  between  NSSI  frequency  and 
the  maladaptive  coping  strategies  in  either  adjusted  or  unad-
justed models. The b- values for the relationships between NSSI 
frequency the maladaptive coping strategies show that compared 
with those with a smaller lifetime frequency of NSSI (one- to- ten 
times), those with a higher lifetime frequency of NSSI (11+ times) 
show increased use of the maladaptive coping strategies by less 
than one point on its 4- point Likert scale. The results from these 
regression analyses show partial support for Hypothesis 1.

Hypothesis  2.  The  absence  of  historical  NSSI  will  predict 
increased use of adaptive coping strategies.

Results  of  the  linear  regressions  examining  the  relationships 
between  NSSI  history  and  the  adaptive  coping  strategies  are 
reported  in  Table  3.  No  significant  relationships  between  a 
history of NSSI and the adaptive coping strategies were found. 
The  b- values  for  the  relationships  between  NSSI  history  and 
instrumental support use and emotional support use show that 
in comparison with those with no history of NSSI, a history of 
NSSI decreases the use of these adaptive coping strategies by less 
than one point on its 4- point Likert scale. The b- values for the 
relationship between NSSI history and active coping show oppo-
site results in that a history of NSSI, compared with no history, 
increases the use of this strategy by less than one point on its 4- 
point Likert scale. These are unsubstantial changes and overall 
show no support for Hypothesis 2.

Hypothesis 3.  The Presence of Historical NSSI, and Higher 
Frequency of NSSI, Will be Associated With Poorer ER.

The participants who have a history of NSSI compared with the 
participants  who  do  not  demonstrate  significantly  poorer  ER, 
t(301) = −5.21,  p < 0.001,  with  a  represented  medium  effect  of 
d = 0.61. Furthermore, participants who have a higher frequency 
of  NSSI  compared  with  participants  who  have  a  lower  fre-
quency also demonstrate significantly poorer ER, t(178) = −2.79, 
p = 0.006,  with  a  represented  smaller  effect  of  d = 0.43.  These 
results suggest that having a history of NSSI and increased fre-
quency  of  NSSI  is  related  to  poorer  ER,  providing  support  for 
Hypothesis 3.

Hypothesis  4.  ER  Will  Mediate  the  Relationship  Between 
Historical NSSI Behaviours and Coping Strategies.

Results of the correlations examining the relationships between 
DER  and  the  coping  strategies  are  reported  in  Table  4.  It  was 
found that DER has a significant, positive relationship with be-
havioural disengagement and substance use with medium effect 
sizes. There was also a significant, positive relationship between 
DER  and  self- blame  which  represents  a  large  effect.  DER  had 
a close to zero relationship with both instrumental support use 
and emotional support use, showing no significant relationship. 
However, DER had a small, positive and significant relationship 
with  active  coping.  These  correlations  provide  partial  support 
for Hypothesis 4.

Figure 1 reports results from mediation analyses where NSSI 
history  predicts  the  maladaptive  coping  strategies,  mediated 
by  poor  ER.  NSSI  history  significantly  predicted  poorer  ER, 
and poorer ER significantly predicted behavioural disengage-
ment,  self- blame  and  substance  use  whilst  controlling  for 
NSSI  history.  There  was  a  bigger  variance  of  the  model  ex-
plained by poorer ER on behavioural disengagement (14.70%), 
self- blame (28.95%) and substance use (14.10%) than there was 
for NSSI history on behavioural disengagement (1.76%), self- 
blame (3.58%) and substance use (4.48%). The direct effect of 
NSSI history on substance use whilst controlling for poor ER 
remained significant whereas its effect on behavioural disen-
gagement  and  self- blame  resulted  in  no  significant  results. 
The mediation analyses produced significant indirect effects 
of NSSI history on behavioural disengagement, self- blame and 
substance use through poor ER. These results provide partial 
support for Hypothesis 4.

4   |   Discussion

This study expanded previous research to examine the medi-
ational effects of ER between NSSI and coping strategies and 
include more insight into these topics within the adult general 
population.  We  identified  significant  relationships  between 
having  a  history  of  NSSI  and  the  maladaptive  coping  strate-
gies.  Having  a  history  of  NSSI,  but  not  increased  frequency 
of NSSI, increased the likelihood of using behavioural disen-
gagement,  self- blame  and  substances  to  cope.  These  results 
support  previous  literature  finding  NSSI  history  to  relate  to 
these maladaptive coping strategies (Bresin and Mekawi 2022; 
Escelsior  et  al.  2021;  Kelada  et  al.  2018;  Moran  et  al.  2015; 
Nock  and  Mendes  2008;  Turner  et  al.  2022).  Understanding 
why  increased  NSSI  frequency  does  not  increase  the  use  of 
these maladaptive coping strategies may be explained by how 
this  study  categorized  NSSI  frequency.  The  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM- 5;  American 
Psychiatric  Association  2022)  included  nonsuicidal  self- 
injury disorder (NSSID) as a criterion set requiring further re-
search. Their proposed frequency to meet a NSSID diagnosis 
is the engagement in NSSI over five or more days. Although a 
higher threshold may be warranted (Andover 2014; Washburn 
et  al.  2015),  it  suggests  that  the  NSSI  frequency  categories 
within  this  study  were  not  able  to  differentiate  between  his-
torically  clinical  and  subclinical  groups  of  people  who  en-
gaged  in  NSSI  due  to  overlap,  particularly  within  the  group 
that selected their engagement as ‘1–10 times’ (Muehlenkamp 
et  al.  2017).  Future  research  investigating  NSSI  frequency 
should consider this in their design.

We  did  not  find  evidence  of  an  association  between  having  a 
history of NSSI and using adaptive coping strategies. These re-
sults contradict our prediction and previous findings suggesting 
that NSSI is related to less use of these adaptive coping strate-
gies  (Chapman  et  al.  2014;  Doyle  et  al.  2015;  Michelmore  and 
Hindley 2012; Shaw et al. 2021). There are noteworthy parallels 
and  differences  between  our  findings  and  those  of  Chapman 
et  al.  (2014),  who  studied  incarcerated  women.  In  their  work, 
active coping was inversely associated with NSSI history. While 
our study found no significant associations between NSSI his-
tory and adaptive coping strategies, the contrast may be due to 
contextual differences: the stressors, environmental constraints 
and other available coping resources in prison settings may alter 
the functionality and accessibility of coping mechanisms (Luke 
et al. 2021). Moreover, Chapman et al. (2014) did not assess ER 
directly,  which  limits  the  mechanistic  interpretation.  Our  me-
diation model provides additional insight into the processes un-
derpinning coping behaviours in those with a history of NSSI.

Moving  from  adolescence  to  young  adulthood  comes  with 
maturation  of  neurological  systems  associated  with  improved 
judgement and management of behaviours, as well as increases 
in  social  and  emotional  stability  (Kim  and  Hur  2023;  Siegler 
et  al.  2020;  Whitlock  et  al.  2015).  This  current  study's  results 
demonstrate why it is important not to assume generalizability 
from other similar studies' significant findings when sampling 
from, or applying results to, different populations. However, the 
lack  of  demographic  diversity  within  this  current  study,  being 
largely  female  and  young  adults,  will  need  to  be  addressed  in 
future research.

We  found  that  having  a  history  of  NSSI,  as  well  as  a  lifetime 
frequency  of  11  times  or  more  for  NSSI,  was  related  to  poorer 
ER,  supporting  Hypothesis  3.  These  findings  support  pre-
vious  evidence  in  the  field  (Adrian  et  al.  2019;  Anderson  and 
Crowther 2012; Clapham and Brausch 2022; Davis et al. 2014; 
Kapatais  et  al.  2022;  Nielsen  et  al.  2017;  Zielinski  et  al.  2018). 
It  is  thought  that  the  potential  for  ER  has  underlying  disposi-
tional  abilities  which  could  explain  why  DER  persists  beyond 
NSSI cessation and is occurring within this sample (Gratz and 
Roemer 2004; Wolff et al. 2019). However, it also appears poorer 
ER presents more in those with a higher lifetime frequency of 
NSSI. Alongside its potential dispositional nature, Daukantaité 
et al. (2021) reported in a longitudinal study that repetitive NSSI 
during adolescence predicted DER ten years later. Furthermore,

FIGURE 1    |    Model illustrating the relationship between NSSI history and maladaptive coping strategies, mediated by poor emotion regulation 
(ER). The confidence interval for the indirect effect is a bias- corrected and accelerated bootstrapped CI based on 5000 samples; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001.

there may also be differences between these groups as to their 
perceptions of their own ER abilities. Mettler et al. (2021) found 
those with a history of NSSI to have reported greater DER than 
those  without  a  history  of  NSSI.  However,  interestingly,  both 
groups experienced similar negative affect elicitation in response 
to an in vivo mood induction task, perhaps suggesting their self- 
reported  differences  could  be  due  to  subjective  interpretations 
of their emotional experiences and their perceived sensitivity to 
intense  feelings  rather  than  a  reflection  of  their  actual  coping 
abilities (Mettler et al. 2021). Although this current study did not 
examine the DERS- SF subscales, there are links between histor-
ical NSSI and the intensity of emotional experiences and limited 
access to ER strategies (Anderson and Crowther 2012). Further 
research is necessary to explore whether differences in ER can 
be  attributed  to  perceptions  of  one's  own  ER  abilities  between 
these groups and to understand the reasons behind it.

It is also important to consider the potential developmental tra-
jectory  of  emotional  regulation.  The  finding  that  younger  par-
ticipants were more likely to report ER difficulties may reflect 
normative age- related changes, as previous research shows ER 
abilities improve with maturity (Compas et al. 2017). However, 
our models statistically adjusted for age, suggesting that the ob-
served associations with NSSI history reflect more than devel-
opmental stage. Nonetheless, longitudinal research is warranted 
to determine whether these ER difficulties persist or diminish 
over time.

The main findings of this study from Hypothesis 4 highlighted 
that poor ER mediates the relationship between historical NSSI 
and maladaptive coping. This suggests that having a history of 
NSSI is associated with poor ER, which in turn predicts the use 
of  behavioural  disengagement,  self- blame  and  substances  as 
ways  of  coping.  This  supports  existing  literature  with  similar 
findings (Flouri and Mavroveli 2013; Garke et al. 2021; Ullman 

et al. 2014; Weiss et al. 2022). However, it also suggests DER is 
not  associated  with  using  instrumental  support  nor  emotional 
support.  These  findings  were  not  expected,  considering  previ-
ous research to the contrary (Bailey et al. 2016; Criss et al. 2016; 
Döveling  2015;  Flouri  and  Mavroveli  2013;  Lobel  et  al.  2014; 
Tambling et al. 2023). Poorer ER is associated with greater men-
tal  health  difficulties,  and  healthy  ER  is  associated  with  less 
(Aldao et al. 2010; Barlow et al. 2017; Ludwig et al. 2019). The 
relevance of poor ER lies within its contribution to the develop-
ment, maintenance and treatment of mental health difficulties, 
with these relationships potentially varying by type of psycho-
pathology  (Aldao  et  al.  2010;  Berking  and  Wupperman  2012). 
Others have also argued this relationship is bidirectional, sug-
gesting DER can be both symptomatic and predictive of mental 
health  difficulties  (Dawel  et  al.  2021).  Mental  health  also  has 
strong  links  to  coping.  The  presence  of  psychopathology  has 
consistent associations with increased use of maladaptive cop-
ing strategies compared with adaptive coping strategies and may 
also  occur  because  of  maladaptive  coping  (Cohen  et  al.  2020; 
Compas et al. 2017; Richardson et al. 2021). The role of psycho-
pathology  shows  likely  confounding  effects  between  ER  and 
coping  and  may  explain  the  findings  reported  in  the  present 
study. Further research should take care to consider including 
potentially confounding variables such as this into their study to 
ensure true effects of ER on coping are being observed.

4.1   |   Strengths, Limitations and Future Directions

This study represents a unique examination of the interplay be-
tween  NSSI,  ER  and  coping  in  an  adult  population.  Other  re-
search has often related each of these variables together but has 
rarely tried to combine them all into one model. It furthermore 
expanded  this  research  to  adults  from  the  general  population, 
who are typically overlooked compared to paediatric and clinical

samples. We used well- validated measures of psychological con-
structs of coping, ER and NSSI. Finally, recruitment via social 
media provided the potential for a wide variety of demographic 
characteristics in participants, and its use helped utilize limited 
recruitment time efficiently (Allsworth 2015; Bartell 2014).

Despite  the  strengths  of  our  approach,  the  cross- sectional  de-
sign and the correlational analyses of this study limit causal and 
longitudinal inferences from the results (Setia 2016). It cannot 
be  determined  whether  poorer  ER  associated  with  those  with 
a history of NSSI indicates: (a) any kind of increase or decrease 
in their ability for ER from when they were currently engaging 
in NSSI (residual symptom), or (b) a long- term pattern of poor 
ER which reflects subgroups of those who stop self- injuring over 
time  (premorbid  trait;  Brown  et  al.  2007).  Future  research  is 
needed  to  investigate  the  path  of  ER  during  current  NSSI  and 
after  its  cessation  through  longitudinal  designs  to  better  un-
derstand this relationship and examine potential causality. It is 
important to highlight that individuals who had engaged in self- 
injury within the past 12 months were excluded from this study. 
While this criterion was implemented to minimize participant 
distress and ensure ethical compliance, it may have resulted in a 
sample that differs in clinically meaningful ways from currently 
self- harming individuals. Recent evidence (Zielinski et al. 2018) 
indicates  that  ER  difficulties  can  differ  significantly  between 
current and former NSSI users. Therefore, the exclusion of peo-
ple  with  recent  self- harm  likely  constrained  variability  in  ER 
and coping resources, potentially attenuating some associations. 
Future  research,  including  both  current  and  former  NSSI  par-
ticipants, is needed to understand temporal changes in ER and 
coping strategies.

Furthermore,  the  present  study  is  limited  in  generalizing  its 
findings to the investigation of NSSI, ER and coping in young, 
female adults. Gender imbalance in NSSI research is an unfor-
tunately common limitation which brings concern, as there are 
reported gender differences in NSSI behaviours, as well as in ER 
and coping (Bresin and Schoenleber 2015; Cipriano et al. 2017; 
Moritz  et  al.  2016;  Zimmermann  and  Iwanski  2014).  Future 
research is needed to ensure a balance of genders within these 
groups and a sample representing the ages of the general popu-
lation. In addition to the previously discussed future directions, 
it  would  benefit  the  literature  to  continue  exploring  NSSI  as  a 
predictor  variable.  There  is  further  scope  to  understand  NSSI 
from its onset, duration, last episode, methods, severity of inju-
ries and cessation, and its implications for not only ER and cur-
rent coping but also other related outcomes. Finally, this study 
investigated only a few coping strategies, and so there is room to 
continue exploring NSSI and ER with other strategies.

In  a  recent  review  by  Warner  and  Murphy  (2022),  DBT- ST 
was  generally  found  to  reduce  substance  use  and  increase  ER 
for  people  with  substance  use  disorder.  Although  their  review 
did not provide firm evidence for the acceptability and feasibil-
ity of DBT- ST, research such as this present study continues to 
demonstrate the need for ER enhancement in treatment options, 
especially  for  those  who  cope  maladaptively  or  have  a  history 
of  NSSI.  The  current  study's  results  also  suggest  a  need  to  de-
velop NHS self- help resources for ER that can be made widely 
available (e.g., through their website) as a potential step before 
primary care involvement (see National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence (2011) for their stepped- care model). Most NHS 
resources for ER skills focus on children and young people and 
their families with little targeting towards adults. Considering 
the need for psychological help among these groups studied, it 
could help ease caseloads for services and reduce its associated 
economic impact by helping people earlier.

5   |   Conclusion

NSSI  and  other  maladaptive  coping  strategies  have  appeared  to 
be a common phenomenon among a variety of groups and most 
often with significant impairments. Notwithstanding some limita-
tions, the current study presents a novel attempt to understand the 
role of ER between historical NSSI behaviours and current coping 
strategies. It provides meaningful implications for future research 
and intervention development. This study aimed to focus on adult 
samples from the general population to further our understanding 
of these topics compared to the commonly researched paediatric 
samples. The main results showed that having poor ER mediated 
the relationship between having a history of NSSI and the use of 
behavioural disengagement, self- blame and substance use. Future 
research  considers  methodological  improvements  as  well  as  the 
need  to  understand  these  relationships  longitudinally.  Clinical 
implications derived from these findings suggest the importance 
of continuing ER- based intervention development and providing 
earlier access to resources for ER skills. It is hoped the results and 
insights put forward by this present study can contribute success-
fully to these fields.

Data Availability Statement

The results from this study add preliminary support for employ-
ing Dialectical Behaviour Therapy skills training (DBT- ST) for 
individuals whose behaviours cause mental distress and physi-
cal harm, as people with a history of NSSI are more likely to have 
poorer  ER,  which  results  in  coping  maladaptively  than  those 
without a history of NSSI. DBT- ST aims to replace maladaptive 
behaviours with goal- oriented behaviours through four primary 
skills,  including  ER  skills  (Cavicchioli  et  al.  2021;  Eist  2015).
