AbstrAct: Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness that often develops in childhood, affects 1%–2% of the population, 
and causes significant impairment across the lifespan. The first step in identifying and treating OCD is a thorough evidence-based assessment. This paper 
reviews the administration pragmatics, psychometric properties, and limitations of commonly used assessment measures for adults and youths with OCD. 
This includes diagnostic interviews, clinician-administered symptom severity scales, self-report measures, and parent/child measures. Additionally, adjunc-
tive measures that assess important related factors (ie, impairment, family accommodation, and insight) are also discussed. This paper concludes with recom-
mendations for an evidence-based assessment based on individualized assessment goals that include generating an OCD diagnosis, determining symptom 
severity, and monitoring treatment progress.

Introduction
A comprehensive evidence-based assessment is a critical step in 
accurately identifying the presence and severity of obsessive– 
compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  in  both  clinical  and  research 
practice. Obsessive–compulsive symptoms can be difficult to 
assess,  given  that  they  are  often  manifested  internally,  and 
individuals with OCD may not be inclined to recognize and 
report  symptoms  (ie,  limited  insight).  In  response  to  these 
challenges, this paper reviews commonly used OCD measures 
that have been examined in research studies to enhance clini-
cians’  abilities  to  detect  and  monitor  OCD  symptom  sever-
ity  during  assessment  and  treatment.  First,  the  pragmatics 
of  measure  administration  and  psychometric  properties  are 
reviewed. Clinician-rated measures are discussed initially, fol-
lowed by adult self-report measures, and finally parent/child 
measures. Second, the incorporation of additional important 
factors  in  an  evidence-based  OCD  assessment  is  discussed 
(ie, impairment, family accommodation, and insight). Finally, 
this paper concludes with recommendations for an evidence-
based  assessment  based  on  individualized  assessment  goals 
and empirical support.

Several factors are important to consider when develo ping 
an evidence-based assessment battery. First, one must identify 

the primary aim of the assessment and prioritize measures in 
line with this goal. For example, measures with strong diag-
nostic  sensitivity  might  be  prioritized  when  screening  for 
symptoms. Comparatively, when confronted with a differential 
diagnosis (eg, distinguishing OCD from an anxiety disorder 
or  depression),  diagnostic  specificity  would  take  precedence. 
Similarly, when monitoring changes in symptom severity dur-
ing treatment, reliance on assessment tools with demonstrated 
treatment sensitivity would be prioritized. Thus, a pragmatic 
framework is useful to inform measure selection to meet the 
aforementioned aims. Within this framework, the clinician is 
guided by knowledge of what tool may be most useful, feasi-
ble, and accurate in a specific situation.1,2 Accordingly, famil-
iarity with the armamentarium of evidence-based assessment 
measures for OCD meaningfully enhances a provider’s ability 
to select the appropriate measure to detect and/or monitor the 
treatment of this disorder.

When  describing  the  psychometric  properties  of  the 
measures  included  in  this  review,  the  following  criteria  were 
used to benchmark categorizations of reliability and validity.3,4 
Psychometric  evaluation  of  reliability  was  based  on  internal 
consistency, interrater reliability, and test–retest reliability. For 
internal consistency, α values $0.90 were considered excellent,

0.80–0.89  were  considered  good,  0.70–0.79  were  considered 
fair, and ,0.70 were considered poor. Excellent interrater reli-
ability  was  considered  to  be  an  intraclass  correlation  (ICC) 
value of 0.75–1.00. Lower ICC value ranges represented good 
(0.60–0.74), fair (0.40–0.59), and poor (,0.40) interrater reli-
ability.  For  test–retest  reliability,  a  correlation  of  $0.80  was 
considered  good,  with  values  of  0.70–0.79  and  ,0.70  repre-
senting acceptable and poor test–retest reliability, respectively. 
Psychometric  evaluation  of  validity  was  based  on  convergent 
and discriminant validity. Good convergent validity was con-
sidered a correlation value of .0.50 between the rating scale and 
other measures of obsessive–compulsive symptoms and severity. 
Correlation values of 0.30–0.49 and 0.10–0.29 repre sented fair 
and poor convergent validity, respectively. Good discriminant 
validity was represented by correlations of 0.10–0.29 between 
the  rating  scale  and  measures  of  nonobsessive–compulsive 
symptoms and severity. Correlation values that exceeded this 
range were considered fair (0.30–0.49) and poor (.0.50) dis-
criminant  validity.  Treatment  sensitivity  was  classified  by 
statistically  significant  reductions  in  symptoms  following  an 
evidence-based treatment.

Making an ocd diagnosis
In  order  to  determine  if  a  patient  meets  DSM-5  diagnostic 
criteria for OCD, the patient must experience the presence of 
recurrent,  unwanted,  and  intrusive  thoughts  (ie,  obsessions) 
and/or repetitive behaviors or rituals (ie, compulsions) intended 
to  relieve  the  fear,  anxiety,  and/or  distress  associated  with 
obsessions.5  Additionally,  obsessions  and  compulsions  must 
cause significant distress and impairment in social, academic, 
and/or family functioning.5 While diagnostic assessments are 
often conducted as free-form unstructured clinical interview, 
there  are  several  standardized  structured  or  semi-structured 
interviews  that  have  several  advantages.  Standardized  inter-
views show psychometric superiority, higher validity, and less 
subjectivity and are more comprehensive compared to unstruc-
tured  interviews.6–10  Also,  when  differential  diagnoses  are  a 
concern,  the  administration  of  relevant  diagnostic  modules 
from standardized interviews can assist with diagnostic clari-
fication.  However,  these  interviews  typically  increase  patient 
and  clinician  burden  as  they  can  require  one  to  three  hours 
to administer, depending on the diagnostic categories in ques-
tion. While free-form clinical interviews are the most common 
method  for  determining  an  OCD  diagnosis  in  clinical  prac-
tice,  standardized  interviews  are  generally  used  in  research. 
When an individual’s presentation is complex and differential 
diagnoses are a concern, there is benefit to using standardized 
interviews in clinical practice as well. Most extant diagnostic 
interviews  are  derived  from  DSM-IV  criteria,  including  the 
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS), 
Anxiety  Disorders  Interview  Schedule  for  DSM-IV:  Child 
and  Parent  Versions  (ADIS-C/P),  and  Structured  Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), although 
more  recently,  updated  versions  of  these  measures  have  been

published to reflect changes in the DSM-V (eg, ADIS-V and 
SCID-V – Clinician Version).11–15 The ADIS possesses strong 
psychometric  properties,  shows  excellent  discrimination 
among  anxiety  disorders,  and  can  reliably  produce  an  OCD 
diagnosis.11,12,16,17  Shortcomings  of  the  measure  include  lim-
ited focus on other nonanxiety disorders (eg, psychosis), which 
may be considered as a differential diagnosis. The SCID-I also 
shows good psychometric properties; however, some research 
has criticized the measure’s ability to produce clinically mean-
ingful information specific to OCD.13,18–21 A third structured 
interview,  the  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Inter-
view  (MINI)  for  DSM-IV,  has  also  been  validated  in  adult 
and  youth  samples,  and  a  version  revised  in  accordance  with 
DSM-V is available for use with adults.22,23

clinician-rated Measures of ocd symptom 
severity

yale–brown  obsessive–compulsive  scale.  The  Yale–
Brown  Obsessive–Compulsive  Scale  (Y-BOCS)  comprises  a 
Symptom  Checklist  and  Severity  Scale  to  consecutively  rate 
obsessions and compulsions (see Table 1).24,25 The Symptom 
Checklist  includes  54  common  obsessions  and  compulsive 
behaviors,  which  are  grouped  according  to  thematic  content 
(eg,  contamination  and  aggression)  or  behavioral  expression 
(eg, checking and washing). Symptoms that are endorsed over 
the past week are then globally rated by the clinician using a 
five-point  scale  ranging  from  0  (none)  to  4  (extreme)  across 
five dimensions: (1) time/frequency, (2) interference, (3) dis-
tress,  (4)  resistance,  and  (5)  degree  of  control  (see  Table  1). 
Obsessive  and  compulsive  symptom  severity  are  rated  sepa-
rately (scores range from 0 to 25) with these scores summed to 
create a total OCD severity score (range, 0–50). The Y-BOCS 
also includes single-item ratings of insight, avoidance, indeci-
siveness,  responsibility,  pervasive  slowness,  and  doubting  on 
the 0–4 point scale, but these ratings are not included in sever-
ity scores and are less often used. The following score clusters 
approximately  map  onto  symptom  severity:  mild  symptoms 
(0–13), moderate symptoms (14–25), moderate–severe symp-
toms (26–34), and severe symptoms (35–40).26

The  Y-BOCS  is  considered  the  gold  standard  assess-
ment  tool  for  OCD  symptom  severity  and  possesses  good 
psychometric  properties  (see  Table  1).27,28  The  Y-BOCS 
Total  Severity  score  shows  good  internal  consistency,  excel-
lent interrater reliability, and good test–retest reliability over 
a  two-week  interval.25,29,30  Additionally,  the  Y-BOCS  dem-
onstrates good to fair convergent validity with clinician-rated 
measures  of  OCD  impairment  and  self-reported  obsessive–
compulsive  symptoms.29  Furthermore,  the  Y-BOCS  Total 
Severity score has demonstrated treatment sensitivity to medi-
cation and evidence-based psychotherapy treatment.31 Bench-
marks for defining treatment response have been suggested to 
be 30%–35% reductions in Y-BOCS Total Severity score, and 
40%–55% for diagnostic remission.32,33 At this level of symp-
tom  reduction,  some  research  supports  high  sensitivity  and

specificity,  with  over  90%  of  responders  and  nonresponders 
correctly classified.34

Despite its widespread use, at least two recognized criti-
cisms of the Y-BOCS exist. First, some evidence suggests that 
the  Y-BOCS  has  low  discriminant  validity  with  depression, 
as it exhibits moderate-to-strong correlations with depression 
severity (see Table 1).20,29,35 In part, this may be attributed to 
the  high  comorbidity  between  OCD  and  depression,  with 
some  studies  suggesting  that  25%–50%  of  individuals  with 
OCD  experience  co-occurring  Major  Depressive  Disorder 
(MDD).35–37 Second, the Y-BOCS has demonstrated incon-
sistent  factor  structure  across  several  studies.  While  some 
factor analytic studies support the initial two-factor (ie, obses-
sions and compulsions) structure, others have found evidence 
for a “disturbance factor” and a “symptom severity factor,” and 
a  three-factor  structure  comprised  “severity  of  obsessions,” 
“severity of compulsions,” and “resistance to symptoms.”29,38–42 
Despite  these  criticisms,  the  Y-BOCS  is  widely  used  across 
settings and continues to serve as the gold standard measure 
of OCD severity.

yale–brown  obsessive–compulsive  scale  –  second 
edition.  The  Yale–Brown  Obsessive–Compulsive  Scale  – 
Second  Edition  (Y-BOCS-II)  was  created  in  response  to 
advancements in the understanding of OCD phenomenology 
and  in  an  attempt  to  address  psychometric  criticisms  of  the 
Y-BOCS.43,44 The Y-BOCS-II retains the Symptom Check-
list  and  Severity  Scale,  but  includes  several  important  revi-
sions to the ordering and detail of item anchors. Benchmarks 
for  clinically  significant  symptoms  are  consistent  with  those 
for the Y-BOCS.

First,  the  Symptom  Checklist  includes  the  consecu-
tive  assessment  of  obsessions  and  compulsions,  as  well  as  a 
more inclusive range of obsessive–compulsive symptoms with 
examples. Specifically, revisions have been made to: (1) better 
capture  discomfort  that  some  individuals  experience  unless 
rituals are completed just right, (2) provide enhanced explana-
tions and examples of anchors, and (3) remove a priori symp-
tom headings.45,46 Second, active avoidance behaviors that are 
commonly seen in adults with OCD are also included in the 
Symptom Checklist. The Y-BOCS-II considers active avoid-
ance behaviors as compulsions and, in doing so, accounts for 
minimization of overt compulsions that may result from lack 
of contact with triggering stimuli. Last, ancillary items from 
the  original  Y-BOCS  were  removed  or  incorporated  in  the 
Symptom Checklist.

The Y-BOCS-II Severity Scale includes changes to the 
items  administered  (ie,  an  updated  “obsession-free  interval” 
item  is  included  in  lieu  of  the  original  “resistance  against 
obsessions”  items),  better  incorporation  of  behavioral  avoid-
ance, and expansion of the rating scale to range from 0 to 5 
(0  =  none,  …  4  =  very  severe,  5  =  extreme).  In  revising  the 
range of the Severity Scale items, these adjustments provide 
greater severity distinction and treatment sensitivity for indi-
viduals with high OCD severity.

Journal of Central nervous system Disease 2016:8

The  Y-BOCS-II  Total  Severity  score  exhibits  strong 
psychometric properties (see Table 1). Research suggests good 
to excellent internal consistency, excellent interrater reliability, 
and good short-term test–retest reliability.44,47–49 Additionally, 
it shows good convergence with other clinician-rated measures 
of OCD severity, and good discriminant validity from mea-
sures  of  worry  and  impulsivity.  Discriminant  validity  from 
depression  is  fair.44,47–49  The  Y-BOCS-II  shows  preliminary 
support for treatment sensitivity in a case report, with further 
examination in a large treatment sample needed.50,51 Sensitiv-
ity of the Y-BOCS-II has been shown to be very high (ie, 85% 
of OCD patients correctly identified) with comparably lower 
specificity (ie, 62%–70% of individuals with non-OCD diag-
noses correctly identified as not having OCD).52

The Y-BOCS-II incorporates phenomenological advances in 
understanding OCD and psychometrically strives to better dif-
ferentiate from depression compared to the original Y-BOCS. 
Despite  these  considerable  improvements,  the  Y-BOCS-II 
still has mixed support for its proposed factor structure. For 
example,  although  the  authors  of  the  Y-BOCS-II  propose  a 
two-factor structure of obsessions and compulsions, one study 
identified a two-factor structure comprising symptom severity 
and interference from symptoms.44,47,48

dimensional  yale–brown  obsessive–compulsive 
scale. The Dimensional Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive 
Scale (DY-BOCS) is a clinician-rated measure of dimension-
specific obsessive–compulsive symptom severity.53 First, individ-
uals are asked to rate the presence and severity of 88 obsessions 
and compulsions across the following domains: (1) harm, (2) 
scrupulosity, (3) symmetry/just right perception, (4) contami-
nation, (5) hoarding, and (6) miscellaneous (eg, superstitious 
beliefs and behaviors). Individuals also rate overall symptom 
severity in the past week on a scale ranging from 0 (no symp-
toms) to 10 (symptoms are extremely troublesome). Based on 
this initial self-report and semi-structured interviewing, clini-
cian ratings are then derived (see Table 1).

The DY-BOCS clinician-rated Global Severity scale shows 
good internal consistency and excellent interrater reliability (see 
Table 1).53,54 Convergent validity with clinician-rated measures 
of OCD severity is good; however, the DY-BOCS shows poor 
discriminant  validity  from  depression  and  measures  of  func-
tional impairment (see Table 1).53,54 Sensitivity and specificity 
of the measure have not been examined. The psychometric prop-
erties of the DY-BOCS have also been examined in a pediatric 
sample,  showing  excellent  internal  consistency  and  interrater 
reliability,  as  well  as  good  convergent  validity  with  clinician-
rated measures of OCD severity and good to fair discriminant 
validity from depression, tic severity, and withdrawal.55

children’s yale–brown obsessive–compulsive scale. 
The  Children’s  Yale–Brown  Obsessive–Compulsive  Scale 
(CY-BOCS)  is  a  semi-structured  interview  that  assesses 
the  presence  and  severity  of  OCD  in  children  and  parallels 
the Y-BOCS format, scoring, and interpretation (see Table 1).56 
While  similar  to  the  Y-BOCS  in  structure,  its  Symptom 

Checklist  was  adapted  for  developmental  appropriateness. 
Although ancillary items are included to assess insight, avoid-
ance,  indecisiveness,  responsibility,  pervasive  slowness,  and 
doubting, these items are not included  in  a  rating of  overall 
severity (see Table 1).

Like  the  Y-BOCS,  the  CY-BOCS  is  considered  the 
gold  standard  measure  for  assessment  of  severity  of  pediatric 
OCD. The CY-BOCS Severity score has demonstrated excel-
lent to fair internal consistency, excellent interrater reliability, 
and  good  to  adequate  short-term  test–retest  reliability  (see 
Table  1).56–58  The  CY-BOCS  shows  good  convergent  valid-
ity with clinician-rated measures of OCD severity, as well as 
good to fair discriminant validity from measures of anxiety, 
depression, and tic severity.56–58 Furthermore, the CY-BOCS 
Total  Severity  score  appears  to  be  responsive  to  evidence-
based  pharmacotherapy  and  psychotherapy  across  multiple 
trials.31,59 Positive treatment response corresponds with a 25% 
reduction in CY-BOCS total score, and a 45%–50% reduction 
in Total Severity score (or a Total Severity score ,15) is asso-
ciated with diagnostic remission.60 Sensitivity and specificity 
of the measure have not been examined.

Although  the  CY-BOCS  purports  a  two-factor  model 
of obsessions and compulsions, discrepancies also exist across 
factor  analytic  studies. While  there  is  support  for  the  origi-
nal  two-factor  structure  (obsessions  and  compulsions),  other 
studies have identified distinct two-factor models consisting 
of  severity  and  disturbance.58,61  These  mixed  findings  high-
light the need to revise the CY-BOCS in order to better incor-
porate  advancements  in  phenomenological  understanding  of 
the disorder and improve the factor structure.

National Institute of Mental Health-Global obsessive–
compulsive scale. The National Institute of Mental Health-
Global  Obsessive–Compulsive  Scale  (NIMH-GOCS)  is  a 
single-item rating to assess overall OCD severity on a scale from 
1 (minimal symptoms) to 15 (very severe).62 Severity levels are 
clustered into five groups that include: minimal severity (1–3), 
subclinical severity (4–6), clinical severity (7–9), severe clinical 
severity (10–12), and very severe clinical severity (13–15). The 
NIMH-GOCS  exhibits  excellent  interrater  reliability,  good 
short-term  test–retest  reliability,  and  good  convergent  valid-
ity  with  other  measures  of  OCD  severity  (see  Table  1).30,63 
The NIMH-GOCS has demonstrated treatment sensitivity in 
medication trials.62,64 Sensitivity and specificity of the measure 
have not been examined. Although findings regarding the psy-
chometric  properties  of  the  NIMH-GOCS  are  encouraging, 
critics have noted that the measure does not adequately capture 
dimensional aspects of symptomatology and requires a certain 
level of training and expertise for reliable ratings.20,30,65 Both 
shortcomings limit the clinical utility of this measure for those 
clinicians with less OCD experience.30

self-report Measures of ocd symptom severity

yale–brown obsessive–compulsive scale – self- report. 
The  Yale–Brown  Obsessive–Compulsive  Scale  –  Self-Report 

Assessment of OCD

(Y-BOCS-SR)  is  a  self-report  version  of  the  Y-BOCS 
and  consists  of  a  Symptom  Checklist  and  Severity  Scale  (see 
Table 2).66 Individuals are asked to identify the presence/absence 
of  obsessions  and  compulsions  on  the  Symptom  Checklist 
over the past week and rank the top three primary obsessive–
compulsive symptoms. Respondents rate the severity of obses-
sions  and  compulsions  separately  on  a  five-point  scale  across 
the dimensions of time spent, interference, distress, resistance, 
and control.

The  Y-BOCS-SR  shows  good  to  fair  internal  consis-
tency and good short-term test–retest reliability in nonclini-
cal samples (see Table 2).67–69 It shows good correspondence 
with clinician-rated measures of OCD severity and possesses 
a good ability to differentiate between individuals with OCD, 
anxiety  disorders,  and  healthy  controls.67–70  The  Y-BOCS-
SR Total Severity score shows fair discriminant validity with 
measures of worry in a college sample, with no extant data in 
a  clinical  sample.71  There  has  been  no  systematic  evaluation 
of the Y-BOCS-SR’s treatment sensitivity. However, it does 
appear to have utility as a diagnostic screening measure, with 
research suggesting that a score of 16 or greater may predict 
OCD diagnosis.67,69,70

obsessive–compulsive  Inventory  –  revised.  The 
Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory  –  Revised  (OCI-R)  is  a 
revision  of  the  original  Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory 
(OCI)  developed  to  reduce  redundancy  and  administration 
burden of the original measure.72,73 The OCI-R comprises 18 
items rated on a five-point scale, from which six subscales are 
derived (see Table 2).

The OCI-R total score demonstrates good internal con-
sistency and good to adequate short-term test–retest reliability 
(see  Table  2).72,74–76  The  OCI-R  shows  good  to  fair  conver-
gence  with  clinician-rated  measures  of  OCD  severity  and 
fair  to  poor  discriminant  validity  from  depression,  anxiety, 
and worry.72,74,76,77 While the OCI-R appears to be similarly 
reliable and valid when tested in an African-American sam-
ple,  it  is  important  to  note  that  some  research  suggests  that 
African-Americans tend to endorse significantly higher levels 
of  symptom  severity  across  subscales,  particularly  on  hoard-
ing  and  ordering  subscales.78  Initial  evidence  supports  the 
treatment  sensitivity  of  the  OCI-R,  with  further  replication 
needed.77 Additionally, the OCI-R presents potential for use 
as a screening measure, with research suggesting a correspon-
dence between a total score of 21 and an OCD diagnosis.79

Florida obsessive–compulsive Inventory. The Florida 
Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory  (FOCI)  consists  of  a 
20-item Symptom Checklist that includes 10 common obses-
sions and compulsions each derived from the Y-BOCS, as well 
as a five-item Severity Scale that captures symptom severity 
and impairment over the past month (ie, time occupied, dis-
tress, control, avoidance, and interference; see Table 1).80

The  FOCI  Symptom  Checklist  and  Severity  scores 
demonstrate  good  internal  consistency  (see Table  1).  Good 
convergent  validity  of  the  FOCI  Symptom  Checklist  was

evidenced by strong associations with self-reported obsessive–
compulsive  symptoms,  and  for  the  FOCI  Severity  score,  by 
strong correlation with Y-BOCS Total Severity score.80,81 The 
measure  shows  fair  discrimination  from  anxiety  and  fair  to 
poor discrimination from depression.80,81 There has been no 
evaluation  of  the  FOCI’s  test–retest  reliability  or  research-
based recommendations for diagnostic cutoff scores. Further, 
data  on  receiver  operating  characteristics  analysis  to  deter-
mine diagnostic cut points have not been reported. Support 
does  exist,  however,  for  the  measure’s  treatment  sensitivity 
to CBT.81

dimensional obsessive–compulsive scale. The Dimen-
sional Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (DOCS) is a 20-item self-
report scale developed to better capture dimensional aspects 
of OCD severity.74 Research supports a four-factor structure 
that  includes:  (1)  germs  and  contamination;  (2)  responsibil-
ity for harm, injury, or bad luck; (3) unacceptable obsessional 
thoughts; and (4) symmetry, completeness, and exactness.74,82 
Each  factor  is  measured  across  five  items  related  to  time, 
avoidance,  distress,  impairment,  and  resistance,  with  items 
rated on a 0–4 ordinal scale (see Table 2).

Further, the DOCS has been expanded to include a sup-
plementary scale to assess sexual obsessions, a common symp-
tom that  is believed to be phenomenologically  distinct from 
other subtypes of obsessions.83–85 The DOCS-Sexually Intru-
sive Thoughts (DOCS-SIT) scale contains five items rated on 
a  five-point  scale  [none  (0)  to  extreme/severe  (4)]  and  items 
probe  duration  of  obsessions,  avoidance,  distress,  functional 
impairment, and ability to resist obsessions.86 The supplemen-
tary  scale  shows  good  internal  consistency,  good  test–retest 
reliability, fair to poor convergent validity with other DOCS 
dimensions, and good discriminant validity from measures of 
depression and negative affect.87

The  DOCS  total  score  has  excellent  to  good  internal 
consistency in OCD samples; however, short-term test–retest 
reliability was poor (see Table 2).74,82 Meanwhile, the measure 
shows good convergent validity with other measures of OCD 
severity,  and  fair  to  poor  discriminant  validity  from  anxiety 
and depression.74,82 The DOCS exhibits treatment sensitivity 
across studies, and research findings suggest that a total score 
of 18–20 corresponds to an OCD diagnosis.74,82,88 Diagnos-
tic  accuracy  of  the  DOCS  is  high,  showing  good  ability  to 
discriminate individuals with OCD from controls [area under 
the  curve  (AUC)  =  0.86]  and  those  with  anxiety  disorder 
(AUC = 0.77).89 Subscale scores reflect common dimensions 
of  OCD,  and  thus,  elevated  scores  on  a  single  subscale  may 
indicate  potential  treatment  targets.82  These  properties  sup-
port the use of the DOCS as a clinically informative assess-
ment tool (ie, can determine diagnostic status and treatment 
response); however, it is limited in a treatment planning con-
text as it provides minimal detail regarding the content of an 
individual’s specific obsessive–compulsive symptoms.82

Several  other  self-report  rating  scales  of  OCD  severity 
exist, but are less commonly used in research and clinical practice. 

Assessment of OCD

These  measures  include  the  Padua  Inventory–Washington 
State University Revision (PI-WSUR), Vancouver Obsessional 
Compulsive  Inventory  (VOCI),  Schedule  of  Compulsion, 
Obsessions, and Pathological Impulses (SCOPI), Clark-Beck 
Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory  (CBOCI),  and  Obsessive–
Compulsive  Scale  of  the  Symptom  Checklist-90  –  Revised 
(OCD-SCL-90-R).90–94

youth/Parent reports of ocd severity
Given the phenomenological distinction in symptom presenta-
tion  and  comorbidity  patterns  between  youth  and  adults,  sev-
eral measures have been specifically designed and/or adapted for 
use in youth populations.95–97 When assessing OCD in youth, 
it is critical to use developmentally appropriate tools. This pro-
motes item comprehension, accurate reporting, and accounts for 
important distinctions in symptom presentation between adults 
and youth (eg, the phrase “need for symmetry/evening” may not 
be as relatable to youth as the phrase “like your books or toys 
lined up in a specific way”). Additionally, the inclusion of mul-
tiple informants is important among youth with OCD in order 
to fully capture symptom presentation and severity. For example, 
parents are often better reporters of visible compulsions at home, 
family  accommodation,  and/or  overall  impairment  of  youth’s 
symptoms.  Comparatively,  youth  are  often  better  reporters  of 
intrusive thoughts and symptoms occurring primarily at school 
or other non-home settings, unless limited by poor insight.

cy-bocs-child  report/Parent  report.  The  CY-
BOCS-Child  Report  (CR)/Parent  Report  (PR)  are  adapted 
self-report  versions  of  the  CY-BOCS  intended  for  use  by 
youth  respondents  and  parents.58  The  measure  parallels  the 
clinician-rated version and asks individuals to rate their own 
or  their  child’s  symptom  severity  using  a  multiple-choice 
Likert scale response format.

The CY-BOCS-CR/PR total scores show good internal 
consistency (see Table 3). Convergent validity for both child 
and parent reports is good as evidenced by significant corre-
lations  with  clinician-rated  measure  of  OCD  severity.  Dis-
criminant validity of child and parent reports is good to fair, 
as evidenced by small-to-moderate correlations with measures 
of externalizing symptoms and aggression.58 Treatment sensi-
tivity, as well as diagnostic accuracy, of the CY-BOCS-CR/
PR has not been examined.

obsessive–compulsive  Inventory  –  child  Version. 
The Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory – Child Version (OCI-
CV) comprises 21 items to assess the presence and frequency 
of obsessive–compulsive symptoms (see Table 3).98 It has six 
subscales that include: (1) doubting/checking, (2) obsessions, 
(3) hoarding, (4) washing, (5) ordering, and (6) neutralizing. 
Items are summed to produce a total score.

The  OCI-CV  total  score  shows  good  internal  consis-
tency  and  good  to  adequate  short-term  test–retest  reliability 
(see Table 3). Convergent validity is fair to poor as evidence 
by  significant  correlations  with  clinician-rated  measures  of 
OCD severity. Additionally, the OCI-CV total score has fair

to good discriminant validity with measures of irritability and 
depression.98,99  The  OCI-CV  has  demonstrated  treatment 
sensitivity to medication and CBT.71 Diagnostic accuracy of 
the OCI-CV has not been examined.

children’s Florida obsessive–compulsive Inventory. 
The  Children’s  Florida  Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory 
(C-FOCI)  is  the  parallel  child-report  version  of  the  FOCI, 
with  some  minor  distinctions.100  First,  there  is  a  Symptom 
Checklist  that  includes  17  obsessions  and  compulsions  that 
are rated as absent/present over the past month (see Table 3). 
Symptoms endorsed on the Symptom Checklist are rated on 
the  Severity  Scale,  which  collectively  rates  obsessions  and 
compulsions  on  a  six-point  scale  (0  =  none  to  5  =  extreme) 
across  five  items  related  to  time  occupied,  distress,  control, 
avoidance, and interference (see Table 3).

The C-FOCI shows fair internal consistency across both 
the Symptom Checklist and Severity Scale (see Table 3). The 
C-FOCI  Severity  Scale  has  been  shown  to  have  moderate 
associations  with  clinician-rated  OCD  severity,  as  has  the 
Symptom Checklist, suggesting fair convergent validity.100 The 
measure’s good discriminant validity is supported by weak and 
nonsignificant  associations  of  the  Severity  Scale  and  Symp-
tom Checklist with parent-reported measures of externalizing 
symptoms.100 There is further support for the measure’s treat-
ment sensitivity to CBT, with significant declines relative to 
baseline, which is noted on both the Symptom Checklist and 
Severity  Scale  when  used  in  treatment  trials.100  Diagnostic 
accuracy of the C-FOCI has not been examined.

children’s obsessive–compulsive Inventory – revised. 
The  Children’s  Obsessive–Compulsive  Inventory  –  Revised 
(ChOCI-R) is a revised version of the original ChOCI and is 
appropriate for use with children and adolescents.101,102 There 
exist parallel self- and parent-report versions of this question-
naire. The ChOCI-R consists of two sections (obsessions and 
compulsions), each comprising 16 questions (see Table 3). The 
first section begins with 10 questions each about the presence 
of common obsessions and compulsions, which are rated on a 
three-point scale (ie, not at all = 0 to a lot = 2). The severity of 
endorsed obsessions and compulsions are separately rated using 
six questions on a scale from 0 to 4. Severity items assess time 
spent, impairment, distress, resistance, control, and avoidance.
Internal consistency of the ChOCI-R’s child- and parent-
 report  Total  Impairment  score  is  good  (see  Table  3).  Both 
child- and parent-report Total Impairment scores exhibit good 
convergent  validity  with  clinician-rated  measures  of  OCD 
symptom severity. Discriminant validity from emotional dis-
orders was fair to poor, and good from externalizing problems, 
with  weak  associations  observed.  Although  exhibiting  good 
to fair reliability and appropriate validity, further research is 
needed  to  examine  treatment  sensitivity  of  the  ChOCI-R. 
While  the  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  original  ChOCI 
has been shown to be high (ie, sensitivity of 88% and specific-
ity of 95% compared to controls), these same metrics have not 
been examined for the revised measure.101

Assessment of OCD

Important related Factors
Several additional factors are important when assessing OCD. 
First,  assessment  of  OCD-related  functional  impairment  is 
crucial in determining if an individual meets diagnostic cri-
teria.  Moreover,  impairment  is  considered  a  key  treatment 
target, along with perceived distress, and an important com-
ponent of treatment response.103,104 Second, assessing family 
accommodation  in  OCD  is  important  as  it  is  prevalent  and 
associated  with  treatment  outcome.105–107  Family  accommo-
dation  is  a  relatively  broad  construct  that  can  manifest  as  a 
family member facilitating the completion of a ritual, assisting 
with avoidance of a feared event, or any myriad activity car-
ried out in response to a patient’s obsessive–compulsive symp-
toms.108–110  High  levels  of  family  accommodation  prohibit 
patients  with  OCD  from  fully  engaging  in  exposure-based 
psychotherapy,  as  accommodating  behaviors  serve  a  similar 
function to compulsions (ie, relieving distress associated with 
obsessions).111  Last,  limited  insight  has  been  documented 
across samples of adults and youth with OCD.112–114 Limited 
insight into obsessive–compulsive symptoms is associated with 
worse clinical prognosis and attenuated treatment response to 
exposure-based psychotherapy.112–114

Impairment.  Several  measures  exist  to  assess  impair-
ment  in  patients  with  OCD.  A  general  impairment  rating 
scale  commonly  used  in  OCD  studies  is  the  Sheehan  Dis-
ability  Scale  (SDS).115  The  SDS  is  typically  used  in  adult 
OCD  research  studies  to  capture  interference  of  clinical 
symptoms  (see Table  4). This  measure  shows  good  internal 
consistency  and  construct  validity  when  tested  in  primary 
care samples, as evidenced by significantly higher SDS scores 
for  individuals  with  one  of  six  psychiatric  diagnoses  com-
pared  to  those  with  none.116,117  The  SDS  has  been  shown 
to  be  sensitive  to  treatment  (see  Table  4).118  This  measure 
has  also  been  adapted  for  use  in  samples  of  youth.  The 
Child Sheehan Disability Scale – Parent and Child Report 
(CSDS-P/C) follows the same format of the SDS and asks 
youth and parents to rate a youth’s impairment across school, 
social,  and  family/home  domains.119  Two  additional  ques-
tions  completed  by  parents  are  also  included  (see Table  4). 
This measure has good to excellent internal consistency, good 
to  fair  convergent  validity,  and  good  discriminant  validity 
from externalizing behavior.119

A more specific and commonly used measure of OCD-
related impairment is the Child Obsessive–Compulsive Impact 
Scale – Revised (COIS-R).120 The COIS-R is a revision of the 
original  COIS  and  is  available  in  parallel  parent-  and  child-
report  versions,  assessing  impairment  due  to  OCD  across 
multiple  functional  domains  (see Table  4).121 The  parent  and 
child versions of the COIS-R exhibit good to excellent internal 
consistency and acceptable to good test–retest reliability across 
subscales. The parent-report version has demonstrated sensitiv-
ity as a predictor of treatment response, while the child-report 
version  is  sensitive  to  treatment  response  for  both  cognitive-
behavior therapy and medication.122–124

Assessment of OCD

Family  accommodation.  Meta-analytic  findings  support  
the  notion  that  interventions  targeting  family  accommo-
dation  are  associated  with  larger  improvements  in  patient 
functioning,  warranting  the  assessment  and  tracking  of  this 
construct.125  There  are  four  measures  to  assess  for  the  pres-
ence and level of family accommodation in youth and adults. 
The Family Accommodation Scale for Obsessive–Compulsive 
Disorder  (FAS)  is  a  clinician-administered  semi-structured 
interview  that  is  similar  in  format  to  the  Y-BOCS  (see 
Table  4).108,109  This  scale  shows  strong  internal  consistency 
and interrater reliability.109

For  adult  patients  with  OCD,  a  self-report  version  of 
family accommodation also exists, called the Family Accom-
modation Scale – Patient Version (FAS-PV) (see Table 4).126 
The  FAS-PV  total  score  shows  good  internal  consistency 
and  test–retest  reliability.  Additionally,  the  FAS-PV  total 
score exhibits fair convergent validity with other measures of 
family  accommodation  and  good  to  fair  discriminant  valid-
ity  with  measures  of  anxiety,  impulsivity,  and  depression 
(see Table 4).126

Similarly, there is also the option for the adult patient’s 
family member to complete accommodation ratings through 
completion  of  the  Family  Accommodation  Scale  –  Self-
Report  (FAS-SR)  (see  Table  4).127  The  FAS-SR  total  score 
shows  excellent  internal  consistency,  but  test–retest  reliabil-
ity has not been examined. Additionally, the FAS-SR shows 
good  convergent  validity  with  clinician-rated  family  accom-
modation and fair convergent validity with measures of global 
functioning and relative distress.

Meanwhile,  for  youth,  there  exists  the  Family  Accom-
modation Scale – Parent Report (FAS-PR) (see Table 4).128,129 
The FAS-PR total score demonstrates excellent internal con-
sistency, fair convergent validity with other measures of OCD 
symptom  severity  and  impairment,  and  good  discriminant 
validity from measures of trauma-related symptom severity.128 
Additionally,  the  FAS-PR  has  been  shown  to  be  sensitive 
to treatment.124,130

Insight.  A  certain  level  of  insight  is  inherent  in  mak-
ing an OCD diagnosis in adults. OCD is believed to be ego 
dystonic,  meaning  that  an  individual  is  able  to  acknowl-
edge  that  his/her  thoughts  and  behaviors  are  excessive  and 
absurd,  despite  the  individual’s  continued  engagement  in 
them.5 Research suggests, however, that not all adults with 
OCD  are  able  to  identify  their  obsessions  and  compulsive 
behaviors  as  irrational,  which  can  result  in  poor  treatment 
outcomes.131–133 In children, insight is not required to make 
a diagnosis, however, youth with poor insight similarly tend 
to experience worse treatment response.134 Moreover, lack of 
insight  can  make  it  particularly  difficult  for  both  adult  and 
youth patients to accurately report the extent of their symp-
toms and associated impairment.

Insight of adult patients can be assessed using the Brown 
Assessment  of  Beliefs  Scale  (BABS),  a  semi-structured 
clinician-administered  rating  scale  (see  Table  4).135  The

BABS total score exhibits good internal consistency, excellent 
interrater reliability, and good test–retest reliability. Addition-
ally, the measure shows good convergent validity with other 
measures  of  delusional  thinking  and  unawareness  of  mental 
disorders,  as  well  as  good  to  fair  discriminant  validity  from 
symptom severity scales (see Table 4).135

Additionally,  the  Y-BOCS  and  Y-BOCS-II  each  con-
tain one item assessing insight. In youth with OCD, insight 
can be measured using one item from the CY-BOCS, which 
assesses  insight  on  a  five-point  scale  based  on  clinical  judg-
ment (0 = excellent insight, 1 = good insight, 2 = mild insight, 
3 = poor insight, and 4 = completely lacks insight).

discussion
This paper reviewed common evidence-based assessment tools 
in the service of assisting clinicians in developing an evidence-
based  assessment  that  addresses  their  specific  goals.  In  line 
with  the  pragmatic  framework,  the  following  recommenda-
tions have been tailored to assessment goal and setting.

screening assessment. Brief self-reports are ideal tools 
to preliminarily identify symptoms and quantify severity in a 
time-limited  setting.  Self-report  measures  are  cost  effective, 
require  minimal  training  to  administer  and  interpret,  and 
have the advantage of removing potential interviewer bias.136 
However, the items can be difficult for some patients to under-
stand and may be better suited for adult patient populations. 
Accordingly,  the  OCI-R  is  a  brief  self-report  measure  that 
possesses reliability, validity, and diagnostic sensitivity, with 
a total score of 21 corresponding to an OCD diagnosis. Simi-
larly, the DOCS is another brief measure that captures dimen-
sional aspects of OCD and possesses excellent psychometric 
properties including diagnostic sensitivity, with a total score 
of  18–20  corresponding  to  an  OCD  diagnosis.  While  there 
has been no evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity for any youth 
self-report measure, the OCI-CV and C-FOCI may serve as 
acceptable screening tools to identify symptoms in youth.

differential  diagnosis  assessment.  Structured  and/or 
semi-structured interviews can assist in determining an OCD 
diagnosis, especially when significant comorbidity is present. 
Thus,  a  clinician  may  select  a  developmentally  appropriate 
diagnostic interview to rule out differential comorbid condi-
tions. Additionally, this interview can be supplemented with 
clinician-rated and self-report scales with strong discriminant 
validity.  The  Y-BOCS-II/CY-BOCS  shows  good  discrimi-
nant validity from worry and impulsivity, and the FOCI/C-
FOCI shows fair discriminant validity from anxiety. As many 
of the OCD measures do not discriminate well from depres-
sion,  it  may  be  worthwhile  to  supplement  the  use  of  these 
OCD rating scales with a well-validated measure of depres-
sion severity (eg, Beck Depression Inventory-II for adults, or 
Child Depression Inventory-II for youth.137–139

Initial assessment. During an initial assessment, the use 
of  psychometrically  valid  clinician-rated  measures  for  quan-
tifying  symptom  severity  is  recommended.  Clinician  ratings

integrate  reports  from  multiple  informants  (ie,  patient  and 
collaterals),  synthesize  clinician  observations  and  judgments, 
and  are  particularly  helpful  when  assessing  individuals  with 
limited insight.134 Clinician judgment also plays an important 
role considering recent changes in OCD diagnostic criteria put 
forth in the DSM-5. Although hoarding disorder is recognized 
as a distinct psychiatric disorder in the DSM-5, 25%–30% of 
individuals with OCD report compulsive hoarding and many 
well-validated assessment measures still probe for such symp-
toms.140–142  When  an  individual  scores  high  primarily  on 
hoarding  symptoms/severity,  it  should  be  taken  into  consid-
eration  in  the  overall  clinical  picture,  particularly  since  such 
symptoms are associated with worse treatment outcome.143–146 
Clinicians  may  wish  to  also  consider  exploring  a  hoarding 
disorder diagnosis.

The  Y-BOCS/Y-BOCS-II/CY-BOCS  represent  the 
gold  standard  in  clinician-administered  assessment  tools 
for OCD severity. When conducting an evaluation, it is also 
important to integrate measures of the patient’s impairment, 
level  of  family  accommodation,  and  insight.  For  adults,  the 
SDS  is  a  brief  measure  that  captures  global  impairment. 
While the clinician-administered FAS is preferred, the FAS-
PV and/or FAS-SR are also acceptable measures. In terms of 
insight, the BABS is a relatively brief clinician-administered 
measure  capable  of  determining  a  patient’s  insight.  Mean-
while for youth, the COIS-R is a psychometrically valid mea-
sure  that  captures  OCD-specific  impairment.  Additionally, 
it  can  be  administered  with  the  FAS-PR  to  capture  family 
accommodation,  with  insight  being  rated  using  the  single 
item  on  the  CY-BOCS.  As  each  of  these  factors  can  con-
tribute  to  inflated  or  diminished  quantifications  of  symp-
tom severity, they should be accounted for by the clinician in 
case conceptualization.

treatment  monitoring.  Use  of  outcome  monitoring 
and  feedback  is  a  recommended  practice  throughout  the 
field  of  behavioral  health.147–149  Such  strategies  have  been 
shown  to  enhance  clinical  decision-making,  as  well  as  to 
improve  a  clinician’s  ability  to  detect  worsening  of  symp-
toms and optimize treatment.150–154 Further, relaying treat-
ment progress to a client in a standardized way can result in 
statistically and clinically meaningful changes in treatment 
outcome  and  engagement.155,156  When  selecting  tools  for 
this purpose, it is important to prioritize symptom severity 
and  impairment  measures  that  have  established  treatment 
sensitivity and also evaluate factors that can attenuate treat-
ment outcomes (eg, accommodation and insight). While the 
Y-BOCS/Y-BOCS-II/CY-BOCS have demonstrated treat-
ment  sensitivity  across  multiple  studies  and  are  preferred, 
they  can  be  time  consuming  to  regularly  readminister  to 
monitor  therapeutic  response.  Thus,  self-report  measures 
like the FOCI and DOCS, which have demonstrated treat-
ment sensitivity, are recommended. Even though the treat-
ment  sensitivity  of  the  SDS  has  yet  to  be  evaluated  with 
OCD  patients,  it  is  also  recommended  here,  given  the 

importance of tracking functional changes over treatment. 
As family accommodation and poor insight can impede evi-
dence-based  treatments  for  OCD,  these  factors  should  be 
monitored  regularly  to  ensure  that  they  are  not  contribut-
ing to a patient’s diminished therapeutic response. Thus for 
adults, the FAS-PV (and/or FAS-SR) and BABS are recom-
mended. Meanwhile for youth, the OCI-CV and C-FOCI, 
along with the COIS-R, should be used to assess symptom 
severity  and  function  impairment,  respectively.  Addition-
ally,  the  FAS-PR  and  insight  item  from  the  CY-BOCS 
would be appropriate to monitor family accommodation and 
insight among youth.

conclusion
When designing  an assessment battery,  the  clinician should 
develop  the  most  parsimonious  assessment  battery  to  mini-
mize  deterioration  of  patient  responses.  Time  burden  cer-
tainly  can  interfere  with  the  feasibility  of  implementing  an 
assessment battery in a clinical setting, and thus, researchers 
are urged to continue to develop brief, psychometrically sound 
measures. Concurrently, when reviewing data gathered from 
the  assessment,  a  clinician  should  apply  judgment  in  inter-
preting the data from multiple measures and weighing infor-
mation across informants. Indeed, clinicians may consider the 
influence of parental psychopathology on reporting accuracy 
of child symptoms, as evidence suggest an association between 
parental psychopathology and greater reported severity of their 
child’s symptoms compared to youth report.157

In  summary,  an  evidence-based  assessment  is  the  cor-
nerstone  of  evidence-based  treatment.  This  paper  reviewed 
commonly used OCD measures to enhance clinicians’ abili-
ties  to  evaluate,  differentiate,  and  monitor  OCD  symptom 
severity and impairment in youth and adults. Findings high-
lighted  several  psychometrically  validated  clinician-rated, 
patient-rated, parent-rated, and child-rated measures to assess 
OCD symptom severity and impairment (see Appendix A for 
information on how to access and/or request assessment tools 
reviewed).  Based  on  individualized  assessment  goals  and 
empirical  support,  this  paper  provided  recommendations  to 
complete an evidence-based assessment  in  youth  and adults 
with OCD.
