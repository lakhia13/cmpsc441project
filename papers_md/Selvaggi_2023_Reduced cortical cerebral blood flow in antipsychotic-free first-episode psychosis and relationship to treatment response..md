Abstract

Background. Altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been found in people at risk for
psychosis, with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and with chronic schizophrenia (SCZ).
Studies using arterial spin labelling (ASL) have shown reduction of cortical CBF and increased
subcortical CBF in SCZ. Previous studies have investigated CBF using ASL in FEP, reporting
increased CBF in striatum and reduced CBF in frontal cortex. However, as these people were
taking antipsychotics, it is unclear whether these changes are related to the disorder or
antipsychotic treatment and how they relate to treatment response.
Methods. We examined CBF in FEP free from antipsychotic medication (N = 21), compared
to healthy controls (N = 22). Both absolute and relative-to-global CBF were assessed. We also
investigated the association between baseline CBF and treatment response in a partially nested
follow-up study (N = 14).
Results. There was significantly lower absolute CBF in frontal cortex (Cohen’s d = 0.84,
p = 0.009) and no differences in striatum or hippocampus. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis
revealed widespread cortical reductions in absolute CBF in large cortical clusters that
encompassed
(Threshold-Free Cluster
Enhancement (TFCE)-corrected <0.05). No differences were found in relative-to-global
CBF in the selected region of interests and in voxel-wise analysis. Relative-to-global frontal
CBF was correlated with percentage change in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
after antipsychotic treatment (r = 0.67, p = 0.008).
Conclusions. These results show lower cortical absolute perfusion in FEP prior to starting
antipsychotic treatment and suggest relative-to-global frontal CBF as assessed with magnetic
resonance imaging could potentially serve as a biomarker for antipsychotic response.

Introduction

Schizophrenia (SCZ) and related psychotic disorders are amongst the leading causes of global
disease burden (McCutcheon, Reis Marques, & Howes, 2020b). Current treatments are
ineffective for many patients (Kaar, Natesan, McCutcheon, & Howes, 2020), highlighting
the need to understand the neurobiology underlying psychosis to inform development of
new drug treatments (Jauhar & Howes, 2019; McCutcheon, Krystal, & Howes, 2020a).
Altered brain perfusion and metabolism have been implicated in the neurobiology of SCZ
(Goozée, Handley, Kempton, & Dazzan, 2014; Hill et al., 2004; Townsend et al., 2022), ini-
tially with positron emission tomography (PET). PET studies with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG) and [15O]H2O reported hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in frontal, anterior cingu-
late, temporal and parietal cortices (Andreasen et al., 1997; Buchsbaum et al., 1982; Gur et al.,
1995). More recently, arterial spin labelling (ASL), utilizing magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), has been used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because of the well-established
phenomenon of neuro-vascular coupling, measures of regional CBF are an indirect but highly
sensitive signature of regional cellular activity. ASL studies in people with chronic SCZ, treated
with antipsychotics, show reduced CBF in frontal, parietal and occipital regions and increased
CBF in basal ganglia (Legind et al., 2019; Liu, Qiu, Constable, & Wexler, 2012a; Oliveira et al.,
2018; Pinkham et al., 2011, 2015), though the basal ganglia findings have not been consistently
replicated (Ota et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2017). Thus, there is evidence for cortical hypoperfusion
in chronic SCZ, but it is unclear from these studies when this occurs in development of the

5236

disorder. Studies in clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P) indi-
viduals have reported increased CBF in basal ganglia and hippo-
campus (Allen et al., 2016, 2018; Modinos et al., 2018b). Increased
hippocampal perfusion in CHR-P individuals has also been found
with gadolinium-enhanced MRI (Schobel et al., 2013). These
findings indicate that CBF alterations may occur early in develop-
ment of psychosis, though, because the majority of CHR-P sub-
jects do not go on to develop psychosis,
it is unclear how
specific they are to psychosis. To date, only one study has inves-
tigated cerebral perfusion using ASL in people with first-episode
psychosis (FEP) (Kindler et al., 2018). This study found increased
perfusion in basal ganglia and reduced CBF in frontal cortex in
people with FEP, all of whom were taking antipsychotic
medication.

However, antipsychotics have effects on brain metabolism and
CBF (Goozée et al., 2014; Hawkins et al., 2018; Mehta et al., 2003;
Miller et al., 1997; Turkheimer et al., 2020), with evidence from
preclinical models (Sander et al., 2013, 2019; Sander, Hooker,
Catana, Rosen, & Mandeville, 2016; Viviani, Graf, Wiegers, &
Abler, 2013) and experimental medicine studies in healthy indivi-
duals (Hawkins et al., 2018; Selvaggi et al., 2019; Viviani et al.,
2013) suggesting that antipsychotics increase CBF in the basal
ganglia with a mechanism possibly mediated by D2 receptors
(Sander et al., 2013; Selvaggi et al., 2019). The effect of antipsy-
chotics on cortical perfusion is even less understood. Studies
using PET and single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) found consistently reduced perfusion and metabolism
in the frontal cortex in both medicated and unmedicated patients
with SCZ (Makarić et al., 2017; Molina et al., 2005). Viviani et al.
(2013)
found decreased cortical perfusion after amisulpride
administration in healthy volunteers. It is therefore unclear if pre-
vious findings in FEP were confounded by antipsychotic treat-
ment and what
the interaction between
antipsychotic effects and pathophysiology. Thus, we aimed to
determine if CBF is altered in people in their first episode of
psychosis who are free from antipsychotic medication (baseline
study). Based on prior studies in FEP and subjects at CHR-P,
we hypothesized that antipsychotic-free people with FEP would
show lower absolute CBF in the frontal cortex while keeping
CBF in the striatum within physiological ranges.

the extent of

is

Moreover, while previous cross-sectional investigations have
shown associations between altered CBF and severity of psychotic
symptoms in SCZ (Kindler et al., 2018; Pinkham et al., 2011), it is
unknown if brain perfusion before treatment is associated with
subsequent symptomatic improvement with antipsychotic treat-
ment. Thus, we aimed to explore this association in a prospective
study of patients who went on to receive antipsychotic treatment
(follow-up study). To summarize, we adopted a partially nested
two-study design to (i) investigate differences in brain perfusion
in FEP prior to start antipsychotic treatment (baseline study)
and (ii) identify brain perfusion markers of treatment response
possibly unbiased by antipsychotic effects on CBF.

Materials and methods

Study participants

Study participants were recruited from FEP teams within South
London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (Fusar-Poli et al.,
2020) and Central and West London NHS Trust. All participants
provided informed written consent. For both groups’ exclusion
criteria were history of head trauma, dependence on illicit

drugs, any significant medical co-morbidity (minor illnesses
such as seasonal allergies were permitted) and contra-indication
to MRI scanning.

Baseline study
Inclusion criteria for the patient group were: psychotic disorder
according to ICD-10 criteria (World Health Organization, 2004)
in first episode of illness. Age and gender-matched healthy volun-
teers were recruited through local advertisement from the same
geographical areas. Inclusion criteria for healthy controls (HCs)
were: no personal history of psychiatric illness [assessed using
the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (First, 2014)] and
no history of psychotropic medication use. All patients were
antipsychotic-naïve or antipsychotic-free for at least 6 weeks for
oral antipsychotics or 6 months
for depot antipsychotics
(Jauhar et al., 2019; Leucht et al., 2015). The sample included
nine antipsychotic-naïve and 12 antipsychotic-free patients. All
but one patient included in the baseline study was not taking
other psychotropic medication (i.e. antidepressants, mood stabili-
zers, benzodiazepines) at the time of MRI scan. Only one patient
was taking antidepressant medication (sertraline) at the time of
MRI scan (Viviani, Abler, Seeringer, & Stingl, 2012).

or -naïve or minimally treated [taking antipsychotics at minimal
effective dose for less than 2 weeks (Agid, Kapur, Arenovich, &
Zipursky, 2003; Levine & Leucht, 2012)]. All patients were
clinically assessed at baseline and reassessed after taking anti-
psychotic treatment, at a therapeutic dose as specified in the
Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines (Taylor, Barnes, & Young,
2018), for a minimum of 4 weeks. All patients were in stable treat-
ment at follow-up after titration. Clinical measures were rated at

Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
(Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987).
Patients received follow-up for at least 6 months to determine if
there had been a subsequent response in patients who showed
non-response at 4 weeks (duration to follow-up in months
24.73 ± 16.89). Subjects with psychosis were classified by anti-
psychotic exposure as antipsychotic-naïve, antipsychotic-free
[prior oral antipsychotic medication but free of treatment for at
least 6 week (oral) or 6 months (depot, if relevant)] or minimally
treated (taking antipsychotic medication for 2 weeks or less)
(Jauhar et al., 2019; Leucht et al., 2015). The sample included
seven antipsychotic-naïve, four antipsychotic-free and three peo-
ple minimally treated with antipsychotics.

MRI acquisition and pre-processing

MRI acquisition
Scans were acquired using a GE MR750 3-T scanner and a
12-channel head coil. A T1-weighted MPRAGE scan was
also acquired (FOV = 260 mm; echo time = 2.8 ms; repetition
time = 6.98 ms; 256 × 256 matrix; slice thickness = 1.2 mm, flip

image (FOV = 240 mm; echo time = 54.68 ms; repetition time =
4380 ms; 320 × 320 matrix; slice thickness = 4 mm) was also
acquired and used for the pre-processing of ASL images (see
below). ASL data were acquired using a pseudo-continuous arter-
ial spin labelling sequence (PCASL). Four control-label pairs were

used (labelling time = 1525 ms; post labelling delay = 1500 ms).
Images were read with a 3D Fast-Spin echo stack of spirals
scheme, consisting of eight inter-leaved spiral arms, 512 points
per arm and 60 slice-locations of 3 mm thickness. The raw spatial
resolution of the perfusion sensitive images was approximately
3.6 mm in plane and 3 mm through plane; and the data points
to Fourier
were re-gridded to a rectangular matrix prior
transformation and written with a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 3 mm
(no gap). The sequence had background suppression for optimum
reduction of the static tissue signal (for further details, see online
Supplementary materials). A proton density (PD) image was also
acquired over 48 s using the same acquisition parameters.

Pre-processing
PD images were used to obtain quantification of absolute CBF in
standard physiological units (ml blood/100 g tissue/min) using
the formula suggested in the recent ASL consensus paper
(Alsop et al., 2015). The unified segmentation algorithm in
SPM12 (Ashburner & Friston, 2005) was used to create grey mat-
ter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) images from each
T1-weighted image and to create a set of flow fields to later trans-
form each subject’s T1-weighted and ASL data into standard
space. The T2-weighted images were co-registered to the
T1-weighted images. Each raw PD image was then co-registered
to the T2 image. The parameters for this transformation were
then applied to the CBF maps (as they were already in alignment
with the PD image) prior to their normalization. The addition of
these two co-registration steps helped us to achieve a better align-
ment between CBF and T1-weighted images which prevented
from distortions during normalization. Images were resampled
to 2 mm isotropic voxels and normalized into a standard space
(Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI). Finally, the normalized
CBF maps were smoothed using a 6 mm full width at half max-
imum (FWHM) kernel. Normalized T1-weighted images were
also smoothed using a 6 mm FWHM kernel.

Statistical analysis

Demographics
Demographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender) were compared
between FEP and HC using χ2 or independent sample t tests
for categorical and continuous data respectively.

Region of interest (ROI) analysis
Absolute CBF values in the whole grey matter and in each ROI
were extracted using spatially normalized to individual grey matter
images and the WFU-Pickatlas ROIs with the MarsBar toolbox
findings
(http://marsbar.sourceforge.net). Based on previous
(Allen et al., 2016; Kindler et al., 2018), the following bilateral
ROIs were selected as our primary ROIs: the frontal cortex
(size = 61 104 mm), the hippocampus (size = 15 024 mm) and
the striatum (size = 36 816 mm). For comparisons with previous
investigations (Allen et al., 2016; Kindler et al., 2018), we also
explored differences between FEP and HC in relative-to-global-
perfusion CBF (relative CBF). For each ROI a linear regression
model was performed with absolute CBF in the ROI as the
dependent variable and global grey matter CBF as the independent
variable. For each linear regression in each ROI unstandardized
residuals were computed.

To test our primary hypothesis that FEP would show reduced
absolute CBF in frontal cortex and increased CBF in striatum and
hippocampus, a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA)

was used with ‘ROI’ as the within-subject factor and ‘GROUP’ as
the between-subject factor. Tukey HSD test has been used for
post-hoc pairwise comparison. An independent sample t test
was used to test absolute CBF in the whole grey matter to deter-
mine if there was a global group difference in CBF. Cohen’s d has
been computed to obtain estimates of effect size. To test differ-
ences in relative-to-global CBF, absolute CBF unstandardized
residual against global grey matter CBF were entered as dependent
variables in a repeated measure ANOVA with ‘ROI’ as within-
subject variable and ‘GROUP’ as between-subjects variable.
Tukey HSD has been used for post-hoc pairwise comparison.

Voxel-wise analysis
Differences in absolute CBF were also tested in whole-brain voxel-
wise analyses. Based on recent
(Eklund,
Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016), we performed non-parametric ana-
lysis as implemented in FSL randomise (Winkler, Ridgway,
Webster,
threshold-free
cluster enhancement (TFCE) (Smith & Nichols, 2009) with
5000 permutations to create a non-parametric null distribution
and calculate a 5% significant
threshold. We also tested
relative-to-global-perfusion CBF differences between FEP and
HC in voxel-wise analysis using FSL randomise by including glo-
bal grey matter CBF as a nuisance covariate in the model. An
independent sample t test was used to test differences in intracra-
nial volume (ICV) between FEP and HC.

Structural analysis
In order to check whether results could be influenced by differ-
ences in grey matter volume differences between FEP and HC,
standard voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis as imple-
mented in SPM was performed on pre-processed T1-weighted
images to determine if there were volumetric differences between
groups. Voxel-wise independent sample t test as implemented in
SPM were performed to assess differences in grey matter volume
between FEP and controls. Grey matter, white matter and CSF
images of each subject were combined to obtain estimates of
ICV. In addition, T1-weighted images were processed
total
using FreeSurfer (version 7.1.1, http://surfer.nmr.harvard.edu)
image analysis suite to produce measures of cortical thickness
estimates using the FreeSurfer automated brain segmentation pro-
cess (recon-all) (Fischl & Dale, 2000; Salat et al., 2004). An
FWHM Gaussian kernel of 10 mm was applied. Vertex-wide
independent sample t test was performed for both left and right
hemisphere to assess differences in cortical thickness between
FEP and controls. Both FEP > HC and FEP < HC contrast were
analysed. Cluster-level correction for multiple comparison was
implemented with −log 10( p)value = 3 as cluster-defining thresh-
old and alpha = 0.05 (Greve & Fischl, 2018).

Correlation with PANSS change
Percentage changes in PANSS was calculated, adjusting for min-
imum scores (% change in total PANSS = [((baseline score – 30)
− (follow-up score – 30))/(baseline score − 30)] × 100)
(Leucht
et al., 2005).

Cook’s distance were computed to examine the presence of multi-
variate outliers and to estimate the presence of highly influential
data points. To identify multivariate outliers, Mahalanobis dis-
tance values were compared to a χ2 distribution with degrees of
freedom equal to the number of variables (two in this case)
with p = 0.001 (Finch, 2012). Any data point with Cook’s distance
higher than 1 was considered a highly influential outlier and
excluded from the analysis as recommended [see Cook &
Weisberg, 1982]. To further test the robustness of our analysis
reducing the effect of extreme observations, we used the bias-
corrected accelerated bootstrap technique with 10 000 resamples
(Efron & Tibshirani, 1986).

Fourteen FEP (23.85 ± 3.77, four female) were included in the

Correlations between baseline CBF and PANSS change
There were no significant associations between absolute CBF

Discussion

We found absolute CBF was significantly lower in frontal cortex
but not striatum or hippocampus in people with FEP free of anti-
psychotic medication. Our whole brain analyses found signifi-
cantly lower perfusion in the patients in additional cortical
areas, including the parietal and occipital cortices.

Lower perfusion and metabolism of frontal cortex at rest is a
replicated finding in chronic SCZ (Bullmore et al., 1999;
Weinberger & Berman, 1988) demonstrated using various neuroi-
maging techniques including SPECT, [18F]-FDG and [15O]-H2O
PET, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal [i.e. functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)] and recently with ASL (Hill
et al., 2004; Kindler et al., 2015). Interestingly previous studies
using PET and SPECT in unmedicated FEP revealed reduced

cortical perfusion and metabolism (Brewer et al., 2007; Makarić
et al., 2017; Molina et al., 2005). Our results corroborate and
extend this evidence by showing the existence of lower frontal cor-
tical absolute perfusion in FEP without the potential confound of
antipsychotic treatment using MRI. In addition, our exploratory
whole brain analyses indicate cortical hypoperfusion extends
beyond the frontal cortex, including both parietal and occipital
cortices. This extends evidence that the function of these regions
is altered during cognitive tasks in SCZ (Calderone et al., 2013;
Hahn, Robinson, Leonard, Luck, & Gold, 2018; Weiss et al.,
2009) to show perfusion is also altered early in illness course.
In contrast to findings in antipsychotic-treated patients and peo-
ple at clinical risk of psychosis (Allen et al., 2018; Kindler et al.,
2018), we found no significant difference in relative-to-global
CBF in the striatum or hippocampus relative to controls. When

perfusion, with a mechanism possibly mediated by D2 receptors
(Selvaggi et al., 2019), this could indicate that previous evidence
of higher striatal CBF in people with SCZ taking antipsychotics
might be explained by D2 receptors blockade.

Longitudinal studies are required to confirm preliminarily evi-
treatment does

dence (Goozée et al., 2014) suggesting that
increase striatal perfusion in patients.

We did not find any differences in hippocampus in either
absolute or relative-to-global perfusion, in contrast to findings
in people at clinical risk of psychosis. Taken with our findings
in frontal cortex, this could suggest that there is progression of
pathophysiological alterations from the hippocampus prior to
the onset of psychosis to the frontal cortex with the development
of illness. However, it should be recognized that not all subjects at
clinical risk develop psychosis and longitudinal studies with
repeated scanning are required to test if there are changes in
hypoperfusion during the development of psychosis.

Relative-to-global CBF in the frontal cortex at presentation
explained approximately 40% of
the variance in subsequent
response to antipsychotic treatment, such that patients with
higher relative-to-global CBF showed higher symptom improve-
ment with treatment. These results extend prior evidence that
response to antipsychotic treatment in FEP is associated with
functional connectivity (Sarpal et al., 2016), D2/3 availability
(Wulff et al., 2015), and dopamine synthesis capacity (Jauhar
et al., 2019) to suggest that relative frontal perfusion could poten-
tially contribute to a biomarker for antipsychotic response in FEP
(Veronese et al., 2021). We did not find correlations between
relative-to-global CBF in the striatum and hippocampus and
PANSS change. However, given the lower CBF in a number of
cortical regions in patients,
it might be possible that cortical
regions other than the frontal cortex are also linked to treatment
response but we were underpowered to detect these relationships.
We did not find correlations between absolute CBF and PANSS
change, suggesting that changes in local perfusion relative to
whole brain perfusion are best able to capture variability in clin-
ical response. We found that antipsychotic-free FEP show lower
absolute CBF in cortical regions but no significant difference in

quent treatment (r = 0.57, p = 0.05).

relative-to-global CBF. Treatment response was associated with
relative-to-global frontal CBF but not with absolute CBF. The
absence of group differences in relative-to-global CBF are consist-
ent with our whole brain findings that indicate that there is lower
absolute CBF in other cortical regions, mainly driven by lower
CBF in parietal and occipital cortices as compared with controls.
On the other hand, subcortical CBF (i.e. striatal and hippocam-
pal) seems to be unaltered in patients relative to controls (see
Bayes factor testing in online Supplementary materials). Thus,
taken together, these findings suggest an imbalance between cor-
tical and subcortical blood flow early in SCZ. The association
between relative-to-global CBF (but not absolute CBF) with treat-
ment response might seem counterintuitive. However, this finding
might be less difficult to interpret considering the direct associ-
ation between the two variables. Patients with larger positive
improvement in symptoms (i.e. greater symptoms reduction)
were those with relatively lower alterations in frontal CBF as com-
pared with the rest of the cortex (i.e. higher relative-to-global
frontal CBF), suggesting that patients with more marked frontal
hypofunction are less responsive to treatment with D2 blockers.
This extends other evidence of frontal dysfunction in patients
whose illness does not respond to D2 blockers (Mouchlianitis,
McCutcheon, & Howes, 2016; Potkin et al., 2020). This interpret-
ation is coherent with recent reports indicating neurovascular
uncoupling in brain regions such the frontal cortex in SCZ
(Sukumar, Sabesan, Anazodo, & Palaniyappan, 2020).

Strengths and limitations

Strengths of this study include the inclusion of people with FEP
free from antipsychotic medication, and longitudinal measures
in FEP patients. A methodological strength of the study is the
evaluation of both absolute and relative-to-global CBF. Previous
studies in CHR-P and FEP have used one metric without report-
ing the other (Allen et al., 2018; Kindler et al., 2018; Modinos
et al., 2018b). However, our results suggest that antipsychotic-free
FEP show different pattern of alteration in absolute and
relative-to-global CBF. Therefore, we advise that future studies
should include both metrics to facilitate comparisons. Previous
works testing CBF differences in chronic SCZ as compared with
HCs using ASL have shown variability in grey matter perfusion
across individuals (Chen et al., 2022; Parkes, Rashid, Chard, &
Tofts, 2004; Pinkham et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2004). In our
study we used a 3D PCASL with background suppression which
offers a non-invasive, efficient and highly reproducible tool to
investigate brain perfusion as compared with other ASL methods
(Alsop et al., 2015; Chen, Wang, & Detre, 2011). PCASL
sequences have shown higher test–retest reliability as compared
with other MRI sequences (such as BOLD task or resting state
fMRI) used to identify biomarkers in psychosis (Holiga et al.,
2018). In addition PCASL has shown good between- and within-
subjects reliability [Intraclass coefficient (ICC) range: 0.63–0.83;
(Holiga et al., 2018)], and comparable with PET [18F]-DOPA
[ICC range: 0.42–0.94; (Egerton, Demjaha, McGuire, Mehta, &
Howes, 2010)], which has been proposed as a potential biomarker
for treatment stratification in psychosis (Veronese et al., 2021).
We obtained absolute CBF values on average of 40–50 ml/100 g
tissue/min in grey matter in healthy volunteers which are at the
lower range of previous investigations using pulsed ASL and/or
other scanner manufacturers (Alsop et al., 2015). In our study
we used a post-labelling approach and background suppression
protocol that was slightly slower than the one recommended by

the ASL white paper (Alsop et al., 2015), which could account
for the slightly lower CBF values we obtained. However, we did
not find artefactual hyper-perfusion regions in our analysis, sug-
gesting that the post-labelling delay is not having a major effect on
data quality. One potential issue in the imaging analysis could be
the influence of partial volume effects given structural brain
alterations in FEP (Brugger & Howes, 2017). However, we did
not find group differences in grey matter volume, total ICV and
cortical
thickness, suggesting that partial volume effects are
unlikely to explain our results, although we cannot completely
rule out a contribution of partial volume effects to our findings.
Demographic heterogeneity of the sample is thought to be an
important factor contributing to variability across individuals.
In particular age and gender have been strongly associated with
CBF variability (Liu et al., 2012b; Viviani et al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2018). The groups were very similar in mean age and gender
distribution. Nevertheless, to check for any influence of these, we
conducted further analyses including these as covariates. Our
findings remained essentially unchanged when gender and age

were

our findings. Body-mass index, caffeine intake or nicotine con-
sumption immediately prior to scanning could be other sources
of variability.
In common with prior studies in psychosis
(Davies et al., 2019; Modinos et al., 2018a; Overton, Bhagwat,
Viviano, Jacobs, & Voineskos, 2020; Schneider et al., 2019), we
did not control for these. However, the two groups were matched
by smoking status, alcohol intake and substance use, which sug-
gests that both caffeine intake and nicotine consumption might
be similar between groups. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude
group differences in use of these substances influencing our find-
ings and further studies matching for intake on these would be
useful.

In addition, it should be recognized that the frontal ROI is lar-
ger than the hippocampal and striatal ROIs. This may result in a
higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the frontal region over
these other regions, and consequently greater sensitivity to detect
group differences. However, SNR estimates and sensitivity ana-
lyses (see online Supplementary materials) both suggest that it
is unlikely that ROI size has affected our results.

Furthermore, in our follow-up study patients were treated in a
naturalistic design. Thus, our findings do not provide information
the specific effects of antipsychotic treatment. Finally,

although the baseline study constituted a larger cohort than
that previously reported in FEP (Kindler et al., 2018), given the
relatively modest sample size, further studies are needed to test
the generalisability of our findings to other cohorts and settings.

Implications and future directions

Frontal dysfunction is one of the key mechanisms thought to con-
tribute to the pathophysiology of psychosis (Howes & Murray,
2014; McCutcheon et al. 2020b; Weinberger & Berman, 1988).
Our finding that frontal hypoperfusion is present early in the
development of the disorder and in unmedicated patients is con-
sistent with these models and other markers of frontal hypofunc-
tion in SCZ (Howes and McCutcheon, 2017; Onwordi et al., 2020;
Osimo, Beck, Reis Marques, and Howes, 2019). In addition, given
the close link between CBF and brain metabolism (Riederer et al.,
2018), our results are in line with the evidence of increased lactate
levels and pH (Dogan, Yuksel, Du, Chouinard, & Öngür, 2018;
Du et al., 2014) and mitochondrial dysfunction in SCZ (Prince,

Pierluigi Selvaggi et al.

Blennow, Gottfries, Karlsson, & Oreland, 1999; Rajasekaran,
Venkatasubramanian, Berk, & Debnath, 2015) suggesting that
altered brain oxidative capacity could be the pathophysiological
substrate underlying abnormal brain function in psychosis. In
addition, our results suggest alterations in brain perfusion at pres-
entation are associated with subsequent antipsychotic response.
These findings suggest that brain perfusion could be used to
help predict future response.

Previous evidence suggested antipsychotics may normalize brain
metabolism (Buchsbaum et al., 2009), however recently some
authors have proposed that this normalization might not be sus-
tainable in some patients (Turkheimer et al., 2020). Future longitu-
dinal studies are therefore needed to understand the effect of
antipsychotic treatment on brain metabolism in psychosis.

Conclusions

Our results provide evidence for lower frontal perfusion in FEP
without the potential confound of antipsychotic treatment. In
addition, relative CBF in frontal cortex at baseline is associated
with subsequent antipsychotic response. These findings indicate
there is cortical hypofunction early in the course of psychosis.
