- Sleep and mental health

There's a close relationship between sleep and mental health. Living with a mental health problem can affect how well you sleep. And poor sleep can have a negative impact on your mental health.

- Types of sleep problem

- How sleep problems can affect mental health

- Causes of sleep problems

Our page oftips to improve your sleephas ideas that may help if you're having sleep problems.

We have info on sleep and mental health.

During the day, my brain is fuzzy, my memory is noticeably affected. I barely have energy to function.


## Types of sleep problem


Everyone needs sleep, but many of us have problems with it. For example, you might:

- Find it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep or wake up earlier than you'd like to – if this happens regularly, it's known as insomnia

- Have experiences that disturb your sleep, such as panic attacks, flashbacks, nightmares, psychosis, and mania or hypomania

- Find it hard to wake up or get out of bed

- Often feel tired or sleepy – this could be because you're not sleeping enough, not getting good quality sleep or because of health problems

- Sleep a lot, which could include sleeping at times when you want, or need, to be awake

Or you may have other difficulties with sleep that aren't mentioned here.

When I get depressed, I sleep so much. At its worst it was 18 hours a day, because it was the only way that I could stop thinking and stop my mind from saying awful things to me.


## How sleep problems can affect mental health


If you have problems sleeping, this could make your mental health worse. Or it might cause other problems that impact your mental health.

For example, you might:

- Be more likely to feelanxiousordepressed

- Be more likely to experiencehallucinations

- Be more impacted by symptoms of existing mental health problems, such asmania,psychosisorparanoia

- Feellonelyor isolated – for example, if you don't have the energy to see people, or they don't seem to understand what you're going through

- Struggle to concentrate, or make plans and decisions

- Feel irritable or not have energy to do things

- Have problems with day to day life – for example, at work or with family and friends

- Be more affected by physical health problems

My sleep problems are more a case of bedtime procrastination than insomnia as such and, as a consequence, being too tired the next morning. I still haven't found out what works for me as I can get to sleep once I do get to bed.


## Causes of sleep problems


The things that affect our sleep differ for everyone. They can include:

- Stresses or worries – for example, issues withmoney,housingorwork

- Problems with where you sleep – for example, if you sleep somewhere uncomfortable or unsafe, or where you're easily disturbed

- Health conditions relating to sleep, also known as sleep disorders

- Being a parent or carer

- Takingmedication, including starting orcoming off medication

- Usingrecreational drugs and alcohol

- Working at night or being a shift worker

- Current or pasttrauma

- Neurodiversity, for exampleADHDorautism

- Mental health problems

- Physical health problems

### How my sleep pattern highlighted my failing mental health


My sleep was the first red flag that started waving wildly to warn me that something was wrong.
