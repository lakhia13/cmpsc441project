Abstract

Background:  Military veterans wounded in combat are a high-risk group for emotional and 
physical distress, which may be exacerbated by misuse of prescription opioids and sedatives. The 
goal of the current study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of prescription opioid and 
sedative misuse among veterans wounded in combat.

Method:  We recruited veterans from the Combat Wounded Coalition (n=212; 84% non-Hispanic 
White; 97.6% male) to complete an online survey of mental health and substance use disorder 
symptoms, assessed via the DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptoms Measure, the 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist for DSM-5, the Pain Enjoyment General Activity 
Scale, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Prescription opioid and 
sedative misuse was assessed by frequency of use in the past year that was not currently prescribed 
or using more than prescribed.

Results:  Participants reported high rates of past year prescription opioid misuse (46.2%) and 
sedative misuse (21.7%). Misuse of both opioids and sedatives was associated with the most 
distress, including greater depression, anger, sleep disturbance, AUDIT scores, PTSD symptoms, 
suicidality, and pain interference. In multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses, greater 
sleep disturbance (OR=1.73) was associated with greater odds of sedative misuse versus no 
misuse. Higher AUDIT scores were associated with greater risk of sedative misuse (OR=1.16) 
versus opioid misuse only.

Introduction

Military veterans are at high risk for numerous mental health disorders, including 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Fulton et al., 2015), depression (Bonde et al., 2016), 
suicide (Bryan et al., 2015), sleep difficulties (Hughes et al., 2018), and substance use 
disorders (Kelsall et al., 2015). Veterans with pain and mental health disorders, particularly 
those with PTSD, are more likely to receive prescriptions for opioids and sedatives (e.g., 
benzodiazepines, barbiturates), as compared to those without mental health disorders (Seal 
et al., 2012). Yet, scarce research exists on prescription opioid and sedative misuse in this 
important, yet understudied, population. In the present study, the term misuse refers to the 
use of opioids or sedatives without a prescription or in greater amounts than prescribed.

Opioids and sedatives are commonly prescribed to military populations, particularly veterans 
(Barry et al., 2015; Park, Saitz et al., 2015). Among veterans prescribed an opioid 
medication, psychiatric disorders and insomnia have been associated with greater odds of 
receiving a concurrent sedative prescription (Barry et al., 2015; Seal et al., 2012). Critically, 
as compared to those prescribed only opioids, veterans who receive concomitant sedative 
and opioid prescriptions are at greater risk of wounds/injuries (both self-inflicted and 
violence-inflicted) (Gressler et al., 2018) and drug overdose (Gressler et al., 2018; Park 
et al., 2015). Moreover, an annual survey of all active duty members found an increase 
in prescription opioid misuse from 2005 to 2008 (from 11.1% to 18.4; Bray et al., 2010). 
This increase was the result of a rise in active duty members using more opioid pain 
medications than prescribed (Bray et al., 2010; Jeffery et al., 2013). Active duty personnel 
with a prescription for anxiety, depression, or pain are more likely to misuse both opioid 
and sedative medications (Jeffery et al., 2013). Likewise, prescription opioid misuse among 
active service members and veterans includes using a previously prescribed prescription for 
new pain and using more opioids than prescribed (Ramirez at al., 2017).

Among veterans, prescription drug misuse is associated with chronic pain (Becker et al., 
2009), substance use disorders (Golub & Bennett, 2013), symptoms of depression (Becker 
et al., 2009), and suicide-related mortality (Bohnert et al., 2017). However, most previous 
studies have examined opioid misuse only. It is important to understand the prevalence 
and correlates of prescription opioid and sedative misuse, both alone and in combination, 
given that these medications are commonly co-prescribed, and that concurrently receiving 
a sedative prescription is associated with poorer outcomes (e.g., drug overdose, wounds/
injury) (Gressler et al., 2018; Park et al., 2015), as compared to receiving an opioid 
prescription alone.

The goal of the current study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of prescription 
opioid and sedative misuse, alone and in combination, among wounded veterans. Examining 
prescription opioid and sedative misuse among wounded veterans is particularly important 
given high rates of chronic pain, sleep disorders, PTSD, and hazardous drinking (Fales et al., 
2017), and opioid and sedative prescriptions among this population (French et al., 2008). We 
hypothesized that opioid and sedative misuse would be associated with symptoms of PTSD, 
depression, anxiety, suicidality, and pain severity and interference.

2.  Method

2.1.  Participants and Procedure

Participants were recruited from the Combat Wounded Coalition (CWC) (https://
combatwoundedcoalition.org) veteran listserv (n=2,223). CWC is devoted to veterans 
wounded in combat. All listserv members were vetted via a Certificate of Release or 
Discharge from Active Duty (i.e., a DD Form 214), which represents the complete, verified 
record of a member’s time in the military, awards and medals, and other service information 
such as total combat service and/or oversea service, military occupational specialty, and so 
forth. Participation in the 30-minute online study aimed at learning more about experiences 
during combat and deployment, mental health, substance use, symptoms of pain, and 
treatment-seeking. Participants (n=212) were offered a $10 Amazon gift card for completing 
the study. All study documents and procedures were approved by an Institutional Review 
Board committee at the participating university and respondents consented to participation.

2.2.  Measures

Past two-week psychiatric distress was assessed using the 23-item DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 
1 Cross-Cutting Symptoms Measure—Adult (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The 
current study focused on those domains that are most relevant to prescription opioid and 
sedative misuse, including depression, anger, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Scores of 2 
or higher indicate need for additional screening. The percentage of veterans who met the 
cut-off of 2 or more were: 80.6% (depression), 68.4% (anger), 74.8% (anxiety), and 76.6% 
(sleep problems). PTSD symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Posttraumatic Stress 
Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015); 
43.3% met the cut-off for probable PTSD. Alcohol use was assessed using the 10-item 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders, Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, 
& Grant, 1993); 19.4% of men and 25% of women met the AUDIT cut-off of 8 and 7, 
respectively. Suicidality was assessed with the 6-item suicidality subscale of the Inventory 
of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; Watson et al., 2007). Pain was assessed using 
the 3-item, PEG (Krebs et al., 2009), an acronym that represents the 3 items assessed by 
the PEG (Pain average, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General 
activity).

Opioid misuse was assessed with two questions. First, participants were asked if they had 
used pain killers (e.g., Vicodin, Percocet, and Oxycontin) in their lifetime. Sedative misuse 
was assessed by first asking participants if they had used sedatives (e.g., Ativan, Xanax, and 
Phenobarbital) in their lifetime. Those who responded affirmatively to the pain killer and/or

sedative questions were asked if they had used opioids and sedatives not currently prescribed 
or used more than prescribed in the past year. The response scale was: (1) <1 once a month, 
(2) about 1 time a month, (3) 2–3 times per month, (4) 1–2 times per week, (5) 3–4 times 
per week, or (6) daily or almost daily and re-coded as 0=no past year misuse and 1=any past 
year misuse.

2.3.  Data Analysis Plan

To assess the prevalence of opioid and sedative misuse, we calculated prevalence rates (i.e., 
percentages) of participants who reported any past year misuse. The associations between 
mental health, alcohol use, pain, and risk of opioid and sedative misuse was assessed 
using a multinomial logistic regression. Significant associations were determined by a 95% 
confidence interval that does not contain one. Covariates that were significant in bivariate 
logistic regression models were then examined in a multivariable logistic regression model 
(Hidalgo & Goodman, 2013).

3.  Results

Demographic information as well as descriptive statistics and internal consistency of 
all study variables are presented in Supplemental Table 1. The majority of participants 
identified as being White (n=178, 84.0%), male (n=203, 97.6%), with a mean age of 
46.1 (SD=14.6) years old. Over half of the sample (59.1%) reported a total combined VA 
disability rating of 100% and 87.7% have received a Purple Heart. Past year prevalence 
of opioid and sedative misuse was 46.2% and 21.7%, respectively. Nearly all participants 
who misused sedatives (45 out of 46, 97.8%) also misused opioids. Descriptive statistics by 
groups with no opioid or sedative misuse (n=113), opioid misuse only (n=53), and sedative 
misuse with or without opioid misuse (n=46) are provided in Table 1.

To examine risk for opioid and sedative misuse we conducted bivariate and multivariable 
multinomial logistic regression analyses with no opioid or sedative misuse (n=113), opioid 
misuse only (n=53), and sedative misuse with or without opioid misuse (n=46) as the 
dependent variable and demographics, mental health, AUDIT scores, suicidality, pain 
severity and interference, disability rating, and receiving the Purple Heart as predictors. We 
conducted bivariate analyses and then significant effects were examined in a multivariable 
analysis.

In the bivariate models (see Supplemental Table 2), younger age, and greater depression, 
anger, sleep disturbance, anxiety, PTSD symptoms on PCL-5, AUDIT scores, suicidality, 
pain severity, pain interference, and not receiving the Purple Heart predicted a significantly 
greater risk of sedative misuse versus no misuse in bivariate models. Hispanic ethnicity 
predicted a lower probability of opioid misuse only and a significantly greater risk of 
sedative misuse. In multivariable models (see Table 2), we found Hispanic ethnicity, sleep 
disturbance, and AUDIT scores remained significant predictors. Hispanic ethnicity was 
associated with lower risk of opioid misuse only versus no misuse (OR=0.09) and greater 
risk of sedative misuse versus opioid misuse only (OR=13.56). Greater sleep disturbance 
(OR=1.73) was associated with greater odds of sedative misuse versus no misuse. Higher

AUDIT scores were also associated with greater risk of sedative misuse (OR=1.16) versus 
opioid misuse only.

4.  Discussion

The present study is one of the few studies to examine prescription opioid and sedative 
misuse among wounded veterans. Rates of past-year prescription opioid (46.2%) and 
sedative misuse (21.7%) were approximately 11 and 9 times higher in the present sample, 
for opioids and sedatives, respectively, than among adults in the general population (Center 
for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality [CBHSQ], 2017). Nearly all participants who 
misused sedatives (97.8%) also misused opioids in the past year. This result is consistent 
with findings from the general population, which suggest that sedative misuse is robustly 
associated with prescription opioid misuse (Han et al., 2017). High rates of concurrent 
opioid and sedative misuse in the present sample, as well as the increased risk of overdose 
when sedative and opioids are combined (Kandel et al., 2017), underscore the importance 
of examining factors that might influence the misuse of this combination of drugs among 
wounded veterans.

Wounded veterans with sedative misuse (with or without opioid misuse) reported more 
symptoms of psychiatric disorders, greater AUDIT scores, more sleep disturbance, and 
greater pain interference, as compared to veterans who reported opioid misuse only or 
no prescription drug misuse. Sleep disturbance, and alcohol consumption and problems as 
assessed by the AUDIT, remained significant predictors of sedative misuse in multivariable 
analyses, suggesting these factors may help identify wounded veterans who are at greater 
risk of sedative misuse.

Commonly reported motives for sedative misuse among the general population include 
helping with sleep and coping with negative affect (CBHSQ, 2017). Although our study 
design does not allow us to examine causality, wounded veterans experiencing more 
psychiatric symptoms, pain, and sleep disturbance may misuse sedatives as a method of 
coping with negative affect and sleep disruption. It is also possible that sedative misuse 
caused or exacerbated pre-existing sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance has been associated 
with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Bernert et al., 2014) and depression (Bravo et al., 
2018), which might explain associations between sedative misuse and these factors in 
bivariate, but not multivariate, analyses. Longitudinal studies should examine the temporal 
associations between sedative misuse, sleep disturbance, and psychiatric symptoms among 
wounded veterans. In the present study, veterans with sedative misuse had greater alcohol-
related consequences and/or alcohol consumption, as compared to those with opioid misuse 
only and those without prescription drug misuse. In the general population, greater severity 
of alcohol use has been associated with sedative misuse (McCabe et al., 2006). This finding 
is particularly concerning given that the majority of those with sedative misuse were also 
misusing opioids, and that combining sedatives with opioids and/or alcohol increases risk 
of overdose (Kandel et al., 2017). Further, veterans who were wounded (presumably) while 
deployed for combat, yet did not receive a Purple Heart (presumably because they were 
not wounded as a result of enemy action) appear at greater risk for sedative misuse. It may 
be important for mental health professionals to consider how the specific nature of combat

injury may be associated with sedative misuse. The specific nature of injury Hispanic 
ethnic identity also differentiated those who misused sedatives from those who misused 
opioids only and those without prescription drug misuse. This finding is inconsistent with 
prior findings that noted higher rates of sedative prescriptions (Olfson et al., 2015) among 
non-Hispanic White individuals. Future studies should examine if risk of sedative misuse 
among Hispanic veterans is explained by higher prescribing rates and whether it may be 
particularly important to screen for sedative misuse among Hispanic veterans.

This study had several limitations. All data were self-report and data are subject to 
retrospective recall and other self-report biases. Recruiting from a listserv may not 
be representative of veterans or wounded veterans in general and it is possible that 
veterans who join this organization may need of additional support. Further, we did not 
ask participants about medications that were prescribed and taken in accordance with 
a prescription. More fine-grained information on misused as well as medications that 
were used properly may have illuminated important differences among veterans. Another 
limitation includes the cross-sectional nature of our data. It is important to recognize that 
some conditions may have been present prior to the military, injury, or illness. Data were 
collected on a sample of predominantly White, male, recent-era combat-wounded veterans 
and results may not generalize to other veterans.

Despite study limitations, our findings have important clinical relevance for veterans 
wounded in combat. Given the rate of opioid and sedative misuse in veteran populations 
(including the present sample), this is a critical population to educate about the importance 
of medication adherence and the potential consequences of misuse, including the risk of 
overdose when opioids, sedatives, and/or alcohol are combined. Furthermore, it is critical to 
assess wounded veterans who present for opioid and sedative medications to screen for sleep 
problems, pain, alcohol/drug misuse, as well as changes in psychiatric symptoms (such as 
depression PTSD, and suicidality) as this may help identify veterans who may be at risk of 
misusing opioids and sedative medications.
