Abstract
The link between sex hormones and schizophrenia has been suspected for over a century; however, scientific evidence sup-
porting the pharmacotherapeutic effects of exogenous estrogen has only started to emerge during the past three decades. 
Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and basic research suggests that estrogen has a protective effect in women 
vulnerable to schizophrenia. Such evidence has led multiple researchers to investigate the role of estrogen in schizophrenia 
and its use in treatment. This narrative review provides an overview of the effects of estrogen as well as summarizes the 
recent work regarding estrogen as a treatment for schizophrenia, particularly the use of new-generation selective estrogen 
receptor modulators.

Introduction

Sex differences in schizophrenia

Schizophrenia,  a  complex  and  debilitating  condition,  is 
associated with distinct sex differences. Decades of research 
have  established  a  link  between  sex  hormones,  notably 
estrogen, and schizophrenia. Both animal and human stud-
ies have demonstrated estrogen’s profound impact on the 
central nervous system, specifically on the neurotransmitter 
systems implicated in the development of schizophrenia. 
The observations of sex differences in the age of onset of 
schizophrenia, as well as the exacerbation, relapse, or new 
onset of schizophrenia at times when estrogen levels drop 
(e.g., premenstrual or menopause), led to the hypothesis that 
estrogen may have a protective effect against schizophrenia, 
and clinical trials to date on the use of adjunctive estradiol 
support this notion. This narrative review aims to present an 
updated overview of the research in schizophrenia pertaining 
to sex differences, the role of estrogen, estrogen and hyper-
prolactinemia, and estrogen as a treatment. Additionally, 
future research and clinical directions are provided.

The  onset  and  course  of  schizophrenia  vary  noticeably 
between men and women (Hafner 2003; Hafner and van der 
Heiden 1997; Gogos et al. 2015). Generally, schizophrenia 
affects men slightly more frequently than women, with a 
ratio of nearly 1.4:1 (Jongsma et al. 2019), and men experi-
ence an earlier onset of symptoms. The peak age of onset for 
men with schizophrenia is between 20 and 29 years, while 
for women, this peak occurs about 5 years later between 
ages 20 and 39 (Giordano et al. 2021). Additionally, women 
tend to exhibit a slightly lower incidence of psychosis and 
less social and clinical disability compared to men (Van Der 
Werf et al. 2014; Ochoa et al. 2012). However, this trend 
appears to shift in late years, with women showing higher 
incidence rates after the age of 40 (Van Der Werf et al. 
2014; Riecher-Rössler et al. 1997), which may be related to 
decreased estrogen levels after menopause. Although women 
tend to attempt suicide more frequently, complete suicide 
rates are lower compared to men (Wang et al. 2020).

Earlier menarche — that is, earlier rise of estrogen levels 
— seems to be associated with a later onset of schizophre-
nia (Cohen et al. 1999; Kiliçaslan et al. 2014). Early work 
by Cohen et al. (1999) examined the relationship between 
pubertal age and psychosis onset in both men and women. 
The authors reported statistically significant negative cor-
relations between puberty age and measures of schizophre-
nia onset (first odd behavior, first psychotic symptoms, and

first psychiatric hospitalization) in women, but no signifi-
cant associations were found in men (Cohen et al. 1999). 
Psychotic symptoms also often deteriorate premenstrually 
or perimenstrually (Handy et al. 2022; Reilly et al. 2020). 
During these phases of low estrogen, women experience 
an exacerbation or worsening of psychotic manifestations, 
presenting challenges in symptom management and overall 
mental well-being (Gogos et al. 2015; Reilly et al. 2020). 
Previous studies examining self-reported menstrual exacer-
bations reported prevalence ranging from 20 to 32.4% (Glee-
son et al. 2016; Hsiao et al. 2004). Psychiatric admissions 
are also significantly greater during the perimenstrual phase 
of the cycle, with studies showing not only a significant 
excess of patient admissions during this phase but also an 
inverse correlation of estradiol concentrations in the blood 
with psychopathology (Reilly et al. 2020). When estradiol 
concentrations in the blood increased naturally during the 
cycle, there appeared to be an improvement in psychotic and 
total symptomatology, and vice versa.

Studies across the life cycle highlight women’s height-
ened vulnerability, compared to men, regarding either the 
onset of a first episode or relapse of existing illness dur-
ing two significant hormonal shifts: the postpartum period 
and menopause, both marked by declining estrogen levels 
(Seeman 1986; Seeman 1996). After menopause, women 
with pre-existing chronic schizophrenia tend to experience 
a  worsening  of  their  condition,  leading  to  an  increased 
requirement for antipsychotic medication. Additionally, the 
decline in estrogen levels can diminish the production of 
enzymes responsible for metabolizing antipsychotic medi-
cations, consequently reducing their effectiveness. Beyond 
psychotic symptoms, estrogen loss can exacerbate various 
conditions, including sleep disturbances, irritability, depres-
sion, cognitive impairment, and sexual problems. While 
estrogen replacement, like estradiol, may offer relief dur-
ing the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal phases 
in women with schizophrenia, its usage may entail certain 
risks. A recent study by Sommer et al. (2023) showed that 
the proportion of patients requiring hospitalization for psy-
chosis is even among men and women until the age of 45. 
However, after 45, more women than men with psychosis 
need hospitalizations — coinciding with perimenopause.

Symptoms  of  schizophrenia  also  manifest  differently 
in  males  and  females.  Typically,  males  diagnosed  with 
schizophrenia tend to exhibit more pronounced negative 
symptoms such as anhedonia and avolition (Schultz et al. 
1997; Li et al. 2016). They also often experience greater 
impairments in occupational and social functioning (Han-
lon et al. 2017; Rietschel et al. 2017). On the other hand, 
females  with  schizophrenia  tend  to  present  with  higher 
rates of affective symptoms (Mancuso et al. 2015), includ-
ing comorbid depression and anxiety. Additionally, research 
has suggested that females may be more prone to engage in 

suicidal behaviors (Heila et al. 1997). In relation to sex dif-
ferences in cognition in schizophrenia, females tend to have 
an advantage in verbal learning and memory and males tend 
to have an advantage in spatial tasks; however, similar sex 
differences are observed in healthy controls indicating sex-
specific advantages for certain cognitive functions remain 
unaffected by schizophrenia (Leger and Neill 2016; Zhang 
et al. 2017; Menghini-Müller et al. 2020).

The role of estrogen in schizophrenia

The aforementioned sex differences in schizophrenia relate 
to the hypothesis that estrogen, especially estradiol, pos-
sesses neuroprotective qualities against psychosis (Saldanha 
2020; Sbisa et al. 2018; McGregor et al. 2017).

Schizophrenia’s pathogenesis is often viewed as involv-
ing a progressive neurodegenerative element (Iritani 2007). 
The brains of those with schizophrenia display a range of 
anatomical irregularities, encompassing reduced grey matter 
volume in frontal, temporal, limbic, striatal, and thalamic 
regions, as well as ventricular enlargement, and anomalies 
in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex (Kuo and 
Pogue-Geile 2019; Dabiri et al. 2022; Buckley 2005; For-
nito et al. 2009; Shenton et al. 2001; Pomarol-Clotet et al. 
2010). Estrogen possesses diverse neuroprotective attributes, 
which may be especially relevant in influencing the onset 
and progression of brain disorders in schizophrenia. In vivo 
and in vitro studies have shown that estrogenic compounds 
can protect brain cells from damage caused by excitotoxicity, 
oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis (Arevalo et al. 
2011; Arevalo et al. 2010; Bryant and Dorsa 2010; Yang 
et al. 2010; Vedder et al. 1999). Moreover, they have the 
capacity to enhance processes such as neurogenesis, angio-
genesis, synaptic density, plasticity, connectivity, axonal 
sprouting, remyelination, and the expression of neurotrophic 
factors (Yang et al. 2010; Riecher-Rössler and Häfner 1993; 
Li et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2010; Diotel et al. 2013; Trenti 
et al. 2018; Mahmoud et al. 2016). It is thought that these 
neuroprotective mechanisms are primarily mediated by the 
action of neuronal estrogen receptor-α (Elzer et al. 2010). 
Other findings also propose that the neuroprotective qualities 
of estrogens may arise from their preservation and enhance-
ment of neuronal mitochondrial function during injurious 
circumstances, as mitochondria are involved in regulating 
the survival and death of neurons (Simpkins et al. 2010; 
Klinge 2020) and may be impaired in the brains of individu-
als with schizophrenia (Rezin et al. 2009; Ni and Chung 
2020; Cuperfain et al. 2018; Kulkarni et al. 2019).

Moreover, estrogens increase dopamine sensitivity of 
dopamine D2/D3 receptors in the ventral tegmental area 
(VTA) (Brand et al. 2021; Vandegrift et al. 2017) that reduce 
psychotic symptoms. Circulating estrogens also modulate 

Estrogen and psychosis — a review and future directions  

879

other neurotransmitter systems relevant to schizophrenia, 
such as the serotonergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic, and 
cholinergic systems (Gogos et al. 2015; Steeds et al. 2015; 
Hwang et al. 2020). Some authors have even suggested that 
estradiol in the brain should be regarded as a neurotrans-
mitter itself (Balthazart and Ball 2006; Brann et al. 2022). 
Another potential rationale for the protective mechanism of 
estrogens could be attributed to the influence of heightened 
estrogen levels on regulating hippocampal plasticity (Adams 
et al. 2001; Sheppard et al. 2019; Finney et al. 2020). This 
modulation may lead to a decrease in the typical hippocam-
pal  dysconnectivity  observed  in  psychosis  (Bahner  and 
Meyer-Lindenberg 2017). Damme et al. (2020) examined 
whether earlier age of menarche would result in more nor-
mative hippocampal connectivity in clinical high-risk youth. 
They found that later age at menarche in the clinical high-
risk group related to increased hippocampal dysconnectiv-
ity to the occipital cortex — a region with a neurotrophic 
response to estrogen (Damme et al. 2020). However, more 
recent studies have failed to replicate a similar association 
between the age at menarche and age of illness onset (Bar-
rau-Sastre et al. 2022; Fassler et al. 2019).

Estrogen and hyperprolactinemia

Antipsychotic medications are frequently responsible for 
hyperprolactinemia (Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al. 2020), which 
is the result of the blockade of dopamine receptors on pro-
lactin-releasing cells in the anterior pituitary gland (Rubin, 
and T, Prolactin and schizophrenia 1987). When these cells 
are freed from the inhibition of dopamine, more prolactin is 
secreted, and this can lead to reduced estrogen levels. The 
prevalence of hyperprolactinemia in psychiatric patients is 
between 30 and 70% (Alosaimi et al. 2018), significantly 
higher than the general population (Alosaimi et al. 2018). 
Age does not appear to influence prevalence rates of hyper-
prolactinemia in men, but a decline of prolactin level with 
age was observed in women (Montgomery et al. 2004), sug-
gesting a postmenopausal effect. Although new data shows 
no age-related differences in prevalence (Alosaimi et al. 
2018), a possible explanation for the inconsistencies may 
be explained by methodological differences, especially in 
the cut-off level for defining hyperprolactinemia.

In a comprehensive meta-analysis comparing 32 oral 
antipsychotics for the acute treatment of adults with multi-
episode schizophrenia, it was discovered that olanzapine, 
asenapine, lurasidone, sertindole, haloperidol, amisulpride, 
risperidone, and paliperidone were associated with a signifi-
cant elevation in prolactin levels (Huhn et al. 2019). A recent 
meta-analysis further demonstrated that both newer antip-
sychotics (such as risperidone, amisulpride, and paliperi-
done) and older antipsychotics (including chlorpromazine, 

haloperidol, and sulpiride) were linked to an increase in 
prolactin levels, showing a substantial effect size (Zhu et al. 
2021). However, some newer antipsychotics, such as clo-
zapine and aripiprazole, have demonstrated either no effect 
or a potential decrease in serum prolactin levels (Zhu et al. 
2021; Kroigaard et al. 2022).

The impact of hyperprolactinemia, notably in its suppres-
sion of estrogen, has various physiological implications. In 
premenopausal women, antipsychotic-induced hyperpro-
lactinemia often leads to menstrual disturbances, ranging 
from luteal phase insufficiency to irregular or infrequency 
menses, and sometimes amenorrhoea (Gleeson et al. 2016; 
Lee and Kim 2006; Seppala and Hirvonen 1976). Galact-
orrhea, either alone or in conjunction with menstrual dis-
ruptions, can also manifest (Melmed and Kleinberg 2003). 
Hyperprolactinemia may also explain the decreased fertility 
observed in men and women with schizophrenia (Edinoff 
et al. 2021). In women, prolactin inhibits follicle-stimulating 
hormone by suppressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone, 
impeding ovulation (Matsuzaki et al. 1994; Koike et al. 
1991). Similarly, in men, prolactin inhibits gonadotropin 
release,  affecting  spermatogenesis  (Dabbous  and  Atkin 
2018). However, these are generally reversible upon restora-
tion of normal prolactin levels. Additionally, reduced estro-
gen levels due to hyperprolactinemia have been shown to 
accelerate bone loss, heighten osteoporosis risk, and weaken 
bones,  making  fractures  more  likely  (Mills  et  al. 2021; 
Papola et al. 2018). Hyperprolactinemia is also observed in 
antipsychotic-naïve patients. It is theorized that hyperprol-
actinemia in these patients could be explained by the activa-
tion of the stress response system. Stress has the potential 
to trigger the release of prolactin (Riecher-Rossler 2017), 
which subsequently prompts the secretion of dopamine, 
and this in turn can trigger psychotic symptoms. Recent 
research aligns with this hypothesis, demonstrating a cor-
relation between elevated prolactin levels and more severe 
psychotic  (Tharoor  et  al. 2020)  and  negative  symptoms 
(Sayed El Taweel and Abdalla 2017) in antipsychotic-naïve 
patients. The role of stress in inducing hyperprolactinemia 
may have a stronger effect on women than men in emerg-
ing psychosis (Ittig et al. 2017; Hoekstra et al. 2021). This 
may be explained by estradiol having a stimulatory effect on 
prolactin response to stress (Caligaris and Taleisnik 1983; 
Poletini et al. 2006), while progesterone has an inhibitory 
effect (Caligaris and Taleisnik 1983; Jahn and Deis 1986). 
However, higher prolactin levels have also been reported in 
antipsychotic-naïve male than in women (Gonzalez-Blanco 
et al. 2016).

Regardless  of  whether  hyperprolactinemia  is  caused 
by antipsychotic medication use or psychosocial stress, it 
should be screened in patients with schizophrenia. This is 
especially important for women with higher estrogen levels 
that should be maintained (i.e., premenopausal women), as 

880 

E. Mu et al.

women are generally more vulnerable to hyperprolactinemia 
(Gonzalez-Blanco et al. 2016). In this case, antipsychotic 
medications that either maintain or decrease prolactin should 
be favored over antipsychotics that increase prolactin (Gon-
zalez-Blanco et al. 2016).

Estrogen as a treatment in schizophrenia

Individuals  with  schizophrenia,  regardless  of  sex,  often 
reach a point where their responses to antipsychotic medica-
tions stabilize. Unfortunately, there exists a notable portion 
of individuals who exhibit limited or no positive response 
to antipsychotic (Kane 2012). For such patients, considering 
innovative supplementary treatments like estrogen augmen-
tation may hold significant importance.

Human clinical trials in schizophrenia 
with estrogens

The efficacy of exogenous estradiol treatment as a clinical 
treatment in women with schizophrenia has been extensively 
demonstrated by our group (Kulkarni et al. 2008a; Kulkarni 
et  al.  1996;  Kulkarni  et  al. 2016;  Kulkarni  et  al. 2015; 
Kulkarni et al. 2002). In 1996, we conducted the first trial 
of estradiol treatment for women with schizophrenia. We 
showed that the group receiving 20 mcg of adjunctive estro-
gen exhibited better recovery from acute psychotic symp-
toms than those who only received antipsychotics (Kulkarni 
et al. 1996). We then conducted subsequent double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study involving the adjunctive use of 
transdermal estradiol patches at dosages of 50 mcg, 100 
mcg, and 200 mcg in women with schizophrenia (Kulkarni 
et al. 2015; Kulkarni et al. 2001; Kulkarni et al. 2008b). Our 
research consistently demonstrated that adjunctive estradiol 
treatment led to an improvement in psychosis symptoms in 
women, particularly with the use of 100 mcg transdermal 
estradiol. We also conducted a small-scale study involving 
men with schizophrenia, where adjunctive estradiol was 
found to have a positive impact on psychotic symptoms in 
this population (Kulkarni et al. 1999). Our findings have 
since been replicated in other clinical trials (Li et al. 2023; 
Akhondzadeh et al. 2003; Begemann et al. 2012). More 
recently, Weiser et al. (2019) found that transdermal estra-
diol is an effective adjunct treatment for women of child-
bearing age with schizophrenia. It also found improvements 
in negative symptoms and that the effect could be specific to 
those older than 38 years (Weiser et al. 2019).

Estradiol has also been found to be effective in improv-
ing cognition in women with schizophrenia compared with 
placebo (Ko et al. 2006). Cognitive improvements would be 
in line with studies suggesting a positive effect of 17-beta-
estradiol on cognitive function in healthy ageing women

More  recently,  we  highlighted  for  the  first  time  that 
responses  to  estrogen  treatment  are  heterogenous.  In  a 
repeated-measures study, we characterized the association 
between hormone levels (estrogen, progesterone, testoster-
one, prolactin, FSG, LH, DHEA) and symptom treatment 
outcomes (using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS)) in women with schizophrenia taking adjunctive 
estradiol treatment (Thomas et al. 2021). From 56 patients, 
the results generated two subgroups: a treatment-responder 
group who demonstrated decreasing PANSS scores across 
time  and  a  treatment-non-responder  group,  demonstrat-
ing stable PANSS scores across time. The data indicates 
that conducting multiple assessments of estradiol levels 
could  pave  the  way  for  creating  a  molecular  blood  test. 
This test would be valuable in aiding clinicians in ascer-
taining whether endocrine modulation is a viable treatment 
approach for individual patients.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)

The extended use of estrogen as an adjunctive treatment for 
women with schizophrenia raises potential concerns, par-
ticularly regarding its impact on breast and uterine tissue, as 
well as its feminizing effects in men (Kulkarni et al. 2012). 
Recent advancements in selective estrogen receptor modu-
lators (SERMs) offer a promising avenue for intervention. 
SERMs offer the benefit of exerting antagonistic effects in 
breast and uterine tissues, while displaying agonistic effects 
in other tissues such as bone, and were primarily designed 
for the treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis (Komm 
et al. 2005; Komm and Mirkin 2014).

Raloxifene, a form of SERMs, has been shown to be a 
safe and effective option for treating schizophrenia symp-
toms. Several double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated 
the effectiveness of raloxifene in improving symptoms of 
schizophrenia, including positive symptoms (Usall et al. 
2011; Kianimehr et al. 2014), negative symptoms (Usall 
et al. 2011; Usall et al. 2016), general psychopathology 
(Kulkarni  et  al. 2016;  Usall  et  al. 2011;  Kulkarni  et  al. 
2010), and cognitive functions (Weickert et al. 2015; Huerta-
Ramos et al. 2014). A meta-analysis showed that raloxifene 
had significant positive effects on total symptom severity, as 
well as on positive, negative, and general PANSS subscales 
(De Boer et al. 2018). These findings are consistent with 
meta-analyses on raloxifene use in postmenopausal women 
with schizophrenia (Wang et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2018). More 
recently, however, results from a double-blind, randomized 
clinical trial conducted by Brand et al. (2023) do not support 
the use of raloxifene in patients with schizophrenia-spec-
trum disorder in general. Instead, it was proposed that the 
effects of raloxifene may be dependent on sex, with a ben-
eficial effect of raloxifene on negative symptoms only seen 
in women (Brand et al. 2023). These new findings warrant 

Estrogen and psychosis — a review and future directions  

881

further exploration of the potential sex-specific effects of 
raloxifene.

Raloxifene has also been shown to enhance cognition. In 
a 12-week double-blind study, Huerta-Ramos et al. found 
significant differences in memory and executive function 
with the addition of 60 mg raloxifene (Huerta-Ramos et al. 
2014). However, these effects were not replicated in a sepa-
rate 24-week study (Huerta-Ramos et al. 2020). Research 
investigating the cognitive effects of high-dose raloxifene 
(120 mg) in healthy, postmenopausal women demonstrated 
a slight enhancement in verbal memory performance after 1 
month of treatment (Nickelsen et al. 1999). These findings 
are consistent with those of Yaffe et al. (2005), who com-
pared two doses of raloxifene (60 mg/day and 120 mg/day) 
with placebo in postmenopausal women exhibiting varying 
cognitive states. Their study revealed that women receiving 
a daily dose of 120 mg of raloxifene exhibited superior cog-
nitive outcomes compared to those on 60 mg or the placebo 
(Yaffe et al. 2005).

These results are in line with our dose-finding study, 
which amalgamated data from both current and previous 
randomized controlled trials involving 35 postmenopausal 
women (Kulkarni et al. 2010). This analysis highlighted 
those participants receiving 120 mg, as opposed to 60 mg 
or placebo, experienced a significantly greater alleviation 
of psychotic symptom. Similarly, Weickert et al. found that 
a daily dose of 120 mg raloxifene improved cognitive func-
tion in young and middle-aged women as well as men with 
schizophrenia symptoms (Weickert et al. 2015), suggesting 
its positive action on cognitive extends to both sexes and 
across different age groups.

A recent narrative review failed to report raloxifene to 
have substantial effects on mood and cognitive symptoms 
in healthy postmenopausal women (González-Rodríguez 
et  al.  2022).  Instead,  raloxifene  may  have  a  beneficial 
effect on sleep disorders, with women receiving raloxifene 
reporting better sleep quality compared to the control group 
(González-Rodríguez et al. 2022). Considering the common 
occurrence of insomnia in individuals with schizophrenia 
and the likelihood of higher rates of insomnia and other 
sleep disturbances in postmenopausal women with schiz-
ophrenia, it is possible that raloxifene may have positive 
effects in alleviating insomnia in this demographic.

Next-generation SERM — bazedoxifene — may have a 
greater impact on the CNS and therefore provide the consist-
ent outcomes sought for people with schizophrenia. Baze-
doxifene binds to both α and β intracellular estrogen recep-
tor subtypes. Unlike raloxifene, it was developed with an 
indole-based structure featuring a 2-phenyl ring system as 
the core-binding unit, in contrast to the benzothiophene core 
(Kulkarni et al. 2019). This structural deviation accounts 
for bazedoxifene’s enhanced tissue selectivity when com-
pared to other SERMs (Vestergaard and Thomsen 2010). A 

recent systematic review and meta-analysis affirm the sub-
stantial benefits of bazedoxifene in addressing bone-related 
concerns and osteoporosis, all without an increased risk of 
adverse or serious events, including myocardial infarction, 
stroke, venous thromboembolic event, or breast carcinoma 
(Peng et al. 2017). Moreover, it has been suggested that 
bazedoxifene has a safer breast health profile compared to 
other SERMs (Pickar and Komm 2015), which is extremely 
important for long-term use particularly in women.

Bazedoxifene has also been shown to cross the blood-
brain barrier and enhance cognition. In mice, Hill et al. 
(2020)  demonstrated  that  bazedoxifene  can  effectively 
enter the brain, activate neural estrogen response element 
in the brain, and acutely rescue ovariectomy-induced spatial 
memory deficits. The findings suggest bazedoxifene could 
be a viable cognitive enhancer with promising clinical appli-
cability. Kulkarni and colleagues are currently conducting 
the first clinical trial examining the impact of bazedoxifene 
as an adjunctive treatment in the treatment of women with 
schizophrenia.

Hormonal contraceptives and schizophrenia

Most women with schizophrenia are of reproductive age. 
Hormonal contraceptives, including the oral contraceptive 
pill, are an effective and easy contraceptive method that has 
provided women with a greater degree of control over their 
reproductive lives for centuries. However, very few women 
with schizophrenia seek contraceptive advice, lacking suffi-
cient information about contraception options. Many women 
with schizophrenia are sexually active and research indi-
cates a prevalence of unwanted pregnancies ranging between 
24.3 and 47.5% within this population (Posada Correa et al. 
2020). Considering the challenges of daily pill adherence 
among women with schizophrenia, alternative contracep-
tive methods such as intrauterine devices, depot injections 
of progesterone, and tubal ligation are often recommended 
(Miller and Finnerty 1998).

Despite the extensive body of research examining estro-
gen’s impact on schizophrenia and cognition, as well as the 
broader effects of oral contraceptives on cognition, there is 
limited research investigating the specific influence of oral 
contraceptives in schizophrenia. However, the combined 
oral contraceptive pill is clinically employed as an estrogen 
treatment for younger women diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
Addressing this gap requires randomized controlled trials 
specifically focusing on oral contraceptive use in women 
with schizophrenia.

Importantly, it has been recently shown that in women 
who are susceptible to mood disorders, including schizo-
phrenia, hormonal contraceptives may precipitate or per-
petuate depression (Mu and Kulkarni 2022). In particular, 
older oral contraceptive pills containing ethinylestradiol, the 

882 

E. Mu et al.

estrogen component of the pill, are linked to severe mood 
problems, whereas newer versions containing physiological 
forms of estrogen may be better tolerated and show a weaker 
association with mood problems. This highlights the impor-
tance for clinicians to carefully evaluate the contraceptive 
formulation and timing concerning the onset or exacerbation 
of mood changes in susceptible individuals, including those 
with schizophrenia.

Clinical recommendations and future 
directions

The  key  clinical  recommendations  are  to  ensure  that  a 
menstrual history is taken in all women who present with 
psychosis  to  determine  whether  there  is  an  association 
between their menstrual cycle and the severity of psychotic 
symptoms.

It is also important to recognize the likelihood of relapse 
or new onset of psychotic illness during perimenopause, 
especially  among  women  with  a  history  of  exacerbated 
symptoms during the menstrual cycle or postpartum period. 
This is especially crucial as these women appear particularly 
vulnerable to mental state fluctuations linked to hormonal 
shifts. The potential therapeutic benefits of menopause hor-
mone therapy can be explored in these women who may 
significantly  benefit  from  estrogen  augmentation.  This 
approach is preferred compared to increasing the dosage 
of antipsychotic medications to counteract the exacerbated 
symptoms and reduced enzyme production responsible for 
metabolizing these medications caused by decreased estro-
gen levels. Relatedly, it is crucial to develop safe and effec-
tive approaches for reducing antipsychotic doses to minimize 
risks associated with hyperprolactinemia, decreased bone 
density, heightened chances of heart disease and stroke, and 
increased cancer mortality rates. Restoring adequate estro-
gen levels is essential to ameliorate these consequences.

In relation to future research, there is a need for more 
studies and randomized controlled trials in women with 
schizophrenia. Understanding the efficacy and impact of 
estrogen treatments, such as oral contraceptive pills and 
newer generation SERMs like bazedoxifene, in women with 
schizophrenia is crucial for clinicians and researchers alike. 
Conducting randomized controlled trials focused on these 
treatments will offer valuable insights into their effective-
ness, safety, and potential as adjunctive therapies for manag-
ing psychotic symptoms.

From a mechanistic point of view, future research prob-
ing  the  links  between  decreased  estrogen  and  psychotic 
symptoms is crucial to better understand how hormonal 
changes during the menopausal transition affect the brain 
and psychotic symptoms, as well as understanding variations 
between individuals in their sensitivity to hormonal changes. 

In addition to the direct impact of hormonal changes during 
menopause, it is important for future research to explore the 
additional effects of other menopausal symptoms on overall 
well-being and the role of other menopause symptoms in 
psychosis. For example, while the effects of lower estrogen 
and psychotic symptoms are well documented, the relation-
ship between vasomotor symptoms and psychosis in meno-
pause has not been explored. Expanding this understanding 
will assist clinicians to anticipate, recognize, and address 
potential mental health challenges during menopause, con-
tributing to more tailored and effective treatment strategies 
for  women  experiencing  both  vasomotor  and  psychotic 
symptoms.

Conclusion

The promising findings regarding hormone treatments in 
psychosis present a compelling avenue for future research 
and clinical interventions. Leveraging estradiol as a “win-
dow to the brain” holds great potential for deepening our 
understanding of the underlying causes of psychotic disor-
ders. For individuals with schizophrenia, especially those 
who have limited response to antipsychotics, adjunctive 
estrogen could be considered. The research suggests that 
this approach may lead to improved symptom management 
and  cognitive  function.  Additionally,  it  is  imperative  to 
acknowledge the unique impact of menopause on women 
with schizophrenia, highlighting the critical need for tar-
geted hormone treatments to proactively prevent relapses. 
Emphasizing women’s mental health as a distinct neurobio-
logical domain is paramount, as it provides a refined frame-
work to inform more effective and tailored treatments. This 
approach not only advances the field of psychiatry but also 
holds the potential of significantly improving the well-being 
and outcomes of women affected by psychosis. The risk and 
benefits of short- and long-term use of hormone therapy 
should be discussed prior to commencement of any form of 
estrogen therapy.
