The link between bipolar disorder (BP) and immune dysfunction remains controversial. While epidemiological studies have long
suggested an association, recent research has found only limited evidence of such a relationship. To clarify this, we performed an
exploratory study of the contributions of immune-relevant genetic factors to the response to lithium (Li) treatment and the clinical
presentation of BP. First, we assessed the association of a large collection of immune-related genes (4925) with Li response, deﬁned
by the Retrospective Assessment of the Lithium Response Phenotype Scale (Alda scale), and clinical characteristics in patients with
BP from the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen, N = 2374). Second, we calculated here previously published
polygenic scores (PGSs) for immune-related traits and evaluated their associations with Li response and clinical features. Overall, we
observed relatively weak associations (p < 1 × 10−4) with BP phenotypes within immune-related genes. Network and functional
enrichment analyses of the top ﬁndings from the association analyses of Li response variables showed an overrepresentation of
pathways participating in cell adhesion and intercellular communication. These appeared to converge on the well-known Li-
induced inhibition of GSK-3β. Association analyses of age-at-onset, number of mood episodes, and presence of psychosis,
substance abuse and/or suicidal ideation suggested modest contributions of genes such as RTN4, XKR4, NRXN1, NRG1/3 and GRK5 to
disease characteristics. PGS analyses returned weak associations (p < 0.05) between inﬂammation markers and the studied BP
phenotypes. Our results suggest a modest relationship between immunity and clinical features in BP. More research is needed to
assess the potential therapeutic relevance.

INTRODUCTION
Bipolar disorder (BP) has been associated with some degree of
immune dysfunction. Epidemiological data has linked immune-

observed during affective episodes in patients with BP [1]. In
addition, genomic studies have revealed weak yet signiﬁcant
genetic correlation between BP and immune-related diseases
[2]. Nevertheless, as a number of these observations originated
from underpowered studies [3],
investigations are
required to elucidate the proposed relationships.

further

Lithium (Li), mainly used in the treatment of BP,

is an
effective pharmacological agent in the treatment of an array of
psychiatric conditions [4, 5]. In addition to its mood-stabilizing
effects, Li shows anti-viral and immune cell regulatory proper-
ties [6, 7]. The immune regulatory activity of Li has been
partially attributed to the modulation of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines and GSK-3β. Therefore, it has been suggested that

the mechanism through which Li improves symptom progres-
sion may be via anti-inﬂammatory effects [8, 9]. The Retro-
spective Assessment of the Lithium Response Phenotype Scale
(Alda scale) is the most widely used clinical measure of Li
response. Most often, it is dichotomized such that individuals
with scores ≥7 are classiﬁed as “responders” and those with
scores <7 as “non-responders” [10, 11]. Using this metric,
previous genetic studies have implicated human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) and inﬂammatory cytokine genes
in the
response to Li
in BP [12, 13]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
to Li
immune-related genes contribute,
response and further, may impact speciﬁc clinical
features
within BP. To test our hypothesis, we performed association
studies of a comprehensive collection of immune-related genes
in 2374 patients with BP from the International Consortium on
Lithium Genetics (ConLi+Gen)
[14]. Additionally, we tested
associations with published polygenic scores
for
immune-relevant traits.

Study sample
The ConLi+Gen cohort has been previously described in detail [15]. Brieﬂy,
peripheral blood samples from individuals with diagnosis of a bipolar
spectrum disorder (in accordance with the criteria established in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—DSM—versions III
or IV) that had taken Li for a minimum of 6 months (with no additional
mood stabilizers), were collected from 2003 to 2013 at various sites in
Europe, the United States, Australia and East Asia. The isolated DNA was
genotyped in two phases. This resulted in two sample batches originally
referred to as “GWAS1” and “GWAS2”, comprising 1162 and 1401
individuals,
treatment were
assessed in both sample batches using the Alda scale. Here, the A
subscale rates the degree of response on a 10-point scale, and the B
subscale reﬂects the relationship between improvement and treatment. A
total score, ranging from 0–10, is obtained by subtracting the B score from
the A score of these subscales. Negative scores are set to 0. Data on age-at-
onset
(AAO), age (at sample collection and phenotyping), sex and
diagnostic subtype were available for both sample batches. Diagnoses
included bipolar disorder type I and type II, schizoaffective bipolar disorder
and bipolar disorder not otherwise speciﬁed. Additionally, information on
psychiatric features, namely the number of episodes of depression, mania
and hypomania, the presence of psychosis, alcohol and substance abuse,
and suicidal ideation, were available for patients in the “GWAS1” batch.

The Ethics Committee at the University of Heidelberg provided central
approval for the ConLi+Gen Consortium. Written informed consent from all
participants was obtained according to the study protocols of each of the
participating sites and their institutions. All procedures were performed in
accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Immune gene collection
A comprehensive set of immune-related genes was collated from gene lists
available in the online databases MSigDB [16] and InnateDB [17]. From
MSigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/), the following gene
sets contained in the C2 “curated gene sets” collection were retrieved:
M1036: Reactome-innate immune system, M1058: Reactome-adaptive
immune system, M39895: WikiPathways (WP)-neuroinﬂammation, M39711:
WP-cytokines and inﬂammatory response, and M39641: WP-inﬂammatory
response pathway. From InnateDB (https://www.innatedb.com/index.jsp), the
curated gene lists derived from the Immunology Database and Analysis
Portal (ImmPort), the Immunogenetic Related Information Source (IRIS) and
the Immunome Database, were downloaded. Chromosomal locations were
annotated from Ensembl using the hg19 build. Herein, the combined
collection is referred to as the ImmuneSet and contained 4925 autosomal
genes to be included in association analyses.

Genotype data
Schubert et al. [18] have previously described the creation of the genotype
dataset used herein. Brieﬂy, DNA samples were originally genotyped using
either Affymetrix or Illumina SNP arrays. These genotype data from
multiple cohorts were separately imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project
reference panel phase 3 v5. Each imputed dataset underwent a basic
quality control (QC) step to keep variants with minor allele frequency
(MAF) > 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p value (HWE) ≥ 1 × 10−6 and
imputation quality score (Rsq) ≥ 0.6. Genotype calls were derived from the
imputed dosage scores and all datasets were merged by retaining only
common sets of SNPs. To update this dataset and obtain a higher number
of good quality variants, we re-imputed the genotype data via the
Michigan Imputation Server [19] using the Haplotype Reference Con-
sortium (HRC) panel for European ancestry. The re-imputed genotypes
underwent a QC step to keep variants with Rsq ≥ 0.8, MAF ≥ 0.01 and
HWE ≥ 1 × 10−6. Additionally, individuals were removed if they failed the
heterozygosity test and/or showed relatedness, according to the tests

Polygenic scores
A set of 32 published PGSs available at the PGS Catalog [21] were used to
approximate markers of inﬂammation and immune-related phenotypes
that were not experimentally measured in the “GWAS1” ConLi+Gen
sample. These PGSs, created and evaluated in large samples of
predominantly European ancestry, stemmed from three recent publica-
tions and corresponded to the following traits: autoimmune disease [22],
lymphocyte/monocyte/eosinophil/neutrophil/basophil
of
white (blood) cells [23], and serum levels of 26 markers of inﬂammation
[24]. After downloading and harmonizing weight ﬁles, we performed allelic
scoring in ConLi+Gen using the sum method applied in Plink 1.9 [25]. Sum
scores were standardized for statistical analysis.

Association analyses
The “GWAS1” (N = 853) and “GWAS2” (N = 1258) samples were tested
separately for associations of 701,031 SNPs in the ImmuneSet with: (1) Li
response (responder/non-responder, deﬁned by Alda scores ≥7 or <7,
respectively), (2) total Alda score, (3) Alda subscale A, and (4) Alda subscale
B (total). Because the most reliable continuous Li response phenotype has
been previously shown to be the Alda A score, when excluding individuals
with Alda B scores >4 [10], we tested this as the primary continuous
phenotype in our study. All association tests were performed applying an
additive model
in Plink 1.9, and all models were adjusted for age at
recruitment, age-at-onset (AAO), sex, diagnosis and the ﬁrst principal
components (PCs) obtained for each ImmuneSet genotypes dataset. PCA
plots were explored to determine the optimal number of PCs to be used as
covariates for each sample. Therefore, the ﬁrst ﬁve PCs were used as
covariates for “GWAS1” while the ﬁrst six PCs were used for “GWAS2”.
Population stratiﬁcation due to ancestry (i.e., European or East Asian) and
site was corrected by the selected numbers of PCs
recruitment
(Supplementary File 1: Fig. S2). Next, the association results for Li response
from “GWAS1” and “GWAS2” samples were meta-analyzed using the
weighted-z (METAL) method applied in Plink 1.9. These meta-analysis
results were QCed to exclude variants with I2 heterogeneity index (I) > 40
and p value for Cochran’s Q statistic (Q) < 0.1 (highly heterogeneous). We
searched ﬁrst for associations at the commonly accepted thresholds for
GWASs (genome-wide association, p < 5 × 10−8, and suggestive associa-
tion, p < 1 × 10−5). However, considering this a candidate gene rather than
a genome-wide approach, we chose to look further into ﬁndings with
p < 1 × 10−4, a threshold that has been previously used to select
association ﬁndings for follow-up in GWASs [26] and, therefore, represents
an acceptable exploratory threshold.

In “GWAS1”, the ImmuneSet was further tested for associations with
other BP clinical phenotypes (i.e., AAO, the number of episodes of
depression, mania and hypomania, as well as the presence of psychosis,
alcohol and/or substance abuse, and suicidal ideation). These models were
adjusted for age at recruitment, AAO (except when AAO was tested as
phenotype), sex, diagnosis and the ﬁrst ﬁve PCs. Statistical association and
exploratory thresholds were considered as above.

Associations between PGSs and the various BP clinical phenotypes were
tested using linear or binomial regression models, as appropriate, adjusted
for age at recruitment, AAO (except when AAO was tested as phenotype),
sex, diagnosis, recruitment site and the ﬁrst 10 PCs obtained from the
genotypes using the robustbase R package. Statistical association was set
to false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The exploratory threshold was set to
p < 0.05.

Downstream analyses
All variants under the p < 1 × 10−4 threshold were annotated for known
regulatory effects on gene expression (i.e., expression quantitative trait loci,
eQTLs) in all human brain, blood, spleen and thyroid tissues, as well as in
immune cells (e.g., monocytes and macrophages) using Qtlizer [27].

A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to investigate the functional
relevance of the genes linked to Li response by the exploratory analyses
was created using the ReactomeFIViz app [28] for Cytoscape 3.7 [29]. This
analysis used as input a list composed of the ImmuneSet genes showing
associations at the p < 1 × 10−4 threshold with the dichotomous and
continuous Li response phenotypes. The network also incorporated “linker”
genes (i.e., genes not in the input gene list that create indirect connections
between input genes) to increase biological
interpretability. Moreover,
pathway overrepresentation analysis was performed on the PPI network
(including linker genes) using the pathway enrichment network function of
the app. Because the linker genes were not drawn from the ImmuneSet
collection, we used the standard background genes of the ReactomeFiViz

app for this analysis. The resulting overrepresented pathways were ﬁltered
to exclude terms that: (1) had FDR > 0.05, (2) corresponded to a speciﬁc
disease (e.g., bladder cancer, herpes virus infection), (3) had less than two
genes overlapping between the pathway set and the network set, and/or
(4) the overlap with the pathway set represented less than 3% of genes in
the set. Additionally, we repeated the pathway overrepresentation analysis
including not only the variant mapped genes, but also the annotated
eQTL genes.

For associations with clinical phenotypes in the “GWAS1” sample,
functional analyses were performed using the GENE2FUNC tool of the
Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies
(FUMA-GWAS) platform [30]. The input gene lists included mapped and
eQTL genes annotated for variants below the p < 1 × 10−4 threshold for
each studied phenotype. Because eQTL genes were not drawn from our
ImmuneSet collection, we used all protein-coding genes as background for
these analyses. Overrepresented gene sets were those that showed
FDR < 0.05,
following a hypergeometric test, and a minimum of two
overlapping genes. Curated gene sets from pathway databases in the
“canonical pathways” category were preferred when available. Otherwise,
Gene Ontology biological processes (GO_BPs) or any other available
category (including GWAS Catalog trait associations) were taken. For GTEx-
based enriched tissues of expression, as our focus is on immune-brain
relationships, we kept only those enrichments corresponding to brain
expression, as these are the most relevant tissues for the analysis of Li
response and clinical features of BP.

In addition, the relative importance for (dichotomous) Li response of
the calculated PGSs in “GWAS1” was assessed through a machine learning
(ML) screening approach using the Auto Model extension of RapidMiner
Studio. This applied various classiﬁcation algorithms to the raw PGS data.
Auto Model provides the following models: Naïve Bayes, Generalized
Linear Model, Logistic Regression, Fast Large Margin, Deep Learning,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees and Support Vector
Machines. Because ML algorithms are sensitive to class imbalance, an
equal number of

analyses in ConLi+Gen were 853 and 1258 in “GWAS1” and
“GWAS2”, respectively. A basic description of both samples is
shown in Table 1. In general, there were more female than male
patients in both samples and there were minimal differences in
recruitment and disease onset between
the mean ages at
“GWAS1” and “GWAS2”. Therefore, the total sample size of our

the dichotomized
variable, which included 1224 (58%) females and 887 males, with
mean age 47 (±14) years and mean AAO 25 (±11) years. For the
continuous Li response phenotype (i.e., Alda A score, excluding
individuals with Alda B score >4), the effective sample sizes were
828 for “GWAS1” and 1044 for “GWAS2”. After the post-meta-
analysis exclusion of variants with heterogeneous effects between
both ConLi+Gen samples, a mean of 556,196 SNPs remained in
each set of summary statistics. This was higher for the continuous
phenotype, in which 625,818 SNPs remained.

Immune-related genes showed modest associations with
response to Li treatment in BP
We found no associations with Li response at the genome-wide
GWAS threshold (p < 5 × 10−8). At the suggestive threshold for
GWAS (p < 1 × 10−5), the dichotomous Li response phenotype and
Alda B (total) showed associations with FAT3 (best SNP: rs4313539,
p = 2.1 × 10−6, z = 4.744), and with ADAMTS5 (best SNP: rs162501,
p = 9.18 × 10−7, z = 4.909) and GRID2 (best SNP:
rs62312225,
p = 2.71 × 10−6, z = 4.692), respectively (Supplementary File 2:
Table 1).

At the exploratory threshold (p < 1 × 10−4), when considering
linkage disequilibrium (LD), we identiﬁed between 9 and 12
genomic loci
in relation with different aspects of Li response
(Supplementary File 2: Table 1). The top SNPs from the analyses of
the dichotomous and continuous phenotypes mapped to FAT3
and BMPR1A, respectively (Table 2). In total, 42 genes were linked
to the response to Li in patients with BP from our exploratory
analyses in the ConLi+Gen cohort (Supplementary File 3: Table 1).
There was a number of gene-based overlaps between different
aspects of Li response, particularly between the dichotomous

immune pathways remained overrepresented (data not shown).
All protein-coding eQTL genes annotated for Li
response
phenotypes are shown in Fig. 2A.

Immune-related genes showed modest associations with
clinical phenotypes in BP
The association analyses of the ImmuneSet with speciﬁc clinical
features that were available for the “GWAS1” sample showed no
associations at the genome-wide GWAS threshold. However, at
the suggestive GWAS threshold there were, collectively, 100
associations between the ImmuneSet and AAO (3), number of
depressive (54) and manic (14) episodes, and the presence of
psychosis (1), substance use disorder (15) and/or suicidal ideation
(13). These covered 17 genes that associated to speciﬁc clinical
features (i.e., no overlaps were observed at this threshold; Table 3).
When we moved forward to the exploratory analysis, we
identiﬁed 786 SNP-phenotype associations in total (Supplemen-
tary File 2: Tables 2–9). These involved 166 immune-related genes
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary File 3: Table 1) mostly involved in
adaptive immunity and inﬂammation. Beyond their
immune
functions, according to our functional analyses, these genes play
important roles in the development of the nervous system, signal
transduction, synaptic processes and cell adhesion (Supplemen-
tary File 3: Tables 3–9). In particular, large numbers of associations
were suggested for AAO and mood episodes (Table 3). In addition,
156 eQTL genes were collectively annotated for these phenotypes.
Figure 2A shows the protein-coding eQTL genes annotated for
each clinical feature. These showed no overlaps among the clinical
phenotypes. Nevertheless, there were some overlaps with the
ImmuneSet genes given that, in some instances, the eQTL gene
corresponded to the gene mapped to the variant while, in others,
the eQTL gene was different from the mapped gene. A summary
of exploratory ﬁndings for each clinical phenotype studied can be
found in the Supplementary File 1: Supplementary Results.

Immune-related genes showed pleiotropy for BP phenotypes
A number of genes showed shared associations with the
different phenotypes included in our exploratory ImmuneSet
analyses in ConLi+Gen (Fig. 1A). These genes can be prioritized
for follow-up studies due to their pleiotropic effects in Li
response, clinical features, or both. In this way, we prioritized

obtained from PGS Catalog and the SNPs available in our
ConLi+Gen “GWAS1” sample was, in general, better for the serum
levels of inﬂammatory markers (80.6% in average) than for the
other PGSs. The lowest valid SNP overlap was observed for the
PGS of general autoimmune disease (38.8%). For the proportion of
white blood cell populations, the valid SNP overlap was also not
fully satisfactory (49.4% in average). Results from these analyses
should be interpreted with caution, as the calculated PGSs may
poorly index autoimmune disease and the proportion of white
blood cell signatures.

We identiﬁed 15 PGS nominal (p < 0.05) associations with BP
phenotypes (Fig. 2B): six with AAO (basophils, CD40, CXCL6/16, IL-
6/8), three with the number of episodes of hypomania (CCL20,
CX3CL1, HSP27) and Li response (monocytes, CHI3L1, TNFSF14),
two with the presence of suicidal ideation (eosinophils, ECP), and
one with the number of depressive episodes (FAS). However, none
of these survived correction for multiple comparisons (Supple-
mentary File 3: Table 10).

Finally, ML-based PGS ranking for the dichotomized Li response
suggested relative importance of serum markers of inﬂammation
such as ECP, HSP27, CHI3L1, TRAILR2 and TNFSF14 for
the
prediction of responses to Li treatment in ConLi+Gen (Supple-
mentary File 1: Fig. S3).

DISCUSSION
There is apparent mounting evidence of immune dysregulation in
BP and other major psychiatric diseases. Nevertheless, some
observations have originated from underpowered studies, result-
ing in a lack of reproducibility [3]. Therefore, it becomes crucial to
gain a better understanding of the relationships between the
immune and central nervous systems, and to discern between
causes and consequences of disease. With this in mind, we sought
to investigate how genetic factors relevant to immune activity
relate to disease phenotypes, such as response to Li treatment,
AAO and psychiatric symptoms,
in patients with BP. Using an
exploratory and extensive candidate gene approach, our study
suggested various genes and inﬂammatory markers that appeared
to represent potential pleiotropic factors with modest contribu-
tions to multiple BP phenotypes. However, we should note that,
here, we refer to pleiotropy as the (suggested) association with
multiple traits in the ConLi+Gen cohort and, by no means, have
we implied that these features are independent from each other.
In fact, it should be expected that, given the important correlation
between psychiatric disorders, the features that we have studied
in ConLi+Gen are, to some extent, also correlated with each other.
Additionally, because genes can play different roles in different
tissues and cell types, we observed widespread enrichments of
biological pathways participating in the development and
function of the brain. This suggested that the genes contributing
to shape BP phenotypes might affect in parallel both the immune
and nervous systems. Nevertheless, because we found no
associations at the genome-wide GWAS threshold, and those
observed at the suggestive GWAS threshold were limited, our
ﬁndings are also consistent with a relatively weak effect of
immune genetic factors over BP phenotypes.

The results of our exploratory assessment of associations of
genetic polymorphisms in immune-related genes with Li response
in the ConLi+Gen cohort suggest that variations in multiple
inﬂammatory and adaptive immune processes might modestly
contribute to the response to Li treatment in patients with BP.
Importantly, our network and gene set enrichment analyses

localized these modest contributions to numerous biological
that participate in cell adhesion, migration and
pathways
intercellular communication, which help in the development
and maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems,
as well as of the immune and vascular systems. Interestingly, many
of these processes appear to converge in the participation of GSK-
3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta), as assessed through
comparative overlap analysis of the enriched KEGG and Reactome
gene sets. GSK-3β is involved in multiple major developmental
pathways, such as the Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog signaling
pathways. Genetic manipulation in mouse models has shown an
antidepressant-like behavior upon GSK-3β knockdown in hippo-
campus, as well as cognitive, behavioral and biochemical changes
including Alzheimer’s
associated with psychiatric disorders,
disease, BP and schizophrenia, upon GSK-3β overexpression [31].
Li possesses a well-known inhibitory effect over GSK-3β [32].
Therefore, our analyses suggest that GSK-3β might be a relevant
player in the biological response to Li treatment in BP. Our
ﬁndings are also in agreement with other epidemiological and
molecular investigations of Li effects. For example, we observed
overrepresentation of various gene sets related to thyroid
function, such as thyroid-stimulating hormone signaling and
autoimmune thyroid disease. This is in line with the reports of a
reversible association of Li
treatment with hypothyroidism,
particularly in women [33, 34].

Taken together,

the encouraging literature supporting our
exploratory ﬁndings sparked our interest in evaluating how a
such as
genetic measure (PGS) of
inﬂammatory marker levels in serum and the proportion of white
blood cells, might associate with Li response in ConLi+Gen. Here,
we observed only weak statistical associations. However, one
might consider
these results inconclusive given the limited
overlap between PGS weight variants and our ConLi+Gen dataset.
Moreover, it must be kept in mind that PGSs have an incomplete
indexing of the trait and, in this case, do not reﬂect the real levels
of inﬂammation markers present in the serum of these patients.
Considering this, we adopted a different approach to explore the

relationship between PGSs and the dichotomous Li response in
ConLi+Gen. Here, we used RapidMiner’s Auto Model to probe
various ML algorithms and extract the relative importance of each
PGS to predict Li
response. Given the PGS complications
mentioned above and the well-known ﬁtting issues arising from
the use of small sample sizes in predictive modeling, we expected
a relatively poor overall performance of the PGS model and,
hence, we were not looking to evaluate predictive value. Indeed,
the accuracy of the tested algorithms was only 43–56% (data not
shown). These observations should be interpreted with caution
due to the relatively low robustness of split validation in assessing
model performance compared to other validation approaches
used in predictive ML. Nevertheless, applied for feature impor-
tance ranking, this ML approach had the advantage of providing
information on the PGS relationships with Li response when
compared to one another.

The results of our exploratory assessment of associations of
genetic polymorphisms in the ImmuneSet genes with BP’s AAO,
numbers of mood episodes and psychiatric comorbidities in
ConLi+Gen identiﬁed various genes potentially contributing to
including XKR4, NRXN1,
mood episodes and substance abuse,
GRK5 and NRG1/3. These genes, besides their immune-related
functionalities, seem to play important roles in neuronal develop-
ment and function, according to our gene set enrichment
analyses. Indeed, this could be corroborated by the literature in
many instances. For example, NRXN1, a cell surface protein
involved in cell-cell interactions, exocytosis of secretory granules
and regulation of signal transmission, has been associated with
autism, schizophrenia and nicotine dependence [35]. GRK5 has a
role in the regulation of motility in polymorphonuclear leukocytes
and inﬂammation [36, 37]. It also regulates the activity of various
G-protein coupled receptors, including neurotransmitter receptors
[38]. XKR4, a phospholipid scramblase strongly expressed in brain
tissue and activated by caspases, has been suggested to
participate in the remodeling of neural networks by triggering
microglial responses to the exposure of phosphatidylserine on
axons, dendrites and synapses [39].

It is worth noting that three of our potential candidate genes for
depressive episodes have previously shown associations with
either major depression at the gene-level (DCC) [40] or mapped to
schizophrenia loci (CR1L and DGKI) [41] in large GWASs. Moreover,
one of our suggested candidates for manic episodes, ESR2, and
substance use disorder, BTN3A2, were previously
one for
associated at the gene-level with major depression in the large
GWAS, while one of our candidates for hypomanic episodes and
the BP-associated RIMS1 [26], mapped
alcohol dependence,
previously to schizophrenia loci. This, together with the overlaps
with reported BP-associated genes that we observed, particularly
concerning known eQTL genes, provides some support to the
validity of our exploratory ﬁndings.

Finally, even when our assessment of PGS associations with
clinical features resulted only in nominal associations that did not
survive correction for multiple testing, we might (cautiously) draw
a few interesting observations and new hypotheses for further
exploration. For example, that activation of macrophages and
neutrophils, reﬂected by the potential
links with the PGSs for
cytokines and chemokines produced by or targeting these cells
(e.g., interleukin-6/8, CXCL6/16), might contribute to disease AAO
in ConLi+Gen. These observations might be supported by studies
that found increases in neutrophil counts in psychiatric disorders,
including BP [42, 43], as well as association of genetic
polymorphisms in interleukin-1β, a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
produced by activated immune cells, including neutrophils and
macrophages, with age of onset of depression in geriatric patients
[44].
that macrophage/neutrophil
activation was also a suggested mechanism of Li response in our
study, it would be easy to speculate that activation of these cells
might be linked with some aspect of the disease onset.

In conclusion, we performed an exploratory study that suggests
a modest relationship between immunity and clinically relevant
the genetic level and identiﬁed various
BP phenotypes at
interesting potential candidates
follow-up studies. We
acknowledge that our study was limited by a relatively small
sample size, particularly for the episodes of hypomania, and by
incomplete overlap between the variants in the PGSs and our
ConLi+Gen dataset, likely resulting from a limited overlap among
the different SNP arrays initially used to genotype samples in
different collection centers. Moreover, although regulatory regions
were out of the scope of our study due to their high complexity
for interpretation, we acknowledge that restricting our analyses to
the gene’s boundaries excluded potentially interesting regulatory
SNPs involved in Li response and BP characteristics. Finally, aware
that the inclusion of East Asian subsamples in our genetic analyses
might rise some concerns, we performed a sensitivity analysis by
excluding East Asian individuals from the genetic association tests
of primary Li response phenotypes (data not shown). The QCed
meta-analysis results of both dichotomous (Pearson r = 0.975) and
continuous (Pearson r = 0.941) Li response variables performed
with and without East Asian samples were highly correlated.
Because we expected mild differences between analyses due to
the loss in sample size, these results suggested that any potential
bias that could be attributed to the different ancestries was
addressed in our analyses. Despite the inherent limitations and
the modest signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings, we believe that our study
provides plausible biological

understanding of immune contributions to BP. Further studies
are needed to elucidate if and how immune regulation might
represent a feasible strategy to improve the symptomatology and
