Abstract
In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), social communication and stereotypical behaviour patterns affect all areas of life, and 
can result in a decrease of its quality. Previous research has shown promising results for the social skills of groups of chil-
dren with ASD. Furthermore, a pilot study of the Tübingen Group Training for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TüTASS) has 
demonstrated that mindfulness-based elements achieve additional positive effects. To build on these findings, the TüTASS 
training was adapted and expanded. Indeed, the TüTASS currently includes 20 90-min appointments starting with the basic 
skills of emotions, body, and communication, which are then transferred to personal, family, peer, and school spheres. The 
appointments have a fixed, consistent structure and each includes a body awareness exercise. In this study, we evaluated the 
TÜTASS with 27 children with ASD. The results showed improvements in pre-post comparison in behaviours associated 
with autism, as well as in externalising and internalising behaviours as assessed by parent reports, participant self-reports, 
and independent raters in participating children. Furthermore, the perceived parent burden in relation to their children 
decreased, whereas the participants’ self-rated quality of life increased. Overall, both the participants and their parents rated 
the TüTASS very positively in rating sheets and in free feedback. If replicated in larger controlled trials, TÜTASS training 
might be a useful treatment tool for groups of children with ASD.

Introduction

The clinical relevance of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
has grown considerably in recent years, partly due to its 
ever-increasing  prevalence  in  children  and  youth  [1–3]. 
Persistent patterns of fundamental deficits in social inter-
action and understanding are typical [4–6]. Moreover, as 
stereotypies in behaviour and interests occur, the need for 
structured daily and life routines becomes greater. These

special characteristics cause serious difficulties, especially 
in such social settings as schools, peer groups, or family.

The search for etiologic factors of ASD is wide-ranging. 
Solid evidence for a single etiological theory, or even a spe-
cific number of causes, is not yet available [5]. The etiologi-
cal models in the literature are based on neurobiology and 
genetic principles, as well as demographic risk factors, early 
environmental influences, and neuropsychological theories 
[4–6]. The deficit in the Theory of Mind (ToM) is currently 
considered to be the most studied construct in the field of 
autism in neuropsychological research [7]. In particular, 
these findings are hugely important to the development of a 
therapeutic approach because other types of treatment (e.g., 
medication) have not yet been identified. Neuropsychologi-
cal theories have sought to explain the reduced reception 
of emotions in facial expressions and body language, as 
this information often cannot be processed further, as well 
as lower levels of empathy in persons with ASD [8, 9]. In 
addition to the perception of other people’s feelings, the

processing and regulation of one’s own emotions are often 
faulty [7, 10]. Thus, alexithymia is also much more com-
mon in those on the spectrum than in people without ASD 
[11]. A part of the described autistic symptoms can in all 
likelihood be attributed to sensory and motor characteristics 
[12–15]. The sensory characteristics tend to be present in 
approximately 80–90% of people with autism in the form 
of  hypo-  or  hyper-reactivity  to  stimuli  of  any  modality, 
including interoceptive stimuli. The abnormalities in motor 
development (e.g., lack of coordination, problems in pencil 
use)—and especially those that include top-down processes, 
such as cognitive control and executive functions—are often 
associated with autistic traits but have yet to be included in 
the diagnosis [4, 14–16].

The majority of current group interventions for ASD 
focus on socioemotional skills. Other well-established train-
ings (e.g. TOMTASS [17], SOSTA-FRA [18] or KOMSSI 
[19] focus on social interactional skills, but do not follow a 
mindfulness-based approach. However, regarding etiologi-
cal factors, it seems beneficial to include mindfulness-based 
treatment elements as they have the potential to improve 
hyper- and hypo-reactivity. Indeed, not only have mindful-
ness-based interventions been successfully used in other dis-
order groups (chronic pain, anxiety, eating disorders, stress, 
etc.) for quite some time [20–27], initial studies in the field 
of autism have also demonstrated a positive effect of these 
therapeutic interventions. For example, Ridderinkhof et al. 
[28] found that mindfulness training can support adolescents 
on the spectrum in the regulation of their communication, 
emotions, and behaviour, and Gawronski et al. [29] include 
mindfulness-based exercises in every session of their train-
ing with autistic adults (GATE). There is also evidence to 
suggest that mindfulness facilitates the learning of empathy 
and can also increase overall well-being [30, 31], especially 
when participants form a homogeneous group in terms of 
their autistic expressions [32]. Based on these findings, we 
integrated the mindfulness exercises into TüTASS as part 
of a group therapy. Through the application in the group, 
the participants got the opportunity to apply and learn the 
exercises directly in the social setting, to then deepen them 
at home in the context of homework in an individual set-
ting and to integrate them into everyday life. In addition to 
these factors, resource reasons also played a role in why the 
mindfulness exercises were not conducted in the individual 
setting.

Thus, while growing academic and societal interest in 
ASD has led to increased implementation of intervention 
projects in recent years, there is still a need to research more 
treatment strategies that additionally focus on body aware-
ness in children.

On this basis, we developed the Tübinger Training für 
Autismus-Spektrum-Störungen (TüTASS) a few years ago 
and since 2014 evaluated it in an initial pilot study [33]. 

In the present study, we seek to combine insights from our 
previous training with further exercises on social skills in 
ASD with a strong influence of body perception content. 
We designed the TüTASS to help children and adoles-
cents with an ASD cope better in their everyday lives. 
This can be achieved by improving social interaction and 
decreasing behavioural problems through the practice of 
mindful awareness of the body, environment, and feel-
ings. These exercises are used to ameliorate the core prob-
lems of autistic children and adolescents. Through body 
awareness exercises, and on the basis of the multi-layered 
examination of feelings and mindful perception, the prac-
titioners learn core competencies that can hugely support 
many areas of life. During the pilot study, we repeatedly 
reviewed the everyday needs of the participants and their 
parents, and included additional elements to the training. 
The revised training contains expanded and new compo-
nents that are intended to provide support for the families 
of those involved. First, the important core skill of com-
munication has become more comprehensive. Building 
on these basic skills, specific everyday problem areas of 
children and adolescents with ASD are addressed. In the 
process, the knowledge and skills already acquired in the 
areas of emotions, body, and communication are trans-
ferred to the central areas of life: self, family, friends, and 
school. The training also provides room for addressing the 
individual problems of the children and adolescents. We 
designed small exercises to help participants transfer the 
training content they have learned to their everyday lives. 
Based on the positive feedback and data, the elements of 
the pilot study were largely retained in the revision and 
expansion of the training, and supplemented with clas-
sic social skills elements in which everyday problems of 
the families are dealt with. In this second pilot study, we 
evaluated the revised and expanded training using pre–post 
surveys.

The findings from this study show improvements to emo-
tional and behavioural problems, and that the training was 
very well received by both participants and parents alike. 
Therefore, we used the evaluation results to further improve 
the training and its effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptance 
by the parents and participants of the TüTASS programme. 
This has resulted primarily in changes to the context. More 
attention was paid to the everyday problems emphasised by 
participants and trainers during the evaluation. We assume 
that the further developed training reduces difficulties in 
daily life challenges caused by autistic symptomatology. To 
make possible changes visible, we again collected various 
data through self-reports and informant reporting. Addition-
ally, data from the IDS-II scales, which were used to test 
participants by independent raters before and after the train-
ing, helped increase the objectivity of the results.

We expected an improvement to the core autistic symp-
toms, as well as to the external and internal behaviours, 
which was evaluated through external assessments by the 
parents and the self-reports of the participants. Moreover, 
we expected to see improvements in the objective assess-
ment using IDS-II.

Methods

Participants

The participants were recruited via in-house recommenda-
tions. Additionally, many participants contacted us by e-mail 
because they had been recommended our training from vari-
ous external sources. To participate in the study, they had to 
meet the following inclusion criteria: Aged between 7 and 
14 years and have a primary diagnosis of ASD. Moreover, 
they had to have an IQ above 70 and the ability to partici-
pate in at least 70% of the training sessions, corresponding 
to 14 sessions. Measurements using the CBCL prior to the 
start of training suggest that 81% of participants showed 
internalizing (depressed, anxious, somatic and social prob-
lems, attention problems) and externalizing (aggressiveness 
and rule-breaking behavior) tendencies. When asked about 
medical conditions, 48.15% of participants indicated that 
they currently had medical conditions or developmental 
disabilities. A total of 30 patients participated in 5 groups 
(each comprised of 6 children and 2 therapists). One patient 
participated in less than 14 sessions due to family difficul-
ties, one patient had an IQ below 70, and one patient showed 
other priority comorbidities. These patients were able to par-
ticipate in the training but were not included in the statisti-
cal analyses. In addition, participants were not allowed to 
participate in other therapies outside of TüTASS.

The  group  programme  was  evaluated  with  27  par-
ticipants (23 male, 4 female, age 11.06 years, SD = 2.24 
median = 10.00, variance = 5.25, age range 7–14 years). All 
of the participants were pre-diagnosed with an ASD. 21 of 
the participants were diagnosed with the Autism Diagnos-
tic Observation Schedule (ADOS) tool, while the remain-
ing 6 were diagnosed by a pre-treatment specialist. For 5 
of these children, the scores we obtained using the Social 
Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Marburg Rating Scale 
for Asperger’s Syndrome (MBAS) were above the cut-off of 
the high range. For one participant, the parent's score was 
in the moderate range on both the MBAS and the SRS, so 
that the cut-off score for the diagnosis was not exceeded, 
but the diagnosis was confirmed in the clinical expert judge-
ment. The mean IQ of the participants was 105.76 in n = 21 
(CFT 20-R = 7, WISC-IV = 6, HAWIK-IV = 5, CFT 1-R = 2, 
CPM = 1). Four children took methylphenidate during train-
ing, one child was given amphetamine sulphate, one child 

was given Elvanse, and another took Aripiprazol and Pim-
pamperon. 12 of the participants attended a primary school, 
1 a lower secondary school, 4 a secondary or comprehensive 
school, 9 a high school, and 1 participant attended a Waldorf 
school.

We obtained written informed consent from all of the par-
ticipants and their legal guardians; participation in the study 
was voluntary, and data were processed pseudonymously. 
The study was approved by the local ethics committee of 
the Eberhard Karls University and the University Hospital 
Tübingen, and conducted in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki.

Intervention

We designed the TüTASS programme as an ambulant struc-
tured group training for children and adolescents with ASD. 
In groups of 6 children and 2 group leaders, the programme 
was held every two weeks (except during school holidays) 
in a total of 20 sessions (each lasting 90 min). This design 
allowed us to therapeutically accompany the participants 
over a whole year. There was a space of approximately one 
year between each child’s pre-test (before treatment) and 
post-test (after treatment). The sessions were structured 
and conducted using standardised material (a manual of 
the TüTASS is in progress). The programme’s goal is to 
help children with ASD develop a more mindful awareness 
and understanding of their body and emotions, as well as 
to improve their social understanding and interaction. Such 
improvements are intended to help participants (and their 
families) better cope with everyday life. The TüTASS also 
follows a systemic approach, according to which not only 
are participants considered as individuals, but so too are 
their parents. All legal guardians were offered one parent-
therapist meeting before and one after the training, as well as 
a parenting programme of four sessions during the training. 
Furthermore, the parents could contact the group leader with 
urgent questions. In combination with special homework 
assignments (one exercise per session on the lesson topic 
and one body perception exercise), a connection between 
TüTASS and the everyday life of the participants should be 
established.

The entire training programme consisted of 10 parts (1–3 
sessions each; see below). Each session included one mind-
fulness exercise. The sessions all shared the same sequence 
of events: In the welcome ritual, the children and therapists 
used a cube on which different feelings were illustrated in 
order for them to share their current emotional state. Once 
done, the group then dealt with the exercises which had been 
prepared as homework. This was followed by the introduc-
tion of a new topic in each session (as described below). A 
closing ritual, which included mutual feedback and a game, 
concluded the session. To file the worksheets and homework, 

1 31602

participants were each given a folder. The overall TüTASS 
programme was as follows.

Part 1: introduction (session 1)

The first session gives the participants an easy and relaxed 
start, since getting used to new structures and people is often 
demanding for those with autism [34]. In addition, the pro-
cesses and contents of the training are explained to the par-
ticipants. A group name and a greeting ritual are discussed 
together. The first body awareness exercise that we practiced 
with the children is called ‘chocolate meditation’, in which 
the children are taught to eat food mindfully. This offers an 
easy, everyday, and enjoyable introduction to mindfulness 
exercises.

Part 2: emotions (sessions 2–4)

Difficulties in emotion regulation and resulting dysfunc-
tional behaviour are frequently observed in patients with 
ASD [1, 35, 36]. Therefore, these sessions served to better 
perceive and recognise emotions, as well as to learn strate-
gies for coping with emotions. To practice these skills, we 
worked on both theoretical and practical levels (e.g., panto-
mime, role-playing), facial expressions and gestures of emo-
tions, as well as the connection between certain situations 
and feelings. Moreover, we addressed dealing with strong 
emotions—especially  anger—which  poses  special  chal-
lenges for children and young people with autism [37]. The 
second body awareness exercise involves a story with pro-
gressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises. This relaxation 
method helps reduce anxiety in children and adolescents, 
and can help with sleeping problems. Furthermore, it leads 
to a reduction of stress and increased concentration levels.

Part 3: body (sessions 5–7)

People with autism can exhibit sensory sensitivities. As 
mentioned earlier, it has been estimated that these occur in 
80–90% of autistic people in the form of hypo- or hyper-
reactivity to stimuli of any modality. Accordingly, the next 
part of the training concerns the ‘body’ area [4, 14–16]. 
First, the participants were asked to focus on their sensory 
perceptions. A subsequent station run was about experienc-
ing and trying out the individual senses. To improve the 
recognition of their own physical comfort zone, we con-
ducted a physical closeness-distance exercise and reflected 
upon it afterwards. To be more attuned to one’s own body, 
it is important to know exactly where certain feelings can 
be perceived. With the help of two yoga exercises, we dis-
cussed when and where one feels strong or weak. We then 
dealt with facial expressions and posture in relation to emo-
tions in different exercises. Furthermore, we addressed what 

tension and relaxation are, and discussed how the former can 
be reduced and the latter enhances through trained physical 
exercises. To feel mental, in addition to physical, tension, 
we organised a small ‘competition’ between the groups and 
discussed afterwards. The accompanying body awareness 
exercises that we performed with the children were the yoga 
exercises ‘Sun Salutation with Babar’ and ‘Pizza Massage’. 
The first of these helps reduce stress and increase rest and 
relaxation, while the second is intended to provide body 
awareness, perception, and mutual trust with physical touch.

Part 4: communication (sessions 8–10)

For many people on the spectrum, only the pure content of 
verbal language is what constitutes communication—social 
or emotional signals are not perceived correctly or only 
with a delay [38]. Therefore, we first focused on non-verbal 
communication through the influence of body language with 
facial expressions and gestures on what is said. Different 
meanings of gestures were learned in a playful way and other 
communicative aspects (e.g., tone of voice) were included. 
This was followed by exercises in verbal communication: 
Due to their deficits in the ToM people with autism find it 
difficult to correctly identify the interests and goals of the 
other person and modulate their own speech accordingly 
[39]. Therefore, we emphasised tracing different parts of 
speech and practicing asking questions, recognising com-
munication errors in the role play of the group leaders, and 
guiding the team partner confidently in an obstacle course. 
In terms of everyday communication, the topic of ‘small 
talk’ was discussed in detail with impulse questions and con-
tacting another person was practiced on the clinic premises. 
Finally, we talked with the children and adolescents about 
the advantages and disadvantages of media communication 
and the use of emojis. As a further body awareness exercise, 
we conducted the ‘noise meditation’ exercise, which was 
intended to prevent automatic noise interpretation, which in 
turn reduced subjective overload due to constant environ-
mental noise. We also intended this exercise to aid focus and 
concentration in everyday situations.

Part 5: myself (sessions 11–12)

These sessions were intended to encourage the participants 
to integrate autism into their identity in the conflict between 
‘normal’ life and the diagnosis. The participants had often 
been confronted with stigmatisation [40], and should thus 
be enabled to educate others about autism to counteract the 
prejudices they are routinely confronted with. The introduc-
tion was about sensing one’s own limits (what is perceived 
as (un)pleasant?). This was followed by psychoeducation on 
the topic of the autism spectrum. To strengthen their self-
esteem, the children and adolescents were asked to reflect 

1 3 
European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience (2023) 273:1599–1613 

1603

on their own abilities and the strengths they perceived in 
themselves in different areas of life. Since many children 
with an ASD find it difficult to be flexible in everyday life 
[41, 42], we felt it important to deal with these issues. As 
such, we incorporated individual exercises into the lesson 
(i.e., changing the usual routine, changing seats). Together 
with the participants, we structured a daily schedule and 
discussed how to deal with flexibility in everyday life. The 
feelings experienced in the process were included. We con-
ducted the ‘Bodyscan’ mindfulness exercise, which was 
designed to help people relax in stressful, painful, or wor-
risome situations.

Part 6: family (sessions 13–14)

Children and adolescents with autism pose special chal-
lenges to parents in their upbringing as well as to the entire 
family system [37]. These parents tend to have higher stress 
profiles [43–45]. Against this backdrop, we conducted the 
‘family scale’ exercise in the group, which focused on both 
the advantages and disadvantages of family. Moreover, the 
issue of sibling rivalry was addressed by considering the 
pros and cons of belonging to different sibling positions 
(e.g., ‘Who gets the most attention?’). Subsequently, the 
topic of family was linked to the feelings that occur and 
boundaries were discussed. Various situations were exam-
ined and practiced in role plays. Since media use or con-
sumption can lead to conflicts at both the parent–child [46] 
and sibling levels [47], we discussed the topic of media 
through open discussions, conveying factual knowledge, and 
role plays. The focus was on the children reflecting on their 
own media behaviour and developing a sense of appropriate 
media use. We used the ‘walking mediation’ mindfulness 
exercise here, which can help focus attention on the sensa-
tions of the body so that external stimuli are perceived as 
less disturbing.

Part 7: friends (sessions 15–16)

Autism-specific abnormalities in social skills, as well as 
problem behaviours, seem to hinder building and main-
taining deeper, reciprocal friendships [48–52]. First, an 
appropriate  concept  of  friendship  should  be  strength-
ened—especially regarding its positive aspects. Based on 
this, the participants together worked to identify how to 
recognise ‘real’ and ‘false’ friends by referring back to 
certain situations and role plays. To strengthen the partici-
pants’ commonalities, a network of connections was cre-
ated between the children (visualisation of commonalities 
by picking up threads). To illustrate the importance of trust 
in relationships, as well as to make this concept tangible 
for the participants, a group exercise was also conducted. 
Then, depending on the group, the topics of friendship, 

love, and sexuality were addressed in an age-appropriate 
manner. As a mindfulness exercise, ‘belly breathing’ was 
performed. This exercise can help one stay in the here and 
now, minimise rumination, and reduce inner restlessness 
and anxiety.

Part 8: school (sessions 17–18)

Individuals with ASD require increased support in every-
day school life (e.g., with organisation and planning). They 
find it difficult to concentrate in the often noisy and chaotic 
school environment. Moreover, peer interactions (e.g., in 
group work or during school breaks) can pose certain chal-
lenges. Furthermore, they can have experience significant 
problems with changes in action sequences (which charac-
terises everyday school life). Therefore, we also focused on 
the daily school routine [41, 42].

As an introduction, strategies for dealing with school 
problems (e.g., a lack of concentration due to high noise 
levels in the classroom) were developed. In addition, we 
focused on the topic of bullying: What is bullying? Why 
is bullying taking place? The participants then discussed 
helpful strategies for ensuring that their own boundaries are 
respected by others.

Children and adolescents with ASD often report finding 
it difficult to give presentations [53]. Accordingly, it was 
important to practice this in a protected setting: The partici-
pants were allowed to give a short presentation on a topic 
of their choice. Feedback was given and helpful strategies 
against nervousness were elaborated upon. Regarding the 
question ‘Why am I learning?’, the participants were taught 
that they were not learning for their teachers or parents, but 
for themselves and their own future, and that current effort 
can pay off later. The mindfulness exercise ‘The safe place’ 
was performed. This guided imagery exercise can contrib-
ute to a reduction of fear, as well as to an increased sense 
of security in unpleasant situations or with overwhelming 
feelings.

Part 9: repeat game (session 19)

We used this session to repeat and deepen all of the top-
ics covered. We opted for a self-designed game in which 
the participants were divided into two groups and competed 
against each other in practical tasks. The participants could 
vote on which mindfulness exercise they wanted to repeat. 
To practice giving positive feedback and strengthening self-
esteem, we tasked the participants with writing down posi-
tive qualities about each group member. These compliments 
were shared with the participants by the group leaders in the 
follow-up session.

1 31604

Part 10: completion (session 20)

As a final lesson, the participants walked through a ‘barefoot 
park’ in teams of two. Elements of the training (including 
‘mindful togetherness’, ‘perceiving and feeling one's own 
body’, ‘clear communication’, and ‘expression of percep-
tion’) were followed and absorbed. A practical exercise to 
strengthen  the  group  (“circle  of  community”)  followed. 
Finally, the participants received a certificate in recognition 
of their commitment to, and participation in, the training. 
The participants were allowed to choose the final mindful-
ness exercise.

Instruments

We used standardised questionnaires to collect psychometric 
data from the participants and their guardians both before 
and after the training. These questionnaires collected data on 
core autistic characteristics, as well as the strengths, weak-
nesses, and current developmental status of the participants. 
Moreover, a subjective assessment of parental stress and 
well-being was collected from the guardians and partici-
pants. We also used objective methods to assess social-emo-
tional competencies. For instance, we used the SRS [54] to 
assess changes in autistic core characteristics, and the MBAS 
[55] for an external assessment of core symptoms. The Child 
Behaviour Checklist (CBCL; [56]) and the Strength and Dif-
ficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; [57]) were used to assess the 
patients' competences and problems. The Inventory for the 
Assessment of the Quality of Life in Children and Adoles-
cents (ILK; [58]) and the Questionnaire for Measuring the 
Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents 
(KINDL; [59]) were used to assess the patients’ and par-
ents’ quality of life. Furthermore, we assessed parental stress 
through the Parenting Stress Index (EBI; [60]), and used 
the Experiencing Emotions Scales (SEE; [61]) to examine 
patients’ emotion management and emotional intelligence. 
For an additional, more objective assessment, children and 
adolescents were assessed for social skills using the Social-
Emotional Competence task domain of the Intelligence and 
Development Scales for Children and Adolescents (IDS-II; 
[62]). The testing using IDS-II was conducted by people 
who were not involved in the training. The SRS and IDS-
II were defined as primary outcomes, while the remaining 
questionnaires used were secondary outcomes.

Furthermore,  the  feasibility  and  quality  of  the  group 
training were evaluated by both the patients and their par-
ents. These were recorded after the completion of the train-
ing using special self-constructed questionnaires for the 
TüTASS. The data collected served as feedback and a basis 
for the training’s further development. Since these ques-
tionnaires were collected in a data-anonymised manner, the 
feedback could not be assigned to individual participants 

(including those excluded). All feedback forms were, there-
fore, included in the evaluation.

Statistical analyses

SPSS for Windows, version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics 21; 
IBM Corporation) was used for statistical analysis. To check 
the data sets for normal distribution, we examined them with 
a Shapiro–Wilk test before further processing. If the data 
were normally distributed, we used paired t-tests to examine 
the change between the T0 and T1 data collection times, 
and Wilcoxon tests if they were not. The value of 0.05 was 
selected as the significance level.

Since no standardisation is as yet possible for the IDS-
II, and the test evaluation for the subtests was conducted 
according to age groups with different scales, the relatively 
achieved  score  was  calculated  in  percent  for  each  child 
(achieved score in the subtest/maximum achievable score 
in this age group). This allowed us to compare the test results 
between the age groups.

Results

Psychometric assessment

Table 1 shows the results for the (sub)scales of the ques-
tionnaires before and after the completion of the training, 
together with the statistical data. The SRS scores for social 
motivation and social communication improved, while 
there were no significant changes to the scores for social 
awareness, social cognition, restricted interests, and repeti-
tive behaviour. The CBCL variables improved in the scale 
of external problems, as well as in both the rule-breaking 
behaviour and aggressive behaviour subscales. The scale 
of internal problems, and the withdrawn/depressed and 
thought problems subscales in particular, became posi-
tive, while the social problems and attention problems 
subscales showed a positive trend. In contrast, somatic 
complaints and anxious/depressed remained the same. The 
SDQ showed a decrease in peer problems and a positive 
trend in conduct problems. The data of emotional symp-
toms, hyperactivity, and prosocial behaviour remained 
stable. The ILK showed a positive trend in the children’s 
data for both the quality of life and the problem score, 
whereas the parents’ assessments remained unaltered in 
these areas. The data collection using the KINDL showed 
no change in the various areas. The self-disclosure scales 
for experiencing emotions measured by the SEE were rated 
more positively in the experience of emotional overload, 
body-related symbolisation of emotion, and experience of 
self-control. However, there was no change to the accept-
ance  of  own  emotions,  experiencing  lacks  of  emotion,

imaginative symbolisation of emotions, and experience 
of emotion regulation. The parenting stress index (EBI) 
showed decreases to children’s stress, but no reductions in 
parental stress. The Marburg Rating Scale for Asperger’s 
Syndrome (MBAS) improved in the ToM and in stereotyp-
ical and inappropriate behaviour. The scale for conspicu-
ous speech style, special interests, and motor skills showed 
a positive trend, whereas the scale for shared attention

The Intelligence and Development Scales of the IDS-II 
for recognising emotions showed a positive trend, and the 
participants improved significantly (24%) in regulating 
emotions and social competences (15%).

The children rated the sessions focusing on body per-
ception and everyday communication as particularly useful, 
whereas the parents rated the sessions on the identification 
of emotions, body relaxation and family as especially impor-
tant. Both children and parents appreciated the session for 
flexibility and school in particular. Generally speaking, no 
session was rated negatively by the parents or participants. 
The participation rate of the children in the individual dates 
was high.

Children reports

There was also a free writing part allowing for more individ-
ual feedback. When asked whether anything had changed or 
been learnt during the training, the children answered that, 
from their perspective, they could better communicate and 
deal with their classmates. They had a deeper understand-
ing for other people, and it was easier for them to maintain 
friendships. They also got along better with their families 
and in everyday life. The participants reported that they had 
learned to more accurately understand and deal with their 
feelings, that they no longer “freak out” so quickly, that they 
cry less, and that they are more able to calm themselves in 
stressful situations by means of body awareness and mind-
fulness exercises. Moreover, new approaches to problems, 
and turning to adults more often when they arise, were men-
tioned, as well as the topics of love and media consumption 
in general. When asked what they particularly liked, the 
children answered that they formed friendships with other 
people with ASD and that they liked the creative activities 
in the training. Additionally, the structure and procedure 
of the training, as well as the content and body awareness 
exercises, were spoken of positively. The practical applica-
tion of the content was also emphasised. The participants 
did not like the worksheets and associated writing in the 
training, and particularly disliked the disruptive behaviour 
of other participants. Some children said that the location of 
the training was too far from their homes, or that its length 
meant they could not pursue other hobbies during that time.

Parental reports

Some parents reported that their children were more able to 
cope with their diagnosis and had learned to accept their own 
strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, they indicated that 
their children had been taught to more effectively deal with 
their deficits, understand that they were not alone with these 
problems, and recognise their own great positive potential. 
They further mentioned that the children became more self-
confident, more able to assess feelings in themselves and 
others, and could better express feelings and sensations. Par-
ents evaluated their children as more reflective and friend-
lier, and that tantrums became less frequent. Parents rated 

the awareness exercises as being of special importance in 
this respect and some parents indicated both that they found 
the mindfulness exercises helpful for their children and that 
their children were able to apply them in everyday situa-
tions. Indeed, from the parents’ perspective, their children 
could communicate and express themselves with greater 
efficacy, and were more responsive to the family. For their 
part, the parents found it easier to understand their children, 
deal with their issues, and improve their teamwork skills. 
The parents learned that the manifestations of ASD are 
highly diverse. They indicated that their understanding and 
acceptance for the peculiarities, fears, and reactions of their 
children had deepened, and that they had learned to take 
their children more seriously and accept them as they are. 
Parents found a greater appreciation of their children’s posi-
tive qualities, and that they had become more relaxed and 
patient. They also found it very helpful to learn that other 
parents have similar problems and to exchange ideas with 
them. The parents wanted to take up the suggestions from 
the parent training for everyday life and deepen individual 
topics. They also learned of the importance of taking time 
to relax and unwind, as well as of being confident (and less 
pressured) in their methods. The parents were pleased to be 
included in some parts of the training. They reported that it 
was sometimes difficult to do additional homework on top 
of schoolwork. In terms of content, they missed the topics 
of anxiety and shopping. Furthermore, the parents would 
also have liked to have had more appointments for parents 
and siblings.

Final feedback of children and parents

At the end of the questionnaire, the children and parents had 
the option to give open feedback. Many thanked us for the 
training and hoped for further opportunities to participate in 
an extended TüTASS programme.

Discussion

The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  revised  and 
expanded  TüTASS  training.  In  particular,  we  sought  to 
examine its feasibility, usability, and acceptability from the 
perspective of participating children with ASD and their 
parents. This training improved symptoms and was very 
positively evaluated, and appreciated, by the patients and 
parents. A very low dropout rate of n = 1 in 30 participants 
indicates the good acceptance of this structured treatment 
programme.  The  subsequent  participation  of  many  par-
ticipants in further sessions as part of TüTASS Extended 
reflects the subjectively perceived impact and high accept-
ance  of  the  training  among  parents  and  children.  Both 
reported positive improvements in everyday life. Only the 

1 31608

homework was rated negatively by the participating children 
and parents due to the additional time required. Compared 
to previously established interventions in the field of ASD 
treatment, our study shows similar treatment effects. How-
ever, due to our novel approach to the field of ASD (i.e., 
the implementation of body awareness exercises), TüTASS 
can join the ranks of other major interventions, such as 
TOMTASS [17] or SOSTA-FRA [18].

Children and adolescents with autism show abnormali-
ties—especially in social interaction, communication, and 
stereotypical behaviours—which often lead to difficulties 
in  everyday  situations.  In  terms  of  the  diagnostic  ques-
tionnaires, we found various positive tendencies. The two 
questionnaires, SRS and MBAS (which refer specifically to 
autistic traits), showed improvements in several core areas 
of autism. Indeed, the SRS [54] showed an improvement 
in  social  communication.  Three  training  sessions  dealt 
with the topic in different ways in relation to non-verbal, 
verbal, and everyday communication, with many practical 
exercises (see Part 4: Communication [sessions 8–10)]. The 
children found the appointment for everyday communica-
tion particularly helpful. The scale on restricted interests and 
repetitive behaviour showed no change. In the TüTASS, we 
rarely noticed the preoccupation with special interests and 
repetitive behaviours of participants, leading us not to treat 
these as problematic behaviours. In the TüTASS, special 
interests are validated and taught to be used as resources. In 
the MBAS, scales with similar foci showed improvements 
regarding stereotypical and inappropriate behaviour. In addi-
tion, the MBAS reported improvements in the Theory of 
Mind (ToM), which we attribute to the topics of the percep-
tion of emotion and friendship, as well as the exercises on 
bullying and the exploitative behaviour of others. The topic 
of family in relation to dealing with conflicts and the pros 
and cons of sibling positions could also strengthen abili-
ties in the ToM. The lessons on communication concerned 
paying attention to the other person when choosing topics 
for conversation and creating balanced parts of speech. We 
found a positive trend for the scales regarding conspicuous 
speech style, special interests, and motor skills. The values 
for the scale for divided attention and joy, facial expres-
sions, and gestures remained stable. However, since 7 out 
of 13 items of this scale referred to the age of 4–5 years, no 
measurable change was expected. We found a significant 
increase to social motivation. Again, we hypothesise that 
participants' positive experiences in the group—compared 
to many negative experiences in, for example, school—
make them more eager to interact, and a higher sense of 
competence also increases social motivation. This effect 
could also be found in a group-based training in adults with 
autism [63]. Here in particular, as in other intervention pro-
grammes (e.g., SOSTA-FRA [18] and TOMTASS [17]), the 
clear advantages of a group over individual intervention are 

evident. The children are given the opportunity to experi-
ence the advantages of friendships and teams for themselves 
in a guided, well-meaning setting. While parent-reported 
scores for social awareness and social cognition did not 
change significantly, the self-report scales of the children 
for experiencing emotions (as measured by the SEE) showed 
improvements for experiencing emotional overload, body-
related symbolisation of emotions, and self-control. In par-
ticular, experiencing self-control is an important goal in the 
TüTASS, which is achieved by practicing behaviour and 
focusing on the strengths of the individual participants. At 
the TüTASS, the children are able to try and test different 
methods in a safe environment, which the participants have 
responded to very positively.

For the participants, the acceptance of their own emo-
tions, the experience of emotionlessness, the imaginative 
symbolisation of emotions, and the experience of emotion 
regulation (as determined by the SEE), seems unchanged. 
The parents reported that many of the children had difficul-
ties with the items in the questionnaire. We found this unsur-
prising since the questionnaire is recommended for subjects 
aged 14 and older. Due to the lack of alternatives, we also 
used the questionnaire for a significantly younger target 
group  which  made  interpretation  more  difficult.  We  are 
therefore glad to have used the questionnaire with the open 
feedback, wherein both the children and parents reported a 
highly positive development in terms of emotional accept-
ance and dealing with feelings. The objective procedure 
using IDS-II also showed a significant improvement to emo-
tion regulation of 24%. We assume that, in this respect, the 
effectiveness stems from a combination of body awareness 
exercises with the concrete confrontation of emotions, both 
of which are fundamental features of the TüTASS.

As in our first pilot study [33], we noted an improvement 
in the externalising scales of the CBCL on rule-breaking 
and aggressive behaviour. We attribute this positive develop-
ment to the appointments related to emotions and our focus 
on dealing with anger. Using various exercises (particularly 
role-playing), the participants learned a playful method of 
recognising and expressing emotions, and how to influence 
their own emotions when dealing with others. This could be 
also attributed to the fact that the TüTASS does not only pro-
vide information, but practises alternative behaviour. Fur-
thermore, our body perception exercises, and in particular 
the methods for tension and relaxation (including body scan, 
PMR, and others), could be helpful for emotion regulation 
and thus positively influence frustration tolerance. Due to 
the strengthening of self-confidence, the participants also 
found ways to appropriately express their emotions. Con-
spicuous internalising behaviours also decreased according 
to our data collection. As with the first training, we found 
improvements in the CBCL in internalising behaviour for 
the thinking problems scale. This could be attributed to the 

1 3 
European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience (2023) 273:1599–1613 

1609

mindfulness exercises, which help the children relax and 
feel less stressed. However, it should also be mentioned here 
that not all children and adolescents benefit equally from the 
mindfulness-based exercises. It is also possible that the strik-
ing behaviours used to calm oneself may have been replaced 
with new methods. We were pleased to note an improvement 
on the withdrawn/depressed subscale. One reason for this 
improvement could be that friendships were formed during 
training, and the children met before or after the sessions to 
spend time together. They clearly had positive interaction 
experiences and seemed more open to making new con-
tacts. It is also possible that the participants showed fewer 
tendencies to withdraw due to reduced family conflicts. 
Furthermore, we saw no change in the scales for somatic 
complaints. This was expected as medical complaints were 
not treated and the body awareness exercises seemed insuf-
ficient for improving the stated symptoms. Likewise, the 
CBCL scores on anxious/depressed and the SDQ data on 
emotional symptoms remained stable, with improvements 
in the SDQ being shown in the first cohort. Accordingly, 
it seems reasonable to more deeply deal with the topic of 
fear in addition to the emotion of anger. For this purpose, 
weekly (and thus more comprehensive) support over a year 
would certainly be helpful. The SDQ showed a decrease 
in externalising problems, especially in dealing with peers. 
Participation in a consistent group that shares similar experi-
ences and challenges in everyday life, is subject to reliable 
rules and a fixed structure, and promotes mutual respect, 
joint development of solutions to problems, and purpose-
ful interactions with each other may be significant here. In 
addition, we found a positive trend in behavioural issues in 
the SDQ by exploring items targeting anger, argument, and 
cooperative behaviour. The hyperactivity data remained sta-
ble compared to the first cohort, while the CBCL showed a 
slight improvement of attention problems. Surprisingly, the 
body awareness exercises seemed to have little effect in this 
regard, although the parents reported that the children had 
problems engaging in the exercises regularly at home. On 
the other hand, we received much positive feedback regard-
ing hyperactivity. Moreover, the prosocial behaviour did not 
change according to the parent’s pre and post evaluation by 
the CBCL. We found positive trends for the social problem’s 
scales in the CBCL, and the objective procedure using IDS-
II showed an improvement of 15% in the socially competent 
behaviour scale among the participants, despite the fact that 
the IDS-II’s topics were deliberately not dealt with in the 
training. There may be a discrepancy between the acquired 
ideas for action and their implementation in everyday life. 
As such, we recommend that future groups focus even more 
on prosocial behaviour.

While the children’s self-reported quality of life measured 
by the ILK showed a slightly positive trend, both for quality 
of life and for the problem score, the parents’ assessment 

showed no improvement in these areas. A possible explana-
tion for this difference could be that the parents cannot per-
ceive the positive internal changes of their children accord-
ingly, or that the external effect is perhaps more difficult 
due to reduced facial expressions and less shared joy [64]. 
The TOMTASS also descriptively shows little improvement 
in parents’ ratings of their children's quality of life [17]. 
The KINDL data showed no change in the various domains 
of quality of life assessed by both children and parents. 
The questionnaire data on quality of life contrasted with 
the clearly positive open feedback from parents and par-
ticipants themselves, in which both reported improvements. 
It is also important to reiterate that the TüTASS does not 
aim to train children to be completely adaptable, but rather 
to work together to develop an improved way of dealing 
with special features. Based on this, and due to the constant 
but small-step changes over the year of the intervention, it 
could be difficult for the caregivers to consciously recognise 
and reflect on these changes in everyday life. Nevertheless, 
the parents’ ILK data showed a significant reduction in the 
parental burden of the child's ASD.

In contrast, the parents’ EBI data did not change, but 
showed a reduction in the perceived stress in relation to the 
children. The parents made active use of the accompany-
ing parents' evenings and rated this as positive. In the open 
feedback questionnaire, the parents reported having also 
learned to take better care of themselves. The combination 
of theoretical input, the imparting of concrete knowledge, 
and action strategies on the one hand, and peer exchanges 
and the feeling that other families have similar challenges 
in everyday life on the other could be responsible for these 
positive effects. In terms of content, we relied on the existing 
parent training programmes FAUT-E [65] and FEETASS 
[66]. At parents’ evenings, self-care was often cited as an 
issue. It would certainly make sense to expand upon this side 
of the programme and give parents more possibilities for 
exchanges with others in dealing with children with autism. 
It could also be helpful to install a regular offer for parents, 
which encourages reflection through practical exercises, and 
focuses on body awareness exercises and mindfulness. To 
achieve clearer relief, it may be necessary to support the 
parents’ willingness to make efforts through such appropri-
ate measures as family support.

Our study is not without limitations. Since the first ver-
sion of the training was revised and extended, this is again 
a pilot study. Accordingly, we accept, and would like to 
discuss, the following limitations. We consider the small 
sample sizes and the lack of a control group the major 
limitations. Statistical data analysis was limited with the 
inclusion of 27 children in the study and missing question-
naires further reduced the strength of our study. Therefore, 
a continuation of the project, and thus an increase of sam-
ple size, is essential. Data from the upcoming participants 

1 31610

will serve to increase the accuracy of our statements. The 
lack  of  a  control  group  also  raises  the  possibility  that 
external positive influences may have altered participants’ 
symptom severity. Attempts were made to contain such 
effects by not allowing participants to participate in any 
other  therapeutic  interventions  during  TüTASS.  But  it 
must be emphasized that the results of this study are only 
preliminary and a randomized controlled trial would pro-
vide deeper and more valid insights. Although the results 
of the TüTASS suggest a positive change during the train-
ing, a further investigation of the TüTASS should take 
place in the future, taking into account a control group. 
Another  limitation  is  that  we  did  not  have  sufficient 
resources to re-diagnose all participants using ADOS and 
ADI-R before participation, but instead relied on the diag-
nosis of the pre-treatment specialist. For participants with 
whom ADOS diagnostics were not performed, we used 
SRS and MBAS to verify the assigned diagnosis. For one 
participant who did not meet the criteria, an expert judg-
ment was consulted. Given sufficient time and resources, 
a detailed re-diagnosis would certainly be useful. We are 
pleased to have added objective testing to our data col-
lection with the IDS-II, but the bulk of the data consisted 
of observations on self-assessments by the parents and 
patients themselves. The assessment in the IDS-II test was 
conducted by people who were not involved in the training 
but, due to staff randomisation of the test administration, 
there is no interrater reliability in collecting data using 
the IDS-II. Also, it would have certainly been useful to 
use the ADOS to assess behavioural changes at the end 
of the training, which we were not able to do due to time 
constraints. This should be considered in future studies. 
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that six patients were 
not subjected to IQ testing before the training. Thus, it is 
not guaranteed that they actually have the required IQ of 
over 70. However, based on the perception of the therapists 
and the school types attended by the participants, it can be 
assumed that the IQ was within the normal range. Another 
limitation of our study is that the comorbidities of the par-
ticipants were not clearly collected. Although the parents 
were asked about this before the start of the training, the 
information was incomplete and therefore not usable for 
the study. In the future, comorbidities must be system-
atically recorded to better understand individual disease 
courses and their changes. Another limitation relates to the 
uneven gender distribution, possibly reflecting the higher 
proportion of males with autism [1, 5]. Moreover, in devel-
oping the intervention, we are bound to literature that is 
specifically based on the expression of autistic symptoma-
tology in males. Therefore, we can only make insufficient 
statements as to whether our intervention also adequately 
covers the needs of autistic females. Further, it should be 
mentioned that in previous research mindfulness training 

was mostly applied in individual settings and there are 
hardly any findings on its application in group therapies. 
However, from our clinical expertise, we have found that 
mindfulness exercises in a group setting have the advan-
tage of sharing and practicing them more in social set-
tings. It is clear that not all participants benefited equally. 
However, it was clear from interviews with participants 
and their parents that the mindfulness exercises were found 
to be helpful. Further research is needed in the future to 
investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness exercises in 
group settings and in specific subgroups of autistic chil-
dren and adolescents.

It should also be noted that the evaluation was performed 
on the basis of the primary and secondary outcomes with-
out alpha error correction. Since this was the first evalua-
tion of our treatment and to detect all effects, an exploratory 
examination of the secondary outcomes was performed. 
Therefore, no alpha error correction was performed at this 
point. However, for future evaluation of the training, a larger 
sample with alpha error correction should be used. Consid-
ering an alpha level reduction on p = 0.001 to reduce alpha 
inflation for all secondary outcomes, only the significant 
decrease of CBCL rule-breaking and aggressive behaviour 
would remain, pointing to a good influence of the training 
on important aspects of social behaviour.

Nevertheless, we achieved our overall goal, which was to 
demonstrate therapy- and group-independent efficacy and 
patient acceptance of this group programme. The TüTASS 
represents a theoretically substantiated and currently dis-
cussed therapeutic approach that addresses the real deficits 
of children with ASD. With the application of the revised 
and extended TüTASS in five groups, the feasibility of the 
training could be proven again. Due to the great interest of 
the participants in further group meetings, we decided to 
permanently offer the TüTASS Extended for all participants 
in additional groups. Moreover, the interest in participating 
now extends far beyond the borders of Tübingen. To investi-
gate how children benefit from the training in the long term, 
we are currently evaluating the revised training with further 
survey assessments.
