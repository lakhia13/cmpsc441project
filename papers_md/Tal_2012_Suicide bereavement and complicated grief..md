Introduction

N

early 1 million people die by suicide globally
each year.1 Suicide is one of the top ten leading causes of
death  across  all  age  groups.  Worldwide,  suicide  ranks
among the three leading causes of death among adoles-
cents and young adults. During 2008-2009, 8.3 million peo-
ple over age 18 in the United States (3.7% of the adult US
population) reported having suicidal thoughts in the last
year, and approximately 1 million people (0.5% of the
adult  US  population)  reported  having  made  a  suicide
attempt in the last year. There were just under 37 000
reported deaths by suicide (completed suicides) during the
same time period, and almost 20 times that number of
emergency room visits after nonfatal suicide attempts.2
Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors vary by age, gen-
der,  occupation,  region,  ethnicity,  and  time  of  year.
According to a 2011 report2 released by the CDC, in 2008,
the highest prevalence of suicidal thoughts, plans, and
attempts among those surveyed in the US was reported

Losing a loved to suicide is one is one of life’s most
painful experiences. The feelings of loss, sadness, and
loneliness experienced after any death of a loved one
are often magnified in suicide survivors by feelings of
guilt,  confusion,  rejection,  shame,  anger,  and  the
effects of stigma and trauma. Furthermore, survivors of
suicide  loss  are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  major
depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal
behaviors, as well as a prolonged form of grief called
complicated grief. Added to the burden is the substan-
tial stigma, which can keep survivors away from much
needed support and healing resources. Thus, survivors
may require unique supportive measures and targeted
treatment to cope with their loss. After a brief descrip-
tion of the epidemiology and circumstances of suicide,
we  review  the  current  state  of  research  on  suicide
bereavement, complicated grief in suicide survivors,
and grief treatment for survivors of suicide.

by adults aged 18 to 29 years, non-Hispanic white males,
people who were unemployed, and people with less than
a high school education. There were no reported differ-
ences in the rates of suicide attempts by geographical
region, though people living in the Midwest region of the
US were most likely to have made a suicide plan in the
last year, and those in the Midwest and Western region of
the  US  reported  the  highest  prevalence  of  suicidal
ideation. While rates of completed suicides tend to be
higher among men than women and higher among mid-
dle aged or older adults than among younger people, rates
of nonfatal suicidal behavior are higher among females
and adolescents and young adults.1
The most commonly employed methods of suicide are by
gunshot,  hanging,  drug  overdose  or  other  poisoning,
jumping, asphyxiation, vehicular impact, drowning, exsan-
guination, and electrocution. There are other indirect
methods some attempters may employ, such as behaving
recklessly  or  not  taking  vitally  required  medications.
Many suicides go unreported, as it can be difficult to
identify indirect suicide attempts as suicide, and even
some of the more direct methods of suicide may not be
clearly identifiable attempts. For example, drug overdoses
or vehicular impact attempts are more passive methods,
and it may be difficult to determine whether an event
was an attempt or accident. Conversely, accidental drug
overdoses can often be confused with suicide attempts. If
the deceased left behind a note or told someone about
their plans or intent to take their own life, this can help
those left behind, the suicide survivors, to distinguish
between an attempt and an accident, but often no such
explanation exists. 
Nearly 90% of all suicides are associated with a diag-
nosable mental health or substance-abuse disorder.3 The
underlying vulnerability of suicidal behavior is the sub-
ject of intense research scrutiny, and includes biological,
social, and psychological underpinnings.4-8 While depres-
sion and bipolar disorder are the most common disor-
ders  among  people  who  attempt  suicide,  suicide
attempters may also suffer from substance abuse disor-
ders, other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia,
and  may  feel  that  suicide  is  the  only  way  to  end  an
unbearable pain they may be feeling as the result of
their mental illness, trauma, or a significant loss, rejec-
tion, or disappointment. Additionally, a past history of
suicide  attempts  is  the  best  predictor  for  future
attempts.9 Common themes among suicide attempters
are feelings of hopelessness, despair, and isolation from

family and friends. Despite loved ones’ and profession-
als’ best efforts to support them in their suffering, sui-
cide attempters are often unable to think clearly and
rationally through their pain.
It is estimated that 85% of people in the United States
will know someone personally who has completed sui-
cide.3 For each suicide completed, at least 6 loved ones
are directly affected by the death.10 While not everyone
exposed  to  a  suicide  will  be  acutely  affected  by  the
death,11 this is likely an underestimation as reported fig-
ures may not account for the emergency responders,
health care providers, coworkers, and acquaintances also
affected  by  the  suicide.  That  said,  individuals  most
closely related to the deceased are usually those most
adversely affected by the death.7,12

Grief reactions and characteristics

Grief is the universal, instinctual and adaptive reaction
to the loss of a loved one. It can be subcategorized as
acute grief, which is the initial painful response, integrated
grief, which is the ongoing, attenuated adaptation to the
death of a loved one, and finally complicated grief (CG),
which is sometimes labeled as prolonged, unresolved, or
traumatic grief. CG references acute grief that remains
persistent and intense and does not transition into inte-
grated grief.

Acute grief

After the death of a loved one, regardless of the cause
of death, bereaved individuals may experience intense
and  distressing  emotions.  Immediately  following  the
death, bereaved individuals often experience feelings of
numbness, shock, and denial. For some, this denial is
adaptive as it provides a brief respite from the pain,
allowing time and energy to accept the death and to deal
with practical implications: interacting with the coroner’s
office, planning a funeral, doing what is necessary for
children or others affected by the loss and settling the
estate of the deceased. But, for most, the pain cannot be
put off indefinably. It may not be until days, weeks, or
even months following the death that the reality is fully
comprehended, both cognitively and emotionally, and
the intense feelings of sadness, longing, and emptiness
may not peak until after that recognition sets in. Indeed,
grief has been described as one of the most painful expe-
riences an individual ever faces. Shock, anguish, loss,

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 14 . No. 2 . 2012

anger, guilt, regret, anxiety, fear, intrusive images, deper-
sonalization, feeling overwhelmed, loneliness, unhappi-
ness, and depression are just some of the feeling states
often described.
Feelings of anguish and despair may initially seem ever-
present but soon they occur predominantly in waves or
bursts—the so-called pangs of grief—brought on by con-
crete reminders of or discussions about the deceased.
Once the reality of the loss begins to sink in, over time,
the waves become less intense and less frequent. For
most bereaved persons, these feelings gradually dimin-
ish in intensity, allowing the individual to accept the loss
and re-establish emotional balance. The person knows
what the loss has meant to them but they begin to shift
attention to the world around them.

Integrated grief

Under most circumstances, acute grief instinctively transi-
tions to integrated grief within several months. However,
as  described  later,  this  period  may  be  substantially
extended for those who have lost a loved one to suicide.
The hallmarks of “healing” from the death of a loved one
are the ability of the bereaved to recognize that they have
grieved, to be able to think of the deceased with equa-
nimity, to return to work, to re-experience pleasure, and to
be able to seek the companionship and love of others.13-15
For many, new capacities, wisdom, unrecognized strengths,
new and meaningful relationships, and broader perspec-
tives emerge in the aftermath of loss. However, a small
percentage of individuals are not able to come to such a
resolution and go on to develop a “complicated grief”
reaction.16

Complicated grief

CG is a bereavement reaction in which acute grief is
prolonged, causing distress and interfering with func-
tioning. The bereaved may feel longing and yearning
that  does  not  substantially  abate  with  time  and  may
experience difficulty re-establishing a meaningful life
without the person who died. The pain of the loss stays
fresh and healing does not occur. The bereaved person
feels stuck; time moves forward but the intense grief
remains. Symptoms include recurrent and intense pangs
of grief and a preoccupation with the person who died
mixed  with  avoidance  of  reminders  of  the  loss.  The
bereaved may have recurrent intrusive images of the

death, while positive memories may be blocked or inter-
preted  as  sad,  or  experienced  in  prolonged  states  of
reverie that interfere with daily activities. Life might feel
so empty and the yearning may be so strong that the
bereaved may also feel a strong desire to join their loved
one,  leading  to  suicidal  thoughts  and  behaviors.
Alternatively, the pain from the loss may be so intense
that their own death may feel like the only possible out-
let of relief. 
Some reports suggest that as many as 10% to 20% of
bereaved individuals develop CG.17,18 Notably, survivors
of suicide loss are at higher risk of developing CG.11,19
CG is associated with poor functional, psychological, and
physical  outcomes.  Individuals  with  CG  often  have
impairments  in  their  daily  functioning,  occupational
functioning,  and  social  functioning.20-23 They  have
increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity,19,24-26 including
higher rates of comorbid major depression and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, individ-
uals with CG are at higher risk for suicidal ideation and
behavior.27-32 Additionally, CG is associated with poor
physical  health  outcomes.33,34 Overall,  untreated  CG
results in suffering, impairment, and poor health out-
comes, and will persist indefinitely without treatment.

Bereavement after suicide

Suicide survivors often face unique challenges that dif-
fer from those who have been bereaved by other types
of death. In addition to the inevitable grief, sadness, and
disbelief typical of all grief, overwhelming guilt, confu-
sion, rejection, shame, and anger are also often promi-
nent.11,35 These painful experiences may be further com-
plicated by the effects of stigma36,37 and trauma.38 For
these reasons, grief experienced by suicide survivors may
be qualitatively different than grief after other causes of
death. Thus, while Sveen and Walby39 found no signifi-
cant differences in rates of comorbid psychiatric disor-
ders and suicidality among suicide bereaved individuals
compared  with  other  bereaved  individuals  across  41
studies,  they  did  find  higher  incidences  of  rejection,
blaming,  shame,  stigma,  and  the  need  to  conceal  the
cause of death among those bereaved by suicide as com-
pared with other causes of death.
As outlined by Jordan,11 certain characteristics of suicide
bereavement that are qualitatively different from other
forms of bereavement may lead to delays in survivors’
healing.

Need to understand, guilt, and responsibility

Most suicide survivors are plagued by the need to make
sense of the death and to understand why the suicide
completers made the decision to end their life. A message
left by the deceased might help the survivors understand
why their loved one decided to take his or her own life.
Even with such explanations there are often still unan-
swered questions survivors feel they are left to untangle,
including their own role in the sequence of events.
Another common response to a loved one’s suicide is an
overestimation of one’s own responsibility, as well as
guilt for not having been able to do more to prevent
such an outcome. Survivors are often unaware of the
many factors that contributed to the suicide, and in ret-
rospect  see  things  they  may  have  not  been  aware  of
before the event. Survivors will often replay events up
to the last moments of their loved ones’ lives, digging for
clues and warnings that they blame themselves for not
noticing or taking seriously enough. They might recall
past disagreements or arguments, plans not fulfilled, calls
not returned, words not said, and ruminate on how if
only they had done or said something differently, maybe
the outcome would have been different. 
Parents who have lost a child to suicide can be especially
afflicted  with  feelings  of  guilt  and  responsibility.40
Parents who have lost a child to suicide report more
guilt, shame, and shock than spouses and children.41 They
often think “If only I had not lost my temper” or “If only
I had been around more.” The death of child is arguably
the most difficult type of loss a person can experience,17
particularly when the death is by suicide. Parents feel
responsible  for  their  children,  especially  when  the
deceased  child  is  young.  Indeed,  age  of  the  suicide
deceased has been found to be one of the most impor-
tant factors predicting intensity of grief.42
While guilt is not a grief response specific to death by sui-
cide, it is not uncommon for a survivor to view the suicide
as an event that can be prevented. Therefore, it is easy for
survivors to get caught up in self-blame.37 Understanding
that most suicide completers were battling a psychiatric
illness when they died helps some survivors make sense
of the death and can decrease self-blame. 

Rejection, perceived abandonment, and anger

to give up and leave their loved ones behind. They are
often left feeling bewildered, wondering why their rela-
tionship with the person was not enough to keep them
from taking their lives.43 One survivor told us that when
she had shared her own suicidal ideation with her sister,
her sister made her promise to never act upon her suici-
dal thoughts. When her sister took her own life, this sur-
vivor not only felt abandoned, but she also felt deceived.
She felt angry about this perceived deception, she felt
angry for being left behind to deal with life’s stresses
without her sister, and she felt angry that her sister put
her and her family through the pain of dealing with her
death by suicide. She was now alone.
Suicide bereaved spouses often struggle because the mar-
riage may be the most intimate relationship an individual
ever experiences, and to be left by a self-inflicted death
can feel like the ultimate form of rejection.44 Children who
lose their parents to suicide are left to feel that the person
whom they count on the most for the most basic needs
has abandoned them.45,46 Results of one study suggest that
children whose parents completed suicide and had an
alcohol-use disorder were less likely to feel guilty or aban-
doned, and suicide bereaved spouses whose partners had
an alcohol-use disorder were more likely to react with
anger than other suicide bereaved spouses.47
Anger is a common emotion among many survivors of
suicide. It can be experienced as anger at the person who
died, at themselves, at other family members or acquain-
tances, at providers, at God, or at the world in general.
Often  survivors  feel  angry  at  themselves  for  feeling
angry, as they also recognize that the deceased was suf-
fering greatly when deciding to die. Survivors may also
feel  angry  towards  other  family  members  or  mental
health providers for not doing more to prevent the death
and angry towards the deceased for not seeking help. A
few survivors told us that their loved ones took their
lives after a shameful behavior was revealed and/or in
the midst of strained relationships. Survivors under these
circumstances  often  feel  anger  at  the  deceased  for
depriving them of the opportunity to work through the
difficult time or for not taking responsibility for their
behavior. 

Stigma

Survivors of suicide may feel rejected or abandoned by
the deceased because they see the deceased as choosing

Unlike  other  modes  of  death,  suicide  is  stigmatized,
despite recent valiant strides to destigmatize mental ill-
ness and suicide. Many bereaved individuals report that

it  can  be  difficult  to  talk  to  others  about  their  loss
because others often feel uncomfortable talking about
the suicide. This can leave the bereaved feeling isolated.48
The feeling of being unable to talk about the death is
often compounded by the perceived need to conceal the
cause of death. At times, other people’s belief systems,
including that of the survivors themselves, can be a bar-
rier to accepting the death and a deterrent to talking
about it. When coping with a loss, people often turn to
religion for comfort and guidance. A challenge for some
survivors  is  that  several  religions  impose  shameful
restrictions on the grief rituals for those who have been
bereaved by suicide. Suicide survivors face additional
logistical barriers when handling the deceased’s business
after  a  suicide,  as  most  insurance  policies  even  have
clauses with built-in stigma.49 Despite alarmingly high
rates of suicides in the United States military, it was only
until very recently (July 6, 2011) that the United States
Government  began  to  honorably  acknowledge  the
bereaved after a military suicide, as is done for other
deaths that occur in combat zones. For many people,
talking about their loved ones is vital for their recovery
from their loss. The stigma of suicide poses a barrier to
the healing process.37

Trauma

Survivors of suicide are more likely than other bereaved
individuals to develop symptoms of PTSD.50 The major-
ity of suicide methods involve considerable bodily dam-
age. Occasionally, survivors are witnesses to the final act,
or the first to discover the dead body. Those left to find
the deceased’s body struggle to get the gruesome images
of out of their minds.51 In such circumstances, traumatic
distress, marked by fear, horror, vulnerability, and disin-
tegration of cognitive assumptions ensues. One survivor
told us the poignant story of her boyfriend, who imme-
diately after a breakup, climbed to a nearby bridge and
leaped to his death while she looked on in horror. Not
unexpectedly, her grief was replete with such trauma
symptoms as preoccupation with reminders, terror-filled
recollections,  avoidance  of  high  places,  and  other
reminders. After a death by suicide, themes of violence,
victimization, and volition (ie, the choice of death over
life, as in the case of suicide) are common and may be
intermixed with other aspects of grief. Disbelief, despair,
anxiety symptoms, preoccupation with the deceased and
the  circumstances  of  the  death,  withdrawal,  hyper-

arousal, and dysphoria are more intense and more pro-
longed  than  they  are  under  nontraumatic  circum-
stances.52

Suicide risk in survivors

Suicide and mental illness runs in families, likely a result
of  both  heritability  and  environmental  factors.7,8
Survivors of suicide may be left to struggle with their
own suicidal ideation, while seeing that the deceased
escaped the anguish and put an end to their suffering.
Despite the fact that the suicide bereaved intimately
understand the intense pain and suffering experienced
by all those who survive a suicide loss, survivors are at
higher risk themselves for suicidal ideation and behav-
ior than are other bereaved individuals.53,54 Crosby and
Sacks55 reported that people who had known someone
who died by suicide in the last year were 1.6 times more
likely to have suicidal thoughts, 2.9 times more likely to
have a plan for suicide, and 3.7 times more likely to have
made a suicide attempt themselves. The pain of dealing
with  the  loss  of  a  loved  one  by  suicide  coupled  with
shame,  rejection,  anger,  perceived  responsibility,  and
other risk factors, can be too much to bear, and to some,
suicide seems like the only way to end the pain. Some
may feel closer to their loved one by taking their life in
the  same  way.  Indeed,  a  survivor  told  us  of  how  her
mother’s death by suicide was so difficult to bear for her
sister who, like her father, also struggled with bipolar dis-
order, that her sister completed suicide in the exact same
way the following year, on the same date, at the same
time. Finally, as with other types of losses, yearning for a
loved one can be so intense, that the desire to join the
loved one in death can be overwhelming. 

Complicated grief in survivors of suicide

While research results are mixed regarding whether grief
differs by mode of death,43 data suggest that the inci-
dence of CG is high among survivors of suicide, as sur-
vivors of suicide loss are at higher risk of developing
CG.11,19 Specifically, Mitchell and colleagues57 reported
that the rate of CG was 43% among their pilot study
population of 60 Caucasian, Christian, employed, mostly
female suicide bereaved participants grieving a total of
16 deaths collectively. This is at least double the rates of
up to 10% to 20% of CG reported in the general popu-
lation.17,18 Further, Mitchell and colleagues report that

1 8 1

PAGES_13_AG_1001_BA.qxd:DCNS#52  6/06/12  12:06  Page 182

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

suicide survivors closely related to the deceased experi-
ence  rates  of  complicated  grief  at  twice  the  level  as
friends, coworkers, and relatives (57% to 80% vs 14% to
28%). 
Individuals from that same sample who developed CG
were almost 10 times more likely to have reported sui-
cidal ideation 1 month after the death of their loved
ones, controlling for depression.30 In another sample of
participants  with  CG,  suicide  bereaved  participants
reported  twice  the  rate  of  recurrent  and  current
depression compared with other bereaved individuals,
reported higher rates of suicidal ideation before the
death,  and  were  at  least  as  likely  to  report  suicidal
ideation since the death as other bereaved participants
suffering from complicated grief.58 Finally, Latham and
Prigerson found that CG is associated with higher lev-
els  of  suicidal  ideation  independent  of  PTSD  and
depression.29
One study49 suggests that 3 to 5 years is the time point at
which grief after a suicide loss begins to integrate, rais-
ing the question of how the time frame used in discus-
sions of normal and integrated grief applies to grief after
suicide, and therefore what is the “normal” timeline for
grief after suicide. That said, in at least one sample stud-
ied,59 symptoms of traumatic grief 6 months after a peer
suicide predicted the onset of depression or PTSD at
subsequent timepoints. Therefore, it is important for clin-
icians to know how to identify traumatic grief in order
to  provide  appropriate  support  and  treatment  when
needed.

Treatment

Considering that grief is a normal, adaptive response to
loss,  noncomplicated  grief  that  is  not  comorbid  with
depression does not warrant any formal intervention in
most circumstances. However, in light of the above delin-
eated stigma, anger, and guilt associated with suicide loss,
reassurance, support, and information provided by fam-
ily, friends, and, sometimes, clergy is often not available
or sufficient for survivors of suicide loss. Although there
exists a paucity of treatment studies in survivors of sui-
cide,60 most experts agree that: (i) initial attention should
be focused on traumatic distress; (ii) self-help support
groups can be beneficial; and (iii) there is a role for both
pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in those already
showing adverse mental health effects or at high risk for
severe and persistent difficulties.37,61

Support groups

While few survivors seek help,62 many survivors who
attend support groups find them to be at least moder-
ately helpful,63 particularly survivors who either do not
have adequate social support in the family or immediate
community,  or  who  are  unable  to  access  friends  or
acquaintances because of stigma or other roadblocks.64
For many survivors, participation in support groups is
felt to be their only access to people who they feel can
understand them, or the only place where their feelings
are  acceptable,  thus  providing  them  with  their  only
means of catharsis. The universality of their experiences
provides great reassurance that they are not alone in
their feelings and that others have faced similar experi-
ences  and  have  come  out  not  only  intact  but  often
stronger. The bonds that develop among people can be
very strong as they join a club whose “dues” are high
and as they offer each other mutual support. Through
such supports, individuals may receive helpful sugges-
tions for taking care of real-life obligations such as deal-
ing with estates and legal issues: talking to others, includ-
ing  children;  developing  fitting  memorials  for  the
deceased; coping with holidays and special events; and
setting realistic goals for one’s new life which now has
such a huge and unfillable void.
Common  components  of  successful  support  groups
include providing accurate information, permission to
grieve, normalization of affects and behaviors that may
be totally out of keeping with the person’s usual state,
and most important, conveying to survivors that they are
not alone. Often it is helpful to see others who have “sur-
vived” the suicides of their own loved ones, and eventu-
ally it may even be helpful to have the opportunity to
help others. Support groups that are relatively homoge-
neous (eg, suicide survivors rather than any bereaved, or
those who have lost children rather than other losses)
are often the most helpful.35 Survivors of suicide loss
groups may also be particularly effective for children
who have lost a parent or family member by suicide.61
Survivors  can  locate  support  groups  on  Web  sites
belonging to groups such as the American Foundation
for  Suicide  Prevention  (AFSP)  and  the  American
Association of Suicidology (AAS) which host directo-
ries of over 400 suicide support groups throughout the
United States. To locate support groups worldwide, sur-
vivors can visit the Web site of the the International
Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP), an organi-

zation  officially  affiliated  with  the  World  Health
Organization. With membership in over 50 countries
across the globe, the IASP postvention (suicide bereave-
ment) taskforce offers a multitude of resources to sur-
vivors including survivor guides, 24/7 helplines for peo-
ple of all age groups including child survivors, and does
so in multiple languages. Some survivors are wary of
groups and may prefer individual counseling or family
therapy,  indeed  suicide  has  a  profound  effect  on  the
entire family,11,37 or even Web-based support groups or
bibliotherapy.64-67 These same organizations also sponsor
organized survivors’ events such as suicide prevention
walks and survivors of suicide days, but too few people
know about the events and some may find it difficult to
go to their first event unless they go with support of a
friend of a family member. Many survivors who attend
these events extol their benefits and comment on the
sense of belonging, of being part of a larger community,
and of nonjudgmental acceptance that they experience.

Suicide bereavement comorbid with depression or
post-traumatic stress disorder

For  survivors  whose  loss  has  triggered  a  depressive
episode or PTSD, support groups often are not enough.
Many clinicians avoid prescribing medication or formal
psychotherapy even in the face of a full major depressive
syndrome or PTSD, falsely rationalizing that depressive
and trauma symptoms are normal in the face of loss and
that treatment might “interfere” with the grieving process.
But studies have shown that appropriate treatment for
these symptoms is indicated and efficacious.68-70 Thus, if a
suicide  survivor  is  experiencing  a  Major  Depressive
Disorder (MDD) or PTSD, the clinician should consider
medications and/or psychotherapy as indicated for these
clinical conditions. 
Clinicians often are unclear as to both if, and when, to ini-
tiate treatment. As in other, non-bereavement instances
of MDD, the decision rests on various factors, including
the severity, intensity, and pervasiveness of symptoms,
comorbidities, past history of MDD, previous outcomes
to treatments, safety, and patient preferences. A second
decision point regards how to treat comorbid psychiatric
conditions. At present, there is no single form of psy-
chotherapy and/or antidepressant medication ready to be
hailed as the treatment of first choice for MDD or PTSD
in the context of suicide bereavement.15 However, there is
no reason to suspect that psychotherapy should not be as

effective, either alone or in combination with medications,
as it is in other, non-bereavement or non-suicide-related
instances of MDD or PTSD. Meanwhile, several studies
document the effectiveness of antidepressant medications
for bereavement-related depression.68-74 All classes of anti-
depressant medications are about equally effective, but
differences  in  their  side  effect  profiles  usually  dictate
which medication is best suited for an individual patient.
The authors recommend following American Psychiatric
Association Treatment Guidelines75 for the treatment of
depression  and  PTSD  and  providing  an  integrative
approach based on the individual’s needs, resources and
availability of treatment, that incorporates support, edu-
cation, cognitive and interpersonal techniques, psychody-
namic principles, grief-specific strategies, bright light, exer-
cise, and cutting-edge medication management.76

Suicide bereavement and complicated grief

As previously outlined, survivors of suicide loss are at
increased risk of developing CG. Without treatment, CG
symptoms follow an unrelenting course. The effective-
ness and role of pharmacologic management of CG are
not yet established, but the literature suggests prelimi-
nary promise for the use of bupropion69 and escitalo-
pram.77,78
Although not specific to suicide bereavement, studies
support  the  use  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy
(CBT),79,80 time-limited interpretive group therapy,81,82
and complicated grief therapy83 for the treatment of CG.
Complicated grief treatment (CGT) is a modification of
interpersonal psychotherapy, adding elements of cogni-
tive behavioral therapy, exposure, gestalt, and motiva-
tional interviewing. The basic principle underlying CGT
is that acute grief will transition instinctively to integrated
grief if the complications of the grief are addressed and
the natural mourning process is supported. Each session
includes loss-focused grief work as well as restoration-
focused attention. The loss-focused grief work aids the
bereaved in accepting the loss, talking about the death
and surrounding events, starting to take pleasure and
comfort in memories of the loved one, and feeling a deep
sense of connection with the deceased. It uses imagery
and other exercises that resemble exposure techniques
coupled with cognitive restructuring. The restoration-
focused work helps the person become free to pursue
personal goals, engage in meaningful relationships with
others,  and  experience  satisfaction  and  enjoyment.

C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

Studies support the robust efficacy of CGT for the treat-
ment of complicated grief, even in situations of great
severity, chronicity, and comorbidity.83-85
When complicated grief occurs in the context of suicide
bereavement, the psychiatric and psychological litera-
ture provide few, if any, empirically based guidelines.62,86
It is not unlikely that the CGT described above may be
beneficial for many suicide survivors with CG, but the
therapy  may  need  to  be  modified  to  provide  more
emphasis on the recurrent themes of suicide bereave-
ment:  the  quest  to  understand  why,  guilt,  rejection,
shame, anger, and stigma. The role of medications is not
at all clear, but since there is some evidence that med-
ications may be of benefit in non-suicide-related CG,
pharmacotherapy may also be helpful to suicide sur-
vivors with CG. Since CG often co-occurs with MDD
and PTSD, attention to these disorders may also be nec-
essary; for example, depression focused psychotherapy,
antidepressant medication, and prolonged exposure51
may be indicated in specific situations as an adjunct to
CGT, as an alternative to CGT, or if therapy does not
result in an optimal outcome. While research suggests
that it is the exposure component of CGT that is the
essence of its effectiveness,87 whether or not this level of
exposure therapy is sufficient to treat suicide survivors
with  or  without  CG  and/or  PTSD  remains  to  be
explored. More research on the needs of suicide sur-
vivors, including individualized treatment approaches
for unique patient profiles, is badly needed.60

Conclusions

Suicide survivors face unique challenges that can impede
the normal grieving process, putting survivors at increased
risk for developing complicated grief, concurrent depres-
sion, PTSD, and suicidal ideation. If left untreated, these
conditions can lead to prolonged suffering, impaired func-
tioning, negative health outcomes, and can even be fatal.
Because of the stigma associated with suicide, survivors
may feel they are unable to secure enough support from
friends or family, but may benefit from attending support
groups with other survivors who uniquely share their expe-
riences and offer a haven for survivors to feel understood.
Because suicide survivors are at higher risk for developing
PTSD and complicated grief and may be more susceptible
to depression, it is important for survivors and clinicians to
be mindful of and address troubling symptoms should they
occur. Treatment should include the best combinations of
education, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy, often with
a focus on depression, guilt, and trauma. While the field of
suicide bereavement research is growing, there remains a
need for more knowledge on the psychological sequelae of
suicide bereavement and its treatment in general, and par-
ticularly among the elderly, those with pre-existing men-
tal illnesses, men, and minorities.88 ❏

Duelo complicado tras la pérdida de un
cercano que se ha suicidado

Deuil compliqué après la perte d’un proche
par suicide

El perder a un ser amado por suicidio es una de las
experiencias  más  dolorosas  de  la  vida.  Los  senti-
mientos de pérdida, tristeza y soledad experimenta-
dos después de cualquier muerte de un ser querido
a menudo se amplían en los sobrevivientes de suici-
das con sentimientos de culpa, confusión, rechazo,
vergüenza  e  ira,  y  también  con  los  efectos  del
estigma y del trauma. Además, los sobrevivientes de
pérdidas por suicidio tienen un alto riesgo de desa-
rrollar depresión mayor, trastorno por estrés pos-
traumático y conductas suicidas, como también una
forma prolongada de duelo llamada duelo compli-
cado. Añadido al peso que esto implica está el impor-
tante estigma, el cual puede mantener a los deudos
alejados de la tan necesaria ayuda y de los recursos
curativos. Por lo tanto los deudos pueden requerir de
medidas de soporte especiales y de un tratamiento
particular para afrontar sus pérdidas. Después de una
breve descripción de la epidemiología y de las cir-
cunstancias del suicidio se revisa el estado actual de
la investigación en el duelo por suicidio, el duelo
complicado en deudos de suicidas y el tratamiento
del duelo en sobrevivientes de suicidas.  

Perdre un être aimé par suicide est l’une des expé-
riences les plus douloureuses de la vie. Les senti-
ments de perte, de tristesse et de solitude ressentis
après la perte d’un être cher sont souvent amplifiés,
chez les survivants d’un suicidé, par des sentiments
de culpabilité, de confusion, de refus, de honte, de
peur et les effets du stigmate et du traumatisme.
Les survivants à une perte par suicide ont en outre
un risque plus élevé de développer une dépression
majeure, un état de stress post-traumatique et des
comportements suicidaires, ainsi qu’une douleur
morale prolongée appelée deuil compliqué. Le stig-
mate considérable qui s’ajoute au fardeau initial
peut éloigner les survivants du soutien nécessaire
et des possibilités de guérison. Les survivants ont
donc besoin de mesures de soutien particulières et
d’un traitement ciblé pour faire face à leur perte.
Après une brève description de l’épidémiologie et
des circonstances du suicide, nous analysons l’état
actuel de la recherche sur le deuil après un suicide,
sur la douleur morale compliquée et son traitement
chez ceux qui survivent au suicide d’un proche.
