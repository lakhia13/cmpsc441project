Abstract
Background  The majority of persons with dementia (PWD) are mainly cared for by their family members in the 
home. Evidence is however scarce on family caregivers’ psychosocial burden and quality of life in Asian countries 
including Malaysia. This study describes the baseline data of a telephone-delivered psychoeducational intervention 
study and examines the determinants of outcome measures (caregiver burden, depressive and anxiety symptoms, 
quality of life and caregiving self-efficacy) among Malaysian family caregivers to PWD.

Methods  This was a cross-sectional study originated from the baseline survey of a randomized control trial of 
121 family caregivers recruited from lists of PWD who were registered at memory and psychiatry clinics in three 
tertiary care hospitals in Malaysia. The participants were assessed for caregiver burden by the Zarit Burden Interview, 
depressive and anxiety symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life by the Control, 
Autonomy, Self-Realization, and Pleasure Scale, and caregiving self-efficacy by the Revised Scale for Caregiving 
Self-Efficacy.

Results  Prevalence of caregiver burden was 69.4%, depressive symptoms 32.2% and anxiety symptoms 32.2%. Family 
caregivers to PWD having perceived peer support e.g., social/family/friend/significant other supports were less likely 
to report caregiver burden, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and more likely to report higher levels of quality of 
life and caregiving self-efficacy. Being married and PWD’s ability to self-care were associated with lesser likelihood 
of experiencing caregiver burden, depressive and anxiety symptoms. The other determinants of greater probability 
of reporting better quality of life were caregivers’ employment and having Islamic faith. Marital status (married), 
PWD’s ability to self-care, spousal relationship with PWD and shared caregiving process were associated with higher 
likelihood of reporting caregiving self-efficacy.

Conclusion  Caregiver burden, depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in family caregivers to PWD in 
Malaysia. Social support and caregiving related factors influence family caregivers’ quality of life and caregiving self-
efficacy. Implementing psychoeducational intervention and support in the psychiatry and memory clinics may help 
improve the psychosocial burden, quality of life and caregiving self-efficacy in family caregivers of PWD.

Trial registration  ISRCTN14565552 (retrospectively registered).

Background
Globally,  variations  exist  in  cultural  norms  and  factors 
such  as  accessibility,  affordability  of  health  and  social 
services which impact reliance of persons with dementia 
(PWD) on family members to take on a caregiver role [1]. 
Malaysia  as  an  aging  society  with  a  rapid  demographic 
change has, similar to other countries, a growing number 
of  PWD,  creating  challenges  for  health  and  social  care 
[2].  Due  to  the  trajectory  of  the  disease,  providing  care 
for  a  PWD  can  entail  long  care  hours  over  a  prolonged 
period  impacting  on  the  caregiver  and  family  function 
and  challenging  stability  of  the  family  [3].  Caring  for  a 
family  member  with  dementia  can  be  demanding  and 
stressful. Caregivers to PWD have shown to be at higher 
risk  of  developing  depression  and  anxiety  than  persons 
caring for family members with other illnesses [4], expe-
rience significantly higher levels of caregiver burden [5], 
low level of quality of life [6] and low level of self-efficacy 
[7].

Self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety are 
common  in  family  caregivers  impacting  on  health  and 
quality  of  life  while  caring  for  a  PWD  [8].  Women  and 
spousal caregivers are reported as more likely to develop 
anxiety  and  depression  than  their  counterparts  [4,  8]. 
Factors  that  may  moderate  the  presence  of  anxiety  dis-
order  in  caregivers  to  PWD  include  living  with  the  care 
recipient,  level  of  dependence  of  PWD,  being  a  female 
caregiver,  poor  relationship  with  the  care  recipient  and 
health of the caregiver [9]. According to Wulff et al. [8], 
the  amount  of  time  spent  caring  for  the  family  member 
and the severity of person’s dementia impact on the levels 
of depression and anxiety experienced.

Caregiving responsibilities for a PWD include support-
ing the person with instrumental activities of daily living 
such as cooking, shopping, etc., and even basic activities 
of  daily  living  such  as  bathing,  dressing,  mobility,  etc. 
[10, 11]. For a PWD living at home, such support is often 
provided  by  family  members,  70%  of  whom  are  female 
[12]. According to Tulek et al. [6] high level of caregiver 
burden is related to low quality of life. Family caregivers’ 
quality  of  life  can  directly  impact  on  the  care  they  pro-
vide for the PWD, and how they cope with their own life 
situation. As dementia is a progressive disease, the family 
caregiver’s quality of life changes over time in relation to 

the needs of the caregiver and ability to handle the care 
recipient’s deteriorating condition.

There are multiple benefits of caring for a PWD which 
include perception of caring as a meaningful task, a feel-
ing  of  giving  back  to  the  loved  one,  sense  of  close  fam-
ily relationship and satisfaction of providing care [5, 13]. 
However,  positive  aspects  of  caregiving  can  be  accom-
panied  by  the  strains  of  caregiving  leading  to  a  sense  of 
caregiver  burden  [5]. This  in  turn  can  negatively  impact 
caregivers  multi-dimensionally, 
i.e.,  physically,  psy-
chologically,  emotionally,  behaviourally  and  financially 
[14].  Evidence  from  around  the  world  such  as  China 
[15],  Indonesia  [16],  Turkey  [6]  indicate  high  levels  of 
caregiver  burden  for  family  caregivers  to  PWD  living  at 
home. Several factors are identified as predictors of care-
giver  burden.  These  include  neuropsychiatric  symptoms 
of PWD [17], functional (cognitive and physical) decline 
of the PWD cared for which is related to increased num-
ber of hours spent in caregiving activities [18], and lack of 
perceived social support [15, 16]. Spouses to PWD iden-
tified  that  their  partners  had  between  five  to  eight  co-
existing neuropsychiatric symptoms causing varied levels 
of  distress  for  the  spouses  concerned  [19].  Family  care-
givers’  socio-demographic  characteristics  such  as  being 
a  woman  [16,  20],  cohabitation  and  spousal  relationship 
with the PWD [18] are also identified as significant pre-
dictors of caregiver burden.

Several  studies  suggest  that  self-efficacy  can  be  a  use-
ful  concept  for  explaining  variations  in  caregiving  abili-
ties  of  family  caregivers  of  PWD.  Self-efficacy  refers  to 
the perception of a person´s capacity to manage respon-
sibilities  and  tasks  successfully  and  confidently  [21].  In 
relation  to  family  caregiving  in  dementia,  self-efficacy 
has  also  been  suggested  to  represent  family  caregiver’s 
knowledge and preparedness in managing the challenges 
of  care  [22].  Feeling  prepared  is  reported  to  be  associ-
ated  with  low  levels  of  distress  [7].  Improvements  of 
caregiver  self-efficacy  may  positively  influence  caregiver 
health and well-being [22] and reduce levels of caregiver 
burden [23]. Likewise, education and skills training, case 
management,  and  interventions  that  target  caregiver’s 
negative  emotions  are  associated  with  improvements  in 
self-efficacy [24].

Various  educational,  psychosocial,  and  multicompo-
nent interventions have demonstrated modest success in 
improving  the  quality  of  life  and  negative  consequences 
associated with caregiving for persons with dementia [17, 
25].  In-person  interventions  can  be  difficult  for  caregiv-
ers due to lack of transportation, being homebound, liv-
ing  in  a  rural  setting,  time  pressures  of  caregiving,  or 
stigma associated with seeking help  [25]. In response to 
these  issues,  telephone-based  interventions  have  been 
reported to improve functioning in caregivers, to persons 
with dementia, with a variety of clinical problems in USA 
[25], Australia [26], UK [27], Europe [28] and Hong Kong 
[29]. Due to its high accessibility and cost-effective imple-
mentation,  the  telephone-delivered  support  services  for 
dementia caregivers have received global attention. Stud-
ies  indicated  that  telephone-based  interventions  bene-
fited caregivers by means of increasing use of appropriate 
community services, reducing caregiver burden, depres-
sion and distress related to care recipient behaviour, and 
improving caregiving self-efficacy and quality of life [26, 
30].

According  to  the  Alzheimer  Disease  International 
[31], the prevalence of dementia in Malaysia was 0.063% 
in  2005  with  the  annual  incidence  rate  of  0.020%,  and 
in  2015  was  0.401%.  It  is  projected  that  this  figure  will 
increase to 0.852% and 1.924% in 2030 and 2050, respec-
tively.  Like  in  many  Asian  countries,  family  members  in 
Malaysia provide most of the care and support to PWD 
living in the community [32, 33]. With a view to develop 
and  evaluate  a  care  and  support  intervention  for  family 
caregivers  to  PWD  living  in  the  community  in  Malay-
sia,  it  is  imperative  to  understand  their  current  situa-
tion.  Hence,  this  paper  describes  the  baseline  data  of 
a  telephone-delivered  psychoeducational  intervention 
study and explores the associated factors of the outcome 
measures caregiver burden, depressive and anxiety symp-
toms, self-efficacy, and quality of life among family care-
givers to PWD living at home in Malaysia.

Methods
Study design and setting

Data  for  this  cross-sectional  study  originated  from  the 
baseline  survey  of  a  randomized  control  trial  (RCT) 
aimed to assess the efficacy of a telephone-delivered psy-
choeducational intervention. The intervention was deliv-
ered by healthcare professionals (occupational therapists 
and  nurses)  to  reduce  caregiver  burden,  depressive  and 
anxiety  symptoms,  and  improve  caregiving  self-efficacy 
and quality of life among family caregivers to PWD. Par-
ticipants  were  recruited  from  lists  of  PWD  over  eight 
months  (August  2022  to  March  2023)  who  were  reg-
istered  at  memory  and  psychiatry  clinics  of  Universiti 
Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Sultan 
Ahmad Shah Medical Centre (SASMEC) of International 

Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) and Hospital Tengku 
Ampuan  Afzan  (HTAA).  UKMMC  (a  university  tertiary 
hospital) located in Selangor state, and SASMEC (a uni-
versity tertiary hospital) and HTAA (a state level tertiary 
hospital) located in Pahang state in west and east coasts 
of Malaysia, respectively (see Additional file 1).

Participants

Participants in this study were family caregivers of PWD 
who  had  received  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  dementia.  Par-
ticipants  were  included  if  they  were  Malaysian  citizens, 
aged 18 years or over, able to read and write Malay, pri-
mary  caregivers  (in  case  of  more  than  one  caregiver), 
in caregiving role for at least 6 months with at least 4 h 
caregiving  activities  per  day,  and  had  smartphones. 
Exclusion criteria included if family caregivers described 
themselves as having any major acute medical illnesses or 
if they could not participate throughout the entire study 
due to lack of time.

Assuming a current improvement rate of 30% in care-
giver  burden  and  depressive  symptoms,  expected  net 
improvement  of  25–30%  with  the  intervention  [34],  a 
significance level of 5% and power of 80%, the estimated 
sample  size  for  the  RCT  was  100  (50  in  intervention 
group  and  50  in  control  group).  In  case  of  the  second-
ary  outcome  i.e.,  quality  of  life,  considering  the  mean 
(SD)  in  treatment  group  of  55.58  (17.75)  and  control  of 
50.00  (18.37)  as  a  result  of  intervention  [35],  a  median 
effect size of 0.5 [36], and a significance level of 5% and 
power of 80%, resulted in a calculated sample size of 51 
(rounded to 50) in each group. In both calculations, the 
one-sided  test  was  considered.  Taking  into  account  a 
drop-out  rate  of  20%,  the  estimated  sample  size  was  60 
participants  in  each  group.  Initially,  380  family  caregiv-
ers were screened for eligibility and 121 were assigned to 
either a psychoeducation group (intervention group) or a 
control group using a computerized 4-block randomiza-
tion program (Fig. 1).

Data collection

Baseline  data  for  the  RCT  were  collected  from  August 
2022  to  March  2023.  Training  of  the  research  assistants 
included  information  on  the  questionnaire  and  data 
collection  procedures.  The  trained  research  assistants 
were  blinded  to  group  assignment,  communicated  with 
the  family  caregivers  by  telephone  to  provide  detailed 
information  about  the  purpose  and  type  of  study.  Fur-
ther  information  was  given  about  the  psychoeducation 
intervention  including  its  procedures  and  protocols, 
and risks as well as benefits of participating in the study. 
Only  those  family  caregivers  who  provided  informed 
consent  to  participate  were  enrolled  in  this  study.  The 
research  assistants  then  interviewed  the  participants  at 
baseline  over  telephone  using  structured  questionnaire

to collect information on their socioeconomic condition 
(family  caregiver’s  age,  sex,  education  [primary,  second-
ary  or  tertiary],  occupation  [homemaker/unemployed, 
retired,  employed  incorporating  government  and  non-
government  employee],  monthly  household 
income 
[≥RM 10,960 categorized as high-, RM 4,581–RM 10,959 
middle-  and  ≤RM  4.580  low-income]);  caregiving  infor-
mation  (duration  of  care,  hours  of  caregiving  per  day, 
if  the  caregiving  was  shared  by  other  family  members, 
number  of  family  members  involved  in  shared  caregiv-
ing, caregiver’s relationship with PWD); perceived social 
support.  Perceived  social  support  was  assessed  by  the 
validated Malay version of the Multidimensional Scale of 
Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) [37]. MSPSS included 
12 items, scored on a 7-point scale from 1 (very strongly 
disagree)  to  7  (very  strongly  agree).  MSPSS  comprised 
of  three  subscales,  including  family  support  (4  items), 
friends’ support (4 items) and significant others’ support 
(4  items),  a  higher  score  indicating  more  support  [38]. 
Significant support from others indicated support from a 
special person who was available when needed, was a real 
source of comfort. The scale demonstrated good internal 
consistency in the present study with Cronbach’s alpha of 
0.93 on the whole scale and between 0.91 and 0.92 on the 
three subscales.

Outcome measures

The  outcome  measures  in  the  study  included  caregiver 
burden, depressive and anxiety symptoms, quality of life 
and caregiving self-efficacy.

Caregiver burden

Caregiver  burden  was  measured  by  the  Zarit  Burden 
Interview  (ZBI).  ZBI  is  a  22-item  inventory,  where  each 
item is rated on a 5-point scale (0–4) with the total score 
ranging  from  0  to  88.  A  higher  score  indicates  greater 
burden. ZBI assesses caregiver’s subjective feelings of the 
negative impact of caregiving on emotional and physical 
health  functioning,  social  life  and  financial  status  [39]. 
The ZBI has been validated in Malaysia, with 70.8% sen-
sitivity  and  69.2%  specificity  using  an  optimum  cut-off 
score of 22 [40]. This cut-off score was used in this study 
to  categorize  family  caregivers  as  having  burden.  The 
scale had good internal consistency with Cronbach’s α of 
0.92.

Depressive and anxiety symptoms

Depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  was  assessed  by  the 
Hospital  Anxiety  and  Depression  Scale  (HADS)  [41]. 
The  HADS  is  a  14-item  scale  that  requires  respondents 
to endorse a verbal response which is scored as an index 
of the severity of anxiety or depression. The HADS ques-
tionnaire has seven items each for depression and anxiety 
subscales. Scoring of each item ranges from zero to three, 

Nasreen et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2024) 24:656  
Page 5 of 12

with  three  denoting  highest  anxiety  or  depression  level. 
The  Malay  version  of  HADS  showed  a  good  sensitivity 
(90.0%  for  anxiety  and  93.2%  for  depression)  and  speci-
ficity (86.2% for anxiety and 90.8% for depression) at the 
cut-off  score  of  8/9  [41].  Thus,  a  total  subscale  score  of 
> 8 points out of a possible 21 denote considerable symp-
toms of anxiety or depression. The scale presented good 
reliability in the study with Cronbach’s α of 0.84 for anxi-
ety and 0.78 for depression.

Quality of life

Quality of life was measured by the validated Malay ver-
sion  of  Control,  Autonomy,  Self-Realization,  and  Plea-
sure (CASP-19) scale [42]. The CASP-19 consists of four 
domains: four items focus on control domain, five items 
cover the autonomy domain, and five questions each on 
self-realization and pleasure domains. Each item is rated 
on a 4-point scale from never (0) to often (3), with a total 
score ranging from 0 to 57 where higher score indicates 
better quality of life. CASP-19 showed a good  reliability 
in the study with Cronbach’s α of 0.88.

Caregiving self-efficacy

The  Revised  Scale  for  Caregiving  Self-Efficacy  (RSCSE) 
was  used  to  measure  caregiving  self-efficacy  [43].  The 
RSCSE  is  a  15-item  scale  which  rates  caregivers’  beliefs 
about  their  ability  to  perform  caregiving  activities 
according  to  their  recent  situation  from  0  (cannot  do  it 
at  all)  to  100  (certain  they  can  do  it). The  scale  consists 
of  3  subscales  (5  items  per  subscale):  obtaining  respite 
(item 1 to 5), responding to disruptive patient behaviours 
(item  6  to  10),  and  controlling  upsetting  thoughts  (item 
11 to 15). The item scores within each subscale are aver-
aged  to  obtain  subscale  ratings  ranging  between  0  and 
100.  Higher  score  indicates  higher  confidence  in  self-
efficacy. The RSCSE has potential uses for both research 
and  clinical  purposes.  The  RSCSE  was  translated  from 
English to Bahasa Melayu and then back to English again 
by two bilingual public health researchers. The translated 
Malay version of the instrument was then pretested with 
the family caregivers of PWD (not included in the study) 
to  check  appropriateness  of  the  terminology  in  Bahasa 
Melayu. RSCSE demonstrated good internal consistency 
in the present study with the Cronbach’s α for subscales 
ranged from 0.86 to 0.94.

Data analysis

Descriptive  analyses  were  performed  to  report  partici-
pants’  background  characteristics,  caregiving  informa-
2 
tion  and  outcome  measures.  An  independent  t-test, 
test  and  Fisher’s  exact  two-sided  p  test  were  conducted 
to  compare  means  and  proportions  between  groups.  As 
the ZBI, HADS-depression and HADS-anxiety subscales 
had definitive cut-off points, we used these outcomes as 

X

dichotomous  and  multiple  logistic  regression  were  per-
formed  to  determine  their  associated  factors.  We  used 
multiple  linear  regression  (Backward  Method)  model  to 
assess  the  determinants  of  quality  of  life  and  caregiving 
self-efficacy. As the perceived social support and its three 
subscales  were  highly  multicollinear,  separate  models 
were run for each of them. A p value of < 0.05 was consid-
ered for statistical significance.

Results
Sample profile

Table  1  shows  the  mean  age  of  the  121  family  caregiv-
ers of PWD included in the study was 52 years, ranging 
from  23  years  to  85  years.  69%  of  the  family  caregivers 
were women and three-quarters were married. Although 
the mean years of schooling was 13, nearly half of them 
received tertiary level of education and were employed in 
private or public sectors. Approximately 56% of the par-
ticipants were from low-income level and 8% from high-
income  level  with  median  monthly  income  of  RM  4000 
(USD 1 = RM 4.5). About three-fourths of the caregivers 
were  in  non-spousal  relationship  and  the  majority  were 
PWD’s  own  children.  The  family  caregivers  had  been 
providing care for almost 47.9 months (≅ 4 years) spend-
ing about 19 h per day. The majority of PWD (63%) were 
women with the mean age of 75 years and 56% were able 
to take care of themselves (self-care). 60% of the caregiv-
ers  stated  that  they  received  support  from  other  family 
members in providing care for PWDs. The average scores 
were  59.3  for  perceived  social  support,  21.1  for  family 
support,  16.1  for  friend  support  and  21.7  for  significant 
other support.

Descriptives of the outcome measures
Of  the  121  caregivers,  84  had  ZBI  score  ≥22,  indicating 
that the point prevalence of caregiver burden was 69.4% 
(CI95% 59.5 − 79.3%) with a mean score of 41.8 (SD 14.5). 
Similarly,  the  point  prevalences  of  depressive  and  anxi-
ety  symptoms  were  32.2%  (CI95%  17.5  − 46.9%),  mean 
score10.9 (SD 2.3) and 36.4% (CI95% 34.3 − 38.5%), mean 
score 11.3 (SD 3.3), respectively. The mean score was 40.3 
(10.5)  for  quality  of  life  and  71.8  (28.9),  71.1  (23.8)  and 
76.8  (19.3)  on  the  three  subscales  of  caregiving  self-effi-
cacy (Table 2).

Determinants of the outcome measures

Table 3 reveals the adjusted odds ratio (OR) obtained in 
the multiple logistic regression models showed that fam-
ily caregivers were less likely to report caregiver burden, 
depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  if  they  were  married 
and if the PWDs were able to self-care. Those with higher 
perceived  social  support,  particularly  family  support 
were  also  less  likely  to  report  caregiver  burden,  depres-
sive  and  anxiety  symptoms.  Support  from  a  significant

depressive  symptoms  (Chi-square = 4.885,  p = 0.770)  and 
anxiety  symptoms  (Chi-square = 4 = 10.157,  p = 0.254) 
indicated that models fitted the data well.

Table 4 presents the adjusted linear regression models 
on  the  continuous  outcome  variables  showed  that  the 
higher the perceived social support including family sup-
port,  friend  support  and  significant  other  support,  the 
higher  the  quality  of  life  and  caregiving  self-efficacy  for 
obtaining respite among the family caregivers. However, 
friend  support  was  not  identified  as  a  determinant  for 
self-efficacy  for  responding  to  disruptive  patient  behav-
iors  and  self-efficacy  for  controlling  upsetting  thoughts 
about caregiving. In addition, family caregivers who were 
employed  and  identified  themselves  as  Muslim  were 
more  likely  to  report  better  quality  of  life.  Caregiving 
self-efficacy  for  responding  to  disruptive  patient  behav-
ior was more likely to be reported if the family caregivers 
were  married,  and  self-efficacy  for  controlling  upsetting 
thoughts  about  caregiving  if  PWDs  were  able  to  care 
for  themselves  (self-care).  Family  caregivers  who  were 
spouses and shared caregiving were more likely to report 
caregiving  self-efficacy  for  obtaining  respite  and  con-
trolling  upsetting  thoughts  about  caregiving.  Moreover, 
duration  of  care  was  negatively  associated  with  self-effi-
cacy for obtaining respite.

Discussion
The  current  study  examined  baseline  measures  of  a 
telephone-delivered  psychoeducational  intervention  for 
family  caregivers  to  PWD  in  Malaysia.  The  majority  of 
the family caregivers in this study were married [20] and 
women,  a  similar  pattern  to  that  reported  in  Asia  [44] 
and  other  parts  of  the  world  [45,  46].  Although  spouses 
are often reported to take on the primary role as caregiv-
ers  to  PWD  in  countries,  such  as  Shanghai,  China  [15] 
and  Australia  [20],  most  of  the  caregivers  in  this  study 
were  adult  children. The  majority  of  participants  shared

other was found to be significantly associated with care-

anxiety  symptoms.  Moreover,  family  caregivers  in  older 
age  and  with  longer  caregiving  duration  were  less  likely 
to  report  depressive  symptoms.  Hosmer  and  Lemeshow 
tests for caregiver burden (Chi-square = 4.386, p = 0.821),

Models were adjusted for caregiver’s age & years of study; PWD’s age & sex; duration of care; hours of care per day; and number of family

NB. Because of high multi-collinearity between the three subscales of multidimensional scale of perceived social support, independent model was run, and different 
R and R2 were reported for each of them

caregiving  responsibilities  with  other  family  members 
over  an  average  of  four  years.  This  timeframe  concurs 
with  similar  studies  from  e.g.  Argentina  [45],  United 
States of America [47], Canada [48], and Iran [5]. Where 
caregiving  became  a  shared  responsibility,  women  in 
mixed-gender sibling group, are shown to take the lead in 
caregiving [48].

In this study, the mean caregiving hours were on aver-
age 18 h per day. This figure exceeds data from European 
countries  with  a  mean  of  6  h/day  [49],  however,  in  line 
with a study from Malyasia 15 h caregiving was reported 
per  day  [50].  Family  caregivers  reported  in  the  current 
study  how  their  engagement  in  caregiving  extended 
beyond  caregiving  activities.  This  perspective  is  poten-
tially influenced by their cohabitation with the PWD and 
an  ongoing  sense  of  responsibility  throughout  the  day. 
This aligns with findings from an Austrian study, showing 
that family caregivers feel the need to be constantly avail-
able  and  on  guard  due  to  the  dependency  of  the  PWD 
[51].

In the current study, the prevalence of caregiver burden 
was  almost  70%  compared  to  a  meta-analysis  where  the 
prevalence ranged from 35.8 to 88.5% with a pooled prev-
alence  of  62.5%  [52].  The  mean  caregiver  burden  score 
of  32.9  in  this  study  mirrors  that  of  international  stud-
ies  using  the  ZBS,  with  scores  of:  30.7  in  Australia  [20], 

34.1–37.4  in  Hong  Kong,  China  [29]  and  lower  scores 
in India of 47.9 [44]. In this study, family caregivers who 
were married were less likely to experience burden pos-
sibly  due  to  support  from  their  spouses  in  caregiving 
responsibilities.  Family  caregivers  with  higher  perceived 
social  support,  particularly  from  family  and  significant 
others, were less likely to experience caregiver burden. A 
study from Nepal [53] suggested that the majority of fam-
ily caregivers (88%) in their study who experienced little 
to no caregiver burden was attributed to cultural factors 
such as filial piety and responsibilities (Khanal & Chalise, 
2020).  The  results  of  this  study  indicated  the  higher  the 
level of self-care among PWD the less likely family care-
givers reported burden of care. This has been attributed 
to  how  increasing  function  dependency  due  to  severity 
of dementia entails longer caregiving hours, thereby con-
tributing to greater caregiver burden [17].

In  this  study  the  prevalence  of  caregiver  depressive 
and  anxiety  symptoms  were  32%  and  36%,  respectively. 
Similar  findings  were  reported  by  Collins  and  Kishita 
[52]  with  informal  caregivers  had  a  pooled  prevalence 
of  depression  of  31%  and  a  32%  pooled  prevalence  of 
anxiety  [54].  Family  caregivers  were  less  likely  to  report 
depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  if,  they  were  married, 
if  the  PWD  was  able  to  care  for  self,  and  if  social  sup-
port was available, especially from family and significant

others. Finally, older family caregivers who provided care 
over  a  long  period  of  time  reported  less  symptoms.  An 
important  determinant  in  protecting  family  caregivers 
from  depression  and  anxiety,  in  an  Asian  population,  is 
the  caregiver´s  perceived  sense  of  control  over  the  situ-
ation  (also  known  as  mastery)  and  level  of  competence. 
These  factors  were  independently  associated  with  nega-
tive  outcomes  associated  with  caregiver  depression  and 
anxiety [55].

The  availability  and  accessibility  of  support  in  societ-
ies  with  mostly  family  caregivers  are  positively  related 
to  quality  of  life  [1].  Consistent  with  other  research  [2, 
56],  the  results  indicate  that  family  caregivers  reporting 
a higher social support network from e.g. family, friends 
and  significant  others  were  more  likely  to  report  better 
quality  of  life.  In  addition,  improved  quality  of  life  was 
more likely to be reported by family caregivers who were 
employed and identified themselves as Muslim. This can 
be explained by a perception of the importance of culture 
and belief as a family caregiver. As suggested in a review 
from China [57], family caregivers showed lower depres-
sive symptoms most likely due to the perception of fulfill-
ing society’s cultural requirements to take care of family 
members.

Similar to findings by Tan et al. [58], this study showed 
that  older  family  caregivers  were  likely  to  report  a  high 
sense  of  self-efficacy  in  terms  of  controlling  upsetting 
thoughts,  partly  due  to  their  life  experiences  and  age. 
This  might  partly  explain  why  spouses  of  PWD  were 
more likely to report high self-efficacy in terms of obtain-
ing  respite  and  controlling  negative  emotions,  in  com-
parison to their children, both in this study and Colloby 
et al. [59]. Familiarity of routines and aspects of relation-
ship may act as a buffer for some initial challenges experi-
enced by older family caregivers [59]. Both Tew et al. [60] 
and Tan et al. [58] mirror this study´s results, that care-
givers  living  with  the  care  recipient  demonstrate  lower 
levels  of  self-efficacy  than  others.  This  study  shows  that 
shared  caregiving  was  positively  associated  with  obtain-
ing respite and controlling upsetting thoughts. According 
to  Steffen  et  al.  [43]  increased  social  support,  enhances 
the likelihood that the family caregiver will find someone 
to care for the PWD if respite is needed. Participants in 
this  study  scored  notably  higher  mean  scores  (all  above 
71)  of  self-efficacy  in  all  three  domains  of  the  Revised 
Scale  For  Caregiving  Self-Efficacy;  Obtaining  Respite, 
Responding  to  Disruptive  Patient  Behaviors,  and  Con-
trolling  Upsetting  Thoughts,  compared  to  Steffen  et  al. 
[43]. Steffen, et al. [43] found that family caregivers with 
higher  perceived  social  support  reported  greater  care-
giver efficacy. This aligns with the Social Cognitive The-
ory  which  suggests  a  bidirectional  relationship  between 
perceived coping efficacy and social support [21].

The  current  study  has  used  locally  validated  instru-
ments to measure caregiver burden, depressive and anxi-
ety symptoms, and quality of life except for the caregiving 
self-efficacy. Translation and back translation were done 
on the RSCSE scale by two bi-lingual researchers, to help 
minimize  error  and  inconsistencies.  As  the  instrument 
has not been used in Malaysia before, the results should 
be  interpreted  with  caution.  The  ZBI  is  known  to  have 
a  high  rate  of  false  positive  as  the  detection  of  levels  of 
experienced burden can be impeded by respondent’s gen-
der and culture. However, higher sensitivity of 70.8% with 
a lower but reasonable specificity of 69.2% at the recom-
mended cut-off score in this study, indicated that a false 
negative rate is less desired than a false positive case [40]. 
Duration of caregiving per day were reported subjectively 
according  to  respondents’  perceptions  may  introduce 
bias through over-estimation. Although telephone inter-
views have been identified as cost-effective and time-effi-
cient, the greatest challenge with this type of interview is 
the loss of several communication cues, distractions, and 
technical difficulties. However, by allowing flexibility and 
breaking  the  interview  into  multiple  sessions  can  help 
overcome such challenges.

Conclusion
This  study  contributes  to  current  research  on  protec-
tive  factors  that  enhance  sustainable  support  for  family 
members  caring  for  a  PWD  in  Malaysia.  This  indicates 
a  necessity  of  implementing  a  psychoeducational  inter-
vention for the family caregivers to a PWD in the mem-
ory,  geriatric,  and  psychiatry  clinics  in  Malaysia.  Given 
the  time  and  efforts  associated  with  caring  for  PWDs, 
a  telephone  delivered  intervention  has  the  potential  to 
be  highly  accessible  for  the  family  caregivers.  Such  an 
intervention  needs  to  be  culturally  adopted  and  its  effi-
cacy  examined  in  reducing  psychosocial  burden  and 
improving  quality  of  life  and  caregiving  self-efficacy  in 
family caregivers of PWDs in Malaysia. Further research 
is  required  in  Asian  countries  to  gain  an  understanding 
of cultural and economic factors and gender roles when 
designing support programmes for family caregivers in a 
community setting.
