Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff

From hoarding to handwashing to forever checking the stove, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) takes many forms. It is ananxietydisorder that traps people in repetitive thoughts and behavioral rituals that can be completely disabling.

About2 percentof the population suffers from OCD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health—that's more than those who experience other mental illnesses like schizophrenia,bipolar disorder, and panic disorder. OCD might begin inchildhood, but it most often manifests duringadolescenceor early adulthood. Scientists believe that both a neurobiological predisposition and environmental factors jointly cause the unwanted, intrusive thoughts and thecompulsive behaviorpatterns that appease those unwanted thoughts.

The disorder tends to be chronic—lasting for years, even decades—although the severity of the symptoms may wax and wane over the years. Both pharmacological and behavioral approaches—particularly Exposure and Response Prevention—have proven to be effective treatments that allow people with OCD to lead happy and fulfilling lives.

## Signs and Symptoms


The first symptoms of OCD are obsessions—the unwanted ideas or impulses that occur over and over again and are meant to drive out fears, often of harm or contamination. "I will contract a deadly disease” or “My family will be harmed.”

Compulsions appear after that—repetitive behaviors such as handwashing, lock-checking, and hoarding. Such behaviors are intended to mitigatefearand reduce the threat of harm. But the effect does not last and the unwanted thoughts soon intrude all over again. People suffering from obsessive-compulsive habits may also contend with motor tics or repetitive movements, such as grimacing and jerking.

Sufferers may understand the uselessness of their obsessions and compulsions, but that is no protection against them. OCD can become so severe that it interferes with their work or relationships, or even keep them from leaving their home.

Obsessions and compulsions are the two centralfeatures of OCD,according to theDSM-5. Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that cause distress and that individual tries to suppress or counteract. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the individual performs in response to an obsession, with the goal of neutralizing the threat or alleviating distress. In addition, obsessions or compulsions must impair an aspect of daily functioning, be fairly time-consuming, and not be due to another mental health condition or substance use for a diagnosis.

A common misconception is that compulsions must be physical, such as trying out every seat on the train or touching your toes 20 times. But compulsions can also be performed mentally, such as repeating words or phrases, making mental lists of items, or continuously praying.Mental compulsions in OCDare just as distressing as physical compulsions. However, mental compulsions are by nature more hidden, so people who experience them may evade detection and go longer without finding help.

The obsessions and compulsions that characterizeOCD can center around different themes.Five common categories of obsessions include:

1. Fear of contamination (germs, viruses)

2. Fear of harm (unlocked doors, electrical outlets catching fire)

3. Excessive concern with order or symmetry (even picture frames, general neatness)

4. Obsessions with the body or physical symptoms (breathing, swallowing)

5. Unwanted, intrusive thoughts (going to hell, harming family members)

People suffering from OCD therefore carry out compulsions such as washing hands or checking locks because they believe those actions will stop those bad outcomes from happening.

People often say that they’re “so OCD,” as a sign of their preference for cleanliness, order, or perfection. But there are key differences, and the two shouldn’t be conflated. The essential distinction is thatOCD becomes a disorderwhen symptoms interfere or impair a person’s ability to function socially, professionally, or academically.

For example, someone with OCD might be chronically late for work, and maybe fired, if compulsions prevent them from leaving the house. In a family context, someone with OCD may avoid being home alone with their children, for fear that they will suddenly harm or kill their children.


## Causes and Risk Factors


OCD likely results from a confluence of factors—a biological predisposition, environmental factors including experiences and attitudes acquired inchildhood, and faulty thought patterns.

The fact that many OCD patients respond to SSRIantidepressantssuggests the involvement of dysfunction in the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Ongoing research suggests there may be a defect in other chemical messenger systems in the brain.

OCD may coexist withdepression, eating disorders, orattention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and it may be related to disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, and hypochondria, though the nature of the overlap is the subject of debate.

The beginning of obsessions and compulsions inOCD can often be traced to a stressful event or life changethat led to greater responsibilities, such as a new job, the birth of a child, or evenpuberty. These events can inflate the person’s sense of responsibility, generatinganxietyand a desire to ensure that they don’t let themselves and others down by allowing bad things to happen. Case studies show that compulsions sometimes disappear in a hospital or lab setting, as the patient feels the burden of responsibility has been transferred to others.

One region thought toplay a role in OCD is the basal ganglia,a collection of structures underneath the cortex that help coordinate movement; when the basal ganglia malfunctions, unwanted, involuntary movements can result.

In addition to the motor cortex, the basal ganglia also communicates with the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in planning, thinking, and awareness, so the basal ganglia may play a part in facilitating wanted thoughts and stopping unwanted thoughts. As evidence for this idea, brain activity in the cortex and basal ganglia is different in OCD and typical individuals, and stimulating part of the basal ganglia can reduce symptoms of OCD.

Infection sometimes plays a role inpsychiatricillnesses, and research suggests that rare cases of OCD can be traced back to complications from an infection of strep throat. Psychiatric symptoms resulted after the infection, perhaps triggered by the child’s immune response, such as intrusive thoughts or impulses and the inability to abandoncompulsive behaviors. This suggests that thisrare route for OCD is transmissible.

It’s possible that the pandemic may have triggered OCD for some already predisposed, but overallCOVID-19 has not created an “epidemic of OCD.”A key distinction is that the fear of contracting or transmitting COVID-19 is genuine cause for concern, whereas the intrusive thoughts characteristic of the disorder are not. In most cases, extra hand-washing and sanitizing also hasn’t led to impairment or dysfunction in daily life.By contrast, someone with OCDmight begin to wash their hands so many times that they become raw or bloody.


## Treatment and Recovery


Eitherpsychotherapyormedication, or both, may be prescribed for OCD, and research suggests that a combination of the two is often the most successful approach, especially for young people.

These drugs are typically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). The SSRIs fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and paroxetine (Paxil) have been specifically approved to treat OCD. These drugs have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of obsessions and compulsions in more than half of patients, although discontinuation of drugs often leads to relapse.

Behavioral therapy for OCD such as Exposure and Response Prevention tends to produce long-lasting effects. Psychotherapy generally focuses on two aspects of the disorder: unraveling the irrational thoughts involved in the condition and gradually exposing sufferers to the feared object or idea until they are desensitized to it and can tolerate anxiety without engaging in compulsive rituals.

If a loved one is suffering from OCD, there are a few important steps to take—and a few important steps to avoid. Do not help the person carry out compulsions even if it seems reassuring, and do not tell them to “just stop it” or suggest that they’re lazy or lackwillpower—these are a few of themyths about OCD.Instead, research the condition and recognize thatOCD is treatable with therapy and medication, and there are secondary options if the first attempt at treatment isn’t effective. You can then gently but firmly begin a discussion about seeking help.

Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a frontline treatment for OCD.ERP is a form ofcognitive behavioraltherapy, and it involves safely exposing the patient to the feared stimuli (exposure) and preventing the typical ritual they would perform in response (response prevention).

For example, if a patient has obsessions about contamination leading him to contract a deadly illness, the therapist might help him touch a sink, door handle, or floor, and then have him eat lunch without being allowed to wash his hands. Although this is anxiety-inducing at first, it helps the patient learn that their fear will not materialize.

Two models propose why ERP is effective. Thehabituation modelproposes that getting used to the feared stimulus changes behaviors, which in turn changes beliefs, which in turn alters the emotions involved. Theinhibitory learning modelsuggests that the connection hasn’t been broken, but that patients develop cognitive and emotional flexibility around what the outcome can be in the presence of the feared stimulus.

Simply trying to suppress distressing thoughts doesn’t work. In a well-known experiment, psychologist Daniel Wegner asked study participants not to think about white bears—and naturally white bears were all they could think about.

Instead, a few cognitive techniques can help toovercome obsessive thoughts in OCD.One is to prove that thoughts don’t control reality by exposing yourself (or your thoughts) to your fear, which is a component of exposure therapy for OCD. Exposure and Response Prevention. Another is to “float” your obsession; instead of trying to get rid of it, envision it floating down a river and becoming smaller as you focus on your breathing.

Early diagnosis and treatment can, in some cases, lead to a full recovery.While obsessions and compulsionsdo not completely disappearfor many others, treatment still allows them to lead a fulfilling life. And having realistic expectations for recovery can help; people whoexpect to fully abolish their OCDmay be disappointed with their clinician, themselves, and life. But people who have the expectation that “OCD will occupy a smaller part of my life” or that “It will bother me sometimes, but I’ll have the skills to handle it” set themselves up to be happier and more satisfied.

Like all other aspects of life, thepandemic has upended treatment for OCD,because Exposure and Response Prevention, the gold-standard of treatment, is an interactive and hands-on form of therapy. As a result, therapists have shifted their approach. They may have changed patients’ exposure plans based on which actions are due to the pandemic and which are not, focused on how the patient is spending their time to avoid expanding the time allotted to obsessions and compulsions, and explored prescribing medication when appropriate.

A lapse in OCD, the brief or partial return of symptoms like compulsive behaviors, can be due tostress, life transitions, or new environments that evoke an obsession. But lapses don’t have to lead to a full relapse. To avoidrelapses, people can identify what triggered the setback and develop a plan to navigate that situation in the future. Continuing to practice CBT and/or ERP is key to maintaining recovery as well.
