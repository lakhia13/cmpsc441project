Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in global physical distancing restrictions and lockdown 
orders. Despite the clear documentation of increased mental distress amongst adult populations during 
the pandemic, there is limited evidence about the mental health challenges of people in the perinatal 
period (pregnancy, birth and postpartum). The aim of this review is to summarise the qualitative research 
about women’s lived experience and emotional wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Methods:  A comprehensive search strategy was developed. Twenty peer-reviewed qualitative research 
articles published in English from January 1, 2020, to December 15, 2021, were included. Data synthesis 
outlined the evidence from common themes in a narrative format. 
Results:  Themes during pregnancy included: (1) information seeking: anxiety and fear; (2) experiencing 
isolation and disruptions to my social support; (3) ‘Going it alone’ in pregnancy care; (4) anticipatory 
grieving and despair; (5) ﬁnding ‘silver linings’ in social restrictions. One key theme during birth was 
“birthing in a crisis”. Themes during postpartum included: (1) isolating ‘Early motherhood is much like 
lockdown’; (2) breastfeeding: triumphs and tribulations; (3) facing disruptions during postpartum care; 
(4) ’Affecting us for years to come’ - COVID-19 was not the only trauma; (5) ‘silver linings’ during post- 
partum care. 
Conclusions:  This review provides important insights into how experiences of isolation, decreased social 
support and adaptions to maternity services affect women’s mental health. Maternity services should 
consider how perinatal mental health support may be integrated into the care of women who may still 
be required to isolate or have reduced visitors during their perinatal care. 

Statement of signiﬁcance 

The restrictions and disruptions to maternity care due to the COVID-19 pandemic were likely to impact 
the mental health of women in the perinatal period (pregnancy, birth and postpartum). What is already 
known is that public health measures due to COVID-19 increased the prevalence of common perinatal 
mental disorders (CPMDs) and exacerbated common risk factors for CPMDs (i.e., poor social support). 
What this paper adds: The qualitative research with women in the perinatal period during the pandemic 
provides unique insights into how these events impacted perinatal mental and emotional health. In par- 
ticular, the ways that global physical distancing measures and maternity care adaptations contributed to 
women’s feelings of distress, isolation, and depression/despair. Silver linings such as more uninterrupted 
time with immediate family were also identiﬁed.

Introduction 

The context of the COVID-19 pandemic 

Global physical distancing restrictions (e.g., lockdowns) imple- 
mented during the COVID-19 pandemic ( World Health Organiza- 
tion,  2022 )  have  led  to  mental  distress  within  general  popula- 
tions,  patients  with  COVID-19  infections,  and  health  profession- 
als  ( Wang  et  al.,  2020 ;  Xiang  et  al.,  2020 ;  Slama  et  al.,  2021 ), 
and  created  unprecedented  challenges  for  most  healthcare  sys- 
tems ( Keil et al., 2022 ). A co-ordinated analysis of eleven longi- 
tudinal  studies  in  the  United  Kingdom  reported  a  sustained  de- 
cline  in  mental  health  throughout  the  pandemic  (during  strict 
lockdowns and when restrictions eased), and women experienced 
much  higher  distress  levels  and  a  more  severe  deterioration  in 
mental  health  than  men  ( Patel  et  al.,  2022 ).  In  Australia,  health 
problems  in  the  adult  population  (depression,  generalised  anxi- 
ety, and thoughts of being “better off dead”) were at least twice 
as  prevalent  in  the  ﬁrst  month  of  the  pandemic  than  in  non- 
pandemic times ( Fisher et al., 2020 ). Despite the clear documenta- 
tion of increased mental distress amongst adult populations during 
the pandemic, there is limited evidence about the mental health 
challenges of women in the perinatal period (pregnancy, birth and 
postpartum). 

CPMDs 

The term “common perinatal mental disorders” (CPMDs) refers 
to non-psychotic mental disorders such as anxiety and depression 
when experienced throughout pregnancy and the ﬁrst year post- 
partum ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). In the early stages of the COVID-19 
pandemic, two online surveys reported the prevalence of antena- 
tal depression as 44% in China ( n = 19,515) ( Yang et al., 2021 ) and 
37% in Canada ( n = 1987) ( Lebel et al., 2020 ). The available evi- 
dence suggests that the prevalence of postpartum depression in- 
creased globally, with a pooled prevalence estimate of 34% (95%CI 
21–46%) ( Chen et al., 2022 ). In Brazil, the prevalence of postpartum 
depression rose from 3.1% in 2019 to 28.4% during the ﬁrst wave of 
the pandemic (May-July 2020), and 30.6% during the second wave 
(July-December 2020) ( Loret de Mola et al., 2021 ). In Canada, ma- 
ternal  depression  and  anxiety  rose  from  14-19%  and  12–28%  re- 
spectively pre-pandemic to 35% (depression) and 31% (anxiety) in 
May-July 2020 ( Racine et al., 2021 ). Overall, such evidence indi- 
cates a signiﬁcant international increase in the prevalence of CP- 
MDs since the pandemic begun. 

CPMDs and disruption to maternity services 

Most countries implemented some level of restrictions on ma- 
ternity  services  during  the  pandemic,  including  replacing  face- 
to-face  appointments  with  online  or  telehealth  services,  visitor 
limits  in  antenatal  clinics  and  birthing  suites,  reduced  choices 
for  childbirth  and  changes  to  continuity  of  care  ( Flaherty  et  al., 
2022 ). These necessary measures for mitigating the transmission 
of COVID-19 disrupted mothers’ usual support during the perina- 
tal period ( Matsushima and Horiguchi, 2020 ; Tsuno et al., 2022 ; 
Bottemanne et al., 2022 ). In addition to the reduction of antena- 
tal  and  postnatal  services,  women  also  chose  to  opt  out  of  reg- 
ular antenatal appointments due to limited transport, fear of be- 
ing infected by the virus, and to adhere to lockdown regulations 
( Motrico et al., 2020 ). Delayed antenatal care may result in preg- 
nancy complications and negative birth outcomes, which are often 
associated with CPMDs ( Fisher et al., 2012 ). 

What this scoping review adds 

A  growing  collection  of  quantitative  research  (generally  de- 
rived from online surveys and summarised above) has outlined the 

Midwifery 123 (2023) 103706 

impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  prevalence  of  CPMDs 
( Yang et al., 2021 ; Lebel et al., 2020 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Loret de 
Mola et al., 2021 ; Racine et al., 2021 ). Qualitative ﬁndings can ex- 
tend understanding as to why the prevalence of CMPDs increased 
during  the  pandemic  and  convey  rich  insights  into  the  personal 
impact  of  COVID-19  on  women’s  emotional  wellbeing.  To  date, 
there has been no systematic synthesis of the qualitative research 
exploring  the  mental  and  emotional  wellbeing  of  women  in  the 
perinatal period during the ﬁrst two  years of  the COVID19 pan- 
demic. This scoping review aims to summarise qualitative research 
on how women described the emotional impact of living through 
the COVID-19 pandemic whilst pregnant, birthing, or postpartum. 

Methods 

A comprehensive search strategy was developed in collabora- 
tion  with  a  university  subject  librarian  to  ﬁnd  relevant  sources 
for  the  scoping  review.  Two  sets  of  keywords  were  identiﬁed 
( Appendix 1 ), and used for a database search of Scopus, Discover 
and  Web  of  Science  covering  Medline/Pubmed/EMBASE/CINAHL/ 
PsychInfo. Literature published in English from January 1, 2020, to 
December 15, 2021, were included. Search results were assessed for 
inclusion ( Fig. 1 ). A hand search of reference lists from published 
studies  found  through  the  database  search  was  undertaken,  and 
additional  systematic,  rapid,  and  scoping  reviews  were  checked 
for additional articles for inclusion. Publications within the above 
timeframe from two major journals: Women and Birth, and Mid- 
wifery , were both manually searched. 

Inclusion and exclusion criteria 

Inclusion criteria was based on the populations, concepts, and 
contexts (PCC) outlined in Table 1 . Only peer-reviewed qualitative 
research  articles  were  included.  Research  with  a  mixed  method 
design (e.g., online survey containing open-ended questions) was 
excluded, as there was an insuﬃcient amount of qualitative data 
available from open-ended questions. 

Three steps were involved in selecting sources: 

1. Article Screening: Two authors independently screened all titles 
and abstracts to determine eligibility based on the inclusion cri- 
teria. The titles were labelled with “included” “maybe” or “ex- 
cluded”. The authors then met and discussed articles labelled 
as “maybe” and reached consensus on whether they met the 
inclusion criteria ( Appendix 2 ). 

2. Critical  Appraisal:  A  formal  critical  appraisal  of  the  quality  of 
each included article was performed using the 2019 CASP qual- 
itative research checklist ( Noyes et al., 2018 ). Each article was 
assessed  as  to  whether  the  qualitative  methodology  was  ap- 
propriate;  whether  the  recruitment  strategy  and  data  collec- 
tion  addressed  the  research  questions;  whether  data  analy- 
sis was suﬃciently rigorous, whether interpretation of ﬁndings 
and  discussions  were  suﬃciently  explicit.  A  summary  of  the 
CASP  checklist  results  for  each  selected  article  is  included  in 
Appendix 2 .  The detailed selection process is  outlined in the 
PRISMA diagram ( Fig. 1 ). 

Data synthesis 

Data was synthesised based upon the ﬁndings sections and raw 
quotes included in published articles. Data were grouped by stage 
in  the  perinatal  journey  (pregnancy,  birth,  postpartum).  If  stud- 
ies  included  data  from  across  the  perinatal  period,  the  ﬁndings 
were separated according to stage and included in the synthesis 
as appropriate. The aim of data synthesis was to outline the evi- 
dence from common themes for each perinatal stage in a narrative 
format ( Tricco et al., 2018 ). As we were working with qualitative

ﬁndings, the intention was not to pool or synthesise “counts” of 
the results of included sources (e.g. stating how many times a par- 
ticular word or theme occurred) ( Peters et al., 2020 ). Rather, the 
analysis involved basic description of the ﬁndings of included stud- 
ies, as “utilizing a thematic or meta-aggregative approach is not 
within the remit of a scoping review” ( Peters et al., 2020 , p.2125). 

Findings 

Characteristics of included articles ( Appendix 3 ) 

Twelve  studies  explored  pregnant  women’s  experiences 
throughout  the  pandemic.  Nine  studies  collected  their  data  be- 
tween early and mid-2020, three collected data between October 
2020 to April 2021. Four studies were from Australia ( Atmuri et al., 

2021 ;  Sweet  et  al.,  2021a ,  2021b ;  Chivers  et  al.,  2020 ),  three 
studies  were  from  the  UK  ( Anderson  et  al.,  2021 ;  John  et  al., 
2021 ; Riley et al., 2021 ), two from Brazil ( Freitas-Jesus et al., 2021 ; 
Rossetto et al., 2021 ), the rest were from Ireland ( Keating et al., 
2021 ), Sweden ( Linden et al., 2021 ), and Turkey ( Mizrak Sahin and 
Kabakci, 2020 ). 

Three  studies  documented  the  experiences  of  women  giving 
birth throughout the pandemic ( Fumagalli et al., 2021 ; Goyal et al., 
2022 ; Silverio et al., 2021 ). Of these studies, two collected data be- 
tween early and mid-2020 ( Fumagalli et al., 2021 ; Silverio et al., 
2021 )  and  one  study  collected  data  between  August  2020  and 
January  2021  ( Goyal  et  al.,  2022 ).  One  study  was  from  North- 
ern  Italy  ( Fumagalli  et  al.,  2021 ),  one  from  the  UK  (London) 
( Silverio et al., 2021 ) and one recruited Asian American women in 
the US ( Goyal et al., 2022 ). 

Eleven  studies  reported  lived  experience  described  by  post- 
partum women throughout the pandemic. Nine studies collected 
data  during  early  and  mid-2020,  and  two  studies  collected  data 
between  October  2020  to  February  2021  ( John  et  al.,  2021 ; 
McKay  et  al.,  2021 ).  Five studies were from  the  UK  ( John et  al., 
2021 ; Riley et al., 2021 ; Silverio et al., 2021 ; Jackson et al., 2021a , 
2021b ), two from Australia ( Sweet et al., 2021a , 2021b ), two from 
Ireland  ( Keating  et  al.,  2021 ;  Panda  et  al.,  2021 ),  and  one  from 
Canada ( Ollivier et al., 2021 ), one study collected data from Twitter 
accounts ( McKay et al., 2021 ).

Pregnancy 

Information seeking: anxiety and fear 

The ‘infodemic’ (an over-abundance of information and tragic 
news on COVID-19) in mainstream and social media was a source 
of  fear  and  anxiety  for  pregnant  women.  Inconsistent  informa- 
tion about what being “at risk” meant for pregnant women and 
their  foetuses  ampliﬁed  feelings  of  uncertainty  and  insecurity 
( Atmuri  et  al.,  2021 ).  All  included  studies  found  that  pregnant 
women experienced distress when trying to appraise information 
about COVID-19. Mizrak Sahin and Rossetto described “fear of the 
unknown” ( Mizrak Sahin and Kabakci, 2020 , p.164) and women’s 
struggles to keep up with rapid changes in information ( Rossetto 
et al., 2021 ). “we were so scared whether we heard it on social me- 
dia or on television and talking to friends, you know, everyone was 
spreading all this hearsay nonsense information…” ( Mizrak Sahin and 
Kabakci, 2020 , p.165). One Australian participant stated: “you’ve got 
to decipher through what’s true and what’s not…Is that actually hav- 
ing a positive inﬂuence on me, and my mental…health” ( Sweet et al., 
2021a , p.4). Participants reported diﬃculties trying not to be con- 
stantly worried about COVID-19, and the “infodemic” compounded 
existing  worries  about  managing  their  pregnancy  ( Atmuri  et  al., 
2021 ; Chivers et al., 2020 ; Freitas-Jesus et al., 2021 ; Linden et al., 
2021 ; Mizrak Sahin and Kabakci, 2020 ). “A “fear of the unknown…
was the worst, hard enough, just in normal life, let alone being preg- 
nant ” ( Riley et al., 2021 , p.3). 

Experiencing isolation and disruptions to my social support 

In Anderson et al. (2021) study, women reported feeling “low ”, 
and suffering a loss of joy when isolating at home, and this was 
particularly acute if they were living alone or fully ‘shielding’ (stay- 
ing at home during their pregnancy) ( Anderson et al., 2021 ). Re- 
duced visitors and a loss of social support exacerbated a sense of 
“aloneness”, and the mental health of women in socially vulner- 
able  environments  was  disproportionately  affected  ( Sweet  et  al., 
2021a ;  Linden  et  al.,  2021 ).  One  participant  in  Sweden  reported 
“I  was  locked  up  during  my  pregnancy… you  do  not  get  support 
from the family either [makes] you feel isolated, and you feel like ‘I 
have  no  friends,  we  have  nothing,  how  are  we  going  to  cope  with 
this’…”( Linden et al., 2021 , p.4). 

Participants viewed pregnancy as a time when women would 
normally  seek  out  connection  with  others  (friends/family/other 
pregnant women), therefore reduced social contact was acutely felt 
as a loss ( Anderson et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, women attributed 
their isolation to symptoms of depression: “I hope I won’t be go- 
ing  through  with  depression  because  of  less  people  around.  Some- 
times  you just need family support  or even a friend’s support, just 
to help you out a little bit.” ( Atmuri et al., 2021 , p.5). Women from 
Brazil and the UK reported a range of ambiguous feelings: in some 
ways, women felt loved and supported by friends and networks 
such as church, who kept connection despite the restrictions (i.e., 
via  meal  drops);  while  unanticipated  conﬂicts  with  friends  and 
family  members  over  interpretations  of  physical  distancing  rules 
also arose, which sometimes led to estrangement after restrictions 
eased ( Chivers et al., 2020 ; Anderson et al., 2021 ). 

‘Going it alone’ during pregnancy care 

In many settings globally, women had to attend antenatal ser- 
vices alone, via telehealth, or had reduced appointments. This in- 
tensiﬁed  women’s  feelings  that  they  had  to  go  through  a  life- 
altering experience alone ( Linden et al., 2021 ). Women valued the 
companionship of a partner or support person in antenatal visits. 
Attending alone meant they were not able to share joyful events 
such as routine ultrasounds. Conversely, participants worried they 
would  be  alone  if  they  received  bad  news  ( Atmuri  et  al.,  2021 ; 
Sweet et al., 2021a ). “I just felt quite alone, I’m sitting in this hos- 

Midwifery 123 (2023) 103706 

pital waiting to make sure that my baby’s okay, and I have nobody to 
support me ” ( Sweet et al., 2021a , p.2). 

Anticipatory grieving and despair 

Feelings of anticipatory grief (sadness, anger and a sense of loss 
related to a future event) and despair about missing out on shar- 
ing important life milestones (pregnancy and birth) were described 
in many of the studies ( Atmuri et al., 2021 ; Chivers et al., 2020 ; 
Linden et al., 2021 ; Mizrak Sahin and Kabakci, 2020 ). One Turkish 
participant expressed: “I am alone now, and there will be no one 
at  [the]  birth.  My  mother  would  support  me  but  she  stayed  there 
in  Istanbul” ( Mizrak  Sahin  and  Kabakci,  2020 ,  p.167).  Grief  was 
also connected to disruption of the “normal” pregnancy experience 
and the loss of opportunity for bonding rituals they had expected 
around pregnancy and birth. Participants struggled with the fact 
that their pregnancies would not be experienced by their extended 
family in the way they had hoped ( Linden et al., 2021 ). “I don’t 
think many people have even seen me showing…you miss all that part 
of pregnancy a bit because were locked down” ( Atmuri et al., 2021 , 
p.5). 

Finding ‘silver linings’ in social restrictions 

As  well  as  the  negative  consequences  of  lockdown  restric- 
tions on perinatal mental health, some “silver linings” were sup- 
ported. In the UK and Ireland some women reported more time 
to rest, and had their partners at home due to social restrictions 
( Atmuri et al., 2021 ; Keating et al., 2021 ). This allowed them to 
enjoy their pregnancy and be closer to family members in a way 
they may not have otherwise and gave them time to reﬂect on the 
future and their family values ( Rossetto et al., 2021 , p.4). “My fam- 
ily is united and our bonds have grown stronger”. Asian American 
women described partners being home and more available: “It was 
kind of nice because my husband was able to work from home…at 
the very end of my pregnancy. …I ﬁgured when I go into labour, he’ll 
be there .” ( Goyal et al., 2022 , p.4). 

Birth 

Birthing in a crisis 

In many global settings partners or support people were un- 
able  to  attend  births  due  to  infection  control  measures.  Hence 
women experienced an unexpected perinatal journey with feelings 
of sadness and disappointment, or a birth experience unrelatable 
to previous births ( Goyal et al., 2022 ). Silverio et al. (2021) noted 
labour and birth preferences and plans had to be changed, with 
intrapartum care services being reconﬁgured constantly through- 
out  the  pandemic.  Whilst  this  was  communicated  well  to  some 
women, others experienced uncertainty or did not feel supported 
when they accessed birthing care: “There was a deﬁnite ‘this is a 
crisis, take the choices you have on the table, don’t complain about 
it’, attitude .” ( Silverio et al., 2021 , p.5). Coping with unmet expec- 
tations, dealing with chaos and uncertainty, and family separation 
and reuniﬁcation were common themes within women’s birth ex- 
periences. “I arrived at the emergency department, and I had to say 
goodbye to my husband and go in on my own…He saw her (baby) 
only on video ” ( Fumagalli et al., 2021 , p.7). One woman recounted 
“Look, ‘I’m getting really panicky; I need to…speak to my husband. I 
need to go outside’ and she (the midwife) had to go out and ask…a 
senior midwife is it alright if she goes out for 20 min to the car park. 
And I was a bit like ‘hang on, I’m not a prisoner .” ( Silverio et al., 
2021 , p.6). Pre-pandemic, it was well established that women’s sat- 
isfaction with their birth experience is impacted by feelings of be- 
ing in control, and the words and actions of their caregivers (usu- 
ally doctors and nurses) ( Simkin, 1991 ) . The quotes from our re- 
view illustrate how the context of giving birth during the COVID- 
19 pandemic dramatically impacted women’s feelings of being in 

4

control during their birth and changed the nature of their inter- 
actions with caregivers. The described feelings of uncertainty and 
more  limited/regulated  experiences  of  care  exacerbated  negative 
feelings about their birth experience.

Isolating: ‘Early motherhood is much like lockdown’ 

Participants  in  the  UK  expressed  how  early  motherhood  was 
“much  like  lockdown” and  was  accompanied  by  a  similar  feel- 
ing  of  loss  of  self-identity,  and  restrictions  to  independence 
( Jackson et al., 2021a , 2021b ). “Being in lockdown is exactly like be- 
ing a, being a new mum to a new-born and how it was…. a dou- 
ble whammy of like restriction on life ( Jackson et al., 2021a , p.6).”
Having less access to others to guide them through early mother- 
hood added to women’s feelings of isolation ( Ollivier et al., 2021 ). 
“I  think  week  two  to  four  was  peak  tiredness….  that’s  the  point 
where  I’d  really  loved  either  my  mum,  my  mother-in-law,  or  my 
own family to sort of step in and be able to help out a bit more ”
( Jackson et al., 2021b , p.4) . Similar to other perinatal stages, such 
isolation was mixed with a sense of grief over not sharing a life 
milestone with others ( Jackson et al., 2021b ; Ollivier et al., 2021 ). 
“My family is missing all of her milestones…I don’t have anyone to 
share  the  little  joys  with  like  her  ﬁrst  taste  of  a  new  food  or  the 
ﬁrst  time  she  rolls  over.  It’s  heart  breaking .” ( Ollivier  et  al.,  2021 , 
p.4). Olivier et al. (2021) found that new mothers in Canada had 
constant worries about their mental health. Participants felt “de- 
pressed, abandoned, lost, drained, irritable, sad, angry and anxious ”
and such feelings were attributed to the accumulating nature of 
stressors relating to the pandemic: “My mental health is okay but 
not great, everyday feels like a struggle, my postpartum anxiety has 
come back full blown…” ( Ollivier et al., 2021 , p.3). 

Breastfeeding: triumphs and tribulations 

Accessing  breastfeeding  services,  which  had  often  gone  on- 
line,  was  seen  as  daunting  and  frustrating  ( Panda  et  al.,  2021 ). 
Women described being sent breastfeeding booklets and links to 
websites,  but  not  all  women  had  adequate  access  to  the  inter- 
net.  Riley  et  al.  (2021)  reported  the  struggle  for  women  to  ob- 
tain breastfeeding support upon returning home. Breastfeeding ser- 
vices  attempted  to  support  new  mothers  in  other  ways  through 
“zoom calls ”, but “having someone look at it through a camera… just 
didn’t  cut  it ” ( Riley  et  al.,  2021 ,  p.4).  “Especially  with  breastfeed- 
ing, there’s nothing better than someone saying, ‘let me show you’ ….”
( Jackson  et  al.,  2021b ,  p.8).  Whilst  some  online  support  was  of- 
fered, the response was mixed: “The lactation consultant…is more 
important  with  COVID.  Because  you  don’t  have  your  mum  or  your 
granny…around you…to…help and correct you, you’re on your own. 
It’s hard to…zoom…with private lactation consultants ” ( Panda et al., 
2021 , p.4). 

Facing disruptions during postpartum care 

Globally, participants reported feeling that they and their ba- 
bies had ‘ slipped through the net ’ in terms of lack of access to post- 
partum support ( Jackson et al., 2021a ; Ollivier et al., 2021 ). Cana- 
dian participants used the term “dumped ” to signify the end of a 
signiﬁcant trusted relationship that should be reliable, consistent, 
and available. Without consistent valued support from health care 
providers,  mothers  felt  forgotten,  abandoned,  and  vulnerable.  In 
addition, a study involving ﬁrst-generation immigrants to Scotland 
stated they had experienced accent bias due to having non-British 
accents, and this was exacerbated when health services pivoted to 
telephone consultations ( John et al., 2021 ). Whilst all but one par- 
ticipant could speak English ﬂuently, they noted that language bar- 
riers occurred between themselves and health professionals, which

( John et al., 2021 ). 

‘Affecting us for years to come’ - COVID-19 was not the only trauma 

Additional visiting restrictions in hospitals affected how much 
women could see their preterm or hospitalised newborns. Whilst 
the  reasoning  for  restrictions  were  understood,  such  restrictions 
heightened rather than alleviated the distress parents felt at be- 
ing separated from their infants ( Keating et al., 2021 ; McKay et al., 
2021 ). “Parents of sick and small newborns must not be treated as 
visitors,  they  are  #caregivers  and  must  have  unrestricted  access  to 
#NICU ” ( McKay et al., 2021 , p.6). Women tweeted about how their 
mental health had suffered, and that their diﬃculties taking care 
of premature babies were compounded by the fear of them con- 
tracting COVID-19, stating that “COVID-19 was not the only trauma ”
( McKay  et  al.,  2021 ,  p.4).  Participants  in  the  UK  and  Ireland  re- 
ported  loneliness  after  their  birth  as  partners  and  family  could 
not  bond  with  their  baby  in  the  ﬁrst  days  of  life  ( Riley  et  al., 
2021 ;  Panda  et  al.,  2021 ).  “You  just  expect  to  be  all  excited  with 
your  partner  and  have  your  family  come  and  visit,  as  if  being  in 
hospital…wasn’t  bad  enough,  but  to  be  stuck  there  [by]  yourself ”
( Riley et al., 2021 , p.4). In Riley’s study, this led some participants 
to discharge themselves early rather than waiting until breastfeed- 
ing was established. 

‘Silver linings’ during postpartum care 

A “silver lining” of social distancing regulations were that new 
mothers  were  freed  from  social  obligations  and  had  more  sup- 
port  from  partners  who  were  based  at  home.  “We  can  literally 
adapt our lives around the baby’s schedule…. without worrying about 
“oh  I’m  getting  up  for  work ” ( Jackson  et  al.,  2021a ,  p.7).  Parents 
appreciated  being  able  to  settle  into  their  role  without  distrac- 
tion or social pressures ( Keating et al., 2021 ; Panda et al., 2021 ). 
“The whole experience of not having…gangs of…. visitors coming in 
and  out…it  was  just  so  pleasant .” ( Panda  et  al.,  2021 ,  p.6).  Par- 
ticipants  came  up  with  creative  solutions  to  promote  their  own 
mental health and opportunities for socialisation e.g., online sup- 
port groups ( Ollivier et al., 2021 ), virtual technologies were widely 
used to make memories and celebrate babies’ milestones. During 
the postnatal hospital stay women drew comfort and support from 
each other both emotionally and practically due to restricting visi- 
tors ( Panda et al., 2021 ). 

Discussion 

The studies included in this review highlight women’s own de- 
scriptions of how living through the nexus of the pandemic and 
the  perinatal  period  affected  their  emotions  and  mental  health 
( Table 2 ). As such, important insights about the situations that in- 
creased women’s mental distress or promoted mental health can 

5

be identiﬁed. In qualitative studies, diagnostic categories for com- 
mon  perinatal  mental  disorders  (CPMDs)  are  not  foregrounded, 
and  summaries  of  prevalence  studies  relating  to  CPMDs  during 
the  pandemic  are  available  elsewhere  (see  Iyengar  et  al.,  2021 ; 
Hessami et al., 2022 ). 

Isolation and limited support 

Internationally, women described experiences of isolation, fear, 
and  anxiety  throughout  their  pregnancy,  birth  and  postpartum. 
Lockdown orders and the re-orienting of many maternity services 
to online/telehealth resulted in the reduction or denial of physical, 
psychological, and social support that many women were expect- 
ing ( Anderson et al., 2021 ; Sweet et al., 2021b ; Linden et al., 2021 ). 
Some studies in this review conceptualised this as an exacerbation 
of the feelings of loneliness and isolation that many new moth- 
ers  routinely  describe  ( Jackson  et  al.,  2021a ,  2021b ).  Loneliness 
has  been  identiﬁed  as  a  sensitive  indicator  of  mental  wellbeing 
in  studies  from  pre-pandemic  times  ( Kent-Marvick  et  al.,  2022 ). 
Given  the  strong  evidence  that  social  support  in  pregnancy  and 
postpartum is protective against depression, anxiety and self-harm 
( Bedaso et al., 2021 ; Milgrom et al., 2019 ), the impact of increased 
isolation during the perinatal period is a serious issue to consider. 

Adaptation of maternity services 

When accessing maternity services, in addition to being alone, 
inconsistent  information  made  women  unsure  if  attending  such 
services put them at risk of infection ( Anderson et al., 2021 ). Fre- 
quently used words by women in one study included: worrying, 
risk, anxiety, concerns, stress, struggling and scared ( Chivers et al., 
2020 ). The ﬁnding that pregnant women experienced heightened 
feelings of  distress  during the  early  stages of  the  pandemic due 
to the perception that external environments (e.g., maternity ser- 
vices)  were  now  higher  risk  is  important  in  terms  of  how  ac- 
cess to care impacts women’s mental health. This echoes the re- 
ported ﬁndings from quantitative studies that service adaptations 
burdened  the  emotional  wellbeing  of  women  during  their  peri- 
natal period ( Ceulemans et al., 2020 ; Zanardo et al., 2020 ). Mov- 
ing to digital and remote services reduced preventive help-seeking 
behaviour and limited aspects of perinatal care (i.e., breastfeeding 
support and infant health visits) for many, and exacerbated health 
inequalities ( Howard and Khalifeh, 2020 ). Our review indicates this 
led to women feeling let down (“dumped”) and forgotten by ser- 
vices, which contributed to feelings of grief and sadness that their 
expectations of care had not been met ( Fumagalli et al., 2021 ). 

Finding ‘Silver linings’ 

Possible  “silver  linings” that  are  protective  to  mental  health 
were  identiﬁed.  First,  the  beneﬁts  of  having  uninterrupted  time 
at home just with partners was described in many studies inter- 
nationally. This positive lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic may 
have  implications  for  policies  around  parental  leave  and  work- 
ing  arrangements  for  families  expecting  a  child  or  with  a  new- 
born.  For  example,  the  Australian  government  has  announced  a 
plan to slowly increase paid parental leave from 12 to 26 weeks 
( ABC news, 2022 ) (14 October 2022), and the retirement commis- 
sion in New Zealand suggesting that parental leave should not be 
tied  to  the  birthing  partner  ( Stuff,  2022 )  (22  September  2022). 
Second, whilst the necessary shift to telehealth maternity services 
was disruptive for many, women did report using social media to 
connect with other new mothers and create online peer support 
groups ( Sweet et al., 2021a ; Farewell et al., 2020 ). Ways that such 
peer support can be sustainably maintained and integrated with 
maternity services should be considered. 

Limitations 

This  scoping  review  has  several  limitations.  First,  only  data 
available in the published version of the included articles was syn- 
thesised, as authors were not contacted about access to original 
datasets.  Synthesising  the  complete  original  data  from  included 
studies would have added nuance to the description of the result- 
ing themes. However, this must be balanced by the concern that 
despite  ethical  requirements,  additional  detail  about  the  circum- 
stances  of  individual  women’s  stories  may  inadvertently  identify 
participants ( Saunders et al., 2015 ). Second, the research synthe- 
sised is predominantly from high-income countries and included 
participants who were available to be part of a convenience sample 
during the pandemic. Therefore, the experiences of women from 
low-and-middle  income  countries,  and  those  with  marginalised 
identities or who had barriers to service access within high income 
countries are under-represented. Whilst one included study identi- 
ﬁed that migrant women accessing telehealth services faced bar- 
riers such as accent bias ( John et al., 2021 ), further research into 
the maternity experiences of women in diverse contexts is recom- 
mended. 

Conclusion and recommendations 

Whilst compulsory lockdowns and physical distancing regula- 
tions  are  being  repealed  across  the  world,  the  COVID-19  pan- 
demic still cannot be spoken about in past-tense. In many settings, 
women may still have to self-isolate if they or their family mem- 
bers are unwell during pregnancy/postpartum, and health services 
across the world are still under intense pressure due to the ad- 
ditional  burden  of  the  pandemic  ( Sarría-Santamera  et  al.,  2021 ). 
Therefore,  the  ﬁndings  of  this  review  highlight  how  the  known 
risk of low levels of social support to women’s perinatal health are 
exacerbated  by  additional  requirements  to  isolate,  although  “sil- 
ver linings” that are protective to mental health were identiﬁed. 
Further research investigating how accessing breastfeeding support 
via telehealth affected women’s emotional health and breastfeed- 
ing duration is also required. In addition, maternity services should 
consider how perinatal mental health support, such as peer sup- 
port groups, may be integrated into the care of women who may 
still be required to isolate or have reduced visitors during preg- 
nancy, birth or a hospital stay.
