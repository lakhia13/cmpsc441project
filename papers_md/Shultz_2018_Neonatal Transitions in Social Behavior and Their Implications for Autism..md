Abstract

Within the context of early infant–caregiver interaction, we review a series of pivotal transitions 
that occur within the first 6 months of typical infancy, with emphasis on behavior and brain 
mechanisms involved in preferential orientation towards, and interaction with, other people. Our 
goal in reviewing these transitions is to better understand how they may lay a necessary and/or 
sufficient groundwork for subsequent phases of development, and also to understand how the 
breakdown thereof, when development is atypical and those transitions become derailed, may 
instead yield disability. We review these developmental processes in light of recent studies 
documenting disruptions to early-emerging brain and behavior mechanisms in infants later 
diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, shedding light on the brain–behavior pathogenesis of 
autism.

Neonatal Development in Context

At birth, the behavioral repertoire of human newborns is limited [1,2]. Within just days, 
weeks, and months, however, early reflexes and reflex-like predispositions give way to 
complex volitional behavior: infants acquire new vocal abilities [3]; change their feeding, 
sleeping, and waking patterns [4–6]; and acquire new control of their eyes, neck, hands, and 
feet [7–12]. Brain size at birth, approximately one-third that of an adult’s [13], doubles 
during the first year [14] and increases by another 35% by year 3 [15]. Synaptic density 
quadruples in year 1 and will be 150–200% greater than that of an adult by year 3 [16,17] (to 
then be pruned or selectively strengthened in iterations that continue throughout the lifespan 
[17,18]).

This enormous postnatal change, however, does not happen in a vacuum [19]; in the absence 
of near-constant care, the infant’s survival would be nonviable [20,21]. The infant enters the 
world in a state of utter fragility, and requires a parent or primary caregiver to provide for

survival needs. In playing that role, the caregiver serves as both partner and facilitator, 
matching his or her own behavior (in facial affect [22,23], vocal tone [24,25], and physical 
touch [26,27]) to the needs of the infant in a manner that serves as the foundation for further 
acquisition of abilities [27–29]. The behaviors of infant and caregiver are thus mutually 
adapted and mutually reinforcing [30]: the infant–caregiver dyad, iteratively changing itself 
through interaction, is an integral and inseparable unit of early development [31].

Within that context, we review a series of pivotal transitions in the first 6 months of typical 
infancy that depend upon the mutually reinforcing context of the infant–caregiver dyad, with 
emphasis on behavior and brain mechanisms thought to be involved in preferential 
orientation towards, and interaction with, other people. This topic is especially timely given 
recent reports demonstrating disruptions to early-emerging mechanisms of brain and 
behavior in infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [32–34], 
highlighting early periods of infancy as key targets for future research. In reviewing this 
literature, we endeavored to link recent work to a broader set of seminal papers in neonatal 
behavior and development (additional references can be found in online supplemental 
materials). Only by intensively studying these periods and more fully understanding the 
growth trajectories that define normative development, will we be able to gain new 
mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of autism and related disabilities.

Mechanisms of Social Adaptive Action Present Shortly After Birth

The prolonged period of caregiver dependency and biological immaturity of human 
neonates, lasting years longer than that of other primate species [35], has often been noted as 
a critical aspect of human adaptive success [36]. More than simply providing a longer period 
of postnatal plasticity in which to refine brain and behavior [37], the initial fragility and 
prolonged maturation of the human newborn provide an ineluctable ‘initial task’ (that of 
survival) as well as a highly specific context in which that task will be solved. That context, 
the specific setting in which changes in newborn brain and behavior will take place, is 
defined by nearly continuous interaction with other people.

Preferential Orientation and Reflexive Engagement

Shortly after birth, neonates already display remarkable attunement to their caregivers, 
demonstrating reflexive and reflex-like patterns of behavior that enable close physical 
contact [38], as well as distinct patterns of preferential orientation to the sights, sounds, and 
smells of their caregivers [39,40] (preferences that are present already despite extremely 
limited ex utero experience, with some preferences present already in utero [41]). These 
reflexive behaviors increase an infant’s probability of initiating and/or maintaining direct 
caregiver interaction: the palmar grasp reflex enables holding [38]; the Moro reflex 
facilitates caregiver contact in the event of falling [42]; the rooting reflex aids neonates’ 
efforts to find mother’s nipple [9]; and the sucking reflex facilitates successful and continued 
feeding [4].

In addition to the presence of these reflexive actions, rather remarkable preferences are 
evident already at 10 minutes postpartum, when neonates will track a moving face-like 
pattern farther than a pattern of scrambled or inverted facial features [43]. Similar evidence

of preferential orientation has been replicated within the first hour [44] and the first 1–5 days 
of life [45,46], for cues ranging from biological motion [47] to others’ eyes [48]. These 
preferences are highly specific (Figure 1), encompassing sight [48,49], sound [39], and smell 
[50,51] (touch, too, undoubtedly plays a critical role [52,53] but remains relatively and 
unfortunately less well studied).

Signaling Behaviors

In order to effectively increase the neonate’s chances of survival, the predispositions 
described above must function as more than mere preference: viewed more broadly, these 
predispositions must serve not only to direct neonatal resources towards the caregiver, but 
also to elicit the response of those caregivers by serving as signaling behaviors [54]. 
Neonatal crying is a clear example of a reflexive behavior that functions as a highly effective 
signal to promote proximity and contact [55,56]. Crying reliably evokes perceptions of 
distress and discomfort on the part of most parents [55], is associated with distinct patterns 
of brain activity, and is believed to evoke distinct neuroendocrine responses (here the 
existing literature is sparse in humans [57,58] but more well-established in animal models 
[57]). Crying’s efficacy as a signaling behavior is also found in parents’ response: holding or 
cuddling the infant is a highly efficient means of reducing or ending infants’ crying [59]. 
Crying thus signals the infants’ state but also elicits parent response and precipitates 
additional opportunities for interaction.

Beyond the vocal domain, the neonate’s own facial musculature also serves as a potent 
signaling system. Fully formed and functional at birth, neonates’ facial muscles enable them 
to produce all but one of the discrete facial actions visible in adults [60]. Although these 
facial expressions are not initially contingent upon caregiver behavior (e.g., neonatal smiles 
are largely reflexive, occurring during sleep [61]), the muscle actions themselves clearly 
resemble interpretable facial expressions, including smiling, brow-knitting, and pouting 
[60,62], and are fully sufficient to evoke a caregiver’s emotional response. By evoking that 
response (without in any way depending upon it), these noncontingent behaviors facilitate 
future (actually) contingent social interaction [20,63].

The fact that initially spontaneous, noncontingent actions can beget actual social interaction 
highlights a means by which adaptive solutions emerge from reoccurring couplings of infant 
and caregiver [64]. In the preceding example, the capacity of the neonate (the physical 
ability to form a smiling facial expression) combines with stable, recurrent features of the 
caregiving environment (the consistency with which the caregiver responds to facial actions 
that look like smiling). That coupling increases the joint probability of emergent social 
adaptive action, beginning moments after birth. Critically, the neonate’s capacities and the 
functional significance of those capacities as signaling behaviors cannot be understood 
without examining them within the caregiving context into which neonates’ behaviors are 
adapted. Through repeated interactions, solutions to the neonate’s initial task of survival lead 
to mutually adaptive actions on the part of both neonate and caregiver.

Mutual Adaptation

Page 4

The behaviors described above (behaviors that serve to preferentially orient neonates’ 
attention towards their caregivers, as well as behaviors that then serve as signals to those 
caregivers) are adaptive precisely because they provide selective advantage within an 
environment that includes a caregiver. But those behaviors by themselves would not be 
sufficient for survival, even in a caregiver’s presence. They require the reciprocal, 
complementary actions of the caregiver, actions that are themselves modified to optimally 
respond to the signals of the neonate and to then elicit further signals [20].

Evidence of this iterative mutual adaptation (Table 1) is found even upon first contact with 
the neonate, when mothers display orderly and predictable patterns of species-specific 
behaviors that include touch and an intense interest in establishing eye-to-eye contact [65]. 
The mother’s interest in the neonate’s eyes matches the neonate’s ability to attend to 
mother’s eyes [48,49] and appears to play an important role in establishing affective ties 
[65]. In addition to seeking eye contact, caregivers use slow and exaggerated speech 
patterns, facial expressions, and body movements that are well matched to the newborn’s 
restricted perceptual capacities [20,66,67]. These are also the actions that appear to 
optimally engage young infants [66,68].

In another instance of parity between infant and caregiver, newborn crying elicits picking-up 
and soothing [20], but newborn crying also occurs most frequently when newborns lose 
visual, auditory, or physical contact with their caregivers [55]. Parental response thus serves 
to reinstate that which was lost. Picking up the infant not only soothes and promotes state 
regulation but also increases newborn arousal and visual attentiveness [20,59]. Likewise, 
touching the infant has the effect of increasing infant eye contact with the caregiver [69]. 
Each of these mutually adapted actions facilitates still further forms of interaction [70].

Caregivers are, of course, highly motivated to engage their newborns socially. Reflexive 
actions of the newborn, such as grasping, are often interpreted by caregivers as signals of 
actual social recognition, affection, or emotional expression, well before such actions are 
consciously controlled or contingently deployed [20,63]. This perception creates rich 
opportunities for newborn learning: the meaning that caregivers ascribe to newborns’ 
actions, and the way in which caregivers then modify their own reactions accordingly, 
creates the ideal framework for newborns to learn the meaning of their own actions: that is, 
through the reactions of their caregivers [71,72].

Early patterns of imitative behavior reveal this exact form of interactional meaning-making. 
Mothers imitate their babies’ gestures soon after birth and continue to increase their degree 
of imitation in the following first 3 days [54]. Imitation is a form of mutual adaptation and 
another strong signaling behavior for both partners. Maternal imitation increases infants’ 
gazing towards the mother, and an infant’s reflexive orienting towards the eyes of a caregiver 
reliably elicits increased caregiver response [54,73].

Typical Transitions in Social Adaptive Action After 2–3 Months’ Experience

Neonates’ success in the social adaptive tasks described above (i.e., their success in 
preferentially directing biological resources towards a caregiver; the success with which 
their predispositions serve as signaling behaviors; and the success with which those 
signaling behaviors then become mutually adapted to those of their caregivers) creates, in 
turn, a set of new conditions that will further facilitate development. The initial acts of 
orienting, signaling, and adapting establish myriad opportunities for extended social 
interaction. These new avenues for social interaction present the infant with new tasks to be 
learned and put to use, setting the stage for a cascade of transitions in behavior (Figure 2).

Early Adaptive Action Constrains Later Learning

The iterative process of early infant learning, whereby ‘each [ability] is first of all an effect 
of the preceding [ability], and itself becomes the cause of the following [ability]’ ([74], p. 
112), is well illustrated by the learning that transpires in Rovee-Collier’s classic ‘infant 
conjugate reinforcement’ paradigm [75]. In this experiment, an infant lies on her back, with 
a string connecting her foot to a mobile that hangs above. Given the direct coupling between 
foot and mobile, movements of the infant’s foot induce movement in the mobile, providing 
the child with novel reinforcement of what were initially only spontaneous leg movements. 
Importantly, infants discover this relationship themselves: as infants spontaneously kick their 
feet they learn the contingency between their own movements and the movement of the 
mobile. Once this link is discovered, the act of kicking, initially spontaneous and unrelated 
to the mobile, acquires new meaning: kicking becomes an instrumental act for effecting 
control over the external world. As a consequence of this newfound adaptive value, more 
precise and vigorous instrumental kicks increase while spontaneous and undirected kicks 
decline [76].

These data illustrate two key points about developmental change. First, infants play an active 
role in discovering their own new tasks: in this case, they discover a direct but previously 
unknown link between their own actions and those of the external world, and they then learn 
to control and exploit that link. Second, learned volitional behaviors can emerge from and/or 
depend upon behaviors that were initially spontaneous or reflexive.

Together, these two points demonstrate highly specific constraints that specify and guide 
subsequent skill acquisition: both the spontaneous initial actions (kicking rather than, for 
example, hand-waving) as well as the learned solution to that task (kicking with specific 
magnitude and direction) have the direct effect of limiting and specifying future instances of, 
and opportunities for, learning. If no initial kicks occurred, or the relationship between 
kicking and mobile never discerned, the contingency would not be learned. Likewise, by 
learning to control the mobile with specific kinds of kicks, the probability of other actions 
(e.g., trying to use hand-waving for the same purpose) declines, while the probability of the 
newly learned kicking increases (see [77] for an additional elegant example of how early 
experiences precipitate changes in infants’ subsequent activities).

In short: by selectively exploiting specific actions that successfully yielded past adaptive 
results, infants transform not only their own future behaviors but also their own future

possibility of behaviors (i.e., altering the probability that other related behaviors will be 
more or less likely to occur) [78].

Reflex-like Behaviors Give Way to Volitional Actions

The kicking-to-mobile-movement contingency is by no means the only case in which 
learned, volitional behaviors replace, emerge from, and/or depend upon behaviors that were 
initially spontaneous or reflexive. A host of such transitions occur in a variety of different 
developmental domains in an infant’s first months (Figure 3).

For instance, the side-to-side head turning reflex, a variant of the rooting reflex, is thought to 
play an important role in feeding by providing an opportunity for the neonate’s mouth to 
come into contact with the mother’s nipple [9]. As neonates gain increasing experience with 
feeding, this initially spontaneous action transitions to a directed head turning reflex at 
approximately 2–3 weeks of age [4,9], and then transitions again to volitional directed head 
turning at approximately 3 months [11]. The hand grasping reflex, present at birth, begins to 
disappear at approximately 4–5 months of age, coinciding with the emergence of voluntary 
reaching and grasping [38]. Similarly, the toe grasping reflex, also present at birth, begins to 
fade as infants gain voluntary control over feet and legs and begin to crawl [10].

These transitions from reflexive behaviors to volitional actions do not appear to progress 
according to lockstep chronological timers; instead, they depend more heavily on 
individualized experiences that are necessary to facilitate later transitions. For instance, the 
directed head turning reflex persists longer in infants who are breast-fed compared with 
infants who are bottle-fed [4]; voluntary reaching and grasping emerge earlier in infants who 
are afforded the experience of picking up objects [77]; and the decline of the toe grasping 
reflex is more closely related to the acquisition of voluntary control of the feet than to 
chronological age [10]. Each of these examples can be thought of as an individualized 
timescale of development: initial behaviors provide pivotal opportunities that enable 
subsequent learning, in highly individualized fashion. (For more on individualized 
timescales of development, and recent statistical advances in the measurement thereof, see 
Figure 4.)

Infant–Caregiver Adaptation Guides Developmental Transitions

The developmental learning processes described above are equally applicable to transitions 
in social learning. Just as infants discover a physical linkage in the foot and mobile example, 
infants also discover links connecting them to their social partners [79,80]. Research on 
infant–caregiver dyads reveals that infants’ facial movements, head movements, and 
vocalizations are coupled, often tightly, to the facial expressions and sounds of their 
caregivers [54,79]. As infants discover and exploit the links between their own actions and 
the actions and reactions of others, the spontaneous and reflex-like behaviors of the neonate 
are transformed.

One notable example of such a transition is the case of orienting towards faces. Preferential 
tracking of faces (as described above) is initially a reflex-like, spontaneous, stimulus-driven 
form of orienting, observed from the first hours after birth [43]. Notably, however, this 
neonatal orienting response declines after 4–6 weeks postpartum, reaching a relative low

point, before preferential attention to faces then increases at approximately 2 months 
[29,81]. This would appear to be a transition from a more reflex-like response (i.e., not 
socially contingent) to a more volitional, truly social, form of orienting. Evidence of this 
transition is also supported by other changes at approximately 2 months. First, the physical 
characteristics of face-like stimuli that most effectively elicit preferential attention also 
change: while neonatal preference for faces can be elicited by simple schematic stimuli [44], 
real faces are preferred by 1–2-month-old and older infants (reviewed in [82,83]).

In addition, the 2nd month also marks the first time in which clear evidence exists that 
infants engage with other people in an interactive, socially meaningful manner. At 
approximately 2 months, infants begin smiling and cooing in response to faces [84]. Prior to 
this point, neonatal smiling is endogenous, happens most often during sleep, and shows little 
evidence of linkage to external stimulation [61,84]. At 2 months, however, smiles begin to 
be contingently linked to changes in caregiver vocalization and affective state, indicating not 
only the emergence of social smiling but also indicating that infants’ preferential visual 
attention (in this case, directed towards faces) now also functions as a form of 
communication [84]. Newborn vocal development also undergoes marked change shortly 
thereafter: prior to approximately 3 months, crying is reflexive, undifferentiated, and marked 
by an absence of vowel production; after 3 months, cries become interactive, intentional 
[85], and increasingly reflective of the infant’s psychophysiological state [3] (note that the 
timing of these changes, in contrast to smiling, is partially constrained by anatomy: at 3 
months, the larynx descends [3] and the ribs reconfigure [86], altering the infant’s capacity 
for vocal production).

Finally, there are also large changes at approximately 2 months in infants’ expectations of 
other people. New capacities for active social engagement are evidenced by several classic 
studies: in the still-face paradigm [87], when a formerly interactive partner becomes 
unresponsive, 1.5- and 3-month-old infants (but not neonates) become upset, with signs of 
distress including crying, general negative affect, and shifts in visual attention away from the 
caregiver [88]. In addition, infant social bids during the still-face phase increase at 2 months 
of age [80], offering evidence that infants have now become active agents in dyadic 
interaction, developing specific expectations of the ways in which social interactions should 
unfold.

As infants exploit the links between their own actions and those of their caregivers, 
caregivers, in turn, modify their behavior to progressively advance cycles of learning. During 
the infant’s second month, mothers spend more time talking and smiling with their infants, 
and less time displaying neutral facial expressions [89]. Regularities in face-to-face play 
(such as turn-taking) are established, repeated, and then extended during this period [54], 
with the peak in face-to-face play occurring between 3 and 6 months [90]. Evidence 
suggests that mothers of 3-month-olds display an average of approximately eight changes in 
emotion-related facial expressions per minute [54]. With even 3 hours per day of direct 
interaction, and with as little as 25% of that time spent directly attending to mother’s face 
[91], an infant would be exposed to approximately 360 changing emotional cues in a single 
day, or more than 32 000 between the ages of 3 and 6 months.

Co-occurring Changes in Early Infant Brain and Body Systems

Relative to our knowledge of infant behavioral transitions, detailed information about co-
occurring changes in brain are still limited. Existing knowledge does, however, suggest a 
substantial transition also occurring at approximately 2 months, shifting from largely 
subcortical to increasingly cortical control [92].

At birth, reflexive visual orienting appears to be supported by the subcortical visual system, 
which is differentially responsive to low-spatial frequency information [81], top-heavy 
vertically asymmetric patterns [93], and high contrast polarity [94]. Notably, these are all 
properties also strongly represented in the faces and eyes of conspecifics, and much like 
other mutual adaptations between infant and caregiver (Table 1), this match between signal 
and receiver may be a means of increasing the probability that neonates orient towards 
conspecifics rather than other competing stimuli [81,95].

As the neonate enters her second postnatal month, existing models suggest that reflexive 
orienting responses, subserved by subcortical structures, decline due to developing inhibition 
by cortical circuits (as visual preferences come under increasing cortical control) [96]. This 
theory is supported by the relative immaturity of primary visual cortex at birth [97] and also 
by developmental changes in orienting. Newborn orienting is most effectively elicited by 
face-like stimuli presented in the peripheral visual field [45] (the area that feeds more 
directly into subcortical visual pathways [98]), whereas preferential orienting in 2-month-
olds is more effectively elicited by stimuli presented in the central visual field (which feeds 
more directly into cortical visual pathways [97]). Further evidence comes from the fact that 
retinocortical pathways become fully functional at approximately 2 months [99], and signs 
of adult-like cortical specialization for face processing are also first observed at 2- to 3-
months in both event-related potential (ERP) [100] and positron emission tomography 
studies [101].

Generally speaking, however, much is still to be learned about infant brain development and 
the manner in which behavioral milestones are coupled with brain changes. Newly available 
resources (e.g., the Allen Human Brain Atlas [102] and BrainSpan [103,104] projects) and 
ongoing projects (Human Connectome [105] and Developing Human Connectome [106] 
Projects) are likely to transform our understanding of infant brain development in the 
coming years (Figure 5). Currently, however, data from infant behavior and brain 
development showcase a system that undergoes enormous developmental change in a matter 
of months: neonatal preferences and reflex-like responding give way to remarkably sensitive 
and contingent volitional action. We now review some of the emerging literature regarding 
what is currently known about the derailment of such action in children with ASD.

Disruptions in Social Adaptive Action in Autism Spectrum Disorder

A striking developmental contrast in autism is that older children, and even adults, on the 
autism spectrum often exhibit deficits in social adaptive action that are otherwise present in 
typical infancy. For example, while typically developing infants preferentially orient to the 
eyes of others [48,49], 2-year-olds [107], 10-year-olds [108], and even adults [109] with 
ASD do not.

Unfortunately, direct observation of infant development in autism is still limited. Given the 
late average age of conventional diagnosis [110], and the extent to which diagnosis currently 
depends upon behaviors that emerge in toddlerhood [111], a large gap in current knowledge 
remains. To fill that gap, the past 10 years have seen a substantial increase in prospective 
studies of the infant siblings of children with ASD, whose risk of also having the condition 
is approximately 20% [112], a substantial increase relative to infants in the general 
population [113].

Social Adaptive Action and Brain Specialization in Autism Spectrum Disorder

Recent studies examining the course of early social development in high-risk infant siblings 
have focused primarily on measures of social attention, interaction, and/or more general 
aspects of social development, using standardized assessments as well as experimental tasks 
(see online supplemental materials for references). A wide array of between-group 
differences have been identified among infants subsequently diagnosed with ASD, 
including, among others, differences in frequency of shared smiles, vocalizations, and gaze 
to faces [114,115]; attention to social scenes and images [116]; attention to and engagement 
with objects [117]; ERP amplitude differences in relation to observed eye gaze [118]; 
temperament profiles [119]; responsiveness to distress in others [120]; mutuality of infant–
caregiver interaction [121]; and social smiling and joint attention [122,123].

Related differences are also found in brain structure [34,124,125] and function [33], with 
differences in extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid volume [125], cortical surface area [34], white 
matter fiber tracts [124], and functional connectivity [33] all identified as possible predictors 
of autism in the first year of life. Some studies have also highlighted ways in which similar 
overt behaviors were accompanied by notable differences in measures of underlying brain 
function [118,126].

Across these varied studies, one relatively consistent finding is that although indications of 
earlier differences are present, between-group differences are more easily identified at later 
ages (see online supplemental materials for references). This pattern of results is consistent 
with the notion reviewed above that development is iterative, with an infant’s own actions 
and experiences guiding and constraining future learning [78]. Such a model predicts that 
even small disruptions of early social adaptive action can yield progressively greater 
between-group differences over time, culminating later in the marked symptomatology of 
ASD. Importantly, recognition of development as an iterative process means that differences 
observed at later times must be underway already at earlier ones.

Early Patterns of Preferential Orientation in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Transitions 
Therein

Given the foundational nature of social skills disruption in ASD, as well as the profound 
transitions in typical social development happening in early infancy, changes in preferential 
orientation, engagement, and adaptation during the first weeks and months after birth are a 
critical area of future ASD inquiry.

Existing data in infants later diagnosed with ASD suggest that one such mechanism, 
preferential orientation to the eyes, is not immediately diminished [32]. Levels of early eye-

looking are relatively high in infants with ASD. To be clear, the presence of these relatively 
high levels does not necessarily indicate ‘normative’ or ‘intact’ function [32]; to the 
contrary, while the magnitude of eye-looking at 2 months is relatively high, the underlying 
developmental processes are clearly already different: rate-of-change in eye-looking, from at 
least 2 months onwards, differs significantly between outcome groups. Moreover, infants 
later diagnosed with ASD exhibit a slight but statistically significant increase in eye-looking 
at 2 months, which then declines (Figure 3D); by contrast, typically developing infants 
exhibit a relative low point in eye-looking at 2 months, which then increases.

As reviewed above, the timing of these differences may relate directly to important 
transitions in adaptive behavior: preferential orientation to faces (present at birth [43]) 
typically declines between 4 and 6 weeks [44] before beginning to increase at approximately 
2 months [81]. Similar transitions during this same period are observed in orienting to 
auditory sounds [127] and imitating others [128]. At a neural level, these changes are 
thought to be accompanied by a shift from subcortical to cortical control, with initial reflex-
like predispositions (subserved by subcortical structures) declining as cortical control 
matures [81].

Taken as a whole, a very specific hypothesis emerges (Figure 3D): reflex-like orienting to 
the eyes of others may be initially, at least superficially, present in newborns with ASD, 
while the latter phase of preferential eye-looking is disrupted. More broadly, in a wide range 
of other sensory and behavioral domains, preferential orientation may initially be present in 
these infants, whilst early pivotal transitions (transitions that depend upon the way in which 
initial preferential orientation is integrated into mutually adaptive interaction) are disrupted. 
Critically, this hypothesis focuses scientific attention on key developmental transitions very 
early in life, and specifically on the progression from a reflexive/’experience expectant’ 
phase of development (largely subcortically mediated), to an interactive/’experience 
dependent’ phase (with greater dependence on cortical control) [96,97].

To be clear, there is little evidence to suggest an outright failure of cortical control of 
voluntary preferential visual attention in ASD; to the contrary, data at later age points 
suggest a co-opting of those cortical mechanisms by attention to other features of the 
environment, such as nonsocial, physical cues [107,129]. These data suggest future lines of 
inquiry, focused in these first few months, on how early predispositions transition into 
mutually adapted social interaction. This line of inquiry should benefit from a direct link to 
decades of work from pertinent model systems [130], work that can now be brought to bear 
in guiding gene–brain–behavior hypotheses of the pathogenesis of autism. Likewise, the role 
of other sensory systems in these processes remains understudied; given the early 
development of the auditory and tactile systems (affective touch in particular [53]), their role 
in constraining and influencing early development is a key area for future study.

Concluding Remarks

Collectively, the data reviewed above, from both behavior and brain development in typical 
infancy, showcase a system that is remarkably attuned to the social world, is mutually 
adapted to caregiver behavior, and becomes progressively more so overtime. From the first

moments of life, neonates exhibit a wide range of socially adaptive preferences and reflex-
like responses that serve to orient their attention towards caregivers as well as behaviors that 
serve as important signals to those caregivers. These behaviors are adaptive because they 
occur within an environment that depends upon a caregiver, one whose own actions are 
adapted to optimally respond to the neonate’s and to further elicit such actions. This 
mutually adapted, mutually reinforcing context of the infant–caregiver dyad is both the 
platform and the catalyst for subsequent development: initially spontaneous reflex-like 
responses transition into remarkably sensitive and contingent social action, all within the 
first months of life.

These findings, together with evidence from early normative transitions, provide an 
important framework for future research in ASD by constraining hypotheses about what 
specific developmental transitions may be disrupted in ASD and when. For instance, rather 
than suggesting a complete absence of preferential orientation to others from birth (as was 
hypothesized dating back to Kanner [131]), these data identify a specific transitional period 
of early infancy, around the second month of life, as a critical focus for future investigation, 
both for systems level neuroscience research (in both human and model systems) and for 
genetics research (guiding and providing the quantitative traits for developmental gene 
expression and methylation studies). These data further suggest that future analysis of 
potential disruptions in autism might productively focus on mechanisms of preferential 
orientation, signaling, and, critically, mutual adaptation between infant and caregiver, 
particularly during this transitional period (see Outstanding Questions). The pursuit of these 
constrained hypotheses holds great promise for yielding insight into the specific 
developmental processes that are disrupted in ASD and for discovering new opportunities 
for innovative early interventions.

Highlights

From the first moments of life, neonates exhibit a range of socially adaptive preferences 
and reflex-like responses that serve to orient their attention towards caregivers, as well as 
behaviors that serve as important signals to those caregivers.

Within the first 6 months of typical infancy, a series of pivotal transitions occur within the 
context of early infant-caregiver interaction, as initially spontaneous reflex-like responses 
transition into remarkably sensitive and contingent social action.

Recent reports suggest that these developmental transitions may be disrupted in autism 
spectrum disorder, opening a critical theoretical insight into understanding the brain-
behavior pathogenesis of autism.

Outstanding Questions

How do neonatal reflexive actions and predispositions transition into mutually adapted 
social interaction in the first months of typical development? What changes at the level of 
brain networks and gene expression accompany such transitions?

How do infants’ early behaviors facilitate later attainment of normative social 
developmental milestones?

How do earlier-developing systems (e. g., touch), as well as disruptions in such systems 
(e.g., potential disruptions in affective touch in infants with ASD), have the potential to 
constrain and canalize the development of later-emerging systems?

For children with delays in specific milestones, is there a corresponding delay in offset of 
related reflexes? Or, alternatively, do reflexes decline on their own timeline, irrespective 
of other subsequent delays?

Is the transition from ‘experience expectant’ reflexive action to ‘experience dependent’ 
social interaction accompanied by a shift from subcortical to cortical control?

Are typical predispositions for conspecific orienting present in newborns with ASD?

How and when do mechanisms of preferential orientation, signaling, and infant-caregiver 
adaptation become disrupted in infants with ASD?

Figure 1. Neonatal Preferential Orientation to Caregiver Sounds, Smells, and Sights.
Preferential orienting is observed already in the first days after birth in the auditory domain 
(A), in response to olfactory cues (B), and in visual attention to faces (C), biological motion 
(D), and face-like stimuli (E). At 5 days, neonates show distinct preference for looking at 
faces that have eyes open rather than closed and even distinguish, despite relatively poor 
visual acuity so soon after birth, between faces with eyes directed towards them rather than 
away. Similarly, neonates distinguish and prefer their own mother’s voice to that of an 
unknown woman, but prefer the sound of even an unknown woman’s voice to that of silence. 
In addition, neonates recognize their mother’s smell and will selectively head-turn at 2–7 
days after birth towards the scent of their own mother’s breast. Examples of more preferred 
stimuli are pictured in the left column while less preferred stimuli are pictured in the right 
column. Stimulus descriptions and citations are given at far right. Data are from references 
[39,40,43–51,94,132–136,150].

Figure 2. Developmental Milestones in Infants’ First 6 Months.
Plotted data, showing the percentage of infants who display each listed behavior between 
birth and 6 months. Behaviors are plotted sequentially, with behaviors that emerge (and, in 
some cases, decline) earlier in development at the top and behaviors emerging later in 
development at the bottom. This sequence of developmental milestones highlights the 
cascading process of infant development, whereby an infant’s own emerging abilities lead 
the infant towards new ways of exploring and experiencing the world, prompting further 
development in an iterative process. Developmental milestone data were scanned or 
transcribed from published texts and manuals [8,10,12,137–142]; data were fitted with a 
sigmoid function to describe the cumulative proportion of children displaying each behavior 
(common milestones were averaged across sources). The fitted functions are color-scaled 
from generally absent (black) to present in 50% of children (red) to present in most children 
(yellow).

Figure 3. Transitions from Reflex-like Actions to Volitional Behaviors.
Behavioral transitions in the first6months of life, with implications for early social behavior 
in autism. (A) Data from references [8,10,12,137–142] showing examples of declining 
reflex-like actions (unbroken lines) and emerging volitional behaviors (broken lines) in the 
vocal, visual, and motor domains. Approximate transition times are marked by vertical lines. 
(B) Top, trajectories of reflex-like actions and volitional behaviors from (A) are plotted 
against chronological age. Bottom, trajectories are aligned at the time of transition to 
illustrate the idea that learned, volitional behaviors may replace, emerge from, and/or depend 
upon behaviors that were initially spontaneous or reflexive: as new volitional behaviors are 
acquired, the adaptive value of simpler reflex-like actions decreases, as does the action. (C) 
In typical face perception, existing normative data [44,45,81,92] suggest a similar transition 
at approximately 2 months: reflex-like eye-looking declines (unbroken gray line) while

volitional eye-looking increases (broken gray line). Reflexive eye-looking is believed to be 
experience-expectant and subcortically mediated, while volitional eye-looking is believed to 
be experience-dependent and largely cortically mediated. (D) A corresponding reduction in 
amount of eye-looking by typically developing (TD) infants has been observed at the 
hypothesized time of transition, shown in the top panel (blue line, sum of percentage fixation 
on eyes). Observed data from months 2–8 replotted from [32]. Trajectories from 0–2 months 
represent hypothesized levels of eye-looking in keeping with existing normative data 
[96,97]. In observed data from [32], infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibited 
relatively high levels of eye-looking at 2 months, which then declined. By contrast, TD 
infants showed relatively low levels of eye-looking at 2 months, which then increased. 
Relatively high levels of eye-looking at 2 months in ASD (red) suggests reflex-like eye-
looking that is not supplanted by volitional eye-looking and, instead, persists atypically. 
Rather than an outright failure of cortically controlled voluntary preferential attention in 
ASD, eye-tracking data suggest a co-opting of experience-dependent cortical mechanisms 
by attention to other, nonsocial features in the environment. As a result, reflex-like eye-
looking gradually declines as it is supplanted by attention to other (non-eye) features.

Figure 4. Developmental Methods: Quantifying Individualized Timescales of Growth.
Functional data analysis is a relatively new method of analyzing time series data that places 
greater emphasis on individual trajectories of data, considering the trajectory itself to be a 
single observation and quantifying that function’s variability in terms of both timing and 
scale [143,144]. This is an important methodological as well as conceptual shift in how 
longitudinal data are analyzed and understood, with exciting implications for studies of child 
development and for the conclusions we may draw about underlying biological processes. A 
good example of this shift can be seen when analyzing a very literal example of a child’s 
growth: change in height. (A) Shows height measurements of girls from 1 to 18 years of age 
(from the classic Berkeley Growth Study [145]). The underlying biological process of 
growth is of course nearly identical in all children, but exactly when the pubertal growth 
spurt occurs and how large it is varies considerably by individual. (B) Individual differences 
can be expected in timing (when a particular change occurs), in scale (how large or small a 
given change may be), and in both timing and scale. With conventional growth curve 
modeling, (C) fitting individual data with a power function (left panels) yields a relatively 
good fit in statistical terms (R2 > 0.98 for each of the three example curves); however, it also 
eradicates all signs of the pubertal growth spurt, as seen especially in the plots of change in 
height and in rate of change in height (the1stand 2nd derivatives, respectively). Fitting 
thesamedatawitha5th order polynomial [right panels of (C)] improves the picture somewhat, 
but parameter estimates of when the pubertal spurt occurs in individual children (colored 
dots) are as much as 2 years earlier than estimates observed in a more data-driven fashion, as 
in (D), using B-spline basis functions. (D) In functional data analysis, variation in both

timing and scale are quantified, and curve shape is determined empirically. (E) Rather than 
being confounded by individual differences in maturational rate (individualized 
developmental timescale), functional data analysis measures the extent of these differences 
as ‘warping’ or registration functions, explicitly comparing and correcting for differences in 
chronological time versus individual maturational time. (F) When data are analyzed as 
functional trajectories, registered according to measures of individual difference in 
developmental timing, the ability to estimate the shape of the actual developmental process 
improves substantially.

Figure 5. Longitudinal Expression of Genes Associated With Neurodevelopmental Processes.
Recent advances in studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of gene expression in the human 
brain augur a new frontier for studies of infant and child development, connecting well-
studied behavioral and cognitive milestones to multiple measures of infant brain biology. 
One example is the BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Braini [104], offering a 
transcriptional architecture of the human brain from early fetal development through 
adulthood. While longitudinal expression patterns for more than 17,500 genes were 
analyzed, the gene expression trajectories plotted here are for genes whose differential 
expression is associated with key neurodevelopmental processes. (A) Fourteen brain regions 
in which expression was measured are highlighted. (B) Five sets of genes are highlighted, 
the expression levels of which are associated with neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, dendrite 
development, axon development, and myelination, respectively. (C) Longitudinal expression 
levels of genes associated with each process are plotted, for each brain region, as a

percentage of the minimum and maximum lifetime levels of expression. Brain regions are 
sorted according to peak expression levels between 0 and 24 postnatal months of age. Note 
the clear waves of expression during these periods of early child development: high levels of 
expression associated with neurogenesis continue through the first 6 months of life, with 
marked decline thereafter, followed by waves of increased expression associated with 
synaptogenesis, dendrite development, axon development, and finally myelination. Given 
the enormous developmental change occurring in these time periods, data like these, coupled 
with densely sampled behavioral and neuroimaging data, are likely to transform 
understanding of infant development in the coming years. See online supplemental materials 
for additional related references.
