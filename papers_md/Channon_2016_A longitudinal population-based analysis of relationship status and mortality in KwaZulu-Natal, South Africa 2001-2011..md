A longitudinal population-based analysis of
relationship status and mortality in KwaZulu-Natal,
South Africa 2001–2011

ABSTRACT
Background Mortality risk is lower in married than in
unmarried men and women. However, little is known
about the association between mortality and relationship
status in South Africa where marriage rates are low,
migration is common, many couples are not co-resident
and HIV prevalence is high.
Method Using demographic surveillance data collected
from 2001 to 2011, relationship status was categorised
as conjugal ( partners belong to the same household),
non-conjugal ( partners do not belong to the same
household) or not partnered. Rates of relationship
formation and dissolution were calculated by age and
sex. Controlling for antiretroviral treatment (ART)
introduction in 2005 as well as education, sex-speciﬁc
and age-speciﬁc Cox proportional hazards models were
used to investigate the association between relationship
status and (1) all-cause mortality and (2) non-AIDS
mortality.
Results Before 2005, individuals in conjugal
relationships had a lower hazard of all-cause mortality in
all age groups than not partnered men and women.
Non-conjugal relationships lowered the risk of dying
compared with not partnered men and women in fewer
age groups. After ART introduction, the protective
association of conjugal relationships was weaker but
remained generally signiﬁcant for men and women but
not in non-conjugal relationships. In the later period, the
association is reversed in young men (20–29 years) with
mortality higher in conjugal and non-conjugal
relationships compared with men not partnered. The
analysis of non-AIDS deaths provided similar results.
Conclusions The higher degree of social connections
within a shared household environment that
characterises conjugal relationships affords men and
women greater protection against mortality.

BACKGROUND
It is well documented that in many contexts marital
status has a strong association with mortality.1–4 It
has generally been found that being married is asso-
ciated with a lower mortality rate and that in many
cases the association is stronger for males.5–7 It has
also been found that the protective effect of mar-
riage is weaker at older ages.8 9 However, with a
few exceptions,
little attempt has been made to
study the effect of relationship status as a time-
varying covariate; instead, marital status has typic-
ally been treated as ﬁxed at a certain point in
time,1 7 10 and very few studies consider the associ-
ation between different types of relationship status
(eg, non-marital) and mortality. Furthermore, we
could not ﬁnd any studies on the association

between mortality and marital status (or social rela-
tionships more generally) in the African context as
the majority of studies have been conducted in
North America or Western Europe.3 4

We use longitudinal, population-based data avail-
able in the Africa Centre Demographic Information
System (ACDIS) to explore whether the protective
association between relationship status and mortal-
ity holds in a rural South African context, and to
extend our understanding of relationship formation
and dissolution in a rural South African population.
The level and patterns of HIV incidence and
prevalence, HIV treatment and mortality have been
well described in this population.11–13 In South
Africa, marriage among some communities has

KwaZulu-Natal, where, by 2008/2009, 12% of
women aged 20–45 years were currently married
and fewer than one-third of women aged 45–
49 years were ever married.14–16 Non-marital rela-
tionships are very common but cohabitation is not
as common as in other settings and a variety of dif-
ferent residential arrangements exist between both
marital and non-marital partners.14 Thus, in this
setting, we argue that there is a need to deﬁne rela-
tionships in a different manner to the standard
married/non-married dichotomy. We

use

In this paper, we estimate formation and dissol-
ution rates for men and women’s relationships
and
from 2001 to 2011 in KwaZulu-Natal
compare the risk of mortality for people in a conju-
gal relationship, a non-conjugal relationship and
those not partnered by sex in the periods before
and after HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) was
available.

DATA AND METHODS
Data
The data used in this paper were collected as part
of the ACDIS, an ongoing demographic surveil-
in KwaZulu-Natal.17 The
lance system (DSS)
ACDIS collects information on all 89 000 members
of households within the site; however, individuals
can have multiple household memberships and/or
be a member of a household without being resident
in the same geographic location as the household.18
The reason for this is that deﬁning households only
in the sense of co-residence ignores the dynamic
and complex nature of households in this area;

56

non-resident members can have relationships with other house-
hold members (eg, spouse, parent, child), and the health and
well-being of non-resident members may be closely related to
the health and welfare of resident members and vice versa, and
in the South African context non-resident adults make frequent
return visits.18 19 Demographic data on members of the DSS are
updated through a routine household visit which varied in fre-
quency over time between two and three times a year.17

At each routine household visit, the current relationship status
of all individuals is recorded. However, the relationship status
does not indicate who the partner is or when the relationship
started. When the two partners are members of the same house-
hold, the couple are classiﬁed as a conjugal relationship and
additional information is collected including the identity of the
partner, the start date of the relationship, the date of customary
or civil marriage (if any) and the end date (if applicable).

Given that relationship status does not remain constant over
time and our analysis was conducted over a period of more than
a decade, we considered relationship status as time-varying in all
our models. By considering relationship status as time-varying,
we are speciﬁcally studying the association between mortality
risk and current relationship status, whereas previous research
has generally operationalised relationship (or marital) status for
a ﬁxed time point. Over long periods, treating relationship
status as static would potentially lead to misleading results. At
any point in time, there are three possible mutually exclusive
relationship states: not partnered, in a non-conjugal relationship
(ie, partnered but not linked in the data and not members of the
same household) and in a conjugal relationship.

Methods
All adults aged 20 years and older on 1 January 2001 were fol-
lowed up until death, the ending of any membership of a house-
hold resident in the study area, or 1 December 2011 when they
were censored. Person-time in a conjugal relationship was calcu-
lated using the documented start and end dates of the conjugal
relationship. For person-time in a non-conjugal relationship, it
was assumed that time in this state started on the date his or her
non-conjugal relationship was ﬁrst reported during a routine
household visit. A non-conjugal relationship was assumed to
have ended on the date the routine household visit that docu-
mented the person’s
relationship status had reverted to
unpartnered.

Relationship formation and dissolution rates were calculated
as the number of formations or dissolutions divided by the
number of person-years experienced at risk of that event pre-
sented per 1000 person-years. The transitions between the three
relationship states are summarised in ﬁgure 1. A relationship for-
mation was deﬁned to be a change from not being in a relation-
ship to being in either a non-conjugal or a conjugal relationship.

partnered, that is, at risk of an event. Dissolution is deﬁned as a
change from being in a non-conjugal or conjugal relationship to
not being partnered through separation, divorce or widowhood.
Person-time at risk of dissolution was calculated as the sum of
all periods where an individual was in a relationship (conjugal
or non-conjugal).

In order to model the association between relationship status
and mortality, we used Cox proportional hazards models.20 The
proportional hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld
residuals.21 Relationship status was included in the models as a
time-varying covariate. All of the multivariate analyses con-
trolled for age (using linear and quadratic terms) and highest
(as a categorical variable).
reported educational attainment
Educational attainment was split into ﬁve categories: <1 year,
primary school, secondary (not matriculated), matriculated or
higher and unknown/missing. Public roll-out of HIV treatment
began in the study area in November 200422 following which
adult mortality declined.11 Therefore, we examine the associ-
ation between relationship status and mortality before and after
2005 using time-varying coefﬁcients.23

We also repeated the analyses for non-AIDS deaths only
where individuals were censored at the time of their AIDS death
(a competing risk analysis). The rationale for focusing on
non-AIDS deaths is to provide a direct comparison with previ-
ous studies on marital status and mortality in low general HIV
prevalence contexts. Furthermore, HIV and ART status are not
available for both partners in most cases and it would not be
possible to appropriately adjust for confounding by the timing
of HIV status and ART initiation within couples. Previous
studies have found mixed results with marriage associated with
both increased24 25 and decreased26 HIV risk.

RESULTS
In January 2001, 32% of women were not partnered (table 1),
42% were in a non-conjugal relationship and 26% were in a
conjugal relationship. However, this hides a great deal of vari-
ation by age, with 70% of those aged 20–29 years in a non-
conjugal relationship compared with <10% of those aged 60
and over. Those aged 60 and over were particularly likely to be
not partnered, while those aged 50–59 years were most likely to
be in a conjugal relationship.

Men were generally more likely to be in a conjugal relation-
ship than women, especially at older ages. This is the conse-
quence of women’s longer survival and their partners dying
before them, especially since in more than 85% of conjugal rela-
tionships the woman was younger than the man with a mean
age difference of more than 6 years. Men were much less likely
than women to be in a relationship in the 20–29 year age
group, but at older ages men were more likely to be in a rela-
tionship. Men aged 20–24 years were especially unlikely to be
in any form of relationship, with only 2% in a conjugal relation-
ship and 45% not partnered. Two-thirds of men aged 25–29

predominantly non-conjugal.

Overall, 64% of couples in a conjugal relationship on 1 January
2001 were cohabiting and 58% were married. For older couples

in a conjugal relationship, cohabiting was more common (78%
among those aged over 60 years), while for younger couples the
most common reason for not cohabiting was that the male was
outside the DSS. Marriage also varied by age with around 80% of

conjugal couples being married in the 60 and over age group, but
less than a ﬁfth in the age group of 20–29 years.

Table 2 shows age-speciﬁc formation and dissolution rates of
relationships. Given the sex differentials in relationship status by
age highlighted in table 1, sex-speciﬁc formation and dissolution
rates were calculated. Figure 2 shows point estimates for these
rates with 95% CIs. Formation rates were highest for females
aged 20–29 years and males aged 30–39 years. For both sexes,
formation rates declined substantially in the older age groups,
although for those aged 60 years and older relationship forma-
tion was much more common for males than for females.
Indeed, for those aged 60 years and older, the relationship for-
mation rates for males and females were 93 and 12/1000
person-years, respectively, and this difference was statistically
signiﬁcant.

Dissolution rates peaked for men in the youngest age group
and women in the oldest age group. The high dissolution rates
seen at either end of the age range are most probably related to
different processes. Dissolutions in the younger age group are
associated with relationship instability, whereas for women at
older ages dissolution is primarily due to the death of their
partner.

Table 3 shows Cox proportional hazards models separately by
age category and sex. Before 2005, being in a conjugal relation-
ship was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality
for both females and males in all age groups compared to being
not partnered. The protective association with being in a conju-
gal relationship was substantial with hazard rates for females
37–80% lower and hazard rates for males 38–66% lower. After
2005, the protective association with being in a conjugal rela-
tionship was substantially weaker but remained signiﬁcant for
those aged 20–29 years.
females in all age groups, except
Similarly, for men, being in a conjugal relationship remained sig-
niﬁcantly protective for males aged 40 years and older com-
pared to being not partnered, but was no longer signiﬁcant for
men aged 30–39 years, and was associated with a signiﬁcantly
increased risk of mortality for males aged 20–29 years.

The association between being in a non-conjugal relationship
and mortality is more complex. A signiﬁcant protective effect of
being in a non-conjugal relationship on the hazard of mortality
before 2005 was observed in younger women, speciﬁcally those
aged 20–29 and 30–39 years. In contrast, women aged 60 and
older in a non-conjugal relationship had a signiﬁcantly higher

risk of mortality before 2005 than women of the same age who
were not partnered. After 2005, being in a non-conjugal rela-
tionship was not associated with any signiﬁcant change in the
hazard of mortality compared to being not partnered.

For men, being in a non-conjugal relationship was associated
with a signiﬁcantly lower hazard of mortality before 2005 com-
pared to being not partnered, among those aged 30–39 and 40–
49 years only. After 2005, being in a non-conjugal relationship
remained signiﬁcantly protective compared to being not part-
nered only for those aged 40–49 years, and was associated with
a signiﬁcantly increased hazard of mortality for those aged 20–
29 years.

Table 4 shows equivalent Cox models for non-AIDS deaths
only. While precision in some age groups was reduced due to
the smaller number of deaths, the HR estimates for men and
women in conjugal and non-conjugal relationships were consist-
ent with the size and pattern of estimates from the all-cause ana-
lysis, but not always their statistical signiﬁcance. For men aged
20–29 years, the increased risk of non-AIDS mortality associated
with being in a conjugal or non-conjugal relationship was atte-
nuated and the estimates were no longer statistically signiﬁcant.
All models control for highest educational attainment, the
inclusion of which made little substantive difference to the asso-
ciation between relationship status and mortality. Education was
strongly related to mortality risk, with those who were least
educated having a higher mortality risk as well as those whose
educational attainment was unknown or missing. The models
were also run excluding the missing category, but this did not
substantively change the results.

It should be noted that we conducted a sensitivity analysis
using different possible cut-off points in recognition that ART
initiation and follow-up were rolled out from November 2004
to late 2007. The results did not change substantially; however,
by using a cut-off point later than 2007, both changed the
results and violated the proportional hazards assumption.

DISCUSSION
Studies conducted elsewhere have found that marriage has a
protective effect on adult mortality.2–4 However, these studies
were conducted in settings with lower levels of adult mortality
than this study community in northern KwaZulu-Natal, where
until the introduction of ART in 2005 the severe HIV epidemic
led to very high levels of adult mortality.11–13 Given that there

has been a well established and substantial decline in the propor-
tion of married Zulu-speaking men and women,14 16 we
asserted that it was appropriate to examine differentials in mor-
tality risks by types of relationships other than marital and
non-marital. In the context of high levels of migration as well as
low rates of marriage, we used population-based data collected
prospectively, and categorised relationships by the extent of
social connectedness based on whether or not the partners were
members of the same household, and compared these individuals
with those not partnered. Furthermore, we asserted that any
mortality differentials by relationship status are likely to vary
across the periods before and after treatment roll-out. This is the

ﬁrst investigation of the association between mortality and conju-
gal and non-conjugal relationships in an African population.

Consistent with other studies in Africa, dissolution rates
increased with age.27 Relationship formation peaks in men at a
later age than in women, with men being more likely to form
new relationships at older ages than women of the same age.

Before 2005, individuals in conjugal relationships had a lower
hazard of all-cause mortality in all age groups than not part-
nered men and women. In contrast, non-conjugal relationships
were associated with a lower hazard of death in only a few age
groups of women (20–29, 30–39 and 60 years and over) and
men (30–39, 40–49 and 60 years and over). After ART

in non-conjugal relationships.

introduction, the protective association of conjugal relationships
was weaker but remained generally signiﬁcant for men and
women but not
In the later
period, the association was reversed in young men (20–29 years)
with mortality higher in conjugal and non-conjugal relationships
compared with men not partnered. In a context where marriage
rates are low and cohabitation is not universal, the ﬁndings
suggest that conjugal relationships, with their higher degree of
social connection through shared membership of
the same
household, affords men and women with greater protection
against mortality.

The results of the analyses of non-AIDS mortality for men
and women are similar to the pre-2005 and post-2005 estimates
for all-cause mortality. The post-2005 estimates for young men
(20–29 years) in conjugal and non-conjugal relationships were
attenuated in the analysis of non-AIDS mortality but remained
suggestive of an increased risk of mortality compared with those
not partnered. Partnering in young men (20–29 years)
is
common. Post-2005, the proportion of young men in a conjugal
relationship was small (15% of person-time), whereas about
70% of person-time was spent in a non-conjugal relationship.
Union dissolution rates are higher for men in this age group
compared with other age groups; however, we would not antici-
pate that instability in relationships would inﬂuence the esti-
mates of mortality risk given the time-varying approach used in
this analysis. Instead, we interpret this ﬁnding as suggesting that
young men who have entered conjugal and non-conjugal rela-
tionships by this age have characteristics that differ more mark-
edly from those not partnered than at older ages. Furthermore,
these characteristics, for example, socioeconomic status (SES),
may also be associated with increased mortality.28 29 The
increased risk of non-AIDS deaths in this age group of men is
primarily due to accidental and intentional injuries.30

There are some limitations to our approach. It is possible that
previous relationship status impacts mortality risk for a period
after the status changes; however, we would expect that effect
to diminish with time and have not incorporated lagged effects
in our models. Given that the identity of the partner is not
available in the ACDIS for those in a non-conjugal relationship,
it was necessary to consider that a change in status from a non-
conjugal to conjugal relationship was with the same partner,
though this could occasionally be with a different partner.
Similarly, on occasion, serial reports of a non-conjugal relation-
ship could relate to different partners. Thus, our estimated for-
mation and dissolution rates may underestimate the underlying
rates in the population. In addition, we are only able to consider
primary relationships because data regarding multiple partner-
ships and the number of lifetime partners for individuals or
their current partners are not available. In the literature, it has
been debated whether the concurrency behaviour of an indivi-
dual’s partners increases his or her own risk of HIV infec-
tion,31–33 while the number of lifetime partners is an established
risk factor for HIV.32 34 In this data set, the majority of partner-
ships cannot be linked, so we are unable to establish an indivi-
dual’s HIV risk due to their partner’s concurrency; neither can
we identify individuals in the population who have a higher risk
of HIV and thus a potentially different mortality risk.32 35 The
way in which a relationship ends may be associated with differ-
ential mortality risk, but it was not possible to explore formal
divorce separately given that few customary marriages end with
a formal divorce. That said, the study also has a number of
strengths: the inclusion of relationship status as a time-varying
rather than a ﬁxed covariate, prospective longitudinal data col-
lection that minimises recall bias, and the availability of detailed

Research report

information allowing relationships to be categorised as conjugal
and non-conjugal.

There is much still to learn about the processes by which the
timing and characteristics of a relationship impact on the health
of men and women. Within our analysis, we controlled for edu-
cational attainment, which had a strong association with mortal-
ity risk, but we recognise that further work is needed to
investigate socioeconomic gradients in relationship levels and
patterns including age-speciﬁc formation, dissolution and dur-
ation. We anticipate that there may be socioeconomic differ-
ences in the pattern of conjugal relationships; however, these
are likely to be complex given the declining marriage levels and
age of ﬁrst marriage. Appropriate measures of
rising
household-level and individual-level SES across time would be
needed. Attributes of one’s partner may also determine the risk
of marriage, risk of conjugal union and household SES, in add-
ition to the risk of mortality. The effect of migration and
cohabitation on mortality could also be explored and in doing
so would allow for a better understanding of HIV and other
health risks.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that being in a conjugal
relationship in this context is associated with lower all-cause
mortality. This study contributes to the increasing body of evi-
dence worldwide that family relationships and partnerships are
important determinants of health and health behaviours36 and
suggests that greater attention on couple-focused interventions
informed by knowledge about couples’ social and residential
arrangements may be an effective way of improving individual
and couples’ joint health outcomes.

What is already known on this subject

Multiple studies have shown that being married is associated
with lower mortality among both men and women. However,
previous studies have concentrated on higher income contexts
and have not been conducted in settings where marriage rates
are low and many couples live apart.

What this study adds

The concepts of conjugal and non-conjugal relationships are
used in place of the married/non-married dichotomy normally
used. This study shows that in South Africa being in a conjugal
relationship is associated with lower mortality than for those
who were not partnered, for both men and women. In some
age groups, being in a non-conjugal relationship was also
associated with lower mortality, meaning that not being
partnered was associated with the highest risk of death.
