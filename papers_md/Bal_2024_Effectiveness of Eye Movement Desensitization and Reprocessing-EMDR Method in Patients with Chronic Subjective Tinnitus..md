Abstract: This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing (EMDR) method on chronic subjective tinnitus. The research was planned as an
observational study. The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research
hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. They were
identified as having tinnitus. The study samples were determined as 36 participants selected through
purposeful sampling. The samples of the 36 participants included in the study. 12 were assigned to
the 1st Group EMDR and Masking Group, 12 to the 2nd Group Masking and EMDR Group, and 12
to the 3rd Control Group. The study’s dependent variable was the tinnitus levels of the participants,
and the independent variable was EMDR and the Masking method. The dependent variable data
of the study was collected with the Visual Analog Scale and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).
EMDR and Masking methods used as independent variables in the study were conducted in eight
sessions for two months. As a result of the Wilcoxon Sign test used to determine whether the EMDR
Method is effective on tinnitus severity level, the difference between tinnitus severity level pretest
and post-test median scores of tinnitus patients was found to be statistically significant. Our research
findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic subjective tinnitus, and further
studies with a larger sample size could confirm our results.

1. Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external sound stimulus [1]. Its back-
ground can be divided into primary and secondary cases. Secondary cases include patholo-
gies of the outer, middle, and inner ear. Tinnitus can be objective or subjective; the latter can
only be identified by the sufferer. Previous research has shown that tinnitus significantly
impacts quality of life and daily functioning [2]. Tinnitus negatively affects patients’ quality
of life in many areas [3,4]. Many who complain of tinnitus patients primarily express
their psychological concerns [3]. Tinnitus negatively affects people’s quality of life by
disrupting the flow of their everyday life. Depression, hopelessness, anxiety, panic attacks,
and behavior problems are the most common psychological problems in individuals with
Tinnitus [5]. A study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of auditory-vestibular
symptoms among children following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2.
The findings indicated that children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited a
higher prevalence of symptoms. However, no significant difference in symptom prevalence
was observed in children with a prior diagnosis of unilateral hearing loss [2]. However, the
correlation between tinnitus disability and psychiatric comorbidity indicates the impor-
tance of psychological factors in tinnitus management. Tinnitus disability has a stronger

effect on depression scores. Tinnitus disability should be reduced to prevent the occurrence
of comorbidity [6].

Tinnitus is caused by the abnormal perception of regular neural activity induced
by pathology somewhere in the auditory system or even when there is no sound in the
auditory system. Usually, such signals are suppressed by neural filtering in the brain stem.
In tinnitus, the filtering system does not work correctly, and the functioning of the nerves
in their everyday activity is perceived as sound at the brain level. Tinnitus perception is
dependent on stress from attention and emotional state. Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing (EMDR) activates neurobiological mechanisms by reprocessing informa-
tion. This process provides physiological changes in the brain and facilitates information
reprocessing [7,8]. EMDR reduces physical symptoms and chronic pain by combining
unresolved trauma memories and somatic symptoms [9,10]. There are also similarities in
the clinical treatment of phantom pain and phantom voice.

The absence of an effective method for the treatment of tinnitus presents the impor-
tance of the EMDR method in the treatment of tinnitus. With EMDR treatment, these
physical memory and pain sensations can be treated. Tinnitus is known as phantom sound,
and researchers have found an overlapping relationship between brain networks between
tinnitus and phantom pain [3]. The brain networks play an essential role in revealing
and preserving this phantom perception [11]. Besides being a significant health problem
frequently seen in society, tinnitus causes various psychosocial issues in patients and signif-
icantly affects the individual’s quality of life. The cause of tinnitus is not fully known. Due
to the uncertainties in the etiology, there are many treatment options whose efficacy has
not yet been fully demonstrated. Many pharmacological agents have been tried in treating
tinnitus, and research on many pharmacological agents is still being conducted. Surgical
treatment is rarely used for tinnitus, and its place in tinnitus treatment is limited [12].
However, a standard treatment method that is thought effective for tinnitus has not been
determined [13].

Pharmacological treatment has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention for
acute cases of tinnitus, particularly when acute sensorineural hearing loss is present [14].
Furthermore, it would be beneficial to elucidate that the clinical manifestation of tinnitus
is highly variable and that self-perceived emotional state also significantly influences
treatment efficacy [15]. It thus appears that no pharmacological treatment is effective for all
cases of tinnitus [16,17].

A history of trauma to the head, particularly to the ear and/or neck, is frequently asso-
ciated with the onset of tinnitus. The most reported trigger for the development of chronic
tinnitus in the general population is chronic or acute noise-related trauma [18]. In one
study, ototoxicity resulting from immunosuppressive therapy was observed, with hearing
loss representing the most prevalent clinical symptom. This was predominantly bilateral,
while tinnitus was reported in over half of the participants. This indicates a potential corre-
lation between tinnitus and hearing loss, ototoxicity, and immunosuppressive therapy [19].
Although tinnitus has traditionally been considered an otological disorder, recent advances
in neuroimaging technologies and animal studies have proved it is linked to neuronal
connections. The neuronal representation of tinnitus is constituted by an increased neuronal
firing rate, enhanced neuronal synchronization, and changes in tonotopic organization
in the central auditory pathways [20]. The pathophysiological mechanisms proposed to
cause tinnitus encompass a range of hypotheses, from those pertaining to the cochlea, such
as separation of stereocilia of hair cells and spontaneous otoacoustic emission, to those
concerning the neural aspects, such as disruption of the spontaneous resting activity of
primary auditory nerve fibers and Moller’s proposal of ephaptic conduction (“cross-talk”)
between adjacent nerve fibers [21,22]. Many of these cases entail some form of disturbance
to the peripheral auditory system, which can manifest as a range of hearing impairments.
However, one of the most significant yet underappreciated causes of tinnitus is not related
to the ear itself but to its connections with the auditory system within the central nervous
system. Myofascial disorders of the head and neck have been demonstrated to induce

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

tinnitus by regulating the activity of the somatosensory system, which projects to the
central auditory system at multiple levels, including the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and
inferior colliculus. Many of these cases entail some form of disturbance to the peripheral
auditory system, which can manifest as a range of hearing impairments. However, one
of the most significant yet underappreciated causes of tinnitus is not related to the ear
itself but to its connections with the auditory system within the central nervous system.
Myofascial disorders of the head and neck have been demonstrated to induce tinnitus by
regulating the activity of the somatosensory system, which projects to the central auditory
system at multiple levels, including DCN and the inferior colliculus [23].

The negative psychosocial effects of tinnitus on individuals are known [24]. Indi-
viduals who report tinnitus are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and sleep
disorders, and their quality of life decreases [25]. The mental health status of individuals
with tinnitus is rated as worse than that of those without tinnitus [26]. Reports show that in-
dividuals with tinnitus and a psychological condition have a worse psychological state [27].
These conditions can interact with each other, exacerbating their effects. A bidirectional
effect exists between response to tinnitus and an individual’s mental health status. The
interaction between tinnitus and a psychological condition is particularly pronounced in
individuals with psychological damage, such as post-traumatic stress disorder [28]. Trauma
causes significant changes in the limbic system and may eventually cause tinnitus. There-
fore, it is thought that tinnitus can be eliminated by reducing trauma in the limbic system
through the EMDR method. According to studies on EMDR, EMDR is used as a helpful
treatment method in treating symptoms that cannot be reduced despite regular treatments
or in treating somatic diseases that cannot be treated medically. Studies show that EMDR
can also reduce physical and psychological symptoms. EMDR is a treatment approach
constantly evolving and integrating different contributions from major psychological ori-
entations [29]. It aims to develop a robust and comprehensive treatment by incorporating
aspects of various modalities, making it suitable for clinicians of all orientations. The
adaptive information processing model, which proposes neurobiological underpinnings
of experiential-based disorders, can potentially serve as an integrative theory for under-
standing and exploring clinical phenomena [30]. However, it should be noted that this
model is not a method itself but rather a framework that can be used within different
orientations. The hope is that further rigorous research will be conducted to validate the
information processing formulation. Overall, EMDR provides a versatile approach that can
be used within various therapeutic orientations [31,32]. In this study, it was investigated
whether EMDR and Masking methods would be partially or completely effective in the
treatment of chronic subjective tinnitus in individuals with tinnitus. This study aims to
eliminate chronic subjective tinnitus by activating the disturbing information stored in the
nervous system, which is thought to cause tinnitus due to past negative experiences, with
the EMDR method.

The hypotheses of this study are organized as follows;

H1: The level of discomfort from chronic subjective tinnitus of individuals with chronic subjective
tinnitus who are included in the EMDR method will decrease significantly compared to individuals
who are not included in the practice.

H2: EMDR method is positively more effective than Masking method on the level of discomfort
from chronic subjective tinnitus in individuals who apply due to tinnitus.

H3: There is a difference between the chronic subjective tinnitus levels in the groups in which
EMDR and the Masking method are not applied to individuals who apply due to tinnitus.

H4: The frequency and severity levels of tinnitus will decrease in the groups in which EMDR and
the Masking method are applied in individuals who apply due to chronic subjective tinnitus.

2. Material and Methods

Ethics committee permission was obtained (protocol code 2019/27). All participants
signed informed consent. This research was conducted at the Ear Nose Throat (ENT) Clinic
Hearing Speech Balance Diagnosis Treatment Center of the Training and Research Hospital
in Ankara. In this research, 36 individuals aged 15–60 participated. A detailed medical
history was obtained from the individuals who participated in the study; the content and
purpose of the study were explained to all participants, and their written permissions
were obtained.

Participants and Procedure

The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research
hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. In
this study, subjects with subjective tinnitus complaints participated for at least three months.
While selecting the study group for the research, one of the purposeful sampling methods
was chosen according to the criterion sampling technique [33]. Criterion sampling studies
all situations that meet a set of predetermined criteria. Participants were informed about
the study’s aims and procedures and signed an informed consent form before participating.
The otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses of the participants were
recorded at the ENT outpatient clinic. However, information about certain disorders, such
as temporomandibular disorders, was not obtained.

The gender distribution in the study was as homogeneous as possible, with the inclu-
sion of an equal number of male and female participants. Furthermore, cases presenting
with unilateral or bilateral symptoms were also included. The location of the tinnitus
symptom was determined through the administration of a questionnaire. In addition to
indicating subjective tinnitus, participants were included in the study if their cases were
acute or chronic. Furthermore, the study included individuals with secondary tinnitus or
single tinnitus. For detailed information, please refer to Table 1. (The first group consisted
of seven men and five women, while the second group consisted of nine men and three
women. The third group consisted of six men and women in the control group. All of them
were found to have chronic subjective tinnitus).

3. Ethics

Written informed consent was signed by all participants before data collection. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University with
the number (201927) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

3.1. Exclusion Criteria

ENT and audiological examinations were performed on all participants. Subjects who
had a disease that could cause objective tinnitus, anatomical problems or acute disease related
to the outer ear and middle ear, acoustic tumor, Ménière’s disease, ear surgery, neurotological
intervention, neuropsychiatric problem, general physical fitness disorder, and social life were
restricted for this reason, and whose written permission could not be obtained were not
included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Subjective tinnitus diagnosis,
age range between 18 and 60 years, normal ENT examination, no systemic health problems,
normal hearing level, Type A tympanogram, and voluntary participation.

A pure-tone hearing test was conducted on all participants. Following the pure tone
hearing test, the tinnitus frequency, intensity, minimal masking level (MMS), and residual
inhibition were determined using pure tone, warble tone, pulsed noise, and broadband
noise between 125 and 16,000 Hz.

In this study, data regarding the general characteristics of tinnitus were collected
from the participants prior to the tinnitus mapping procedure. Information regarding the
patient’s tinnitus was obtained through a series of questions, including the date the tinnitus
began, the location of the sound, the source of the sound, whether the sound originated from
the right or left ear, and a detailed description of the sound. Subsequently, all participants
were informed individually. Tinnitus maps were established through clinical audiometry.
The Tinnitus Map Interacoustics AC40 (Assens, Denmark) clinical audiometer and TDH-39
supra-aural headphones were employed for this purpose. The products used belong to
Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt E ˘giitm and Research Hospital, a state hospital in Turkey.

Audiometric examinations were conducted in a standardized, quiet room utilizing
an Interacoustic AC40 clinical audiometer and TDH-39 supra-aural headphones. The
analysis encompassed both airborne hearing thresholds within the 125–8000 Hz range and
bone conduction hearing thresholds within the 250–4000 Hz range, with all individuals
participating in the study being included. The pure tone averages were calculated by
taking the arithmetic mean of the hearing thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. The
study included individuals presenting with tinnitus without hearing loss. The frequencies
between 8000 and 16,000 Hz were analyzed using high-frequency headphones (KOSS
HV/1A and Sennheiser HDA 200). Sennheiser is a company based in Germany and its
products are recognized worldwide. The products used belong to Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt
E ˘giitm and Research Hospital, a state hospital in Turkey.

Three groups were created for this study, carried out in two stages.
Group 1: Individuals who have chronic subjective tinnitus and received EMDR (EMDR

and Masking Group) (12 participants),

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

6 of 19

Group 2: Individuals with chronic subjective tinnitus and Masking (Masking and

EMDR Group) (12 participants)

Group 3: Individuals with chronic subjective tinnitus who did not receive therapy

(Control Group) (12 participants).

In the first stage of the research, while EMDR and Masking were applied to the
participants in the first Group, the Masking Group and EMDR were used on the participants
in the second Group.

The study was conducted on a biweekly basis for a period of eight weeks, with each
session lasting for 45 min. At the conclusion of the treatment period, patients were invited
to participate in follow-up assessments and complete questionnaires. Additionally, scales
were administered to each group. The participants completed the Tinnitus Handicap
Inventory (THI) and Scale, as well as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The severity of tinnitus
was evaluated using pre-test and post-test scores.

3.2. Measurements
3.2.1. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI)

Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), a questionnaire developed by Newman et al. In
1996, consisting of 25 questions and scored between 0 and 100. THI is a questionnaire form
that is a highly reliable test, and it is suitable for the age, gender, and hearing thresholds,
is easy to apply, and provides more psychometrically specific measurements [13]. It has
functional, emotional, and catastrophic sub-scores. The total score obtained from the items
is 100. A study was conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of
the test [34]. A correlation has been identified between the Tinnitus Disability Questionnaire
and the Visual Analogue Scale, which is used for the assessment of tinnitus. The evaluation
of the questionnaire is classified as follows: 0–16 points indicate very mild first degree,
18–36 mild second degree, 38–56 points moderate third degree, 58–76 points severe fourth
degree, and 78–100 points very severe fifth degree [35].

3.2.2. Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

The patient is asked to score his perception of tinnitus, discomfort from high volume,
hearing loss, and quality of life in the range of 0–10. VAS is a test used frequently by
different branches for all kinds of Pain and has various versions. It has been adapted and
used for tinnitus in many studies. The visual analog scale shows the frequency, duration,
and severity of tinnitus in patients and how uncomfortable patients are from tinnitus.
In visible analog scale questions, the patient guides the level of subjectivity on a ruler
numbered from 0 to 10, and 0 is shown in the happiest and 10 in the most unhappy manner.
The visual analog scale is divided into five groups: tinnitus severity is shown with VAS-1,
tinnitus duration, the frequency with VAS-2, disturbing level VAS-3, attention deficit with
VAS-4, and sleep disorders with VAS-5 [36].

3.2.3. Treatment Protocol

EMDR includes imaging the past experiences or traumatic experiences of the psycho-
logical counselor or therapist using finger gestures, providing the systematic movement
of the client’s eyes in a systematic right-to-left direction. EMDR is a therapy approach
that helps clients reprocess their negative life experiences to contribute to their emotional
health [37].

Study participants received standard EMDR protocol. All eight stages described in
this session are included [6]. Appropriate distance, position, safety, and silence room
are provided for EMDR therapy. Each participant underwent a maximum number of
10 sessions of EMDR therapy lasting 45 min each. EMDR therapy sessions occurred
regularly, with a frequency of once every 1 to 2 weeks. A single clinical psychologist
administered the EMDR.

The study participant is then asked to create a description of their chronic subjective
tinnitus that included: (1) an image or a felt sense that represents the study participant’s tin-

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

nitus experiences; (2) negative belief(s) in relation to the tinnitus experiences; (3) a preferred
belief in relation to the experiences; (4) the (usually negative/undesirable) emotions associ-
ated with the experiences; and (5) the physical sensations associated with the experiences.
The therapist first elicits a disturbing memory from the participant, and the participant
is asked to rank the disturbance of that memory on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 (0 = no
disturbance; 10 = worst disturbance imaginable). At various stages in the processing, the
therapist checks in with the client to gauge the client’s level of disturbance. The goal of
EMDR processing is to bring the Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD) down to 0 or a one
and to keep it maintained at that level. Participants were asked to form a negative opinion
about the tinnitus severity of their tinnitus if SUD is not taken. Subsequently, patients were
asked to produce alternative positive thoughts and demonstrate how much they believed
on the Validity of positive Scale (VOC) (1 is completely false and seven is completely true).
Afterward, patients were asked to visualize images depicting trauma focusing on negative
thoughts and experiencing emotions and physical sensations.

An EMDR therapy session is an individual therapy session with a trained EMDR
therapist. Prior to the initial EMDR session, each study participant was provided with a
verbal and written explanation of the rationale behind the use of EMDR therapy for their
tinnitus. EMDR was provided according to the standard eight-phase protocol comprising
(1) history and treatment planning, (2) client preparation, (3) assessment, (4) desensitization,
(5) installation, (6) body scan, (7) closure, and (8) reevaluation. Each study participant
worked with the therapist to collect relevant history and current information about the study
participant’s experiences of their tinnitus, which provided the basis for an individually
tailored formulation.

Tinnitus Masking Therapy (TMT)

All participants included in the study were administered THI at the beginning of the
study. As a result of THI, tinnitus frequency, intensity, MMS measurement, and residual
inhibition were performed as tinnitus assessment tests. For tinnitus frequency matching,
two different pure tones, one low frequency and one high frequency, were sent to the
contralateral ear at various frequencies at a level audible to the participant. The patient
was asked to select the one closest to the tinnitus frequency from these two pure tones. If
the patient resembled the low-frequency sound, the tinnitus frequency was determined
by sending two different pure tones again, one low-frequency sound in addition to the
frequency they had previously resembled, and one high-frequency sound in addition to
the frequency they had previously resembled, if the patient resembled the high-frequency
sound. This process was continued until the tinnitus frequency was determined. After
the tinnitus frequency was determined, in unilateral tinnitus, two pure tones with two
different intensities were sent to the contralateral ear at the previously determined tinnitus
frequency, 10 dB lower and 10 dB higher than the intensity level that the participant could
hear comfortably. The participant was asked which sound was closer to their tinnitus, and
the procedure was continued until the tinnitus intensity level was found. The minimum
masking level was determined by sending a pulsed noise to the participant’s contralateral
ear at an intensity level 5 dB lower than the tinnitus intensity level. The pulsed noise
was increased by 5 dB until the level at which the participant could not detect tinnitus
was determined. The minimum intensity level of the pulsed noise required to prevent
the participant from hearing their tinnitus was defined as the minimum masking level.
To investigate residual inhibition, the narrowband noise was presented for 60 s at the
tinnitus frequency, 10 dB above the minimal masking level. The participant was asked
whether there was a decrease or disappearance of tinnitus. Complete residual inhibition
was defined as the disappearance of tinnitus, while partial residual inhibition was defined
as the temporary disappearance of tinnitus after masking. After these procedures, the
Masking method was applied.

3.3. Analysis of Data

The total number of the study group participating in the research is 36. Each group
was assigned 12 individuals with tinnitus. Nonparametric statistical methods are used
when the number of participants in the study is below 30 [38]. Therefore, nonparametric
tests were used to analyze the data of the study. In addition, normality analyses were
performed for each scale. In this study, Mann–Whitney U Test was used to determine the
difference between the pre-test and post-test of the groups, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank
Order Test was used to evaluate the pre-test and post-test differences within the groups.
The data collected in the study were analyzed on the computer using SPSS 25 (Statistical
Programme for Social Sciences).

4. Results

Thirty-six patients with chronic subjective tinnitus were evaluated at the end of the
measurements. Of those, twelve participants in 1st Group EMDR and Masking and Making
and EMDR, 2nd Group Masking and EMDR, and 3ng Control were presented below.

Table 1 indicated the sex of the participants in 1. Group EMDR and Masking in
the study: 58% are male and 42% are female. The marital status of the participants is
83% married, and 17% are single. It is seen that 25% of the child variable owned has no
children, 8% have one child, 42% have two children, and 25% have three children. When
the profession variable can be examined, 8% are retired, 25% are officers, 17% are students,
8% are in other professions, 33% are housewives, and 8% are self-employed. The age of the
participants is 17% between the ages of 15–20, 8% between the ages of 21–30, 17% between
the ages of 31–40, 25% between the ages of 41–50, and 33% between the ages of 51. and
above. 2. Group Masking and EMDR participants are presented in Table 1.

When gender, number of children, and the variable are considered, it is seen that
the groups are homogeneous in the 1st group EMDR and Masking and the 2nd group
masking and EMDR groups within and between the groups (p > 0.001). On the other hand,
in the marital status and occupation variables, it was determined that the groups were
homogeneous in the 1st group EMDR and Masking (p > 0.001), and the groups were not
homogeneous in the 2nd group masking and EMDR (p < 0.001).

Table 2 indicated that it was seen that 58% of chronic subjective tinnitus was caused by
family problems, 33% from trauma, and 8% from other causes. The similarity of the sound
of chronic subjective tinnitus was stated that 10% was wind, 50% humming, 10% motor,
20% water, and 10% ultrasound. When looking at the beginning of chronic subjective
tinnitus, 25% of patients stated that chronic subjective tinnitus existed for one year, 8% for
two years, 17% for three years, and 50% for five years or more. When the localization of
chronic subjective tinnitus is examined, it is stated that 25% of them are chronic subjective
tinnitus in the right ear, and 75% of them are bilateral. He stated that 100% of the patients
had no hearing loss. Socio-demographic results of 2nd Group Masking and EMDR were
presented in Table 2.

Looking at the cause, onset, similarity, and location of the tinnitus, it can be seen that
the groups are homogeneous within and between the groups in the 1st group EMDR and
masking and in the 2nd group masking and EMDR (p > 0.001). On the other hand, it can be
seen that family problems are more common in the 1st group EMDR and masking in terms
of causes of tinnitus, buzzing is the highest in terms of similarity, onset is more than five
years, and location is in both ears.

According to Table 3, the total THI score of patients undergoing EMDR was 54.33 ± 19.39,
and the total THI score of patients undergoing masking was 24.42 ± 19.69. The total VAS

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 2. Group EMDR produced a statistically
significant change in THI total scores (Z = −3.061 p < 0.002). The median THI score
assessment was 51.66 (IQR 58) before treatment and 14.16 (IQR 22) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 3. Group Control produced a statistically
no significant change in THI total scores (Z = −423 p > 0.673). The median THI score
assessment was 48.83 (IQR 49) before treatment and 50.25 (IQR 47) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that 1. Group EMDR produced a statistically
significant change in VAS total scores (Z = −3.063 p < 0.002). Indeed, the median THI score
assessment was 25.50 (IQR 26) before treatment and 7.83 (IQR 6) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 1. Group Masking produced a statis-
tically no significant change in VAS total scores (Z = −1.632 p > 0.103). The median THI
score assessment was 8.33 (IQR 7) before treatment and 8.33 (IQR 21) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 2. Group Masking produced a statisti-
cally no significant change in THI total scores (Z = −1.342 p > 0.180). The median THI score
assessment was 25.58 (IQR 27) before treatment and 53.66 (IQR 26) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 2. Group EMDR produced a statistically
significant change in THI total scores (Z = −3.063 p < 0.002). The median THI score
assessment was 24.33 (IQR 25) before treatment and 8.50 (IQR 9) after treatment.

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in 3. Group Control produced a statistically
no significant change in THI total scores (Z = −423 p < 0.673). The median THI score
assessment was 18.91 (IQI 21) before treatment and 18.58 (IQI 21) after treatment.

These results indicated that the EMDR method has an important effect in decreasing
THI total scores. On the other hand, the Masking method did not have a significant effect
on reducing THI total scores. Similar results were seen in the VAS total scores.

According to Table 5, the Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine the difference
between the total THI scores of the 1st group treated with EMDR and Masking method and
because of the test, the difference between the THI scores of the patients treated with EMDR and
Masking method was found. The difference was statistically significant (U = 11,000, p < 0.005).
Looking at the rank means, it is understood that the total THI scores of the participants treated
with the EMDR method (21.11, IQR 3) were lower than the THI rank mean of the participants
treated with the masking method (37.00, IQR 3). This finding shows that the EMDR method is
more effective than the masking method in reducing the participants’ THI scores.

According to Table 5, Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine the difference
between the total THI scores of the 2nd group masking treated with EMDR and Masking
method and as a result of the test, the difference between the THI scores of the participants
treated with EMDR and Masking method was found. The difference was statistically
significant (U = 14,000, p < 0.005). Looking at the rank means, it is understood that the total
THI scores of the participants treated with the EMDR method (13.89, IQR 7) were lower
than the THI rank mean of the participants treated with the masking method (33.29, IQR 3).
This finding shows that the EMDR method is more effective than the masking method in
reducing the participants’ THI scores.

According to Table 5, Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine the difference
between the total THI scores of the 1st group masking treated with EMDR and 3. Group
Masking method, and as a result of the test, the difference between the THI scores of the
participants treated with EMDR and Masking method was found. The difference was
statistically significant (U = 16,000, p < 0.005). Looking at the rank means, it is understood
that the total THI scores of the participants treated with the EMDR method (16.77, IQR 7)
were lower than the THI rank mean of the participants treated with the masking method
(38.29, IQR 28). This finding shows that the EMDR method is more effective than the
masking method in reducing the participants’ THI scores. Other comparisons and VAS
results are shown in Table 5.

5. Discussion

This study aims to examine the effectiveness of the EMDR method on tinnitus. Our
research found that the level of tinnitus in individuals with tinnitus showed a significant im-
provement after the EMDR method. In contrast, the Masking method did not significantly
improve tinnitus. It was concluded that applying the EMDR method would be effective
in individuals with subjective tinnitus. The EMDR method, the subject of our research, is
an advanced version of the CBT method and includes the CBT protocols. This integrative
psychotherapy method includes bilateral stimulation, such as rapid eye movement from
side to side. As a psychotherapy method, EMDR is gaining popularity as an increasingly
effective treatment option. Philips et al. [39] similarly found that EMDR therapy effectively
reduced tinnitus. In our study, the participants’ symptoms were reduced after EMDR
application, but this reduction was observed at different levels among the subjects. In
the control group, no statistically significant change in VAS and THI scores was applied
simultaneously with the experimental group. These results suggest that the therapy used
in individuals with tinnitus is beneficial. It can be concluded that EMDR therapy has a
significant effect on treating tinnitus in individuals with it.

The initial hypothesis of this research project is that the tinnitus scores of individuals
with tinnitus who undergo EMDR therapy will demonstrate a notable reduction when
compared to the tinnitus scores of individuals who do not participate in the therapy.
In formulating this hypothesis, we used the tenets of Shapiro’s Adaptive Information
Processing (AIP) model. Given that traumatic experiences impede the normal functioning
of the information processing system in our nervous system, the information is stored
in a manner that reflects its initial experience. Even after a few years, the data remain
stored without processing. Consequently, the information in question becomes frozen
over time. Therefore, it persists within the neural network. This study aims to assess the
efficacy of EMDR as a treatment for chronic subjective tinnitus. Two experimental studies
have demonstrated that EMDR is an efficacious treatment for tinnitus distress, with the
effect maintained at the three-month follow-up [40]. The study indicates that EMDR is an
efficacious treatment for tinnitus, with bimodal treatment EMDR resulting in a reduction in
tinnitus complaints [41]. Furthermore, EMDR has effectively treated comorbid conditions,

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

such as tinnitus and hyperacusis [39]. A notable decrease in THI scores was observed
following EMDR treatment, with this improvement sustained over an extended period.
The working mechanisms are thought to include a working memory account, classical
conditioning, physiological changes associated with the orienting response, and neural
integration theories. However, the most explanatory model remains to be determined.
The findings of this study indicate that different therapeutic interventions integrate over
time and reflect progress in the treatment process. However, no significant between-
group differences were observed on specific scales after treatment [39]. These findings are
consistent with those of our own study.

At present, no specific pharmaceutical agent has been approved for the treatment of
tinnitus. Several potential therapeutic modalities have been shown to provide patients
with varying degrees of symptomatic improvement and an enhanced quality of life. In the
early stages, sedatives and other medications may be beneficial. Nevertheless, research into
more effective treatments is ongoing. A variety of methods have been demonstrated to be
effective in the treatment of tinnitus. These include prophylaxis, medical therapy, surgical
therapy, electrical stimulation, the use of hearing aids, the application of tinnitus maskers,
tinnitus reeducation therapy, psychological support, hypnosis, and the use of muscle
relaxants and relaxation practices. The treatment above protocols, which include attention
control, biofeedback therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), auditory discrimination
training, laser applications, acupuncture therapy, and ozone therapy, are the most employed
treatment options for tinnitus. The adverse effects of tinnitus on quality of life can be
mitigated through a trained professional’s administration of CBT sessions.

Following the Jastreboff theory, the initial stage in the development of tinnitus is the
supervisory region, which is then followed by the limbic system. The limbic system is
responsible for the emotional response to tinnitus and the operation of the autonomic
nervous system. The dysfunction of the autonomous and limbic systems can account for
the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders among individuals with tinnitus.
It has been demonstrated that exposure to physical and emotional stress in the perception
of tinnitus can potentially disrupt the tinnitus suppression mechanisms by influencing the
limbic and autonomic systems. Therefore, tinnitus is sustained by the autonomic system
and activates the autonomic system [36]. Traumatic personal experiences can cause chronic
tinnitus [37]. This study was designed with the hypothesis that the EMDR method can
treat tinnitus by eliminating trauma in the limbic system by activating the suppression of
tinnitus through the suppression of the limbic system and the suppression mechanisms of
tinnitus. In conclusion, the findings of our research corroborate this hypothesis. Our study
hypothesized that the EMDR method would eliminate trauma in the limbic system and
activate the tinnitus suppression mechanisms, thereby eliminating tinnitus. This was based
on the supposition that the limbic system is suppressed due to trauma and that tinnitus
suppression mechanisms are canceled. Indeed, the findings of our study substantiate
this hypothesis. In a study by Philips et al. [39], individuals diagnosed with tinnitus
were administered a 10-session EMDR treatment. The study demonstrated that EMDR
resulted in most participants’ clinically and statistically significant improvement in tinnitus
symptoms. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of the treatment were observed to persist for
six months following the conclusion of the intervention. These findings are consistent with
those of our study.

In a separate study, the efficacy of EMDR and CBT was evaluated in the context of
subjective tinnitus, specifically in relation to tinnitus phantom perception. The findings
of this study indicate that EMDR may be a valuable approach for treating individuals
with subjective and chronic tinnitus. These results align with those of our research. The
EMDR protocol entailed eight stages and was conducted over six weeks, with each session
lasting 90 min. Eye movements were employed during EMDR sessions, and additional
tactile stimulation was utilized in seven cases. In the initial three to five sessions, memories
associated with the tinnitus were processed. In the concluding sessions, the subject was
instructed to engage with the tinnitus sensations evoked by the EMDR technique. In this

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

15 of 19

study, all sessions were recorded on video to provide feedback. Following an examination
of 43 of the 226 patients seen by otorhinolaryngologists, treatment was initiated with
35 participants. A total of 35 participants were included in the study. Five participants
discontinued the treatment regimen at varying stages and for disparate reasons. Three
participants exhibited no subjective tinnitus complaints following three to five EMDR
sessions. These findings are consistent with those of our previous study.

The second hypothesis of our research is that the EMDR method is more effective
in reducing tinnitus levels in participants than the masking method in individuals who
apply for tinnitus. The primary objective of formulating this hypothesis is to demonstrate
the efficacy of EMDR in addressing tinnitus and examine its impact on tinnitus. The
concept of masking as a method for suppressing tinnitus was first proposed by Jones and
Knudsen in 1928 [42]. Subsequently, Saltzman and Ersner advanced the use of hearing
aids for masking [43]. By the late 1970s, masking had emerged as a successful approach
to treating symptomatic tinnitus [44]. The objective of masking is to displace the tinnitus
by providing an external sound to the participants, thereby eliminating the perception of
tinnitus. To identify the most efficacious spectrum for masking, considerable attention
has been devoted to the psychoacoustic characteristics of the masking sound, including
its frequency and intensity. Diagnostic studies have concentrated on tinnitus intensity,
frequency, and maskability. However, this did not affect the ability to predict tinnitus
intensity, frequency, and maskability results. Furthermore, it was not deemed sufficient
to elucidate why tinnitus of an identical nature induces discomfort at disparate levels in
disparate individuals [45].

Consequently, the tinnitus severity level of the participants who received the initial
group masking method was determined to be higher than the tinnitus level of the partici-
pants who received the EMDR method. In other words, the tinnitus level of participants
who received the EMDR method was lower than that of participants who received the
masking method. The results demonstrate that the EMDR method is more efficacious in
treating tinnitus than the masking method. In a study by Marcus, Marquis, and Sakai, the
EMDR method is more effective in recovery than other therapy methods [46]. As evidenced
by our findings, the EMDR method is more effective on tinnitus than the Masking method.
Our study’s findings indicate no statistically significant difference between the pretest
and post-test scores of the Masking method in participants with tinnitus in the first and
second groups. In other words, applying the Masking method to Groups 1 and 2 did not
result in any discernible improvement or reduction in the participants’ tinnitus. It was
therefore observed that the application of the Masking method in the first and second group
participants did not change the tinnitus level of the participants.

The Masking method presents several challenges. The masking method is not straight-
forward for some participants. It was found that approximately 50% of tinnitus participants
were unable to mask their tinnitus. Additionally, participants with hypersensitivity to
sound cannot use the Masking method, as the device’s loudness exceeds their discomfort
levels and may exacerbate their symptoms. Following the masking method’s application,
most participants encountered difficulties in re-establishing their pre-existing perception of
tinnitus. Accordingly, the external sound must be amplified continuously to suppress the
tinnitus sound. This may result in an exacerbation of the tinnitus sound. Consequently,
the masking method employed to mitigate tinnitus may exacerbate the perception of the
tinnitus sound due to the treatment administered to the participants. An improvement of
up to 58% was observed only after an effective masking process. It is essential to exercise
caution when selecting participants, as prolonged use may potentially result in cochlear
damage. It was emphasized that the etiology of Hazell is an important consideration in
tinnitus masks [47]. While the treatment is highly effective in participants with Ménière’s
disease, it is less beneficial in those with noise-related hearing loss. It was stated that the
Masking method treatment should not be expected to yield immediate benefits and that
participants will demonstrate progress after applying the treatment for at least two or
three months.

In some participants, the persistence of tinnitus lends support to the concept of ‘central
tinnitus’ despite the damage to the inner ear and the severing of the eighth cranial nerve.
Central tinnitus is typically not localized, whereas peripheral tinnitus may be localized
in both ears. The primary identified causes of central tinnitus are lesions, inflammations,
and vascular anomalies. Consequently, the Masking method is frequently ineffective in
suppressing tinnitus. The third hypothesis of our research is that there is no significant
difference between tinnitus levels in the groups that did not apply the EMDR method
and the masking method in individuals who used it for tinnitus. This hypothesis was
formulated to detect changes in tinnitus levels in groups that did not apply the EMDR and
masking methods. The results of the study demonstrated that there was no statistically
significant difference between the pretest and post-test mean scores of the participants
in the third group with tinnitus who did not apply EMDR and masking. In other words,
it was determined that there was no regression or reduction in tinnitus in participants
who received the EMDR and masking method, which was not applied to the third group.
Consequently, no alteration was discerned in the tinnitus levels of the participants in the
third group who did not utilize the EMDR and masking techniques.

The fourth hypothesis of our research is that there will be a reduction in tinnitus
frequency and severity levels in groups that apply EMDR and masking methods to individ-
uals who apply for tinnitus. The results of our study demonstrated a statistically significant
difference between the frequency and severity levels of the participants in the first and
second groups who underwent EMDR treatment and the mean scores of the pretest and
post-test scores. A statistically significant difference was identified between the frequency
and severity levels of the first and second-group participants who underwent masking
therapy. No statistically significant difference was identified between the frequency and
severity levels of the third group participants, who did not receive either the EMDR or
masking methods, in their pretest and post-test scores. The results demonstrated that
the EMDR method reduced tinnitus frequency and severity levels among participants.
Conversely, the masking method did not decrease tinnitus frequency and severity levels
among participants. Furthermore, no change in participants’ frequency and severity levels
were not subjected to the EMDR and masking methods. A literature review reveals that the
limbic and autonomic systems have a beneficial effect on tinnitus, reducing its frequency
and severity [48]. Given that the EMDR method employed in this study improves tinnitus
by influencing the limbic and autonomic systems, it is aligned with the findings of studies
investigating these systems’ impact on tinnitus.

The following results were obtained from the study conducted to examine the efficacy
of the EMDR method on the tinnitus of 36 participants. Descriptive statistics: the tinnitus
level post-test results obtained from the THI and VAS of the participants who underwent
EMDR in the first group demonstrated a reduction in severity compared to the pre-test
results. No difference was observed between the pre-and post-test tinnitus level results
obtained from the THI and VAS results of the participants in the first group who underwent
masking. The tinnitus level post-test results obtained from the THI and VAS results of
the participants who underwent EMDR in the second group were lower than the pre-
test results. No difference was observed between the tinnitus level pre-test and post-test
results obtained from the THI and VAS results of the participants in the second group who
underwent masking. The THI and VAS results for the third group of participants who
did not undergo EMDR or masking. No significant difference was observed between the
pre-test and post-test results for tinnitus level. Regarding the frequency of the tinnitus, the
application of EMDR proved to be an effective approach for the participants in the first and
second groups. The application of masking did not affect the tinnitus frequency level of
participants in the first and second groups. The post-test tinnitus frequency level of the
participants who applied the masking method in the experimental group was higher than
that of the participants who underwent EMDR application. The tinnitus frequency level
of the participants who did not receive any therapy was higher than that observed in the
first group, who received both EMDR and masking. The tinnitus frequency level of the

Brain Sci. 2024, 14, 918

17 of 19

participants who did not receive therapy was higher than that of the second group, who
received EMDR.

Regarding tinnitus severity, the application of EMDR is a viable option for participants
in both the first and second groups. The application of masking did not result in a change
to the tinnitus severity level of participants in the first and second groups. The post-test
tinnitus severity level of the participants who applied the masking method was higher than
those who underwent the EMDR application. The tinnitus severity level of the participants
who did not receive any form of therapy was found to be higher than that of the participants
in the first group who received either EMDR or masking. The tinnitus severity level of the
participants who did not receive therapy was higher than that of Group 2, who received
EMDR. Regarding the visual analog scale (VAS), it can be stated that EMDR is an effective
method for treating tinnitus. The application of masking did not affect the visual analog
level in Groups 1 and 2. The visual analog level of the participants who applied the masking
method in the group was higher than that of those who underwent EMDR application. The
visual analog level of the participants who did not receive therapy was higher than that of
the participants in Group 1 who received EMDR and masking. The visual analog level of
the participants who did not receive therapy was higher than that of the participants in
Group 2 who received EMDR.

As is the case with all research, this study has limitations. The study’s findings
indicated that the prevalence of tinnitus exhibited by participants varied in accordance
with the number of sessions. While some participants exhibited a response in the initial
session, others demonstrated a change in their condition after four or more sessions. The
study was conducted over two months. It is therefore recommended that the duration of
the sessions be organized as 10 or more sessions to facilitate the monitoring of changes
resulting from the EMDR method in chronic subjective tinnitus. Moreover, the number
of participants in the study was relatively small. It is therefore recommended that further
research be conducted with larger study groups. The number of samples is a limitation
of the study. It is therefore recommended that future multicenter studies employ larger
sample sizes and longer treatment durations to gain a more robust understanding of the
efficacy of the EMDR method in treating chronic subjective tinnitus.

The impact of EMDR on chronic subjective tinnitus was observed in each subject
within the study. However, it should be noted that the change in chronic subjective tinnitus
levels differed between individuals. The study was conducted with a total of 36 participants.
Regarding the generalizability of the present study, it is recommended that it be conducted
in a different environment with a larger sample size. Therefore, the study’s small sample
size, lack of blinding, and lack of objective outcome criteria are limitations. In the present
study, EMDR was applied exclusively to individuals presenting with subjective chronic
tinnitus. For this reason, it may also be attempted in individuals with objective tinnitus.

6. Conclusions

Our research findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic
subjective tinnitus. EMDR method is recommended as a treatment method for chronic
subjective tinnitus and as an alternative treatment.
