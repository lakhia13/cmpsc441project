Abstract 
Background  Internalizing problems, such as worrying, anxiety and low mood, are increasingly common in youth 
and may constitute an early stage of mental illness development. There is thus an urgent need for effective measures 
to address mental health complaints as they develop and to prevent progression into more serious mental illness. 
Enhanced understanding of early-stage mental illness development, associated cognitive and brain processes, 
and their amenability to early intervention is crucial to this effort. Mindfulness-based interventions offer an accessible 
intervention option with demonstrated positive effects on internalizing disorders such as depression. Furthermore, 
mindfulness-based interventions may modulate cognitive processes and brain activity patterns associated with inter-
nalizing disorders. This study aims to determine how early-stage mindfulness-based intervention impacts internalizing 
symptom development, associated cognitive and brain processes, and mental illness progression in help-seeking 
youth.

Methods  This longitudinal two-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 155 help-seeking youth 
between 16 and 25 years of age. The investigational treatment, the Learning to Offset Stress program, is an adapta-
tion of existing mindfulness-based programs. Developed for youth with internalizing problems, the training com-
bines mindfulness exercises with mindful physical activity and yoga in 8 weekly 2-hour sessions. Participants are

randomized to either Learning to Offset Stress program as an add on to care-as-usual, or care-as-usual-only. Assess-
ments take place at baseline, end of treatment, and 2 months and 6 months after completion of treatment. The pri-
mary outcome is the level of internalizing problems measured with the internalizing subscale of the Adult Self Report 
questionnaire at end of treatment. Secondary outcomes include measures of self-compassion, rumination, experi-
ential avoidance, and well-being. In addition, (functional) magnetic resonance imaging and computerized cognitive 
tasks are conducted at baseline and at end of treatment.

Discussion  The current randomized controlled trial aims to enhance our understanding of the trajectory of emerg-
ing mental illness, associated cognitive and brain processes, and their modulation by early-stage mindfulness-based 
intervention.

Background
Recent years have witnessed a steep drop in youth men-
tal health. Increasing rates of mental health problems are 
observed  since  the  early  2010s,  particularly  in  people  up 
to  25  years  [1].  This  deteriorating  trend  in  youth  mental 
health  has  been  attributed  to  various  factors,  including 
performance pressure [2], (over)use of internet-connected 
devices  and  social  media,  associated  social  comparison 
and  self-esteem  issues  [3],  lack  of  (digital)  downtime,  as 
well  as  socio-environmental  crises  [4].  Common  mental 
health complaints in youth include so-called internalizing 
problems, which are characterized by a tendency to direct 
emotional  distress  inward,  and  are  particularly  preva-
lent  in  women  and  girls  [2,  5–8].  Internalizing  problems 
include  sadness,  self-criticism,  anxiety,  rumination  (i.e., 
repetitive  thinking  or  dwelling  on  negative  feelings  and 
their  causes  and  consequences),  and  social  withdrawal. 
As opposed to externalizing problems (e.g., problems with 
self-  and  emotion  regulation,  aggression,  and  acting-out 
behaviors),  internalizing  problems  may  go  unnoticed  by 
others. However, they are associated with various adverse 
outcomes,  including  increased  risk  for  suicidal  behavior 
[9]  and  adverse  school,  work,  and  health  outcomes  [10–
12].  Moreover,  internalizing  problems,  particularly  when 
they  manifest  in  youth,  may  constitute  an  early  stage  of 
emerging mental illness [13, 14].

Mental illness development

Adolescence and early adulthood are the period of high-
est  risk  for  the  onset  of  serious  mental  illness  [15–17]. 
This  period  of  life  involves  major  neurobiological  and 
socio-emotional  developments  that  may  contribute 
to  the  elevated  risk  for  mental  illness  [18].  Starting  in 
the  early-psychosis  field,  efforts  to  capture  trajecto-
ries  of  mental  illness  development  have  yielded  a  set 
of  disorder-specific  at-risk  mental  states  (e.g.,  for  psy-
chosis,  mania,  depression,  and  borderline  personality 
disorder).  Recent  efforts  have  been  directed  towards 

transdiagnostic  clinical  staging  models  [19].  These 
efforts  are  inspired  by  epidemiological  data  showing 
that  the  emergence  of  psychopathology  tends  to  follow 
complex patterns, with considerable diagnostic instabil-
ity and comorbidity [20, 21]. These data underscore the 
need to adopt a broad transdiagnostic approach to eluci-
date patterns of mental illness development and under-
lying mechanisms.

According  to  transdiagnostic  clinical  staging  mod-
els,  youth  who  seek  help  for  non-specific  mental  health 
complaints, such as internalizing problems, comprise the 
earliest  stage  of  mental  illness  development.  Individu-
als  showing  moderate  but  still  sub-threshold  symptoms 
represent a subsequent clinical stage. These at-risk stages 
are distinguished from those with more discrete and per-
sisting symptoms (e.g., perceptual disturbances, manic or 
severe depressive symptoms) or recurrent or unremitting 
disorders  [18].  These  clinical  staging  models  have  been 
developed  specifically  for  individuals  entering  mental 
health  services  (i.e.,  as  opposed  to  non-clinical,  com-
munity  or  population-based  samples)  and  build  on  the 
premise that transitions across clinical stages are proba-
bilistic  (not  inevitable),  with  interventions  at  each  stage 
aimed  at  relieving  current  symptoms  and  reducing  risk 
for progression to later, more severe, stages [19]. Accord-
ing  to  these  models,  progression  in  clinical  stage,  how-
ever,  is  unidirectional,  meaning  that  an  individual  can 
progress,  for  example,  from  an  at-risk  to  full-syndrome 
stage, but not in the reverse direction [19]. Clinical stage 
is  thus  different  from  clinical  state,  which  can  undergo 
partial  or  full  remission.  Clinical  remission,  however, 
does  not  mean  that  the  underlying  (cognitive  and/or 
neural)  vulnerability  is  no  longer  present.  Rather,  prior 
episodes of mental illness tend to increase risk for subse-
quent  episodes  [22].  Elucidating  the  mechanisms  of  this 
enduring  risk  may  help  develop  targeted  early  interven-
tions  aimed  at  limiting  or  halting  the  downhill  progres-
sion of mental illness development.

Mindfulness‑based intervention

A  promising  early  intervention  option  for  internaliz-
ing  problems  in  youth  is  Mindfulness-Based  Interven-
tion  (MBI)  [23].  Mindfulness-Based  Cognitive  Therapy 
(MBCT)  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  a  range  of 
internalizing  disorders  including  Major  Depressive  Dis-
order (MDD) and anxiety disorders, as well as attention 
deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and  the  preven-
tion  of  depressive  relapse  [24–29].  Part  of  the  ration-
ale  for  MBCT  is  that  individuals  who  are  vulnerable  to 
(internalizing)  mental  illness  tend  to  engage  in  habitual 
patterns  of  cognitive  and  emotional  processing  that  can 
induce or worsen symptom development [30]. In MBCT, 
individuals  learn  to  become  aware  of  these  automatic 
processes  and  observe  them  in  a  non-judgmental  man-
ner.  This  process  of  “decentering”  or  developing  a  more 
distanced stance from internal experiences may increase 
an  individual’s  awareness  of  rigid  or  negative  narratives 
about  themselves  and  the  world,  promote  a  shift  from 
narrative  to  embodied  self-awareness,  and  increase  self-
compassion and flexibility [31–33].

The  clinical  efficacy  of  MBIs  has  been  established 
mainly  in  adult  samples  with  established  mental  illness, 
including depression and anxiety disorders, but research 
suggests  that  mindfulness  training  is  also  a  promising 
intervention  option  in  youth  [23,  34].  These  meta-anal-
yses,  as  well  as  large  clinical  trials  [35,  36]  suggest  that 
mindfulness  intervention  in  youth  may  be  particularly 
effective in clinical settings, to treat symptoms of psycho-
pathology [34], rather than universal preventive interven-
tion  efforts,  for  example  in  schools  [36].  Indeed,  effect 
sizes  in  clinical  samples  are  nearly  three  times  greater 
than  those  in  non-clinical  samples  [34],  suggesting  that 
MBIs  may  be  most  beneficial  to  young  individuals  with 
mental health needs.

Neural and cognitive processes implicated in mental illness 
development

Several  neural  and  cognitive  processes  that  have  been 
implicated  in  (internalizing)  mental  illness  development 
may be amenable to mindfulness-based (early) interven-
tion.  One  potential  process  implicated  in  the  develop-
ment  of  internalizing  symptoms  involves  self-referential 
processing.  Negativity  biases  in  self-referential  process-
ing have been linked to sadness, self-dislike, and indeci-
sion  in  adults  with  various  levels  of  depression  [35]  and 
in youth with (subclinical) depression [37, 38]. Moreover, 
such biases have been shown to impact reactivity to neg-
ative  emotions  [39].  Together,  preferential  attention  to 
negative (self-related) information and cognitive reactiv-
ity to negative emotions may be relevant subcomponent 
processes implicated in the downward spiral in thoughts, 

mood,  and  behavior  that  characterizes  the  onset  and 
relapse of internalizing disorders.

Neural  correlates  of  self-referential  processing  are 
found  in  cortical  midline  structures  comprising  the 
default  mode  network  (DMN)  [40,  41].  The  DMN  is  an 
intrinsic  brain  network  that  exhibits  consistent  activa-
tion patterns during rest. Core regions include the poste-
rior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex 
(mPFC)  [42].  Increased  DMN  activity  and  connectivity 
during  self-referential  processing  have  been  observed 
in neuroimaging studies of persons with depression and 
their  (at-risk)  relatives  [43,  44].  Moreover,  DMN  hyper-
activity during self-referential processing has been found 
to correlate with elevated levels of internalizing problems 
in  (at-risk)  children  and  youth  [45].  MBIs  may  alleviate 
internalizing  problems  by  reducing  excessive  self-focus 
and modulating activity and connectivity of self-referen-
tial  brain  circuits,  including  DMN. Through  the  process 
of  decentering,  mindfulness  training  is  thought  to  pro-
mote a shift from (excessive) narrative self-focus to more 
present-centered  experiential  awareness.  This  voluntary 
and  effortful  process  may  increase  top-down  prefron-
tal control over brain regions involved in self-referential 
processing [46]. In line with this hypothesis, Brewer et al. 
[47]  observed  reduced  activation  of  key  DMN  nodes 
(medial  prefrontal  and  posterior  cingulate  cortex)  in 
experienced  meditators,  compared  to  meditation-naïve 
controls  during  resting-state  functional  magnetic  reso-
nance  imaging  (fMRI),  along  with  stronger  functional 
connectivity between posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior 
cingulate,  and  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortices.  Using  a 
Self-Referent Encoding Task (SRET [48]) conducted dur-
ing fMRI scanning, the current study will assess self-ref-
erential processing and its neural correlates, as a function 
of  internalizing  problems  and  mindfulness  training,  in 
help-seeking youth. Specific hypotheses for the SRET and 
associated  fMRI  data  have  been  preregistered  (https:// 
aspre dicted. org/ v4qt2. pdf ).

Another  process 

in  emerging  (inter-
implicated 
nalizing)  psychopathology  is  experiential  avoidance 
[49–51].  Experiential  avoidance  refers  to  an  unwilling-
ness to stay in contact with unpleasant internal experi-
ences  (e.g.  thoughts,  emotions,  bodily  sensations)  and 
attempts  to  alter  or  suppress  them  [52].  Although  the 
avoidance  of  unwanted  inner  experiences  may  allevi-
ate  distress  in  the  short-term,  it  tends  to  exacerbate 
problems in the long run [53, 54]. Current evidence on 
experiential  avoidance  relies  predominantly  on  self-
report measures, which are limited by subjective biases. 
To gain more comprehensive insights into this process, 
combining self-report with more objective measures is 
important.  The  current  study  complements  self-report 
measures  with  an  experimental  paradigm  designed  to 

 Schepers et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:126 

Page 4 of 18

assess behavioral action biases in the context of aversive 
stimuli  [55].  Assessing  the  presence  and  direction  of 
such biases in help-seeking youth may help clarify how 
aversive action biases, as part of the putative underlying 
process  of  experiential  avoidance,  contribute  internal-
izing  mental  illness  development.  The  corresponding 
hypotheses  are  described  in  the  preregistration  of  this 
task (https:// aspre dicted. org/ ui9uf. pdf ).

Excessive  (or  otherwise  aberrant)  aversive  avoid-
ance  biases  and  internalizing  problems  may  stem  from 
abnormalities  in  the  Pavlovian  system  (cf.  [56–58]). The 
interaction  between  Pavlovian  and  instrumental  con-
trol  systems  is  key  for  adaptive  motivated  behavior  and 
contributes  to  various  neuropsychiatric  disorders  [59]. 
Pavlovian-to-Instrumental  Transfer  (PIT)  occurs  when 
classically  conditioned  Pavlovian  stimuli,  predicting 
rewarding  or  punishing  outcomes,  motivate  or  inhibit 
instrumental, goal-oriented behaviors [60, 61]. In recent 
years, there has been a growing interest in PIT paradigms 
for  understanding  healthy  behavior  [60]  as  well  as  psy-
chopathology  [59,  62].  However,  relatively  few  studies 
have been conducted in internalizing disorders [59]. First 
studies suggest that the inhibitory motivational effect of 
aversive cues on approach behaviors is either similar [63] 
or  increased  [64]  in  depressed  individuals  compared  to 
healthy  controls.  Moreover,  the  differential  motivating 
impact  of  the  same  Pavlovian  cues  on  withdrawal  com-
pared to approach actions may be predictive of sympto-
matic  recovery  in  depression  [63].  In  the  current  study, 
a PIT paradigm will be used to examine how PIT effects 
are  related  to  internalizing  problems  and  how  they  are 
influenced  by  mindfulness  training.  The  preregistra-
tion of this task can be consulted for an overview of the 
hypotheses (https:// aspre dicted. org/ j7r7- 82w5. pdf ).

Finally, 

internalizing  symptom  development  may 
involve a reduced ability to estimate the controllability of 
the environment. Evidence from work with experimental 
animals indicates that exposure to uncontrollable stress-
ors  induces  passivity  and  a  failure  to  escape  subsequent 
stressors, which does not occur when stressors are con-
trollable [65]. A perceived lack of control over stressors is 
thought to lead to a failure to learn, a phenomenon called 
“learned  helplessness,”  which  has  been  widely  studied. 
Learned  helplessness  has  been  associated  with  psycho-
pathology  and  is  known  to  be  enhanced  in  depression 
and  anxiety  disorders  [66,  67].  Furthermore,  it  has  been 
observed  that  task  controllability  estimates  are  lower  in 
highly  anxious  individuals,  especially  after  exposure  to 
inescapable  stress  [68].  In  the  current  study,  an  estab-
lished  paradigm  is  used  to  measure  controllability  esti-
mation  [68].  An  overview  of  the  hypotheses  is  provided 
in the corresponding preregistration (https:// aspre dicted. 
org/ js5bx. pdf ).

Mindfulness‑based early intervention in help‑seeking 
youth

Early  intervention  is  crucial  to  improve  outcomes  in 
mental  illness.  This  goal  requires  improved  understand-
ing  of  the  differential  stages  of  emerging  mental  illness 
and  associated  neural  and  cognitive  processes.  The  cur-
rent  randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT)  aims  to  deter-
mine  (1)  how  early-stage  MBI  impacts  internalizing 
problems,  and  their  potential  development  into  more 
serious mental illness, in help-seeking youth. In addition, 
(2) by investigating associated clinical measures and cog-
nitive  processes  implicated  in  (internalizing)  mental  ill-
ness, including self-referential processing, this study aims 
to  determine  how  these  processes  contribute  to  mental 
illness development and whether they can be modulated 
by  MBI.  Furthermore,  neuroimaging  data  is  acquired  to 
(3)  examine  neural  correlates  of  self-referential  process-
ing  and  assess  structural  and  functional  brain  network 
connectivity.

Methods
Design

This  study  constitutes  a  single-blind,  two-arm  RCT  that 
has been approved by the regional medical research eth-
ics  committee  (MREC  Oost-Nederland),  see  Fig.  1  for 
an  overview  of  the  recruitment  and  study  procedure. 
Participants  are  randomized  to  either  the  intervention 
group,  which  receives  an  8-week  MBI  program  as  add-
on  to  care-as-usual  (CAU),  or  the  CAU-only  control 
group.  Upon  completion  of  the  informed  consent  pro-
cedure,  participants  undergo  a  general  screening  and 
a  structured  diagnostic  interview  Mini  International 
Neuropsychiatric  Interview  Simplified  for  DSM5  –  NL 
(MINI-S-DSM-5-NL)  administered  in  Dutch  by  a  (resi-
dent) psychiatrist to assess DSM-5 criteria and determine 
eligibility  for  participation  in  the  study  according  to  the 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  Included  participants 
then  complete  the  baseline  assessment  (T0)  including 
self-report  questionnaires,  (f )MRI  scanning,  and  a  set 
of  computerized  cognitive  behavioral  tasks.  After  data 
collection  at  T0,  participants  are  randomly  assigned 
to  MBI + CAU  or  CAU-only.  Following  the  MBI,  or 
approximately  three  months  after  T0  for  the  CAU-only 
group, participants complete an end of treatment assess-
ment (T1). At T1, the self-report questionnaires, (f )MRI 
scanning,  and  cognitive  behavioral  tasks  are  repeated. 
Approximately eight weeks after the end of the MBI, par-
ticipants assigned to the MBI + CAU group are offered a 
booster session to refresh skills acquired during training 
and  to  troubleshoot  any  potential  issues  that  may  have 
risen  during  self-practice  in  the  weeks  since  completing 
the training program. Follow-up measurements for both 
groups are conducted at approximately two months and

assess mental illness development as per DSM-5 criteria 
over the course of the study and a final set of self-report 
questionnaires  is  administered.  When  completing  the 
study, participants assigned to the CAU-only group have 
the option to participate in the MBI. Upon finishing the 
training, these participants are invited to complete a set 
of  questionnaires  (T4),  comprising  the  same  set  of  self-
report questionnaires as those administered at T2.

Throughout  the  study,  participants  are  regularly  con-
tacted  to  schedule  sessions  and  receive  email  reminders 
to ensure completion of assessments and maintain reten-
tion. To further support retention, all participants receive 
a  newsletter  twice  during  the  study  period  (between  T0 
and T1, and between T2 and T3) with trial updates and 
knowledge  insights  related  to  the  study  topic.  For  par-
ticipants  in  the  MBI + CAU  group,  the  newsletter  also 
includes  information  on  mindfulness  and  its  poten-
tial  benefits  to  encourage  adherence  to  the  mindfulness 
practice.

Study population

The target population for this RCT is youth between 16 
and 25 years of age who consult primary (mental) health 
services  because  of  mental  health  complaints,  and  who 
have  no  lifetime  diagnosis  of  serious  mental  illness  (for 
definition,  see  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  below). 
Primary (mental) health care providers may include gen-
eral practitioners, practice nurses, student psychologists, 
and student support services in the Nijmegen area in the 
Netherlands.  Participants  are  required  to  have  an  ade-
quate mastery of the Dutch language and should be able 
to  provide  written  informed  consent.  Participants  are 
excluded if they (1) have a lifetime diagnosis of a schizo-
phrenia  spectrum  or  other  psychotic  disorder,  bipolar 
disorder,  severe  MDD,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD), or any personality disorder, (2) have a history of 
a  major  medical  or  neurological  illness,  (3)  participated 
in a formal mindfulness training program in the past year, 
(4) currently participate in another intervention study, (5) 
have  current  moderate  to  severe  substance  abuse  disor-
der,  (6)  experience  current  active  suicidality,  or  (7)  have 
diagnosed  or  suspected  (mild)  intellectual  impairment 
(estimated  IQ < 75).  Individuals  with  contraindications 
for  or  objections  against  magnetic  resonance  imaging 
(MRI; e.g., ferrous objects in or around the body or claus-
trophobia)  can  participate  in  the  study;  these  individu-
als  complete  only  the  clinical  and  cognitive-behavioral 
assessments.

Sample size calculation

The  sample  size  was  calculated  to  ensure  sufficient 
power  to  detect  significant  group-differences  from  T0 
to T1 in the primary outcome measure: i.e., internalizing 

Fig. 1  Recruitment and assessment procedure. A basic screening 
for inclusion and exclusion criteria is performed over telephone prior 
to study participation. During the baseline visit (T0), participants 
undergo a general screening and a structured diagnostic interview 
to test for eligibility and assess classifications according to DSM-5. 
Assessments take place at baseline (T0), end of treatment 
(T1; ± 3 months after baseline), 2-months follow-up (T2; ± 5 months 
after baseline) and 6-months follow-up (T3; ± 9 months 
after baseline). Participants assigned to the CAU-only group who 
participate in the MBI after T3 are invited to complete a small subset 
of questionnaires upon finishing the training (T4; not shown in this 
figure). IC = Informed Consent; MBI = Mindfulness Based Intervention;

Imaging

six  months  after  completion  of  the  MBI.  The  2-months 
follow-up assessment (T2) involves a subset of self-report 
questionnaires to be completed at home, assessing inter-
nalizing  problems,  rumination,  self-compassion,  and 
well-being.  At  6-months  follow-up  (T3),  the  structured 
diagnostic interview (MINI-S-DSM-5-NL) is repeated to

problems  measured  with  broadband  internalizing  sub-
scale of the Adult Self Report (ASR) [69]. The estimated 
effect  size  for  the  power  analysis  was  d = 0.4,  based  on 
a  meta-analysis  of  MBIs  in  youth,  reporting  an  aver-
age effect of MBIs on internalizing problems of g = 0.392 
across  29  controlled  studies  including  almost  3000  par-
ticipants  [23].  Given  that most  of  these studies involved 
non-clinical,  school-based  samples  (with  lower  variance 
in internalizing problems), this effect size is expected to 
be  a  conservative  estimate  for  the  target  population  of 
help-seeking  youth,  as  transdiagnostic  clinical  samples 
tend to report effect sizes in the 0.40 s and 0.50 s range 
(e.g., [70]). The required sample size for the current trial 
was  calculated  with  correction  for  correlations  between 
internalizing  problems  at  baseline  and  end  of  treatment 
[71],  as  test–retest  reliability  of  the  ASR  is  in  the  0.80  s 
and  0.90  s  range  [69]  and  repeated  measurements  of 
internalizing  problems  in  adolescents  at  one-year  inter-
vals  have  been  reported  in  the  0.50  s  and  0.60  s  range 
[72].  Given  that  the  assessment  interval  in  the  current 
study  is  much  shorter  at  2  months,  0.65  was  taken  as  a 
reasonable  estimate  of  the  correlation  in  internalizing 
problems  between  baseline  and  end  of  treatment.  Clus-
tering of data in the intervention arm is accounted for, as 
mindfulness  training  is  given  in  groups.  Based  on  prior 
research in the Radboudumc Expertise Center for Mind-
fulness (cf. [73]) demonstrating low intraclass coefficients 
(ICC)  in  large  multicenter  trials,  the  clustering  effect  in 
the current single-center trial is anticipated to be small at 
ρ = 0.01. The  design  effect  (DE),  also  known  as  the  vari-
ance inflation ratio, is calculated to account for clustering 
in the data and its impact on the variance of the estimate 
[74]. With group sizes of around 9 participants on aver-
age and no expected change in standard deviation of the 
outcome due to the intervention, the design effect for this 
design is .62, given by:

where  σ  is  the  standard  deviation  (SD)  in  the  interven-
tion group (subscript 1), control group (subscript 0) and 
of  both  groups  at  baseline  (base)  [75].  The  sample  size 
for a post-test design (only follow-up measurement) with 
80% power and two-sided significance testing at p < 0.05 
is 200 subjects. Multiplying with the above design effect 
yields  124  subjects.  With  a  conservative  drop-out  rate 
of  around  20%  (based  on  clinical  trial  experience  at  the 
Radboud  Expertise  Center  for  Mindfulness),  a  total  of 
N = 124/0.8 = 155  youth  (i.e.,  approximately  N = 78  per 

group,  effective  sample  size  of  N = 124  participants) 
will  be  recruited.  Based  on  consultations  with  regional 
mental  health  care  providers,  a  sufficiently  large  source 
population  for  the  recruitment  of  study  participants  is 
anticipated.

Intervention

The investigational treatment is an 8-week mindfulness 
program  that  combines  the  core  elements  of  Mind-
fulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR)  [76,  77]  and 
MBCT  [78]  with  mindful  physical  activity  and  yoga  in 
every  session,  as  implemented  in  the  Mindful2Work 
program  [79,  80].  The  combined  program  called  the 
“Learning  to  Offset  Stress”  (in  Dutch:  Leren  Omgaan 
met Stress) (LOS) training, was first developed in 2019 
as a clinical program for adolescents with internalizing 
problems  by  de  Bruin  and  colleagues  at  UvA  minds,  a 
youth  and  family  treatment  center  affiliated  with  the 
University  of  Amsterdam  (UvA),  in  liaison  with  the 
municipality  of  Amsterdam.  In  2022,  the  program  was 
piloted and adapted to accommodate the needs of help-
seeking youth up to 25 years of age at the Radboudumc 
Center  of  Expertise  for  Mindfulness  (Nijmegen,  the 
Netherlands).  The  LOS  program  consists  of  8  weekly 
2-h  training  sessions  that  each  include  approximately 
15 min of mindful active movement (i.e., jogging, boot-
camp exercises), 15 min of yoga, and 90 min of mindful-
ness exercises, inquiry, psychoeducation, and cognitive 
therapy  elements.  The  program  also  includes  compas-
sion elements such as a kindness meditation, modelled 
after practices from “Mindfulness: A practical guide to 
finding  peace  in  a  frantic  world”  [81].  Participants  are 
encouraged  to  engage  in  a  range  of  at-home  exercises 
including daily mindfulness practices for approximately 
20  min  per  day,  with  audio  support.  They  receive  a 
workbook tailored in language and style to youth, with 
week titles kept purposefully short, accessible language, 
and frequent use of figures. The LOS program does not 
include an all-day silent retreat. See Table 1 for an over-
view of the training protocol (a more detailed overview 
of  the  training  program  and  at-home  exercises  can  be 
found  in  Supplementary  Table  1).  The  LOS  training  is 
administered  by  qualified  mindfulness  trainers  who 
meet  criteria  of  the  Dutch  professional  association  of 
mindfulness-based  trainers  (Vereniging  Mindfulness 
Based  trainers  Nederland;  VMBN,  https:// www. vmbn. 
nl).  Training  sessions  are  videotaped  for  treatment 
integrity purposes. For each mindfulness trainer, a ran-
dom selection of video recordings will be used to assess 
competency  using  the  Mindfulness-Based  Interven-
tions: Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI:TAC [82]).

Randomization and blinding procedures
Participants are randomly assigned to either MBI + CAU 
or  CAU-only.  Randomization  is  conducted  at  the  end 
of  T0,  and  participants  are  informed  about  group  allo-
cation  immediately.  The  randomization  procedure  is 
performed  by  CastorEDC,  an  Electronic  Data  Capture 
program  (www. casto redc. com),  and  includes  stratified, 
variable  block  randomization.  Stratification  factors  are 
sex  (M/F)  and  education  level:  vocational  education  vs. 
(applied) academic education. Stratification is performed 
because of sex-differences in the prevalence and severity 
of internalizing problems [83, 84] and underrepresenta-
tion of men and lower-educated individuals in mindful-
ness trials, in order to prevent unbalanced groups.

The Castor EDC system allows for blinded (concealed) 
randomization.  Clinical  outcome  assessors  (including 
PL)  will  be  blinded  to  intervention  allocation  to  ensure 
unbiased  outcome  assessment.  For  pragmatic  reasons, 
it  is  not  possible  to  keep  other  researchers  blinded,  as 
they  are  involved  in  performing  group  allocation  and 
in  participant  communication.  Blinded  researchers  are 
informed  of  group  allocation  after  the  structured  diag-
nostic interview and self-report questionnaires at T3 are 
finalized. Unblinding is considered in case of (suspected) 
occurrence  of  an  adverse  event  (AE)  or  serious  adverse 
event  (SAE).  In  this  case,  clinical  assessors  consult  with 
the principal investigator (GC) or senior advisor (AS) to 
determine  if  unblinding  is  deemed  necessary  for  safety 
reasons.  If  an  outcome  assessor  is  unblinded,  any  sub-
sequent outcome assessments are performed by another 
(blinded)  outcome  assessor.  Participants  are  instructed 
not to disclose their group allocation to clinical outcome 
assessors  until  after  their  final  assessment.  Participants 
can direct potential questions regarding their group allo-
cation  to  researchers  not  involved  in  clinical  outcome 
assessments or to one of the mindfulness trainers.

Clinical assessments

Table  2  provides  an  overview  of  assessments  per 
timepoint.

Structured diagnostic interview

The  presence  of  psychiatric  disorders  is  assessed  using 
the MINI-S-DSM5-NL, through Castor EDC. This struc-
tured diagnostic interview is conducted at T0 and T3 by 
a  (resident)  psychiatrist.  Participants  who  meet  lifetime 
DSM-5  criteria  for  a  psychotic  disorder,  bipolar  disor-
der, or PTSD at baseline are excluded from the study. If a 
participant meets criteria for MDD or substance use dis-
order, the (resident) psychiatrist clinically assesses sever-
ity.  Participants  with  mild  to  moderate  symptoms  are 
included;  those  with  severe  symptoms  are  excluded  and 
referred to their own mental health care provider. Suici-
dality is assessed separately; participants with active cur-
rent suicidality or any prior suicide attempt are excluded 
and referred to their own mental health care provider.

Questionnaires

All self-report questionnaire data is acquired using Cas-
tor EDC.

Internalizing  problems  are 
Primary  outcome  measure 
measured  using  the  broadband  internalizing  subscale  of 
the Adult Self Report (ASR [69]). This self-report inven-
tory  contains  126  items  comprising  eight  syndrome 
scales:  anxious/depressed,  withdrawn,  somatic  com-
plaints, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive 
behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and intrusive behavior. 
The  broadband  “internalizing  problems”  scale  is  com-
puted  as  the  sum  of  scores  on  anxious/depressed,  with-
drawn,  and  somatic  complaints  syndrome  scales  [69]. 
Items are rated on a 3-point scale: 0-Not True, 1-Some-
what or Sometimes True, 2-Very True or Often True and

concern the past 6 months. The internalizing scale of the 
ASR has a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) 
and  test–retest  reliability  of  the  ASR  is  in  the  .80s  and 
.90s [85, 86].

Secondary outcome measures  Self-compassion is meas-
ured  using  the  Self-Compassion  Scale  (SCS).  The  origi-
nal SCS developed by Neff [87] comprises 26 items. The 
Dutch  version  of  the  SCS,  however,  excludes  two  items 
due  to  translation  challenges,  resulting  in  24  items  in 

total  [88].  Items  are  scored  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale 
with total scores ranging from 24 to 168. The SCS has a 
good test–retest reliability and high internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α = 0.86) [89].

Rumination is measured using the Rumination-Reflec-
tion Questionnaire (RRQ) brooding subscale, which con-
tains 12 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale with total 
scores ranging from 12 to 60 [90]. The brooding subscale 
of  the  RRQ  has  a  high  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s 
α = 0.91) [91, 92].

The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire – II (AAQ-
II  [93])  is  used  to  measure  experiential  avoidance.  The 
AAQ-II  consists  of  10  items,  scored  on  a  7-point  Likert 
scale with total scores ranging from 10 to 70, with higher 
scores indicating greater levels of experiential avoidance. 
The mean alpha coefficient for the AAQ-II is 0.84 (0.78 – 
0.88). The  3-month  test–retest  reliability  is  0.81  and  the 
test–retest reliability at 12 months is 0.79 [93].

Emotional  and  social  well-being  is  measured  using  the 
Mental Health Continuum – Short Form (MHC-SF [94]). 
This 14-item questionnaire uses a 6-point Likert scale and 
total scores range from 0 to 70. The internal consistency 
for the MHC-SF is high (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) [95, 96].

Other  outcome  measures  Mindfulness  skills  are  meas-
ured  using  the  Five  Facets  of  Mindfulness  Question-
naire  -  Short  Form  (FFMQ  –  SF  [97]).  This  24-item 
questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale and total scores 
range  from  24  to  120.  Internal  consistency  is  high  with 
Cronbach’s  α  ranging  from  0.73  to  0.91  for  the  differ-
ent  subscales.  Test–retest  reliability  is  good  for  sub-
scales  describing  and  acting  with  awareness  (r = 0.74 
and  r = 0.61,  respectively)  and  fair  for  subscales  observ-
ing,  non-judging,  and  non-reactivity  (r = 0.54,  r = 0.55, 
r = 0.59, respectively) [98].

Perceived stress is measured using the Perceived Stress 
Scale  –  10  items  (PSS-10  [99]).  The  PSS  uses  a  5-point 
Likert scale, with total scores ranging from 0 to 40. The 
scale has a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α. = 0.74 
–  0.91)  and  good  test–retest  reliability  (r = 0.71  –  0.88) 
[100].

Global  self-esteem  is  measured  using  the  Rosenberg 
Self-Esteem  Scale  (RSES  [101]).  The  RSES  is  a  10-item 
questionnaire  that  uses  a  4-point  Likert  scale  with  total 
scores  ranging  from  10  to  40.  The  questionnaire  has  a 
good  internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.72  –  0.87) 
and test–retest reliability (r = 0.85) [102, 103].

The  Adaptive  Self-Concept  Questionnaire  (ASCQ 
[104])  assesses  properties  of  the  self-concept  associ-
ated  with  adaptability.  It  consists  of  25  items  that  are 
scored on a 6-point Likert scale. The internal consistency 
is  high  for  4  out  of  5  subscales,  including  clarity  of  the 

Schepers et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:126

self-concept  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.75),  non-ruminative  self-
awareness  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.88),  openness  to  self-rele-
vant information (Cronbach’s α = 0.79), and modifiability 
of  the  self-concept  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.78),  and  moderate 
for the self-distance subscale (Cronbach’s α = 0.65) [104].

Resilience  is  measured  using  the  Connor-Davidson 
Resilience  Scale  –  10  items  (CD-RISC-10  [105]).  This 
questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale, and total scores 
range from 0 to 40. The CD-RISC-10 has a high internal 
consistency  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.94)  and  high  test–retest 
reliability (r = 0.88) [106].

At  home  mindfulness  practice  for  the  MBI + CAU 
participants  is  assessed  using  the  Mindfulness  Adher-
ence Questionnaire (MAQ [107]). The MAQ is a 12-item 
questionnaire that assesses quality and quantity of formal 
and  quality  of  informal  mindfulness  practice  in  the  past 
week.  Items  are  scored  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  rang-
ing from 0 (never) to 6 (always). The MAQ has adequate 
internal  consistency  (Cronbach’s  α = 0.79)  [108].  For  the 
current study, questions were adapted to capture average 
practice per week since the previous study assessment.

Climate  anxiety  is  screened  for  at  T0  using  two  ques-
tions  from  a  recent  global  survey  on  climate  anxiety  in 
youth [4].

Digital screen time is estimated by asking participants 
to retrieve their mobile phone and look up their average 
daily  screen  time  directly  from  the  screen  time  settings 
on their phones. Average screentime is based on the days 
of  the  last  full  week  registered  by  their  phones.  Using 
screen time settings, participants are asked to provide the 
percentage of their total screen time that is dedicated to 
social media usage.

Lastly,  all  participants  provide  information  regarding 
the care they received both prior to and during the study 
as part of their care-as-usual (CAU). At T0, a broad his-
tory of the participant’s (mental) health care is obtained, 
along with a detailed assessment of CAU received in the 
three  months  prior  to  the  study.  At  T1  and  T3,  mental 
health care use is assessed for the period from T0 to T1 
and  from  T1  to  T3,  respectively.  At  each  of  these  time 
point (T0, T1 and T3), recorded information includes the 
type  of  caregiver  (e.g.,  psychologist,  nurse  practitioner), 
the form of treatment (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy), 
the  frequency  and  duration  of  sessions,  as  well  as  the 
start date and, if applicable, the end date of treatment.

Cognitive behavioral assessments

Cognitive  behavioral  tasks  are  administered  at  T0  and 
T1  at  the  Donders  Centre  for  Cognitive  Neuroimaging 
(DCCN).  A  schematic  overview  with  experimental  task 
designs of the cognitive behavioral tasks implemented in 
the current study can be found in Fig. 2. First, a Self-Ref-
erent  Encoding  Task  (SRET)  is  performed  partly  in  the 

MRI scanner (endorsement phase) and partly in a behav-
ioral  lab  (free  recall  and  recognition  phase). The  second 
task  is  an  Escape/Avoid  Go/No-Go  task,  conducted 
in  a  behavioral  lab.  Two  additional  tasks,  a  Pavlovian-
to-instrumental  transfer  (PIT)  task  and  Control  Belief 
Updating (CBU) task, are optional and offered online to 
be completed at home within one week after the respec-
tive visit (T0 or T1). Each task is pre-registered separately 
on  AsPredicted.com,  outlining  hypotheses  and  analysis 
plans per task.

Self‑Referent Encoding Task (SRET)

Biases  in  self-referential  processing  are  measured  using 
a SRET (cf. [48]) (https:// aspre dicted. org/ v4qt2. pdf ), see 
Fig.  2a.  Expyriment,  a  Python  library  for  cognitive  and 
neuroscientific experiments [109], is used to present task 
stimuli  and  assess  behavioral  responses  (e.g.  reaction 
times).  In  the  MRI-scanner  (or  behavioral  lab  for  par-
ticipants  who  are  not  MRI-eligible),  participants  view  a 
series of positive and negative trait adjectives (e.g., kind, 
friendly,  lazy,  boring).  For  each  word,  participants  are 
asked  to  indicate  whether  or  not  (yes/no)  the  adjective 
describes  them  (self-condition),  their  best  friend  (other-
condition)  or  whether  the  adjective  is  a  positive  trait  or 
not  (semantic  condition).  Directly  following  completion 
of  the  endorsement  phase,  participants  are  taken  out  of 
the scanner and transferred to a behavioral lab to perform 
the free recall phase in which they are asked to recall as 
many  words  from  the  SRET  endorsement  phase  as  they 
can  remember.  Finally,  during  the  recognition  phase, 
participants are presented with trait adjectives on a com-
puter  screen  (both  familiar  words  and  new  “distractor” 
words)  and  are  asked  to  indicate  (yes/no)  whether  they 
recall seeing the adjective before. Negativity biases in the 
context of the SRET are defined as greater endorsement 
of, and memory for, negative trait adjectives as compared 
to positive trait adjectives.

Escape/Avoid Go/No‑Go Task

Escape and avoidance biases are explored using an estab-
lished  Escape/Avoid  Go/No-Go  task  [55,  110]  (https:// 
aspre dicted. org/ ui9uf. pdf ),  see  Fig.  2b. This  task  quanti-
fies  the  bias  to  invigorate  responding  when  attempting 
to  escape  from  aversive  stimuli,  and  the  bias  to  inhibit 
responding  when  trying  to  avoid  aversive  stimuli.  Par-
ticipants learn to either make or withhold a response to 
escape from or avoid an aversive auditory stimulus. Each 
trial begins with a cue/response phase, in which a visual 
cue  (fractal  image)  is  presented.  On  Escape  trials,  an 
aversive sound is played (80–85 dB through headphones) 
together  with  the  visual  cue.  On  avoid  trials,  cue  pres-
entation  is  accompanied  by  silence.  During  cue  presen-
tation,  participants  can  either  make  a  response  (Go)  or

Fig. 2  Overview of experimental designs for the cognitive behavioral tasks in the PRYME study. Panel A illustrates the Self-Referent Encoding Task 
(SRET), panel B the Escape/avoid Go/No-Go task, panel C the Pavlovian-to-instrumental Transfer (PIT) task, and panel D the Control Belief Updating 
(CBU) task (UC = Uncontrollable Condition, CC = Controllable Condition). The SRET and Escape/Avoid Go/No-Go task are administered at T0 
and T1. The SRET involves three phases: an endorsement phase, completed in the MRI scanner, and a free recall and recognition phase, performed 
outside the scanner in a behavioral lab. During the ‘other’ condition of the endorsement phase, the name of the participant’s best friend is displayed 
on the screen. The Escape/Avoid Go/No-Go task is fully performed in a behavioral lab. The PIT and CBU tasks are an optional and are offered online 
to be completed at home within one week after the respective visit (T0 or T1). Detailed descriptions for each cognitive behavioral task can be found 
in the Methods section

withhold a response (No-Go). The task has a 2×2 design 
with two stimuli for each condition (Escape/Avoid), and 
two stimuli for each required response (Go/NoGo). For a 
go-to-avoid cue, the participant should make a response 
to avoid the sound from coming on, while for a no-go-to-
avoid cue, the participant should refrain from responding 
to  avoid  the  sound  from  coming  on.  For  a  go-to-escape 
cue,  the  participant  should  make  a  response  to  silence 
the  aversive  sound,  whereas  for  a  no-go-to-escape  cue, 
the  participant  should  withhold  responding  to  silence 
the aversive sound. Cue presentation is followed by feed-
back:  if  the  response  was  correct,  this  is  followed  by 
silence. However, feedback is probabilistic; for each cue, 
on approximately 20% of the trials, the unpleasant sound 
is played even if the correct response was made, and vice 
versa for incorrect responses, with silence for 20% of tri-
als.  PsychoPy,  an  open  source  software  package  for  cre-
ating  behavioral  experiments  [111]  (version  2022.2.5), 
is  used  to  present  task  stimuli  and  assess  behavioral 
responses (e.g. reaction times, response accuracy).

Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task

A Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task is admin-
istered  to  assess  the  influence  of  Pavlovian  stimuli  on 
goal-directed instrumental behavior (https:// aspre dicted. 
org/ j7r7- 82w5. pdf ), see Fig. 2c. The paradigm consists of 
(1)  an  instrumental  learning  phase;  (2)  a  Pavlovian  con-
ditioning phase; and (3) a PIT phase. In the instrumental 
learning  phase,  participants  are  presented  with  instru-
mental stimuli (i.e., mushrooms or shells) and learn stim-
ulus-specific  associations  between  Go/No-Go  actions 
and outcomes. The task consists of two action conditions: 
an approach and a withdrawal condition. In the approach 
condition, participants must make a ‘Go’ response to col-
lect  ‘Good’  mushrooms/shells;  in  the  withdrawal  condi-
tion, participants have to make a ‘Go’ response to discard 
‘Bad’  mushrooms/shells.  Next,  in  the  Pavlovian  con-
ditioning  phase,  a  neutral  stimulus  (i.e.,  a  background 
fractal) is paired with a reward or punishment (i.e., win-
ning or losing points, combined with “happy” high tones 
or  “sad”  low  tones  respectively)  or  kept  neutral  (i.e.,  no

winning  or  losing  of  points  and  a  neutral  tone),  thereby 
creating  appetitive,  aversive,  and  neutral  stimuli.  Lastly, 
in  the  PIT  phase,  previously  learned  instrumental  trials 
are  combined  with  the  now  paired  aversive,  appetitive, 
and  neutral  stimuli  shown  in  the  background.  The  PIT 
effect  is  defined  as  the  difference  between  instrumental 
responding, which is operationalized as the proportion of 
‘Go’ actions in the presence of neutral cues compared to 
instrumental responding in the presence of either appeti-
tive or aversive cues in approach and withdrawal condi-
tions.  This  task  is  offered  in  an  online  format  using  the 
web-based  Gorilla  Experiment  Builder  (www. goril la. sc) 
[112]  as  an  optional  part  of  the  study  and  can  be  com-
pleted by participants at home at their own time within 
one week after the respective visit.

the pink boat, will you go to the lighthouse or the harbor? 
Note that in the UC rule, the correct answer is lighthouse 
on  both  trials,  while  in  the  CC  rule  the  correct  answers 
are (1) harbor and (2) lighthouse. These prediction trials 
are used to infer if participants think the environment is 
controllable or not. If participants think it is controllable, 
they  should  answer  differently  on  the  two  trials.  If  par-
ticipants  instead  think  it  is  uncontrollable,  they  should 
answer  with  the  same  response  on  both  trials.  The  cur-
rent  paradigm  allows  us  to  index  both  the  average  ten-
dency to perceive the task environment as controllable or 
uncontrollable, as well as the ability to flexibly update this 
belief about control when the task environment changes 
from  controllable  to  uncontrollable  or  vice  versa.  The 
task is implemented using jsPsych [113] (version 7.3.0).

Control Belief Updating (CBU) task

Participants  are  also  invited  to  engage  in  an  online  task 
designed to measure the ability to flexibly update beliefs 
about  task  controllability  (https:// aspre dicted. org/ js5bx. 
pdf ),  see  Fig.  2d.  This  task  is  based  on  an  explore-and-
predict  paradigm  developed  by  Ligneul  et  al.  [68],  in 
which  participants  are  presented  with  a  sequence  of 
destinations  (i.e.,  a  lighthouse,  an  island  or  a  harbor; 
presented one at a time), and each destination is accom-
panied by two differently colored boats (pink, blue or yel-
low). Participants are instructed to figure out whether the 
transition to the next destination depends on which boat 
they  chose.  The  key  experimental  manipulation  is  task 
controllability, which corresponds to the degree to which 
their  actions  (that  is,  their  choice  between  the  boats) 
determines  the  transitions  between  destinations.  Task 
controllability alternates between two types of transition 
blocks. In the uncontrollable blocks (uncontrollable con-
dition; UC), state-state transitions do not depend on the 
actions of the participant; it does not matter which boat 
the participant choses, the next destination is determined 
by  the  current  destination  (i.e.  lighthouse  follows  after 
island). Conversely, in the controllable blocks (controlla-
ble condition, CC), the next destination does depend on 
which  boat  was  chosen  by  the  participant  (state-action-
state,  i.e.  yellow  boat  goes  to  the  harbor).  UC  and  CC 
rules switch during the task, so that UC and CC phases 
alternate, and the goal for the participant is to figure out 
which rule they think is currently active by exploring the 
environment.  To  increase  the  difficulty  of  the  task,  10% 
transition noise is introduced. After 4 to 6 trials of explo-
ration, participants are asked to predict the next destina-
tion given a specific current destination and a boat during 
so  called  prediction  trials.  In  the  prediction  trial  exam-
ple in Fig. 2d, participants are asked (1) if you are at the 
island and take the yellow boat, will you go to the light-
house or the harbor? (2) If you are at the island and take 

Neuroimaging

MRI images are acquired using a Siemens Skyra 3T MR 
system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), with a 32-channel 
receiver head coil.

High  resolution  T1-weighted  magnetization-prepared 
rapid  gradient  echo  (MPRAGE)  anatomical  images  are 
acquired  to  assess  morphometry  and  for  co-registration 
and normalization purposes (TR: 2300 ms, TE: 3.03 ms, 
FA:  8°,  voxel  size:  1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0  mm,  FOV:  256 × 256  x 
192  mm,  GRAPPA  acceleration  factor:  2;  acquisition 
time: 5m21s).

Functional  EPI  images  are  acquired  using  the  same 
MRI sequence (multi-band 3, multi-echo 3, TR: 1500 ms, 
TE:  12.40  ms  /  34.30  ms  /  56.20  ms,  FA:  75°,  voxel  size: 
2.5 × 2.5 × 2.5  mm,  FOV:  210  mm,  number  of  volumes: 
325,  GRAPPA  acceleration  factor:  2).  Resting  state 
images will be acquired to assess resting-state functional 
connectivity  (rs-FC).  Participants  are  instructed  to  look 
at a fixation cross on a screen and let their mind wander, 
without  thinking  of  anything  specific  (acquisition  time: 
8m21s).  In  addition,  task-fMRI  will  be  obtained  during 
the endorsement phase of the SRET to assess changes in 
brain  activation  and  connectivity  during  self-referential 
processing,  relative  to  other-referential  and/or  semantic 
processing,  as  a  function  of  levels  of  internalizing  prob-
lems and changes following mindfulness training (acqui-
sition time: 19m28s).

Diffusion  weighted  images  (DWI)  scans  are  acquired 
to  assess  structural  connectivity  and  investigate  inter-
individual  differences  in  structural  connectivity  in  rela-
tion to rs-FC and symptom development. DWI data are 
acquired once, at T0 (or T1 if the scan was not success-
fully obtained at baseline), as no significant alterations in 
structural  connectivity  are  anticipated  between  T0  and 
T1.  Data  are  acquired  while  participants  view  part  of  a 
nature  documentary  (TR:  3320  ms,  TE:  93  ms,  FA:  90°,

voxel size: 1.9 × 1.9 × 1.9, diffusion directions: 131, B-val-
ues: 0 and 2000s/mm2, FOV: 212 mm, GRAPPA accelera-
tion factor: 2; acquisition time: 8m55s).

During all (f )MRI measurements, respiration and heart 
rate  signals  are  recorded  using  BrainVision  Recorder 
(Brain  Products;  Gliching,  Germany)  to  correct  MR 
images for physiological noise.

Statistical analyses
All  analyses  will  be  performed  on  an  intention-to-treat 
basis,  with  sensitivity  analyses  conducted  according  to 
a  per-protocol  approach.  Analysis  plans  for  the  cogni-
tive behavioral assessments are described in more detail 
in  separate  preregistrations,  which  will  be  referenced 
throughout.

Statistical analysis of primary outcome measure

The primary outcome measure is the level of internalizing 
problems as measured with the ASR broadband internal-
izing problems scale at timepoint T1. Effects of mindful-
ness training (MBI + CAU vs. CAU-only) on internalizing 
problems  will  be  assessed  using  a  linear-mixed  effects 
(LME)  model.  The  LME  will  contain  the  ASR  internal-
izing  score  as  the  dependent  variable.  The  fixed  effects 
in  the  model  are  treatment  (MBI + CAU  vs.  CAU-only) 
and timepoint (categorical variable with three categories: 
T1, T2, T3), and their interactions. In addition, baseline 
ASR internalizing score will be included in the model to 
control  for  possible  differences  in  baseline  scores.  Ran-
dom effects are included for training group (in interven-
tion arm only) and participant (nested in training group 
if  the  participant  is  in  the  intervention  arm).  The  effect 
of  training  group  will  be  evaluated  by  testing  whether 
the  variance  of  the  random  effect  is  significantly  differ-
ent from zero, and will be excluded from the model if the 
null hypothesis of zero variance cannot be rejected. The 
interaction between timepoint and treatment is included 
in  the  model  to  be  able  to  study  treatment  effects  that 
change  over  time.  Timepoint  T1  is  chosen  as  the  refer-
ence category. That means that the estimate of treatment 
main effect corresponds to the primary outcome of inter-
est:  whether  internalizing  scores  differ  between  treat-
ment  groups  at  end  of  treatment  (T1).  As  a  sensitivity 
analysis, possible confounds are assessed and accounted 
for by including covariates (e.g. age, sex, and level of edu-
cation at baseline) in the model.

Statistical analysis of secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcome measures

Key  secondary  clinical  outcomes,  in  order  of  estimated 
probability  of  showing  changes  in  response  to  mindful-
ness  training,  are  (1)  self-compassion,  (2)  rumination, 
(3)  experiential  avoidance,  and  (4)  well-being. These  are 

computed as (1) the total score on the SCS, (2) brooding 
subscale score of the RRQ, (3) total score on the AAQ-II, 
and (4) total score on the MHC-SF respectively. The same 
models used for the primary outcome will be applied to 
assess  the  effects  of  the  intervention  condition  on  these 
secondary  outcomes.  Following  recommended  strate-
gies  for  secondary  outcomes,  the  predefined  set  of  key 
secondary outcome measures will be tested for statistical 
significance  using  sequential  order  with  fixed  sequence 
testing to mitigate multiple comparisons [114]. The test-
ing chain will be broken once there is no significant dif-
ference  between  groups  (MBI + CAU  vs.  CAU-only)  for 
the contrast at T1.

Other outcome measures

Other  clinical  outcome  measures  will  be  reported  as 
exploratory  results.  These  include  mindfulness  skills 
(FFMQ),  perceived  stress  (PSS-10),  self-esteem  (RSES), 
adaptive  self-concept  (ASCQ),  resilience  (CD-RISC-10), 
and adherence (MAQ). The same models used for the pri-
mary and secondary outcome measures will be applied.

Statistical analysis of cognitive task and (f)MRI data
Self‑Referent Encoding task (SRET)

Endorsement,  recall  and  recognition  of  negative  and 
positive trait adjectives in the three experimental condi-
tions (self, other and semantic) will be used for behavio-
ral analysis. Repeated measurements of these data will be 
compared between experimental groups (MBI + CAU vs. 
CAU-only)  using  LME.  Details  on  the  analysis  are  out-
lined  in  the  preregistration  for  this  task  (https:// aspre 
dicted. org/ v4qt2. pdf ).

Escape/Avoid Go/No‑Go task

A  combination  of  logistic  mixed  regressions  and  com-
putational  modelling,  in  a  convergent  approach,  will  be 
used  to  address  hypotheses  for  the  Escape/Avoid  Go/
No-Go task. The same approach as in Scholz et al. [115] 
will  be  followed.  Further  details  on  the  analysis  can  be 
found in the corresponding preregistration (https:// aspre 
dicted. org/ ui9uf. pdf ).

Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task

General  Linear  Mixed-effects  Models  (GLMMs)  will 
be used to analyze the PIT task data. Depending on the 
research  question,  the  within-subject  factors  Pavlovian 
Valence (either 5 levels:  SP
– –, or 3 lev-
++
els;  appetitive,  neutral,  aversive),  Action  Context  (2  lev-
els: Approach/Withdrawal), Timepoint (2 levels: T0/T1), 
and between-subject ASR internalizing subscale and ASR 
internalizing subscale score change from T0 to T1 will be 
used as fixed effects. The preregistration for this task can

internalizing problems according to ASR, secondary clini-
cal outcome measures and changes in these measures from 
pre- to post-intervention (MBI + CAU vs. CAU-only).

Control Belief Updating (CBU) task

A  combination  of  logistic  mixed  regression  and  computa-
tional modeling, in a convergent approach, will be used to 
address hypotheses on the CBU task. For this purpose, the 
same approach as in Ligneul et al. [68] will be followed. Fur-
ther details on the analyses are described in the correspond-
ing preregistration (https:// aspre dicted. org/ js5bx. pdf).

fMRI analyses

Resting-state  fMRI  data  will  be  preprocessed  using 
fMRIPrep,  a  robust  preprocessing  pipeline  for  fMRI 
data [116]. Preprocessing includes brain extraction, spa-
tial normalization, and alignment to the T1 reference. In 
addition,  spatial  smoothing  will  be  performed.  Preproc-
essed  data  will  be  corrected  for  physiological  noise  and 
motion. A combination of seed-based and network-based 
approaches will be used to analyze the corrected resting-
state  data  and  assess  group  differences  (MBI + CAU  vs. 
CAU-only) in functional connectivity.

Diffusion weighted data will be preprocessed and ana-
lyzed  using  dedicated  neuroimaging  software  packages 
(e.g.  FMRIB  Software  Library  (FSL);  https:// fsl. fmrib. ox. 
ac. uk/ fsl/,  MRTRIX;  https:// www. mrtrix. org).  Data  will 
be  denoised,  corrected  for  Eddy  currents  and  B1  field 
inhomogeneities.  Estimated  response  functions  will  be 
used  for  tractography.  Individual  tractograms  will  be 
used  to  reconstruct  structural  connectomes,  which  will 
be analyzed using graph theoretical analysis.

fMRI  task  data  (SRET)  will  be  analyzed  using  neuro-
imaging software packages, including FSL and Statistical 
Parametric Mapping (SPM; https:// www. fil. ion. ucl. ac. uk/ 
spm/), as well as custom analysis scripts. Data will be pre-
processed using fMRIPrep. At first level, a General Linear 
Model (GLM) will be applied with regressors represent-
ing task activity. An additional set of regressors, including 
motion  regressors  and  physiological  noise  components 
will be added as nuisance parameters to remove artifacts. 
Parameter  estimates  will  then  be  entered  into  second 
level and group-level (MBI + CAU vs. CAU-only) models. 
Main  contrasts  of  interest  include  self-reference > other-
reference and/or self-reference > semantic processing. Both 
whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses will be 
performed,  focusing  mainly  on  DMN/cortical  midline 
activation (https:// aspre dicted. org/ v4qt2. pdf ).

Associations with clinical outcomes measures and diagnostic 
syndromes

Behavioral  outcomes  on  cognitive  tasks  and  (f)MRI 
findings  will  be  tested  for  associations  with  levels  of 

Furthermore, exploratory analyses will be performed to 
assess whether the presence of diagnostic syndromes, as 
identified through DSM-oriented scales on the ASR and/
or MINI-S-DSM-5 classifications, is associated with dif-
ferences in clinical, cognitive behavioral and neural out-
comes.  Comparisons  will  be  made  between  participants 
with  diagnosed  syndromes  (e.g.,  depression)  and  those 
without,  to  explore  potential  variations  in  intervention 
effects across these subgroups.

Data management and monitoring

Data  is  collected  at  the  Radboud  university  medical 
center  (Radboudumc,  Nijmegen,  the  Netherlands)  and 
DCCN  (Radboud  University,  Nijmegen,  the  Nether-
lands). Collaboration between these institutes is based on 
legal  agreements  and  a  Clinical  Trial  Agreement  (CTA) 
and  Joint  Controller  Data  Exchange  Agreement  are  in 
place  between  the  two  entities.  Handling  of  personal 
data  is  in  compliance  with  the  European  General  Data 
Protection  Regulation  (GDPR).  In  all  study  documents, 
participants  are  identified  by  an  identification  code 
(pseudonym)  only.  Access  to  personal  data  is  granted 
only  to  core  members  of  the  research  team  and  to  the 
study monitor if requested. Data is preserved for at least 
15 years, according to Netherlands Federation of Univer-
sity Medical Centres (NFU) data preservation norms for 
clinical studies. In correspondence with NFU guidelines, 
the  study  will  be  monitored  by  an  independent,  certi-
fied  monitor  who  will  evaluate  (1)  the  protection  of  the 
rights and well-being of the participants, (2) whether the 
reported  research  data  is  accurate  and  completely  veri-
fiable  in  source  documents,  and  (3)  whether  the  imple-
mentation of the research is consistent with the approved 
protocol/amendment(s)  at  that  time,  with  GCP  and  the 
applicable legal requirements. The frequency and extent 
of study monitoring is defined in a monitor plan, which 
has been approved by the Radboudumc Board of Direc-
tors as part of the local feasibility application.

Risks and discomforts associated with participation in 
this  study  are  low/negligible.  A  detailed  data  manage-
ment plan (DMP) has been set up for the current trial and 
has been approved by data stewards at the Radboudumc 
and DCCN as part of the local feasibility application pro-
cess. Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any undesirable 
experience  occurring  to  a  participant  during  the  study 
including  deterioration  in  mental  health  (as  reported 
by participants) and development of, or increase in, sui-
cidal ideation (actively screened for using ASR items on 
suicidality),  whether  or  not  related  to  the  mindfulness 
intervention.  All  AEs  reported  spontaneously  by  the

subject or observed by the investigators during lab visits 
will  be  recorded  in  CastorEDC.  Serious  adverse  events 
(SAEs),  resulting  in  death  (e.g.,  suicide),  life  threaten-
ing  conditions  (e.g.,  attempted  suicide),  or  hospitaliza-
tion (e.g., admission to a psychiatric hospital), persistent 
or significant disability or incapacity or other important 
medical  events  will  be  recorded  in  CastorEDC,  and  will 
be reported to the medical research ethics committee fol-
lowing national regulations. SAEs will be reported within 
15 days after first knowledge of the SAE or within 7 days 
if they result in death or are life threatening.

Discussion
Summary

Internalizing problems such as worrying, anxiety, stress. 
and  low  mood  are  increasingly  common  in  youth  and 
may  constitute  an  early  clinical  stage  of  mental  illness 
development  [117–119].  Current  care  for  youth  with 
these  types  of  problems  lacks  preventive  measures  and 
thus tends to focus on supportive counselling and watch-
ful  waiting,  while  taking  advantage  of  the  opportunity 
for  early  intervention  may  prevent  progression  to  more 
serious  mental  illness.  The  current  study  aims  to  inves-
tigate  the  effect  of  an  early-stage  MBI  on  internalizing 
problems  and  their  longitudinal  development  in  help-
seeking youth. A broad range of measures is obtained; in 
addition to careful clinical evaluation, cognitive tasks and 
(f )MRI  scans  are  collected,  to  elucidate  putative  under-
lying  cognitive  processes  and  neural  substrates  of  early 
mental  illness  development  and  whether,  and  if  so  how, 
these  are  modulated  through  mindfulness-based  early 
intervention.

Strengths

implemented 

The  mindfulness  training  program 
in 
this  RCT  is  a  tailored  program  developed  specifically 
for  youth,  but  grounded  in  the  exhaustively  researched 
MBSR  and  MBCT  programs.  Each  training  group  is 
guided by two certified mindfulness trainers, including a 
licensed clinician, who receive supervision from an expe-
rienced  mindfulness  and  meditation  teacher  (AC)  and 
are evaluated for competence based on video recordings 
assessed using the MBI-TAC. Trainings are administered 
at the Radboudumc Expertise Center for Mindfulness. A 
heterogeneous  population  of  youth  experiencing  inter-
nalizing problems is targeted by applying a limited set of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, making the study results 
generalizable  to  clinical  practice.  CAU  received  prior  to 
and  during  study  participation  are  carefully  registered 
in  both  groups  to  detect  potential  differences  in  CAU 
in  the  CAU-only  group  compared  to  the  MBI + CAU 
group,  as  the  mindfulness  intervention  may  influence 
the  need  for  other  treatment  modalities  or  referrals. 

Clinician-researchers  conducting  the  structured  diag-
nostic interview at 6-month follow-up are blind to group 
allocation  to  prevent  bias  in  clinical  assessments.  In 
addition  to  self-report  instruments,  this  study  deploys 
a variety of techniques to acquire more objectively valid 
data such as a structured diagnostic interview, cognitive 
behavioral tasks and (f )MRI scanning, whereby creating a 
rich, extensively phenotyped clinical dataset. Neural sub-
strates  and  cognitive  processes  will  be  assessed  through 
neuroimaging and cognitive behavioral tasks to elucidate 
underlying factors involved in the potential development 
of mental illness and how they are modulated by mindful-
ness-based  intervention.  Lastly,  implementing  follow-up 
assessments at 2 months and 6 months after completion 
of treatment will give insight in the retainment of possi-
ble effects of the MBI after training completion and will 
allow us to gauge the impact of an (early-stage) MBI on 
subsequent trajectories of mental illness development.

Limitations

Previous  research  has  shown  an  overrepresentation  of 
highly-educated  and  female  participants  in  mindful-
ness  trials  [120].  This  imbalance  is  anticipated  in  the 
current  study  as  well.  Efforts  are  made  to  include  men 
and  lower-educated  participants,  by  involving  mental 
health  care  providers  in  areas  of  lower  socioeconomic 
status  and  by  explicitly  encouraging  providers  to  refer 
male  participants.  Another  limitation  of  the  current 
study  is  the  relatively  short  follow-up  period  relative  to 
the  typical  timeline  from  early-stage  symptoms  to  overt 
mental  illness.  Intervention  effects  on  broad  outcome 
measures, such as mental disorders according to DSM-5 
criteria as assessed in the structured diagnostic interview, 
would  likely  be  more  informative  with  a  longer  follow-
up  period,  but  it  was  considered  unfeasible  and  unethi-
cal  to  withhold  the  mindfulness  intervention  from  the 
CAU-only group for longer than the current study dura-
tion (approximately 9 months in total). Lastly, neural and 
cognitive  assessments  are  only  collected  pre-  and  post-
intervention, and not at 2- and 6-months follow-up due 
to  practical  and  financial  constraints.  Therefore,  longer 
lasting effects of the mindfulness intervention on neural 
and cognitive processes cannot be assessed.

Trial status
The  study  protocol  described  here  has  the  following 
version  numbers:  Algemeen  Beoordelings-en  Registra-
tieformulier  number  NL82568.091.22,  and  Commissie 
Mensgebonden  Onderzoek  Oost-Nederland  number 
CMO2022-16024,  version  5.0  (February  12,  2024).  The 
first  participant  for  this  study  was  included  on  July  7th, 
2023.  As  of  November  29th  2024,  87  participants  have 
been  included.  Of  these,  33  participants  have  finished 

Schepers et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2025) 25:126

all  study  procedures.  Post-intervention  measures  for 
the  required  sample  size  are  expected  to  be  completed 
by  early  2026.  Thus  far,  recruitment  is  on  schedule  and 
sample size estimation is expected to be conservative as 
drop-out rates to date remain well below the anticipated 
20%.

Conclusion
This  protocol  describes  a  methodologically  robust,  two-
armed,  randomized  controlled,  single-blinded  study 
design assessing effects of a group-MBI on clinical, cog-
nitive  and  neural  measures  acquired  in  a  heterogeneous 
population of help-seeking youth. The study incorporates 
a comprehensive range of measurements, including self-
report  questionnaires,  structured  diagnostic  interviews, 
cognitive  tasks,  and  (f )MRI  assessments  at  different 
timepoints.  Given  a  paucity  of  research  into  the  effects 
of MBIs in this population, this clinical trial is expected 
to  advance  the  field  of  early  intervention  in  mental  ill-
ness and may contribute to the implementation of MBIs 
in clinical settings for help-seeking youth at a stage when 
intervention  is  potentially  more  beneficial,  less  burden-
some,  and  more  cost-efficient  than  treatments  required 
when more serious psychiatric disorders have developed. 
In addition, the study can contribute to increased under-
standing  of  cognitive  and  neural  processes  underlying 
mental  illness  development  and  effects  of  mindfulness-
based early intervention on these processes.
