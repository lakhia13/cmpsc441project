Psychedelic compounds have been utilized by humans for centuries for medicinal,
religious, and tribal purposes. Clinical trial data starting from the early 2000s and
continuing today indicates that psychedelics are a clinically efﬁcacious treatment
for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, all clinical trials
examining these substances have excluded any individual with a past or current
history of seizures, leaving a large cohort of epilepsy and non-epilepsy chronic
seizure disorder patients without anywhere to turn for psychedelic-assisted
therapy. These exclusions were made despite any signiﬁcant evidence that
clinically supervised psychedelic use causes or exacerbates seizures in this
population. To date, no clinical
trial or preclinical seizure model has
demonstrated that psychedelics induce seizures. This review highlights several
individuals experiencing seizures or seizure remission following
cases of
psychedelic use, with the overall trend being that psychedelics are safe for use
in a controlled, supervised clinical setting. We also suggest future research
directions for this ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) has emerged as a clinically efﬁcacious treatment for an
array of psychiatric disorders including treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (Carhart-Harris
et al., 2016a; Stroud et al., 2018; Palhano-Fontes et al., 2019; Goodwin et al., 2022), major
depressive disorder (MDD) (Davis et al., 2021; Sloshower et al., 2023), end-of-life psychiatric
distress (Bossis et al., 2016; Agin-Liebes et al., 2020; Rosa et al., 2022), anxiety (Davis et al., 2019),
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Mithoefer et al., 2018; Mithoefer et al., 2019) and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Rodriguez et al., 2013; Kelmendi et al., 2022). PAT has
also effectively treated tobacco addiction and alcohol dependence (Krebs and Johansen, 2012;
Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2017; Sessa et al., 2019). In these clinical trials, both
classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and atypical
psychedelics, such as ketamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) were
integrated into therapy sessions. These forms of PAT are well-tolerated by patients in clinical
settings. Recently, psychedelic treatment has been used to treat functional neurological disorder
(FND), an umbrella of neurological symptoms including functional movement disorders

(FMDs), functional sensory disorders (FSDs), and functional seizures
(Butler et al., 2020; Stewart et al., 2020; Argento et al., 2023).

Although psychedelics have shown strong efﬁcacy in treating a
diverse array of symptoms, one speciﬁc cohort of patients has been
excluded from all PAT clinical trials: individuals with a past or
current history of seizures.

Individuals with chronic seizure disorders, such as epilepsy and
some mitochondrial encephalopathies, have a reduced quality of life
and experience disproportionate rates of anxiety and depression
compared to the general population (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017;
López-Giménez and González-Maeso, 2018). Additionally, ~10% of
individuals with epilepsy experience functional seizures (also
referred to as psychogenic, non-epileptic seizures [PNES]), which
are not treatable with traditional anti-epileptic pharmacological
therapies or surgical
interventions due to their psychological
underpinnings. These patients require novel, alternative therapies,
with conjunctive psychological treatment, such as in PAT.

There is sparse and conﬂicting published data regarding the safety of
psychedelics in the context of chronic and acute seizures. We will
demonstrate that most reports are case studies of individuals taking
psychedelics recreationally in unsupervised non-clinical settings. The few
controlled studies support classical psychedelics as safe and tolerable
under clinical supervision, even in patients with a history of epilepsy who
currently experience spontaneous, recurrent seizures (SRS).

screen and were included in the analysis (Figure 1).

3.2 Overview of psychedelic actions and
mechanisms

3.2.1 Classical psychedelics

The classical psychedelics psilocybin, LSD, and mescaline are
agonists of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A and 2C receptors
(López-Giménez and González-Maeso, 2018). The neural circuitry
effects of LSD and psilocybin include changes in resting-state
functional connectivity (RSFC) between and within distinct brain
regions. Most notably, these compounds increase inter-network
RSFC, between the default mode network (DMN), executive
network (EN), and salience network (SN)
structures, while
decreasing intra-network RSFC within each set of structures
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). The
precise neurobiological underpinnings of these functional network
changes are still not completely understood.

3.2.2 MDMA

MDMA is an atypical psychedelic, referred to as an empathogen
and entactogen (National Academies of Sciences et al., 2022).

We identiﬁed 10 case reports from 1992 to 2023 in which patients
experienced seizures after ingesting a classical or atypical psychedelic
substance. Reports in each subsection are ordered by date (oldest to
newest). One additional paper, which was not a case report
(Serafetinides, 1965) is also described, though this paper is an open-
label trial of LSD in individuals with epilepsy who undergo neurosurgery.

3.3.1 Reports involving MDMA

Hall et al.

(1996) reported a 26-year-old paraplegic male
experiencing generalized seizures following the ingestion of an
ecstasy (MDMA) tablet (of unknown dosage) alongside concurrent

alcohol consumption (Hall et al., 1996). He was treated with 50 mg of
intravenous diazepam, dantrolene and anaesthesia (thiopentone,
alfentanil and suxamethonium), successfully halting the generalized
tonic-clonic seizure. Subsequently, the patient developed hypotension,

disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure, gross
rhabdomyolysis, adult respiratory distress syndrome and hepatic failure.
Despite the severity of his condition, he was discharged 17 days later
and achieved a complete recovery.

Cooper et al. (1997) reported an accidental ingestion of MDMA (of
unknown dosage) resulting in febrile convulsion in a 2-year-old female
with a history of speech delay (Cooper and Egleston, 1997). At the time,
the patient was undergoing treatment with amoxicillin for an upper
respiratory tract infection, but the duration of treatment was not
speciﬁed. The patient displayed agitation, high fever, rapid heart rate
and dilated pupils. She was treated with oxygen, rectal paracetamol, and
intravenous diazepam resulting

complications. Initially, the mother did not indicate that the patient
ingested any substance, until she was questioned about the patient’s
abnormal teeth grinding and oculogyric crisis. Following this, the
patient’s urine was analyzed, and the ﬁndings showed MDMA and
MDA (the metabolite of MDMA) presence. The mother then admitted
that the patient had accidently ingested MDMA, which delayed the
delivery of treatment. The exact timecourse of the urine analysis and
treatment was not described, but it was noted that the patient was
admitted to the hospital and underwent the aforementioned treatments
prior to the parent’s admission (Cooper and Egleston, 1997).

Patient 2 was a 20-month-old female with a history of convulsions
after a fall on the head. She was taken to the hospital presenting with
hyperthermia, tachycardia, and rigidity. Urine analysis revealed a
6 mg/L MDA and 119 mg/L MDMA concentration, along with trace
amounts of cocaine (Pauwels et al., 2013). It should be noted, however,
that although this report explicitly described trace amounts of cocaine
being present in the main text, the table displaying the toxicology
results showed a negative result in the cocaine assay, without any urine
concentration listed.

3.3.2 Reports involving LSD

Several case studies describe adults experiencing seizures
following the recreational use of psychedelics without clinical
supervision.

Picker et al. (1992) reported a potential interaction between LSD
and ﬂuoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) after a
16-year-old male undergoing 20 mg/day of ﬂuoxetine treatment for
approximately 1 year experienced a focal seizure that progressed to a
generalized tonic-clonic seizure after ingesting two “blotters”
containing LSD at an unknown dosage (Picker et al., 1992).
Interestingly, this may have been a case of serotonin syndrome,
which is an acute constellation of symptoms caused by excessive
serotonin levels. Serotonin syndrome is often reported when
different serotonergic drugs are taken concomitantly, such as an
SSRI with a large dose of LSD (Boyer and Shannon, 2005; Foong
et al., 2018; Francescangeli et al., 2019).

Legriel et al. (2008) reported the case of a 39-year-old male
with a history of depression and chronic alcohol abuse (Legriel
et al., 2008). The medication history included 75 mg/kg of
clomipramine daily to control depression symptoms, which was
discontinued after 6 months. The patient reported experiencing a
generalized tonic-clonic seizure 3 years prior following ingestion
of lysergic acid amine (LSA), which is structurally similar to LSD.
The patient was taken to a hospital and experienced mental
confusion and mydriasis. Vital signs included a 120 beats/min
heart rate, and 185/130 mmHg blood pressure. At the hospital, the
patient experienced another seizure that lasted over 10 min, which
did cease following intravenous clonazepam administration. The
patient was subsequently intubated and mechanically ventilated
and was successfully extubated 3 days after admission. The dose of
LSA taken was unknown, and the purity was not determined
(Legriel et al., 2008).

Aakeroy et al. (2021), reported a male in his late teens with an
unremarkable medical history who arrived at the hospital following
ingestion of a “blotter” containing LSD and small amounts of N,N-
dimethyl tryptamine (DMT), methamphetamine, amphetamine, and
MDMA that resulted in the patient experiencing a tonic seizure and
other adverse events including vomiting and cyanosis (Aakerøy et al.,
2021). Emergency personnel arrived 25 min after the initial onset of
symptoms and found the patient in cardiorespiratory arrest. The patient
was intubated and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
therapy. A comprehensive drug analysis was conducted on a blotter
sample identical to the one the patient ingested, which revealed a dosage
of 300 μg LSD. Serum and urine samples were collected 3 h after the
initial onset of symptoms and LSD was found to have a serum
concentration of 4 ng/mL (12.4 nmol/L) and 1.3 ng/mL (4.0 nmol/L)
urine concentration (Aakerøy et al., 2021). For comparison, clinical trial
LSD dosing is standardized at or around 75 µg, which induces
signiﬁcant mind-altering

electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings were taken during the LSD
administration to determine changes in brain waves and epileptic activity.
During the pre-operation recordings, 12 patients had no change in
epileptic activity, while 5 had a decrease and 1 had increased epileptic
EEG activity. During the post-operation recordings, 17 patients had no
change in epileptic activity, while 2 had decreased and 1 had increased
epileptic activity. Overall, this study indicates LSD may be safe for use in
individuals with epilepsy (Serafetinides, 1965).

3.3.3 Reports involving psilocybin (“magic
mushrooms”)

Lastly, a case study by Blond et al. (2023), reported a
signiﬁcant exacerbation in epileptic seizures
following the
ingestion of a large dose (3.6 g) of psychedelic mushrooms in
a 31-year-old male with a history of refractory frontal epilepsy
(Blond and Schindler, 2023). In order to treat the unilateral right
temporal epilepsy, the patient had been previously implanted
with a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS) that improved
morbidity although he continued to experience several focal
seizures without awareness per week. According to his RNS
data, ingestion of psilocybin at high doses (3.6 g) resulted in
32 long episodes (30 s of prolonged epileptiform activity) while
ingestion at low doses (1.5 g) did not change baseline seizure
frequency (Blond and Schindler, 2023).

3.3.4 Reports involving ketamine

Recently, Argento et al. (2023) reported the case of a 51-year-old
female with refractory functional seizures with a daily frequency
(Argento et al., 2023). The patient’s medical history included MDD
and PTSD. After years of failing behavioural and pharmacological
therapies, she enrolled in a ketamine-assisted therapy program. The
patient underwent 3 weeks of ketamine-assisted therapy followed by
20 weeks of intermittent therapy and ketamine sessions. During weeks
1, 3, and 4, the patient received 100, 150, and 200 mg of ketamine
sublingually, respectively, with an additional 35, 45, and 60 mg
intranasal dose, respectively. See Table 1 for the complete KAT
treatment regimen. The type of therapy used was psychotherapy by
a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and somatization
disorders. Following the treatment, the patient went into remission
for the functional seizures, depressive symptoms, and functional
movement symptoms (Argento et al., 2023).

4 Discussion

4.1 Conclusion

In conclusion, there is a deﬁcit of published data on preclinical
and clinical uses of psychedelics in the context of epilepsy and non-
epilepsy seizure disorders. Most data are case reports of individuals
taking unspeciﬁed amounts of untested psychedelic drugs in an
uncontrolled recreational setting (see Figure 2). Although adverse
events were reported, including convulsive seizures, it is unclear
whether these events resulted from the psychedelic use, or whether
other confounding factors played a role, such as simultaneous
alcohol or other drug consumption and concomitant medication,
all of which were reported in several cases (see Table 2). Several
reports described both accidental and intentional ingestion of other

substances, such as cocaine and non-MDMA amphetamines
concomitantly with the psychedelic substance (Cooper and
Egleston, 1997; Boyer and Shannon, 2005; Huntjens et al., 2022).
Additionally, the case reports involving young children ingesting
MDMA, though concerning, do not indicate that MDMA induces
seizures in individuals with chronic seizure conditions when taken
in a controlled clinical setting with appropriate dosing.

It should be noted, however, that in all reports of psychedelic use
while under clinical supervision, such as Argento et al. (2023) and
Serafetinides (1965), no signiﬁcant serious adverse events were
reported in the individuals who have epilepsy. Although further
research is needed, the data we describe in this review indicate that
psychedelics may be safe for use in the epilepsy population when
taken under clinical supervision in a clinical setting, such as with
psychedelic-assisted therapy.

classical psychedelics do not exacerbate seizures in animals, then
randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials should be
completed to determine if there is any therapeutic beneﬁt of
psychedelics in patients with epilepsy or other chronic seizure
disorders to treat their seizures, both epileptic and functional. The
