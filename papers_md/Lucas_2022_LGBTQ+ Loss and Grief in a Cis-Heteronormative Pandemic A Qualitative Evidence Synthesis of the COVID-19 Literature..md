Abstract
LGBTQ+ people are no stranger to loss and grief, particularly during times of pandemic such as the 1980s–90s HIV/AIDS
pandemic and now, the COVID-19 pandemic. Current COVID-19 loss and grief research remains relatively silent on
LGBTQ+ peoples’ loss and grief experiences. The aim of this research was to conduct a qualitative evidence synthesis of
LGBTQ+ people’s COVID-19 loss and grief experiences reported in the literature. A systematic search and inclusion
strategy identiﬁed 22 relevant articles for review. Inductive thematic synthesis resulted in ﬁve loss-focused themes across
the articles: (1) loss of work and livelihood, (2) loss of social and kinship connection, (3) loss of LGBTQ+ community
connection, (4) loss of physical and mental health supports and (5) loss of LGBTQ+ identity authenticity, afﬁrmation and
visibility. Discussion of these themes highlights the many layered and often disenfranchised nature of LGBTQ+ people’s
loss during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created signiﬁcant up-
heaval, with nearly 6 million reported deaths and over 400
million cases recorded to date (February 2022) on the
John Hopkins COVID-19 Global Dashboard (Dong et al.,
2020). The impacts of the pandemic on people’s lives are
not homogenous and in cis-heteronormative societies, a
disproportional impact is felt within marginalised com-
munities such as women (UN Women, 2021) and the
world’s LGBTQ+ peoples – lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, queer or any other minority sexuality or
gender identity (e.g., two-spirit or third gender) (Bishop,
2020). The COVID-19 pandemic for LGBTQ+ people has
either brought new challenges or has ampliﬁed pre-
COVID marginalisation which has negatively affected
their sense of belonging, social connectedness and
identity afﬁrmation (Bishop, 2020). Associated with such
COVID-19-related challenges are experiences of loss and
grief.

Loss and grief are as ubiquitous with life as they are
with death, involving changes in concrete and more ab-
stract parts of people’s lives, selves and identities

(Weenolsen, 1988, 1991; Wheat & Thacker, 2019).
Weenolsen (1988) deﬁned loss as ‘anything that destroys
some aspect … of life and self. Loss is not change, but
change incorporates both loss and its overcoming’. (p.
19). This overcoming, or response to loss, is often viewed
lives’
as grief
(Goldsworthy, 2005, p. 167). Most of what we understand
about loss is based on death losses (e.g., bereavement)
rather than non-death losses (e.g., loss of employment)

(Fernandez et al., 2014; Goldsworthy, 2005; Harris,
2019). Dominant approaches to understanding people’s
loss and grief tend towards more individualistic, psy-
chological and clinical/medical
lenses (Goldsworthy,
2005). As such, loss and grief are considered internal,
largely private, individual reactions relating to signiﬁcant
changes in people’s environment requiring equally indi-
vidualistic therapeutic pathways, such as counselling or
psychotherapy. These dominant therapeutic approaches
include psychodynamic theory (Freud, 1917; Lindemann,
1944), attachment theory (Bowlby, 1980), phase/stage/
task models (Kessler & Kubler-Ross, 2005; Parkes, 1987;
Raphael, 1984; Worden, 2018) and cognitive-behavioural
models (Malkinson, 2001; Stroebe & Schut, 2010). While
contributing to greater understanding of loss and grief,
these approaches do not always consider the impact of
imposed cis-heteronormativity within the context of in-
tersecting social identities (e.g., age, sexuality and gender
identity, religion, class, culture) in shaping LGBTQ+
people’s experiences (Schwartzberg, 1992; Wheat &
Thacker, 2019).

Wheat and Thacker (2019) argued that LGBTQ+
people often experience loss and grief that have common
features to that of their cis-heterosexual counterparts, as
well as experiences uniquely related to socially imposed
cis-heteronormativity that marginalises LGBTQ+ identi-
ties. For example, common losses, according to Wheat
and Thacker, include death of a relative from an LGBTQ+
person’s Family of Origin such as their parent, partner/
spouse, sibling, or child or the death of LGBTQ+ com-
munity members.
In such death-related losses, an
LGBTQ+ person can face unique experiences such as
the deceased’s and/or a surviving partner’s
whether
sexuality and/or gender identities are afﬁrmed by family
and friends (McNutt & Yakushko, 2013). They can also
uniquely face challenges surrounding legal recognition of
spousal relationships, parental status and child custody
arrangements (Chauveron et al., 2017). A loss related to
an LGBTQ+ person’s Family of Choice, that is, their
LGBTQ+ kinship networks (Prasad, 2020), may be
deeply grieved. This is due to the strong sense of solidarity
and safety often found within the Family of Choice
compared with the Family of Origin who might be hostile
towards anyone who is not cis-heterosexual (Wheat &
Thacker, 2019).

Loss and grief experiences unique to LGBTQ+ people
include loss of visibility, afﬁrmation and authentic self-
expression of their sexuality and gender identities. For
example, LGBTQ+ elders may experience and subse-
quently grieve the loss of visibility and authentic self-
expression from having to move into residential aged care
facilities run under the auspices of religious organisations
that are not afﬁrming of LGBTQ+ peoples (Arthur, 2015).
In the case of LGBTQ+ experiences of reproductive loss,

and

heteronormative cultures can strip LGBTQ+ parents of
their parental status. Likewise, the process of ‘coming out’
to others as LGBTQ+ can involve loss of belonging and
social connectedness particularly when coming out within
religious or spiritual communities and/or within particular
non-LGBTQ+-afﬁrming racial, ethnic or cultural com-
munities (Wheat & Thacker, 2019; Wood & Conley,
2014). As such, loss and grief related to visibility, afﬁr-
mation and authentic self-expression as LGBTQ+ can
become disenfranchised (Doka, 2008; Thompson &
Doka, 2017).

and

non-death

death-related

A key thread across many LGBTQ+ peoples’ expe-
riences of loss and grief prior to the COVID-19 pandemic
is the degree to which their experiences are disen-
franchised, or conversely enfranchised, within cis-
heteronormative cultures. Disenfranchised grief is ‘grief
that persons experience when they incur a loss that is not
or cannot be openly acknowledged, socially sanctioned or
publicly mourned’ (Doka, 1989, p. 4). The nature of
disenfranchised grief is that of a social phenomenon
losses
encompassing
(Thompson & Doka, 2017) which arises from cultural
norms surrounding who ‘has a right to grieve or a claim
for social sympathy or support’ (Doka, 2008, p. 224). Cis-
heteronormative cultural norms largely dictate whether
such grieving rights are extended to LGBTQ+ peoples.
This includes if LGBTQ+ people are afforded the right to
publicly mourn deaths in their family of choice and
broader kinship networks, as highlighted by Schwartzberg
(1992) during the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and
90s. Further examples include if an LGBTQ+ parent is
permitted to be present when news of their child’s death is
announced in the hospital (Craven & Peel, 2017), or
whether the LGBTQ+ elder is permitted the safe space to
express their lost sense of visibility in a religiously aus-
piced residential aged care facility (Arthur, 2015). In such
examples, cis-heteronormative cultural norms gate-keep
the right to grieving these losses.

How cis-heteronormative cultural norms during the
COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on LGBTQ+
people’s lives are still evolving; although grey literature
points to an ampliﬁcation of pre-COVID-19 experiences
(Bishop, 2020). The general loss and grief literature (e.g.,
Bertuccio & Runion, 2020; Kumar, 2021; Reneau &
Eanes, 2020; Walsh, 2020; Zhai & Du, 2020) is not
clear on LGBTQ+ people’s experiences. Therefore, a
useful starting point in understanding the COVID-19-
related loss and grief experiences from the perspective
of LGBTQ+ people themselves,
is in reviewing and
synthesising the published qualitative research in the area;
and as such this is the aim of the review reported in this
article. An additional aim is to bring to the fore the rich
and subjective experiences of LGBTQ+ people. This

article is the ﬁrst, to the knowledge of the author group,
that focuses on the review and synthesis of the qualitative
to make visible and afﬁrm
research as an attempt
LGBTQ+ people’s COVID-19-related loss and grief ex-
periences to inform health practice and policy.

Aim and Review Question

The aim of this research was to conduct a qualitative
evidence synthesis of LGBTQ+ people’s COVID-19-
related loss and grief experiences reported in the litera-
ture. The review question posed was, ‘What are LGBTQ+
people’s COVID-19 loss and grief experiences?’

Author Group Positioning

The author group consists of a cross-disciplinary team
therapy and disability and
(social work, occupational
social inclusion) of LGBTQ+ identifying people and their
genuine allies; all of whom are committed to promoting
the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people and chal-
lenging oppressive cis-heteronormative cultural norms.
The author group worked reﬂexively together in re-
viewing and synthesising the qualitative research to re-
duce unconsciously imposing our personal beliefs and
assumptions; and to hold each member of the author group
accountable in ‘doing justice’ to the LGBTQ+ voices in
the qualitative research. In this way, the author group was
committed in remaining mindful of the beneﬁts and
challenges of conducting research from an LGBTQ+/ally
insider–outsider perspective (Nelson, 2020).

Methods

The synthesis included four steps as follows: (1) sys-
(2)
tematic search and sampling of

the literature,

methodological quality and risk of bias assessment, (3)
data extraction and (4) data synthesis (Zimmer, 2006).
This review did not require formal ethical review from the
Human Research Ethics Committee.

Search and Inclusion Strategy

Two authors (JJL, SLB-O) developed the search and
inclusion strategy which was reviewed by a University
Librarian not otherwise involved in the review. Speciﬁc
keywords (along with their synonyms, combinations,
Boolean operates and relevant MeSH/Subject terms) were
applied based upon the inclusion and exclusion criteria
(Table 1). The electronic search strategy was applied to the
following databases via EBSCOHost: MEDLINE, CI-
NAHL, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, LGBTQ+ Source and
Academic Search Complete; as well as to EMBASE via
embase.com. Translation of the key search terms and
combinations were made to suit each speciﬁc database.
An initial search was conducted in August–September
2021, which did not yield any relevant results at the title
and abstract level. The search strategy was then reﬁned
and repeated in January–February 2022 using only the key
terms ‘LGBTQ+’ and ‘COVID-19’, to ensure all relevant
articles are captured (Supplementary File 1).

Speciﬁc inclusion and exclusion criteria, using the
SPIDER tool (Cooke et al., 2012), are outlined in Table 1.
The SPIDER tool is speciﬁcally utilised for qualitative
research questions. Given the identiﬁed issues with how
qualitative studies are indexed in electronic databases
(Cooke et al., 2012), the ‘D’ component of the SPIDER
tool was not included until the full-text review stage. The
‘loss and grief experiences’ component of the ‘PI’ was
also not applied until the full-text review stage as pre-
liminary searches did not yield any relevant results
(Table 1)

Two authors (JJL, SLB) independently screened the
titles and abstracts of all records from the initial search
yield against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text
articles were then retrieved for all relevant records and
further reviewed for their relevance. The same two authors
then cross-checked all included full-text articles and all
excluded full-text articles. Any disagreements amongst
the authors were discussed and resolved through con-
sensus. If consensus was not reached, a third author (SLB-
O) independently assessed the article and made the ﬁnal
decision. The online systematic review platform, Covi-
dence, was utilised to facilitate the article selection and
inclusion process. The results of this process are reported
according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement
(Page et al., 2021).

Methodological Quality and Risk of
Bias Assessment

The methodological quality of the included articles was
assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme’s
(2018) Qualitative Checklist (CASP-Q). For each of the
ten CASP-Q appraisal questions, a score of 1 (Yes), 0.5
(Unsure), or 0 (No) was selected. All articles were then
provided an overall quality rating as per Butler et al.’s
(2016) recommendations: ‘high-quality’ (score: 9–10),
‘moderate-quality’
(score: 7.5–8.5) and ‘low-quality’
(score: <7.5). Two authors (RA, KR) independently
completed the CASP checklist for each included article.
Any disagreements amongst the authors were discussed
and resolved through consensus. If consensus was not
reached, a third author (JJL) independently assessed the
article and made the ﬁnal decision. No article was ex-
cluded based on their overall quality rating, but rather
informed the author group of the methodological strengths
and limitations of the included article pool (Dixon-Woods
et al., 2006). Sensitivity analysis (i.e., assessment of
whether exclusion of inadequately reported/low meth-
odological quality studies affected the synthesis ﬁndings)
was then conducted to assess for risk of bias attributed to
methodological quality (Carroll et al., 2012).

Data Extraction

Summary data from each article were initially extracted:
authorship, publication year, study country, sample,
phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation and research
type (i.e., ‘SPIDER’). Key ﬁndings,
including direct
participant quotes, were also extracted from the articles.
Data extraction was undertaken predominantly by one
author (JJL) and checked for accuracy and completeness
by a second author (SLB) using the qualitative data

analysis tool, NVivo (Version 20). Any conﬂicts between
authors not resolved through consensus were done so with
the support of a third author (SLB-O).

Data Synthesis

The extracted data were then submitted to inductive
thematic synthesis (Thomas & Harden, 2008; Zimmer,
2006). The ﬁrst author initiated the coding by identifying
phrases when reading line by line ﬁrst-ordered data (direct
participants quotes)- and second-order data (papers’ data
analysis) from each article. Next, identiﬁed phrases were
grouped into smaller meaning units that described
LGBTQ+ people’s loss and grief experiences related to
the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar meaning units were
then grouped into larger analytical
themes. Larger,
overarching themes were then discussed by the research
team and formed the basis of the results and the discussion
in the synthesis.

Quantity, Characteristics and Quality of
Included Articles

Results of Screening and Selection Process. There were 1327
records retrieved using the search and inclusion strategy.
An additional four records were retrieved through refer-
ence chaining. After duplicates were removed (n = 435),
title and abstract screening commenced and resulted in a
further 621 records being excluded. At
this stage of
screening, there was an 85% agreement rate between the
two authors when independently reviewing the titles and
abstract. All disagreements were resolved through con-
sensus discussions, with no instances requiring a third
author to make a ﬁnal determination. In reviewing the full-
text of the remaining records,
there were 22 articles
deemed eligible for inclusion in the synthesis (Figure 1;
Table 2). There was an 87% agreement rate between the
two authors when independently reviewing the full-text
articles. There were 14 articles (5%) that required a third
author to make a ﬁnal determination on inclusion. All
articles were published in 2020 or 2021. There were 17
(77%) qualitative articles, with the remaining ﬁve articles
(23%) reporting a mixed-methods design. None of the
included articles reported on LGBTQ+ people’s loss and
grief via their title or abstract; rather, such information was
found through the full-text review.

Countries. Ten articles (45.5%) reported studies under-
taken in the USA. The remaining articles reported studies
from India (22.7%; n = 5), UK (18.2%; n = 4), Canada
(4.5%; n = 1), Australia (4.5%; n = 1) and one article
(4.5%) reported a Portugal-Brazil cross-national study.

The included article pool is northern-hemisphere domi-
nant (91%; n = 20) and all include predominantly Western
European countries.

Participants’ Ages, Sexualities and Gender Identities. There
were approximately 2533 LGBTQ+ voices represented
across the included articles. Participants’ mean ages
ranged from 17.48 years to 66.4 years, with ages ranging
from 15 years to 94 years. Participants’ reported sexu-
alities and gender identities were diverse and not always
possible to disaggregate across articles due to varying
reporting methods of authors. Common sexualities and
gender identities across the articles were lesbian, gay,
bisexual, queer, pansexual, men who have sex with men,
asexual, questioning, two-spirit, demisexual, cisgender
trans-woman/trans-feminine,
woman, cisgender man,
trans-man/trans-masculine, non-binary, gender queer,
agender, third gender, (Badhai) Hijra, gender ﬂuid, gender
questioning, trans and gender nonconforming.

Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment. In using the CASP-Q
checklist, which contained 10 appraisal questions, the two
authors (Author Initials Here) assessed 220 criteria over
the 22 included articles and independently agreed on 152
items (69.1%). The majority of articles (n = 11; 50%) were
rated ‘high’ quality, with six articles (27%) of ‘moderate’
quality and ﬁve articles (23%) of ‘low’ quality. Of the low

quality papers, there were three that were rated of ‘very
low’ quality (CASP-Q score ≤4.5) with scores of 4.5
(Preeti & Kaur, 2020), 3 (Paceley et al., 2021) and 0.5
(Thankachan et al., 2020), respectively (Table 2). The
primary limitation across all articles, regardless of their
overall quality rating, was in their adequately addressing
the relationship between researcher/s and participants. For
those articles rated ‘moderate’ or below, limitations also
related to whether the analyses were of sufﬁcient rigour.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that the ﬁve articles rated
‘low’ or ‘very low’ quality did not provide unique con-
tribution to the synthesis ﬁndings. This result, taken to-
gether with the reliance on high and moderately quality
articles supported a lower risk of bias from methodo-
logical quality on the synthesis ﬁndings.

Inductive Thematic Synthesis
Through the process of inductive thematic synthesis, ﬁve
themes were developed as follows: (1) loss of work and
livelihood, (2) loss of social and kinship connection, (3)
loss of LGBTQ+ community connection, (4) loss of
physical and mental health supports and (5) loss of
LGBTQ+ identity authenticity, afﬁrmation and visibility.
It is important to note that while the original aim was to
review the loss and grief experiences, the literature no-
tably focused more explicitly on the losses experienced

(hence the focus on loss in this section). Not all themes
involved contribution from every article, but each article
contributed to at least one theme. It is important to note
that these themes are not considered mutually exclusive,
but rather interdependent – each having inﬂuence on the
other as outlined below.

Theme 1: Loss of Work and Livelihood. The loss of work or
livelihood was reported in eight articles (Bhalla &
Agarwal, 2021; Brownstone et al., 2021; Pandya &
Redcay, 2021; Pereira et al., 2021; Preeti & Kaur,
2020; Rhodes et al., 2020; Riggle et al., 2021;
Thankachan et al., 2020). Participants across these articles
described how they had lost their work and their sole
source of income, they also lost their livelihoods as a
result of governments’ public health lockdown measures
and physical distancing (also referred to as social dis-
tancing) requirements. At times, the threat of lost work
and livelihood and the anxiety around its implications for
participants’ future livelihood was felt just as keenly as if
it was occurring, as though in a form of preparation for the
possibility. Implications for livelihoods included having
no money to buy food and supplies, an inability to pay rent
and (if available) living off savings.

Compounding the loss of work and livelihood was for
those participants, now unable to afford living indepen-
dently, being forced to move back into the family home (to
avoid homelessness) where queerphobia was often
present. Access to social security beneﬁts was identiﬁed
by Pandya and Redcay (2021), as a barrier to mitigating
the effects of lost work and livelihoods owing to par-
ticipants’ (the Indian transgender Hijra community) in-
ability to access
identity
documents (e.g., birth certiﬁcate). Indeed, the challenges
arising from lost work and livelihood were experienced
most saliently by the participants who were predomi-
nantly from India, identiﬁed as a transgender woman or
Hijra, of working-class or living with HIV.

the required government

Theme 2: Loss of Social and Kinship Connection. The loss of
social and kinship connection was reported across eight
articles (Braksmajer & London, 2021; Gaspar et al., 2021;
O’Brien et al., 2021; Pereira et al., 2021; Philpot et al.,
2021; Quinn et al., 2021; Riggle et al., 2021; Westwood
et al., 2021). This type of loss largely related to losses in
the quality and quantity of friendships, LGBTQ+ people’s
Family of Choice, their Family of Origin and romantic or
sexual partners (Wheat & Thacker, 2019). Loss of these
forms of connection resulted in feelings of isolation and
reduced wellbeing (O’Brien et al., 2021) given their
central role in social support provision for LGBTQ+
people. For example, Philpot et al. (2021) reported how
Australian gay and bisexual men’s families of choice were
strongly missed during the pandemic as:

“they provided … supports typically believed to be entrenched in
families, such as love, safety, and comfort. [They] were now no
longer able to ﬁnd a sense of belonging [they] would usually
derive from this close personal community. (p. 6).

Pereira et al. (2021) also reported how lesbian, gay and
bisexual people in Portugal and Brazil felt vulnerable and
experienced low self-esteem when they were not able to
friendships during the pandemic and
maintain their
lockdown, owing to feelings of guilt as they thought they
were responsible for the lost connection. The loneliness
and social isolation that arose from lost social kinship
connections were so intense in some instances that suicide
was seen as the only way forward (O’Brien et al., 2021).
The close link between LGBTQ+ people’s loss of social
and kinship connections and, the negative impact on
mental health and wellbeing is well documented (Bishop,
2020).

In addition, the loss of social and kinship connections
experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic resonated
with the losses that LGBTQ+ people experienced during
the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 80s and 90s, particularly in
terms of the new threat and subsequent actuality of loss of
life from COVID-19 (Braksmajer & London, 2021; Quinn
et al., 2021). The participants in Braksmajer and London
(2021) and in Quinn et al.’s (2021) studies were also
acutely aware of the uncertain and adverse life-changing
nature of such global public health crises, but that having
lived through the HIV/AIDS epidemic provided LGBTQ+
people with a sense of resilience to face such uncertainty
and adversity that such crises bring (Quinn et al., 2021).

Theme 3: Loss of LGBTQ+ Community Connection. The loss
of LGBTQ+ community connection was reported across
three articles (Paceley et al., 2021; Philpot et al., 2021;
Riggle et al., 2021). This theme relates to the loss of a
sense of connection to the ‘LGBTQ+ community’ from
reduced ability to attend safe LGBTQ+-speciﬁc or
LGBTQ+-friendly spaces and leisure activity participa-
tion (Paceley et al., 2021; Philpot et al., 2021). In the
COVID-19 pandemic, many safe LGBTQ+ spaces were
closed, and associated leisure activities cancelled. The
sense of personal meaning and sense of belonging derived
from being immersed in these LGBTQ+ spaces and taking
part in the leisure activities was subsequently lost (Philpot
et al., 2021), resulting in a feeling of yearning or longing
for a return to normalcy (Riggle et al., 2021).

In addition, lost access to LGBTQ+ spaces were further
compounded from living with non-afﬁrming, often un-
supportive family in an effort to avoid homelessness
during lockdown periods (Paceley et al., 2021). In in-
stances where no loss of connection was experienced,
some LGBTQ+ people attributed this absence to their
privileged positioning as ‘largely white, middle-class

2112

men, who most likely had access to available resources to
remain ‘safe’ during COVID-19 restrictions’ (Philpot
et al., 2021, p. 6), thus shedding light on the inter-
sectionality between sexuality, gender identity, class and
culture in shaping LGBTQ+ community connection
during the pandemic. The worry over the threat of losing
such connection, nonetheless, was felt even in such
privilege.

Theme 4: Loss of Physical and Mental Health Supports. The
loss of physical and mental health supports was reported
across four articles (Fish et al., 2020; Hoyt et al., 2021;
Jones et al., 2021; Paceley et al., 2021). This theme
relates to the loss of formal supports normally accessed
in-person via school welfare services, medical clinics,
and mental health services. While some of the services
became accessible via telehealth arrangements,
this
online access was for some an additional barrier to
fostering positive health and wellbeing during the
COVID-19 pandemic as privacy at home was not
guaranteed. For example, in Fish et al.’s (2020) article,
LGBTQ+ youth in the USA described hesitancy in
utilising telehealth services out of fear that their un-
supportive parents would overhear their conversations
with the therapists.

For the LGBTQ+ young adults in Hoyt et al.’s (2021)
article, the loss of access to mental health services de-
livered via USA college-based programmes was exacer-
bated by, as one lesbian participant stated, having to ‘leave
all my support at school and come back to a homophobic
household where I have to remain in the closet’ (p. 6). As
such, there was a subsequent loss of connection with
‘supportive, afﬁrming, and trusted mentors and friends’
(Paceley et al., 2021, p. 10). In instances where access to
formal telehealth community support was possible in lieu
of in-person support, barriers to engagement included
‘timely referral to the services was low due to an over-
whelmed system’ (Jones et al., 2021, p. 9). For the young
trans and gender diverse people in Jones et al.’s (2021)
article, this barrier meant lost access to gender-afﬁrming
medical
(e.g., gender-
afﬁrmation hormone treatment and surgery). This loss
to lost access to non-medical gender-
was additional
afﬁrming interventions (e.g., haircuts) crucial for au-
thentic gender expression and maintaining overall mental
health and wellbeing.

services

Theme 5: Loss of LGBTQ+ Identity Authenticity, Afﬁrmation
and Visibility. The loss of LGBTQ+ identity authenticity,
afﬁrmation and visibility were reported across six articles
(Brownstone et al., 2021; Cerezo et al., 2021; Dunlop
et al., 2021; Jaspal, 2021; Jones et al., 2021; Sharma &
Subramanyam, 2020). This theme was perhaps the most
signiﬁcant in that it appeared that the culmination of the

losses in the other themes, created a sense of loss of
LGBTQ+ identity authenticity, afﬁrmation and visibility.
For example, participants who were forced to disconnect
from their LGBTQ+ family kinships (i.e., Theme 3) and
live in the family home with unsupportive, queerphobic
parents resulted the loss of identity authenticity from
having to conceal their LGBTQ+ selves from their loved
ones to remain safe (Brownstone et al., 2021; Jaspal,
2021; Sharma & Subramanyam, 2020). At times, living
in this way combined with living in a largely unaccepting
society felt like a suffocating cage, as one LGBTQ+ adult
in India expressed:

… spending time with family when you are not open, was
already like a cage, with family having lot of expectations
and along with societal pressures and humiliations. Closing
in (being conﬁned to) a non-accepting society and with high-
in-expectation family members is destroying my mental
health in COVID-19 times. I want to go away from this
Society and breathe in fresh air once again where I will not be
judged for how I was born. (Sharma & Subramanyam, 2020,
p. 13)

While physical freedom from a restrictive and non-
afﬁrming living situation forced an inauthentic existence
of hiding one’s LGBTQ+ identity during government-
mandated lockdowns, for some there was escape via
social media and other online avenues (Cerezo et al.,
2021; Jones et al., 2021).

In addition, the loss of authenticity, afﬁrmation and
visibility was experienced in the context of seeking
support to manage the stress and anxiety from living in
non-afﬁrming and inauthentic environments. For exam-
ple, Jones et al. (2021) reported how the loss of afﬁrming
formal support via community organisations (i.e., Theme
4) for young trans and gender diverse people in the UK left
them feeling ‘invisible and invalidated’ (p. 9) and thus
reinforcing a sense of isolation that existed prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Discussion

The purpose of this review was to synthesise the COVID-
19-related loss and grief experiences of LGBTQ+ people
reported in the qualitative research. Overall, the diversity
of experiences was focused on feelings of loss that were
sustained rather than grief per se. In particular, lost work
and livelihoods, lost connection from social and kinship
relationships and from the LGBTQ+ community. Lost
access to physical and mental health supports as well as
experiencing lost LGBTQ+ identity authenticity, afﬁr-
mation and visibility was prominent. These losses and
associated grief experiences operated in various ways in
the lives of the LGBTQ+ people.

Lucas et al.

2113

The loss of work and livelihood that was experienced
during the lockdown periods, coupled with the loss of
physical connection with LGBTQ+ friends, chosen
LGBTQ+ family and with sexual partners are what
Weenolsen (1988, 1991) called ‘secondary losses’ in that
the concrete losses directly related to another concrete
‘primary loss’ event. The losses included the loss of
physical movement due to government-imposed lock-
downs or the loss of safe LGBTQ+ spaces and leisure
activities. These concrete forms of loss are more readily
visible and their effects (e.g., loss of income, food security
and overall wellbeing) are more open to formal govern-
ment and non-government support, for example, gov-
ernment income support payments, moratoriums on rental
eviction during lockdown and a reduction in interest rates.
Threatened primary and secondary losses, such as the
threat of losing work and their sole income source (e.g.,
Bhalla & Agarwal, 2021), was for some LGBTQ+ people
just as anxiety-provoking as an actual loss in a form of
anticipatory or ‘pre-loss’ grief experience that prepares
the person for potential future loss (Reynolds & Botha,
2006; Weenolsen, 1988, 1991). As such, in supporting
LGBTQ+ people during the pandemic, it will be important
for health workers to address both actual and threatened
loss to avoid making invisible or disenfranchising
LGBTQ+ people from their pre-loss grief experiences
(Doka, 2008; Thompson & Doka, 2017).

While supports to mitigate the effects of these primary
and secondary losses are made available, unfortunately
accessing those supports are not always straightforward or
even possible as seen for members of the Indian Hijra
community who lacked the government identity evidence
required to access social security beneﬁts during the
pandemic (Pandya & Redcay, 2021). A consequence of
such situations is the further marginalisation and op-
pression of certain groups in society through sending the
message: ‘you don’t belong’, forcing either assimilation
or isolation. These messages are often experienced not
only by LGBTQ+ communities but across many other
marginalised groups in society, such as refugees and
asylum seekers (Robinson, 2014) and the world’s First
Nations peoples (Nolan-Isles et al., 2021). Health policy
and interventions focused on addressing the negative
impact of primary and secondary loss need therefore to be
designed in a way that does not further contribute to the
marginalisation of LGBTQ+ people.

In terms of lost sense of connection with LGBTQ+
social and kinship relationships as well as with the ‘queer
community’, these forms of loss relate to changes in social
status and identities, future plans and opportunities and
beliefs about how the world, society and life operates
(Weenolsen, 1988, 1991). The feelings of loss are also
related to the experiences of losing personal meaning in
life, such as what was experienced from the lost sense of

‘love, safety, and comfort’ (Philpot et al., 2021, p. 6) from
connection with the LGBTQ+ community and associated
LGBTQ+ kinship relationships. These more subtle, yet
just as acutely felt losses are not so open to verbal ar-
ticulation, visibility or necessarily of focus in formal
community supports (Weenolsen, 1988, 1991) and are
therefore more susceptible to disenfranchisement (Doka,
2008; Thompson & Doka, 2017).

The current synthesis ﬁndings resulted in the identi-
ﬁcation of various instances where LGBTQ+ people felt
the non-afﬁrming, ‘suffocating cage’ of hiding their
LGBTQ+ identity. Their true selves were rendered in-
visible as they were not able to connect with their
LGBTQ+ family and community and thus felt a sense of
loss. This form of disenfranchised, personally chosen yet
socially imposed, self-conceptual loss has been docu-
mented in previous non-COVID-related research (McNutt
& Yakushko, 2013; Prasad, 2020; Wheat & Thacker,
2019). In giving voice to such losses, it will be impor-
tant for health workers to bear witness in genuinely lis-
tening to this hidden Queerstory and promoting LGBTQ+
resilience, strength and hope through their practice.

The synthesis ﬁndings highlighted how certain com-
binations of intersecting social identities (e.g., age, gen-
der, sexuality, class and culture) are afforded certain
privileges, while other combinations are systematically
marginalised or oppressed (Crenshaw, 1989; Gkiouleka
et al., 2018). For example, the eight articles that con-
tributed to the ﬁrst theme of lost work and livelihood
included participants from predominantly Brown, Black
or Latinx countries of low socioeconomic status (India or
Brazil) who identiﬁed as a transgender woman or Hijra, of
working-class or living with HIV. This compares with the
eight articles that contributed to the second theme of lost
social and kinship connection in which the participants
were predominantly from largely White-European
countries of higher socioeconomic status (USA, UK,
Canada, Australia, Portugal), who identiﬁed as cis-male,
and gay or lesbian.

This contrasting focus between concrete losses related
to physical survival versus abstract
losses related to
connection and relationship suggests intersecting op-
pressions imposed and privileges afforded to certain
sexualities, genders, social classes and cultures by a cis-
heteronormative society within a pandemic. This phe-
nomenon has been seen in other pandemics such as the
HIV/AIDS epidemic (Abreu et al., 2021; Braksmajer &
London, 2021; Quinn et al., 2021).
In the cis-
that dominate the world’s
heteronormative societies
countries, the closer a person’s identities align with or
assimilate into the ‘ideal’ (i.e., cis-gendered, heterosexual,
white-European, religious, middle/upper class adult) the
higher the societal privilege – the converse often leading to
social exclusion, isolation and oppression (Chan & Henesy,

2114

Qualitative Health Research 32(14)

2018). Intersectionality is an important factor in LGBTQ+
life and identity and important for health practitioners to
take into consideration to avoid ironically contributing to
marginalisation in the name of belonging and social con-
nection (McNair, 2017).

Limitations and Future Research Directions

While this synthesis provided insight into the loss ex-
periences of LGBTQ+ people during the COVID-19
pandemic,
it cannot be extrapolated to the potential
grief involved, nor to the full breadth of LGBTQ+ lived
experience reported in the qualitative literature. Repeating
the synthesis with perhaps a revised set of inclusion
criteria is suggested to explore such pandemic-related
LGBTQ+ lived experience in greater depth. How
LGBTQ+ people who lived through the HIV/AIDS
pandemic experienced the current COVID-19 pan-
demic, in terms of their resilience, growth and meaning
reconstruction may further contribute to a narrative of
strength, hope and meaning within the qualitative liter-
ature (Walsh, 2020).

In the synthesis, it was not possible to disaggregate
participants’ sexualities and gender
identities, which
limits exploration of how intersecting identities inﬂuence
loss (and grief) within a cis-heteronormative world. Fu-
ture research that aids such disaggregation while also
resisting the cis-heteronormative drive to categorise or
create binaries from ﬂuid concepts is warranted. Trans-
lation of the synthesis ﬁndings into health practice can
focus on how non-medicalised approaches to cultivating
people’s belonging and social connectedness (e.g., social
prescribing) (Zurynski et al., 2020), also known as the
‘connection prescription’ (Martino et al., 2017), can be
‘queer-loss-informed’ to make visible the concrete and
abstract loss experienced and ensure LGBTQ+ identities
and lived experiences during this global health crisis are
enfranchised.

Conclusion

cis-heteronormative

Loss and grief for LGBTQ+ people share commonalities
with their cis-heterosexual counterparts, as well as a
uniqueness owing to living ‘queer’, that is as a LGBTQ+
person, within a
society. The
COVID-19 pandemic has brought new and has ampliﬁed
existing, challenges regarding loss – particularly in being
afforded (or not) the right to experience loss as a LGBTQ+
person. This article is the ﬁrst to present the qualitative
experiences of LGBTQ+ people’s COVID-19-related
losses published in the literature and provides insight
into the many layered and often disenfranchised nature of
LGBTQ+ people’s loss and grief during times of pan-
demic brought about by dominant cis-heteronormative

cultural norms that pervade many of the world’s societies.
In challenging cis-heteronormativity during the COVID-
19 pandemic, it is important that health workers and
services elevate, making visible, these voices and lived
experiences of LGBTQ+ people. One step in this direction
is through consideration of the sense of relationship,
community and identity authenticity that underscores
many of the COVID-19-related loss experiences reported
internationally in this synthesis.
