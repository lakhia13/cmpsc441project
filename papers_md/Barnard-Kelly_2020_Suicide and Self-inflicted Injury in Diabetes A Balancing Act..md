Abstract
Glycemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remains a challenge for many, despite the availability of modern diabetes 
technology. While technologies have proven glycemic benefits and may reduce excess mortality in some populations, both 
mortality  and  complication  rates  remain  significantly  higher  in  T1DM  than  the  general  population.  Diabetes  technology 
can reduce some burdens of diabetes self-management, however, it may also increase anxiety, stress, and diabetes-related 
distress. Additional workload associated with diabetes technologies and the dominant focus on metabolic control may be 
at the expense of quality-of-life. Diabetes is associated with significantly increased risk of suicidal ideation, self-harm, and 
suicide. The risk increases for those with diabetes and comorbid mood disorder. For example, the prevalence of depression 
is significantly higher in people with diabetes than the general population, and thus, people with diabetes are at even higher 
risk of suicide. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 24% rise in US national suicide rates between 
1999 and 2014, the highest in 30 years. In the United Kingdom, 6000 suicides occur annually. Rates of preventable self-injury 
mortality stand at 29.1 per 100 000 population. Individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of suicide, being three to four 
times more likely to attempt suicide than the general population. Furthermore, adolescents aged 15 to 19 are most likely to 
present at emergency departments for self-inflicted injuries (9.6 per 1000 visits), with accidents, alcohol-related injuries, and 
self-harm being the strongest risk factors for suicide, the second leading cause of death among 10 to 24 year olds. While we 
have developed tools to improve glycemic control, we must be cognizant that the psychological burden of chronic disease is 
a significant problem for this vulnerable population. It is crucial to determine the psychosocial and behavioral predictors to 
uptake and continued use of technology in order to aid the identification of those individuals most likely to realize benefits of 
any intervention as well as those individuals who may require more support to succeed with technology.

Background

Suicide and Self-inflicted Injury

Suicide  is  the  leading  cause  of  death  among  young  people 
aged 20 to 34.1,2 In addition to depression, other risk factors 
include other psychiatric disorders, somatic diseases, past his-
tory  of  self-harm,  family  breakdown,  violence,  poor  social 
conditions, poverty, imprisonment, unemployment, and social 
isolation.1  Men  are  more  likely  to  commit  suicide  than 
women, with approximately three times as many men dying 
as  a  result  of  suicide  compared  to  women.1  One  reason 
mooted being that they are less likely to ask for help or talk 
about depressive or suicidal feelings.1 Talking about suicide 
remains highly stigmatized. The isolation that suicidal people 
feel  can  be  reinforced  by  a  judgmental  approach  in  which 
their behavior is viewed as manipulative or selfish.3

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported 
in 2016 a 24% rise in the US national suicide rate between 
1999 and 2014.4 Currently at a rate of 13 in 100 000 people, 
the  US  suicide  rate  is  the  the  highest  in  30  years.5  In  the 
United  Kingdom,  almost  6000  suicides  occurred  in  2017 
representing  a  small  change  on  2016  figures  of  5965.6 
Suicide  risk  for  those  with  chronic  health  conditions  is 
widely reported to be significantly higher than for people in 
the  general  population,  with  the  risk  in  diabetes  being 
approximately  three  to  four  times  higher.7-9  In  the  general 
population, the intentional self-inflected injury presents two 
sides; it has a high in-hospital mortality, low mortality post-
discharge, but then high recidivism rates. Thus, suicide risk 
increases following hospital discharge in psychiatric patients 
or those admitted for self-harm.10,11 The rates of self-harm 
and suicide could be underestimated in those with T1DM as 
each year large numbers of patients with diabetes present to 
emergency  departments  with  hypoglycemic  episodes  of 
“unknown” etiology.12 It is possible that a significant pro-
portion of them could be intentional overdoses.12 Data from 
one study of 160 cases of insulin overdose show that 90% 
were  either  suicidal  or  parasuicidal,  whereas  only  5%  of 
cases  were  deemed  accidental.12  Death  certificates  or 
International  Classification  of  Diseases  codes  are  used  to 
determine causes of death; however, these may be unreliable 
in adult patients with T1DM.13

Diabetes and Self-inflicted Injury/Suicide

Glycemic  control  in T1DM  remains  a  challenge  for  many, 
despite  the  availability  of  modern  insulin  analogs,14  the 
improving accuracy of glucose monitoring,15,16 and advances 
in diabetes technologies with the widening use of intensive 
insulin therapy. While new technologies have proven bene-
fits  in  avoiding  diabetes-related  complications17  and  may 
have  reduced  excess  mortality  in  some  populations,18  both 
mortality and complication rates remain significantly higher 
in  T1DM  when  compared  to  the  general  population.19,20 
Furthermore, the additional workload associated with diabe-
tes technologies and the dominant focus on glycemic control, 
at the expense of quality of life, serves to increase the burden 
of diabetes for many.

A systematic review by Pompii et al21 reported that indi-
viduals with diabetes have an increased risk of suicide than 
the general population. In addition, diabetes is known to be 
associated with greater suicidal ideation.21 People with dia-
betes show greater hopelessness and greater rates of depres-
sion. This high suicide risk is present across ethnic diversities 
within  diabetes,  for  example,  African-American  patients 
with T1DM are also reported to be three to four times more 
likely to attempt suicide than those without diabetes (13.3% 
vs 3.5%).22 In the general population, among suicide survi-
vors,  7%  eventually  succeed,  23%  reattempt  with  nonfatal 
consequences,  and  70%  never  reattempt.23  In  the  United 
States, intentional self-harm (ISI) is the tenth leading cause 

of  death.  ISI  includes  both,  suicidal  and  nonsuicidal  self-
injury  such  as  cutting,  burning,  head  banging,  scratching, 
asphyxiation, poisoning, and self-hitting.24,25 There are also 
associated financial consequences, for example, there were 
44 965 suicides in 2016 costing about $11.8 billion loss in 
productivity26,27  not  counting  the  cost  of  emergency  room 
visits  for  nonsuicidal  intentional  self-inflicted  injury  (ISI). 
Such  incidents  saw  a  dramatic  increase  between  2001  and 
2016 of 42%.28

Statistics  showed  that  there  are  800  000  suicide  deaths 
annually  worldwide,29  half  of  them  with  prior  ISI.30 
Adolescents  aged  15  to  19  are  most  likely  to  present  at 
emergency  departments  for  self-inflicted  injuries  (9.6  per 
1000 visits),31 self-harm being one of the strongest risk fac-
tors for suicide, the second leading cause of death among 10 
to 24 year olds. Risks of self-inflicted injury for those with 
chronic health conditions are significantly higher, with risk 
in  diabetes  approximately  doubled.7-9  Compared  with  the 
unaffected  individuals,  those  with  type  1  diabetes  had  a 
higher  standardized  mortality  ratio  (SMR)  relating  to  this 
outcome: in women, the SMR was 2.53 (95% CI 1.65-3.89), 
and in men, 1.80 (1.32-2.47).32

Ferro et al33 report that mood disorder moderates the asso-
ciation between chronic illness and suicidal thoughts (odds 
ratio = 1.89 [1.06-5.28]). For those without mood disorder, 
with or without chronic illness, the probability of reporting 
suicidal thoughts is low and stable. Among participants with 
both  mood  disorder  and  chronic  illness,  the  probability  of 
suicidal  thoughts  is  significantly  greater  than  those  with 
mood  disorder  and  no  chronic  illness. The  authors  call  for 
attention  to  the  need  to  address  the  problem  of  suicidal 
thoughts  and  behavior  among  vulnerable  adolescents  and 
young adults with a chronic illness.

The relationship between suicide and diabetes is complex 
and  multifaceted  (Figure  1).  Deaths  related  to  diabetes 
including self-harm and suicide, like in the general popula-
tion, are more prominent in decreased urbanization (ie, rural 
areas), high poverty, and lower health provider density.34 In 
the general population, depression is highly correlated with 
suicidal ideation35 and suicide attempt. In chronic diseases, 
suicidal risk increases with poor quality of life and general 
functioning,  as  well  as  the  presence  of  chronic  pain.  Both 
these  features. 
depression  and  diabetes  contribute 
Individuals  with  T1DM  have  significantly  higher  rates  of 
depression than those without T1DM.36 In the general popu-
lation, suicidal ideation is associated with negative outcomes 
such  as  distress,  psychiatric  comorbidity,35  and  increased 
health service utilization.37 All of which are more common in 
people with diabetes. Among those with T1DM, suicidal ide-
ation  is  associated  with  serious  noncompliance  with  the 
medical regimen37; however, as in depression and diabetes, 
the direction of the relationship is unclear.

In  response  to  the  2017  US  Preventive  Services  Task 
Force  recommendation  for  routine  depression  screening, 
Myers  et  al38  argued  that  people  with  diabetes  should  be

screened for suicidal ideation in the presence of a mood dis-
order as suicide could be more “easily achieved” due to the 
access of this population to potential lethal medication such 
as insulin. Those with T1DM must adapt to age-related life 
transitions, while also dealing with the demands of diabetes 
and  these  stressors  may  have  long-term  consequences  on 
depression and overall wellbeing.38 This can be most diffi-
cult in the adolescent period, where normal physical and psy-
chological development occur and greater diabetes  distress 
and  depression  are  seen.39,40 Adolescents  and  young  adults 
with  T1DM  have  61%  higher  odds  of  reporting  suicidal 
thoughts than those without diabetes.36 The risk for suicide 
attempts  is  highest  soon  after  young  people  are  diagnosed 
with chronic illness. Such suicidal ideation has been identi-
fied as one of the strongest predictors of suicide behaviors 
and  completion.41  The  2012  National  Strategy  for  Suicide 
Prevention promotes healthcare settings as one of the most 
promising  and  critical  environments  to  implement  suicide 
prevention practices.42

In suicide victims with T1DM, insulin as a suicide method 
covered half of the self-poisoning cases (mostly male), while 
the proportion in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
was  13%.7  This  perhaps  reflects  the  availability  of  such  a 
potentially lethal drug as insulin to different cohorts. Alcohol 
further increases the risk of hypoglycemia in the multifactorial 
process of suicide among diabetes patients. Alcohol was a fac-
tor in 24.5% of victims with T2DM being under the influence 
of alcohol when they died, compared to 44.4% in type 1 diabe-
tes  and  46.6%  of  those  without  diabetes  (P  =  .007).43  The 
authors  recommended  that  physicians  who  treat  diabetes 
patients  should  evaluate  co-occurring  depression  and  sub-
stance abuse, both of which are major risk factors of suicide. 
Self-poisoning, especially with insulin, was the most common 

method of suicide among those with type 1 diabetes. In one 
study,44  victims  with  T1DM  suffered  more  commonly  from 
depression (44.4%) than those with T2DM (23.5%) or those 
without diabetes (19.9%) (P = .006) and chose self-poisoning 
as their suicide method (48.1% vs 31.4% and 18.0%, respec-
tively, P ≤ .001).

It is further noted in the literature that during adolescence, 
insulin omission and suboptimal diabetes care can be seen as 
a form of self-inflicted injuries. Suicidal ideations caused by 
depressive  state  due  to  diabetes  and  self-inflicted  injury  or 
suicide  can  also  be  underreported  at  this  age.37  Risks  are 
increased for adolescents with diabetes as access to insulin 
makes the adolescent population with diabetes more vulner-
able than the general teenager population that may suffer the 
same mood disorders that accompany this stage of life.45

Diabetes and Technologies

The use of diabetes technologies to support self-management 
has  increased  rapidly,  particularly  among  pediatric  popula-
tion. The 2016 to 2017 National Paediatric Diabetes Audit of 
children  and  young  people  in  England  and  Wales  reports 
32.2% pump use among this population.46 This contains con-
siderable  variability,  with  45.7%  of  0  to  4  year  olds  using 
pumps  compared  to  only  27%  of  15  to  19  year  olds. 
Notwithstanding,  these  numbers  reflect  a  rapid  increase  in 
pump  use  among  children  and  young  people  from  8%  in 
2011. The usage numbers for adults with T1DM have grown 
more slowly with 15.6% use in 2016 to 2017, up from less 
than 2% use in 2011.47 In the United States, in T1D Exchange 
Registry, insulin pump use increased from 57% to 63% and 
CGM  use  increased  from  7%  to  30%  from  2010  to  2018, 
respectively.48  There  are  no  official  figures  for  continuous 

Barnard-Kelly et al

glucose monitor use, however, it is estimated that approxi-
mately 10% of people with T1DM use this technology in the 
United Kingdom currently. The use of flash glucose monitor-
ing is increasing, driven in part by a campaign to force all 
commissioning groups to provide this technology for free as 
part of National Health Service provision. Abbott reported in 
January 2019 that there are 200 000 users of the FreeStyle 
Libre  system  in  the  United  States,  with  a  further  800  000 
users globally.49

Despite  the  advancement  of  technologies  and  reliable 
measures of diabetes distress, there remains no routine inter-
vention  in  clinical  care  to  alleviate  distress  and  improve 
quality of life.50 The psychosocial sequelae of diabetes have 
been recognized in a number of UK and international guide-
lines that have set out the standards of care that people with 
diabetes should expect; however, there remains a gulf in the 
provision  of  psychological  care,  with  widespread  evidence 
of poor service despite clinical need.51 Structured education 
programs  have  been  developed  and  tested  in  a  systematic 
manner, widely shown to be cost-effective but implementa-
tion remains challenging with availability and uptake poor.52 
Diabetes and its treatment contribution can be burdensome 
and it is interesting to note that suicides occur in people using 
diabetes technologies as well as those who do not. It has long 
been argued that treatments as well as disease can negatively 
impact quality of life and it would appear that diabetes tech-
nologies are no different.

Psychological and Behavioral Factors

In addition to patients’ perceptions rooted in their previous 
experience,  unrealistic  expectations  of  technologies  may 
lead  to  disappointment  and  discontinuation  of  the  device. 
General “tech savviness” can also play a role in acceptance 
in that those more familiar and comfortable with technology 
may  be  more  willing  to  trust  the  system.  Furthermore,  the 
time and effort required to invest in building device-related 
skills,  trust,  and  acceptance  may  be  underestimated  (and 
often is), as these range from technical handling to integrat-
ing the system information into one’s diabetes self-manage-
ment and everyday living without intrusive disruptions.

Therefore,  psychological  and  behavioral  factors  play  a 
critical  role  in  the  acceptance  of  diabetes  technologies  and 
the trust users put in them. It is crucial to determine the psy-
chosocial and behavioral predictors to uptake and continued 
use of technology in order to aid the identification of those 
individuals most likely to realize benefits of any intervention 
as well as those individuals who may require more support to 
succeed with technology. Additional individual user charac-
teristics  (eg,  diabetes  belief  systems  and  self-management 
skills)  may  be  predictive  of  technology  acceptance,  trust, 
use, and benefit. At present, little is known about psychologi-
cal, behavioral, and social factors that contribute to diabetes 
technology adoption and successful use.

While the psychological burden of diabetes may lead to 
the increased risk of depression, it does not fully account for 
it.  Some  common  risk  factors  (low  socioeconomic  status, 
irregular  sleep  patterns,  lack  of  physical  activity,  and  poor 
diet) may play an important role in activating common phys-
iological  pathways  (stress  and  inflammation  systems)  that 
promote and reinforce diabetes and depression.

MRI scanning of the brains of people with type 1 diabetes 
has shown that prefrontal glutamate-glutamine-gamma-ami-
nobutyric acid levels are higher than in healthy control sub-
jects,  and  these  levels  correlate  with  mild  depressive 
symptoms.53 Decreased treatment adherence in patients with 
T1DM  may  reflect  impairments  in  decision-making  and 
underlying associated deficits in working memory and exec-
utive functioning.54

impairments 

Beyond depression, diabetes and suicidal risk may share 
pathways that may participate in their co-occurrence. First, 
(particularly  decision  making) 
cognitive 
reported  in  diabetes  have  also  been  shown  in  individuals 
without  diabetes  having  a  past  history  of  suicide  attempt 
independent  of  depression.55  Second,  certain  factors  (low 
socioeconomic  status,  irregular  sleep  patterns,  and  lack  of 
physical  activity)  may  play  an  important  role  in  activating 
common  physiological  pathways  (stress  and  inflammation 
systems)  that  reinforce  diabetes  and  depression.56  Third, 
growing  evidence  shows  the  specific  involvement  of  HPA 
axis impairment and inflammation in suicidal vulnerability. 
For example, C-reactive protein levels are increased in sui-
cide  attempters  independent  of  sociodemographic  factors 
and presence of chronic diseases.57

Pompili et al reported that diabetes is associated with an 
increased risk of suicide, independently from the severity of 
depressive condition, and that a perceived poor quality of life 
was related to low self-efficacy, high hopelessness, and sui-
cidality.58  Indeed,  a  hopeless  feeling  regarding  the  illness 
might be associated with risk of suicide attempts, and also 
with neglect of health care and lack of motivation to adhere 
to medical instructions.59

Factors  related  to  personality  and  individual  differ-
ences are of interest because they are affected by the envi-
ronment,  and  affect  cognition  and  emotion,  and  because 
some common features seem as well to represent both vul-
nerability  traits  of  suicidal  behavior  as  to  influence  the 
course of the diabetes. For instance, individual differences 
in  self-regulatory  capacity  (eg,  executive  function  and 
emotion  regulation  skills)  are  associated  with  diabetes 
management  during  late  adolescence60,61  and  may  affect 
both  self-  and  social-regulation  processes.  Otherwise, 
recent psychological models of suicidal behavior empha-
size the role of hopelessness, impulsivity, perfectionism, 
problem-solving ability, cognitive rigidity, and belonging-
ness and burdensomeness.62

Thus, further research is needed to identify factors pre-
dicting  depression  and  suicide,  comparing  biological 

1014

(inflammation),  cognitive  and  psychological  (family  and 
individual),  and  environmental  (particularly  sensitivity  to 
social adversity) risk factors in large population-based pro-
spective cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes who would 
be, or would not be, candidate for new diabetes technolo-
gies. One may hypothesize that people who would receive 
such  technologies  may  be  an  enriched  population  in  risk 
factors of suicidal behavior, common to poor management 
of  diabetes.  In  this  case,  personalized  psychological  and 
social  management  should  be  implemented  in  association 
with diabetes technologies.

With the evolution of diabetes technology, type 1 diabetes 
management  in  the  21st  century  is  becoming  ever  more 
patient-centered. Personalized, ongoing education, as well as 
psychological and social support, can be delivered through 
telemedicine, mobile apps, and online modules.63,64

Support Opportunities

If  appropriate  and  timely  help  and  emotional  support  is 
offered to people who are experiencing deep unhappiness 
and  distress,  this  can  reduce  the  risk  self-harm.  An 
empathic approach and being open to understanding sui-
cide and suicidal ideation can help those at risk by letting 
them know that it is okay for them to share. As such, the 
prevention of suicide is not the exclusive responsibility of 
any  one  sector  of  society.  Healthcare  professionals,  as 
well as family members or friends, can all play a part in 
recognizing  and  reducing  the  risks.  Constructively  chal-
lenging  personal  assumptions  regarding  self-harm  and 
suicidal behaviors and showing care and respect for those 
individuals at risk of suicide can provide opportunities to 
share feelings and  help prevent such events. It is argued 
that  suicide  is  recognized  as  a  major  public  health  issue 
more prevalent in the diabetes population and that studies 
reducing  rate  of  self-injury  (suicide)  attempts  should  be 
given high priority.

Conclusion

Despite all advances in diabetes care in recent years, diabetes 
burden  still  impacts  lives  for  people  living  with  diabetes. 
Developing screening strategies for self-harm and suicide to 
identify  patients  with  diabetes  at  risk  and  provide  prompt 
referral and evaluation of these to a certified psychologist or 
psychiatrist  is  essential.  Data  from  diabetes  technologies 
may be a tool for identifying those at risk.
