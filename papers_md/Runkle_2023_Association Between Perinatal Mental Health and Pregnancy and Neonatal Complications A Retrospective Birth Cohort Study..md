Abstract

Background:  Maternal mental health as an important precursor to reproductive and neonatal 
complications remains understudied in the US, particularly in the Southeastern region, despite 
high medical costs, maternal morbidity, and infant burden.

Objective:  This study sought to estimate the incidence of perinatal mental health disorders and 
the associated increased risk of leading pregnancy and infant complications.

Methods:  A population-based retrospective birth cohort of childbirth hospitalizations and 
readmissions was constructed for women in South Carolina, 1999 to 2017. Prevalence rates were 
calculated for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), severe mental illness (SMI), and 
mental disorders of pregnancy (MDP). Poisson regression models using generalized estimating 
equations were used to estimate adjusted relative risks for the association between mental 
health conditions and severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational 
diabetes, cesarean section, preterm birth, and low birthweight.

Results:  The most prevalent maternal mental condition was MDP (3.9%), followed by PMAD 
(2.7%) and SMI (0.13%). PMAD was associated with a higher risk of severe maternal morbidity, 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section, as well as a higher risk of preterm birth 
and low birthweight infants. SMI was associated with low birthweight, hypertensive disorders of

maternal morbidity, preterm birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, low birthweight, and 
cesarean section. Each maternal mental health outcome was associated with an elevated risk for 
hospital readmissions up to 45 days after childbirth.

Discussion:  Results demonstrate the escalating burden of PMAD and MDP for pregnant 
populations over time, with important consequences related to maternal and infant morbidity.

INTRODUCTION

One understudied research priority pertains to the influence of maternal mental health as 
an important precursor to maternal and infant morbidity (Baker et al., 2020; Easter et al., 
2018; Franks et al., 2017). Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, are 
among the most common morbidities in perinatal women, affecting up to 20% of women 
during and after pregnancy (Baker et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2019b). In the United States 
(US), mental health conditions are the leading cause of preventable pregnancy-related deaths 
across all trimesters and in the first 12 months postpartum (Trost et al., 2021). Mental health 
disorders are drastically under-diagnosed and under-treated in the perinatal period, with just 
30% of perinatal women with depression identified in a clinical setting (Cox et al., 2016; 
Margiotta et al., 2021). For those 30% identified, less than 7% receive adequate treatment 
(Cox et al., 2016). Despite a high morbidity and mortality rate, perinatal mental health 
disorders remain understudied. More population-based epidemiological studies are needed 
to demonstrate the prevalence of these conditions during pregnancy and in the postpartum 
period (O’Hara & Wisner, 2014), particularly the co-occurrence of maternal mental health 
disorders and pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes.

The identification and treatment of mental health conditions in pregnant people should be 
a critical component of prenatal care and the prevention of adverse maternal and neonatal 
outcomes. During pregnancy, poor mental health can increase the likelihood of preterm 
labor, postpartum mental health issues, preeclampsia, hypertension, diabetes, suicide, and 
infanticide (Cox et al., 2016; Franks et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2019a). Infants born to 
birthing people with untreated mental health disorders are at higher risk for low birthweight 
and long-term childhood and adolescent behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems (Cox 
et al., 2016; Franks et al., 2017; Margiotta et al., 2021; Watson et al., 2019a). Additionally, 
untreated maternal mental health conditions cost US healthcare system upwards of $15 
billion dollars every year (Cox et al., 2016). Untreated mental health conditions in women 
from conception through 5 years postpartum cost the state of Texas alone over $2.2 billion 
in 2019 (Margiotta et al., 2021). Those with untreated mental health conditions often 
experience reduced productivity, must rely on public sector services such as SNAP benefits 
and Medicaid, and accrue higher long-term healthcare costs (Margiotta et al., 2021).

Perinatal mental health remains understudied in the U.S., particularly in the Southeastern 
region. Even less is known about the association between maternal mental health and 
high maternal morbidity and infant health burden. This study examined the association 
between mental health disorders during the perinatal period and the increased risk of leading 
pregnancy and infant complications using a retrospective birth cohort in South Carolina, 
1999–2017. Secondary aims included examining (1) trends over time in maternal mental 
disorders; (2) racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and infant complications; (3) the 
risk of postpartum readmissions for women with a perinatal mental health condition; and 
(4) estimating the excess cost of hospitalized childbirths and postpartum readmissions for 
perinatal mental health conditions. Finally, we conducted additional disaggregated analysis 
on perinatal depressive and anxiety disorders to determine the independent effect of each 
outcome on maternal and neonatal complications. Findings will address an important 
knowledge gap on the psychological well-being of pregnant people and shed light on priority 
mental health conditions that need more attention during the critical period of pregnancy.

METHODS

Hospital childbirth discharges and readmission data

A retrospective birth cohort design was used to longitudinally examine the maternal mental 
health experience for pregnant populations. Hospital childbirth discharge hospitalizations 
were obtained from the SC Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office Health and Demographics 
division for all hospital labor and deliveries in South Carolina from 1999 to 2017. 
Postpartum hospital readmissions for up to 45 days after the childbirth event were also 
obtained. Hospital childbirth discharge and postpartum readmission visits were linked with 
infant birth and infant death records using a unique maternal identification number. Only 
childbirth hospitalizations for women with a residence in South Carolina, with a gestation 
week of 20 weeks or more, and age 18–55 years were included in the final sample. The 
data were pulled and provided to the investigative team for childbirth-related hospitalizations 
based on the Uniform Billing (UB) form and were restricted to those for which the sex or 
“gender of patient” (i.e., male, female, or unknown) was female. The North Carolina State 
University’s Institutional Review Board deemed this research exempt.

Mental health outcomes

Borrowing from McKee et al. (McKee et al., 2020), primary outcomes of interest were 
defined using the hospital childbirth record at discharge: 1) perinatal mood and anxiety 
disorders (PMAD), 2) serious mental illness conditions (SMI), and 3) maternal mental 
disorders of pregnancy (MDP). MDP is a diagnosis used to document any mental disorder 
complicating pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium (Kelly et al., 2001). PMAD and SMI 
are specific diagnosis codes to record mood or anxiety disorders and severe mental illness 
during pregnancy and up to one year after childbirth. For this analysis, we operationalize 
perinatal mental health to include 1) primary maternal mental illness – all mental disorders 
that preexisted or recurred during gestation and incident conditions that emerged during the 
prenatal or postpartum periods (i.e., PMAD, SMI) and 2) secondary maternal mental illness 
– any mental disorder that first emerged during pregnancy (i.e., MDP) (Montagnoli et al., 
2020).

All International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis and procedure codes, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), used to define each condition, can be found 
in Supplemental Table 1. In October 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
(CMS) and commercial health insurers transitioned from coding hospital administration 
records using ICD-9 to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) diagnosis and 
procedure codes, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). We relied on 
published equivalence mapping to convert ICD-10 data to ICD-9 codes to maintain 
continuity in how conditions were coded throughout the study (Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services, 2021).

Maternal and infant complications

Recent research has made the linkage between maternal mental health disorders (e.g., 
anxiety and depression) during the preconception, prenatal, and postpartum periods and 
elevated risk for leading maternal obstetric complications, including severe maternal 
morbidity (Brown et al., 2022; Wall-Wieler et al., 2019); preterm birth (Anderson & Cacola, 
2017); cesarean section, either elective or emergent; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; 
and gestational diabetes mellitus (Montagnoli et al., 2020). Pregnant populations with 
gestational diabetes are two-fold more likely to develop postpartum depression (Nicklas 
et al., 2013). Prenatal antidepressant usage has been associated with preeclampsia, although 
a recent systematic review revealed inadequate evidence of harm posed (Viswanathan et 
al., 2021). For this analysis, maternal complications included: severe maternal morbidity, 
excluding blood transfusions; gestational diabetes; and cesarean section (defined in Supp 
Table 1). A widely available algorithm published by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention was used to identify 21 indicators for severe maternal morbidity while 
accounting for the length of stay, in-hospital maternal deaths, and delivery type (e.g., 
primary or repeat cesarean); excluding ectopic or molar pregnancy or childbirth-related 
hospitalization in which abortive procedures were performed (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2018). A blood transfusion-related severe maternal morbidity diagnosis 
was omitted due to the incomplete record-keeping of hospitals concerning blood volume 
transferred (Snowden et al., 2021). Infant complications included the following: low 
birthweight (i.e., defined as an infant weight at birth 2500 grams or less; ACOG Committee 
on Practice Bulletins—Obstetrics, 2002). Perinatal care at the threshold of viability,” 2002) 
and preterm birth (i.e., defined as a birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation) (ACOG, 
2022).

Risk factors for maternal mental disorders include maternal age younger than 20 years 
or older than 35 years, maternal infections, episodic or inadequate prenatal care, or other 
forms of maternal distress (e.g., nutritional deficiency or three or more pregnancies) (Davies 
et al., 2020). Covariates included the following maternal factors: age in years (19 or 
less, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 or more), educational attainment (high school or less, some 
college, college, and more than college), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, 
Other, non-Hispanic White), insurance status (uninsured, Medicare/Medicaid, commercial 
insurance, U.S. Veteran Affairs (VA)), Kotelchuk prenatal care adequacy index (inadequate, 
intermediate, adequate, and adequate plus) (Kotelchuck, 1994), smoking status (yes/no),

substance use disorder coded using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (Supplemental Table 1) 
(Heslin & Elixhauser, 2016), maternal infections affecting the newborn or fetus (ICD-9-CM: 
760.2), obesity (ICD-9-CM: 278), parity (no prior childbirths, one prior childbirth, two 
or more prior childbirth), and year of discharge. Race and ethnicity were collected on 
the UB form and coded as patient race that included the following categories: White, 
African-American, Asian, American Indian, Other, and Hispanic. Due to very small sample 
sizes, Asian people (n=10,389, 1.13%), American Indian people (n=2,790, 0.30%), and 
Other people (n=41,003, 4.45%) were categorized into the “other race” category. In 
comparison, the sample size for the other racial/ethnic groups were as follows: White people 
(n=523,703, 56.85%), Black/African-American people (n=300,371, 32.60%), and Hispanic 
people (n=42,873, 4.65%). Nonmetro compared to a metro maternal residence was coded 
using 2010 rural-urban community area codes (RUCA) to zip code areas by relying on the 
5-tiered coding schema (USDA, 2022).

Hospital cost data

We also compared the total charges (i.e., dollar amount) as received on the UB-92 billing file 
for each childbirth hospitalization across maternal mental health conditions to estimate the 
excess cost for these conditions over time.

Statistical analysis

Maternal characteristics were compared across each primary maternal mental health 
outcome using chi-square goodness of fit for categorical variables. To account for the 
correlated binary mental health outcomes captured longitudinally for each woman over 
multiple childbirth events (Zou & Donner, 2011), we used a modified Poisson regression 
approach with robust error variances to estimate the group-specific incidence rate ratio 
per 10,000 childbirths (IRR) and to compute the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) for each outcome (Zhao, 2013). The first set of models examined each 
primary mental health outcome (i.e., PMAD, SMI, MDP) during pregnancy, separately 
adjusted for maternal risk factors. The second set of models examined individual primary 
mental health outcomes during pregnancy and the addition of maternal or infant health 
complications separately at childbirth. The third set of models examined the interaction 
between maternal/infant complications at childbirth and maternal race/ethnicity. The fourth 
set of models examined the risk of postpartum hospital readmissions for maternal mental 
health outcomes separately. All final models included covariate adjustment for maternal age, 
race/ethnicity, education, insurance payor, substance use disorder, adequacy of prenatal care, 
parity, smoking, obesity, maternal infections affecting the newborn/fetus, and urban vs. rural 
residence.

Finally, we performed a separate sensitivity analysis to examine PMAD disaggregated into 
depression and anxiety disorders. All statistical analyses were performed in SAS software 
(version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Characteristics of maternal mental health disorders

Page 6

Our sample comprised 913,330 hospital discharges for childbirth; 24,201 (2.65%) involved 
perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), 1,230 (0.13%) severe mental illness (SMI), 
and 35,435 (3.88%) maternal disorders of pregnancy (MDP) (Table 1, Table S2). The rate 
of PMAD and MDP has been steadily on the rise, increasing each year from 1999 to 2017 
(Figure 1). The prevalence of PMAD was higher among White women, women with some 
college, and those with adequate followed by inadequate prenatal care. The prevalence of 
SMI and MDP was much more likely among women who received inadequate compared to 
adequate prenatal care. Shared maternal risk factors for PMAD, SMI, and MDP included 
older maternal age (i.e., 30 to 39 years), Medicaid enrollment, low educational attainment, 
substance use during pregnancy, urban residence, obesity, presence of an infection affecting 
the newborn or fetus, and having at least one prior pregnancy (Table 1).

Racial and ethnic differences in maternal mental health outcomes

After adjusting for other maternal factors, White compared to Black, Hispanic, or “other 
race” pregnant populations were the most likely to be diagnosed with PMAD, SMI, and 
MDP (Table 2). However, compared to Hispanic women, Black women were 2.76 times 
(95% CI: 1.77, 4.30) and 1.43 times (95% CI: 1.32, 1.33) more likely to be diagnosed with 
SMI or MDP, respectively. We noted a similar elevated risk profile for SMI and MDP among 
women identifying as Black compared to those in the “other race” category.

Increased risk for maternal and infant complications

For women with PMAD, we observed a higher risk of obstetric complications, including 
severe maternal morbidity (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.27, 1.58), hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.1.19, 1.34), and cesarean section (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.15, 
1.21) (Table 2). Among those with PMAD, the risk of preterm (RR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.35, 
1.45) and low birthweight infants (RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.41) was also higher compared 
to childbirths without a PMAD diagnosis (Table 3). The incidence of low birthweight, 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean section was higher for pregnant people 
with SMI. For those diagnosed with an MDP, the risk of severe maternal morbidity, preterm 
birth, gestational hypertension, low birthweight, and cesarean section were significantly 
higher than for those without an MDP diagnosis.

Increased risk for postpartum readmissions

We observed an increased risk for postpartum hospital readmissions for each maternal 
mental health outcome up to 45 days after the childbirth event (Figure 2). Women were 3.9 
times (95% CI: 2.73, 5.54) more likely to be readmitted if a PMAD diagnosis was present 
at childbirth. Similarly, the risk of hospital readmission in the postpartum period was 5-fold 
higher for women with an SMI at childbirth and 2.6 times higher for women diagnosed with 
an MDP at or around the time of childbirth.

Sensitivity analysis

Page 7

For pregnant women with a depression or anxiety diagnosis during or around the time 
of childbirth, there was excess risk for each maternal and infant complication (Table S3). 
However, higher risk for severe maternal morbidity, cesarean section, hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, or low birthweight complications were 
detected among women with a perinatal anxiety disorder compared to women without 
anxiety.

Higher cost of childbirths with mental health conditions

The average cost of a hospital childbirth associated with a PMAD ($4,029 more per 
childbirth), SMI ($1,956 more per childbirth), or MDP diagnosis ($1,968 more per 
childbirth) was significantly higher than childbirths not related to a maternal mental health 
outcome (Table 4), and these costs have been on the rise (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION

This study is the first to examine maternal morbidity associated with perinatal mental 
health disorders in the Southeastern United States. Similar to other studies, our results 
demonstrated the escalating burden of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) and 
mental disorders during pregnancy (MDP) over time with important consequences related 
to maternal and infant morbidity (McKee et al., 2020). A PMAD or MDP diagnosis during 
or around the time of childbirth was associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal 
complications, such as severe maternal morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, 
cesarean section, gestational diabetes, and adverse infant outcomes like preterm birth 
and low birthweight. SMI was an important maternal risk factor for cesarean section 
and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in pregnant populations and infants with low 
birthweight. Upon disaggregating mood and anxiety disorders, perinatal anxiety disorders 
contributed the most to maternal and infant morbidity. Maternal factors such as Medicaid 
coverage, residence in an urban area, substance use disorder, obesity, and multiparity were 
significantly associated with increased risk for each maternal mental disorder. Birthing 
people with episodic and inadequate prenatal care experienced an elevated risk of a perinatal 
mental health event. SMI was the most important contributor to hospital readmissions in the 
postpartum period. Lastly, PMAD, SMI, and MDP were associated with significantly higher 
inpatient childbirth costs, revealing the high medical cost burden of maternal mental health 
morbidity.

Pregnancy is both a vulnerable and life-altering time involving several physical, social, and 
psychological adjustments (Grattan & Ladyman, 2020; Pownall et al., 2022; Vesga-Lopez 
et al., 2008). Often, obstetric complications are followed by mental health sequelae in 
the perinatal and postpartum period (Montagnoli et al., 2020).. For example, compared to 
vaginal deliveries, women who experienced a cesarean section were much more likely to be 
diagnosed with depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive, or somatic symptom disorders in 
the three months (Dekel et al., 2019) and six months (Skov et al., 2022) after childbirth. 
In more severe cases, cesarean section has been associated with the most severe psychiatric 
disorders, including suicidal behavior and attempts, up to one year after childbirth (Zhang

et al., 2021). We observed a strong association between severe maternal morbidity and a 
PMAD or MDP diagnosis, whereby anxiety disorders were the largest contributor to severe 
maternal morbidity risk. A recent U.S.-based population health study documented that 
birthing populations with a mental health disorder were 1.5 times more likely to experience 
SMM compared to those without (Brown et al., 2022). Another Swedish cohort study 
showed that persons recovering from an SMM-related childbirth were much more likely to 
receive treatment for a psychiatric disorder in the year post-childbirth (Wall-Wieler et al., 
2019).

Our study revealed an excess risk of gestational diabetes in the presence of a PMAD or a 
MDP diagnosis. The linkage between gestational diabetes and a greater risk of prenatal 
or postpartum mental health disorders is well supported in the literature, particularly 
among racially and ethnically diverse populations (Delanerolle et al., 2021; Horsch et al., 
2018). In fact, women diagnosed with gestational diabetes were two-fold more likely to 
experience pregnancy or postpartum-related depression than women without a diagnosis 
(Horsch et al., 2018). Results from a recent systematic review suggest a strong connection 
between psychosocial well-being and dietary and lifestyle behaviors (e.g., physical fitness) 
for pregnant women encountering a gestational diabetes diagnosis (Gilbert et al., 2021). 
More interventional research, especially during pregnancy, should couple psychological 
and social support with lifestyle interventions to reduce the short-term psychological risk 
and potentially safeguard against gestational diabetes-related cardiovascular and metabolic 
disorders later in life (Horsch et al., 2018).

Similar to results from our study, prenatal anxiety and depressive disorders have also been 
shown to significantly increase the risk for a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy diagnosis, 
and in some instances result in a shorter gestational period (Horsley et al., 2022). Results 
from a prospective Mexican cohort showed that anxiety, sleep or social dysfunction, and 
acute somatic symptoms at 20 weeks of gestation were associated with a higher risk 
of developing gestational hypertensive disorders (Garza-Veloz et al., 2017). Preexisting 
depression or anxiety disorder in the one year before conception has been associated with 
chronic hypertension and preeclampsia during pregnancy (Thombre et al., 2015), and limited 
research has shown that active-duty women with a PTSD diagnosis before conception were 
more likely to experience gestational hypertension (Nash et al., 2019).

Women who experience maternal psychological distress, such as pregnancy-related anxiety 
or mood disorders, have an elevated risk of preterm birth (Ståhlberg et al., 2020). Similar 
to other population-based cohort studies, we observed SMI (includes the diagnosis of a 
bipolar disorder) and depressive disorders were associated with excess risk for preterm 
birth (Mei-Dan et al., 2015). Some research has shown that preterm birth coupled with 
other maternal somatization disorders may result in a higher risk for mood and anxiety 
disorders for postpartum women (Misund et al., 2013) and children (Ståhlberg et al., 2020). 
One mechanism linking maternal distress with adverse infant health outcomes is parental 
confidence (Choe et al., 2013). One study found a reduction in confidence levels following 
a preterm or cesarean birth (Woodward et al., 2014).. Still, maternal distress has also been 
observed following the childbirth of full-term babies (Harris et al., 2018). The persistence 
of maternal distress during pregnancy and the postpartum period is a leading risk factor for

impaired mother-child attachment, infant developmental delays, and childhood and later in 
life health risks (Anderson & Cacola, 2017; Yaari et al., 2019).

For our sample, we observed a higher risk of low birthweight for women with SMI. Very 
few studies have looked at the association between SMI and low birthweight (Rusner et 
al., 2016). We found only one study that showed an episode of SMI during pregnancy was 
associated with nearly a three-fold risk of having a low birthweight infant (Boukakiou et al., 
2019). Compared to women with no history of mental illness, a retrospective birth cohort 
study examining women with schizophrenia or major affective disorders (i.e., two forms 
ofSMI) in Australia showed no association with LBW (Jablensky et al., 2005), while a 
Taiwan-based study showed higher risk of LBW for women with bipolar disorder (Lee & 
Lin, 2010).

People with a mental health condition at or around the time of childbirth also incur higher 
medical costs per childbirth (Brown et al., 2021). One national study showed the mean costs 
are $458 higher per childbirth event (Brown et al., 2022). We observed an even higher mean 
cost per childbirth ranging from $1968 for an MDP event to $4029 per childbirth associated 
with a PMAD diagnosis.

Prior research has shown that roughly two women in 1,000 are at elevated risk for an 
incident or exacerbated episode of severe mental illness in the early weeks of the postnatal 
period (Kendell et al., 1987; Munk-Olsen et al., 2016; Woody et al., 2017). Our study 
showed that women with PMAD or SMI were more than two-fold more likely to be 
readmitted to the hospital. Women in our sample who were diagnosed with a perinatal 
anxiety disorder were three times as likely to be readmitted for inpatient care in the 45 days 
following childbirth. Results also demonstrated elevated risk for hospital readmission in the 
postnatal period among women diagnosed with MDP (i.e., 150% the risk of a readmission), 
depressive disorders (i.e., 190% the risk of a readmission), and who had a prior history 
of depression (i.e., 285% the risk of a readmission) or anxiety (i.e., 175% the risk of a 
readmission) compared to readmissions for other reasons. A previous study found that the 
risk of psychiatric readmission for women was 10 to 19 days post-childbirth, whereby a pre-
existing diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder was the strongest risk factor (Munk-Olsen 
et al., 2009). One study found non-Latina Black women experience both higher rates of 
prenatal depressive symptoms and use significantly lower volume of postpartum counseling 
services and medications than non-Latina White women (Declercq, 2021). Reasons behind 
lower use of postpartum counseling services among non-Latina Black women may include 
cultural wariness of counseling (Woods-Giscombe, 2010), stigma with accessing mental 
health services (Boyd et al., 2011), limited accessible mental health services (Goodman et 
al., 2009), and logistical challenges, such as childcare and transportation. One proposed 
intervention strategy is mental health access at the site of obstetric services and telemedicine 
options (Declercq, 2021).

Black pregnant women in our sample were much less likely to be diagnosed with a PMAD 
or MDP condition compared to White women, indicating maternal mental disorders may 
be an under-diagnosed pregnancy risk in Black mothers. Because we relied on hospital 
administrative or billing data, we can only speculate why this may be the case. Some

research has pointed to gendered racism, lack of cultural sensitivity in providers, and 
stigma (e.g., “Strong Black Woman” persona) as prevailing reasons behind why Black 
women may underuse mental healthcare support services, even in the presence of higher 
levels of psychological distress (Woods-Giscombe et al., 2016). Racialized discrimination or 
racialized stigma during pregnancy has surfaced as one potential explanation for why Black 
mothers may experience reduced access to quality and timely health services, resources, 
and support (Mehra et al., 2020). One study using a small sample of pregnant women 
in Connecticut found that Black women repeatedly encountered racialized pregnancy 
stigma in health care, a persistent source of maternal stress (Mehra et al., 2020). Further, 
the experience of racism and racism-related stress during pregnancy may have adverse 
consequences for both mom and baby, including declines in maternal mental health 
status (Williams & Williams-Morris, 2010). Findings from a prospective cohort study on 
pregnant women in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. showed that the self-reported prevalence 
of personally experienced and the group experienced racism was 410% and 780% 
higher, respectively, for U.S.-born compared to foreign-born Black pregnant populations 
(Dominquez et al., 2009).

Elevated depression symptoms have been associated with perceived racial discrimination in 
Black pregnant women in the U.S. (Ertel et al., 2012). Moving beyond individual experience 
of racism, research has also shown that exposure to structural racism (racialized housing, 
education, employment, and health care patterns and practices that reinforce discriminatory 
beliefs, values, and distribution of resources) during pregnancy may adversely affect 
maternal and infant health outcomes for Black women (Bailey et al., 2017). A qualitative 
study showed that Black pregnant and postpartum women residing in racially and 
economically deprived neighborhoods (i.e., a proxy for structural racism) in Oakland, 
California, U.S. were 54.5% more likely to experience racial discrimination while receiving 
medical care (Chambers et al., 2020). In addition to the experience of racism among 
pregnant women, past childhood exposure to racism and environmental trauma has been 
associated with an increased risk for perinatal mental illness (Kim et al., 2020).

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is one of the first longitudinal studies to examine maternal 
mental health complications during pregnancy and the perinatal period in a Southern state 
characterized by poor reproductive and infant health outcomes. We were able to examine 
the incidence of maternal mental disorders over time for a lengthy study period (i.e., 1999–
2017) and for women with multiple childbirth events. Further, we disaggregated PMAD into 
contributing depressive or anxiety-related disorders.

Our results are subject to a few limitations. We focused our analysis on one state in 
the Southern U.S., but more research should include data from other states in the South. 
We relied on hospital administrative data used for service billing and were unable to 
obtain detailed data on maternal income, marital status, and family structure. Data on 
paternal factors, such as mental health disorders or treatment need, were also unavailable. 
Pregnant women with preexisting mental health conditions may have discontinued prenatal 
prescription drug use for fear of harming their infant. Discontinuation is particularly

common among women with bipolar disorders (Salim et al., 2018), and our analysis did not 
consider discontinuation or the potential complications introduced by stopping medication 
use while pregnant. Lastly, our data on maternal mental health disorders are subject to 
bias from coding and diagnostic errors, but prior research has shown higher reliability for 
well-defined disorders such as psychotic disorders (Davis et al., 2016).

Implications for Practice and/or Policy

Our study reveals that the prenatal period is a critical intervention point to improve 
the mental health of birthing people and infants across the lifespan. Prolonged support 
is necessary for people with the capacity for pregnancy, especially those from socially 
disadvantaged backgrounds or those whose infants experienced neonatal complications 
(Chen & Hayes, 2018, Singla et al., 2020). An existing state-based program in 
Massachusetts enhances provider capacity to address perinatal mood disorders by 
expanding: (1) physician training on screening, assessment, and treatment; (2) provider 
access to perinatal psychiatric consultations for pregnant and postpartum patients; and 
(3) patient connection with needed psychiatric care and mental health support during the 
perinatal period (Byatt et al., 2018; Kimmel, 2020). Recently, federal funds have been 
directed at implementing a “whole-person” approach to improve pregnancy and postpartum 
mental health by improving screening, assessment, and care for maternal depression, 
anxiety, and substance misuse (Kimmel, 2020). The program is currently focused in rural 
and medically underserved areas in Florida, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, Rhode 
Island, and Vermont. Multiple states have also enacted policies requiring universal screening 
for depression in postpartum women.

Our findings highlight the significant contribution of maternal mental health during and 
around the time of pregnancy to reproductive and infant health complications for a Southern 
birth cohort. Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders and mental disorders debuting during 
pregnancy were positively associated with increased risk of severe maternal morbidity, 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and gestational diabetes, as well as increased neonatal 
risks arising from a preterm birth or low birthweight at childbirth. Women diagnosed 
with severe maternal mental illness were at greater risk for a cesarean section or low 
birthweight infant. When disaggregating mood and anxiety disorders, results showed that 
anxiety was the most significant predictor of maternal and infant health complications. 
Perinatal mental disorders are a commonly recognized maternal phenomenon during the 
reproductive years. Still, more evidence-based interventions at the level of the individual and 
population-based public health interventions are needed to reduce the health, psychological, 
and socio-economic burden of these conditions on birthing people and their families.
