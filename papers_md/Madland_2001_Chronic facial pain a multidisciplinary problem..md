Chronic facial pain: a multidisciplinary problem

G Madland, C Feinmann

Abstract
Atypical facial pain is an unrecognised
and unhelpful diagnosis but one which
describes chronic pains that do not ﬁt the
present classiﬁcation system. Due to the
site of the pain, patients may seek and,
indeed, receive treatment
from dental
practitioners and specialists, but the pain
is often unresponsive and may have more
in common with unexplained medical
symptoms aVecting other areas of the
body, than with other dental symptoms.
This review suggests a need for a diagnos-
tic category of “chronic facial pain”,
which demands a multidisciplinary ap-
proach to diagnosis and management.
(J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2001;71:716–719)

Keywords: chronic pain; facial pain

Chronic idiopathic orofacial pain is an ill
understood group of conditions, which may
involve the whole of the mouth and face.
Unfortunately descriptions of disorders and
tend to be inﬂuenced by the
treatment
background of
the specialist assessing the
patient. Thus patients who see maxillofacial
surgeons have symptoms described in terms of
clicking, sticking, and locking of the temporo-
mandibular joint and pain in the associated
musculature. Ear, nose, and throat surgeons
may retain Costen’s outdated notion that the
pain is due to missing molar teeth and may
refer on to maxillofacial surgeons or restorative
dental specialists. Despite advice from the
National Institute of Health that “there is no
evidence linking occlusal abnormalities with
pain”, patients’ occlusions continue to be
adjusted by ill
informed practitioners, often
leading to more problems for patients.1

The NIH conference in 1996 reviewed the
issues on the management of orofacial pain,
concluding that major problems hampered
present diagnostic classiﬁcations and treat-
ment. Five years later, there is no greater clar-
ity in classiﬁcation.

Current diagnoses include tension headache,
migraine, neckache, temporomandibular disor-
der (temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction
syndrome, facial arthromyalgia), and atypical
facial pain. These pains seem to arise from blood
vessels, muscles, and joint capsules rather than
conforming to the distribution of sensory nerve
branches, as in trigeminal neuralgia. Artiﬁcial
distinctions in clinical presentation lead patients

ments, including dentists, neurologists, otorhi-
nologists, osteopaths, chiroporacters, and psy-
chiatrists, with little collaboration.

There are additional

important problems
concerning the recognition and deﬁnition of
underlying psychiatric disturbances. Emotional
disturbance, when present, is often mild and of
brief duration and psychiatric classiﬁcation has
proved an inadequate measure.

Chronic symptoms
Chronic symptoms and syndromes pose a
major challenge to medicine: they are com-
mon, often persistent, and are associated with
signiﬁcant distress, disability, and unnecessary
expenditure of medical resources. In United
Kingdom primary care, somatic symptoms and
syndromes account for 20% of consultations.
Among medical outpatients, somatic com-
plaints accounted for 35% of new referrals in a
United Kingdom study.2 Even among medical
inpatients, a substantial proportion have com-
plaints that are found to be functional. The
prevalence of emotional distress and disorder
in patients who attend hospital with unex-
plained syndromes (such as irritable bowel
syndrome) is higher than in patients with com-
parable medical conditions (such as inﬂamma-
tory bowel disease) and many such patients are
severely disabled.3

Wessely et al3 suggest that each medical spe-
cialty has deﬁned its own syndrome or
syndromes in terms of symptoms that relate to
their organ or interest, despite similarities in
case deﬁnition, reported symptoms, sex, out-
look, and response to treatment. Patients seek
help from doctors for symptoms, and doctors
diagnose diseases to explain them. Symptoms
are the patient’s
subjective experience of
changes in his or her body, diseases are objec-
tively observable abnormalities in the body.
DiYculties arise when the doctor can ﬁnd no
objective changes to explain the patient’s
subjective experience. The symptoms are then
referred to as medically unexplained or func-
tional. Atypical facial pain is relegated to the
dental
than neurological domain.
Wessely et al postulate that “the existence of
speciﬁc somatic syndromes
largely an
artefact of medical specialisation. That is to say
that the diVerentiation of speciﬁc syndromes
reﬂects the tendency of specialists to focus on
only those
to their
than any real diVerences
specialty,
rather
between patients” (p 936).

Symptoms and signs
There are four recognisable symptom com-
plexes of chronic orofacial pain, which may,
however, coexist: temporomandibular disorder
(myofascial
facial pain
face pain); atypical
(atypical facial neuralgia); atypical odontalgia
(phantom tooth pain); and burning mouth
syndrome (oral dysaesthesia, glossodynia, glos-
sopyrosis). They may be considered as medi-
cally unexplained symptoms aVecting four
regions of the mouth and face.

Atypical facial pain is no longer included in
the International Association for the Study of
Pain’s “classiﬁcation of chronic pain”.4 The
term originated to distinguish the condition
from “typical” trigeminal neuralgia, as the pain
neither follows the distribution of the periph-
eral nerve, nor responds to antiepileptic agents.
However, the categorisation of patients with
similar pain histories into a diagnostic pigeon
hole labelled “atypical” is self contradictory,
and the deﬁnition of a condition by what it is
not, rather than what it is, is unsatisfactory. A
better term might be “chronic facial pain”, as
the deﬁning characteristics are longevity and
site, as distinct
from temporomandibular
disorder which aVects the jaw rather than the
(mid-)face, and intraoral pains.

The pain is usually a continuous dull ache
with intermittent severe episodes, primarily
aVecting areas of the face other than joints and
muscles of mastication, such as the zygomatic
maxilla. Pain may be bilateral and will often
have been present for several years. Analgesics
are ineVective.

Atypical odontalgia has a similar character
but is localised to one or more premolar or
molar teeth, simulating pulpitis.5 There may be
a history of inappropriate dental treatment,
including extraction, and subsequent recur-
rence of symptoms apparently from another
tooth.

Patients often attribute their pain to an ante-
cedent event such as a dental procedure, or
minor trauma to the face. Despite the notori-
ous unreliability of such retrospective reports,
these attributions have led to the suggestion
that chronic facial pain may be a deaVerenta-
(compare phantom tooth
tion syndrome
pain).6

Similarities to postamputation pains include
burning quality, description as severe despite
lack of sleep disturbance, poor localisation, and
delay between injury and incidence. The lack
of response to nerve block is also a common
feature. Divergence from a classic picture may
well betray the inﬂuence of factors beyond
identiﬁable pathology. Depression is a common
feature but is more likely to be a consequence
of living with pain than a precursor to it.7

Ninety ﬁve per cent of patients with atypical
facial pain complain of other
symptoms,
including headache, neck and backache, der-
matitis or pruritis, irritable bowel, and dysfunc-
tional uterine bleeding. This prevalence is
much greater than in the normal population.8
Positron emission tomography has demon-
strated an increased contralateral cingulate
cortex activity (and decreased prefrontal cortex

www.jnnp.com

activity), in response to both heat and nocicep-
tive stimuli, in patients with atypical facial pain
relative to controls.9 This is suggestive of an
exaggerated perception of pain in response to
peripheral stimuli but how this might develop
remains a matter for speculation. The authors
thought it likely that the mechanism for the
diVerences found is related to anxiety and
attention and therefore that the pain might be
brought under conscious control. However, the
cross sectional nature of this evidence pre-
cludes any conclusions as to whether such cen-
tral changes are primary or secondary to pain.

Epidemiological considerations
Although the prevalence of joint related and
muscle related symptoms has been studied, the
epidemiology of chronic facial pain remains
unclear. An obvious explanation for why some
people choose to consult whereas others do not
is the severity of their symptoms. Sadly, epide-
miological studies of facial pain have tended to
ignore intensity and frequency of symptoms
and recorded only their presence or absence.

Orofacial pain is a common problem aVect-
ing at least 10% of the adult population and
50% of the elderly population, and its inad-
equate recognition and management present
an enormous problem to the health service.
The sex distribution is thought to be equal in
the general population, but four times as many
women as men seek help.10 Barksy and Borus
have described how changes in social attitudes
have reduced the public tolerance to mild
symptoms and benign inﬁrmities, physiological
responses to anxiety are also misinterpreted as
illness. Isolated symptoms are then identiﬁed
as disease by patients.11

Associated personality and psychiatric
problems
There is a long standing association in the
literature between chronic facial pain and psy-
chological distress, particularly depression.12
This is consistent with other chronic pain
groups, in which the prevalence of depressive
symptoms is consistently higher than in the
general population and many other medical
populations.13 Studies comparing patients with
organic lesions and patients with indeterminate
chronic pain, report considerably higher preva-
lence of depression among the second.14 This
suggests that beliefs and attributions about the
cause of their symptoms may aVect psychologi-
cal wellbeing in patients with chronic pain.

A “diathesis-stress” framework has been
proposed to explain the high comorbidity
between chronic pain and depression.15 This
approach encourages identiﬁcation of vulner-
ability factors in the individual person as well
as investigation into the nature of the stressor,
and may be a useful theoretical basis from
which to advance the study of depression in
chronic pain.

Management
The treatment oVered to a patient with chronic
facial pain will be determined by the specialist
understanding of the clinician to whom he or
she is referred.16 A multidisciplinary approach

718

is therefore preferable and should be adopted
for diagnostic and prognostic assessment. Pos-
sible dental or neurological causes, including
trigeminal or craniocervical neuropathy, must
be eliminated with clinical and radiographic
investigation by a specialist, but extensive
investigation can lead to patients being oV
loaded from specialist to specialist in search of
a diagnosis, and feeling ill understood, overin-
vestigated, and dissatisﬁed. Patients want to
know what is wrong with them rather than
what is not wrong. Recent evidence suggests
that it may be more helpful to assess patients in
terms of disability and coping strategies, rather
than pain intensity itself.17 There is a real need
to make diagnosis realistic in terms of what
patients are told and what they understand
about their problems.18 19 Patients must feel
that the physician believes in their pain and that
the patient’s understanding or attribution of
the pain is accepted. It is crucial that physicians
and patients reach an agreement about how to
manage the pain. Thereafter, the mainstays of
treatment are counselling and antidepressant
medication. There is no evidence from ran-
domised trials of beneﬁt from surgical inter-
vention, which should in itself be enough to
discourage such an intervention, even in the
face of patient entreaty. Patients with chronic
pain are often desirous of a concrete cause and
treatment, and will therefore request surgery,
but there is reason to think that surgery may in
fact worsen the problem.

In a 4 year review of a mixed group of 71
patients with “idiopathic” facial pain who had
initially participated in a double blind trial of
dothiepin, and received further courses of the
drug and counselling sessions, 43% of the
patients with chronic facial pain were pain
free.8 The “atypical” patients were the least
responsive.

Pain relief with tricyclic agents seems to be
independent of the antidepressant eVect of the
drugs.20–22 These drugs are considered to act by
altering the sensory discriminative component
of pain. The possibility of interference with
serotonin reuptake in the brain stem has been
proposed.22 In two short term studies, the sero-
tonin antagonist iprazochrome had equivocal
eVects on a group of 30 patients with chronic
facial pain23 but ﬂuoxetine improved pain
severity and distress
in a group of 178
non-depressed patients with chronic facial
pain.24

Unfortunately, dental and medical practi-
tioners are often reluctant to prescribe antide-
pressant agents, mistakenly considering them
to be addictive or to have overwhelming side
eVects. In addition, inadequate dosage and
duration, perhaps in combination with ex-
pressed lack of conﬁdence in their eYcacy, pre-
vent the drugs from having any beneﬁcial
eVect. The liaison psychiatrist is currently the
only specialist appropriately trained in drug
treatments.

Cognitive behavioural therapy, in combina-
tion with drug treatment, has been found to
reduce the pain’s interference with life and to
increase perceived control over life, in patients

with chronic facial pain.24 EVective communi-
cation during the early phases of facial pain
may prevent the development of long term
problems. Clinicians should be aware of the
importance of listening to the patient’s beliefs
about their pain, and of trying to address their
concerns without resorting to outdated psy-
chogenic models of pain. Patients gain enor-
from having their symptoms
mous beneﬁt
acknowledged as part of a group of conditions
with which clinicians are familiar. An infor-
mation booklet is also likely to be helpful
(available from the authors on request).
Reassurance about the non-malignant nature
of chronic pain is also important, but empty
promises that “things will get better” are
unhelpful. The message is that
talking to
patients is often more useful, albeit sometimes
more demanding, than operating on them.

Conclusions
(1) “Chronic facial pain” is a more descriptive
term than “atypical facial pain” and should be
adopted for continuous, dull pain in the face, of
greater than 6 months duration, with intermit-
tent severe episodes. It diVers from temporo-
mandibular disorder and burning mouth syn-
drome,
site (mid-face), and
longevity (lacking a responsive acute form—
compare temporomandibular disorder), but,
once established, all have features in common
with other medically unexplained conditions,
and require a multidisciplinary approach.

in terms of

(2) The management of this heterogeneous
group of patients with pain is complicated by
the area of the body involved, and by the inter-
action of organic and psychological factors in
the somatising process. No single clinical
specialty receives the training required for the
diVerential diagnosis and management of these
pain disorders and, hence, there is both a need
for multidisciplinary clinics, and for speciﬁc
training programmes in dental and medical
undergraduate curricula.

(3) Although there is an obvious need for
prompt elimination of possible organic disease
such as tumour, there is also the danger of
investigation and provision of
overzealous
treat-
inappropriate and irreversible dental
ment. General dental and medical practitioners
must appreciate the risk of exacerbation of
associated psychological distress and the
importance of psychological assessment and
counselling at an early stage.

(4) Drugs such as dothiepin and ﬂuoxetine
are of proved, if modest, beneﬁt in the manage-
ment of chronic idiopathic orofacial pain,
although
anti-
originally
depressant drugs. Provision of
information,
drug treatment, and counselling, are comple-
mented by cognitive therapy speciﬁcally aimed
at reducing interference with life.
