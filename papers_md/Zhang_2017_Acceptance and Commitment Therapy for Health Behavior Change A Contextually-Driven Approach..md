Promoting health behavior change presents an important challenge to theory and
research in the ﬁeld of health psychology. In this paper, we introduce a context-
driven approach,
the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model which
is built on Relational Frame Theory. The ACT-based intervention aims to promote
individuals’ new health behavior patterns through the improvement of the key construct
of psychological ﬂexibility, which is deﬁned as the ability to contact
the present
moment more fully with acceptance and mindfulness as a conscious human being.
Building on the psychological ﬂexibility model, implemented through the six core ACT
long term health behavior change
processes,
through committed acts in service of chosen values while acknowledging and accepting
the existence of contrary thoughts, rules, and emotions as part of themselves but not
determinant of their behaviors. Taking advantage of this context-driven approach of
health behavior change, we recommend researchers and practitioners to design their
health behavior change intervention programs based on ACT.

INTRODUCTION

The pragmatic utility of psychological interventions on health behavior changes are judged by
their eﬀectiveness in promoting sustained and desired behavior change over an extended period
of time. For example, eﬀective interventions are not only those that get people to increase their
steps per day or to eat a healthy meal, but also are those that maintain such gains months or
years beyond the initial intervention. Mainstream health behavior change approaches have focused
primarily on the content of cognitive and emotional variables that are thought to support long-term
behavior change. Traditionally, health behavior change interventions target the social cognitive
and belief-based variables to increase individuals’ intention (i.e., a person’s motivation toward the
target behavior in terms of direction and intensity) and self-eﬃcacy (i.e., one’s conﬁdence in being
capable of performing a novel behavior) in the hopes of maintaining the health behavior change
(Schwarzer, 2008). While these approaches can be helpful to a degree, the magnitude of health
problems and the maintenance of health behavior change suggests that alternatives are needed
(Kwasnicka et al., 2016). One important approach that gains more and more momentum is to apply
the context-driven approach to understand and predict health behavior change (Hayes, 2004). In

ACT and Health Behavior Change

the current mini review, the authors aim to introduce the context-
driven approach of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT;
Hayes et al., 1999) along with the description of how and
why Relational Frame Theory (RFT; Hayes et al., 2001) and
psychological ﬂexibility provide coherent theoretical foundations
and validated measures for ACT-based health behavior change.
This should not be viewed as a detailed guidance and/or a
systematic and comprehensive review, but more of a brief
explanation and introduction focused on illustrating the links
between the basic principles of ACT and related health behavior
change.

As compared to the content-driven approach,

in which
behavior change is based on thought content unique to each
particular behavior (Ellis, 1962; Beck, 1976), a context-driven
approach examines the social, psychological, and situational
context that regulates the behavioral impact of thought and
emotion (Hayes et al., 1999). For health behavior change,
instead of trying to directly change diﬃcult thoughts or feelings,
acceptance and mindfulness-based skills can be cultivated to
foster greater behavioral regulation. Perhaps the most studied set
of contextual processes of this kind is psychological ﬂexibility,
which is “the ability to contact the present moment more
fully as a conscious human being and to change, or persist
in, behavior when doing so serves valued ends” (Biglan et al.,
2008). Psychological ﬂexibility is contextual in the sense that
it refers to individuals changing their relationships with private
events (i.e., thoughts, memories, feelings, and bodily sensations),
not the events themselves. For example, psychological ﬂexibility
may focus on teaching a dieter to be mindful and observe an
urge to eat a chocolate cake without necessarily attempting get
rid of that urge. The content surrounding a temptation to eat
something delicious may include such things as judgments about
whether this urge is good or bad; psychological ﬂexibility suggests
that the focus should be on how the individual interacts with
these thoughts, rather than their form or frequency. Accordingly,
the ultimate goal for individuals, initiating and maintaining the
health behavior change, is to make said change(s) consistent with
their chosen values (e.g., having a healthy lifestyle) even in the
face of diﬃcult thoughts or emotions.

Health behavior change is a dynamic process. Psychological
ﬂexibility has much to oﬀer in the context of health behavior
change as a theoretical guide for cultivating long-term
improvements
in behavior. According to Kashdan and
Rottenberg (2010), four aspects of psychological ﬂexibility can
be viewed as fundamental to health, including: (a) recognizing
and adapting to various situational demands, (b) shifting
mindsets or perspective when personal or social functioning
are compromised, (c) balancing competing desires, needs, and
life domains, and (d) being aware of, open, and committed to
behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values. These four
aspects of psychological ﬂexibility are well positioned to explain
successful behavioral maintenance toward healthy living in a
real-life context (Kwasnicka et al., 2016).

In principle, psychological ﬂexibility can facilitate lasting
change in three ways:
to,
and improved maintenance of, value-driven behaviors, (b)
by strengthening a willing, open, and accepting method of

(a) by increasing commitment

experiencing psychological events thus reducing psychological
barriers to behavior change, and (c) by improved awareness of
one’s internal and external environment through mindfulness
processes that allow behavioral choices to be better ﬁtted to the
contextual situation (Butryn et al., 2011). Functionally speaking,
these processes are assessed empirically, in part, by examining
whether psychological ﬂexibility serves as the change mechanism
for maintenance of adaptive and healthy behaviors (Ciarrochi
et al., 2010).

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a behavior change
method based on RFT and is explicitly oriented toward the
development of greater psychological ﬂexibility (Hayes et al.,
1999). Although much of the early ACT work targeted mental
health, from the beginning there was also a focus on health
behavior change (of the ﬁrst three studies done on ACT in
the 1980s one was on diet, and another on dealing with
tolerance of physical pain) and that interest has only grown
in recent years (e.g., Butryn et al., 2011; Manlick et al., 2013;
Bricker et al., 2014, 2017; Moﬃtt and Mohr, 2015). ACT
oﬀers an alternative to traditional attempts to control unwanted
psychological experiences. Rather than trying to control the
content of thinking and emotions, ACT aims to help individuals
change their relationship to these events (Hayes, 2004). In ACT,
the goals of the health behavior change interventions are not
explicit replacement of previous unhealthy psychological events
with new and healthy events, but the concurrent cultivation of
acceptance toward of the occurrence of unhealthy psychological
events, defusion from strict adherence to those events (i.e.,
observe the events for what they are as just thoughts of our mind,
rather than becoming entangled and fused with them), and the
committed action of behaviors that support living in ways that
serve predetermined healthy values. In this way, habits for the
new healthy behaviors may be established with greater resiliency
to psychological barriers.

Preliminary evidence of ACT on direct and initial behavior
change as well as promotion of behavioral maintenance
has been established. ACT has been investigated in several
health related domains, with positive long-term results. For
example, the eﬀectiveness of a randomized brief physical-activity-
focused ACT-based intervention produced signiﬁcant increases
in individuals’ levels of physical activity. The skills taught in
this intervention were mindfulness, values clariﬁcation, and
willingness to experience distress via face-to-face intervention
(Butryn et al., 2011) or via DVD (Moﬃtt and Mohr, 2015).
In smoking cessation treatment, the eﬀectiveness of ACT as
compared to other interventions (e.g., nicotine replacement
functional analytic psychotherapy, and cognitive
treatment,
behavioral
therapy) has been demonstrated in a series of
RCTs (e.g., Giﬀord et al., 2004, 2011; Hernández-López et al.,
2009; Bricker et al., 2014, 2017). ACT has been recommended
as an acceptance-based self-regulation framework for weight
management (Lillis and Kendra, 2014), with awareness of
decision-making thoughts and commitment to chosen values
viewed as two key components (Forman and Butryn, 2015). For
example, a 1-day mindfulness and acceptance-based workshop
targeting obesity-related stigma and psychological distress is
eﬀective on weight loss and weight-speciﬁc acceptance coping;

by psychological ﬂexibility (Lillis et al., 2009).

RELATIONAL FRAME THEORY AND
HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE

As the underlying foundation of the ACT, RFT is a contemporary
behavioral account of language and human cognition. RFT
claims that language is not based on learned associations or
direct contingencies of a typical variety but is rather based on
learned relational responses – patterns of responding to one
event in terms of another (Hayes et al., 2001). Taking in to the
context of health behavior change, RFT provides advantages in
the degree of precision made possible when analyzing verbal
contributions to complex human behavior. When applied to
the topic of health related behaviors, it provides a preliminary
behavioral account for how speciﬁc verbal rules come to exert
control over responding (Barnes and Keenan, 1993; Carpentier
et al., 2002). For example, the sound of the word “cigarette”
is placed in a “frame of coordination” or “sameness” with a
thin cylinder of ﬁnely cut tobacco rolled in paper. From an
RFT perspective, this relational response is not dependent on
the sound of the name because it is under arbitrary contextual
control, not the form of the related events or even direct contact
with them (Hayes, 1994; Barnes-Holmes and Barnes-Holmes,
2000; Hayes et al., 2001). The word “is” in the sentence “this
is a cigarette” regulates the relational response of sameness
between the name and object. These mutual relations then
combine into networks of relations and the eﬀects of related
events are transformed. If you were told that a particular brand
of cigarettes is laced with poison, you might be afraid to
touch a cigarette of that brand even though you had no direct
experience of bad things happening. From an RFT point of view,
health behavioral change maintenance depends on not only one
triggering factor like the intention of doing the behaviors but
strengthening or weakening existing relational responses and
learning new relational responses in the context of the target
behavior(s).

grounds

also provides

Relational Frame Theory

for
considering contextual
forms of ACT-based interventions
versus content-based forms. If cognitive relations are learned,
it is not fully possible to remove the historically established
psychological relations between environmental cues and past
unhealthy behaviors because there is no psychological process
called “unlearning” (Hayes, 2004). Furthermore, if relating can be
based on arbitrary cues it is hard to imagine how to deliberately
alter ones cognitive networks without unexpected eﬀects. This
makes lasting change diﬃcult. For example, telling yourself not
to think of eating unhealthy food (say “don’t think about potato
chips”) may paradoxically increase the likelihood that you are
thinking about unhealthy food, since the rule contains the very
verbal stimuli (the words “potato chips”) that are related to
the unhealthy food, and every time you check to see if you are
following the rule, you are very close to violating it (Wegner,
1994). This paradox of emotional or cognitive control may help
explain why attempting to control unhealthy behaviors may at

times cause the inverse eﬀect and why even individuals who
choose to change their eating behavior, from an unhealthy to a
healthy diet, may struggle to maintain this new lifestyle choice
despite reporting high motivation.

To overcome the problem of this paradoxical eﬀect, RFT
provides a theoretical explanation for the importance of using
ACT-based interventions to develop psychological ﬂexibility
toward the verbal/cognitive networks that establish relations
among stimuli, rules, and behaviors. People may need to learn
how to strengthen or weaken the behavioral impact of rules
rather than attempt to relate their presence or absence to success
or failure. This breath of application is one reason ACT has
been used to promote individuals’ psychological ﬂexibility across
a wide domain of health-related behaviors (e.g., Lillis et al.,
2009; Butryn et al., 2011). For example, a diabetic person who
can strengthen a values-linked rule such as “if I carry too
much excessive weight I may not see my children grow up”
may successfully reduce excessive eating throughout the day.
learning to weaken the impact of shame-linked
Conversely,
rules like “I am a fat failure” through mindfulness and defusion
methods described below fosters that same behavioral end.

Very recently,

implicit methods of cognitive assessment,
derived from RFT, have been used to predict the motivational
impact of verbal descriptions on the
relation between
athletic activity and its outcomes, altering exercise levels
and persistence through motivational operations (Jackson et al.,
2016). Accordingly, the eﬀects of the sensory, or perceptual,
consequences of eating can be altered based on how an
individual frames those consequences verbally, and by how the
person relates to their own verbal processes. A similar eﬀect has
been empirically shown in the physical activity of people who
avoid pain (e.g., Vowles et al., 2007). Therefore, more research
should be conducted in the ﬁelds of health, behavior, and clinical
psychology to further clarify the processes underlying RFT
principles, ACT processes, and health behavior change.

ACT FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY
MODEL

Psychological ﬂexibility model
is a behavior change model
based on RFT and its applied extensions that is used for
understanding how rule-following behavior can aﬀect behavior
(Hayes et al., 1999; Gross and Fox, 2009) based on how
people interact with their own language processes (Bond et al.,
2006). According to the psychological ﬂexibility model, which
underpins ACT, psychological ﬂexibility consists of six primary
components: defusion, acceptance, self as context, contact with
the present moment, values, and committed action. Psychological
inﬂexibility is the opposite: fusion, experiential avoidance, the
conceptualized self, rigid attention to the past or future, unclear
values, and inaction, impulsivity, or persistence avoidance.

Psychological ﬂexibility promotes behavior that aligns with the
individual’s values rather than allowing thoughts about events to
dominate regardless of their usefulness. To date, ACT is the most
researched intervention model targeting psychological ﬂexibility.

ACT and Health Behavior Change

Psychological ﬂexibility is described as the ability to contact the
present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to
change or persist in behavior such that one continues to behave in
a way that is consistent with their pre-established and identiﬁed
values (Hayes et al., 1996). The following will brieﬂy describe
these six ﬂexibility processes and relate them to health behavior.

merely the “what if ” contexts reﬂective of rumination over past
experiences and anxious anticipation of future ones (Bond et al.,
2006). When individuals attend ﬂexibly, ﬂuidly, and voluntarily
to the immediately relevant internal and external environment,
performance demands can be better adjusted to what is presently
occurring.

Defusion
A deﬁning concept of psychological ﬂexibility is defusion. In
individuals respond to the
situations where fusion occurs,
content of their language as if those descriptions are literally
occurring (Hayes et al., 1999). For example, an individual
attempting to quit smoking may experiencing physiological
distress and may engage in verbal behavior that describes the
context as “this is too diﬃcult, I can’t quit.” When this verbal
behavior is seen as a literal description of ability, the individual
may return to smoking as a function of the description of the
event and not as function of what they are physically capable
of achieving. Defusion is the use of function-altering cues and
strategies to reduce the transformation of stimulus functions in
such cases, thus changing the impact of verbal events on other
behavioral processes. Said in a more commonsense way, defusion
it looking at thoughts with an attitude of dispassionate curiosity.
Defusion methods, such as repeating the name of a feared object
until it loses meaning, may reduce the impact of such thoughts
(Blackledge, 2015).

these experiences

Acceptance
Acceptance occurs when an individual willingly experiences
automatic, and sometimes unwanted, emotions or sensations
without attempting to control the form, frequency, or situational
(Bond et al., 2006). The
sensitivity of
psychological ﬂexibility model contends it is not the content of
emotions that become problematic to a quality life but rather
problems arise when individuals interact with these events in
an avoidant way (Bond et al., 2006). An example of behavior
that is not indicative of acceptance is when an obese individual,
who experiences anxiety around exercise and the gym, avoids
these situations where anxiety occurs. Conversely, an individual
experiencing anxiety around exercise and engaging in acceptance
responses would instead acknowledge the anxiety with a sense of
dispassionate curiosity and allow themselves to experience these
emotions and situations where they occur. Scores of studies have
shown that such strategies increase task persistence (Levin et al.,
2012).

Flexible Attention to the Present Moment
Human beings are uniquely adept at problem solving and
planning. While these behaviors are often beneﬁcial, they can
sometimes be maladaptive, especially when language patterns
become fused with temporal and evaluative statements. Problem
solving always requires examination of the past and future (e.g.,
“How did I get here?” “Where am I going?”), but can overwhelm
ﬂexible attention to the present environment, both external and
internal. Working in coordination with acceptance and defusion,
contact with the present moment helps individuals respond
while in touch with current environmental demands rather than

Self-as-Context
The concept of self-as-context refers to the perspective skills
needed for an individual to report on their own behavior
from a consistent perspective or point of view. RFT research
shows three key deictic relational frames are involved: I/YOU,
HERE/THERE, and NOW/THEN (Hayes et al., 2006). When
“I/HERE/NOW” comes together, it yields a sense of self as
an observer. An individual, who can see and recognize their
own verbal descriptions of themselves as distinct from the
“I/HERE/NOW” perspective, may feel less threatened by negative
statements about the self. For example, someone engaging in
addictive behavior stating “I’m a no good drunk” might more
readily recognize that statement merely as a thought that does not
summarize themselves as a totality. By changing the statement to
“I am having the thought that I am a no good drunk” they may
thus reorient toward better quality of life behaviors.

This ﬁrst

four ﬂexibility processes provide a working
deﬁnition of mindfulness in a psychological ﬂexibility model.
The processes of adopting chosen values and commitment to
the action of health behaviors relates to both initiation and
maintenance of health behavior change.

Values
Values are deﬁned as chosen immediate qualities of ongoing
patterns of action that are verbally established as reinforcers
(Hayes et al., 1999). For example, an individual may value
“investing in family life.” Such a statement is diﬀerentiated from
a goal in that a value is not a tangible outcome such as “Friday
family movie night” but is instead a quality of action. Values
are known to increase task persistence across multiple health
related behavior (e.g., Chase et al., 2013; Jackson et al., 2016).
An individual who values investing in family life will engage
in multiple behaviors that contribute to that stated value, i.e.,
helping children with homework, attending soccer and dance
lesions, date nights, open communication, dressing up for date
nights, exercising to model and pattern healthy life behaviors and
so on. Values based living then, is living in such a way that values
provide direction like a compass.

traditional behavioral approaches (Bond et al., 2006). As
part of psychological ﬂexibility, committed action takes the
role of expanding an individual’s valued responses into larger
and larger patterns of activity. Larger patterns can be built by
obtainable intermediary goals that comport with pre-established
values. For example, an individual who experiences exercise
anxiety and has historically pulled out or stopped exercising,
may now set the goal of walking for an hour, three times a

eﬃcacy and resilience/durability of ACT interventions on
health behavioral change is urgently needed (e.g., randomized
controlled trials).

CONCLUSION

Although ACT was originally developed in the ﬁeld of
clinical psychology (Hayes, 2004),
it has shown promise in
facilitating individuals’ health behavior change with greater
eﬃcacy and fulﬁllment in individuals’ real-life contexts. The
authors call
for the further application of ACT and its
underlying psychological ﬂexibility model into the promotion
of health behavior change. In particular, the health behavior

pain in order to increase beneﬁcial physical activity (e.g.,
VanBuskirk et al., 2014). Finally, we emphasize that empirical
